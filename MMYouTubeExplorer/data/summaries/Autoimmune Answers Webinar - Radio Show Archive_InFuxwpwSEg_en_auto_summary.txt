Video: Autoimmune Answers Webinar - Radio Show Archive_InFuxwpwSEg_en_auto
==================================================

In this webinar, Anthony William emphasizes the importance of understanding autoimmune diseases and debunks the myth that the body attacks itself, asserting instead that these conditions stem from viral infections. He discusses how misinformation in both conventional and alternative medicine has led to confusion about autoimmune conditions and stresses the necessity of accessing pure, untainted information for healing. William advocates for lifestyle changes and specific foods that support the immune system and combat underlying viral issues, ultimately encouraging participants to take charge of their health with the right knowledge.
