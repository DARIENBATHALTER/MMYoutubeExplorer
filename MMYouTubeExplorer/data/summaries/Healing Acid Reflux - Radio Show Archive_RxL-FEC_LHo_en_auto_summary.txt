Video: Healing Acid Reflux - Radio Show Archive_RxL-FEC_LHo_en_auto
==================================================

In this episode, Anthony William discusses the importance of understanding health information that often contradicts mainstream medical beliefs, particularly focusing on acid reflux and its underlying causes. He emphasizes that acid reflux is often misdiagnosed and that many practitioners lack knowledge about the true origins of the condition, which can stem from bacterial acid rather than gastric acid. William advocates for the use of natural remedies, such as celery juice and licorice root, to aid in healing and restoring proper digestive health.
