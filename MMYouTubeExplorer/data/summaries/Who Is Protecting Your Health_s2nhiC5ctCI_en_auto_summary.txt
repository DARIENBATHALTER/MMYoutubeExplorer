Video: Who Is Protecting Your Health_s2nhiC5ctCI_en_auto
==================================================

The video discusses how science, particularly in the context of chronic illness, tends to protect its own interests rather than prioritizing the well-being of individuals. It suggests that the blame for chronic illnesses is often unjustly placed on the patients, particularly women, by attributing their conditions to personal faults or psychological issues. This blame-shifting occurs because scientific research has yet to find definitive answers, leading to a stigmatization of patients instead.
