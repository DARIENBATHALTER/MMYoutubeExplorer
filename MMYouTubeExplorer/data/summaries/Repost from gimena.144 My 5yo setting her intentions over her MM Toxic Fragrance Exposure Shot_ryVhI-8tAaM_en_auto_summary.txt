Video: Repost from gimena144 My 5yo setting her intentions over her MM Toxic Fragrance Exposure Shot_ryVhI-8tAaM_es_auto
==================================================

The video appears to focus on a spiritual or healing practice involving a 'manzana muy sanador' (a very healing apple). The speaker expresses gratitude and sets intentions for personal healing, particularly targeting their arms and legs. Music accompanies the expression of gratitude and the consumption of the 'sanador' apple.
