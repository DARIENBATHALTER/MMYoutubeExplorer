Video: They Have Arrived Brain Saver Books_-kHXetwjWaE_en_auto
==================================================

The hardcovers for the 'Brain Saver' books are now available, and for the first time, the speaker will be reading a section from these books this Sunday. They encourage viewers to sign up for the newsletter to join the reading event. The books were initially one large volume, but due to publishing constraints, they were divided into two substantial books, each larger than any previous 'Medical Medium' book.
