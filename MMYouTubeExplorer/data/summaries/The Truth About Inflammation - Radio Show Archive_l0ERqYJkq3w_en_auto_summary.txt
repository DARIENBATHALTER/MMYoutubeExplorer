==================================================

In this episode, Anthony William, the Medical Medium, discusses the concept of inflammation, explaining that it is often mischaracterized as a standalone issue rather than a symptom of underlying causes, specifically injury or pathogens. He emphasizes that true healing comes from understanding these root causes and not merely labeling symptoms like inflammation. William also critiques the current medical approach to inflammation and Lyme disease, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of the body's responses and recommending anti-inflammatory foods as part of holistic healing.
