[109.56 - 114.68] is not a infomercial where you listen to
[112.36 - 117.12] the podcast in the first 10 minutes is
[114.68 - 118.80] selling all these products and you know
[117.12 - 122.12] what I mean and I don't know if you guys
[118.80 - 123.36] have picked up on that yet have you and
[122.12 - 124.68] you're sitting there selling all these
[123.36 - 126.48] products and all these programs

[128.00 - 132.08] on and I'm not saying is anything wrong
[130.60 - 133.76] with that people can do what they want I
[132.08 - 135.48] mean I get it people try to survive but
[133.76 - 136.84] the thing is is that we're we're talking
[135.48 - 138.72] about people that are sick and we're
[136.84 - 140.12] talking about people that you know
[138.72 - 142.60] chronically ill and we're talking about
[140.12 - 146.04] people that are not well so you know
[142.60 - 147.32] it's it's resources are minimal for so
[146.04 - 149.40] many people you know when we write the
[147.32 - 151.80] medical medium book spirit and I and we
[149.40 - 153.64] put the information in there and
[151.80 - 155.56] spirit's information in there you know
[153.64 - 157.80] you can get the book in in the library
[155.56 - 160.44] you don't even have to buy it and you
[157.80 - 162.84] can learn how to heal and use your
[160.44 - 164.52] resources on a minimal level so that
[162.84 - 166.40] when you do get things and have to get a
[164.52 - 169.92] certain supplement or something to help
[166.40 - 171.44] you it's going to help you it's not just
[169.92 - 174.00] hey look you wake up one morning it's
[171.44 - 175.56] like oh I I you know I trained in this
[174.00 - 177.08] this weird school and now I'm going to
[175.56 - 179.00] be like putting out a program and
[177.08 - 180.80] selling all the stuff and next thing
[179.00 - 182.12] know it's MLM or whatever it is it's not
[180.80 - 183.80] like that and the point the reason why
[182.12 - 186.12] I'm even talking about this is cuz with
[183.80 - 187.72] cleanses now you'll see a lot of cleanse
[186.12 - 189.20] programs cleanse things like you know
[187.72 - 191.00] and you can buy into all these different
[189.20 - 192.88] things and the thing is is are you
[191.00 - 194.76] buying into the right thing some of them
[192.88 - 196.48] have all these powdered herbs in there
[194.76 - 198.32] just all this powdered stuff and
[196.48 - 201.44] powdered shakes and powdered herbs and
[198.32 - 202.36] powdered stuff and you know and people
[201.44 - 203.92] they don't know if they're getting
[202.36 - 205.76] symptoms of detox if they're not getting
[203.92 - 207.24] symptoms of detox and all the leaders to
[205.76 - 209.40] all these different programs all no no
[207.24 - 211.56] you're detoxing you're detoxing oh no no
[209.40 - 214.08] that's detox detox without even having
[211.56 - 216.32] an idea that someone's a getting maybe a
[214.08 - 218.88] reigniting a reignition of some kind of
[216.32 - 220.88] illness or some kind of viral s the
[218.88 - 222.48] thing is is this before someone even
[220.88 - 223.80] detoxes it would be good to know what
[222.48 - 226.00] the hell's going on and what's really
[223.80 - 228.12] wrong with the person so that's the
[226.00 - 230.24] whole thing too the one thing I don't
[228.12 - 232.12] like I have to be honest is there's a
[230.24 - 233.84] lot of a lot of different experts out
[232.12 - 235.64] there offering cleansings and cleansing
[233.84 - 237.56] cleansing cleansing programs or whatever
[235.64 - 240.56] it is and detox programs and they're
[237.56 - 242.36] offering these things okay and but they
[240.56 - 244.16] don't even know why people are sick they
[242.36 - 246.16] just think it's all gut health they just
[244.16 - 247.76] think it's all gut they think oh it's
[246.16 - 248.96] just all gut problems you're just toxic
[247.76 - 251.32] and it's all gut problems and you have
[248.96 - 253.00] to detox they have no idea that the
[251.32 - 255.44] liver may have three or four viruses in
[253.00 - 258.40] it like two Epstein bars one shingles
[255.44 - 260.32] one hhv6 a cytoma virus and then and and
[258.40 - 262.16] other stuff like that they have no clue
[260.32 - 263.68] they have no clue that that um
[262.16 - 265.44] autoimmune disease isn't the body
[263.68 - 267.80] attacking itself they have no clue that
[265.44 - 270.16] it's it's actually viruses inflaming
[267.80 - 271.88] tissue they have no idea about the
[270.16 - 273.92] medical medium information which is the
[271.88 - 275.56] truth and why hundreds of thousands and
[273.92 - 277.00] thousands and actually now in the course
[275.56 - 278.64] it's Millions going on all these years
[277.00 - 280.24] that have actually healed and are
[278.64 - 281.76] getting better and they have no idea
[280.24 - 283.24] that so they're just like you know buy
[281.76 - 285.68] into the cleansing programs buy all
[283.24 - 287.80] these supplements with alcohol in them
[285.68 - 288.88] by all these powders you can get all I
[287.80 - 290.24] mean there's so many different things
[288.88 - 292.40] out there and I'm going into this right
[290.24 - 294.60] now because it's it's madness out there
[292.40 - 296.60] and for you to understand if you're
[294.60 - 297.96] detoxing not detoxing what's the signs
[296.60 - 300.40] what's the symptoms everything else you
[297.96 - 302.16] have to know how it works out there
[300.40 - 303.48] because that's a part of it cuz if
[302.16 - 305.08] you're Downing all these powders and
[303.48 - 306.84] taking all these alcohol supplements and
[305.08 - 309.20] you're just doing juice only and you're
[306.84 - 311.28] doing all that yeah you might be
[309.20 - 312.72] cleansing a little bit you also might be
[311.28 - 314.92] making yourself sick with with
[312.72 - 316.96] irritating the crap out of the Linings
[314.92 - 318.76] of the intestinal Linings with all these
[316.96 - 320.60] man-made powders that think it's good
[318.76 - 322.80] for you and just you know and you're
[320.60 - 325.36] spending $2,000 for the program and
[322.80 - 327.48] everything else I mean seriously it's
[325.36 - 330.64] just something to think
[327.48 - 332.88] about so so what you're going to get
[330.64 - 333.96] here is you're going to get you're going
[332.88 - 335.36] to get the truth and you're going to get
[333.96 - 337.12] it straight right here about cleansing
[335.36 - 339.12] and detoxing signs and symptoms and
[337.12 - 341.00] everything else and how to kind of kind
[339.12 - 343.12] of take care of yourself keep yourself
[341.00 - 345.44] safe so you could do it so you can do
[343.12 - 348.36] some cleansing now the thing is is that
[345.44 - 350.44] every single program that takes away all
[348.36 - 352.00] the different foods every every single
[350.44 - 354.16] um program that takes away all the bad
[352.00 - 355.56] foods processed foods I mean not all the
[354.16 - 357.40] bad foods but take away at least the
[355.56 - 358.92] processed foods and they take away the
[357.40 - 360.36] processed foods you're automatically
[358.92 - 362.04] cleansing
[360.36 - 363.72] so if somebody if somebody believes in
[362.04 - 365.44] this high protein diet and this you know
[363.72 - 368.76] and it's a clean high protein diet it's
[365.44 - 370.16] got some green juice in it it's got um
[368.76 - 370.96] now they're bringing celery juice in
[370.16 - 372.72] these things but they're not
[370.96 - 374.24] contributing to the source where it came
[372.72 - 375.32] from by the way which is medical medium
[374.24 - 378.40] of course you guys know that with the
[375.32 - 379.96] celery juice and because it went around
[378.40 - 381.48] like wildfire and everybody's being
[379.96 - 383.28] pushed into the band wag and everybody's
[381.48 - 384.92] jumping on the TR and no one's saying
[383.28 - 386.44] mean not not every just there there are
[384.92 - 388.40] some experts out there now they're like
[386.44 - 389.56] I their egos are so big they're not
[388.40 - 391.20] going to contribute it to where The
[389.56 - 393.28] Source came from it's unbelievable it
[391.20 - 395.40] happens I mean you never thought it
[393.28 - 397.24] would come to that to this day and I
[395.40 - 399.68] thought everybody at least had like you
[397.24 - 402.04] know a little bit more little bit more
[399.68 - 404.20] something to them it's it's unbelievable
[402.04 - 405.64] and so the deal is is this is if you go
[404.20 - 408.08] on to this healthy paleo diet you go
[405.64 - 409.68] into a healthy animal protein diet you
[408.08 - 411.00] go on to something like that and you're
[409.68 - 412.92] taking away processed foods because
[411.00 - 415.08] you're used to eating donuts and cookies
[412.92 - 418.76] you're going to be detoxing you're going
[415.08 - 421.64] to be detoxing you are it's it's all the
[418.76 - 424.48] different levels of detoxing and if if
[421.64 - 426.00] you go on a plant-based diet and it's
[424.48 - 428.12] just it's a say you go on a vegan
[426.00 - 429.36] plant-based diet and it's all cooked
[428.12 - 430.88] it's all cooked and even though it's
[429.36 - 432.28] high fat all these diets are high fat
[430.88 - 434.52] out there by the way you go on a the
[432.28 - 436.04] vegan um plant-based diet and it's high
[434.52 - 438.60] fat it's vegan it's all it's all cooked
[436.04 - 441.32] food plus you know oils and sesame oil
[438.60 - 442.52] and lots of tahini and nuts and seeds
[441.32 - 444.44] and everything else you got all this
[442.52 - 446.00] stuff going on in there and soy and soy
[444.44 - 448.92] oil and whatever it is that could be in
[446.00 - 450.64] it and you got that going on and it's
[448.92 - 453.36] it's not process there's no processed
[450.64 - 455.40] food in there the gluten gone the um
[453.36 - 456.56] it's vegan there's no eggs and dairy
[455.40 - 458.48] yeah you're going to be
[456.56 - 460.88] detoxing but there's different levels of
[458.48 - 462.32] detoxing there's different stages
[460.88 - 465.52] there's different places somebody could
[462.32 - 468.16] be for cleansing and detoxing and that's
[465.52 - 469.60] kind of how it goes and and you know
[468.16 - 472.32] it's it's it's
[469.60 - 474.60] a there's a lot to cover is what we're
[472.32 - 478.24] about to jump into there's a lot to
[474.60 - 479.56] cover it it's uh it's diverse it's
[478.24 - 481.24] complicated but we're going to going to
[479.56 - 483.60] simplify it in the best terms and the
[481.24 - 485.60] best way possible and where to start and
[483.60 - 487.32] how to go so if you're someone and
[485.60 - 488.52] you're on kind of a toxic diet you're
[487.32 - 489.72] eating whatever you're eating bread
[488.52 - 490.80] you're eating cookies you're eating
[489.72 - 492.44] different things you're eating some
[490.80 - 494.20] processed food not all processed food
[492.44 - 495.80] but a little bit of processed food you
[494.20 - 497.04] may think that you eat pretty healthy a
[495.80 - 499.04] lot of people do that they'll be like I
[497.04 - 500.24] eat pretty healthy I don't eat that bad
[499.04 - 501.32] I only have a little bit of this a
[500.24 - 502.92] little bit of that once in a while I
[501.32 - 504.36] have a bit and then when you really ask
[502.92 - 506.60] them you crack into it's like two weeks
[504.36 - 509.76] ago they ate some M&M's you know two
[506.60 - 511.32] weeks ago a week ago they had soda you
[509.76 - 513.52] know what I mean and you you crack into
[511.32 - 514.84] it it's like a candy bar you know what I
[513.52 - 515.76] mean it's like you crack into it and
[514.84 - 518.08] they they're already eaten some
[515.76 - 520.04] different things and or they might be
[518.08 - 522.32] like I did have a bagel and cream cheese
[520.04 - 523.60] so I had a bagel and cream cheese and
[522.32 - 525.44] they'll be like well I love the New York
[523.60 - 528.16] style Bagels I had one you know last
[525.44 - 529.68] week and when you really look into it
[528.16 - 531.08] they're not eating that good and a lot
[529.68 - 532.36] of people do this and it's all about
[531.08 - 533.80] survival it's all about doing the thing
[532.36 - 535.52] but then then they try to do well I had
[533.80 - 538.96] a chicken salad so I had chicken on top
[535.52 - 542.92] of a salad um I had that yesterday that
[538.96 - 545.08] was healthy they say um for breakfast I
[542.92 - 547.04] had some oatmeal or I didn't eat at all
[545.08 - 549.28] I just had my coffee and then I had a
[547.04 - 551.88] chicken salad for lunch for dinner I had
[549.28 - 553.72] some salmon and you know but then then
[551.88 - 556.36] another you know which is not at least
[553.72 - 558.08] it's not that processed that wasn't that
[556.36 - 560.28] processed although coffee is processed
[558.08 - 562.56] even though that's not that processed
[560.28 - 563.92] it's like so they might actually be like
[562.56 - 565.28] you know eating a little bit better
[563.92 - 567.76] feeling a little bit better just by
[565.28 - 569.56] doing that exercising whatever it is but
[567.76 - 571.32] it's all the different layers then if
[569.56 - 574.36] you go a little bit further like take
[571.32 - 576.20] away all of those things meaning take
[574.36 - 578.88] away the bagel and cream cheese you have
[576.20 - 581.76] take away you know the candy bar that
[578.88 - 583.68] they had last week take away um some
[581.76 - 585.24] kind of doughnut they ate take away
[583.68 - 586.88] these different things take away some
[585.24 - 588.76] kind of fried food they had at with a
[586.88 - 590.96] friend going take away a slice of pizza
[588.76 - 593.96] they had one weekend then detoxing
[590.96 - 595.28] starts to happen if it's a month of wait
[593.96 - 597.40] a minute I'm not going to have that
[595.28 - 599.24] slice of pizza wait a minute I know I
[597.40 - 600.72] listen I know you serious detoxers are
[599.24 - 602.12] probably laughing right now saying okay
[600.72 - 604.28] when is he going to get into the serious
[602.12 - 605.60] stuff because we've already been doing
[604.28 - 608.40] we've already been cleansing and
[605.60 - 610.48] detoxing I've done a 30-day 30-day juice
[608.40 - 612.08] fast he's got to start going into he's
[610.48 - 613.76] what's he talking about I'm we're going
[612.08 - 616.60] to get there we're going to get there
[613.76 - 618.88] it's important for you to know all of it
[616.60 - 622.28] so what happens if that person stops
[618.88 - 624.36] that slice of pizza twice a month stops
[622.28 - 627.92] that Bagel twice a
[624.36 - 630.12] month detoxing happens that's how it
[627.92 - 633.36] works and there's different levels of
[630.12 - 635.20] detoxing and that's automatically a
[633.36 - 637.28] person detoxing it's going to
[635.20 - 639.40] automatically happen say everybody's
[637.28 - 642.32] eating clean okay say everybody's eating
[639.40 - 645.12] clean clean paleo diet no processed food
[642.32 - 647.88] clean vegan diet no processed food clean
[645.12 - 651.08] raw vegan diet no processed food of
[647.88 - 652.88] course clean you know high protein diets
[651.08 - 655.16] with different fancy names on it no
[652.88 - 657.56] processed foods everybody's eating clean
[655.16 - 659.76] right everybody's eating clean and think
[657.56 - 662.12] about that but they're all eating high
[659.76 - 663.32] fat so they're all eating clean and
[662.12 - 666.52] they're all
[663.32 - 668.92] detoxing better than they would if they
[666.52 - 670.60] were eating High you know processed
[668.92 - 672.96] foods I mean processed foods so they're
[670.60 - 676.28] all detoxing a little bit they're all
[672.96 - 679.04] detoxing but if they're all on high fat
[676.28 - 681.20] they're not going to detox that much
[679.04 - 683.24] they're not going to detox that much you
[681.20 - 684.56] see where I'm getting I'm getting where
[683.24 - 686.40] can you be on a diet where you're
[684.56 - 688.76] detoxing all the time so you don't have
[686.40 - 690.36] to do radical crazy detoxes and mess up
[688.76 - 692.52] your body and make you sick and we're
[690.36 - 694.52] going to go into that and then as you're
[692.52 - 697.08] making yourself sick in your radical
[694.52 - 698.64] detox you're being told by the experts
[697.08 - 700.28] or the people who sold you the detox or
[698.64 - 702.24] anything else that you're just detoxing
[700.28 - 704.32] when really they didn't call the shots
[702.24 - 707.24] right and your body's going into like a
[704.32 - 710.60] cyto storm basically it's going into
[707.24 - 712.04] it's going into a storm and you're and
[710.60 - 713.80] and meanwhile you know what I mean you
[712.04 - 715.32] could be definitely detoxing in that
[713.80 - 717.48] 30-day radical cleanse but you could
[715.32 - 718.76] also be not doing yourself a favor and
[717.48 - 720.36] when you come out on the other side you
[718.76 - 721.68] could could be feeling better and some
[720.36 - 723.80] people don't feel better when they come
[721.68 - 725.76] out of the other side so just hang in
[723.80 - 728.52] there we're getting we're going to get
[725.76 - 730.76] there in this show so say you're on all
[728.52 - 733.36] these clean diets but they're high fat
[730.76 - 735.48] no processed high fat meaning it's if
[733.36 - 737.52] it's the Paleo it's chicken and meat and
[735.48 - 739.00] then you got that twice a day and then
[737.52 - 741.04] on top of that you got nut Butters in
[739.00 - 742.76] your smoothies in the morning and you
[741.04 - 744.72] got something in your coffee some kind
[742.76 - 746.76] of fat in your coffee or fat in whatever
[744.72 - 749.56] your water which is ridiculous so you
[746.76 - 751.56] got all that and then you got the you
[749.56 - 754.20] know you got the vegans and they're
[751.56 - 755.92] doing all just avocado they're doing nut
[754.20 - 758.44] dressings with lots of nuts they're
[755.92 - 759.80] doing nut and Seed crusts because you
[758.44 - 761.72] know for little desserts and you put
[759.80 - 764.20] fruit on top they're putting you know
[761.72 - 766.08] it's all about nuts seeds some people
[764.20 - 767.28] are all about oils in the vegan movement
[766.08 - 770.40] some people are all about lots of
[767.28 - 772.56] avocado and flax lots of flax going in
[770.40 - 775.84] lots of flax seed all that flax seed oil
[772.56 - 778.44] and all that so say you're doing that
[775.84 - 780.92] okay the thing is is yeah you were
[778.44 - 782.48] eating cleaner than if you were doing
[780.92 - 783.60] the processed foods and all the gluten
[782.48 - 786.16] and everything else you're eating
[783.60 - 788.48] cleaner so you are detoxing to a certain
[786.16 - 790.24] degree and people get some benefits
[788.48 - 792.44] they're like whoa I switched to vegan
[790.24 - 794.04] and I came out of a processed food diet
[792.44 - 795.32] or a junky diet switched to vegan it's
[794.04 - 796.80] really been helping me but you're still
[795.32 - 798.60] on this high fat diet and you're not
[796.80 - 800.12] going to cleanse that much past that
[798.60 - 803.56] point you're going not going to detox
[800.12 - 805.32] that much that past that point right
[803.56 - 807.56] same thing with the belet paleo diet or
[805.32 - 808.84] any kind of high fat high protein diet
[807.56 - 809.68] you're getting out of the processed food
[808.84 - 810.88] and you're going to be doing a little
[809.68 - 812.72] bit better you're going to be exercising
[810.88 - 814.04] you might lose a couple of pounds you
[812.72 - 815.68] might gain it back later but you might
[814.04 - 817.76] lose a couple of pounds you're
[815.68 - 818.84] exercising and you're detoxing a little
[817.76 - 820.00] you're feeling a little better you got
[818.84 - 822.24] the junk out of your system you're not
[820.00 - 826.20] going to get a you're not going to eat
[822.24 - 829.64] pizza and but you're but you're detoxing
[826.20 - 833.36] only to a point to a point there's so
[829.64 - 836.40] many layers and steps and when people go
[833.36 - 839.16] from from 100 to Ground Zero whatever it
[836.40 - 840.28] is you call it and they miss out on all
[839.16 - 843.48] the
[840.28 - 845.08] steps they detox yes but they also can
[843.48 - 847.76] make themselves sick sick with their
[845.08 - 849.80] detoxing program and it becomes just a
[847.76 - 851.20] whole Calamity a whole bunch of Calamity
[849.80 - 852.92] and then after their cleanses they don't
[851.20 - 854.00] even know how to eat right afterwards or
[852.92 - 856.56] where they're going and they're back
[854.00 - 858.84] into confusion
[856.56 - 860.36] land and I'm going to talk about signs
[858.84 - 863.96] and symptoms and all that when you're
[860.36 - 866.12] doing that but and and and say for
[863.96 - 867.72] detoxes that are intense we're going to
[866.12 - 869.80] cover that it's early in the show we're
[867.72 - 872.52] we're going to get there
[869.80 - 874.68] so then the next level is lowering those
[872.52 - 876.48] fats so you're on these clean diets
[874.68 - 879.00] clean paleo clean high protein clean
[876.48 - 880.52] vegan clean raw raw vegan clean
[879.00 - 881.72] vegetarian whatever now you're lowering
[880.52 - 883.96] the
[881.72 - 885.36] fats and it's just like the like the
[883.96 - 886.72] vegetarian the vegetarian that's saying
[885.36 - 888.56] well I don't eat processed foods I don't
[886.72 - 890.72] eat gluten I'm a vegetarian but I do eat
[888.56 - 892.44] some fish I do eat some eggs well you
[890.72 - 893.96] got you know high fat in the fish you
[892.44 - 895.88] got high fat in the eggs got high fat in
[893.96 - 897.20] the cheese and you start bringing that
[895.88 - 898.72] down and and vegetarians still eat
[897.20 - 900.16] avocado and they still eat lots of nuts
[898.72 - 903.08] so you got high fats and all those and
[900.16 - 905.96] you bring all that down same thing and
[903.08 - 907.80] so the deal is when you bring the fats
[905.96 - 910.92] down that's when the cleansing really
[907.80 - 915.60] happens that's when the cleansing really
[910.92 - 918.32] happens on a safe level on a safe
[915.60 - 920.76] level no one knows what happens inside
[918.32 - 922.28] their body you can be the greatest
[920.76 - 925.04] expert be like okay here's all the
[922.28 - 926.80] powders here's all the neutral pow
[925.04 - 929.28] powders you me ingesting every day you
[926.80 - 931.68] just mix this concoction up reminds me
[929.28 - 934.28] of the old carpet baggers used to sell
[931.68 - 936.80] or you know used to sell like a potion
[934.28 - 938.08] in a bottle and then everybody would
[936.80 - 940.44] come up and they be like here's your

[951.76 - 957.24] one herb or something or who knows
[953.76 - 959.92] what's in there dirt and it just it just
[957.24 - 961.76] it just it reminds me of that you know

[961.76 - 966.12] tried it I you know a uh a pharmacy
[964.76 - 968.36] actually helped me make this that's a
[966.12 - 971.56] carpet bagers phes used to actually used
[968.36 - 974.24] to they used to um make these tonics and
[971.56 - 976.80] send guys out to sell them phes used to
[974.24 - 978.40] and it used to be like one herb with
[976.80 - 980.80] just filled with
[978.40 - 982.92] alcohol and you know the thing is is
[980.80 - 985.12] like yeah we're not that far off from
[982.92 - 987.52] that believe it or not we're pound I
[985.12 - 990.44] mean like production lines right now
[987.52 - 992.72] cleansing powder cleansing this protein
[990.44 - 994.76] powders all this and what you just fill
[992.72 - 996.52] up your smoothies and whatever it is
[994.76 - 1000.68] you're cleansing you're detoxing who the
[996.52 - 1002.72] hell knows what come on I mean come on
[1000.68 - 1004.84] like whatever I mean I'm saying you know
[1002.72 - 1007.12] you got to know that that when you
[1004.84 - 1009.88] really think about the irony or or when
[1007.12 - 1011.40] you think about how ridiculous it is of
[1009.88 - 1013.92] like okay you know what's happening in
[1011.40 - 1016.40] the body you know what the liver's doing
[1013.92 - 1018.56] you know what the kidneys are doing you
[1016.40 - 1020.00] know what the intestinal tract's doing
[1018.56 - 1021.60] and I love a lot of these guys they're
[1020.00 - 1023.80] just like oh yeah know the intestinal
[1021.60 - 1027.48] track's doing this oh how do you know
[1023.80 - 1029.12] how do you really know it's amazing so
[1027.48 - 1031.84] so when it comes down to Cleansing you
[1029.12 - 1034.80] have to look at the liver and you have
[1031.84 - 1037.48] to look at it with respect you have to
[1034.80 - 1041.16] not push it you have to not M you have
[1037.48 - 1043.60] to not push it over you can't you can't
[1041.16 - 1045.96] you know what happens is it's like the
[1043.60 - 1050.16] first time your child goes to a diving
[1045.96 - 1053.44] board in a poll and and and and wants to
[1050.16 - 1055.20] dive off and is standing there scared
[1053.44 - 1057.72] and it's like somebody coming behind her
[1055.20 - 1060.52] or him and just pushing her in in the
[1057.72 - 1062.68] water and it's it's just you can't push
[1060.52 - 1065.00] your liver to doing something you have
[1062.68 - 1066.92] to give it a chance you have to work
[1065.00 - 1067.92] with it gently and carefully cuz it will
[1066.92 - 1071.92] push
[1067.92 - 1073.76] back it will push back and you know and
[1071.92 - 1075.64] that that can happen just like if you
[1073.76 - 1077.56] push your son or your daughter off off
[1075.64 - 1079.56] the diving board too early in life when
[1077.56 - 1080.84] they're too young what they might push
[1079.56 - 1082.16] back and they might not want to do it
[1080.84 - 1083.60] again they might not want hot get on
[1082.16 - 1086.72] that diving board ever again you just
[1083.60 - 1088.84] don't even know so what happens is that
[1086.72 - 1091.60] the liver doesn't like to be pushed hard
[1088.84 - 1093.28] you got these people on on all these you
[1091.60 - 1095.96] know regular you know standard American
[1093.28 - 1097.48] diets of course and then you push them
[1095.96 - 1099.76] into these radical cleanses you sell
[1097.48 - 1101.16] them and then they waffle and they don't
[1099.76 - 1102.56] even know how to eat afterwards they
[1101.16 - 1104.60] just waffle in between they're still
[1102.56 - 1107.84] binging on Pizza still binging on their
[1104.60 - 1110.12] old their old patterns it's it's about
[1107.84 - 1112.68] gradually getting someone to cleanse and
[1110.12 - 1114.20] heal not pushing the liver overboard
[1112.68 - 1115.64] because you don't know what's in
[1114.20 - 1118.80] somebody's liver let me tell you
[1115.64 - 1120.64] something with Liver Rescue I I talk
[1118.80 - 1122.32] about it all in there whole section on
[1120.64 - 1125.72] what's a big section on what's in
[1122.32 - 1127.88] people's livers and it is vast it is
[1125.72 - 1130.00] absolutely vast you want to dump all
[1127.88 - 1132.64] that stuff out at once the liver will
[1130.00 - 1134.84] suck it all back in it'll suck it all
[1132.64 - 1136.32] back in you won't even get rid of it you
[1134.84 - 1138.80] dump it all out of the the bloodstream
[1136.32 - 1141.08] at once and the liver will bring it all
[1138.80 - 1143.48] back in to save your kidneys lives to
[1141.08 - 1147.04] save your kidneys Health to save your
[1143.48 - 1148.48] kidneys so you so you you want to you

[1150.68 - 1154.08] is lowering your fats one way of doing
[1152.48 - 1156.92] it to start with is getting on a clean
[1154.08 - 1158.44] diet if it's animal protein you love and
[1156.92 - 1159.88] that's the way you do it get on the
[1158.44 - 1160.84] cleanest animal protein diet you can

[1264.52 - 1267.20] know there's and I'm going to go into
[1265.80 - 1269.24] this for a little bit too it's where the
[1267.20 - 1271.56] vegans get picked on a vegan is not
[1269.24 - 1273.28] allowed to get sick there's even though
[1271.56 - 1274.60] there's this many vegans when a vegan is
[1273.28 - 1276.00] not allowed to get sick all the animal
[1274.60 - 1278.00] protein people are allowed to get sick
[1276.00 - 1279.76] they're all allowed to die in hospitals
[1278.00 - 1280.92] because they're just there's millions
[1279.76 - 1281.88] and millions and millions and millions
[1280.92 - 1283.24] of them there's nothing wrong with it
[1281.88 - 1285.24] it's just they're all all allowed to get
[1283.24 - 1287.20] sick you're allowed to get sick eating
[1285.24 - 1288.92] animal protein you're allowed to you
[1287.20 - 1291.00] don't get you don't get you don't get
[1288.92 - 1293.56] crushed by any any any propaganda or
[1291.00 - 1295.76] anybody but if you're vegan and you just
[1293.56 - 1299.36] get one cough you just cough
[1295.76 - 1301.68] once you cough once and and and the
[1299.36 - 1303.48] animal protein you know people not not
[1301.68 - 1305.52] the PE you not like people you know that
[1303.48 - 1306.80] are in I'm talking about the experts and
[1305.52 - 1308.56] other people in the field that are all
[1306.80 - 1310.20] part of the propaganda they'll just be
[1308.56 - 1311.88] like they'll want to C oh my God that
[1310.20 - 1313.32] vegan sick exactly there you go you're
[1311.88 - 1315.28] you're sick because you're on Plants
[1313.32 - 1316.32] you're sick because you're on Plants so
[1315.28 - 1317.04] there's the you know the vegans have
[1316.32 - 1320.16] been the
[1317.04 - 1322.76] underdog it hasn't been easy for them
[1320.16 - 1326.92] but the deal is the deal is on both
[1322.76 - 1329.24] sides of the aisle okay you lower the
[1326.92 - 1331.72] fats and then you start to cleanse and
[1329.24 - 1333.64] you prepare your body how many overt
[1331.72 - 1335.80] fats did I have I was back to chicken
[1333.64 - 1337.40] chicken high in fat I don't care who
[1335.80 - 1339.04] what where I don't care what scale you
[1337.40 - 1341.52] can hop on the internet how much fat is
[1339.04 - 1344.36] in 4 ounces of chicken breast and it'll
[1341.52 - 1346.52] lie to you because those are government
[1344.36 - 1348.80] standards of how much fat is in a piece
[1346.52 - 1350.80] of chicken every Farm is different every
[1348.80 - 1353.12] chicken is different one chicken could
[1350.80 - 1356.52] have three times more fat than another
[1353.12 - 1358.16] chicken how can a standard be written in
[1356.52 - 1359.60] how can they have a standard that's
[1358.16 - 1363.08] utterly
[1359.60 - 1367.96] insane every tree is different some
[1363.08 - 1370.68] trees I I've had nut trees in my life my
[1367.96 - 1373.24] great-grandfather had nut trees I
[1370.68 - 1376.12] remember one walnut tree being so high
[1373.24 - 1379.04] in fat it was insane it was like eating
[1376.12 - 1382.48] a buttered it was like eating a buttered
[1379.04 - 1386.08] croissant and then his other walnut tree
[1382.48 - 1387.96] a different variety and it was and um
[1386.08 - 1390.60] you know a different variety it had
[1387.96 - 1392.88] hardly any fat it was like it was like
[1390.60 - 1397.08] it was like fat free almost and then
[1392.88 - 1398.72] there was this other peacan tree he had
[1397.08 - 1401.48] which was grown it was grown on a
[1398.72 - 1403.68] different part of the farm little farm
[1401.48 - 1405.84] there on his property and you I remember
[1403.68 - 1408.88] my great-grandfather and that peacan
[1405.84 - 1412.96] tree it was like it was really rich and
[1408.88 - 1414.88] then at my aunt's house her peacan tree
[1412.96 - 1417.96] same kind of pean grown on different
[1414.88 - 1420.56] soil at her house it had it was like low
[1417.96 - 1423.36] fat barely any fat probably cut in half
[1420.56 - 1425.16] to a quarter how is it possible to just
[1423.36 - 1426.84] say oh how much Fat's in nuts here put
[1425.16 - 1429.68] it on dial it in the computer how much
[1426.84 - 1431.92] Fat's in this chicken every single Farm
[1429.68 - 1434.00] is a the chicken has a different racial
[1431.92 - 1436.20] fat and some of them are so high in fat
[1434.00 - 1438.16] it's insane I don't care if it's if it's
[1436.20 - 1441.36] pasture Ray free range it could be be
[1438.16 - 1443.72] really high in fat the same thing with
[1441.36 - 1445.52] any kind of animal product so what
[1443.72 - 1447.20] happens is that you got to bring your
[1445.52 - 1448.80] animal products down a little bit and
[1447.20 - 1450.12] you start to cleanse you don't have to
[1448.80 - 1453.84] stop them all together if you love
[1450.12 - 1455.32] animal protein and then if you're vegan
[1453.84 - 1458.20] you got to bring your nuts and seeds
[1455.32 - 1459.96] down you see listen I'm working for you

[1480.64 - 1486.56] to me just have the book so you can heal
[1483.20 - 1488.36] and what happens is is that you know
[1486.56 - 1490.72] when we lower these fats we start to
[1488.36 - 1492.64] cleanse we start to heal we lower these
[1490.72 - 1495.92] fats we start to cleanse we start to
[1492.64 - 1499.00] heal and what happens is you cleanse you
[1495.92 - 1501.96] detox you prepare your yourself your
[1499.00 - 1505.12] body gets into a rhythm it finds a
[1501.96 - 1508.24] rhythm so that you don't get sick when
[1505.12 - 1510.44] you do something more radical and you'll
[1508.24 - 1512.80] know if it's a detox or not do you see
[1510.44 - 1515.68] where I'm going this is so important
[1512.80 - 1519.04] this is where I'm heading then you can
[1515.68 - 1520.80] see right there what's going on I'm
[1519.04 - 1522.84] trying to teach you how to read your own
[1520.80 - 1525.76] body and give you information in order
[1522.84 - 1528.84] for you to do it so you can be in a good
[1525.76 - 1530.68] place and that's what I'm trying to do
[1528.84 - 1533.08] so you can be in a good place so you
[1530.68 - 1535.32] could read your own body so when you
[1533.08 - 1537.16] lower your fats and you're a plant-based
[1535.32 - 1538.96] uh you know girl or guy and you're
[1537.16 - 1540.20] plant-based and you start bringing down
[1538.96 - 1541.36] nuts and seeds and the oils you start
[1540.20 - 1542.84] bringing down the avocado and you get
[1541.36 - 1544.44] more lower fat more lower fat when
[1542.84 - 1546.56] you're animal protein you have your
[1544.44 - 1548.52] chicken once a day you have you know a
[1546.56 - 1550.32] little piece of uh grassed beef once a
[1548.52 - 1552.68] day then once every other day same thing
[1550.32 - 1555.04] with the plant plant-based have avocado
[1552.68 - 1557.36] every other day bring in more fruits and
[1555.04 - 1559.48] vegetables cuz guess what cleanses us
[1557.36 - 1561.44] guess what cleanses us it's not chicken
[1559.48 - 1563.40] and meat chicken and meat don't cleanse
[1561.44 - 1566.08] us and I have nothing against chicken
[1563.40 - 1570.00] and meat chicken and meat don't cleanse
[1566.08 - 1573.96] us guess what walnuts don't cleanse us
[1570.00 - 1575.28] guess what um olives don't cleanse us
[1573.96 - 1579.04] and guess
[1575.28 - 1582.76] what okay uh almonds
[1579.04 - 1586.12] cashews macademia nuts don't cleanse us
[1582.76 - 1589.40] olive oil doesn't cleanse us it doesn't
[1586.12 - 1592.08] it doesn't allow Det toxin
[1589.40 - 1595.32] cleansing it doesn't cheese doesn't
[1592.08 - 1597.24] cleanse us grass-fed beef butter will
[1595.32 - 1600.24] definitely not cleanse you that'll shut
[1597.24 - 1602.68] down a cleanse in 10 seconds
[1600.24 - 1604.84] flat that'll shut down sorry about
[1602.68 - 1607.12] laughing there grass-fed beef butter I
[1604.84 - 1608.92] mean grass-fed butter will literally
[1607.12 - 1610.40] shut down a cleanse in 10 seconds you
[1608.92 - 1611.96] want to shut down your cleanse you want
[1610.40 - 1614.84] you want to stop cleansing eat butter
[1611.96 - 1616.28] every day eat butter you put put butter
[1614.84 - 1619.36] in your coffee if you want to never
[1616.28 - 1620.68] cleanse ever
[1619.36 - 1623.56] you can't know butter is not going to
[1620.68 - 1626.24] let you cleanse I'm just saying okay so
[1623.56 - 1628.80] the deal is is when you bring down these
[1626.24 - 1631.72] fats you're cleansing on a deeper level
[1628.80 - 1633.76] and you're getting your body ready ready
[1631.72 - 1635.16] so when you buy into something and
[1633.76 - 1637.68] hopefully you don't buy into something
[1635.16 - 1640.32] that's not good like be cautious with
[1637.68 - 1643.24] all the powders meaning buy into cleanse
[1640.32 - 1644.88] like cleansing powder programs and and
[1643.24 - 1647.72] all these powders you put in smoothies
[1644.88 - 1650.08] or put in water and just be really
[1647.72 - 1651.68] really cautious with all of that garbage
[1650.08 - 1653.00] you'll find natural flavors in that
[1651.68 - 1654.56] stuff and the ones you don't find
[1653.00 - 1656.44] natural flavors there probably glutamic
[1654.56 - 1658.56] acid naturally in there I mean there's
[1656.44 - 1660.64] all kinds of things are thrown in there
[1658.56 - 1662.80] it you just got to be careful and the
[1660.64 - 1664.04] Linings of the gut and intestinal tract
[1662.80 - 1666.24] small intestinal track the stomach
[1664.04 - 1669.08] lining everything gets so irritated and
[1666.24 - 1670.76] earable from all that all those powders
[1669.08 - 1674.00] and garbage and even alcohol supplements
[1670.76 - 1676.96] all going in there and in the name of
[1674.00 - 1679.60] cleansing you and meanwhile it could
[1676.96 - 1681.32] activates something it could activate
[1679.60 - 1683.68] something it could activate a viral
[1681.32 - 1686.40] issue by dropping down your immune
[1683.68 - 1688.16] system and you could be sick throughout
[1686.40 - 1689.80] your cleanse and detox and your
[1688.16 - 1691.92] cleansing teacher will be like oh you're
[1689.80 - 1693.76] just detoxing oh you're detoxing oh
[1691.92 - 1695.52] you're that sick oh you're just detoxing
[1693.76 - 1697.68] you can't move you're just laying around
[1695.52 - 1699.96] in bed you're you're
[1697.68 - 1702.08] detoxing you know and you know oh you
[1699.96 - 1704.20] got a rash that popped out oh that
[1702.08 - 1706.12] that's detoxing that's not cuz you just
[1704.20 - 1707.96] ignited your shingles virus that's
[1706.12 - 1710.08] detoxing I mean CU they don't know what
[1707.96 - 1712.04] the hell's going on they don't I'm just
[1710.08 - 1714.68] be honest I'm be I'm going to be
[1712.04 - 1718.28] straight out I don't know what's going
[1714.68 - 1721.24] on I know this seen it done this seen it
[1718.28 - 1723.96] heard it all of it whatever been there
[1721.24 - 1725.92] done that you name it seen it all seen
[1723.96 - 1729.28] it all out there in the world that's
[1725.92 - 1732.04] what I mean and so the thing is is that
[1729.28 - 1734.20] all these years at Spirit and I it's
[1732.04 - 1738.16] been about making sure you safely do
[1734.20 - 1742.24] things so that when you do get a sign
[1738.16 - 1745.76] that you can navigate you can actually
[1742.24 - 1747.32] navigate and know where you're going you
[1745.76 - 1749.04] know there's a ship captain that used to
[1747.32 - 1752.08] be a client of mine years
[1749.04 - 1753.68] ago and and he you know what he said to
[1752.08 - 1755.40] me he said you know the thing about you
[1753.68 - 1756.88] is you've been able to help me with my
[1755.40 - 1759.28] health for one reason when no one else
[1756.88 - 1761.04] could I said why what you you give me
[1759.28 - 1762.24] the tools like what's on my ship so I
[1761.04 - 1764.08] could see where I'm going so I can
[1762.24 - 1766.20] navigate and know where I'm going you
[1764.08 - 1767.68] give me the maps you give me the tools
[1766.20 - 1770.68] you give me the compass you give me
[1767.68 - 1773.44] everything so I can so I can you know so
[1770.68 - 1775.64] I can float my boat and send and move
[1773.44 - 1777.84] that ship so I could you know so I could
[1775.64 - 1780.20] do what I need to do so I could work you
[1777.84 - 1782.76] know and the thing is is that made a lot
[1780.20 - 1784.08] of sense to me and he and he said to me
[1782.76 - 1785.48] he said because I've been through all
[1784.08 - 1786.60] these other things and I've tried these
[1785.48 - 1789.04] different things and programs and
[1786.60 - 1791.96] different concepts and they give you all
[1789.04 - 1793.52] this stuff they tell you this but it's
[1791.96 - 1794.68] but it's not really what's happening and
[1793.52 - 1796.72] you lose all
[1794.68 - 1799.12] navigation and the thing I want you guys
[1796.72 - 1801.72] to be able to navigate I want you be
[1799.12 - 1804.04] able to kind of be able to find your way
[1801.72 - 1807.52] through and so when you lower the fats
[1804.04 - 1810.44] it's the first first it's a first big
[1807.52 - 1813.44] step after the second big step is no no
[1810.44 - 1816.52] junk food you know no pizzas no cakes
[1813.44 - 1819.60] cookies donuts no Bagels no gluten no
[1816.52 - 1820.80] cheese no eggs and then you you drop you
[1819.60 - 1822.80] know I don't care if you you know
[1820.80 - 1824.48] whatever diet you're on high protein get
[1822.80 - 1826.36] rid of the eggs and cheese vegetarian
[1824.48 - 1828.60] get rid of the eggs and cheese vegans
[1826.36 - 1831.08] already got the EGS and chees she's gone
[1828.60 - 1832.76] and then then you're in a you're in a
[1831.08 - 1834.32] better place and then you're doing the
[1832.76 - 1835.96] low fat you're bringing the low fats
[1834.32 - 1837.64] down and you're getting ready so if you
[1835.96 - 1839.88] want to do a cleanse like the medical
[1837.64 - 1842.80] medium 28-day
[1839.88 - 1845.96] cleanse man you're actually already
[1842.80 - 1849.40] there and you will be detoxing you will
[1845.96 - 1852.60] be cleansing gently without making
[1849.40 - 1854.52] yourself sick pushing your liver too far
[1852.60 - 1856.88] the problem is when you do radical
[1854.52 - 1858.04] cleansing and you jump into it your
[1856.88 - 1861.16] liver
[1858.04 - 1863.64] expels all this poison but it has to
[1861.16 - 1866.28] bring it back up meaning like the liver
[1863.64 - 1867.92] will take it back in it's not like the
[1866.28 - 1870.72] liver the liver will literally bring it
[1867.92 - 1872.48] back in to protect you and then it'll
[1870.72 - 1874.72] learn it shouldn't let anything out
[1872.48 - 1877.44] anymore so you'll be on like your 10th
[1874.72 - 1879.68] day of a radical cleanse and your liver
[1877.44 - 1882.36] is going to shut down it's going to be
[1879.68 - 1884.16] like I already excreted poison was
[1882.36 - 1886.72] pushed into it forced into excreting
[1884.16 - 1890.16] poison now I have to absorb all that
[1886.72 - 1892.12] poison back then I'm now going to shut
[1890.16 - 1894.60] I'm going to shut up I'm going to shut
[1892.12 - 1896.20] it down I'm going to I'm going to that's
[1894.60 - 1898.28] it and your liver is just going to like
[1896.20 - 1899.52] back off and you're on your 10th 11th
[1898.28 - 1901.28] 12th day and your liver's like I'm not
[1899.52 - 1902.92] letting out a single poison because it's
[1901.28 - 1904.44] just going to hurt the person cuz a
[1902.92 - 1906.44] liver has that ability I talk about it
[1904.44 - 1908.64] in Liver Rescue of how it
[1906.44 - 1909.88] works and so if you if you haven't got a
[1908.64 - 1912.16] copy of Liver Rescue yet go to the
[1909.88 - 1913.60] library whatever go to the go to Amazon
[1912.16 - 1916.88] get a copy of Liver Rescue whatever you
[1913.60 - 1919.28] got to do but you you should have it and
[1916.88 - 1920.76] here's here's the deal you could do some
[1919.28 - 1922.48] radical cleansing but you got to get
[1920.76 - 1924.00] yourself prepared and get yourself ready
[1922.48 - 1925.72] and you have to get yourself to a place
[1924.00 - 1928.00] where you're you're respecting your body
[1925.72 - 1929.52] respecting your liver and you're not
[1928.00 - 1932.80] dumping too much junk in there while
[1929.52 - 1936.20] you're doing it juices are a great
[1932.80 - 1939.60] cleansing tool all the crazy
[1936.20 - 1940.76] powders that cleansing programs sell I
[1939.60 - 1943.32] would
[1940.76 - 1945.80] ignore because you'll never know if you
[1943.32 - 1948.48] made yourself sick or if you're
[1945.80 - 1952.32] cleansing or detoxing
[1948.48 - 1954.68] you'll never know you'll never ever ever
[1952.32 - 1956.36] ever know I'm telling you right now
[1954.68 - 1958.92] especially in the powers have like 10
[1956.36 - 1961.24] things in them 20 things in them 30
[1958.92 - 1963.72] things in them you think you're going to
[1961.24 - 1965.44] know what's making you sick versus
[1963.72 - 1967.00] what's detoxing you and so forth or
[1965.44 - 1969.24] irritating or scratching your lining or
[1967.00 - 1972.88] whatever it is or overburdening
[1969.24 - 1973.68] something you just you don't know so all
[1972.88 - 1976.60] the
[1973.68 - 1977.72] powders they all have to go when you're
[1976.60 - 1979.24] actually doing doing something more
[1977.72 - 1981.36] radical a cleanse like you're doing a
[1979.24 - 1985.88] juice cleanse or something else they
[1981.36 - 1986.96] have to go it's important to know and so
[1985.88 - 1987.92] you know and another thing too if you're
[1986.96 - 1990.16] going to do any kind of radical
[1987.92 - 1993.48] cleansing don't run around doing errands
[1990.16 - 1994.96] all day don't have life going about like
[1993.48 - 1996.84] crazy and you're running around and
[1994.96 - 1998.52] you're doing all these things and you
[1996.84 - 2000.68] don't don't I wouldn't do that I would
[1998.52 - 2003.76] try to like plan on some downtime some
[2000.68 - 2005.72] chill time and if you can't do that I
[2003.76 - 2007.52] understand but I would try to have some
[2005.72 - 2010.48] downtime some chill
[2007.52 - 2012.88] time and and and expect to keep it
[2010.48 - 2014.60] lowkey even if it's a 10-day cleanse
[2012.88 - 2016.56] 5-day cleanse 5day juice cleanse
[2014.60 - 2020.20] whatever 7 7-Day juice cleanser whatever
[2016.56 - 2021.76] it is you got to back down your schedule
[2020.20 - 2023.84] itinerary you have to just kind of like
[2021.76 - 2025.68] okay let's just calm down let's not run
[2023.84 - 2027.12] around like a mad person let's not try
[2025.68 - 2028.68] to do all these things because that's
[2027.12 - 2031.52] not good because your
[2028.68 - 2033.56] detox will be different cuz your body
[2031.52 - 2037.64] will know you're actually exhausting
[2033.56 - 2039.68] itself so it will hold back its poisons
[2037.64 - 2042.72] you'll actually hinder your detox if
[2039.68 - 2045.92] you're doing too much while you're
[2042.72 - 2049.36] detoxing while you're
[2045.92 - 2052.40] detoxing so here's the deal like the
[2049.36 - 2056.32] medical medium 20day 28 28 day cleanse
[2052.40 - 2059.40] is one way you can cleanse safely and
[2056.32 - 2061.48] you can do it longer term and sustain
[2059.40 - 2065.12] yourself so you can
[2061.48 - 2067.88] actually uh ignite healing okay that's
[2065.12 - 2069.00] one way of doing it you know I have I
[2067.88 - 2073.16] have a
[2069.00 - 2074.32] 90day 90-day thyroid okay thyroid detox
[2073.16 - 2076.24] and thyroid cleans and heal and
[2074.32 - 2079.96] everything else and thyroid healing but
[2076.24 - 2082.56] Liver Rescue has a 9-day cleanse for the
[2079.96 - 2084.20] liver and it's and it's going to involve
[2082.56 - 2087.44] some food and it's going to involve some
[2084.20 - 2090.36] juices and the thing is is that that's
[2087.44 - 2092.80] the healthier ways of doing it it's
[2090.36 - 2094.44] about working for your body you working
[2092.80 - 2095.92] for your body treating your body with
[2094.44 - 2097.44] kindness so let's talk about symptoms
[2095.92 - 2101.16] and signs and everything
[2097.44 - 2104.68] else okay so you went from processed
[2101.16 - 2106.76] foods to eating clean you went to
[2104.68 - 2108.24] processed foods and junk foods and pizza
[2106.76 - 2109.76] and everything else and cheese and
[2108.24 - 2111.80] butter and fried foods you went from
[2109.76 - 2114.32] that to a clean paleo clean protein
[2111.80 - 2116.28] clean vegan diet whatever it is you went
[2114.32 - 2117.44] from that to there you might get a funny
[2116.28 - 2121.08] taste in your
[2117.44 - 2123.40] mouth you might get a very mild headache
[2121.08 - 2126.20] at first you might start feeling
[2123.40 - 2129.84] Sensations like that you might start
[2126.20 - 2132.44] sleeping better you might start sleeping
[2129.84 - 2134.64] worse these are all little signs then
[2132.44 - 2137.08] they subside then when you start lower
[2134.64 - 2138.68] your fats whether it's high protein um
[2137.08 - 2140.40] you know high protein diet or the vegan
[2138.68 - 2141.44] diet you start lowering your fats so
[2140.40 - 2142.52] you're eating clean but you start
[2141.44 - 2144.24] lowering your fats and bringing in more
[2142.52 - 2146.32] leafy greens and a little bit more green
[2144.24 - 2148.44] juice so you know that's what you're
[2146.32 - 2149.88] doing now that's what people do now
[2148.44 - 2151.56] that's not what people do but you lower
[2149.88 - 2153.76] your fats that's what you need to do
[2151.56 - 2157.56] that's what I mean you lower your fats
[2153.76 - 2160.40] bring in more fruits more greens um more
[2157.56 - 2162.28] juices and that's what you're doing and
[2160.40 - 2164.12] you're going to get bad taste in your
[2162.28 - 2165.20] mouth you're going to get a little
[2164.12 - 2166.64] cranky you're going to get a little
[2165.20 - 2168.16] irritable but you're also going to feel
[2166.64 - 2169.68] a lot better you're going to have days
[2168.16 - 2172.28] where you're feeling kind of like you've
[2169.68 - 2174.80] taste some metal in your mouth you taste
[2172.28 - 2176.56] funny you know it's different things
[2174.80 - 2179.56] your eyes might be
[2176.56 - 2181.04] tearing more you might you might have
[2179.56 - 2182.64] sleep disturbances it could be up and
[2181.04 - 2184.64] down left and right you might be
[2182.64 - 2187.28] sleeping better you might be sleeping a
[2184.64 - 2188.72] little worse for a night you might be
[2187.28 - 2191.60] getting a little couple a little bit of
[2188.72 - 2193.28] spasms in the body when you're sleeping
[2191.60 - 2195.88] that your you know may be a leg cramp
[2193.28 - 2197.80] here and there because toxins are being
[2195.88 - 2201.08] released but you're going to be feeling
[2197.80 - 2202.80] better and stronger and better if you're
[2201.08 - 2204.24] eating enough too I mean if you're not
[2202.80 - 2207.72] eating anything that's a whole another
[2204.24 - 2209.56] story but these are all some symptoms so
[2207.72 - 2211.44] you're going to just you know like that
[2209.56 - 2213.92] you might actually when you lower your
[2211.44 - 2215.56] fats your avocados nuts and seeds oils
[2213.92 - 2216.88] you lower your chicken your meat down a
[2215.56 - 2219.56] little notot you lower your fish fish
[2216.88 - 2220.68] whatever it is and you lower all of that
[2219.56 - 2222.24] all of a sudden you're going to
[2220.68 - 2224.12] bathroom's going to be different you
[2222.24 - 2226.20] might get a couple days of some loose
[2224.12 - 2228.16] stools you might get a couple of days
[2226.20 - 2230.36] where you get you might get one day of
[2228.16 - 2232.72] diarrhea you might get one where it's
[2230.36 - 2235.52] just it's runny stools just you might
[2232.72 - 2237.36] get one day like that you might get a
[2235.52 - 2238.76] little bloating for a moment little
[2237.36 - 2240.12] bloating and cramping but you might be
[2238.76 - 2241.80] experiencing all these things before you
[2240.12 - 2244.00] even went into any of this but these are
[2241.80 - 2247.48] some signs of of detox right here and
[2244.00 - 2248.44] you can be experiencing it with problems
[2247.48 - 2249.80] you have with your liver and your
[2248.44 - 2251.64] intestinal tract before going into
[2249.80 - 2254.00] cleanses and then you can experience the
[2251.64 - 2256.28] same thing while you're
[2254.00 - 2257.76] detoxing and so these are these are all
[2256.28 - 2259.28] things but yet you're getting increased
[2257.76 - 2262.16] energy you're feeling better you're
[2259.28 - 2264.96] doing it right you're lowering your fats
[2262.16 - 2268.44] and then you can take your fats out all
[2264.96 - 2270.16] together you're 100% fat free 100% fat
[2268.44 - 2273.48] free which
[2270.16 - 2275.12] means if you're paleo if you're high
[2273.48 - 2276.80] protein you're off animal protein for a
[2275.12 - 2279.68] little while so now you're in like a
[2276.80 - 2282.04] real cleanse you're in a real cleanse
[2279.68 - 2283.52] now cuz you can't cleanse you can't
[2282.04 - 2284.76] really cleanse deeper if you're on
[2283.52 - 2285.72] chicken and meat I'm saying there's
[2284.76 - 2287.56] nothing wrong with eating chicken or
[2285.72 - 2289.36] meat but you're really you're not going
[2287.56 - 2291.24] to be able to cleanse like really
[2289.36 - 2292.60] cleanse on a deeper level and if you're
[2291.24 - 2295.68] vegan you're not going to be able to
[2292.60 - 2298.48] really cleanse at all on nuts and seeds
[2295.68 - 2302.04] cuz the nuts and seeds are the chicken
[2298.48 - 2304.40] and the meat you see how it works the
[2302.04 - 2307.52] nut seeds are the chicken the meat the
[2304.40 - 2310.60] fish that's how it is for the pale a
[2307.52 - 2312.32] guy and so once you take out those fats
[2310.60 - 2313.68] you're now cleansing on a deeper level
[2312.32 - 2315.36] now you're fat free for a while you can
[2313.68 - 2317.32] be fat free for a week you fat free for
[2315.36 - 2319.00] 2 weeks and guess what the 28 day
[2317.32 - 2322.16] cleanse medical medium book one that's
[2319.00 - 2324.48] fat free for 28 days and that's a
[2322.16 - 2326.52] cleanse in fact it is a deep cleanse
[2324.48 - 2328.60] that doesn't make you sick you can get
[2326.52 - 2330.80] some symptoms little cleansing and
[2328.60 - 2332.92] detoxing
[2330.80 - 2335.76] symptoms and if you don't follow that
[2332.92 - 2337.24] 28-day cleanse you can just be fat free
[2335.76 - 2339.16] and just bring bring in lots of fruits
[2337.24 - 2340.04] and vegetables bring in lots of fruits
[2339.16 - 2343.92] and
[2340.04 - 2345.76] vegetables okay and juices but stay fat
[2343.92 - 2347.32] free can even bring in some steamed
[2345.76 - 2348.84] potatoes if you want and some steamed
[2347.32 - 2350.88] winter squash and some steamed
[2348.84 - 2354.08] vegetables and if you're raw vegan then
[2350.88 - 2358.00] lots of fruits and leafy greens and some
[2354.08 - 2361.32] juices and and what you do is you're now
[2358.00 - 2363.76] no fat no overt fat and now you're
[2361.32 - 2365.76] cleansing now you're cleansing if you
[2363.76 - 2367.52] can handle that for a week if you can
[2365.76 - 2370.28] handle that for 2 weeks if you can
[2367.52 - 2372.40] handle that for 3 weeks or 4 weeks then
[2370.28 - 2374.64] you can handle something more radical
[2372.40 - 2376.20] you can actually handle an actual
[2374.64 - 2378.48] cleanse in a deeper level there's
[2376.20 - 2383.32] nothing worse than going from you know
[2378.48 - 2385.00] point A to point Z literally by not you
[2383.32 - 2386.32] know that's like shocking the body and
[2385.00 - 2388.36] the reason why I'm going into this part
[2386.32 - 2389.80] of the of this radio show is when you
[2388.36 - 2391.76] shock the body you know what happens
[2389.80 - 2395.00] your immune system drops and
[2391.76 - 2397.36] crashes your immune system
[2395.00 - 2398.76] crashes that's what happens and a lot of
[2397.36 - 2400.36] people who have to cleanse and do things
[2398.76 - 2402.32] and everything they're already sick they
[2400.36 - 2403.60] already got Epstein bar they already got
[2402.32 - 2404.92] aches and pains they already got tingles
[2403.60 - 2407.00] and numbness they already got problems
[2404.92 - 2409.40] bloating cramping in their gut Crohn's
[2407.00 - 2410.88] colitis they already got IBS they
[2409.40 - 2412.60] already got glut gluten problems
[2410.88 - 2414.24] methylation issues and everything else
[2412.60 - 2416.52] under under the sun they already have
[2414.24 - 2418.52] all these things headaches migraines
[2416.52 - 2419.92] balance issues weaknesses they already
[2418.52 - 2422.16] have all
[2419.92 - 2423.60] that and so when you're already having
[2422.16 - 2426.56] all that and it's already viral and
[2423.60 - 2428.40] everything else Under the Sun and you
[2426.56 - 2431.04] from point A to point Z really quick and
[2428.40 - 2432.48] you go radical you shock your body you
[2431.04 - 2433.80] drop your immune system more and you can
[2432.48 - 2435.56] get a reignition of the shingles
[2433.80 - 2437.28] reignition of neck pain jaw pain
[2435.56 - 2440.24] reignition of back pain reignition of
[2437.28 - 2442.28] knee pain reignition of everything brain
[2440.24 - 2443.64] fog you name it and be like wait a
[2442.28 - 2445.28] minute and someone could be telling you
[2443.64 - 2446.64] you're detoxing you're detoxing this is
[2445.28 - 2447.88] what it is cuz someone didn't even know
[2446.64 - 2449.24] what the heck is even wrong with you
[2447.88 - 2451.36] didn't even know you're viral and you're
[2449.24 - 2452.76] sick and you got things that you need to
[2451.36 - 2454.16] heal you've been sick for years they
[2452.76 - 2455.56] just think you're' just been toxic
[2454.16 - 2456.96] there's a lot of detox Specialists are
[2455.56 - 2459.36] like Oh no you're just toxic they don't
[2456.96 - 2460.56] even know the person has a viral issue
[2459.36 - 2462.36] they have no
[2460.56 - 2465.00] idea and
[2462.36 - 2466.80] so and they might be spouting out
[2465.00 - 2469.36] viruses now because of what we did at
[2466.80 - 2470.92] Medical medium of of teaching the world
[2469.36 - 2473.40] right now about how viruses work and why
[2470.92 - 2476.24] everybody's sick but but the thing is
[2473.40 - 2478.12] you just don't even know and then you're
[2476.24 - 2480.00] kind of like in cahoots you're you're
[2478.12 - 2481.96] you're you're reignited your immune
[2480.00 - 2485.24] system is is is locked down and shut
[2481.96 - 2487.00] down you reignited a a viral issue now
[2485.24 - 2489.00] you're trying to recoup from your your
[2487.00 - 2491.92] healer is saying no you're detoxing
[2489.00 - 2494.64] detoxing detoxing that happens all the
[2491.92 - 2496.32] time but when you do it the right way
[2494.64 - 2497.84] your immune system stays strong your
[2496.32 - 2500.00] body won't be
[2497.84 - 2502.08] shocked that's why like the 28 day
[2500.00 - 2506.64] cleanse in medical medium book one or
[2502.08 - 2510.44] 90-day thy thyroid rehab or or the um or
[2506.64 - 2513.04] The Liver Rescue The Liver Rescue 369
[2510.44 - 2516.76] you guys will see the deal is is
[2513.04 - 2518.52] that is the bottom line is
[2516.76 - 2519.96] you got to treat your body with respects
[2518.52 - 2521.32] it'll treat you back with respect
[2519.96 - 2523.96] because you got to remember we're the
[2521.32 - 2525.88] ones not entirely our fault but it's
[2523.96 - 2528.76] part of our fault about dirtying up our
[2525.88 - 2531.56] bodies it's partly our fault it's not
[2528.76 - 2534.04] all of our fault the rest is the fact
[2531.56 - 2536.48] that the world is that toxic and we come
[2534.04 - 2539.12] into this world as a baby already with
[2536.48 - 2541.20] toxins in our liver in our body it's has
[2539.12 - 2542.80] nothing to do with us and then there's
[2541.20 - 2544.76] this one little part that has something
[2542.80 - 2546.92] to do with us but it's really not
[2544.76 - 2549.48] entirely our fault just a fraction of it
[2546.92 - 2551.16] is because you know we we kind we tend
[2549.48 - 2552.80] to know better now in this day and age
[2551.16 - 2554.76] not to eat that buttered croissant but
[2552.80 - 2556.12] we do it anyway but it's really I get it
[2554.76 - 2557.76] we're under stress we're under pressure
[2556.12 - 2559.40] we're just we're in survival mode we
[2557.76 - 2562.28] just eat what we need to eat and I get
[2559.40 - 2565.28] it you know it's probably not you know
[2562.28 - 2567.80] exactly but the thing is that we still
[2565.28 - 2570.28] there's some responsibility that we have
[2567.80 - 2571.84] is what I mean and we can't push we
[2570.28 - 2573.44] can't push the liver in the other parts
[2571.84 - 2575.04] of the body we got to be really careful
[2573.44 - 2577.00] so when you do the fat free you're
[2575.04 - 2579.40] already preparing yourself if you can do
[2577.00 - 2580.84] fat free for 3 Days whether you're
[2579.40 - 2582.56] somebody who's high protein Paley or
[2580.84 - 2585.40] you're somebody who's vegan if you can
[2582.56 - 2587.92] do fat free for 3 to 4 days what a great
[2585.40 - 2589.88] place that puts you in incredible you'll
[2587.92 - 2591.36] be detoxing and cleansing you might get
[2589.88 - 2592.84] and if you're really toxic here's
[2591.36 - 2594.00] another thing everybody's body is filled
[2592.84 - 2595.16] with something different some people's
[2594.00 - 2597.00] bodies are filled with tons of
[2595.16 - 2600.16] pharmaceuticals some people's bodies are
[2597.00 - 2603.08] filled with DDT DDT I swear to God I kid
[2600.16 - 2606.24] you not DDT from literally their
[2603.08 - 2607.56] forefathers I it's unbelievable some
[2606.24 - 2608.64] people are filled with Mercury some
[2607.56 - 2610.20] people are filled with all kinds of
[2608.64 - 2611.60] different Metals it's unbelievable some
[2610.20 - 2613.08] people have lots of virus a lot of
[2611.60 - 2616.24] people everybody's got a viral issue
[2613.08 - 2617.52] somewhere in there it was one or another
[2616.24 - 2619.40] and we got all these different things
[2617.52 - 2622.52] going on inside of us and some people
[2619.40 - 2624.64] much more some people much less so
[2622.52 - 2626.52] somebody doing fat free for seven days
[2624.64 - 2627.84] it's a big deal for them cleanse and at
[2626.52 - 2629.64] least keep their immune system strong
[2627.84 - 2634.04] and cleanse and and thank God they don't
[2629.64 - 2636.08] go radical someone else somebody else
[2634.04 - 2637.88] you know who's really really yeah who's
[2636.08 - 2638.80] who's not as toxic or more toxic
[2637.88 - 2640.52] whatever it's going to have a different
[2638.80 - 2643.36] thing they when they're doing the 7-Day
[2640.52 - 2646.68] or 5day or 3-day low fat but it's a
[2643.36 - 2650.04] great way to get you in a place to
[2646.68 - 2652.64] protect you it's a great way it's a
[2650.04 - 2655.16] great it's a great scale to kind of come
[2652.64 - 2657.56] down on a cliff to come down carefully
[2655.16 - 2659.20] on so you're protected you protect you
[2657.56 - 2662.28] that's the whole point with cleanses so
[2659.20 - 2664.84] you can do more radical if you can do
[2662.28 - 2666.84] fat free whatever aisle you're on in
[2664.84 - 2668.92] food belief system and bring in more
[2666.84 - 2670.72] fruits and vegetables and do smoothies
[2668.92 - 2672.76] and everything else you're going to be
[2670.72 - 2674.76] in a lot better place you're cleansing
[2672.76 - 2677.12] already and you're not going to kill
[2674.76 - 2679.12] your immune system for a while you're
[2677.12 - 2681.28] not going to drop it you're not going to
[2679.12 - 2683.88] kick the crap out of your immune system
[2681.28 - 2685.56] so that whatever's lurking doesn't come
[2683.88 - 2687.44] raging out and that's the difference
[2685.56 - 2689.52] between that's what happens is all these
[2687.44 - 2691.44] detoxes out there and you get sick
[2689.52 - 2693.48] people doing them and they go through
[2691.44 - 2695.40] hell and back partly because they're
[2693.48 - 2697.40] filled with all these irritating powders
[2695.40 - 2699.36] in their gut but lining and it's just
[2697.40 - 2701.24] making them absolutely miserable the
[2699.36 - 2703.04] other part is it totally annihilates
[2701.24 - 2704.72] their immune system so that their
[2703.04 - 2707.20] viruses whatever made them sick for the
[2704.72 - 2709.20] last 20 years is coming out full force
[2707.20 - 2710.88] then when you start recovering from all
[2709.20 - 2712.80] that it's like a relief cuz you've just
[2710.88 - 2714.08] been through Hing back you may not even
[2712.80 - 2715.84] be better than you were before you
[2714.08 - 2717.72] started but you feel like you're
[2715.84 - 2719.60] recovering thank God so then you're like
[2717.72 - 2721.24] oh yeah I went through the biggest detox
[2719.60 - 2722.72] of my life and you're just back to
[2721.24 - 2724.60] square one from when you started I've
[2722.72 - 2727.68] seen that happen guess what thousands of
[2724.60 - 2730.08] times over the years and you don't want
[2727.68 - 2732.76] it to happen that way you want to know
[2730.08 - 2734.60] if you're really sick if you really got
[2732.76 - 2737.20] sick in your detox you want to know it's
[2734.60 - 2740.56] a real detox
[2737.20 - 2742.36] happening so that means you do the low
[2740.56 - 2743.56] fat for a while or you do the 28 day
[2742.36 - 2744.84] cleanse and if you want to go to
[2743.56 - 2747.36] something more radical and you want to
[2744.84 - 2750.08] do juices only all day
[2747.36 - 2752.00] long and you can you do juices on a
[2750.08 - 2754.00] juice fast we're doing juice and water
[2752.00 - 2756.92] every day juice or lemon water and then
[2754.00 - 2758.72] juices cucumber juices celery juices
[2756.92 - 2761.60] other green juices and you want to do
[2758.72 - 2765.60] that if you get really sick that is your
[2761.60 - 2767.84] body cleansing Full Throttle full
[2765.60 - 2769.92] force if you don't you're Pro you're not
[2767.84 - 2772.16] going to probably also get unless you're
[2769.92 - 2773.80] really toxic is what I'm saying cuz the
[2772.16 - 2775.72] ma majority of people that aren't that
[2773.80 - 2777.20] toxic like well you know it depends
[2775.72 - 2779.52] there's I mean people are really sick
[2777.20 - 2781.48] and toxic there's no question so be like
[2779.52 - 2784.76] half and half you get 50% people that
[2781.48 - 2786.24] are only like certain toxic level and if
[2784.76 - 2787.92] they're cleansing like that doing the
[2786.24 - 2789.12] juices and everything like that and you
[2787.92 - 2791.12] nav you know they're just going to be
[2789.12 - 2793.20] like oh my God yeah I know I feel it I
[2791.12 - 2794.60] feel tired that's what they'll get I
[2793.20 - 2796.44] feel
[2794.60 - 2798.12] tired and then you get these other
[2796.44 - 2799.92] people that are so toxic they'll just
[2798.12 - 2801.28] like I feel sick I just oh my God I
[2799.92 - 2804.96] can't function I got to lay down I got
[2801.28 - 2807.44] to just rest all that poison coming
[2804.96 - 2809.84] out but at least you prepared yourself
[2807.44 - 2811.72] and got you in in in the right way for
[2809.84 - 2813.56] detoxing and cleansing unless what
[2811.72 - 2815.80] people don't realize you got a fever
[2813.56 - 2817.60] 10034 someone's saying you're detoxing
[2815.80 - 2819.56] or am I detoxing cuz I had a smoothie
[2817.60 - 2821.52] and a celery juice the fever is because
[2819.56 - 2824.16] you got the flu people catch it all the
[2821.52 - 2826.72] time and I mean they they catch a flu
[2824.16 - 2828.12] they catch what what happens or a sty
[2826.72 - 2829.72] you can catch really easily or you
[2828.12 - 2830.80] picked up you picked up food poisoning
[2829.72 - 2833.32] because you went and ate somewhere at
[2830.80 - 2834.80] some restaurant and you blame the detox
[2833.32 - 2836.88] un like you're you're vomiting your
[2834.80 - 2838.56] diarrhea that's not that's not possible
[2836.88 - 2841.16] for a smoothie that's not possible for
[2838.56 - 2843.48] gentle detoxing and everything else so
[2841.16 - 2844.88] let's just cover some key points avoid
[2843.48 - 2847.08] cleansing programs that sell you
[2844.88 - 2848.72] thousands of dollars stuff and sell you
[2847.08 - 2850.24] lots of powders and powders and powders
[2848.72 - 2853.00] and whatever and even including alcohol
[2850.24 - 2855.72] supplements avoid that avoid
[2853.00 - 2857.24] it you want to do a cleanse you want to
[2855.72 - 2858.56] do a safe cleanse cleanse your liver and
[2857.24 - 2860.36] everything else and experience what
[2858.56 - 2861.60] detox symptoms really are safely are
[2860.36 - 2863.00] without killing your immune system and
[2861.60 - 2866.56] knocking things down and everything like
[2863.00 - 2868.76] that go fat free go over it fat free
[2866.56 - 2871.24] just just to be leafy greens and fruit
[2868.76 - 2873.24] on top of your leafy greens and and do
[2871.24 - 2875.52] the you know heavy metal detox smoothie
[2873.24 - 2877.52] and and just or do a smoothie you like
[2875.52 - 2880.40] or whatever it is you don't even have to
[2877.52 - 2881.92] do my stuff I don't sell anything I'm
[2880.40 - 2883.48] just talking about my directions you
[2881.92 - 2885.28] don't even have to do my directions you
[2883.48 - 2886.64] don't even have to do my 28 day cleanse
[2885.28 - 2888.64] from medical medium book one you don't
[2886.64 - 2890.40] even have to do you don't even have to
[2888.64 - 2892.76] do my heavy metal detox smoothie if you
[2890.40 - 2896.00] don't want to you don't have to do my
[2892.76 - 2898.32] celery juice if you don't want to okay I
[2896.00 - 2900.48] don't sell celery juice but it's since
[2898.32 - 2901.96] I'm you know I'm the spirit and I
[2900.48 - 2904.04] brought celery juice to everybody that's
[2901.96 - 2906.20] what I mean so it's like you can do you
[2904.04 - 2909.92] can do the you don't have to do
[2906.20 - 2913.32] those if you want do your own green
[2909.92 - 2916.24] juice do your own smoothie do your own
[2913.32 - 2919.04] salats do your own steam veggies with no
[2916.24 - 2921.76] overt fats get yourself cleansing every
[2919.04 - 2923.96] day and experience what the symptoms are
[2921.76 - 2925.56] that are really detoxing cuz that kind
[2923.96 - 2928.28] of cleanse is not going to make you
[2925.56 - 2931.28] viral like a virus come out or make some
[2928.28 - 2933.04] bacteria go wild when when the detox
[2931.28 - 2934.60] expert thinks that that back that that
[2933.04 - 2936.48] you know that you're just experiencing
[2934.60 - 2939.60] detox
[2936.48 - 2942.36] no you
[2939.60 - 2943.96] know so anyway as far as other radical
[2942.36 - 2945.92] cleansing if you're doing water fasting
[2943.96 - 2948.12] whatever you jump yourself into just
[2945.92 - 2949.40] don't try not to run around keep busy
[2948.12 - 2952.80] try not to do this just kind of like
[2949.40 - 2955.84] stay at home read you know watch watch
[2952.80 - 2957.52] you know videos on your computer just
[2955.84 - 2959.44] you know do things like that keep it
[2957.52 - 2961.80] chill if you do any water
[2959.44 - 2964.80] fasting um if you do anything like that
[2961.80 - 2968.44] you do any cleansing like on that level
[2964.80 - 2971.08] but going from high processed or or high
[2968.44 - 2973.12] clean high fat diet right to radical
[2971.08 - 2974.88] cleansing you're not going to be able to
[2973.12 - 2977.20] navigate what you're really doing with
[2974.88 - 2979.36] your detox especially if there are
[2977.20 - 2982.08] products someone's telling you you have
[2979.36 - 2983.40] to ingest during the course of that and
[2982.08 - 2985.04] if they're not telling you to do that
[2983.40 - 2988.12] and you're just going from point you
[2985.04 - 2989.80] know point A to point Z like that and
[2988.12 - 2991.84] you're experiencing detox yeah you're
[2989.80 - 2993.20] going to be detoxing without a doubt but
[2991.84 - 2995.64] you're not going to really be able to
[2993.20 - 2999.16] navigate through it you should come down
[2995.64 - 3002.48] come down carefully like I said come
[2999.16 - 3004.08] down carefully and safely you know get
[3002.48 - 3005.48] out of the bad foods to begin with
[3004.08 - 3007.00] processed foods get out of dairy
[3005.48 - 3009.68] products get out of eggs get out of
[3007.00 - 3011.52] cheese get out of all that get out of
[3009.68 - 3013.72] you know gluten of course and bread and
[3011.52 - 3016.60] bad grains the bad ones get out of all
[3013.72 - 3018.84] that come down the
[3016.60 - 3020.60] ladder and then when you're sitting here
[3018.84 - 3023.00] whether you're in your high protein land
[3020.60 - 3026.84] or in your high high you know when your
[3023.00 - 3029.44] vegan land come down on the overt fats
[3026.84 - 3031.96] bring them down lower the chicken lower
[3029.44 - 3035.08] the meat lower the nuts lower the oils
[3031.96 - 3036.84] and avocado lower that down for both you
[3035.08 - 3038.28] guys on both sides you know that that
[3036.84 - 3041.68] people that love this people that love
[3038.28 - 3044.48] that bring it down and then you want to
[3041.68 - 3046.20] cleanse go over it fat free for the
[3044.48 - 3047.76] Paleo and high protein people that means
[3046.20 - 3049.52] Animal product free for a while doesn't
[3047.76 - 3051.20] mean you can't go back to that it means
[3049.52 - 3053.20] animal protein free for the for the
[3051.20 - 3055.00] vegans and a plant-based and the raw PL
[3053.20 - 3057.68] raw vegans it means no avocados for a
[3055.00 - 3061.00] while sorry no cashew no cashew cream no
[3057.68 - 3062.92] cashew stuff no no almonds all day long
[3061.00 - 3065.44] no you know no walnuts no handfuls of
[3062.92 - 3066.92] nuts no anything just bring you bring
[3065.44 - 3068.12] get rid of all that bringing in fruits
[3066.92 - 3070.52] and vegetables and you bring in more
[3068.12 - 3071.60] juices I prefer celery juice because
[3070.52 - 3073.24] you're at least going to be taking care
[3071.60 - 3076.60] of your liver and and your brain and
[3073.24 - 3078.20] everything else and I prefer the heavy
[3076.60 - 3079.64] metal detox smoothie this way you're
[3078.20 - 3082.16] capturing all heavy metals in case
[3079.64 - 3084.16] something starts to detox so that's what
[3082.16 - 3085.76] I prefer I'm saying if you want to do it
[3084.16 - 3087.16] the right way and include you know
[3085.76 - 3088.72] bringing out those overt fats and you're
[3087.16 - 3090.00] bringing that down bringing it down and
[3088.72 - 3091.28] then you want to do something more
[3090.00 - 3092.80] radical that you want to buy into
[3091.28 - 3093.96] somebody else's plan or you want to buy
[3092.80 - 3095.20] into something like that or you want to
[3093.96 - 3096.60] go search on the internet and you find
[3095.20 - 3098.56] this other detox thing and you want to
[3096.60 - 3100.08] do something like that at least you're
[3098.56 - 3102.68] actually going to be safer because
[3100.08 - 3104.80] medical medium got you safer in a safer
[3102.68 - 3107.52] place in a better place prepared for it
[3104.80 - 3110.64] so you might be able to navigate better
[3107.52 - 3113.32] but but stay away from them you know to
[3110.64 - 3115.16] too much of the crazy stuff and some of
[3113.32 - 3117.28] you might might you know do love juice
[3115.16 - 3119.16] fast fasting periodically well you
[3117.28 - 3120.84] should be doing it this way before you
[3119.16 - 3122.52] go into your juice fasting whatever that
[3120.84 - 3124.04] is that you that you're buying into or
[3122.52 - 3126.16] you found or someone else is teaching
[3124.04 - 3128.40] you how to do make sure you do this
[3126.16 - 3130.96] stuff before you do
[3128.40 - 3133.20] that so all of this is
[3130.96 - 3135.68] important so what happens is when people
[3133.20 - 3137.76] get pushed into cleanses and stuff they
[3135.68 - 3139.80] get confused because couple things could
[3137.76 - 3141.80] happen their immune system dropped they
[3139.80 - 3143.40] reignited total sickness that they've
[3141.80 - 3146.20] already had for 10 20 years and they're
[3143.40 - 3147.84] being told they're just detoxing
