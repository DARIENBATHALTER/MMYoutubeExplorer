[266.80 - 269.84] just reading some comments
[277.12 - 281.28] robinson i've had a post of yours fact
[279.76 - 283.92] check today
[281.28 - 284.96] my friend did too yeah i mean we post
[283.92 - 286.88] and
[284.96 - 288.40] i think i think what happens to the
[286.88 - 291.12] system doesn't realize that
[288.40 - 293.28] medical medium information is medical
[291.12 - 296.24] medium information
[293.28 - 297.36] um all of medical medium information in
[296.24 - 299.68] all the books
[297.36 - 300.64] is original and unique and comes from
[299.68 - 302.16] the source
[300.64 - 303.76] and you guys know because if you read
[302.16 - 304.80] the first chapter origins of the medical
[303.76 - 307.04] medium right here
[304.80 - 308.00] in this book new edition you'll read
[307.04 - 310.56] about the source
[308.00 - 312.48] in which the information comes from all
[310.56 - 314.16] the information in this book
[312.48 - 316.00] okay and in the medical mean books is
[314.16 - 318.88] advanced and it's
[316.00 - 320.88] decades ahead of science and research so
[318.88 - 322.88] medical medium information
[320.88 - 325.04] is going to be fact checked because they
[322.88 - 326.24] don't realize it but it gets fact
[325.04 - 328.40] checked back to me
[326.24 - 329.92] because it's original and unique and
[328.40 - 330.88] that's why millions are healing around
[329.92 - 333.28] the world
[330.88 - 334.40] so you can't just take medical medium
[333.28 - 336.32] information
[334.40 - 338.08] type it in and try to find it somewhere
[336.32 - 341.60] else unless someone else has
[338.08 - 343.36] taken it and they're not citing it but
[341.60 - 345.44] it's the original from the source so
[343.36 - 347.28] you're gonna see that you're gonna see
[345.44 - 348.88] you're gonna see a post that will be
[347.28 - 350.80] like fact check
[348.88 - 352.16] this isn't true well that's kind of
[350.80 - 355.28] funny because
[352.16 - 357.60] it is because it's this is the source so
[355.28 - 359.12] they just don't realize that and medical
[357.60 - 360.16] science research is taking all my
[359.12 - 362.72] information
[360.16 - 363.36] now so they're taking the information
[362.72 - 365.20] and
[363.36 - 366.40] using it out there and it was published
[365.20 - 369.76] first here
[366.40 - 371.44] in this book published first that says a
[369.76 - 372.56] lot doesn't it when you really think
[371.44 - 375.04] about it
[372.56 - 376.56] what does that tell you so i put unique
[375.04 - 377.76] original information in the medical
[376.56 - 379.20] medium book
[377.76 - 382.40] and then years later science and
[379.20 - 386.00] research steals it out of the book
[382.40 - 387.28] right plagiarizes it and then they start
[386.00 - 389.60] to use it
[387.28 - 392.24] even though it's already been published
[389.60 - 394.72] so legally
[392.24 - 395.52] it is here published and documented
[394.72 - 397.20] first
[395.52 - 398.64] and years later science research they
[397.20 - 399.84] can't come up with their own answers to
[398.64 - 402.08] why everybody's sick so they had to
[399.84 - 403.60] steal medical mediums
[402.08 - 405.68] it's actually incredible when you think
[403.60 - 406.80] about it it's also really insane too
[405.68 - 408.96] like
[406.80 - 410.56] i mean are they that desperate where
[408.96 - 411.52] they could just knock on my door and say
[410.56 - 413.04] hey well you
[411.52 - 415.20] obviously you've healed so many people
[413.04 - 417.28] your information so can we use your
[415.20 - 423.84] information
[417.28 - 423.84] good to see you guys um
[424.56 - 428.56] we choose truth michelle l we choose
[426.56 - 430.80] truth over studies
[428.56 - 433.12] i mean how many studies get people
[430.80 - 435.28] better none
[433.12 - 436.32] that's what's really demented about it
[435.28 - 438.16] all right
[436.32 - 440.40] i mean you could be sick for 30 years
[438.16 - 443.12] with thyroid problems fibromyalgia
[440.40 - 444.16] multiple sclerosis symptoms seen 20 30
[443.12 - 446.64] specialists
[444.16 - 447.44] and the study on matcha tea is not going
[446.64 - 448.96] to fix you
[447.44 - 450.32] they're busy with studies you know
[448.96 - 450.88] they're busy with studies with all kinds
[450.32 - 453.92] of stuff
[450.88 - 455.60] they're studying wine they're studying
[453.92 - 457.44] alcohol they're studying wine
[455.60 - 458.96] just give you the stress benefits that's
[457.44 - 460.40] what they're studying meanwhile
[458.96 - 462.32] people are sick all around the world
[460.40 - 463.04] with autoimmune in all kinds of ways i
[462.32 - 466.08] mean
[463.04 - 469.28] dying sick and they're studying
[466.08 - 471.36] wine they'll pay for studies on this
[469.28 - 473.84] group of people drinking wine
[471.36 - 475.36] seems to have a lower reduced stress
[473.84 - 477.84] level
[475.36 - 478.96] paid for by the wine companies this
[477.84 - 481.28] group here
[478.96 - 483.44] who's not drinking wine seem to be a
[481.28 - 485.84] little bit more uptight
[483.44 - 488.16] and upset maybe because they're not
[485.84 - 488.16] drunk
[488.72 - 497.12] all right
[493.20 - 498.08] okay thanks to the readers who went into
[497.12 - 502.72] action
[498.08 - 505.12] with the information here in this book
[502.72 - 507.68] this book has prompted medical research
[505.12 - 510.56] and science to recategorize
[507.68 - 512.32] lyme disease this book prompted medical
[510.56 - 514.80] research and science to recategorize
[512.32 - 517.76] lyme disease i mean talking about
[514.80 - 520.96] powerful what a powerful book
[517.76 - 522.16] it's unbelievable while labeling lyme as
[520.96 - 523.44] autoimmune
[522.16 - 525.36] because that's what they did because of
[523.44 - 528.08] this book still does not represent a
[525.36 - 531.04] full understanding of lyme symptoms
[528.08 - 534.72] this recategorization is a way for
[531.04 - 538.00] medical research and science to admit
[534.72 - 539.92] we don't understand this as well as we
[538.00 - 542.08] thought we did
[539.92 - 543.76] so medical research and science doesn't
[542.08 - 546.64] understand lyme disease
[543.76 - 548.80] or anything else in chronic illness as
[546.64 - 550.88] much as they thought they did
[548.80 - 552.72] especially lyme disease and that's a
[550.88 - 554.72] major shift toward progress if you think
[552.72 - 557.84] about it you guys it's a testament
[554.72 - 558.80] to the people who read here in medical
[557.84 - 563.92] medium
[558.80 - 568.08] that lyme disease is viral eureka
[563.92 - 570.32] viral not bacterial
[568.08 - 572.16] okay who brought that information to
[570.32 - 574.84] their doctors and who applied
[572.16 - 576.00] the healing protocols here and got
[574.84 - 577.84] results
[576.00 - 580.00] it's also thanks to the doctors who have
[577.84 - 582.24] educated themselves with this material
[580.00 - 584.64] as they work to help their patients
[582.24 - 586.24] many doctors have even applied the
[584.64 - 588.84] healing protocols in their
[586.24 - 590.64] own lives with their own lyme disease
[588.84 - 593.60] symptoms all right
[590.64 - 593.60] i wanted to read that
[594.40 - 598.00] yeah it is i mean jeanette right that's
[596.64 - 601.68] powerful
[598.00 - 605.84] it's life-changing um
[601.68 - 605.84] so yeah
[607.12 - 611.52] so anyway you guys i'm on here we're
[609.76 - 612.80] live youtube and facebook i want to make
[611.52 - 614.88] you some food
[612.80 - 616.88] and we're going to read some stuff in
[614.88 - 618.80] here that's really cool
[616.88 - 621.04] um thanks for being here with me we'll
[618.80 - 624.40] read together
[621.04 - 625.60] right and let's do that now let's read a
[624.40 - 628.24] little bit before i start
[625.60 - 630.00] chopping up some salad good to see you
[628.24 - 631.52] guys
[630.00 - 633.12] you got the few you got the book a few
[631.52 - 635.84] days ago
[633.12 - 637.12] um have you done you have you tapped
[635.84 - 640.32] into the book
[637.12 - 642.88] i hope so hope you got a chance
[640.32 - 645.12] ariana why is everything viral epstein
[642.88 - 647.60] barr
[645.12 - 649.04] well science research believes
[647.60 - 652.56] everything's genetic
[649.04 - 653.28] your genes anya so that's what they
[652.56 - 656.88] believe
[653.28 - 657.68] so the question is why does research in
[656.88 - 659.20] science
[657.68 - 660.72] medical research and science believe
[659.20 - 663.76] that every single thing is
[660.72 - 664.72] is genetic so that's the question you
[663.76 - 666.40] have to be asking
[664.72 - 668.56] like why is research in science thinking
[666.40 - 669.68] it's all genetic so every single disease
[668.56 - 671.44] you have now
[669.68 - 673.60] out there every single symptom every
[671.44 - 675.76] single condition is genetic now
[673.60 - 677.28] so it's not like why is everything
[675.76 - 680.48] epstein-barr
[677.28 - 682.24] anthony no why research in science is
[680.48 - 684.96] everything genetic
[682.24 - 686.72] that's all they have as an answer so
[684.96 - 688.32] think about that right
[686.72 - 689.52] when you're functional medicine doctor
[688.32 - 690.40] or your practitioner a natural
[689.52 - 693.76] practitioner
[690.40 - 695.44] when they they do all their magic spells
[693.76 - 697.04] we'll try a little this we'll try a
[695.44 - 698.96] little apple cider vinegar here take
[697.04 - 700.00] these fish oil capsules hey take this
[698.96 - 702.56] supplement here
[700.00 - 703.84] let's do this test maybe we can do this
[702.56 - 704.48] whatever they do and in the end they
[703.84 - 707.84] still believe
[704.48 - 709.60] it's your genes in the end
[707.84 - 711.84] if you really beat them down on the
[709.60 - 714.56] ground enough about it it's your genes
[711.84 - 716.80] so it's not about and plus i don't say
[714.56 - 718.64] epstein-barr is everything
[716.80 - 721.36] i don't say everything fc bar is
[718.64 - 724.80] everything simplex one
[721.36 - 726.80] i talk about a lot hhv-6
[724.80 - 728.08] the shingles virus has over 30 varieties
[726.80 - 730.24] of mutated strains
[728.08 - 732.48] the epstein bar is not one virus the
[730.24 - 734.56] epstein-barr virus is over 60 varieties
[732.48 - 735.76] of mutated strains and they do different
[734.56 - 738.72] things
[735.76 - 739.44] toxic heavy metals i talk about a lot of
[738.72 - 743.68] the books
[739.44 - 746.88] radiation okay toxic heavy metals
[743.68 - 749.20] talk about that and
[746.88 - 750.72] pharmaceuticals causing problems like
[749.20 - 751.60] all of it so everything's not
[750.72 - 756.08] epstein-barr
[751.60 - 756.08] but a lot of stuff is epstein-barr
[757.60 - 763.68] so yeah so you guys
[762.32 - 765.52] i'm gonna read a little bit in here and
[763.68 - 767.52] then we're gonna get making a salad i'm
[765.52 - 769.28] glad you guys are on here i'm excited
[767.52 - 772.08] i got youtube live right here which is
[769.28 - 773.84] really cool
[772.08 - 776.72] i also talk about high fat diets being
[773.84 - 778.96] harmful too so it's not just epsom bar
[776.72 - 780.80] it's high fat diets beating down your
[778.96 - 781.36] liver giving you a stagnant sluggish
[780.80 - 783.60] liver
[781.36 - 784.40] doing harm i talk about all the trends
[783.60 - 786.16] that are bad
[784.40 - 787.60] like all the bad trends that cause
[786.16 - 789.60] trouble
[787.60 - 792.16] i talk about a lot of stuff and then i
[789.60 - 794.16] talk about the emotional aspect
[792.16 - 796.24] not just epstein-barr i talk about the
[794.16 - 798.48] emotional aspect the trail
[796.24 - 800.08] happens with your adrenals what happens
[798.48 - 802.00] when you're in fight or flight
[800.08 - 803.68] what happens when you're when when
[802.00 - 804.24] you're you know somebody breaks your
[803.68 - 806.32] trust
[804.24 - 808.00] and betrays you stabs you in the back or
[806.32 - 811.28] you get a broken relationship
[808.00 - 812.72] and a broken heart and a divorce and
[811.28 - 814.24] all kinds of stress that people go
[812.72 - 816.24] through i talk about that medical medium
[814.24 - 818.80] information is really vast with a lot of
[816.24 - 818.80] information
[819.60 - 823.28] pam question there on facebook do you
[821.92 - 824.16] think epstein-barr is part of your
[823.28 - 826.16] genetics
[824.16 - 828.08] wow 65 it's here it's not part of
[826.16 - 831.52] genetics viruses have nothing to do with
[828.08 - 834.72] genes at all at all
[831.52 - 838.32] nothing to do with genes so
[834.72 - 842.16] a virus just so you know
[838.32 - 844.56] okay a virus is a microorganism
[842.16 - 845.68] it has nothing to do with your jeans
[844.56 - 848.56] it's
[845.68 - 849.76] absolutely nothing to do it's a bug it's
[848.56 - 853.12] on its own
[849.76 - 854.80] it's it's a bug um does a fly flying
[853.12 - 857.28] around a room have anything to do with
[854.80 - 857.28] your genes
[858.32 - 862.40] does it when you get food poisoning from
[861.36 - 866.16] a foodborne
[862.40 - 867.84] microorganism a bad parasite on a piece
[866.16 - 870.64] of meat or a piece of
[867.84 - 874.08] raw fish and you get the food does that
[870.64 - 874.08] have something to do your genes
[874.16 - 877.68] i don't i don't think so right it
[876.00 - 880.48] doesn't at all
[877.68 - 881.20] the virus that you can contract okay so
[880.48 - 883.60] say you've got
[881.20 - 887.04] mono which is the epstein-barr virus and
[883.60 - 890.32] you kiss somebody
[887.04 - 894.48] right in a relationship that person
[890.32 - 896.08] then catches mono is that their genes
[894.48 - 899.28] why would that be their genes they just
[896.08 - 902.96] caught mono from you
[899.28 - 907.36] so when you go into a public bathroom
[902.96 - 909.28] and you sit on a toilet after somebody
[907.36 - 911.52] has fecal matter on the toilet and in
[909.28 - 914.56] that fecal matter
[911.52 - 916.40] the poop on the toilet there's viruses
[914.56 - 919.28] all in it because they're sick with the
[916.40 - 920.88] hhv-6 or epstein-barr or shingles and
[919.28 - 924.56] you sit on the toilet and you
[920.88 - 924.56] catch the virus somehow
[924.80 - 927.84] is that your genes
[929.44 - 932.80] and kiss somebody with a cold sore and
[932.16 - 935.84] you've got
[932.80 - 936.80] the simplex one virus and you got a
[935.84 - 939.12] fever blister
[936.80 - 940.24] and you kissed them and now they have a
[939.12 - 943.52] fever blister
[940.24 - 944.16] is that their genes no they caught a bug
[943.52 - 947.20] that's its
[944.16 - 948.32] own microorganism and that's how it
[947.20 - 951.44] works
[948.32 - 953.92] i you know it's the thing is is that
[951.44 - 956.48] but they'll tell you though that it's
[953.92 - 956.48] your genes
[956.80 - 960.56] so do priests as viruses can integrate
[959.52 - 964.48] gray integrate
[960.56 - 967.60] into your data no they can't
[964.48 - 968.08] they can't so they can't mess with your
[967.60 - 970.64] dna
[968.08 - 972.56] they can't become your dna they can't
[970.64 - 973.76] that's all theory and there's no science
[972.56 - 975.52] behind that
[973.76 - 978.24] there's no study that can actually show
[975.52 - 980.84] that that's theoretical
[978.24 - 982.24] but you know it's theoretical
[980.84 - 986.32] theoretical
[982.24 - 989.20] um that's how it works virus
[986.32 - 989.52] is on its own you got the herpes simplex
[989.20 - 991.12] one
[989.52 - 992.56] and you got your fever blister and you
[991.12 - 994.32] kiss somebody else and
[992.56 - 996.56] then you give them your fever blister
[994.32 - 999.68] they just caught herpes simplex one
[996.56 - 1002.00] that's not your genes or dna that's you
[999.68 - 1003.12] catching the herpes simplex one a live
[1002.00 - 1005.68] virus
[1003.12 - 1006.16] it doesn't kind of get any more clear or
[1005.68 - 1009.36] easy
[1006.16 - 1014.24] breezy or understandable
[1009.36 - 1016.48] okay um how did so many people get it
[1014.24 - 1018.00] um all you gotta do is eat in a
[1016.48 - 1019.68] restaurant
[1018.00 - 1021.60] more than a few times in your life and
[1019.68 - 1024.16] you're gonna get something
[1021.60 - 1025.68] you just are the amount of
[1024.16 - 1028.80] microorganisms
[1025.68 - 1029.84] viruses like epstein-barr and strep and
[1028.80 - 1032.80] shingles
[1029.84 - 1033.84] you can get from restaurant eating is
[1032.80 - 1036.32] unbelievable
[1033.84 - 1038.08] unbelievable you've got chefs in a
[1036.32 - 1041.12] kitchen with 100 degrees
[1038.08 - 1042.24] dripping sweat in your salads and in
[1041.12 - 1045.20] your food
[1042.24 - 1046.32] tripping drenching sweats sweat just
[1045.20 - 1048.64] drops right
[1046.32 - 1050.08] you got that okay you got chefs cutting
[1048.64 - 1051.44] their fingers
[1050.08 - 1053.52] they constantly cut their fingers they
[1051.44 - 1055.60] got band-aids all over their hands
[1053.52 - 1057.04] as they're preparing your food that's
[1055.60 - 1059.36] just one thing
[1057.04 - 1060.80] you got public bathrooms public
[1059.36 - 1064.00] bathrooms
[1060.80 - 1066.00] if you go to bathroom and you don't
[1064.00 - 1069.12] flush the toilet before you go
[1066.00 - 1070.88] to bathroom because sitting on top of
[1069.12 - 1073.20] that bowl is remnances
[1070.88 - 1074.48] of somebody else and it splashes back in
[1073.20 - 1076.16] you and then you can get it from
[1074.48 - 1077.28] relationships relationships is the big
[1076.16 - 1079.28] one
[1077.28 - 1080.88] such relationships that's how everybody
[1079.28 - 1083.12] spreads all the bugs
[1080.88 - 1084.80] that's why it just goes around decades
[1083.12 - 1086.24] of just spreading bugs it's just normal
[1084.80 - 1086.88] life i mean normal life i'm not saying
[1086.24 - 1088.80] anything
[1086.88 - 1091.76] good or bad or bad whatever i'm just
[1088.80 - 1093.12] saying that's a big piece of it
[1091.76 - 1094.72] and that's just some of the stuff i can
[1093.12 - 1095.92] go on and on and on let's look a little
[1094.72 - 1097.60] bit here it's just great to answer
[1095.92 - 1099.84] questions you guys
[1097.60 - 1101.44] glad we're here so i'm making the salad
[1099.84 - 1103.92] but i'm going to read a little bit
[1101.44 - 1106.00] out of the new edition right here okay
[1103.92 - 1107.36] so medical medium secrets behind chronic
[1106.00 - 1109.84] industry illness how to finally heal a
[1107.36 - 1109.84] new admission
[1110.72 - 1114.64] this is called a look back this is in
[1112.96 - 1117.60] the lyme disease chapter you guys
[1114.64 - 1120.84] bear with me all right let's travel back
[1117.60 - 1123.60] in time for a moment to november
[1120.84 - 1125.12] 1975. when multiple
[1123.60 - 1127.20] children and young adults were
[1125.12 - 1129.56] developing symptoms
[1127.20 - 1130.96] which alerted doctors to launch an
[1129.56 - 1134.72] investigation
[1130.96 - 1138.32] in the area around lyme connecticut
[1134.72 - 1140.16] that gave lyme disease its name right
[1138.32 - 1141.68] first let's remind ourselves of the
[1140.16 - 1143.76] technological back
[1141.68 - 1145.44] technology back then let's remind
[1143.76 - 1146.88] ourselves a little bit right
[1145.44 - 1148.96] rotary phones do you guys remember the
[1146.88 - 1151.36] rotary phones it's like i got to call
[1148.96 - 1153.60] somebody but i gotta call somebody quick

[1164.88 - 1169.76] or am i getting that old or what is it
[1166.96 - 1171.92] which one is it
[1169.76 - 1173.68] um i got to get a rotary phone prop i'm
[1171.92 - 1175.92] going to get a rotary phone prop
[1173.68 - 1176.72] i'm going to order one tonight that's
[1175.92 - 1178.48] going to be good

[1209.12 - 1212.16] right
[1210.32 - 1214.88] so let's travel back in time for a
[1212.16 - 1216.08] moment to november 1975 when multiple
[1214.88 - 1217.60] children and young adults were
[1216.08 - 1219.52] developing symptoms which alerted
[1217.60 - 1220.08] doctors to launch an investigation in
[1219.52 - 1222.00] the area
[1220.08 - 1224.32] around lime connecticut that gave lime
[1222.00 - 1226.00] disease's theme if you guys just came on
[1224.32 - 1228.40] watch the replay of the facebook live
[1226.00 - 1229.76] watch the replay of youtube the youtube
[1228.40 - 1232.80] live
[1229.76 - 1235.36] please if you can first let's remind
[1232.80 - 1238.08] ourselves of the technology back then
[1235.36 - 1240.72] rotary phones on the kitchen wall the
[1238.08 - 1242.56] rotary phone was on the kitchen wall
[1240.72 - 1243.76] this is important to know i'm trying to
[1242.56 - 1246.32] tell you guys
[1243.76 - 1247.04] why this is important okay and it's part
[1246.32 - 1250.00] of why
[1247.04 - 1250.72] everybody was so injured by treatment
[1250.00 - 1253.28] for lyme
[1250.72 - 1254.40] and how tens of thousands hundreds of
[1253.28 - 1256.56] thousands of women
[1254.40 - 1258.40] lost their health and their lives their
[1256.56 - 1261.28] families fell apart
[1258.40 - 1262.80] many died because of stupidity in the
[1261.28 - 1266.16] medical system
[1262.80 - 1267.92] keep keep that in mind so the rotary
[1266.16 - 1270.56] phones on the kitchen wall
[1267.92 - 1272.40] no such thing as voicemail voicemail
[1270.56 - 1275.88] didn't exist back then
[1272.40 - 1279.04] and sony was just releasing its first
[1275.88 - 1282.40] vcr do you know what that is
[1279.04 - 1283.44] anybody too young in here christina
[1282.40 - 1286.56] laughed with an
[1283.44 - 1290.12] lol christina elizabeth
[1286.56 - 1293.20] right sony just launched their first
[1290.12 - 1298.48] vcr i mean
[1293.20 - 1298.48] right okay for sale in the united states
[1298.56 - 1302.48] in the medical world kids were getting
[1300.72 - 1305.68] their tonsils plucked out
[1302.48 - 1307.68] as if they were apples on trees every
[1305.68 - 1309.52] kid that had a scratchy throat
[1307.68 - 1310.80] had their tonsils ripped out of their
[1309.52 - 1314.88] throat
[1310.80 - 1318.64] okay this is dark ages this is just 1975
[1314.88 - 1320.40] but it's dark ages
[1318.64 - 1321.84] and we're still in the dark ages that's
[1320.40 - 1323.28] what's sad and when i talk about blood
[1321.84 - 1325.04] draw in a little while you'll know what
[1323.28 - 1326.80] kind of dark ages we're talking about as
[1325.04 - 1328.24] you guys get sicker and sicker getting
[1326.80 - 1330.16] your blood taken from you
[1328.24 - 1332.72] i gotta kind of get your back on that
[1330.16 - 1334.80] help you
[1332.72 - 1336.24] hey terry just said no answering machine
[1334.80 - 1339.60] either
[1336.24 - 1342.88] right terry we the same age
[1339.60 - 1347.68] or what nancy said i remember that
[1342.88 - 1349.52] all that as a young child
[1347.68 - 1351.28] all right kids were getting their
[1349.52 - 1353.68] tonsils plugged out plucked out
[1351.28 - 1355.84] as if they were apples on trees with no
[1353.68 - 1356.80] understanding of the underlying cause of
[1355.84 - 1359.12] tonsillitis
[1356.80 - 1360.40] science research is so smart you guys
[1359.12 - 1362.00] they don't even know what causes
[1360.40 - 1363.52] tonsillitis and guess what
[1362.00 - 1365.44] they still don't know what causes
[1363.52 - 1367.44] tonsillitis and guess what
[1365.44 - 1368.88] because medical medium tells people what
[1367.44 - 1370.32] the cause of tonsillitis is
[1368.88 - 1371.76] and puts it in the books medical
[1370.32 - 1372.08] research and science are going to steal
[1371.76 - 1374.08] that
[1372.08 - 1375.28] next just like they stole all the other
[1374.08 - 1375.92] information in here and started
[1375.28 - 1377.52] publishing
[1375.92 - 1379.84] with no studies behind it but started
[1377.52 - 1383.84] publishing it after the fact
[1379.84 - 1383.84] plagiarized plagiarity plagiarizing
[1384.00 - 1386.96] if you're somebody who doubts medical
[1385.28 - 1388.32] medium info and you're a big science
[1386.96 - 1390.48] person you're all about science is
[1388.32 - 1392.32] everything medical medium is crazy
[1390.48 - 1393.92] well then this might give you some
[1392.32 - 1394.72] relief to know that medical research and
[1393.92 - 1396.48] science is
[1394.72 - 1399.60] hijacking all of medical mediums books
[1396.48 - 1403.36] and information stealing it out of there
[1399.60 - 1405.76] yeah the medical means looking into it
[1403.36 - 1406.80] because that's really screwed up they're
[1405.76 - 1408.80] hijacking it
[1406.80 - 1410.32] taking it and using it they're not
[1408.80 - 1412.48] supposed to it's a pup this is
[1410.32 - 1413.76] this is a publication that was before
[1412.48 - 1417.44] all of their
[1413.76 - 1419.20] them knowing all that even today there's
[1417.44 - 1420.96] no clinical understanding of what's
[1419.20 - 1422.24] behind tonsillitis they still don't know
[1420.96 - 1426.32] what's behind tonsillitis
[1422.24 - 1426.32] so smart my god they're so smart
[1427.28 - 1430.88] while technology has made leaps and
[1429.52 - 1433.20] bounds
[1430.88 - 1435.76] yeah with phones and crap like that and
[1433.20 - 1437.20] car like radios
[1435.76 - 1439.60] technologies made leaps and bounds to
[1437.20 - 1442.24] computers phones and car radios
[1439.60 - 1442.64] that's it pretty much pretty much that's
[1442.24 - 1445.84] it
[1442.64 - 1448.56] think about that right but
[1445.84 - 1450.16] the cars still have rubber tires we're
[1448.56 - 1451.12] so advanced but all you got to do is run
[1450.16 - 1453.68] over a nail
[1451.12 - 1455.92] and your your ass is stuck on the side a
[1453.68 - 1457.76] highway
[1455.92 - 1461.28] we have so much technology now but we've
[1457.76 - 1462.64] had a rubber tire since 1902
[1461.28 - 1464.32] i'm trying to think about that one like
[1462.64 - 1466.16] that that's a head scratcher to me we're
[1464.32 - 1468.64] so advanced in technology
[1466.16 - 1470.00] but we've had car tires since 1897 or
[1468.64 - 1472.80] something like that but we
[1470.00 - 1474.32] we still have a car tire which is a
[1472.80 - 1477.44] rubber tire
[1474.32 - 1479.04] with air filled in it since 1902 or what
[1477.44 - 1482.96] is it 1904 i forget
[1479.04 - 1484.80] 1890 this is crazy right
[1482.96 - 1486.40] so where's that advance we're advancing
[1484.80 - 1491.12] car radios and
[1486.40 - 1492.80] cell phones and and computers
[1491.12 - 1494.40] while technology has made leaps and
[1492.80 - 1495.68] bounds advancements in chronic and
[1494.40 - 1500.00] mystery illness has been
[1495.68 - 1502.40] at a freaking standstill
[1500.00 - 1504.40] fibromyalgia still cause unknown they
[1502.40 - 1505.92] think it's just overactive nerves
[1504.40 - 1507.84] and if a functional medicine doctor
[1505.92 - 1509.04] talks about pathogens it came from
[1507.84 - 1512.56] medical medium books
[1509.04 - 1514.08] and lectures the most advanced
[1512.56 - 1516.72] information we have in chronic illness
[1514.08 - 1517.68] comes from medical medium books only
[1516.72 - 1519.44] you can have the best functional
[1517.68 - 1520.00] medicine doctors practice in all their
[1519.44 - 1521.60] stuff
[1520.00 - 1523.52] the best naturopaths practicing all
[1521.60 - 1524.64] their stuff and anything that they
[1523.52 - 1526.80] that they talk about that's
[1524.64 - 1528.48] microorganisms or comes back to anything
[1526.80 - 1530.56] like viral or anything bacterial
[1528.48 - 1532.48] comes only for medical medium books
[1530.56 - 1534.32] before the medical medium books
[1532.48 - 1535.52] and medical medium lectures and
[1534.32 - 1537.84] everybody thought
[1535.52 - 1540.32] candida was the cause of everything and
[1537.84 - 1542.00] that was it
[1540.32 - 1543.36] it's actually demented when you think
[1542.00 - 1545.12] about it like why does it have to be
[1543.36 - 1547.68] spirit of compassion that has to
[1545.12 - 1548.40] solve medical mysteries why does it have
[1547.68 - 1550.08] to be me at
[1548.40 - 1551.76] four years old like you guys read in the
[1550.08 - 1553.36] book i wake up one morning
[1551.76 - 1554.88] and i'm hearing a voice perfectly clear
[1553.36 - 1556.00] that's giving me all this information
[1554.88 - 1558.16] like why does it have to go
[1556.00 - 1560.80] that route and science research still
[1558.16 - 1563.76] can't figure out why everybody's sick
[1560.80 - 1565.20] that's why i wish it didn't have to go
[1563.76 - 1565.68] that route because i would have had a
[1565.20 - 1570.80] really
[1565.68 - 1572.64] fun life or a peaceful life right
[1570.80 - 1574.64] the symptoms that children and a few
[1572.64 - 1575.44] adults in the lyme area started to
[1574.64 - 1577.28] experience
[1575.44 - 1579.20] chronic fatigue headaches joint pain and
[1577.28 - 1581.52] so on were symptoms
[1579.20 - 1582.88] that had been seen for decades in every
[1581.52 - 1586.00] other town
[1582.88 - 1589.04] in that state not to mention every state
[1586.00 - 1591.60] throughout the entire country
[1589.04 - 1592.32] so lyme disease symptoms were nothing
[1591.60 - 1593.76] new
[1592.32 - 1595.28] these symptoms children were
[1593.76 - 1596.72] experiencing were nothing new it was
[1595.28 - 1598.00] just that a few doctors had some
[1596.72 - 1600.40] compassion and wanted to look
[1598.00 - 1603.20] into it that's all it was they made a
[1600.40 - 1603.20] few phone calls
[1604.16 - 1609.28] yet somehow in this area around lyme the
[1607.36 - 1611.12] illness was treated as something new and
[1609.28 - 1612.64] unrecognizable even though everybody
[1611.12 - 1613.20] around the world children were suffering
[1612.64 - 1617.04] from this
[1613.20 - 1618.96] for decades it's most likely because
[1617.04 - 1620.24] compassionate doctors were trying to go
[1618.96 - 1622.08] above and beyond their role
[1620.24 - 1624.48] taking these symptoms more seriously on
[1622.08 - 1626.40] a personal level
[1624.48 - 1627.68] on a personal level doctors researchers
[1626.40 - 1630.56] and townspeople began
[1627.68 - 1633.12] looking for a culprit they went looking
[1630.56 - 1635.84] for a culprit everybody
[1633.12 - 1637.36] and landed on the deer tick they landed
[1635.84 - 1640.24] on the deer tick
[1637.36 - 1640.96] talk about lyme disease here they landed
[1640.24 - 1643.04] on the deer tick
[1640.96 - 1645.12] you guys just got on well i would i
[1643.04 - 1647.36] would advise you guys to
[1645.12 - 1648.32] recommend at least to watch it from the
[1647.36 - 1652.72] beginning
[1648.32 - 1655.68] later on so they landed on the deer tick
[1652.72 - 1656.48] because one of the patients reported
[1655.68 - 1660.40] seeing a
[1656.48 - 1665.20] d a tick a few weeks before he fell
[1660.40 - 1668.24] ill that's like a train derailing
[1665.20 - 1672.32] the reasons unknown
[1668.24 - 1676.72] and a passenger mentioning a deer
[1672.32 - 1676.72] he saw grazing 50 miles back
[1677.92 - 1683.84] the clues don't add up in either
[1680.84 - 1683.84] scenario
[1684.56 - 1690.64] even though no one could explain why a
[1686.80 - 1695.52] tank would give someone lyme disease
[1690.64 - 1695.52] a 17th century style witch hunt began
[1695.68 - 1699.20] don't put those two words together
[1702.96 - 1707.76] it'll it'll happen based only on a rumor
[1705.68 - 1711.68] deer
[1707.76 - 1715.20] ticks those two words
[1711.68 - 1718.24] that lived on deer became the targets
[1715.20 - 1718.24] so what happens you guys
[1718.80 - 1722.96] what happens is the deer tick took the
[1721.84 - 1726.08] blame
[1722.96 - 1729.76] that's what happened it took
[1726.08 - 1733.60] the blame right so
[1729.76 - 1737.12] it's only because a deer tick
[1733.60 - 1742.16] was seen a few weeks back
[1737.12 - 1745.44] crawling on someone crawling on someone
[1742.16 - 1748.32] and that is how it happened
[1745.44 - 1750.32] okay nancy says oh my gosh so ridiculous
[1748.32 - 1752.32] yeah so nuts right
[1750.32 - 1754.56] so that's how it happened you're dying
[1752.32 - 1754.56] here
[1755.68 - 1759.20] so am i i'm laughing hard too the new
[1758.08 - 1763.12] book is incredible
[1759.20 - 1765.68] viola so you guys
[1763.12 - 1766.32] that's how it happened so so when we go
[1765.68 - 1769.20] back
[1766.32 - 1770.24] into history into lime okay where it all
[1769.20 - 1772.24] started
[1770.24 - 1773.44] and you think about all the science and
[1772.24 - 1775.28] research and technology
[1773.44 - 1777.36] that we have in medical research and
[1775.28 - 1781.04] science that we have
[1777.36 - 1785.44] okay when you think about it
[1781.04 - 1788.24] right really the conclusions were drawn
[1785.44 - 1788.96] from symptoms children were having that
[1788.24 - 1790.88] we're having
[1788.96 - 1792.56] all around the world in places there
[1790.88 - 1796.40] weren't even their ticks
[1792.56 - 1798.56] or ticks of any kind not to mention
[1796.40 - 1799.60] they only brought the deer tick in
[1798.56 - 1803.52] because
[1799.60 - 1809.60] one of the families saw a tick
[1803.52 - 1812.40] crawling on someone weeks before
[1809.60 - 1814.56] you see how how bad all this went how
[1812.40 - 1816.40] terrible it all went
[1814.56 - 1818.24] that's why research and science also
[1816.40 - 1820.16] knows that i blew the ceiling off with
[1818.24 - 1822.72] this one because millions
[1820.16 - 1824.24] and millions of copies of this book sold
[1822.72 - 1826.32] around the world
[1824.24 - 1827.60] and doctors learned about it and they
[1826.32 - 1831.60] realized
[1827.60 - 1832.00] being sensible that research and science
[1831.60 - 1834.40] and the
[1832.00 - 1835.28] story and how it all happened with lot
[1834.40 - 1838.88] in with
[1835.28 - 1839.60] lyme disease was all bs yes people were
[1838.88 - 1841.36] sick
[1839.60 - 1843.20] yes they get sick with neurological
[1841.36 - 1846.88] symptoms but it wasn't
[1843.20 - 1846.88] really what it seemed to be
[1847.68 - 1852.56] so patients reporting seeing a tick a
[1851.28 - 1854.56] few weeks before
[1852.56 - 1856.08] he fell ill that's like a train
[1854.56 - 1858.56] derailing for reasons
[1856.08 - 1860.96] unknown and a passenger mentioning a
[1858.56 - 1863.04] deer ticky saw grazing 50 miles back
[1860.96 - 1866.56] the clues don't add up in either
[1863.04 - 1870.16] scenario like i told you guys
[1866.56 - 1872.08] so in 1981
[1870.16 - 1874.88] so you guys i'm gonna make a sell in a
[1872.08 - 1876.32] minute you hang it in there
[1874.88 - 1879.20] so i'm doing some reading for you guys
[1876.32 - 1882.24] tonight i am i'm at your service
[1879.20 - 1884.24] that's my new thing now at your service
[1882.24 - 1886.16] of course i want to be at your service
[1884.24 - 1890.24] you guys always know that
[1886.16 - 1890.24] in 1981 okay
[1891.36 - 1897.36] all right a doctor announced he
[1893.76 - 1901.36] discovered the missing link
[1897.36 - 1903.60] a bacterium named borrelia
[1901.36 - 1905.52] that the ticks passed along the humans
[1903.60 - 1907.28] through their bites so
[1905.52 - 1910.00] he thought he found something he thought
[1907.28 - 1912.32] he found a bacteria
[1910.00 - 1913.28] that must be passed from a tick to a
[1912.32 - 1916.80] human right
[1913.28 - 1920.48] 1981. it's the missing link
[1916.80 - 1923.20] okay he was lauded for his discovery
[1920.48 - 1925.92] which led to a series of bacteria focus
[1923.20 - 1929.20] tested treatments for lyme disease
[1925.92 - 1930.40] it was the perfect out for medical
[1929.20 - 1932.72] authorities
[1930.40 - 1934.24] we solved your problem you guys your
[1932.72 - 1937.60] problems solved
[1934.24 - 1941.60] it's all solved it was a tick
[1937.60 - 1949.84] bite that's what it was a tick bite
[1941.60 - 1954.32] and we found the bacteria um
[1949.84 - 1954.32] we everybody only had am radio
[1954.80 - 1962.08] everybody had rotary phones on the wall
[1958.16 - 1965.20] right no 9-1-1
[1962.08 - 1967.84] probably didn't exist right
[1965.20 - 1970.32] you had to call the town office to get
[1967.84 - 1972.80] an emergency vehicle to your house
[1970.32 - 1976.40] or you had to call the police department
[1972.80 - 1977.92] number with your rotary phone
[1976.40 - 1981.76] but they had the answers for lyme
[1977.92 - 1981.76] disease just like they have them now
[1984.00 - 1987.44] it was a perfect out for the medical
[1985.52 - 1988.48] authorities no one liked ticks anyway
[1987.44 - 1990.32] you guys like ticks
[1988.48 - 1991.44] you guys like ticks crawling on you do
[1990.32 - 1993.12] you guys like when you have a tick
[1991.44 - 1994.72] crawling on you
[1993.12 - 1996.00] i didn't like seeing those roaches run
[1994.72 - 1997.44] across my counter did you see those
[1996.00 - 2000.16] roaches run across my counter in the
[1997.44 - 2000.16] tick tock video
[2002.00 - 2006.00] i'm still still laughing here cracking
[2004.08 - 2008.64] myself up no one likes take
[2006.00 - 2009.60] ticks anyway and the theory of a
[2008.64 - 2012.80] tick-borne
[2009.60 - 2014.72] illness fed into the fear of nature
[2012.80 - 2017.68] already present in society we hated
[2014.72 - 2019.52] ticks everybody hates tickets
[2017.68 - 2021.44] medical authorities felt they could give
[2019.52 - 2022.88] up on digging for the answer all done
[2021.44 - 2024.56] don't have to look for any answers
[2022.88 - 2025.92] anymore we figured out it must have been
[2024.56 - 2029.44] that little tick
[2025.92 - 2031.60] that was you know found on that patient
[2029.44 - 2033.44] weeks before they fell ill no other
[2031.60 - 2036.40] ticks were found on anybody else but it
[2033.44 - 2036.40] must have been that tick
[2036.96 - 2039.68] reading out of medical medium new
[2038.32 - 2041.20] edition if you guys want to know it's a
[2039.68 - 2044.24] mind-blowing book
[2041.20 - 2045.44] it's a mind-blowing book amazon.com it's
[2044.24 - 2047.76] on sale right now
[2045.44 - 2049.76] it's just it's just a mind-blowing book
[2047.76 - 2051.76] i can't say it enough
[2049.76 - 2052.88] unfortunately all these discoveries were
[2051.76 - 2056.64] wrong
[2052.88 - 2058.40] they were wrong and wrong
[2056.64 - 2060.00] this is what you won't hear anywhere
[2058.40 - 2063.60] else lyme disease is not
[2060.00 - 2067.36] caused by ticks i broke
[2063.60 - 2070.32] the back on that with this book
[2067.36 - 2072.80] incredible what happened it freed so
[2070.32 - 2074.40] many people
[2072.80 - 2076.64] and lyme disease is not caused by
[2074.40 - 2079.04] borrelia when the research was taken
[2076.64 - 2081.04] place in the 1970s and 1980s you'd
[2079.04 - 2083.36] suppose researchers would have realized
[2081.04 - 2086.88] the problem was happening nationwide
[2083.36 - 2088.64] and globally and today
[2086.88 - 2090.16] you think someone would wake up and
[2088.64 - 2091.76] realize that hundreds of thousands of
[2090.16 - 2093.84] people who have never
[2091.76 - 2096.64] been near a deer tick receive lyme
[2093.84 - 2096.64] diagnoses
[2097.52 - 2103.76] um so i'm gonna start making some food
[2100.16 - 2105.44] real quick
[2103.76 - 2107.20] guys isn't it interesting i'm just going
[2105.44 - 2108.88] into that a little bit right there

[2127.52 - 2131.44] so i can just run by a couple little
[2129.60 - 2132.16] things with you guys is here's what
[2131.44 - 2135.20] happens
[2132.16 - 2136.96] here's what happened with lyme disease
[2135.20 - 2140.16] so because they thought it was bacteria
[2136.96 - 2142.96] or it was on purpose to sell billions of
[2140.16 - 2145.68] dollars of antibiotics
[2142.96 - 2147.52] let's say trillions of dollars of
[2145.68 - 2148.16] antibiotics let's just say that how
[2147.52 - 2151.76] about that
[2148.16 - 2154.64] trillions of dollars of antibiotics okay
[2151.76 - 2154.64] let's just say that
[2155.84 - 2161.76] worldwide worldwide worldwide right
[2159.52 - 2161.76] so
[2164.72 - 2167.60] and that's what happened there it was
[2166.08 - 2169.52] about selling antibiotics because there
[2167.60 - 2170.80] was no treatment for the disease or
[2169.52 - 2172.48] condition there's no
[2170.80 - 2174.32] there's no treatment now unless
[2172.48 - 2176.08] someone's doing an epstein-barr protocol
[2174.32 - 2178.96] for medical medium other than that it's
[2176.08 - 2182.48] all guesswork
[2178.96 - 2184.88] but they had to they had to
[2182.48 - 2186.08] sell it because they needed they needed
[2184.88 - 2188.40] to sell a drug
[2186.08 - 2190.00] for this thing and so they had to say it
[2188.40 - 2192.64] was bacterial and they had to say it was
[2190.00 - 2194.80] a tick it was the perfect way out
[2192.64 - 2201.84] it's the perfect way out so doing a chop
[2194.80 - 2201.84] salad here
[2209.68 - 2215.52] so what is behind lyme disease xena it's
[2212.08 - 2218.16] a viral condition
[2215.52 - 2218.80] viruses such as epstein-barr that cause
[2218.16 - 2220.64] a lime
[2218.80 - 2223.60] they release a neurotoxin that causes
[2220.64 - 2223.60] neurological lyme
[2226.16 - 2231.20] they release a neurotoxin that causes
[2227.92 - 2231.20] neurological lyme disease
[2231.44 - 2235.12] that neurotoxin affects the nerves
[2234.00 - 2237.28] bacteria
[2235.12 - 2242.32] can't create a neurotoxin and can't
[2237.28 - 2243.68] cause neurological problems
[2242.32 - 2246.16] but i can tell you right here the
[2243.68 - 2250.40] history of lyme disease is grave
[2246.16 - 2252.88] grave so many lives destroyed
[2250.40 - 2253.92] see even some podcast doctors out there
[2252.88 - 2258.00] and
[2253.92 - 2260.96] health gurus out there that gave a lot
[2258.00 - 2263.52] of antibiotics during the during the
[2260.96 - 2263.52] 90s
[2264.08 - 2269.84] to their lyme patients put them in bed
[2267.84 - 2273.12] forever
[2269.84 - 2276.32] lyme disease okay
[2273.12 - 2278.32] if you want to say it's bacterial
[2276.32 - 2280.08] borrelia and bartonella are not super
[2278.32 - 2281.28] bugs you can kill them off with the
[2280.08 - 2283.84] mildness of
[2281.28 - 2285.60] antibiotics but what happens is the
[2283.84 - 2287.20] antibiotics makes lyme patients worse
[2285.60 - 2288.16] neurological line worse and worse and
[2287.20 - 2289.68] worse and worse
[2288.16 - 2290.96] unless you got a doctor now that gives
[2289.68 - 2292.48] you just a little bit of a mild
[2290.96 - 2294.24] antibiotic so they're not
[2292.48 - 2295.68] killing you with the antibiotics and
[2294.24 - 2296.96] then they're giving you cat's claw and
[2295.68 - 2300.00] all these other supplements
[2296.96 - 2301.52] like i've talked about um
[2300.00 - 2303.68] the cats call here like i've talked
[2301.52 - 2306.00] about not sponsored by the way
[2303.68 - 2307.36] the cat's claw from vimergy and i've
[2306.00 - 2308.08] been talking about cat's claw for
[2307.36 - 2310.96] decades
[2308.08 - 2312.24] and so now lyme doctors use cat's claw
[2310.96 - 2314.08] their integrative
[2312.24 - 2316.00] lyme doctors they use a little bit of
[2314.08 - 2317.92] antibiotics and they see that they see
[2316.00 - 2319.52] the patient get sicker and sicker and
[2317.92 - 2321.12] sicker from the antibiotics so they back
[2319.52 - 2322.40] down they get off the antibiotics real
[2321.12 - 2324.24] quick and then they start using cat's
[2322.40 - 2325.68] claw and natural subs and stuff it's all
[2324.24 - 2326.24] medical medium information they're using
[2325.68 - 2328.24] now
[2326.24 - 2330.32] but they do a blend so that people think
[2328.24 - 2331.84] they're not getting killed or
[2330.32 - 2333.92] literally losing their lives from their
[2331.84 - 2335.44] lyme treatment that that thank god
[2333.92 - 2335.92] that's what medical medium information
[2335.44 - 2337.84] did it's
[2335.92 - 2339.52] literally turned things around so people
[2337.84 - 2343.44] don't get killed off
[2339.52 - 2343.44] by their medical lime treatment
[2344.40 - 2347.68] making a chopped salad
[2347.76 - 2351.04] so we got the lettuce let's start
[2349.44 - 2355.52] chopping some other stuff you guys
[2351.04 - 2357.52] do red bell pepper let's do that
[2355.52 - 2358.72] red bell pepper i cut it at the top like
[2357.52 - 2360.64] that like you see
[2358.72 - 2368.08] i know i showed you these guys guys this
[2360.64 - 2371.52] 100 times
[2368.08 - 2374.24] bartonilla barnella
[2371.52 - 2375.36] babesia borrelia get killed off easy
[2374.24 - 2378.16] with antibiotics
[2375.36 - 2378.88] they're not superbugs mrsa is a superbug
[2378.16 - 2382.00] and you can
[2378.88 - 2385.68] and the cure rate for mrsa
[2382.00 - 2390.24] is is incredible it's better than lime
[2385.68 - 2390.24] isn't that funny how's that possible
[2391.44 - 2394.72] because lyme disease is viral that's how
[2393.52 - 2396.88] it's possible
[2394.72 - 2398.24] and viruses create neurotoxins and make
[2396.88 - 2400.40] people really sick
[2398.24 - 2402.56] viruses such as epstein-barr are the
[2400.40 - 2405.28] cause of lyme disease
[2402.56 - 2406.88] why do you think now right doctors have
[2405.28 - 2408.48] used so much medical medium information
[2406.88 - 2409.68] they now test for epstein-barr
[2408.48 - 2411.76] every time they actually work with
[2409.68 - 2413.60] somebody with lyme disease
[2411.76 - 2415.28] what why are you testing for
[2413.60 - 2416.56] epstein-barr no one gave a crap about
[2415.28 - 2417.84] epstein-barr before
[2416.56 - 2420.24] why are you testing for epstein-barr
[2417.84 - 2422.08] with everybody who has lyme disease
[2420.24 - 2423.68] like why are you doing that you're
[2422.08 - 2425.68] testing prep scene bar now
[2423.68 - 2427.52] everybody's testing for reactivated
[2425.68 - 2429.04] epsine bar you guys reactivated epsom
[2427.52 - 2429.44] bars medical medium information nobody
[2429.04 - 2431.60] knew it
[2429.44 - 2433.04] it reactivate it and now you can go to
[2431.60 - 2434.56] your doctor and they'll test you for
[2433.04 - 2436.96] reactivated epstein-barr
[2434.56 - 2439.84] and just so you know the reactive babies
[2436.96 - 2439.84] medical medium information
[2442.56 - 2446.64] 35 years a lot of work
[2449.52 - 2454.32] but remember i'm 28 years old
[2456.48 - 2459.92] they're always writing all the articles
[2458.16 - 2461.68] and
[2459.92 - 2463.04] and hit pieces on me and everything else
[2461.68 - 2464.56] and the internet everything
[2463.04 - 2466.64] everything everybody has all the
[2464.56 - 2469.60] information right
[2466.64 - 2469.60] i have it all wrong
[2469.84 - 2473.20] morgellons i'm going to talk about more
[2471.20 - 2476.64] gel in some day you know what i'll do a
[2473.20 - 2476.64] podcast over jones okay
[2476.88 - 2480.56] how about that i'll do a podcast on more
[2478.96 - 2482.08] jealous i'm gonna cut up some tomatoes
[2480.56 - 2484.48] right here you guys let's cut these up
[2482.08 - 2484.48] real quick
[2492.32 - 2496.16] you can get an infection from a tick
[2493.92 - 2496.16] bite
[2496.72 - 2499.84] you can get a bad rash from a staph
[2498.80 - 2502.56] infection from a
[2499.84 - 2504.64] tick bite because the tick can leave a
[2502.56 - 2505.68] little particle of its body inside your
[2504.64 - 2508.08] arm
[2505.68 - 2510.08] okay that little particle is either the
[2508.08 - 2512.72] tip of the tick the head
[2510.08 - 2513.20] if it's not totally taken out all right
[2512.72 - 2516.08] or
[2513.20 - 2516.88] a leg of the tick can be left in your
[2516.08 - 2519.44] arm
[2516.88 - 2521.28] when a foreign body is inside your body
[2519.44 - 2522.80] you will start to get an infection and
[2521.28 - 2524.24] you'll get an infection on your arm and
[2522.80 - 2526.88] that infection will
[2524.24 - 2527.52] turn into a really nice staph infection
[2526.88 - 2529.20] right there
[2527.52 - 2531.84] and yeah if you need an antibiotic for
[2529.20 - 2534.84] that i i'm totally on board
[2531.84 - 2537.84] totally on board but that's not lyme
[2534.84 - 2537.84] disease
[2550.00 - 2553.28] can i talk about collagen
[2554.16 - 2561.20] absolutely you can't build your collagen
[2557.84 - 2564.56] by taking a collagen supplement
[2561.20 - 2567.60] can i save you money by telling you that
[2564.56 - 2569.44] yeah years worth of bogus collagen
[2567.60 - 2572.08] supplements
[2569.44 - 2573.44] can only build collagen like medical
[2572.08 - 2575.04] medium information has always said and
[2573.44 - 2575.68] now that's being stolen out there and
[2575.04 - 2577.20] used
[2575.68 - 2579.68] influencers are actually talking about
[2577.20 - 2581.84] it now uh you can't build collagen
[2579.68 - 2583.36] unless you're doing leafy greens
[2581.84 - 2585.60] you have medical medium information
[2583.36 - 2588.00] leafy greens that's a way to build
[2585.60 - 2590.84] collagen
[2588.00 - 2593.84] wild blueberries that's the way to build
[2590.84 - 2593.84] collagen
[2595.04 - 2599.92] trace minerals it's a way to build
[2597.76 - 2601.36] collagen
[2599.92 - 2603.04] let's talk about a way to destroy
[2601.36 - 2604.08] collagen do you want your collagen
[2603.04 - 2605.44] ruined
[2604.08 - 2607.20] do you want your all your collagen to
[2605.44 - 2609.44] disappear do you want wrinkles fast you
[2607.20 - 2611.20] want skin all saggy and hanging early in
[2609.44 - 2612.80] your age
[2611.20 - 2615.28] then make sure you keep all your
[2612.80 - 2617.12] caffeine products going
[2615.28 - 2619.20] if you want to destroy your collagen if
[2617.12 - 2620.64] you like it you like your collagen all
[2619.20 - 2622.16] ruined and you want
[2620.64 - 2624.48] sunspots make sure you have a lot of
[2622.16 - 2626.32] chocolate because the caffeine and the
[2624.48 - 2627.84] chocolate will age you quick and destroy
[2626.32 - 2631.84] your collagen
[2627.84 - 2631.84] don't believe me fine stay on all your
[2632.84 - 2638.16] chocolate
[2635.20 - 2640.88] but that will destroy your collagen
[2638.16 - 2643.04] caffeine coffee products
[2640.88 - 2644.72] i don't care if it's mushroom coffee
[2643.04 - 2646.88] with real coffee in your mushroom coffee
[2644.72 - 2648.08] blend i don't care if it's that mlm
[2646.88 - 2650.40] thing that's going around now
[2648.08 - 2651.20] i don't care if it's the best chocolate
[2650.40 - 2653.20] 90
[2651.20 - 2654.72] which makes it even worse because it's
[2653.20 - 2656.80] more caffeine
[2654.72 - 2659.20] i don't care it's gonna it's it's gonna
[2656.80 - 2660.56] cause collagen problems collagen damage
[2659.20 - 2662.16] another thing that hurts your collagen
[2660.56 - 2665.60] is viruses
[2662.16 - 2669.56] viral loads releasing viral toxins
[2665.60 - 2671.36] dermatoxins epstein-barr
[2669.56 - 2673.76] dermadermatoxins that's another thing
[2671.36 - 2673.76] right there
[2674.16 - 2678.48] you guys how you doing if you just got
[2675.84 - 2680.48] on here watch this whole thing
[2678.48 - 2681.68] yep chocolate two people michelle
[2680.48 - 2683.76] michelle clayton
[2681.68 - 2685.20] thanks for saying that on youtube um i
[2683.76 - 2686.64] got some beautiful tomatoes here with
[2685.20 - 2691.84] these red bell peppers
[2686.64 - 2691.84] and i got some butter leaf lettuce
[2691.92 - 2696.00] sugar selena what about it
[2696.24 - 2698.96] talking about processed sugar i don't
[2697.60 - 2699.44] think anybody should be unprocessed
[2698.96 - 2701.36] sugar
[2699.44 - 2703.04] but sugar is not the problem that's not
[2701.36 - 2704.56] why people are sick
[2703.04 - 2707.12] sugar's not white people are sick that's
[2704.56 - 2710.16] a cucumber you guys
[2707.12 - 2713.36] cucumber so sugar is not why people
[2710.16 - 2715.04] are sick it's fat that's why people are
[2713.36 - 2717.04] sick it's fat
[2715.04 - 2719.28] so that's why people get sick all the
[2717.04 - 2720.48] fat in their diet
[2719.28 - 2721.76] but i don't think anybody should be on
[2720.48 - 2723.28] processed sugar i don't think that's
[2721.76 - 2726.88] good xenon looks good
[2723.28 - 2729.28] on facebook how you guys doing on
[2726.88 - 2729.28] youtube
[2731.12 - 2735.44] is technology working out okay tonight
[2732.80 - 2735.44] you guys see me
[2736.32 - 2741.76] i'm skinning this uh cucumber down a
[2739.36 - 2741.76] little bit
[2743.76 - 2748.56] so what what really hurts collagen is
[2746.40 - 2750.72] all the cookies and cakes and
[2748.56 - 2752.08] even vegan cookies just fat anything
[2750.72 - 2754.16] that's fat
[2752.08 - 2755.92] lots of fat and diets you know i'm gonna
[2754.16 - 2757.76] have avocado tonight though
[2755.92 - 2759.68] but you can overdo it you can eat too
[2757.76 - 2761.60] much avocado because it's not avocado
[2759.68 - 2763.60] really that's the biggest problem it's
[2761.60 - 2765.92] avocados plus too many nut butters plus
[2763.60 - 2768.00] too many oils plus milk cheese butter
[2765.92 - 2769.84] plus chocolate it's all the fat
[2768.00 - 2771.20] and then then things are getting really
[2769.84 - 2772.88] out of control and then now your diet's
[2771.20 - 2774.40] just fat every day it's like oh my fat i
[2772.88 - 2775.44] had fat for breakfast i had peanut
[2774.40 - 2778.32] butter smoothie
[2775.44 - 2778.96] i had peanut butter on my uh acai bowl i
[2778.32 - 2781.60] had
[2778.96 - 2783.52] chocolate on my oatmeal i had chocolate
[2781.60 - 2784.64] cacao nibs on my oatmeal i'm having all
[2783.52 - 2787.52] that fat
[2784.64 - 2789.76] um i had oil on my salad i had eggs in
[2787.52 - 2790.40] my salad i had tuna in my salads fat fat
[2789.76 - 2792.00] fat
[2790.40 - 2793.52] we fat ourselves to death that's what we
[2792.00 - 2794.80] do it's constantly it's all the time
[2793.52 - 2796.88] just lots of fat then
[2794.80 - 2798.96] i'm gonna have some bacon too or maybe
[2796.88 - 2800.96] pasta with oil maybe cheese
[2798.96 - 2802.00] cheese is fat it's just non-stop it's
[2800.96 - 2804.00] just constantly fat
[2802.00 - 2805.44] everybody's fatting themselves to death
[2804.00 - 2806.40] and then it builds up in the heart is
[2805.44 - 2807.76] what it does
[2806.40 - 2809.12] it always builds up in the heart later
[2807.76 - 2811.60] on i don't care who you are yeah you
[2809.12 - 2813.28] could live older and not have it
[2811.60 - 2814.96] take you down but you can also have it
[2813.28 - 2816.00] take you down to 50 years old you're on
[2814.96 - 2817.76] your treadmill at 50 years
[2816.00 - 2820.16] old you drop dead happens all the time
[2817.76 - 2822.32] out there you know
[2820.16 - 2823.28] and that fat just builds up and builds
[2822.32 - 2824.80] up and builds up
[2823.28 - 2826.40] and it gets inside your heart gets
[2824.80 - 2828.24] inside the valves gets inside the veins
[2826.40 - 2830.40] and the fat just builds up and builds up
[2828.24 - 2832.08] and that's a problem all on its own so
[2830.40 - 2833.52] it's not sugar's not the problem sugar
[2832.08 - 2834.16] doesn't build up in your arteries and
[2833.52 - 2835.76] your veins
[2834.16 - 2839.04] sugar can't build up in your arteries
[2835.76 - 2842.16] and veins it just can't it can't can't
[2839.04 - 2844.00] but fat can i like healthy fats hemp
[2842.16 - 2846.80] seeds avocados tahini
[2844.00 - 2848.88] sesame seeds i like healthy fat but you

[2911.44 - 2918.32] the book's so loaded it's so loaded
[2915.12 - 2918.32] cutting a cucumber right now
[2926.84 - 2929.84] so
[2931.92 - 2936.08] cucumber pieces going on top of chopped
[2933.68 - 2936.08] salad
[2938.16 - 2943.20] i'm going to cut some of these a little
[2939.44 - 2945.68] smaller so i have some smaller ones too
[2943.20 - 2945.68] there we go
[2947.92 - 2951.52] yeah angels kathy got angel's chapter
[2950.08 - 2953.92] it's it's mind-blowing so let's talk
[2951.52 - 2955.52] about blood draw a little bit
[2953.92 - 2957.60] you guys ready for this fashion your
[2955.52 - 2960.08] seatbelts i know some of you already
[2957.60 - 2963.52] know i've been talking about it already
[2960.08 - 2966.56] but just
[2963.52 - 2968.16] you might need to sit down for this i
[2966.56 - 2970.08] might need to sit down
[2968.16 - 2972.88] so when you get your blood drawn the
[2970.08 - 2974.96] doctor's office
[2972.88 - 2977.20] or at a place you get your blood drawn
[2974.96 - 2979.52] or phlebotomist comes to your home some
[2977.20 - 2983.12] people get that done that way
[2979.52 - 2984.24] um what happens is as they're drawing
[2983.12 - 2985.92] your blood
[2984.24 - 2988.08] they're removing something from you
[2985.92 - 2990.72] that's really important
[2988.08 - 2993.68] that shouldn't be removed from you so
[2990.72 - 2995.92] and what they're removing from you
[2993.68 - 2998.84] is your white count and everybody needs
[2995.92 - 3002.72] their white count desperately right now
[2998.84 - 3005.12] especially now you guys know why
[3002.72 - 3006.16] especially now you need your white count
[3005.12 - 3008.32] especially now
[3006.16 - 3010.32] so every time you get the blood draw
[3008.32 - 3011.68] they take way too much blood than they
[3010.32 - 3013.84] should
[3011.68 - 3015.44] and they keep on doing it they keep on
[3013.84 - 3016.48] doing so when you go back they do it
[3015.44 - 3018.08] again when you go back
[3016.48 - 3019.68] they do it again or the doctor orders
[3018.08 - 3021.28] for more tests and you do it again
[3019.68 - 3022.72] if you're chronically ill or chronically
[3021.28 - 3024.40] sick
[3022.72 - 3026.00] you're gonna get blood drawn from
[3024.40 - 3029.12] another specialist or somebody
[3026.00 - 3030.96] else but they'll take four vials full
[3029.12 - 3031.68] vials they'll take five full vials six
[3030.96 - 3034.16] or seven
[3031.68 - 3035.20] pretty much on any given day it's six or
[3034.16 - 3038.24] seven
[3035.20 - 3040.00] sometimes it's ten and in your blood
[3038.24 - 3041.44] is your weight count there's your white
[3040.00 - 3043.60] blood cell right there
[3041.44 - 3045.44] there's your red blood cell right there
[3043.60 - 3049.52] yeah your cbc
[3045.44 - 3053.36] your cbc your cbc see you later
[3049.52 - 3056.96] out the door see you cbc bye cbc
[3053.36 - 3060.08] yep six files seven files bye cbc see
[3056.96 - 3060.08] you later cbc
[3061.68 - 3068.16] um whoa a white blood cell on top of red
[3065.76 - 3070.64] red blood cell going out going out now
[3068.16 - 3073.36] see you later
[3070.64 - 3074.32] and what happens is when you lose your
[3073.36 - 3077.12] white blood
[3074.32 - 3078.80] count your red blood cells they take a
[3077.12 - 3082.24] long time to come back
[3078.80 - 3085.92] so after they take your blood it takes
[3082.24 - 3086.32] easy 12 weeks for your red count to come
[3085.92 - 3088.72] back
[3086.32 - 3089.52] your red blood cells will come back you
[3088.72 - 3092.80] leave
[3089.52 - 3094.08] the doctor's office empty empty
[3092.80 - 3096.00] you're still walking you're still
[3094.08 - 3098.72] talking they give you some apple
[3096.00 - 3099.12] juice maybe maybe they give you a cookie
[3098.72 - 3102.88] and
[3099.12 - 3105.60] you leave you know they might take 10 14
[3102.88 - 3108.72] vials out they might take 18 vials out
[3105.60 - 3110.40] but you end up losing your immune system
[3108.72 - 3112.08] so if you've got chronic illness of any
[3110.40 - 3115.36] kind
[3112.08 - 3117.44] you end up you end up
[3115.36 - 3118.48] losing precious reserves precious
[3117.44 - 3121.76] reserves you need
[3118.48 - 3122.64] there's a reason so i'm in the lyme
[3121.76 - 3125.04] disease section
[3122.64 - 3126.88] which is also a trigger section which is
[3125.04 - 3128.32] interesting
[3126.88 - 3129.36] triggers to lyme disease and really
[3128.32 - 3130.64] triggers to a lot of different
[3129.36 - 3134.88] conditions right
[3130.64 - 3136.00] so extensive blood draw when a larger
[3134.88 - 3141.20] number
[3136.00 - 3143.20] of blood vials are drawn
[3141.20 - 3144.80] it can be stressful on the immune system
[3143.20 - 3146.64] because the very immune
[3144.80 - 3148.72] system the very immune defenses that are
[3146.64 - 3152.40] keeping the viruses behind
[3148.72 - 3154.88] lyme symptoms fibromyalgia hashimoto's
[3152.40 - 3157.28] any kind of chronic fatigue syndrome ra
[3154.88 - 3160.24] lupus whatever it is
[3157.28 - 3162.48] the very immune system that's keeping
[3160.24 - 3165.12] the viruses behind that are keeping them
[3162.48 - 3166.64] at bay end up being drawn out of the
[3165.12 - 3169.68] body so your
[3166.64 - 3173.20] white count gets drawn out of the body
[3169.68 - 3175.20] when your blood is taken large blood
[3173.20 - 3177.36] draws tend to take away a substantial
[3175.20 - 3177.92] portion of a person's immune system that
[3177.36 - 3181.20] day
[3177.92 - 3184.08] and it sometimes takes weeks
[3181.20 - 3184.96] to rebuild these portions of the immune
[3184.08 - 3187.04] system
[3184.96 - 3188.48] within those weeks that the full power
[3187.04 - 3190.24] of your immune system is not present
[3188.48 - 3191.36] anymore to monitor your blood
[3190.24 - 3192.96] you don't have your white count
[3191.36 - 3193.60] monitoring your blood like it should
[3192.96 - 3196.96] it's not
[3193.60 - 3200.88] it's not present viruses can get
[3196.96 - 3203.20] a window to strengthen and proliferate
[3200.88 - 3204.96] infections can travel from organ organ
[3203.20 - 3207.12] with ease because there's no account to
[3204.96 - 3208.88] protect you
[3207.12 - 3210.64] because they're not being corralled by
[3208.88 - 3212.16] your white blood cells it could lead to
[3210.64 - 3214.40] flare-up symptoms
[3212.16 - 3215.28] more fatigue more problems whether a
[3214.40 - 3217.76] week later
[3215.28 - 3220.16] a few weeks later or months later i
[3217.76 - 3222.88] recommend doing smaller blood draws
[3220.16 - 3223.44] over more visits i recommend doing
[3222.88 - 3227.92] smaller
[3223.44 - 3229.52] blood draws over the more visits
[3227.92 - 3231.60] if you're struggling with lyme symptoms
[3229.52 - 3234.40] or any other condition
[3231.60 - 3235.28] labeled autoimmune so important you guys
[3234.40 - 3238.00] so important
[3235.28 - 3239.20] i recommend no more than four vials of
[3238.00 - 3242.96] blood
[3239.20 - 3246.08] at a time and even consider
[3242.96 - 3247.04] fewer if it was me i wouldn't even do
[3246.08 - 3249.36] four
[3247.04 - 3251.20] if you're strong and you feel good maybe
[3249.36 - 3253.44] you can do four
[3251.20 - 3255.76] a mistake made by well-meaning doctors
[3253.44 - 3258.00] is to draw a large number of blood vials
[3255.76 - 3261.04] with sensitive people
[3258.00 - 3264.64] and i recommend if you're sensitive
[3261.04 - 3266.80] to do less so
[3264.64 - 3268.80] why is this important because it could
[3266.80 - 3270.80] take you down
[3268.80 - 3272.64] one of the greatest holes in the medical
[3270.80 - 3273.36] system right now which i had to drop the
[3272.64 - 3275.76] bomb
[3273.36 - 3277.52] i had to let everybody know because it
[3275.76 - 3280.32] always starts with medical medium
[3277.52 - 3281.52] with the you know these incredible
[3280.32 - 3283.12] pieces of information
[3281.52 - 3285.28] and it's not me in the end it comes from
[3283.12 - 3287.44] my source is that
[3285.28 - 3289.36] there's a serious serious crime
[3287.44 - 3291.92] happening
[3289.36 - 3293.84] and it's a crime of bloodletting where
[3291.92 - 3295.36] people are losing their immune systems
[3293.84 - 3296.88] to all these blood draws
[3295.36 - 3299.36] and if you're sick with chronic illness
[3296.88 - 3300.48] and you get five six seven vials taken
[3299.36 - 3302.48] away from you
[3300.48 - 3304.16] and your immune system leaves and then
[3302.48 - 3305.68] your viral issues creep up and you're
[3304.16 - 3307.28] getting sicker then guess what the
[3305.68 - 3308.96] doctor wants you back into the office
[3307.28 - 3310.64] for another blood draw and now it's
[3308.96 - 3313.12] another seven eight vials
[3310.64 - 3315.20] and then as you get sicker again the
[3313.12 - 3318.40] specialist that he recommends for you to
[3315.20 - 3319.84] go see wants a whole new blood panel
[3318.40 - 3321.60] and they want to see your metabolic
[3319.84 - 3322.88] panel they want to see your you know
[3321.60 - 3323.68] hormone panel they want to see
[3322.88 - 3325.92] everything
[3323.68 - 3327.20] and now they want to see a cbc they want
[3325.92 - 3330.64] to see all of it and now you're getting
[3327.20 - 3332.84] a whole nother round of blood work done
[3330.64 - 3334.24] and then you never get out of your
[3332.84 - 3337.52] sickness
[3334.24 - 3340.08] they keep you in your sickness for years
[3337.52 - 3343.44] and years and years
[3340.08 - 3346.48] that's how it works lisa says what about
[3343.44 - 3349.60] donating blood for blood drives
[3346.48 - 3350.24] probably the most dangerous what i would
[3349.60 - 3351.60] say is
[3350.24 - 3354.48] if you're donating blood for blood
[3351.60 - 3358.48] drives see if you can talk to them about
[3354.48 - 3360.48] donating less at the time and going back
[3358.48 - 3362.48] again if you really want to that's
[3360.48 - 3364.16] something you want to do i'm not saying
[3362.48 - 3365.52] people shouldn't donate blood we need
[3364.16 - 3367.84] we need blood donations but if you're
[3365.52 - 3370.48] sick with chronic illness
[3367.84 - 3371.76] the person who there should be some some
[3370.48 - 3373.20] system changes where
[3371.76 - 3375.04] people who donate blood should be the
[3373.20 - 3376.40] people who aren't dealing with any
[3375.04 - 3376.72] chronic illness you're not dealing with
[3376.40 - 3379.20] an
[3376.72 - 3382.24] autoimmune label no one with autoimmune
[3379.20 - 3382.24] should be donating blood
[3382.64 - 3386.00] but people without the autoimmune label
[3384.40 - 3388.08] they can donate blood they should be the
[3386.00 - 3390.32] ones donating blood so people who
[3388.08 - 3391.76] you know are at the top of their game
[3390.32 - 3392.96] they're in good health they don't seem
[3391.76 - 3394.48] to have any problems they're not
[3392.96 - 3395.76] diagnosed with autoimmune they should be
[3394.48 - 3398.80] donating the blood
[3395.76 - 3402.56] if you know if they choose to
[3398.80 - 3405.52] but you know took 30
[3402.56 - 3408.24] 30 bikes bikes at a time you mean 30
[3405.52 - 3411.52] vials at a time
[3408.24 - 3415.28] 30 biles at a time so
[3411.52 - 3416.08] what happens is that um we lose all our
[3415.28 - 3418.08] blood
[3416.08 - 3419.20] and then that's a scary thing so it's a
[3418.08 - 3421.76] hole in the system
[3419.20 - 3422.64] a really bad hole in the system where's
[3421.76 - 3424.16] your blood going
[3422.64 - 3426.32] because here's the problem they only use
[3424.16 - 3429.36] this much so
[3426.32 - 3429.36] they only use
[3429.44 - 3434.32] that much they throw your whole violent
[3433.12 - 3436.16] blood away
[3434.32 - 3438.72] what i recommend is asking for half
[3436.16 - 3441.76] vials that's what i recommend
[3438.72 - 3443.60] asking for half files ask your doctor
[3441.76 - 3444.96] can you do half files we're going to
[3443.60 - 3449.12] take about seven vials
[3444.96 - 3452.00] of blood can you do seven half vials
[3449.12 - 3454.96] which will end up being around what
[3452.00 - 3457.28] three and a half full vials
[3454.96 - 3458.88] i would want to keep it if it was me to
[3457.28 - 3460.48] two to three vials so you tell the
[3458.88 - 3461.52] doctor it's either two to three whole
[3460.48 - 3464.56] vials
[3461.52 - 3465.52] or two to three half vials one or the
[3464.56 - 3468.16] other
[3465.52 - 3470.00] now the nurse or the doctor might say
[3468.16 - 3471.60] well the blood lab won't receive it or
[3470.00 - 3472.64] accept it that's not true the blood lab
[3471.60 - 3474.32] will accept it
[3472.64 - 3475.68] the doctor just has to send it as half
[3474.32 - 3477.76] files and the blood lab takes it and
[3475.68 - 3481.60] uses it because the blood lab knows
[3477.76 - 3484.56] they only use that much
[3481.60 - 3484.56] they only use that much
[3486.40 - 3490.32] they throw all your blood away that's
[3488.40 - 3493.28] what they do
[3490.32 - 3495.44] it's probably the most dangerous
[3493.28 - 3499.60] negligent
[3495.44 - 3503.68] unreasonable deceiving
[3499.60 - 3506.64] disturbing broken part of our system
[3503.68 - 3507.04] and when we're dealing with times like
[3506.64 - 3508.64] these
[3507.04 - 3510.16] on top of it and we're dealing with the
[3508.64 - 3511.52] fact that chronic illness is on the rise
[3510.16 - 3513.36] to such a degree
[3511.52 - 3514.56] it's critical to know how it works and
[3513.36 - 3516.32] now i'm not giving you all the
[3514.56 - 3519.28] information on blood draw
[3516.32 - 3520.40] i'm doing a podcast pretty soon i'm
[3519.28 - 3522.32] hoping next week
[3520.40 - 3523.84] it comes out is what i'm hoping i'm
[3522.32 - 3525.52] doing a podcast on this
[3523.84 - 3527.12] and the information is going to blow
[3525.52 - 3528.64] your mind wide open it's medical meeting

[3555.20 - 3559.20] crazy amounts for people who have cancer
[3557.44 - 3560.96] so when you have cancer you desperately
[3559.20 - 3563.12] need your immune cells you need your
[3560.96 - 3565.76] white count when you have cancer
[3563.12 - 3567.36] and they take all they take your blood

[3567.36 - 3570.40] blood and they take your blood and you
[3568.88 - 3572.40] don't even have an immune system because
[3570.40 - 3574.48] they're taking so much blood

[3574.48 - 3577.28] that's
[3575.44 - 3579.76] has cancer i mean they're taking all
[3577.28 - 3579.76] their blood
[3580.32 - 3584.16] and they're not using it they're
[3581.52 - 3585.60] throwing it all away
[3584.16 - 3587.04] they don't even tell you why don't we
[3585.60 - 3588.64] just take a quarter of a vial or a half
[3587.04 - 3590.08] file or do a real tiny tube and take
[3588.64 - 3591.36] half file they're throwing every bit of
[3590.08 - 3594.80] it away except for
[3591.36 - 3594.80] the smallest percentage there is
[3594.96 - 3597.44] you know what they used to do years ago
[3596.32 - 3599.20] i'll just cover this for a couple of
[3597.44 - 3600.80] minutes you guys they used to bloodlet
[3599.20 - 3602.48] everybody right when you got sick they
[3600.80 - 3604.08] would cut your arm open you bled in a
[3602.48 - 3605.68] pan and then if you didn't recover they
[3604.08 - 3607.20] cut you again if you didn't recover they
[3605.68 - 3608.88] cut you again if you got sick or from
[3607.20 - 3609.36] bleeding in a pan they cut you again cut
[3608.88 - 3611.68] you again
[3609.36 - 3613.12] cut you again and then you're dead they
[3611.68 - 3614.80] didn't stop bloodletting it's still
[3613.12 - 3615.60] happening now but it's under everybody's
[3614.80 - 3617.20] noses
[3615.60 - 3618.88] they completely fooled everybody every
[3617.20 - 3620.64] doctor every nurse they fooled everybody
[3618.88 - 3623.36] in the system and they fooled all of you
[3620.64 - 3623.76] everybody's fooled i had to drop the
[3623.36 - 3625.68] bomb
[3623.76 - 3629.84] i'm the only one to do it but i had to
[3625.68 - 3629.84] do it
[3632.16 - 3636.48] i'm gonna put some green onion on the
[3634.08 - 3636.48] salad
[3638.00 - 3640.96] i'm not saying don't get your blood
[3639.36 - 3642.56] working don't see your doctor i'm pro
[3640.96 - 3643.28] doctors i talk to doctors every single
[3642.56 - 3644.72] day
[3643.28 - 3646.88] i've helped doctors all through the last
[3644.72 - 3648.88] 30 35 years with their patients
[3646.88 - 3650.48] i was known as the bizarre symptom guy
[3648.88 - 3653.04] doctor sent people to me
[3650.48 - 3655.28] to try to find answers because i was the
[3653.04 - 3656.72] detective of all detectives because a
[3655.28 - 3658.32] spirit of compassion
[3656.72 - 3659.76] and i would find out what's wrong with
[3658.32 - 3660.72] people i'm telling you that when you go
[3659.76 - 3663.76] get your blood
[3660.72 - 3665.68] drawn you got options you tell them to
[3663.76 - 3667.60] reschedule another appointment come back
[3665.68 - 3669.52] another day and get another two vials
[3667.60 - 3671.52] you keep your immune system so you don't
[3669.52 - 3672.32] lose it so you have a chance to heal and
[3671.52 - 3675.36] you don't
[3672.32 - 3675.84] lose your life lose your health or stay
[3675.36 - 3678.08] sick
[3675.84 - 3680.16] for 20 years as they do regular blood
[3678.08 - 3682.00] draws and you stay sick for 20 years
[3680.16 - 3683.52] because your immune system can't even
[3682.00 - 3684.00] work on cleaning things up so you can
[3683.52 - 3686.00] get better
[3684.00 - 3687.76] from your epstein-barr shingles hhv-6
[3686.00 - 3688.40] cytomegalovirus streptococcus bacteria e
[3687.76 - 3691.04] coli
[3688.40 - 3694.40] the staff and everything else all right
[3691.04 - 3696.24] let's put some avocado on this
[3694.40 - 3697.84] guys which avocado should i use did you
[3696.24 - 3699.76] ever come across that were you like you
[3697.84 - 3701.44] don't know which avocado you want to use
[3699.76 - 3703.60] is it this one or this one you know like
[3701.44 - 3704.88] some look better than the others
[3703.60 - 3706.64] meaning in a sense they look like they
[3704.88 - 3709.44] might be tastier
[3706.64 - 3710.48] i like the ones that are more firm this
[3709.44 - 3712.80] one feels a little
[3710.48 - 3715.84] softer i like avocados that are more
[3712.80 - 3715.84] firm that's what i like
[3717.20 - 3720.80] you guys you guys open avocados probably
[3719.92 - 3723.60] all the time right
[3720.80 - 3725.44] whoa that's a nice one whoa whoa whoa i
[3723.60 - 3728.64] like that
[3725.44 - 3730.64] you can squeeze that pit out that's
[3728.64 - 3732.16] an option you can do the knife trick
[3730.64 - 3734.00] trick right where you hit the knife into
[3732.16 - 3735.68] it and then you twist it like that
[3734.00 - 3737.92] but you can also squeeze the pit out
[3735.68 - 3739.60] right like this
[3737.92 - 3740.96] a lot of times it doesn't squeeze out so
[3739.60 - 3743.12] you end up crushing your whole
[3740.96 - 3744.40] half avocado so you didn't know you can
[3743.12 - 3746.16] also spoon it out
[3744.40 - 3748.64] a fork you can use a fork to get it out
[3746.16 - 3748.64] too right

[3980.64 - 3983.84] they're taking your blood from you
[3982.40 - 3985.52] and they know it weakens everybody and

[3986.32 - 3989.04] with your illness
[3991.12 - 3994.72] it's about being proactive telling your
[3993.04 - 3997.60] doctor to take less blood
[3994.72 - 3999.92] tell them to take half vials and you

[4035.76 - 4038.40] little dates on here
[4036.96 - 4039.84] takes years off your life is what it
[4038.40 - 4042.48] does the blood draws that are happening
[4039.84 - 4044.08] is taking years off of everybody's life
[4042.48 - 4045.68] you know those people that live to be 95
[4044.08 - 4046.88] years old nobody knows why or how or
[4045.68 - 4048.32] what one of the reasons is they didn't
[4046.88 - 4049.52] catch a lot of bugs
[4048.32 - 4051.76] had one of those lives where they didn't
[4049.52 - 4053.52] get a lot of different viruses bacteria
[4051.76 - 4056.56] the other reason
[4053.52 - 4058.32] is they didn't go to the doctor because
[4056.56 - 4059.84] they weren't getting sick to begin with
[4058.32 - 4061.76] to get them to the doctor
[4059.84 - 4063.20] they took less blood draws a lot you
