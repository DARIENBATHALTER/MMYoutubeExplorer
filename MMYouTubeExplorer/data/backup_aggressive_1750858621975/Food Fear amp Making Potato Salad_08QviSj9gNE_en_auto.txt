[0.00 - 5.58] making a potato salad right here
[2.58 - 6.78] I'm making a potato salad I got all
[5.58 - 8.16] kinds of good stuff right here I feel
[6.78 - 10.62] like eating that for dinner tonight
[8.16 - 12.96] talking about food fear as well and
[10.62 - 14.82] we're day six of the collecting Stones
[12.96 - 16.98] meditation Journey
[14.82 - 20.04] and I see that everybody was sketching
[16.98 - 22.74] their stones that is such an incredible
[20.04 - 26.64] moment when I remember when I was
[22.74 - 28.62] sketching my Stones how it felt and what
[26.64 - 30.84] it does it really connects you to what's
[28.62 - 33.42] in the stone like all the nooks and
[30.84 - 35.28] crannies and all the crevices and all
[33.42 - 38.40] the different lines and designs and the
[35.28 - 40.74] mineral compositions and everything is
[38.40 - 43.38] there you really get to know your Stones
[40.74 - 46.26] when you're sketching them like it's a
[43.38 - 49.26] whole another level of being intimate
[46.26 - 52.08] with your Stones which is really a part
[49.26 - 54.78] of this incredible exercise and healing
[52.08 - 57.48] Journey seven day healing Journey so
[54.78 - 59.22] today is day six we're getting close I
[57.48 - 60.60] wanted to make a potato salad talk a
[59.22 - 62.28] little bit about food fear and stuff
[60.60 - 63.18] like that which is fun we'll just see
[62.28 - 65.04] you
[63.18 - 66.90] we'll see we'll cover a couple different
[65.04 - 68.88] things because I know so many people are
[66.90 - 70.38] so afraid of so many different things
[68.88 - 72.72] because they've been trained and
[70.38 - 75.90] conditioned and brainwashed out there
[72.72 - 79.14] in such a way stay away from nightshades
[75.90 - 82.26] stay away from oxalates stay away from
[79.14 - 84.30] uh lectins stay away from this and it
[82.26 - 85.98] throws you in a big spin a confusion
[84.30 - 87.48] because it's like what do I eat and
[85.98 - 89.40] every and then you go to a food
[87.48 - 91.74] allergist and now you're out of another
[89.40 - 94.38] food allergist and they're like oh stay
[91.74 - 98.04] off of this this don't eat kumquats
[94.38 - 101.52] don't eat right don't eat limes don't
[98.04 - 103.32] eat cilantro don't eat lemongrass like
[101.52 - 105.42] the craziest stuff like you got this
[103.32 - 108.96] list that's this big and and it's like
[105.42 - 110.76] but you can eat meat and you can eat
[108.96 - 112.26] this oh you're allergic to avocado
[110.76 - 114.30] you're allergic to this you're allergic
[112.26 - 116.10] to that it's crazy how that works so
[114.30 - 119.10] many people have been totally brain
[116.10 - 121.26] screwed really bad by that
[119.10 - 123.24] for so many years because here you are
[121.26 - 125.22] you're looking for help but nobody knows
[123.24 - 127.86] why you're sick they don't know why you
[125.22 - 130.68] actually have your symptoms your Tremors
[127.86 - 132.48] in your hands and your achy feet and
[130.68 - 135.12] your body that feels like you have
[132.48 - 137.82] sandbags it's bogging you down and
[135.12 - 139.74] holding you down where you have fatigue
[137.82 - 141.42] where you have brain fog that's making
[139.74 - 143.10] it so when someone talks to you you
[141.42 - 144.78] can't even talk you can't even answer
[143.10 - 147.54] them like you feel like you didn't even
[144.78 - 149.28] get your words out right and there's all
[147.54 - 151.44] that and there's plus there's OCD and
[149.28 - 152.88] depression anxiety there's confusion
[151.44 - 155.58] there's all kinds of different things
[152.88 - 157.38] that people go through there's panic
[155.58 - 159.12] attacks there's different levels of
[157.38 - 161.70] anxiety there's neurological symptoms
[159.12 - 163.92] Galore that people have tightness in the
[161.70 - 166.56] chest tighten it you know funny feelings
[163.92 - 169.50] in the stomach and aches in their jaw
[166.56 - 171.84] and pain in their neck and it just goes
[169.50 - 173.76] on and on and on and then you go and
[171.84 - 176.58] you're looking for help and you got this
[173.76 - 178.50] guy and he's like hey uh yeah we just
[176.58 - 181.38] got your results from all your tests
[178.50 - 184.74] don't eat Tony come watch don't eat
[181.38 - 185.88] oranges don't eat Sarsaparilla or
[184.74 - 187.50] whatever I mean they'll just come up
[185.88 - 190.74] with anything don't eat this this this
[187.50 - 192.24] this this stay away from stay away from
[190.74 - 194.76] this herb stay away from this spice
[192.24 - 198.42] don't have turmeric and don't have
[194.76 - 200.64] parsley in this whole list gets insane
[198.42 - 204.06] and here's what's crazy
[200.64 - 207.60] the craziest part of this back 10 years
[204.06 - 209.10] ago 10 years ago you go to the and do
[207.60 - 211.44] all those different food elimination
[209.10 - 214.38] tests 10 years ago
[211.44 - 217.02] and it was different than what they're
[214.38 - 219.06] saying eliminate now when you go and do
[217.02 - 221.10] it because
[219.06 - 223.20] the tests have always been and
[221.10 - 225.96] the reason why is that they go with the
[223.20 - 228.42] trends that's how crazy it is it's like
[225.96 - 229.98] 10 years ago they say oh you're allergic
[228.42 - 234.24] to this this this to almost everybody
[229.98 - 236.16] like and then as a few years go by and
[234.24 - 237.96] Trends start changing people are allowed
[236.16 - 239.58] to eat more fruit because medical meme
[237.96 - 241.14] broke the fruit fear
[239.58 - 242.58] and people are eating more fruit and
[241.14 - 244.20] stuff and now those tests are coming
[242.58 - 245.70] back for a lot of people and oh that's
[244.20 - 248.46] allowed that's allowed that's allowed oh
[245.70 - 252.30] what happens why is the test morphing
[248.46 - 253.68] shape-shifting into into the trend of
[252.30 - 256.26] the times I mean you're talking about
[253.68 - 258.24] like psycho that's psycho it's really
[256.26 - 261.92] crazy how it works anyway
[258.24 - 264.08] I'm making a potato salad with the scary
[261.92 - 266.70] nightshades
[264.08 - 268.74] the scary night shades so that's what
[266.70 - 270.66] we're doing and what do I have here I
[268.74 - 272.58] have a bunch of little things lemon whoa
[270.66 - 274.86] watch out lemon will kill your teeth
[272.58 - 277.38] don't have any lemon you won't have a
[274.86 - 280.02] tooth left you'll be toothless if you
[277.38 - 282.12] eat any lemon God forbid you squeeze
[280.02 - 284.10] lemon on something oh don't have your
[282.12 - 285.66] lemon water every dentist will tell you
[284.10 - 288.06] that's why your teeth are falling out
[285.66 - 289.68] really because there's a crap ton of
[288.06 - 291.60] people on this planet that are in dental
[289.68 - 293.64] chairs getting their teeth rolled and
[291.60 - 296.82] they're not doing lemon water that's
[293.64 - 297.66] amazing how it works that's how crazy it
[296.82 - 300.18] is
[297.66 - 301.62] food fear is the topic but we're on day
[300.18 - 304.08] six of the collecting Stones meditation
[301.62 - 306.78] Journey we're sketching Stones today
[304.08 - 308.94] Renata says yeah earlier today I saw a
[306.78 - 311.28] thread of women talking about doctors
[308.94 - 313.32] recommending limiting fruit always but
[311.28 - 316.20] especially in pregnancy and especially
[313.32 - 317.82] in the final trimester yeah stay away
[316.20 - 321.54] from fruit because you're pregnant
[317.82 - 324.06] that's food fear it's also fruit fear I
[321.54 - 326.52] mean how crazy is that don't eat an
[324.06 - 328.74] apple because you're pregnant huh
[326.52 - 330.72] exactly and that's the kind of stuff
[328.74 - 332.04] that's happening out there so much food
[330.72 - 333.90] Theory you know what's happening right
[332.04 - 335.40] now it's like everywhere whether it's
[333.90 - 337.02] tick tock or anywhere else it's like
[335.40 - 339.96] everybody's trying to get a rise out of
[337.02 - 342.06] somebody like know this know that know
[339.96 - 344.16] this know that it's the trend now know
[342.06 - 346.38] this no that no this no that no this
[344.16 - 348.30] right nobody knows why anybody's sick
[346.38 - 350.46] but that's the trend now too it's like
[348.30 - 353.40] food fear Galore out there
[350.46 - 355.44] is what I call it anyway
[353.40 - 357.72] Melissa says I drew my stones and it
[355.44 - 360.54] looks like three potatoes that's pretty
[357.72 - 363.18] funny it's all right I actually Drew my
[360.54 - 364.44] stones and it looked like three lumps of
[363.18 - 367.26] coal
[364.44 - 368.60] that's what it looks like right there
[367.26 - 371.52] and um
[368.60 - 373.08] look there's Michelle says some of us
[371.52 - 375.06] have food fear because we really do
[373.08 - 377.10] react though yes totally but I wasn't
[375.06 - 378.84] talking about that and I wasn't talking
[377.10 - 380.94] about that situation I'm talking about
[378.84 - 382.86] people they're sick they don't know why
[380.94 - 385.38] they're sick they're just eating
[382.86 - 386.76] whatever but you know and then they fall
[385.38 - 388.62] into the alternative you know
[386.76 - 390.36] communities and they get told stay away
[388.62 - 391.98] from an oxalate then they get told they
[390.36 - 394.44] don't even know it's gonna stay away
[391.98 - 396.00] from a lectin stay away from celery stay
[394.44 - 401.94] away from this stay away from that it's
[396.00 - 403.38] endless endless uh endless that
[401.94 - 404.76] so anyway
[403.38 - 406.68] an IG
[404.76 - 408.96] but the carbs and potatoes makes your
[406.68 - 413.16] body produce insulin and that's how you
[408.96 - 416.10] become obese and cause inflammation I
[413.16 - 418.98] wish that was accurate information but
[416.10 - 422.64] it's not accurate information
[418.98 - 424.68] carbs in potatoes don't you know make
[422.64 - 427.74] you obese that's not how it works
[424.68 - 429.42] insulin resistance is when you're eating
[427.74 - 431.10] too much fat so everybody's eating too
[429.42 - 433.38] much fat they get insulin resistance
[431.10 - 435.18] that's how it works that's why when you
[433.38 - 437.64] take somebody who has Type 2 diabetes
[435.18 - 440.34] and you start removing fried greasy food
[437.64 - 442.38] out of their diet their numbers start to
[440.34 - 444.30] level out a little better and better and
[442.38 - 446.58] improve the reason why is because
[444.30 - 448.68] they're removing hunks of fat out of
[446.58 - 450.96] their diet they're taking them out of
[448.68 - 453.24] fried Foodland which is the highest fat
[450.96 - 455.64] where it's fried foods it's the highest
[453.24 - 457.80] level of fat in your diet and when they
[455.64 - 460.68] start removing the fried greasy fried
[457.80 - 462.30] foods all of a sudden they're type 2 the
[460.68 - 464.16] numbers are a little bit better and the
[462.30 - 466.74] doctor's like whoa things are looking a
[464.16 - 468.96] little better the more fat you rid out
[466.74 - 470.58] of your diet the numbers come down and
[468.96 - 472.32] you get even better if you're type 2
[470.58 - 473.88] diabetes or you got diabetes your
[472.32 - 476.46] numbers even get better and better and
[473.88 - 478.80] better insulin resistance is all the fat
[476.46 - 480.90] not allowing the glucose which is what
[478.80 - 483.96] you need to survive to get to where it
[480.90 - 485.76] needs to go so your pancreas has to
[483.96 - 487.20] produce all this insulin the insulin
[485.76 - 489.78] just floats around in your bloodstream
[487.20 - 493.26] that's the reality like that's real
[489.78 - 495.72] information what you have is outdated BS
[493.26 - 498.12] information completely wrong across the
[495.72 - 500.46] board where you're saying a potato can
[498.12 - 503.04] actually make you obese no that's not
[500.46 - 507.80] how it works but guess what though a
[503.04 - 510.00] potato loaded with oil fat cheese butter
[507.80 - 513.06] sour cream
[510.00 - 514.80] and whatever else on top that's not
[513.06 - 516.78] going to help you because guess what
[514.80 - 518.64] it's the cheese that makes you fat guess
[516.78 - 523.20] what it's the cheese it's the butter
[518.64 - 525.96] it's the sour cream it's all that on top
[523.20 - 528.90] like that's the stuff right there you
[525.96 - 530.76] want to eat all that fat yeah that's
[528.90 - 532.44] gonna push you over the edge push your
[530.76 - 534.66] liver over the edge and push you in a
[532.44 - 536.58] bad place so here we go let's talk about
[534.66 - 538.44] the collecting Stones meditation Journey
[536.58 - 540.30] a little bit sketching Stones is what we
[538.44 - 542.52] were doing today we're talking about
[540.30 - 546.24] food fearing and out of it
[542.52 - 549.92] but let's start making a salad
[546.24 - 549.92] so I got a bowl right here
[550.62 - 555.30] and what I'll do is I think I'll place
[552.72 - 558.30] it right here for the moment let me chop
[555.30 - 560.82] up some greens let me get some lettuce
[558.30 - 562.56] going here's some gorgeous lettuce right
[560.82 - 565.38] here can I show this to you guys right
[562.56 - 569.36] here it's a green leaf lettuce
[565.38 - 569.36] there it is you guys see
[570.18 - 573.84] I'm gonna chop some of it up I'm not
[571.92 - 576.90] gonna make it so fine and I'm not going
[573.84 - 578.46] to make pieces too too big either not
[576.90 - 579.86] going to do that either so it's going to
[578.46 - 582.06] be like in between
[579.86 - 585.74] I think that's actually pretty good
[582.06 - 585.74] right there pop that in here
[585.78 - 589.82] so I'm making a quick potato salad
[590.36 - 597.92] I might have chopped that up a little
[592.74 - 597.92] too a little too fine there there we go
[599.10 - 603.24] getting some lettuce together
[601.56 - 604.92] how many of you guys been down the road
[603.24 - 607.44] of food beer
[604.92 - 609.48] scared to death of oxalates scared to
[607.44 - 611.58] death of a lectin scared to death of a
[609.48 - 613.98] potato a Nightshade don't know where
[611.58 - 618.18] you're going the whole Health industry
[613.98 - 620.94] had demonized sugar to such a point when
[618.18 - 623.22] we need sugar it's what runs our brain
[620.94 - 624.84] and muscles you have to have sugar why
[623.22 - 627.06] do you think the carnivore people where
[624.84 - 630.06] they were experimenting and they were
[627.06 - 633.24] just doing eating muscle meat and eggs
[630.06 - 635.46] and organ meats and then guess what see
[633.24 - 637.14] you later alligator
[635.46 - 638.40] so I'm chopping up some lettuce right
[637.14 - 641.36] here
[638.40 - 641.36] getting in here
[642.96 - 645.92] making a salad
[648.68 - 653.00] guys hold on one second here
[655.50 - 661.20] one of my stones
[658.08 - 663.78] one of my Stones right here
[661.20 - 668.96] but I think I have my other Stones too I
[663.78 - 668.96] will find them they're temporarily lost
[670.26 - 672.98] here we go
[674.70 - 680.28] Tyler lion says just out of the shower
[676.92 - 682.88] with my Stones just in time for mm live
[680.28 - 686.28] just in time
[682.88 - 690.72] your Stones probably feel nice and fresh
[686.28 - 693.06] freshly washed Dr fun I drew I drew my
[690.72 - 694.62] Stones they look sketchy
[693.06 - 696.78] indeed
[694.62 - 699.48] I believe that I believe that
[696.78 - 701.94] it's like the carnivore people right
[699.48 - 704.16] check this out
[701.94 - 706.62] they start out where I'm just gonna eat
[704.16 - 708.24] meat only this isn't about anti-meat
[706.62 - 710.64] this isn't about anti-plant base that's
[708.24 - 712.74] not it so if you if you don't know
[710.64 - 714.30] medical medium information and you're
[712.74 - 715.62] listening you might get confused for a
[714.30 - 718.40] second be like what's he talking about
[715.62 - 718.40] Okay so
[719.70 - 724.34] the organ Meats in eggs and muscle meat
[722.22 - 727.02] like the carnivore guys started doing
[724.34 - 729.36] you end up starving your brain
[727.02 - 731.82] and it gets no glucose and you end up
[729.36 - 733.56] getting sick they won't really tell
[731.82 - 735.18] anybody that's what's happening but then
[733.56 - 737.04] what happens is you end up bringing
[735.18 - 739.68] honey in so the carnivore people brought
[737.04 - 742.50] honey in now that's funny so Oregon
[739.68 - 746.40] meets animal just a muscle animal tissue
[742.50 - 748.08] organ Meats and eggs and now we're
[746.40 - 750.54] bringing in honey so it was a whole
[748.08 - 752.22] couple of years of that BS where the
[750.54 - 754.38] carnivore guys were bringing in Honey
[752.22 - 755.94] and then they were you know telling
[754.38 - 757.98] people what they're doing and how oh
[755.94 - 759.36] autoimmune it beats autoimmune it does
[757.98 - 760.32] all this stuff they had to bring in
[759.36 - 763.02] honey

[792.72 - 795.36] the same time that we're following you
[794.04 - 797.22] that did the same thing so they're
[795.36 - 798.24] learning on your little experiment while
[797.22 - 800.82] you're learning on your little
[798.24 - 802.92] experiment Gina says I lost 35 pounds
[800.82 - 805.70] eating potatoes three times a day thanks
[802.92 - 808.98] to Medical medium
[805.70 - 811.44] and someone believes that the potatoes
[808.98 - 814.20] will make you obese
[811.44 - 817.98] and destroy your blood sugar your
[814.20 - 820.38] insulin resistance will get crazy
[817.98 - 821.76] these are collard greens if you want to
[820.38 - 823.62] know
[821.76 - 825.00] fresh out of the garden right there got
[823.62 - 827.40] some collard greens I'm just showing you

[827.40 - 833.28] making a potato salad evil potato salad
[831.24 - 835.26] a man over there in IG says I've been
[833.28 - 838.14] eating potatoes for every meal since
[835.26 - 839.90] January and I have not become obese nor
[838.14 - 843.00] diabetic
[839.90 - 845.70] indeed indeed indeed so what I'm doing
[843.00 - 847.56] is I'm gonna finely chop up these
[845.70 - 849.66] collard greens in this salad okay
[847.56 - 851.88] because I don't want them in big hunky
[849.66 - 853.44] pieces so I want to chop them up a
[851.88 - 854.76] little bit more finely so if you guys
[853.44 - 857.28] don't mind I'm just going to do a little
[854.76 - 860.04] this and I know I'm talking at the same
[857.28 - 863.64] time so I got to be careful right
[860.04 - 865.92] just a quick quick Chop on this I wanna
[863.64 - 868.70] I wanna get them a little bit

[869.52 - 874.20] Marissa spiritual said on IG had all my
[872.52 - 876.06] teeth drilled and never drank lemon
[874.20 - 877.86] water in my life since having lemon
[876.06 - 879.66] water every day with medical medium info
[877.86 - 881.34] my enamel is coming back and healing
[879.66 - 884.28] because
[881.34 - 886.74] lemon water helps to kill the bad
[884.28 - 887.82] bacteria in the mouth around the gums
[886.74 - 890.10] and teeth
[887.82 - 892.14] and it doesn't hurt teeth
[890.10 - 894.38] it doesn't but you know what destroys
[892.14 - 894.38] teeth
[894.84 - 899.22] acetic acid
[896.88 - 900.06] ooh man takes teeth out like nobody's

[1102.86 - 1106.04] healing from the medical medium
[1104.30 - 1107.96] information and protocols all around the
[1106.04 - 1110.72] world to such a degree that it pissed
[1107.96 - 1112.22] off a lot of Industries it pissed off a
[1110.72 - 1113.66] lot of people
[1112.22 - 1115.70] um it pissed off people in the health
[1113.66 - 1117.14] realm I mean you guys know I mean look

[1122.06 - 1125.78] against the medical medium Community
[1123.26 - 1128.06] right that you guys may be aware of that
[1125.78 - 1130.76] happen like it's it's been like this

[1130.76 - 1136.52] success of people healing I would be
[1133.28 - 1138.20] nobody or nothing because whatever it is
[1136.52 - 1140.30] like meaning like I would no one even
[1138.20 - 1142.82] know my name who is that guy and what
[1140.30 - 1144.86] happened in the last 35 years is peop
[1142.82 - 1148.16] before the books even came out people
[1144.86 - 1150.68] knew my name because of the protocols
[1148.16 - 1152.90] and the information I worked with a lot
[1150.68 - 1155.48] of people helping them heal all through
[1152.90 - 1157.52] the industry even before the books came
[1155.48 - 1159.14] out it's why I was World known for it

[1342.98 - 1346.58] from the Epstein-Barr virus entering

[1443.54 - 1448.16] because how the hell is it possible to
[1446.24 - 1450.44] keep eight large medical textbooks

[1465.08 - 1468.62] this one year it's this six months later
[1467.00 - 1470.00] it's this they say this but they say
[1468.62 - 1471.56] that they do this but they do that

[1540.38 - 1543.82] liking the fact that I hear a voice

[1547.52 - 1552.50] trying to just wreak havoc
[1550.40 - 1554.66] on AW and everything because they just
[1552.50 - 1556.40] can't stand it
[1554.66 - 1559.34] all right so let's keep on going you

[1570.62 - 1574.64] have to leave my Stones tomorrow let's
[1572.36 - 1577.64] not think about it too much tonight
[1574.64 - 1577.64] no
[1579.68 - 1582.62] no no
[1580.66 - 1586.28] there's nothing about it too much

[1593.78 - 1598.94] all right so okay
[1597.32 - 1601.76] all right
[1598.94 - 1604.10] let's figure this out I have a salad
[1601.76 - 1606.20] building
[1604.10 - 1608.92] I am going to put some potatoes in there
[1606.20 - 1608.92] if that's okay
[1609.26 - 1613.82] potatoes
[1612.14 - 1616.22] what I'm doing is I'm cutting it like
[1613.82 - 1617.72] this so if you look I sectioned them
[1616.22 - 1619.58] into like that
[1617.72 - 1621.44] so they're
[1619.58 - 1623.90] that's how you cut them so I'm going to
[1621.44 - 1625.40] do this do you like your potato pieces
[1623.90 - 1626.90] in your potato salads do you like them
[1625.40 - 1629.18] bigger or smaller
[1626.90 - 1630.86] if you were a guest in the kitchen in
[1629.18 - 1632.66] this moment right here with your guest
[1630.86 - 1634.16] kitchen right here anyway but if you
[1632.66 - 1636.08] were sitting here
[1634.16 - 1638.12] I would say do you do like hunky
[1636.08 - 1639.56] potatoes do you like them not hunky do
[1638.12 - 1641.36] you like them chopped a little smaller
[1639.56 - 1644.36] that's what I would ask you guys
[1641.36 - 1648.32] all right so um I'm not gonna make them
[1644.36 - 1651.86] too big I I like them about that size
[1648.32 - 1654.80] I don't like them super hunky
[1651.86 - 1657.20] pop those on top just like that
[1654.80 - 1659.80] boom let's get another one
[1657.20 - 1659.80] nice
[1661.64 - 1665.66] instead of throwing fruit in the air
[1663.50 - 1666.82] like I like to do I was just um flipping
[1665.66 - 1669.38] a potato
[1666.82 - 1670.88] okay so I'm gonna do the same thing the
[1669.38 - 1672.74] same kind of cutting action are you guys

[2078.28 - 2082.54] the whole tomato hate thing I fought for

[2082.54 - 2087.82] say oh aw's restrictive uh medical means
[2085.72 - 2089.32] restrictive
[2087.82 - 2092.26] are you kidding
[2089.32 - 2094.84] I I spend decades trying to break all
[2092.26 - 2097.66] the fear around a darn tomato all the
[2094.84 - 2100.30] fear around nightshades and potatoes
[2097.66 - 2103.36] all if you're around fruit
[2100.30 - 2106.42] the health movement if you got sick 15
[2103.36 - 2108.64] years ago or 18 years ago or 20 years
[2106.42 - 2109.78] ago if you got sick then I just have to
[2108.64 - 2113.02] tell you guys
[2109.78 - 2115.12] you would run across the Nightshade fear
[2113.02 - 2118.06] where they would bury it into your brain
[2115.12 - 2120.76] you would run across the Tomato hate the
[2118.06 - 2122.44] potato hate the pepper hate the eggplant
[2120.76 - 2124.54] hate then you would run across all the
[2122.44 - 2126.40] fruit fear you'd be totally screwed on
[2124.54 - 2128.38] the whole fruit for your thing then he
[2126.40 - 2129.82] would run across the gorgeous Foods then
[2128.38 - 2131.26] he would rot across the cruciferous
[2129.82 - 2133.90] exactly because that you would run
[2131.26 - 2135.82] across all of this times 10 plus
[2133.90 - 2137.02] oxalates and everything else and you
[2135.82 - 2139.42] would be literally not eating anything

[2360.34 - 2364.78] January and I kept them with me since
[2362.50 - 2366.76] but there is no comparison with the
[2364.78 - 2370.06] attachment that grew with these three
[2366.76 - 2371.80] now exactly I did put them aside right
[2370.06 - 2373.60] before starting this journey and I was
[2371.80 - 2375.52] planning on picking them back up and
[2373.60 - 2377.38] doing the same thing we just did in
[2375.52 - 2380.08] these seven days because I don't feel

[2406.00 - 2409.54] potato salad I'm gonna kind of like I
[2408.28 - 2411.28] like drizzling just a little bit
[2409.54 - 2412.90] sometimes not all the time but for this
[2411.28 - 2415.06] one I want to do that tonight I'm in the
[2412.90 - 2417.10] mood for that and I'm gonna put squeeze
[2415.06 - 2419.56] some lemon and squeeze a lime that's a
[2417.10 - 2424.12] ripe lime right there
[2419.56 - 2426.22] Angels 444 blessed I've definitely felt
[2424.12 - 2429.28] a shift but I feel Darkness keeps
[2426.22 - 2431.94] pulling me down thank God I Rise quickly
[2429.28 - 2435.10] yeah I'm gonna rise up
[2431.94 - 2437.32] look there's a lot of fork tongue Devils
[2435.10 - 2439.30] out there and they're spewing they're
[2437.32 - 2442.30] evil and they're spearing their Darkness
[2439.30 - 2445.00] there's a lot of activity out there a
[2442.30 - 2448.78] lot of Darkness has a lot of that I
[2445.00 - 2451.54] notice every time we rise up and we do
[2448.78 - 2453.58] even better and we rise up and we do
[2451.54 - 2455.86] even better better for the community
[2453.58 - 2457.84] better it was like when the light blast
[2455.86 - 2460.66] happened all you heard was Fork tongue
[2457.84 - 2463.54] devil spewing hatred everywhere on
[2460.66 - 2467.20] Instagram and everything so yeah he's
[2463.54 - 2468.46] bad he's terrible this is a slight blast
[2467.20 - 2471.34] thing and they're just spewing it's
[2468.46 - 2473.44] almost like it's kind of like vampires
[2471.34 - 2475.60] right when the sunlight goes through the
[2473.44 - 2477.82] window and the vampires they don't get
[2475.60 - 2479.50] into their coffins in time they just
[2477.82 - 2481.30] start going and their fangs come out
[2479.50 - 2483.70] right well that's what's happening I'm
[2481.30 - 2485.14] noticing the hater clubs against the
[2483.70 - 2487.96] medical medium which are plenty of them
[2485.14 - 2489.76] they just freak out as the as the light
[2487.96 - 2491.08] hits them the light blast caused a lot
[2489.76 - 2492.88] of it so what I'm saying is if you're
[2491.08 - 2496.54] rising up because that's what I do right
[2492.88 - 2498.34] I Rise Up and then you do better and you
[2496.54 - 2500.38] do better for people you do you're
[2498.34 - 2501.88] working on your healing process you're

[2504.10 - 2507.64] this stuff and then Darkness loves to be
[2505.78 - 2510.78] like no no you're not allowed to do that

[3104.58 - 3108.84] talking about food fear today we're on
[3107.16 - 3112.34] day six of the the medical medium
[3108.84 - 3112.34] collecting Stones meditation Journey
[3112.56 - 3117.60] but as you can see
[3114.66 - 3120.66] don't have food fear
[3117.60 - 3123.78] myself personally as I'm enjoying this
[3120.66 - 3127.56] incredible meal
[3123.78 - 3129.98] that has all these powerful leafy greens
[3127.56 - 3133.38] but it has tomatoes
[3129.98 - 3136.14] potatoes collard greens
[3133.38 - 3138.78] right Dinosaur Kale
[3136.14 - 3141.24] so much food for you around onions
[3138.78 - 3142.56] so much food for around lemons people
[3141.24 - 3145.02] being told they're not gonna have teeth
[3142.56 - 3147.96] left because of lemons that's so so
[3145.02 - 3153.02] wrong so wrong
[3147.96 - 3153.02] for something that's so right so right
[3153.18 - 3157.86] I mean seriously
[3155.22 - 3159.36] so no there's no fear here that's the
[3157.86 - 3163.62] whole point medical meme information
[3159.36 - 3166.14] brought back these from the dead
[3163.62 - 3168.12] from the dead
[3166.14 - 3171.60] you guys I don't know if you've been
[3168.12 - 3174.38] around enough long enough right
[3171.60 - 3174.38] I forgot
[3176.64 - 3183.00] forgot the cayenne pepper
[3179.64 - 3185.78] I knew I was missing something I knew I
[3183.00 - 3185.78] was missing something
[3187.62 - 3192.24] I forgot the cayenne pepper on top of my
[3190.20 - 3195.84] potato salad
[3192.24 - 3198.30] whoa nightshade
[3195.84 - 3201.62] scary
[3198.30 - 3201.62] that sounds sarcastic
[3203.22 - 3206.54] am I being sarcastic
[3209.04 - 3214.02] okay I want to put some cayenne pepper
[3211.74 - 3216.80] on the salad
[3214.02 - 3216.80] all right
[3217.02 - 3221.76] but that's the thing
[3218.88 - 3224.34] seriously seriously
[3221.76 - 3226.44] truly seriously
[3224.34 - 3229.50] the amount of brain screw that's
[3226.44 - 3231.90] happened in the health movement
[3229.50 - 3233.22] is unprecedented it's been totally it's
[3231.90 - 3237.42] so
[3233.22 - 3240.50] so insane so insane so many people
[3237.42 - 3240.50] struggling for so long
[3240.84 - 3244.56] santara's healing good to see you over
[3242.58 - 3248.34] there on YouTube amazing so you're
[3244.56 - 3251.04] saying was so funny 144 days on the
[3248.34 - 3253.02] potato mono eating cleanse healed all my
[3251.04 - 3256.32] gut issues and so many other symptoms
[3253.02 - 3258.92] and a family member tells me quote
[3256.32 - 3263.46] careful they put holes in your stomach
[3258.92 - 3265.92] misinformation is wild indeed it is
[3263.46 - 3266.88] it really is wild
[3265.92 - 3269.90] um
[3266.88 - 3269.90] cayenne pepper
[3271.62 - 3278.16] for some reason that cayenne pepper
[3274.80 - 3280.56] way hotter than I thought that would be
[3278.16 - 3284.12] it's so hot I'm gonna try to look for
[3280.56 - 3284.12] spots that have no pepper
[3287.52 - 3292.68] that's good
[3289.68 - 3292.68] okay
[3294.96 - 3300.24] on IG
[3297.66 - 3302.34] Terry Hillman says can you cleanse while
[3300.24 - 3306.18] breastfeeding and still keep your milk
[3302.34 - 3309.54] supply what keeps milk supply
[3306.18 - 3311.34] first of all you want clean milk supply
[3309.54 - 3315.48] anything you're cleansing out of your
[3311.34 - 3317.82] body is making your milk cleaner
[3315.48 - 3320.76] so when you're breastfeeding you're
[3317.82 - 3322.80] giving your baby cleaner milk
[3320.76 - 3325.32] the more toxins that come out of your
[3322.80 - 3327.42] body the less toxic milk there will be
[3325.32 - 3329.22] that's one thing another thing that's
[3327.42 - 3331.56] really important is
[3329.22 - 3333.78] is cleansing isn't
[3331.56 - 3335.22] unless you're doing some crazy cleanse
[3333.78 - 3336.72] out there that's not MediCal medium if
[3335.22 - 3338.94] you're doing like water fasting while
[3336.72 - 3340.86] trying to breastfeed that you're going
[3338.94 - 3344.06] to lose your milk
[3340.86 - 3344.06] you're going to lose your milk
[3344.28 - 3347.76] if you're eating a carnivore diet where
[3346.20 - 3350.16] it's just all animal protein only you're
[3347.76 - 3353.22] going to lose your milk
[3350.16 - 3357.92] because the milk is lactose
[3353.22 - 3357.92] right it's glucose sorry it's glucose
[3357.96 - 3361.68] sugar is in the milk it's critical sugar
[3359.94 - 3364.08] and carbohydrates is what the human
[3361.68 - 3366.80] body's milk is mostly made out of making
[3364.08 - 3366.80] sure that's clear
[3367.68 - 3372.06] because that's really what it's about
[3369.24 - 3375.84] it's about making sure your milk is high
[3372.06 - 3377.94] in sugar high in carbohydrate high in
[3375.84 - 3379.98] glucose critical because that's what
[3377.94 - 3383.28] builds the baby's brain that's what
[3379.98 - 3386.34] builds the baby's muscles that is a big
[3383.28 - 3389.64] part of all of it if the breast milk is
[3386.34 - 3392.46] lacking sugar the baby starves
[3389.64 - 3394.50] essentially or the baby has problems
[3392.46 - 3396.90] that's the whole point so if you take
[3394.50 - 3399.66] out all your fruit and you take out
[3396.90 - 3401.94] potatoes and you take out all of that we
[3399.66 - 3404.16] get in trouble right but if we cleanse
[3401.94 - 3406.32] and do some crazy cleanse like a juice
[3404.16 - 3409.20] fast where it's nothing but these juices
[3406.32 - 3411.36] then yeah that's not good
[3409.20 - 3412.74] for the breast milk there won't be
[3411.36 - 3414.96] enough glucose there won't be enough
[3412.74 - 3417.30] carbs inside the breast milk breast milk
[3414.96 - 3419.58] is mostly sugar and only a little bit of
[3417.30 - 3421.92] protein and only a little bit of fat
[3419.58 - 3424.38] that's what breast milk is
[3421.92 - 3426.54] human breast milk is a little bit of
[3424.38 - 3428.76] protein a little bit of fat and then a
[3426.54 - 3432.06] lot of sugar so in the sense essentially
[3428.76 - 3433.68] it's sugar water for the baby
[3432.06 - 3435.66] and that's what breast milk is made out
[3433.68 - 3437.46] of so if you're doing a medical medium
[3435.66 - 3440.70] cleanse you're obviously getting food
[3437.46 - 3443.64] and ample amounts of glucose
[3440.70 - 3446.82] because mircomium cleanses don't starve
[3443.64 - 3449.04] a person they don't starve a person
[3446.82 - 3450.66] they don't underfeed that's the whole
[3449.04 - 3453.54] point these cleanses are geared so you
[3450.66 - 3456.12] can cleanse heal still provide enough
[3453.54 - 3458.34] for all all that your body needs the
[3456.12 - 3462.02] glucose for your brain all of it for
[3458.34 - 3462.02] your liver and all that's happening
[3466.08 - 3471.14] guys I'm like multi
[3467.78 - 3471.14] multitasking everywhere
[3474.00 - 3478.32] yep
[3475.74 - 3480.84] human breast milk is mostly sugar it's
[3478.32 - 3482.78] supposed to be
[3480.84 - 3485.52] I'll try to make it as clear as I can
[3482.78 - 3488.18] not muddy up the water
[3485.52 - 3488.18] so good
[3488.94 - 3492.14] such a good salad so anyway
[3492.60 - 3496.02] just to kind of finish up on the food
[3494.04 - 3499.56] for your thing
[3496.02 - 3501.30] um I just want to say that
[3499.56 - 3502.98] I do feel sorry for so many people
[3501.30 - 3504.12] throughout the decades throughout the
[3502.98 - 3506.58] years
[3504.12 - 3509.04] that have been thrown off course
[3506.58 - 3511.80] with fruit fear
[3509.04 - 3513.72] food fear food confusion
[3511.80 - 3514.92] and at the same time not knowing why
[3513.72 - 3517.46] they're sick and not knowing what's
[3514.92 - 3517.46] wrong with them
[3517.68 - 3521.88] then catastrophic catastrophic on
[3520.38 - 3523.80] humankind
[3521.88 - 3526.44] in the health movement world
[3523.80 - 3530.10] and what has happened
[3526.44 - 3531.90] and what one of the big fear makers
[3530.10 - 3533.94] is protein right you're not getting
[3531.90 - 3535.86] enough protein you need protein you need
[3533.94 - 3538.44] protein puts people in fear and Chaos
[3535.86 - 3539.76] your body's gonna fall apart you're sick
[3538.44 - 3541.32] because you don't have enough protein
[3539.76 - 3543.90] that's crazy because that's all people
[3541.32 - 3545.88] have ever eaten
[3543.90 - 3547.92] that's all they've ever eaten all these
[3545.88 - 3549.72] decades and years and years and decades
[3547.92 - 3551.52] is plenty of protein that's the whole
[3549.72 - 3554.22] point and they got sick and they were
[3551.52 - 3555.60] sick you can be a plant-based person and
[3554.22 - 3557.34] you're eating too much soy protein
[3555.60 - 3559.32] you're eating up you're eating way too
[3557.34 - 3561.60] much nuts you're eating you can still
[3559.32 - 3562.98] get yourself you can get tons of protein
[3561.60 - 3565.20] and still be sick because what I'm
[3562.98 - 3567.66] saying is protein
[3565.20 - 3569.16] isn't the answer it never was the answer
[3567.66 - 3571.32] I've talked about this for years I've
[3569.16 - 3573.74] written about it in the medical medium
[3571.32 - 3573.74] book series
[3574.02 - 3580.14] the amount of food fear has been
[3577.32 - 3582.66] truly at a level
[3580.14 - 3584.82] especially in the health room
[3582.66 - 3586.32] truly at a level that's confused and
[3584.82 - 3588.66] completely thrown people off their game
[3586.32 - 3592.68] they're healing for years and decades
[3588.66 - 3593.94] and that includes like the cruciferous
[3592.68 - 3596.22] right
[3593.94 - 3599.24] and it includes also the night shades
[3596.22 - 3599.24] and the oxalates
[3600.36 - 3606.00] and the lectins and much more and
[3603.42 - 3608.04] includes it all and it's thrown just
[3606.00 - 3611.84] people into
[3608.04 - 3611.84] confusion while they're trying to heal
[3612.54 - 3618.30] creative artery says
[3615.48 - 3620.64] I have histamine intolerance and Mast
[3618.30 - 3624.00] Cell Activation disorder and it's hard
[3620.64 - 3627.02] to not fear food my body hates me I also
[3624.00 - 3627.02] try to be vegan
[3627.42 - 3631.98] our bodies love us unconditionally
[3630.42 - 3634.32] they
[3631.98 - 3636.36] are fighting for us they're working for
[3634.32 - 3638.40] us
[3636.36 - 3640.50] and then when we pick up pathogens along
[3638.40 - 3642.54] the way because
[3640.50 - 3644.46] the industries put the pathogens out
[3642.54 - 3647.34] there you know that now more than ever
[3644.46 - 3649.44] before just in the last three years
[3647.34 - 3651.24] but the industries put pathogens out
[3649.44 - 3652.98] there and then people have these
[3651.24 - 3655.26] pathogens these pathogens create a lot
[3652.98 - 3656.58] of problems we get sick our bodies try
[3655.26 - 3660.30] to fight for it but we have to give our
[3656.58 - 3662.76] body what it needs to fight for us
[3660.30 - 3664.92] healing with Holly 144 says I tried to
[3662.76 - 3667.62] warn my stepbrother about the carnivore
[3664.92 - 3670.14] diet and he said they are bringing more
[3667.62 - 3671.88] fruit and raw honey in now because they
[3670.14 - 3674.52] need some glucose and I thought that
[3671.88 - 3677.46] came from aw it did come from aw that's
[3674.52 - 3680.88] where it exactly came from so the carna
[3677.46 - 3683.40] carnivore the carnivore boys
[3680.88 - 3685.14] out there right on YouTube and
[3683.40 - 3686.34] everywhere else are using medical medium
[3685.14 - 3688.68] information
[3686.34 - 3690.84] because it's exactly what I predicted
[3688.68 - 3693.06] for them I predicted they would all hit
[3690.84 - 3695.70] the wall and they did
[3693.06 - 3698.40] all the carnivore dudes out there
[3695.70 - 3701.88] yelling about how great their diet was
[3698.40 - 3704.10] just eat organ Meats just eat eggs only
[3701.88 - 3705.96] and they all hit the wall and I said
[3704.10 - 3709.56] they would hit the wall years ago
[3705.96 - 3713.06] and they did it was exactly as predicted
[3709.56 - 3716.64] by SOC and they hit the freaking wall
[3713.06 - 3718.62] boom like that and guess what
[3716.64 - 3720.06] they're eating honey like no tomorrow
[3718.62 - 3721.44] and they're eating fruit like no
[3720.06 - 3722.94] tomorrow because they can't even talk
[3721.44 - 3724.86] those guys are like they've lost their
[3722.94 - 3726.48] minds because they got no glucose and
[3724.86 - 3727.80] they knew it they felt the brain fog
[3726.48 - 3730.26] come over them and they're like my
[3727.80 - 3732.36] carnivore died isn't really helping me I
[3730.26 - 3734.46] have to go do my workout now I don't
[3732.36 - 3737.22] know what'd you say man I forgot wait
[3734.46 - 3739.68] what I hey medical medium talked about
[3737.22 - 3742.26] glucose in the brain has to need it okay
