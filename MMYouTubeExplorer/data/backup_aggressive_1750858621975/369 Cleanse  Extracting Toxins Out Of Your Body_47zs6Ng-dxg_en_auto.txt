[354.92 - 359.28] you know the varicose veins thing is a
[356.68 - 361.52] big deal I hear that a lot with the
[359.28 - 363.64] cleansing the heel book and the
[361.52 - 367.12] different cleanses in there I hear that
[363.64 - 370.04] a lot with the 369 where varicose veins
[367.12 - 372.84] back down they heal they start going
[370.04 - 374.68] away spider veins back down and start
[372.84 - 377.12] going away that's a big deal for a lot
[374.68 - 379.20] of people like spider veins that that
[377.12 - 381.32] that really bothers a lot of people
[379.20 - 383.44] spider veins get like they get out of
[381.32 - 385.60] control and they're all over the ankles
[383.44 - 387.32] and they're all over the calf and
[385.60 - 389.12] they're all over the shin and they're
[387.32 - 390.76] all over the knee and the spider veins
[389.12 - 393.60] or everything everywhere they show up
[390.76 - 398.56] like spiders you know on somebody's
[393.60 - 400.76] body to get rid of that without surgery
[398.56 - 402.92] to get rid of varicose veins without
[400.76 - 404.20] surgery I mean there's people that go
[402.92 - 407.12] and they're just getting their their
[404.20 - 408.52] legs cut open and they're doing you know
[407.12 - 411.04] and then or they're doing electronic
[408.52 - 413.20] surgeries where all this where that
[411.04 - 415.76] whole thing is brutal and then all of a
[413.20 - 417.44] sudden they all come back it's important
[415.76 - 420.32] that we get toxins out of us it's
[417.44 - 422.44] important that we cleanse the poison out
[420.32 - 425.32] so that we can do some healing this
[422.44 - 427.20] matters it really does getting your life
[425.32 - 430.52] back getting back on track moving
[427.20 - 433.44] forward come on it's the new year we can
[430.52 - 436.84] do this we can heal we have the tools we
[433.44 - 439.80] have what it takes sense over there 369
[436.84 - 442.56] took away a lot of the patterns which
[439.80 - 447.40] were so so
[442.56 - 450.76] toxic duly noted duly noted that's a big
[447.40 - 454.32] deal that's a really big deal deal this
[450.76 - 456.80] matters to me okay this is why I do what
[454.32 - 458.80] I do wake up in the morning I do it over
[456.80 - 460.64] again I don't care I'll push through
[458.80 - 464.24] I'll fight for it I don't care about the
[460.64 - 466.36] hassles and the hate or the jealousy
[464.24 - 469.00] that's out there the sabotage or
[466.36 - 471.96] whatever because nobody no the world
[469.00 - 474.84] doesn't want that many people healed
[471.96 - 478.24] don't get fooled don't get fooled it
[474.84 - 480.36] doesn't it doesn't want a large swath of
[478.24 - 482.60] people on the planet here

[482.60 - 487.60] healed here a few people he healed here
[485.76 - 488.52] the world doesn't mind that the powers
[487.60 - 491.08] at
[488.52 - 492.96] be the darkness the evildoers on the
[491.08 - 496.36] planet they don't mind a few people
[492.96 - 499.36] healing here a few people healing there
[496.36 - 501.40] but they don't want a large large large
[499.36 - 504.64] crew of people healing like in the
[501.40 - 508.20] medical medium communities where massive
[504.64 - 511.08] amounts of people have healed and turned
[508.20 - 513.52] their lives around and in the jealousy
[511.08 - 515.96] and in the health field that's a whole
[513.52 - 517.88] another level you know what happened
[515.96 - 520.32] with medical me this book right here
[517.88 - 523.80] okay this book right here was brought
[520.32 - 528.00] into every doctor's office around the
[523.80 - 529.60] globe millions and millions of copies of
[528.00 - 531.44] this book right here went into people's
[529.60 - 533.16] hands all around the world and they
[531.44 - 535.20] walked into their doctor's offices and
[533.16 - 536.76] they're like look at this because nobody
[535.20 - 538.96] knew anything about pathogens and
[536.76 - 540.56] viruses and what in the upen bar how it
[538.96 - 543.00] actually caused neurological problems
[540.56 - 545.44] nobody knew that I'm sorry but nobody

[545.44 - 550.80] problems that's medical medium that's
[548.64 - 552.68] Spirit of compassion right I can't take
[550.80 - 554.92] the full credit for that at all I'm I'm
[552.68 - 557.84] the messenger but the point is is that's
[554.92 - 560.16] medical medium information and then

[663.44 - 668.12] down and we just can't seem to pull out
[665.40 - 671.52] of it so a lot of people they get so
[668.12 - 673.48] beaten down by the process of being sick
[671.52 - 675.12] doctor to doctor to doctor to doctor and
[673.48 - 676.48] by the way take this to your doctor and

[786.76 - 791.40] plus
[787.72 - 793.40] that you know I got a friend and my
[791.40 - 795.44] friend was complaining and complaining
[793.40 - 797.60] complaining about a bunch of things and
[795.44 - 799.44] I'm like dude whatever you're
[797.60 - 801.48] complaining about can you imagine if you
[799.44 - 804.00] were sick with chronic illness and all
[801.48 - 806.72] that because that's that's that's the
[804.00 - 809.16] hard part right there is living with a
[806.72 - 811.68] symptom or a condition and dealing with
[809.16 - 813.64] all the stuff that everybody has to deal
[811.68 - 815.96] with in life it's the combination of
[813.64 - 818.80] both think about that that's really hard
[815.96 - 821.12] for a lot of people a lot of people so
[818.80 - 824.16] what's so special about the
[821.12 - 825.20] 369 number one the only cleanse out
[824.16 - 826.92] there along with the other medical
[825.20 - 830.28] medium cleanses that protects your
[826.92 - 833.60] adrenals saves your adrenals so you can
[830.28 - 835.64] cleanse yeah saves your adrenals you
[833.60 - 837.92] want to do a long long water fast just
[835.64 - 839.96] destroy your adrenals do you want to do
[837.92 - 842.08] do you want to do a big old milk cleanse
[839.96 - 843.92] you destroy your adrenals do you want to
[842.08 - 846.20] do intermittent fasting you destroy your
[843.92 - 848.24] adrenals nobody gives a [ __ ] out there
[846.20 - 850.84] they just don't they don't meaning all
[848.24 - 853.08] the makers and pushers of this stuff
[850.84 - 854.80] they have no idea probably anyway but
[853.08 - 857.04] even if they did have an idea I don't
[854.80 - 859.00] think most of them would care just do my
[857.04 - 861.88] cleanse just do my
[859.00 - 865.36] cleanse and what happens is that these
[861.88 - 867.80] cleanses here from above were designed
[865.36 - 869.72] so your adrenals are saved but nobody
[867.80 - 871.72] would know how to save an adal Ral gland
[869.72 - 873.08] out there because in the world of Health
[871.72 - 876.84] I don't know if you guys knew this going
[873.08 - 878.36] back 10 20 30 40 years ago there were no
[876.84 - 880.04] understandings of like how you can
[878.36 - 881.60] cleanse or do something for yourself and
[880.04 - 884.00] protect your adrenal did did you guys
[881.60 - 886.08] know that it's not like there's this
[884.00 - 888.20] thing going all the way back that
[886.08 - 890.48] existed where protect your adrenals
[888.20 - 890.48] while you're
[891.04 - 894.84] cleansing the whole adrenals and
[893.76 - 896.64] protecting adrenals while you're
[894.84 - 898.48] cleansing is medical medium information
[896.64 - 900.04] is the only cleanses that protect your
[898.48 - 902.16] adrenals while you're
[900.04 - 904.32] cleansing there's so much adrenal
[902.16 - 905.88] information in the books I almost think
[904.32 - 908.40] the books are just all adrenal
[905.88 - 911.24] information
[908.40 - 914.12] sometimes like
[911.24 - 918.68] seriously like that's how much adrenal
[914.12 - 922.20] information is in the books it's
[918.68 - 924.56] insane so yeah what people don't realize
[922.20 - 926.84] out there is with cleanses you drink a
[924.56 - 928.76] whole B here's this is ridiculous if you
[926.84 - 930.08] hear this if you hear about a cleanse
[928.76 - 931.40] where you drink a whole bunch of olive
[930.08 - 934.52] oil in the morning or something like
[931.40 - 938.24] that run run
[934.52 - 938.24] screaming run
[938.44 - 942.68] screaming
[940.12 - 945.52] seriously what a way to get yourself
[942.68 - 947.36] sick wake up in the morning be like ah
[945.52 - 949.20] I'm going to try to do this biohack
[947.36 - 951.12] right here and maybe try to cleanse or
[949.20 - 954.44] something I'm going to drink a glass of
[951.12 - 957.48] olive oil and send it on down Run Run
[954.44 - 960.48] for the hills man run for the from the
[957.48 - 962.56] hills okay great way to mess up your
[960.48 - 965.00] adrenals great way to screw up your
[962.56 - 968.44] liver just great
[965.00 - 970.32] way yeah yeah May they're
[968.44 - 972.40] new yeah
[970.32 - 974.32] so the whole point here is what I'm
[972.40 - 979.04] trying to get at is these cleanses
[974.32 - 979.04] actually protect and help even heal your
[979.40 - 983.84] adrenals protect and even help heal your
[981.92 - 986.52] adrenals so much
[983.84 - 988.16] so when you actually restore your
[986.52 - 989.68] adrenals after you're getting rid of all
[988.16 - 991.20] the toxins and you're cleansing and
[989.68 - 993.04] you're cleaning everything up and you
[991.20 - 995.36] restore your
[993.04 - 997.44] adrenals look
[995.36 - 998.56] out because then if you go and you
[997.44 - 1001.08] change your
[998.56 - 1003.72] diet and you actually start bringing in
[1001.08 - 1005.68] stuff you haven't eaten a long time
[1003.72 - 1007.72] you're going to feel like a burst and
[1005.68 - 1011.16] what that burst is your adrenals then
[1007.72 - 1014.12] going explode explode
[1011.16 - 1016.44] explode yeah well I've been doing
[1014.12 - 1019.00] medical medium I got my symptoms down
[1016.44 - 1020.28] I've been healing I've been doing mm and
[1019.00 - 1021.84] what does that mean anyway we got to
[1020.28 - 1023.40] talk about that a little bit too like
[1021.84 - 1025.44] what do you mean you're doing mm like
[1023.40 - 1026.88] seriously have you been just doing hmds
[1025.44 - 1028.80] that would be amazing if you you're just
[1026.88 - 1030.24] doing the celery juice are you doing a
[1028.80 - 1032.00] monoc cleanse for a long time are you
[1030.24 - 1033.68] doing all the supplement Protocols are
[1032.00 - 1035.76] you picking and customizing your own
[1033.68 - 1037.44] supplement protocol like what is it
[1035.76 - 1038.68] you're doing there people every day out
[1037.44 - 1041.12] there I hear it there I do medical
[1038.68 - 1042.64] medium and then you all of a sudden see
[1041.12 - 1044.16] they're posting something later on or
[1042.64 - 1046.08] something and they're posting all this
[1044.16 - 1048.16] other stuff it's terrible it's not even
[1046.08 - 1050.80] mmm or anything it's like okay thanks
[1048.16 - 1051.96] for saying you do M but you're doing a
[1050.80 - 1053.60] bunch of other stuff and it's not
[1051.96 - 1056.44] working for you
[1053.60 - 1059.80] but what happens is when people really
[1056.44 - 1063.24] do medical medium they do right really
[1059.80 - 1064.76] do it they're they they understand stay
[1063.24 - 1067.80] away from the natural flavor stay away
[1064.76 - 1070.64] from the canola oil okay keep the fats
[1067.80 - 1073.04] low right do the cleanses periodically
[1070.64 - 1077.04] if you want do a straight 369 you could
[1073.04 - 1079.40] do it for life but do do it right and
[1077.04 - 1082.36] they doing it what happens is is you
[1079.40 - 1084.16] start cleaning up you start healing your
[1082.36 - 1086.72] symptoms you start recovering you start
[1084.16 - 1090.08] rebuilding yeah you start rebuilding and
[1086.72 - 1092.80] recovering but then you're kind of like
[1090.08 - 1092.80] on an even
[1094.12 - 1100.12] Keel and then you get off and you eat
[1097.80 - 1103.28] big old greasy pizza with pepperoni on
[1100.12 - 1105.20] it and cheese or you eat a whatever
[1103.28 - 1107.24] something else and all of a sudden
[1105.20 - 1109.04] you're like boom wait a minute I can do
[1107.24 - 1110.68] this well yeah you did so much healing
[1109.04 - 1112.68] you did so much recovering you how many
[1110.68 - 1113.80] people have done that so much recovering
[1112.68 - 1115.92] they're just back to eating whatever
[1113.80 - 1117.12] macaroni and cheese this this this this
[1115.92 - 1120.88] I'm not talking about medical medium
[1117.12 - 1123.00] macaroni and cheese and they're and then
[1120.88 - 1124.76] boom or say they've been doing the
[1123.00 - 1127.04] cleanses and they've been not they
[1124.76 - 1129.44] haven't been eating
[1127.04 - 1131.40] beef they haven't been eating red meat
[1129.44 - 1133.84] for a while his medical mum information
[1131.40 - 1135.80] is not about being anti-red meat you can
[1133.84 - 1137.92] do the information do the protocols do
[1135.80 - 1140.36] some healing do the hmds and still do
[1137.92 - 1141.64] meat it's about making sure you do all
[1140.36 - 1142.92] the right things and you're doing all
[1141.64 - 1144.96] you know looking out but if you're doing
[1142.92 - 1147.76] the cleanse and you're doing one of
[1144.96 - 1149.20] these powerful cleanses like the 369 and
[1147.76 - 1150.68] then you come off that cleanse and you
[1149.20 - 1152.44] start eating red meat you're going to
[1150.68 - 1154.08] get a burst you're going to be like oh
[1152.44 - 1156.12] my God because what happened was during
[1154.08 - 1157.52] the 369 you're restoring your adrenals
[1156.12 - 1160.68] and they're getting stronger and
[1157.52 - 1160.68] stronger and stronger and they're
[1160.72 - 1164.60] healing you're bringing your adrenals
[1162.96 - 1166.68] back and they're getting stronger
[1164.60 - 1169.08] stronger and they're healing that's
[1166.68 - 1173.08] what's happening and as your adrenals
[1169.08 - 1174.28] are healing all you got to do is shove
[1173.08 - 1179.36] down some red
[1174.28 - 1181.40] beef red beef shove down some
[1179.36 - 1184.08] chicken and then your adrenals are going
[1181.40 - 1185.00] to go meaning they're going to release a
[1184.08 - 1186.76] lot of
[1185.00 - 1188.68] adrenaline because there's all of a
[1186.76 - 1191.84] sudden all this heavy overt fat in your
[1188.68 - 1193.24] system so okay okay forget that you're
[1191.84 - 1194.88] going to shove down a whole bunch of
[1193.24 - 1197.08] tablespoons of almond butter you're
[1194.88 - 1199.28] going to shove down a whole bunch of a
[1197.08 - 1201.40] whole bunch of nut butter
[1199.28 - 1202.76] and your adrenal glands are going to or
[1201.40 - 1206.00] you're going to have a pizza with a
[1202.76 - 1207.96] whole bunch of oil on it and cheese and
[1206.00 - 1209.20] your adrenal glands are going to go and
[1207.96 - 1210.92] you're going to be high you're going to
[1209.20 - 1214.56] be euphoric you're going to be like oh
[1210.92 - 1217.00] my God this is what I needed I needed
[1214.56 - 1220.32] this all my all this time I needed this
[1217.00 - 1223.32] hard good high quality cheese I needed

[1223.32 - 1227.32] I I needed this this
[1227.64 - 1230.92] whatever and then you're just your
[1229.40 - 1232.04] adrenals are just going to go boom and
[1230.92 - 1234.64] they're going to be pumping you're going
[1232.04 - 1235.96] to feel it coursing through your veins
[1234.64 - 1237.28] and you're also going to be kind of like

[1502.32 - 1508.60] information from above the
[1505.28 - 1508.60] 369 right
[1510.08 - 1513.88] there it isn't just more toxins than
[1512.52 - 1515.88] ever before and I'm going to tell you
[1513.88 - 1517.84] right now we used to worry about the
[1515.88 - 1519.84] oceans the oceans are toxic the oceans
[1517.84 - 1521.84] are toxic the oceans are toxic look out
[1519.84 - 1524.00] look out they're toxic they're getting
[1521.84 - 1526.80] more toxic there's mercury in the oceans
[1524.00 - 1529.16] there's all kinds of you know dioxins
[1526.80 - 1530.76] dioxins they all you know in the ocean
[1529.16 - 1532.40] right glysophates in the ocean
[1530.76 - 1534.12] everything's in the ocean it's all in
[1532.40 - 1536.24] there pesticides in the ocean all these
[1534.12 - 1539.28] things in the ocean
[1536.24 - 1540.92] right human bodies are dirtier than the
[1539.28 - 1545.60] oceans
[1540.92 - 1548.84] now human bodies surface Sur surfing on
[1545.60 - 1553.76] the big waves are dirtier than the big
[1548.84 - 1557.24] waves yeah that's right that's right I
[1553.76 - 1560.20] don't know about you guys but for me
[1557.24 - 1561.76] when I think about that I'm like when I
[1560.20 - 1565.64] think about that
[1561.76 - 1569.24] seriously okay people swimming in the
[1565.64 - 1573.00] ocean are more toxic than the
[1569.24 - 1575.72] ocean yeah that's right they
[1573.00 - 1578.60] are people swimming in the ocean and
[1575.72 - 1580.88] their armpits sweating while they're
[1578.60 - 1582.56] swimming they're out gassing with
[1580.88 - 1585.88] flatulence in the
[1582.56 - 1588.28] ocean their feet all kinds of fungus all
[1585.88 - 1590.04] kinds of yeast around their toes there's
[1588.28 - 1593.80] swimming in the
[1590.04 - 1596.20] ocean like feet collect all kinds of
[1593.80 - 1599.88] crap I
[1596.20 - 1602.36] mean like the the whole thing with feet
[1599.88 - 1605.32] right and the feet fetishes out there
[1602.36 - 1606.80] and stuff you know people biting other
[1605.32 - 1610.32] people's toes and stuff like that
[1606.80 - 1614.16] whatever the yeast the fungus the mold
[1610.32 - 1616.32] the like the bacteria in between toes
[1614.16 - 1618.48] and on feet I don't mean after the
[1616.32 - 1621.20] person soaked their feet and their nice
[1618.48 - 1625.32] nice and squeaky clean because it it's
[1621.20 - 1628.04] still there it's still there it's still
[1625.32 - 1631.32] there you know anyway them swimming in
[1628.04 - 1633.56] the ocean people are more toxic than the
[1631.32 - 1636.32] ocean now it used to be the other way
[1633.56 - 1638.16] around where the oceans were just more
[1636.32 - 1643.08] toxic they were more toxic they just
[1638.16 - 1645.76] were Metals dioxins Mercury algae algae
[1643.08 - 1647.72] blooms but people believe it or not are
[1645.76 - 1650.36] even more toxic their livers are filled
[1647.72 - 1654.12] with more garbage more junk more crap
[1650.36 - 1656.76] their livers are really really toxic
[1654.12 - 1660.44] that's the world we live in now people
[1656.76 - 1664.48] are highly toxic and the irony is so
[1660.44 - 1667.12] many of the biohacks are making them
[1664.48 - 1670.60] more toxic which is
[1667.12 - 1673.92] crazy crazy Pearl powder great way great
[1670.60 - 1676.32] way to tear up the intestinal track also
[1673.92 - 1678.80] add toxins it's like you know people
[1676.32 - 1680.00] don't even realize that's just one thing
[1678.80 - 1682.92] and everything else and what about the
[1680.00 - 1684.88] protein craze here's what happens the
[1682.92 - 1687.28] protein the protein
[1684.88 - 1690.92] demon the protein
[1687.28 - 1693.16] demon is literally going
[1690.92 - 1695.92] to
[1693.16 - 1698.72] destroy destroy the brains of so many
[1695.92 - 1702.80] people so they never heal so they never
[1698.72 - 1705.56] heal yeah there's a new upcoming wave of
[1702.80 - 1709.60] sick young people and they're being
[1705.56 - 1712.00] conditioned on the protein scam
[1709.60 - 1715.28] conditioned on the protein scam all you
[1712.00 - 1717.08] see on social is protein protein protein
[1715.28 - 1720.16] proteins everything that's all it's all
[1717.08 - 1723.40] you see on social is people screaming
[1720.16 - 1726.04] about protein it is by far one of the
[1723.40 - 1727.60] stupidest things I've ever seen hands
[1726.04 - 1729.24] down one of those and I would actually
[1727.60 - 1730.44] be one of those people too if I didn't
[1729.24 - 1733.12] know if I didn't have Spirit of
[1730.44 - 1736.04] compassion I would easily be if I was
[1733.12 - 1737.20] into health I wasn't into Health when I
[1736.04 - 1740.00] was when I was a kid Spirit of
[1737.20 - 1743.44] compassion made me and made me be into
[1740.00 - 1747.36] health I wouldn't be into it I
[1743.44 - 1749.36] wouldn't no way no way no way even
[1747.36 - 1751.24] though these are the most unbelievable
[1749.36 - 1753.20] medical Bibles out there in the world
[1751.24 - 1754.68] that have turned people's lives around
[1753.20 - 1757.32] it wouldn't have been what I wanted to
[1754.68 - 1759.56] do I was you know pushed into it forced
[1757.32 - 1761.80] into it by Spirit of compassion but the
[1759.56 - 1765.60] protein thing I would be a sucker for
[1761.80 - 1767.08] that one too easily easily I'd be like
[1765.60 - 1768.48] yeah you got to count your protein okay
[1767.08 - 1769.84] don't count your protein but you need
[1768.48 - 1771.68] enough protein did you get enough
[1769.84 - 1773.28] protein are you protein deficient yeah
[1771.68 - 1774.44] what about the protein oh you're on some
[1773.28 - 1775.88] kind of diet what are you getting enough
[1774.44 - 1777.80] protein oh good it's high enough in
[1775.88 - 1779.56] protein amazing wait are you sick are
[1777.80 - 1782.00] you dying you didn't get enough protein
[1779.56 - 1785.60] something's wrong with you I would be an
[1782.00 - 1788.72] insane nut job like you see out there
[1785.60 - 1791.88] totally consumed in the protein fear the
[1788.72 - 1794.56] protein demon it is insane to the degree
[1791.88 - 1796.20] the protein fear and the protein demon
[1794.56 - 1798.20] actually do their thing out there the
[1796.20 - 1801.80] conditioning the conditioning of prote
[1798.20 - 1803.92] protein utterly insane that's all it is
[1801.80 - 1805.92] out there now and even the people
[1803.92 - 1807.44] that're like I don't count protein I
[1805.92 - 1808.96] just live my life you see some
[1807.44 - 1810.64] influencers CU they want to stand out
[1808.96 - 1812.16] and be different than the other people
[1810.64 - 1813.68] you'll see some influencer be like I
[1812.16 - 1815.36] don't worry about protein and I don't
[1813.68 - 1817.04] really worry about what I eat I just do
[1815.36 - 1819.44] the right things I eat a couple healthy
[1817.04 - 1821.48] things they're worried about protein you
[1819.44 - 1823.24] look at their feed three months later go
[1821.48 - 1825.44] in their feed back a year ago they were
[1823.24 - 1829.56] crazed about protein the whole point is
[1825.44 - 1832.12] everybody is it is literally literally
[1829.56 - 1836.04] literally
[1832.12 - 1840.24] unbelievable unbelievable
[1836.04 - 1842.76] ridiculous stupidity the protein
[1840.24 - 1845.72] problem everybody gets enough protein
[1842.76 - 1848.56] everybody's been getting enough protein
[1845.72 - 1851.88] unless unless you live somewhere and
[1848.56 - 1854.60] you're like poor and you're eating
[1851.88 - 1857.64] dirt and you're you're just like digging
[1854.60 - 1859.40] and looking for a worm which is high in
[1857.64 - 1860.64] prote
[1859.40 - 1865.32] unless you're
[1860.64 - 1867.40] like like all you have is white rice
[1865.32 - 1870.20] that's not brown rice it's just white
[1867.40 - 1872.00] rice it's been processed just totally
[1870.20 - 1874.04] processed unless you're living somewhere
[1872.00 - 1876.96] and you're in a hut somewhere and you're
[1874.04 - 1880.00] only you've only been given just white
[1876.96 - 1883.16] rice meaning the center of the the
[1880.00 - 1886.08] center of the grain stripped stripped of
[1883.16 - 1888.48] anything right bleached and stripped and
[1886.08 - 1890.36] that's the only thing you've been given
[1888.48 - 1893.32] I I mean you might get you might get
[1890.36 - 1896.52] protein deficient over time you
[1893.32 - 1898.00] might nobody's protein deficient nobody
[1896.52 - 1900.32] has protein
[1898.00 - 1904.08] deficiencies nobody
[1900.32 - 1906.16] does you don't unless you're being starv
[1904.08 - 1908.80] to death and what you're being starved
[1906.16 - 1913.08] on doesn't
[1908.80 - 1916.16] have even one amino
[1913.08 - 1919.48] acid nobody nobody's deficient of
[1916.16 - 1922.68] protein but you'll see people are sick
[1919.48 - 1924.48] sick and dying people are dying and
[1922.68 - 1927.08] they're on tons of
[1924.48 - 1929.92] protein I know there's a there's a guy
[1927.08 - 1931.64] on social that's been screaming about
[1929.92 - 1934.16] things like protein and everything else
[1931.64 - 1936.04] and protein and all this stuff and the
[1934.16 - 1939.24] guy's blood letting himself because he
[1936.04 - 1941.48] has he has a condition and he's blood
[1939.24 - 1944.32] letting himself because he has a
[1941.48 - 1946.56] condition so he's bloodletting himself
[1944.32 - 1948.40] the protein didn't fix him the protein
[1946.56 - 1950.68] didn't fix the guy
[1948.40 - 1952.72] the is literally blood letting himself
[1950.68 - 1954.60] and his protein protein and everything
[1952.72 - 1956.84] else about protein wasn't the answer for
[1954.60 - 1958.80] the guy the guy's in the health scene
[1956.84 - 1961.56] and he's bloodletting himself he's
[1958.80 - 1964.64] teaching people how to bloodlet real
[1961.56 - 1966.32] smart real smart the point I'm trying to
[1964.64 - 1968.56] say is how come the protein didn't fix
[1966.32 - 1968.56] you
[1969.12 - 1975.20] man Josh I gained over 50 pounds of
[1972.24 - 1977.16] muscle on lowfat low protein plant-based
[1975.20 - 1978.68] medical medium um thank you for saying
[1977.16 - 1980.96] medical medium because there's
[1978.68 - 1983.40] plant-based but it's
[1980.96 - 1986.80] different there's plant-based and it's
[1983.40 - 1989.64] different okay you can be like doing
[1986.80 - 1991.36] like what you call keto or something and
[1989.64 - 1994.00] but you could be doing medical medium
[1991.36 - 1995.40] style so you can heal and say you know
[1994.00 - 1998.72] it's good to have the medical medium
[1995.40 - 2000.96] there when it applies when it applies
[1998.72 - 2002.88] Fazio over there on YouTube I survive
[2000.96 - 2005.80] because of your information especially
[2002.88 - 2008.80] also the spiritual information thank you
[2005.80 - 2011.32] for acknowledging that my
[2008.80 - 2013.20] build it up because of what you do thank
[2011.32 - 2015.36] you for acknowledging the spiritual
[2013.20 - 2017.24] information I mean I remember was it 4
[2015.36 - 2018.84] years ago or something like that people
[2017.24 - 2021.28] screaming that I wasn't spiritual or
[2018.84 - 2024.04] something like that oh no I I only hear
[2021.28 - 2026.76] a voice The Voice put talks about the
[2024.04 - 2029.36] soul in the books um the voice talks
[2026.76 - 2030.84] about the golden rope I mean I don't
[2029.36 - 2033.24] know what to say as a messenger I'm just
[2030.84 - 2036.00] doing the best I can but remember there
[2033.24 - 2038.04] was like there was like a moment in time
[2036.00 - 2039.76] where people like he's not spiritual
[2038.04 - 2043.12] he's not
[2039.76 - 2044.68] spiritual and and I was scratching my
[2043.12 - 2048.20] head saying the spirit of compassion
[2044.68 - 2050.56] like did we do something wrong because I
[2048.20 - 2052.88] don't know I I thought I put spiritual
[2050.56 - 2054.88] information in the books that you told
[2052.88 - 2057.36] me
[2054.88 - 2060.16] about Erica you're laughing out loud
[2057.36 - 2063.76] laugh out loud out loud
[2060.16 - 2065.60] so the protein thing is insane watch it
[2063.76 - 2067.88] grow it's going to grow into a massive
[2065.60 - 2069.48] monster conditioning people and and it's
[2067.88 - 2071.40] going to be the Takeover it's the next
[2069.48 - 2074.36] takeover it's protein you're going to
[2071.40 - 2076.60] see 10 more stupid drinks you know out
[2074.36 - 2078.16] there on ad running ads about proteins
[2076.60 - 2079.88] in it you're going to see more protein
[2078.16 - 2081.92] talk than ever before you're just going
[2079.88 - 2084.32] to see and hear about protein left and
[2081.92 - 2086.52] right you know CLA says you're the most
[2084.32 - 2089.20] spiritual I'm honored and you know and
[2086.52 - 2089.20] in spirit of
[2089.48 - 2094.84] compassion the the amount of protein
[2093.20 - 2096.08] talk that you guys are going to be up
[2094.84 - 2098.76] against pretty soon it's going to be
[2096.08 - 2103.92] unbelievable but everybody gets protein
[2098.76 - 2108.08] you eat one bean you eat you eat hummus
[2103.92 - 2111.72] you eat an ounce sure an ounce of
[2108.08 - 2115.52] steak whatever it's everywhere you eat a
[2111.72 - 2118.16] nut you eat a leaf of spinach you want
[2115.52 - 2120.04] protein protein that's actually
[2118.16 - 2122.28] assimilable you want protein that
[2120.04 - 2125.16] actually absorbs do the medical medium
[2122.28 - 2127.88] spinach soup because it's it's the
[2125.16 - 2129.68] protein that actually goes into into to
[2127.88 - 2132.68] the body and gets utilized and broken
[2129.68 - 2137.32] down what about spirulina what about
[2132.68 - 2139.48] spirulina spirulina is is is one of the
[2137.32 - 2141.76] most
[2139.48 - 2145.60] bioavailable protein
[2141.76 - 2148.44] sources most bioavailable protein Source
[2145.60 - 2151.28] barleygrass juice powder is one of the
[2148.44 - 2153.08] most bioavailable protein sources you
[2151.28 - 2154.68] know why I don't scream about protein
[2153.08 - 2156.12] medical medium information you get
[2154.68 - 2158.68] plenty of protein you get the best
[2156.12 - 2160.52] proteins you get the best best proteins
[2158.68 - 2162.60] I'm sorry but you do medical medium
[2160.52 - 2165.64] information you get the best
[2162.60 - 2167.92] proteins I mean I if I'm annoying
[2165.64 - 2171.52] anybody just you know you could say so I
[2167.92 - 2174.12] don't know what to say but it's true you
[2171.52 - 2175.84] get the most bioavailable protein from
[2174.12 - 2178.56] the sparina the barley grass cheese but
[2175.84 - 2181.36] are you kidding that's just two things
[2178.56 - 2182.96] the spinach soup all the leafy greens
[2181.36 - 2185.36] nobody talked about leafy greens medical
[2182.96 - 2187.64] medium
[2185.36 - 2189.12] information I mean I'm just saying
[2187.64 - 2191.16] medical medium information didn't create
[2189.12 - 2193.12] and grow a leafy green leafy greens
[2191.16 - 2195.10] aren't here because of me no because of
[2193.12 - 2196.32] the spirit of compassion no they're
[2195.10 - 2200.68] [Music]
[2196.32 - 2204.52] not God's seeds you know God seed seeded
[2200.68 - 2207.12] the planet the leafy greens
[2204.52 - 2208.88] okay but people were eating like the
[2207.12 - 2212.56] hygienic movement was eating just
[2208.88 - 2217.60] iceberg lettuce it was eating iceberg
[2212.56 - 2217.60] lettuce right iceberg lettuce
[2217.76 - 2222.92] and now they're attacking leafy greens
[2219.92 - 2225.80] this is the hilarious part right here we
[2222.92 - 2229.40] need leafy greens we need leafy herb
[2225.80 - 2232.20] greens like parsley and
[2229.40 - 2234.44] cilantro and now they're attacking
[2232.20 - 2236.68] it it's like that one idiot that keeps
[2234.44 - 2238.68] on running ads 24/7 to the medical
[2236.68 - 2240.64] medium Community him and his
[2238.68 - 2243.00] daughter-in-law or something like that
[2240.64 - 2244.84] they got that sham of a business right
[2243.00 - 2247.08] they're they keep on talking bad about
[2244.84 - 2249.04] cilantro they keep on talking bad about
[2247.08 - 2251.32] spir Lina they didn't even know what
[2249.04 - 2253.72] spirina was years
[2251.32 - 2255.28] ago they were probably like balloon
[2253.72 - 2256.72] sales people or something like that
[2255.28 - 2257.88] nothing wrong with people you know
[2256.72 - 2260.24] selling
[2257.88 - 2262.68] balloons I don't know don't quote me on
[2260.24 - 2265.56] that part but I can tell you
[2262.68 - 2268.56] this I can tell you this they're talking
[2265.56 - 2270.64] bad about spirina and cilantro cilantro
[2268.56 - 2272.28] is one of the most life-saving
[2270.64 - 2277.52] herbs
[2272.28 - 2279.24] God God God up there how dare you make
[2277.52 - 2282.44] and create
[2279.24 - 2284.88] cilantro you must have been wrong God
[2282.44 - 2287.64] you must have had something wrong with
[2284.88 - 2290.20] you when you created cilantro
[2287.64 - 2292.40] because that like doctor that lost his
[2290.20 - 2296.36] license and his daughter-in-law thinks
[2292.40 - 2298.96] cilantro is really bad so you know what
[2296.36 - 2301.28] God you must be wrong all this time and
[2298.96 - 2302.72] they must be right the doctor that lost
[2301.28 - 2304.60] his license the chiropractor that lost
[2302.72 - 2306.68] his license and his
[2304.60 - 2309.20] daughter-in-law they must be the right
[2306.68 - 2311.88] ones but not you God you're the wrong
[2309.20 - 2314.16] one cilantro is terrible no one should
[2311.88 - 2314.16] eat
[2314.20 - 2318.44] it like sick
[2318.72 - 2323.96] sick but oh but by their supplements and
[2322.04 - 2326.52] by their program and their expensive
[2323.96 - 2328.16] programs instead why they talk about
[2326.52 - 2331.48] toxins and
[2328.16 - 2332.88] cells sure they didn't know what caused
[2331.48 - 2335.08] vertigo or anything else they didn't
[2332.88 - 2336.52] know any of that they didn't know you
[2335.08 - 2338.04] know if you look into their crap years
[2336.52 - 2340.68] ago they had no idea what was wrong with
[2338.04 - 2343.48] anybody with anything but
[2340.68 - 2346.24] oh steal and Rob medical medium
[2343.48 - 2349.72] information left and right read the
[2346.24 - 2351.24] books and take the info and then try to
[2349.72 - 2353.92] throw the guy under the bus by saying
[2351.24 - 2356.88] spene is not good in cilantro sure I'll
[2353.92 - 2358.52] listen to you you lost your license yeah
[2356.88 - 2362.68] you got your daughter-in-law working for
[2358.52 - 2364.56] you yeah okay but then they can
[2362.68 - 2367.68] say
[2364.56 - 2370.36] whatever then you know it's some but
[2367.68 - 2374.92] then they could say whatever they
[2370.36 - 2374.92] want but then they can say God created
[2375.36 - 2382.04] coffee God God you created coffee
[2379.96 - 2383.72] everybody should be drinking it right
[2382.04 - 2386.08] you could you created coffee everybody
[2383.72 - 2389.56] should be drinking
[2386.08 - 2390.64] it exactly so here's the here's how it
[2389.56 - 2394.48] works
[2390.64 - 2397.56] okay right God creates good things that
[2394.48 - 2400.32] heal people God creates other things
[2397.56 - 2403.40] right that may not heal
[2400.32 - 2406.68] people that's how it works God creates
[2403.40 - 2410.32] people right that create chemical
[2406.68 - 2414.16] factories to kill people
[2410.32 - 2416.84] right God creates the ability for us
[2414.16 - 2420.44] to manufacture machines and make
[2416.84 - 2423.40] machines and poison the oceans but God
[2420.44 - 2426.36] also puts things out there to recover
[2423.40 - 2428.32] people to get their lives back like
[2426.36 - 2430.52] parsley and
[2428.32 - 2433.88] cilantro and leafy
[2430.52 - 2437.68] greens yeah things that get our lives
[2433.88 - 2440.36] back things that can recover us like
[2437.68 - 2443.88] sparina things that actually can bring
[2440.36 - 2446.00] us back and that's the miracle that's
[2443.88 - 2449.84] the miracle we got to pick and choose
[2446.00 - 2451.80] the things that actually work you know
[2449.84 - 2454.20] got to pick and choose the things that
[2451.80 - 2454.20] actually
[2455.44 - 2460.48] work there's a lot of things that grow
[2457.88 - 2462.24] down here that aren't God created there
[2460.48 - 2463.88] a lot of things that grow down here that
[2462.24 - 2466.48] God did not
[2463.88 - 2471.72] create something very important to know
[2466.48 - 2473.80] that were seeded Long Ago by guess what
[2471.72 - 2475.00] aliens there's a lot of things growing
[2473.80 - 2479.56] on this
[2475.00 - 2481.00] planet that God didn't put down here and
[2479.56 - 2484.56] they were
[2481.00 - 2486.72] seated and grown by aliens because we
[2484.56 - 2488.92] got hundreds of thousands of years of
[2486.72 - 2492.04] civilization
[2488.92 - 2495.80] we got a lot of different
[2492.04 - 2497.56] civilizations and we have a lot of alien
[2495.80 - 2500.32] interaction and
[2497.56 - 2502.92] seeding I mean that just happened
[2500.32 - 2506.40] spirina is the
[2502.92 - 2508.88] Mana that's the Mana it was brought here
[2506.40 - 2512.16] to save people's lives and then you got
[2508.88 - 2515.12] people [ __ ] on it
[2512.16 - 2517.08] unbelievable spirina is the Mana that
[2515.12 - 2521.24] was actually brought down here that's
[2517.08 - 2525.24] the the Mana that God gave us so that we
[2521.24 - 2527.36] can save our lives and then you got
[2525.24 - 2530.00] somebody doesn't know
[2527.36 - 2531.84] anything talking bad about it so people
[2530.00 - 2533.68] get thrown off their game and can't heal
[2531.84 - 2536.84] anymore it's
[2533.68 - 2536.84] unbelievable it's
[2542.84 - 2548.24] unbelievable anyway let's get back to it

[2596.92 - 2600.76] the
[2598.44 - 2603.36] adrenals there aren't cleanses out there
[2600.76 - 2604.80] that do that intermittent fasting
[2603.36 - 2607.20] trashes the
[2604.80 - 2608.80] adrenals you try to do the fast track
[2607.20 - 2612.92] can you try to water fast along water
[2608.80 - 2612.92] fast especially if you're chronically
[2613.20 - 2616.76] sick yeah the adrenals aren't going to
[2615.56 - 2619.44] like
[2616.76 - 2621.48] that you want to do an olive oil cleanse
[2619.44 - 2622.96] your adrenals are not going to like that
[2621.48 - 2625.48] they're not going to like that they're
[2622.96 - 2627.56] going to get worn out from that you want
[2625.48 - 2630.32] to do a green tea cleanse your adrenals
[2627.56 - 2632.44] will hate you they will they will hate
[2630.32 - 2634.52] you you want to do want to do milk
[2632.44 - 2636.44] cleanse your adrenals will hate you you
[2634.52 - 2638.44] want to you want to sit in an ice bath
[2636.44 - 2640.60] freezing cold ice bath your adrenals

[2640.60 - 2644.12] strong adrenals and you're not
[2642.28 - 2646.16] struggling with any kind of you know
[2644.12 - 2647.56] condition or Pro you know sickness or
[2646.16 - 2649.36] anything like that chronic illness and
[2647.56 - 2651.32] you want to sit in ice bath for a little
[2649.36 - 2653.28] while you know your adrenals are going
[2651.32 - 2655.28] to go into shock and they're just going
[2653.28 - 2656.72] to go because they're going to be like
[2655.28 - 2658.64] wait a minute you just fell into the
[2656.72 - 2660.88] Arctic you just fell into a lake that
[2658.64 - 2663.60] was frozen you must have fallen through
[2660.88 - 2665.84] the ice your body's in crisis you must
[2663.60 - 2667.48] be dying about to drown under the ice
[2665.84 - 2668.84] and no one's there to save you and your
[2667.48 - 2670.28] adrenals are going to be doing this no
[2668.84 - 2672.72] one's there to save you even though
[2670.28 - 2674.44] you're just in an ice tub your adrenals
[2672.72 - 2676.08] are just going to be flooding because
[2674.44 - 2678.36] your brain and adrenals are going to be
[2676.08 - 2680.72] like emergency emergency person fell
[2678.36 - 2683.12] through the ice in some frozen lake they
[2680.72 - 2684.60] were ice fishing they fell down in there
[2683.12 - 2686.04] that's what's going to happen you keep
[2684.60 - 2687.24] on doing that overall you're just going
[2686.04 - 2689.72] to be
[2687.24 - 2694.80] wasted adrenals are going to be
[2689.72 - 2696.60] wasted yeah exactly that's how it works
[2694.80 - 2699.16] protecting the adrenals is number one
[2696.60 - 2702.68] it's what the 369 does it's what the 28
[2699.16 - 2704.60] day cleanse does that's what the mono
[2702.68 - 2706.16] eating cleanse does the mono cleanse
[2704.60 - 2707.56] it's what the morning cleanse does it's
[2706.16 - 2711.08] all about protecting the adrenals you
[2707.56 - 2714.32] know why Trace mineral salts trace
[2711.08 - 2716.20] minerals glucose trace minerals glucose
[2714.32 - 2720.20] trace minerals
[2716.20 - 2723.08] glucose what trace minerals glucose
[2720.20 - 2725.24] that's right glucose to the brain so you
[2723.08 - 2728.08] don't have to run on adrenaline trace
[2725.24 - 2729.96] minerals and mineral salts to the brain
[2728.08 - 2732.36] so you don't have to run on
[2729.96 - 2734.04] adrenaline you do a cleanse and you
[2732.36 - 2735.72] don't have enough of that there enough
[2734.04 - 2738.32] glucose because when you do a milk
[2735.72 - 2740.16] cleanse you you got fat in there the
[2738.32 - 2743.28] glucose doesn't get to the
[2740.16 - 2744.56] brain it just doesn't the fat blocks it
[2743.28 - 2746.36] just doesn't get to the brain so when
[2744.56 - 2751.12] you try to do a milk cleanse the fat
[2746.36 - 2753.84] blocks it see how it works that's how it
[2751.12 - 2757.12] works you can't let the glucose be
[2753.84 - 2760.60] blocked so the medical medium cleanses a
[2757.12 - 2762.48] 369 cleanse doesn't stop the glucose
[2760.60 - 2765.16] from getting to the brain if you're
[2762.48 - 2768.60] going to cleanse you need sugar you need
[2765.16 - 2770.48] glucose to do the cleanse critical you
[2768.60 - 2772.52] don't need table sugar you don't need
[2770.48 - 2775.32] gobs and gobs of table sugar that that's
[2772.52 - 2775.32] nothing to do with
[2775.76 - 2780.44] it I love that love the whole carnivore
[2778.44 - 2782.24] thing now it's just like I
[2780.44 - 2784.28] predicted I mean you want to know
[2782.24 - 2786.24] prophecy you see this every now every
[2784.28 - 2787.68] now like prophecy this prophecy that out
[2786.24 - 2789.68] there prophecy
[2787.68 - 2791.56] is years ago me me saying that the
[2789.68 - 2793.40] carnivore guys the ones that were all
[2791.56 - 2795.08] just meat only meat only meat only and
[2793.40 - 2796.80] then raw meat raw meat and then meat
[2795.08 - 2798.96] cooked meat and cooked meat remember the
[2796.80 - 2800.12] pro what I said I said a bunch of times
[2798.96 - 2801.84] they're going to hit the wall and
[2800.12 - 2803.36] they're going to start adding lemon then
[2801.84 - 2805.20] they're going to start adding honey then
[2803.36 - 2806.64] they're going to start adding berries
[2805.20 - 2809.08] now they're just on a keto diet and
[2806.64 - 2812.64] they're calling it carnivore prophecy
[2809.08 - 2812.64] came true came
[2813.04 - 2817.68] true the reason why I'm talking about it
[2815.92 - 2819.40] kills the adrenals you want to do just
[2817.68 - 2820.72] all meat only and only meat you're going
[2819.40 - 2822.96] to kill your adrenals because your
[2820.72 - 2827.56] adrenals have to push adrenaline to your
[2822.96 - 2830.20] system to try to keep your body floating
[2827.56 - 2832.16] through all that fat all that overt
[2830.20 - 2833.68] fat think about it if you're going to be
[2832.16 - 2838.28] on meat only you're going to be on a
[2833.68 - 2839.44] high overt fat diet 247 so your adrenals
[2838.28 - 2842.24] are just going to suffer they're going
[2839.44 - 2843.88] to suffer Marie you remember Marie you
[2842.24 - 2847.16] remember YouTube you can't believe you
[2843.88 - 2849.24] remember this is years ago what the heck
[2847.16 - 2852.44] Allison I remember you said I remember
[2849.24 - 2857.40] you said fat was evil what are we
[2852.44 - 2857.40] saying you know the thing went
[2858.40 - 2862.76] listen
[2860.12 - 2865.72] so the prophecy was they'd all be kind
[2862.76 - 2867.72] of hit in the wall five years later four
[2865.72 - 2869.44] years later they all are and then you'll
[2867.72 - 2870.88] get a new person starting up right a
[2869.44 - 2872.68] brand new person some trainer or
[2870.88 - 2874.52] something like that I'm on Carnivore I'm
[2872.68 - 2877.52] going to try it I'm on all meat great
[2874.52 - 2880.68] you take your crowd down there you take
[2877.52 - 2884.44] your crowd down to hell with
[2880.68 - 2886.68] you you take them down and whoever
[2884.44 - 2888.00] survives six months later and a year
[2886.68 - 2889.76] later because you know what's going to
[2888.00 - 2891.48] happen you might break your carnivore
[2889.76 - 2892.68] diet for in a month later but you're not
[2891.48 - 2893.88] going to tell your crowd you're going to
[2892.68 - 2895.64] keep that a secret but you're going to
[2893.88 - 2897.96] have people in your crowd that won't
[2895.64 - 2899.08] they won't lie and they won't break it
[2897.96 - 2900.20] and there's going to be people in your
[2899.08 - 2901.56] crowd that are going to do it and
[2900.20 - 2902.60] they're going to be hitting the walls
[2901.56 - 2903.92] and those are the people that turn
[2902.60 - 2906.00] around and say I did carnivore and
[2903.92 - 2907.68] almost killed me because they did
[2906.00 - 2910.08] carnivore the way the other person was
[2907.68 - 2915.48] saying they were doing it but they
[2910.08 - 2915.48] weren't that happens all the time you
[2915.56 - 2920.64] know lra says 144 do you have more
[2918.12 - 2922.60] prophecies yes lots of them I also know
[2920.64 - 2924.36] why they're doing you know the whole I'm
[2922.60 - 2927.32] actually the only one unfortunately that
[2924.36 - 2929.64] knows why they're doing the uh the Drone
[2927.32 - 2930.92] thing but I don't want to say it because
[2929.64 - 2932.52] when you're the only one that knows what
[2930.92 - 2934.36] they're really doing but no one else is
[2932.52 - 2937.12] talking about it expect people with
[2934.36 - 2939.28] black suits coming to your door and I
[2937.12 - 2942.40] don't think it's going to help any of
[2939.28 - 2945.36] us anyway Ross Adams says how are they
[2942.40 - 2948.68] losing weight on
[2945.36 - 2951.48] Carnivore they lose weight on Carnivore
[2948.68 - 2953.96] okay all right because they they mono
[2951.48 - 2956.52] they're mono eating and they left
[2953.96 - 2959.68] whatever they were doing like they were
[2956.52 - 2961.52] doing carbs mixed with protein you know
[2959.68 - 2962.64] like bulker and Cutters you know bulking
[2961.52 - 2965.00] and cutting you know that whole thing
[2962.64 - 2966.44] bulking and cutting right they get into
[2965.00 - 2967.68] the gym and they're bulking and they're
[2966.44 - 2969.44] cutting
[2967.68 - 2971.64] what happens is the bulking and cutting
[2969.44 - 2974.68] process they can't keep up with it they

[4040.60 - 4045.56] about other people losing their way so
[4042.92 - 4048.08] they can't heal it's my always my always
[4045.56 - 4049.88] always concern it's always my concern
[4048.08 - 4052.04] it's people not being able to make their
[4049.88 - 4055.32] way to their healing process cuz they
[4052.04 - 4057.16] get thed you know by whatever a li or
[4055.32 - 4059.68] misinformation and then they lost their

[4441.16 - 4445.80] down years ago
[4442.56 - 4449.60] right and I got such severe because I
[4445.80 - 4452.88] was trying to save pets you'll do you'll
[4449.60 - 4456.68] do anything for pets you'll run into a
[4452.88 - 4460.36] burning house to try to save a pet I
[4456.68 - 4463.80] mean I I know people that would I
[4460.36 - 4467.04] did anyway so I got such severe lung
[4463.80 - 4467.04] damage from it
[4467.76 - 4471.64] right without Spirit of compassion and
[4470.16 - 4473.64] this information you see in front of you
[4471.64 - 4476.64] like cleanse to heal and everything else
[4473.64 - 4479.32] I I I don't know what would happened I
[4476.64 - 4480.72] got a good idea a really good idea what
[4479.32 - 4483.36] would
[4480.72 - 4487.80] happened but it
[4483.36 - 4490.80] healed I healed it using my free will
[4487.80 - 4493.16] listening to Spirit of
[4490.80 - 4495.60] compassion and using Spirit of
[4493.16 - 4498.16] compassion's information
[4495.60 - 4499.48] yeah and I remember I me I uttered it a
[4498.16 - 4500.76] little bit it slipped out a little bit
[4499.48 - 4502.56] the other day where I said something
[4500.76 - 4504.04] about it I read a comment I don't know
[4502.56 - 4505.76] if it was on YouTube or Instagram
[4504.04 - 4507.48] something like someone said he's the big
[4505.76 - 4509.32] medical medium he's never supposed to
[4507.48 - 4511.20] have a problem that's very suspicious
[4509.32 - 4513.32] that he had to heal a lung problem and
[4511.20 - 4515.60] it took a year to do it he must have
[4513.32 - 4517.28] been he I don't know if I trust his
[4515.60 - 4519.28] stuff now are you
[4517.28 - 4522.60] kidding it's a good chance I should have
[4519.28 - 4524.96] been dead after that years later with
[4522.60 - 4526.44] lung damage like that I healed it you
[4524.96 - 4527.68] using Spirit of compassion's information
[4526.44 - 4530.64] it was
[4527.68 - 4532.92] severe totally 100% healed but the point
[4530.64 - 4535.60] is and it healed within a
[4532.92 - 4538.08] year and yeah I had a doctor friend who
[4535.60 - 4539.80] was like are you on this thing I'm like

[4803.08 - 4808.80] like for a decade bed bound I lost my
[4805.60 - 4811.76] 20s that breaks my heart and so much
[4808.80 - 4815.92] excruciating pain daily I just finished
[4811.76 - 4818.12] nine backto backs Ben raw fat-free and
[4815.92 - 4820.24] salt-free since June oh my God so June
[4818.12 - 4822.96] July August September October November
[4820.24 - 4825.40] December we're in January Andrea that's
[4822.96 - 4826.88] mind-blowing mind-blowing okay I'm so
[4825.40 - 4829.32] sorry you were bedbound through your all
[4826.88 - 4831.04] through your 20s and you you know and
[4829.32 - 4832.52] you lost your 20s with sickness like
[4831.04 - 4835.36] that and so happy you're doing the
[4832.52 - 4840.80] backbacks that is amazing I'm proud of
[4835.36 - 4840.80] you just incredible incredible for
[4842.08 - 4845.68] real I'm choked
[4845.92 - 4851.24] up I think the hardest part the hardest
[4849.16 - 4852.72] part is knowing that you guys have
[4851.24 - 4854.20] suffered and many of you are still
[4852.72 - 4855.84] suffering and you're suffering now and
[4854.20 - 4857.32] it's hard and you're just starting your
[4855.84 - 4860.04] you know Journey or your journey needs
[4857.32 - 4863.20] to take more time because the problem is
[4860.04 - 4866.00] even when you kill off a pathogen you
[4863.20 - 4868.44] you know annihilate an epscene bar virus
[4866.00 - 4870.72] right the problem is you can pick up
[4868.44 - 4872.48] another one somehow and then have to go
[4870.72 - 4874.84] back and do it again and clean it up
[4872.48 - 4876.32] right another problem just say you
[4874.84 - 4878.36] annihilate your viral issue your
[4876.32 - 4881.16] shingles your epscene bar you annihilate
[4878.36 - 4883.76] something and you clean it up right okay
[4881.16 - 4885.92] but the neurotoxins are still left over
[4883.76 - 4888.16] in the liver and take a year or two to
[4885.92 - 4890.16] clean out because neurotoxins from the
[4888.16 - 4892.28] virus are toxic just as toxic as the
[4890.16 - 4894.56] virus itself so you're trying to clean
[4892.28 - 4896.80] up the neurotoxins and so your nerves
[4894.56 - 4898.40] are still short circuiting right and it
[4896.80 - 4900.08] takes time and now you're two years into
[4898.40 - 4902.44] it three years into it and now you're
[4900.08 - 4904.64] finally healing but you don't know you
[4902.44 - 4907.84] might not know to keep on the journey
[4904.64 - 4910.00] because you don't know it's hard it's
[4907.84 - 4911.84] hard when you know you have the viral
[4910.00 - 4914.20] stuff you have the Mercury you have the
[4911.84 - 4915.48] neurotoxins you have the metals you have
[4914.20 - 4917.32] other things that might have happened in
[4915.48 - 4919.48] your life like benzo or medical
[4917.32 - 4921.44] treatment right you might have like you
[4919.48 - 4923.16] know all these different things you're
[4921.44 - 4924.96] working on healing and it takes time and
[4923.16 - 4927.32] then the nervous system here's another
[4924.96 - 4929.56] thing too you can rid most of your
[4927.32 - 4931.56] toxins you can rid the
[4929.56 - 4934.04] pathogens you're you're on your way to
[4931.56 - 4935.60] healing but your nerves are damaged and
[4934.04 - 4937.96] they need time to
[4935.60 - 4941.28] heal and now you need to like ask your
[4937.96 - 4943.00] doctor about medical medium B12 you know
[4941.28 - 4945.80] B12 protocol where you're doing the you
[4943.00 - 4948.20] know the B12 protocol
[4945.80 - 4951.20] the whole
[4948.20 - 4953.48] bit you're doing the shock therapy a lot
[4951.20 - 4956.08] of people have a lot of emotional stuff
[4953.48 - 4958.16] come up and they're used to eating and
[4956.08 - 4961.36] numbing those emotions down and that's a
[4958.16 - 4963.56] tough one all on its own so man I get it
[4961.36 - 4965.04] life is hard are you kidding life is
[4963.56 - 4967.44] hard why do you think why do you think
[4965.04 - 4970.24] I'm not tough like I'm not tough on
[4967.44 - 4972.52] people you don't think I I I don't
[4970.24 - 4974.64] understand that eating a bag of chips is
[4972.52 - 4975.80] like helpful like feels helpful for
[4974.64 - 4977.40] emotional thing that you're going
[4975.80 - 4979.28] through you don't think I don't know
[4977.40 - 4981.60] that you don't think I don't know the
[4979.28 - 4984.00] big old you know bag of chips that like
[4981.60 - 4986.36] say say like an avocado oil chip or
[4984.00 - 4988.04] something or something an olive oil chip
[4986.36 - 4990.52] or something that's you know better for
[4988.04 - 4993.52] you whatever still right a big bag of
[4990.52 - 4995.80] chips you don't think I don't think that
[4993.52 - 4998.28] life isn't hard enough where we fall for
[4995.80 - 4999.76] that we do that of course I completely
[4998.28 - 5002.08] understand are you
[4999.76 - 5003.96] kidding someone goes for a cheeseburger
[5002.08 - 5005.80] I get it someone goes for some kind of
[5003.96 - 5007.76] like you know cream cheese on a bagel
[5005.80 - 5009.52] some goes a bag of chips cooking at ice
[5007.76 - 5012.24] cream in their you know fridge in their
[5009.52 - 5013.68] freezer you don't think like I know
[5012.24 - 5015.04] emotions they come up and they're coming
[5013.68 - 5017.24] up of course talk about it in the books
[5015.04 - 5019.64] too the and I've talked about it in in
[5017.24 - 5021.68] in an emotional live emotions come up
[5019.64 - 5023.84] and they surface they come out of cells
[5021.68 - 5025.76] emotions that are trapped with
[5023.84 - 5027.64] adrenaline I've written books from
[5025.76 - 5029.00] Spirit of compassion's information about
[5027.64 - 5031.72] this
[5029.00 - 5033.44] where the adrenaline in the moment of a
[5031.72 - 5036.76] hardship gets
[5033.44 - 5040.72] trapped trapped in the fat
[5036.76 - 5041.96] cells in organ tissue and then sits in
[5040.72 - 5043.76] there and then when you're trying to
[5041.96 - 5047.32] cleanse or you're trying to get it out
[5043.76 - 5049.68] it just releases and man sadness all
[5047.32 - 5051.88] kinds of emotional you know feelings
[5049.68 - 5053.84] hardship start to you ring up you
[5051.88 - 5056.28] trigger it easy boom boom you're
[5053.84 - 5058.12] triggered all this stuff can happen and
[5056.28 - 5061.12] then you're eating something mac and
[5058.12 - 5065.84] cheese bagels and cream cheese I don't
[5061.12 - 5068.80] know spam you know you're eating spam
[5065.84 - 5071.08] I mean yeah medical medium brain shot
[5068.80 - 5073.36] therapy can be very helpful when those
[5071.08 - 5075.96] emotional emotional things come up when
[5073.36 - 5078.52] you're trying to you're trying to battle
[5075.96 - 5080.60] that there's the Cravings shifter

[5296.52 - 5301.72] got a skin I do I do it's it's why
[5300.32 - 5302.76] Spirit of compassion came to me when I
[5301.72 - 5306.24] was four years
[5302.76 - 5311.32] old because I wasn't going to jump
[5306.24 - 5314.32] ship jump ship cuz hearing a voice from
[5311.32 - 5316.04] the outside not the inside I wish it was
[5314.32 - 5318.12] just scrambled up inside my own thoughts
[5316.04 - 5319.48] I wish it was that but hearing it on the
[5318.12 - 5321.36] outside and having no control over it
[5319.48 - 5325.16] and is actually on the
[5321.36 - 5327.28] outside yeah I hung in there so if you
[5325.16 - 5330.64] guys hang in there with me it makes it
[5327.28 - 5332.56] worth it it makes it worth it okay when
[5330.64 - 5334.44] the demons come knocking on doors on
[5332.56 - 5337.24] social and they're just like he's a bad
[5334.44 - 5338.64] guy whatever it is you know if you're in

[5364.76 - 5370.28] you
[5366.16 - 5372.12] guys just one last thing um we're
[5370.28 - 5373.40] getting closer to information and
[5372.12 - 5380.00] spiritual
[5373.40 - 5380.00] book so when's and where's and what's
[5380.20 - 5385.32] but look a lot of people ask me a lot of
[5383.44 - 5387.20] questions I've seen you guys ask me a
[5385.32 - 5389.12] lot of questions over the years I
[5387.20 - 5391.08] answered
[5389.12 - 5394.08] them I don't know if it's to my
[5391.08 - 5396.68] detriment or not but I answered them so
[5394.08 - 5397.88] so when you do get your hands on this
[5396.68 - 5402.52] and you read
[5397.88 - 5408.88] it or listen to it or whatever it is
[5402.52 - 5408.88] um just take one page at a time
[5409.00 - 5416.16] process all right you
[5411.36 - 5419.40] guys oh Jasmine do you wear earplugs to
[5416.16 - 5419.40] not hear
[5419.92 - 5425.64] Spirit I've played a lot of loud music
[5422.92 - 5429.88] I've tried the earplug
[5425.64 - 5432.76] you know but it got me into some
[5429.88 - 5435.76] situations by wearing
[5432.76 - 5435.76] earplugs
[5437.16 - 5442.24] so the problem is if I try to wear ear
[5440.08 - 5445.08] plugs to block out Spirit of compassion
[5442.24 - 5449.16] then I might not hear something I need
[5445.08 - 5451.56] to hear Spirit of compassion tell me and
[5449.16 - 5454.04] I've gotten into that jam a couple of
[5451.56 - 5457.04] times one that was
[5454.04 - 5457.04] grave
[5457.08 - 5462.16] and freaking
[5459.24 - 5464.24] grave yeah yeah and that was from
[5462.16 - 5465.64] plugging my ears and not wanting to hear
[5464.24 - 5467.28] Spirit of
[5465.64 - 5471.08] compassion
[5467.28 - 5474.32] yeah anyway are you
