[0.72 - 4.72] we're talking about bowel obstruction
[2.88 - 6.72] something that's happening every day to
[4.72 - 9.12] a lot of people we're going to go into
[6.72 - 10.56] why it's happening what the mystery is
[9.12 - 13.12] and i'm making
[10.56 - 14.56] garden potato dish right on top of it
[13.12 - 17.04] which is really fun
[14.56 - 19.88] so i got some onions grew those out of
[17.04 - 22.96] the garden which is really awesome
[19.88 - 24.40] potatoes growing out of the garden
[22.96 - 26.40] dirt's still on them so i gotta give
[24.40 - 27.76] them a quick rinse is what i'm gonna do
[26.40 - 28.72] good to see you guys i thought i would
[27.76 - 30.80] come on
[28.72 - 32.08] see how everybody's doing we're talking
[30.80 - 33.60] about a couple of different things to
[32.08 - 35.84] talk about bowel obstructions i don't
[33.60 - 38.16] know if you guys are seeing it a lot of
[35.84 - 40.96] people are getting belly aches
[38.16 - 43.52] they're getting pain and cramping
[40.96 - 46.48] many are going to the emergency room
[43.52 - 48.24] they're vomiting they're having problems
[46.48 - 51.28] and then they're being told you got a
[48.24 - 53.44] bowel obstruction get ready for surgery
[51.28 - 54.88] they stick a pipe down your throat then
[53.44 - 56.72] you got a pipe in your stomach and
[54.88 - 58.80] they're sucking air out is what they're
[56.72 - 61.36] doing so you sit in the hospital bed for
[58.80 - 62.96] a day you sit in a hospital bed for two
[61.36 - 64.56] days while you got a pipe down your
[62.96 - 67.28] throat sitting in your stomach and the
[64.56 - 68.80] pipe is sucking up air
[67.28 - 71.60] and you're being told we're gonna run
[68.80 - 73.36] another mri cat scan we're going to run
[71.60 - 75.28] another test right here and we're going
[73.36 - 76.80] to see how that obstruction is doing and
[75.28 - 78.80] you're like oh my god they say your
[76.80 - 81.28] obstruction is still there so we have to
[78.80 - 83.60] do emergency surgery and you go and you
[81.28 - 85.28] get a big part of the colon cut out and
[83.60 - 87.20] you get that cut out and everything and
[85.28 - 88.96] then they put you back together and they
[87.20 - 90.80] sew you up they you're in the hospital
[88.96 - 92.40] bed and like okay your bowel
[90.80 - 94.48] obstruction's better now and what's
[92.40 - 96.64] happening is it's not about obstruction
[94.48 - 98.16] maybe some people
[96.64 - 101.12] are getting bowel obstructions out there
[98.16 - 103.60] because they do but there's this wave a
[101.12 - 105.20] wave of chronic bowel obstructions
[103.60 - 106.96] hospitals are getting filled with people
[105.20 - 109.36] running in getting bowel obstructions
[106.96 - 111.28] and it's not happening so this is so
[109.36 - 113.20] that's you sharon lee norton says that's
[111.28 - 114.72] me thank you for covering this topic
[113.20 - 116.32] absolutely this is a really important
[114.72 - 118.72] topic we're going to talk about real
[116.32 - 120.48] bowel obstructions too but these are the
[118.72 - 122.24] mysterious
[120.48 - 123.92] bowel obstructions people are getting
[122.24 - 126.40] diagnosed with that aren't real bowel
[123.92 - 129.60] obstructions because it's a bug going
[126.40 - 132.32] around and it's a bug that go is going
[129.60 - 134.80] around right now people had the bug two
[132.32 - 136.16] weeks later after the bug boom they get
[134.80 - 137.44] hit with this bowel obstruction they're
[136.16 - 139.44] at the emergency room so we're gonna
[137.44 - 140.88] cover it in detail but i gotta get my
[139.44 - 142.64] food going
[140.88 - 144.24] so i'm gonna make a potato dish just
[142.64 - 146.48] something quick thrown together this is
[144.24 - 148.32] really cool i got these patty pans right
[146.48 - 149.68] here out of the garden which is really
[148.32 - 151.60] exciting you guys good to see you guys
[149.68 - 152.72] coming on here so i got these these are
[151.60 - 155.44] straight out of the garden have you guys
[152.72 - 158.32] grown these before these are so fun to
[155.44 - 160.48] grow they grow so quick the plants get
[158.32 - 162.24] so strong right
[160.48 - 165.12] and then these patty pans are so fun to
[162.24 - 167.36] pick so great look at that is that crazy
[165.12 - 169.12] i mean the way they look right love
[167.36 - 171.84] growing every year for years i've been
[169.12 - 174.08] growing those for so long now i love it
[171.84 - 175.60] we're gonna throw that in the pan too
[174.08 - 178.48] onions like i said they came out of the
[175.60 - 180.64] garden i cured them right so they're not
[178.48 - 182.48] that they're not fresh out of the garden
[180.64 - 184.40] they're actually cured they've been
[182.48 - 185.76] sitting around for a while right you got
[184.40 - 188.80] to watch out they don't mold up you got
[185.76 - 191.12] to know how to cure them okay cilantro
[188.80 - 192.72] out of the garden too how exciting is
[191.12 - 194.80] that right
[192.72 - 195.84] and then the potatoes i showed you and
[194.80 - 197.84] i'm going to show you again we're going
[195.84 - 200.24] to do a little rinse and wash good to
[197.84 - 201.76] see you guys coming on here and
[200.24 - 203.84] peppers
[201.76 - 207.28] hot peppers out of the garden now these
[203.84 - 208.88] are green right so i picked these early
[207.28 - 210.96] so i usually like to leave them red
[208.88 - 213.12] because green peppers are not ripe and
[210.96 - 215.60] that's what gives people trouble unripe
[213.12 - 217.52] peppers right unripe ones and i talk
[215.60 - 218.32] about that all the time
[217.52 - 220.00] but
[218.32 - 221.52] these are
[220.00 - 223.04] that see how it's almost turning red and
[221.52 - 224.96] i'll show you some close-ups in a little
[223.04 - 226.80] bit too i'll tell you why i picked them
[224.96 - 228.96] green to begin with which is pretty
[226.80 - 231.44] funny because i don't usually do that i
[228.96 - 234.00] picked them green for a reason
[231.44 - 235.68] because i had a bunny rabbit that was
[234.00 - 238.00] going after all the peppers and i was
[235.68 - 240.16] like how's that how's that possible
[238.00 - 241.76] because those are hot but you know
[240.16 - 242.64] squirrels and bunny rabbits were really
[241.76 - 244.48] hungry
[242.64 - 246.56] so we're live right now you guys we're
[244.48 - 247.68] live and i'm excited so let me just cook
[246.56 - 250.16] a little bit we're going to talk about
[247.68 - 251.52] bowel obstructions as well
[250.16 - 253.84] and we're going to do a little demo
[251.52 - 255.04] about that talk about the gut a little
[253.84 - 258.48] bit too
[255.04 - 259.92] so let's get going let's get some onions
[258.48 - 261.76] right here so i'm going to cut some
[259.92 - 263.20] onions right now
[261.76 - 266.40] i love when onions come out of the
[263.20 - 266.40] garden it's really
[266.84 - 270.24] exciting everything that comes out of
[268.80 - 271.52] the garden always seems like it tastes
[270.24 - 273.04] the best right
[271.52 - 274.32] so that's that's what it always seems
[273.04 - 276.08] like i'm going to put the garbage can
[274.32 - 278.32] right here too so i can drop some in
[276.08 - 278.32] there
[279.84 - 284.56] and i like to save all that too and
[282.64 - 288.08] throw it in a pile and
[284.56 - 289.68] make some future dirt right
[288.08 - 291.28] so what i'm doing is i'm just getting a
[289.68 - 292.48] couple of onions
[291.28 - 295.52] ready here
[292.48 - 297.92] good to see you guys coming on
[295.52 - 300.32] so we're live right now
[297.92 - 302.24] i'm excited making a garden
[300.32 - 303.52] vegetable potato dish
[302.24 - 306.16] why not
[303.52 - 309.60] kind of excited about that right i got
[306.16 - 311.36] the pan on right there it's getting hot
[309.60 - 313.28] peeling back some onions and we're going
[311.36 - 316.00] to talk about bowel obstructions at the
[313.28 - 318.40] same time a lot of people have
[316.00 - 321.36] chronic bowel obstructions because they
[318.40 - 323.52] have crohn's colitis they have difficult
[321.36 - 325.12] with their intestinal tract because
[323.52 - 326.48] difficulties with their intestinal tract
[325.12 - 328.08] because
[326.48 - 329.76] they're inflamed so inside their
[328.08 - 330.96] intestinal tract they're inflamed so as
[329.76 - 332.72] the food is moving through their
[330.96 - 335.52] intestinal tract they're having many
[332.72 - 337.20] obstructions all the time
[335.52 - 338.64] there's a lot of people that have to
[337.20 - 339.68] live with that and they have to go
[338.64 - 342.80] through that
[339.68 - 345.68] okay and then there's that random acute
[342.80 - 347.20] bowel obstruction right it's acute it's
[345.68 - 348.16] random
[347.20 - 350.80] okay
[348.16 - 352.16] and we have those two out there people
[350.80 - 353.76] do get about obstruction i'm going to
[352.16 - 356.08] talk about a couple of stories about
[353.76 - 358.00] that how serious this could be and then
[356.08 - 360.24] there's this mystery about obstruction
[358.00 - 363.52] that's not about obstruction that's
[360.24 - 365.36] happening after someone gets a bug so
[363.52 - 367.44] they're getting a bug that bug either
[365.36 - 370.00] gets diagnosed as the flu it gets
[367.44 - 371.60] diagnosed as the c word it gets
[370.00 - 374.56] diagnosed as
[371.60 - 378.24] something like that or a stomach bug or
[374.56 - 380.56] diagnosed as food poisoning
[378.24 - 382.48] right and then everything's fine it goes
[380.56 - 383.84] away a couple weeks later all is fine
[382.48 - 386.40] they're back to work they're back to
[383.84 - 388.08] life and then they get stomach pain
[386.40 - 389.44] and then they're like vomiting
[388.08 - 391.44] something's wrong they go to the
[389.44 - 393.72] emergency room and they're like bowel

[471.60 - 475.68] i want to get this meal going really
[476.24 - 480.48] so i'm cutting some onions came fresh
[478.48 - 482.16] out of the garden
[480.48 - 483.92] at one point and then i cured these
[482.16 - 485.52] they've been sitting around for a while
[483.92 - 488.64] good to see you guys david witchen you
[485.52 - 488.64] want to see the twitch dance
[490.48 - 495.36] okay melissa do potatoes become toxic
[493.28 - 498.32] when they start to turn green
[495.36 - 500.48] yeah don't eat them when they're green
[498.32 - 502.48] that's not a good idea don't eat them
[500.48 - 504.72] when they're green if it's all you got
[502.48 - 507.04] it's the only food you have you can peel
[504.72 - 509.44] back some of the green or all the green
[507.04 - 511.44] you see right but i don't eat cream
[509.44 - 513.68] potatoes
[511.44 - 516.72] so a lot of fruits and vegetables that
[513.68 - 520.00] if you know that that become toxic
[516.72 - 521.68] for a lot of different reasons
[520.00 - 524.96] just like when you have meat meat
[521.68 - 526.40] becomes toxic when it's when it's brown
[524.96 - 528.72] you know when meat turns brown you know
[526.40 - 531.92] what they do they coat the meat
[528.72 - 534.72] they coat beef with a chemical right a
[531.92 - 538.08] sulfur chemical and that sulfur chemical
[534.72 - 539.84] keeps it from turning brown in the store
[538.08 - 541.12] that's just really that's that's that's
[539.84 - 544.72] not good
[541.12 - 544.72] that's not good let's get some uh
[545.44 - 550.56] everything has the potential of having a
[547.60 - 550.56] problem right
[551.36 - 556.24] so you got to know
[552.56 - 556.24] know what to do when to do whatever
[556.64 - 560.48] thrown some onions in the pan let's get
[558.48 - 562.80] this cooking
[560.48 - 565.60] jennifer says when in doubt throw it out
[562.80 - 567.28] on facebook right there
[565.60 - 569.36] guys we're live right now
[567.28 - 572.48] i'm gonna put another onion in here
[569.36 - 572.48] one more let's do that
[572.56 - 575.52] let's get another onion going
[574.40 - 577.28] guys we're talking about bowel
[575.52 - 579.60] obstructions i want to do a little demo
[577.28 - 580.96] real quick too
[579.60 - 583.20] about it
[580.96 - 583.20] right
[583.44 - 590.64] so the emergency rooms
[586.16 - 592.72] for the last six to eight weeks
[590.64 - 597.68] have been filling up with a lot of these
[592.72 - 597.68] mysterious bowel obstruction cases
[598.40 - 602.16] it's usually a couple of weeks after
[600.40 - 604.56] they were sick
[602.16 - 606.32] with a cold a flu
[604.56 - 607.60] or the seed
[606.32 - 609.92] right
[607.60 - 611.92] and then they get better they're moving
[609.92 - 614.16] forward and all of a sudden they get
[611.92 - 617.68] this bowel obstruction because
[614.16 - 618.96] that bug they had
[617.68 - 621.96] created
[618.96 - 621.96] inflammation
[622.48 - 625.36] in the colon
[626.72 - 632.48] not allowing food to get through so easy
[629.36 - 635.68] but yet it's not a bowel obstruction
[632.48 - 637.04] it's just an inflamed area
[635.68 - 639.36] and then what they do is they stick a
[637.04 - 639.36] pipe
[639.44 - 643.92] down your throat
[641.84 - 648.32] another thing this bug is doing is
[643.92 - 648.32] creating a neurological spasm
[649.12 - 653.76] a vagus nerve spasm
[651.28 - 655.92] in the intestinal tract locking it up
[653.76 - 657.76] causing paralysis of the intestinal
[655.92 - 659.44] tract so it's not really technically
[657.76 - 662.16] about obstruction there's a temporary
[659.44 - 664.64] paralysis and inflammation
[662.16 - 666.88] that's happening
[664.64 - 669.28] and then what the sad part is if they
[666.88 - 671.52] don't have a good doctor if they don't
[669.28 - 673.20] have a good health practitioner that's
[671.52 - 674.72] looking out for them they'll go and get
[673.20 - 676.40] the surgery
[674.72 - 678.40] they'll get thrown into the surgery so
[676.40 - 680.40] there's thousands of people across this
[678.40 - 681.60] country right now and also other places
[680.40 - 684.40] around the world
[681.60 - 686.32] that are getting bowel surgery and
[684.40 - 689.60] getting a piece of their colon removed
[686.32 - 691.36] for no reason because they don't know it
[689.60 - 693.28] at the emergency room and at the
[691.36 - 694.56] hospitals they don't know that this is a
[693.28 - 697.44] bug going around
[694.56 - 698.72] causing temporary paralysis of
[697.44 - 700.48] the colon
[698.72 - 701.76] and it's been being misdiagnosed as
[700.48 - 703.52] about structure now don't get this
[701.76 - 705.04] confused with real bowel obstructions
[703.52 - 707.60] people can have a real bowel obstruction
[705.04 - 710.08] i've seen it happen throughout the years

[951.20 - 954.88] kind of hard
[952.48 - 956.48] and you've got teeth problems or
[954.88 - 958.00] you got somebody got a relative or
[956.48 - 959.60] somebody or a friend that comes over and

[978.88 - 983.84] a moment we're going to let that cook
[980.96 - 987.36] down look at that
[983.84 - 990.16] i only put one potato in there
[987.36 - 991.92] but it was one big potato so
[990.16 - 993.92] i mean you can do three potatoes in
[991.92 - 995.60] there you can do four you can do as many
[993.92 - 997.68] potatoes as you want in your dish you
[995.60 - 1000.88] can make it the way you want it right
[997.68 - 1003.28] this is kind of a medley of stuff
[1000.88 - 1003.28] all right
[1003.68 - 1006.88] let me
[1004.56 - 1009.12] do this make sure this is high on
[1006.88 - 1011.68] maximum
[1009.12 - 1013.44] put this lid on top let that steam up
[1011.68 - 1014.72] and cook let's get down to it we're
[1013.44 - 1016.96] going to throw some peppers in there in
[1014.72 - 1019.28] a little while
[1016.96 - 1021.12] and the cilantro we're going to throw on
[1019.28 - 1023.28] last which is really exciting we'll do
[1021.12 - 1025.20] that too
[1023.28 - 1026.88] so let's get into it a little bit you
[1025.20 - 1028.64] guys just got here talking about bowel
[1026.88 - 1030.48] obstructions there's mysterious bowel
[1028.64 - 1032.72] obstructions happening everywhere
[1030.48 - 1036.00] hospitals are getting filled with people
[1032.72 - 1037.28] so let's go into this
[1036.00 - 1040.48] i have
[1037.28 - 1040.48] personally saved
[1040.96 - 1044.08] a couple of people
[1044.24 - 1047.92] you know old friends been friends with
[1046.24 - 1049.28] for many years
[1047.92 - 1051.68] got a hold of me and said i'm in the
[1049.28 - 1052.40] hospital right now i gotta pipe down my
[1051.68 - 1055.28] throat
[1052.40 - 1056.80] in my stomach
[1055.28 - 1058.32] they said i got a bowel obstruction but
[1056.80 - 1060.80] i've never had a problem like that
[1058.32 - 1060.80] before
[1060.96 - 1065.20] okay so here we go
[1063.44 - 1067.12] so there's a new bug that's been going
[1065.20 - 1069.20] on it's out there it's been happening
[1067.12 - 1070.48] for about two months now a little bit
[1069.20 - 1072.16] over two months i think it's gonna
[1070.48 - 1073.52] eventually get to the tail end pretty
[1072.16 - 1074.80] soon it's a lot of different bugs
[1073.52 - 1076.40] floating around right now a lot of
[1074.80 - 1078.40] different flues so forth and all that
[1076.40 - 1081.36] right and seas and all that so there's a
[1078.40 - 1082.88] lot of that happening out there so
[1081.36 - 1084.80] but there's there's one of the bugs
[1082.88 - 1087.28] that's out there right now it gets into
[1084.80 - 1089.04] people they often have congestion they
[1087.28 - 1091.28] have congestion they have the sinus
[1089.04 - 1093.92] problems right they have a fever they
[1091.28 - 1095.92] don't feel good well i got the flu maybe
[1093.92 - 1099.20] one one time to get diagnosed with oh
[1095.92 - 1100.88] it's the c or oh it's the flu or doctor
[1099.20 - 1102.64] says it's a cold or feels like a cold
[1100.88 - 1104.48] then it goes away right
[1102.64 - 1106.24] they get it to go away a weekly meeting
[1104.48 - 1107.84] goes away naturally whatever maybe
[1106.24 - 1110.32] they're doing some natural stuff to help
[1107.84 - 1112.00] it whatever it is and eventually they're
[1110.32 - 1113.12] fine they're out of the woods okay i got
[1112.00 - 1114.72] over that that's great and all of a
[1113.12 - 1117.44] sudden oh my god
[1114.72 - 1118.88] oh my god what is this what is this
[1117.44 - 1121.60] and they're either vomiting or they're
[1118.88 - 1123.12] just in severe intestinal tract pain
[1121.60 - 1124.24] cramping in the gut and they don't
[1123.12 - 1126.72] understand what it is is this
[1124.24 - 1128.88] appendicitis what is this and they go to
[1126.72 - 1132.16] the emergency room
[1128.88 - 1134.16] right they get to the emergency room
[1132.16 - 1136.16] and then the doctor says we think it's
[1134.16 - 1138.24] an obstruction we're going to do a test
[1136.16 - 1140.48] and they get a test they get the cat
[1138.24 - 1142.24] scan they get or an mri usually it's a
[1140.48 - 1144.00] cat scan with this and that's one of the
[1142.24 - 1145.92] tests they do well your cat scan shows
[1144.00 - 1148.08] that you have an obstruction well i
[1145.92 - 1149.84] don't i don't know why i've never had a
[1148.08 - 1151.52] problem i didn't eat anything crazy
[1149.84 - 1153.04] what's going on here where you got an
[1151.52 - 1154.88] obstruction is what they say and this is
[1153.04 - 1156.96] what's happening all in these hospitals
[1154.88 - 1158.40] all in this country and around the world
[1156.96 - 1160.08] are saying this doctor's like you got
[1158.40 - 1162.64] ma'am you got an obstruction and in the
[1160.08 - 1164.32] next room you sir you got an obstruction
[1162.64 - 1165.68] i actually talked to somebody recently
[1164.32 - 1167.68] an emergency room doctor who's a friend
[1165.68 - 1169.04] of mine that said literally three rooms
[1167.68 - 1170.80] like one room over here that's an
[1169.04 - 1173.04] obstruction another person was diagnosed
[1170.80 - 1174.40] with obstruction three rooms down and
[1173.04 - 1175.84] then one room and then they you know
[1174.40 - 1177.20] another room and then they rush them up
[1175.84 - 1178.96] and there and they get them ready so
[1177.20 - 1180.24] what they do is
[1178.96 - 1181.92] they they get told they got this
[1180.24 - 1183.20] obstruction they get a pipe down their
[1181.92 - 1185.68] throat right
[1183.20 - 1188.00] and the pipe is to suck air out or any
[1185.68 - 1189.76] contents in the stomach so that's what
[1188.00 - 1191.92] they're doing so they put the pipe down
[1189.76 - 1195.04] the pipe goes down into the stomach and
[1191.92 - 1196.96] then the pipe is sitting there vacuuming
[1195.04 - 1198.24] it's vacuuming so now you're in bed and
[1196.96 - 1200.40] you're stuck and you're like what is
[1198.24 - 1202.16] this i never had this problem before i'm
[1200.40 - 1203.44] told i have an obstruction and thinking
[1202.16 - 1205.84] you got a pipe and it's down it's
[1203.44 - 1207.68] sitting inside your stomach right here
[1205.84 - 1210.40] and it's dry it's sucking air and it's
[1207.68 - 1212.16] sucking air and that's what's happening
[1210.40 - 1214.56] stellini says are these vegetables from
[1212.16 - 1216.64] your garden yes they are they actually
[1214.56 - 1218.16] are from my garden which is such a
[1216.64 - 1218.96] blessing truly
[1218.16 - 1220.64] um
[1218.96 - 1222.16] all right so let's go into this the pipe
[1220.64 - 1223.68] sits in the stomach and you sit there
[1222.16 - 1225.36] for a day or two while they run you
[1223.68 - 1227.28] through tests and what they tell you is
[1225.36 - 1229.84] you're gonna need surgery because we see
[1227.28 - 1231.92] the obstruction it's on the test it's on
[1229.84 - 1234.96] the scan but what they're seeing is a
[1231.92 - 1237.52] lock up yeah it's not an obstruction but
[1234.96 - 1240.56] they're seeing fecal matter in an area
[1237.52 - 1242.64] that had that has temporary paralysis
[1240.56 - 1244.88] that's what they're seeing all right
[1242.64 - 1247.12] from for all these random cases all
[1244.88 - 1249.68] these random mystery cases it's not
[1247.12 - 1251.12] somebody who's who's known to have
[1249.68 - 1252.64] obstructions throughout their life
[1251.12 - 1254.24] they've had multiple surgeries they've
[1252.64 - 1256.48] got a tremendous amount of scar tissue
[1254.24 - 1258.24] when they get obstructions periodically
[1256.48 - 1260.24] you know that's different or someone who
[1258.24 - 1262.64] gets a kink someone who actually gets a
[1260.24 - 1264.80] kink in the intestinal tract where they
[1262.64 - 1265.92] actually get a kink and when that kink
[1264.80 - 1267.28] happens
[1265.92 - 1269.52] then they're in trouble and they have to
[1267.28 - 1270.88] get surgery if it can't work itself out
[1269.52 - 1272.56] they need to get surgery now that's
[1270.88 - 1274.84] different now that happens out there i
[1272.56 - 1277.36] see a lot of people get kinks in their
[1274.84 - 1279.04] colon they get kinks in their small
[1277.36 - 1280.16] intestinal tract
[1279.04 - 1282.32] and
[1280.16 - 1284.08] that's what goes on right but this is
[1282.32 - 1285.28] different this is temporary paralysis of
[1284.08 - 1287.12] a certain area of the colon or
[1285.28 - 1289.92] intestinal tract because the nerves
[1287.12 - 1291.60] going to that stop working because the
[1289.92 - 1292.96] bug that's going around in the last
[1291.60 - 1296.32] couple of months
[1292.96 - 1298.72] is seizing up the nerve
[1296.32 - 1301.20] in that area
[1298.72 - 1303.12] and then inflammation also occurs in
[1301.20 - 1306.08] that area too the bug can do two things
[1303.12 - 1307.84] it attacks the nerves in that area or
[1306.08 - 1309.92] inflames that area of the intestinal
[1307.84 - 1311.60] tract and then that swelling happens
[1309.92 - 1313.92] just enough swelling along with
[1311.60 - 1315.28] paralysis that food's not moving through
[1313.92 - 1317.84] too easy
[1315.28 - 1320.56] but the symptom isn't just because of
[1317.84 - 1322.88] that the symptom is it's it's a delayed
[1320.56 - 1325.68] reaction this bug has
[1322.88 - 1327.04] elizabeth says it was all viral yeah
[1325.68 - 1328.64] it is it's happening out there all the
[1327.04 - 1329.84] time so really they're having a viral
[1328.64 - 1331.36] infection
[1329.84 - 1332.48] viral infection causing temporary
[1331.36 - 1334.56] paralysis
[1332.48 - 1336.40] of the intestinal tract or
[1334.56 - 1337.92] colon okay
[1336.40 - 1340.16] and then they're getting diagnosed
[1337.92 - 1341.52] misdiagnosed with bowel obstruction and
[1340.16 - 1343.20] they're getting their colons removed now
[1341.52 - 1344.96] here's the thing after somebody that had
[1343.20 - 1347.52] a c-section so say you're a woman you
[1344.96 - 1349.60] had your you had a c-section
[1347.52 - 1351.52] and you know that's that's
[1349.60 - 1353.84] that you know during your pregnancy you
[1351.52 - 1356.24] have the c-section if that happened
[1353.84 - 1359.52] they'll blame the scar tissue from your
[1356.24 - 1360.72] c-section as this bowel obstruction say
[1359.52 - 1363.28] you're somebody that had a hernia
[1360.72 - 1365.28] surgery so if anybody had any kind of
[1363.28 - 1366.64] hernia surgery regardless of the hernia
[1365.28 - 1368.64] surgery wherever it is if it was a
[1366.64 - 1370.48] hernia to the left it was a herniated to
[1368.64 - 1373.36] the right if it was a hernia in the
[1370.48 - 1375.52] middle wherever the hernia was
[1373.36 - 1378.64] if they did a previous hernia surgery
[1375.52 - 1379.68] they'll then tell the the
[1378.64 - 1382.24] patient
[1379.68 - 1385.52] that the scar tissue from the hernia
[1382.24 - 1387.52] surgery they had 20 years ago over here
[1385.52 - 1389.76] is why they have a bowel obstruction
[1387.52 - 1391.28] over here that's what they're told
[1389.76 - 1393.92] they're told the bowel obstruction is
[1391.28 - 1395.68] because of scar tissue from a hernia
[1393.92 - 1397.52] surgery that's somewhere else now i'm
[1395.68 - 1399.84] seeing this out there
[1397.52 - 1401.92] happening where people had okay yeah i
[1399.84 - 1403.20] had a hernia 30 years ago they'll say to
[1401.92 - 1404.88] the doctor and they'll say well that
[1403.20 - 1406.64] hernia scar tissue down here is the
[1404.88 - 1408.16] reason why you have bowel obstruction
[1406.64 - 1410.72] over here so we're going to need surgery
[1408.16 - 1412.64] now and get that bowel obstruction fixed
[1410.72 - 1415.36] so that's what's going on right now i'm
[1412.64 - 1417.84] just going to move
[1415.36 - 1420.96] this guy over a little bit and just make
[1417.84 - 1420.96] sure this is cooking up
[1422.64 - 1427.52] so i put the lid on the pan
[1424.72 - 1429.12] it gets the moisture from the squash is
[1427.52 - 1431.68] actually
[1429.12 - 1433.68] moving helping everything stay moist so
[1431.68 - 1435.44] nothing's burning in the pan the onion
[1433.68 - 1436.64] the moisture from the onion is actually
[1435.44 - 1438.56] helping too
[1436.64 - 1440.40] and then i have that potato that garden
[1438.56 - 1441.84] potato with this garden squash garden
[1440.40 - 1444.24] onions i have it all
[1441.84 - 1446.24] in the process of kind of steaming up
[1444.24 - 1450.32] and cooking i have this little portable
[1446.24 - 1450.32] burner i got it on maximum right now
[1453.76 - 1458.40] now there are people that actually have
[1455.92 - 1460.16] crohn's colitis they have
[1458.40 - 1463.04] large amounts of inflammation inside the
[1460.16 - 1465.20] intestinal tract and inside the colon
[1463.04 - 1467.68] and so they have a narrowing
[1465.20 - 1469.28] and if they eat something problematic
[1467.68 - 1470.64] you can have a problem i remember a long
[1469.28 - 1474.00] time ago
[1470.64 - 1476.88] a doctor sent a patient to me
[1474.00 - 1478.64] that had that type of inflammation that
[1476.88 - 1479.60] type of swelling inside the intestinal
[1478.64 - 1481.04] tract
[1479.60 - 1483.84] and the patient
[1481.04 - 1487.04] already had a surgery
[1483.84 - 1488.72] the surgery happened because
[1487.04 - 1491.04] they had
[1488.72 - 1493.36] a cheeseburger at a cookout
[1491.04 - 1494.96] really tough meat in the cheeseburger
[1493.36 - 1497.68] that's what they said it was a big large
[1494.96 - 1499.84] cheeseburger at a cookout this is an
[1497.68 - 1501.04] anti-animal protein anti-vegan that's
[1499.84 - 1504.88] not what this is about i'm just giving
[1501.04 - 1506.00] you guys this person's experience right
[1504.88 - 1507.60] and
[1506.00 - 1510.24] she said that
[1507.60 - 1512.64] she had the burger and then that night
[1510.24 - 1517.04] she had the vomiting she had
[1512.64 - 1519.68] the pain and she had a real obstruction
[1517.04 - 1522.48] that meat was stuck so it was stuck the
[1519.68 - 1526.16] gristle and the beef and the gristle and
[1522.48 - 1528.64] that it wasn't really a soft beef
[1526.16 - 1530.88] it wasn't tender and that gristle and
[1528.64 - 1533.20] that beef it just all kind of locked up
[1530.88 - 1535.76] by a spot that the person was already
[1533.20 - 1537.76] inflamed and so that became a real
[1535.76 - 1539.92] obstruction so they had to get surgery
[1537.76 - 1542.16] so they had to get a piece of the colon
[1539.92 - 1544.16] cut out they had to get the obstruction
[1542.16 - 1547.84] fixed right they had to get the
[1544.16 - 1549.68] the obstruction removed and so
[1547.84 - 1551.36] i've known many stories over the years
[1549.68 - 1553.28] that are something similar to this but
[1551.36 - 1555.44] this is different
[1553.28 - 1556.48] than what's happening right now
[1555.44 - 1558.08] so
[1556.48 - 1559.84] here's the interesting thing you think
[1558.08 - 1561.28] that this would set off an alarm out
[1559.84 - 1562.48] there so people would know so they're
[1561.28 - 1564.16] they're not getting their colons
[1562.48 - 1566.08] intestinal tracts being cut out right
[1564.16 - 1567.76] now for no reason with a misdiagnosis of
[1566.08 - 1569.68] bowel obstruction when really it's left
[1567.76 - 1571.76] over from a viral infection
[1569.68 - 1573.92] creating temporary paralysis
[1571.76 - 1575.76] of a colon in small intestinal tract you
[1573.92 - 1576.72] think that the alarm would get set off
[1575.76 - 1578.40] like don't you think it would be a
[1576.72 - 1580.08] little suspicious now every single
[1578.40 - 1582.32] hospital has people pouring in with the
[1580.08 - 1583.76] bowel obstruction diagnosis
[1582.32 - 1585.84] meanwhile they're lining up colon
[1583.76 - 1588.16] surgeons and they're just
[1585.84 - 1589.84] just cutting people's colons out
[1588.16 - 1591.76] for this mysterious bowel obstruction
[1589.84 - 1594.00] problem you think they would kind of put
[1591.76 - 1595.76] two and two together and be like whoa
[1594.00 - 1597.20] something's wrong here
[1595.76 - 1599.28] why is everybody having a bowel
[1597.20 - 1601.68] obstruction how come the hospital had 30
[1599.28 - 1603.60] bowel obstructions just last night how
[1601.68 - 1605.60] come this hospital down the road had
[1603.60 - 1607.28] another 10 how about this hospital over
[1605.60 - 1608.96] here shouldn't they communicate with
[1607.28 - 1611.12] each other no they don't and this is how
[1608.96 - 1613.60] medicine works these days and always has
[1611.12 - 1615.28] in the past no communication doesn't
[1613.60 - 1616.24] matter what happens to people and who
[1615.28 - 1617.84] cares
[1616.24 - 1620.72] that's how it's always been in medicine
[1617.84 - 1622.88] in the world of medicine so
[1620.72 - 1625.36] so right now people are getting for no
[1622.88 - 1627.28] reason their bowels cut out
[1625.36 - 1629.36] from a viral infection that's just
[1627.28 - 1631.44] creating temporary paralysis and
[1629.36 - 1633.28] inflammation in the colon and small
[1631.44 - 1635.28] intestinal tract now with that being
[1633.28 - 1637.68] said if you're somebody though
[1635.28 - 1639.52] right that you have a lot of intestinal
[1637.68 - 1642.64] tract problems and you're and you've
[1639.52 - 1644.08] been known to have severe constipation
[1642.64 - 1645.44] from blockages
[1644.08 - 1647.44] that could be an entirely different
[1645.44 - 1649.68] story if you're somebody that's known to
[1647.44 - 1651.68] have in your life
[1649.68 - 1652.72] severe constipation
[1651.68 - 1655.52] to the point where you don't go to
[1652.72 - 1658.32] bathroom for a week or so and it gets
[1655.52 - 1661.20] blocked up and you have obstructions of
[1658.32 - 1662.96] fecal matter that's different and you're
[1661.20 - 1664.32] usually taking laxatives or taking
[1662.96 - 1665.76] prescription laxatives and you're
[1664.32 - 1668.32] dealing with lots of doctor visits
[1665.76 - 1670.08] that's a different story than someone
[1668.32 - 1671.44] who hasn't had any problems at all with
[1670.08 - 1673.68] any of this and that's what's happening
[1671.44 - 1674.96] the hospitals are being being filled up
[1673.68 - 1676.88] all around this country and around the
[1674.96 - 1678.80] world with people coming in that never
[1676.88 - 1681.68] had a problem at all of their intestinal
[1678.80 - 1683.60] tract or colon or any issues to that
[1681.68 - 1684.96] degree maybe they had a little bit of
[1683.60 - 1686.80] bloating maybe they have a little
[1684.96 - 1688.56] digestive weakness maybe they have
[1686.80 - 1690.48] something else going on right or
[1688.56 - 1691.28] something like h pylori or whatever it
[1690.48 - 1693.68] is
[1691.28 - 1695.52] but they never had something serious and
[1693.68 - 1697.84] then they get this bowel obstruction a
[1695.52 - 1700.48] couple of weeks two three weeks later or
[1697.84 - 1702.48] one week later after they had a cold
[1700.48 - 1705.52] and that cold was a virus that virus
[1702.48 - 1706.56] going around wasn't a cold per se
[1705.52 - 1708.96] um
[1706.56 - 1711.28] arlene says my daughter that has celiac
[1708.96 - 1712.72] ended up in the emergency room with this
[1711.28 - 1715.52] throwing up well that's what it is they
[1712.72 - 1717.68] end up in the emergency room throwing up
[1715.52 - 1719.52] that's how it works
[1717.68 - 1720.64] and as they're in the emergency throwing
[1719.52 - 1723.84] up
[1720.64 - 1725.76] right now what the standard protocol in
[1723.84 - 1727.44] the emergency room is they admit you
[1725.76 - 1729.60] into the hospital they stick a pipe down
[1727.44 - 1732.24] your throat into your stomach and they
[1729.60 - 1734.80] just suck up and vacuum any contact
[1732.24 - 1739.08] contents and any air for the next two
[1734.80 - 1739.08] days while they prep you for surgery
[1740.24 - 1744.16] so you're going to take a look here
[1742.56 - 1746.64] michelle l good to see you why do
[1744.16 - 1748.56] stomach nerves affect nerves in my feet
[1746.64 - 1750.24] though
[1748.56 - 1752.32] well you know the problem is with nerves
[1750.24 - 1753.68] is they tend to all somewhat connect to
[1752.32 - 1755.28] each other no matter what and they all
[1753.68 - 1757.28] end up in the central nervous system
[1755.28 - 1759.12] which is your brain so in the end they
[1757.28 - 1760.96] all have the same root going to the
[1759.12 - 1763.12] brain to one way or another
[1760.96 - 1764.56] so all nerves connect to another nerve
[1763.12 - 1766.48] which connects to another nerve that
[1764.56 - 1767.52] ends up somewhere finding its way to the
[1766.48 - 1769.20] brain
[1767.52 - 1770.80] and that's why because you know if you
[1769.20 - 1773.36] have other nerve sensitivities from
[1770.80 - 1775.52] inflammation in other areas like some
[1773.36 - 1777.76] type of neuropathy or any kind of nerve
[1775.52 - 1779.68] sensations nerve nerve damage nerve
[1777.76 - 1782.24] issues of any kind or just inflamed
[1779.68 - 1784.40] nerves from neurotoxins and stuff like
[1782.24 - 1785.92] that anytime your nerves get inflamed
[1784.40 - 1788.16] other nerves can hurt too in other
[1785.92 - 1789.52] places it's very difficult for a lot of
[1788.16 - 1790.88] people that deal with it i want to show
[1789.52 - 1792.56] you right here close up on this dish
[1790.88 - 1795.28] right here to you guys so what i'm doing
[1792.56 - 1798.56] is i'm cooking these garden potatoes
[1795.28 - 1799.84] right patty pan squash onions
[1798.56 - 1801.36] i'm gonna throw a pepper in there a
[1799.84 - 1803.60] little bit i want to keep on steaming
[1801.36 - 1805.76] this up a little bit too get it going
[1803.60 - 1809.28] got got it on high heat
[1805.76 - 1812.80] talking about bowel obstructions
[1809.28 - 1815.40] rosita when i eat potatoes
[1812.80 - 1818.88] i need potatoes my belly swells i have
[1815.40 - 1820.16] ulcerative colitis right so what i tell
[1818.88 - 1822.00] people
[1820.16 - 1823.92] and i talk to doctors a lot helping them
[1822.00 - 1824.96] with their patients is
[1823.92 - 1828.16] that
[1824.96 - 1831.60] what's on the potato like what's on it
[1828.16 - 1834.64] was it sour cream was it mayonnaise
[1831.60 - 1837.44] was it oil was it any kind of fat like
[1834.64 - 1839.20] an oil-based fat was it with
[1837.44 - 1841.44] an animal fat
[1839.20 - 1844.40] was it with any kind of animal fat did
[1841.44 - 1846.40] it have lard on it was it fried
[1844.40 - 1848.48] did it have any kind of other oil or fat
[1846.40 - 1850.72] in there so that's another thing too to
[1848.48 - 1852.00] keep did have milk cheese butter did it
[1850.72 - 1854.00] have cream
[1852.00 - 1856.16] did your potato have milk cheese butter
[1854.00 - 1857.04] cream or anything like that
[1856.16 - 1859.52] right
[1857.04 - 1861.60] did it have any of that going on because
[1859.52 - 1863.52] that's what makes it really hard did you
[1861.60 - 1864.40] have your potato with
[1863.52 - 1867.20] bread
[1864.40 - 1868.80] which was gluten-based bread did you
[1867.20 - 1870.80] have anything like that too what did you
[1868.80 - 1873.28] eat that day as well so what did you eat
[1870.80 - 1874.88] that day as well so all kinds of things
[1873.28 - 1877.20] matter
[1874.88 - 1879.68] ulcerative colitis
[1877.20 - 1881.68] ulcerative colitis right means you have
[1879.68 - 1885.04] problems with a lot of foods too so it's
[1881.68 - 1886.00] not just potato so if you eat potato
[1885.04 - 1887.92] and your
[1886.00 - 1890.00] belly swells
[1887.92 - 1892.56] but the belly could be swelling for the
[1890.00 - 1895.12] thing you ate that morning or the thing
[1892.56 - 1898.00] you ate the day before or two to three
[1895.12 - 1899.36] days before someone can have a piece of
[1898.00 - 1901.84] gluten bread
[1899.36 - 1903.76] a week before and get swelling a week
[1901.84 - 1905.04] later because the gluten stays in the
[1903.76 - 1907.36] system and then it feeds all the
[1905.04 - 1910.08] critters so so that's what happens milk
[1907.36 - 1910.08] cheese butter
[1910.48 - 1914.56] eggs any of that will stay in the
[1912.64 - 1917.04] intestinal tract long term
[1914.56 - 1919.04] and then will feed
[1917.04 - 1920.96] any kind of critter you got going on e
[1919.04 - 1924.88] coli salmonella
[1920.96 - 1927.04] right h pylori c diff streptococcus
[1924.88 - 1928.80] so these critters
[1927.04 - 1930.88] right they sit inside the intestinal
[1928.80 - 1932.84] tract they sit inside the colon
[1930.88 - 1935.60] and when we have ulcerative
[1932.84 - 1937.20] colitis you guys know if you know
[1935.60 - 1940.24] if you know medical medium information
[1937.20 - 1942.56] ulcerative colitis is what critter like
[1940.24 - 1945.12] what bug is the bug with ulcerative
[1942.56 - 1946.96] colitis that bug is shingles virus the
[1945.12 - 1948.72] shingles virus is inside the colon if
[1946.96 - 1950.40] you have ulcerative colitis
[1948.72 - 1952.16] it's inflaming the colon and that's why
[1950.40 - 1953.60] the blood vessels break and the bleeding
[1952.16 - 1955.68] occurs the rupturing of the blood
[1953.60 - 1957.84] vessels occur it's from the shingles
[1955.68 - 1960.08] virus right here so the shingles virus
[1957.84 - 1963.52] sits inside the colon
[1960.08 - 1966.80] okay makes a camp there for many years
[1963.52 - 1968.88] and that becomes ulcerative colitis so
[1966.80 - 1970.56] the shingles virus if you guys know
[1968.88 - 1974.64] medical medium information shingles
[1970.56 - 1977.20] virus loves what milk cheese butter
[1974.64 - 1980.24] even some soy
[1977.20 - 1982.24] likes you know soy can feed it milk
[1980.24 - 1983.92] cheese butter and gluten
[1982.24 - 1985.68] right you can learn about colitis in
[1983.92 - 1987.52] here how many of you guys have the
[1985.68 - 1989.44] cleanse to heal book here it is right
[1987.52 - 1991.36] here christine asks this how long will
[1989.44 - 1993.60] this paralysis last
[1991.36 - 1996.08] will it do away on its own yes it does
[1993.60 - 1997.76] do away on its own

[2028.80 - 2031.12] books in a while and i still want to

[2045.84 - 2049.52] christina s says how long will this
[2047.52 - 2051.20] paralysis last would go away in its own
[2049.52 - 2053.84] was the question before
[2051.20 - 2056.40] yes tense the lat tends to last
[2053.84 - 2059.12] for a couple of days
[2056.40 - 2061.36] some people it lasts for a day
[2059.12 - 2063.12] some people it's two days some people
[2061.36 - 2065.44] it's three days
[2063.12 - 2067.12] and then it starts to ease off and you
[2065.44 - 2068.96] start to recover
[2067.12 - 2070.56] you know and you and what a lot of
[2068.96 - 2072.64] people do they'll sit in the hospital if
[2070.56 - 2073.76] they have a smart doctor the doctor
[2072.64 - 2077.44] would be like well you know what we're
[2073.76 - 2079.44] not going to cut that person's colon out
[2077.44 - 2081.44] we're going to just give it time and
[2079.44 - 2084.08] then they watch the symptoms they watch
[2081.44 - 2086.88] if the if the patient is feeling better
[2084.08 - 2088.56] they watch as the patient's in less pain
[2086.88 - 2089.92] they'll take the patient off of pain
[2088.56 - 2091.36] medication
[2089.92 - 2093.28] and they'll say well how are you feeling
[2091.36 - 2094.96] today i know one person specifically
[2093.28 - 2096.40] said you know what i'm out of here i was
[2094.96 - 2098.80] in there with the pipe down into my
[2096.40 - 2100.64] stomach i was in there for a day and i
[2098.80 - 2102.56] started feeling better and i wanted out
[2100.64 - 2104.08] and they just ripped the pipe out
[2102.56 - 2105.52] and they took the wipe out and they said
[2104.08 - 2107.36] i need out of here
[2105.52 - 2109.92] and but yet they were getting prepped
[2107.36 - 2112.80] for surgery they were actually getting
[2109.92 - 2114.88] prepped for surgery
[2112.80 - 2118.80] which they didn't need
[2114.88 - 2120.56] so yes it tends to move on its own get
[2118.80 - 2123.76] this little critter off of here for now
[2120.56 - 2123.76] i want to chop up a pepper
[2125.60 - 2129.68] out of the garden here art says all the
[2127.76 - 2132.08] starch of the potatoes and squash in
[2129.68 - 2134.96] that dish you're cooking doesn't that
[2132.08 - 2136.64] promote feed yeast and fungal overgrowth
[2134.96 - 2140.64] well the information that you have that
[2136.64 - 2142.56] it does is misinformation so milk cheese
[2140.64 - 2145.92] butter eggs
[2142.56 - 2148.16] gluten feed all manners of bugs
[2145.92 - 2149.68] and here's the funny thing you're you're
[2148.16 - 2152.40] actually using medical medium
[2149.68 - 2154.48] information by saying that
[2152.40 - 2156.72] no one knew anything fed off of anything
[2154.48 - 2157.60] that's medical medium information
[2156.72 - 2160.32] so
[2157.60 - 2162.64] nobody thought bugs feed nobody believed
[2160.32 - 2164.80] viruses feed off of anything they still
[2162.64 - 2166.56] don't science still doesn't but that's
[2164.80 - 2169.20] medical medium information there's no
[2166.56 - 2170.16] science study that shows bugs actually
[2169.20 - 2173.28] feeding
[2170.16 - 2175.52] off of a potato because there never was
[2173.28 - 2177.68] there never will be a bug can't feed off
[2175.52 - 2179.12] of a potato but a bug can feed off of
[2177.68 - 2180.56] gluten but they don't have any tests
[2179.12 - 2182.08] showing that out there studies showing
[2180.56 - 2183.44] that either because it's medical medium
[2182.08 - 2185.68] information
[2183.44 - 2187.84] so what you're saying is doesn't that
[2185.68 - 2190.32] starch feed
[2187.84 - 2192.00] any kind of bugs like yeast and fungus
[2190.32 - 2194.08] and stuff and other things and what
[2192.00 - 2195.44] you're saying is i'm going to tell you
[2194.08 - 2197.52] medical medium
[2195.44 - 2199.84] i'm going to ask you a question you know
[2197.52 - 2201.60] that is your information medical medium
[2199.84 - 2202.80] because nobody knew anything fed on
[2201.60 - 2204.64] anything
[2202.80 - 2206.00] so you heard it from somewhere else that
[2204.64 - 2208.48] started from somewhere else i heard from
[2206.00 - 2210.16] somewhere else and they twisted it up
[2208.48 - 2211.60] and now they now they're saying that
[2210.16 - 2213.44] that will feed on this one it doesn't
[2211.60 - 2215.68] feed on this
[2213.44 - 2218.48] the whole concept
[2215.68 - 2222.00] of critters feeding
[2218.48 - 2224.72] on a food or eating is medical medium
[2222.00 - 2224.72] information
[2226.64 - 2231.52] but i appreciate the question it's fun
[2229.04 - 2232.88] to watch your own information
[2231.52 - 2235.76] come back to you
[2232.88 - 2237.04] it comes back to you
[2235.76 - 2240.00] skewed
[2237.04 - 2242.16] twisted up but it still comes back right
[2240.00 - 2243.60] it still comes back to me which is fun
[2242.16 - 2245.68] to see it come back
[2243.60 - 2247.84] but it's sad at the same time because
[2245.68 - 2249.36] you see that information come back
[2247.84 - 2251.76] twist it up
[2249.36 - 2253.04] it's like twisted up and used against
[2251.76 - 2255.52] the very
[2253.04 - 2257.12] foods you're making right so here i am
[2255.52 - 2259.04] the guy that put the information out
[2257.12 - 2261.12] there about how all these bugs feed on
[2259.04 - 2262.64] stuff feed on food and they actually eat
[2261.12 - 2264.96] right so that's medical beam information
[2262.64 - 2267.84] i go into great depths about that in the
[2264.96 - 2267.84] brain saver books
[2268.48 - 2273.60] and here i am right
[2270.40 - 2276.64] being told by someone how
[2273.60 - 2278.32] isn't that going to feed bugs
[2276.64 - 2279.84] yeah being the person that put the
[2278.32 - 2281.68] information out there to begin with i'm
[2279.84 - 2283.44] not going to be serving you guys a meal
[2281.68 - 2285.04] that will feed the bugs
[2283.44 - 2288.08] michelle elle said this information
[2285.04 - 2288.88] saved so many lives aw thank you
[2288.08 - 2290.72] but
[2288.88 - 2292.72] but anyway i'm happy you're asking that
[2290.72 - 2295.36] question by the way does it feed
[2292.72 - 2297.44] anything so let's talk about that
[2295.36 - 2299.12] if you eat gluten gluten will feed those
[2297.44 - 2300.32] bugs nobody knew that you guys have to
[2299.12 - 2302.80] remember
[2300.32 - 2304.72] all the eat better authors or eat better
[2302.80 - 2305.44] books and eat better doctors and all
[2304.72 - 2308.72] that
[2305.44 - 2311.12] all they knew was to eat better and they
[2308.72 - 2312.48] they only believed that processed food
[2311.12 - 2314.32] would give you heart disease
[2312.48 - 2316.48] cardiovascular problems that's that's
[2314.32 - 2318.40] all that they had right
[2316.48 - 2320.48] medical medium information
[2318.40 - 2324.24] brought the truth out that gluten
[2320.48 - 2327.52] actually feeds bugs it'll feed viruses
[2324.24 - 2329.44] and pathogens and bacteria
[2327.52 - 2331.28] and same thing with virus you know same
[2329.44 - 2332.08] thing like
[2331.28 - 2333.84] so
[2332.08 - 2335.44] and medical medium information goes back
[2333.84 - 2337.44] decades
[2335.44 - 2340.24] goes back decades
[2337.44 - 2342.40] nobody knew gluten fed anything only
[2340.24 - 2343.44] medical medium information talked about
[2342.40 - 2344.40] that
[2343.44 - 2346.16] and
[2344.40 - 2348.40] so with that
[2346.16 - 2350.32] it's like what does what does these
[2348.40 - 2352.88] bacteria and microbes that are not
[2350.32 - 2354.64] beneficial what do they feed off of milk
[2352.88 - 2358.00] cheese butter
[2354.64 - 2358.00] they feed off of eggs
[2359.76 - 2363.28] they feed off of corn too you got to be
[2361.60 - 2365.52] really careful now listen if you guys
[2363.28 - 2366.88] are growing some fresh organic corn out
[2365.52 - 2368.32] of your own garden or you go to a
[2366.88 - 2370.24] farmer's market and you get some fresh
[2368.32 - 2371.60] organic corn right
[2370.24 - 2372.88] somewhere
[2371.60 - 2374.48] you can have some right you can have
[2372.88 - 2375.84] some if you're not suffering with a lot
[2374.48 - 2377.36] of different conditions if you don't
[2375.84 - 2378.56] have chronic illness or something you're
[2377.36 - 2380.64] not dealing with a lot of chronic
[2378.56 - 2383.36] illness which so many people i see out
[2380.64 - 2385.36] there have you can do some fresh corn
[2383.36 - 2387.36] right out of farmer's market just
[2385.36 - 2390.24] beautiful corn that's organic and you
[2387.36 - 2392.40] want to eat it raw right off the cob or
[2390.24 - 2394.32] you want to steam it and have it that
[2392.40 - 2396.00] way that's not the end of the world but
[2394.32 - 2398.64] don't do corn products if you're
[2396.00 - 2400.56] somebody that's really has any kind of
[2398.64 - 2402.80] autoimmune condition any kind of issue
[2400.56 - 2405.44] on any level don't do any kind of like
[2402.80 - 2407.04] cornstarch and corn products and
[2405.44 - 2408.72] and you know
[2407.04 - 2410.24] all that stuff cornbread and everything
[2408.72 - 2412.56] else
[2410.24 - 2414.88] sierra vasati says is the vacuum of the
[2412.56 - 2417.60] stomach needed for the person to improve
[2414.88 - 2420.24] or can a protocol be done at home versus
[2417.60 - 2422.32] the er yes protocol can be done always
[2420.24 - 2423.76] ask your doctor so sarah make sure you
[2422.32 - 2425.76] talk to your doctor
[2423.76 - 2428.56] but yes if it was me i would try to do a
[2425.76 - 2430.80] protocol at home and i would try to
[2428.56 - 2432.56] avoid the the vacuum pipe going down
[2430.80 - 2434.08] through my stomach because into your
[2432.56 - 2436.32] stomach because i know that that
[2434.08 - 2438.72] wouldn't be what you needed
[2436.32 - 2441.04] they do that
[2438.72 - 2442.08] because they're trying to get air out
[2441.04 - 2444.96] right
[2442.08 - 2444.96] is what they're doing
[2446.48 - 2449.60] but being that it's not a true
[2447.76 - 2451.68] obstruction and just a paralysis you
[2449.60 - 2453.84] don't need the pipe but always ask your
[2451.68 - 2456.32] doctor no matter what whatever condition
[2453.84 - 2458.16] you're in right so i'm i got a pepper in
[2456.32 - 2459.44] here i'm going to put cilantro in here
[2458.16 - 2460.88] that's going to be the last thing to top
[2459.44 - 2462.56] it off and we're going to do that in a
[2460.88 - 2464.88] minute so let me just get this back on
[2462.56 - 2464.88] top

[2786.96 - 2792.32] pianist daniel fritzen says no it isn't
[2790.64 - 2795.04] medical medium information we did know

[2795.04 - 2800.64] 35 plus years of medical medium
[2797.52 - 2802.48] information and work we didn't know that
[2800.64 - 2805.36] that was lectures
[2802.48 - 2807.12] working on over 250 000 individuals
[2805.36 - 2810.40] doctors practitioners the health
[2807.12 - 2813.44] movement was this big 35 years ago
[2810.40 - 2816.72] and nobody knew anything ate anything so
[2813.44 - 2818.80] pianist not true and guess what to prove
[2816.72 - 2822.40] that medical medium information was the
[2818.80 - 2824.80] first to say gluten actually fed a bug

[2824.80 - 2829.52] anywhere anyhow that any of that eats
[2827.44 - 2831.36] anything so there's no study showing
[2829.52 - 2832.96] that then where would have where would
[2831.36 - 2834.88] have somebody where would somebody have
