[367.52 - 370.32] doctors functional medicine
[369.20 - 372.08] nutritionists
[370.32 - 374.96] that have let me down for almost 30
[372.08 - 376.40] years catherine i mean i get it
[374.96 - 378.16] i really do there's so many people that
[376.40 - 378.88] have gone through that journey and that
[378.16 - 380.88] journey
[378.88 - 382.72] you know you know what's crazy you guys
[380.88 - 384.16] that journey's starting fresh for so
[382.72 - 386.16] many people now
[384.16 - 387.60] so many people now and you know what's
[386.16 - 390.08] really sad they'll get
[387.60 - 390.64] turned off by medical medium because
[390.08 - 394.08] some
[390.64 - 396.32] some troll or some paid for organization
[394.08 - 397.44] puts a whole bunch of people on facebook
[396.32 - 398.72] and instagram and everything because
[397.44 - 401.20] that's how it works there's these
[398.72 - 403.44] there's these organizations that pay
[401.20 - 405.28] hundreds and hundreds of people to work
[403.44 - 406.72] for them and their job is to sit at home
[405.28 - 408.48] by the computer right
[406.72 - 410.24] and they and they have and they'll have
[408.48 - 412.16] medical medium on their list
[410.24 - 413.84] and then these paid for people working
[412.16 - 415.44] for these organizations
[413.84 - 417.60] what it is is they sit there and they
[415.44 - 418.24] try to find everything anything medical
[417.60 - 419.92] medium
[418.24 - 422.08] and they go and they try to discourage
[419.92 - 425.12] people and they they make up stuff
[422.08 - 426.80] they say stuff it's actually evil right
[425.12 - 428.16] it's amazing and so someone's going to
[426.80 - 430.08] get thwarted
[428.16 - 431.76] and then they're going to have to go on
[430.08 - 433.12] that 30 catherine they're going to have
[431.76 - 434.16] to go on that 30-year journey because
[433.12 - 435.52] they got thwarted
[434.16 - 437.20] and they're going to be now they got
[435.52 - 438.72] derailed so now they're going to go on
[437.20 - 441.28] that 30-year journey
[438.72 - 441.76] where celery juice nope it's bad for you
[441.28 - 445.52] um
[441.76 - 447.60] medical medium no he talks to ghosts um
[445.52 - 448.88] you know and now i'm now they start
[447.60 - 450.88] their journey there's so many people
[448.88 - 452.80] that are starting their journey fresh
[450.88 - 454.80] from the start and they're going to see
[452.80 - 456.40] their next 30 years so they're 20 years
[454.80 - 459.12] old or they're 25 years old they're
[456.40 - 461.12] 30 years old and they get told that
[459.12 - 463.60] science has all the answers
[461.12 - 465.68] it's science science has all the answers
[463.60 - 467.20] and so they're just never going to break
[465.68 - 468.48] from that and then they're just going to
[467.20 - 469.84] be going on their journey but you know
[468.48 - 472.48] what's funny
[469.84 - 474.08] so many areas of medicine use medical
[472.48 - 475.52] medium information that were originally
[474.08 - 477.92] published from mm right
[475.52 - 479.84] they use the info so tidbits are getting
[477.92 - 481.68] into their protocols out there
[479.84 - 482.88] and that's what's helping people who are
[481.68 - 484.24] on that 30-year journey
[482.88 - 486.48] they start to get a little bit better
[484.24 - 488.24] because they're during a couple of the
[486.48 - 489.76] you know protocols are incorporating in
[488.24 - 492.24] like cats claw right
[489.76 - 494.56] like the whole cat's claw thing it's
[492.24 - 495.28] like no one touched cat's claw i mean

[496.80 - 499.76] find it no one even touched the cat's
[498.88 - 501.04] claw right

[505.04 - 508.72] that's going to be helpful for people

[512.16 - 514.32] fibromyalgia whatever it is that's going
[513.76 - 516.48] on
[514.32 - 519.04] it's like the cat's lyme disease the
[516.48 - 520.96] cat's claw for the lyme disease now
[519.04 - 522.56] in the field of medicine they're using
[520.96 - 524.24] cat's claw for lyme disease they're
[522.56 - 524.88] still using antibiotics and other things
[524.24 - 527.60] but they're like

[933.28 - 938.40] carrots a lot right
[934.88 - 941.76] the carrot juice thing was never a great
[938.40 - 943.92] idea okay it was never a great idea it's
[941.76 - 946.08] first of all carrots are not man-made
[943.92 - 947.52] carrots are not man-made man-made like
[946.08 - 949.76] people think right they're not
[947.52 - 951.04] unless you know you gotta understand the
[949.76 - 954.16] difference between
[951.04 - 955.64] gmo right and non-gmo you got to
[954.16 - 957.68] understand the difference between
[955.64 - 961.92] hybridization
[957.68 - 967.20] okay and hybridization is a process that
[961.92 - 967.20] we've been using we've been using um
[967.44 - 971.60] you know the the whole thing is like
[969.20 - 973.68] this it's it's
[971.60 - 975.20] it depends on what you okay here's the
[973.68 - 978.88] other thing all of our food
[975.20 - 981.60] has been worked on in the sense
[978.88 - 983.36] where we have crafted it along the
[981.60 - 984.56] thousands and thousands of years you
[983.36 - 987.68] always got to remember this
[984.56 - 988.72] right you can't here's how food worked
[987.68 - 992.08] originally
[988.72 - 996.00] there's only so many there's there's
[992.08 - 999.44] only so many foods you can consume
[996.00 - 1001.84] from the wild that you can eat enough of
[999.44 - 1003.28] keep this in mind all right because i'm
[1001.84 - 1004.96] going to give you like a little bit more
[1003.28 - 1006.56] info than just hey or carrots good or
[1004.96 - 1008.64] bad are they man-made or not we got to
[1006.56 - 1011.20] go we got to do better than that
[1008.64 - 1012.88] and it comes down to this like wild food
[1011.20 - 1016.48] is intense
[1012.88 - 1017.44] really really intense and what we've had
[1016.48 - 1020.80] to do
[1017.44 - 1025.20] what mankind has had to do over these
[1020.80 - 1027.84] thousands of years is we had to
[1025.20 - 1028.64] we had to work our food that means when
[1027.84 - 1033.44] you when an
[1028.64 - 1036.16] apple tree grows right from a seed
[1033.44 - 1037.28] okay right and those apples come out on
[1036.16 - 1040.32] that tree
[1037.28 - 1042.08] right those apples may not be so
[1040.32 - 1045.20] agreeable
[1042.08 - 1046.96] so you take the apple and then
[1045.20 - 1048.72] you bite into it and you're like ah
[1046.96 - 1051.20] that's a sour apple
[1048.72 - 1052.00] that's a sour apple this is seven
[1051.20 - 1054.80] thousand years ago
[1052.00 - 1056.96] that's a that's a that's a sour apple
[1054.80 - 1059.44] and then you see it's got a seed in it
[1056.96 - 1061.12] right i'm gonna take that seed out let
[1059.44 - 1062.56] me take the seed out of that apple
[1061.12 - 1064.80] and i'm gonna plant that seed in the
[1062.56 - 1067.68] ground and another tree comes up
[1064.80 - 1069.04] and you wait years later right a few
[1067.68 - 1070.88] years later some
[1069.04 - 1072.24] five years later it's all of a sudden
[1070.88 - 1073.36] you get all these flowers and now you
[1072.24 - 1076.32] got apples again
[1073.36 - 1077.60] and you're like let me try that apple
[1076.32 - 1080.56] you bite it
[1077.60 - 1082.24] oh my god that apples that apple's worse
[1080.56 - 1085.36] that apple's worse
[1082.24 - 1087.20] right let me let me open that apple up
[1085.36 - 1088.72] and then take another seed out and then
[1087.20 - 1090.16] you put the seed back in the ground and
[1088.72 - 1091.60] you grow another tree
[1090.16 - 1092.96] this is really important information
[1091.60 - 1093.52] because there's so much confusion around
[1092.96 - 1096.08] food
[1093.52 - 1097.76] okay and now you got another tree and
[1096.08 - 1098.56] then when that tree finally gives you
[1097.76 - 1100.96] flowers
[1098.56 - 1102.40] and you get an apple right you pluck
[1100.96 - 1105.36] that apple
[1102.40 - 1106.40] and now you bite it and you're like whoa
[1105.36 - 1109.44] wait a minute
[1106.40 - 1110.24] there was that one seed that was in that
[1109.44 - 1112.48] apple
[1110.24 - 1113.36] that last apple that grew this tree and
[1112.48 - 1115.28] gave me an apple
[1113.36 - 1117.28] that actually tastes pretty good but i
[1115.28 - 1120.64] don't want to lose this
[1117.28 - 1122.96] i don't want to lose this taste
[1120.64 - 1123.92] you see i don't want to lose this taste
[1122.96 - 1127.84] of this apple
[1123.92 - 1127.84] so i got two options ready
[1129.44 - 1137.84] where's lorraine tonight we got another
[1131.76 - 1137.84] disaster recovery going on here
[1138.32 - 1143.44] i think i just burnt my carrots and
[1139.92 - 1143.44] broccoli turn it
[1149.60 - 1156.00] just like in our comment um
[1152.64 - 1160.40] so now we got two we got two options
[1156.00 - 1162.48] and here they are we can now cut
[1160.40 - 1164.08] cut a branch off that apple tree you
[1162.48 - 1166.64] guys this is important
[1164.08 - 1167.44] cut we can we can yeah we can cut the
[1166.64 - 1169.44] branch off
[1167.44 - 1170.72] and then in the spring before the leaves
[1169.44 - 1174.48] come out on that
[1170.72 - 1177.60] other apple tree that wasn't great
[1174.48 - 1180.56] that tasted terrible we can now cut
[1177.60 - 1180.80] that branch we can cut a little nook in
[1180.56 - 1182.48] it
[1180.80 - 1184.48] we can take the other branch from the
[1182.48 - 1187.84] apple we like and then we can
[1184.48 - 1189.60] graft that branch on yeah put a little
[1187.84 - 1191.76] mud on it back then because 7 000 years
[1189.60 - 1193.92] ago they didn't have grafting tape
[1191.76 - 1195.20] or maybe a little piece of leather and
[1193.92 - 1198.40] and all of a sudden now
[1195.20 - 1202.08] the graft takes and now we got that
[1198.40 - 1202.64] terrible apple tree that has an arm on
[1202.08 - 1206.64] it now
[1202.64 - 1210.96] of good apples you see how it works
[1206.64 - 1214.88] okay that's not man-made
[1210.96 - 1217.92] it's all natural baby all natural
[1214.88 - 1219.60] right important to know okay
[1217.92 - 1222.16] i think this is ready i'm gonna shut
[1219.60 - 1224.64] this down a little bit
[1222.16 - 1225.44] it's getting ready right okay so keep
[1224.64 - 1227.28] that in mind
[1225.44 - 1228.80] that's one option the other option is
[1227.28 - 1232.00] the apple tastes good
[1228.80 - 1233.52] right so let's get a seed from the apple
[1232.00 - 1235.68] that tastes good
[1233.52 - 1237.52] let's save all the seeds in the apple
[1235.68 - 1239.60] that tastes good and let's plant
[1237.52 - 1241.44] those seeds all of them and then all
[1239.60 - 1243.12] these trees come up and now they throw
[1241.44 - 1244.48] apples out and then you grab the apple
[1243.12 - 1246.00] off each tree and you bite into and you
[1244.48 - 1248.00] go up don't like that one
[1246.00 - 1250.64] but it's pretty good oh bite that one
[1248.00 - 1253.60] not bad oh this one's even better
[1250.64 - 1254.24] and now that apple you hang on to those
[1253.60 - 1256.00] seeds
[1254.24 - 1257.84] and then you plant those seeds in the
[1256.00 - 1260.72] ground and as time goes on
[1257.84 - 1261.12] you get the most incredible apples and
[1260.72 - 1264.96] that
[1261.12 - 1266.72] is how we feed ourselves carrots
[1264.96 - 1268.80] they grow in the wild there's wild
[1266.72 - 1272.40] carrots in the wild
[1268.80 - 1275.52] right but they are really hard to eat
[1272.40 - 1276.08] there's wild onions in the wild there's
[1275.52 - 1279.44] wild
[1276.08 - 1281.76] chives there's wild all of it we have
[1279.44 - 1283.36] we had to over the hundreds of years and
[1281.76 - 1284.32] hundreds of years in order to consume
[1283.36 - 1287.36] enough food
[1284.32 - 1291.20] we had to pick the best that was to our
[1287.36 - 1296.48] liking in every way right
[1291.20 - 1296.48] we had to pick the best okay
[1296.96 - 1300.40] we're going to cook this a little bit
[1298.16 - 1300.40] more
[1303.04 - 1308.88] put a little bit more water in there
[1306.08 - 1309.60] okay here's how it works okay i'm
[1308.88 - 1311.68] cooking
[1309.60 - 1313.04] um i want the broccoli soft i'm steaming
[1311.68 - 1315.52] the broccoli i want it soft
[1313.04 - 1316.96] right i want the carrots to be soft i'm
[1315.52 - 1319.36] going to use the carrots in the
[1316.96 - 1320.64] sauce the cheese that's what i'm going
[1319.36 - 1321.84] to do the broccoli
[1320.64 - 1323.52] is going to go in the center of the
[1321.84 - 1325.60] potato but we haven't even hit our
[1323.52 - 1328.48] toppings yet of the night all right
[1325.60 - 1329.36] people make a mistake with vegetables
[1328.48 - 1331.28] they barely
[1329.36 - 1333.52] cook them and then because the
[1331.28 - 1336.72] vegetable's not raw anymore
[1333.52 - 1337.84] it makes it harder to digest harder to
[1336.72 - 1339.68] digest so
[1337.84 - 1341.28] what happens is if you're somebody with
[1339.68 - 1342.32] sensitive digestion and you want to
[1341.28 - 1345.28] steam broccoli you
[1342.32 - 1347.28] steam it soft so that fork goes right
[1345.28 - 1350.08] through it right
[1347.28 - 1351.84] so that fork goes right through it like
[1350.08 - 1353.36] right through it you steam it soft so
[1351.84 - 1356.24] that fork goes right through it
[1353.36 - 1357.28] if you steam it lightly and it's still
[1356.24 - 1359.60] crunchy
[1357.28 - 1360.32] now it's going to be harder to digest or
[1359.60 - 1362.88] you're going to
[1360.32 - 1366.40] feel it rub things as it's going through
[1362.88 - 1366.40] you of your sensitive digestion
[1367.84 - 1371.20] annette why do you recommend cruciferous
[1370.40 - 1373.60] vegetables
[1371.20 - 1375.36] in your thyroid book they made me feel
[1373.60 - 1376.96] worse so i stopped eating them
[1375.36 - 1380.88] i thought you're not supposed to eat
[1376.96 - 1380.88] them when you have a compromised letter
[1382.08 - 1388.96] is it dr sebby no no it's not oh sorry

[1396.64 - 1402.64] we we told everybody
[1399.92 - 1405.28] that don't eat cruciferous vegetables

[1419.44 - 1423.04] i'm the head of alternative medicine
[1421.20 - 1423.68] right here yeah head of alternative
[1423.04 - 1426.48] medicine
[1423.68 - 1428.48] we don't even know why people even have
[1426.48 - 1431.28] a thyroid problem
[1428.48 - 1432.80] yeah you know right you know that yep we
[1431.28 - 1433.68] don't know why people have a sick
[1432.80 - 1435.44] thyroid
[1433.68 - 1437.28] but we're gonna be experts on what
[1435.44 - 1440.00] they're gonna eat
[1437.28 - 1441.44] yep we're gonna be experts that's right
[1440.00 - 1443.12] we're gonna scare them away from
[1441.44 - 1446.40] cruciferous
[1443.12 - 1449.20] uh-huh what people don't know is that
[1446.40 - 1452.72] cruciferous helps their thyroid
[1449.20 - 1453.20] uh-huh yeah and i'm i'm gonna hand this
[1452.72 - 1457.52] over
[1453.20 - 1458.80] let's hand it over to aw yep hanging up
[1457.52 - 1461.20] so here's how it works with that
[1458.80 - 1462.24] gorgeogenic compounds do not interfere
[1461.20 - 1465.28] with the thyroid
[1462.24 - 1468.56] um that's a theory theory
[1465.28 - 1472.08] not proven no science behind it
[1468.56 - 1474.16] theory okay keep that in mind number one
[1472.08 - 1475.12] and that's a problem all on its own not
[1474.16 - 1478.48] to mention
[1475.12 - 1481.36] goitrogenic compounds they're in for in
[1478.48 - 1483.04] foods there's anti-gorgogenic compounds
[1481.36 - 1485.20] no one's talking about those
[1483.04 - 1487.76] that's another thing all on its own it
[1485.20 - 1489.84] would take barrels and barrels and
[1487.76 - 1493.04] barrels of broccoli
[1489.84 - 1496.00] to even consider the possibility of
[1493.04 - 1496.72] possibly interfering and even then it
[1496.00 - 1498.80] wouldn't
[1496.72 - 1500.56] because of the anti-gorgogenic compounds
[1498.80 - 1501.44] in cruciferous that's something to know
[1500.56 - 1504.64] right there
[1501.44 - 1506.08] um so i'm going to talk about also
[1504.64 - 1507.68] another thing as well
[1506.08 - 1509.28] so i'm just letting you know now if you
[1507.68 - 1512.08] don't if you don't
[1509.28 - 1514.32] feel good when you're eating broccoli or
[1512.08 - 1517.36] cauliflower or anything keep in mind
[1514.32 - 1520.00] if it's not steamed super soft it's
[1517.36 - 1521.36] going to rub your inflamed areas
[1520.00 - 1523.12] because if you're somebody already with
[1521.36 - 1525.12] all these other conditions or even even
[1523.12 - 1526.32] kind of digestion system issue or
[1525.12 - 1528.08] bloating and that
[1526.32 - 1530.24] it's it's steamed where it's lightly
[1528.08 - 1532.40] steamed and hard really hard
[1530.24 - 1534.72] it's going to be kind of still crunchy
[1532.40 - 1535.20] and rubbing on everything and what i
[1534.72 - 1537.52] like
[1535.20 - 1538.80] for people who have sensitive systems is
[1537.52 - 1540.96] to
[1538.80 - 1542.00] have it you know have it soft right so
[1540.96 - 1544.24] it's not rubbing so
[1542.00 - 1545.68] it's not rubbing so keep that in mind
[1544.24 - 1547.52] right so you guys um
[1545.68 - 1550.00] but here's that's one thing right there
[1547.52 - 1550.56] but there is there's a farce out there
[1550.00 - 1552.72] about
[1550.56 - 1554.24] uh about cruciferous they're gonna tell
[1552.72 - 1555.04] you you can't do cruciferous because of
[1554.24 - 1557.44] your thyroid
[1555.04 - 1559.28] right stay away from kale collard greens
[1557.44 - 1561.36] broccoli cauliflower
[1559.28 - 1562.40] um you know and whatever else is in you
[1561.36 - 1565.04] know cabbage
[1562.40 - 1565.60] right so stay away from the cruciferous
[1565.04 - 1566.96] family
[1565.60 - 1569.68] that's what you're going to be told it's
[1566.96 - 1571.52] it's misinformation it's painful
[1569.68 - 1572.72] misinformation it's a really good
[1571.52 - 1576.40] question um
[1572.72 - 1578.96] that came up about it and yeah
[1576.40 - 1579.92] malcolm why am i craving gluten so much
[1578.96 - 1582.24] that's the only
[1579.92 - 1582.96] no food i am craving for two years now
[1582.24 - 1586.40] and really
[1582.96 - 1589.12] have to have strong will to not give in
[1586.40 - 1590.80] like this bagel that's got gluten in it
[1589.12 - 1592.96] bacon cream cheese and that bagel's got
[1590.80 - 1596.32] gluten in it right there right
[1592.96 - 1598.80] um okay so why because gluten is feeding
[1596.32 - 1599.52] a pathogen inside of you keep that in
[1598.80 - 1602.24] mind
[1599.52 - 1603.60] a bug a bug that lives inside of you and
[1602.24 - 1605.84] that little buggy
[1603.60 - 1607.52] loves gluten so let's do them little
[1605.84 - 1612.48] demo here
[1607.52 - 1614.64] demo depends on what bug i want to pick
[1612.48 - 1615.52] we got the bacteria streptococcus eats
[1614.64 - 1617.84] gluten
[1615.52 - 1619.36] that right there can do it epstein-barr
[1617.84 - 1622.80] sedimental virus
[1619.36 - 1626.64] shingles they all eat gluten c diff
[1622.80 - 1629.44] c diff eats gluten staph
[1626.64 - 1630.24] eats gluten what else eats gluten um e
[1629.44 - 1633.20] coli
[1630.24 - 1634.88] loves gluten so everybody's got a
[1633.20 - 1636.72] different range of bugs right they might
[1634.88 - 1638.40] have different ranges of bacteria they
[1636.72 - 1639.76] might have different kinds of bacteria
[1638.40 - 1642.00] some people have more seed f
[1639.76 - 1643.76] c diff then they do streptococcus some
[1642.00 - 1645.20] people have more streptococcus than they
[1643.76 - 1647.68] do e coli right
[1645.20 - 1649.04] but that bacteria learns to feed off of
[1647.68 - 1652.20] that gluten right
[1649.04 - 1655.20] so that's what the bacteria does i got a
[1652.20 - 1656.88] non-gluten-free cookie in my hand right
[1655.20 - 1658.88] i get a bagel and cream cheese but i got
[1656.88 - 1660.48] a piece of bread right so what happens
[1658.88 - 1663.60] is that bacteria
[1660.48 - 1666.88] loves that gluten so that bacteria
[1663.60 - 1669.44] is thinking for you it can think
[1666.88 - 1670.56] for you a little bit okay when it gets
[1669.44 - 1673.52] hungry
[1670.56 - 1674.40] it gets really hungry it's going to go
[1673.52 - 1677.20] through withdrawal
[1674.40 - 1678.24] when with when a pocket of bacteria goes
[1677.20 - 1679.68] through withdrawal
[1678.24 - 1682.00] that's originally medical medium
[1679.68 - 1683.44] information going back decades when it
[1682.00 - 1684.72] goes through withdrawal
[1683.44 - 1686.80] that's going to be a little bit of a
[1684.72 - 1688.96] persuasion that's going to occur
[1686.80 - 1690.48] a persuasion and because i'll tell you
[1688.96 - 1693.76] why
[1690.48 - 1696.96] some of these bacterias
[1693.76 - 1700.00] come from places in our life
[1696.96 - 1703.44] where there was an emotional connection
[1700.00 - 1706.32] okay a relationship
[1703.44 - 1707.52] right picking up the streptococcus from
[1706.32 - 1711.44] somebody else
[1707.52 - 1714.32] in a relationship right
[1711.44 - 1714.32] this is now done
[1715.92 - 1723.12] that alone can actually bring an
[1719.20 - 1723.12] emotional component to it
[1726.08 - 1729.76] that's just one thing we'll go into
[1727.92 - 1730.56] other reasons too why it happens with
[1729.76 - 1732.80] with
[1730.56 - 1735.20] also gluten emotionally you might have
[1732.80 - 1738.32] been hurt in your life betrayal
[1735.20 - 1741.84] everybody this all pertains to all of us
[1738.32 - 1742.96] betrayal trust breakage something could
[1741.84 - 1746.80] have happened
[1742.96 - 1750.40] right and guess what
[1746.80 - 1753.36] we would since childhood we would eat
[1750.40 - 1754.64] something like some pasta that had
[1753.36 - 1757.76] gluten in it
[1754.64 - 1762.72] some cheesy pasta right
[1757.76 - 1762.72] some pizza some pizza right
[1762.80 - 1769.04] pizza and we would eat something
[1767.12 - 1770.40] and we would eat something for our
[1769.04 - 1772.24] emotions
[1770.40 - 1773.60] that gluten would stay in us too it
[1772.24 - 1775.68] would sit inside our liver that's
[1773.60 - 1777.36] another thing all on its own
[1775.68 - 1778.80] these are just a couple of reasons right
[1777.36 - 1780.08] here we're talking about cravings
[1778.80 - 1782.40] that was a good question though it's
[1780.08 - 1783.68] perfect because it gives us it gives us
[1782.40 - 1786.00] stuff to talk about
[1783.68 - 1788.72] right okay you guys this is done i'm
[1786.00 - 1795.12] gonna get this on a dish for now
[1788.72 - 1796.56] let me do that

[1822.32 - 1825.84] linda what do you think about the
[1823.76 - 1827.60] doctors and scientists now saying that
[1825.84 - 1832.08] pathogens strep in ebv
[1827.60 - 1832.08] are beneficial for our health crazy talk
[1834.84 - 1837.84] crazy
[1841.92 - 1844.96] yeah i had a re incorporated research in
[1844.32 - 1849.20] science
[1844.96 - 1850.40] medical board yep the medical board
[1849.20 - 1852.96] you have the head of research and
[1850.40 - 1856.64] science and medical board right here
[1852.96 - 1858.08] we yeah let's just tell them
[1856.64 - 1860.08] let's just tell everybody that it's
[1858.08 - 1863.52] beneficial yeah
[1860.08 - 1865.52] yeah do you think yep do you think
[1863.52 - 1866.80] trigeminal neuralgia is beneficial for
[1865.52 - 1868.48] somebody
[1866.80 - 1869.84] oh that's right we're not supposed to
[1868.48 - 1872.00] know that
[1869.84 - 1873.76] shingles causes trigeminal neuralgia
[1872.00 - 1875.76] that's medical medium information
[1873.76 - 1877.68] that doctors are using now yeah those
[1875.76 - 1878.72] dumb doctors we should tell our doctors
[1877.68 - 1880.96] all our doctors
[1878.72 - 1882.48] or our board board certified doctors not
[1880.96 - 1883.44] to use medical medium information why
[1882.48 - 1885.28] don't we try to
[1883.44 - 1886.72] yeah let's see if we can booby-trap that
[1885.28 - 1888.80] guy someday too right

[1894.64 - 1898.32] little bit
[1895.44 - 1899.44] okay yeah head of research and science
[1898.32 - 1902.40] inc
[1899.44 - 1904.32] let's see uh no medical board research
[1902.40 - 1908.00] corporation here
[1904.32 - 1910.72] yep um we need to just tell them it's
[1908.00 - 1910.72] beneficial

[2083.92 - 2086.96] do you ever notice when people actually
[2086.08 - 2089.20] follow
[2086.96 - 2090.96] doctors or other people in the industry
[2089.20 - 2092.72] that spew out that kind of
[2090.96 - 2094.24] misinformation they follow them
[2092.72 - 2096.00] do you think they lost all their common

[2137.52 - 2143.04] info on carrots educating myself
[2139.76 - 2146.08] probably not probably not
[2143.04 - 2146.48] all right um so i'm doing right here you
[2146.08 - 2150.16] guys
[2146.48 - 2153.52] first of all i'm gonna make
[2150.16 - 2155.84] some cheese sauce right
[2153.52 - 2158.24] so i'm gonna do that okay i got potatoes
[2155.84 - 2159.84] here but i gotta move the bagel
[2158.24 - 2161.44] and coffee out of the way are you guys
[2159.84 - 2164.48] okay if i do that for now i gotta move
[2161.44 - 2164.48] the bagel and coffee out of the way
[2165.20 - 2170.64] if you don't mind okay and um
[2168.88 - 2172.64] so what i'm gonna do is let me make the
[2170.64 - 2173.44] sauce first so i'm going to take a
[2172.64 - 2176.08] potato
[2173.44 - 2178.32] right and what i'm going to do is peel
[2176.08 - 2180.40] the potato a little bit
[2178.32 - 2182.08] yeah i'm going to take the skin off the
[2180.40 - 2183.92] potato a little bit
[2182.08 - 2185.28] all right on this one and i always keep
[2183.92 - 2186.72] the skins on but i'm going to take the
[2185.28 - 2188.80] skin off of this one right here because
[2186.72 - 2191.84] i want a certain appeal
[2188.80 - 2196.32] i want a certain color when i blend up
[2191.84 - 2196.32] this potato okay
[2197.04 - 2202.16] you guys i got some other potatoes
[2198.48 - 2202.16] cooking i gotta take a look

[2229.04 - 2231.84] talking to you guys
[2230.16 - 2233.84] and so i'm not paying attention to some
[2231.84 - 2236.48] of the other things
[2233.84 - 2238.80] good thing spirit of compassion reminds
[2236.48 - 2241.60] me at least so i don't do any
[2238.80 - 2242.00] real harm to the pan or burn something
[2241.60 - 2244.72] really
[2242.00 - 2246.56] bad so i get a little reminder okay i'm
[2244.72 - 2250.00] gonna put this in here this is the
[2246.56 - 2256.16] potato i'm gonna put in here so
[2250.00 - 2258.32] i'm making the cheese as we speak
[2256.16 - 2260.00] right and i'm going to put these carrot
[2258.32 - 2263.04] pieces in here too
[2260.00 - 2264.40] right you can do about a tablespoon of
[2263.04 - 2265.52] chopped carrot i'm going to put a little
[2264.40 - 2270.96] bit more
[2265.52 - 2272.24] because i have more here and
[2270.96 - 2274.48] so i'm going to put a little bit more in
[2272.24 - 2276.32] here to put the carrot pieces these are
[2274.48 - 2277.76] steamed soft because i'm making the
[2276.32 - 2282.80] sauce
[2277.76 - 2284.32] right that kind of blatant stupidity or
[2282.80 - 2286.56] i don't know what it is negligence or
[2284.32 - 2289.76] careless carelessness on
[2286.56 - 2290.56] um ebv being uh beneficial or in the
[2289.76 - 2293.20] virus as being
[2290.56 - 2294.64] beneficial is really really difficult
[2293.20 - 2296.16] you know for a lot i mean just when you
[2294.64 - 2298.00] think about it because then
[2296.16 - 2299.20] what's going to happen too is people are
[2298.00 - 2300.32] going to also like
[2299.20 - 2302.72] when they learn more and more about
[2300.32 - 2304.40] epstein-barr they're going to want
[2302.72 - 2306.08] epstein-barr because you'll be like well
[2304.40 - 2307.36] it's beneficial i was told it's good to
[2306.08 - 2308.96] have
[2307.36 - 2310.56] and that's going to be ridiculous so
[2308.96 - 2311.20] what i'm doing is i'm adding some spices
[2310.56 - 2313.44] right here
[2311.20 - 2314.64] a little bit of turmeric a quarter
[2313.44 - 2318.08] teaspoon of turmeric
[2314.64 - 2318.08] but put a little bit of that in right
[2318.32 - 2321.68] and i'm going to do a little bit of
[2319.60 - 2324.84] cayenne powder in here too right a
[2321.68 - 2326.24] little touch of it quarter teaspoon of
[2324.84 - 2328.00] cayenne mean
[2326.24 - 2329.12] it depends on how spicy you want it but
[2328.00 - 2331.20] that's what i'm going to say half a
[2329.12 - 2334.00] teaspoon of garlic powder
[2331.20 - 2334.00] put that in here
[2334.88 - 2338.24] that one's a little dried up on the
[2336.80 - 2341.12] bottom a little touch so i'm going to
[2338.24 - 2343.44] actually open this up
[2341.12 - 2343.44] and
[2345.12 - 2348.96] shake it up some reason that actually
[2351.52 - 2356.88] there we go get about a
[2354.64 - 2358.32] half teaspoon of garlic in there that's
[2356.88 - 2361.20] good garlic powder in there
[2358.32 - 2362.24] and then two teaspoons of onion powder
[2361.20 - 2363.68] right
[2362.24 - 2366.48] guys this is fun we're in the kitchen
[2363.68 - 2368.00] together we got a lot to talk about
[2366.48 - 2369.20] two teaspoons of onion powder so i'm
[2368.00 - 2370.32] gonna add a little bit more which we're
[2369.20 - 2374.16] gonna get up to there
[2370.32 - 2379.44] there we go okay
[2374.16 - 2379.44] and we're gonna do one teaspoon of lemon
[2379.52 - 2386.16] this is a very very juicy lemon so
[2383.84 - 2387.60] that was nice right there okay we got
[2386.16 - 2390.56] that i got to get the epstein bar
[2387.60 - 2391.68] off the off the table here for a little
[2390.56 - 2394.08] bit we're going to add a little bit of
[2391.68 - 2394.08] water
[2394.72 - 2398.56] okay a little touch of water and we're
[2397.20 - 2400.16] gonna try to blend this up
[2398.56 - 2404.56] give it a little quick blend food
[2400.16 - 2404.56] processor works too really good for this
[2407.84 - 2411.84] i'm gonna make the cheese sauce
[2414.24 - 2417.20] without cheese
[2417.68 - 2420.88] which is very important
[2421.28 - 2425.84] if you want to stay if you want to stay
[2423.52 - 2425.84] sick
[2428.16 - 2431.84] if you want to stay sick make sure you
[2429.76 - 2433.36] eat a lot of cheese
[2431.84 - 2435.04] but i don't think you guys want to stay
[2433.36 - 2436.56] sick right but you're going to crave
[2435.04 - 2437.60] cheese because we're talking about food

[2444.96 - 2448.72] starting to mix a little bit
[2446.64 - 2452.72] i don't want it too wet so i'm not
[2448.72 - 2454.72] putting i'm not putting water in here
[2452.72 - 2457.36] too much water but i might add a little
[2454.72 - 2459.28] bit more water is what it might do
[2457.36 - 2460.48] all right actually it's definitely
[2459.28 - 2464.16] cheesy
[2460.48 - 2465.36] no question there i'm gonna add a little
[2464.16 - 2469.12] touch more lemon
[2465.36 - 2471.60] juice might not have put enough of that
[2469.12 - 2471.60] in there too

[3088.64 - 3090.96] about
[3093.36 - 3096.64] it's happened a lot that's just one one
[3095.36 - 3099.76] version right there
[3096.64 - 3100.88] i mean there's hundreds right there's
[3099.76 - 3102.80] hundreds you know
[3100.88 - 3104.64] there's friends there's relationships
[3102.80 - 3105.76] there's family members there's siblings
[3104.64 - 3110.24] there's
[3105.76 - 3113.84] work relationships career relationships
[3110.24 - 3115.60] business relationships and we we get we
[3113.84 - 3118.80] get knocked around
[3115.60 - 3122.16] in this world right from childhood
[3118.80 - 3122.80] on from elementary school being wounded
[3122.16 - 3126.00] there
[3122.80 - 3126.64] and and the food it's like the food hits
[3126.00 - 3128.88] where
[3126.64 - 3130.72] this is comforting me you know this is
[3128.88 - 3132.08] comforting me this is comforting me i
[3130.72 - 3133.68] have to have this food
[3132.08 - 3136.16] and that's one reason why we get the
[3133.68 - 3138.80] cravings because then we go through life
[3136.16 - 3139.68] ashley kevin it's painful and hard
[3138.80 - 3141.36] totally
[3139.68 - 3142.96] yeah i'm i'm sorry if you've even gone
[3141.36 - 3146.24] through that right
[3142.96 - 3148.00] and so it life is hard right
[3146.24 - 3149.28] and then what happens is when we get
[3148.00 - 3151.04] that bad news
[3149.28 - 3152.96] when we get that bad news it's like i
[3151.04 - 3156.40] just checking out my text right here
[3152.96 - 3157.84] just checking them out here huh that's
[3156.40 - 3160.00] that's the most terrible thing
[3157.84 - 3162.24] somebody's ever said what is this
[3160.00 - 3164.00] and what happens is hey you're my best
[3162.24 - 3167.20] friend why would you do this
[3164.00 - 3170.80] what happens is the the adrenals kick in
[3167.20 - 3174.40] the adrenaline fight or fight i gotta
[3170.80 - 3177.60] i gotta i gotta fight i gotta fight
[3174.40 - 3177.84] or i gotta fly it's fight or flight it's
[3177.60 - 3180.24] like

[3186.48 - 3189.52] this is horrible
[3187.44 - 3191.44] i gotta fly i gotta fly and the yellow
[3189.52 - 3194.00] shirt doesn't really help the situation
[3191.44 - 3195.44] actually i'm thinking about it the whole
[3194.00 - 3196.32] yellow shirt probably doesn't help as
[3195.44 - 3199.28] i'm flying
[3196.32 - 3199.76] canary and you know what what happens is
[3199.28 - 3201.52] that
[3199.76 - 3204.16] or the toucan or something like you know
[3201.52 - 3206.88] there's what happens is that
[3204.16 - 3208.24] it's fight or flight when we go through
[3206.88 - 3210.64] something right
[3208.24 - 3211.28] and that fight or flight that adrenaline
[3210.64 - 3214.00] surging
[3211.28 - 3216.64] and that adrenaline scorches man
[3214.00 - 3219.68] scorches and in that adrenaline
[3216.64 - 3222.80] is information of that wound
[3219.68 - 3223.92] instantly instantly that adrenaline
[3222.80 - 3225.92] that's being released
[3223.92 - 3227.20] from that breakup that hardship that
[3225.92 - 3230.16] forgiveness that means
[3227.20 - 3231.52] meaning that like trust breakage no
[3230.16 - 3234.96] forgiveness in the moment
[3231.52 - 3236.96] no resolve there's
[3234.96 - 3239.12] the resolve's not even there you can't
[3236.96 - 3240.88] even get resolved right
[3239.12 - 3242.72] right that's when we're now praying to
[3240.88 - 3245.04] god we're like god
[3242.72 - 3246.32] i don't know why this happened to me but
[3245.04 - 3248.84] i need your help

[3248.84 - 3254.96] right we get that broken heart
[3251.36 - 3258.00] we get that broken heart right and
[3254.96 - 3259.76] what happens is we're hurt and
[3258.00 - 3261.36] that adrenaline is surging through us
[3259.76 - 3264.72] that adrenaline is
[3261.36 - 3268.64] is information of our hurt
[3264.72 - 3271.76] it's gathering information the adrenals
[3268.64 - 3273.76] release an adrenaline blend that's
[3271.76 - 3274.88] that has information of hardship and
[3273.76 - 3277.04] hurt in it right
[3274.88 - 3278.00] rejection julie rejection it's terrible
[3277.04 - 3281.12] rejections terrible
[3278.00 - 3285.04] elizabeth shavaria
[3281.12 - 3288.08] um good to see you here in we uh we
[3285.04 - 3289.04] we go through this and this hurt and our
[3288.08 - 3292.40] adrenaline
[3289.04 - 3295.68] is saturating every cell in our body and
[3292.40 - 3298.56] we go for a food we go for a food
[3295.68 - 3299.28] that that that well a couple of things
[3298.56 - 3301.68] that happen
[3299.28 - 3303.76] right away we can go for a food like i
[3301.68 - 3307.60] got to eat this whole pizza right now
[3303.76 - 3310.24] because i need to sop up this adrenaline
[3307.60 - 3311.12] or i when i was hurt when i was eight
[3310.24 - 3314.64] years old
[3311.12 - 3317.68] i my mom made you know pasta
[3314.64 - 3319.68] with cheese and i need to i need to go
[3317.68 - 3322.08] back to that pasta and cheese
[3319.68 - 3323.52] because i've been hurt right right you
[3322.08 - 3327.20] guys
[3323.52 - 3328.08] so true marissa and that's part of it
[3327.20 - 3329.92] right there
[3328.08 - 3331.36] that's part of it okay and then
[3329.92 - 3334.72] something else could happen
[3331.36 - 3339.60] right we stop eating we stop eating
[3334.72 - 3342.64] boom i'm so sick to my stomach
[3339.60 - 3343.36] i've been hurt so bad i can't eat for
[3342.64 - 3346.00] days
[3343.36 - 3346.40] when i even look at food i want to throw
[3346.00 - 3348.96] up
[3346.40 - 3349.76] when i even think about food my stomach
[3348.96 - 3352.72] hurts
[3349.76 - 3354.40] i'm in agony i'm in the mental agony
[3352.72 - 3356.72] emotional agony
[3354.40 - 3357.44] and i can't touch food but as that time
[3356.72 - 3359.44] goes on
[3357.44 - 3361.12] you lose all this glucose and mineral
[3359.44 - 3362.88] salts to your brain
[3361.12 - 3364.56] even if your diet was a poor diet it
[3362.88 - 3365.92] still gave you some glucose to the brain
[3364.56 - 3367.68] some mineral salts of the brain even
[3365.92 - 3369.68] know if it wasn't even the best
[3367.68 - 3370.96] but then as time goes on you start
[3369.68 - 3373.44] losing that glucose
[3370.96 - 3374.88] and then the flip side happens it flip
[3373.44 - 3376.64] it gets reversed
[3374.88 - 3377.92] boom you're now on the other end of it
[3376.64 - 3379.52] and you're eating everything
[3377.92 - 3381.20] and you're just you're you're just
[3379.52 - 3381.76] you're having your bagels and cream
[3381.20 - 3383.68] cheese
[3381.76 - 3385.20] you're having your pasta cheese you're
[3383.68 - 3386.40] having your mac and cheese you're eating
[3385.20 - 3390.96] your ice cream you're still
[3386.40 - 3394.64] sick over your hurt and hardship
[3390.96 - 3397.92] but you're still you're still
[3394.64 - 3400.56] you're still hurt but now you're eating
[3397.92 - 3402.40] right and then the emotional wave comes
[3400.56 - 3404.32] in again and now you're not eating
[3402.40 - 3406.40] because you're you're hurt and it's
[3404.32 - 3407.28] hitting you over again ptsd starts
[3406.40 - 3409.04] happening
[3407.28 - 3411.20] and it's this up and down rollercoaster
[3409.04 - 3413.52] ride for a lot of people maybe a lot of
[3411.20 - 3416.08] you guys have been through this right
[3413.52 - 3417.76] and now we're we're like back and forth
[3416.08 - 3420.40] from eating bad
[3417.76 - 3422.40] to not eating at all eating bad to not
[3420.40 - 3423.20] eating at all eating for comfort to not
[3422.40 - 3424.56] eating at all
[3423.20 - 3426.48] right this could happen when you're
[3424.56 - 3427.92] eight nine ten years old five years old
[3426.48 - 3429.04] this could happen when you're 20 years
[3427.92 - 3430.16] old this could happen when you're 30
[3429.04 - 3433.12] years old could happen now
[3430.16 - 3434.56] but the pattern set in place and that
[3433.12 - 3437.52] adrenaline
[3434.56 - 3439.04] sits inside of us from those hardships
[3437.52 - 3439.68] you have that breakup you have that
[3439.04 - 3441.76] hardship
[3439.68 - 3442.88] that adrenaline sits inside of you deep
[3441.76 - 3445.04] in your tissue
[3442.88 - 3446.80] from 10 years ago from 20 years ago from
[3445.04 - 3449.04] eight years old from 10 years old
[3446.80 - 3450.88] from when you were 10 or 8 or 12 years
[3449.04 - 3452.96] old that adrenaline from
[3450.88 - 3455.68] fight or flight when you got that
[3452.96 - 3458.16] betrayal that trust that promise broke
[3455.68 - 3459.76] whatever it was what happens is or when
[3458.16 - 3463.12] you're in your 20s whatever that
[3459.76 - 3466.40] injury was right that adrenaline sits
[3463.12 - 3468.24] in your cells of your liver it sits down
[3466.40 - 3470.64] in there in your liver that's where the
[3468.24 - 3473.60] adrenaline sits in there
[3470.64 - 3474.16] sits in the liver and it sits in cells
[3473.60 - 3476.24] in your
[3474.16 - 3477.92] pancreas your spleen especially your
[3476.24 - 3480.64] liver and
[3477.92 - 3481.44] when you start eating healthy someday
[3480.64 - 3484.40] because you're getting
[3481.44 - 3486.08] sick and now you've got to eat healthy
[3484.40 - 3488.32] someday right
[3486.08 - 3490.32] and well i'm going to try medical medium
[3488.32 - 3492.48] or i'm going to try this other diet
[3490.32 - 3494.64] and the diet takes away the bagels and
[3492.48 - 3497.04] cream cheese the diet takes away
[3494.64 - 3497.76] the pizza it takes away these things
[3497.04 - 3500.16] right
[3497.76 - 3500.88] it takes away all this stuff all of a
[3500.16 - 3502.96] sudden
[3500.88 - 3504.16] those emotions are going to come out
[3502.96 - 3506.00] because that adrenaline
[3504.16 - 3507.36] is going to start coming out of old
[3506.00 - 3509.60] adrenaline
[3507.36 - 3510.80] with information of when you were hurt
[3509.60 - 3513.12] it's going to start
[3510.80 - 3514.16] leaching out of the of the liver and
[3513.12 - 3516.00] when it does
[3514.16 - 3518.32] you're going to be like oh my god i
[3516.00 - 3518.72] think i'm really i need this food right
[3518.32 - 3521.44] now
[3518.72 - 3523.28] i need i need this bad food i need that
[3521.44 - 3524.96] that bagel i need something
[3523.28 - 3527.36] and you're gonna be like maybe that's my
[3524.96 - 3529.28] intuition maybe that's my
[3527.36 - 3530.80] maybe i'm craving it because my body
[3529.28 - 3532.40] needs it now we're going to be thrown
[3530.80 - 3535.76] and confused

[3586.00 - 3589.60] barnes nobles or amazon.com has a

[3589.60 - 3593.48] if you can't get the book then get it
[3591.36 - 3594.88] the library but this has that soul
[3593.48 - 3598.08] information
[3594.88 - 3600.96] and so does cleanse the heel too about
[3598.08 - 3602.64] cravings and everything right and all of
[3600.96 - 3604.88] it but the point i'm trying to say
[3602.64 - 3606.48] is when our soul gets fractured and
[3604.88 - 3608.96] injured right
[3606.48 - 3610.72] that's the next piece of it you know
[3608.96 - 3613.20] soul memories
[3610.72 - 3615.28] soul injury to the emotional center of
[3613.20 - 3618.32] our brain and that's what happens too
[3615.28 - 3620.00] you get hurt right
[3618.32 - 3623.60] and then the emotional center of the
[3620.00 - 3626.16] brain is gonna get calloused
[3623.60 - 3627.36] you get hurt your brain heats up
[3626.16 - 3629.52] electricity
[3627.36 - 3630.88] hot wires in the brain every time
[3629.52 - 3633.44] someone
[3630.88 - 3634.64] betrays you or something happens
[3633.44 - 3638.48] emotionally
[3634.64 - 3642.32] your brain heats up like heats up
[3638.48 - 3644.08] hot and that heat fires and fires and if
[3642.32 - 3645.60] you're not eating enough glucose and not
[3644.08 - 3648.32] enough mineral salts
[3645.60 - 3650.08] and all that that adrenaline can fight
[3648.32 - 3652.72] literally scorch the brain
[3650.08 - 3654.32] every time someone hurts you and when
[3652.72 - 3655.84] you go too long without food like all
[3654.32 - 3657.52] the intermittent fasting people do and
[3655.84 - 3658.00] then they run into a crisis emotional
[3657.52 - 3659.68] crisis
[3658.00 - 3661.92] they don't got enough glucose for for
[3659.68 - 3664.16] their brain to cool it down
[3661.92 - 3665.84] because the glucose cools the brain down
[3664.16 - 3667.60] and in the emotional center of the brain
[3665.84 - 3669.20] you can have an injury
[3667.60 - 3671.76] right there in the emotional center of
[3669.20 - 3672.08] the brain physically but your soul can
[3671.76 - 3675.36] get
[3672.08 - 3676.32] hurt too soul wounds medical medium
