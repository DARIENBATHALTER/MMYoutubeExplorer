[0.00 - 3.68] day three heavy metal detox cleanse
[1.92 - 5.60] challenge
[3.68 - 7.68] this is a special time because when you
[5.60 - 11.12] get rid of metals
[7.68 - 14.24] you become lighter i think people
[11.12 - 17.44] overall want to feel as if they're
[14.24 - 18.32] lightened up like the load is taken off
[17.44 - 20.32] them
[18.32 - 21.36] loads not on their back they don't feel
[20.32 - 24.32] a load on their
[21.36 - 26.16] chest lightening the load that's what
[24.32 - 27.68] happens when you get rid of toxic heavy
[26.16 - 30.40] metals
[27.68 - 32.16] because stress even reduces when you get
[30.40 - 34.72] rid of toxic heavy metals
[32.16 - 36.00] the more metal that leaves your brain
[34.72 - 40.56] the less stress
[36.00 - 41.92] you feel even when you're under stress
[40.56 - 43.68] even when you're under stressful
[41.92 - 47.00] situations
[43.68 - 49.04] you actually feel lighter less
[47.00 - 53.52] disgruntled
[49.04 - 57.36] less flustered less miserable
[53.52 - 59.76] less depressed less anxiety ridden
[57.36 - 63.28] when you don't have an anxiety problem
[59.76 - 66.56] anymore because you got the metals out
[63.28 - 68.96] and they're gone things lighten up
[66.56 - 71.60] you know you don't react so much you
[68.96 - 76.40] don't get triggered so easy
[71.60 - 78.24] metals are why you get triggered
[76.40 - 80.24] that's one of the big ways we get
[78.24 - 83.36] triggered it's metals
[80.24 - 85.44] it's not you it's not because you're
[83.36 - 87.84] someone that gets triggered
[85.44 - 89.52] it's not because you're a difficult
[87.84 - 92.80] person
[89.52 - 96.56] and you know and and that's it
[92.80 - 100.48] facebook's not working i hear so
[96.56 - 104.40] it's like it's it's more than that
[100.48 - 107.84] it's more than that it's not about
[104.40 - 108.24] you being somebody that is just messed
[107.84 - 111.92] up
[108.24 - 112.88] that person's messed up no no person's
[111.92 - 115.68] not messed up
[112.88 - 117.28] medals do all kinds of stuff they make
[115.68 - 119.76] it so we get triggered they make it so
[117.28 - 121.92] we get emotional
[119.76 - 123.28] metals can get us amped up metals can
[121.92 - 124.72] take us to a place where we get
[123.28 - 126.64] emotional easy
[124.72 - 128.00] we get very emotional easy and then
[126.64 - 130.80] metals can do even more
[128.00 - 132.56] than that metals can take us to a place
[130.80 - 136.48] of mania
[132.56 - 138.88] like hysteria neurosis psychosis it
[136.48 - 142.08] could take you even to that degree
[138.88 - 147.28] metals can give you an eating disorder
[142.08 - 147.28] do you know that metals cause bulimia
[147.60 - 153.92] metals cause anorexia
[151.36 - 155.04] metals cause all kinds of eating
[153.92 - 157.36] disorders
[155.04 - 158.40] metals cause all kinds of emotional
[157.36 - 162.08] disorders
[158.40 - 165.20] constant mental disorders metals
[162.08 - 166.24] really do a lot of damage and think
[165.20 - 167.84] about that
[166.24 - 169.36] think about that think about somebody
[167.84 - 170.48] with an eating disorder severe eating
[169.36 - 173.04] disorder
[170.48 - 175.20] one that's shaped their life for
[173.04 - 177.04] difficult situations with their family
[175.20 - 178.16] difficult situations with everybody that
[177.04 - 179.20] loves them different difficult
[178.16 - 182.32] situations with
[179.20 - 183.84] with it with anybody around them
[182.32 - 186.40] even like be feeling like they're
[183.84 - 187.36] tortured and torturing others that kind
[186.40 - 190.32] of feeling and
[187.36 - 193.44] and meanwhile it's metals
[190.32 - 196.56] short-circuiting the brain
[193.44 - 198.80] and sending signals down the highway
[196.56 - 200.56] the neurological highway you guys the
[198.80 - 202.64] vagus nerve
[200.56 - 204.16] sending signals to the vagus nerve
[202.64 - 207.20] metals can send
[204.16 - 210.32] signals down the vagus nerve boom and
[207.20 - 212.16] get down to the gut right here
[210.32 - 213.60] and create an eating disorder right
[212.16 - 215.84] there metals
[213.60 - 217.92] can set those signals down because
[215.84 - 220.16] there's a short circuit happening up
[217.92 - 220.16] here
[220.64 - 224.80] i'm like up to here with neuroscience
[223.60 - 227.84] talk
[224.80 - 232.24] so many geniuses
[227.84 - 236.00] so many geniuses in alternative health
[232.24 - 237.92] i'm up to here with so much of that
[236.00 - 240.24] so much i'm up to here with the whole
[237.92 - 242.64] thing about you created your problems
[240.24 - 245.28] like you created your problems
[242.64 - 247.36] you did you just couldn't master your
[245.28 - 248.88] thoughts right you couldn't mask i'm so
[247.36 - 250.48] up to here about that
[248.88 - 251.84] there's real reasons why people are
[250.48 - 253.04] struggling and are struggling with their
[251.84 - 254.24] thoughts and they're struggling with
[253.04 - 255.76] their actions and they're struggling
[254.24 - 257.76] with their pain and suffering
[255.76 - 259.60] and their emotions and their anxiety and
[257.76 - 261.12] their depression their personalization
[259.60 - 264.24] their bipolar and everything else
[261.12 - 265.20] there's real reasons medals are the big
[264.24 - 269.36] reason
[265.20 - 271.60] the big reason up to here
[269.36 - 273.12] with oh it's because you can't master
[271.60 - 274.88] your thoughts yeah we want to
[273.12 - 276.40] we definitely want to think positive and
[274.88 - 278.08] we definitely want to fight
[276.40 - 280.08] we definitely want to fight for it and
[278.08 - 281.52] we definitely want to better ourselves
[280.08 - 283.28] emotionally we definitely want to better
[281.52 - 284.72] ourselves with everything we can with
[283.28 - 287.12] our meditations and everything else
[284.72 - 290.88] absolutely we want to do those things we
[287.12 - 292.88] need to be in the positive absolutely
[290.88 - 294.24] but we can't beat the piss out of
[292.88 - 295.84] ourselves
[294.24 - 297.60] when we're struggling with anxiety and
[295.84 - 298.32] that depression and everything else and
[297.60 - 300.88] we can't
[298.32 - 302.40] believe that we manifested our problems
[300.88 - 304.48] and our emotional problems that we
[302.40 - 305.92] manifested that because it's metals that
[304.48 - 308.56] are speaking for you
[305.92 - 310.16] not you not you being a bad person not
[308.56 - 310.56] you causing the harm or causing the
[310.16 - 314.08] trouble
[310.56 - 316.32] it's metals that are speaking for you
[314.08 - 318.00] and when we get those metals out and
[316.32 - 320.80] they come out
[318.00 - 324.16] then the wires work differently the
[320.80 - 327.20] wires work like they should
[324.16 - 330.56] we come into this world as a baby
[327.20 - 330.96] saturated in metal we come into this
[330.56 - 333.36] world
[330.96 - 335.76] and then we get the medical crap going
[333.36 - 339.68] on a medical system
[335.76 - 342.24] boom as a baby saturating us with metals
[339.68 - 344.40] right off the running that's what the
[342.24 - 346.64] medical system does
[344.40 - 348.56] that's right it hits you with metals
[346.64 - 349.92] right off the running
[348.56 - 351.44] and then you're doing the medications
[349.92 - 352.48] hit you with more metals right off the
[351.44 - 354.48] run
[352.48 - 356.88] more medical more medical stuff hits you
[354.48 - 359.04] with metals right off the running
[356.88 - 360.64] yeah then you're a child there's a whole
[359.04 - 362.32] bunch more metals
[360.64 - 364.16] a whole bunch more metals and now you
[362.32 - 365.04] got the adhd and you've got all these
[364.16 - 366.88] other things and
[365.04 - 369.04] and then the pesticides and and the
[366.88 - 371.44] perfumes and clones and
[369.04 - 372.80] and the carpet cleaning all the carpet
[371.44 - 375.28] cleaning chemicals
[372.80 - 377.60] the air fresheners more metals metals
[375.28 - 380.48] metals the fabric softeners
[377.60 - 382.64] right fabric softeners all the
[380.48 - 384.00] fragrances and all the cleaning products
[382.64 - 386.16] and household products
[384.00 - 388.24] all the fragrances and then all the
[386.16 - 389.84] fluoride treatments as your child is how
[388.24 - 391.84] do you stand a chance
[389.84 - 393.36] you're just saturated with metal and
[391.84 - 394.40] more medical treatments and then boom
[393.36 - 397.28] and then more of this
[394.40 - 398.48] and then more of that metals metals
[397.28 - 400.40] metals
[398.48 - 402.32] and then all of a sudden a flip just
[400.40 - 403.76] switches boom and you've got that eating
[402.32 - 404.40] disorder all of a sudden a flip just
[403.76 - 405.92] switches
[404.40 - 408.24] boom you're triggered you get triggered
[405.92 - 410.64] easy trigger real easy
[408.24 - 412.00] and it's not your fault it's not your
[410.64 - 414.48] fault
[412.00 - 416.16] alexander says after one and a half
[414.48 - 417.20] years following medical medium protocols
[416.16 - 419.20] i feel again
[417.20 - 421.20] what it's like to have clear thoughts in
[419.20 - 424.32] mind amazing
[421.20 - 427.04] amazing amazing
[424.32 - 427.44] metal short circuit our brains that's
[427.04 - 430.24] what
[427.44 - 431.92] metals do short circular brain so we get
[430.24 - 434.56] triggered real easy
[431.92 - 437.20] real easy and when we're young we get
[434.56 - 439.84] triggered real easy
[437.20 - 441.52] now we're crying in the corner when
[439.84 - 443.76] we're kind of not supposed to or we're
[441.52 - 445.60] in the store we get a blood sugar crash
[443.76 - 446.96] and we're in the store as a child and we
[445.60 - 450.16] get a blood sugar crash now we're
[446.96 - 453.04] screaming and crying in the aisle
[450.16 - 455.04] because metals what they do is they make
[453.04 - 456.32] it so that when you get that blood sugar
[455.04 - 458.24] crash
[456.32 - 460.16] they get they make it so you can trigger
[458.24 - 462.84] it easy
[460.16 - 464.00] trigger it easy and then the focus and
[462.84 - 465.52] concentration
[464.00 - 468.96] focus and concentration that all the
[465.52 - 471.28] children are going through that's metals
[468.96 - 474.72] all of that focus and concentration
[471.28 - 478.00] adults go through that's all metals too
[474.72 - 481.12] that's all metals too
[478.00 - 484.16] how it works learning disabilities
[481.12 - 488.96] medals learning disabilities
[484.16 - 488.96] medals dyslexia medals
[489.12 - 495.36] autism adhd metals
[492.32 - 497.52] metals metals metals neuroscience
[495.36 - 499.76] geniuses let's do another neuroscience
[497.52 - 502.40] genius talk
[499.76 - 504.24] guys are so far off the mark they're so
[502.40 - 506.88] far off the mark
[504.24 - 508.96] but that's how it's supposed to be it's
[506.88 - 511.92] supposed to be
[508.96 - 514.24] it's supposed to be far off the mark
[511.92 - 515.76] your professors in your universities
[514.24 - 517.84] they're not supposed to know that you
[515.76 - 519.44] guys you know that you guys went to
[517.84 - 520.96] college
[519.44 - 524.24] we went to university and went to dorm
[520.96 - 527.44] rooms that the rooms were saturated
[524.24 - 531.12] every single time you go away
[527.44 - 532.40] you go away in december they sat they
[531.12 - 534.88] spray the rooms
[532.40 - 536.16] before you go in in the fall they spray
[534.88 - 538.16] all the rooms
[536.16 - 540.32] all the rooms and they spray it with
[538.16 - 542.48] rodent killer
[540.32 - 544.72] they spray it with roach killer they
[542.48 - 547.12] spray it with insect killer
[544.72 - 548.72] a worm killer whatever they can get and
[547.12 - 550.08] they spray and they saturate the rooms
[548.72 - 552.24] and then the kids
[550.08 - 554.32] they just go to college breathe it all
[552.24 - 556.24] in and then the weight gain hits it's
[554.32 - 558.16] not just the food
[556.24 - 559.84] if the weight gain hits and everybody's
[558.16 - 561.84] battling their weight in college
[559.84 - 563.84] it's like well i must be oh honey you
[561.84 - 566.96] put on a lot of weight since the last
[563.84 - 567.76] semester over and over again all that
[566.96 - 571.04] pesticide
[567.76 - 573.04] all those metals in the system
[571.04 - 574.24] meanwhile you know what did the
[573.04 - 577.44] professors know
[574.24 - 579.84] i don't know anything about metals
[577.44 - 583.68] this is the way it works karen says what
[579.84 - 587.04] heavy metal causes dyslexia mercury
[583.68 - 589.12] mercury mercury mercury the metals are
[587.04 - 590.96] everywhere right we can't avoid them
[589.12 - 593.76] they're everywhere
[590.96 - 597.36] you know they're in the tattoo ink every
[593.76 - 598.80] single person who has a tattoo
[597.36 - 600.96] has metals leaching into their
[598.80 - 605.68] bloodstream
[600.96 - 608.56] every single vegan non-toxic so-called
[605.68 - 609.52] ink that's used now saturated metals
[608.56 - 612.88] because that's
[609.52 - 615.12] that's the pop the light hits the
[612.88 - 617.44] ink through the skin if they don't put
[615.12 - 620.32] metal in it there won't be a reflection
[617.44 - 621.68] and you won't get a pop from the ink
[620.32 - 624.16] they're loaded with metal
[621.68 - 624.72] doesn't matter how good or high gray
[624.16 - 628.40] that
[624.72 - 630.40] ink is how you know animal cruelty free
[628.40 - 633.12] that ink is is the best vegan
[630.40 - 633.68] animal cruelty free no it's loaded with
[633.12 - 635.92] metals
[633.68 - 637.36] so now we've got metals leaching in us
[635.92 - 639.36] our whole life
[637.36 - 641.68] our whole life and those metals leave
[639.36 - 643.12] the ink and they blew they leave the
[641.68 - 644.48] derma they go into the bloodstream and
[643.12 - 645.68] it's a time release
[644.48 - 649.84] release capsule capsules like taking a
[645.68 - 652.00] time release capsule of metal
[649.84 - 653.68] so we can run and we can run and we can
[652.00 - 656.72] run but we can't hide
[653.68 - 658.88] because metals are all around us so then
[656.72 - 660.24] it makes the load heavy and it starts to
[658.88 - 662.40] short-circuit the brain
[660.24 - 663.76] and then you get older and that's it why
[662.40 - 666.32] is alzheimer's on the
[663.76 - 668.08] on the high why is it going up and up
[666.32 - 670.40] and up and memory problems and
[668.08 - 671.76] dementia and not even just that focused
[670.40 - 673.28] concentration and brain fog and
[671.76 - 674.00] everything under the sun depression and
[673.28 - 675.84] anxiety
[674.00 - 677.76] it's it's going up and up and up and up
[675.84 - 680.00] in bipolar bipolar bipolar
[677.76 - 681.76] it's because the metals the metals in
[680.00 - 683.60] the brain they short get short-circuit
[681.76 - 687.12] the brain
[683.60 - 690.32] they get a short-circuited so
[687.12 - 692.40] the heavy metal detox cleanse it's like
[690.32 - 696.64] where it's really at
[692.40 - 698.88] that's where it's really at really at
[696.64 - 700.16] meanwhile all the other bs going around
[698.88 - 705.12] and all turned medicines
[700.16 - 707.04] it's a joke compared joke it's so sad
[705.12 - 708.72] danielle the only info that has helped
[707.04 - 711.20] me heal is mm
[708.72 - 712.96] i know the combo of my daily lemon water
[711.20 - 714.80] celery juice and heavy metal detox movie
[712.96 - 718.00] has been the trio
[714.80 - 718.48] the trifecta that has rescued me in my
[718.00 - 722.32] health
[718.48 - 724.56] the most thank god
[722.32 - 725.36] i'm so proud of you i am i'm proud of
[724.56 - 727.52] you
[725.36 - 728.72] i am you know what's annoying i see
[727.52 - 730.24] lately
[728.72 - 732.96] people dabbling with the medical meme
[730.24 - 734.96] information not citing it right
[732.96 - 736.88] i know i said that but then adding like
[734.96 - 740.16] the coffee enema thing
[736.88 - 742.00] right if oh man also do your coffee
[740.16 - 746.24] enemas
[742.00 - 748.56] also do do your coffee enemas do your
[746.24 - 751.60] bentonite clay
[748.56 - 751.92] do your green tea and they just screw it
[751.60 - 753.92] all
[751.92 - 755.52] up and so people get a tidbit of that
[753.92 - 757.44] medical medium but they can't really
[755.52 - 759.52] heal if they're really sick
[757.44 - 761.68] samantha says do you have any insight on
[759.52 - 763.76] fulvic minerals of course i do
[761.68 - 765.84] they're that that products useless to
[763.76 - 767.44] waste money it's throwing money away
[765.84 - 770.84] it's throwing money away i would spend
[767.44 - 773.52] my money on those wild blueberries right
[770.84 - 776.88] there right there
[773.52 - 779.52] take that money for that that
[776.88 - 780.64] that crappy product and you go and buy
[779.52 - 782.32] some wild blueberries
[780.64 - 784.24] take that money and you make sure you
[782.32 - 788.16] buy extra celery
[784.24 - 790.16] extra celery with that money each month
[788.16 - 791.44] that's what you do that's what i
[790.16 - 793.28] recommend
[791.44 - 794.72] they won't remove toxic heavy metals
[793.28 - 796.88] number one okay
[794.72 - 798.72] you can get more minerals the body will
[796.88 - 801.04] receive and enjoy
[798.72 - 801.84] through that celery right there that's
[801.04 - 803.92] that's right that
[801.84 - 805.44] vulva fulvic acids been around fulvic
[803.92 - 807.76] minerals have been around
[805.44 - 808.96] been around it's just it died it died
[807.76 - 810.16] they're just trying to amp it up now
[808.96 - 811.52] they're trying to ride the medical
[810.16 - 813.12] medium train
[811.52 - 814.96] that's what they're doing but the whole
[813.12 - 817.68] fulvic product thing just
[814.96 - 820.80] went down the hill back 15 years ago but
[817.68 - 822.72] there's a new generation of suckers
[820.80 - 824.48] that i'm just giving you like it is what
[822.72 - 825.60] do i have against fulvic if it was good
[824.48 - 828.00] i'd tell you
[825.60 - 829.52] i would i would thank you for asking no
[828.00 - 830.80] it's important question because it might
[829.52 - 833.20] have saved somebody some money in the
[830.80 - 833.20] future
[837.20 - 844.32] so yeah metals can cause schizophrenia
[840.80 - 847.12] absolutely i saw that question 100
[844.32 - 848.80] 100 so getting the metals out of
[847.12 - 849.44] critical so we're on day three the heavy
[848.80 - 851.52] metal
[849.44 - 852.72] cleanse right heavy metal detox cleanse
[851.52 - 854.80] challenge
[852.72 - 855.84] and getting battles out of your life is
[854.80 - 858.96] like
[855.84 - 859.76] that's where it's at that's where it's
[858.96 - 863.60] at
[859.76 - 864.56] but here's the problem you can't see the
[863.60 - 867.60] metals so
[864.56 - 868.24] are they really there you can't see the
[867.60 - 871.36] metals
[868.24 - 874.00] so is it really something i should do
[871.36 - 876.08] and science research doesn't know what
[874.00 - 878.64] connects to anxiety and depression and
[876.08 - 880.88] depersonalization and neuroscientists
[878.64 - 882.48] in neuro talking about neural pathways
[880.88 - 884.48] don't even know about what causes
[882.48 - 886.56] anxiety depression and depersonalization
[884.48 - 889.36] focus concentration adhd alzheimer's and
[886.56 - 892.24] they don't know so they're not saying
[889.36 - 894.48] metals is unless they got it from mm
[892.24 - 896.16] but they're not saying that also metals
[894.48 - 898.88] aren't really there so i guess i don't
[896.16 - 902.48] need to worry about them
[898.88 - 906.64] right biofeedback is where it's at
[902.48 - 909.36] oh nice try nice try watch
[906.64 - 909.76] biofeedback people pour into my office
[909.36 - 912.80] after
[909.76 - 914.00] doing biofeedback and sure
[912.80 - 916.56] you know you know what will make
[914.00 - 917.60] biofeedback work is if someone's doing
[916.56 - 919.68] their celery juice
[917.60 - 921.44] doing their heavy metal detox smoothies
[919.68 - 922.96] doing their medical meaning protocols
[921.44 - 924.40] healing themselves and then getting
[922.96 - 926.00] biofeedback and then you just say it was
[924.40 - 927.84] the biofeedback that did it
[926.00 - 929.68] because before medical medium everybody
[927.84 - 931.92] was doing medical medium biofeedback
[929.68 - 935.12] just left everybody sick
[931.92 - 937.60] it's amazing what happens if and look
[935.12 - 938.88] no disrespect to biofeedback
[937.60 - 942.16] practitioners
[938.88 - 945.44] no disrespect it's just that
[942.16 - 945.84] if you don't say it like it is you can't
[945.44 - 949.36] save
[945.84 - 950.88] somebody's life if i'm gonna be all
[949.36 - 952.56] like trying to be friends with every
[950.88 - 954.08] single person i'm gonna be friends with
[952.56 - 955.68] the biofeedback people i better be
[954.08 - 957.28] friends with the green tea people i
[955.68 - 958.96] better be friends with the coffee enema
[957.28 - 959.84] people i better be friends with the
[958.96 - 961.04] zeolite people
[959.84 - 963.20] i better be friends with the water
[961.04 - 965.84] ionizer people i just better be friends
[963.20 - 966.88] and f everybody else if anybody who's
[965.84 - 969.04] really sick
[966.88 - 971.52] like through them it doesn't matter
[969.04 - 973.60] because even though i know
[971.52 - 974.96] what we need to do to get better let me
[973.60 - 978.48] stay friends with everybody
[974.96 - 981.20] so don't step on any toes
[978.48 - 983.12] and then and then it's make or break you
[981.20 - 984.88] know what it is it's break
[983.12 - 986.72] that means somebody goes down when
[984.88 - 989.36] they're really sick
[986.72 - 990.08] really sick i've seen biofeedback take
[989.36 - 993.36] them down
[990.08 - 993.36] when they're really sick
[994.32 - 1000.00] i've seen rife machines
[997.36 - 1000.96] aggravate the heck out of someone's
[1000.00 - 1004.88] nervous system
[1000.96 - 1004.88] when they're that low and going down
[1005.44 - 1009.52] all those things are for people who
[1007.36 - 1010.40] aren't sick enough yet to know how bad
[1009.52 - 1012.56] they are
[1010.40 - 1013.76] all those things are people for you know
[1012.56 - 1015.76] fulvic acid
[1013.76 - 1017.36] fovic mineral supplements are for people
[1015.76 - 1019.04] who aren't sick enough yet
[1017.36 - 1020.96] to know what it's to to know what it's
[1019.04 - 1023.76] like to be on the edge and then you do
[1020.96 - 1025.52] one wrong move and then you're down
[1023.76 - 1027.12] one wrong move and then you're screwed
[1025.52 - 1029.04] and then you're down that's
[1027.12 - 1030.40] that's what that stuff's for coffee
[1029.04 - 1031.12] enemas are for people who don't know
[1030.40 - 1033.04] what it's like
[1031.12 - 1034.72] to be on that edge when people are
[1033.04 - 1035.36] really sick that's when you can tell the
[1034.72 - 1036.72] story
[1035.36 - 1039.44] that's when you know what works or
[1036.72 - 1040.96] doesn't work when people are on the edge
[1039.44 - 1042.96] and all of a sudden they get the coffee
[1040.96 - 1044.64] enema and boom it takes them down and
[1042.96 - 1046.96] guess what no one hears about it
[1044.64 - 1048.80] no one hears about it oh okay no one
[1046.96 - 1051.04] knows what took that person down
[1048.80 - 1053.44] that person's gone see you later just
[1051.04 - 1056.56] forget about that person
[1053.44 - 1057.68] that's how it works so it's just unless
[1056.56 - 1060.72] when you're on that
[1057.68 - 1062.56] that life or death you're really sick
[1060.72 - 1063.84] and you start doing all the wrong stuff
[1062.56 - 1066.24] oh you go down
[1063.84 - 1067.92] quick but when you're not so sick or not
[1066.24 - 1068.88] sick at all you can do give me another
[1067.92 - 1071.28] coffee enema
[1068.88 - 1072.80] and i'll even drink some coffee too give
[1071.28 - 1074.72] me another coffee enema
[1072.80 - 1078.84] and i'll drink some coffee and coffee as
[1074.72 - 1081.52] well oh give me another bad supplement
[1078.84 - 1083.28] sure and give me something else give me
[1081.52 - 1085.28] some bio feedback as well
[1083.28 - 1087.04] because i'm not sick enough yet to know
[1085.28 - 1087.68] that that's not good not going to really
[1087.04 - 1089.20] help
[1087.68 - 1092.08] but when you're sick and you're on that
[1089.20 - 1094.72] edge that's when your man or mouse
[1092.08 - 1096.24] the stuff you're using is man or mouse
[1094.72 - 1097.68] that's when the stuff you're using is
[1096.24 - 1100.32] make or break
[1097.68 - 1100.96] that's what it matters that's when oh my
[1100.32 - 1102.80] god
[1100.96 - 1104.48] when you're somebody really struggling
[1102.80 - 1106.08] you got the mecfs
[1104.48 - 1108.08] you already had too much blood taken
[1106.08 - 1109.76] from you you've been to the lyme doctor
[1108.08 - 1111.36] other doctors the other doctors and then
[1109.76 - 1112.88] you do the wrong things and you go
[1111.36 - 1114.40] downhill while your family's watching
[1112.88 - 1115.84] you go downhill and you're going down
[1114.40 - 1117.44] down down down
[1115.84 - 1119.76] and one more coffee enema and you're
[1117.44 - 1122.00] like done
[1119.76 - 1122.96] a little bentonite clay diatomaceous
[1122.00 - 1124.48] earth particles
[1122.96 - 1126.32] a little zeolite a little whatever that
[1124.48 - 1128.72] doesn't help you and you're down
[1126.32 - 1130.96] down but when you're not sick you can
[1128.72 - 1133.20] play in that game world
[1130.96 - 1134.48] you got a little acne maybe your energy
[1133.20 - 1136.00] is not that strong you're seeing
[1134.48 - 1137.68] all your functional medicine doctors
[1136.00 - 1139.68] okay i'll try coffee enema
[1137.68 - 1142.40] okay you know i'll try this okay i'll
[1139.68 - 1144.96] try that no i'm kind of okay not so bad
[1142.40 - 1146.72] i'm trying to figure it out
[1144.96 - 1148.40] if you're not if you're there you can
[1146.72 - 1149.20] play in the game of that i'll still do
[1148.40 - 1151.12] my green tea
[1149.20 - 1152.72] i'll do my kombucha tea which turns your
[1151.12 - 1155.12] blood into straight acid
[1152.72 - 1157.44] i'll do my kombucha tea i can get away
[1155.12 - 1159.44] with it i'm really not sick
[1157.44 - 1161.68] i'm really not sick but i know i'm not
[1159.44 - 1163.52] right but i'm really not sick i can do a
[1161.68 - 1165.60] little list and i can do a little that
[1163.52 - 1167.28] but man when you're sick you do that
[1165.60 - 1169.52] baking soda you dump all that
[1167.28 - 1171.68] sodium bicarbonate inside of you and you
[1169.52 - 1174.80] have some some bentonite clay
[1171.68 - 1175.28] and you dump some caffeine in you and
[1174.80 - 1178.56] you go
[1175.28 - 1182.48] down boom and you go down
[1178.56 - 1182.48] and that's the difference
[1182.64 - 1186.48] and you dump a whole bunch of oil in you
[1184.88 - 1187.84] let me do that cleanse that's a whole
[1186.48 - 1190.40] bunch of olive oil
[1187.84 - 1192.16] let me do that and then you go down let
[1190.40 - 1194.32] me do a whole sodium bicarbonate
[1192.16 - 1196.16] thing now let me try that let me try a
[1194.32 - 1198.16] bunch of neem oil and then do let me put
[1196.16 - 1202.08] a whole bunch of essential oils
[1198.16 - 1204.24] in and it actually ingests it
[1202.08 - 1205.76] let me do oh i have an essential oil
[1204.24 - 1206.88] person coming and they told me i can
[1205.76 - 1209.12] swallow this
[1206.88 - 1210.24] swallow this essential oil because it'll
[1209.12 - 1212.16] really help me
[1210.24 - 1214.16] and you're just gone because when you're
[1212.16 - 1217.84] on the edge all it takes
[1214.16 - 1220.40] is the stupid things yeah and it'll take
[1217.84 - 1223.44] you out
[1220.40 - 1225.20] what's wrong with bentonite clay tears
[1223.44 - 1227.44] the crap and destroys the crap out of
[1225.20 - 1231.92] your intestinal tract
[1227.44 - 1235.52] it does rips it to shreds and scars it
[1231.92 - 1238.64] not supposed to be consumed
[1235.52 - 1242.16] exactly and zeolites
[1238.64 - 1244.08] zeolites are bad because what's happened
[1242.16 - 1247.04] is they unearth
[1244.08 - 1248.32] the dangerous zeolites the the unedible
[1247.04 - 1250.08] ones
[1248.32 - 1253.92] and they're manufactured in the same
[1250.08 - 1256.96] facilities they've been dusted
[1253.92 - 1260.24] okay it wasn't like that years ago
[1256.96 - 1263.44] but it's like that now so
[1260.24 - 1265.84] you're not doing well all it takes is
[1263.44 - 1268.00] a bad zeolite situation you're down i
[1265.84 - 1270.24] don't care what company it is
[1268.00 - 1273.52] because they're cross-contaminated now
[1270.24 - 1273.52] they're cross-contaminated
[1273.92 - 1279.12] but who cares
[1277.28 - 1281.76] who cares if somebody goes down
[1279.12 - 1283.04] like zeolite never even removes any
[1281.76 - 1286.80] metals from the brain
[1283.04 - 1289.76] or liver anyway
[1286.80 - 1290.48] but who cares if somebody goes down see

[1404.64 - 1408.08] did it i'm sure you i bet you you forgot
[1406.56 - 1410.96] a few things that are on that list
[1408.08 - 1411.68] i bet you you forgot definitely so we're
[1410.96 - 1413.12] talking about
[1411.68 - 1414.96] the whole thing with depersonalization
[1413.12 - 1416.56] by the way guys this toxic heavy metals
[1414.96 - 1419.68] depersonalization
[1416.56 - 1423.28] the personal toxic heavy metals
[1419.68 - 1426.32] okay live in us rent free in our brain
[1423.28 - 1429.60] courtesy of the industries
[1426.32 - 1432.72] right the industries need us sheeple
[1429.60 - 1434.32] they need us dumbed down metals are
[1432.72 - 1436.08] ignored
[1434.32 - 1437.60] by all the industries especially big
[1436.08 - 1438.16] pharma because big pharma has all the
[1437.60 - 1441.28] metals
[1438.16 - 1444.00] in the pharmaceuticals it's
[1441.28 - 1444.72] a way and technique to dumb people down
[1444.00 - 1447.84] metals
[1444.72 - 1450.72] aren't in pharmaceuticals by the way to
[1447.84 - 1451.84] help us they don't have to be in a
[1450.72 - 1454.88] pharmaceutical
[1451.84 - 1458.00] they're in pharmaceuticals to hurt us
[1454.88 - 1461.04] to keep us sheeple and dumb down there's
[1458.00 - 1462.40] a bigger mission up there in the sky i'm
[1461.04 - 1463.76] not talking about the doctors not
[1462.40 - 1465.60] talking about the doctors that
[1463.76 - 1466.96] go to medical school and don't know
[1465.60 - 1468.88] what's happening and they just
[1466.96 - 1470.00] they just they're there to help you
[1468.88 - 1471.20] they're there to help you
[1470.00 - 1473.76] they're there to put your bones back
[1471.20 - 1475.28] together after bad car crash
[1473.76 - 1477.12] they're they're they're there to help
[1475.28 - 1478.80] you because we were taught to eat
[1477.12 - 1480.32] wrong and we were taught to take care of
[1478.80 - 1482.88] ourselves wrong so all of a sudden when
[1480.32 - 1483.76] an organ that can be replaced by science
[1482.88 - 1485.92] and research
[1483.76 - 1487.12] that did a great job with our surgeons
[1485.92 - 1488.96] and teaching our surgeons and our
[1487.12 - 1492.08] surgeons learning along the way right
[1488.96 - 1493.76] we can get something done we can get a
[1492.08 - 1495.36] life-saving surgical technique
[1493.76 - 1498.84] absolutely i know surgeons
[1495.36 - 1501.68] and yeah definitely
[1498.84 - 1502.16] right but they're trained in a system
[1501.68 - 1504.96] that has
[1502.16 - 1506.80] its limits so chronic illness is growing
[1504.96 - 1509.28] exponentially
[1506.80 - 1511.04] and it's a sick system and people are
[1509.28 - 1512.88] getting sicker and sicker and sicker and
[1511.04 - 1515.52] no one's trained in all that
[1512.88 - 1516.08] so really we're all stuck we're stuck
[1515.52 - 1518.64] there
[1516.08 - 1520.24] and but oh don't worry we can rely on
[1518.64 - 1522.32] all of our functional medicine doctors
[1520.24 - 1523.92] and alternative medicine or for sure
[1522.32 - 1526.40] we're gonna they're just gonna they'll
[1523.92 - 1528.24] take more blood and more blood and more
[1526.40 - 1531.60] blood and they'll bleed us to death
[1528.24 - 1534.64] so we lose our immune systems
[1531.60 - 1537.60] the system is is rigged
[1534.64 - 1537.92] doctors are trained to keep you sick too
[1537.60 - 1539.76] they
[1537.92 - 1540.96] pull all that blood out of you pull all
[1539.76 - 1543.28] that blood out of you
[1540.96 - 1544.24] and then if you get a smart doctor an
[1543.28 - 1546.08] alternative
[1544.24 - 1548.64] you know movement they'll they'll put
[1546.08 - 1550.72] you on a coffee animal routine
[1548.64 - 1552.48] which is disastrous maybe they'll
[1550.72 - 1553.52] recommend some diatomaceous earth some
[1552.48 - 1556.08] bentonite clay
[1553.52 - 1556.72] some fish oil right and some other
[1556.08 - 1560.96] things too

[1564.48 - 1567.76] for you
[1566.56 - 1569.84] and maybe they'll tell you to do some
[1567.76 - 1570.48] celery and sorry juice to be keeping you
[1569.84 - 1572.16] together
[1570.48 - 1574.00] while there's all this bad stuff you're

[1677.60 - 1682.56] state it's a cleanser it flushes the
[1681.04 - 1685.92] liver cleanses

[1685.92 - 1691.44] you can't do it hot you can't
[1689.12 - 1693.04] do this in hot water you can have herbal
[1691.44 - 1693.52] tea with lemon in it with hot water and
[1693.04 - 1694.80] honey
[1693.52 - 1697.36] at the end of the day or in the middle
[1694.80 - 1698.80] of the day or any time you want right
[1697.36 - 1700.40] but first thing in the morning you want
[1698.80 - 1703.76] to flush it with living
[1700.40 - 1705.68] living fluid that comes from here
[1703.76 - 1706.96] barbara says i am allergic to lemon and
[1705.68 - 1708.40] limes
[1706.96 - 1710.32] now this is just to say you could be
[1708.40 - 1712.16] your own detective
[1710.32 - 1713.44] okay so a friend of mine said that one
[1712.16 - 1714.72] time and
[1713.44 - 1716.72] i asked my friend i said well what
[1714.72 - 1718.88] happens when you
[1716.72 - 1720.24] have lemon somehow do you like fresh
[1718.88 - 1721.52] from a lemon like this a little water do
[1720.24 - 1724.08] you swell up
[1721.52 - 1725.20] does your throat close you can't breathe
[1724.08 - 1727.20] do you need an epipen
[1725.20 - 1728.80] do you get rushed to the hospital does
[1727.20 - 1732.00] something funny happen
[1728.80 - 1734.48] in your mouth you know what what happens
[1732.00 - 1736.72] my friend was like no no i go because
[1734.48 - 1738.64] that's an allergic reaction
[1736.72 - 1739.92] and my friend was like no no i went to a
[1738.64 - 1741.44] doctor they did food out food
[1739.92 - 1743.28] sensitivity tests it was on the list
[1741.44 - 1745.52] with 50 other things
[1743.28 - 1747.04] i said well then you're not allergic
[1745.52 - 1747.68] because those things are inaccurate and
[1747.04 - 1749.60] they don't work
[1747.68 - 1751.12] those tests don't work but if you're
[1749.60 - 1752.56] having a reaction
[1751.12 - 1754.80] then yeah you're allergic if you're
[1752.56 - 1755.28] having a reaction so i always tell
[1754.80 - 1756.56] people
[1755.28 - 1759.68] be your own detective if you're having a
[1756.56 - 1759.68] reaction you're allergic
[1760.40 - 1764.16] but i told my friend if it was because
[1762.40 - 1767.76] it was on a food sensitivity test
[1764.16 - 1770.80] you're not allergic
[1767.76 - 1772.80] lemon cleans out the bugs
[1770.80 - 1774.72] cleans out the garbage but what the good
[1772.80 - 1776.96] point the whole
[1774.72 - 1778.84] the whole thing too if you get hives
[1776.96 - 1781.04] from something you're doing that's
[1778.84 - 1782.80] healthy
[1781.04 - 1784.48] you're flushing the liver so if you're
[1782.80 - 1784.96] doing if you get a hive because you
[1784.48 - 1787.04] drink
[1784.96 - 1789.20] lemon water oh you just flush that liver
[1787.04 - 1791.04] of a lot of poison so it takes time
[1789.20 - 1792.24] you do smaller dosages of things and
[1791.04 - 1794.88] then the next thing you know you don't
[1792.24 - 1796.48] get hives anymore and you flush out all
[1794.88 - 1799.60] that poison flesh out all that stuff
[1796.48 - 1803.84] that's something to think about too
[1799.60 - 1806.88] meera says my son is allergic to cats
[1803.84 - 1809.28] and dust mites i believe it
[1806.88 - 1810.56] would i would i always recommend ask
[1809.28 - 1812.80] your doctor what's right for you but i
[1810.56 - 1813.20] always recommend when you start cleaning
[1812.80 - 1815.04] up
[1813.20 - 1817.28] get ready to get rid of the gluten get
[1815.04 - 1821.28] rid of the eggs get rid of the dairy
[1817.28 - 1823.68] when you get rid of those things right
[1821.28 - 1825.36] and you clean that out at least you
[1823.68 - 1828.08] start with that
[1825.36 - 1830.80] what happens is all of a sudden the
[1828.08 - 1833.20] animal allergies start to disappear
[1830.80 - 1834.80] and the dust mite allergies start to
[1833.20 - 1838.48] disappear
[1834.80 - 1838.48] because the overload's not there
[1838.80 - 1843.52] freely ashley says tests are bogus they
[1841.28 - 1845.36] are lies my doctor told me i was
[1843.52 - 1847.20] allergic to apples ridiculous
[1845.36 - 1848.88] that's how those tests work those tests
[1847.20 - 1850.40] are actually here here's the thing too
[1848.88 - 1850.72] freely ashley check this out one thing
[1850.40 - 1854.24] that
[1850.72 - 1856.08] to to remember is this right
[1854.24 - 1858.72] when all those food sensitivity tests
[1856.08 - 1858.72] came about
[1858.96 - 1864.08] it was done on the not knowing what
[1862.80 - 1866.40] causes chronic illness
[1864.08 - 1868.56] right not knowing what causes
[1866.40 - 1870.48] hashimoto's rna
[1868.56 - 1872.16] any kind of symptom condition migraines
[1870.48 - 1873.76] depression anxiety whatever it is that
[1872.16 - 1875.92] somebody has trigeminal neuralgia
[1873.76 - 1877.76] tingles numbness vertigo dizziness
[1875.92 - 1879.60] all kinds of stuff tremors whatever tick
[1877.76 - 1881.28] spasms right aches and pains
[1879.60 - 1883.04] fatigue problems with your feet problems
[1881.28 - 1885.76] at your back because
[1883.04 - 1887.36] all that mystery stuff is a mystery so
[1885.76 - 1888.64] all of a sudden what food sensitivity
[1887.36 - 1889.36] guys have the answer with all their food
[1888.64 - 1890.48] sensitivities
[1889.36 - 1891.84] they have the answer they don't even
[1890.48 - 1893.20] know why anybody's sick they don't know
[1891.84 - 1894.64] viruses cause all these things they
[1893.20 - 1896.64] don't know what metals are doing they
[1894.64 - 1898.16] don't even know metals what they'll hear
[1896.64 - 1899.76] about metals now from
[1898.16 - 1901.12] all the years and all the medical medium
[1899.76 - 1902.32] books have gone around teaching people
[1901.12 - 1904.56] about metals but
[1902.32 - 1906.00] but they don't really know that it was
[1904.56 - 1907.44] built on a system where we don't know
[1906.00 - 1907.76] why anybody's sick so let's just try
[1907.44 - 1910.16] this
[1907.76 - 1913.28] it's like okay that's why they'll say
[1910.16 - 1916.16] you're allergic to apples and you're not
[1913.28 - 1917.76] so lorena good to see you see you guys
[1916.16 - 1920.24] coming on
[1917.76 - 1922.72] big health with liz is here too i'm
[1920.24 - 1922.72] tick-tock
[1922.96 - 1930.48] gene my skin tests for allergies
[1926.32 - 1930.48] are accurate skin tests
[1931.92 - 1937.60] so the other thing too is skin problems
[1935.92 - 1939.20] right you know you mean skin tests when
[1937.60 - 1939.60] these tests they did the test on your
[1939.20 - 1942.40] skin
[1939.60 - 1944.64] for allergies look i can tell you this
[1942.40 - 1946.48] okay
[1944.64 - 1948.80] allergies develop because of a toxic
[1946.48 - 1952.24] stagnant sluggish liver
[1948.80 - 1954.88] stagnant sluggish liver that's toxic
[1952.24 - 1955.36] a liver filled with strep a liver filled
[1954.88 - 1957.12] with
[1955.36 - 1958.56] ebv a liver filled with all kinds of
[1957.12 - 1960.40] metals the liver filled the pesticides
[1958.56 - 1961.92] herbicides fungicides petrochemicals
[1960.40 - 1963.60] liver filled the plastics liver filled
[1961.92 - 1964.80] with all kinds of different toxic
[1963.60 - 1966.64] chemicals
[1964.80 - 1968.24] fragrances fill up in the liver lots of
[1966.64 - 1969.92] fragrances when that liver just starts
[1968.24 - 1971.44] to get overloaded overloaded man
[1969.92 - 1973.20] you'll get all kinds of allergies and
[1971.44 - 1974.64] they'll play they'll be playing allergy
[1973.20 - 1976.80] games on skin tests
[1974.64 - 1978.32] blood tests to the cows come home you'd
[1976.80 - 1979.92] be like okay wait a minute
[1978.32 - 1981.68] need my allergy shots now for this need
[1979.92 - 1983.76] my allergy shots for that
[1981.68 - 1985.12] meanwhile until that liver gets cleaned
[1983.76 - 1986.00] up and things start getting out of your
[1985.12 - 1987.60] system
[1986.00 - 1990.08] and you start getting rid of some foods
[1987.60 - 1991.84] that contribute to that whole
[1990.08 - 1993.04] whole problem like the eggs and the
[1991.84 - 1994.40] dairy products and all that and the
[1993.04 - 1995.04] gluten you start getting all those and
[1994.40 - 1998.48] you can make sure
[1995.04 - 2003.92] they're gone gone you rid them then
[1998.48 - 2005.44] you'll see the allergy problems go away
[2003.92 - 2007.52] it's why you developed them
[2005.44 - 2008.96] at some point to begin with because the
[2007.52 - 2012.48] liver just got so
[2008.96 - 2014.08] loaded up now children's livers are
[2012.48 - 2017.28] loaded up right off the running
[2014.08 - 2021.92] and metals are a big part of it bugs too
[2017.28 - 2024.00] dr fun good to see you good to see you
[2021.92 - 2025.84] so here we are we made some lemon water
[2024.00 - 2027.20] why is lemon water important hydration
[2025.84 - 2028.48] is critical we're at day three of the
[2027.20 - 2030.88] heavy metal cleanse
[2028.48 - 2032.72] heavy metal cleanse the metal detox
[2030.88 - 2034.72] cleanse challenge we're day three and
[2032.72 - 2037.76] it's important to
[2034.72 - 2040.24] to be able to flush whatever is coming
[2037.76 - 2042.48] out in the morning whenever it gets
[2040.24 - 2044.40] baggaged up by your liver throughout the
[2042.48 - 2046.72] night it's important to flush
[2044.40 - 2048.40] and get that out of our system it's
[2046.72 - 2049.68] critical to flush that and get it out of
[2048.40 - 2051.52] our system you guys
[2049.68 - 2053.20] so we're doing the lemon water to get
[2051.52 - 2054.56] that to flush out that's how important
[2053.20 - 2056.48] that is
[2054.56 - 2058.32] the lemon water is hydrating on a level
[2056.48 - 2059.60] that's different than other things this
[2058.32 - 2062.40] is really hydrating
[2059.60 - 2064.24] it's activated that's activated
[2062.40 - 2067.20] bioavailable and activated
[2064.24 - 2068.96] dino rubio good to see you you know so
[2067.20 - 2070.64] this is important the lemon water is a
[2068.96 - 2071.28] big part of how we do the cleanse so
[2070.64 - 2073.04] let's go
[2071.28 - 2075.12] 15 to 30 minutes after the lemon water
[2073.04 - 2077.36] we move on to some celery
[2075.12 - 2079.92] juice so we'll run a little celery juice
[2077.36 - 2079.92] really quick
[2080.56 - 2085.60] i didn't have mine yet today so it would
[2082.96 - 2087.60] be great to have some here
[2085.60 - 2089.84] you don't want hot water for your lemon
[2087.60 - 2092.32] like i said you'll kill the lemon
[2089.84 - 2092.88] you'll kill the lemon you kill the lemon
[2092.32 - 2094.88] and then
[2092.88 - 2096.64] you ruin what it can do for you it has
[2094.88 - 2099.20] to be alive
[2096.64 - 2100.48] it has to be a lot of you guys on the
[2099.20 - 2101.36] celery juice thing giving you
[2100.48 - 2104.64] forewarning now
[2101.36 - 2108.96] do not add anything to your celery
[2104.64 - 2110.00] juice don't add anything to your celery
[2108.96 - 2112.96] juice
[2110.00 - 2117.84] important piece of information spread a
[2112.96 - 2120.32] little celery real quick
[2117.84 - 2122.16] can you freeze the lemon juice if you
[2120.32 - 2127.36] have to
[2122.16 - 2131.12] yes if you have no other choice yes
[2127.36 - 2132.72] use it quickly don't let it defrost and
[2131.12 - 2135.84] become yucky
[2132.72 - 2135.84] and sit too long
[2136.08 - 2139.52] but if you have to the good news citrus
[2138.48 - 2142.64] has grown
[2139.52 - 2145.92] in places around the world where you get
[2142.64 - 2150.56] real bad frosts so
[2145.92 - 2153.36] lemons the lemon tree has adapted
[2150.56 - 2154.08] so that means if you freeze the lemon
[2153.36 - 2159.84] juice
[2154.08 - 2159.84] it's not totally foreign
[2163.44 - 2169.12] 16 to 32 ounces not in hot water
[2167.04 - 2170.24] it could be in warm water if you really
[2169.12 - 2174.72] want
[2170.24 - 2177.84] warm water but room temp
[2174.72 - 2178.88] it's fine could be cold water too if you
[2177.84 - 2182.80] wanted to
[2178.88 - 2183.68] it's all right if anybody just got on
[2182.80 - 2187.52] right here
[2183.68 - 2189.36] okay you guys if anybody just got on
[2187.52 - 2191.52] here
[2189.36 - 2193.28] we're we're day three of the heavy metal
[2191.52 - 2194.08] detox plunge challenge we're talking
[2193.28 - 2196.24] about
[2194.08 - 2198.24] metals causing a lot of problems with
[2196.24 - 2201.92] your brain
[2198.24 - 2204.16] with our brains everybody's brain
[2201.92 - 2205.76] metals live rent free in your in your
[2204.16 - 2210.88] brain in your head
[2205.76 - 2214.48] rent free courtesy of the industries
[2210.88 - 2217.92] they're there to keep us dumbed down
[2214.48 - 2217.92] the metals are purposely
[2218.80 - 2222.16] put inside of us we get no education
[2221.04 - 2224.80] about metals
[2222.16 - 2226.84] why do you think it took the hundred
[2224.80 - 2230.16] thousand
[2226.84 - 2233.92] 250 000 500
[2230.16 - 2236.24] 000 child and baby

[2236.24 - 2240.48] chips
[2237.12 - 2242.56] for them to recognize lead being bad
[2240.48 - 2245.36] because they don't want people knowing
[2242.56 - 2247.44] metals are really bad
[2245.36 - 2249.28] the industries don't want people to know
[2247.44 - 2250.80] that
[2249.28 - 2252.92] everybody's got mental problems they're
[2250.80 - 2255.04] getting worse and worse and worse ocd

[2258.24 - 2260.48] there
[2262.00 - 2265.49] metals are causing it alzheimer's
[2264.32 - 2266.64] dementia
[2265.49 - 2268.64] [Music]
[2266.64 - 2270.72] you wouldn't believe how many people who
[2268.64 - 2273.84] are aging are losing
[2270.72 - 2276.00] their minds you wouldn't believe
[2273.84 - 2276.88] how many people that are aging are
[2276.00 - 2278.37] losing their minds
[2276.88 - 2281.20] you wouldn't believe it
[2278.37 - 2283.76] [Music]
[2281.20 - 2285.14] so much so it's it it's just
[2283.76 - 2285.33] unbelievable
[2285.14 - 2287.60] [Music]
[2285.33 - 2289.12] [Applause]
[2287.60 - 2291.04] losing their minds because of toxic
[2289.12 - 2296.48] heavy metals
[2291.04 - 2296.48] that's why cold white spring how are you
[2296.84 - 2300.72] today
[2298.83 - 2303.20] [Music]
[2300.72 - 2303.20] so yeah
[2306.48 - 2309.60] juicing a little celery just a couple
[2308.16 - 2313.04] quick tips you guys know
[2309.60 - 2314.72] there might be somebody new here right
[2313.04 - 2316.24] don't mix celery juice with anything

[2320.08 - 2324.84] hpp yeah everybody says it's fine it's
[2322.96 - 2329.20] another
[2324.84 - 2332.40] snare it's a new technique
[2329.20 - 2335.04] to pasteurize drinks that's
[2332.40 - 2336.32] foreign to the cells of whatever plant
[2335.04 - 2339.76] food that's being
[2336.32 - 2342.88] you know consumed or juiced
[2339.76 - 2344.48] they're hp peeing celery and you buy it
[2342.88 - 2346.96] on the shelf you think it's fresh you
[2344.48 - 2349.20] think it's raw
[2346.96 - 2350.96] but there's a date on that drink you're
[2349.20 - 2352.80] drinking and the date is like
[2350.96 - 2354.80] two weeks from now and how's that
[2352.80 - 2356.56] possible if it's freshly done
[2354.80 - 2360.24] i'll tell you how it's possible it's
[2356.56 - 2362.16] been pasteurized it's called hpp
[2360.24 - 2363.60] high pressure pasteurization you don't
[2362.16 - 2364.56] want to buy celery juice that's been
[2363.60 - 2366.84] through high
[2364.56 - 2369.76] high pasteurized high pressure
[2366.84 - 2373.92] pasteurization
[2369.76 - 2376.72] celery juice is a complete electrolyte
[2373.92 - 2380.80] cools down the brain helps to cool it
[2376.72 - 2380.80] down a little bit really important thing
[2380.88 - 2387.12] your brain runs on electrolytes yes runs
[2383.92 - 2387.12] on electrolytes right
[2391.12 - 2395.68] all right we're just talking some celery
[2392.80 - 2397.52] juice fun right here
[2395.68 - 2399.44] let's do a little straining of some
[2397.52 - 2402.40] celery juice right now
[2399.44 - 2402.40] austin what's up
[2405.20 - 2409.44] we're day three the medical medium heavy
[2407.04 - 2410.96] metal detox cleanse challenge
[2409.44 - 2414.32] are you lightening the load of the
[2410.96 - 2417.20] metals inside your brain and body
[2414.32 - 2418.64] you gotta strain the celery juice it's
[2417.20 - 2421.92] an herbal
[2418.64 - 2423.68] extraction so you have to strain it
[2421.92 - 2426.32] if you're sensitive because you're so
[2423.68 - 2429.36] toxic which can happen so so toxic do
[2426.32 - 2434.16] less i always tell you guys that do less
[2429.36 - 2436.64] do less that's okay that's okay
[2434.16 - 2439.92] got a celery juice okay we did 16 to 32
[2436.64 - 2444.88] ounces of lemon water upon waking
[2439.92 - 2446.96] right now we're doing
[2444.88 - 2448.32] 15 minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes later
[2446.96 - 2449.84] you can then work on your celery juice
[2448.32 - 2451.12] and listen you can drag this out
[2449.84 - 2453.04] throughout the morning if you need to
[2451.12 - 2454.48] drag it out
[2453.04 - 2456.48] and then we wait a little while we do
[2454.48 - 2457.92] the heavy metal detox smoothie coming up
[2456.48 - 2459.52] so we'll get that done but we go
[2457.92 - 2460.56] before we do the heavy metal detox movie
[2459.52 - 2462.08] we'll talk a little bit about what's
[2460.56 - 2467.20] happening in our brains
[2462.08 - 2468.64] let's get a brain out
[2467.20 - 2472.40] the thing is with fluoride treatments
[2468.64 - 2472.40] i've talked about this before um
[2474.72 - 2478.24] uh susan elizabeth it's amazing how you
[2476.96 - 2480.88] always get 16 ounces
[2478.24 - 2483.04] no no 32 ounces
[2480.88 - 2486.48] [Laughter]
[2483.04 - 2490.00] 32 ounces not 16 ounces
[2486.48 - 2492.08] 32 ounces i mean 16 ounces is okay
[2490.00 - 2493.68] you can do 16 ounces if you'd like don't
[2492.08 - 2496.16] worry i mean you can i'm not saying you
[2493.68 - 2499.44] have to do 32 ounces right
[2496.16 - 2501.36] so this is important to know fluoride
[2499.44 - 2503.12] treatments are a direct main line to the
[2501.36 - 2504.96] brain
[2503.12 - 2506.72] that's aluminum byproducts a lot of
[2504.96 - 2508.00] people have aluminum byproduct built up
[2506.72 - 2511.04] in their brain
[2508.00 - 2513.60] a lot of it a lot of it
[2511.04 - 2514.72] so what happens is that those fluoride
[2513.60 - 2518.08] treatments
[2514.72 - 2519.92] direct to the brain direct
[2518.08 - 2521.36] if you're somebody with who's sensitive
[2519.92 - 2522.80] has a neurological condition and you're
[2521.36 - 2527.04] sensitive or so forth
[2522.80 - 2529.84] right and you get a fluoride treatment
[2527.04 - 2531.92] it can keep you in bed for weeks that's
[2529.84 - 2533.04] when you feel it when you're really on
[2531.92 - 2534.32] the edge
[2533.04 - 2535.52] so i'd say keep those fluoride
[2534.32 - 2538.32] treatments away if you had fluoride
[2535.52 - 2541.52] treatments in the past
[2538.32 - 2542.88] it's not the past it's in the present
[2541.52 - 2545.28] that fluoride's still in your brain
[2542.88 - 2547.04] stuck in the present moment right now
[2545.28 - 2548.80] so it's important how metals work they
[2547.04 - 2551.52] actually sit and then
[2548.80 - 2553.84] sit in us for years and years to come
[2551.52 - 2556.32] and here's the problem with metals
[2553.84 - 2557.68] right we end up going on our high fat
[2556.32 - 2560.32] high fat diets
[2557.68 - 2561.20] and our high fat diets oxidize the metal
[2560.32 - 2563.92] quicker
[2561.20 - 2565.28] this accelerates all of our diseases
[2563.92 - 2566.00] that have everything to do with the
[2565.28 - 2568.96] brain
[2566.00 - 2570.80] it's the high fat diet right i'm not
[2568.96 - 2573.92] sitting here scolding anybody
[2570.80 - 2574.32] about you know almonds today or walnuts
[2573.92 - 2576.48] or
[2574.32 - 2579.52] hemp seeds or sunflower seeds healthy
[2576.48 - 2581.36] fats right avocado healthy fat
[2579.52 - 2584.32] if you're gonna eat fat those are the
[2581.36 - 2586.08] fats to eat right hemp seeds and avocado
[2584.32 - 2587.76] those are the fat those are the healthy
[2586.08 - 2590.88] fats to eat
[2587.76 - 2592.40] some walnuts right sunflower seeds yeah
[2590.88 - 2594.64] sesame tahini
[2592.40 - 2597.36] right those are those are the healthy
[2594.64 - 2601.44] fats if you're going to eat fats right
[2597.36 - 2603.36] but even then though if you want to heal
[2601.44 - 2605.20] if you really want to heal and you want
[2603.36 - 2606.00] to heal quicker you've got to be careful
[2605.20 - 2607.84] on how many
[2606.00 - 2609.04] healthy fats you eat you don't want the
[2607.84 - 2610.40] bad fats ever
[2609.04 - 2612.40] but you've got to be careful on how many
[2610.40 - 2615.44] healthy fats you eat
[2612.40 - 2620.40] because the fats accelerate
[2615.44 - 2623.44] the metal fatty acid
[2620.40 - 2626.72] fats are really acidic including chicken
[2623.44 - 2629.28] turkey meat fish
[2626.72 - 2630.64] those fats are really acidic too really
[2629.28 - 2632.84] acidic
[2630.64 - 2634.08] and what it does it accelerates the
[2632.84 - 2636.40] metal
[2634.08 - 2637.36] byproduct that's produced from the metal
[2636.40 - 2639.44] oxidizing
[2637.36 - 2641.20] so all these speckles of metal from your
[2639.44 - 2642.48] fluoride treatments and the pesticides
[2641.20 - 2644.00] you breathe in and
[2642.48 - 2645.44] everything else that you've ever had
[2644.00 - 2646.08] from the chemtrails coming out of the
[2645.44 - 2648.48] sky
[2646.08 - 2649.52] to the air fresheners and perfumes
[2648.48 - 2651.60] colognes to the
[2649.52 - 2653.28] cleaning products to the medical
[2651.60 - 2655.04] treatments to everything that you've had
[2653.28 - 2655.92] in your life that built up metals to sit
[2655.04 - 2658.68] inside your brain
[2655.92 - 2659.92] to give you anxiety depression
[2658.68 - 2662.96] depersonalization
[2659.92 - 2666.24] focus and concentration issues adhd
[2662.96 - 2669.20] right autism okay memory loss dementia
[2666.24 - 2670.32] alzheimer's parkinson's wilson's disease
[2669.20 - 2672.32] right
[2670.32 - 2673.44] and even even without all that let's
[2672.32 - 2676.72] just say just
[2673.44 - 2679.68] emotionally triggered really easy right
[2676.72 - 2681.36] emotionally triggered all of that medals
[2679.68 - 2684.24] eating disorders bulimia
[2681.36 - 2685.28] anorexia other eating disorders that
[2684.24 - 2688.32] aren't as severe
[2685.28 - 2690.88] and still severe okay
[2688.32 - 2692.00] that's the metals and then all the fats
[2690.88 - 2695.20] in our diet
[2692.00 - 2699.60] what it does is it rots the metal quick
[2695.20 - 2703.28] it starts to oxidize it so it rusts
[2699.60 - 2706.00] fats rust the metals in the brain
[2703.28 - 2708.24] so your condition worsens as time goes
[2706.00 - 2711.20] on
[2708.24 - 2713.52] and then the short circuit the
[2711.20 - 2716.84] electrical panel gets short-circuited
[2713.52 - 2718.00] and that's when that electrical panel
[2716.84 - 2721.36] gets
[2718.00 - 2722.64] zonked bonked out electricity is running
[2721.36 - 2723.52] through the brain your brain's made of
[2722.64 - 2725.04] electricity
[2723.52 - 2726.40] all the thoughts and everything all that
[2725.04 - 2727.52] electricity surging through the brain
[2726.40 - 2730.00] and it's hitting all these metal
[2727.52 - 2731.84] deposits and byproduct that's oxidized
[2730.00 - 2733.60] it's hitting it and then that's what's
[2731.84 - 2736.00] happening
[2733.60 - 2737.52] some people it's so bad if they go into
[2736.00 - 2738.80] mania manic moments
[2737.52 - 2740.08] some people they're up and down they're
[2738.80 - 2741.60] all over the place some people got the
[2740.08 - 2743.20] bipolar going some people just have the
[2741.60 - 2745.44] continual brain fog going
[2743.20 - 2746.88] some people have all the the above some
[2745.44 - 2748.72] people just have a little bit of it
[2746.88 - 2750.48] some people have some adhd some people
[2748.72 - 2752.56] just have a hard time focusing
[2750.48 - 2753.92] some people have migraines from it but
[2752.56 - 2755.60] whatever it is it all
[2753.92 - 2758.72] happens it's all because those metals
[2755.60 - 2758.72] live in there rent free
[2759.60 - 2763.28] and is that electricity circulating
[2761.44 - 2764.56] electricity circulating i showed you
[2763.28 - 2766.56] guys this right
[2764.56 - 2768.72] i showed you guys this so that
[2766.56 - 2771.68] electricity is circulating right
[2768.72 - 2772.88] okay and that pencil is a neuron inside
[2771.68 - 2774.08] the brain i showed you that right
[2772.88 - 2777.20] yesterday it's a neuron
[2774.08 - 2778.96] inside the brain right and you got metal
[2777.20 - 2780.64] in the middle of that neuron so when
[2778.96 - 2781.84] that electrical impulse comes down like
[2780.64 - 2782.48] here's the electrical impulse it's
[2781.84 - 2783.76] coming down
[2782.48 - 2785.36] that's your electricity because you're
[2783.76 - 2786.80] thinking of thought you're like hey you
[2785.36 - 2788.24] know what i gotta focus on this
[2786.80 - 2790.40] paperwork right now
[2788.24 - 2792.64] i can't my brain fog so bad i can't
[2790.40 - 2794.88] focus or i'm getting really emotional i
[2792.64 - 2796.24] can't explain it like i'm so emotional
[2794.88 - 2798.24] right now i just i can't
[2796.24 - 2800.16] it's like a sadness or i'm just i want
[2798.24 - 2802.32] to scream i don't know what it is
[2800.16 - 2803.28] well that neuro that that electrical
[2802.32 - 2805.60] impulse has come down
[2803.28 - 2806.64] and it's hitting the metal if you if
[2805.60 - 2809.60] it's ocd
[2806.64 - 2811.36] it's bouncing off the metal that means
[2809.60 - 2812.80] the deposit is in a spot in the brain
[2811.36 - 2814.80] where it's a larger deposit
[2812.80 - 2816.24] and that electrical impulse is coming
[2814.80 - 2816.72] down it's hitting the metal and bouncing
[2816.24 - 2818.64] back up
[2816.72 - 2820.56] and slamming into another another
[2818.64 - 2823.60] electrical impulse
[2820.56 - 2825.92] and that's ocd but you can have a
[2823.60 - 2828.96] combination of ocd and also
[2825.92 - 2831.76] also everything else too metal all
[2828.96 - 2833.76] through the brain
[2831.76 - 2835.36] savannah says so why someone will go
[2833.76 - 2837.68] bipolar
[2835.36 - 2839.84] some other autism what else affect the
[2837.68 - 2842.40] manifestation of disorder
[2839.84 - 2843.52] so as far as manifestation goes i'm not
[2842.40 - 2845.60] sure exactly what you mean by the
[2843.52 - 2848.00] manifestation but
[2845.60 - 2849.60] but as far as like how it works for some
[2848.00 - 2851.84] people i'll give you a little bit
[2849.60 - 2853.36] of a tidbit here okay this is the
[2851.84 - 2855.20] midline canal right
[2853.36 - 2856.48] there's a little there's a little canal
[2855.20 - 2856.80] that goes in the center of the brain
[2856.48 - 2858.80] right
[2856.80 - 2861.28] left hemisphere right hemisphere that
[2858.80 - 2862.80] fills up with metal when you're a child
[2861.28 - 2864.96] so all those medical treatments when
[2862.80 - 2866.40] we're a child that children are forced
[2864.96 - 2867.44] into to go to school and stuff all the
[2866.40 - 2869.12] medical treatments
[2867.44 - 2870.80] fills up that canal with all that
[2869.12 - 2872.32] mercury
[2870.80 - 2874.32] fills up the canal with all that
[2872.32 - 2876.00] aluminum and mercury right there
[2874.32 - 2878.08] so we get right off the running when
[2876.00 - 2878.72] we're children another thing too utero
[2878.08 - 2882.16] utero
[2878.72 - 2884.84] sperm and utero when we're a baby
[2882.16 - 2886.56] we get all that mercury in us too right
[2884.84 - 2889.36] here
[2886.56 - 2890.00] right then especially when pregnant
[2889.36 - 2891.92] women are
[2890.00 - 2894.16] pushed into medical treatments while
[2891.92 - 2897.68] they're pregnant right
[2894.16 - 2899.20] and so so then the baby's
[2897.68 - 2900.96] already developing with metal in the
[2899.20 - 2902.72] brain all this determines whether it's
[2900.96 - 2904.56] going to be autism to some degree or a
[2902.72 - 2905.44] larger degree how much mercury how much
[2904.56 - 2907.68] aluminum
[2905.44 - 2908.96] what's happening there how much adhd
[2907.68 - 2909.68] what's the difference between something
[2908.96 - 2911.20] that's going to be
[2909.68 - 2912.40] mania to something that's going to be
[2911.20 - 2913.20] different that something's just going to
[2912.40 - 2914.80] be depression
[2913.20 - 2916.56] something is just going to be focused
[2914.80 - 2918.40] and concentration but we got a
[2916.56 - 2919.92] fighting spirit when we're young we got
[2918.40 - 2922.16] a fighting will because we're trying to
[2919.92 - 2924.40] thrive so what happens human nature is
[2922.16 - 2925.76] when you're a child you have this you
[2924.40 - 2928.32] have this automatic
[2925.76 - 2930.16] bodies the body is programmed to thrive
[2928.32 - 2931.20] so you can grow as fast as possible and
[2930.16 - 2933.28] as healthy as possible
[2931.20 - 2936.16] so it's overriding a lot of what the
[2933.28 - 2936.16] metal causes
[2937.12 - 2943.84] but sometimes it doesn't override it
[2940.84 - 2943.84] enough
[2943.92 - 2946.88] and this is just some of the ways we get
[2945.44 - 2947.68] heavy metals and we get them in every
[2946.88 - 2950.16] way
[2947.68 - 2951.92] i said like the carpets carpet cleaning
[2950.16 - 2953.84] services that come in
[2951.92 - 2955.36] saturate us with toxic heavy metals
[2953.84 - 2956.64] perfumes colognes every time you smell
[2955.36 - 2958.64] perfume you got metal
[2956.64 - 2960.16] inside your body that's why the heavy
[2958.64 - 2961.44] metal detox smoothie is so important
[2960.16 - 2964.64] that's why the heavy metal cleanse is so
[2961.44 - 2964.64] important once in a while to do
[2965.20 - 2970.64] because we're just surrounded by metal
[2969.04 - 2972.72] you go into a store you're breathing an
[2970.64 - 2974.56] air freshener plus cologne plus perfume
[2972.72 - 2976.40] plus scented candles
[2974.56 - 2978.40] you go down the aisle in the grocery
[2976.40 - 2979.84] store that has all the conventional
[2978.40 - 2981.84] cleaning products
[2979.84 - 2984.48] believe it or not you go down the aisle
[2981.84 - 2985.76] in the non-conventional cleaning product
[2984.48 - 2987.76] the more natural stuff
[2985.76 - 2989.44] that stuff's saturated metal too in many
[2987.76 - 2990.88] ways
[2989.44 - 2992.56] you get it in the water you get it in
[2990.88 - 2994.08] the air you get at the coffee shop you
[2992.56 - 2996.00] get it at your coffee house
[2994.08 - 2997.12] the mosquito spray coming down i talked
[2996.00 - 3000.32] about that the other day
[2997.12 - 3001.36] the mosquito spray coming down right now
[3000.32 - 3005.12] there
[3001.36 - 3006.72] there's a deal with the mosquito spray
[3005.12 - 3009.76] companies
[3006.72 - 3012.88] and the governments
[3009.76 - 3013.44] just spray everybody dump it out of the
[3012.88 - 3017.52] sky
[3013.44 - 3017.52] it's never gotten rid of one mosquito
[3020.24 - 3024.08] it never kills off the mosquitoes
[3024.24 - 3032.24] but they but so what's happening is like
[3028.88 - 3033.44] our governments pay the chemical
[3032.24 - 3036.80] companies
[3033.44 - 3036.80] to slowly exterminate us
[3037.28 - 3041.28] that's what they do and they use their
[3039.36 - 3043.76] tax money
[3041.28 - 3045.84] that's what they do so they fill up all
[3043.76 - 3047.92] their planes with mosquito spray
[3045.84 - 3049.60] from from you know courtesy of the
[3047.92 - 3052.64] chemical companies
[3049.60 - 3055.44] our tax dollars pay and they
[3052.64 - 3057.12] dump mosquito spray dangerous lethal
[3055.44 - 3058.64] mosquito spray on us they never kill off
[3057.12 - 3061.04] the mosquitoes
[3058.64 - 3063.60] mosquitoes are always there they can go
[3061.04 - 3066.32] by and dump all that spray
[3063.60 - 3068.08] to exterminate us but the mosquitoes
[3066.32 - 3072.24] will still be there flying around
[3068.08 - 3072.24] you'll still be like mosquito
[3073.04 - 3078.00] so the industries are wired into
[3076.72 - 3079.52] that right now right now they're dumping
[3078.00 - 3080.40] mosquito spray everywhere in the united
[3079.52 - 3082.96] states all over
[3080.40 - 3084.64] every single town and city they're just
[3082.96 - 3086.88] dumping it dumping it dumping it
[3084.64 - 3088.24] right now all over dumping it nobody's
[3086.88 - 3089.92] permission don't bring it on your
[3088.24 - 3090.96] children your babies dumping on
[3089.92 - 3092.72] everybody
[3090.96 - 3094.16] they won't kill a single mosquito with
[3092.72 - 3095.44] it but they're just dumping and dumping
[3094.16 - 3098.96] and dumping it
[3095.44 - 3101.92] to make money and and and
[3098.96 - 3102.80] courtesy extermination services for
[3101.92 - 3106.24] human people
[3102.80 - 3107.12] for humans i don't know about aliens
[3106.24 - 3109.12] walking around
[3107.12 - 3111.84] from other planets and other solar
[3109.12 - 3111.84] systems and galaxies
[3111.92 - 3116.48] maybe they're not affected by it if you
[3114.88 - 3118.08] believe in that or not i mean i don't
[3116.48 - 3121.52] know if you guys believe in that or not
[3118.08 - 3123.12] maybe you maybe don't it's another
[3121.52 - 3124.56] discussion someday
[3123.12 - 3126.48] i know some of you guys are like i know
[3124.56 - 3129.36] that's happening well maybe we can talk
[3126.48 - 3131.20] about it someday and we can find out
[3129.36 - 3132.88] but then the conditions and symptoms
[3131.20 - 3134.32] happen the asthma really happens the
[3132.88 - 3136.08] asthma gets really bad
[3134.32 - 3138.40] other problems or children's asthma gets
[3136.08 - 3139.60] really bad other people's conditions get
[3138.40 - 3141.20] really bad
[3139.60 - 3143.20] you can when that mosquito spray comes
[3141.20 - 3145.44] down on everybody your neurosis
[3143.20 - 3146.00] psychosis ocd can get worse and worse
[3145.44 - 3147.68] and worse
[3146.00 - 3149.52] everything can get worse and worse and
[3147.68 - 3151.60] worse they do it every year
[3149.52 - 3153.12] they dump it on everybody and that's all
[3151.60 - 3157.12] metal and metal and
[3153.12 - 3157.12] metal and neurotoxic methyl metal
[3158.56 - 3161.92] conditions and symptoms depend on where
[3160.24 - 3163.04] the metal is in the brain is the metal
[3161.92 - 3165.20] in the frontal lobe
[3163.04 - 3167.12] is the metal sitting on the optic nerve
[3165.20 - 3168.56] it's the metal in the pituitary area
[3167.12 - 3170.64] it's the metal in the hypothalamus it's
[3168.56 - 3173.60] the metal in the brain stem
[3170.64 - 3175.28] is the metal where's the metal how much
[3173.60 - 3177.12] metal and where and how much
[3175.28 - 3178.72] and what kind of metal is it mercury's
[3177.12 - 3180.40] aluminum is a little bit of arsenic
[3178.72 - 3182.00] is it a little bit of lead what kind of
[3180.40 - 3183.68] metal is going on and they mix
[3182.00 - 3185.28] and they mix and then electricity hits
[3183.68 - 3186.32] the metal left and right hits the metal
[3185.28 - 3187.76] left and right
[3186.32 - 3190.32] they just michelle l said they just
[3187.76 - 3193.92] sprayed here last week a lot of people
[3190.32 - 3195.84] 90 michelle 99 99
[3193.92 - 3197.68] of all people don't know they're even
[3195.84 - 3199.60] being sprayed on have no idea
[3197.68 - 3201.04] don't have a clue they don't even know
[3199.60 - 3202.16] what's happening they're just being
[3201.04 - 3203.12] sprayed on when they're doing their
[3202.16 - 3204.40] cookouts at night
[3203.12 - 3206.48] they're sprayed on during the fourth of
[3204.40 - 3209.84] july especially sprayed on then they're
[3206.48 - 3209.84] just sprayed spray spray spray spray
[3210.80 - 3214.32] and the symptoms get worse someone's be
[3212.32 - 3216.96] like you manifested it
[3214.32 - 3218.32] you manifested that symptom it must be
[3216.96 - 3220.84] something you're doing wrong
[3218.32 - 3224.16] because your neurologist says you're
[3220.84 - 3224.16] fine right
[3226.16 - 3229.44] so depending on where the metal is by
[3227.76 - 3231.36] the way if you guys just got on here do
[3229.44 - 3232.96] you have cleans the heel
[3231.36 - 3235.12] you guys should have it it should be in
[3232.96 - 3237.44] your own personal
[3235.12 - 3238.32] reading room in your apartment in your
[3237.44 - 3241.12] house
[3238.32 - 3242.96] it should be there it's a medical

[3288.40 - 3292.32] all right electricity runs down that
[3290.84 - 3296.08] neuron
[3292.32 - 3299.60] hits the metal deposit and now
[3296.08 - 3303.36] you're in ocd land ocd
[3299.60 - 3305.36] that ocd can get rough i read incredible
[3303.36 - 3308.24] comment on youtube

[3325.60 - 3329.04] cool stuff
[3326.96 - 3331.04] you could have mild ocd you can have
[3329.04 - 3332.32] severe ocd you could have some really
[3331.04 - 3334.88] crazy ocd
[3332.32 - 3337.12] it could be debilitating in such a way
[3334.88 - 3340.40] and god bless people for surviving it

[3410.00 - 3415.84] powerful that it just
[3413.04 - 3418.56] it'll stain anything and everything it's
[3415.84 - 3421.04] ruined a lot of my clothes
[3418.56 - 3421.84] with stains everywhere right the wild
[3421.04 - 3425.36] blueberry
[3421.84 - 3428.32] the wild blueberry is is so potent right
[3425.36 - 3430.00] it's so important it'll it'll really do
[3428.32 - 3433.84] some serious stuff you know
[3430.00 - 3433.84] it's it's crazy
[3435.04 - 3437.60] so i just put the frozen wild
[3436.24 - 3439.04] blueberries in here i'm also going to
[3437.60 - 3440.64] put the wild blueberry juice right this
[3439.04 - 3441.84] is the wyman's wild blueberry juice
[3440.64 - 3444.32] if you don't have frozen wild
[3441.84 - 3447.84] blueberries just get the juice
[3444.32 - 3447.84] do two to four ounces of the juice
[3448.00 - 3454.00] i'm loving the cleanse amazing
[3452.00 - 3456.88] the heavy metal detox smoothie gives me
[3454.00 - 3456.88] headaches why
[3457.60 - 3462.96] i would be your own detective that's the
[3460.64 - 3465.52] only time you've ever had a headache
[3462.96 - 3467.28] or are you coming down with the flu
[3465.52 - 3469.12] you're coming down with something
[3467.28 - 3470.80] at the same time you start at the
[3469.12 - 3472.80] cleanse
[3470.80 - 3475.84] did you already have headaches nothing
[3472.80 - 3478.00] else gives you a headache you can eat a
[3475.84 - 3479.36] vegan pizza not have a headache but you
[3478.00 - 3481.60] have a heavy metal detox smoothie and it
[3479.36 - 3483.36] gives you a headache
[3481.60 - 3485.92] i just want you to be a detective your
[3483.36 - 3488.16] own detective right
[3485.92 - 3489.04] if for some reason you are experiencing
[3488.16 - 3491.52] that from
[3489.04 - 3492.48] the heavy metal detox smoothie lower the
[3491.52 - 3496.00] dose
[3492.48 - 3497.68] make a tiny one or put tiny amounts of
[3496.00 - 3500.56] everything in it
[3497.68 - 3502.24] and see how it is if you're that toxic
[3500.56 - 3503.36] super toxic but the heavy metal detox
[3502.24 - 3507.04] smoothie
[3503.36 - 3509.44] removes toxins without shaking them up
[3507.04 - 3511.28] so it doesn't give people headaches
[3509.44 - 3512.88] because it removes the toxins it doesn't
[3511.28 - 3516.48] shake up the toxins
[3512.88 - 3518.08] but what you can do is
[3516.48 - 3521.52] you can do smaller smaller smaller
[3518.08 - 3521.52] amount you can try that
[3522.00 - 3525.28] i mean it's amazing you're trying to do
[3523.36 - 3526.48] it you're doing it so i support you in
[3525.28 - 3527.52] any way you're doing it you've got to
[3526.48 - 3528.84] use a tiny amount
[3527.52 - 3530.72] you can always try and that's what i
[3528.84 - 3534.40] would say
[3530.72 - 3535.12] i've i've told uh i've told people who
[3534.40 - 3537.60] also
[3535.12 - 3539.44] are sensitive in general that they start
[3537.60 - 3540.64] with a little bit of everything is fine
[3539.44 - 3542.48] and that there's nothing wrong with a
[3540.64 - 3543.92] lot of people are afraid to do stuff too
[3542.48 - 3545.60] because they're sensitive you're like
[3543.92 - 3547.68] afraid to try something you think oh
[3545.60 - 3549.68] do just a little bit and then you'll
[3547.68 - 3550.56] build up the confidence as you go along
[3549.68 - 3554.16] right
[3550.56 - 3554.80] that's the uh vimergy wild blueberry
[3554.16 - 3557.04] powder
[3554.80 - 3558.56] if you don't have another thing too like
[3557.04 - 3560.96] what creates headaches
[3558.56 - 3562.88] well bananas and wild blueberries aren't
[3560.96 - 3566.24] going to create headaches
[3562.88 - 3570.16] but but uh metals do
[3566.24 - 3571.84] viruses do caffeine does chocolate does
[3570.16 - 3573.44] so chocolate so that's the person who
[3571.84 - 3574.72] says well i get headaches we've been
[3573.44 - 3577.44] doing that well did you have chocolate
[3574.72 - 3579.04] the night before do you do caffeine at
[3577.44 - 3581.12] all do you do green tea at all do you do
[3579.04 - 3583.52] kombucha tea which has caffeine in it
[3581.12 - 3585.20] you're doing caffeine caffeines give
[3583.52 - 3586.72] people headache and withdrawal from
[3585.20 - 3588.88] caffeine gives your head so if you're
[3586.72 - 3590.48] starting the heavy metal detox cleanse
[3588.88 - 3591.92] and you just quit caffeine without
[3590.48 - 3593.36] realizing it
[3591.92 - 3594.64] you might be getting withdrawal too
[3593.36 - 3595.04] these are all the things in case you're
[3594.64 - 3596.88] in
[3595.04 - 3598.48] you know in case you haven't looked at
[3596.88 - 3600.88] everything
[3598.48 - 3602.56] um i'm going to put the if you don't
[3600.88 - 3603.92] have the frozen wild blueberries
[3602.56 - 3606.08] you can just do the vimergy wild
[3603.92 - 3608.24] blueberry powder
[3606.08 - 3609.84] if you have to and just throw that in
[3608.24 - 3611.52] you just do a little bit and just do a
[3609.84 - 3615.84] tablespoon
[3611.52 - 3617.84] and you go that route right tablespoon
[3615.84 - 3619.04] or a little more if you want that's
[3617.84 - 3622.48] bimrgy.com via
[3619.04 - 3624.24] victor i am as mary e r g dot com
[3622.48 - 3625.84] what i love about vimergy you guys know
[3624.24 - 3626.72] it's one of not just the quality and
[3625.84 - 3627.76] everything else they're the only
[3626.72 - 3630.88] supplement company
[3627.76 - 3633.92] supplement company right
[3630.88 - 3636.56] that refuses to allow manufacturing
[3633.92 - 3638.00] to put in a small percentage of
[3636.56 - 3639.60] something nobody knows they're getting
[3638.00 - 3641.76] in every other supplement so if you're
[3639.60 - 3644.64] you're if you're you like the fulvic
[3641.76 - 3646.24] acid or fulvic mineral supplement
[3644.64 - 3647.36] there's a small percentage of something
[3646.24 - 3649.76] in there you don't know
[3647.36 - 3651.04] shouldn't be in there if you like a
[3649.76 - 3652.56] zeolite product
[3651.04 - 3653.84] there's a small percentage of something
[3652.56 - 3654.16] in there shouldn't be in there if you
[3653.84 - 3657.12] like
[3654.16 - 3658.48] a diatomaceous earth product if you like
[3657.12 - 3659.84] that then there's a certain thing that
[3658.48 - 3660.48] nobody knows if you like a bentonite
[3659.84 - 3661.76] clay
[3660.48 - 3662.88] there's a certain percentage of
[3661.76 - 3665.28] something that shouldn't be in there if
[3662.88 - 3666.96] you like some other kind of vitamin or
[3665.28 - 3669.44] v complex out there there's a certain
[3666.96 - 3671.68] something that shouldn't be in there
[3669.44 - 3673.44] i'm just saying and some of those
[3671.68 - 3675.76] products i would never touch with a
[3673.44 - 3677.76] 1000 foot pole diatomaceous earth
[3675.76 - 3679.52] particles chlorella i wouldn't touch
[3677.76 - 3680.96] i wouldn't touch corel you guys saw what
[3679.52 - 3682.72] happened yesterday when i was the
[3680.96 - 3684.16] when i was the wild blueberry like
[3682.72 - 3684.88] removing heavy metals and then i was
[3684.16 - 3686.32] chlorella
[3684.88 - 3688.80] and i knocked over the blender and
[3686.32 - 3691.12] everything just fell apart
[3688.80 - 3691.84] but vimergy doesn't have those hidden
[3691.12 - 3695.28] things
[3691.84 - 3697.76] hidden sinisterly
[3695.28 - 3698.96] hidden away they refuse to do it they're
[3697.76 - 3699.44] like it's not gonna happen they're like
[3698.96 - 3701.28] nope
[3699.44 - 3702.72] not gonna happen not for us every other
[3701.28 - 3703.20] stuff every supplement company in the
[3702.72 - 3705.12] world
[3703.20 - 3706.48] they got they got a certain amount of
[3705.12 - 3707.92] something in there you guys don't know
[3706.48 - 3708.56] about that's in there it's not listed on
[3707.92 - 3710.32] the ingredients
[3708.56 - 3712.16] and vemma just said we're not doing it
[3710.32 - 3714.32] we're not doing it no way

[3724.56 - 3728.64] friends with them
[3726.00 - 3729.20] then i could kind of like be in touch
[3728.64 - 3732.32] and be like
[3729.20 - 3735.28] did you guys change something
[3732.32 - 3737.92] and that's why i ditched the pacific the
[3735.28 - 3739.92] the specific spirulina i ditched it

[3745.76 - 3750.24] i was seeing problems and they never
[3748.32 - 3752.24] contacted me back
[3750.24 - 3753.76] so i like making friends with any
[3752.24 - 3755.20] supplement company can that's putting
[3753.76 - 3757.84] out good stuff so i can be like

[3764.48 - 3769.84] you know they're like they're really
[3767.04 - 3769.84] special people
[3770.56 - 3775.20] anyway you guys know i'm working with
[3773.52 - 3776.72] wyman's though i'm not sponsored by them
[3775.20 - 3778.88] but i'm working with wyman's and they're
[3776.72 - 3782.16] they're amazing people too
[3778.88 - 3783.68] and they call me back
[3782.16 - 3786.32] that's how that's what happened you know
[3783.68 - 3788.88] like it's like if you're gonna like
[3786.32 - 3789.36] if you're gonna like make sure stuff is
[3788.88 - 3791.68] right
[3789.36 - 3792.72] and not changing and stuff is incredible
[3791.68 - 3796.24] you want
[3792.72 - 3797.52] you want communication and then
[3796.24 - 3799.28] friendships develop through that
[3797.52 - 3800.24] communication and it's good because it's
[3799.28 - 3802.16] like okay
[3800.24 - 3804.08] keep everything at the top grade at the
[3802.16 - 3804.88] top notch the highest quality possible
[3804.08 - 3807.28] and hey
[3804.88 - 3808.40] it even should be like this and all
[3807.28 - 3809.92] right so
[3808.40 - 3812.32] i put some spirulina in here let's talk
[3809.92 - 3815.36] about spirulina a little bit spirulina
[3812.32 - 3818.64] is light years from chlorella
[3815.36 - 3821.28] chlorella disastrous
[3818.64 - 3823.20] disastrous just letting you know
[3821.28 - 3824.00] chlorella doesn't remove toxic heavy
[3823.20 - 3827.76] metals and
[3824.00 - 3831.04] if it does it will drop it and and and
[3827.76 - 3834.16] basically drag it
[3831.04 - 3835.20] that means if it ever does unloot so
[3834.16 - 3836.96] here's how it works
[3835.20 - 3839.20] so if you're told by your practitioner
[3836.96 - 3840.88] your naturopath your chiropractor
[3839.20 - 3842.48] you're told by your influencer who's
[3840.88 - 3843.68] saying i'm taking chlorella because i'm
[3842.48 - 3845.44] getting metals out
[3843.68 - 3847.36] metals they only know about now because
[3845.44 - 3847.84] of medical medium information for 35
[3847.36 - 3849.60] years
[3847.84 - 3850.88] and if you some influence or if some
[3849.60 - 3852.48] chiropractor or some nd
[3850.88 - 3854.32] or some functional medicine doctor says
[3852.48 - 3856.08] here's a chlorella product or
[3854.32 - 3857.68] you find a chlorella product out there
[3856.08 - 3859.60] somewhere right
[3857.68 - 3861.12] and you're like it's and you read about
[3859.60 - 3861.92] it's like yeah chlorella takes out
[3861.12 - 3865.36] metals
[3861.92 - 3867.28] yeah if it ever did take out metal
[3865.36 - 3869.68] here's what happens with chlorella
[3867.28 - 3872.72] it drags the metal and worsens the
[3869.68 - 3875.76] disease or condition
[3872.72 - 3877.04] it drags it and drops it that's what
[3875.76 - 3878.48] chlorella does
[3877.04 - 3880.32] drags it and drops what would i have
[3878.48 - 3882.00] against chlorella what would i
[3880.32 - 3883.92] if it worked i'd be like chlorella
[3882.00 - 3885.68] chlorella i'd be like everybody should
[3883.92 - 3886.40] be on chlorella if it worked i'd be like
[3885.68 - 3888.56] chlorella
[3886.40 - 3890.32] here for the thousandth time i'm gonna
[3888.56 - 3892.24] show you chlorella you guys
[3890.32 - 3894.08] like i show you everything else what
[3892.24 - 3895.52] would what would i have against it it
[3894.08 - 3899.28] doesn't work
[3895.52 - 3901.60] it doesn't work it's disastrous
[3899.28 - 3903.28] but that's not why i hate chlorella the
[3901.60 - 3905.52] most
[3903.28 - 3906.88] in fact that it drags the metal if it
[3905.52 - 3908.88] does pick it up
[3906.88 - 3910.56] and worsens the disease or condition or
[3908.88 - 3911.92] symptom like anxiety or depression or
[3910.56 - 3914.40] anything
[3911.92 - 3916.08] right that's not that's one but that's
[3914.40 - 3918.96] not the worst reason why
[3916.08 - 3919.36] the worst reason why is because bacteria
[3918.96 - 3922.96] that's
[3919.36 - 3927.76] bad thrives in chlorella
[3922.96 - 3927.76] spirulina is antibacterial
[3927.96 - 3934.00] antibacterial chlorella
[3930.64 - 3934.00] is bacterial
[3934.80 - 3939.28] that's why many people have been like
[3939.60 - 3944.88] and attached to their toilet for weeks
[3942.72 - 3947.60] because of getting poisoned by chlorella
[3944.88 - 3952.24] because it's not even tested properly
[3947.60 - 3955.52] because it's a magnet for bad bacteria
[3952.24 - 3957.44] that means it feeds the bad stuff inside
[3955.52 - 3959.44] you let me take my chlorella and feed
[3957.44 - 3959.76] every bad bacteria and bug i got inside
[3959.44 - 3961.76] of me
[3959.76 - 3965.12] and make sure i get sicker down the road
[3961.76 - 3967.52] that's chlorella
[3965.12 - 3969.12] you know what sucks you guys check this
[3967.52 - 3971.12] out
[3969.12 - 3973.84] you know what really really you know
[3971.12 - 3976.72] it's really hard
[3973.84 - 3977.68] and i understand i sympathize i really
[3976.72 - 3979.28] do
[3977.68 - 3981.68] just hear me out if you got a minute if
[3979.28 - 3985.20] you just got one second okay
[3981.68 - 3988.00] if i was a doctor
[3985.20 - 3989.68] and i was and i spent 10 years pushing
[3988.00 - 3991.44] chlorella
[3989.68 - 3993.04] you think i would want to be told i'm
[3991.44 - 3995.76] wrong
[3993.04 - 3996.88] or that i've been giving my patients
[3996.88 - 4001.12] for 10 years no i'm going to fight for
[4000.16 - 4002.88] it
[4001.12 - 4005.04] and i'm going to stand my ground because
[4002.88 - 4009.04] i am not going to be mud
[4005.04 - 4010.64] if i was a healer or naturopathic doctor
[4009.04 - 4014.08] out there
[4010.64 - 4017.28] or chiropractor
[4014.08 - 4019.28] if i was an influencer
[4017.28 - 4020.40] that was pushing something for a few
[4019.28 - 4023.84] years
[4020.40 - 4026.40] and i told my whole crowd this is what
[4023.84 - 4029.92] gets chlorella chlorella chlorella
[4026.40 - 4030.64] even if i learn the truth it's hard to
[4029.92 - 4034.16] be like
[4030.64 - 4036.40] oh i was wrong
[4034.16 - 4037.20] it's hard to just chalk it up and be
[4036.40 - 4039.52] like
[4037.20 - 4040.80] a chiropractor that's like uh i've been
[4039.52 - 4043.76] giving you chlorella
[4040.80 - 4044.56] all these years telling you what's good
[4043.76 - 4047.04] um
[4044.56 - 4049.36] i'm probably wrong i'm hearing and i'm
[4047.04 - 4054.00] wrong i'm not gonna
[4049.36 - 4057.44] admit it here's chlorella here you go
[4054.00 - 4060.00] here you go here's clarella here you go
[4057.44 - 4061.60] same thing with anything same thing with
[4060.00 - 4063.60] all the different stuff if you're
[4061.60 - 4065.36] been pushing coffee enemas for 20 years
[4063.60 - 4068.00] in your practice
[4065.36 - 4069.60] coffee enemas are absolutely disastrous
[4068.00 - 4072.24] disastrous
[4069.60 - 4073.76] they just kill the the nervous system
[4072.24 - 4075.92] weaken the immune system
[4073.76 - 4078.16] destroy the nervous system coffee enemas
[4075.92 - 4081.92] are a tragedy
[4078.16 - 4083.68] right and if i was a practitioner and
[4081.92 - 4084.72] i'm telling people to eat coffee animals
[4083.68 - 4088.84] for 10 years
[4084.72 - 4091.84] you think i'm gonna stop and say i was
[4088.84 - 4091.84] wrong
[4092.40 - 4101.92] no way meaning like
[4097.36 - 4101.92] a lot won't maybe some will
[4102.32 - 4106.72] is coffee enema bad too horrible
[4104.80 - 4110.00] horrible
[4106.72 - 4115.20] and i simplify i do i do if i was wrong
[4110.00 - 4118.16] i would say it i screwed up i'm wrong
[4115.20 - 4120.00] but i'm lucky because i'm not the one
[4118.16 - 4123.08] calling the shots
[4120.00 - 4125.84] i'm not that doctor that's hearing
[4123.08 - 4127.60] misinformation and then giving you some
[4125.84 - 4128.24] coffee enema and saying it's good for
[4127.60 - 4131.68] you
[4128.24 - 4134.72] i got my source my source is not
[4131.68 - 4136.80] a man my source is not meaning men
[4134.72 - 4139.04] on the planet a human being on the
[4136.80 - 4142.32] planet my source is not
[4139.04 - 4143.36] my source is not a human being who makes
[4142.32 - 4146.32] mistakes
[4143.36 - 4148.00] and then says yeah you can do chlorella
[4146.32 - 4150.88] yeah you can do
[4148.00 - 4153.44] you know mercury fillings in the 1920s
[4150.88 - 4157.44] 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s and 80s
[4153.44 - 4160.56] 90s 2000s you can do mercury fillings
[4157.44 - 4161.20] my source isn't that so so that's the
[4160.56 - 4163.04] difference
[4161.20 - 4164.32] but i get it when you don't have that
[4163.04 - 4166.00] source
[4164.32 - 4167.36] where i get the information from since i
[4166.00 - 4167.84] was age four if you don't have that
[4167.36 - 4169.36] source
[4167.84 - 4170.96] you can make the mistakes and you could
[4169.36 - 4174.08] be giving out coffee
[4170.96 - 4176.32] enemas for years and then if you're even
[4174.08 - 4177.28] if you're even told hey that's really
[4176.32 - 4180.08] bad because
[4177.28 - 4181.84] your stomach buffers the caffeine to at
[4180.08 - 4183.44] least protect you a little bit but when
[4181.84 - 4185.12] you get coffee the other end like the
[4183.44 - 4186.80] coffee animal the other end up
[4185.12 - 4188.56] that you have nothing to buffer it and
[4186.80 - 4190.48] it goes straight to your nervous system
[4188.56 - 4192.48] and it starts to annihilate your vagus
[4190.48 - 4195.76] nerve so when you do coffee enemas
[4192.48 - 4198.00] you're doing vagus nerve damage
[4195.76 - 4199.44] and then that chiropractor that doctor's
[4198.00 - 4201.84] gonna be like i'm not gonna
[4199.44 - 4203.84] i can't stop i just i just spent 15
[4201.84 - 4205.44] years invested in coffee enemas giving
[4203.84 - 4207.76] all my patients coffee enemas
[4205.44 - 4209.68] and i can't tell them to stop i can't
[4207.76 - 4212.88] say i can't admit i was wrong
[4209.68 - 4215.12] i wrote a an e-book about coffee enemas
[4212.88 - 4216.32] how could i admit i'm wrong no you fight
[4215.12 - 4221.52] for it
[4216.32 - 4221.52] who cares about the people i get it
[4223.84 - 4230.72] okay let's make the smoothie let's get
[4225.28 - 4232.24] two bananas in there you guys
[4230.72 - 4234.32] but there are some good doctors that say
[4232.24 - 4235.44] you know what i heard that coffee enemas
[4234.32 - 4239.04] are bad
[4235.44 - 4241.12] i'm gonna stop doing that i heard
[4239.04 - 4243.12] that diatomaceous diatomaceous earth
[4241.12 - 4245.68] particles are bad i heard that chlorella
[4243.12 - 4248.72] is not the best spirulina's better
[4245.68 - 4251.68] i heard pacific spirulina
[4248.72 - 4251.68] is garbage
[4251.76 - 4255.12] and i'm gonna tell my patients there's
[4253.28 - 4258.08] some incredible doctors that do do that
[4255.12 - 4260.40] don't get me wrong
[4258.08 - 4262.88] but no one's held accountable for all
[4260.40 - 4265.20] the mistakes in alternative medicine
[4262.88 - 4265.20] ever
[4266.24 - 4270.24] i got cilantro in here we're trying to
[4268.48 - 4272.24] make the smoothie and i i'm talking
[4270.24 - 4274.56] yours off i feel really bad now
[4272.24 - 4274.56] you know
[4281.52 - 4289.92] when you're really sick coffee enema
[4286.08 - 4292.80] will break you you won't heal from it
[4289.92 - 4293.60] it will break you it will break you
[4292.80 - 4295.84] it'll get you
[4293.60 - 4298.32] high if you're strong enough to handle
[4295.84 - 4299.84] the high that the caffeine gives you
[4298.32 - 4302.16] thinking that you did something good for
[4299.84 - 4303.44] yourself but if you're not strong enough
[4302.16 - 4305.36] to handle that high
[4303.44 - 4307.20] and you're weaker because you're injured
[4305.36 - 4308.64] and sick and you're sick you're viral
[4307.20 - 4312.56] and you're sick your nervous system
[4308.64 - 4312.56] that coffee enema will send you down
[4313.20 - 4319.52] to an early grave cilantro
[4317.84 - 4322.48] poisons the heart and brain puts it into
[4319.52 - 4324.24] shock cilantro
[4322.48 - 4326.00] goes into the brain and helps to remove
[4324.24 - 4327.12] toxicated metals it's got phytochemical
[4326.00 - 4330.48] compounds attached
[4327.12 - 4331.84] to the mineral salts trace mineral salts
[4330.48 - 4333.36] when you combine that with the wild
[4331.84 - 4334.08] blueberry and you've got the spirulina
[4333.36 - 4335.68] in there
[4334.08 - 4339.52] and that's the demergie spirulina by the
[4335.68 - 4341.52] way right you got the spirulina in there
[4339.52 - 4342.88] um if you don't like the taste of that
[4341.52 - 4343.84] cilantro that's because you've got a lot
[4342.88 - 4345.36] of metals

[4450.48 - 4454.00] do the parasite thing too all on its own
[4452.48 - 4455.76] just like oh it's now the parasite
[4454.00 - 4457.28] thing over and over again have you guys
[4455.76 - 4460.24] been seasoned enough to see this
[4457.28 - 4461.20] 1980 oh maybe it's a parasite 1990 oh
[4460.24 - 4463.20] it's a parasite
[4461.20 - 4464.64] oh night 2 000 is a parasite actually
[4463.20 - 4466.56] not in the 80s is parasite
[4464.64 - 4467.92] actually no the parasite thing came off
[4466.56 - 4469.04] of medical medium talking about people
[4467.92 - 4471.44] having bugs in them
[4469.04 - 4473.04] back in the mid 80s so teaching you know
[4471.44 - 4475.52] in early 80s when i was like
[4473.04 - 4476.40] like full throttle teaching people every
[4475.52 - 4478.72] day about
[4476.40 - 4480.80] about um people having bugs and people
[4478.72 - 4484.00] having viruses and everybody's like what
[4480.80 - 4486.40] little parasites no parasite
[4484.00 - 4487.20] thing came out of dysentery the amoeba
[4486.40 - 4489.04] that's in bad
[4487.20 - 4490.96] water that's where the parasite thing
[4489.04 - 4492.72] developed but then it took off after the
[4490.96 - 4493.52] whole viral thing i was talking about
[4492.72 - 4495.84] and then by the
[4493.52 - 4498.16] early 2000s it was like we keep on
[4495.84 - 4500.40] hearing about viruses for medical medium
[4498.16 - 4502.16] but isn't it a parasite that we need to
[4500.40 - 4503.68] be talking about and then worms
[4502.16 - 4505.84] and then there you go again back to the
[4503.68 - 4509.04] warm thing everybody's trying to bank
[4505.84 - 4511.20] bank get you on a worm protocol
[4509.04 - 4512.64] it doesn't fix your hashimoto's it won't
[4511.20 - 4514.24] fix your other problems it won't fix
[4512.64 - 4517.36] your hyperthyroids it won't fix your
[4514.24 - 4519.60] brain fog won't fix anything
[4517.36 - 4521.52] chrissy said to clarify i work in a
[4519.60 - 4524.24] prison and don't have access to a
[4521.52 - 4526.80] blender i need to make it at
[4524.24 - 4527.28] zero three three zero how long can it
[4526.80 - 4530.32] sit
[4527.28 - 4532.16] in the fridge before i need to
[4530.32 - 4533.28] drink it how long can it sit in the
[4532.16 - 4534.80] fridge i can sit in the fridge for a
[4533.28 - 4537.12] while you might need a spoon
[4534.80 - 4539.04] for the smoothie because it congeals
[4537.12 - 4541.68] because of the wild blueberry pectin
[4539.04 - 4542.96] it couldn't it congeals right so you you
[4541.68 - 4544.16] can
[4542.96 - 4546.24] you can see you know you can have it in
[4544.16 - 4549.44] the fridge definitely
[4546.24 - 4551.44] 24 well 12 hours
[4549.44 - 4553.12] i probably wouldn't let it go past 12
[4551.44 - 4553.52] hours i probably wouldn't let it go past
[4553.12 - 4556.56] that
[4553.52 - 4559.36] right these are popsicles i actually
[4556.56 - 4561.44] made these popsicles
[4559.36 - 4563.20] so i made some popsicles right these are
[4561.44 - 4564.88] they're frozen great for kids

[4569.20 - 4574.72] little popsicle container here

[4581.28 - 4586.08] there cilantro in there wild blueberry
[4582.96 - 4588.40] spirulina barley grass juice powder
[4586.08 - 4589.92] i don't think i put that in so the
[4588.40 - 4591.36] emergency barley grass is better don't
[4589.92 - 4593.12] do barley grass
[4591.36 - 4595.12] it's gotta be coffee grass powder
[4593.12 - 4597.92] removes toxic heavy metals
[4595.12 - 4599.52] even if you don't do all this and you
[4597.92 - 4600.88] just do a little bit of barley grass
[4599.52 - 4602.40] juice powder every day
[4600.88 - 4604.08] you're gonna be moving yourself forward
[4602.40 - 4606.40] right the right kind right
[4604.08 - 4607.52] spirulina same thing you know if people
[4606.40 - 4610.00] if you don't have
[4607.52 - 4611.84] the the means or the capacity to have
[4610.00 - 4614.24] all the things you need
[4611.84 - 4615.60] susan renee cilantro powder or juice
[4614.24 - 4617.68] would be convenient
[4615.60 - 4618.96] if it's still as effective as a natural
[4617.68 - 4622.24] kind
[4618.96 - 4623.12] cilantro in its holy form is what you
[4622.24 - 4626.08] want
[4623.12 - 4627.28] raw fresh in its holy form if you it is
[4626.08 - 4630.16] best
[4627.28 - 4632.24] not even juiced but in its holy form
[4630.16 - 4634.16] when it comes down to cilantro right
[4632.24 - 4636.64] you got to have the living water in
[4634.16 - 4638.48] there as much as possible
[4636.64 - 4640.24] to when you're about to drink it so you
[4638.48 - 4643.28] keep it in the whole leaf so that one

[4668.08 - 4679.84] came on here
[4680.56 - 4685.84] so on tick tock i personally feel like
[4682.72 - 4685.84] i've been scammed
[4686.24 - 4691.36] and fell for a lot of
[4689.44 - 4693.44] laugh out loud thank you for this i'm
[4691.36 - 4696.40] honored you're here
[4693.44 - 4696.40] a monitor here
[4697.44 - 4702.72] the scamming is unreal unreal out there
[4701.28 - 4704.48] um so i was just showing you the
[4702.72 - 4705.44] popsicles they're for kids i mentioned
[4704.48 - 4709.28] earlier
[4705.44 - 4711.28] right for kids popsicles
[4709.28 - 4713.60] um you can get popsicle holders like
[4711.28 - 4716.80] this this is really cool
[4713.60 - 4719.04] the scamming is insane out there there's
[4716.80 - 4721.28] a new type of scam going on now though
[4719.04 - 4722.16] it's scan medical medium information
[4721.28 - 4724.32] because no one
[4722.16 - 4726.48] no one in alternative medicine has like
[4724.32 - 4727.68] information like if you read the medical
[4726.48 - 4729.60] books if you read
[4727.68 - 4731.44] the the medical books right the medical
[4729.60 - 4733.04] media medical books if you read these
[4731.44 - 4734.88] you'll see how much information is in
[4733.04 - 4736.64] here right so what's happening is the
[4734.88 - 4739.20] new scam is to take
[4736.64 - 4740.40] data from these books not cite it back
[4739.20 - 4743.36] to medical medium
[4740.40 - 4744.48] write posts about it post it and then
[4743.36 - 4746.00] they get a bunch of people commenting
[4744.48 - 4747.36] like oh my god i didn't know that
[4746.00 - 4749.12] and meanwhile the practitioner or the
[4747.36 - 4751.04] influencer isn't even even
[4749.12 - 4752.16] isn't even mentioning medical medium but
[4751.04 - 4753.68] they look like a hero
[4752.16 - 4755.28] because they're they're talking about
[4753.68 - 4755.68] stuff you can never get anywhere else
[4755.28 - 4757.44] right
[4755.68 - 4759.04] and then they recommend stuff that's bad
[4757.44 - 4762.08] for you
[4759.04 - 4764.16] that's the new scam we're
[4762.08 - 4766.08] seeing it every minute right now out
[4764.16 - 4767.44] there and then the person can't heal
[4766.08 - 4769.60] because they don't really know
[4767.44 - 4770.88] where they're supposed to go and what
[4769.60 - 4777.84] they really need and
[4770.88 - 4777.84] so sad
[4779.12 - 4790.72] so we got heavy metal detox smoothie
[4782.64 - 4792.48] right here awesome
[4790.72 - 4794.48] thing is i need a huge team of people to
[4792.48 - 4796.88] keep up with it and they're just
[4794.48 - 4796.88] you know
[4798.16 - 4801.76] it's really hard i mean i'm writing a
[4800.48 - 4803.28] book right now i'm trying to finish up a
[4801.76 - 4806.56] book and hand in the manuscript to the
[4803.28 - 4808.56] publisher it's already two months late
[4806.56 - 4809.84] it's like i'm working till three o'clock
[4808.56 - 4811.76] in the morning four o'clock in the
[4809.84 - 4813.76] morning i wake up at six in the morning
[4811.76 - 4815.28] i'm trying to get the book done it's
[4813.76 - 4818.00] just too much going on
[4815.28 - 4818.48] and you can't keep track of all the of
[4818.00 - 4821.04] all the
[4818.48 - 4822.24] you know the shenanigans that are
[4821.04 - 4827.84] happening out there
[4822.24 - 4827.84] you know anyway apples
[4828.96 - 4834.88] try to do a couple apples before noon
[4832.56 - 4836.32] keep the radical fats out before noon
[4834.88 - 4837.84] try to keep them out try
[4836.32 - 4839.28] try the best if you're somebody that
[4837.84 - 4840.88] still wants to have your avocado toast
[4839.28 - 4843.28] and your heavy metal detox smoothie
[4840.88 - 4844.24] i welcome that but but if you want the
[4843.28 - 4845.92] best out of it
[4844.24 - 4848.24] what you if you want to really kick some
[4845.92 - 4851.36] serious butt and get metals out quicker
[4848.24 - 4854.00] do the heavy metal detox cleanse without
[4851.36 - 4854.80] having anything any any fat at all in
[4854.00 - 4856.56] the morning
[4854.80 - 4858.32] try to be fat free where you're just
[4856.56 - 4859.60] doing the smoothie you're doing your
[4858.32 - 4861.28] lemon water of course you know the
[4859.60 - 4862.32] rhythm and then your celery juice and
[4861.28 - 4864.48] then the smoothie
[4862.32 - 4866.16] and you got that the problem is with the
[4864.48 - 4867.84] fats is it thickens up the blood so it
[4866.16 - 4869.44] makes it harder to get metals out
[4867.84 - 4870.96] even though you can still get some out
[4869.44 - 4871.68] each day if that's what you do but try
[4870.96 - 4873.44] to do
[4871.68 - 4875.20] fats at the end of the day this way you
[4873.44 - 4876.64] can get metals out all morning and
[4875.20 - 4877.92] afternoon and then the fats at the end
[4876.64 - 4879.36] of the day so you could do your avocado
[4877.92 - 4880.96] your nuts or seeds if that's what you
[4879.36 - 4882.64] live off of that's what you like
[4880.96 - 4884.32] you do all that stuff then and your
[4882.64 - 4886.32] olive oil whatever it is that you like
[4884.32 - 4888.16] and your chicken your meat this is an
[4886.32 - 4889.52] anti-animal protein or anti-plant-based

[4891.04 - 4894.08] everybody's welcome this is the only
[4893.52 - 4895.84] place
[4894.08 - 4897.68] in the alternative health movement that
[4895.84 - 4899.68] isn't on one side or the other
[4897.68 - 4900.96] okay now you'll start hearing like
[4899.68 - 4903.44] mimickers
