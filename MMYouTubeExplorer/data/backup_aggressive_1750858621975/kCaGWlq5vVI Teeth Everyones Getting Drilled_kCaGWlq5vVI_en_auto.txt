[403.68 - 407.82] you know I am here we're talking about
[405.90 - 409.14] teeth the whole bit I know so many
[407.82 - 411.66] people are going through so much trouble
[409.14 - 413.76] with their teeth the point is is yes you
[411.66 - 417.18] get a good dentist right you get work
[413.76 - 420.18] done yep of course right but how do we
[417.18 - 423.06] protect our teeth so they're not falling
[420.18 - 426.42] apart as time goes on how do we protect
[423.06 - 429.24] your teeth so that we actually stay safe
[426.42 - 431.70] with our teeth teeth along the way and
[429.24 - 433.74] we don't lose our teeth because so many
[431.70 - 436.98] people lose their teeth they got molars
[433.74 - 439.56] missing they got they got front teeth
[436.98 - 441.30] missing they got bottom teeth missing so
[439.56 - 444.78] it's really important to take care of
[441.30 - 447.24] our teeth link is in the description the
[444.78 - 449.58] episode I just released last night is
[447.24 - 453.30] called teeth everyone's getting drilled
[449.58 - 456.18] it's free it's intense there's a lot of
[453.30 - 458.28] information the details matter just so
[456.18 - 460.26] you guys know right Details Matter it's
[458.28 - 463.02] packed with information
[460.26 - 465.24] and so you might want to listen to it if
[463.02 - 468.72] you get a chance it's really good info
[465.24 - 471.36] of course and no commercials no
[468.72 - 472.98] advertisements or commercials and that's
[471.36 - 475.08] what's incredible it's a number one
[472.98 - 476.76] podcast with no commercials no one's
[475.08 - 478.86] ever done that but we like to do that
[476.76 - 480.96] that's that's the difference here so you
[478.86 - 482.34] guys we're talking about sugar earlier
[480.96 - 483.66] today and I want to talk about a little
[482.34 - 485.94] bit more for a minute
[483.66 - 488.46] no matter where you go no matter who you
[485.94 - 490.44] talk to sugar is the destroyer of teeth
[488.46 - 493.32] you'll hear so you'll hear that out
[490.44 - 496.08] there sugar is and it makes people shy
[493.32 - 497.10] away from fruit it makes them shy away
[496.08 - 501.36] from
[497.10 - 504.66] bananas mangoes papayas Cherries Berries
[501.36 - 507.96] apples it makes them afraid to eat the
[504.66 - 509.28] foods that actually help our teeth and
[507.96 - 512.16] that's what happens out there because we
[509.28 - 513.96] think we lump all sugar as the same
[512.16 - 516.00] that's what professionals do out there
[513.96 - 518.52] that's what health Advocates do
[516.00 - 520.44] professionals whatever they lump sugar
[518.52 - 523.14] all together and then they're afraid of
[520.44 - 525.00] having a piece of fruit Olivia Lett says
[523.14 - 527.04] it's really an incredible podcast for
[525.00 - 529.50] outbreaking science as usual nobody
[527.04 - 531.96] knows that advanced science incredible
[529.50 - 533.52] Olivia incredibly listened to it so
[531.96 - 535.50] honored and thank you for being here
[533.52 - 537.60] again right Kara says I just listened to
[535.50 - 540.66] your podcast on teeth was really curious
[537.60 - 543.36] about the not doing everything at once
[540.66 - 545.04] is that just for teeth so not doing
[543.36 - 547.86] everything at once
[545.04 - 549.72] so you can baby step to take care of
[547.86 - 553.20] yourself and your health you know some
[549.72 - 556.14] people do lemon water celery juice some
[553.20 - 558.06] people do 369 Advanced cleanse some
[556.14 - 560.46] people do the monocleanse some people do
[558.06 - 562.56] protocols for their autoimmune and every
[560.46 - 565.08] bit counts you know you got to customize
[562.56 - 568.62] too but the key is right
[565.08 - 571.14] the key is is to make sure that you
[568.62 - 573.18] don't fall into Fruit fear because the
[571.14 - 574.80] fruit fear will get everybody every time
[573.18 - 578.40] and I'll tell you why what happens is
[574.80 - 580.62] that when we get fruit fear we then get
[578.40 - 583.14] afraid of the things we need and that's
[580.62 - 585.60] how it always works and we end up eating
[583.14 - 587.40] chocolate once again we end up eating
[585.60 - 589.98] all the chocolate that's the thing we do
[587.40 - 591.66] so we go for that because we're not
[589.98 - 594.36] getting our fruit sugar we're not
[591.66 - 596.10] getting our glucose right so when it
[594.36 - 598.80] comes down to fruit you're getting your
[596.10 - 601.98] minerals your trace minerals to help
[598.80 - 605.04] restore your teeth fruit is alkaline
[601.98 - 608.22] remember that alkaline is the way to go
[605.04 - 610.62] it's not about sugar sugar isn't why
[608.22 - 612.60] people have teeth problems okay we'll
[610.62 - 615.90] cover that in another minute so it's
[612.60 - 617.88] about being alkaline internally but we
[615.90 - 620.16] can't be alkaline when we're eating
[617.88 - 621.84] everything that's not alkaline and you
[620.16 - 624.00] know people say well no that's not true
[621.84 - 626.76] you know I eat really good and you know
[624.00 - 628.74] I eat eat lean protein I'm keto or I'm
[626.76 - 630.36] vegan and I'm keto and I eat beans and I
[628.74 - 631.92] eat nut Butters and not all that's
[630.36 - 634.98] acidic so
[631.92 - 636.06] so we actually eat acidic Foods that's
[634.98 - 638.52] all we do
[636.06 - 641.10] so we eat lots of acidic Foods they
[638.52 - 643.50] don't digest well they don't break down
[641.10 - 645.60] well in the stomach that's what happens
[643.50 - 647.40] you know they don't break well in the
[645.60 - 649.68] stomach and boom
[647.40 - 651.72] so somebody said hey we lost 250 people
[649.68 - 653.22] really quick in a blip yeah that's what
[651.72 - 655.20] happens on here all the time people
[653.22 - 657.84] actually get kicked off all the time on
[655.20 - 659.70] the medical medium lives not by us so
[657.84 - 661.50] you guys medical medium podcasts at
[659.70 - 663.48] Apple podcast just launched three new
[661.50 - 665.64] episodes you guys gotta check it out
[663.48 - 667.92] when you get a chance teeth everyone's
[665.64 - 670.50] getting drilled important pertinent
[667.92 - 672.48] information critical information to
[670.50 - 674.76] protect yourself right Doreen says such
[672.48 - 676.68] Common Sense fruit is alkaline fruit is
[674.76 - 679.32] actually alkaline it's about what's
[676.68 - 681.72] happening inside the body right inside
[679.32 - 683.34] your stomach your intestinal tract your
[681.72 - 686.16] gut your liver it's about what's
[683.34 - 689.46] happening here that protects here that's
[686.16 - 693.42] the key what happens in here protects
[689.46 - 696.30] here right that's how it works so we
[693.42 - 699.90] protect our teeth by what we're doing
[696.30 - 701.40] inside here okay so people walk around
[699.90 - 703.38] with stomachs that aren't working good
[701.40 - 705.54] low hydrochloric acid they don't break
[703.38 - 708.54] down their proteins they rot ammonia
[705.54 - 710.88] happens ammonia creeps up
[708.54 - 712.62] into the mouth when you're sleeping at
[710.88 - 714.00] night so let's cover ammonia for a
[712.62 - 715.02] couple of minutes so here's what happens
[714.00 - 718.32] right
[715.02 - 721.20] we're really acidic more than that our
[718.32 - 723.42] HCL doesn't work more than that our bile
[721.20 - 725.82] reserves are low we don't break down our
[723.42 - 728.76] proteins we don't break down our food
[725.82 - 731.16] right our fats and protein it goes
[728.76 - 734.60] rancid and then we go to bed
[731.16 - 737.72] we lay in bed and ammonia from the gut
[734.60 - 741.00] creeps up like the ghost in the night
[737.72 - 744.54] creeps off the up the esophagus right
[741.00 - 745.38] goes into the mouth and it sits into the
[744.54 - 748.08] mouth
[745.38 - 749.84] while you're sleeping when that ammonia
[748.08 - 754.20] sits in the mouth while you're sleeping
[749.84 - 758.10] it goes into the gums and teeth it has a
[754.20 - 760.68] an ability to basically travel through
[758.10 - 762.48] bone that's what ammonia does travels
[760.68 - 764.88] through bone which is your teeth and it
[762.48 - 767.82] weakens them and people end up having
[764.88 - 771.18] weakened teeth along the way
[767.82 - 772.80] so so what happens is when your proteins
[771.18 - 774.24] and your fats aren't digesting well
[772.80 - 776.10] because it's not digesting well for
[774.24 - 779.52] virtually almost everybody
[776.10 - 783.30] all that gas build up in the gut right
[779.52 - 784.68] that putrification that rancid fat
[783.30 - 787.62] builds up
[784.68 - 790.98] all that ammonia gets produced from it
[787.62 - 792.18] putrefying travels up the esophagus sits
[790.98 - 794.58] in your mouth at night when you're
[792.18 - 796.86] sleeping and starts to break down the
[794.58 - 800.94] teeth this process can break people's
[796.86 - 802.68] teeth down real fast real quick and then
[800.94 - 803.88] things can start falling apart from
[802.68 - 806.04] there right
[803.88 - 807.66] so
[806.04 - 809.82] so um
[807.66 - 812.46] back to the whole sugar thing right
[809.82 - 814.92] sugar isn't the problem it's the other
[812.46 - 817.44] stuff sugar is with
[814.92 - 820.44] so it's the other things like I was
[817.44 - 823.62] showing you guys earlier okay this
[820.44 - 825.36] chocolate cake isn't all sugar see so
[823.62 - 827.58] when someone says well I quit sugar I'm
[825.36 - 829.32] avoiding sugar Sugar's the problem
[827.58 - 831.90] that's where it is
[829.32 - 833.34] they're really they're only benefiting
[831.90 - 835.20] not because they're avoiding sugar
[833.34 - 838.50] they're benefiting because they're
[835.20 - 841.74] avoiding the lard and the butter and the
[838.50 - 845.70] dyes and the chemicals and the additives
[841.74 - 848.10] right in the hydrogenated oils right and
[845.70 - 850.32] you can even be doing a healthier piece
[848.10 - 852.84] of cake but that could have vegetable
[850.32 - 853.98] oils in it that can still have other
[852.84 - 855.66] things in it and you might think
[853.98 - 858.18] Butter's healthy and you just got butter
[855.66 - 861.30] in your cake but either way
[858.18 - 864.36] what happens is it's the fats or you got
[861.30 - 866.70] eggs in your cake either way it's the
[864.36 - 869.76] fats that actually cause the problem
[866.70 - 872.70] it's not the sugar and so people don't
[869.76 - 874.32] realize right people be like well don't
[872.70 - 877.14] have apple pie because all that Sugar
[874.32 - 878.88] they actually call this sugar I I see it
[877.14 - 880.50] for years I've seen it for years I see
[878.88 - 883.50] it now people say oh you don't want a
[880.50 - 886.20] piece of pie so much sugar yeah they put
[883.50 - 887.76] a half a cup of sugar in a pie they'll
[886.20 - 889.92] put a cup of sugar in a Pie when they
[887.76 - 892.80] make one but you wouldn't believe how
[889.92 - 894.84] much fat lard and butter is in the pot
[892.80 - 897.12] that's where the culprit is now
[894.84 - 899.52] processed sugar is not good for us by
[897.12 - 901.20] itself we don't just eat sugar all day
[899.52 - 903.06] long this is brown sugar right here
[901.20 - 905.34] we're not like did you have your bowl of
[903.06 - 906.96] sugar today did you have like your whole
[905.34 - 908.58] bowl of sugar today this is really good
[906.96 - 910.14] I'm just gonna have my whole bowl of
[908.58 - 912.18] sugar right now did you have one I have
[910.14 - 913.74] it three times a day so I eat a whole
[912.18 - 916.14] bowl of brown sugar three times a day
[913.74 - 918.66] you guys I better quit my sugar
[916.14 - 921.06] I'm having way too much sugar no that's
[918.66 - 923.94] not what happens people get
[921.06 - 925.86] people get all this fat involved with
[923.94 - 928.20] their food like the ice cream people
[925.86 - 930.66] think ice cream sugar that's what they
[928.20 - 932.40] think they're always like yeah too much
[930.66 - 934.80] sugar in that ice cream you hear it all
[932.40 - 937.08] the time that's the problem right that's
[934.80 - 939.96] not the problem it's actually the fat
[937.08 - 942.66] and the ice cream right and the protein
[939.96 - 944.76] the milk proteins right and the fat they
[942.66 - 946.98] don't break down they don't digest well
[944.76 - 949.62] they rot in the stomach and your teeth
[946.98 - 951.12] go that's how it works Marissa spiritual
[949.62 - 954.30] says thank you so much for bringing Dr
[951.12 - 955.44] Nesbitt out aw yeah Dr Nesbitt wanted to
[954.30 - 958.50] come out
[955.44 - 960.84] so I'm really glad he did
[958.50 - 964.02] so anyway
[960.84 - 966.12] shellini says if I do not have iPhone
[964.02 - 968.40] how can I listen to Apple podcast go to
[966.12 - 970.56] Spotify but I can't guarantee
[968.40 - 972.84] it's not going to be glitched out right
[970.56 - 974.28] we noticed that Apple podcast right and
[972.84 - 977.28] I've always said that medical medium
[974.28 - 979.44] podcast at Apple podcast it it's never
[977.28 - 981.48] censored it's never glitched out it's so
[979.44 - 983.64] far we've been really fortunate so but
[981.48 - 985.74] if you don't have your iPhone just you
[983.64 - 986.64] know Spotify right that's what I would
[985.74 - 989.10] do
[986.64 - 990.90] so anyway you guys back to what we're
[989.10 - 992.10] talking about the teeth episode you got
[990.90 - 994.80] to check it out when you get a chance
[992.10 - 996.30] it's an amazing episode in the sense
[994.80 - 999.12] that it has a lot of detailed
[996.30 - 1000.14] information about how to protect her
[999.12 - 1002.12] teeth
[1000.14 - 1003.92] and that's the key because we can go to
[1002.12 - 1006.08] the dentist we can brush our teeth but
[1003.92 - 1009.38] why are they still falling apart
[1006.08 - 1010.94] right for so many people so and I've
[1009.38 - 1012.56] always said it right teeth are like time
[1010.94 - 1016.34] capsules right they fall apart they
[1012.56 - 1019.64] crumble from within years later
[1016.34 - 1021.32] and we don't know why but they do and
[1019.64 - 1023.18] then if you're trying something new and
[1021.32 - 1024.98] then and your teeth happen to be falling
[1023.18 - 1026.48] apart in that moment when you're trying
[1024.98 - 1027.98] something new you think it was because
[1026.48 - 1030.86] of what you were doing right there in
[1027.98 - 1032.96] that moment Meanwhile your teeth were on
[1030.86 - 1035.60] the trajectory of falling apart they
[1032.96 - 1038.00] were already on they were on that
[1035.60 - 1040.76] trajectory of falling apart it's all
[1038.00 - 1041.90] about timing when do they fall apart do
[1040.76 - 1043.10] they fall apart when you're taking a
[1041.90 - 1045.02] trip one day and you're going to think
[1043.10 - 1046.82] that trip did it are they falling apart
[1045.02 - 1048.20] when you went swimming that day next
[1046.82 - 1049.82] thing you know next you know that week
[1048.20 - 1051.44] it's like oh why am I having a tooth
[1049.82 - 1052.70] problem now I gotta go to a dentist was
[1051.44 - 1055.58] it because I went swimming that week
[1052.70 - 1057.08] it's all about timing did it fall apart
[1055.58 - 1059.54] because you tried a new diet that week
[1057.08 - 1062.42] right it just doesn't happen that quick
[1059.54 - 1065.06] right but it falls apart as we're doing
[1062.42 - 1068.06] stuff we're doing stuff for years we're
[1065.06 - 1070.34] doing coffee we're doing vinegar you can
[1068.06 - 1073.52] talk to like virtually anybody in health
[1070.34 - 1074.96] okay except for maybe like a lot of the
[1073.52 - 1077.36] medical medium Community but you can
[1074.96 - 1079.70] talk to virtually anybody in health and
[1077.36 - 1082.16] there's the leading vinegar heck they're
[1079.70 - 1083.90] taking vinegar shots not they're doing
[1082.16 - 1086.72] vinegar gummies
[1083.90 - 1088.82] with people in health are doing vinegar
[1086.72 - 1090.92] all the time but it's like whoa that's a
[1088.82 - 1092.66] way to kill your teeth real bad Joe
[1090.92 - 1094.70] Anderson says I recently heard an
[1092.66 - 1096.50] influencer talking about waiting to
[1094.70 - 1099.80] brush your teeth after you have a
[1096.50 - 1102.14] smoothie or after you eat fruit
[1099.80 - 1104.00] yeah well that that makes perfect sense
[1102.14 - 1106.46] as far as for an influencer to say that
[1104.00 - 1108.98] then missing that's misinformation but
[1106.46 - 1110.66] exactly that influencer thought fruit
[1108.98 - 1113.18] sugar was going to destroy your teeth
[1110.66 - 1115.52] now think about that message right now
[1113.18 - 1117.92] if I was to hear that and I was somebody
[1115.52 - 1120.50] a follower to this influencer
[1117.92 - 1123.56] and I heard that and they were like so
[1120.50 - 1126.74] yeah what I like to do is after I have
[1123.56 - 1129.20] my smoothie I then well after I had my
[1126.74 - 1131.18] piece of fruit here's a mango right here
[1129.20 - 1134.54] after I have my piece of fruit everybody
[1131.18 - 1137.48] what I do is I brush my teeth afterwards
[1134.54 - 1139.82] okay so make sure fruit scares the [ __ ]
[1137.48 - 1141.56] out all you because you know what you're
[1139.82 - 1143.66] gonna all lose your teeth that's why I'm
[1141.56 - 1147.56] brushing my teeth after I have my fruit
[1143.66 - 1149.54] you guys so yeah like make sure I scare
[1147.56 - 1151.64] you to death about eating fruit oh I'm
[1149.54 - 1153.56] having my fruit I'm having my smoothie
[1151.64 - 1155.54] but I gotta brush my teeth after because
[1153.56 - 1157.52] you're gonna lose your teeth my dentist
[1155.54 - 1160.52] told me I'm gonna lose all my teeth
[1157.52 - 1162.32] because after my fruit smoothie I better
[1160.52 - 1165.74] brush my teeth right
[1162.32 - 1167.90] so so yeah I mean exactly right so
[1165.74 - 1169.64] that's that's how it works
[1167.90 - 1171.08] so then people are gonna be scared
[1169.64 - 1173.18] that's what they're gonna be that's what
[1171.08 - 1175.04] they're going to be scared of right
[1173.18 - 1177.44] but you want to wait to brush your teeth
[1175.04 - 1179.00] you want to wait to brush your teeth at
[1177.44 - 1181.04] different times you don't have to like
[1179.00 - 1182.84] you don't have to worry about that point
[1181.04 - 1185.00] that doesn't make a set make sense but
[1182.84 - 1186.68] if you have chocolate
[1185.00 - 1188.72] you might want to brush your teeth after
[1186.68 - 1191.00] you had all that chocolate right so
[1188.72 - 1194.48] they're going to worry about fruit
[1191.00 - 1196.70] and fruit acids fruit acids are alkaline
[1194.48 - 1199.52] fruit acids don't hurt teeth
[1196.70 - 1201.74] fruit assets actually kill bad bacteria
[1199.52 - 1203.90] in your mouth but they'll go and eat
[1201.74 - 1205.76] chocolate they'll have a chocolate bar
[1203.90 - 1208.40] and not brush their teeth afterwards
[1205.76 - 1209.60] right that's the time if you want to
[1208.40 - 1210.92] brush your teeth and you're worried
[1209.60 - 1213.44] about something you brush them after
[1210.92 - 1216.14] coffee and chocolate right
[1213.44 - 1218.18] and um
[1216.14 - 1220.28] so yeah so the thing is they they're
[1218.18 - 1222.02] trying to brush their teeth after they
[1220.28 - 1223.82] eat fruit because they think they're
[1222.02 - 1225.20] worried about acid from the fruit and
[1223.82 - 1227.60] fruit sugar and they're thinking they're
[1225.20 - 1230.30] worried about both that right so people
[1227.60 - 1232.46] always worry oh is fruit acidic it's not
[1230.30 - 1234.68] it's actually alkaline it helps somebody
[1232.46 - 1238.10] is what it does it helps you it's
[1234.68 - 1240.32] alkaline when fruit hits the digestive
[1238.10 - 1243.08] system it actually enters the mouth like
[1240.32 - 1244.94] lemon water it's instantly alkaline Deb
[1243.08 - 1247.04] says I don't use vinegar that's amazing
[1244.94 - 1250.04] Deb that's so good
[1247.04 - 1251.72] so many people use vinegar and don't
[1250.04 - 1254.36] even know it I'm glad you know that you
[1251.72 - 1257.00] don't right and that's key but vinegar
[1254.36 - 1258.68] is hidden Deb make sure you figure that
[1257.00 - 1260.42] out now you might not actually use
[1258.68 - 1262.28] vinegar where you open up the vinegar
[1260.42 - 1264.50] bottle and you're pouring it on
[1262.28 - 1267.02] something you might not be using it that
[1264.50 - 1268.40] way but is it any condiments in there is
[1267.02 - 1271.10] it is it in something like that the
[1268.40 - 1272.90] refrigerator is it in your Salsas is it
[1271.10 - 1274.34] in some salty head at a restaurant did
[1272.90 - 1276.20] you have a salad dressing at a
[1274.34 - 1278.42] restaurant did you have like anything
[1276.20 - 1281.00] like that is there's packaged food with
[1278.42 - 1282.92] dehydrated vinegar on it I saw kale
[1281.00 - 1284.84] chips out there with dehydrated vinegar
[1282.92 - 1286.64] in it right like it's all that stuff
[1284.84 - 1288.92] it's hidden everywhere so you got to
[1286.64 - 1290.72] kind of look out for it right Misty
[1288.92 - 1293.66] Lewis says yeah before my dentist told
[1290.72 - 1295.46] me to stop my lemons and fruits so I
[1293.66 - 1297.62] just don't tell him anymore laugh out
[1295.46 - 1299.54] loud that I already restarted it at Full
[1297.62 - 1300.98] Speed Ahead well that's what they do the
[1299.54 - 1303.74] dentist will tell you to stay away from
[1300.98 - 1305.96] your lemons stay away from your fruit is
[1303.74 - 1307.70] wilted too but what the dentist doesn't
[1305.96 - 1311.06] tell you right
[1307.70 - 1314.30] is that all these patients the dentist
[1311.06 - 1316.64] has that are losing their teeth getting
[1314.30 - 1318.26] all the dental work done all the
[1316.64 - 1321.14] fillings and everything else they
[1318.26 - 1324.20] weren't using lemons as a primary diet
[1321.14 - 1326.60] Source they weren't using fruit as a
[1324.20 - 1327.92] primary diet source so if you go into a
[1326.60 - 1330.08] dentist office and you sit in the
[1327.92 - 1334.88] waiting room and you're like hey
[1330.08 - 1337.70] uh yo yo um hi uh yeah you know my name

[1353.54 - 1359.06] place to listen to it check it out there
[1355.82 - 1360.08] right new episode third episode of the
[1359.06 - 1362.48] season

[1362.48 - 1366.86] supplements second episode on Lemon
[1364.46 - 1370.16] Water you've got to make sure you listen
[1366.86 - 1372.08] to the lemon water episode and then of
[1370.16 - 1374.30] course listen to the teeth episode 2

[1375.98 - 1380.48] hope people have great dentists so
[1377.98 - 1384.20] mineral deficiencies I talk about that
[1380.48 - 1387.20] during this episode inherited toxins and
[1384.20 - 1390.80] poisons from the family line so we pass
[1387.20 - 1393.62] on poisons and toxins like DDT
[1390.80 - 1396.50] down the family line toxic heavy metals
[1393.62 - 1399.62] right so it's more than just food
[1396.50 - 1401.30] that's why someone right someone's
[1399.62 - 1403.22] eating a certain way but they don't have
[1401.30 - 1404.66] any cavities somebody else is eating the
[1403.22 - 1407.36] same way but they have a lot of cavities
[1404.66 - 1410.24] because we have lowered immune systems
[1407.36 - 1412.58] that's a key right there bad bacteria
[1410.24 - 1415.04] right in our body that's another key
[1412.58 - 1417.74] there low-grade viral infections mineral
[1415.04 - 1419.48] deficiencies heavy metals Mercury is a
[1417.74 - 1420.98] big one if someone's high in mercury
[1419.48 - 1422.36] they're going to have more teeth
[1420.98 - 1425.66] problems and I'm not even talking about
[1422.36 - 1428.12] amalgams so you guys I also talk about
[1425.66 - 1430.10] amalgams in this episode so if any of
[1428.12 - 1432.68] you guys have mercury fillings
[1430.10 - 1435.74] silver filling still in your mouth you
[1432.68 - 1437.90] might want to hear this right
[1435.74 - 1439.28] um Nance says I think my teeth issues
[1437.90 - 1442.28] were from doing the vinegar every
[1439.28 - 1446.00] morning for years and years diet crap
[1442.28 - 1449.30] Etc now I drink lemon water incredible
[1446.00 - 1452.12] see the vinegar do so much damage for so
[1449.30 - 1455.06] many years for people and when people
[1452.12 - 1457.28] think they can use a straw and that
[1455.06 - 1460.58] that's all they need is a straw
[1457.28 - 1462.92] and then just bypass your teeth it
[1460.58 - 1465.62] doesn't work they're misinformed because
[1462.92 - 1469.10] it's the vinegar entering into the body
[1465.62 - 1471.50] itself the body then has a reaction to
[1469.10 - 1473.60] the vinegar what the body does
[1471.50 - 1475.94] is the body has to neutralize the
[1473.60 - 1479.30] vinegar to acidic
[1475.94 - 1482.24] so acidic the body can go into acidosis
[1479.30 - 1484.52] so to stop the human body somebody's
[1482.24 - 1486.92] body from going into acidosis it has to
[1484.52 - 1488.12] release calcium from your teeth and
[1486.92 - 1491.60] bones
[1488.12 - 1493.82] so the only way to protect yourself when
[1491.60 - 1495.86] you're drinking vinegar taking a vinegar
[1493.82 - 1498.86] shot apple cider vinegar in your cooking
[1495.86 - 1500.12] in a sauce in a dressing the only way to
[1498.86 - 1503.12] protect yourself
[1500.12 - 1504.92] from the damaging effects of vinegar
[1503.12 - 1507.56] is your body
[1504.92 - 1509.90] actually taking calcium from your bones
[1507.56 - 1512.30] and teeth to neutralize the acid so you
[1509.90 - 1514.40] don't get acidosis and your kidneys
[1512.30 - 1517.22] don't start going downhill
[1514.40 - 1519.80] so important to know Carrie
[1517.22 - 1521.66] says my teeth and gums have got much
[1519.80 - 1523.46] better since shrinking lemon water and
[1521.66 - 1526.34] celery juice thank you isn't that
[1523.46 - 1528.08] amazing lemon water like that's
[1526.34 - 1530.54] incredible right
[1528.08 - 1533.06] and you know what you can do lemon water
[1530.54 - 1535.10] and you can do limes too so I got some
[1533.06 - 1536.96] limes and lemons right here Maria
[1535.10 - 1538.82] actually says a lot of functional
[1536.96 - 1540.50] doctors still pushing apple cider
[1538.82 - 1542.84] vinegar to help with low acid and
[1540.50 - 1545.06] stomach Dear God
[1542.84 - 1546.74] would apple cider vinegar does I've
[1545.06 - 1547.88] talked about this for years is it
[1546.74 - 1549.92] destroys
[1547.88 - 1553.28] your gastric glands
[1549.92 - 1556.52] so the very HCL producers think about
[1553.28 - 1560.06] this inside your stomach are gastric
[1556.52 - 1563.12] glands they produce HCL
[1560.06 - 1565.76] that HCL is your good asset
[1563.12 - 1567.02] so if a functional medicine Doctor is
[1565.76 - 1569.42] recommending
[1567.02 - 1572.20] vinegar apple cider vinegar
[1569.42 - 1575.36] for an acid stomach what they're doing
[1572.20 - 1577.64] is they're helping to destroy and
[1575.36 - 1579.62] basically fry out the gastric gland so
[1577.64 - 1582.14] you can't produce as much hydrochloric
[1579.62 - 1585.20] acid to save your butt they actually it
[1582.14 - 1586.58] works backwards it doesn't help but
[1585.20 - 1589.16] that's how it works in alternative
[1586.58 - 1590.54] medicine right you just you just try
[1589.16 - 1592.94] different things and been there done
[1590.54 - 1595.46] that try things and not all acids are
[1592.94 - 1596.74] the same you guys it's not the same
[1595.46 - 1600.08] thing
[1596.74 - 1603.74] bacteria like streptococcus inside your
[1600.08 - 1608.48] gut produces a different kind of acid
[1603.74 - 1610.46] a bad acid right that bad acid is
[1608.48 - 1614.00] different than your hydrochloric acid
[1610.46 - 1617.06] your good acid in your stomach two
[1614.00 - 1618.50] different kinds of acids really
[1617.06 - 1621.86] important to know
[1618.50 - 1626.36] so this acid
[1621.86 - 1628.34] is not a remedy for either one for
[1626.36 - 1630.98] somebody who has low HCL or someone who
[1628.34 - 1633.02] has bacteria in their stomach so that's
[1630.98 - 1635.60] critical to know are bacteria inside
[1633.02 - 1636.98] their intestinal tract so and that's why
[1635.60 - 1639.44] a lot of people they have so many
[1636.98 - 1641.42] problems but what is guaranteed when you
[1639.44 - 1643.22] do the vinegar route
[1641.42 - 1644.90] you're going to have teeth problems down
[1643.22 - 1647.18] the road unless you do something to turn
[1644.90 - 1648.46] it around right
[1647.18 - 1652.54] yeah
[1648.46 - 1652.54] and all that's important
[1653.18 - 1658.82] so anyway Jennifer says he's having a
[1655.70 - 1661.10] hard time being taken hard time wait
[1658.82 - 1663.32] he's having a hard enough time being
[1661.10 - 1666.86] taken seriously he can't afford to be
[1663.32 - 1669.02] funny at this point well Jennifer I try
[1666.86 - 1671.54] my best you know I'm only human I'm
[1669.02 - 1674.06] trying to deliver information so it's
[1671.54 - 1675.74] entertaining as well and I like having a
[1674.06 - 1679.16] little bit of fun because I spent 35
[1675.74 - 1681.86] years helping people rise out of the
[1679.16 - 1684.38] ashes from the depths of hell and back
[1681.86 - 1686.78] to get their lives back people who were
[1684.38 - 1688.76] bedridden couldn't even walk or take a
[1686.78 - 1690.98] shower people who needed to get out of
[1688.76 - 1694.34] their wheelchairs been helping doctors
[1690.98 - 1698.00] all these years and I'm not like seeking
[1694.34 - 1701.60] credibility I want people better and
[1698.00 - 1703.34] healing keeping a light heart Joy a
[1701.60 - 1706.70] little bit of humor can help people who
[1703.34 - 1710.06] are actually on mattress Island right so
[1706.70 - 1712.64] it's to keep a light heart and so that's
[1710.06 - 1714.74] that's the whole thing right and the
[1712.64 - 1717.38] skits I do are actually things that
[1714.74 - 1719.66] happen so the skits I do Jennifer this
[1717.38 - 1722.48] is important to know the schizo View
[1719.66 - 1723.80] there's truth in the skits keep that in
[1722.48 - 1725.84] mind right
[1723.80 - 1727.58] so when I talk about different things in
[1725.84 - 1729.56] all these skits if you look back at all
[1727.58 - 1731.30] my comedy skits right
[1729.56 - 1733.28] and the parodies and everything I do
[1731.30 - 1734.54] you'll see there's something to learn
[1733.28 - 1736.52] from it
[1734.54 - 1739.88] and that's important the other thing is
[1736.52 - 1741.92] if you're sick and you're bedridden or a
[1739.88 - 1744.32] mattress island or couch Island and
[1741.92 - 1746.84] you've had like a reduced quality of
[1744.32 - 1749.30] life because of it you can't work you
[1746.84 - 1751.88] can't exercise a light heart and a
[1749.30 - 1753.08] little Joy is always a good thing and I
[1751.88 - 1754.94] have to think about people who are
[1753.08 - 1758.24] chronically ill there's people out there
[1754.94 - 1761.24] chronically sick and they can use like a
[1758.24 - 1763.76] giggle it's so important Jamie says fun

[1982.10 - 1987.08] unable to work and had multiple
[1984.38 - 1990.20] treatments shoved down their throat from

[2009.52 - 2015.34] fun yay you guys are incredible so
[2013.60 - 2017.32] when it comes down to teeth I just want
[2015.34 - 2019.44] to drop a few things on you guys real
[2017.32 - 2022.06] quick here right
[2019.44 - 2024.82] the reason why like medical medium
[2022.06 - 2026.44] information uses like leafy greens
[2024.82 - 2028.30] and I know everybody gets all burned up
[2026.44 - 2031.00] about this but the health movement
[2028.30 - 2033.64] wasn't about leafy greens years ago okay
[2031.00 - 2035.56] and I was always leafy greens eat a
[2033.64 - 2036.88] pound of spinach spinach soup medical
[2035.56 - 2038.50] medium spinach soup and people like
[2036.88 - 2040.36] iceberg lettuce
[2038.50 - 2043.72] Professionals in the health field 25
[2040.36 - 2045.94] years ago okay 30 years ago were like
[2043.72 - 2048.34] iceberg lettuce was it when you said
[2045.94 - 2050.50] lettuce or a salad right I was like no
[2048.34 - 2051.88] you've got to have your kale Your
[2050.50 - 2053.92] Spinach you've got to have your
[2051.88 - 2055.60] different lettuces your wild lettuces
[2053.92 - 2057.94] you have to have all the heirloom
[2055.60 - 2060.58] lettuces you have to have you know all
[2057.94 - 2063.34] of it your mosh like all the different
[2060.58 - 2065.34] grits arugula is critical that's where
[2063.34 - 2068.74] you get those alkaline
[2065.34 - 2070.06] alkaline trace minerals to buffer the
[2068.74 - 2072.10] acidity
[2070.06 - 2074.38] teeth all fall apart
[2072.10 - 2075.88] because we're so acidic in Mineral
[2074.38 - 2077.80] deficient
[2075.88 - 2079.84] that our immune system can't even
[2077.80 - 2082.24] protect our mouth
[2079.84 - 2085.00] to stop gum disease
[2082.24 - 2087.94] and to stop bacteria from eating away
[2085.00 - 2089.68] our teeth right there's people they go
[2087.94 - 2092.08] to the dentist they get their teeth
[2089.68 - 2093.70] cleaned they got their teeth all taken
[2092.08 - 2095.32] care of constantly they're seeing their
[2093.70 - 2097.36] dentist once a month well every two
[2095.32 - 2099.82] months they're brushing they're flossing
[2097.36 - 2101.44] and their teeth are just totally shot
[2099.82 - 2104.98] right
[2101.44 - 2107.08] because it's healing deep inside we're
[2104.98 - 2108.82] talking about Yvette Hopkins says love
[2107.08 - 2110.92] your humor honor thank you for being
[2108.82 - 2112.06] here by the way I'm honored you're here
[2110.92 - 2116.20] truly
[2112.06 - 2118.42] I am indeed honored I'm energy here
[2116.20 - 2119.92] this is a glass of wine it's a thousand
[2118.42 - 2123.16] dollars a glass
[2119.92 - 2125.98] I think that's quite the right price
[2123.16 - 2129.82] I'm I'm in Napa Valley
[2125.98 - 2132.70] this wine is 52 000 a glass
[2129.82 - 2135.04] and go by the vineyard
[2132.70 - 2136.36] honored you guys are here
[2135.04 - 2138.82] all right
[2136.36 - 2141.46] when we do lives later in the day I
[2138.82 - 2143.38] think the humor comes out more if we
[2141.46 - 2145.18] were doing alive and it was like one
[2143.38 - 2147.70] o'clock in the morning I think it would
[2145.18 - 2149.50] be probably the craziest live you've
[2147.70 - 2151.90] ever seen so
[2149.50 - 2154.00] thank God we don't do lives at 1am
[2151.90 - 2156.34] because I think you got I think I would
[2154.00 - 2158.62] all probably lose all you guys like what
[2156.34 - 2161.02] is he saying now
[2158.62 - 2163.12] Denise is so lemon water is key to our
[2161.02 - 2164.14] oral health yes it is Denise it's really
[2163.12 - 2166.42] important
[2164.14 - 2170.08] lemon water
[2166.42 - 2172.54] it's about calcium so just look
[2170.08 - 2176.26] the calcium in lemons a whole nother
[2172.54 - 2177.64] ball game okay calcium and lemon whole
[2176.26 - 2179.14] nother ball game I'm going to tell you
[2177.64 - 2181.12] right now
[2179.14 - 2184.72] that's the calcium that goes into the
[2181.12 - 2186.70] teeth it's this right here okay very
[2184.72 - 2188.98] important calcium and leafy greens too
[2186.70 - 2191.38] but especially like the lemons
[2188.98 - 2193.66] so we're getting that calcium and we're
[2191.38 - 2197.08] neutralizing acid
[2193.66 - 2200.80] so a lemon which seems sour and acidic
[2197.08 - 2202.60] right you think it's hurting your teeth
[2200.80 - 2205.06] but what it's doing it's making your
[2202.60 - 2209.26] body alkaline so you can save your teeth
[2205.06 - 2211.78] that's how it works critical

[2231.16 - 2235.84] time put a tiny drop
[2232.66 - 2239.32] Carolina a doctor told my sister to
[2235.84 - 2241.90] drink red wine because she is anemic
[2239.32 - 2245.08] dear Lord
[2241.90 - 2246.58] terrible I mean listen to the doctor of
[2245.08 - 2248.44] course doc doctor's always right listen
[2246.58 - 2250.66] to your doctors I I want you guys to
[2248.44 - 2252.52] listen to your doctors but man I would

[2252.52 - 2257.32] or a family member
[2255.16 - 2259.00] um that's you know it's that's that's
[2257.32 - 2261.82] the whole point that's why my advice is
[2259.00 - 2264.40] in the skits it's in the wine skits I
[2261.82 - 2266.56] think you'll have some red wine I think

[2266.56 - 2270.94] I'm gonna have a bottle of red wine
[2268.84 - 2274.96] tonight I think it's gonna help my
[2270.94 - 2274.96] anemia quite right yeah
[2276.36 - 2280.24] Liza
[2278.08 - 2282.16] Alicia sorry what's the difference in
[2280.24 - 2285.64] eating alkaline foods versus drinking
[2282.16 - 2288.52] alkaline water let's go into that now
[2285.64 - 2292.48] if it's spring water
[2288.52 - 2295.84] that's naturally alkaline amazing
[2292.48 - 2297.22] if it's the alkaline ionizer water
[2295.84 - 2299.62] machines
[2297.22 - 2303.88] run for your life
[2299.62 - 2307.00] run for your life okay
[2303.88 - 2310.78] alkaline ionizer water machines
[2307.00 - 2313.54] I can't say enough things about why not
[2310.78 - 2315.52] to do that right I've talked about it
[2313.54 - 2318.58] I've been hammered by the alkaline
[2315.52 - 2321.70] ionizer water uh Ponzi scheme pyramid
[2318.58 - 2323.50] schemers out there I've seen it I've but
[2321.70 - 2325.84] I've seen what it's done to people over
[2323.50 - 2328.36] the years the plates rust and nobody
[2325.84 - 2331.06] sees it you get particles of metal it's
[2328.36 - 2332.88] a scary as crap so yeah anyway that's
[2331.06 - 2336.28] different than natural occurring
[2332.88 - 2338.80] alkaline water much different than that
[2336.28 - 2341.08] it's a whole other story
[2338.80 - 2343.36] yep our roses alkaline water is terrible
[2341.08 - 2345.64] full of heavy metals yes indeed meaning
[2343.36 - 2348.00] like the machines the ones that produce
[2345.64 - 2351.16] it like like alter the water
[2348.00 - 2354.22] Frankenstein the water that's terrifying
[2351.16 - 2357.12] actually just so you know terrifying so
[2354.22 - 2357.12] that's important to know
[2357.46 - 2363.40] helps with Liz what you're live again

[2467.50 - 2472.66] there ain't gonna be any copies to go
[2469.60 - 2474.94] around once the book's released soon so
[2472.66 - 2476.62] pretty soon it's going to be released if
[2474.94 - 2478.96] you don't have your pre-ordered brain
[2476.62 - 2479.92] saver books both the protocol and brain
[2478.96 - 2482.38] saver
[2479.92 - 2486.40] he may not get it for a long time okay
[2482.38 - 2489.16] anyway and the and amazon.com right now
[2486.40 - 2491.44] that's where they are brain saver and
[2489.16 - 2493.60] brand saver protocols two books at the
[2491.44 - 2495.28] same time I was told I was the only
[2493.60 - 2498.04] author that did two books at the same
[2495.28 - 2500.38] time in this on this on this scale they
[2498.04 - 2502.72] said you just always break the rules
[2500.38 - 2505.54] Sue Goldberg says why do children's
[2502.72 - 2509.64] teeth sometimes come in and I just enter
[2505.54 - 2513.00] discolored slightly hello because of
[2509.64 - 2515.38] deficiencies deficiencies from the past
[2513.00 - 2519.28] toxins that are passed down from Mom and
[2515.38 - 2524.02] Dad yes both the husband too or father
[2519.28 - 2526.42] and both the the mom both parents so the
[2524.02 - 2529.06] toxins are passed down things like DDT
[2526.42 - 2530.62] and different pesticides toxic heavy
[2529.06 - 2533.74] metals and usually with kids it's it's
[2530.62 - 2536.20] toxic heavy metals that are passed down
[2533.74 - 2538.42] if you guys don't have the brain saver
[2536.20 - 2540.64] books both of them there's two of them
[2538.42 - 2542.62] pre-ordered you might want to take a
[2540.64 - 2545.14] look at amazon.com look for brain saver
[2542.62 - 2547.90] look for both books there's two separate
[2545.14 - 2550.30] pages on Amazon
[2547.90 - 2553.18] Sean Paul says isn't isn't that just
[2550.30 - 2556.48] genetics passing down toxins
[2553.18 - 2558.34] uh no it's not genetics aren't passing
[2556.48 - 2560.98] down toxins
[2558.34 - 2565.06] um but we pass down toxins physically so
[2560.98 - 2567.22] yeah in utero sperm and egg toxins
[2565.06 - 2569.44] that's how it's done
[2567.22 - 2571.36] yep
[2569.44 - 2573.22] so pretty cool you guys I'm glad you
[2571.36 - 2575.20] mentioned the books I know I haven't
[2573.22 - 2577.06] been talking about the brain saver books
[2575.20 - 2578.92] but I want to it's just that I wanted to
[2577.06 - 2582.10] get the podcast up and running the
[2578.92 - 2584.50] season right look they want to blame
[2582.10 - 2586.66] everything on genetics that's how they
[2584.50 - 2590.80] do it because it's an easy sell right
[2586.66 - 2594.40] such an easy sell if you look like
[2590.80 - 2597.34] your parents or look like your relatives
[2594.40 - 2600.22] then it's like an easy sell it's got to
[2597.34 - 2602.08] be genes everything's genes right but we
[2600.22 - 2605.44] passed down generation after generation
[2602.08 - 2607.42] viruses Epstein-Barr toxic heavy metals
[2605.44 - 2609.64] different viruses different pathogens
[2607.42 - 2612.52] right
[2609.64 - 2614.74] so and we're and all this is passed down
[2612.52 - 2616.90] from generation to generation sometimes
[2614.74 - 2619.36] a family can be exposed to all the same
[2616.90 - 2621.22] stuff so they all get sick with similar
[2619.36 - 2623.38] things as time goes on because they were
[2621.22 - 2624.70] exposed to all these different things
[2623.38 - 2627.88] right
[2624.70 - 2630.76] so that's important to know
[2627.88 - 2632.62] so yeah anyway you guys you guys know I
[2630.76 - 2635.14] care about you greatly I'm gonna have my
[2632.62 - 2637.48] bowl of sugar if you don't mind because
[2635.14 - 2639.16] what I do is you guys I'll tell you how
[2637.48 - 2641.74] the medical media meets okay he doesn't
[2639.16 - 2644.56] eat all this all right medical medium
[2641.74 - 2646.78] eats a whole giant bowl of brown sugar
[2644.56 - 2649.54] six times a day
[2646.78 - 2651.28] I don't I'm only kidding I don't and
[2649.54 - 2653.20] neither does anybody else
[2651.28 - 2654.70] but what people do
[2653.20 - 2658.00] is they
[2654.70 - 2661.00] all the fats and the additives and the
[2658.00 - 2664.18] chemicals with the sugar and it's all
[2661.00 - 2665.50] that acidic fat and everything else you
[2664.18 - 2666.76] can be a healthy vegan person like
[2665.50 - 2669.16] you're into health and you're like hey
[2666.76 - 2672.40] I'm vegan I'm into health I'm doing my
[2669.16 - 2674.26] nut proteins I'm doing keto vegan I got
[2672.40 - 2676.18] no processed foods and your teeth can
[2674.26 - 2677.38] still fall out and guess what the
[2676.18 - 2678.94] dentist would be like it was because
[2677.38 - 2680.68] you're vegan it wasn't because you're
[2678.94 - 2682.90] vegan it's because everybody's focused
[2680.68 - 2684.16] on too many fats too many proteins and
[2682.90 - 2686.26] they have too many deficiencies and
[2684.16 - 2688.48] they're not fixing them and they're not
[2686.26 - 2690.46] getting those alkaline minerals in
[2688.48 - 2692.56] they're not getting the celery juice in
[2690.46 - 2694.24] they're not getting heavy metal detox
[2692.56 - 2696.16] smoothie in they're not getting the
[2694.24 - 2697.66] stuff in they need they're not getting
[2696.16 - 2699.10] the chemicals and the metals and the
[2697.66 - 2701.86] pathogens out of their body they could
[2699.10 - 2703.78] be a vegan a vegan dude a vegan gal
[2701.86 - 2705.76] whatever and boom they're sick now
[2703.78 - 2708.16] they're 32 years old and they're getting

[2716.74 - 2721.12] cavities on my upper teeth I told them
[2719.20 - 2722.20] to wait two months before I get the
[2721.12 - 2724.42] X-ray
[2722.20 - 2726.52] for two months every time I drank my
[2724.42 - 2728.62] celery juice I held it in my mouth for a
[2726.52 - 2731.02] while which is an incredible
[2728.62 - 2734.44] um piece of information and them we love
[2731.02 - 2736.36] that when I got my x-ray it didn't show
[2734.44 - 2737.86] the cavities he mentioned from two

[2799.30 - 2802.72] new podcast episode next week and you
[2801.52 - 2804.46] got to get ready for the ride because
[2802.72 - 2806.92] that's going to be an insane One Cloud
[2804.46 - 2809.26] swoop says my son gets canker sores from
[2806.92 - 2811.24] oranges any ideas
[2809.26 - 2814.42] when I've noticed what happens is that
[2811.24 - 2815.56] okay if you have the canker sore virus
[2814.42 - 2818.14] right
[2815.56 - 2820.84] it doesn't like to be killed off
[2818.14 - 2823.72] so it doesn't like to be killed off and
[2820.84 - 2825.64] fruit will start killing off canker sore
[2823.72 - 2827.50] virus canker sore viruses is in the
[2825.64 - 2829.84] herpetic family right that means it's
[2827.50 - 2831.04] already in your mouth okay so what I
[2829.84 - 2833.68] would do
[2831.04 - 2835.24] is um you can ask your doctor but would
[2833.68 - 2836.86] I would I tell friends all the time
[2835.24 - 2839.92] right
[2836.86 - 2842.50] is um is a couple of things celery juice
[2839.92 - 2845.62] is critical because it kills off as well
[2842.50 - 2847.66] all right another thing it's like what I
[2845.62 - 2849.04] would tell a friend is they're gluten in
[2847.66 - 2850.90] the diet
[2849.04 - 2853.78] because if there's gluten in the diet
[2850.90 - 2855.88] then the canker sores could happen no
[2853.78 - 2857.02] matter what and then if you are eating
[2855.88 - 2858.88] an orange
[2857.02 - 2860.02] you think it's the orange if you are
[2858.88 - 2862.30] eating a banana and you think it's a
[2860.02 - 2864.16] banana if you are eating
[2862.30 - 2865.60] avocado you think it's an avocado but
[2864.16 - 2867.46] the point is is there gluten in the diet
[2865.60 - 2869.26] ever is there dairy in the diet ever
[2867.46 - 2871.54] this is what I ask friends
[2869.26 - 2875.08] when their kids have canker sores is
[2871.54 - 2880.36] their gluten dairy corn corn gluten
[2875.08 - 2881.92] dairy soy milk cheese butter eggs if any
[2880.36 - 2883.54] of that's in the diet it feeds the
[2881.92 - 2885.94] canker sore virus the repetitive canker
[2883.54 - 2887.50] sore virus so it's a crap shoot whatever
[2885.94 - 2888.82] you're eating it's just gonna break out
[2887.50 - 2890.62] when it's going to break out that's what
[2888.82 - 2892.72] I tell a lot of doctor friends and also
[2890.62 - 2896.08] friends and family members
[2892.72 - 2898.18] so yeah anyway you guys listen
[2896.08 - 2900.16] keep a light heart know that I care I'm
