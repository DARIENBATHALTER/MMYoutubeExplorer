[3.48 - 9.52] uncovered a plot by a group of Rivals to
[7.40 - 13.32] take down medical medium and our
[9.52 - 17.96] community to be safe she chose to record
[13.32 - 21.08] the calls legally and they were caught
[17.96 - 23.44] red-handed we're talking about the plot
[21.08 - 25.96] a group of Rivals planned in a
[23.44 - 30.04] premeditative way to take down medical
[25.96 - 33.48] medium and the community make it go away
[30.04 - 34.68] take it all down but they got caught
[33.48 - 37.88] caught
[34.68 - 41.40] red-handed they got found out if they
[37.88 - 43.88] didn't no one would be the wiser never
[41.40 - 45.84] before has this ever happened in a
[43.88 - 48.48] health and wellness space when you

[69.28 - 74.12] step one in this process there's no
[71.52 - 76.76] coming back from that when I just hear
[74.12 - 80.24] those again and the intentions behind
[76.76 - 81.96] them I mean you I'm still in shock first
[80.24 - 86.56] of all but you can feel the negative
[81.96 - 89.28] energy and the sense of their goals and
[86.56 - 90.72] the more recordings we hear the more is
[89.28 - 93.56] uncovered
[90.72 - 96.16] it's bone chilling back with me on the
[93.56 - 98.04] medical medium podcast is Amber vakaro

[103.76 - 109.72] to go through some more recordings that
[106.48 - 112.92] were obtained legally and of these
[109.72 - 115.00] Anonymous sources who are actually
[112.92 - 116.84] plotting the takedown of the medical
[115.00 - 120.36] medium and the medical medium community
[116.84 - 123.04] and when I say that I mean I mean I I
[120.36 - 125.20] just can't believe what they were doing
[123.04 - 126.84] but the facts are there the
[125.20 - 129.16] information's there and the recordings
[126.84 - 131.64] are there
[129.16 - 133.64] undeniable and it's just it's just
[131.64 - 136.88] unbelievable for the people who haven't
[133.64 - 139.08] heard the last episode if you can and
[136.88 - 144.28] you have a moment try to catch up and
[139.08 - 147.16] listen to 35 episode 35 part one plot to
[144.28 - 149.24] take down the medical medium Amber first
[147.16 - 152.48] can you give us a little recap on some
[149.24 - 156.48] of your re recordings from the last
[152.48 - 159.20] episode of course in part one we talked
[156.48 - 162.24] about how there was an attempt to
[159.20 - 164.16] indoctrinate me into a group a group of
[162.24 - 166.12] people with health and wellness
[164.16 - 169.28] businesses that have plotted a
[166.12 - 171.60] premeditated plan to go to a journalist
[169.28 - 174.52] at a mainstream media outlet with a
[171.60 - 177.00] manipulated story that would if all went
[174.52 - 179.56] according to their plan caused so much
[177.00 - 182.08] upset that the medical medium Community
[179.56 - 183.76] would would all come crashing down and
[182.08 - 187.00] in the process they're exploiting a
[183.76 - 188.72] deceased person shaping a story that
[187.00 - 192.44] they want to the way that they want to
[188.72 - 194.72] spin it leaving out facts and content
[192.44 - 197.40] cherry-picking evidence that suits a
[194.72 - 199.36] preferred narrative with a plan of
[197.40 - 202.48] publishing additional
[199.36 - 205.40] articles and ultimately to sell a
[202.48 - 207.88] negative documentary and how we talked
[205.40 - 210.48] about how I obtained legal recordings of
[207.88 - 212.84] these phone conversations
[210.48 - 215.28] versus like when the the movie came out
[212.84 - 218.16] or the do or the Netflix thing came out
[215.28 - 221.08] like this is this going to
[218.16 - 223.44] happen holy
[221.08 - 226.08]  there's going to be a documentary
[223.44 - 227.76] about it all that's our vision I mean
[226.08 - 230.56] it's not we first you have to publish
[227.76 - 232.84] the article and then once the article is
[230.56 - 235.76] published then people start bidding on
[232.84 - 240.32] the piece the intention and action I had
[235.76 - 242.64] is that it's going h a Netflix series
[240.32 - 245.56] like bad vegan will be made about
[242.64 - 248.32] Anthony and it will be a hit
[245.56 - 251.40] because what he pulled off is
[248.32 - 253.40] unbelievable I mean and the celebrity
[251.40 - 256.32] angle like this thing this Netflix
[253.40 - 258.28] version is gonna go boners I I connected
[256.32 - 260.84] him with a lot of people to it he really
[258.28 - 262.88] appreciated Ash and I and then just gave
[260.84 - 265.12] him a lot of direction for this piece we
[262.88 - 267.08] gave him a lot of clarity sort of like
[265.12 - 268.68] he he's having a hard time wrapping his
[267.08 - 271.08] head around a lot of it had to like
[268.68 - 273.68] really hammer his head like what's going
[271.08 - 275.64] on and like explain the details and
[273.68 - 280.56] point him towards this point him towards
[275.64 - 283.28] that but I I was upset I said like he
[280.56 - 285.72] you are scared you're scared like what's
[283.28 - 287.08] going on what's the delay like you you
[285.72 - 288.28] have everything it's on the
[287.08 - 290.44] phone like you have all this stuff like
[288.28 - 292.08] what more do you need and then I
[290.44 - 293.84] basically threaten I will definitely
[292.08 - 294.88] take responsibility for one I've been
[293.84 - 297.04] one of the people that's been pushing
[294.88 - 298.72] for this uh if you want to take the the
[297.04 - 302.24] list of people of why this article's
[298.72 - 305.48] coming out and why it's coming out in a
[302.24 - 307.64] um mainstream publication is number one
[305.48 - 310.40] Ash is the number one responsible I
[307.64 - 312.40] would be number two be number three
[310.40 - 314.52] would be number four it was us four who
[312.40 - 318.20] like decided this needs to
[314.52 - 323.36] happen so this is what this group of
[318.20 - 325.88] plotters did to sell a story to sell
[323.36 - 328.64] their narrative they had to hammer it
[325.88 - 330.00] into the head of a journalist Point him
[328.64 - 333.48] here and point him there
[330.00 - 335.84] and ultimately threaten him and today
[333.48 - 337.64] I'm going to unpack more of the content
[335.84 - 341.20] from the calls that I had with these
[337.64 - 342.88] plotters as part of the attempt that
[341.20 - 345.68] they had to recruit
[342.88 - 348.36] me that really speaks to a serious lack
[345.68 - 350.08] of credibility in each of them as
[348.36 - 353.88] sources
[350.08 - 356.48] and had given me seeds she planted seeds
[353.88 - 358.20] that I had not heard when I saw the
[356.48 - 359.64] documentary and then when I saw the
[358.20 - 360.96] documentary and I flipped that that's
[359.64 - 364.44] when I started collecting way more
[360.96 - 366.76] information I went back to I asked for
[364.44 - 368.76] more first of all I want to point out
[366.76 - 371.60] here that this plotter is stating in his
[368.76 - 374.32] own words that what ultimately turn what
[371.60 - 376.84] turned him against medical medium wasn't
[374.32 - 379.24] a story it wasn't a piece of information
[376.84 - 382.52] about a deceased person it was him
[379.24 - 385.88] watching a documentary that a co-plot
[382.52 - 389.60] husband helped to create which made him
[385.88 - 391.28] think to himself that could be Anthony
[389.60 - 394.08] that was his light bulb
[391.28 - 396.96] moment next he says he turned to a
[394.08 - 399.28] source that he deems as being reliable
[396.96 - 402.16] who made him so confident that medical
[399.28 - 405.08] medium was problematic that he became
[402.16 - 407.68] the number two instigator of this entire
[405.08 - 407.68] takedown
[409.40 - 415.44] plot Jes is like a CIA agent I mean this
[413.92 - 416.84] and she'll be happy to talk to you Amber
[415.44 - 419.56] you can talk to anybody you want in this
[416.84 - 423.20] story but she like went and found
[419.56 - 427.24] pictures of him in his high school
[423.20 - 427.24] yearbook can I hear that one
[428.80 - 434.60] again jokes is like a CIA agent I mean
[433.04 - 436.08] this and she'll be happy to talk to you
[434.60 - 439.00] am you can talk to anybody you want in
[436.08 - 442.88] this story but she like went and found
[439.00 - 445.36] pictures of him in his high school
[442.88 - 448.88] yearbook so that sounds like the
[445.36 - 451.00] plotters or are looking for anything
[448.88 - 453.24] they can find I guess they're in my
[451.00 - 456.56] yearbook looking for
[453.24 - 459.96] pictures and I heard CIA
[456.56 - 463.68] agent so I guess there must be something
[459.96 - 465.68] these plotters are doing so and when I
[463.68 - 471.12] even think back to the other Clips you
[465.68 - 474.72] you played for us there were four people
[471.12 - 477.84] they had like a ranking system so it was
[474.72 - 480.08] like 1 2 3
[477.84 - 481.04] 4 and
[480.08 - 486.92] they
[481.04 - 489.00] brought this plot to the media company I
[486.92 - 494.64] what it looks like too through all of
[489.00 - 497.48] that and it was inspired by a
[494.64 - 500.60] husband who actually does
[497.48 - 505.60] cinematography meaning that was
[500.60 - 508.24] involved and I'm just so blown away in a
[505.60 - 512.04] sense where I'm I'm actually in
[508.24 - 513.96] shock in shock so but really I was just
[512.04 - 517.76] a seeker of Truth like you
[513.96 - 519.32] are I just wanted to know the truth so I
[517.76 - 520.92] was surprised he talked to me on the
[519.32 - 523.08] phone and we talked for a good long time
[520.92 - 525.48] but one of the stories he told me I have
[523.08 - 527.04] no idea why I don't remember why our
[525.48 - 529.64] conversation went here but I think this
[527.04 - 533.68] is the underlying thing for Anthony all
[529.64 - 537.00] the time is that
[533.68 - 540.12] um I think in his childhood growing up
[537.00 - 545.64] in in Maine mhm and it's a it's a
[540.12 - 549.12] different world um especially back then
[545.64 - 551.28] um and he probably didn't fit in I think
[549.12 - 555.48] the kids picked on him a lot he was
[551.28 - 557.36] mentioning stuff that how the boys um
[555.48 - 561.04] when he was he had a little job after
[557.36 - 563.52] work after school like a little work job
[561.04 - 566.36] and he was walking home and they set up
[563.52 - 570.36] was winter time and they set up a a
[566.36 - 572.28] snow um trap I what to call it whereas
[570.36 - 574.36] when he walked by a certain spot they
[572.28 - 576.80] all bombarded him with
[574.36 - 578.76] snowballs and he's still telling the
[576.80 - 582.28] story to this day to
[578.76 - 583.72] me so apparently it hurt him a lot both
[582.28 - 585.64] physically and mentally I think he was
[583.72 - 587.60] like bloody and bleeding and you know
[585.64 - 588.68] you have to go home and explain to your
[587.60 - 592.64] mom
[588.68 - 594.36] why why you're all beat up but I think
[592.64 - 595.60] that was a common thing the kids were
[594.36 - 597.76] mean to him
[595.60 - 601.00] so
[597.76 - 603.92] um I don't know know maybe he snapped I
[601.00 - 606.04] don't know he just has this strong will
[603.92 - 608.84] to feel important that's what I say to
[606.04 - 611.92] kind of get back at everyone you know to
[608.84 - 614.64] be something really special so here we
[611.92 - 617.72] are again this is this is somebody who
[614.64 - 620.48] this group is relying on for so-called
[617.72 - 622.08] factual information that ultimately the
[620.48 - 624.64] journalist ends up relying on for
[622.08 - 626.36] factual information and and we have
[624.64 - 628.64] again the truth Seeker phrase truth
[626.36 - 631.40] Seeker truth seeker and I want to talk
[628.64 - 633.08] about this so-called truth Anthony is
[631.40 - 633.96] this is this a story that you shared
[633.08 - 637.08] with this
[633.96 - 641.24] woman I haven't experienced a childhood
[637.08 - 644.16] experience like that so I'm you know
[641.24 - 646.80] confused about that that seems like the
[644.16 - 649.20] story from the movie Elf where buddy and
[646.80 - 651.80] Michael were in Central Park and they
[649.20 - 655.68] got attacked by some kids and some
[651.80 - 660.16] bullies that's what it reminds me
[655.68 - 662.44] of ow son of a n
[660.16 - 665.44] [Music]
[662.44 - 665.44] cracker
[668.88 - 675.88] run and he's still telling the story to
[671.84 - 677.20] this day to me so if I hear that clip
[675.88 - 681.12] correctly that
[677.20 - 685.36] recording she's saying I'm still telling
[681.12 - 688.60] that same snowball fight story today or
[685.36 - 692.12] maybe the other day or it sounds like
[688.60 - 695.16] now I'm still telling that person the
[692.12 - 696.92] story but I haven't talked to this
[695.16 - 699.20] person in
[696.92 - 702.52] years
[699.20 - 705.44] um I don't know maybe he snapped I don't
[702.52 - 707.36] know he just has this strong will to
[705.44 - 710.12] feel important and that's what I say to
[707.36 - 712.76] kind of get back at everyone you know to
[710.12 - 713.96] be something really special and I really
[712.76 - 716.20] don't think it's
[713.96 - 718.44] spirit I think he I think he has a
[716.20 - 720.04] mental disorder actually because there's
[718.44 - 720.84] so many things things that are signals
[720.04 - 723.56] for
[720.84 - 726.00] that maybe he really does think he hears
[723.56 - 727.92] voices you know there's a lot of PE
[726.00 - 730.84] people with schizophrenia out there and
[727.92 - 732.80] they think they hear voices as well and
[730.84 - 735.72] not necessarily bad
[732.80 - 739.08] ones basically this woman doesn't
[735.72 - 741.92] believe in your gift which is fine right
[739.08 - 744.84] to each their own but she's filling in
[741.92 - 747.92] that Gap by diagnosing you as if she's a
[744.84 - 750.20] psychiatrist when she's not based on
[747.92 - 753.56] stories that you never actually told
[750.20 - 755.48] her and one major theme that I observe
[753.56 - 757.92] from these recordings is that several
[755.48 - 759.32] people in this group weaponize the fact
[757.92 - 762.40] that they've ever spoken to you
[759.32 - 765.32] personally at all even if you were not
[762.40 - 767.32] actually close to them in reality and
[765.32 - 769.20] they use it as leverage to position
[767.32 - 771.80] themselves as people who have Insider
[769.20 - 774.20] information to recruit others and as a
[771.80 - 776.96] marker of credibility to say whatever
[774.20 - 779.80] they want about you in general so we
[776.96 - 782.68] know talk to a lot of people
[779.80 - 784.84] um and gathered all kinds of information
[782.68 - 787.32] he has a ton
[784.84 - 790.16] from here this plotter is saying that
[787.32 - 793.76] the journalist that they sought out for
[790.16 - 796.32] this mainstream media article got a ton
[793.76 - 799.08] of his information from this
[796.32 - 801.24] woman and I'm not exactly sure that she
[799.08 - 803.40] sounds like a reliable source to say the
[801.24 - 806.32] least you don't know like when he woke
[803.40 - 809.00] up from the coma did like was he did
[806.32 - 813.16] does he is he mentally Disturbed does he
[809.00 - 814.68] think he hears a voice um I mean are
[813.16 - 817.16] these people who do like crazy
[814.68 - 820.56] sacrifices of like I don't even know who
[817.16 - 822.20] knows like like like are they acting
[820.56 - 824.56] like they're Christian but they're
[822.20 - 827.04] really killing little baby like I don't
[824.56 - 830.88]  know I it's
[827.04 - 834.64] crazy so this guy is plotting a plan
[830.88 - 839.12] with a group of people a group of
[834.64 - 841.16] plotters they've taken it to a major
[839.12 - 843.80] mainstream media
[841.16 - 846.72] outlet and at the same time they're
[843.80 - 849.96] plotting they're associating me with
[846.72 - 855.16] sacrificing babies or killing
[849.96 - 855.16] babies while they're being anonymous
[855.32 - 860.48] sources
[857.32 - 862.48] and yeah this is this is amazing
[860.48 - 866.00] actually but there's like no one more
[862.48 - 867.68] trustworthy than Robbie so I know that
[866.00 - 870.64] whatever he shared with you is like
[867.68 - 872.16] spoton can we hear that one again but
[870.64 - 875.52] there's like no one more trustworthy
[872.16 - 881.04] than Robbie so I know that whatever he
[875.52 - 883.28] shared with you is like spot on the most
[881.04 - 886.88] trustworthy that was really interesting
[883.28 - 889.84] to me is that what we're calling someone
[886.88 - 892.12] who's making up horrifying allegations
[889.84 - 895.64] of sacrificing and killing
[892.12 - 899.32] babies who completely hid this Sinister
[895.64 - 901.40] plot from me for over a year and who
[899.32 - 905.28] plotted behind your back Anthony and
[901.40 - 910.16] behind everyone's back well I'm so glad
[905.28 - 911.76] you're on the team of the good guys at
[910.16 - 913.08] least I don't know about good but at
[911.76 - 915.72] least
[913.08 - 917.92] honest got a mix but at least we're
[915.72 - 920.04] trying to be honest about it is it
[917.92 - 921.52] possible to hear that one again well I'm
[920.04 - 926.32] so glad
[921.52 - 927.92] you're on the team of the good guys at
[926.32 - 930.28] least I don't know about good but at
[927.92 - 932.40] least honest
[930.28 - 935.52] got a mix but at least we're trying to
[932.40 - 937.96] be honest about it throughout these
[935.52 - 941.64] recordings the plotters contradict
[937.96 - 945.36] themselves a lot like this here it's at
[941.64 - 948.20] first at first it's we're the good guys
[945.36 - 951.80] and then well I don't know about good
[948.20 - 954.44] but at least honest and then she says
[951.80 - 957.56] it's well we're trying to be
[954.44 - 959.76] honest this is who was named as the
[957.56 - 961.60] number one source
[959.76 - 963.40] and she's here contradicting herself
[961.60 - 966.76] again and again as she's referring to
[963.40 - 968.40] herself and her fellow colluders Anthony
[966.76 - 970.48] that's not even his real name by the way
[968.40 - 974.32] I'm not sure if you know that it's not
[970.48 - 978.36] um it's not no it's not what is
[974.32 - 981.04] it um I don't even know I don't care
[978.36 - 984.60] anymore that's not his real name
[981.04 - 987.48] though this plotter was so confident in
[984.60 - 989.76] the negative things that she was saying
[987.48 - 992.48] so confident in saying that Anthony is
[989.76 - 995.08] not your real name and yet she doesn't
[992.48 - 996.96] actually know what it is she doesn't
[995.08 - 998.40] know she doesn't care it's like she
[996.96 - 1000.36] can't even be bothered to get her
[998.40 - 1002.92] information straight before spreading
[1000.36 - 1004.40] rumors Anthony that's not even his real
[1002.92 - 1008.56] name by the way I'm not sure if you know
[1004.40 - 1009.52] that it's not um it's not no it's not
[1008.56 - 1013.52] what is
[1009.52 - 1017.04] it um I don't even know I don't care
[1013.52 - 1020.24] anymore that's not his real name though
[1017.04 - 1024.20] okay so that's not my real name I'm
[1020.24 - 1027.52] hearing the in interesting part is the
[1024.20 - 1030.04] person doesn't even care to even know
[1027.52 - 1032.00] but this person is a source that's
[1030.04 - 1034.72] supposed to be relied upon when I was
[1032.00 - 1037.84] growing up no one can pronounce my last
[1034.72 - 1040.72] name right and so my school
[1037.84 - 1043.12] teachers and other people would call me
[1040.72 - 1046.24] Anthony William and Anthony William is
[1043.12 - 1049.72] my legal name that is my real name my
[1046.24 - 1052.80] real name is Anthony and so when I hear
[1049.72 - 1055.64] that it sounds like my name Anthony is
[1052.80 - 1058.28] not even my real name so if that rumor
[1055.64 - 1061.40] is going around I could see people being
[1058.28 - 1065.08] like whoa that's not even his real name
[1061.40 - 1069.76] but it's Anthony William that's my real
[1065.08 - 1071.96] name and that's what I go by and so and
[1069.76 - 1075.96] there's nothing wrong with trying to
[1071.96 - 1078.92] maintain a little bit of privacy too but
[1075.96 - 1081.52] my name is not hidden by any means my
[1078.92 - 1085.52] last name's not hidden at all it's easy
[1081.52 - 1088.36] to find it's not as if it's being hidden
[1085.52 - 1090.52] but throughout my life my family has
[1088.36 - 1093.40] called me Anthony William my mom calls
[1090.52 - 1098.44] me Anthony William even up to this point
[1093.40 - 1101.08] now today and that is my legal name and
[1098.44 - 1103.88] Anthony is my first legal name
[1101.08 - 1106.88] too throughout these recordings I found
[1103.88 - 1109.64] that this group often conflated privacy
[1106.88 - 1111.84] with dishonesty they're acting like
[1109.64 - 1114.32] you're deceiving people when Anthony
[1111.84 - 1116.68] William is your actual legal first name
[1114.32 - 1118.68] and middle name your last name is out
[1116.68 - 1120.12] there like you said you're not hiding it
[1118.68 - 1123.56] there's nothing wrong with wanting to
[1120.12 - 1126.08] maintain some privacy meanwhile these
[1123.56 - 1128.00] plotters didn't want anyone to know what
[1126.08 - 1130.88] they've been up to and what they've been
[1128.00 - 1134.16] doing I'm not I'm not afraid of
[1130.88 - 1136.08] Anthony um I'm being strategic if I
[1134.16 - 1137.60] wanted I mean I thought about when I
[1136.08 - 1139.20] talked well do you want to be off the
[1137.60 - 1142.64] record on back I'm like what do you want
[1139.20 - 1144.96] to do here and the truth is I I'm I
[1142.64 - 1147.48] would be happy to be on the record and
[1144.96 - 1148.96] just like say Robbie said that but the
[1147.48 - 1152.44] the Strategic reason behind that that's
[1148.96 - 1153.52] not smart because I'm I have a different
[1152.44 - 1155.28] I'm I'm building something different
[1153.52 - 1157.64] with my life and I don't want to be
[1155.28 - 1160.56] associated with with this in any way
[1157.64 - 1162.96] shape or form I want to just completely
[1160.56 - 1164.80] distance myself and be gone I will not
[1162.96 - 1167.24] be in the documentary my name will not
[1164.80 - 1172.52] be in the article I'm I'm just
[1167.24 - 1174.12] leaving that's tragic in so many ways so
[1172.52 - 1177.92] I'm speechless in the moment want to
[1174.12 - 1181.32] hear that because what that plotter is
[1177.92 - 1184.28] doing is telling a journalist whatever
[1181.32 - 1187.60] they want to tell him going
[1184.28 - 1189.88] Anonymous the person's not afraid of me
[1187.60 - 1192.40] the person just doesn't want to be
[1189.88 - 1194.40] involved at any level after the
[1192.40 - 1198.76] basically the bomb is
[1194.40 - 1201.20] dropped and and a documentary happens
[1198.76 - 1203.76] because that's part of the plotter plan
[1201.20 - 1204.84] altogether but this person works in the
[1203.76 - 1207.36] health
[1204.84 - 1210.76] space is a business
[1207.36 - 1212.04] owner or Works in in business in the
[1210.76 - 1213.56] health
[1212.04 - 1216.12] space
[1213.56 - 1220.04] and here that person is
[1216.12 - 1222.96] basically plotting to plan or
[1220.04 - 1226.12] strategically plotting to plan the
[1222.96 - 1229.24] takeown of medical medium and the
[1226.12 - 1230.88] community the journalist is allow o it
[1229.24 - 1234.20] that's a whole another
[1230.88 - 1236.84] story and to unpack this I mean I could
[1234.20 - 1239.12] sit here we can sit here and unpack this
[1236.84 - 1242.96] for a long time but I know we have to
[1239.12 - 1244.72] move on there's so much more but this is
[1242.96 - 1247.08] a person working in the health space
[1244.72 - 1249.56] competitor rival whatever you want to
[1247.08 - 1251.88] say a plotter with a group of
[1249.56 - 1255.12] people directing a
[1251.88 - 1256.96] journalist staying Anonymous going on
[1255.12 - 1258.44] their merry way to keep doing what
[1256.96 - 1261.08] they're doing in the house space in the
[1258.44 - 1262.68] health field not having their name
[1261.08 - 1264.64] attached to anything and they're not
[1262.68 - 1266.56] afraid of me at the same time and all
[1264.64 - 1268.96] this is perfectly fine to the
[1266.56 - 1271.32] journalist perfectly fine obviously to
[1268.96 - 1274.80] the media
[1271.32 - 1277.72] company I find it
[1274.80 - 1279.84] despicable great like he's really he's
[1277.72 - 1282.08] really easygoing and if you say to him
[1279.84 - 1284.40] like I want to talk on
[1282.08 - 1286.80] background um or I want to talk off the
[1284.40 - 1289.00] Record or however you want to do it if
[1286.80 - 1292.76] you say I don't want you to quote
[1289.00 - 1295.76] or say you like you know put my name
[1292.76 - 1299.36] anywhere he's happy to do that and he's
[1295.76 - 1301.76] also like he change your name if you
[1299.36 - 1303.52] want you know a particular statement to
[1301.76 - 1306.24] be said but you want to use a different
[1303.52 - 1307.72] name you know just make sure you are
[1306.24 - 1310.72] upfront
[1307.72 - 1313.12] about anonymity you know do you want
[1310.72 - 1315.80] your name mentioned or not be sure you
[1313.12 - 1319.04] say clearly what you
[1315.80 - 1322.48] want um and on my recommendation for
[1319.04 - 1326.40] that you know what that is is to not
[1322.48 - 1327.84] don't go there um you know you don't
[1326.40 - 1329.88] want to be sued for any kind of
[1327.84 - 1332.56] defamation of
[1329.88 - 1335.56] character so on these recordings I'm
[1332.56 - 1338.48] pretty sure that what is being described
[1335.56 - 1342.52] here is not how real journalism is
[1338.48 - 1343.92] supposed to be conducted and one of
[1342.52 - 1346.00] these plotters is clearly aware that
[1343.92 - 1348.48] what she's saying is most likely
[1346.00 - 1350.20] defamatory it's like she's going to go
[1348.48 - 1352.52] after you but she's not going to put her
[1350.20 - 1354.40] name behind it it sounds like she's not
[1352.52 - 1356.76] confident in what she's saying and
[1354.40 - 1359.44] concerned that what she's saying might
[1356.76 - 1360.76] not be true and some of these sources
[1359.44 - 1362.72] won't put their names behind their
[1360.76 - 1365.40] statements because they admittedly don't
[1362.72 - 1367.60] completely stand behind their statements
[1365.40 - 1370.60] so if he had if he had picked something
[1367.60 - 1374.40] out that was like yes like I stand by
[1370.60 - 1376.76] that statement like 1,000% every single
[1374.40 - 1378.28] moment of my life like I'd be I would
[1376.76 - 1380.48] have been like yeah you can use my name
[1378.28 - 1385.20] but the the things that he asked me to
[1380.48 - 1389.48] go on record were like not things that
[1385.20 - 1392.20] I um I was just like I don't I mean I
[1389.48 - 1395.00] said that that's not really
[1392.20 - 1396.68] like something that I feel like super
[1395.00 - 1398.08] strongly about it feels important to
[1396.68 - 1400.84] have my name behind it so I ended up
[1398.08 - 1402.96] saying no and he was very kind about it
[1400.84 - 1405.76] I mean he asked me to explain why and I
[1402.96 - 1406.88] did but he didn't like push me about it
[1405.76 - 1411.44] at all
[1406.88 - 1412.72] so that's a major red flag to me I think
[1411.44 - 1414.64] that that sounds like something the
[1412.72 - 1417.08] journalist something that the journalist
[1414.64 - 1419.88] should have pushed her on if she doesn't
[1417.08 - 1422.12] feel comfortable with what she said she
[1419.88 - 1423.56] shouldn't have it in print the fact that
[1422.12 - 1426.00] the journalist knows that she doesn't
[1423.56 - 1429.32] even fully stand behind what she said to
[1426.00 - 1431.52] me that shouldn't even go in an article
[1429.32 - 1435.40] then I really don't even know what to
[1431.52 - 1437.04] say about this when you unpack this one
[1435.40 - 1440.20] the person doesn't feel comfortable
[1437.04 - 1443.72] standing behind their statement that
[1440.20 - 1446.04] alone right and then the person isn't
[1443.72 - 1450.12] even
[1446.04 - 1454.68] 1,000% uh confident the statement is not
[1450.12 - 1457.44] just stand bable but can even be seen
[1454.68 - 1460.28] the person wants to be anonymous in the
[1457.44 - 1462.04] back end but that but the yet isn't
[1460.28 - 1464.28] standing behind the statements doesn't
[1462.04 - 1466.92] want them out front on
[1464.28 - 1468.80] record journalist seems to be fine with
[1466.92 - 1471.76] it I mean it just seems like a
[1468.80 - 1474.52] weaponization of some kind it's almost
[1471.76 - 1477.60] like just fit anything in oh you want to
[1474.52 - 1479.88] be in the backend then fine you don't
[1477.60 - 1482.24] have to stand behind these comments
[1479.88 - 1485.68] we'll put them in the
[1482.24 - 1487.88] article but don't worry we won't same
[1485.68 - 1491.00] your say your name maybe they'll even
[1487.88 - 1492.92] change a name of course put a fake name
[1491.00 - 1495.08] it's a type of
[1492.92 - 1498.24] wordsmithing for
[1495.08 - 1500.12] sure it and they do this I think to make
[1498.24 - 1500.92] the reader feel any way they want them
[1500.12 - 1503.32] to
[1500.92 - 1505.32] feel and they kind of put what they want
[1503.32 - 1506.88] to put in even if the person isn't
[1505.32 - 1508.76] standing behind
[1506.88 - 1512.24] it
[1508.76 - 1514.16] and this should be the bigger story
[1512.24 - 1517.88] because this
[1514.16 - 1517.88] is yeah this is
[1519.40 - 1524.40] unconscious
[1521.08 - 1526.60] yeah it's it's not a natural situation
[1524.40 - 1529.52] it's not a natural story it seems as
[1526.60 - 1530.88] though these people don't know much of
[1529.52 - 1533.08] the story or they don't feel comfortable
[1530.88 - 1535.08] standing by their own statements and
[1533.08 - 1536.64] there's some misinformation mixed in and
[1535.08 - 1539.32] then you've got a journalist listening
[1536.64 - 1542.40] is that this stuff is all you know real
[1539.32 - 1546.04] it's it's kind of like a favoring of the
[1542.40 - 1549.04] plotted plan and it's it's that falls in
[1546.04 - 1551.08] the line of I mean some character
[1549.04 - 1552.80] assassination territory it's like you
[1551.08 - 1554.88] can keep you can take sources that are
[1552.80 - 1556.88] filled with misinformation and then you
[1554.88 - 1558.72] can weaponize it like you said you can
[1556.88 - 1561.80] slip in a factor or two somewhere around
[1558.72 - 1565.24] it and then you make it as if it's law
[1561.80 - 1567.16] or complete truth and uh it's really
[1565.24 - 1568.64] interesting it's it's it seems like it's
[1567.16 - 1572.76] a way of telling the story the way that
[1568.64 - 1574.56] they want the reader to read it and so
[1572.76 - 1576.88] obviously I had some questions about all
[1574.56 - 1578.56] of this as I was listening to to this
[1576.88 - 1581.44] group of individuals I was trying to
[1578.56 - 1583.64] figure it all out I really truly was not
[1581.44 - 1585.56] asking a huge amount of questions I was
[1583.64 - 1587.00] mostly just trying to hear these people
[1585.56 - 1588.12] out as you can hear in the recordings
[1587.00 - 1589.72] that we're sharing
[1588.12 - 1591.48] but it was interesting to me that
[1589.72 - 1593.28] throughout this process they quickly
[1591.48 - 1596.08] became uncomfortable with me asking
[1593.28 - 1598.16] questions at all you might want to stop
[1596.08 - 1600.08] talking to some to people at some point
[1598.16 - 1601.96] I mean I can't imagine you you don't
[1600.08 - 1603.08] have enough information by now I mean
[1601.96 - 1606.20] again I don't know how much more you
[1603.08 - 1609.68] need to know Amber but yeah
[1606.20 - 1612.96] um obviously go ahead I'm just saying
[1609.68 - 1614.48] like I'm just looking out for you like I
[1612.96 - 1616.52] guess my question is how long do you
[1614.48 - 1618.12] want to stay in the state I think
[1616.52 - 1620.08] Robbie's kind of frustrated with me
[1618.12 - 1621.76] because I've been asking questions and
[1620.08 - 1624.92] it's for me
[1621.76 - 1628.32] too this group of plotters feels so
[1624.92 - 1631.08] strongly about you being so problematic
[1628.32 - 1633.88] that they have taken it this far so as
[1631.08 - 1636.60] to plot to take you down to take the
[1633.88 - 1639.16] community down yet they don't even know
[1636.60 - 1640.28] medical medium information that well
[1639.16 - 1642.68] you've probably read the books more
[1640.28 - 1645.08] thoroughly than I than I
[1642.68 - 1647.04] have well the first one I actually
[1645.08 - 1649.96] really liked the first very first one
[1647.04 - 1652.24] that came up out it was kind of real
[1649.96 - 1654.12] except for the stories I kind of skipped
[1652.24 - 1657.12] over those but you know all the
[1654.12 - 1659.32] protocols and stuff were very helpful
[1657.12 - 1660.84] and the information seems
[1659.32 - 1662.96] sincere
[1660.84 - 1664.56] um whether it's right or not I don't
[1662.96 - 1666.88] know but it certainly was interesting
[1664.56 - 1669.12] and I had never heard of what he was
[1666.88 - 1671.44] talking about before I met him so I am
[1669.12 - 1673.16] grateful for that because I think what
[1671.44 - 1676.12] he's mentioning is very
[1673.16 - 1678.12] real This Woman This plotter is
[1676.12 - 1681.00] admitting that the information is
[1678.12 - 1684.96] helpful she's also saying that she
[1681.00 - 1686.36] skimmed through it so she didn't really
[1684.96 - 1688.48] study the book she didn't really study
[1686.36 - 1689.88] the information and then at the same
[1688.48 - 1692.20] time she was telling me that
[1689.88 - 1694.60] practitioners come to her to learn from
[1692.20 - 1696.48] her all the time and she was suggesting
[1694.60 - 1698.76] that I could come to her for
[1696.48 - 1700.80] practitioner support and
[1698.76 - 1702.20] education are there people who are
[1700.80 - 1705.12] applying medical medium information
[1702.20 - 1708.12] still who call you and ask for advice
[1705.12 - 1710.56] absolutely yeah that's mostly what
[1708.12 - 1713.80] I have I have very few clients that
[1710.56 - 1715.92] found me outside of medical medium and
[1713.80 - 1718.32] you know word of mouth is really
[1715.92 - 1721.64] big um you know and when somebody
[1718.32 - 1723.28] mentions you on social media yeah you
[1721.64 - 1726.40] know you well you're probably there
[1723.28 - 1728.20] right now with getting recommendations
[1726.40 - 1731.76] and people love Word of Mouth from
[1728.20 - 1733.52] others or being helped yeah yeah but
[1731.76 - 1735.08] also so practitioners who are applying
[1733.52 - 1736.16] medical medium information will ask you
[1735.08 - 1740.52] for
[1736.16 - 1743.56] advice oh yeah yeah yeah this plotter is
[1740.52 - 1746.52] positioning herself as an authority as a
[1743.56 - 1748.56] health practitioner when it seems as
[1746.52 - 1751.24] though she doesn't even really know
[1748.56 - 1754.44] medical medium information she doesn't
[1751.24 - 1756.96] believe in spirit it sounds like she
[1754.44 - 1760.04] really only read the first book it
[1756.96 - 1763.32] sounds like she skimmed it at best there
[1760.04 - 1768.96] are eight books plus a ton of other
[1763.32 - 1771.56] resources if food were the only key to
[1768.96 - 1773.20] healing which is what Anthony implies
[1771.56 - 1777.52] really
[1773.20 - 1779.88] um so but I
[1777.52 - 1782.92] mean I mean do you do you ever hear
[1779.88 - 1786.40] Anthony talk about anything other than
[1782.92 - 1788.28] what to eat not not a lot right I mean
[1786.40 - 1790.28] he does get into some spiritual stuff
[1788.28 - 1793.76] and things but not
[1790.28 - 1797.40] really yeah I mean he had talked about
[1793.76 - 1800.36] he's got like the Angels he's got the
[1797.40 - 1802.32] the soul healing techniques he's got in
[1800.36 - 1805.40] the healing path resource he talked
[1802.32 - 1806.84] about which I think that like that
[1805.40 - 1809.28] doesn't that's something that nobody
[1806.84 - 1811.44] really comes across anymore he talked
[1809.28 - 1814.64] about the importance of like exercise
[1811.44 - 1816.64] and sunlight and and all of those other
[1814.64 - 1818.36] sorts of things that's good yeah I have
[1816.64 - 1820.00] he the healing path but not for a really
[1818.36 - 1822.32] long time
[1820.00 - 1824.44] yeah well that's right he did mention
[1822.32 - 1826.24] some of that yeah I don't know he really
[1824.44 - 1827.80] focuses on food though
[1826.24 - 1831.16] now
[1827.80 - 1832.92] so here I wasn't going to I wasn't going
[1831.16 - 1834.84] to go into explaining more I wasn't
[1832.92 - 1837.12] about to try to give this woman a lesson
[1834.84 - 1841.40] on how all of the books and how all of
[1837.12 - 1843.96] the resources are about so much more
[1841.40 - 1847.12] than just how to eat I wanted to see
[1843.96 - 1849.52] what she knew and it became really clear
[1847.12 - 1851.00] to me that this group again does not
[1849.52 - 1854.32] really understand medical medium
[1851.00 - 1856.20] information for what it is and yet their
[1854.32 - 1857.84] sources they feel so strongly about you
[1856.20 - 1860.72] and the information being problematic in
[1857.84 - 1862.68] some way shape or form yet um they admit
[1860.72 - 1865.40] to applying it in their own lives
[1862.68 - 1867.24] explicitly without citing The Source
[1865.40 - 1869.88] maybe you can still take that following
[1867.24 - 1872.12] and just you know do Your Own Thing
[1869.88 - 1874.08] aside from medical medium you know not
[1872.12 - 1878.12] without like like Robbie said without
[1874.08 - 1880.76] mentioning him but still uh teach people
[1878.12 - 1882.84] what you've learned and what you what
[1880.76 - 1885.40] you practice yourself and what works for
[1882.84 - 1888.32] you and kind of work on it from that
[1885.40 - 1891.04] perspective since you have a already you
[1888.32 - 1893.40] could now do I when I talk to people
[1891.04 - 1895.48] about health and wellbeing use a million
[1893.40 - 1897.44] things that I've learned from him 100% I
[1895.48 - 1900.28] mean getting this information out in the
[1897.44 - 1904.64] world he shouldn't care who gets credit
[1900.28 - 1907.56] for it I don't know any healer any real
[1904.64 - 1910.32] healer that wants to have credit for
[1907.56 - 1912.76] things and trust me you didn't you know
[1910.32 - 1915.72] you you didn't need to credit Anthony
[1912.76 - 1918.48] for what you've learned and you can do
[1915.72 - 1922.60] that without ever using the word medical
[1918.48 - 1925.96] medium or Anthony William you know here
[1922.60 - 1927.32] this group is coaching me on how to not
[1925.96 - 1929.32] site the
[1927.32 - 1930.96] information they're coaching me on how
[1929.32 - 1933.20] to plagiarize the
[1930.96 - 1935.36] information unlike them I site the
[1933.20 - 1936.28] source and I always will because it's
[1935.36 - 1938.88] about
[1936.28 - 1942.68] integrity it's about caring about other
[1938.88 - 1945.36] people it's about people needing to heal
[1942.68 - 1948.00] citing the source is about respect not
[1945.36 - 1950.28] citing The Source ends up in and people
[1948.00 - 1953.48] putting their own spin on it even if
[1950.28 - 1955.92] they don't mean to it gets tainted right
[1953.48 - 1958.32] by human interference the information
[1955.92 - 1960.64] gets changed and further distorted as it
[1958.32 - 1963.04] gets passed down the line becoming
[1960.64 - 1966.04] something else entirely like a game of
[1963.04 - 1969.96] telephone where no one can fully get
[1966.04 - 1973.08] what they need to heal and you know it
[1969.96 - 1975.48] just it makes me question the level of
[1973.08 - 1978.16] compassion that this group has for
[1975.48 - 1980.16] others citing the source is not about
[1978.16 - 1982.28] Anthony it's not about you Anthony it's
[1980.16 - 1984.72] not about you seeking notoriety in any
[1982.28 - 1986.72] way shape or form I know that it it
[1984.72 - 1989.56] comes from a place of deeply caring
[1986.72 - 1992.56] about people and people having access to
[1989.56 - 1995.68] the original pure information which just
[1992.56 - 1998.28] so happens to be free you can access it
[1995.68 - 2001.28] all for free so that the people who are
[1998.28 - 2004.52] struggling and suffering can take it as
[2001.28 - 2007.68] far as they need to go this group they
[2004.52 - 2010.48] want to Brand themselves they want to be
[2007.68 - 2012.76] somebody they all have businesses in the
[2010.48 - 2014.84] wellness space they're trying to
[2012.76 - 2017.16] convince me to have no
[2014.84 - 2020.40] Integrity they're essentially saying
[2017.16 - 2022.56] that all of the copyrighted original
[2020.40 - 2026.40] information is free
[2022.56 - 2029.64] game they want rights to that they feel
[2026.40 - 2031.40] entitled to that they feel entitled to
[2029.64 - 2034.60] continue on with their
[2031.40 - 2038.76] brands meanwhile they want a postm
[2034.60 - 2040.76] medical medium era they want it all down
[2038.76 - 2042.56] they want everyone to stop mentioning
[2040.76 - 2046.28] medical medium at
[2042.56 - 2049.84] all these people with these intentions
[2046.28 - 2052.44] are the main sources behind this plot
[2049.84 - 2055.00] and this article they're plagiarized
[2052.44 - 2057.36] from other books who were his mentors
[2055.00 - 2059.60] before him like yeah everybody knows
[2057.36 - 2063.60] that apples have X vitamins and Z
[2059.60 - 2067.12] vitamins and his information is very
[2063.60 - 2069.92] very very basic vitamins in an apple is
[2067.12 - 2072.40] interesting because the medical medium
[2069.92 - 2074.28] information the books they really don't
[2072.40 - 2076.08] talk much about vitamins that's actually
[2074.28 - 2078.04] what everybody else does out there
[2076.08 - 2080.36] because that's essentially as as far as
[2078.04 - 2081.92] science and research goes and I know
[2080.36 - 2084.00] that you and I Anthony could talk for
[2081.92 - 2085.40] hours about what makes medical medium
[2084.00 - 2088.16] information completely unique and
[2085.40 - 2090.00] original um it's quite an insult to
[2088.16 - 2093.60] oversimplify the information like that
[2090.00 - 2095.20] and to try to discredit how unlike
[2093.60 - 2097.96] anything else that's out there that's
[2095.20 - 2100.76] ever been done before in history his it
[2097.96 - 2104.52] is and whether people want to admit that
[2100.76 - 2107.24] or not it's true and then we've got this
[2104.52 - 2108.64] plotter who's accusing you of
[2107.24 - 2111.52] plagiarizing
[2108.64 - 2113.20] information it's a serious accusation so
[2111.52 - 2116.44] when I think about that and I see what
[2113.20 - 2120.12] the plot are saying that's a serious
[2116.44 - 2122.44] accusation first of all my publisher
[2120.12 - 2125.08] would never let one of the medical
[2122.44 - 2128.04] medium books out the door if it was
[2125.08 - 2130.76] plagiarized on any level
[2128.04 - 2134.52] they have a lot of
[2130.76 - 2137.48] editors they uh purposely look for
[2134.52 - 2140.64] things like that they can't just let the
[2137.48 - 2143.68] book go out because these books are
[2140.64 - 2146.44] symptoms and conditions and a lot of
[2143.68 - 2149.84] intricate information about the body all
[2146.44 - 2152.56] that stuff has to be cited from studies
[2149.84 - 2155.68] and places of origin that could be like
[2152.56 - 2157.96] medical clinics um articles that are out
[2155.68 - 2161.88] there from doctors it all has to be
[2157.96 - 2163.56] cited it can't just be thrown into a
[2161.88 - 2167.24] medical medium book and then sent out
[2163.56 - 2169.16] the door by the publisher so there's no
[2167.24 - 2172.96] such thing as plagiarizing in these
[2169.16 - 2175.64] books and these books would have to site
[2172.96 - 2177.28] every single thing everywhere out there
[2175.64 - 2180.04] the publisher wouldn't have it in any
[2177.28 - 2183.80] other way so yeah so that that
[2180.04 - 2187.38] accusation is ridiculous he's very he's
[2183.80 - 2188.72] very smart and
[2187.38 - 2191.48] [Music]
[2188.72 - 2194.28] um yeah probably has some kind of
[2191.48 - 2196.64] personality disorder potentially
[2194.28 - 2199.76] narcissism
[2196.64 - 2201.32] and I I don't know what else I found
[2199.76 - 2203.36] that to be a really interesting
[2201.32 - 2206.00] assessment coming from a group of
[2203.36 - 2208.80] individuals that refers to themselves as
[2206.00 - 2212.04] Elite but I'm letting you know
[2208.80 - 2214.56] like we are an elite group of people
[2212.04 - 2216.76] we're we're in in Elite category you
[2214.56 - 2219.92] know I want to play this clip again
[2216.76 - 2223.56] again in a minute because recently one
[2219.92 - 2225.12] of these plotters claimed that nobody
[2223.56 - 2228.04] ever they tried to claim that nobody
[2225.12 - 2230.20] ever referred to themselves as Elites
[2228.04 - 2232.24] and I want to display that I'm not
[2230.20 - 2234.56] putting words in these people's mouths
[2232.24 - 2237.20] these are actually things that were said
[2234.56 - 2239.04] by them on these recordings I also want
[2237.20 - 2241.44] to point out the fact that you Anthony
[2239.04 - 2243.36] have never referred to yourself as Elite
[2241.44 - 2246.04] you've never referred to yourself as
[2243.36 - 2249.28] being above anyone or anything of the
[2246.04 - 2250.68] like there's this really twisted Dynamic
[2249.28 - 2252.72] with this group where it's like
[2250.68 - 2255.24] everything it seems like everything that
[2252.72 - 2258.12] they're accusing you of is actually what
[2255.24 - 2260.96] they're doing and how they
[2258.12 - 2264.20] are but I'm letting you know
[2260.96 - 2266.88] like we are an elite group of people
[2264.20 - 2269.76] we're we're in in Elite category you
[2266.88 - 2274.32] know and by the way Ash do need to work
[2269.76 - 2277.56] Ash has ever ever the woman is she had
[2274.32 - 2281.44] family money a lot of it yeah you know
[2277.56 - 2284.48] private plus did I hear that correctly
[2281.44 - 2287.52] can I hear that back that clip and by
[2284.48 - 2291.12] the way Ash didn't need to work Ash has
[2287.52 - 2294.00] ever ever the woman is she had family
[2291.12 - 2295.68] money a lot of it yeah you know private
[2294.00 - 2299.12] jet and
[2295.68 - 2300.64] plus so basically they're saying they're
[2299.12 - 2303.36] an elite
[2300.64 - 2306.60] group you've shown the all the
[2303.36 - 2309.12] recordings so far or a fraction of them
[2306.60 - 2311.92] really from what you said you have but
[2309.12 - 2314.08] you showed recordings showing that
[2311.92 - 2317.24] they're plotting this plan they went to
[2314.08 - 2322.28] the media company mainstream media
[2317.24 - 2326.16] outlet they are strategic about
[2322.28 - 2328.28] it and they even have a ranking system
[2326.16 - 2330.96] like the number one person involved
[2328.28 - 2334.12] number two number three number four and
[2330.96 - 2335.08] now I hear one of the people has a
[2334.12 - 2338.20] private
[2335.08 - 2339.32] jet they don't have to work or work for
[2338.20 - 2343.04] a
[2339.32 - 2345.08] living and they have what seems to be
[2343.04 - 2349.24] lots of family
[2345.08 - 2351.80] wealth and I don't have a private jet I
[2349.24 - 2353.88] have to work for a living I have to work
[2351.80 - 2356.88] to make sure I could bring this
[2353.88 - 2359.52] information to everyone to the
[2356.88 - 2362.08] public and there's no pay
[2359.52 - 2363.56] walls and there's no programs nothing
[2362.08 - 2366.08] like
[2363.56 - 2367.92] that of course I don't mind when people
[2366.08 - 2370.48] mon their websites or do what they want
[2367.92 - 2373.76] to do with their businesses but I don't
[2370.48 - 2375.36] monetize my website like other people
[2373.76 - 2378.76] do
[2375.36 - 2382.04] and meanwhile this person has a private
[2378.76 - 2384.36] jet lots of wealth seems to be the
[2382.04 - 2388.08] number one plotter from what it looks
[2384.36 - 2389.84] like with the list and ranking
[2388.08 - 2393.24] system
[2389.84 - 2395.88] and yeah I mean I'm speechless really um
[2393.24 - 2399.24] I come from the working class that's
[2395.88 - 2402.72] where I come from from but apparently
[2399.24 - 2405.08] this is an elite group they're saying
[2402.72 - 2406.88] that in in these
[2405.08 - 2409.36] recordings
[2406.88 - 2410.80] um so yeah and knowing that these
[2409.36 - 2413.52] plotters are
[2410.80 - 2417.04] actually looking to get that documentary
[2413.52 - 2418.72] together negative documentary all of it
[2417.04 - 2421.48] plus the article and then when you look
[2418.72 - 2423.44] at the plotters and the information they
[2421.48 - 2424.88] don't even care to even want to know
[2423.44 - 2428.04] what my name
[2424.88 - 2430.36] is but yet my fate is in their
[2428.04 - 2435.84] hands and the community's Fate is in
[2430.36 - 2439.60] their hands of this plot it's really
[2435.84 - 2442.20] interesting yeah so let's let this group
[2439.60 - 2444.12] speak for themselves more about their
[2442.20 - 2446.40] plot I mean when you think about this
[2444.12 - 2448.48] from a journalist perspective this piece
[2446.40 - 2451.04] is unfuckingbelievable I mean this is
[2448.48 - 2453.88] this is a journalist dream I mean you
[2451.04 - 2455.32] you want I mean the celebrities the
[2453.88 - 2458.52] number of books
[2455.32 - 2460.56] sold yeah it is awful and that's why
[2458.52 - 2462.28] this there's an article coming out about
[2460.56 - 2466.32] him I don't know if you know anything
[2462.28 - 2468.48] about that it's not a good one y I would
[2466.32 - 2471.36] not want to be on that train when that
[2468.48 - 2474.52] article comes out just saying I think
[2471.36 - 2476.68] there's there's a lot coming is what I
[2474.52 - 2478.92] think which is why it's really good that
[2476.68 - 2483.24] they're telling them now yeah we're
[2478.92 - 2486.40] hopeful that once the Articles out um
[2483.24 - 2488.40] one of the directors or producers that
[2486.40 - 2491.44] works with
[2488.40 - 2494.76] will uh you know become interested in
[2491.44 - 2496.52] telling the story really well oh cool
[2494.76 - 2499.84] awesome I'll pass that on to my husband
[2496.52 - 2501.12] he was a cinematographer for that he
[2499.84 - 2504.04] primarily has been working in
[2501.12 - 2507.72] documentary last few years Britain was
[2504.04 - 2510.32] on the phone and I was like I was like
[2507.72 - 2512.16] look guys like Britain I was like you
[2510.32 - 2514.40] have the connections like you were the
[2512.16 - 2516.88] cinematographer bad vegan like can't why
[2514.40 - 2519.52] don't you just go like this talk to
[2516.88 - 2521.48] people yeah and then and then like
[2519.52 - 2524.48] that's when and that's when Ash went
[2521.48 - 2526.76] because like theoretically without me
[2524.48 - 2528.28] pushing this along why the didn't
[2526.76 - 2531.68] Ash go
[2528.28 - 2534.76] to months prior right like what took why
[2531.68 - 2538.36] did she do that like I feel like I is
[2534.76 - 2542.68] yeah okay that would make a lot of
[2538.36 - 2547.16] money no question I'm in
[2542.68 - 2549.04] shock as I stated in our in part one
[2547.16 - 2551.32] this group appears to be using a
[2549.04 - 2553.72] manipulated story of a deceased person
[2551.32 - 2556.52] in order to drive out their
[2553.72 - 2559.20] goals what we're uncovering again and
[2556.52 - 2561.48] again is I mean again this is just kind
[2559.20 - 2564.32] of scratching the surface it's it's that
[2561.48 - 2566.92] there are so many more layers to this
[2564.32 - 2569.48] this the deceased person it seems to me
[2566.92 - 2571.04] in all of these 17 hours of calls that
[2569.48 - 2573.88] I've had all these
[2571.04 - 2576.72] recordings um with these people as part
[2573.88 - 2580.52] of this group is that the story
[2576.72 - 2582.84] is essentially a guise that really draws
[2580.52 - 2585.28] people in and really makes people feel
[2582.84 - 2588.32] like oh you know medical medium is so
[2585.28 - 2590.84] bad and but then as I was really
[2588.32 - 2592.84] speaking to these people and and hearing
[2590.84 - 2596.04] them out about what was problematic
[2592.84 - 2598.00] about you to them a huge percentage of
[2596.04 - 2599.44] it was just all of this other stuff it
[2598.00 - 2600.52] was there were all of these other layers
[2599.44 - 2603.16] and all this stuff underneath the
[2600.52 - 2604.84] surface these stories these rumors all
[2603.16 - 2607.16] of this Twisted
[2604.84 - 2609.48] misinformation and then you can kind of
[2607.16 - 2612.04] see in the recordings in their own words
[2609.48 - 2613.76] in a lot of these clips what is actually
[2612.04 - 2617.12] going on behind the scenes and maybe
[2613.76 - 2620.20] what's driving these people in in ways
[2617.12 - 2621.76] that I don't know if they realize um but
[2620.20 - 2624.20] maybe some people who are involved in
[2621.76 - 2627.72] this are being driven by as I said
[2624.20 - 2630.24] before some potentially misplaced grief
[2627.72 - 2631.84] or potentially guilt about their own
[2630.24 - 2635.04] involvement with the situation something
[2631.84 - 2637.96] like that but it seems like a lot of it
[2635.04 - 2640.24] is being driven by nefarious intentions
[2637.96 - 2643.40] and by what some of these people can
[2640.24 - 2645.96] stand to gain personally professionally
[2643.40 - 2651.80] financially and otherwise from the
[2645.96 - 2655.08] Fulfillment of this plot this plan I'm
[2651.80 - 2657.92] seeing yeah I mean I'm in I don't even
[2655.08 - 2660.88] know what to say I like I can't get my
[2657.92 - 2663.64] words together because I'm hearing
[2660.88 - 2666.24] cinematographers um Making Connections
[2663.64 - 2668.88] Making Connections about the documentary
[2666.24 - 2672.68] that they're bringing to the media
[2668.88 - 2677.40] Outlet I'm hearing that I'm hearing
[2672.68 - 2680.92] money uh is is involved I'm
[2677.40 - 2683.12] hearing a person talk about how they
[2680.92 - 2687.48] wouldn't want to be on this train when
[2683.12 - 2689.76] this article comes out which is which is
[2687.48 - 2692.20] means they all knew they're all
[2689.76 - 2694.40] plotting it's their connections to the
[2692.20 - 2696.16] media company it's all in these
[2694.40 - 2698.88] recordings I heard it's it's a
[2696.16 - 2700.92] journalist dream because they're selling
[2698.88 - 2702.00] it to a journalist saying hey this is a
[2700.92 - 2704.08] journalist
[2702.00 - 2707.00] dream um I hear they're talking about
[2704.08 - 2711.00] how many numbers of book sold um things
[2707.00 - 2716.08] in that nature uh this is a
[2711.00 - 2717.88] premeditated plot who can do this it's
[2716.08 - 2720.68] unconscious doesn't matter how much
[2717.88 - 2725.08] damage is done to the community doesn't
[2720.68 - 2727.36] matter anything they have a strategy and
[2725.08 - 2731.48] a plan in place it's all there in the
[2727.36 - 2733.32] recordings I don't even know what to say
[2731.48 - 2735.88] when I hear these
[2733.32 - 2737.88] recordings can you replay that clip the
[2735.88 - 2740.24] important clip I mean they're all
[2737.88 - 2742.68] important but the important clip about
[2740.24 - 2745.72] they had the idea first the plot and
[2742.68 - 2749.28] they took it to the media company Brit
[2745.72 - 2751.80] was on the phone and I was like I was
[2749.28 - 2753.80] like look guys like Britain I was like
[2751.80 - 2756.20] you have the connections like you were
[2753.80 - 2758.64] the cinematographer bad vegan like why
[2756.20 - 2761.28] don't you just go like just talk to
[2758.64 - 2763.24] people yeah and then and then like
[2761.28 - 2766.24] that's when and that's when Ash went
[2763.24 - 2768.52] because like theoretically without me
[2766.24 - 2770.04] pushing this along why the didn't
[2768.52 - 2773.48] Ash go
[2770.04 - 2775.84] to months prior right like what took why
[2773.48 - 2779.28] did she do that like I feel like I inst
[2775.84 - 2782.08] it so it wasn't the media company that
[2779.28 - 2784.92] took upon the story upon themselves the
[2782.08 - 2788.48] recordings say everything it turns out
[2784.92 - 2791.72] it was their idea that's the instigator
[2788.48 - 2793.80] there and then the husband has the
[2791.72 - 2797.80] connections to the media
[2793.80 - 2798.76] outlet and they took that plot to the
[2797.80 - 2802.52] media
[2798.76 - 2804.88] Outlet um sounds like took the plot to
[2802.52 - 2806.36] the media Outlet using husband's
[2804.88 - 2810.20] connections
[2806.36 - 2813.40] too um and this is before it even
[2810.20 - 2817.80] started so this is even early on
[2813.40 - 2817.80] so what this plot is saying
[2818.36 - 2822.24] it's Unthinkable it's just
[2822.40 - 2828.04] Unthinkable yeah and like you were
[2824.92 - 2830.28] saying before it's these are we're
[2828.04 - 2832.40] showing motives we're showing true
[2830.28 - 2835.12] intentions by these people saying these
[2832.40 - 2837.48] things in their own words were showing
[2835.12 - 2839.24] all of this colluding and and just
[2837.48 - 2842.76] really interesting Dynamics and how this
[2839.24 - 2846.44] story all came to be and there's a
[2842.76 - 2850.04] serious lack of concern for the damage
[2846.44 - 2852.20] that essentially they intend to to cause
[2850.04 - 2855.80] so can you talk more about that and and
[2852.20 - 2860.84] how this process has has affected
[2855.80 - 2863.40] you well it's affected me for sure but
[2860.84 - 2867.28] the worst part is it's it's affected the
[2863.40 - 2869.96] communities because I had to Forfeit the
[2867.28 - 2871.88] book I was going to do for this year
[2869.96 - 2873.88] that was going to be released in October
[2871.88 - 2875.40] but there's no way to do it so it was a
[2873.88 - 2881.12] spiritual book that everybody was
[2875.40 - 2884.92] waiting for um so I had to cancel that
[2881.12 - 2887.20] um four months straight with hundreds of
[2884.92 - 2889.36] questions from a
[2887.20 - 2890.88] journalist
[2889.36 - 2894.72] and
[2890.88 - 2896.28] the I mean the crazy thing is it's just
[2894.72 - 2899.44] yeah I haven't worked in four months for
[2896.28 - 2900.72] the community at all so when you those
[2899.44 - 2904.16] are the things that I care about the
[2900.72 - 2908.40] most never mind the the damage you know
[2904.16 - 2911.96] involved with you know my family and um
[2908.40 - 2915.04] you know all of that involved it's it's
[2911.96 - 2917.72] really the big part for me is is the
[2915.04 - 2920.00] future of getting the information out to
[2917.72 - 2922.36] the community and all that so this is
[2920.00 - 2924.36] the first time since I started putting
[2922.36 - 2926.56] books out that I've had to
[2924.36 - 2929.96] Forfeit and actually just cancel the
[2926.56 - 2933.12] whole book um for for this year for sure
[2929.96 - 2936.36] so yeah there's it's it's affecting my
[2933.12 - 2938.16] life of course but it's affecting
[2936.36 - 2939.72] what which is what I always care about
[2938.16 - 2942.20] the most which is the community and
[2939.72 - 2945.36] people who are struggling that's always
[2942.20 - 2948.96] just number one for me you know anything
[2945.36 - 2952.88] in my life it's it's secondary anyway
[2948.96 - 2957.88] but still it's it yeah hasn't been
[2952.88 - 2959.32] easy yeah it's that's I mean for this to
[2957.88 - 2962.00] have
[2959.32 - 2963.92] affected the spiritual book that I know
[2962.00 - 2967.24] everybody in the community was so
[2963.92 - 2970.08] excited about and so much looking
[2967.24 - 2973.80] forward to it just there there really
[2970.08 - 2978.00] aren't any words um for how unfortunate
[2973.80 - 2979.84] how how disappointing how awful this is
[2978.00 - 2982.08] and again hearing the true intentions
[2979.84 - 2984.40] behind it all this this whole thing is
[2982.08 - 2986.04] just completely
[2984.40 - 2988.08] unprecedented it's something that's
[2986.04 - 2990.48] never happened before in the health and
[2988.08 - 2992.60] wellness industry there it's going to
[2990.48 - 2996.12] take some time for us to unpack this
[2992.60 - 2998.48] layer by layer and I'm great ful again
[2996.12 - 3001.32] that I have the pure evidence straight
[2998.48 - 3003.16] from these people's mouths to be able to
[3001.32 - 3005.56] really show people what's been going on
[3003.16 - 3008.72] because there are a lot of twists and
[3005.56 - 3010.96] turns to it and and I just want to also
[3008.72 - 3012.72] point out the fact that you Anthony have
[3010.96 - 3014.48] been talking about this all year you've
[3012.72 - 3016.76] been talking about this even I remember
[3014.48 - 3019.76] I think before that I you've been
[3016.76 - 3021.24] talking about this for a while that
[3019.76 - 3024.60] there are people who have been trying to
[3021.24 - 3026.92] take down the community that that's
[3024.60 - 3029.00] something that has become major issue
[3026.92 - 3030.68] and that people are not citing the
[3029.00 - 3034.36] original information back to Medical
[3030.68 - 3036.12] medium and um in the community and and
[3034.36 - 3038.80] this group you know has been persuading
[3036.12 - 3041.24] others to join them and to do the same
[3038.80 - 3043.56] and I know that a lot of people didn't
[3041.24 - 3045.80] really kind of believe what you'd been
[3043.56 - 3047.08] saying didn't want to believe it that
[3045.80 - 3051.36] there was really something like this
[3047.08 - 3053.52] going on and so it's extremely sad um
[3051.36 - 3055.96] unfortunately it's true and now
[3053.52 - 3057.92] everybody can hear it for themselves is
[3055.96 - 3061.32] any chance to play the last round of
[3057.92 - 3063.08] Clips again for for everybody and I
[3061.32 - 3065.00] personally want to hear them
[3063.08 - 3068.56] because
[3065.00 - 3069.72] um I I just still can't even believe it
[3068.56 - 3072.04] I mean when you think about this from a
[3069.72 - 3073.96] journalist perspective this pieace is
[3072.04 - 3077.12] unfuckin believable I mean this is this
[3073.96 - 3080.80] is a journalist dream I mean you want I
[3077.12 - 3083.88] mean the celebrities the number of books
[3080.80 - 3086.64] sold yeah it is awful and that's why
[3083.88 - 3087.96] this there's an article coming about him
[3086.64 - 3090.32] I don't know if you know anything about
[3087.96 - 3093.52] that it's not a good
[3090.32 - 3096.36] one I would not want to be on that train
[3093.52 - 3099.56] when that article comes out just saying
[3096.36 - 3101.76] I think there's there's a lot coming is
[3099.56 - 3104.00] what I think which is why it's really
[3101.76 - 3106.20] good that they're telling them now yeah
[3104.00 - 3111.24] we're hopeful that once the article's
[3106.20 - 3113.76] out um one of the directors or producers
[3111.24 - 3116.80] that Britain works with
[3113.76 - 3120.16] will uh you know become interested in
[3116.80 - 3121.88] telling the story really well oh cool
[3120.16 - 3125.24] awesome I'll pass that on to my husband
[3121.88 - 3126.52] he was a cinematographer for that he
[3125.24 - 3128.32] primarily has been working in
[3126.52 - 3132.68] documentary the last few
[3128.32 - 3135.12] years was on the phone and that was like
[3132.68 - 3137.24] I was like look guys like Britain I was
[3135.12 - 3139.72] like you have the connections like you
[3137.24 - 3142.28] were the cinematographer bad vegan like
[3139.72 - 3144.88] why don't you just go like just talk to
[3142.28 - 3146.80] people yeah and then and then like
[3144.88 - 3149.84] that's when and that's when Ash went
[3146.80 - 3152.08] because like theoretically without me
[3149.84 - 3153.64] pushing this along why the didn't
[3152.08 - 3157.20] Ash go
[3153.64 - 3161.72] to months prior right like what why did
[3157.20 - 3164.08] she do that like I feel like I is it so
[3161.72 - 3166.24] he instigated it and instigated the
[3164.08 - 3168.76] number one plotter and a number one
[3166.24 - 3171.52] plot's husband to use connections to go
[3168.76 - 3174.40] to the mainstream media Outlet to get an
[3171.52 - 3176.76] article going about a deceased person
[3174.40 - 3182.00] who happens to be a a friend of the
[3176.76 - 3185.44] plotters friend of mine using her
[3182.00 - 3188.60] death and then having an article done by
[3185.44 - 3190.56] the media company so that bids when it
[3188.60 - 3192.08] comes out one of the plotters says I
[3190.56 - 3193.12] don't want to be on that train when that
[3192.08 - 3197.16] comes
[3193.12 - 3199.20] out all pushed by them and then when the
[3197.16 - 3201.28] article comes out bids for the
[3199.20 - 3204.04] documentary start and then the husband
[3201.28 - 3207.08] has connections to producers this is
[3204.04 - 3208.80] everything I heard on those
[3207.08 - 3214.88] recordings
[3208.80 - 3214.88] and this is allowed by mainstream
[3215.68 - 3220.88] media from what it looks like these are
[3218.36 - 3224.68] highly highly compromised sources that
