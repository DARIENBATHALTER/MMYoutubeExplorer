[74.64 - 79.36] so let's talk about it a little bit
[78.16 - 81.36] one of the reasons why i've been doing a
[79.36 - 82.80] lot of immune system stuff lately is
[81.36 - 83.68] because people are getting sick left and
[82.80 - 87.44] right right now
[83.68 - 90.00] they are getting sick and
[87.44 - 91.68] the plague is going around and people
[90.00 - 94.40] are getting sick
[91.68 - 95.68] it's happening fast so this is kind of
[94.40 - 98.64] we're heading into
[95.68 - 99.12] august so we got this whole thing going
[98.64 - 100.80] on
[99.12 - 102.80] that people are dealing with right so
[100.80 - 105.04] we're heading into august pretty soon
[102.80 - 106.80] and i said it was coming i said it was
[105.04 - 108.40] coming and in the fall
[106.80 - 111.84] it's going to be out of control going
[108.40 - 113.68] into august everybody's getting sick
[111.84 - 115.84] critical to keep your immune system
[113.68 - 117.44] strong so as a reminder before i go into
[115.84 - 119.04] how everybody's on acid and everybody's
[117.44 - 120.80] taking an acid trip and how everybody's
[119.04 - 121.84] depleted
[120.80 - 123.84] what i've been telling friends and
[121.84 - 126.88] family make sure you
[123.84 - 128.72] have your zinc i said it before the
[126.88 - 130.96] plague started
[128.72 - 131.92] and i'm saying it now so make sure you
[130.96 - 133.68] have your zinc
[131.92 - 135.12] and i went over that that's the vimergy
[133.68 - 138.24] zinc right there
[135.12 - 139.44] that's the only one i trust
[138.24 - 140.88] ask your doctor if it's right for you
[139.44 - 144.16] but i tell my friends and family make
[140.88 - 146.08] sure you have your golden seal
[144.16 - 148.64] so i say make sure you have your golden
[146.08 - 151.12] seal make sure you have your zinc
[148.64 - 151.92] so i tell my friends and my family

[153.44 - 156.00] that's the one i take and my friends and
[154.80 - 158.88] family take
[156.00 - 159.60] because in victor i m as the mary e r g

[162.64 - 166.56] seal
[163.44 - 169.04] and the zinc make sure you have it
[166.56 - 170.64] everybody's getting sick in the middle
[169.04 - 173.20] of the summer
[170.64 - 173.84] and they're getting sick and it's gonna
[173.20 - 175.92] get worse
[173.84 - 176.88] and like i said it's gonna get worse
[175.92 - 179.68] come to fall
[176.88 - 180.96] and really bad during the winter um
[179.68 - 182.40] another great thing to have for the
[180.96 - 183.68] immune system that's the lemon balm
[182.40 - 185.84] right there
[183.68 - 187.28] it's really gentle for people who you
[185.84 - 188.64] know they even have trouble taking
[187.28 - 189.52] supplements because like i said to you
[188.64 - 191.92] guys before
[189.52 - 193.12] bad supplements give supplements a bad
[191.92 - 195.04] name
[193.12 - 196.40] bad supplements give good supplements a
[195.04 - 198.64] bad name
[196.40 - 200.64] good to see you guys so that's the lemon
[198.64 - 202.40] balm yeah whether you're sick or not
[200.64 - 204.16] have it it's about building up the
[202.40 - 206.56] immune system really important cold and
[204.16 - 209.44] flu protocols and cleanse the heal
[206.56 - 210.40] now i wasn't going to make today about
[209.44 - 214.88] supps
[210.40 - 217.12] right i really wasn't going to do that
[214.88 - 218.72] but people are getting real sick and
[217.12 - 219.44] they're getting real sick fast right now
[218.72 - 220.88] out there
[219.44 - 223.20] just saying you know cleanse the heal
[220.88 - 226.64] there's a flu flu protocol
[223.20 - 230.64] cold protocol cold protocol right
[226.64 - 232.24] and there you go important to know
[230.64 - 235.28] so another one for keeping the immune
[232.24 - 236.40] system strong the microc
[235.28 - 238.80] right there it's what i give friends and
[236.40 - 241.20] family the microc
[238.80 - 243.28] so i'm giving everybody a little another
[241.20 - 245.36] little warning
[243.28 - 246.80] to make sure and and i know so many
[245.36 - 248.56] people already chronically sick
[246.80 - 250.32] chronically ill but when we have these
[248.56 - 251.36] flus going around so we got the plague
[250.32 - 253.12] going around right now
[251.36 - 254.64] and it's been cranking up and cranking
[253.12 - 255.92] up and cranking up
[254.64 - 257.68] so what i've been telling friends and
[255.92 - 259.52] family right
[257.68 - 260.96] that have been reaching out to me so
[259.52 - 262.16] what do i do what i do everybody's

[271.92 - 276.96] where are some of the baseline
[274.08 - 279.36] at least some of them right so that's
[276.96 - 282.40] important okay

[282.40 - 287.36] defense mechanism keeps the body strong

[293.52 - 298.48] magnesium calm the body which is really

[492.32 - 496.72] right now
[493.68 - 499.60] and i just wanted to give everybody a

[528.72 - 532.80] two supplements what would you recommend
[530.96 - 536.00] if it was me
[532.80 - 536.88] i would make sure i had the zinc i would
[536.00 - 540.24] make sure
[536.88 - 541.76] i had maybe some b12 it could be this
[540.24 - 544.16] the zinc can b12
[541.76 - 545.60] it could be the zinc and micro c i like
[544.16 - 551.12] that one right there
[545.60 - 551.12] okay could be the zinc and goldenseal
[551.44 - 554.64] right you can't go wrong on those as far
[553.68 - 556.08] as if it was me
[554.64 - 559.20] or my friends or family that's what i
[556.08 - 561.36] would say um
[559.20 - 562.80] so what's happening you know what's

[573.60 - 576.32] b12
[574.40 - 578.56] right about b12 and and everything about
[576.32 - 580.00] it saying xylocobalamin is not the one
[578.56 - 584.40] you want
[580.00 - 587.12] right and you know why people's b12
[584.40 - 588.00] b12 level is high and how that doesn't
[587.12 - 590.32] mean
[588.00 - 591.44] it's actually working really good even
[590.32 - 593.52] though you want it high
[591.44 - 594.80] and how you want it high right and i've
[593.52 - 596.48] been talking about a lot of things don't
[594.80 - 599.44] do b12 shots

[613.44 - 617.36] like stylo
[614.32 - 620.16] silocobalamin how it doesn't absorb into
[617.36 - 621.92] your nerves or your nervous system how
[620.16 - 624.24] you can't absorb it
[621.92 - 626.24] and so i did a post on b12 just recently

[754.64 - 759.36] getting overflowing again they're
[756.40 - 761.44] actually going to that overflowing state
[759.36 - 763.04] everybody coming in there with the cough

[766.88 - 770.88] it's hospitals are getting overrun i i
[769.68 - 773.84] know because i have nurse
[770.88 - 775.84] friends that are nurses that contact me
[773.84 - 777.12] like aw you have no idea how bad it is

[777.12 - 780.16] like no you don't i'm like well how bad
[779.60 - 782.24] is it
[780.16 - 783.92] well no it's war zones in like half the
[782.24 - 787.28] hospitals
[783.92 - 790.08] i'm like whoa
[787.28 - 790.80] so yeah it's important so that's you
[790.08 - 792.56] know
[790.80 - 794.24] so i'm like what can i do what can i do
[792.56 - 796.08] i can make a mojito salad and i can talk
[794.24 - 798.40] about all this stuff
[796.08 - 800.40] kathy why shouldn't you take b12 shot my
[798.40 - 801.76] doctor prescribes it for me i take one
[800.40 - 803.20] every month sure if your doctor
[801.76 - 805.20] prescribes it do what your doctor tells
[803.20 - 808.00] you but i would never do it
[805.20 - 808.32] and i'll tell you why it's the wrong b12
[808.00 - 810.24] that's
[808.32 - 811.44] that's one reason it's wrong b12 it's
[810.24 - 814.72] not methylcobalamin
[811.44 - 816.64] in adenosilcobalamin going to be
[814.72 - 818.08] it's going to be stylocobalamin it's
[816.64 - 819.68] going to be some other kind of b12 that
[818.08 - 821.28] doesn't work or doesn't absorb
[819.68 - 823.04] it's number one reason why i want
[821.28 - 823.60] wouldn't do it but do your doctor tell
[823.04 - 825.92] you but that's
[823.60 - 826.96] that's that's i wouldn't do it the other
[825.92 - 829.68] reason is
[826.96 - 830.40] b12 only works orally it only works
[829.68 - 832.32] orally
[830.40 - 833.60] if someone feels better right after a
[832.32 - 835.20] b12 shot that day
[833.60 - 836.80] that's the adrenaline high from getting
[835.20 - 839.04] a shot
[836.80 - 840.08] because it squirts all your adrenaline
[839.04 - 843.20] out that's what happens
[840.08 - 846.40] so when you go out to get your b12 shot
[843.20 - 849.36] when you go out to get your b12 shot
[846.40 - 850.72] you're getting an epinephrine high
[849.36 - 851.28] because when you get stuck with the
[850.72 - 856.08] needle
[851.28 - 859.84] your adrenals go
[856.08 - 862.96] they just epinephrine
[859.84 - 867.84] goes everywhere that's what happens
[862.96 - 867.84] where can i buy you those bimmerjee.com
[868.08 - 872.08] vimergy.com these and victor i m as the
[870.80 - 874.32] mary ergy
[872.08 - 875.36] dot com could also go to my supplement
[874.32 - 878.96] directory
[875.36 - 880.72] at medicalmedium.com i'm not sponsored
[878.96 - 883.12] by these guys
[880.72 - 885.68] but it's just it's just the best there
[883.12 - 887.36] is on the market in the world right now
[885.68 - 888.80] and if that changes i won't be
[887.36 - 890.88] supporting them in
[888.80 - 893.76] in doing this i'm not paid by them i'm
[890.88 - 893.76] not sponsored
[896.00 - 899.76] so what happens is that when you get too
[898.88 - 902.00] many b12
[899.76 - 903.68] shots when you get too many b12 shots
[902.00 - 906.16] right
[903.68 - 907.52] you get too many you can become allergic
[906.16 - 911.04] to b12
[907.52 - 912.16] doctors don't know this right dr stone
[911.04 - 914.16] this so first of all when you get your
[912.16 - 917.28] b12 shot the high you feel right off the
[914.16 - 919.20] running is the high from the shot
[917.28 - 920.88] that from the b12 shot because your
[919.20 - 922.16] epinephrine is squirting out of your
[920.88 - 925.84] adrenal glands
[922.16 - 927.12] because you just got the b12 injection
[925.84 - 929.52] so what happens is that
[927.12 - 932.08] and the other thing is if you have b12
[929.52 - 933.12] enter the body from the outside of the
[932.08 - 934.48] body
[933.12 - 936.72] anywhere on the outside of the body in
[934.48 - 939.04] the leg in the butt
[936.72 - 941.36] on the arm you can eventually build an
[939.04 - 943.52] allergic an allergy to it
[941.36 - 944.72] an antibody gets produced against b12
[943.52 - 947.36] you don't want to have that
[944.72 - 949.60] so i tell friends and family don't get
[947.36 - 952.72] the b12 shot
[949.60 - 952.72] do b12 orally
[952.80 - 957.52] i said i always tell friends and family
[955.68 - 958.24] ivs are different that's a different
[957.52 - 960.64] story
[958.24 - 962.48] intravenous is different story that's
[960.64 - 965.52] fine
[962.48 - 966.40] intravenous is different lucy cohn good
[965.52 - 969.04] to see you
[966.40 - 969.92] intravenous is in the vein that's in the
[969.04 - 972.80] vein
[969.92 - 973.84] right that's in your vein it's my veins
[972.80 - 977.44] on my hand here
[973.84 - 982.16] right so that's in the vein so if
[977.44 - 985.76] if they put a catheter in your vein
[982.16 - 988.72] that's an iv vitamin nutritional therapy
[985.76 - 990.64] and they stick a catheter in your vein
[988.72 - 992.72] that's different you can't build an
[990.64 - 994.48] allergic reaction to it it's different
[992.72 - 996.32] it's different when it's a shock
[994.48 - 997.60] different one is the b12 shot when it's
[996.32 - 999.36] the b12 shot it's an
[997.60 - 1002.08] entirely different situation when it's a
[999.36 - 1002.08] b12 shot
[1003.12 - 1006.40] my doctor told me i was b12 deficient
[1005.68 - 1009.28] when i was
[1006.40 - 1009.76] a meat eater and she was giving me b12
[1009.28 - 1011.60] shots
[1009.76 - 1013.36] five years ago i went plant-based and
[1011.60 - 1014.72] started the vimergy b12 and i'm no
[1013.36 - 1016.00] longer b12 deficient and one of the
[1014.72 - 1019.52] reasons why maria
[1016.00 - 1023.28] amazing maria donsky
[1019.52 - 1023.76] what's amazing is that the i hear that a
[1023.28 - 1025.76] lot
[1023.76 - 1027.04] that that's the difference with b12 with
[1025.76 - 1029.04] the vimergy b12
[1027.04 - 1030.56] and i don't hear that from with other
[1029.04 - 1032.96] b12s too by the way
[1030.56 - 1034.72] and i hear that with the vimergy b12 all
[1032.96 - 1038.08] the time
[1034.72 - 1039.36] definitely and yeah
[1038.08 - 1040.72] another thing too and we're going to

[2078.08 - 2081.20] because i know i piss off people because
[2079.68 - 2082.48] they don't want to they don't want to
[2081.20 - 2084.32] they don't want to be told they're doing
[2082.48 - 2086.48] moderation it's just pisses them off
[2084.32 - 2087.44] it's death by a thousand cuts here's a
[2086.48 - 2090.64] cut
[2087.44 - 2092.56] here's a cut right here yeah there's
[2090.64 - 2095.52] another cut
[2092.56 - 2096.72] there's another cut let's do chocolate
[2095.52 - 2097.92] cuts every day
[2096.72 - 2099.76] let's do another cut i'm gonna have
[2097.92 - 2103.84] another cut that's 5 000 cuts
[2099.76 - 2103.84] make sure we get all my my caffeine down
[2105.36 - 2109.04] all right come on guys can we get to
[2106.72 - 2109.04] work
[2109.36 - 2112.64] yes we have to get to work because
[2111.28 - 2114.08] medical medium information is about
[2112.64 - 2115.12] saving lives it always has been so we
[2114.08 - 2118.08] got to get to work
[2115.12 - 2118.64] okay look people are already at an
[2118.08 - 2121.04] unfair
[2118.64 - 2122.16] advantage they're riddled in pathogens
[2121.04 - 2125.04] epstein-barr
[2122.16 - 2126.48] sediment virus shingles hhv-6 they're
[2125.04 - 2127.20] sick with all kinds of different
[2126.48 - 2129.12] problems
[2127.20 - 2131.04] they get aches and pains and sciatica
[2129.12 - 2132.32] nerve pain and trigeminal neuralgia and
[2131.04 - 2135.36] plantar fasciitis
[2132.32 - 2138.00] skin problems it's vertigo dizziness eye
[2135.36 - 2139.28] floaters ringing in the ears
[2138.00 - 2140.64] people got enough problems because
[2139.28 - 2142.08] they're viral and they're sick so let's
[2140.64 - 2145.84] just moderation what
[2142.08 - 2145.84] how about moderation sounds real good
[2146.40 - 2149.92] viruses were released by classified
[2148.80 - 2152.16] medical industries
[2149.92 - 2153.04] years ago and our body wasn't set up for
[2152.16 - 2154.80] those
[2153.04 - 2159.84] so what moderation's gonna fix it
[2154.80 - 2159.84] moderation doesn't fix anything
[2160.88 - 2167.68] so i'm making a mojito salad
[2163.92 - 2167.68] and for some reason i went off track
[2168.24 - 2172.24] so here's what i'm making just so you
[2171.12 - 2175.84] guys know
[2172.24 - 2175.84] someone wait that doesn't look like it
[2176.32 - 2178.96] here we go
[2179.44 - 2185.60] yeah disaster relief lorraine
[2182.48 - 2187.76] everybody's on acid and everybody needs
[2185.60 - 2188.88] to get alkaline but in the proper way by
[2187.76 - 2190.12] the way that's some keto salad i'm
[2188.88 - 2194.00] making which is fruit
[2190.12 - 2197.60] antioxidants knocking down those free
[2194.00 - 2197.60] radicals right there right
[2198.24 - 2201.60] we're talking about keeping the immune
[2199.60 - 2203.28] system strong because whether anybody
[2201.60 - 2204.00] knows it or not they may not be aware
[2203.28 - 2207.52] but there is
[2204.00 - 2208.96] a vicious little bug buying around
[2207.52 - 2211.04] and people are getting hit with it
[2208.96 - 2212.64] really hard left and right
[2211.04 - 2214.16] left and right and it's setting a lot of
[2212.64 - 2215.28] people back with chronic illness it's
[2214.16 - 2217.28] cryptical
[2215.28 - 2219.12] to have the zinc so that's the vimergy
[2217.28 - 2220.48] zinc it's quick you can use
[2219.12 - 2221.52] you can do whatever your doctor tells
[2220.48 - 2222.72] you do your doctor tell you but i've
[2221.52 - 2224.48] been telling family and friends about
[2222.72 - 2226.96] the zinc the golden seal
[2224.48 - 2228.08] about the golden seal about the b12
[2226.96 - 2232.00] about the cat's claw
[2228.08 - 2232.00] how critical this is and the micro stick
[2232.56 - 2236.24] not sponsored by those guys but that was
[2234.24 - 2238.00] something i just wanna remind any
[2236.24 - 2239.28] anybody who just came on now who's like
[2238.00 - 2240.96] what's going on all right so we're
[2239.28 - 2243.84] making a salad let's do it i'm gonna get
[2240.96 - 2243.84] my knife out right now
[2245.04 - 2249.28] a couple of things i want to tell
[2246.24 - 2250.40] everybody what you look when you look
[2249.28 - 2253.60] outside in the world
[2250.40 - 2254.56] everybody's really acidic they're really
[2253.60 - 2256.96] really acidic
[2254.56 - 2258.32] they're filled with acid they're eating
[2256.96 - 2260.80] foods that create
[2258.32 - 2262.16] acid everyone is on acid they're having
[2260.80 - 2265.12] an acid trip
[2262.16 - 2266.32] the acids do damage over time it's what
[2265.12 - 2267.68] ages people
[2266.32 - 2269.04] so what people are being told when
[2267.68 - 2270.00] they're told to eat their eggs and
[2269.04 - 2273.12] they're told to eat all
[2270.00 - 2276.24] their meat i'm not against me
[2273.12 - 2279.52] for one reason is because it doesn't
[2276.24 - 2280.72] feed a pathogen but it does keep you
[2279.52 - 2283.76] really acidic
[2280.72 - 2285.28] i'm not against peanut butter for vegans
[2283.76 - 2286.88] if they want to eat it wherever the
[2285.28 - 2289.44] peanut butter went
[2286.88 - 2289.92] if they want to eat it but the problem
[2289.44 - 2293.28] is
[2289.92 - 2296.48] it still makes you really acidic fat
[2293.28 - 2300.80] makes you acidy and more
[2296.48 - 2303.04] acidy inside your body fatty acids
[2300.80 - 2304.72] fatty acids everybody's fatting
[2303.04 - 2308.16] themselves to death
[2304.72 - 2308.40] it's all that fat and and that fat makes
[2308.16 - 2310.56] you
[2308.40 - 2312.64] really really acidic so whether you're
[2310.56 - 2314.72] an animal protein dude or gal and you're
[2312.64 - 2316.80] doing the animal proteins left and right
[2314.72 - 2319.04] where you're a vegan plant-based dude or
[2316.80 - 2322.00] gal and you're doing all the nut butters
[2319.04 - 2323.92] and the oils you're making yourself
[2322.00 - 2325.36] acidic all the time so then when
[2323.92 - 2328.40] pathogens come around
[2325.36 - 2331.44] like the plague you're more susceptible
[2328.40 - 2333.84] because acids also deplete us
[2331.44 - 2336.56] of all those minerals of all those
[2333.84 - 2338.56] vitamins and nutrients they deplete us
[2336.56 - 2340.16] okay sure an avocado's healthy it gives
[2338.56 - 2340.56] you some vitamins and nutrients but you
[2340.16 - 2342.72] lose
[2340.56 - 2344.40] more of them because when you overeat
[2342.72 - 2348.40] avocado the fat
[2344.40 - 2349.44] causes a depletion all the fatty acid
[2348.40 - 2351.60] so when you're saying well you know
[2349.44 - 2354.64] sunflower seeds are really you know
[2351.60 - 2357.68] really healthy it's a healthy fat
[2354.64 - 2359.52] but when we're eating too much of them
[2357.68 - 2360.96] while we're eating other fats and we're
[2359.52 - 2362.72] eating the nuts the seeds the nut
[2360.96 - 2363.52] butters the fats the peanut butters the
[2362.72 - 2365.52] chocolate
[2363.52 - 2367.36] the chicken the fish the meat we're
[2365.52 - 2369.76] always fatted out and then we get
[2367.36 - 2371.28] depleted we're running on acid
[2369.76 - 2372.80] we're living on acid we're having an
[2371.28 - 2375.12] acid trip i'm going to chop up some
[2372.80 - 2377.92] strawberries here
[2375.12 - 2378.56] and that that's where we that's where it
[2377.92 - 2381.52] gets us
[2378.56 - 2382.64] right so i'm doing a little strawberry
[2381.52 - 2386.00] chopping
[2382.64 - 2387.68] okay so i'm cutting these
[2386.00 - 2389.52] uh strawberry pieces up i'm gonna throw
[2387.68 - 2391.52] i'm gonna mix this bowl of fruit in a
[2389.52 - 2395.20] little bit too so i'm putting
[2391.52 - 2397.04] strawberries in here i get it there's
[2395.20 - 2399.12] fruit fear out there people are afraid
[2397.04 - 2400.72] of fruit fruit isn't why people are sick
[2399.12 - 2403.04] keep that in mind you guys
[2400.72 - 2404.24] so important to know keep that in mind
[2403.04 - 2407.60] fruit isn't why
[2404.24 - 2410.64] people are sick it's not fruit
[2407.60 - 2413.68] it's pathogens it's metals right
[2410.64 - 2415.20] and then it's not eating or drinking the
[2413.68 - 2419.68] right things to
[2415.20 - 2419.68] to help your body assisted in healing
[2420.56 - 2425.84] important to know
[2426.96 - 2430.88] so i'm making this right here i'm
[2428.40 - 2432.16] chopping up some strawberries
[2430.88 - 2436.80] what you're gonna find in the health
[2432.16 - 2436.80] scene is everybody demonizes
[2436.84 - 2440.72] fruit
[2438.48 - 2442.56] fruit is not why someone's in a dentist
[2440.72 - 2444.40] chair are you kidding me
[2442.56 - 2446.56] it's from chocolate all the chocolate
[2444.40 - 2448.80] they've been eating all these years
[2446.56 - 2451.36] it's from the caffeine dissolving teeth
[2448.80 - 2452.96] over time
[2451.36 - 2455.28] let me tell you something about caffeine
[2452.96 - 2458.96] not only is it tremendously acidic
[2455.28 - 2459.44] in the body all right but it depletes
[2458.96 - 2462.00] you of
[2459.44 - 2463.76] every nutrient that you have that's
[2462.00 - 2467.28] available
[2463.76 - 2468.00] it depletes it squeezes it right out of
[2467.28 - 2470.56] you
[2468.00 - 2471.04] vinegar does the same thing it depletes
[2470.56 - 2474.32] you
[2471.04 - 2475.92] so we walk around to pleat it right
[2474.32 - 2481.84] so i'm chopping up some strawberries
[2475.92 - 2481.84] right here okay
[2487.84 - 2494.32] leads to bone loss tooth enamel
[2492.08 - 2498.88] leeches calcium out of you that's what
[2494.32 - 2498.88] it does it leeches all the calcium out
[2502.56 - 2507.84] that's what it does what happens is you
[2505.60 - 2509.92] end up becoming a buffer for all the
[2507.84 - 2511.36] poison you're putting inside of you you
[2509.92 - 2514.40] become a buffer
[2511.36 - 2515.44] you know what that is you become the
[2514.40 - 2518.24] buffer
[2515.44 - 2520.00] your bones become the buffer to save
[2518.24 - 2521.68] your life
[2520.00 - 2523.12] so you want to keep on you you're going
[2521.68 - 2524.40] to be on all that acid you're going to
[2523.12 - 2526.48] be on the peanut butter you're going to
[2524.40 - 2528.88] be on nuts and seeds all the time
[2526.48 - 2530.00] healthy fats are okay have a little bit
[2528.88 - 2532.64] here and there right
[2530.00 - 2535.04] little touch of it here and there but
[2532.64 - 2536.16] people are drowning themselves in it is
[2535.04 - 2538.16] what's happening
[2536.16 - 2539.92] so then we lose our bones we lose our
[2538.16 - 2542.00] skeleton frame we lose it we get
[2539.92 - 2542.72] osteopenia osteoporosis you don't even
[2542.00 - 2545.36] see it your
[2542.72 - 2547.04] your bones get porous your teeth get
[2545.36 - 2548.16] porous and then they start collapsing
[2547.04 - 2549.60] later on
[2548.16 - 2551.04] you're fine in your 20s and you're
[2549.60 - 2551.92] drinking your coffee and your caffeine
[2551.04 - 2553.44] and you're doing your thing and you're
[2551.92 - 2554.72] doing your functional medicine stuff and
[2553.44 - 2556.08] you're doing your probiotic and you
[2554.72 - 2557.52] think you're totally on it you're doing
[2556.08 - 2560.64] your little avocado toast
[2557.52 - 2562.48] and boom later on your skin age is fast
[2560.64 - 2563.92] you got to get botox left in right
[2562.48 - 2564.72] because people are getting botox left
[2563.92 - 2566.32] and right
[2564.72 - 2567.76] your teeth start to fall apart and then
[2566.32 - 2569.20] you got to get all the veneers and all
[2567.76 - 2572.64] the other stuff and the implants and
[2569.20 - 2576.40] stuff people don't realize it
[2572.64 - 2579.60] dino says does natural alkaline water
[2576.40 - 2582.24] ph 9.5 okay to drink
[2579.60 - 2583.84] does that help with the body's acid is
[2582.24 - 2586.00] it natural coming out of an
[2583.84 - 2587.28] aquifer is it natural coming out of a
[2586.00 - 2589.52] spring
[2587.28 - 2591.44] so if you have a high ph water coming
[2589.52 - 2593.76] out of a spring you can drink it it
[2591.44 - 2596.56] wasn't manufactured
[2593.76 - 2596.96] that's different that's different you
[2596.56 - 2599.04] don't
[2596.96 - 2600.96] have to have alkaline water that's
[2599.04 - 2602.80] coming out of aquifer or spring
[2600.96 - 2604.84] in order to heal and stay alkaline just
[2602.80 - 2606.40] need some leafy greens and some celery
[2604.84 - 2609.04] juice right
[2606.40 - 2609.68] yes from a spring then it's okay from a
[2609.04 - 2611.60] spring
[2609.68 - 2613.04] then it's okay all right it's not
[2611.60 - 2614.64] manufactured
[2613.04 - 2616.96] exactly it's very important to know it
[2614.64 - 2619.36] wasn't manipulated the water wasn't
[2616.96 - 2620.32] manipulated it wasn't manufactured keep
[2619.36 - 2622.40] that in mind that's
[2620.32 - 2623.76] that's why it's okay sadino that's okay
[2622.40 - 2625.20] good to see you dina
[2623.76 - 2626.88] i see you leave comments on youtube
[2625.20 - 2630.56] every now and then
[2626.88 - 2633.44] um so what happens is we're so acidy out
[2630.56 - 2634.00] if that even makes sense like a word
[2633.44 - 2636.16] we're so
[2634.00 - 2638.00] drowning in our own assets because it's
[2636.16 - 2639.68] created by all the stuff we're also
[2638.00 - 2641.76] eating and then the stress adds to it
[2639.68 - 2642.08] from all adrenaline here's what happens
[2641.76 - 2643.60] too
[2642.08 - 2645.12] when you do your caffeine and you do
[2643.60 - 2646.72] your coffee and you do your chocolate
[2645.12 - 2648.64] you're on a psychoactive drug which
[2646.72 - 2650.48] triggers off your adrenals and now
[2648.64 - 2652.48] epinephrine is flooding your system and
[2650.48 - 2654.64] epinephrine is acidic
[2652.48 - 2656.88] and it starts to burn your nerves and
[2654.64 - 2660.84] bones over time
[2656.88 - 2662.56] right if anybody's going to talk about
[2660.84 - 2665.60] moderation
[2662.56 - 2666.40] talk about making sure that you slow
[2665.60 - 2668.88] down or
[2666.40 - 2670.40] bring to a halt eventually some of those
[2668.88 - 2672.72] bad things
[2670.40 - 2673.84] nutritional yeast all that msg blows out
[2672.72 - 2676.88] your brain
[2673.84 - 2678.40] blows out your brain stem msg's so toxic
[2676.88 - 2679.84] to your brain you guys it builds up and
[2678.40 - 2681.36] it builds up and it builds up
[2679.84 - 2683.04] so i talk about all those toxic
[2681.36 - 2684.88] supplements that have natural flavorings
[2683.04 - 2688.08] and flavor and flavors in it
[2684.88 - 2690.08] all that stuff that's all msg elio
[2688.08 - 2692.64] how do i get my protein to build muscle
[2690.08 - 2695.28] mass if i don't eat chicken turkey or
[2692.64 - 2698.40] meat sounds like you've never read one
[2695.28 - 2698.40] thing from medical medium
[2698.56 - 2702.48] sounds like you know that's a good
[2701.04 - 2703.68] question though okay
[2702.48 - 2706.48] that that's that's a really good

[2717.76 - 2719.92] protein
[2718.32 - 2723.36] need to build muscle meat protein i
[2719.92 - 2723.36] shall kill a pig eat a pig
[2726.48 - 2729.84] yellow fish protein my protein protein

[2729.84 - 2734.08] trunky robot protein breaking build
[2732.32 - 2735.12] muscle make me strong protein make me
[2734.08 - 2736.56] strong make me strong
[2735.12 - 2738.40] give me strength protein heals me
[2736.56 - 2739.04] protein heals me everybody says protein
[2738.40 - 2741.84] protein
[2739.04 - 2741.84] rub kill the cow
[2742.72 - 2746.96] chicken chicken kill the chicken brookie
[2754.40 - 2757.28] here's how it works
[2759.28 - 2762.72] i don't think that was the best robot
[2760.64 - 2766.40] but whatever
[2762.72 - 2769.92] okay protein
[2766.40 - 2774.16] doesn't kill off a pathogen that's
[2769.92 - 2777.84] weakening you right protein
[2774.16 - 2782.40] doesn't give you nutrients
[2777.84 - 2786.64] minerals antioxidants protein
[2782.40 - 2788.96] doesn't even build muscle it doesn't
[2786.64 - 2790.32] what builds muscle is glucose and
[2788.96 - 2793.20] mineral salts
[2790.32 - 2794.88] that's it builds muscle so you gotta
[2793.20 - 2796.24] have sugar to build muscle
[2794.88 - 2798.08] you know what happens here's i'm gonna
[2796.24 - 2800.40] tell you right now okay
[2798.08 - 2801.60] when someone's sick with chronic illness
[2800.40 - 2802.96] right
[2801.60 - 2805.60] when someone's actually sick with
[2802.96 - 2808.96] chronic illness and
[2805.60 - 2811.36] they're wasting away because they got
[2808.96 - 2813.28] me cfs they got chronic fatigue syndrome
[2811.36 - 2815.44] they got fibromyalgia so they can't
[2813.28 - 2817.04] they can't work out and they're losing
[2815.44 - 2820.24] muscle
[2817.04 - 2823.12] the worst thing ever for them
[2820.24 - 2824.48] is to get caught up in the protein law
[2823.12 - 2828.00] that protein law
[2824.48 - 2831.04] will kill them i have watched doctors
[2828.00 - 2834.64] contact me over the last 35 years
[2831.04 - 2837.60] telling me aw i got a patient bed ridden
[2834.64 - 2838.40] they're atrophying what are you feeding
[2837.60 - 2840.08] them
[2838.40 - 2841.52] feeding them lots of protein you're
[2840.08 - 2843.68] gonna kill them quick
[2841.52 - 2844.96] you're gonna kill the person quick
[2843.68 - 2846.88] they're gonna die
[2844.96 - 2848.24] what do you mean die they need protein
[2846.88 - 2850.40] they have no muscles
[2848.24 - 2851.32] they're laying in bed sick you're gonna
[2850.40 - 2854.08] kill them
[2851.32 - 2855.52] carbohydrates build a muscle if they're
[2854.08 - 2857.28] in bed and they're bedridden you better
[2855.52 - 2859.12] be giving them bananas you better be
[2857.28 - 2860.96] giving them potatoes you better be
[2859.12 - 2864.00] giving them some fruit
[2860.96 - 2865.92] yeah you better because you in order to
[2864.00 - 2867.12] build a muscle you have to have two
[2865.92 - 2869.20] components one is
[2867.12 - 2870.64] a carbohydrate to go into the muscle
[2869.20 - 2873.28] cells
[2870.64 - 2874.16] to sustain it so it doesn't atrophy the
[2873.28 - 2875.52] other thing is
[2874.16 - 2876.88] you got to be able to use your muscle
[2875.52 - 2878.24] and when you're chronically ill you
[2876.88 - 2880.16] can't use your muscle
[2878.24 - 2883.28] so then you better at least have that
[2880.16 - 2885.76] carbohydrate available
[2883.28 - 2886.56] it's why people have to do that bulk and
[2885.76 - 2888.64] cutting thing
[2886.56 - 2891.28] they have to bring in the carbs to bulk
[2888.64 - 2893.60] up all those weight lifter dudes
[2891.28 - 2894.32] even pros that reach out to me that are
[2893.60 - 2896.72] on the scene
[2894.32 - 2897.92] in their pros they reach out because
[2896.72 - 2900.32] you're like what do i do
[2897.92 - 2902.08] you're missing the carbs because if you
[2900.32 - 2902.64] want to go and try to build your muscle
[2902.08 - 2905.20] on just
[2902.64 - 2906.56] fat and animal protein you're not going
[2905.20 - 2908.88] to sustain those muscles
[2906.56 - 2910.24] and so what they do is they bulk up by
[2908.88 - 2911.92] adding the carbs in
[2910.24 - 2913.60] that's the bulking and cutting the
[2911.92 - 2915.20] reason why they're bulking is because
[2913.60 - 2917.60] they're adding the carbs in
[2915.20 - 2918.64] that's what's making them bulk up that's
[2917.60 - 2921.44] the whole point
[2918.64 - 2922.16] and then when they drop back the carbs
[2921.44 - 2924.64] and they drop
[2922.16 - 2926.56] drop back the calories they drop
[2924.64 - 2929.20] everything down their portions
[2926.56 - 2931.36] they they try to lose a little bit that
[2929.20 - 2934.40] excess fat
[2931.36 - 2935.84] but they still get fat from the fat
[2934.40 - 2937.44] but then they get stuck because they're
[2935.84 - 2937.84] losing muscle so then they have to do
[2937.44 - 2940.08] the
[2937.84 - 2941.60] carbs again they do the bulking and
[2940.08 - 2943.36] cutting
[2941.60 - 2945.20] what's giving them the bulk in their
[2943.36 - 2947.44] muscle is the carb
[2945.20 - 2948.88] aspect it's the carb it's not the
[2947.44 - 2951.68] protein
[2948.88 - 2953.12] because the brain washing is insane
[2951.68 - 2955.76] reclaims the heal
[2953.12 - 2956.88] it's a great question though okay
[2955.76 - 2959.76] re-cleanse the heel
[2956.88 - 2962.80] well medical medium book one new
[2959.76 - 2965.28] addition cleanse the heel
[2962.80 - 2971.84] read that one too how about that read
[2965.28 - 2971.84] that one too
[2978.40 - 2982.84] okay you guys let's go so we got the
[2980.16 - 2985.60] strawberries in here
[2982.84 - 2989.04] right
[2985.60 - 2990.40] people are afraid of fruit just afraid
[2989.04 - 2993.20] of fruit
[2990.40 - 2995.20] it's so sad got some blackberries now
[2993.20 - 2996.16] you can pop these blackberries whole i
[2995.20 - 2999.28] like to do that
[2996.16 - 3001.68] can you please explain how people
[2999.28 - 3004.40] keller peterson is still alive eating
[3001.68 - 3007.20] just beef for years
[3004.40 - 3009.36] yeah i could easily explain that okay a
[3007.20 - 3010.72] couple of things to understand
[3009.36 - 3012.48] you don't know what people eat behind
[3010.72 - 3013.92] closed doors do i have to be the fly on
[3012.48 - 3016.48] the wall right now
[3013.92 - 3018.48] do you have to be the fly in the wall
[3016.48 - 3020.80] how many people lie on social media
[3018.48 - 3022.56] do many people lie in the industry do
[3020.80 - 3025.12] many people lie on instagram
[3022.56 - 3026.08] do many people lie on facebook do many
[3025.12 - 3028.16] people lie on
[3026.08 - 3029.36] youtube you don't know what they're
[3028.16 - 3030.48] eating and what you don't know they're
[3029.36 - 3031.52] eating
[3030.48 - 3032.96] they can sit there and tell you they're
[3031.52 - 3034.32] eating beef the whole time and you'll
[3032.96 - 3035.52] get you know what this reminds me of the
[3034.32 - 3039.04] story
[3035.52 - 3040.32] of the famous clinic that was anti-fruit
[3039.04 - 3042.80] and anti-sugar
[3040.32 - 3044.16] a famous clinic just so you know and
[3042.80 - 3046.72] that famous clinic is still
[3044.16 - 3047.44] out there and the head of that famous
[3046.72 - 3051.12] clinic
[3047.44 - 3051.76] was caught by the chef at 12 o'clock at
[3051.12 - 3053.28] night
[3051.76 - 3055.44] reaching into the refrigerator in the
[3053.28 - 3057.92] kitchen when everybody was in bed
[3055.44 - 3058.96] on the in the clinic it was a retreat
[3057.92 - 3060.88] that
[3058.96 - 3062.72] purse that owner of that clinic the head
[3060.88 - 3066.24] of that clinic was caught
[3062.72 - 3068.08] reaching for a whole bag of dried fruit
[3066.24 - 3069.76] a big bag of dried fruit in the
[3068.08 - 3072.88] refrigerator at this clinic
[3069.76 - 3073.36] and was gobbling down dates and an app
[3072.88 - 3076.72] dried
[3073.36 - 3077.60] apricot and dried mango but yet telling
[3076.72 - 3080.16] everybody
[3077.60 - 3081.28] for years that fruit is a curse he
[3080.16 - 3084.56] doesn't eat fruit
[3081.28 - 3087.20] he's com he's on only animal protein
[3084.56 - 3088.64] and the dude the owner of the clinic was
[3087.20 - 3090.56] caught by the chef
[3088.64 - 3091.92] that knows me personally and knows a
[3090.56 - 3092.64] bunch of other people and told a bunch
[3091.92 - 3094.00] of people
[3092.64 - 3095.84] the dude was in there in the
[3094.00 - 3097.04] refrigerator trying to gobble down all
[3095.84 - 3100.48] that dried fruit in the middle of the
[3097.04 - 3100.48] night was caught at midnight
[3101.92 - 3107.12] how about that why is everybody just so
[3105.60 - 3110.88] gullible it's just easy to
[3107.12 - 3112.32] just fall into the bs
[3110.88 - 3114.24] it's not enough truth out there and
[3112.32 - 3116.32] there's too much bs
[3114.24 - 3118.64] it's just sad this is heartbreaking
[3116.32 - 3118.64] really
[3119.52 - 3123.12] so i'm going to throw some raspberries
[3120.80 - 3123.12] in here
[3123.20 - 3129.76] better take more blood pressure medicine
[3126.48 - 3132.80] and some cholesterol medicine you can
[3129.76 - 3135.60] you can you can live on meat
[3132.80 - 3137.12] yeah but eventually if it's just me and
[3135.60 - 3138.64] i'm not anti-meat if someone wants to be
[3137.12 - 3140.16] on meat i'm just i'm
[3138.64 - 3141.36] i want to make sure if someone's animal
[3140.16 - 3142.16] protein i'm not against an animal
[3141.36 - 3143.52] protein people
[3142.16 - 3145.44] i'm not against vegans people think i
[3143.52 - 3147.36] hate vegans
[3145.44 - 3149.44] and i know vegans hate me because
[3147.36 - 3150.56] they're like oh he doesn't know anything
[3149.44 - 3152.56] about veganism
[3150.56 - 3154.08] okay sure more people healed and chronic
[3152.56 - 3155.36] illness ever before in history because
[3154.08 - 3156.16] of medical media information but i don't
[3155.36 - 3157.36] know nothing
[3156.16 - 3159.52] most powerful people in the world
[3157.36 - 3161.04] reaching out to me every day
[3159.52 - 3163.04] just most powerful people in the world
[3161.04 - 3164.72] knocking on my door constantly
[3163.04 - 3167.36] will we have to like fend them off
[3164.72 - 3169.04] because i got just too much going on
[3167.36 - 3170.08] because they've seen the 50 doctors and
[3169.04 - 3171.68] the best neurologists and they take
[3170.08 - 3173.04] their private jets all around the planet
[3171.68 - 3174.40] all around the globe their private jets
[3173.04 - 3175.60] doing every therapy possible and they're
[3174.40 - 3178.80] knocking on my door
[3175.60 - 3178.80] sure i don't know anything about
[3178.84 - 3181.84] veganism
[3188.80 - 3192.24] and then people steal medical medium
[3190.24 - 3194.24] information left and right and they plug
[3192.24 - 3196.08] it into everything
[3194.24 - 3197.28] so you'll have vegans actually being
[3196.08 - 3198.40] saying oh medical medium doesn't know
[3197.28 - 3199.76] anything meanwhile they're using medical
[3198.40 - 3201.76] medium tools that were given to the
[3199.76 - 3202.80] vegan community in the last 35 years
[3201.76 - 3204.32] from
[3202.80 - 3205.52] me and not from science and research
[3204.32 - 3208.32] because science research didn't have the
[3205.52 - 3209.76] info so where did the info come from
[3208.32 - 3211.36] i'm the only one hearing a voice that
[3209.76 - 3213.04] brought in advanced medical medical
[3211.36 - 3214.80] information into the world
[3213.04 - 3216.32] i've also lectured on the scene for
[3214.80 - 3218.00] years teaching people
[3216.32 - 3219.68] and even science research skills medical
[3218.00 - 3223.84] medium information
[3219.68 - 3223.84] all the time put some grapes in here
[3224.64 - 3231.04] do not mono eat grapes
[3228.16 - 3231.60] okay grapes that they're a medicinal
[3231.04 - 3236.00] food
[3231.60 - 3238.32] absolutely don't mono eat grapes
[3236.00 - 3240.08] don't mono eat blackberries don't just
[3238.32 - 3243.04] eat blackberries for weeks and weeks and
[3240.08 - 3243.04] weeks and no other food
[3243.52 - 3251.84] it's too astringent too cleansing
[3251.92 - 3256.84] but you can have grapes every day what
[3254.80 - 3258.00] you're looking right here is antivirals
[3256.84 - 3262.16] antibacterials
[3258.00 - 3262.16] anti pathogens anti
[3262.84 - 3266.32] oxidants
[3264.56 - 3268.00] so i'm making some fruit salad here
[3266.32 - 3271.84] minerals trace minerals
[3268.00 - 3271.84] macro minerals right
[3272.48 - 3275.20] glucose
[3276.84 - 3279.84] so
[3280.00 - 3283.44] all right let's keep on going a little
[3281.36 - 3285.92] bit
[3283.44 - 3287.60] now what people have to understand
[3285.92 - 3289.36] something there is sugar in meat
[3287.60 - 3291.36] the animal has its own blood sugar the
[3289.36 - 3293.20] animal eats grass say you got a cow and
[3291.36 - 3297.04] the cow is eating grass right
[3293.20 - 3300.08] so say your cow is eating grass okay
[3297.04 - 3303.48] right all that sugar from
[3300.08 - 3307.20] the grass gets
[3303.48 - 3309.84] concentrated into the cow's blood
[3307.20 - 3311.68] and then the blood that's in the meat is
[3309.84 - 3315.92] sugar so you can
[3311.68 - 3318.84] you could live on meat by itself
[3315.92 - 3321.60] you could but it's still not enough
[3318.84 - 3324.16] glucose you can do it for a while
[3321.60 - 3325.44] but you can't do it long term especially
[3324.16 - 3326.80] if you're sick and your neurological
[3325.44 - 3328.56] system is compromised
[3326.80 - 3331.12] if you're some dude and you haven't been
[3328.56 - 3333.20] sick yet you've got nothing going on
[3331.12 - 3335.36] you get a sniffle once every couple of
[3333.20 - 3336.40] years you haven't had pathogens affect
[3335.36 - 3337.12] you yet because you haven't gotten the
[3336.40 - 3338.64] pathogens
[3337.12 - 3341.52] you haven't gotten enough heavy metals
[3338.64 - 3343.36] yet you haven't had any of that right
[3341.52 - 3345.76] and you haven't been sick yet so say
[3343.36 - 3347.52] you're a dude that hasn't been sick yet
[3345.76 - 3349.84] you will but you haven't been sick now
[3347.52 - 3351.68] yet you're young you're 20 years old
[3349.84 - 3353.92] right you're in the gym you're working
[3351.68 - 3355.76] out you can be on meat for a little
[3353.92 - 3357.20] while and not see a decline
[3355.76 - 3359.92] yet but eventually you'll just see a
[3357.20 - 3361.12] decline after just six months being just
[3359.92 - 3362.08] on need alone you're going to see
[3361.12 - 3363.84] decline in your muscles
[3362.08 - 3365.84] you'll start losing your muscle mass
[3363.84 - 3367.20] start going away be 20 years old say why
[3365.84 - 3369.60] am i not building muscles you start
[3367.20 - 3371.68] losing your muscle mass
[3369.60 - 3374.80] and you start aging fast too your skin
[3371.68 - 3375.84] turns to you just start aging fast
[3374.80 - 3377.44] that's what's happening though why do
[3375.84 - 3378.64] you think the carnivore movement put in
[3377.44 - 3380.48] honey did you guys know that
[3378.64 - 3382.48] carnivore movement why did you need
[3380.48 - 3384.88] honey i'm that's a head scratcher for me
[3382.48 - 3386.64] um carnivore movement completely
[3384.88 - 3387.20] anti-sugary anti-fruit anti-anything
[3386.64 - 3388.96] sweet
[3387.20 - 3390.80] scratching my head a little bit on that
[3388.96 - 3393.44] why did you guys bring in honey
[3390.80 - 3394.80] recently hmm because you guys were
[3393.44 - 3396.96] sucking it out
[3394.80 - 3398.80] you guys were struggling because you
[3396.96 - 3400.56] were noticing too many people could not
[3398.80 - 3401.04] handle it and do it they were binging on
[3400.56 - 3403.20] carbs
[3401.04 - 3405.04] yeah i'm on the carnivore diet let me
[3403.20 - 3406.32] just feed on a whole bunch of yeah i'm
[3405.04 - 3408.24] on the carnivore diet
[3406.32 - 3409.92] but i'm just not going to tell my
[3408.24 - 3412.08] carnivore teacher what i'm doing here
[3409.92 - 3414.96] yeah i'm on a carnivore time
[3412.08 - 3415.92] okay back on the carnivore diet they
[3414.96 - 3418.80] needed sugar
[3415.92 - 3419.68] so they put honey in the carnivore diet
[3418.80 - 3421.92] teresa
[3419.68 - 3422.88] how's diabetes happening then too much
[3421.92 - 3425.44] bad sugar
[3422.88 - 3426.88] bad sugar sugar has nothing to do with
[3425.44 - 3428.56] diabetes
[3426.88 - 3431.12] besides diabetics need sugar to stay
[3428.56 - 3434.80] alive is that interesting
[3431.12 - 3438.24] a diabetic needs sugar to stay alive
[3434.80 - 3438.96] okay you find you find a type 1 diabetic
[3438.24 - 3441.36] on a bus
[3438.96 - 3443.12] passed out you better get some orange
[3441.36 - 3446.00] juice to the lips as fast as possible or
[3443.12 - 3448.88] they're going to go into a coma
[3446.00 - 3450.32] why is sugar the problem with diabetes
[3448.88 - 3453.76] it's fat
[3450.32 - 3455.36] it's fat fat is how you get insulin
[3453.76 - 3457.28] resistance fat is what kills the
[3455.36 - 3460.24] pancreas it's not sugar
[3457.28 - 3462.24] you can't have sugar and fat together
[3460.24 - 3463.76] because the fat ruins everything it
[3462.24 - 3465.04] stops the sugar from going into your
[3463.76 - 3466.48] cells it's not sugar that causes
[3465.04 - 3467.68] diabetes you guys it's the fat that
[3466.48 - 3469.04] causes diabetes
[3467.68 - 3470.40] originally that's all medical medium
[3469.04 - 3471.52] information going back years ago now
[3470.40 - 3472.88] there's a whole bunch of people
[3471.52 - 3474.64] practicing that there's doctors
[3472.88 - 3476.32] practicing that there's there's all
[3474.64 - 3476.88] kinds of people out there talking about
[3476.32 - 3480.72] it
[3476.88 - 3482.56] sugar okay gets blocked from the fat so
[3480.72 - 3483.92] it can't enter into your cells so then
[3482.56 - 3485.20] you can't get the glucose you need and
[3483.92 - 3486.84] then as a diabetic
[3485.20 - 3489.28] or somebody with hypoglycemia and
[3486.84 - 3491.20] hyperglycemia you get just all screwed
[3489.28 - 3492.80] up because the sugar is blocked it's not
[3491.20 - 3494.72] getting into the cells
[3492.80 - 3496.48] it's not getting into the cells it's the
[3494.72 - 3498.32] fat in this that gets you you see this
[3496.48 - 3499.76] you guys it's the fat inside of this
[3498.32 - 3502.32] that gets you
[3499.76 - 3504.00] fat is in ice cream it's not the sugar
[3502.32 - 3505.12] in ice cream it's fat that's in ice
[3504.00 - 3507.68] cream
[3505.12 - 3508.40] and guess what back to the back to the
[3507.68 - 3510.80] whole
[3508.40 - 3512.16] moral of the story or whatever back to
[3510.80 - 3515.52] the whole story is
[3512.16 - 3516.64] we're acidic we're on acid because we're
[3515.52 - 3519.44] doing so much
[3516.64 - 3522.80] fat we're we're on so much acid we're
[3519.44 - 3525.68] tripping every day on acid

[3861.20 - 3864.32] doing celery juice for two months now
[3863.28 - 3867.12] frustrated
[3864.32 - 3868.72] so i want you to be your own detective
[3867.12 - 3870.72] how much celery juice
[3868.72 - 3872.32] what else are you doing if you have the
[3870.72 - 3872.80] chocolate the caffeine the vinegars in
[3872.32 - 3874.56] there
[3872.80 - 3876.64] how much dairy are you doing are you
[3874.56 - 3880.16] doing the the eggs
[3876.64 - 3882.24] any eggs happening okay all these matter
[3880.16 - 3884.24] is your celery juice high pressure
[3882.24 - 3885.84] pasteurized because
[3884.24 - 3888.16] high pressure pasteurized which is the
[3885.84 - 3889.84] bad stuff hpp
[3888.16 - 3891.20] does your cellar juice have lemon in it
[3889.84 - 3892.80] does it have ice in it does have water
[3891.20 - 3894.32] in it these are all bad things is it 32
[3892.80 - 3895.12] ounces celery juice or eight ounces of
[3894.32 - 3898.08] celery juice
[3895.12 - 3899.44] i want you to be your own detective is
[3898.08 - 3900.96] anybody out there jumping into new
[3899.44 - 3902.40] medical treatments right like you said
[3900.96 - 3903.28] no new medical treatments are offered
[3902.40 - 3905.60] all the time
[3903.28 - 3907.44] sometimes even most of the time new
[3905.60 - 3909.12] medical treatments set people back
[3907.44 - 3910.48] and then they're doing that at the same
[3909.12 - 3911.84] time they're trying to do something good
[3910.48 - 3913.12] and they can't see the results yet
[3911.84 - 3915.04] because they've already done something
[3913.12 - 3916.80] that wasn't good
[3915.04 - 3918.48] it happens neurological line like the
[3916.80 - 3919.04] medical treatments for neurological lyme
[3918.48 - 3921.36] is just
[3919.04 - 3922.08] hammering them with antibiotics
[3921.36 - 3924.32] antibiotics
[3922.08 - 3925.36] antibiotics i can't tell you how many
[3924.32 - 3927.04] people they're
[3925.36 - 3928.56] they're they get their neurological lyme
[3927.04 - 3929.84] diagnosis and then they're at the
[3928.56 - 3932.40] doctor's office and they're both
[3929.84 - 3933.68] slamming them with antibiotics the worst
[3932.40 - 3934.88] kind of antibiotics
[3933.68 - 3937.28] and then they're like why isn't my
[3934.88 - 3938.88] celery juice helping why isn't my
[3937.28 - 3940.80] why isn't my eight ounces of celery
[3938.88 - 3942.16] juice helping and how many blood draws i
[3940.80 - 3944.32] want everybody to be their own detective
[3942.16 - 3945.84] how many blood draws is someone getting
[3944.32 - 3947.52] because if you're getting blood draws
[3945.84 - 3949.44] you just had another blood test
[3947.52 - 3951.12] boom you've just been set back because
[3949.44 - 3952.56] they'll take they'll they'll drain you
[3951.12 - 3955.68] to death
[3952.56 - 3958.24] they'll drain someone to death people
[3955.68 - 3960.16] you people get cancer they take blood
[3958.24 - 3961.68] from you every week until you did you
[3960.16 - 3962.72] literally take everything out of your
[3961.68 - 3964.08] whole immune system you didn't even
[3962.72 - 3968.08] stand a chance the way they
[3964.08 - 3970.24] drain your blood so it's um unbelievable
[3968.08 - 3972.32] another thing people get new bugs they
[3970.24 - 3974.48] get new bugs happening
[3972.32 - 3976.48] and they need to go further to clean up
[3974.48 - 3979.12] their strap in their epstein bars
[3976.48 - 3980.72] so they don't get much worse also you
[3979.12 - 3981.36] may not be recovering from a small
[3980.72 - 3983.52] amount of
[3981.36 - 3985.76] celery juice yet but is it keeping you
[3983.52 - 3987.76] from getting worse
[3985.76 - 3989.12] keep that like in the detective hat
[3987.76 - 3990.80] right there is it keeping you from
[3989.12 - 3993.76] getting worse
[3990.80 - 3995.68] and then you just need to go further
[3993.76 - 3997.12] meanwhile it's stopping you from getting
[3995.68 - 3999.28] worse
[3997.12 - 4000.88] right keep that in in the bonnet right
[3999.28 - 4003.12] there your detective bonnet
[4000.88 - 4004.56] okay really important did you learn the
[4003.12 - 4006.00] true cause of why you're sick did you
[4004.56 - 4007.60] take your symptoms
[4006.00 - 4010.72] did you take your symptoms to the
[4007.60 - 4012.24] medical medium library
[4010.72 - 4013.76] did you take your symptom to the medical
[4012.24 - 4015.76] medium cleanse the heal book
[4013.76 - 4017.52] learn why you're sick and then you see
