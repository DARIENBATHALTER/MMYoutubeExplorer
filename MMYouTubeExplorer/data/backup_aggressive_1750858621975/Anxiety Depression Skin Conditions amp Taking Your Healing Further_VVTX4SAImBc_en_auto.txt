[300.48 - 305.44] details matter
[301.60 - 308.00] when do you have any help on long covet
[305.44 - 309.76] if you look at this book right here
[308.00 - 310.80] there's a whole section on that just so
[309.76 - 312.64] you know
[310.80 - 314.08] and long cove it actually stems from
[312.64 - 315.68] medical medium that's where it's first
[314.08 - 317.60] published and that's where it originates
[315.68 - 320.40] from meaning the concept
[317.60 - 322.56] of long covers actually comes from the
[320.40 - 325.12] reactivated epstein-barr
[322.56 - 325.84] that is actually in the medical medium
[325.12 - 327.52] book right here

[350.80 - 356.16] for a little while if you're not so sick
[353.36 - 356.80] but if we try to do the whole black or
[356.16 - 358.24] white thing
[356.80 - 360.80] it's black and white it's either black
[358.24 - 363.04] or white we're just gonna get in trouble
[360.80 - 364.40] because it takes more than that
[363.04 - 367.60] cilantro's

[367.60 - 374.64] matter you guys lots of cilantro

[491.04 - 494.24] for to eat a banana
[492.08 - 496.72] it's important these details matter but
[494.24 - 499.84] eating green bananas is not a good

[499.84 - 502.96] okay chronic fatigue syndrome uh build
[502.56 - 506.00] meal
[502.96 - 508.24] on tick tock chronic fatigue syndrome so
[506.00 - 509.60] cleanse a heal there's a section in
[508.24 - 510.96] there now let's just go over
[509.60 - 512.96] we'll go over chronic fatigue syndrome
[510.96 - 513.52] for a second this is important so when
[512.96 - 516.24] you go back
[513.52 - 518.40] inside this book you'll find cfs is what
[516.24 - 520.32] you'll find okay
[518.40 - 524.00] and i'm just cutting through the back of
[520.32 - 526.32] this book to look for cfs right now
[524.00 - 528.00] this is an important topic right here
[526.32 - 529.44] because
[528.00 - 530.72] so many people have chronic fatigue
[529.44 - 532.00] syndrome and they're suffering within
[530.72 - 534.56] it's like where do you go
[532.00 - 535.92] what do you do and the details matter so
[534.56 - 537.36] when you come in here and you look for
[535.92 - 538.88] chronic fatigue syndrome
[537.36 - 540.08] and you find it in the back of the book
[538.88 - 541.36] because that's where it is it's in
[540.08 - 544.40] cleanse the heel
[541.36 - 546.24] you'll see supplements and dosages you
[544.40 - 548.16] might be somebody that got a diagnosis
[546.24 - 550.08] an autoimmune diagnosis maybe you've got
[548.16 - 553.60] lupus maybe you've got fibro
[550.08 - 555.92] maybe you've got some other diagnosis of
[553.60 - 557.44] some type of autoimmune diagnosis just
[555.92 - 558.88] know you can go in here and find the
[557.44 - 560.88] autoimmune section
[558.88 - 562.32] and when you find the autoimmune section
[560.88 - 564.40] you're right there you've got
[562.32 - 566.24] answers you've got a direction like if
[564.40 - 568.08] you go through the back here here's lyme
[566.24 - 570.08] disease right here
[568.08 - 571.68] and here's another thing too a lot of
[570.08 - 574.08] people who get cfs
[571.68 - 574.72] diagnose diagnosis of chronic fatigue
[574.08 - 576.72] syndrome
[574.72 - 579.12] they end up with a lyme diagnosis most
[576.72 - 580.88] of them end with lyme diagnosis
[579.12 - 583.20] and then you look here you'll see in
[580.88 - 586.00] lyme disease section right here
[583.20 - 588.16] you'll see all the different supplements
[586.00 - 591.68] all the different dosages
[588.16 - 593.28] so important so chronic fatigue syndrome
[591.68 - 594.64] is caused by epstein-barr so when
[593.28 - 598.08] someone's dealing with
[594.64 - 598.32] chronic cfs chronic fatigue syndrome and
[598.08 - 600.88] it's
[598.32 - 601.72] chronic tiredness right they can't
[600.88 - 605.20] function it's
[601.72 - 607.52] neurological fatigue details matter
[605.20 - 608.96] it's not black and white you're tired
[607.52 - 611.92] it's cfs
[608.96 - 613.04] black or white no it's neurological
[611.92 - 615.36] fatigue
[613.04 - 617.36] because of the nervous system being
[615.36 - 619.28] burdened by something
[617.36 - 620.40] all these details matter you see how it
[619.28 - 623.44] works you guys
[620.40 - 624.16] and here it is here the cfs section
[623.44 - 627.92] right here
[624.16 - 629.76] so uh mecfs right
[627.92 - 632.08] it's also called other things too
[629.76 - 632.88] because they rename it every decade they
[632.08 - 635.36] never give you an
[632.88 - 636.16] answer to why anybody has cfs nobody
[635.36 - 639.20] ever learns
[636.16 - 641.60] why they're sick with cfs right but they
[639.20 - 644.96] rename it every 10 years
[641.60 - 646.96] for no reason okay so
[644.96 - 648.80] in the chronic fatigue syndrome section
[646.96 - 650.56] you'll see cat's claw being really
[648.80 - 651.44] important the reason why is because when
[650.56 - 654.16] you read this
[651.44 - 655.36] true cause of chronic fatigue syndrome
[654.16 - 658.84] any of the over
[655.36 - 662.32] 60 varieties of epstein-barr virus
[658.84 - 666.56] ready it's not black or white
[662.32 - 668.40] details matter over 60 varieties of
[666.56 - 671.76] epsilon bar virus that means
[668.40 - 674.96] people have different varieties
[671.76 - 676.80] different varieties different strains so
[674.96 - 679.84] important right there
[676.80 - 682.24] ready accompanied by toxic
[679.84 - 683.60] heavy metals and we're doing the heavy
[682.24 - 684.72] metal detox movie

[1054.24 - 1056.88] autoimmune diagnosis i'm not even
[1055.60 - 1057.76] talking about the moment but it's under
[1056.88 - 1060.80] autoimmune
[1057.76 - 1062.48] which the book covers but here's a
[1060.80 - 1065.04] critical detail
[1062.48 - 1066.48] don't get bled to death don't lose your
[1065.04 - 1069.52] immune system
[1066.48 - 1072.72] you go to the doctors talk about
[1069.52 - 1074.96] getting half vials of blood taken
[1072.72 - 1076.08] protect yourself because they remove
[1074.96 - 1077.84] your immune system
[1076.08 - 1079.36] and then all the conditions get worse on
[1077.84 - 1081.92] everybody a month later
[1079.36 - 1083.60] somebody's worse millions of people are
[1081.92 - 1085.20] worse with their chronic autoimmune and
[1083.60 - 1086.96] chronic conditions they got a podcast
[1085.20 - 1088.40] episode medical meeting podcast at apple
[1086.96 - 1090.08] podcast it's called blood droplet
[1088.40 - 1091.92] leading and vampirism
[1090.08 - 1093.36] and it's the system the medical system
[1091.92 - 1094.24] is drawing too much blood out of
[1093.36 - 1096.32] everybody
[1094.24 - 1097.76] you can ask for half files quarter vials
[1096.32 - 1100.32] you can ask for smaller
[1097.76 - 1101.12] amounts and then go in again at another
[1100.32 - 1103.52] time and not
[1101.12 - 1104.72] lose your immune system which then you
[1103.52 - 1106.64] get in trouble because here's how it
[1104.72 - 1110.48] works
[1106.64 - 1113.04] this details cell lifesaver lifesaver
[1110.48 - 1114.40] you get too much blood taken you lose
[1113.04 - 1116.64] your immune system
[1114.40 - 1117.68] and the virus that's giving you sickness
[1116.64 - 1119.12] the whole reason why you're in the
[1117.68 - 1120.72] doctor's office to begin with
[1119.12 - 1123.28] getting your blood taken even though the
[1120.72 - 1124.64] doctor doesn't know you're viral
[1123.28 - 1126.80] the whole reason why you're in there
[1124.64 - 1128.88] sick is because
[1126.80 - 1130.72] of the virus and when your immune system
[1128.88 - 1132.72] gets removed constantly
[1130.72 - 1134.24] through removing your white cow by
[1132.72 - 1136.72] getting too much blood
[1134.24 - 1137.28] your viruses get stronger and you're
[1136.72 - 1140.32] sicker
[1137.28 - 1142.00] and sicker and sicker this is why so
[1140.32 - 1143.28] many people lyme disease have lost their
[1142.00 - 1146.40] lives
[1143.28 - 1146.80] many have died from getting 20 vials of
[1146.40 - 1148.64] blood
[1146.80 - 1152.48] 15 vials of blood 10 vials of blood
[1148.64 - 1155.44] every two weeks 30 40 vials of blood
[1152.48 - 1157.60] okay and because the neurological lyme
[1155.44 - 1159.36] was a virus
[1157.60 - 1161.60] right which you can learn about in the
[1159.36 - 1164.96] medical medium books

[1974.40 - 1977.84] incredible detail if you do more
[1976.72 - 1980.00] cilantro
[1977.84 - 1981.12] you get more healing done it's a leafy
[1980.00 - 1983.52] green highly
[1981.12 - 1984.80] mineralized but also takes out toxic
[1983.52 - 1988.32] heavy metals
[1984.80 - 1991.04] it's got some cilantro in there
[1988.32 - 1994.00] got two bananas in there too and let's
[1991.04 - 1994.00] do some orange
[1994.32 - 1997.92] cilantro is an herb but you can use it
[1996.24 - 1999.76] as a leafy green that's medical medium
[1997.92 - 2001.76] information you could eat it as a leafy
[1999.76 - 2004.48] green when i was first
[2001.76 - 2005.92] many years ago as as a child practically
[2004.48 - 2006.96] when i was first teaching people about
[2005.92 - 2009.28] all this stuff
[2006.96 - 2011.44] i'd be like cilantro is a leafy green
[2009.28 - 2012.80] and they're like what iceberg lettuce
[2011.44 - 2014.80] look you didn't hear me cilantro is
[2012.80 - 2016.72] leafy green iceberg
[2014.80 - 2018.96] lettuce there was an iceberg lettuce
[2016.72 - 2021.04] zombie problem in the health movement
[2018.96 - 2022.96] every single you you guys don't even
[2021.04 - 2024.40] know like the plant-based doctors that
[2022.96 - 2026.16] are out there now that seem to be on
[2024.40 - 2026.96] everything like meaning like to be hip
[2026.16 - 2028.72] on everything
[2026.96 - 2030.64] it seems and all that they were in
[2028.72 - 2031.36] iceberg lettuce just just 12 years ago
[2030.64 - 2032.88] 10 years ago
[2031.36 - 2035.52] years ago it was like they didn't even
[2032.88 - 2037.76] know about a leafy real green right
[2035.52 - 2039.92] and then when i blew up the kale thing
[2037.76 - 2041.20] when i exploded the kale thing
[2039.92 - 2043.04] because that's medical medium that
[2041.20 - 2043.84] started the whole kale movement which
[2043.04 - 2046.00] turned into
[2043.84 - 2047.52] chips turning to kill everything right
[2046.00 - 2049.04] that was me lecturing about kale
[2047.52 - 2050.48] teaching about kale that was
[2049.04 - 2052.16] talking to tens of thousands of people
[2050.48 - 2054.00] about kale so when i
[2052.16 - 2055.44] when i started the whole kale movement
[2054.00 - 2057.44] of getting that out there
[2055.44 - 2059.28] it got into the system where all of a
[2057.44 - 2060.56] sudden then the vegan doctors and other
[2059.28 - 2062.96] people were like okay
[2060.56 - 2063.76] kale okay kale kale right before that
[2062.96 - 2066.64] they're just like
[2063.76 - 2068.48] well iceberg lettuce iceberg lettuce
[2066.64 - 2070.08] iceberg lettuce it was like it was
[2068.48 - 2072.56] unbelievable
[2070.08 - 2073.92] um jesse knows a lot of products out
[2072.56 - 2075.44] there that say they're they're natural
[2073.92 - 2077.04] fragrances they're they're chemical
[2075.44 - 2078.80] based they're chemical toxic
[2077.04 - 2080.96] chemicals michelle l good to see you on
[2078.80 - 2083.28] tick-tock great to see you

[2086.32 - 2090.72] really all right got some cilantro there

[2090.72 - 2094.08] wow blueberries throwing orange in there
[2092.24 - 2096.48] let's squeeze it in
[2094.08 - 2097.36] nice orange right here i love the smell
[2096.48 - 2099.68] of oranges
[2097.36 - 2101.52] mandy can we use dates in heavy metal
[2099.68 - 2104.56] detox you can
[2101.52 - 2106.72] you can okay it's the only dried fruit
[2104.56 - 2109.36] i'd say would be okay
[2106.72 - 2111.36] right but try to keep the dried fruits
[2109.36 - 2114.40] out because dates aren't really fresh
[2111.36 - 2116.96] dear appleman good to see you i went to
[2114.40 - 2118.48] the kale festival once

[2118.48 - 2121.28] the kale festival
[2121.84 - 2125.28] i think they thanked anthony william for
[2123.52 - 2126.96] breaking his behind
[2125.28 - 2128.56] on getting that whole kale thing out
[2126.96 - 2130.00] there it's like just like we got the
[2128.56 - 2133.44] celery juice thing out there
[2130.00 - 2137.36] you think they think aw for the kale
[2133.44 - 2137.36] you know no of course not
[2139.04 - 2143.20] oh man there's some good people in the
[2141.60 - 2145.12] world thank god that there's a lot of
[2143.20 - 2146.64] bad people in the world
[2145.12 - 2148.24] that there is there is i know there's a
[2146.64 - 2150.56] big thing in the spiritual movement no
[2148.24 - 2153.20] one's bad everybody's great hitler was a
[2150.56 - 2155.44] good person are you kidding me
[2153.20 - 2157.68] that's psycho that's so psycho that
[2155.44 - 2159.84] whole that spiritual
[2157.68 - 2161.60] that spiritual brainwashing that's going
[2159.84 - 2163.04] on with that one there's no bad people
[2161.60 - 2164.88] in the world and hitler was actually a
[2163.04 - 2167.20] good guy he just was misdirected or
[2164.88 - 2171.44] misguided are you kidding me
[2167.20 - 2172.96] my god oh my god it was genocide there's
[2171.44 - 2174.64] no bad people in the world meanwhile we
[2172.96 - 2176.24] wiped out the native americans they
[2174.64 - 2178.88] barely exist on the planet
[2176.24 - 2180.56] they live in squalor and then we throw
[2178.88 - 2182.08] them a bone once in a while and try to
[2180.56 - 2184.16] publicize it like we've taken care of
[2182.08 - 2184.72] the native americans when we've on
[2184.16 - 2187.04] them for
[2184.72 - 2188.72] for centuries we just destroyed the
[2187.04 - 2192.16] native american culture
[2188.72 - 2192.16] no one even talks about it
[2192.72 - 2195.84] i mean look what happens even when all
[2194.72 - 2197.84] the rights come up
[2195.84 - 2200.00] everybody's fighting for rights for
[2197.84 - 2201.04] diversity still they just don't no one
[2200.00 - 2203.36] wants to even
[2201.04 - 2205.04] like recognize the native americans it's
[2203.36 - 2206.32] like oh no those are those crazy native
[2205.04 - 2208.40] americans over there
[2206.32 - 2210.48] jumping around right there yeah no we
[2208.40 - 2213.28] don't we don't focus on those at all
[2210.48 - 2214.88] meanwhile we've genocided them to death
[2213.28 - 2216.40] it's just unbelievable
[2214.88 - 2219.92] well i got to put the spirit lean in
[2216.40 - 2219.92] here in the barley grass juice powder
[2221.52 - 2225.04] you tell me if the world is like got it
[2224.40 - 2228.96] all right
[2225.04 - 2229.44] or something anyway the point i'm saying
[2228.96 - 2230.96] is
[2229.44 - 2232.72] it's come kind of reason why i talk
[2230.96 - 2235.04] about stuff like that is it comes down
[2232.72 - 2238.48] to this
[2235.04 - 2240.64] if we don't have control over a lot
[2238.48 - 2242.80] around us but we got control into what
[2240.64 - 2243.84] got into us and if it got into us in a
[2242.80 - 2247.20] way because
[2243.84 - 2249.60] of not good stuff out there okay
[2247.20 - 2251.28] i just put some spirit leaving here so
[2249.60 - 2253.12] what it's about is empowerment
[2251.28 - 2254.88] you can dump some chemtrails but guess
[2253.12 - 2256.00] what that stuff that's being dumped on
[2254.88 - 2259.36] me i'm going to get out of my
[2256.00 - 2262.96] body you can't rule
[2259.36 - 2264.80] my life that's what real empowerment is
[2262.96 - 2266.64] real empowerment is is knowing what's
[2264.80 - 2268.32] going on but being able to do something
[2266.64 - 2270.08] about it
[2268.32 - 2271.68] because i can make the medical medium
[2270.08 - 2273.76] heavy metal detox smoothie
[2271.68 - 2275.12] i could protect myself from a chemtrail
[2273.76 - 2275.76] i don't know what you're doing over
[2275.12 - 2277.12] there
[2275.76 - 2279.04] i don't know what you're doing over
[2277.12 - 2282.00] there
[2279.04 - 2285.12] but i'm gonna make sure i'm empowered
[2282.00 - 2288.96] and i can actually take care of myself
[2285.12 - 2290.32] so when toxic heavy metals get into us
[2288.96 - 2291.52] through all these different ways that i
[2290.32 - 2293.28] was talking about right because the
[2291.52 - 2296.48] reason why we went down that
[2293.28 - 2298.00] place of yeah yeah
[2296.48 - 2299.60] the reason why we went down to that
[2298.00 - 2302.64] place right
[2299.60 - 2304.48] of fragrances and metals being in
[2302.64 - 2306.72] fluoride treatments
[2304.48 - 2308.00] metals coming out of the sky right and
[2306.72 - 2310.08] saying a chemtrail
[2308.00 - 2311.60] metals in all kinds of different avenues
[2310.08 - 2314.24] that were exposed to
[2311.60 - 2315.60] metals and pharmaceuticals right the
[2314.24 - 2317.12] pharmaceuticals and metals
[2315.60 - 2319.12] it's like metals don't have to be in
[2317.12 - 2321.44] pharmaceuticals for some reason
[2319.12 - 2322.88] somebody thinks it's a good idea who's
[2321.44 - 2323.76] not looking out for everybody's best
[2322.88 - 2326.16] interest right
[2323.76 - 2327.44] so the reason why i'm talking about all
[2326.16 - 2329.60] that is because hey
[2327.44 - 2331.44] we could do something about it you're
[2329.60 - 2334.16] not gonna take you're not gonna
[2331.44 - 2336.80] and you're not gonna disempower me
[2334.16 - 2339.36] because i'm gonna get the medals out
[2336.80 - 2340.00] and i'm gonna get cleaned up and that's
[2339.36 - 2343.44] the key
[2340.00 - 2345.60] right there anyway spirulina is
[2343.44 - 2347.84] is really an incredible weapon against
[2345.60 - 2350.56] all of this toxicity
[2347.84 - 2352.96] i love it for for being a weapon against
[2350.56 - 2354.88] radiation exposure
[2352.96 - 2357.68] i love it being a weapon against the
[2354.88 - 2360.96] fragrances and the air fresheners
[2357.68 - 2364.16] and all of that okay so that's what i
[2360.96 - 2365.92] love these tools so i just put in a
[2364.16 - 2368.08] teaspoon in there right there that's the
[2365.92 - 2371.28] vimergy spirulina visa vs victor i
[2368.08 - 2371.76] m e r g y dot com it's the best one out
[2371.28 - 2374.56] there
[2371.76 - 2376.96] by far hands down there's no better one
[2374.56 - 2376.96] than that
[2377.20 - 2380.88] so i'm going to put in the barley grass
[2378.56 - 2382.24] juice powder that's what i'm doing now
[2380.88 - 2384.72] now what you're going to find out there
[2382.24 - 2387.04] is corella
[2384.72 - 2388.88] everybody's going to be like corella
[2387.04 - 2389.76] that's what you use right everybody's
[2388.88 - 2392.88] going to be
[2389.76 - 2394.56] well corella doesn't work these details
[2392.88 - 2396.08] are critical and i talk about that and
[2394.56 - 2398.96] cleanse the heels so
[2396.08 - 2399.76] get a copy when you can right 51 off at
[2398.96 - 2401.84] amazon
[2399.76 - 2404.00] but get a copy when you can learn about
[2401.84 - 2406.56] why corella's not the way to go
[2404.00 - 2407.92] that means books talk about that these
[2406.56 - 2409.20] are capsules i'm just opening the
[2407.92 - 2410.88] capsules
[2409.20 - 2412.24] putting in the smoothie because i ran
[2410.88 - 2415.52] out of the powder
[2412.24 - 2421.04] i got to order the powder right
[2415.52 - 2421.04] so i'm putting some capsules in there
[2423.12 - 2426.56] all right so we got that
[2427.84 - 2434.08] this is one critical detail right here
[2431.36 - 2435.76] so if you want to get metals out it's
[2434.08 - 2438.96] got to be a spirulina
[2435.76 - 2440.80] a high quality one is best but it's got
[2438.96 - 2443.76] to be a spirulina
[2440.80 - 2444.32] corella will not get the metals out and
[2443.76 - 2446.64] this is
[2444.32 - 2447.36] where the whole thing happens again
[2446.64 - 2449.52] where
[2447.36 - 2450.88] the details do matter because people
[2449.52 - 2453.76] don't realize that
[2450.88 - 2454.72] so important right another detail is i
[2453.76 - 2457.60] don't use the
[2454.72 - 2459.84] pacific spirulina anymore so any
[2457.60 - 2463.52] spirulina that's derived
[2459.84 - 2463.92] grown on you know on the west in the
[2463.52 - 2466.32] west
[2463.92 - 2468.96] any pacific okay the ocean's got too
[2466.32 - 2470.88] dirty in the last few years so i stopped
[2468.96 - 2473.44] quite a ways back it just got too dirty
[2470.88 - 2475.52] it's got even dirtier than ever before
[2473.44 - 2477.68] it's at a point now where i just can't
[2475.52 - 2480.64] even trust anything like that
[2477.68 - 2482.00] so so this is the best one is november
[2480.64 - 2483.84] just letting you know
[2482.00 - 2485.44] all these things count we got the orange
[2483.84 - 2486.80] in there we got the wild blueberries
[2485.44 - 2490.24] let's grind this up
[2486.80 - 2494.88] oh put a little dulce in there yep
[2490.24 - 2509.84] atlantic dolce
[2494.88 - 2509.84] important let's give it a little
[2513.28 - 2516.48] having fun with the blender
[2517.76 - 2523.84] what question mark spirulina yes
[2531.44 - 2534.32] okay we're good
[2535.52 - 2542.80] we are blended up nicely
[2539.12 - 2545.52] indeed we are medical medium heavy metal
[2542.80 - 2547.20] detox smoothie
[2545.52 - 2549.04] so what i like about the medical medium
[2547.20 - 2550.00] heavy metal detox smoothie it's one of
[2549.04 - 2553.76] the
[2550.00 - 2556.88] it's like a prayer answered
[2553.76 - 2558.64] for anxiety depression
[2556.88 - 2560.96] there are people that were in such a
[2558.64 - 2563.36] deep dark space with their depression
[2560.96 - 2566.48] they didn't want to be depressed they
[2563.36 - 2569.12] didn't want to be sad
[2566.48 - 2571.20] they didn't want depression right but
[2569.12 - 2575.12] they had
[2571.20 - 2576.00] such a systemic deep depression inside
[2575.12 - 2577.76] of them
[2576.00 - 2579.36] the kind that people only understand who
[2577.76 - 2581.52] have been there who who have been in
[2579.36 - 2584.80] that zone of depression
[2581.52 - 2585.44] not a depression where something tragic
[2584.80 - 2587.44] happens
[2585.44 - 2589.60] and you're you're trying to move past it
[2587.44 - 2591.68] and it could take years and you're
[2589.60 - 2592.80] you're just you're emotionally injured
[2591.68 - 2595.36] through it you know
[2592.80 - 2597.20] the depression where and you can have
[2595.36 - 2598.40] both you can have a depression from
[2597.20 - 2601.76] toxic heavy metals
[2598.40 - 2604.56] and that depression too of course right
[2601.76 - 2605.92] but with the kind of depression where
[2604.56 - 2606.48] people are depressed they don't want to
[2605.92 - 2608.00] be
[2606.48 - 2610.24] depressed and they're just curled up in
[2608.00 - 2611.92] their bed they can't move forward their
[2610.24 - 2612.32] life they feel like they can't get they
[2611.92 - 2613.84] can't
[2612.32 - 2615.52] push through they're just living with
[2613.84 - 2618.80] the depression every minute
[2615.52 - 2619.68] it's like it's like a cloud over their
[2618.80 - 2621.20] eyes
[2619.68 - 2623.12] they can't see even though they're
[2621.20 - 2625.04] looking even though they can see but
[2623.12 - 2626.40] they feel like they can't see anything
[2625.04 - 2629.04] they're just they're just living with
[2626.40 - 2633.36] that depression to such an extent
[2629.04 - 2634.88] and it's a cover depression in here okay
[2633.36 - 2637.04] and cleanse the heel i cover it in the
[2634.88 - 2638.32] other book too medical meme new edition
[2637.04 - 2639.76] but this is the medical media morning
[2638.32 - 2641.36] cleanse that we've been doing heavy
[2639.76 - 2644.88] metal detox cleanse
[2641.36 - 2647.36] so important heavy metal detox smoothie
[2644.88 - 2651.60] has freed so many people you guys
[2647.36 - 2654.88] of that clinical deep dark depression
[2651.60 - 2656.40] and that that means everything for
[2654.88 - 2658.96] someone who's going through that
[2656.40 - 2660.08] and when it comes down to to anxiety it
[2658.96 - 2661.60] does that too so what's
[2660.08 - 2663.68] happening with the depression and the
[2661.60 - 2667.84] anxiety let's cover that real quick
[2663.68 - 2673.12] let's do that i'm excited about this
[2667.84 - 2673.12] so actually we'll cover it this way here
[2674.08 - 2679.84] so when it comes down to depression
[2677.44 - 2681.04] toxic heavy metals they get into the
[2679.84 - 2682.80] brain
[2681.04 - 2684.72] that alone can create depression because
[2682.80 - 2686.40] your neurotransmitters are being
[2684.72 - 2689.12] affected and your neurons are being
[2686.40 - 2689.68] saturated by toxic heavy metals aluminum
[2689.12 - 2692.40] mercury
[2689.68 - 2693.60] lead cadmium copper copper is a big one
[2692.40 - 2696.00] for everybody
[2693.60 - 2698.56] and people get copper in their brain and
[2696.00 - 2700.80] it causes this problem so it's important
[2698.56 - 2702.00] and when the brain gets saturated with
[2700.80 - 2704.32] metals
[2702.00 - 2706.48] okay and it's not detectable by
[2704.32 - 2709.68] equipment technology today it's not
[2706.48 - 2711.84] detectable by medical you know tests
[2709.68 - 2713.44] the doctor can't detect it here's the
[2711.84 - 2715.20] problem with toxic heavy metals they go
[2713.44 - 2715.68] deep in organs and then there's not
[2715.20 - 2718.16] enough
[2715.68 - 2719.76] of that toxic heavy metal going through
[2718.16 - 2722.32] the bloodstream for the doctor to
[2719.76 - 2723.92] identify unless it's a fresh exposure
[2722.32 - 2725.60] and then they can identify it if they
[2723.92 - 2728.24] look right
[2725.60 - 2730.56] but a deep exposure is something where
[2728.24 - 2732.40] the metals go deep inside the brain
[2730.56 - 2734.00] deep inside the liver deep inside their
[2732.40 - 2736.40] body
[2734.00 - 2738.80] okay so when it comes down to depression
[2736.40 - 2739.52] and anxiety metals play a huge role
[2738.80 - 2743.04] because they
[2739.52 - 2745.68] oxidize they start to break down so the
[2743.04 - 2746.96] metals start to break down and oxidize
[2745.68 - 2749.76] and when a metal breaks down and
[2746.96 - 2752.88] oxidizes it travels
[2749.76 - 2755.12] so instead of being say here
[2752.88 - 2756.56] right left hemisphere somewhere closer
[2755.12 - 2757.60] to the frontal lobe instead of being
[2756.56 - 2760.24] there
[2757.60 - 2762.32] that the metal starts to travel because
[2760.24 - 2766.20] it oxidized and it
[2762.32 - 2767.44] out gassed and it what it did was it
[2766.20 - 2770.48] exploded
[2767.44 - 2773.76] metals tend to rust and explode
[2770.48 - 2774.00] i hate when that happens that's why
[2773.76 - 2777.44] we're
[2774.00 - 2779.28] live okay the head of my dummy just hit
[2777.44 - 2781.76] the floor
[2779.28 - 2783.36] all right so when those metals lean
[2781.76 - 2786.56] those metals
[2783.36 - 2790.00] they oxidize and they rust they travel
[2786.56 - 2791.76] it's byproduct caused by it so let's go
[2790.00 - 2793.44] into that a little bit like why are they
[2791.76 - 2796.16] doing that in people like why
[2793.44 - 2797.04] are metals here we go you guys why are
[2796.16 - 2799.68] metals
[2797.04 - 2800.96] oxidizing why are they moving why are
[2799.68 - 2803.36] they running off
[2800.96 - 2804.08] ashley kevin i know it's funny right why
[2803.36 - 2807.76] are they
[2804.08 - 2810.40] why do they do that because of acids
[2807.76 - 2812.00] and oxidative fats so we're told to eat
[2810.40 - 2813.52] fats eat fats eat fats and what you're
[2812.00 - 2815.76] noticing is medical medium warning
[2813.52 - 2817.84] cleanse
[2815.76 - 2820.40] medium heavy metal detox smoothie
[2817.84 - 2822.32] doesn't have any fat in it
[2820.40 - 2823.92] so there's no almonds there's no almond
[2822.32 - 2828.24] butter there's no peanut butter
[2823.92 - 2830.56] in that smoothie there's no cacao
[2828.24 - 2832.00] in that smoothie so the heavy metal
[2830.56 - 2835.12] detox
[2832.00 - 2837.36] smoothie doesn't have the fat in it
[2835.12 - 2838.96] because it's all that high fat diet
[2837.36 - 2842.32] everybody's up against
[2838.96 - 2844.80] 24 7 that's oxidating
[2842.32 - 2845.44] the metals and making them hard to even
[2844.80 - 2847.12] remove
[2845.44 - 2848.48] or clean out so the medical meeting
[2847.12 - 2851.84] warning cleanse
[2848.48 - 2855.44] is a great way to do some metal removal
[2851.84 - 2857.52] that's what it is to remove your metals
[2855.44 - 2859.52] in the morning and when you do the heavy
[2857.52 - 2863.60] metal detox smoothie
[2859.52 - 2867.36] you're one smoothie past your depression
[2863.60 - 2871.20] you're one smoothie past your anxiety
[2867.36 - 2874.88] you're one smoothie past your bipolar
[2871.20 - 2878.48] your depersonalization your sadness
[2874.88 - 2882.08] that's unexplainable
[2878.48 - 2885.76] your memory loss
[2882.08 - 2887.60] your brain fog how many guys have dealt
[2885.76 - 2888.64] with brain fog
[2887.60 - 2891.44] how many of you guys out there have
[2888.64 - 2892.96] dealt with the brain fog just curious

[2898.32 - 2903.92] right ptsd ptsd can
[2901.44 - 2905.68] completely worsen when the metals are
[2903.92 - 2907.20] there
[2905.68 - 2909.52] i talk about that in the medical mean
[2907.20 - 2912.32] books ptsd can worsen
[2909.52 - 2913.60] the experiences that create ptsd can
[2912.32 - 2916.88] worsen if metals
[2913.60 - 2918.72] are adjacent to the problem in the brain
[2916.88 - 2920.88] very important to know you know so you
[2918.72 - 2923.20] want the metals out
[2920.88 - 2924.96] right the brain fog is a big one for
[2923.20 - 2926.16] people so brain fog yeah you had it oh

[2946.88 - 2950.72] fog it's not the complete picture
[2948.72 - 2952.40] some brain fog cases can be all toxic
[2950.72 - 2952.96] heavy metals but some can be low grade
[2952.40 - 2954.88] viral

[3035.92 - 3039.20] the details matter if you want to go all
[3037.68 - 3040.32] the way but for best results if you want
[3039.20 - 3041.60] to go all the way but it doesn't mean
[3040.32 - 3043.28] you're not going to get some results if
[3041.60 - 3044.64] you do the heavy metal detox smoothie
[3043.28 - 3046.48] some other time or
[3044.64 - 3049.04] if it was after fats at a certain meal
[3046.48 - 3052.80] or whatever it is it's it's okay

[3070.64 - 3074.08] know how much goes into all of that it's
[3072.48 - 3076.56] not so simple
[3074.08 - 3078.69] if you went through a lot with that all
[3076.56 - 3080.32] of it the brain fog and everything
[3078.69 - 3082.64] [Music]

[3328.19 - 3332.56] [Music]
[3330.40 - 3334.64] people that were elevated in their
[3332.56 - 3337.20] position in the plant-based movement
[3334.64 - 3338.72] knew why anybody was sick i mean okay
[3337.20 - 3340.16] let's talk about fast foods and
[3338.72 - 3341.76] processed foods but they still don't
[3340.16 - 3343.52] know why anybody's sick
[3341.76 - 3345.36] a plant-based movement as far as it ever
[3343.52 - 3347.60] got for information was
[3345.36 - 3348.80] if you eat junk food you're gonna get
[3347.60 - 3350.48] heart disease
[3348.80 - 3353.04] so the plant-based movement was all
[3350.48 - 3354.16] about if you eat junk food and processed
[3353.04 - 3356.08] foods
[3354.16 - 3357.44] that if you eat all that fast food you
[3356.08 - 3359.12] know i mean the plant-based movement was
[3357.44 - 3360.72] all about fast food right
[3359.12 - 3362.40] don't eat all the fast food and kill
[3360.72 - 3362.88] yourself with all the junk fast food and
[3362.40 - 3364.56] animal
[3362.88 - 3366.24] products and animal grease that was as
[3364.56 - 3368.72] far as the plant-based movement ever got
[3366.24 - 3370.80] they didn't know why 20-year-olds were
[3368.72 - 3372.96] on mattress island
[3370.80 - 3374.48] not able to talk or walk they didn't
[3372.96 - 3376.32] know why 25 year olds
[3374.48 - 3377.68] would lose their jobs and careers or
[3376.32 - 3379.04] they would they would get out of college
[3377.68 - 3380.48] and get a job and then all of a sudden
[3379.04 - 3382.48] have to go home and lay in bed
[3380.48 - 3384.00] they didn't know why college girls and
[3382.48 - 3384.72] college boys would kind of have to come
[3384.00 - 3386.72] back
[3384.72 - 3388.08] from school and stay at home with their
[3386.72 - 3389.28] parents and live there for the next 10
[3388.08 - 3390.64] years sick
[3389.28 - 3392.40] they didn't know that the plant-based
[3390.64 - 3393.52] movement just knew about fast food
[3392.40 - 3395.76] greasy food
[3393.52 - 3396.80] that's what they knew about so now
[3395.76 - 3398.48] they're learning more
[3396.80 - 3399.92] through medical medium through osmosis
[3398.48 - 3400.48] which is medical medium information
[3399.92 - 3401.84] getting all
[3400.48 - 3404.24] out there plus i've taught a lot of the
[3401.84 - 3406.00] plant-based doctors throughout the years
[3404.24 - 3407.52] about the low-fat and other stuff so
[3406.00 - 3409.28] that they've taken that information
[3407.52 - 3411.20] further right
[3409.28 - 3413.44] but because you know medical medium gets
[3411.20 - 3415.20] its information from above
[3413.44 - 3416.72] they always like to try to find some
[3415.20 - 3418.40] kind of study that has nothing to do
[3416.72 - 3420.40] with the information at all
[3418.40 - 3422.16] but just has one word in there that's
[3420.40 - 3423.52] similar and be like oh it came from that
[3422.16 - 3424.72] no it came from medical medium because
[3423.52 - 3426.32] there is no study on that
[3424.72 - 3428.48] so anyway let's get a strainer and do
[3426.32 - 3428.48] this
[3431.04 - 3433.84] and then you can't get then all these
[3432.56 - 3435.36] other people are misled and can't get
[3433.84 - 3436.24] back to where the real information is
[3435.36 - 3438.64] that they can heal that's the only
[3436.24 - 3441.76] reason why i care about it
[3438.64 - 3444.64] i never got into this as a child to be
[3441.76 - 3444.64] known or anything
[3444.80 - 3449.20] that's that's not the game that's the
[3448.24 - 3453.20] bad game
[3449.20 - 3456.40] i got into this to save lives right
[3453.20 - 3459.12] and i was forced into it to save lives
[3456.40 - 3461.04] and then i i then i had to make sure i
[3459.12 - 3462.40] got comfortable with that
[3461.04 - 3464.64] when i was really young i talked about
[3462.40 - 3468.08] that in medical medium books right
[3464.64 - 3468.08] that's your celery juice right here
[3469.76 - 3474.16] but you got to be really in it to
[3472.24 - 3476.88] protect people and make sure that you
[3474.16 - 3479.12] really do get them better
[3476.88 - 3482.48] i was working on people tens of
[3479.12 - 3485.76] thousands of people for so many decades
[3482.48 - 3487.52] and then i was working on all kinds of
[3485.76 - 3489.04] professionals that were trying to make a
[3487.52 - 3491.36] name for themselves in the plant-based
[3489.04 - 3493.84] movement so they would talk to me
[3491.36 - 3496.08] get all this information right about
[3493.84 - 3497.36] heavy metals or about something
[3496.08 - 3499.12] and then they would go out there and try
[3497.36 - 3500.56] to make a name for themselves
[3499.12 - 3502.56] so they could sell a product and become
[3500.56 - 3504.48] famous right and
[3502.56 - 3505.92] i sat back in my office while people
[3504.48 - 3507.44] traveled around the world to come see me
[3505.92 - 3508.80] in my office because i was known as the
[3507.44 - 3510.48] bizarre symptoms guy
[3508.80 - 3511.84] and that's how everybody got to know me
[3510.48 - 3516.16] is i had an answer
[3511.84 - 3517.92] when there were no answers and
[3516.16 - 3520.48] you know it should be really about the
[3517.92 - 3523.84] person suffering struggling
[3520.48 - 3526.64] and knowing where the details come from
[3523.84 - 3528.64] so they can heal all the way not take
[3526.64 - 3530.64] tidbits to make yourself look big so you
[3528.64 - 3533.92] can do some documentary somewhere
[3530.64 - 3535.28] or some podcast and then not show people
[3533.92 - 3538.00] the way and be like you know what
[3535.28 - 3539.12] i'll never forget this one this one case
[3538.00 - 3543.12] okay you guys
[3539.12 - 3546.96] uh this young woman who was
[3543.12 - 3551.20] 23 years old right she lost her job
[3546.96 - 3551.84] she she couldn't function she had severe
[3551.20 - 3554.00] fatigue
[3551.84 - 3557.04] she had the eye floaters tingles and
[3554.00 - 3558.80] numbness she had the electrical shocks
[3557.04 - 3560.56] right happening in her head where
[3558.80 - 3560.96] electrical shocks would almost knock her
[3560.56 - 3562.32] over
[3560.96 - 3564.56] she had the jerks and the twitches and
[3562.32 - 3565.20] the spasms she had the back pain neck
[3564.56 - 3566.96] pain
[3565.20 - 3569.20] she had the burning skin burning mouth
[3566.96 - 3571.28] burning tongue right all that stuff
[3569.20 - 3572.96] right and she went to every single
[3571.28 - 3574.08] doctor every practitioner and she
[3572.96 - 3577.44] finally found this
[3574.08 - 3581.04] chiropractor this chiropractor
[3577.44 - 3582.72] in l.a right she found him and the
[3581.04 - 3585.20] chiropractor said
[3582.72 - 3588.00] i'm using my intuitive ability and i
[3585.20 - 3591.36] think you have epstein-barr
[3588.00 - 3593.52] epstein barr and she was like oh my god
[3591.36 - 3596.88] i got an answer for the first time
[3593.52 - 3598.72] that epstein-barr is a virus
[3596.88 - 3600.08] so what do i need to do and the
[3598.72 - 3603.36] chiropractor kept on saying
[3600.08 - 3605.12] i'm not sure try maybe this and you got
[3603.36 - 3607.04] epstein-barr and she was like oh my god
[3605.12 - 3609.36] i have an answer i have an answer
[3607.04 - 3610.96] maybe i can function for the first time
[3609.36 - 3613.84] in my life
[3610.96 - 3615.36] right and every time she asked him for
[3613.84 - 3617.60] more information
[3615.36 - 3619.28] he said this chiropractor said i'm not
[3617.60 - 3621.60] getting any i'm not getting
[3619.28 - 3622.48] any intuitively i'm not getting anyone
[3621.60 - 3626.96] anyway
[3622.48 - 3629.60] this person this this woman
[3626.96 - 3631.36] got into the lottery system and medical
[3629.60 - 3633.44] medium when i was still seeing people
[3631.36 - 3634.88] this is many years ago she got into the
[3633.44 - 3637.68] lottery system
[3634.88 - 3639.92] she was chosen in the lottery system and
[3637.68 - 3644.08] she got an appointment with me
[3639.92 - 3646.80] and she told me the story and i said
[3644.08 - 3648.80] it's a chiropractor in a way is this
[3646.80 - 3651.12] person's name this
[3648.80 - 3652.48] and she goes yeah i go well that's a
[3651.12 - 3654.40] client of mine
[3652.48 - 3656.40] the chiropractor in l.a wanted to seem
[3654.40 - 3659.60] like a big wig
[3656.40 - 3661.60] knowing a part of the information
[3659.60 - 3664.08] but not telling her where the
[3661.60 - 3667.36] information came from and how she needed
[3664.08 - 3671.28] to find medical medium to get all of it
[3667.36 - 3674.16] she she was obviously an angel
[3671.28 - 3675.84] got her to the direction of medical
[3674.16 - 3677.60] media because the minute she got her
[3675.84 - 3678.72] appointment with me and this is before i
[3677.60 - 3680.16] publish books that
[3678.72 - 3681.36] everybody can get a chance to heal he's
[3680.16 - 3682.88] just you know and then she got an
[3681.36 - 3684.32] appointment with me
[3682.88 - 3686.08] she was able to heal and get all the
[3684.32 - 3688.32] information and she couldn't
[3686.08 - 3689.76] understand why this chiropractor would
[3688.32 - 3693.76] hold back
[3689.76 - 3695.12] and do this to her and so she contacted
[3693.76 - 3697.76] the chiropractor and said
[3695.12 - 3699.28] i'm talking to anthony william he's
[3697.76 - 3701.12] giving me all the information about why
[3699.28 - 3702.40] epstein-barr causes this why didn't you
[3701.12 - 3704.00] tell me that's where you
[3702.40 - 3705.44] that you actually knew him that you
[3704.00 - 3708.96] actually saw him as a
[3705.44 - 3712.48] as a as a client and he was just
[3708.96 - 3714.32] he was it was ego thing right and
[3712.48 - 3715.76] that's the problem that's just one out
[3714.32 - 3719.36] of just i mean
[3715.76 - 3719.68] that's just one example and it's sad to
[3719.36 - 3721.52] me
[3719.68 - 3723.60] so when the podcast doctor says yeah
[3721.52 - 3725.20] there's metals that cause psoriasis but
