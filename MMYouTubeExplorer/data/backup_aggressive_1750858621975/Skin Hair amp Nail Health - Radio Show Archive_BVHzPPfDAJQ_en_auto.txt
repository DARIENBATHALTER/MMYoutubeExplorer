[289.36 - 293.00] what's funny is they're making it
[290.84 - 294.76] complicated out there they're making it
[293.00 - 296.96] complicated because they don't know
[294.76 - 298.92] what's wrong with people you know they
[296.96 - 301.04] don't know the industries don't know
[298.92 - 302.80] what's wrong with why so many millions
[301.04 - 304.68] and millions and millions of people in
[302.80 - 307.04] the US alone are sick with chronic
[304.68 - 308.76] illness with no answers with no answers
[307.04 - 310.88] and the answers they get whether it's
[308.76 - 312.80] labels or whatever is still a mystery
[310.88 - 314.92] it's still a mystery every every bit
[312.80 - 316.32] about it and you guys know that by now
[314.92 - 319.72] come on and you know that by listening
[316.32 - 322.12] to the show right and and because of all
[319.72 - 324.60] that we need to change that we need to
[322.12 - 326.52] change that we really do and so they
[324.60 - 328.20] make it complicated they blame you they
[326.52 - 329.60] blame you it's you your body attacking
[328.20 - 331.56] itself it's your genes you got bad
[329.60 - 333.84] faulty jees it's your problem there your
[331.56 - 336.84] DNA is all screwed up and they blame it
[333.84 - 338.84] on you and that's how it's done that's
[336.84 - 340.96] how it's done from the top that's the
[338.84 - 343.20] trickery from the top the problem is
[340.96 - 345.56] good-hearted good-hearted loving
[343.20 - 348.16] compassionate professionals have to
[345.56 - 349.96] follow the misinformation that's from
[348.16 - 351.68] the top because they have nowhere else
[349.96 - 353.28] to go they don't have a voice that's
[351.68 - 355.12] telling them what the truth is in their
[353.28 - 357.64] ear so they have no choice but they'll
[355.12 - 359.64] learn the stuff that's complicated and
[357.64 - 362.56] then just then it just gets Trinkle on
[359.64 - 365.32] down the line and it has to change it
[362.56 - 367.84] has to change anyway we're back we're
[365.32 - 370.00] back on we're back on skin hair and
[367.84 - 373.56] nails okay so let's let's uh let's start
[370.00 - 376.08] diving into this so what happens with
[373.56 - 378.12] the skin why are we so concerned with
[376.08 - 379.68] the skin we're concerned because we can
[378.12 - 381.16] have all kinds of stuff wrinkles it's
[379.68 - 382.96] one thing people are worried about they
[381.16 - 385.80] don't like wrinkles no one likes
[382.96 - 387.64] wrinkles right so that's one thing the
[385.80 - 390.76] other thing is you know any kind of skin
[387.64 - 392.84] blemishes scars s on the skin the whole
[390.76 - 395.44] bit so when someone gets a scar they get
[392.84 - 397.20] a little cut they get a burn a burn SCAR
[395.44 - 399.96] or something like that they bump into
[397.20 - 402.04] their stove something happens um they
[399.96 - 404.60] get cut with their their cuddly knife
[402.04 - 407.72] they're they their vegetable fruit or
[404.60 - 409.60] you know um food knife at their cutting
[407.72 - 411.96] board and they cut their finger or they
[409.60 - 414.92] cut something and there's a scar and no
[411.96 - 417.08] one likes scars and Anything could
[414.92 - 419.96] happen you know you can you can just you
[417.08 - 422.36] know scratch the leg somehow and
[419.96 - 425.52] um and and and whatever it is we worry
[422.36 - 427.60] about the skin for so many reasons and
[425.52 - 429.28] facial we don't like acne hey that's why
[427.60 - 432.12] I did you know did the acne show the
[429.28 - 434.36] acne show right and we don't like we
[432.12 - 437.12] don't like the uh we don't like the acne
[434.36 - 439.00] in the today's world and we don't like
[437.12 - 440.24] scarring from acne and we don't like any
[439.00 - 442.92] of that so we're always trying to
[440.24 - 445.08] improve skin bags under our eyes all
[442.92 - 449.44] that whole thing and there's a million
[445.08 - 451.20] lotions and tonics lotions tonics skin
[449.44 - 454.40] tonic skin lotions I know I said that
[451.20 - 456.24] twice already and we're always looking
[454.40 - 457.92] for the miracle topical thing I'm just
[456.24 - 459.52] going to have to deliver this to you I'm
[457.92 - 463.28] going to have to deliver this bad news
[459.52 - 467.72] to you I'm going to have to there's no
[463.28 - 473.12] topical miracle cure there's no topical
[467.72 - 476.20] miracle cure for skin problems there
[473.12 - 477.72] are there but but listen there are
[476.20 - 481.60] topical
[477.72 - 483.52] anti-viral anti- cancer you know solves
[481.60 - 486.56] you know we can make and put together
[483.52 - 489.20] and and so forth to try to you know put
[486.56 - 490.52] put on the skin and on skin issues that
[489.20 - 492.96] people are really concerned about
[490.52 - 495.00] there's stuff like that all right
[492.96 - 498.88] there's creams to soften skin a little
[495.00 - 502.84] bit and moisturize skin but it's not
[498.88 - 505.76] going to fix skin problems in a way that
[502.84 - 509.28] we want want that's why people go to
[505.76 - 511.16] plastic surgery and people go to Botox
[509.28 - 513.24] cuz theyve tried hundreds of creams
[511.16 - 515.44] before they end up going to Botox then
[513.24 - 519.28] we got a whole young crowd now doing
[515.44 - 521.80] Botox so Botox is so in at this point we
[519.28 - 524.40] have all the you know 18 19 20 year olds
[521.80 - 527.68] doing Botox now 22 year olds 23 year
[524.40 - 530.84] olds in fact it's so in it's it's just
[527.68 - 533.60] it's just part of the culture of today
[530.84 - 536.76] and it's about getting the skin is tight
[533.60 - 539.96] as possible getting the skin as Flawless
[536.76 - 542.12] as possible but all this all of it all
[539.96 - 544.92] of it all of it isn't the answers truly
[542.12 - 546.80] as far as where skin problems go wrong
[544.92 - 548.96] to begin with why we wrinkle why the
[546.80 - 551.16] skin loosens up why it ages why all
[548.96 - 554.08] these different things go on why we get
[551.16 - 555.84] all these weird blemishes we get liver
[554.08 - 558.00] spots and everything else liver spots
[555.84 - 561.24] exactly that's a clue that's a clue
[558.00 - 564.72] that's a clue liver spots that's a clue
[561.24 - 567.84] the clue is it's deeper it's deeper when
[564.72 - 570.04] it comes down to skin it's deeper so we
[567.84 - 572.76] need to always know that we need to
[570.04 - 576.48] always understand that so we can get our
[572.76 - 581.36] skin to last longer without having to
[576.48 - 583.80] manipulate the skin in other ways to be
[581.36 - 586.04] you know to feel good or look good or be
[583.80 - 588.24] accepted in today's society which we're
[586.04 - 592.72] going into you know back in the
[588.24 - 594.68] 70s back in the 70s and the 60s you know
[592.72 - 597.88] your skin was your skin there was really
[594.68 - 599.16] no plastic surgery not really successful
[597.88 - 600.44] plastic surgery I'll tell you that right
[599.16 - 604.16] right now there there's no question
[600.44 - 606.40] about it and Botox wasn't around and
[604.16 - 610.04] your skin was your skin that's just the
[606.40 - 613.24] way it was it was the 60s it was the 70s
[610.04 - 614.52] and you know and you had to you had to
[613.24 - 616.08] you had to live with it now we have
[614.52 - 618.04] these options that make us feel like
[616.08 - 621.24] let's not try anything else let's not go
[618.04 - 623.36] deep let's not go deep down into the
[621.24 - 624.48] body to try to heal something or fix
[623.36 - 628.48] something let's just hurry up and get
[624.48 - 630.16] the botox I'm not saying I'm not saying
[628.48 - 632.32] if you got talkx it was the wrong thing
[630.16 - 634.84] to do or bad or whatever look you got to
[632.32 - 636.84] do how you feel you got to do you right
[634.84 - 638.48] you got to do you I was talking to
[636.84 - 640.36] somebody recently and they're like look
[638.48 - 641.64] I want to do me you know and I was like
[640.36 - 643.48] you know what and that's where I heard
[641.64 - 645.68] that I was like hey that's pretty cool
[643.48 - 648.32] do me so yeah so you have to do you
[645.68 - 650.40] exactly right that's the hip thing and
[648.32 - 651.68] um and I respect that and I honor that
[650.40 - 653.92] and if it's what makes you feel good
[651.68 - 656.88] it's what gets you up in the morning
[653.92 - 660.20] it's what gets you in a better place in
[656.88 - 663.48] your life I support it 100% okay I'm not
[660.20 - 666.60] a big fan of Botox but I support what
[663.48 - 668.84] makes you feel better and if that's what
[666.60 - 670.68] you have to do I support it I want you
[668.84 - 672.36] to know that I respect it I support it
[670.68 - 674.48] I'm behind you you know what happens is
[672.36 - 676.28] that there also this thing if someone
[674.48 - 677.80] doesn't feel good they don't feel good
[676.28 - 680.00] mentally they don't feel good
[677.80 - 681.88] emotionally about how they feel about
[680.00 - 684.32] themselves how they look and all that
[681.88 - 686.08] then and and then I have to honor that
[684.32 - 688.00] because that doesn't work for them
[686.08 - 689.48] either if someone's miserable all day
[688.00 - 691.00] long and they're miserable
[689.48 - 693.04] and every morning they're miserable cuz
[691.00 - 694.92] they feel like you know that they have
[693.04 - 697.44] to they that that Botox will change
[694.92 - 698.92] their life and change that I'm on board
[697.44 - 701.36] someone's that
[698.92 - 703.28] miserable um you know and they're so
[701.36 - 705.20] depressed and they're just like you know
[703.28 - 707.32] what I need I need to do this because I
[705.20 - 709.00] can't I can't face people at work I
[707.32 - 711.40] can't there's something inside of
[709.00 - 713.20] someone that's really bringing them down
[711.40 - 715.88] and then I understand why someone would
[713.20 - 718.12] do that so hey I support if someone
[715.88 - 720.84] needs to do them do themselves they need
[718.12 - 723.32] to be themselves in some way but but but
[720.84 - 725.80] but let's address I like doing things
[723.32 - 728.32] naturally deep down inside let's address
[725.80 - 731.72] what creates skin problems deep down
[728.32 - 734.16] inside let's address what creates
[731.72 - 735.72] problems deep down inside so you know
[734.16 - 737.36] and listen if you're someone who hasn't
[735.72 - 738.96] gotten Botox or anything I'm not trying
[737.36 - 740.48] to tell you to go running off and and
[738.96 - 741.76] get that you know that don't run off and
[740.48 - 743.44] get that I want you to addess what's
[741.76 - 745.44] deep inside that's the way I handle
[743.44 - 747.32] things and want to handle things but as
[745.44 - 748.96] I said before if that's what you've done
[747.32 - 751.56] I stand behind you too and you should
[748.96 - 753.36] still you should still go deep down
[751.56 - 755.96] inside and do some healing down there so
[753.36 - 758.60] even if you had say plastic surgery even
[755.96 - 762.48] if you had cosmetic surgery even if you
[758.60 - 764.96] had Botox I want you 100% still doing
[762.48 - 767.72] things to take care of what's inside
[764.96 - 770.48] because that's going to help you for
[767.72 - 773.68] everything and every
[770.48 - 777.24] reason okay so that that's what matters
[773.68 - 781.24] so skin problems the liver the liver the
[777.24 - 783.40] liver it plays such a role in aging and
[781.24 - 785.48] skin problems and wrinkles and and
[783.40 - 787.84] everything else the liver the liver gets
[785.48 - 791.72] toxic our livers get toxic they come
[787.84 - 795.80] here toxic from our parents yeah they
[791.72 - 800.20] come here um toxic from forefathers they
[795.80 - 803.52] come here with DDT in them from a 100
[800.20 - 806.64] years ago they come with heavy metals
[803.52 - 809.24] from a thousand years ago they come with
[806.64 - 812.12] plastics they come with petrol oil from
[809.24 - 814.80] our parents pumping their own gas okay
[812.12 - 816.68] they come with that the livers and we
[814.80 - 819.60] come into town with these livers you
[816.68 - 821.84] know what I mean and these livers Harbor
[819.60 - 823.36] a lot of toxins a lot of poisons and we
[821.84 - 824.72] can get fatty liver we can get all kinds
[823.36 - 828.44] of liver problems I know this isn't a
[824.72 - 830.56] liver show and um which we did in the
[828.44 - 834.44] past and we do another one in the future
[830.56 - 837.08] too but but that's one of the places
[834.44 - 840.64] it's like the that's the area that's
[837.08 - 843.36] origin the origin one of the Origins so
[840.64 - 845.24] it's not about how to carry your skin on
[843.36 - 847.80] the outside so much sure there's there's
[845.24 - 849.52] some really good natural moisturizers
[847.80 - 851.16] moisturizers with essential oils there's
[849.52 - 855.72] all kinds of different options out there
[851.16 - 857.80] to get the skin to look flashy to look
[855.72 - 860.88] cleaner to look a certain way to feel
[857.80 - 862.68] moist whatever it's all good but you
[860.88 - 865.92] still want to address what's deep down
[862.68 - 867.64] inside and that that's so critical so
[865.92 - 869.48] when it comes down to skin it's about
[867.64 - 872.00] getting your liver better a big part of
[869.48 - 875.84] it and we're going to talk about what
[872.00 - 878.28] makes skin hair nails not so great and
[875.84 - 880.84] the liver for the skin is one of those
[878.28 - 882.52] things so when it comes down to that
[880.84 - 886.24] that's where we are so what happens down
[882.52 - 888.08] in there your liver is is receiving a
[886.24 - 891.40] tremendous amount of blood it's pumping
[888.08 - 894.52] in it's pouring in it's a river of blood
[891.40 - 898.16] gushing into that and into that liver a
[894.52 - 899.52] river of blood it's got oxygen it's got
[898.16 - 902.32] a lot of things things going on there
[899.52 - 904.12] nutrients you name it and the liver but
[902.32 - 905.84] it's got a ton of poisons in there too
[904.12 - 907.60] just pumping into the liver liver has to
[905.84 - 909.56] filter out clean it process it get it
[907.60 - 911.16] ready get it ready to send back up to
[909.56 - 913.80] the heart get it ready to send back all
[911.16 - 917.12] to the other places getting ready to
[913.80 - 921.36] send back to you so that blood is
[917.12 - 923.80] cleaner and gets to your epidermis your
[921.36 - 925.80] epidermis your skin you cut your skin
[923.80 - 927.60] right there that epidermis there right
[925.80 - 930.16] there you cut that little top layer that
[927.60 - 932.60] little little hunk of epidermis tissue
[930.16 - 934.52] right there you cut that it bleeds you
[932.60 - 936.36] scratch that it bleeds how is that
[934.52 - 939.04] possible cuz blood seeps all the way up
[936.36 - 940.44] through the uh subcutaneous fat level
[939.04 - 943.16] level that's underneath there and it
[940.44 - 945.04] seeps right through and it and it just
[943.16 - 946.76] finds its way in the epidermis the blood
[945.04 - 950.40] the oxygen everything travels through
[946.76 - 951.76] tiny microvessels and it gets there and
[950.40 - 955.00] it
[951.76 - 958.08] nourishes nourishes the skin all those
[955.00 - 959.88] little blood vessels the liver nourishes
[958.08 - 961.20] the skin yeah your heart pumps the blood
[959.88 - 962.92] of course pumping blood through your
[961.20 - 964.72] body your blood's being pumped you got a
[962.92 - 967.56] pump you got a pump like a water pump in
[964.72 - 970.32] a car yeah sure you have that you got
[967.56 - 972.96] the pump and um like a sub pump in a
[970.32 - 974.64] basement like a water pump in a car like
[972.96 - 977.64] uh like whatever you know what I mean
[974.64 - 979.84] and so the deal is though that's the
[977.64 - 981.96] liver that has to be the responsible one
[979.84 - 985.20] to make sure that blood's prepped ready
[981.96 - 989.12] go clean good whatnot if that liver is
[985.20 - 992.60] sending up sending up
[989.12 - 993.88] material in that blood it's not so great
[992.60 - 996.20] you're going to age fast you're going to
[993.88 - 997.48] get the liver spots yeah you're going to
[996.20 - 998.72] get all kinds of stuff it's going to
[997.48 - 999.92] start worsening in the skin you're going
[998.72 - 1001.00] to get wrinkles you're going to get flab
[999.92 - 1004.76] your skin you're going to get all kinds
[1001.00 - 1006.68] of different stuff with the skin so it's
[1004.76 - 1008.52] not about toning the skin although
[1006.68 - 1009.92] that's the topical stuff tone the skin
[1008.52 - 1011.40] you go to the Spas you get all these
[1009.92 - 1013.24] treatments you get seaweed wraps
[1011.40 - 1015.48] everything else Under the Sun I get it
[1013.24 - 1017.80] cucumbers in the eyes I understand that
[1015.48 - 1020.44] cucumber slices hey that's right
[1017.80 - 1023.04] cucumber slice spces totally exactly

[1035.96 - 1039.76] the cucumber juice 16 o straight
[1038.00 - 1041.04] cucumbers don't just stick cucumbers in
[1039.76 - 1044.16] a blender and blend it up with some
[1041.04 - 1046.04] water you can do that but I don't really
[1044.16 - 1048.52] like the way that tastes so much all
[1046.04 - 1050.36] right so um hey I think I'm in a better
[1048.52 - 1052.24] mood today myself I don't know I think
[1050.36 - 1055.40] I'm in a good mood today I'm not so
[1052.24 - 1057.56] heavy heavy like I usually am when I'm
[1055.40 - 1059.40] so worried all the time about people and
[1057.56 - 1061.48] the misinformation out there right you
[1059.40 - 1063.92] guys you know I get all passionate and
[1061.48 - 1066.08] razed up but here's the deal here's the
[1063.92 - 1068.04] deal you get the cucumber juice 16
[1066.08 - 1070.72] ounces of cucumber juice 20 ounces of
[1068.04 - 1072.88] cucumber juice whatever you you get it
[1070.72 - 1075.48] you drink it once a day it does help the
[1072.88 - 1076.72] liver it does help the liver somebody
[1075.48 - 1078.08] had it right when they sliced those
[1076.72 - 1080.20] cucumber slices and stuck them in
[1078.08 - 1084.44] people's eye
[1080.20 - 1087.68] sockets somebody had it right all right
[1084.44 - 1089.80] and and so that's what you need to do um
[1087.68 - 1091.28] to help the liver right there you know
[1089.80 - 1092.84] listen you can help the liver with all
[1091.28 - 1095.32] kinds of things stay away from the fried
[1092.84 - 1097.88] greasy Foods stay away from high fat
[1095.32 - 1101.08] foods if you're a Paleo dude if you're a
[1097.88 - 1103.68] Paleo chick you just just cut the fat
[1101.08 - 1105.52] levels down that means make sure that
[1103.68 - 1108.60] Meats the leanest you could find and
[1105.52 - 1111.76] only have it once a day because you need
[1108.60 - 1113.44] room for all those fruits and vegetables
[1111.76 - 1116.04] that's going to cleanse your liver
[1113.44 - 1118.72] because a piece of lean meat whether I
[1116.04 - 1120.92] like it or not or whatever whether
[1118.72 - 1123.48] Spirit likes it or not or you like it or
[1120.92 - 1126.00] not a piece of lean meat does not heal
[1123.48 - 1128.84] the liver that's not how it works that
[1126.00 - 1131.96] that doesn't help your liver but I
[1128.84 - 1133.64] support it 100% if someone I support all
[1131.96 - 1135.20] diets you want you know paleo diet love
[1133.64 - 1137.08] you want vegan diet love whatever I
[1135.20 - 1138.64] support it all but the point is I'm
[1137.08 - 1140.92] talking about what's going to help the
[1138.64 - 1142.92] liver so if you if you think you got
[1140.92 - 1145.60] some liver stuff going on you want your
[1142.92 - 1149.00] skin really nice you cut your animal
[1145.60 - 1151.08] protein down in half I'm not telling you
[1149.00 - 1153.04] you have to quit it that's not my job
[1151.08 - 1155.64] I'm not the food police I'm not the food
[1153.04 - 1158.00] police okay I'm just giving you some
[1155.64 - 1160.44] pieces of truth and you can take it you
[1158.00 - 1162.28] can throw it away but I would take it
[1160.44 - 1164.92] I'd cut the animal protein in half have
[1162.28 - 1167.44] it once a day your favorite one okay
[1164.92 - 1169.72] make sure it's the clean and lean stuff
[1167.44 - 1172.08] so it's not so load it with fats stay
[1169.72 - 1176.60] off the butter stay off the cheese stay
[1172.08 - 1178.80] off the eggs and and keep your fats low
[1176.60 - 1180.36] so if you like your salmon you like your
[1178.80 - 1183.56] you know you like your hbit you like
[1180.36 - 1185.64] your hache you like your salmon um you
[1183.56 - 1187.32] know that's that can work too if you
[1185.64 - 1188.96] like your lean you know lean chicken
[1187.32 - 1191.96] breast if you like your lean turkey
[1188.96 - 1195.04] breast that could work too free range
[1191.96 - 1196.64] farm raised in a good Farm the whole bit
[1195.04 - 1198.64] you know antibiotic free that's great
[1196.64 - 1200.56] you know grass-fed beef the lean stuff
[1198.64 - 1203.08] not the brisket that's filled with fat
[1200.56 - 1204.96] all that fat in the brisket not the pork
[1203.08 - 1207.92] stay away from the stay away from the
[1204.96 - 1209.88] pork okay stay away from that because
[1207.92 - 1213.16] that's not going to help your skin it's
[1209.88 - 1215.00] going to age your skin it's going to age
[1213.16 - 1216.56] it okay yeah sure your skin might have
[1215.00 - 1218.92] got better because you cleaned up your
[1216.56 - 1220.72] diet yeah but it got better maybe
[1218.92 - 1223.52] because you stopped you know donuts and
[1220.72 - 1225.96] you stopped bagels and you stopped you
[1223.52 - 1227.68] canoli and you stopped danishes and you
[1225.96 - 1229.40] stopped a lot of that and and maybe you
[1227.68 - 1232.88] stopped fr food and maybe you stopped
[1229.40 - 1235.24] really greasy fried bad oils and sure it
[1232.88 - 1238.36] got better but it could get even better
[1235.24 - 1241.36] it could get even better if you keep the
[1238.36 - 1243.24] animal proteins down a notch the reason
[1241.36 - 1244.64] why is your skin needs something so
[1243.24 - 1246.32] critical you guys I'm going to tell you
[1244.64 - 1248.92] right now what it is it's not just clean
[1246.32 - 1251.44] blood it's not just the river of clean
[1248.92 - 1255.56] blood coming from that
[1251.44 - 1258.24] liver your skin needs the beta carotenes
[1255.56 - 1260.52] and there's no beta carotene in a high
[1258.24 - 1263.04] fat diet there's no beta carotene in a
[1260.52 - 1264.60] really high animal protein diet and
[1263.04 - 1266.32] people eat vegan diets with no beta
[1264.60 - 1268.00] carotene in there either I'm not picking
[1266.32 - 1270.00] on the meat eaters I'll pick on the
[1268.00 - 1272.36] vegans why not I'll pick on the
[1270.00 - 1274.40] vegetarians I'll pick on everybody then
[1272.36 - 1276.32] okay and what I'm saying is you can have
[1274.40 - 1279.72] a vegetarian diet and have virtually no
[1276.32 - 1282.68] Betty kattin in that diet that's right
[1279.72 - 1285.52] that's right okay and and what happens
[1282.68 - 1287.92] is that skin needs it
[1285.52 - 1291.24] desperately where do those beta keratin
[1287.92 - 1294.12] go come from they come from leafy greens
[1291.24 - 1296.48] leafy greens so you have your chicken
[1294.12 - 1298.40] salad and some leafy greens spinage
[1296.48 - 1300.92] chicken salad right that's what you
[1298.40 - 1303.36] really like if you're vegan you have the
[1300.92 - 1305.32] spinach and you throw in some fruit in
[1303.36 - 1307.36] there throw in anything in your salad if
[1305.32 - 1311.28] you're vegan hey you know you probably
[1307.36 - 1313.00] already know but you don't want less
[1311.28 - 1315.28] beta carotene where else does the beta
[1313.00 - 1319.28] carotene come from comes from the
[1315.28 - 1323.00] powerful color and those mangoes
[1319.28 - 1326.72] mangoes but if you're mango afraid or
[1323.00 - 1330.32] papaya afraid papayas are incredible the
[1326.72 - 1335.40] beta keratin the keratins keratinoid in
[1330.32 - 1338.36] papaya are incredible for the skin
[1335.40 - 1340.44] lifechanging for the skin that papaya
[1338.36 - 1342.08] because those keratins get right up up
[1340.44 - 1345.36] through that subcutaneous fat they get
[1342.08 - 1348.04] driven in the river of blood your liver
[1345.36 - 1349.48] knows you need those keratins for your
[1348.04 - 1350.92] skin but but if you don't provide with
[1349.48 - 1353.12] the liver with what it knows then it's
[1350.92 - 1354.48] sending up blood that's deficient of
[1353.12 - 1359.48] what it
[1354.48 - 1361.20] needs that's right that's right so you
[1359.48 - 1363.32] need that River blood loaded with those
[1361.20 - 1365.64] keratins you could even get slightly
[1363.32 - 1368.16] orange skin which is a beautiful thing a
[1365.64 - 1370.28] beautiful thing that occurs when you've
[1368.16 - 1373.24] been eating a lot of papaya a lot of
[1370.28 - 1376.12] mangoes a lot of sweet potatoes a lot of
[1373.24 - 1378.44] Mam Mam is like a um you know a fruit
[1376.12 - 1380.48] that's that not a lot of people can find
[1378.44 - 1383.60] that's more of a tougher One beta
[1380.48 - 1385.76] keratin lot of raspberries okay but
[1383.60 - 1389.20] especially things like the mangoes the
[1385.76 - 1390.72] papayas um and it melons with color in
[1389.20 - 1393.12] them melons with color have a lot of
[1390.72 - 1395.20] beta Kines and then in the vegetable
[1393.12 - 1397.80] Department leafy green spinach spinach
[1395.20 - 1399.08] is like one of the ultimate beta
[1397.80 - 1403.08] carotene
[1399.08 - 1404.56] providers it re it really is and that is
[1403.08 - 1406.16] incredible for the liver liver can use
[1404.56 - 1408.04] spinach to cleanse cleanse out poisons
[1406.16 - 1409.92] cleanse out toxins right you guys
[1408.04 - 1413.20] cleanse out all those Metals cleanse out
[1409.92 - 1416.88] everything but the liver can also take
[1413.20 - 1419.84] all that carotene and what it does is it
[1416.88 - 1422.04] tags that carotene it tags it and it
[1419.84 - 1425.52] changes it and manipulates it a little
[1422.04 - 1428.12] bit it makes it capable of surviving the
[1425.52 - 1432.20] travel up to the
[1428.12 - 1436.20] skin it makes it possible to travel to
[1432.20 - 1440.28] the skin it works with it the liver is
[1436.20 - 1442.16] the the machine that changes and Alters
[1440.28 - 1445.36] compounds chemical compounds it's the
[1442.16 - 1447.72] chemical compound master and so it
[1445.36 - 1449.56] Alters those keratin and it sends it
[1447.72 - 1450.76] back up to the Derma didn't I tell you I
[1449.56 - 1452.52] was going to give you information never
[1450.76 - 1453.72] heard before didn't I tell you didn't I
[1452.52 - 1456.52] tell you I told you that in a couple
[1453.72 - 1458.52] shows ago maybe comes from Spirit that's
[1456.52 - 1461.24] what I'm talking about and it's not
[1458.52 - 1463.28] misinformation this stuff is powerful it
[1461.24 - 1465.24] is powerful and it is real so that's
[1463.28 - 1469.32] what the liver does what it does is it
[1465.24 - 1473.52] tags those catenoids it Chang ches them
[1469.32 - 1475.92] it Alters them it allows a form of
[1473.52 - 1478.24] methylation no one has their hands on
[1475.92 - 1479.68] yet in science or research a form of
[1478.24 - 1482.80] methylation different than other
[1479.68 - 1485.60] methylations that we talk about and it
[1482.80 - 1488.76] it packages it and it sends it on its
[1485.60 - 1490.96] way fueled what I mean by fueled is the
[1488.76 - 1493.36] blood is fueled in a different way to
[1490.96 - 1495.44] take the keratine up in there if the
[1493.36 - 1498.72] liver knows keratins are going to go to
[1495.44 - 1502.04] the skin it's going to make sure oxygen
[1498.72 - 1503.40] supply is more so in that package that's
[1502.04 - 1507.52] being delivered up through the blood up
[1503.40 - 1509.32] to the skin and that's how it's done so
[1507.52 - 1510.96] if your salad just has some iceberg
[1509.32 - 1513.04] lettuce and it has a little kind of you
[1510.96 - 1515.56] know an orange tomato that's not so
[1513.04 - 1517.28] great got some chicken or tuna in there
[1515.56 - 1518.72] that's your lunch with a little mayo I
[1517.28 - 1520.28] don't know what people do they make the
[1518.72 - 1522.20] may they you know whatever the yeah the
[1520.28 - 1524.32] mayonnaise the whole bit or you got an
[1522.20 - 1526.24] egg in your salad and you got you know
[1524.32 - 1528.32] couple of tomatoes maybe you a couple
[1526.24 - 1530.60] little tiny pieces of cucumber
[1528.32 - 1532.72] and a couple of eggs in your salad and
[1530.60 - 1535.32] and and yeah some tuna and some other
[1532.72 - 1537.08] things or some sliced cold cuts in your
[1535.32 - 1540.32] salad the antipasta salads or whatever
[1537.08 - 1543.04] it's not enough it's not enough got to
[1540.32 - 1545.56] get piece of papaya out have that for
[1543.04 - 1548.40] breakfast you got to do your heavy metal
[1545.56 - 1550.20] detox cleanse clean clean out that liver
[1548.40 - 1553.64] of all the pesticides of all the heavy
[1550.20 - 1556.08] metals get them out right you got to do
[1553.64 - 1558.84] more and if it's overwhelming if it
[1556.08 - 1561.88] feels too much take take it slow take it
[1558.84 - 1564.20] slow you know slow ride just take it
[1561.88 - 1566.52] easy and then take it slow that's the
[1564.20 - 1569.44] bottom line and that's okay that there's
[1566.52 - 1573.24] nothing wrong with that either so kot
[1569.44 - 1576.04] kotes mean everything when it comes to
[1573.24 - 1577.44] skin how the skin looks what it does it
[1576.04 - 1581.44] means everything and then there's
[1577.44 - 1584.60] something else too there's silica hidden
[1581.44 - 1586.64] in vegetables and stems of vegetables
[1584.60 - 1588.72] that matter for the skin that tighten
[1586.64 - 1591.24] the skin silic that's just geared for
[1588.72 - 1592.60] the skin not silica geared for the bones
[1591.24 - 1594.32] there's two different kinds science
[1592.60 - 1596.24] doesn't know that yet science doesn't
[1594.32 - 1598.16] actually know science and research I'm
[1596.24 - 1601.04] going to give you another science fact
[1598.16 - 1603.80] that will come out years down the road
[1601.04 - 1606.88] and silica for the bones is different
[1603.80 - 1609.40] than silica for the skin they're two
[1606.88 - 1611.68] different kinds two different kinds
[1609.40 - 1615.44] science hasn't T hasn't separated them
[1611.68 - 1618.00] yet and the kind that just goes for the
[1615.44 - 1620.72] skin up to the skin is one variety of
[1618.00 - 1624.04] silica that the liver works on making
[1620.72 - 1625.60] sure you know you're provided and that's
[1624.04 - 1627.88] through
[1625.60 - 1630.60] asparagus those beautiful
[1627.88 - 1631.72] asparagus okay that's one place it comes
[1630.60 - 1633.68] from
[1631.72 - 1635.80] artichokes artichokes which is
[1633.68 - 1638.00] incredible for the liver lots of silicon
[1635.80 - 1639.32] artichokes if you look up artichokes and
[1638.00 - 1641.32] you find there's no silicon in there
[1639.32 - 1643.84] it's because they just didn't they just
[1641.32 - 1646.20] didn't add that part in did you know
[1643.84 - 1648.64] artichokes have a thousand chemical
[1646.20 - 1651.16] compounds vitamins mineral subgroups
[1648.64 - 1653.04] amino acids everything undiscovered
[1651.16 - 1656.32] science research just isn't getting it
[1653.04 - 1659.24] done in the lab same way other things
[1656.32 - 1661.84] don't work in this world where nothing
[1659.24 - 1664.00] gets done in all that systematic stuff
[1661.84 - 1666.12] that you know that whole realm you know
[1664.00 - 1668.64] what I'm talking about how nothing
[1666.12 - 1670.64] really gets done how it takes you know
[1668.64 - 1672.80] takes 30 years to get something
[1670.64 - 1675.04] straightened out at the motor vehicle
[1672.80 - 1678.52] okay so you don't need you don't need a
[1675.04 - 1682.76] lesson on how the world works
[1678.52 - 1684.96] on that level so the bottom line is is
[1682.76 - 1687.84] artichokes you got the asparagus it's
[1684.96 - 1691.96] really good stems little stems of the
[1687.84 - 1695.04] kale have silica in them for the skin
[1691.96 - 1697.76] that's another thing horse tail the herb
[1695.04 - 1699.88] nettle Leaf the herb you can take horse
[1697.76 - 1701.32] tail horsetail is known to help help to
[1699.88 - 1703.24] help skin hair and nails that's because
[1701.32 - 1704.84] of the type of silica but but it's still
[1703.24 - 1706.68] it's still not the same silica that goes
[1704.84 - 1709.12] to Bones technically it's still there's
[1706.68 - 1710.96] two kinds that are are in horsetail
[1709.12 - 1712.64] there's two kinds of silica in Nettle
[1710.96 - 1714.32] Leaf there's two kinds of silica in
[1712.64 - 1716.52] these other things and they get
[1714.32 - 1718.72] separated by the liver and delivered
[1716.52 - 1720.48] that's brand new information I'm just
[1718.72 - 1724.00] putting out there for you guys so you
[1720.48 - 1726.12] guys have things to heal and you know
[1724.00 - 1728.12] these are just different things for the
[1726.12 - 1730.52] skin we're talking about now the big
[1728.12 - 1734.76] skin I hope we can get to Hair and Nails
[1730.52 - 1737.00] I swear the big skin thing all the time
[1734.76 - 1738.64] is protein protein protein protein
[1737.00 - 1741.76] protein protein you need protein you
[1738.64 - 1744.44] need protein oh my God dear God if I
[1741.76 - 1746.36] hear protein one more time out there
[1744.44 - 1748.16] okay because it's literally just all
[1746.36 - 1749.80] people kind of know in the health realm
[1748.16 - 1752.40] professional realm is is protein they've
[1749.80 - 1755.04] been brainwashed to thinking protein
[1752.40 - 1757.76] stands for everything it doesn't it
[1755.04 - 1759.76] doesn't I can go I could do a show just
[1757.76 - 1761.20] on protein and yeah people will throw
[1759.76 - 1763.56] Rotten Tomatoes at me and rotten
[1761.20 - 1765.08] potatoes at me and stones and rocks and
[1763.56 - 1767.80] they'll have torches and pitchforks and
[1765.08 - 1769.84] try to burn my house down absolutely
[1767.80 - 1772.04] because that's how ingrained protein is
[1769.84 - 1773.60] into the system right now you can't eat
[1772.04 - 1776.04] that's like literally that's
[1773.60 - 1777.76] controversial that's controversal it's
[1776.04 - 1779.84] not politically correct to talk about
[1777.76 - 1783.08] protein right now so I have I have to be
[1779.84 - 1785.00] careful isn't that silly so the deal is
[1783.08 - 1786.24] is that yes proteins are important
[1785.00 - 1787.56] they're important when they come from a
[1786.24 - 1789.32] kale Leaf they're important when they
[1787.56 - 1790.80] come from a spinach leaf spinach they're
[1789.32 - 1793.52] important from they they come from a
[1790.80 - 1795.20] lentil a lentil they're important when
[1793.52 - 1798.44] they come from a black bean they're
[1795.20 - 1800.52] important when they come from a walnut
[1798.44 - 1803.32] because those are important proteins but
[1800.52 - 1805.76] those proteins that come from there
[1803.32 - 1809.20] still aren't really what hair skin and
[1805.76 - 1812.52] nails are are derived from or made made
[1809.20 - 1815.24] out of because there's thousands and
[1812.52 - 1816.96] hundreds of different of of of compounds
[1815.24 - 1819.04] and chemical functions and different
[1816.96 - 1821.36] minerals and vitamins and subgroups that
[1819.04 - 1825.48] I'm talking about that are
[1821.36 - 1829.20] responsible for Hair Skin and nails and
[1825.48 - 1832.08] the liver is like the master behind that
[1829.20 - 1833.92] one of the Masters especially the master
[1832.08 - 1836.04] so very important to understand so you
[1833.92 - 1838.08] need to know it's not about more protein
[1836.04 - 1839.84] more protein the more protein you do the
[1838.08 - 1842.12] more tired the liver gets though you got
[1839.84 - 1844.80] to be careful the more tired the liver
[1842.12 - 1846.92] gets the more protein you do so you got
[1844.80 - 1848.72] to keep you like like I'm saying if you
[1846.92 - 1851.36] are vegan you got to be careful you
[1848.72 - 1853.04] don't do just an all vegan protein diet
[1851.36 - 1855.60] you got to be careful it's not just all
[1853.04 - 1858.24] protein shakes if you're a vegan you got
[1855.60 - 1860.44] to be careful about that there's plenty
[1858.24 - 1862.44] of protein in spirulina there's plenty
[1860.44 - 1863.92] of protein in barley grass juice powder
[1862.44 - 1865.40] there's plenty of protein in fruits and
[1863.92 - 1866.72] vegetables there's plenty of proteins
[1865.40 - 1869.96] and even sweet potatoes you got to be
[1866.72 - 1871.52] careful though that as a vegan or a raw
[1869.96 - 1874.40] food vegan or whatever that you're not
[1871.52 - 1876.36] just trying to reach protein needs 24/7
[1874.40 - 1878.64] you got to be cautious on that and if
[1876.36 - 1880.40] you're a Paleo person you got to watch
[1878.64 - 1882.44] out you don't over inh aate with the
[1880.40 - 1884.20] animal protein you got to cut it back a
[1882.44 - 1885.84] bit because it will tire out your liver
[1884.20 - 1888.48] no matter how good shape you think or
[1885.84 - 1891.48] you're in or how good you feel you still
[1888.48 - 1892.92] will shorten the life of your liver and
[1891.48 - 1895.36] affect the Hair Skin and Nails
[1892.92 - 1897.64] eventually somehow some way some some
[1895.36 - 1899.84] possibility if you say well how come one
[1897.64 - 1902.00] person's hair skin and Nails goes bad
[1899.84 - 1904.20] and the other one doesn't because I told
[1902.00 - 1905.80] you you come in here with liver stuff
[1904.20 - 1907.24] that you inherit some people inherit a
[1905.80 - 1909.52] hell of a lot more with the liver than
[1907.24 - 1911.32] other people some people have so much
[1909.52 - 1914.08] stress in their life early on that their
[1911.32 - 1917.64] adrenals cause problems with their liver
[1914.08 - 1920.12] and adrenaline kills Hair Skin and nails
[1917.64 - 1923.64] you go through a loss of a loved one
[1920.12 - 1926.00] your hair a year later can be shot shot
[1923.64 - 1927.84] I've watched it I've seen it for decades
[1926.00 - 1930.36] you go through a trying time you get
[1927.84 - 1931.64] betrayal betrayal happens which is some
[1930.36 - 1933.48] of the worst things that could ever
[1931.64 - 1936.24] happen is when someone betrays you oh
[1933.48 - 1938.44] dear lord it's probably one of the worst
[1936.24 - 1940.44] and when you're betrayed you know your
[1938.44 - 1943.44] hair falls apart it could fall out of
[1940.44 - 1946.24] your head it can it can just it can just
[1943.44 - 1948.12] come out not just that be come out like
[1946.24 - 1949.64] straw turn into to straw and if it
[1948.12 - 1952.24] doesn't turn in straw that week it can
[1949.64 - 1954.44] turn in straw a year later this is
[1952.24 - 1958.04] because of adrenaline this is because of
[1954.44 - 1959.72] you know the pain we get from fear and
[1958.04 - 1961.44] insecurity and being up because we've
[1959.72 - 1964.08] been Something's Happened or trustman
[1961.44 - 1966.20] broken or you know a loss in Life or
[1964.08 - 1966.92] financial burden or stress or whatever
[1966.20 - 1969.48] it
[1966.92 - 1972.12] is it cranks up the adrenaline
[1969.48 - 1974.40] adrenaline's corrosive it hinders the
[1972.12 - 1977.28] lier it hinders everything it's okay
[1974.40 - 1979.04] it's just a natural part of life I mean
[1977.28 - 1982.04] but it hinders things and it knocks the
[1979.04 - 1983.72] skin back it stretches the skin and if
[1982.04 - 1984.84] you're worried about you you go to a
[1983.72 - 1986.80] practitioner and they're all just
[1984.84 - 1989.48] talking protein and only protein it's
[1986.80 - 1990.68] like just that's not the answer either
[1989.48 - 1992.24] of course they give you a bunch of
[1990.68 - 1993.56] supplements though different supplements
[1992.24 - 1996.24] and that could improve your health but
[1993.56 - 1998.28] it wasn't the protein that did you need
[1996.24 - 1999.92] to know you know it's other things
[1998.28 - 2001.88] supplements and everything else so just
[1999.92 - 2003.56] keep that feather in your cap too for
[2001.88 - 2005.68] the person that says well I went to my
[2003.56 - 2008.12] doctor my doctor said I had severe
[2005.68 - 2010.16] protein deficient efficiency he changed
[2008.12 - 2011.60] my diet for higher protein I started
[2010.16 - 2013.28] getting better but he probably gave you
[2011.60 - 2015.36] 10 vitamins too that you never took
[2013.28 - 2017.12] before in your life and that started
[2015.36 - 2018.56] clearing up some deficiencies from all
[2017.12 - 2020.52] that you've been through and that's why
[2018.56 - 2021.96] you're improving or took away bad foods
[2020.52 - 2024.60] and you're not eating cakes and cookies
[2021.96 - 2027.36] anymore realize it's not protein that is
[2024.60 - 2029.52] the the answer for all and you look you
[2027.36 - 2031.20] hair hair care products proteins are in
[2029.52 - 2032.44] there that's ridiculous you look at all
[2031.20 - 2035.00] these other things proteins are in there
[2032.44 - 2037.92] that's not how it works our hair stays
[2035.00 - 2041.24] good because our adrenal stay good one
[2037.92 - 2043.36] way to keep hair strong is is
[2041.24 - 2045.48] ashwagandha and it's an herb that you're
[2043.36 - 2048.76] familiar with probably some of you are
[2045.48 - 2051.04] ashwagandha I you know I I I have it on
[2048.76 - 2053.40] the directory at Medical medium.com I
[2051.04 - 2054.64] don't sell it I don't sell supplements
[2053.40 - 2056.00] just telling you that one more time I
[2054.64 - 2057.60] know I talk like a broken record it's
[2056.00 - 2059.12] for the new people that came on board
[2057.60 - 2061.80] and and think I'm trying to be a
[2059.12 - 2063.64] Salesman I I want you to get my book but
[2061.80 - 2065.68] that's not to sell it I just want you to
[2063.64 - 2067.68] get it for health and wellness and and
[2065.68 - 2070.12] well-being I want it to change your life
[2067.68 - 2072.32] I want it to save your lives but the
[2070.12 - 2074.40] deal is you can go and get the
[2072.32 - 2075.80] ashwaganda bring that into you can talk
[2074.40 - 2079.08] to your practitioner but that's an
[2075.80 - 2083.60] amazing very powerful very fruitful very
[2079.08 - 2085.20] fruitful herb to make hair turn around
[2083.60 - 2087.76] that's a great one it supports the
[2085.20 - 2089.72] adrenals it does help the hair I've seen
[2087.76 - 2092.24] people do ashwaganda for two months and
[2089.72 - 2094.68] hair change so that's something to just
[2092.24 - 2096.92] always know that information's out there
[2094.68 - 2099.12] but I've been telling people about that
[2096.92 - 2100.60] long before the internet and that so
[2099.12 - 2102.32] that's information's out there I don't
[2100.60 - 2104.68] know where it originally sourced from it
[2102.32 - 2106.00] could have come from me easily but the
[2104.68 - 2107.52] deal is and it could have come from me
[2106.00 - 2111.20] 20 years ago the deal is you bring in
[2107.52 - 2113.72] the Ashana nettle Leaf nettle Leaf is
[2111.20 - 2115.88] another very fruitful powerful way for
[2113.72 - 2119.40] women to get hair back nettle Leaf do
[2115.88 - 2121.88] the nettle Leaf teas nettle Leaf teas
[2119.40 - 2124.64] okay drinking a nettle leaf tea great
[2121.88 - 2126.52] way to get hair back lemon balm tea
[2124.64 - 2129.00] great way to get hair back lemon balm
[2126.52 - 2131.40] tin ures I also have the in the
[2129.00 - 2133.68] directory nettle tinctures I have in the
[2131.40 - 2136.48] directory nettle capsules the right in
[2133.68 - 2139.08] the right kinds they get hair back
[2136.48 - 2141.92] here's the deal you look at a skin hair
[2139.08 - 2145.04] um formula skin hair nails formula it
[2141.92 - 2148.44] might have horse tail in it but I can't
[2145.04 - 2150.20] even tell you how ridiculously small
[2148.44 - 2154.24] amount of horse tail that could be in
[2150.20 - 2156.40] there a speck because it's it's made of
[2154.24 - 2159.32] fillers and plus all these other things
[2156.40 - 2161.92] maybe herbs maybe amino acids it's all
[2159.32 - 2164.12] packed in this tablet but if you took
[2161.92 - 2167.08] out the horse tail it would be Joker's
[2164.12 - 2169.76] host you horse tail Joker's horsetail
[2167.08 - 2171.44] like no joke so if you took out the
[2169.76 - 2174.36] nettle Leaf in something it would be
[2171.44 - 2177.48] Joker's nettle leaf and probably a
[2174.36 - 2179.84] crappy kind when you take nettle Leaf
[2177.48 - 2183.04] you know like three capsules a day when
[2179.84 - 2185.76] you take dropper FS of nettle Leaf daily
[2183.04 - 2187.44] you get the hair back and by the way
[2185.76 - 2189.28] that also reflects back into the liver
[2187.44 - 2191.20] and helps the liver too cuz liver has a
[2189.28 - 2193.40] lot to do with hair if your liver is
[2191.20 - 2195.76] maxed out if you're getting a maxed out
[2193.40 - 2198.04] liver whether the doctor sees it or not
[2195.76 - 2199.76] hair can start becoming problem
[2198.04 - 2201.84] problematic falling out all kinds of
[2199.76 - 2203.76] different issues dermatitis on the scalp
[2201.84 - 2206.48] eczema can occur psoriasis I talked
[2203.76 - 2210.36] about aiment psoriasis in the other show
[2206.48 - 2212.60] and that could play a role in some some
[2210.36 - 2215.28] scalp issue skin you know skin issues on
[2212.60 - 2218.12] the head hair loss with that as well
[2215.28 - 2219.64] alopecia alope IA isn't an autoimmune
[2218.12 - 2221.64] disease where the body's attacking the
[2219.64 - 2223.84] hair follicles and the hair falls out
[2221.64 - 2226.84] that's misinformation once again the
[2223.84 - 2228.84] blame is on us for um you know for it
[2226.84 - 2230.84] being our fault because medical science
[2228.84 - 2233.64] and research doesn't know it causes
[2230.84 - 2237.12] alopecia don't I sell sound snarky and
[2233.64 - 2239.16] and sarcastic now today so I have to I
[2237.12 - 2241.68] can't help it I can't help it I'm not
[2239.16 - 2243.88] perfect I can't help it but you know
[2241.68 - 2245.44] what it is is that the alope ship you
[2243.88 - 2247.36] know people who have that they're told
[2245.44 - 2249.80] their bodies destroying the air follicle
[2247.36 - 2252.92] so it's the body's fault no it's an
[2249.80 - 2255.68] adrenal issue there's a hormone missing
[2252.92 - 2258.36] out of the adrenal it's one of the
[2255.68 - 2259.48] because people think medical research
[2258.36 - 2261.00] and medical science thinks that
[2259.48 - 2264.08] adrenaline is just made out of two
[2261.00 - 2267.20] things like cortisol and epinephrine and
[2264.08 - 2268.80] and no it's not it's a complicated
[2267.20 - 2273.40] divide it's a
[2268.80 - 2275.28] complicated um group group of hormones
[2273.40 - 2277.56] really complicated science hasn't
[2275.28 - 2279.24] stripped them apart and one of those
[2277.56 - 2281.68] hormones coming out of the adrenals
[2279.24 - 2284.20] that's undocumented undiscovered by
[2281.68 - 2287.96] Medical Science and medical research is
[2284.20 - 2290.68] missing missing for the woman that has
[2287.96 - 2292.60] alopecia it's missing and that's why so
[2290.68 - 2294.72] the aagana can be a great support to
[2292.60 - 2297.56] help get that back so a trace of that
[2294.72 - 2299.96] can come back to the adrenal and get
[2297.56 - 2302.12] hair to grow back I've had people with
[2299.96 - 2304.44] alipa lost all their hair nothing could
[2302.12 - 2305.84] get it back and then it's come back with
[2304.44 - 2307.96] doing all the right things getting the
[2305.84 - 2312.76] liver better getting the adrenals better
[2307.96 - 2315.72] see the deeper deeper issues deep down
[2312.76 - 2317.32] inside so um we're going to have to
[2315.72 - 2320.48] listen to this show again because I'm
[2317.32 - 2322.88] going so fast with with the
[2320.48 - 2326.00] information taking a deep breath deep
[2322.88 - 2327.64] breath for you too take a deep breath in
[2326.00 - 2330.16] we'll do a meditation now take a deep
[2327.64 - 2334.48] breath in and take a deep breath out
[2330.16 - 2336.60] relax exhale so um we talked about
[2334.48 - 2339.04] adrenaline stress and damage causing
[2336.60 - 2343.28] hair problems hair falling out can
[2339.04 - 2345.32] happen months after a breakup a breakup
[2343.28 - 2348.40] um uh husband and wife break up
[2345.32 - 2351.24] girlfriend boyfriend break up and and it
[2348.40 - 2353.04] can happen just like that uh lose a
[2351.24 - 2355.48] soulmate something happens and months
[2353.04 - 2357.08] later and then it can stay falling out
[2355.48 - 2360.00] for quite some time because there's
[2357.08 - 2362.08] nothing being replenished properly I
[2360.00 - 2363.88] like spirina helps bring back hair I
[2362.08 - 2365.88] like barley grass juice powder helps
[2363.88 - 2368.16] bring back hair I talk to nettle Leaf
[2365.88 - 2370.36] the lemon bomb ashwaganda helps bring
[2368.16 - 2373.24] back hair these are some of the powerful
[2370.36 - 2375.08] things that does help milk thistle can
[2373.24 - 2377.96] help bring back hair a little bit milk
[2375.08 - 2380.80] thistle for the liver zinc can help
[2377.96 - 2385.32] bring back hair and help skin let's go
[2380.80 - 2387.52] to um um oh yes silica products I would
[2385.32 - 2389.52] do the other silica products so not just
[2387.52 - 2391.16] horsetail or not just the silica that I
[2389.52 - 2393.96] was talking about that comes from the
[2391.16 - 2396.80] artichoke you can do the other type of
[2393.96 - 2398.72] silica for bones it does also help with
[2396.80 - 2400.68] other things so I do want silica
[2398.72 - 2402.28] products in general I like them I put I
[2400.68 - 2404.96] have a couple of silica products on the
[2402.28 - 2409.76] directory as well so some of the things
[2404.96 - 2412.88] to think about Foods Foods figs figs are
[2409.76 - 2416.00] wonderful wonderful for hair figs figs
[2412.88 - 2417.96] are wonderful for anything um as far as
[2416.00 - 2420.84] with women with all kinds of issues with
[2417.96 - 2423.76] women reproductive systems hair skin
[2420.84 - 2425.84] nails figs are a big deal get the dried
[2423.76 - 2427.00] figs if you can't get the the the um
[2425.84 - 2428.16] other figs
[2427.00 - 2429.56] I know what some of you are thinking
[2428.16 - 2431.96] you're like well I can't eat sugar I
[2429.56 - 2433.52] can't eat a fig I can't eat sugar well
[2431.96 - 2435.12] that's just I'm sorry but that the
[2433.52 - 2437.28] belief system you have to you have to
[2435.12 - 2439.56] break a little bit I had to break all my
[2437.28 - 2442.76] belief systems I had to break them all
[2439.56 - 2445.28] you know Spirit taught me to break
[2442.76 - 2447.64] through my belief systems and spirit
[2445.28 - 2449.64] said I had no choice I said no no I have
[2447.64 - 2452.00] a choice I I'm my own person I could
[2449.64 - 2453.84] have a belief system and spirit said no
[2452.00 - 2455.36] you can't if you're going to help people
[2453.84 - 2456.44] you can't have a belief system cuz it's
[2455.36 - 2457.60] going to be something different for for
[2456.44 - 2459.80] someone else and it's going to be a
[2457.60 - 2461.68] problem that they need to do and someone
[2459.80 - 2463.68] who's told they can't have sugar from
[2461.68 - 2465.76] fruit that's a belief system instilled
[2463.68 - 2467.84] and if you have that same belief system
[2465.76 - 2470.44] you can't help that person spirit said
[2467.84 - 2472.28] when I was younger said no you you can't
[2470.44 - 2474.24] do this then you're you're not cut for
[2472.28 - 2475.76] this job I remember when I said to
[2474.24 - 2477.20] Spirit good I don't want the job when I
[2475.76 - 2478.84] was a kid I was I don't want the job
[2477.20 - 2480.84] spirit said too bad yeah you have the
[2478.84 - 2482.88] job we can't change that you have the
[2480.84 - 2484.28] job so you have to survive this I said
[2482.88 - 2487.16] all right I busted through my belief
[2484.28 - 2493.00] systems when I was younger and
[2487.16 - 2496.00] so um figs and uh cherries cherries are
[2493.00 - 2497.24] also really good for the liver very good
[2496.00 - 2498.76] for the liver wild blueberries are
[2497.24 - 2500.24] really good for the liver too in fact
[2498.76 - 2503.36] the most powerful food for the liver but
[2500.24 - 2505.20] cherries are good for the liver too so
[2503.36 - 2507.04] look for Cherries Berries of all kinds
[2505.20 - 2509.52] are good for the liver berries of all
[2507.04 - 2513.76] kinds are good for hair skin
[2509.52 - 2515.60] nails um and uh and then like I told
[2513.76 - 2517.60] told you about for skin the papayas the
[2515.60 - 2522.04] mangoes remember that
[2517.60 - 2523.84] bananas bananas bananas are great for
[2522.04 - 2525.28] the liver great for the intestinal tract
[2523.84 - 2527.00] flushing out poisons at the liver
[2525.28 - 2531.48] ascending down to the intestinal tract
[2527.00 - 2535.04] so those are great for hair skin nails
[2531.48 - 2538.84] now potassium is a critical element for
[2535.04 - 2541.32] the skin potassium is it comes from figs
[2538.84 - 2544.44] it comes from avocados it comes from
[2541.32 - 2546.60] bananas that's a good one too all right
[2544.44 - 2547.88] now Omega-3s are really good for the
[2546.60 - 2551.24] skin as well so they're really good
[2547.88 - 2552.84] Omega-3s hemp seeds walnuts if you're
[2551.24 - 2554.48] sensitive to walnuts cuz some people are
[2552.84 - 2556.16] sensitive to nuts and that's true they
[2554.48 - 2558.44] are I mean to people everybody's
[2556.16 - 2560.56] different exactly so why I had to break
[2558.44 - 2562.76] all my belief systems because someone
[2560.56 - 2564.20] might not farewell with a walnut they
[2562.76 - 2566.28] get sensitive they get they get the
[2564.20 - 2567.56] funny kind of feeling from the tannins
[2566.28 - 2570.88] of the walnut in their mouth and they
[2567.56 - 2573.36] don't like that but the deal is walnuts
[2570.88 - 2576.44] are really helpful for skin hair and
[2573.36 - 2578.76] nails they're helpful for the liver um
[2576.44 - 2581.32] you know hemp seeds like I was talking
[2578.76 - 2584.12] before sprouted
[2581.32 - 2587.00] lentils that's a different kind of
[2584.12 - 2589.56] protein when you sprout the lentil the
[2587.00 - 2590.84] protein divides into a carbohydrate
[2589.56 - 2594.36] turns into a
[2590.84 - 2596.36] glycogen that carbohydrate is incredible
[2594.36 - 2598.64] for the skin hair and nails sprouted
[2596.36 - 2600.84] lentils learn how to sprout lentils we
[2598.64 - 2603.04] can help you you know go on my Facebook
[2600.84 - 2604.64] group hop on the you know the uh the
[2603.04 - 2606.84] Facebook group and just and ask about

[2606.84 - 2612.72] um so all these things matter so let's
[2609.52 - 2615.24] go to nails for a little bit white spots
[2612.72 - 2618.28] in the nails divots in the nails messed
[2615.24 - 2620.92] up Nails in all kinds of ways um ridges

[2630.24 - 2635.04] goes away did someone say that one did
[2632.44 - 2636.96] you say that one okay so yeah so these
[2635.04 - 2639.44] you know the in the Nails you have all
[2636.96 - 2642.80] these different problems one of the one
[2639.44 - 2645.00] of the biggest reasons for that um is
[2642.80 - 2647.88] zinc deficiencies real real zinc
[2645.00 - 2649.68] deficiencies longstanding pumpkin seeds
[2647.88 - 2650.96] pumpkin seeds Aren't Enough at first
[2649.68 - 2652.64] though you but you need to do the
[2650.96 - 2655.04] pumpkin seeds by the way the Omega-3s
[2652.64 - 2658.08] from pumpkin seeds are really good for
[2655.04 - 2663.56] Hair Skin and Nails Mega 3s Mega 6 is
[2658.08 - 2666.76] for um um also in um sesame seeds are
[2663.56 - 2668.40] good too but let's go back to this the
[2666.76 - 2670.80] nails you get the bumps in the nails the
[2668.40 - 2672.32] bridges you get the white spots you get
[2670.80 - 2674.76] the you know the divots you get the
[2672.32 - 2676.96] pockets you get the whole bit and that's
[2674.76 - 2679.36] zinc deficiency partly zinc deficiency
[2676.96 - 2682.12] the other part is a liver issue a liver
[2679.36 - 2685.04] issue that's the other part of all the
[2682.12 - 2686.68] nail problems that's adrenaline it's a
[2685.04 - 2688.76] lot of adrenaline you've been exposed to
[2686.68 - 2692.04] in your life from certain circumstances
[2688.76 - 2693.96] whether it's been falling in love so you
[2692.04 - 2698.40] know falling in love the first part of
[2693.96 - 2702.80] Falling in Love Is is explosively
[2698.40 - 2705.68] wonderful but takes a toll usually a lot
[2702.80 - 2707.84] of people who fall in love the first
[2705.68 - 2710.44] time they fall in love that very first
[2707.84 - 2714.88] time where it's like that magical moment
[2710.44 - 2717.84] you feel inside of you that's hormones
[2714.88 - 2719.60] that are produced by your adrenals
[2717.84 - 2721.76] that's the mix it's one of the 56
[2719.60 - 2723.76] different blends that I've brought to
[2721.76 - 2725.60] the table if you're new to the show and
[2723.76 - 2728.12] you've never read book one you got to
[2725.60 - 2730.12] learn about the 56 different blends of
[2728.12 - 2732.12] adrenaline that don't exist in research
[2730.12 - 2733.72] and science I don't care what books out
[2732.12 - 2735.20] there I don't care what experts out
[2733.72 - 2738.64] there and the top health expert they
[2735.20 - 2740.76] don't know about it um yeah I'm boasting
[2738.64 - 2744.84] for Spirit not boasting for myself I'm
[2740.76 - 2747.36] boasting for spirit so so that explosive
[2744.84 - 2749.16] falling in love thing it's like a it's
[2747.36 - 2751.00] like a time bomb though in a sense
[2749.16 - 2753.88] meaning like it's the most wonderful
[2751.00 - 2756.44] beautiful special thing and at the same
[2753.88 - 2759.72] time it wears and tears on the body and
[2756.44 - 2761.44] that's why we've naturally the love
[2759.72 - 2765.24] turns into a
[2761.44 - 2767.80] compassionate deeper love that that's
[2765.24 - 2770.00] more so than the surface explosion love
[2767.80 - 2773.08] when you first meet somebody it then
[2770.00 - 2775.84] goes into a companionship love a forever
[2773.08 - 2778.12] love a a love of you know that soulmate
[2775.84 - 2779.64] love it turns into a deeper love where
[2778.12 - 2781.88] the adrenaline's aren't the adrenals
[2779.64 - 2783.84] aren't surging to that degree anymore
[2781.88 - 2786.00] but falling in love at the very first
[2783.84 - 2788.04] time that's when a lot of people come
[2786.00 - 2789.96] down with mono that's when a lot of
[2788.04 - 2791.52] people come down with mono they fall in
[2789.96 - 2793.84] love for the first time and they they're
[2791.52 - 2795.48] up all night in love and they're they're
[2793.84 - 2796.28] spending time with that person that
[2795.48 - 2798.44] they're in love with and they're
[2796.28 - 2800.12] thinking about the person 24 day 24
[2798.44 - 2802.24] hours a day and they're not sleeping for
[2800.12 - 2803.76] those first few weeks and and all the
[2802.24 - 2805.16] adrenaline is pumping and surging
[2803.76 - 2806.56] through their body and hormones is
[2805.16 - 2808.32] surging through their body and they come
[2806.56 - 2810.68] down with mono or the worst strep threat
[2808.32 - 2814.00] they've ever had that happens for 70% of
[2810.68 - 2818.32] the people that fall in love and but at
[2814.00 - 2820.84] the same time that causes a deficiency
[2818.32 - 2824.28] falling in love causes a physical
[2820.84 - 2826.24] deficiency even though it helps heal the
[2824.28 - 2829.64] soul too you know it's healing for the
[2826.24 - 2831.16] soul it's a it causes a deficiency so
[2829.64 - 2832.68] that's why you got to make sure the
[2831.16 - 2834.24] fruits and vegetables and everything we
[2832.68 - 2836.48] talk about are in there the herbs
[2834.24 - 2838.16] everything are in there no matter what's
[2836.48 - 2840.48] going on and then it's not just falling
[2838.16 - 2842.04] in love it's falling out of love meaning
[2840.48 - 2843.64] something happening in a relationship
[2842.04 - 2845.20] that takes the toll the worst that's
[2843.64 - 2846.84] much worse that's when the stress comes
[2845.20 - 2848.36] on that's when the hardship comes on
[2846.84 - 2850.12] that's when the Heartbreak comes on and
[2848.36 - 2852.40] that really breaks down the immune
[2850.12 - 2854.24] system the divorces and everything else
[2852.40 - 2855.56] we just life goes through and people go
[2854.24 - 2858.76] through we all go through whatever
[2855.56 - 2860.76] happens in life and and that takes a
[2858.76 - 2863.00] toll and guess what suffers from it the
[2860.76 - 2865.76] nails they get paper thin brittle and
[2863.00 - 2868.56] beaten down the liver gets beaten down
[2865.76 - 2871.32] so we got to restore we have to restore
[2868.56 - 2873.24] and it's not Protein that's the answer
[2871.32 - 2875.44] your nails are falling apart it's
[2873.24 - 2878.16] minerals it's vitamins it's not protein
[2875.44 - 2880.04] it's minerals and its vitamins and
[2878.16 - 2882.24] that's the key always remember that so
[2880.04 - 2884.44] those nails are falling apart you want
[2882.24 - 2886.20] to make sure you got the zinc the
[2884.44 - 2888.24] selenium I would get the selenium
[2886.20 - 2890.68] supplement I would get the manganese
[2888.24 - 2892.88] supplement okay so manganese ionic
[2890.68 - 2894.64] manganese check out you know check it
[2892.88 - 2895.84] all out in my directory like I said so
[2894.64 - 2897.92] you get the right one you don't get one
[2895.84 - 2899.44] with citric acid one with poison in it
[2897.92 - 2902.44] one that's just broken down all the
[2899.44 - 2904.76] wrong way but you the manganese okay the
[2902.44 - 2906.84] malinam hey I said that right today
[2904.76 - 2908.60] malinam that's tongue twister look at
[2906.84 - 2910.88] look at the word and say that one that's
[2908.60 - 2913.56] such tongue twister it's not even funny
[2910.88 - 2916.64] miminum selenium
[2913.56 - 2918.40] manganese okay um and and zinc zinc's
[2916.64 - 2921.08] the big one make sure you bring these in
[2918.40 - 2922.76] do a little bit of this for a month and
[2921.08 - 2924.52] what's going to happen is your nails are
[2922.76 - 2926.28] going to get better bring in the silica
[2924.52 - 2927.92] too bring in the silica silica is not
[2926.28 - 2930.76] straight protein it's not that's not
[2927.92 - 2933.00] what it is bring in the silica see and
[2930.76 - 2934.72] the nails start getting better eat more
[2933.00 - 2936.28] fruits and vegetables cleanse the liver
[2934.72 - 2937.88] get the liver stronger stronger and your
[2936.28 - 2939.88] nails will start getting better
[2937.88 - 2942.04] spirulina has protein in it but it's the
[2939.88 - 2945.04] keres and the spirulina that get the
[2942.04 - 2948.28] skin better very
[2945.04 - 2950.24] important very important the ashwagandha
[2948.28 - 2953.08] gets the adrenal stronger that's why
[2950.24 - 2954.92] hair grows back with ashwagandha that's
[2953.08 - 2956.76] another thing that really helps the more
[2954.92 - 2958.92] you cleanse your liver though and clean
[2956.76 - 2961.72] it up and don't hamper it down with too
[2958.92 - 2964.52] many animal fats or if you're vegetarian
[2961.72 - 2968.48] or vegan too much plant protein that's
[2964.52 - 2970.80] powdered or you know or in you know gobs
[2968.48 - 2972.88] of empty plant protein that's thrown in
[2970.80 - 2974.48] packages because vegans feel that
[2972.88 - 2977.32] they're in fear that they better keep up
[2974.48 - 2979.60] with protein that could wear down the
[2977.32 - 2981.68] liver right so you see what I'm saying
[2979.60 - 2984.48] so I'm giving you everything I got and
[2981.68 - 2989.20] I'm not picking on one particular diet
[2984.48 - 2991.20] I'm in it for you I'm in it for you okay
[2989.20 - 2993.64] and you're doing your part if you try
[2991.20 - 2996.12] one little thing and that makes me have
[2993.64 - 2998.08] to do my part over here cuz cuz I got to
[2996.12 - 3002.56] do it if I don't do my part then what
[2998.08 - 3004.76] the heck got to do my part you guys um
[3002.56 - 3006.52] okay all right so the Omega-3s I talked
[3004.76 - 3009.12] about earlier look for an omega-3 fish
[3006.52 - 3011.24] oil isn't the omega-3 of choice that you
[3009.12 - 3013.36] want for Hair Skin and Nails you want
[3011.24 - 3015.04] the plant-based even if you're paleo if
[3013.36 - 3018.08] you're paleo even if you're eating
[3015.04 - 3019.56] salmon it's the oils that they put
[3018.08 - 3021.16] together in krill and fish oil they are
[3019.56 - 3023.28] so highly concentrated that there's a
[3021.16 - 3024.72] level of methyl mercury in them even the
[3023.28 - 3027.00] Mercury free ones that claim they're
[3024.72 - 3029.24] Mercury free they're not Mercury free I
[3027.00 - 3032.60] promise you they're not Mercury free you
[3029.24 - 3034.68] want the plant-based omega-3 oils check
[3032.60 - 3036.72] out my information in fish oil and my
[3034.68 - 3037.56] books and all that okay you know learn
[3036.72 - 3041.72] from
[3037.56 - 3044.40] that and um so that's another great
[3041.72 - 3045.76] thing too so all these vitamins these
[3044.40 - 3048.08] minerals that I'm talking about these
[3045.76 - 3051.28] nutrients and these herbs help
[3048.08 - 3054.32] peppermint is a powerful liver res
[3051.28 - 3058.72] restorative peppermint peppermint tees
[3054.32 - 3061.60] do lots of herbal pepper mes oregano oil
[3058.72 - 3063.76] which kills bacteria and viruses does
[3061.60 - 3066.44] really good though for the liver because
[3063.76 - 3069.48] it lowers the viral and bacterial load
[3066.44 - 3072.64] in the liver that that bogs down the
[3069.48 - 3076.16] liver olive leaf lowers the bacterial
[3072.64 - 3078.60] and and and um viral level in the liver
[3076.16 - 3080.32] so those are good too and then like I
[3078.60 - 3081.88] said the Melissa the lemon bomb that's
[3080.32 - 3084.28] amazing for a whole bunch of different
[3081.88 - 3088.20] reasons as well um so we're coming we're
[3084.28 - 3091.28] coming to the end of this so the liver
[3088.20 - 3093.68] is responsible for so much and it's not
[3091.28 - 3095.32] a liver show but it's responsible for so
[3093.68 - 3097.56] much with hair skin and Nails the
[3095.32 - 3099.84] adrenals are responsible for with hair
[3097.56 - 3102.04] skin and nails when we get sick and our
[3099.84 - 3103.72] immune systems break down and epine bars
[3102.04 - 3106.40] and all kinds of other viruses and and
[3103.72 - 3108.56] bacteria also proliferate and they grow
[3106.40 - 3111.48] and they they start to consume us in a
[3108.56 - 3113.56] way they release a lot of toxins and a
[3111.48 - 3115.04] lot of neurotoxins the body has to use
[3113.56 - 3116.12] all its reserves and vitamins and
[3115.04 - 3119.00] minerals
[3116.12 - 3121.76] to to to to clean that up and and fight
[3119.00 - 3123.64] for us so all these things do matter but
[3121.76 - 3125.24] remember the foods if you can't do
[3123.64 - 3126.80] supplements for some reason and you're
[3125.24 - 3129.04] somebody who's sensitive the foods
[3126.80 - 3131.36] matter with hair skin and Nails bring in
[3129.04 - 3133.24] more lettuces red leaf lettuce
[3131.36 - 3135.16] butterleaf lettuce for the Omega-3s
[3133.24 - 3138.28] butterleaf lettuce has all the Omega-3s
[3135.16 - 3140.12] in it bring that in every single day

[3140.12 - 3145.04] your celery juice for your liver do the
[3142.24 - 3147.72] Cucumber juices hydration is the other
[3145.04 - 3149.92] fact for the skin people go through life
