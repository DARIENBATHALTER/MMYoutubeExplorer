[0.24 - 4.80] body pain back pain
[2.64 - 6.32] you know the thing is with the back a
[4.80 - 8.16] lot of people have sciatica they've got
[6.32 - 10.24] the sciatic nerve pain
[8.16 - 12.48] they're in pain all the time they're
[10.24 - 14.56] walking around aching and everything and
[12.48 - 15.76] the problem is with backs
[14.56 - 16.96] is that
[15.76 - 18.80] it's not just about seeing a
[16.96 - 20.16] chiropractor which is fine you can see a
[18.80 - 22.24] chiropractor if somebody wants they can
[20.16 - 24.40] get massage if somebody wants
[22.24 - 26.56] they can get back surgery if somebody
[24.40 - 28.00] wants right not that they always want
[26.56 - 30.48] back surgery but a lot of people get
[28.00 - 33.36] pushed into it the key is
[30.48 - 35.52] why is it inflamed right is is it a
[33.36 - 37.44] degenerative disc issue
[35.52 - 38.80] right but here's the thing
[37.44 - 40.40] a lot of people walk around and their
[38.80 - 42.96] backs are shot
[40.40 - 45.52] they got bulging discs degenerative disc
[42.96 - 47.20] issues right spinal stenosis they get
[45.52 - 48.32] all these kinds of issues going on with
[47.20 - 50.32] their back
[48.32 - 51.76] but they're not in any pain whatsoever
[50.32 - 54.16] so they're not in any pain good to see
[51.76 - 56.32] you guys coming on here they walk around
[54.16 - 57.76] and they're fine and that's what's
[56.32 - 60.96] confusing
[57.76 - 63.12] probably to a lot of doctors out there
[60.96 - 64.40] and a lot of chiropractors and a lot of
[63.12 - 65.60] natural doctors holistic doctors
[64.40 - 66.96] functional medicine doctors where
[65.60 - 68.80] they're like why isn't something
[66.96 - 70.64] happening here if they ever take a look
[68.80 - 72.80] at somebody's lumbar somebody's lower
[70.64 - 74.96] spine and they're like well they've got
[72.80 - 76.80] a two bulging discs right and the
[74.96 - 79.28] person's not hurting
[76.80 - 81.92] and how does this happen
[79.28 - 84.96] one reason is it takes more than a
[81.92 - 86.56] pinched nerve to have pain and so many
[84.96 - 89.20] people have pain
[86.56 - 90.64] in their back right and that's just one
[89.20 - 92.48] area in their back they have pain in
[90.64 - 94.16] other places too good to see you guys
[92.48 - 96.64] coming on talking about back problems
[94.16 - 98.16] and body pain right specifically back
[96.64 - 99.68] problems for a lot of people sciatic
[98.16 - 101.04] acidic nerve pain
[99.68 - 102.48] so
[101.04 - 104.96] the thing is with nerve pain
[102.48 - 107.84] inflammation
[104.96 - 110.96] can take back problems to a whole other
[107.84 - 114.16] level so its inflammatory issues can
[110.96 - 115.36] take your back problem to a whole other
[114.16 - 117.68] place
[115.36 - 121.52] someone with a bulging disc if they're
[117.68 - 122.64] not inflamed they won't have a problem
[121.52 - 125.52] somebody
[122.64 - 127.36] with a bulging disc that's inflamed will
[125.52 - 129.36] have a problem and that's a big big
[127.36 - 131.04] thing so many people get they get into
[129.36 - 132.96] back surgery
[131.04 - 134.48] so they have back surgery done
[132.96 - 135.84] and it doesn't fix the problem and
[134.48 - 137.92] they're confused like this it was
[135.84 - 139.20] supposed to go away this was supposed to
[137.92 - 140.48] no i was not supposed to have this
[139.20 - 142.24] problem the doctor would be like well
[140.48 - 143.92] you know we did your back surgery you
[142.24 - 146.00] should be walking in three days you
[143.92 - 147.44] should be all better and there they are
[146.00 - 149.68] they're not better and they have these
[147.44 - 151.44] back problems and it goes on for like a
[149.68 - 153.28] year and two years and three years and
[151.44 - 155.12] four years and it just keeps on going on
[153.28 - 158.00] even after back surgery a lot of people
[155.12 - 160.48] get repeated back surgery too so why is
[158.00 - 162.48] this important because a lot of people
[160.48 - 166.48] without realizing it right
[162.48 - 169.52] have this nerve inflammation so the
[166.48 - 172.00] nerves are inflamed in their back
[169.52 - 173.68] and that's what they don't know so i
[172.00 - 175.92] want to bring this over for a second too
[173.68 - 175.92] okay
[176.56 - 179.36] good to see you guys coming on here
[177.76 - 181.92] we're talking about sciatic nerve pain
[179.36 - 183.84] or back pain a lot of people have it
[181.92 - 185.68] and you know a lot of people suffer from
[183.84 - 188.00] it and the whole bit and it's something
[185.68 - 189.76] that i don't talk about too often
[188.00 - 191.36] because there's so many other problems
[189.76 - 193.76] people have and so many other conditions
[191.36 - 195.44] like brain conditions and everything
[193.76 - 198.56] else right that we talk about but when
[195.44 - 200.40] it comes down to back problems and
[198.56 - 202.40] here if you're if you feel young if
[200.40 - 204.48] you're young and you feel indestructible
[202.40 - 206.88] you haven't had anything hit you yet you
[204.48 - 208.24] just get a massage once in a while right
[206.88 - 210.08] it's like who cares about your back and
[208.24 - 212.00] then you pull out your back in a sense
[210.08 - 214.08] like a back muscle if you work out too
[212.00 - 215.92] hard or something like that you know and
[214.08 - 217.36] then and a lot of people do that well
[215.92 - 219.84] they'll just they'll pull a muscle out
[217.36 - 222.40] i'm talking about when back problems
[219.84 - 224.64] become this chronic illness problem this
[222.40 - 226.56] chronic issue and that chronic issue
[224.64 - 228.88] just doesn't go away and it stays there
[226.56 - 230.96] forever and that's what we're we're on
[228.88 - 232.40] right now so
[230.96 - 235.36] it takes
[232.40 - 237.60] inflammation of that nerve to really
[235.36 - 240.16] make a back problem happen unless you
[237.60 - 242.40] get a fracture or you get a break or you
[240.16 - 244.80] got degenerative disease where the the
[242.40 - 246.88] disc just crumbles and falls apart
[244.80 - 248.40] completely falls apart and then now
[246.88 - 249.92] you've got pressure on all the nerves
[248.40 - 252.56] and that's a different situation but
[249.92 - 255.76] most people out there right
[252.56 - 258.56] they have nerve pain
[255.76 - 261.84] okay and that nerve pain isn't because
[258.56 - 264.64] of a bulging disc that nerve pain isn't
[261.84 - 266.24] because of something else and that's
[264.64 - 268.48] important to like degenerative disc
[266.24 - 270.24] problems there's people out there their
[268.48 - 272.64] backs are chewed up their backs are shot
[270.24 - 274.32] their their vertebrae is is damaged in
[272.64 - 275.76] so many ways but they're out there and
[274.32 - 277.36] they're living their life they're like
[275.76 - 279.04] doing this they're doing that they're
[277.36 - 280.64] taking walks they're running on
[279.04 - 282.56] treadmills they're living their life and
[280.64 - 285.44] their backs are shot
[282.56 - 287.04] but it's that one moment where
[285.44 - 288.72] all you need
[287.04 - 290.72] is that viral inflammation and the
[288.72 - 292.16] minute you get that viral inflammation
[290.72 - 294.56] you've got a lifetime of sciatica
[292.16 - 297.68] sciatic nerve pain got a lifetime of
[294.56 - 299.68] lower back problems and other places too
[297.68 - 302.08] can happen in other areas as well in the
[299.68 - 304.40] back okay we're live on facebook youtube

[361.44 - 364.48] your back's inflamed and i've seen this
[363.04 - 367.28] a lot of times when your back is
[364.48 - 370.16] inflamed because of inflammation caused
[367.28 - 372.88] by a pathogen
[370.16 - 374.24] everything changes everything changes
[372.88 - 376.80] that's when you got chronic back
[374.24 - 378.80] problems you can get massages once twice
[376.80 - 380.48] a week you keep your chiropractor
[378.80 - 382.80] adjustments right
[380.48 - 384.88] you can try all these devices and you're
[382.80 - 386.48] still dealing with sciatic nerve pains
[384.88 - 389.12] attica you're dealing with problems in
[386.48 - 390.96] the back problems in the lumbar so this
[389.12 - 393.12] is important right now so what i what i
[390.96 - 395.20] tell people friends and family
[393.12 - 397.76] that have a back problem
[395.20 - 400.00] okay they go to their doctor the doctor
[397.76 - 401.92] checks out their back right they're like
[400.00 - 404.40] well you got you've got a little bit of
[401.92 - 406.96] a bulge in one disc or you're a little
[404.40 - 408.72] degenerative at another disc right
[406.96 - 410.08] where everything looks fine we don't
[408.72 - 411.68] know why your back hurts and that's
[410.08 - 414.24] another thing too
[411.68 - 416.40] a lot of people everything checks fine
[414.24 - 418.32] checks out fine in their back
[416.40 - 419.92] everything checks out okay
[418.32 - 421.60] but they don't know why they're in pain
[419.92 - 423.28] they just don't know why their leg is
[421.60 - 425.12] numb they don't know why their foot
[423.28 - 426.32] hurts they don't know why they have pain
[425.12 - 427.92] in the calf
[426.32 - 429.84] they don't have any of that so that's
[427.92 - 432.56] important to know
[429.84 - 434.00] a lot of people
[432.56 - 436.56] a lot of people
[434.00 - 440.16] right will have pain in their knee
[436.56 - 442.32] they'll have pain in their ankle pain
[440.16 - 443.84] somewhere in their foot
[442.32 - 445.76] and they'll get a diagnosis of like
[443.84 - 448.40] plantar fasciitis they'll get some other
[445.76 - 450.16] type of diagnosis right but really
[448.40 - 452.48] what's happening the pain is coming from
[450.16 - 454.32] their lower back and that's where it's
[452.48 - 456.08] coming from so you can get pain in your
[454.32 - 458.72] legs you can get numbness you can get
[456.08 - 461.04] tingling in the legs you can get
[458.72 - 463.04] problems in the legs and feet which can
[461.04 - 465.60] lead to a different diagnosis meanwhile
[463.04 - 468.24] the problem is inflammation with the
[465.60 - 470.40] sciatic nerve in inflammation with the
[468.24 - 472.64] tibial nerve inflammation with the lower
[470.40 - 477.12] lumbar right the lumbar it could be
[472.64 - 479.76] inflammation in you know l5 l4 l3 l2 l1
[477.12 - 480.96] could be inflammation in all of those
[479.76 - 482.80] and that's people will deal with that's
[480.96 - 483.76] what they do they deal with this chronic
[482.80 - 486.40] problem
[483.76 - 488.08] any advice on degenerative discs so the
[486.40 - 490.84] whole thing is what i'm trying to say is
[488.08 - 494.08] that when you get your inflammation
[490.84 - 495.20] down something changes
[494.08 - 496.88] something changes i'm going to talk
[495.20 - 498.96] about degenerative discs and bone
[496.88 - 501.12] problems too with all that when you get
[498.96 - 503.92] your inflammation down
[501.12 - 506.64] i've seen even the worst backs
[503.92 - 508.48] recover and get better debbie evans says
[506.64 - 510.08] hello the celery juice took away my back
[508.48 - 511.84] pain that's incredible because the
[510.08 - 514.48] inflammation went down from the celery
[511.84 - 516.80] juice alone i have r.a
[514.48 - 519.04] and i used to have so many aching places
[516.80 - 521.36] in my body you're on facebook debbie
[519.04 - 523.44] evans amazing
[521.36 - 525.20] well that's what happens is like celery
[523.44 - 528.16] juice is one of the medical medium tools
[525.20 - 530.32] right and it has an ability to change
[528.16 - 532.64] people's lives even if they're just
[530.32 - 533.84] doing that a lot of people they may need
[532.64 - 535.44] more than that and there's a lot of
[533.84 - 537.36] medical medium tools but the celery
[535.44 - 538.96] juice is helping because it's knocking
[537.36 - 541.52] down
[538.96 - 543.60] viral inflammation so that's what it's
[541.52 - 545.60] doing it's knocking down viral
[543.60 - 547.76] inflammation now if celery juice doesn't
[545.60 - 549.84] do the trick for a lot of people then
[547.76 - 552.00] that's when a lot of other things have
[549.84 - 553.52] to be thought about like one is
[552.00 - 555.68] when you're dealing with back problems
[553.52 - 558.64] you're dealing with nerves right
[555.68 - 561.28] so that's when b12 is critical so that's
[558.64 - 563.28] a big piece of how we keep our nerves
[561.28 - 566.00] good it's through b12 that's another
[563.28 - 568.24] example right there okay magnesium is a
[566.00 - 570.00] good thing for for nerves and it's good
[568.24 - 572.08] thing for problems like that but guess
[570.00 - 576.24] what
[572.08 - 577.84] when it's viral inflammation
[576.24 - 579.60] then you're looking at things that are
[577.84 - 582.16] anti-viral right where you're looking at
[579.60 - 584.40] like lysine and you're looking at stuff
[582.16 - 586.00] like that these things make a difference
[584.40 - 588.64] p there's a lot of people with stubborn
[586.00 - 590.24] back problems they just don't go away
[588.64 - 591.92] and the stubborn back problems are
[590.24 - 593.28] because they're dealing with viral
[591.92 - 595.68] inflammation
[593.28 - 597.76] a pathogen so it's critical to have the
[595.68 - 600.96] right type of stuff the right kind of
[597.76 - 602.72] stuff right and so
[600.96 - 604.80] this is the vimergy stuff right here i'm
[602.72 - 606.88] not sponsored but this is the vimergy
[604.80 - 609.76] stuff that's the microc that's the
[606.88 - 611.92] lysine because when you're dealing with
[609.76 - 613.28] inflammation you're dealing with pain in
[611.92 - 616.16] the body
[613.28 - 618.64] and it's mysterious
[616.16 - 621.28] then there's something going on immune
[618.64 - 624.32] system problems along with pathogen
[621.28 - 626.40] issues along with viral issues and you
[624.32 - 628.64] know so we have to realize you got
[626.40 - 631.20] immune system is low
[628.64 - 633.60] uh pathogens are increasing so what's
[631.20 - 635.52] the number one pathogen that gets in the
[633.60 - 637.92] way when it comes to back problems the
[635.52 - 640.72] number one pathogen that gets in the way
[637.92 - 642.64] with the back problem you guys
[640.72 - 644.40] is the shingles virus
[642.64 - 645.60] that's the number one and you don't have
[644.40 - 647.12] to have
[645.60 - 649.76] shingles
[647.12 - 652.16] to have that back pain okay
[649.76 - 653.92] you don't have to see the shingles like
[652.16 - 656.40] you don't have to see the pustules of
[653.92 - 658.72] the shingles stripped across your chest
[656.40 - 661.12] you're stripped across your back or
[658.72 - 662.64] on your leg or on your butt or on your
[661.12 - 664.40] thigh you don't even need to see the
[662.64 - 667.60] shingles for it to cause problems the
[664.40 - 669.92] shingles virus sits in everybody and it
[667.60 - 672.24] can cause a problem one way or another
[669.92 - 674.64] as time goes on so what happens is we're
[672.24 - 676.48] living our life our immune system gets
[674.64 - 678.08] knocked down it gets knocked down by
[676.48 - 680.40] different things different problems that
[678.08 - 682.80] we're up against our immune system gets
[680.40 - 685.84] knocked down right
[682.80 - 688.72] like betrayal and hardship and loss can
[685.84 - 690.48] break down our immune system okay
[688.72 - 692.72] foods that aren't good for us can break
[690.48 - 693.60] down our immune system over time
[692.72 - 695.04] and
[693.60 - 697.60] these different things break down immune
[695.04 - 700.16] system and then viruses like the
[697.60 - 702.88] shingles can creep up and creep up but
[700.16 - 704.88] when that virus creeps up it loves a
[702.88 - 707.12] couple of different areas it loves the
[704.88 - 709.76] trigeminal nerve it loves to be up here
[707.12 - 711.76] in this area okay and it can cause
[709.76 - 714.08] things like bell's palsy it can cause
[711.76 - 715.92] things like trigeminal nerve pain that's
[714.08 - 716.72] one thing shingles and another thing it
[715.92 - 717.76] does
[716.72 - 720.56] it can
[717.76 - 722.96] actually more commonly too
[720.56 - 725.20] it gets into the nerves in the lower
[722.96 - 727.20] back so shingles can get into the nerves
[725.20 - 729.92] and lower back another thing too
[727.20 - 731.68] it's the big body pain causer for so
[729.92 - 733.28] many people of course you can mess up
[731.68 - 734.56] your back of course you can have pinched
[733.28 - 737.76] nerves of course you can have a
[734.56 - 740.48] vertebrae problem but guess what
[737.76 - 743.04] if a viral issue is combined with that
[740.48 - 744.96] vertebrae vertebrae problem if a viral
[743.04 - 745.84] issue is combined with that pinched
[744.96 - 747.68] nerve
[745.84 - 749.84] if a viral issue like shingles is
[747.68 - 752.08] combined with
[749.84 - 754.48] that inflame that sorry that sciatic
[752.08 - 757.12] nerve or tibial nerve when that virus is
[754.48 - 759.84] involved it takes it
[757.12 - 762.24] and it explodes it the impact is so much
[759.84 - 763.92] more so now you've got sciatic problems
[762.24 - 765.84] forever you've got problems with your
[763.92 - 767.92] back forever it's like not a good day my
[765.84 - 770.16] back's not doing good you know i'm gonna
[767.92 - 771.68] go see somebody else from my back and
[770.16 - 773.84] you have these problems that could be
[771.68 - 775.92] long-lasting so what happens is if
[773.84 - 777.60] someone has like neurological lyme or if
[775.92 - 780.32] they have something like multiple
[777.60 - 782.64] sclerosis or if they got lupus or they
[780.32 - 784.64] got fibromyalgia it usually comes with
[782.64 - 787.36] back pain too because you're dealing
[784.64 - 788.48] with pathogens and when those pathogens
[787.36 - 791.52] are up
[788.48 - 793.68] they tend to cling onto nerves and the
[791.52 - 796.32] lumbar is a place where the shingles
[793.68 - 798.24] likes to cling on to that's a big area
[796.32 - 800.96] that the shingles likes to cling on to
[798.24 - 803.44] likes to cling onto the lumbar so one of
[800.96 - 805.76] the things that i tell my family
[803.44 - 808.80] and i teach doctors is you got to get
[805.76 - 810.32] the immune system strong right you got
[808.80 - 812.32] to get the immune system strong there's
[810.32 - 814.72] some olive leaf right
[812.32 - 816.96] licorice is another thing
[814.72 - 818.56] these are antiviral you know you got the
[816.96 - 820.16] licorice you got the
[818.56 - 822.88] got the olive leaf you got the cat's
[820.16 - 824.64] claw okay that's one way of doing it you
[822.88 - 826.24] can be somebody where you just do celery
[824.64 - 827.92] juice and you start with celery juice
[826.24 - 830.56] and that's what you use and celery's
[827.92 - 833.84] used as anti-pathogenic so what soda
[830.56 - 835.04] just does is it reduces pathogen levels
[833.84 - 836.72] in the body
[835.04 - 837.92] that's what celery juice does so that's
[836.72 - 839.60] why a lot of people are like i'm
[837.92 - 840.96] drinking celery juice
[839.60 - 842.24] like debbie said i'm drinking celery
[840.96 - 844.00] juice for a certain amount of time and
[842.24 - 845.68] all of a sudden now things are getting
[844.00 - 847.28] better my back pain is getting better my
[845.68 - 848.48] problems are getting better but there's
[847.28 - 851.28] a lot of people
[848.48 - 853.20] they're really viral they have a lot of
[851.28 - 854.96] viral inflammation they'll have two or
[853.20 - 856.80] three epstein bars they'll have a
[854.96 - 859.04] shingles they'll have two shingles
[856.80 - 862.72] viruses and don't even know it
[859.04 - 865.20] and they get into that lower back that's
[862.72 - 867.52] what they do and especially the shingles
[865.20 - 869.60] virus the problem there is then we have
[867.52 - 872.00] pew dental nerve problems where we have
[869.60 - 874.56] bladder problems and we have nerve pain
[872.00 - 876.96] in our groin and nerve pain pain in our
[874.56 - 879.20] lower abdomen and nerve pain in our
[876.96 - 881.04] pudendal nerve down there in the bladder
[879.20 - 882.00] and that will happen too
[881.04 - 884.08] and
[882.00 - 886.40] the shingles virus tends to cause all of
[884.08 - 888.56] this while it's also clinging on to the
[886.40 - 891.04] lumbar nerves and clinging on to getting
[888.56 - 892.80] in between the vertebrae and inflaming a
[891.04 - 896.24] nerve and here's one of the reasons why
[892.80 - 897.36] it does that if a nerve does get pinched
[896.24 - 898.96] right
[897.36 - 901.60] root hairs
[898.96 - 903.60] fray off of that nerve and when root
[901.60 - 905.92] hairs fray off of that nerve
[903.60 - 908.40] a signal happens inside the body it's
[905.92 - 910.24] like a homing signal for a pathogen and
[908.40 - 911.60] that's when the shingles virus will go
[910.24 - 912.56] looking for
[911.60 - 914.48] and i've talked about this in the
[912.56 - 917.12] medical media books it'll go looking for
[914.48 - 918.56] that damaged nerve that injured nerve
[917.12 - 920.48] and that's what it does
[918.56 - 922.16] so you'll end up with
[920.48 - 923.68] you guys if you just came on here and
[922.16 - 925.84] talked about sciatic nerve pain body
[923.68 - 928.08] pain joint pain we're just talking about
[925.84 - 929.52] back problems this is an important lie
[928.08 - 931.44] for anybody who's struggling with back
[929.52 - 933.36] issues and stuff like that it's really
[931.44 - 935.36] good information um
[933.36 - 938.40] which can be really helpful
[935.36 - 940.88] so as nerve hairs get frayed you guys
[938.40 - 943.84] nerves like the sciatic nerve or typical
[940.88 - 946.16] nerve or any of these nerves coming off
[943.84 - 948.72] the spine when they get frayed
[946.16 - 949.68] because these root hairs come off the
[948.72 - 951.20] nerve
[949.68 - 953.20] kind of like yarn i don't know if you
[951.20 - 955.12] guys ever seen a strip strip of yarn
[953.20 - 957.36] where you got all these little hairs on
[955.12 - 959.84] that yarn all popping up all over the
[957.36 - 961.20] place well guess what when that happens
[959.84 - 962.16] and it happens to a lot of people's
[961.20 - 964.96] nerves
[962.16 - 967.12] viruses like the shingles look for that
[964.96 - 969.44] and that virus goes and it clings on to
[967.12 - 970.80] the nerve is what it does when it clings
[969.44 - 972.88] onto the nerve
[970.80 - 974.80] the nerve swells
[972.88 - 976.80] so now the nerve swells so now
[974.80 - 978.72] somebody's sciatic level sciatic pain
[976.80 - 980.40] level is even more and now somebody's
[978.72 - 982.64] static nerve pains even more and that
[980.40 - 984.48] leads us into this vicious cycle
[982.64 - 986.08] the more pain we're in with our lower
[984.48 - 987.52] back the more chances we're going to
[986.08 - 988.96] jolt it or hurt it and that's what
[987.52 - 990.00] happens people walk around they hurt
[988.96 - 991.84] their back
[990.00 - 993.76] you know other things happen marla says
[991.84 - 996.08] totally i've had back issues seeing a
[993.76 - 998.08] cairo for years amazing now following
[996.08 - 1000.16] medical medium protocols i'm finally
[998.08 - 1001.60] healing oh that's incredible doing the
[1000.16 - 1003.20] medical media protocols for the back
[1001.60 - 1004.48] issues the chiropractor says it's like
[1003.20 - 1008.00] adjusting
[1004.48 - 1010.08] a different body that's amazing marla
[1008.00 - 1012.24] you know that's that's amazing so i see
[1010.08 - 1014.24] a question on tick tock says how do you
[1012.24 - 1015.76] get the shingles so
[1014.24 - 1017.28] here's the thing with shingles shingles
[1015.76 - 1019.60] is easy to get you can catch the
[1017.28 - 1021.20] shingles in just a public restroom just
[1019.60 - 1023.84] off the toilet seat
[1021.20 - 1025.84] very easy just off the toilet seat i
[1023.84 - 1027.20] often talk about
[1025.84 - 1029.36] how you got to look out when you're
[1027.20 - 1031.68] going to bathroom in a public restroom
[1029.36 - 1034.40] you got to flush the toilet first
[1031.68 - 1036.96] before you sit down to eliminate because
[1034.40 - 1040.00] when you sit down to eliminate as you're
[1036.96 - 1042.48] dropping that torpedo into the toilet
[1040.00 - 1044.72] yeah talked about this so many times a
[1042.48 - 1046.48] splash can happen and that splash has
[1044.72 - 1048.16] other things in the toilet bowl i've
[1046.48 - 1049.68] talked about all these different
[1048.16 - 1051.20] pathogens in there and you can have
[1049.68 - 1052.88] shingles could be just floating on top
[1051.20 - 1055.20] of the water and it just splashes back
[1052.88 - 1056.80] up could be on toilet seats restaurants
[1055.20 - 1058.64] eating out restaurants is probably one
[1056.80 - 1059.84] of the biggest ways to actually catch
[1058.64 - 1061.60] the shingles
[1059.84 - 1064.40] um there's there's so much shingle
[1061.60 - 1066.00] contamination just in that in that alone
[1064.40 - 1068.00] so yeah so what happens if people don't
[1066.00 - 1070.40] realize that we we would we in
[1068.00 - 1072.08] restaurants were eating off of forks the
[1070.40 - 1073.76] forks weren't sterilized there's a lot
[1072.08 - 1074.96] of stuff i've talked about about that
[1073.76 - 1077.20] with the forks
[1074.96 - 1079.12] where forks aren't sterilized so when
[1077.20 - 1080.56] you go to a dentist
[1079.12 - 1082.40] and the dentist sticks a drill in your
[1080.56 - 1083.84] mouth or sticks a probe like the metal
[1082.40 - 1085.20] probe have any of you guys what been to
[1083.84 - 1086.40] a dentist where the dentist takes a
[1085.20 - 1087.92] metal probe
[1086.40 - 1090.24] and they're poking around and they're
[1087.92 - 1091.20] they're jamming it into your teeth right
[1090.24 - 1092.00] okay
[1091.20 - 1094.08] well
[1092.00 - 1095.92] that's that's basically you go to a
[1094.08 - 1098.56] restaurant and they're not sticking that
[1095.92 - 1100.72] in a you know like a um you know a
[1098.56 - 1102.48] sanitizer they're not doing that they
[1100.72 - 1104.80] put those tools in these little and
[1102.48 - 1106.56] these little bug killer machines right
[1104.80 - 1108.48] that's what they do or they they open up
[1106.56 - 1110.40] brand new tools for people they just
[1108.48 - 1112.08] open them up and they poke in their
[1110.40 - 1113.76] mouth to the brand new tool that's never
[1112.08 - 1115.84] touched another person's mouth when you
[1113.76 - 1118.24] go into a restaurant they don't take the
[1115.84 - 1120.08] forks and the spoons and they don't put
[1118.24 - 1121.76] it into like
[1120.08 - 1124.24] literally like a ten thousand dollar
[1121.76 - 1125.76] unit to actually kill everything on them
[1124.24 - 1127.92] instead they just run through a crappy
[1125.76 - 1129.52] dishwasher if you're lucky they do that
[1127.92 - 1131.12] in the restaurants busy restaurants if
[1129.52 - 1133.36] you're lucky you can do that now you got
[1131.12 - 1135.52] a fork that's been in 20 people's mouth
[1133.36 - 1137.36] that mounts that day you know 10
[1135.52 - 1139.68] people's mouths a day or that week or
[1137.36 - 1141.12] whatever and then you're using that fork
[1139.68 - 1142.48] and you're jamming it in your gums and
[1141.12 - 1144.88] you're hitting your tongue with it and
[1142.48 - 1147.44] that's how we get the shingles
[1144.88 - 1149.28] that's one reason right there so that so
[1147.44 - 1151.60] this information is could be helpful for
[1149.28 - 1153.52] you guys like i'm not eating out anymore
[1151.60 - 1154.96] relationships is another way to get
[1153.52 - 1157.36] shingles
[1154.96 - 1159.20] it's it's relationships is how everybody
[1157.36 - 1160.64] transfer bugs that's how everybody's
[1159.20 - 1162.00] transferring bugs they're transferring
[1160.64 - 1163.76] the upsy bar they're transferring the
[1162.00 - 1165.52] shingles or transferring these bugs back
[1163.76 - 1168.00] and forth and in relationships that's
[1165.52 - 1170.08] another big way it's done all the time
[1168.00 - 1172.00] so people just all everybody has at
[1170.08 - 1173.36] least one variety of shingles in them
[1172.00 - 1175.68] and eventually they'll have like a
[1173.36 - 1177.44] sciatic nerve pain problem and here's
[1175.68 - 1179.52] how it works
[1177.44 - 1181.76] someone if their shingles hasn't come
[1179.52 - 1184.24] out of dormancy
[1181.76 - 1185.92] they can have some damaged back
[1184.24 - 1188.56] right damaged vertebrae they could have
[1185.92 - 1190.32] pinched nerves but they're not in pain
[1188.56 - 1191.52] a lot of people walk around they're not
[1190.32 - 1193.20] in pain
[1191.52 - 1195.20] they have like you know bulging discs
[1193.20 - 1197.20] they have problems with with their back
[1195.20 - 1198.96] and they're not in pain but then you get
[1197.20 - 1200.64] somebody right
[1198.96 - 1202.40] who has hardly anything wrong with their
[1200.64 - 1204.16] back or nothing wrong with their back at
[1202.40 - 1206.40] all that can be seen with the eye
[1204.16 - 1208.32] through x-rays or anything else or
[1206.40 - 1209.76] through an mri or an x-ray or anything
[1208.32 - 1211.92] at the chiropractor's office and they
[1209.76 - 1214.08] can't even see there's nothing there and
[1211.92 - 1215.52] then they still have all this mysterious
[1214.08 - 1217.60] back pain
[1215.52 - 1219.20] right all that mysterious back pain
[1217.60 - 1221.84] that's because the shingles virus can
[1219.20 - 1224.56] cause this even if you don't have
[1221.84 - 1226.80] a back injury or or a sciatic nerve
[1224.56 - 1229.20] that's being compressed or any kind of
[1226.80 - 1231.12] nerve that's being pinched or any nerves
[1229.20 - 1232.96] off the lumbar that's being pinched
[1231.12 - 1234.48] right the whole bit so all that's
[1232.96 - 1236.88] important to know
[1234.48 - 1238.88] what i do is what i tell doctors all the
[1236.88 - 1240.64] time is if you want to get back problems
[1238.88 - 1243.04] better the first thing you got to do
[1240.64 - 1244.48] instead of jumping into surgery and back
[1243.04 - 1246.08] surgery because a lot of people jump
[1244.48 - 1247.36] into back surgery
[1246.08 - 1249.68] and then as they come out of back
[1247.36 - 1251.60] surgery man it's not getting better and
[1249.68 - 1253.60] now what the heck they're on painkillers
[1251.60 - 1255.52] now they're on opioids now they're on a
[1253.60 - 1257.28] lot of painkillers and now they're
[1255.52 - 1258.64] addicted to painkillers and they still
[1257.28 - 1261.28] have the back problem and it's
[1258.64 - 1263.12] post-surgery and they're suffering right
[1261.28 - 1264.72] and i tell doctors
[1263.12 - 1266.64] whenever doctors reach out and doctors
[1264.72 - 1268.32] have known for years i tell them what
[1266.64 - 1270.80] you have to do is you have to make sure
[1268.32 - 1272.56] you try to get that inflammation down
[1270.80 - 1274.88] first that's a big thing it's getting
[1272.56 - 1277.60] that inflammation down
[1274.88 - 1279.44] first if you're even going to do a back
[1277.60 - 1281.76] surgery you have to work on getting
[1279.44 - 1283.12] inflammation down first unless it's a
[1281.76 - 1284.96] crisis
[1283.12 - 1286.72] where there's just such a crisis in the
[1284.96 - 1288.32] back because of a severe injury or
[1286.72 - 1290.64] something that just happened you know
[1288.32 - 1292.40] sometimes people can't avoid that but
[1290.64 - 1294.24] overall
[1292.40 - 1297.12] it's really important to know that
[1294.24 - 1299.68] there's measure there's you can take
[1297.12 - 1301.92] you can take precautions in so many ways
[1299.68 - 1304.08] and avoid back surgeries i've had so
[1301.92 - 1305.44] many people avoid back surgeries so a
[1304.08 - 1308.64] couple of things let's talk about a
[1305.44 - 1310.88] couple of tips to do okay first of all
[1308.64 - 1312.48] if you're somebody that's really acidic
[1310.88 - 1314.16] and really toxic you're doing your
[1312.48 - 1315.60] caffeine right you guys on tick-tock
[1314.16 - 1317.28] you're doing your caffeine products i
[1315.60 - 1318.64] know you guys on tick-tock
[1317.28 - 1320.56] i know a lot of you guys are jacked up
[1318.64 - 1322.56] on caffeine and there's no judge i'm not
[1320.56 - 1323.92] judging anyone here same thing with you
[1322.56 - 1325.28] guys and
[1323.92 - 1327.60] and you know in other places too on
[1325.28 - 1329.20] facebook wherever else it's i get it
[1327.60 - 1330.88] everybody's on caffeine all that but
[1329.20 - 1333.92] caffeine
[1330.88 - 1336.88] really makes an acidic body and the more
[1333.92 - 1339.36] acidic we are the more room we're gonna
[1336.88 - 1340.96] have for eventually pathogen issues
[1339.36 - 1343.04] another thing is dairy products a lot of
[1340.96 - 1345.60] people are doing a lot of dairy products
[1343.04 - 1348.32] okay that's another thing that could
[1345.60 - 1351.20] make our body right environment really
[1348.32 - 1352.64] acidic okay vinegar that's another one
[1351.20 - 1354.00] right there too i know everybody's on
[1352.64 - 1355.68] vinegar every other day it's in
[1354.00 - 1357.52] condiments it's in your refrigerator
[1355.68 - 1359.76] these you know everybody's mainlining
[1357.52 - 1361.36] all that vinegar right so
[1359.76 - 1363.68] and what we're doing is when we're doing
[1361.36 - 1365.92] all that
[1363.68 - 1368.40] we're starting to lose all our calcium
[1365.92 - 1369.92] so we're weakening all of our bones so
[1368.40 - 1371.76] we've got to remember that that's one
[1369.92 - 1374.24] thing right there so in order to
[1371.76 - 1375.44] preserve your lumbar preserve your
[1374.24 - 1378.00] vertebrae
[1375.44 - 1379.28] preserve your spine and your bones and
[1378.00 - 1381.44] your skull
[1379.28 - 1383.60] is to get that acidity under control so
[1381.44 - 1386.08] you're not using
[1383.60 - 1387.60] your calcium to neutralize all the other
[1386.08 - 1388.80] stuff you're doing like the dairy
[1387.60 - 1391.60] products and
[1388.80 - 1393.84] and and the caffeine and the vinegar so
[1391.60 - 1395.52] we have to keep that in mind right a lot
[1393.84 - 1398.08] of us are just really acidic and that
[1395.52 - 1401.12] doesn't help but the acidity can lower
[1398.08 - 1403.12] the immune system allowing pathogens to
[1401.12 - 1405.44] creep up like shingles and then when
[1403.12 - 1406.96] pathogens like shingles creeps up we
[1405.44 - 1408.96] inflame the nerves and then that
[1406.96 - 1412.40] pathogen inflames all the different
[1408.96 - 1414.16] nerves and that's important to know and
[1412.40 - 1415.44] so we end up hurting ourselves we hurt
[1414.16 - 1416.64] our back
[1415.44 - 1418.88] and we got
[1416.64 - 1420.08] we got a real acidic environment in our
[1418.88 - 1422.40] body right
[1420.08 - 1424.72] we're totally acidic our immune system
[1422.40 - 1426.64] is already struggling a little bit and
[1424.72 - 1428.48] then all it takes is that and then boom
[1426.64 - 1430.56] the shingles virus comes out and when it
[1428.48 - 1432.64] comes out
[1430.56 - 1434.48] when it comes ripping out
[1432.64 - 1436.08] you don't need a rash you don't need
[1434.48 - 1437.92] pustules you don't have to have any
[1436.08 - 1440.00] punctuals you don't have any rashes you
[1437.92 - 1441.76] don't need any of that to have shingles
[1440.00 - 1443.68] the shingles virus
[1441.76 - 1446.08] does things on its own without
[1443.68 - 1449.92] showcasing that pustule or that rash and
[1446.08 - 1452.16] it goes into the lumbar into the nerves
[1449.92 - 1454.32] attaches itself to the sciatic nerve
[1452.16 - 1458.40] attaches itself to nerves coming off of
[1454.32 - 1461.52] l1 lt l3 l4 l5 it attaches itself to
[1458.40 - 1463.92] those lumbar nerves coming out okay
[1461.52 - 1466.56] out of the spine and it attacks it it
[1463.92 - 1468.64] attaches itself to the tibial nerves
[1466.56 - 1471.44] and attach itself to the pudendal nerve
[1468.64 - 1472.72] in the front so a lot of people okay a
[1471.44 - 1474.56] lot of people
[1472.72 - 1475.36] right in the front the pudendal nerve
[1474.56 - 1477.12] okay
[1475.36 - 1478.80] that shingles virus will attach into the
[1477.12 - 1480.48] pudendal nerve and then they have the
[1478.80 - 1483.04] overactive bladder then they have the
[1480.48 - 1484.96] bladder pain then they have the bladder
[1483.04 - 1487.20] problems then they have all that weird
[1484.96 - 1489.28] the terrible itching in their lower
[1487.20 - 1491.92] abdomen that they can't like get any
[1489.28 - 1493.92] kind of just you know any kind of relief
[1491.92 - 1495.60] from all these problems can happen from
[1493.92 - 1497.12] the shingles virus getting into the
[1495.60 - 1498.64] lower part of the body so i guess the
[1497.12 - 1500.08] bottom line is one of the things i'm
[1498.64 - 1502.16] trying to tell you guys is the shingles
[1500.08 - 1504.64] virus can get into the lower part of our
[1502.16 - 1507.36] body and wreak a lot of havoc
[1504.64 - 1509.20] and what it does it gets into the spine
[1507.36 - 1511.84] the lower spine and that's where it
[1509.20 - 1514.16] causes a lot of turmoil the shingles
[1511.84 - 1515.60] virus there so some of the basic steps
[1514.16 - 1518.40] and i tell doctors to tell their
[1515.60 - 1520.40] patients is celery juice is a great
[1518.40 - 1522.80] place to start there's no question if
[1520.40 - 1524.56] you're doing 16 ounces a day empty
[1522.80 - 1526.08] stomach every single morning don't add
[1524.56 - 1527.76] anything to it that right there is
[1526.08 - 1529.92] something you can start with because
[1527.76 - 1533.04] that at least starts to bring the
[1529.92 - 1536.40] inflammation down by getting toxins and
[1533.04 - 1538.16] poisons that the viruses create to flush
[1536.40 - 1539.68] out of the body okay
[1538.16 - 1540.88] here's where back problems get really
[1539.68 - 1541.76] bad
[1540.88 - 1544.16] right
[1541.76 - 1545.52] you got the shingles virus your nerves
[1544.16 - 1547.52] are inflamed
[1545.52 - 1549.84] your sciatic nerves are inflamed your
[1547.52 - 1551.04] lumbar is inflamed okay
[1549.84 - 1553.20] and then
[1551.04 - 1555.52] you also have an epstein bar
[1553.20 - 1557.84] right at the same time that's out
[1555.52 - 1560.08] a lot of people they struggle because
[1557.84 - 1562.56] they'll have the fibromyalgia diagnosis
[1560.08 - 1564.48] with the neurological dia lyme diagnosis
[1562.56 - 1566.72] with the back problem diagnosis from the
[1564.48 - 1568.48] chiropractor with some other diagnosis
[1566.72 - 1571.20] and they'll be into like four or five
[1568.48 - 1573.04] diagnoses they'll have the epstein bars
[1571.20 - 1575.68] with the shingles they'll have an
[1573.04 - 1577.52] inflamed back and body pain everywhere
[1575.68 - 1579.92] so it's confusing so let's go into that
[1577.52 - 1581.68] now a lot of people will have two
[1579.92 - 1583.68] viruses
[1581.68 - 1585.84] they'll have the shingles causing
[1583.68 - 1587.84] sciatic pain and body pain and joint
[1585.84 - 1590.08] pain in the back and in the hips and
[1587.84 - 1592.80] then they'll have the epstein bar
[1590.08 - 1596.40] causing nerve pain everywhere shoulders
[1592.80 - 1598.96] arms hands in other places in the body
[1596.40 - 1600.48] neck right they'll have the epstein bar
[1598.96 - 1602.64] with this shingle so they'll have a
[1600.48 - 1604.64] combination of both and people walk
[1602.64 - 1607.52] around with all these low-grade viral
[1604.64 - 1609.44] infections and they're highly inflamed
[1607.52 - 1612.16] and they don't know what they can do
[1609.44 - 1614.16] about it one of the things i recommend i
[1612.16 - 1616.40] recommend any family members i tell
[1614.16 - 1618.48] doctors is too is to make sure you're
[1616.40 - 1620.08] doing the cold packs on the lower spine
[1618.48 - 1622.00] when you've got sciatic nerve pain make
[1620.08 - 1624.08] sure you're doing that every day you can
[1622.00 - 1625.52] do some heat on it in the morning that's
[1624.08 - 1628.56] something you can offer heat on it in
[1625.52 - 1630.48] the morning is fine right cold packs too
[1628.56 - 1632.40] you know on your lower back that's a
[1630.48 - 1635.20] great thing you do
[1632.40 - 1637.52] right and movement's important too
[1635.20 - 1639.36] okay so movement is important michelle l
[1637.52 - 1640.88] says shingles has caused so much pain it
[1639.36 - 1641.84] causes a lot of pain with a lot of
[1640.88 - 1643.84] people
[1641.84 - 1646.00] movement's good too but you got to take
[1643.84 - 1648.00] it slow movement really slow depending
[1646.00 - 1650.40] on how you're inflamed i've seen a lot
[1648.00 - 1653.36] of people get pushed into
[1650.40 - 1656.16] heavy exercise with their trainers while
[1653.36 - 1657.76] they're inflamed from viral inflammation
[1656.16 - 1660.00] they don't know about in their lower
[1657.76 - 1662.32] back and then it takes them to another
[1660.00 - 1664.48] level where now they're really hurting
[1662.32 - 1666.40] really bad and then up for then they're
[1664.48 - 1668.40] eligible for a back surgery which could
[1666.40 - 1670.40] be avoided which could have been avoided
[1668.40 - 1673.68] so anyway some of the other things do is
[1670.40 - 1675.84] is to take the viral load down it's like
[1673.68 - 1677.76] dropping down the inflammation and
[1675.84 - 1679.20] that's the next thing you can do and
[1677.76 - 1680.96] that's why i talk about in the medical
[1679.20 - 1682.40] medium book so
