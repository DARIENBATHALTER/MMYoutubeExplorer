[2.32 - 6.24] okay here we are we're live
[4.56 - 7.68] trying out a new system right now anyway
[6.24 - 9.76] tonight we're talking about
[7.68 - 11.04] supplements this is a really important
[9.76 - 12.56] live and i want to cover a lot of
[11.04 - 14.32] information as much as i can
[12.56 - 16.32] there's a lot of information out there
[14.32 - 17.84] about supplements first of all there's a
[16.32 - 19.92] lot of people out there that think they
[17.84 - 21.76] don't need any supplementation
[19.92 - 23.44] they don't need anything they can get
[21.76 - 24.96] everything from their food
[23.44 - 26.96] okay so that's that's what a lot of
[24.96 - 28.16] people believe they can just get it all
[26.96 - 30.56] from their food
[28.16 - 32.40] and you know and they're covered right
[30.56 - 34.32] and then you got people that believe
[32.40 - 36.32] they do need some supplements and that
[34.32 - 37.68] it may be a sound thing to do and it may
[36.32 - 38.80] be important to do
[37.68 - 40.80] glad to see you guys here in the
[38.80 - 42.16] comments coming up here um
[40.80 - 43.68] and you know there's there's people that
[42.16 - 44.96] will do that too well they'll be like
[43.68 - 46.24] you know what i kind of need some
[44.96 - 47.92] supplements and
[46.24 - 49.44] but there's a lot of people that you
[47.92 - 51.44] know like i said they believe they could
[49.44 - 55.52] get it all from their food and
[51.44 - 57.52] and can we get everything from our food
[55.52 - 59.04] can we get every chemical compound can
[57.52 - 61.20] we get every nutrient
[59.04 - 62.08] can we get all the things we need from
[61.20 - 64.24] just our
[62.08 - 66.08] food that's really important all on its
[64.24 - 68.00] own like that's an important critical
[66.08 - 71.12] thing to like think about
[68.00 - 72.80] if we can get everything
[71.12 - 75.12] from our food think about this you guys
[72.80 - 76.96] check this out okay if we can get
[75.12 - 79.92] everything from our food
[76.96 - 80.48] all right well then what about the food
[79.92 - 83.44] we eat
[80.48 - 85.20] all these years what about the food we
[83.44 - 86.72] ate 20 years ago what about the food we
[85.20 - 87.92] ate 10 years ago what about the food we
[86.72 - 89.36] ate five years ago
[87.92 - 90.96] what about the processed food we might
[89.36 - 94.08] have eaten what about the gras
[90.96 - 95.44] the greasy uh fast food we might have
[94.08 - 97.44] eaten right
[95.44 - 99.28] what about that all in its own think
[97.44 - 100.80] about that so
[99.28 - 102.40] you know there's a lot to really
[100.80 - 104.96] consider here
[102.40 - 107.04] and did we eat poor food in the mean
[104.96 - 110.32] like very poorly in the past
[107.04 - 112.00] so even if we're on the most amazing
[110.32 - 114.00] diet right now even if you think you're
[112.00 - 114.40] on this great balanced diet or you're on
[114.00 - 116.48] this
[114.40 - 118.00] in a food combining diet someone sold
[116.48 - 120.48] you into or you're on a
[118.00 - 121.52] you're on a intuitive eating diet which
[120.48 - 123.52] really you know
[121.52 - 125.20] isn't really much of anything in many
[123.52 - 126.48] ways and say you're on a paleo diet or
[125.20 - 128.64] say you're on a plant-based diet or
[126.48 - 131.36] whatever you're doing
[128.64 - 132.64] what was the last 20 years was it all
[131.36 - 134.56] organic
[132.64 - 136.72] were you eating have you been eating
[134.56 - 137.84] organic food since birth
[136.72 - 139.84] and i'm going to tell you something
[137.84 - 143.04] about even organic
[139.84 - 146.64] farms organic soil i mean the farm
[143.04 - 149.52] soil and organic farming is depleted
[146.64 - 150.72] so even farms that are growing organic
[149.52 - 153.92] food
[150.72 - 156.88] you know are are depleted of many
[153.92 - 158.08] trace minerals many nutrients and that's
[156.88 - 159.76] organic
[158.08 - 161.60] so if you if so say you're somebody who
[159.76 - 162.48] didn't eat didn't eat organic your whole
[161.60 - 164.48] life because how
[162.48 - 167.04] come on like who who's eating organic
[164.48 - 170.00] their whole life not a lot of people i'm
[167.04 - 170.88] not a lot of people and was there soil
[170.00 - 173.60] the most
[170.88 - 174.64] richest and nutritious you know it's you
[173.60 - 177.60] know like whatever
[174.64 - 179.68] but i mean i've known people that they
[177.60 - 182.80] grow their own food okay
[179.68 - 184.96] and their soil is so rich
[182.80 - 186.00] their compost that they use everything
[184.96 - 189.12] they do
[186.00 - 191.20] and trace minerals that they add through
[189.12 - 192.80] all kinds of different options right
[191.20 - 194.24] and they're using rock dust and they're
[192.80 - 195.20] using all these different options and
[194.24 - 198.24] it's soaked but
[195.20 - 199.92] but organic farming it doesn't really do
[198.24 - 202.32] that that's not how it's done
[199.92 - 204.24] so and then conventional farming really
[202.32 - 205.28] depleted conventional farming really
[204.24 - 206.80] depleted so
[205.28 - 208.88] here's the deal here's the question i
[206.80 - 210.80] want to ask you you know and no big deal
[208.88 - 213.36] it's just an interesting question
[210.80 - 214.80] um were you eating a lot of wild foods
[213.36 - 216.48] throughout your life if you're someone
[214.80 - 217.84] that believes you can get every single
[216.48 - 218.96] thing from your food and you don't need
[217.84 - 220.00] supplements and you don't need
[218.96 - 222.24] supplementation
[220.00 - 224.08] on any level and you think you can get

[334.96 - 339.60] i'm sure right well those pizza days
[337.60 - 341.36] means you weren't eating all wild foods
[339.60 - 342.88] and even if you weren't doing pizza that
[341.36 - 343.92] day you probably wouldn't be doing wild
[342.88 - 346.96] foods i'm not
[343.92 - 350.16] shaming anybody i'm not at all
[346.96 - 352.08] this is life this is normal like
[350.16 - 353.76] exactly you might be somebody that had
[352.08 - 355.20] pizza on and off your whole life but you
[353.76 - 357.28] can get everything you could get all the
[355.20 - 360.08] nutrition you want out of your food
[357.28 - 360.64] uh well okay that's interesting because
[360.08 - 362.16] man
[360.64 - 364.32] in order to get everything we need out
[362.16 - 367.12] of food man we got to be like
[364.32 - 367.92] on it we have to be like just wild foods
[367.12 - 370.24] the herbs
[367.92 - 371.28] the greens the leafy greens lots of
[370.24 - 374.16] fruit
[371.28 - 376.40] all organic oh my god and that's that's
[374.16 - 379.36] not something that's obtainable
[376.40 - 380.96] normally or something that's so easy or
[379.36 - 381.36] something we've done our whole life no
[380.96 - 383.84] so
[381.36 - 385.20] yes we need supplementation absolutely i
[383.84 - 386.88] mean
[385.20 - 388.24] i'm not one of those it's like you gotta
[386.88 - 389.76] have supplementation no
[388.24 - 391.36] if you feel good and you don't have any
[389.76 - 392.16] symptoms and you don't have a condition
[391.36 - 393.68] you guys
[392.16 - 395.28] and you're not battling something and
[393.68 - 397.36] you're not dealing with something

[414.72 - 417.84] tonight we're going to talk about
[416.48 - 419.60] powerful information because i'm going
[417.84 - 421.36] to read out a cleanse to heal
[419.60 - 423.68] i'm going to read out of here i'm going
[421.36 - 426.80] to read excerpts i'm going to talk about
[423.68 - 427.92] chapter 27 the supplements chapter and
[426.80 - 429.84] i'm going to go through there a little
[427.92 - 432.24] bit i'm going to answer questions too
[429.84 - 433.20] uh really important so we're going to
[432.24 - 435.44] talk about
[433.20 - 437.44] all of this and it's really interesting
[435.44 - 438.16] information if you really think about it
[437.44 - 439.84] because
[438.16 - 441.20] i run into people all the time and
[439.84 - 442.88] they're like i don't need
[441.20 - 444.96] any b12 and i don't need anything
[442.88 - 447.84] because i get everything from my food
[444.96 - 449.52] it's not really possible even though i
[447.84 - 450.96] want people to get as much as they can
[449.52 - 452.72] get out of foods but
[450.96 - 454.56] no one's going to keep up with the wild
[452.72 - 456.48] foods no one's going to keep on it with
[454.56 - 459.52] all that no one's going to do aloe vera
[456.48 - 461.20] every single day no one's going to do
[459.52 - 463.44] aloe every day
[461.20 - 465.36] you know it's not going to happen so you
[463.44 - 465.92] know and so supplementation is important
[465.36 - 467.52] and then
[465.92 - 469.04] if you're suffering with a symptom or a
[467.52 - 470.64] condition like
[469.04 - 472.96] the over 200 different symptoms and
[470.64 - 475.68] conditions plus more in here
[472.96 - 477.12] and you're suffering and then
[475.68 - 479.68] supplementation
[477.12 - 480.40] is an option to to go as far as you want
[479.68 - 481.60] to go
[480.40 - 483.76] you can start with the foods you can
[481.60 - 485.04] start with the cleanses and a lot of
[483.76 - 486.32] people they just get rid of their
[485.04 - 487.12] conditions with cleanses with the
[486.32 - 489.36] cleanses
[487.12 - 491.36] in in cleansing heal but you can go as
[489.36 - 493.12] far as you want to and you could really
[491.36 - 494.96] crank because that's the whole point
[493.12 - 496.56] and go as far as you need to go powerful
[494.96 - 498.08] information you won't hear anywhere else
[496.56 - 499.52] i'm going to talk about tonight like all
[498.08 - 501.28] medical medium information
[499.52 - 502.72] if you did hear a word or two about
[501.28 - 504.24] medical and medium information you're
[502.72 - 504.72] like oh no wait a minute i heard about
[504.24 - 508.08] metal
[504.72 - 510.16] somewhere else focus you know consider
[508.08 - 511.36] the details pay attention to the details
[510.16 - 513.36] the details matter
[511.36 - 515.20] because you'll know that that
[513.36 - 516.72] information isn't
[515.20 - 518.40] medical medium and you'll know that
[516.72 - 519.44] medical medium information has all the
[518.40 - 521.92] details like
[519.44 - 523.12] how toxic heavy metals oxidize in our
[521.92 - 524.72] brain and what
[523.12 - 526.24] symptoms and conditions they cause that
[524.72 - 527.60] never existed anywhere else so if you
[526.24 - 529.12] hear something about it now it
[527.60 - 530.32] originated from here
[529.12 - 533.12] most people in the medical medium
[530.32 - 534.00] community they started their journeys uh
[533.12 - 536.72] seeing specialists
[534.00 - 537.52] and doctors 10 doctors 15 doctors 20
[536.72 - 539.36] doctors
[537.52 - 540.96] i was known as the guy many years before
[539.36 - 542.88] the books were published as a guy people
[540.96 - 545.28] brought their bizarre symptoms to
[542.88 - 546.88] and they couldn't get answers during the
[545.28 - 547.68] course of sickness and they'd be seeing
[546.88 - 549.60] all these different
[547.68 - 551.12] doctors and everything and what happened
[549.60 - 553.12] is that you know over the years of the
[551.12 - 555.04] last 35 years i've worked with lots of
[553.12 - 556.88] doctors that wanted answers wanted to
[555.04 - 558.80] help troubleshooting cases
[556.88 - 560.80] whole reason why this community grew so
[558.80 - 562.24] big anyway throughout the years and
[560.80 - 564.96] millions of medical medium books have
[562.24 - 567.52] gone around the world and have sold
[564.96 - 569.28] like that one right there the reason why
[567.52 - 571.28] is because people got answers for the
[569.28 - 572.64] first time and that was important so
[571.28 - 574.16] people in the medical medium community
[572.64 - 575.60] they've been there they've done that
[574.16 - 577.12] a lot of people come here who haven't
[575.60 - 578.88] been there and done that yet they get
[577.12 - 579.44] here early and they start doing stuff
[578.88 - 580.96] and
[579.44 - 583.04] and they don't have that experience of
[580.96 - 584.64] going around for you know five years
[583.04 - 586.08] with symptoms and conditions and not
[584.64 - 587.20] having answers they don't have that
[586.08 - 588.96] experience yet
[587.20 - 591.12] but most people they've been there
[588.96 - 592.80] they've done that so it's been really
[591.12 - 595.12] kind of a great thing to offer the
[592.80 - 597.20] information so people can move forward
[595.12 - 598.56] and real compassionate doctors lots of
[597.20 - 599.92] them have the medical media books
[598.56 - 601.60] in their doctor's offices they're
[599.92 - 603.52] helping people every day with them it's
[601.60 - 605.44] really incredible thing that's happening

[682.88 - 686.40] guys out there now they
[684.32 - 688.00] they sell a book just so they can build
[686.40 - 690.96] their brand and then sell
[688.00 - 692.64] their supplementation and they put like
[690.96 - 694.48] a million to two million dollars a month
[692.64 - 696.64] in advertising you see their pop-up ads
[694.48 - 698.56] left and right all through social media

[698.56 - 701.68] dollars a year
[699.84 - 703.44] and and it's really just garbage
[701.68 - 704.64] supplements i see that all the time out

[763.28 - 767.20] read the book from here now for the
[765.28 - 770.48] first time this is a really cool system

[770.48 - 776.16] so that you guys can read it
[773.84 - 777.12] from the book i hope that's how it is on
[776.16 - 780.80] your side
[777.12 - 783.20] um all right so that's where i am
[780.80 - 785.04] in this section there's over 200
[783.20 - 788.40] symptoms and conditions
[785.04 - 791.60] with protocols now there's
[788.40 - 793.92] supplements and dosages what to do okay
[791.60 - 794.96] the book is designed to take you as far
[793.92 - 797.76] as you need to go
[794.96 - 798.80] so when you do the 369 cleanse you're
[797.76 - 800.24] healing
[798.80 - 802.00] one side of everything you're dealing
[800.24 - 802.48] with you can also work with supplements
[802.00 - 804.08] too
[802.48 - 805.20] on another side of it you can be
[804.08 - 806.16] somebody that's just doing the mono
[805.20 - 808.08] eating cleanse
[806.16 - 809.20] it's the 369 you could be doing the
[808.08 - 810.08] morning clench you could do the heavy
[809.20 - 811.76] metal detox
[810.08 - 813.52] cleanse you could do the anti-bug
[811.76 - 816.08] cleanse there's lots of cleanses in the
[813.52 - 817.04] book you do 369 original simplified and
[816.08 - 819.68] advanced
[817.04 - 821.20] the book is really designed for someone
[819.68 - 824.48] to customize
[821.20 - 826.08] their entire system
[824.48 - 828.48] and that's what's amazing there isn't
[826.08 - 830.96] just medical medium protocol
[828.48 - 832.88] and i tried it and it didn't work you
[830.96 - 834.48] know what you'll find out there
[832.88 - 836.16] someone would be like oh i tried medical
[834.48 - 838.80] medium it didn't work um oh
[836.16 - 840.40] that's interesting oh my god did you do
[838.80 - 843.52] the 369 advance
[840.40 - 845.36] three times in a row did you do um
[843.52 - 847.28] the mono eating cleanse did you try that
[845.36 - 848.32] for a month did you do the supplements
[847.28 - 850.96] and dosages
[848.32 - 852.56] did you do that always keep that in mind
[850.96 - 854.16] you know because what happens is the
[852.56 - 855.52] book is designed with thousands of
[854.16 - 857.84] protocols so
[855.52 - 858.96] if someone says i tried medical media it
[857.84 - 859.60] didn't work i tried fruits and
[858.96 - 861.04] vegetables
[859.60 - 862.64] that's pretty funny because there's
[861.04 - 864.16] thousands of customized protocols in
[862.64 - 866.56] medical medium books
[864.16 - 867.28] thousands so there's a reason for that
[866.56 - 869.36] there's
[867.28 - 870.64] over a thousand combinations in here so
[869.36 - 873.52] you can actually
[870.64 - 876.00] heal and move yourself forward there's a
[873.52 - 878.32] reason for that you can do
[876.00 - 879.12] three of the supplement recommendations
[878.32 - 881.92] you can do
[879.12 - 884.24] two of the cleanses you can customize it
[881.92 - 885.92] you can get yourself to a place
[884.24 - 887.52] and you can take it all the way that's
[885.92 - 890.16] how the book's designed
[887.52 - 891.44] so all these points are really important
[890.16 - 893.36] so let's get moving here a little bit
[891.44 - 895.36] i'm in chapter 27 what you need to know
[893.36 - 897.28] about supplements right here
[895.36 - 898.56] i get asked questions all the time just
[897.28 - 900.32] hundreds and hundreds of questions
[898.56 - 903.36] especially thousands of questions
[900.32 - 905.68] i mean it's ongoing okay like uh
[903.36 - 906.80] the questions come all different sizes
[905.68 - 909.20] and shapes like
[906.80 - 911.28] do i need supplements do i not how do i
[909.20 - 913.36] go about it where do i start
[911.28 - 914.32] i'm sensitive you know that's a question
[913.36 - 916.64] too you'll get like
[914.32 - 917.36] i'm sensitive what do i do how do i go
[916.64 - 919.12] about this
[917.36 - 920.96] so there's just there's there's so much
[919.12 - 923.36] of that and i completely understand
[920.96 - 924.88] the thing is is that if you actually
[923.36 - 926.80] read
[924.88 - 928.80] the book cleanse the heel first of all
[926.80 - 929.60] if i notice with all the different
[928.80 - 932.48] questions i get
[929.60 - 933.20] about supplementation or about cleansing
[932.48 - 935.60] or however
[933.20 - 937.44] i realize that the person a doesn't have
[935.60 - 939.60] the book or never got the book
[937.44 - 940.96] and that happens so if you're if you're
[939.60 - 943.36] one of those
[940.96 - 945.52] you you can get it first it's on sale 51
[943.36 - 946.96] off right now in amazon us i mean
[945.52 - 948.56] you can't go wrong with that or get it
[946.96 - 950.24] free at the library if you're
[948.56 - 952.00] and i noticed that i'll get a question
[950.24 - 953.92] like you know
[952.00 - 955.52] um i don't you know like what do i do
[953.92 - 956.32] for this what do i do for that condition
[955.52 - 958.16] well
[956.32 - 959.52] sounds like you didn't read this chapter
[958.16 - 960.80] what you need to know about supplements
[959.52 - 962.08] and then true cause of symptoms and
[960.80 - 963.36] conditions so it's either someone
[962.08 - 963.76] doesn't have the book or they never read
[963.36 - 965.28] it
[963.76 - 967.20] it's one or the other if they have it
[965.28 - 967.52] they haven't read it yet so let's cover
[967.20 - 969.36] this
[967.52 - 970.80] so what i want to do is i want to walk
[969.36 - 972.40] through some of the
[970.80 - 974.64] pieces of it now i won't be able to
[972.40 - 975.84] cover every single aspect the book has
[974.64 - 977.52] too much information
[975.84 - 979.12] it's never too much but tremendous
[977.52 - 982.16] amounts of information
[979.12 - 984.96] that walks you through so this this
[982.16 - 986.24] is your guide and that's what it is it's
[984.96 - 988.80] like me
[986.24 - 990.16] i i put the book together with spirit of
[988.80 - 993.36] compassion to make it like
[990.16 - 996.56] you got me there with you as far as like
[993.36 - 1000.00] taking that to that place so
[996.56 - 1001.68] i'm starting on page 472 right here and
[1000.00 - 1002.96] i'm just going to read a little bit some
[1001.68 - 1004.16] excerpts in between this and i'm going
[1002.96 - 1006.16] to help you like
[1004.16 - 1007.60] like guide you to through understanding
[1006.16 - 1008.40] some of this information right now and
[1007.60 - 1012.48] all that
[1008.40 - 1014.72] um so just the first line in here why is
[1012.48 - 1015.52] the world of nutraceuticals exploding
[1014.72 - 1017.92] and
[1015.52 - 1019.84] why is the whole thing with stuff why is
[1017.92 - 1021.44] supplementation nutraceuticals exploding
[1019.84 - 1023.04] that's because people are sick
[1021.44 - 1024.16] they're sick no one wants to take
[1023.04 - 1025.44] supplements who wants to take
[1024.16 - 1029.12] supplements who wants to take
[1025.44 - 1032.00] gobble gobbles of pills and gobbles of
[1029.12 - 1033.60] tablets and and liquids and all that
[1032.00 - 1035.60] kind of stuff and powders
[1033.60 - 1037.04] who wants to do that right you guys like
[1035.60 - 1038.40] you know who who wants to go that i'm
[1037.04 - 1039.52] glad you guys are all here i'm seeing
[1038.40 - 1043.20] your comments
[1039.52 - 1044.16] um um darcy said you're so kind to do
[1043.20 - 1046.00] these lives
[1044.16 - 1048.32] thank you i'm honored you feel that way
[1046.00 - 1050.64] truly bless your heart really you know
[1048.32 - 1052.88] you can't wait to start your 369 cleanse
[1050.64 - 1055.60] um jennifer said how do i
[1052.88 - 1056.40] how do i heal hashimoto's jennifer to
[1055.60 - 1058.08] begin with
[1056.40 - 1060.56] that's a really good question it's going
[1058.08 - 1061.76] to take us into here actually too
[1060.56 - 1063.60] if you've been diagnosed with
[1061.76 - 1066.56] hashimoto's thyroiditis
[1063.60 - 1069.36] okay first thing is to learn the cause
[1066.56 - 1071.84] learn the cause because the doctors
[1069.36 - 1073.28] have to tell patients what science
[1071.84 - 1074.80] research believes it is
[1073.28 - 1076.24] which is your body attacking itself
[1074.80 - 1076.96] which is your immune system tacking your
[1076.24 - 1078.56] own thyroid
[1076.96 - 1080.00] creates an autoantibody and attacks the
[1078.56 - 1081.36] thyroid that's not accurate
[1080.00 - 1082.80] because they've never proved it they've
[1081.36 - 1084.08] never showed it there's no study that
[1082.80 - 1086.00] can show it there's no
[1084.08 - 1088.16] there's no peer review study that shows
[1086.00 - 1090.16] it there's no technology developed yet
[1088.16 - 1092.96] to show the body attacking its
[1090.16 - 1093.68] its own gland so i talk about the true
[1092.96 - 1096.56] cause
[1093.68 - 1098.48] in cleanse to heal so the first thing is
[1096.56 - 1101.52] you get the book you go to the library
[1098.48 - 1102.72] and get the book for free okay and when
[1101.52 - 1104.64] you have the book
[1102.72 - 1107.20] go into the symptoms and conditions
[1104.64 - 1108.00] section all right and find out what the
[1107.20 - 1109.68] true cause
[1108.00 - 1111.28] was of what is hashimoto's why you have
[1109.68 - 1112.96] hashimoto's that's to begin with
[1111.28 - 1114.72] then you'll see supplementation and
[1112.96 - 1116.08] protocols there but i want you to read
[1114.72 - 1118.96] the chapter and everything before you
[1116.08 - 1121.76] even get there so i'm in chapter 27.
[1118.96 - 1124.32] so the reason why nutrition
[1121.76 - 1127.04] nutraceuticals are exploding you guys
[1124.32 - 1127.44] is because people are sick literally
[1127.04 - 1129.60] sick
[1127.44 - 1130.72] that's the reason why really important
[1129.60 - 1132.80] to know right there
[1130.72 - 1134.64] um and so because no one wants to just
[1132.80 - 1135.44] go and buy supplements purchase
[1134.64 - 1137.52] supplements
[1135.44 - 1139.04] spend all that money and that's one of
[1137.52 - 1140.24] the problems and here's a question i get
[1139.04 - 1142.16] all the time
[1140.24 - 1144.00] how do i do this what i'm going to end
[1142.16 - 1145.84] up spending all this money
[1144.00 - 1148.00] and out there because that's what people
[1145.84 - 1149.04] do i've had people come to my office for
[1148.00 - 1150.72] years for decades
[1149.04 - 1152.40] i spent ten thousand dollars in
[1150.72 - 1154.64] supplements just this month
[1152.40 - 1156.24] i spent all these supplements i bought
[1154.64 - 1158.40] out there in the world i went to this
[1156.24 - 1160.88] doctor that practitioner this healer
[1158.40 - 1162.72] and i got treasure troves of supplements
[1160.88 - 1163.28] in in my cabinets and then i would be
[1162.72 - 1165.20] like well
[1163.28 - 1166.72] does any of those practitioners or
[1165.20 - 1168.16] people know what the true cause of your
[1166.72 - 1169.28] condition was they're like no
[1168.16 - 1171.04] they don't know what's causing my
[1169.28 - 1172.48] fibromyalgia they don't know what's
[1171.04 - 1172.96] causing this and that because nobody
[1172.48 - 1174.88] knows
[1172.96 - 1177.04] right and so be like let's find out the
[1174.88 - 1178.72] true cause to what your fibromyalgia is
[1177.04 - 1180.64] i'm just giving that as one example
[1178.72 - 1182.00] and then let's look at your treasure
[1180.64 - 1182.80] trove of supplements that are in your
[1182.00 - 1184.64] cabinet
[1182.80 - 1186.48] and find out if any of them are for your
[1184.64 - 1188.08] fibro and then when you go into their
[1186.48 - 1189.44] cabinet i've seen this with so many
[1188.08 - 1190.16] clients over the years years and years
[1189.44 - 1192.00] ago they'd go
[1190.16 - 1193.36] i'd go in their cabinet with them and
[1192.00 - 1195.68] they would have
[1193.36 - 1196.88] thousands of dollars of supplements that
[1195.68 - 1198.40] were not going to help their
[1196.88 - 1200.16] fibromyalgia
[1198.40 - 1202.88] because the practitioners and the
[1200.16 - 1204.56] doctors did not know what the cause of
[1202.88 - 1207.04] the fibro was
[1204.56 - 1208.48] and so that's why the person wasn't
[1207.04 - 1209.04] getting better and that's why the person
[1208.48 - 1211.28] spent
[1209.04 - 1213.12] thousands of dollars the whole reason
[1211.28 - 1215.28] for medical medium information is why
[1213.12 - 1218.16] i explode like the medical media book
[1215.28 - 1219.36] one exploded when it did in 2014 15
[1218.16 - 1221.12] 2015.
[1219.36 - 1222.72] whole reason why we got here is because
[1221.12 - 1224.96] there were answers for conditions and
[1222.72 - 1228.48] then when you take a supplement
[1224.96 - 1230.96] for the answer you move forward
[1228.48 - 1232.64] and that's what happens with medical
[1230.96 - 1234.32] media information that's why it's so
[1232.64 - 1236.48] important so
[1234.32 - 1240.08] um so let's go into here a little bit
[1236.48 - 1240.08] more of all this
[1240.40 - 1242.80] let's see
[1244.00 - 1247.28] you know this is interesting here
[1245.24 - 1248.32] supplementation while cleansing it's an
[1247.28 - 1250.16] important question
[1248.32 - 1251.68] like do i take supplements while
[1250.16 - 1254.32] cleansing okay
[1251.68 - 1255.52] do i take supplements while cleansing
[1254.32 - 1257.68] it's an important question
[1255.52 - 1258.72] how do we integrate supplements with the
[1257.68 - 1260.56] cleanse
[1258.72 - 1262.16] we'll get a few keys let me give you a
[1260.56 - 1263.20] few key steps and reasons let's start
[1262.16 - 1264.96] with that right there say you're
[1263.20 - 1266.08] somebody doing the 369
[1264.96 - 1267.52] and you want to still take your
[1266.08 - 1269.36] supplements so say you still want to
[1267.52 - 1271.44] take your lemon balm right here
[1269.36 - 1272.88] so it's you know like that your lemon
[1271.44 - 1274.56] balm or say you still want to take your
[1272.88 - 1275.68] b12 or something like that i'm just
[1274.56 - 1277.28] saying so i'm going to show you some
[1275.68 - 1280.56] supplements in a little while too
[1277.28 - 1281.92] um just know that when you're cleansing
[1280.56 - 1282.96] you're lowering your fats
[1281.92 - 1284.56] when you're when you're doing medical
[1282.96 - 1285.92] medium cleanses okay because you're
[1284.56 - 1288.32] bringing your fats down
[1285.92 - 1289.20] when you bring your fats down your blood
[1288.32 - 1291.20] your blood
[1289.20 - 1292.96] doesn't have to deal with all that fat
[1291.20 - 1295.60] that's in the bloodstream
[1292.96 - 1297.04] and any supplement you ever take in your
[1295.60 - 1298.64] life doesn't matter what it is or
[1297.04 - 1300.32] whatever it is if there's anything good
[1298.64 - 1301.28] in that supplement like a nutrient of
[1300.32 - 1302.96] some kind
[1301.28 - 1304.80] no matter what supplement it is whether
[1302.96 - 1305.76] it's a vitamin or an herb or a nutrient
[1304.80 - 1308.80] of some kind
[1305.76 - 1309.68] anything you're taking can only do as
[1308.80 - 1312.16] good
[1309.68 - 1312.72] if it enters the cells so it actually
[1312.16 - 1315.28] enters
[1312.72 - 1317.04] our cells and so the reason one of the
[1315.28 - 1318.56] reasons why in the cleanse is too i mean
[1317.04 - 1320.72] the fats get lowered
[1318.56 - 1322.64] is because when you lower the fats you
[1320.72 - 1324.80] can get more nutrients into cells
[1322.64 - 1325.84] as well so that means that you won't
[1324.80 - 1328.96] have to do
[1325.84 - 1330.56] higher dosages on supplementation
[1328.96 - 1332.08] when you're doing cleanses because you
[1330.56 - 1334.96] got the glucose in there
[1332.08 - 1336.08] the glucose attaches itself the glucose
[1334.96 - 1339.04] of your bloodstream
[1336.08 - 1339.60] attaches itself to nutrients keep that
[1339.04 - 1341.60] in mind
[1339.60 - 1343.20] so the glucose you know in your
[1341.60 - 1345.92] bloodstream okay
[1343.20 - 1346.80] attaches to nutrients and drives it into
[1345.92 - 1349.12] cells
[1346.80 - 1350.24] always keep that in mind so when you're
[1349.12 - 1352.24] doing a
[1350.24 - 1354.00] three six nine cleanse minor weeding
[1352.24 - 1354.48] cleanse you're doing you know heavy
[1354.00 - 1357.12] metal
[1354.48 - 1358.80] detox smooth cleanse the medical medium
[1357.12 - 1360.80] heavy metal detox cleanse
[1358.80 - 1362.32] morning cleanse your supplements are
[1360.80 - 1364.00] going to be more effective
[1362.32 - 1365.44] more powerful and then when you use a
[1364.00 - 1367.28] high quality supplement like at
[1365.44 - 1367.92] medicalmedia.com i have the directory
[1367.28 - 1369.20] there
[1367.92 - 1370.72] and i have all the different supplement
[1369.20 - 1371.28] companies i like i'm friends with so
[1370.72 - 1373.04] many of the
[1371.28 - 1375.44] the supplement companies that are good
[1373.04 - 1378.40] because i like to know these people
[1375.44 - 1378.96] to some degree so that they don't like
[1378.40 - 1381.28] you know
[1378.96 - 1382.88] put something terrible in something and
[1381.28 - 1384.48] all of a sudden whatever but i don't own
[1382.88 - 1387.04] any of the companies on there
[1384.48 - 1388.00] the point is is that is that and i'm not
[1387.04 - 1390.32] sponsored by them
[1388.00 - 1392.08] but the point is with the supplements is
[1390.32 - 1393.92] that you don't have well you could
[1392.08 - 1395.28] cleanse and you can hold supplements off
[1393.92 - 1396.56] if you want why cleansing there's
[1395.28 - 1397.76] nothing wrong with that and if you want
[1396.56 - 1399.92] to take your supplements
[1397.76 - 1402.08] while cleansing they're going to be more
[1399.92 - 1403.76] potent so you can bring the dosages down
[1402.08 - 1405.68] too that's an important question i get
[1403.76 - 1406.64] asked all the time and
[1405.68 - 1408.80] the reason why you can bring your
[1406.64 - 1412.24] dosages down because you're taking fats
[1408.80 - 1415.68] out of your diet during those cleanses
[1412.24 - 1418.56] and so that means all those nutrients go
[1415.68 - 1421.04] right into cells much easier much faster
[1418.56 - 1422.96] that's no one knows this information
[1421.04 - 1424.80] this is medical medium information
[1422.96 - 1426.56] this is why medical media books medical
[1424.80 - 1428.40] medium cleanses and medical medium books
[1426.56 - 1429.92] and protocols get people better than
[1428.40 - 1430.88] most because when they take the right
[1429.92 - 1432.64] supplements
[1430.88 - 1434.00] for the right problem when they find out
[1432.64 - 1436.72] what the cause is
[1434.00 - 1438.40] and they actually also do the cleanse to
[1436.72 - 1440.16] lower down the fats
[1438.40 - 1441.76] what happens is all those powerful
[1440.16 - 1443.36] nutrients go into cells
[1441.76 - 1445.20] and they start coming out of their
[1443.36 - 1446.64] diseases conditions and symptoms and
[1445.20 - 1447.92] problems and all this other stuff
[1446.64 - 1449.36] and if they go to their doctor and they
[1447.92 - 1450.64] bring the information they get even
[1449.36 - 1451.60] extra help and all they get all this
[1450.64 - 1453.04] extra help so
[1451.60 - 1454.88] it's important to note that's one thing
[1453.04 - 1456.24] i want to cover right there so
[1454.88 - 1458.08] i'm going to go into supplements to
[1456.24 - 1460.32] avoid while cleansing so let's head in
[1458.08 - 1463.36] there right now
[1460.32 - 1465.20] so let's go into there and supplements
[1463.36 - 1467.36] to avoid while cleansing
[1465.20 - 1469.84] if you're on supplements that are not
[1467.36 - 1471.52] medical medium recommended
[1469.84 - 1473.44] that's when we can get in trouble so
[1471.52 - 1475.36] let's talk about that a little bit
[1473.44 - 1477.20] so i'm going to cleanse the heel right
[1475.36 - 1479.12] here i'm reading excerpts out of here
[1477.20 - 1480.56] we're talking about supplementation
[1479.12 - 1482.32] if you just got on here i'm going to cut
[1480.56 - 1484.32] open an aloe leaf and talk about how i
[1482.32 - 1486.56] eat the aloe in a couple of minutes
[1484.32 - 1487.92] we're going to cover that and we'll talk
[1486.56 - 1489.84] about some different supplements and so
[1487.92 - 1492.32] forth so reading out of cleanse to heal
[1489.84 - 1493.92] so supplements to avoid while cleansing
[1492.32 - 1495.52] you guys if you are on supplements that
[1493.92 - 1497.20] are not medical medium recommended that
[1495.52 - 1500.64] means medicalmedium.com
[1497.20 - 1502.88] on my directory you know for instance
[1500.64 - 1504.72] like you're on whey protein powder
[1502.88 - 1506.72] then you can be held back with your
[1504.72 - 1508.24] healing really important to know
[1506.72 - 1509.36] probably one of the most important
[1508.24 - 1511.36] questions out there because you'll see
[1509.36 - 1513.44] out there like what about collagen
[1511.36 - 1514.48] what about whey protein powder what
[1513.44 - 1516.16] about something else
[1514.48 - 1517.92] and what about nutritional yeast because
[1516.16 - 1519.28] people use that as a supplementation
[1517.92 - 1520.64] nutritional yeast will hold somebody
[1519.28 - 1521.52] back from healing when they're really
[1520.64 - 1524.48] sick
[1521.52 - 1525.28] um because you know because of msg and
[1524.48 - 1527.28] so when
[1525.28 - 1530.56] when we run into this stuff this is
[1527.28 - 1532.16] where it gets kind of dicey
[1530.56 - 1534.32] because a lot of people are on
[1532.16 - 1536.32] supplementation that feeds
[1534.32 - 1537.76] pathogens without them knowing it whey
[1536.32 - 1540.24] protein powder will feed
[1537.76 - 1541.52] an epstein bar a shingles virus a herpes
[1540.24 - 1543.92] simplex one
[1541.52 - 1545.20] cold sores okay people think cold sores
[1543.92 - 1546.32] are no big deal they just they're on
[1545.20 - 1547.68] their lip for a minute and then they go
[1546.32 - 1548.64] away and that's it no they they're
[1547.68 - 1550.00] actually
[1548.64 - 1551.68] actually a lot of neurotoxins are
[1550.00 - 1553.12] produced by them it gives people a lot
[1551.68 - 1553.92] of issues you can even get trigeminal
[1553.12 - 1555.44] neuralgia
[1553.92 - 1557.20] like peeking up a little even though
[1555.44 - 1560.16] shingles is the number one thing for
[1557.20 - 1561.68] trigeminal neuralgia but um and if
[1560.16 - 1564.40] you've heard nutritional yeast isn't
[1561.68 - 1566.40] good for you it originated here
[1564.40 - 1568.16] no one thought nutritional yeast was bad
[1566.40 - 1569.84] for you no one thought that was bad for
[1568.16 - 1571.36] the msg the glutamic
[1569.84 - 1572.56] acid that's naturally occurring in it
[1571.36 - 1574.08] it's not even just that's just one
[1572.56 - 1575.76] reason why it's not good there's a bunch
[1574.08 - 1576.56] of reasons medical medium information
[1575.76 - 1579.20] only
[1576.56 - 1580.32] but um but this is how it works you guys
[1579.20 - 1583.60] i just want to cover this
[1580.32 - 1584.16] one second if medical medium information
[1583.60 - 1585.84] says
[1584.16 - 1588.16] nutritional yeast is bad and it's the
[1585.84 - 1590.40] first place that says it right
[1588.16 - 1591.20] it gets out there and it gets all around
[1590.40 - 1593.04] and then
[1591.20 - 1594.64] someone hears it out there and they'll
[1593.04 - 1596.40] be like oh well wait a minute
[1594.64 - 1598.24] i heard it out there so no anthony
[1596.40 - 1600.08] doesn't know anything when it originated
[1598.24 - 1602.48] here it's unbelievable
[1600.08 - 1604.32] this is how it works it's not ego it's
[1602.48 - 1607.68] just or anything like that
[1604.32 - 1609.44] what it is is okay well don't you want
[1607.68 - 1611.12] to know where all the information is so
[1609.44 - 1613.04] someone can heal it's about getting
[1611.12 - 1613.76] people help so they have a way back to
[1613.04 - 1616.64] all of it
[1613.76 - 1618.24] oh heavy metals are bad in our system um
[1616.64 - 1620.40] but why are they bad in your system
[1618.24 - 1622.40] you'll find all the information here
[1620.40 - 1624.16] of why it's bad information no one's
[1622.40 - 1626.80] ever heard before and how it
[1624.16 - 1628.88] oxidizes in your brain and spreads into
[1626.80 - 1631.52] brain tissue nobody knew that ever
[1628.88 - 1632.16] nobody not one place so i say this stuff
[1631.52 - 1634.00] because
[1632.16 - 1635.60] if you hear about toxic heavy metals out
[1634.00 - 1637.04] there somewhere and
[1635.60 - 1638.64] know where all the information is so you
[1637.04 - 1640.48] can actually get them out of your system
[1638.64 - 1643.60] which leads to the next thing
[1640.48 - 1645.44] corella so here so corella's a terrible
[1643.60 - 1647.28] supplement for people to take but still
[1645.44 - 1648.40] even now you'll see like influencers on
[1647.28 - 1650.32] social media like
[1648.40 - 1652.96] taking my corella right now it's like oh
[1650.32 - 1655.28] my god it's just how does this keep on
[1652.96 - 1656.80] happening how do we get here where it
[1655.28 - 1659.60] keeps on happening it's
[1656.80 - 1660.88] so painful and so it's it's really tough
[1659.60 - 1663.60] because
[1660.88 - 1664.24] corella is toxic bottom line it's just
[1663.60 - 1666.08] toxic
[1664.24 - 1668.64] i'm just going to say it outright first
[1666.08 - 1669.28] of all most of them end up with bacteria
[1668.64 - 1671.20] in them
[1669.28 - 1672.80] i've seen people doubled over vomiting
[1671.20 - 1674.40] for days and days and days because of
[1672.80 - 1676.96] corella
[1674.40 - 1678.64] you can hit anybody at any time that's
[1676.96 - 1680.56] one thing corella also doesn't remove
[1678.64 - 1682.00] toxic heavy metals corella has toxic
[1680.56 - 1685.60] heavy metals in it
[1682.00 - 1687.12] like it goes on and on and on and on so
[1685.60 - 1688.48] all these things are important to know
[1687.12 - 1690.24] so if you're someone and you're like
[1688.48 - 1692.08] doing fish oil it's another one you
[1690.24 - 1693.92] can't get the mercury out of fish oil
[1692.08 - 1695.36] you cannot get the mercury out of fish
[1693.92 - 1697.92] oil i'm sorry you can't
[1695.36 - 1699.76] you can do a centrifuge chelation you
[1697.92 - 1702.08] can do anything you want
[1699.76 - 1704.64] on fish oil your guys you're not going
[1702.08 - 1706.24] to get the toxic heavy metal residue out
[1704.64 - 1707.36] the methyl mercury because the more you
[1706.24 - 1710.56] take it out
[1707.36 - 1713.04] of an oil fish oil the more more
[1710.56 - 1715.20] dangerous it gets because homeopathic
[1713.04 - 1717.68] and a homeopathic reaction occurs
[1715.20 - 1719.68] where you keep on diluting and diluting
[1717.68 - 1721.52] you keep on trying to get that mercury
[1719.68 - 1723.20] out and then that fish oil becomes more
[1721.52 - 1725.04] toxic and then the methyl mercury it
[1723.20 - 1727.36] goes to the brain it's it's it's
[1725.04 - 1728.32] less it's less toxic to eat a can of
[1727.36 - 1730.40] tuna fish
[1728.32 - 1732.32] than do fish oil supplements and we know
[1730.40 - 1735.44] how bad a can of tuna fish is
[1732.32 - 1736.64] so i mean there we go so fish oil is
[1735.44 - 1738.08] another example
[1736.64 - 1739.68] it's like i'm not getting better on a
[1738.08 - 1741.84] medical mean protocol but i'm on whey
[1739.68 - 1746.00] protein powder collagen fish oil
[1741.84 - 1748.56] uh corella um protein powders
[1746.00 - 1750.40] with msg in them glandular supplements
[1748.56 - 1752.40] bovine supplements whatever i mean it's
[1750.40 - 1753.92] it's it's the list goes on
[1752.40 - 1755.92] it's like and that person's not doing
[1753.92 - 1757.20] medical medium protocols it's just crazy
[1755.92 - 1759.12] how it works so
[1757.20 - 1760.24] um so the bottom line is one thing that
[1759.12 - 1762.96] can hold people back
[1760.24 - 1764.88] is supplementation not medical medium
[1762.96 - 1766.96] recommended and there's a reason for it
[1764.88 - 1770.48] i don't just pull this stuff
[1766.96 - 1773.68] out of my hat okay or whatever
[1770.48 - 1775.68] all right and it's like you know
[1773.68 - 1776.96] there's a reason why these things don't
[1775.68 - 1780.40] help people
[1776.96 - 1782.40] and it's it's critical reasons so just
[1780.40 - 1786.88] know this anyway if you just got on here
[1782.40 - 1789.20] cleanse the heel 16.99 51 off amazon.com
[1786.88 - 1790.88] the sale actually stopped the other day
[1789.20 - 1793.84] and it went up to 20
[1790.88 - 1796.32] and then it went back down to 16 as of
[1793.84 - 1798.24] today it's like a miracle so
[1796.32 - 1800.56] um take advantage of it or go to the
[1798.24 - 1802.08] library get it for free
[1800.56 - 1804.40] i don't have any control over the sale
[1802.08 - 1805.52] of the book on any level amazon does all
[1804.40 - 1808.64] that
[1805.52 - 1809.36] that's just how it's done so let's go
[1808.64 - 1811.12] into
[1809.36 - 1812.64] let's go into some examples here i
[1811.12 - 1813.20] talked about whey protein powder it'll
[1812.64 - 1816.08] feed
[1813.20 - 1817.76] pathogens it will feed pathogens i
[1816.08 - 1819.44] talked about l-carnitine
[1817.76 - 1820.88] also in the other medical medium books
[1819.44 - 1823.52] that will feed
[1820.88 - 1824.56] pathogens you can't get better while on
[1823.52 - 1826.08] l-carnitine
[1824.56 - 1828.40] you can't get better when you have a
[1826.08 - 1830.40] real sickness a real issue
[1828.40 - 1831.44] symptoms and conditions with whey
[1830.40 - 1832.96] protein powder
[1831.44 - 1834.88] you can't get better with these things
[1832.96 - 1836.88] they feed bugs you can't get better with
[1834.88 - 1838.80] natural flavorings and everything and
[1836.88 - 1840.96] msg and everything you guys
[1838.80 - 1842.40] this is critical and so like before i go
[1840.96 - 1843.84] anywhere with supplements you got to
[1842.40 - 1845.92] know this baseline
[1843.84 - 1846.96] so important traces of mercury and fish
[1845.92 - 1849.68] oil
[1846.96 - 1851.44] mercury will feed pathogens that's why
[1849.68 - 1852.24] people have the fibromyalgia the lyme
[1851.44 - 1854.80] disease
[1852.24 - 1855.60] the rheumatoid arthritis the hashimoto's
[1854.80 - 1858.56] thyroiditis
[1855.60 - 1859.52] psoriatic arthritis the sarcoidosis just
[1858.56 - 1862.80] the list goes on
[1859.52 - 1864.08] you know the vitiligo whatever i mean
[1862.80 - 1866.80] all these different conditions
[1864.08 - 1867.84] mercury will feed you know eczema
[1866.80 - 1871.84] psoriasis
[1867.84 - 1874.40] mercury will feed bugs keep bugs alive
[1871.84 - 1875.36] not a good thing so fish oil is another
[1874.40 - 1878.00] bomb right there
[1875.36 - 1880.56] all on its own so i'm just covering a
[1878.00 - 1882.32] few other things here too so
[1880.56 - 1884.48] um it's a common mistake and prime
[1882.32 - 1886.24] example of why it's best to hold off on
[1884.48 - 1889.84] some supplements while you're doing
[1886.24 - 1892.08] a medical medium recommended um
[1889.84 - 1893.52] you know cleanse so if you're doing 369
[1892.08 - 1894.80] if you're doing mono eating cleanse if
[1893.52 - 1895.20] you're doing the morning cleanse if
[1894.80 - 1897.52] you're doing
[1895.20 - 1899.44] these powerful cleanses that are saving
[1897.52 - 1900.96] lives every day out there
[1899.44 - 1902.72] it's important to kind of hold off
[1900.96 - 1903.68] supplements you're doing because chances
[1902.72 - 1906.08] are
[1903.68 - 1907.60] before you got the book and before you
[1906.08 - 1909.52] started the cleanse
[1907.60 - 1910.88] you got i'm just using some of these as
[1909.52 - 1912.48] examples you got the corelli got the
[1910.88 - 1914.64] fish oil you got the
[1912.48 - 1916.16] you know you got the whatever and and
[1914.64 - 1917.76] everything i was talking about there the
[1916.16 - 1919.36] collagen the whey protein powder the
[1917.76 - 1920.00] other protein powders have msg in it
[1919.36 - 1922.24] that nobody knows
[1920.00 - 1923.28] about you're going to be on something
[1922.24 - 1924.64] and then you're going to go into the
[1923.28 - 1925.92] cleanse and you're going to be on these
[1924.64 - 1928.96] supplements that
[1925.92 - 1930.24] aren't getting you better and then see
[1928.96 - 1932.80] how it all works

[2074.32 - 2078.32] um to begin with so that's the first
[2076.56 - 2081.04] important critical piece all right
[2078.32 - 2082.48] so once you've found your symptom or
[2081.04 - 2086.40] condition
[2082.48 - 2089.52] here in the book if you're sensitive
[2086.40 - 2089.84] you can try one supplement a day if
[2089.52 - 2092.32] you're
[2089.84 - 2093.28] sensitive you can try one supplement a
[2092.32 - 2097.36] day you guys
[2093.28 - 2099.76] if not you can put them all together
[2097.36 - 2101.28] as your daily like regimen so you can
[2099.76 - 2102.16] put them all together as your daily
[2101.28 - 2104.16] regimen
[2102.16 - 2106.00] or as a middle ground you can choose a
[2104.16 - 2107.04] couple to start off with and then take
[2106.00 - 2108.64] it from there
[2107.04 - 2110.88] so that's the way to go you can easily
[2108.64 - 2112.16] do that you can start with celery juice
[2110.88 - 2113.60] that's one thing you can start with
[2112.16 - 2115.04] celery juice that's an herb that's
[2113.60 - 2118.48] herbal medicine
[2115.04 - 2120.40] it's herbal medicine and so celery juice
[2118.48 - 2121.68] is an herbal medicine you can start with
[2120.40 - 2124.16] that herbal medicine
[2121.68 - 2125.28] you guys just so you know that that's
[2124.16 - 2128.00] what you can do
[2125.28 - 2129.68] and that's a big deal and starting there
[2128.00 - 2131.20] is just to start all on its own
[2129.68 - 2133.68] if you're somebody sensitive work your
[2131.20 - 2134.24] way up work your way up to 32 ounces of
[2133.68 - 2136.88] it
[2134.24 - 2137.52] that's what you can do and then well
[2136.88 - 2139.84] okay
[2137.52 - 2142.00] well another place you can go is b12
[2139.84 - 2143.84] that's another place you go so
[2142.00 - 2145.84] i'm gonna talk about like they're gonna
[2143.84 - 2147.44] so anyone who goes in there
[2145.84 - 2149.44] you're gonna see in here you're gonna
[2147.44 - 2152.72] see a baseline you'll see b12
[2149.44 - 2155.36] zinc vitamin c lemon balm okay
[2152.72 - 2156.48] you'll see those four and you'll see a
[2155.36 - 2158.24] list of most
[2156.48 - 2159.60] important for somebody to start with
[2158.24 - 2160.16] because you might be like well where do
[2159.60 - 2162.00] i start
[2160.16 - 2164.00] what's the most important supplement how
[2162.00 - 2165.44] do i do this well let's go to anxiety
[2164.00 - 2167.28] and anxiousness so i'm gonna head there
[2165.44 - 2167.92] now so i'm in anxiety and anxiousness
[2167.28 - 2173.84] right here
[2167.92 - 2173.84] okay so
[2175.04 - 2178.16] anxiety and anxiousness and you'll see
[2176.88 - 2178.72] all the different supplements and
[2178.16 - 2182.40] everything
[2178.72 - 2185.44] and i marked on anxiety right here i
[2182.40 - 2188.00] marked with a pen the number one
[2185.44 - 2189.60] thing you can try for this which is b12
[2188.00 - 2192.16] so if you have anxiety
[2189.60 - 2194.32] you can try b12 as number one you know
[2192.16 - 2195.92] my favorite b12 is the vimergy so it's
[2194.32 - 2198.56] the vimergy v is in victor i
[2195.92 - 2200.08] am as the mary ergy that's the vimerg
[2198.56 - 2201.36] b12 it's adenosine cobalamin
[2200.08 - 2203.12] methylcobalamin right
[2201.36 - 2204.80] but it's the best and highest quality on
[2203.12 - 2206.24] every level um
[2204.80 - 2209.04] and that makes a difference because
[2206.24 - 2210.88] crappy b12s don't really help i mean you
[2209.04 - 2211.52] can try your best to try to get the best
[2210.88 - 2213.60] that you can
[2211.52 - 2215.36] and you might get help a little bit but
[2213.60 - 2217.20] you know it's not easy out there i get
[2215.36 - 2218.16] it but that's the one i would use that's
[2217.20 - 2222.32] my favorite
[2218.16 - 2224.08] so b12 and if b12 is showing high in
[2222.32 - 2227.60] blood tests okay
[2224.08 - 2230.16] doesn't mean you're getting enough b12
[2227.60 - 2231.44] because b12 high in your blood means
[2230.16 - 2233.68] that there's a methylation
[2231.44 - 2235.44] issue so that means there's no reason to
[2233.68 - 2236.32] stop taking b12 if you have it high in a
[2235.44 - 2238.88] blood test
[2236.32 - 2241.12] because methylation issues are are
[2238.88 - 2243.44] what's happening when b12 does not
[2241.12 - 2244.80] when the liver is stagnant and sluggish
[2243.44 - 2246.48] and you have methylation lip
[2244.80 - 2248.64] issues in the liver which most people
[2246.48 - 2250.32] have then what will show up
[2248.64 - 2252.16] is the b12 will float around in the
[2250.32 - 2254.00] bloodstream and not enter into the
[2252.16 - 2255.20] nervous system not enter into deep
[2254.00 - 2256.64] places so when
[2255.20 - 2258.72] when you get a blood test and it's
[2256.64 - 2260.24] showing high on b12
[2258.72 - 2263.12] it doesn't mean your nervous system is
[2260.24 - 2265.36] high in b12 it doesn't mean your brain
[2263.12 - 2267.36] is high in b12 it's just showing up in
[2265.36 - 2268.96] bloodstream as high in b12
[2267.36 - 2270.72] doesn't mean the methylation is working
[2268.96 - 2271.28] properly to get it deep into the nervous
[2270.72 - 2273.76] system
[2271.28 - 2275.28] which takes time so what people do is
[2273.76 - 2277.12] they'll make mistakes they'll stop b12
[2275.28 - 2278.64] altogether because a test would say
[2277.12 - 2280.00] it's high in b12 but they'll stop all
[2278.64 - 2281.36] together or they were using the wrong
[2280.00 - 2283.12] kind of b12
[2281.36 - 2284.72] and that's another thing all on its own
[2283.12 - 2286.08] so then they get cheated out of actually
[2284.72 - 2288.16] healing anxiety
[2286.08 - 2290.24] cheated out of healing um all kinds of
[2288.16 - 2292.48] different neurological symptoms
[2290.24 - 2293.44] ticks and spasms and aches and pains and
[2292.48 - 2296.16] because you know
[2293.44 - 2297.92] b12 is that critical for that so you got
[2296.16 - 2299.20] to be cautious on that when it shows up
[2297.92 - 2300.40] high the other thing is
[2299.20 - 2302.00] science research doesn't know what kind
[2300.40 - 2303.44] of b12 levels we're supposed to have
[2302.00 - 2305.52] with all the pathogens
[2303.44 - 2307.36] all the bugs all the toxins all the
[2305.52 - 2309.04] stress we're under
[2307.36 - 2310.88] science research doesn't govern all that
[2309.04 - 2312.00] or factor all that in they don't factor
[2310.88 - 2314.08] any of that in of what
[2312.00 - 2315.04] level of b12 is whatever the right kind
[2314.08 - 2318.16] of b12 or not
[2315.04 - 2319.20] it's so many so many potholes it's
[2318.16 - 2320.72] unbelievable
[2319.20 - 2322.16] to the degree of potholes all
[2320.72 - 2323.68] information that comes from medical
[2322.16 - 2326.00] media and
[2323.68 - 2327.60] all originates here i mean it just does
[2326.00 - 2329.76] all this type of information
[2327.60 - 2331.20] no one had any of this they don't it's
[2329.76 - 2332.40] just it's just i have to say that
[2331.20 - 2334.48] because
[2332.40 - 2336.40] it's critical to to know where it comes
[2334.48 - 2338.24] from so people can find their way
[2336.40 - 2340.24] and if it didn't come from here i
[2338.24 - 2343.52] wouldn't be saying it that's this
[2340.24 - 2346.32] it is what it is um
[2343.52 - 2346.72] so let's go into this a little bit so
[2346.32 - 2348.72] okay
[2346.72 - 2349.84] so where to start you have anxiety so
[2348.72 - 2352.56] let's head in there
[2349.84 - 2353.20] if someone has anxiety or anxiousness
[2352.56 - 2354.80] okay
[2353.20 - 2357.20] the best place to start when you look in
[2354.80 - 2358.32] supplements supplements right here i got
[2357.20 - 2361.44] i marked them
[2358.32 - 2362.48] you'll see number one is b12 number two
[2361.44 - 2364.80] is zinc
[2362.48 - 2365.84] so let's see the zinc that i use as
[2364.80 - 2370.32] example
[2365.84 - 2370.32] um so i'm on page
[2370.96 - 2375.20] 491 for a second but we're really we're
[2373.52 - 2377.28] i'm only showing this as an example on
[2375.20 - 2379.68] page 491 where anxiety
[2377.28 - 2380.64] and i'm just showing you that there's
[2379.68 - 2385.20] there's there's
[2380.64 - 2386.08] um but really 476 is where i am though
[2385.20 - 2388.72] so i'm just gonna
[2386.08 - 2389.68] show you guys if you go in page 476 and
[2388.72 - 2391.84] cleanse the heel
[2389.68 - 2393.36] it says where to start right here i got
[2391.84 - 2394.96] all my little postage notes
[2393.36 - 2396.72] i i got a new book and i'm because that
[2394.96 - 2398.00] potions notes were on on the other book
[2396.72 - 2398.72] they filled up the whole thing so i'm
[2398.00 - 2403.04] just putting
[2398.72 - 2405.28] i'm starting fresh so in here
[2403.04 - 2407.28] it says celery juice is a good place to
[2405.28 - 2408.32] start beyond that vitamin b12 i showed
[2407.28 - 2410.56] you that guys
[2408.32 - 2412.72] zinc is the next one to start right here
[2410.56 - 2413.68] that's the vimergy zinc the one i love
[2412.72 - 2416.80] it's the right kind of zinc it's a
[2413.68 - 2419.84] liquid zinc sulfate but it's done right
[2416.80 - 2422.00] which cry which is critical um
[2419.84 - 2423.68] vitamin c is the third thing lemon bob's
[2422.00 - 2424.64] the fourth thing so what i do is i'll
[2423.68 - 2427.20] say hey
[2424.64 - 2428.96] if i got an anxiety disorder and i can't
[2427.20 - 2430.32] get rid of my anxiety and it's and i'm
[2428.96 - 2431.28] struggling with it and i'm suffering
[2430.32 - 2433.84] from it
[2431.28 - 2435.52] um first thing i would do is start a
[2433.84 - 2437.28] cleanse start when the cleanses and
[2435.52 - 2438.72] medical medium cleanse the heal second
[2437.28 - 2440.08] thing i would go i would read the
[2438.72 - 2441.60] supplements chapter and i would go and
[2440.08 - 2442.48] find anxiety in here this is what i
[2441.60 - 2444.00] would do
[2442.48 - 2446.96] and i would look and i would say well
[2444.00 - 2448.64] since i read the chapter it said
[2446.96 - 2450.16] start with just a few supplements if i
[2448.64 - 2451.44] want i don't have to do the whole
[2450.16 - 2453.68] protocol of everything
[2451.44 - 2455.68] i can just start with a few supplements
[2453.68 - 2458.72] and b12 is one of them
[2455.68 - 2462.24] it says three dropper fulls twice
[2458.72 - 2464.96] a day so for anxiety it says three
[2462.24 - 2466.24] dropper fulls twice a day of b12 and you
[2464.96 - 2468.00] go to your doctor
[2466.24 - 2469.28] you go to your practitioner and you can
[2468.00 - 2469.84] talk to them about that and that's what
[2469.28 - 2471.52] you can do
[2469.84 - 2474.16] so it's three dropper fulls twice a day
[2471.52 - 2478.00] that's one dropper full right there
[2474.16 - 2479.44] as an example and
[2478.00 - 2480.56] if you're sensitive though i'm going to
[2479.44 - 2481.28] read about that in a little bit if
[2480.56 - 2483.76] you're sensitive
[2481.28 - 2485.76] you can just do a few drops if you want
[2483.76 - 2488.80] i mean you can just literally start with
[2485.76 - 2489.76] a few drops one two three that's what
[2488.80 - 2491.76] you can do
[2489.76 - 2494.96] i mean if i was sensitive that's what i
[2491.76 - 2497.44] would do and you can do just a few drops
[2494.96 - 2498.08] um so the second thing i would go with
[2497.44 - 2500.64] would be
[2498.08 - 2502.16] zinc so that's the second thing right
[2500.64 - 2502.88] there and i would do the same thing it
[2502.16 - 2506.00] says
[2502.88 - 2508.32] zinc one dropper full daily of zinc so
[2506.00 - 2510.24] one dropper full daily of zinc
[2508.32 - 2512.08] and everybody's zinc deficient we have
[2510.24 - 2513.92] to understand that the soils are
[2512.08 - 2516.16] zinc deficient our food is zinc
[2513.92 - 2519.04] deficient organic food
[2516.16 - 2520.00] organic produce and organic food is zinc
[2519.04 - 2522.16] deficient
[2520.00 - 2523.12] so that's just how it works and so what
[2522.16 - 2525.36] happens is zinc
[2523.12 - 2527.04] controls our immune system that's what
[2525.36 - 2530.56] gives our immune system the power
[2527.04 - 2532.72] to battle everything that's why zinc is
[2530.56 - 2535.12] critical for what's going around now
[2532.72 - 2536.16] but zinc is critical for all the viral
[2535.12 - 2538.24] stuff all
[2536.16 - 2540.40] of it the epstein bars the shingles
[2538.24 - 2541.12] hhv-6s nobody talks about all these
[2540.40 - 2543.52] things
[2541.12 - 2545.28] critical for all of that so zinc is the
[2543.52 - 2546.64] next one right you'll see that and this
[2545.28 - 2549.68] is the vimergy zinc
[2546.64 - 2551.60] v is in victor i am ergy it's it's a
[2549.68 - 2553.36] liquid zinc sulfate but it's the right
[2551.60 - 2554.48] way to do it in the right kind like i
[2553.36 - 2556.24] said before
[2554.48 - 2559.20] so we'll go into the third thing vitamin
[2556.24 - 2561.04] c so that's the microc that i use right
[2559.20 - 2562.88] here it's the vimergy microc
[2561.04 - 2564.16] if you have a vitamin c you like it love
[2562.88 - 2566.56] it and
[2564.16 - 2567.20] and by all means try it and do that but
[2566.56 - 2570.24] for
[2567.20 - 2573.92] for anxiety you don't want one that
[2570.24 - 2575.28] is that straight ascorbic acid no buffer
[2573.92 - 2577.84] whatsoever because
[2575.28 - 2579.52] that's going to be irritating with
[2577.84 - 2582.24] anxiety if anything so
[2579.52 - 2584.00] that's why it says micro c really
[2582.24 - 2585.04] important on here it's the type of
[2584.00 - 2588.24] buffered kind
[2585.04 - 2589.52] so then we got the fourth is lemon balm
[2588.24 - 2591.68] so i'm going to go into that for a
[2589.52 - 2594.16] minute too you got the lemon balm
[2591.68 - 2595.84] lemon balm is critical for anxiety it's
[2594.16 - 2599.12] a great one right there i mean
[2595.84 - 2599.76] and it'll stay for anxiety four dropper
[2599.12 - 2603.36] fulls
[2599.76 - 2604.48] four times a day now if you got really
[2603.36 - 2606.48] mild anxiety
[2604.48 - 2608.00] you can do a half a dropper full you can
[2606.48 - 2611.04] do one dropper full
[2608.00 - 2611.52] you can do two for a whole day you can
[2611.04 - 2615.12] do
[2611.52 - 2615.92] three tiny drops you can do lemon balm
[2615.12 - 2618.48] tea
[2615.92 - 2620.32] this is traditional medicinals it's my
[2618.48 - 2622.48] favorite tea company so
[2620.32 - 2623.44] they got that's a lemon balm that i
[2622.48 - 2626.24] actually you know
[2623.44 - 2627.84] i have lemon balm tea every single day i
[2626.24 - 2629.36] like it because it's anti-viral
[2627.84 - 2630.48] anti-bacterial i like to keep my immune
[2629.36 - 2632.16] system strong
[2630.48 - 2634.08] you know just in case you bump into
[2632.16 - 2637.28] something or you're somewhere public
[2634.08 - 2638.40] and you know pick up something so i love
[2637.28 - 2640.48] the lemon bumps so
[2638.40 - 2642.40] but if you're that's the whole great
[2640.48 - 2643.60] thing is you look and you're like well
[2642.40 - 2645.12] lemon balm
[2643.60 - 2646.80] and they'll say four dropper holes twice
[2645.12 - 2648.88] a day okay so that's
[2646.80 - 2650.72] you know that's the lemon balm here but
[2648.88 - 2652.56] you can do smaller dosages
[2650.72 - 2654.00] if you if you're chemical sensitive if
[2652.56 - 2655.92] you've got food sensitivities if you're
[2654.00 - 2658.08] a really sensitive person
[2655.92 - 2659.44] you've got so many options here you can
[2658.08 - 2662.56] do one
[2659.44 - 2665.76] supplement one day then the next day
[2662.56 - 2667.44] do another one then the next day do
[2665.76 - 2671.04] another one
[2667.44 - 2674.56] and keep it just one at a time
[2671.04 - 2676.16] or three tiny drops of one three tiny
[2674.56 - 2678.48] drops of another and
[2676.16 - 2680.32] you can do so much that's why there's
[2678.48 - 2682.64] thousands of combinations
[2680.32 - 2683.52] with the medical medium protocols that's
[2682.64 - 2685.28] the whole point
[2683.52 - 2687.12] but i walk you through when i answer
[2685.28 - 2688.72] questions and i and i give you the
[2687.12 - 2690.08] information in this book if you're
[2688.72 - 2692.16] somebody that just got on

[2715.44 - 2718.80] here i am
[2716.80 - 2720.16] i'm reading about this a little bit more
[2718.80 - 2721.12] and if you're ready to move forward
[2720.16 - 2723.28] beyond that
[2721.12 - 2724.64] if your list if you have a symptom
[2723.28 - 2726.16] condition that you find in back of the
[2724.64 - 2727.04] book out of the 200 symptoms and
[2726.16 - 2729.28] conditions
[2727.04 - 2730.56] okay and you have a a symptom or a
[2729.28 - 2734.32] condition back there

[2736.16 - 2740.56] lysine i'd give you
[2737.36 - 2741.60] direction on the most important ones to
[2740.56 - 2744.00] work with
[2741.60 - 2746.16] if you're getting overwhelmed at the
[2744.00 - 2747.84] amount of supplements in a list the
[2746.16 - 2748.56] reason why there's more supplementation
[2747.84 - 2750.00] in the list
[2748.56 - 2752.16] some people have more difficult
[2750.00 - 2753.12] pathogens they'll have a really stubborn
[2752.16 - 2754.48] epstein bar
[2753.12 - 2756.16] they'll have one of the over 60
[2754.48 - 2758.24] varieties of epstein-barr or
[2756.16 - 2760.00] two of them and they'll have two of them
[2758.24 - 2761.36] in their liver one in their thyroid
[2760.00 - 2763.12] and they'll and and they're really
[2761.36 - 2764.80] struggling or they'll have shingles or
[2763.12 - 2766.24] they'll have cytomegalovirus or they'll
[2764.80 - 2769.52] have streptococcus causing
[2766.24 - 2770.00] sibo or bloat or acne they'll have strep
[2769.52 - 2772.24] causing
[2770.00 - 2773.68] you know all those things or utis or
[2772.24 - 2775.20] bladder infections or
[2773.68 - 2778.40] urinary tract infections kidney
[2775.20 - 2780.88] infections so i give you options to go
[2778.40 - 2781.84] further and further and that's so
[2780.88 - 2785.36] important
[2781.84 - 2787.52] and that's how that's how you actually
[2785.36 - 2789.12] get people better is you have the
[2787.52 - 2792.64] choices and options
[2789.12 - 2795.28] with the right information so they don't
[2792.64 - 2796.96] have they don't just stop like oh i
[2795.28 - 2797.28] tried medical medium protocol it didn't
[2796.96 - 2799.68] work
[2797.28 - 2801.60] what you tried you did 32 ounces of
[2799.68 - 2804.40] celery juice twice a day
[2801.60 - 2804.88] um you did the heavy metal detox cleanse
[2804.40 - 2807.92] um
[2804.88 - 2809.68] you you lowered your fat long enough um
[2807.92 - 2811.52] you actually did supplementation in its
[2809.68 - 2813.12] fullest extent if you wanted to
[2811.52 - 2816.64] so and if you but like i said if you're
[2813.12 - 2819.68] really sensitive you can do little drops
[2816.64 - 2823.20] and i'm going to go to um
[2819.68 - 2823.20] page 497 now
[2825.28 - 2828.88] okay you can use this technique if
[2827.68 - 2830.56] you're sensitive so i'm going to give
[2828.88 - 2831.12] you a rundown on the technique if you're
[2830.56 - 2834.48] sensitive
[2831.12 - 2837.12] right and you can do little
[2834.48 - 2838.88] drops small amounts so if i'm in if
[2837.12 - 2840.32] you're truly chemical sensitive if you
[2838.88 - 2842.48] have food sensitivities
[2840.32 - 2844.24] you can use this food and chemical
[2842.48 - 2845.84] sensitivity technique
[2844.24 - 2848.32] if you feel you're sensitive you may be
[2845.84 - 2850.00] somebody that's not chemical sensitive
[2848.32 - 2852.48] you're not food sensitive but you're
[2850.00 - 2854.88] sensitive you're just sensitive
[2852.48 - 2855.68] and if you're sensitive and you can use
[2854.88 - 2857.44] this technique
[2855.68 - 2859.12] so you don't have to be under the guise
[2857.44 - 2860.96] of food sensitivities or chemical
[2859.12 - 2862.32] sensitivities to use this technique
[2860.96 - 2864.24] so i'll show you this technique which is
[2862.32 - 2865.68] really cool
[2864.24 - 2867.36] everyone with chemical and food
[2865.68 - 2869.04] sensitivities is different
[2867.36 - 2871.12] and everyone with sensitivities is
[2869.04 - 2873.20] different you're welcome to explore
[2871.12 - 2875.76] any of the supplements in this chapter
[2873.20 - 2878.16] the list here is simply a starting point
[2875.76 - 2879.68] for some sensitive people okay the fresh
[2878.16 - 2881.52] celery juice
[2879.68 - 2883.12] that's one place you can start the raw
[2881.52 - 2884.40] honey another place you can start is a
[2883.12 - 2886.24] daily routine
[2884.40 - 2888.32] for the other herbs and supplements in
[2886.24 - 2891.68] this book take only one
[2888.32 - 2894.96] supplement one day if you want take one
[2891.68 - 2895.84] another day cycle that's one thing you
[2894.96 - 2897.60] can do
[2895.84 - 2899.20] you can do this on an eight day cycle
[2897.60 - 2900.64] and i talk about it here really you need
[2899.20 - 2901.20] to get the book and you need to read
[2900.64 - 2903.04] that
[2901.20 - 2904.72] so you can kind of like really digest
[2903.04 - 2905.84] that because i'm i'm going to cover so
[2904.72 - 2907.36] much ground here that
[2905.84 - 2910.08] i can only spend so much time with each
[2907.36 - 2912.56] powerful point um
[2910.08 - 2914.08] so and okay here's a question i always
[2912.56 - 2917.60] get all the time you guys can you
[2914.08 - 2919.68] put supplements in a smoothie yes
[2917.60 - 2921.36] but you don't have to here's what i like
[2919.68 - 2923.52] to do okay
[2921.36 - 2925.12] i like to do this first of all um with
[2923.52 - 2926.84] vimergy supplements
[2925.12 - 2928.96] because that's what i take myself
[2926.84 - 2930.00] personally i i don't put it in my
[2928.96 - 2931.68] smoothie i don't put
[2930.00 - 2933.76] supplements really in my smoothie like
[2931.68 - 2935.36] all like little tinctures all the herbs
[2933.76 - 2936.08] and all that i don't normally do that
[2935.36 - 2939.92] all right
[2936.08 - 2942.00] so what i like to do is um
[2939.92 - 2943.76] i like to get a little shot glass a
[2942.00 - 2944.24] small little glass put an ounce of water
[2943.76 - 2945.68] in it
[2944.24 - 2947.76] that's what i like to do personally and
[2945.68 - 2949.92] i put all my tinctures in there
[2947.76 - 2951.12] and then i just send it down and i chase
[2949.92 - 2952.00] it down with a little water if you don't
[2951.12 - 2955.36] like the taste
[2952.00 - 2956.56] that's what i like to do okay so um but
[2955.36 - 2958.48] people like to put it all in their
[2956.56 - 2959.76] smoothie but i don't like to put all the
[2958.48 - 2961.76] different tinctures and all
[2959.76 - 2963.68] all the subs in the smoothie because i
[2961.76 - 2965.60] want my smoothie to taste more like food
[2963.68 - 2967.92] and not herbal supplements
[2965.60 - 2969.36] um so that that's what i personally
[2967.92 - 2970.96] choose so you gotta dip you know a
[2969.36 - 2972.32] couple different options and all that to
[2970.96 - 2975.52] what you want to do
[2972.32 - 2979.20] um and
[2975.52 - 2981.12] so so that's just
[2979.20 - 2982.56] this is a quick answer for that that
[2981.12 - 2985.04] question and
[2982.56 - 2986.48] but but also i i also take them straight
[2985.04 - 2988.16] so i take all the liquid straight so
[2986.48 - 2988.72] that's what i do too a lot of times like
[2988.16 - 2990.72] i'll be
[2988.72 - 2992.72] a little bit too lazy i'm i got too much
[2990.72 - 2994.16] going on or i got so much on my plate
[2992.72 - 2995.84] i'll just instead of getting a shot
[2994.16 - 2996.40] glass and putting an ounce of water in
[2995.84 - 2998.88] it
[2996.40 - 3000.80] or small glass you know because you know
[2998.88 - 3002.72] whatever and put put water in it
[3000.80 - 3004.80] i just would do them straight to boom
[3002.72 - 3006.16] boom boom take them straight then drink
[3004.80 - 3008.56] right off you know glass of water
[3006.16 - 3011.20] whatever send it on down too
[3008.56 - 3012.56] so um that's what i that's what you can
[3011.20 - 3015.20] do
[3012.56 - 3016.24] when you see the term daily this is
[3015.20 - 3018.24] interesting
[3016.24 - 3020.00] that means to take the given dosage of
[3018.24 - 3021.52] the supplements over the course of the
[3020.00 - 3025.04] day you can take it
[3021.52 - 3028.32] over the course of the day okay um
[3025.04 - 3030.24] and and it's your choice on how you want
[3028.32 - 3031.36] to do that so when you say when you see
[3030.24 - 3034.88] daily you can
[3031.36 - 3036.96] it means that to take the given dosages
[3034.88 - 3037.52] of the supplement over the course of the
[3036.96 - 3039.36] day
[3037.52 - 3041.52] it's your choice on how to do that
[3039.36 - 3044.88] you're welcome to take the whole dose
[3041.52 - 3046.56] once a day when you see that whole
[3044.88 - 3047.20] section back here and cleanse the heel
[3046.56 - 3049.04] all right
[3047.20 - 3050.96] if you're sensitive you may want to
[3049.04 - 3052.40] break it up into multiple servings for
[3050.96 - 3054.32] example if it says to take
[3052.40 - 3055.44] two teaspoons of barley grass juice
[3054.32 - 3057.44] powder daily
[3055.44 - 3059.52] you may decide either to put both
[3057.44 - 3061.12] teaspoons together in a smoothie
[3059.52 - 3062.96] those work good in a smoothie by the way
[3061.12 - 3063.76] because the heavy metal detox movie has
[3062.96 - 3065.92] the
[3063.76 - 3069.84] the uh barley grass juice powder that's
[3065.92 - 3071.60] the bimrgy it has the spirulina
[3069.84 - 3073.12] the incredible spirulina it's the best
[3071.60 - 3074.32] carolina there's
[3073.12 - 3075.76] the emergencies barely is best in the
[3074.32 - 3076.16] world i put the wild blueberry powder in
[3075.76 - 3077.44] there
[3076.16 - 3078.96] you guys have seen that i did that the
[3077.44 - 3080.64] other day that medical medium heavy
[3078.96 - 3082.56] metal detox smoothie
[3080.64 - 3084.88] and it'll say for example it takes two
[3082.56 - 3086.40] you know it says two teaspoons of barley
[3084.88 - 3088.08] grass juice powder daily
[3086.40 - 3090.00] you may decide either to put both
[3088.08 - 3091.84] teaspoons together in a smoothie
[3090.00 - 3093.60] or have one teaspoon in the morning
[3091.84 - 3095.04] smoothie and one teaspoon in your water
[3093.60 - 3097.60] at night if you really wanted to i mean
[3095.04 - 3100.32] you can do it in so many different ways
[3097.60 - 3100.72] when you see the term twice a day that
[3100.32 - 3103.36] means
[3100.72 - 3104.80] two installments taking it taken at any
[3103.36 - 3106.96] time of day
[3104.80 - 3107.84] as long as they're at least four hours
[3106.96 - 3109.68] apart
[3107.84 - 3110.96] if you miss one of those installments on
[3109.68 - 3114.00] any given day
[3110.96 - 3115.20] try to start fresh the next day so
[3114.00 - 3116.96] that's just a little something right
[3115.20 - 3119.44] there to cover too
[3116.96 - 3120.72] i want to talk about um children's
[3119.44 - 3124.72] dosages in a minute
[3120.72 - 3128.56] and all of that quality is critical
[3124.72 - 3128.56] and i want to read that right now
[3131.52 - 3134.56] first of all actually singles for a
[3133.28 - 3135.60] reason it has something to do with
[3134.56 - 3136.96] quality too
[3135.60 - 3138.80] this is important someone cleans the
[3136.96 - 3141.92] heal if you just got here
[3138.80 - 3144.48] the book's on sale 16.99 51
[3141.92 - 3145.28] off amazon.com in the us take advantage
[3144.48 - 3147.12] of the sale
[3145.28 - 3148.32] because if the sale was gone and then it
[3147.12 - 3150.24] came back because they
[3148.32 - 3152.72] control it at amazon i couldn't believe
[3150.24 - 3154.72] it's back it's a medical textbook
[3152.72 - 3156.56] and take advantage of it or go to the
[3154.72 - 3157.68] library go to library and get it out for
[3156.56 - 3160.32] free
[3157.68 - 3163.28] i mean that's what i would do i'd be
[3160.32 - 3164.96] like i'm heading to the library
[3163.28 - 3166.80] and just going to grab the book for you
[3164.96 - 3169.52] grab it out for free um
[3166.80 - 3171.04] that's an option so singles for a reason
[3169.52 - 3174.16] right here you'll notice that almost
[3171.04 - 3175.20] every one of these items you come across
[3174.16 - 3177.68] in the urban
[3175.20 - 3178.56] supplement section you get ready guys
[3177.68 - 3180.32] like in the
[3178.56 - 3182.00] in this right here in the supplement
[3180.32 - 3184.56] section of dosages
[3182.00 - 3185.52] and conditions right here it's canker
[3184.56 - 3187.36] sores
[3185.52 - 3188.72] uh chemical and food sensitivities
[3187.36 - 3192.56] cataracts
[3188.72 - 3195.20] um uh bloating brain fog
[3192.56 - 3196.96] when you're in here anxiety autoimmune
[3195.20 - 3197.44] diseases and disorders when you're in
[3196.96 - 3200.32] here
[3197.44 - 3202.56] okay addiction adrenal problems
[3200.32 - 3206.40] alzheimer's
[3202.56 - 3208.08] um acne when you're in here
[3206.40 - 3209.68] what you'll notice is that most of the
[3208.08 - 3213.28] supplements recommended
[3209.68 - 3214.16] are in single form individual single
[3213.28 - 3217.04] form
[3214.16 - 3218.32] and some of them might have a few things
[3217.04 - 3220.40] in there
[3218.32 - 3222.44] but most of them are in single form
[3220.40 - 3226.08] you'll see spirulina
[3222.44 - 3229.92] asparalina and that's how you
[3226.08 - 3231.60] actually get better when you take a
[3229.92 - 3234.88] powder form out there
[3231.60 - 3238.56] that has 50 ingredients in there
[3234.88 - 3239.60] 30 ingredients in there 25 ingredients
[3238.56 - 3242.24] in there
[3239.60 - 3243.60] chances of getting better are slim to
[3242.24 - 3245.36] none
[3243.60 - 3247.60] because what happens is supplement
[3245.36 - 3250.64] companies use a speck
[3247.60 - 3251.84] of spirulina and a crappy one and they
[3250.64 - 3253.04] throw it in there so you'll see
[3251.84 - 3256.48] spirulina on the list
[3253.04 - 3257.84] whoa alfalfa grass barley grass
[3256.48 - 3259.60] spirulina
[3257.84 - 3261.04] gorilla i mean what you mean you just
[3259.60 - 3263.52] see whatever going down the list
[3261.04 - 3264.96] collagen uh minerals trace minerals
[3263.52 - 3266.40] amino acids um
[3264.96 - 3269.28] and you're reading a whole list of these
[3266.40 - 3272.24] things you can't get better on those
[3269.28 - 3274.08] you can't that's what goes wrong so some
[3272.24 - 3276.48] people like oh i did the medical medium
[3274.08 - 3279.76] protocol i just i had lysine
[3276.48 - 3283.28] they had a speck of lysine in a
[3279.76 - 3283.92] amino acid formula that had 20 amino
[3283.28 - 3285.92] acids
[3283.92 - 3287.68] it's like throwing away money and not
[3285.92 - 3289.76] getting better
[3287.68 - 3291.20] and so you'll see that when you look in
[3289.76 - 3292.48] here at lysine
[3291.20 - 3294.64] i don't even know if i have a lysine
[3292.48 - 3295.84] right here i do i have a vimergy lysine
[3294.64 - 3298.48] right in front of me here
[3295.84 - 3299.76] when you see lysine you're getting
[3298.48 - 3301.44] enough lysine
[3299.76 - 3303.36] and then you know why you're using
[3301.44 - 3305.20] lysine because you're killing off
[3303.36 - 3307.12] epstein-barr you're knocking back
[3305.20 - 3308.48] epstein barr and when you knock down
[3307.12 - 3310.08] epstein bar and shingles
[3308.48 - 3311.60] often your tingles and numbness start to
[3310.08 - 3313.04] get a little better off stir aches and
[3311.60 - 3314.64] pains and your fatigue starts getting
[3313.04 - 3317.04] better over time
[3314.64 - 3317.76] and what happens is that supplement
[3317.04 - 3319.92] companies
[3317.76 - 3321.92] put 30 things in something 20 things in
[3319.92 - 3323.20] something 15 things in something 10 or
[3321.92 - 3325.36] more
[3323.20 - 3326.88] and when you have 10 or more in all
[3325.36 - 3329.92] these different supplements
[3326.88 - 3334.24] they got fillers in the supplement then
[3329.92 - 3337.36] you have a speck of dust of each thing
[3334.24 - 3338.16] it's how they take advantage rip off and
[3337.36 - 3340.32] scam
[3338.16 - 3341.44] millions and millions and hundreds of
[3340.32 - 3344.24] millions of people
[3341.44 - 3345.44] it's the game see i talk to supplement
[3344.24 - 3349.68] companies
[3345.44 - 3352.16] i know the game i know all the crap
[3349.68 - 3354.16] all the twists even the best vegan
[3352.16 - 3355.60] company supplements starting out now
[3354.16 - 3357.36] that think they're so great they'll have
[3355.60 - 3358.88] like 15 things in there a little bit of
[3357.36 - 3360.48] this a little bit of maca
[3358.88 - 3362.16] a little bit of that little bit of this
[3360.48 - 3364.24] and they're ripping you off and
[3362.16 - 3365.36] just sending you down the river without
[3364.24 - 3367.20] a paddle
[3365.36 - 3369.36] and that's what they're doing so you
[3367.20 - 3372.40] guys the reason why
[3369.36 - 3374.40] it's singles in here it's advanced
[3372.40 - 3376.88] information it's above the rest
[3374.40 - 3377.68] a you know what's wrong b you know what
[3376.88 - 3380.24] to take
[3377.68 - 3381.84] c when you take natalie for a condition
[3380.24 - 3382.64] because i'm looking at metal leaf right
[3381.84 - 3385.20] here
[3382.64 - 3386.40] um and what i'm looking at right now i'm
[3385.20 - 3388.88] looking at nettle leaf
[3386.40 - 3389.60] when you take nettle you're not taking a
[3388.88 - 3392.32] speck of
[3389.60 - 3393.28] nettle dust in something that has 20
[3392.32 - 3396.24] ingredients
[3393.28 - 3397.04] in a supplement form or 10 to 15 18
[3396.24 - 3398.64] ingredients
[3397.04 - 3400.72] and you're taking you see nettle in
[3398.64 - 3402.00] there you're not getting nettle
[3400.72 - 3404.72] you're not going to get better from
[3402.00 - 3406.16] nettle and it's a scam because
[3404.72 - 3407.76] what they do is they get these
[3406.16 - 3409.84] fulfillment centers and
[3407.76 - 3411.44] all the companies they'll have a great
[3409.84 - 3414.72] cool you know
[3411.44 - 3415.28] a great cool earthy um label on the
[3414.72 - 3417.36] bottle
[3415.28 - 3419.12] you'll see an influencer some guy
[3417.36 - 3421.28] influencer like yeah this is so
[3419.12 - 3423.28] synergistic works with your body
[3421.28 - 3424.48] of the highest ingredient source from
[3423.28 - 3426.16] the amazon
[3424.48 - 3427.60] they'll have all that but really it's
[3426.16 - 3430.64] from a fulfillment center
[3427.60 - 3432.32] that guy's just a bull crapper and you
[3430.64 - 3434.16] have 15 different things in there plus
[3432.32 - 3436.00] citric acid which is terrible
[3434.16 - 3437.28] and all this other stuff this is
[3436.00 - 3439.36] critical to healing
[3437.28 - 3440.80] this is what matters this is how
[3439.36 - 3443.60] everything like really
[3440.80 - 3446.56] really this is how it happens here so
[3443.60 - 3449.12] this is really important to know and
[3446.56 - 3450.64] so you'll see singles in here by the way
[3449.12 - 3452.16] if you just got on here cleanse the heel
[3450.64 - 3453.60] take advantage of that so
[3452.16 - 3455.44] you know there's so much to cover here
[3453.60 - 3456.52] but take advantage of cleanse the heel
[3455.44 - 3459.04] of being like
[3456.52 - 3460.32] 16.99 amazon but library go to the
[3459.04 - 3463.12] library if you want
[3460.32 - 3464.56] and because i can't cover it all here
[3463.12 - 3466.16] the reason why i keep on showing the
[3464.56 - 3468.56] book is what am i going to do
[3466.16 - 3470.32] um you guys not have the book and then
[3468.56 - 3473.04] not have all the information
[3470.32 - 3474.64] i can only show so much each live i'm
[3473.04 - 3476.64] trying to do as many as i can and do
[3474.64 - 3477.60] three lives a week or six lives a week
[3476.64 - 3479.68] really
[3477.60 - 3481.76] um to get guilty library and get it for
[3479.68 - 3483.60] free but it's critical to have the
[3481.76 - 3484.08] information in the book i mean what am i
[3483.60 - 3487.52] going to say
[3484.08 - 3490.56] so the whole thing here with singles
[3487.52 - 3494.40] for a reason is so critical
[3490.56 - 3498.00] when you take the lemon balm by itself
[3494.40 - 3500.72] or you drink the lemon balm tea
[3498.00 - 3502.72] by itself in a potent form like
[3500.72 - 3505.76] traditional medicinals
[3502.72 - 3509.04] i do both personally i do both and
[3505.76 - 3509.92] um when you do that it's not an herbal
[3509.04 - 3512.40] mix
[3509.92 - 3513.76] with a speck of dust and then and
[3512.40 - 3515.20] literally you get ripped off
[3513.76 - 3517.12] you look at your supplement that's what
[3515.20 - 3518.40] that's what would happen all the people
[3517.12 - 3519.84] i've seen over the years
[3518.40 - 3521.92] thousands of dollars of supplements in
[3519.84 - 3524.16] their cupboards all junk fillers
[3521.92 - 3525.20] everything everything all packed and all
[3524.16 - 3527.04] that in there
[3525.20 - 3528.16] and and people not getting better with
[3527.04 - 3529.52] all those different ingredients with
[3528.16 - 3531.04] speck of dust and everything
[3529.52 - 3532.88] so you can learn about supplements from
[3531.04 - 3533.84] my directory medicalmedia.com if you
[3532.88 - 3536.80] really want to know
[3533.84 - 3537.60] but the point is is it's it's making
[3536.80 - 3540.64] sure you don't get
[3537.60 - 3543.36] cheated making sure you don't get
[3540.64 - 3544.56] cheated it's critical to not get cheated
[3543.36 - 3546.88] so
[3544.56 - 3548.00] let's go into lyme disease because on
[3546.88 - 3550.56] instagram too
[3548.00 - 3552.40] i forgot i forgot that i didn't cover
[3550.56 - 3554.00] lyme disease i want to just cover for a
[3552.40 - 3556.00] couple seconds if you go into lyme
[3554.00 - 3561.04] disease in here
[3556.00 - 3561.04] um in uh cleanse the heel
[3566.88 - 3572.88] just trying to find it right here
[3570.40 - 3574.32] um do the owner of lyme disease i talk
[3572.88 - 3575.76] about the true cause of lyme disease
[3574.32 - 3577.28] which is critical to know you'll see
[3575.76 - 3578.72] that here so if you go in here you'll
[3577.28 - 3580.24] see lyme disease and you'll see a whole
[3578.72 - 3580.88] section on the true cause and you can
[3580.24 - 3585.36] read it
[3580.88 - 3585.36] right there okay and
[3585.84 - 3589.76] in lyme disease you'll see the
[3588.20 - 3591.44] supplementation
[3589.76 - 3594.40] right there okay you'll see the fresh
[3591.44 - 3598.48] celery juice the reason why that's there
[3594.40 - 3600.56] is because it's it's an herbal medicine
[3598.48 - 3602.96] so it's not like why is celery juice
[3600.56 - 3604.96] there you don't see other juices there
[3602.96 - 3607.04] you don't see other juices there you
[3604.96 - 3607.92] don't see a juice you don't see carrot
[3607.04 - 3610.40] juice in there
[3607.92 - 3611.92] that's not herbal medicine you don't see
[3610.40 - 3614.64] and because medical medium information
[3611.92 - 3616.56] is is the only place where we know
[3614.64 - 3618.72] what celery juice does because it's a
[3616.56 - 3620.80] herbal medicine so you'll see that there
[3618.72 - 3622.96] say work up to 32 ounces
[3620.80 - 3624.80] okay and then you go down the list
[3622.96 - 3627.92] you'll see 5 mt at
[3624.80 - 3628.72] 5 5 mdhf you'll see the folate right
[3627.92 - 3630.96] here
[3628.72 - 3633.44] you'll see um um when you go down the
[3630.96 - 3635.20] list you'll see the cat's claw in here
[3633.44 - 3636.72] okay and you might be somebody with lyme
[3635.20 - 3638.32] disease that's sensitive
[3636.72 - 3639.92] to see the cat's that's the vimergy
[3638.32 - 3642.64] cat's claw that's the best one
[3639.92 - 3643.68] out there hands down cat's claws don't
[3642.64 - 3646.32] work out there
[3643.68 - 3648.88] and you'll see curcumin you'll see
[3646.32 - 3650.32] glutathione you'll see lemon balm like i
[3648.88 - 3652.80] was talking about there
[3650.32 - 3654.88] now if you're sensitive if you're
[3652.80 - 3656.80] sensitive you just do a tiny drop
[3654.88 - 3658.32] use the technique i talked about use the
[3656.80 - 3660.88] whole sensitive technique
[3658.32 - 3661.36] you can take three tiny drops of cat's
[3660.88 - 3663.12] claw
[3661.36 - 3665.52] all right but you'll see the cat's claw
[3663.12 - 3666.40] dosage is three dropper volts twice a
[3665.52 - 3668.40] day
[3666.40 - 3669.44] you don't have to go the three dropper
[3668.40 - 3672.08] fulls twice a day
[3669.44 - 3673.04] you can be three tiny drops of cat's
[3672.08 - 3676.00] claw
[3673.04 - 3676.40] a day and you can work your way up you
[3676.00 - 3678.48] can
[3676.40 - 3679.68] customize your protocol you can talk to
[3678.48 - 3680.48] your doctor you can talk to your
[3679.68 - 3682.16] practitioner
[3680.48 - 3683.68] that's how incredible this is then
[3682.16 - 3686.00] you'll see the licorice root
[3683.68 - 3686.80] in in in lyme disease but why is that
[3686.00 - 3688.72] there
[3686.80 - 3690.32] why is that well first of all no one
[3688.72 - 3692.00] used cat's glove for lyme disease until
[3690.32 - 3692.96] medical medium information got out there
[3692.00 - 3694.96] years ago
[3692.96 - 3696.32] because cat's claw kills off viruses
[3694.96 - 3697.20] that cause lyme disease and you'll read
[3696.32 - 3700.08] about it
[3697.20 - 3701.68] knowing the true cause of your condition
[3700.08 - 3706.00] is how you recover
[3701.68 - 3708.32] then knowing what to do and what to use
[3706.00 - 3709.76] and how to do the cleanse there's the
[3708.32 - 3711.92] tools so you can just
[3709.76 - 3714.24] really get you there so then you'll see
[3711.92 - 3716.16] the lysine because it's antiviral you'll
[3714.24 - 3717.12] see the licorice root antiviral you see
[3716.16 - 3719.60] the mullen leaf
[3717.12 - 3720.48] and you go down here you'll see the raw
[3719.60 - 3722.48] honey
[3720.48 - 3723.92] that's another one you'll see the b12
[3722.48 - 3727.12] for the nervous system
[3723.92 - 3728.96] why b12 well nobody knew why medical
[3727.12 - 3730.80] medium information taught people for the
[3728.96 - 3734.08] central nervous system
[3730.80 - 3736.32] b12 is for the central nervous system
[3734.08 - 3738.48] because our central nervous systems get
[3736.32 - 3740.24] beaten down by viruses and pathogens
[3738.48 - 3742.00] from neurotoxins that's why we get the
[3740.24 - 3743.04] chronic fatigue syndrome the rheumatoid
[3742.00 - 3744.48] arthritis we get
[3743.04 - 3746.40] the lyme disease we get all these
[3744.48 - 3747.52] different conditions and we get the
[3746.40 - 3750.16] brain fog all that are
[3747.52 - 3750.64] we we get the colitis that's viral too
[3750.16 - 3754.80] so
[3750.64 - 3756.56] b12 is for nerves because of viruses
[3754.80 - 3757.84] then you see the vitamin c right there
[3756.56 - 3760.72] then you'll see the zinc
[3757.84 - 3762.16] you'll see a working lyme disease
[3760.72 - 3764.96] protocol
[3762.16 - 3765.52] that doesn't exist anywhere else i don't
[3764.96 - 3767.92] know how
[3765.52 - 3769.52] more i can hold somebody's hand here you
[3767.92 - 3771.28] can take this to your doctor and have
[3769.52 - 3772.96] them work with you on everything in here
[3771.28 - 3773.44] and maybe add to whatever they're doing
[3772.96 - 3776.08] too
[3773.44 - 3776.48] but the point is is that's what this
[3776.08 - 3778.56] book
[3776.48 - 3780.40] is designed for plus you could do you
[3778.56 - 3781.60] can do cleanses and not even go into the
[3780.40 - 3783.60] supplements
[3781.60 - 3784.88] but you have opportunities and choices
[3783.60 - 3786.80] to take it as far
[3784.88 - 3789.84] as you want to go so let's talk about
[3786.80 - 3789.84] children's dosages
[3790.80 - 3797.20] i want to go into that a little bit
[3792.56 - 3800.72] that's an important thing
[3797.20 - 3801.44] so i'm in cold and flu and cleanse the
[3800.72 - 3804.40] heel
[3801.44 - 3805.68] supplements and dosages right there if
[3804.40 - 3806.64] you don't have the book you might want
[3805.68 - 3810.64] to have the book
[3806.64 - 3813.84] um so
[3810.64 - 3816.08] cold and flu and
[3813.84 - 3816.88] in this section here have dosages so
[3816.08 - 3818.88] it'll say
[3816.88 - 3820.88] supplements for cold and flu for adults
[3818.88 - 3822.56] now why is he talking about cold and flu
[3820.88 - 3825.60] like who cares about cold and flu right
[3822.56 - 3828.72] now right we're gonna care
[3825.60 - 3830.40] we're gonna care because
[3828.72 - 3831.84] there's gonna be another virus still
[3830.40 - 3836.16] looming around
[3831.84 - 3839.04] at the same time flu comes rolling in
[3836.16 - 3839.84] and hammering in pretty rough because it
[3839.04 - 3842.64] does
[3839.84 - 3843.20] and so there's a lot to be concerned
[3842.64 - 3845.44] about
[3843.20 - 3847.52] children a lot to be concerned about
[3845.44 - 3851.20] babies lots to be concerned about
[3847.52 - 3854.72] adults too but that's why i put this in
[3851.20 - 3857.28] here what spirit of compassion foresaw
[3854.72 - 3859.04] was the virus hold the whole virus thing
[3857.28 - 3862.48] spirit of compassion forced all that
[3859.04 - 3864.48] i got 35 years of freaking out about
[3862.48 - 3867.68] viruses
[3864.48 - 3869.52] 35 years of freaking out about viruses
[3867.68 - 3870.96] to get people safe and get them
[3869.52 - 3872.80] recovered with all their conditions and
[3870.96 - 3876.08] symptoms including flu viruses or
[3872.80 - 3876.96] any other manufactured virus that hit
[3876.08 - 3879.76] some scene
[3876.96 - 3880.16] okay whatever all of it and that's the
[3879.76 - 3881.76] whole
[3880.16 - 3883.60] thing medical media information is about
[3881.76 - 3884.24] protecting people about protecting with
[3883.60 - 3886.64] the viral
[3884.24 - 3888.56] viral issues and all of that so when it
[3886.64 - 3891.20] comes down to it
[3888.56 - 3892.48] there's supplements for cold and flus
[3891.20 - 3894.16] for adults but for
[3892.48 - 3895.92] children which is critical because when
[3894.16 - 3897.92] flu season comes and you got
[3895.92 - 3899.04] you got the flu's pounding away in
[3897.92 - 3901.76] december
[3899.04 - 3903.04] and everything else and all that it's
[3901.76 - 3904.56] critical
[3903.04 - 3905.76] i want to talk about lyme disease back
[3904.56 - 3907.04] to lyme disease for one question because
[3905.76 - 3909.44] i saw something there
[3907.04 - 3910.48] lyme is not bacterial just want to cover
[3909.44 - 3912.64] that right there
[3910.48 - 3914.16] and you'll you'll know first of all
[3912.64 - 3915.76] medical medium information pushed lyme
[3914.16 - 3917.52] disease out of the bacterial category
[3915.76 - 3919.52] it's not even in that category anymore
[3917.52 - 3920.80] so lyme disease the lyme labs they don't
[3919.52 - 3923.20] want to lose their their
[3920.80 - 3924.88] billionaire their their empires so the
[3923.20 - 3926.00] lyme labs want to still say it's a
[3924.88 - 3927.36] bacterial because they don't want to
[3926.00 - 3931.12] lose their empires
[3927.36 - 3932.88] lyme labs have been bankrolling
[3931.12 - 3934.56] and they're not going to break that but
[3932.88 - 3936.24] science research
[3934.56 - 3937.60] took it out of the bacterial category
[3936.24 - 3939.36] and they put it in the autoimmune
[3937.60 - 3940.64] category that was because medical medium
[3939.36 - 3941.84] books millions of medical media books
[3940.64 - 3944.08] got around the world
[3941.84 - 3945.60] and people stopped thinking that lyme
[3944.08 - 3947.28] disease is bacterial anymore
[3945.60 - 3948.56] so people actually know it's viral
[3947.28 - 3949.84] because of the medical medium books if
[3948.56 - 3950.48] you're new to that get the books and
[3949.84 - 3952.00] learn
[3950.48 - 3953.68] and so that's why i was talking about
[3952.00 - 3954.96] that so anyway we'll go back to the cold
[3953.68 - 3957.68] and flu supplements
[3954.96 - 3958.24] so here it is supplements were cold and
[3957.68 - 3962.56] flu
[3958.24 - 3962.56] in children ages one to two
[3962.88 - 3969.20] all right supplements for colds and flu
[3966.72 - 3970.96] in children ages three to four with
[3969.20 - 3973.84] dosages and protocols
[3970.96 - 3974.56] dosages and protocols for instance
[3973.84 - 3977.04] supplements
[3974.56 - 3978.48] for cold and flu in children ages one to
[3977.04 - 3980.48] two it'll say
[3978.48 - 3981.92] elderberry syrup one teaspoon three
[3980.48 - 3985.52] times a day
[3981.92 - 3987.44] uh goldenseal four tiny drops
[3985.52 - 3988.96] not dropper falls three times a day
[3987.44 - 3989.92] you're saying the list goes on and on
[3988.96 - 3992.96] and on
[3989.92 - 3994.64] um and then um and
[3992.96 - 3996.32] and then you got what supplements were
[3994.64 - 3999.28] cold in flu in children from
[3996.32 - 4001.28] ages five to eight years old supplements
[3999.28 - 4004.64] for cold and flu in children
[4001.28 - 4007.52] ages nine through twelve supplements for
[4004.64 - 4010.08] colds and flus at ages 13 and up
[4007.52 - 4010.96] so you'll see that's here okay which is
[4010.08 - 4012.96] really uh
[4010.96 - 4014.32] which really powerful information take
[4012.96 - 4016.00] it to your pediatrician
[4014.32 - 4017.92] when cold and flu comes or whatever or
[4016.00 - 4018.84] or have your pediatrician have the book
[4017.92 - 4021.12] too
[4018.84 - 4022.16] so and you can take to your doctor
[4021.12 - 4024.32] pediatrician
[4022.16 - 4026.16] and um and ask them if it's okay for
[4024.32 - 4027.36] your child to have those amounts and
[4026.16 - 4028.96] these dosages
[4027.36 - 4031.20] so that's something that's in here as
[4028.96 - 4034.08] well which is really incredible
[4031.20 - 4035.84] um but the bottom line is it's it's all
[4034.08 - 4038.96] about
[4035.84 - 4039.20] so many options and i walk you through
[4038.96 - 4042.32] it
[4039.20 - 4044.56] to empower you empowerment
[4042.32 - 4045.92] is having an answer to why you're sick
[4044.56 - 4049.04] that's number one
[4045.92 - 4052.72] why am i sick because
[4049.04 - 4055.68] leaky gut is not an answer because
[4052.72 - 4056.56] leaky gut isn't even a real thing i know
[4055.68 - 4058.88] that's like
[4056.56 - 4060.24] hard for people to hear but if someone
[4058.88 - 4061.84] had a leaky gut they would be in the
[4060.24 - 4062.88] hospital with with the temperature of
[4061.84 - 4065.92] 105
[4062.88 - 4068.24] dying of sepsis see
[4065.92 - 4069.92] what happens is leaky gut isn't wall
[4068.24 - 4071.68] people isn't white people say people
[4069.92 - 4075.44] with diverticulitis
[4071.68 - 4078.32] that almost have like a hole in their in
[4075.44 - 4080.48] their colon going to the outside of
[4078.32 - 4083.76] their bloodstream
[4080.48 - 4084.08] they don't even they don't even suffer
[4083.76 - 4085.12] from
[4084.08 - 4087.68] like there's people that have
[4085.12 - 4089.20] diverticulitis with holes in their colon
[4087.68 - 4090.64] almost to the other side and they don't
[4089.20 - 4092.08] have symptoms people have they could
[4090.64 - 4093.28] diagnose a leaky gut
[4092.08 - 4095.28] so you have to understand it doesn't
[4093.28 - 4099.44] work that way if you even had a
[4095.28 - 4102.00] puncture even the sl a passageway
[4099.44 - 4103.36] you'd be like so sick it would be insane
[4102.00 - 4105.44] so i want to go into um
[4103.36 - 4106.72] so leaky gut is just a theory they have
[4105.44 - 4108.08] no proof there's never been a peer
[4106.72 - 4110.56] review study that actually
[4108.08 - 4112.00] showed it happening it's not seeable
[4110.56 - 4114.16] it's not visionable it's not
[4112.00 - 4115.52] known it's it's not even no it's there's
[4114.16 - 4116.40] no science research to back it up
[4115.52 - 4118.32] alternatively
[4116.40 - 4119.52] conventionally there's ammonia
[4118.32 - 4121.04] permeability
[4119.52 - 4122.40] so i talk about ammonia permeability
[4121.04 - 4123.04] that's different that's when you have so
[4122.40 - 4124.96] much stuff
[4123.04 - 4127.20] rotting that's impacted in your
[4124.96 - 4128.40] intestinal tract like rancid fats rancid
[4127.20 - 4129.60] proteins on the linings of the
[4128.40 - 4131.60] intestinal tract
[4129.60 - 4133.04] and it's creating ammonia gas and that
[4131.60 - 4134.40] ammonia gas will go through everything
[4133.04 - 4135.76] it'll go through your bones it goes up
[4134.40 - 4136.08] to your teeth and rot your teeth at
[4135.76 - 4137.52] night
[4136.08 - 4139.12] people are like well why am i losing
[4137.52 - 4141.12] teeth well all that stuff's been
[4139.12 - 4141.92] impacted in them for 30 years 20 years
[4141.12 - 4143.04] 15 years
[4141.92 - 4144.40] and their teeth start going that's
[4143.04 - 4147.44] ammonia permeability that's different
[4144.40 - 4150.40] let's go into aloe a little bit
[4147.44 - 4152.08] um and when teeth have problems it's not
[4150.40 - 4154.00] from what you're doing that day or that
[4152.08 - 4155.52] time period when teeth have problems
[4154.00 - 4157.44] they develop teeth problems
[4155.52 - 4159.12] that's from 10 years ago what were you
[4157.44 - 4160.80] doing 10 years ago
[4159.12 - 4162.56] what were you doing 15 years ago what
[4160.80 - 4164.48] were you doing did you come into this
[4162.56 - 4167.68] world mineral deficient
[4164.48 - 4170.08] you know lemon water does not hurt teeth
[4167.68 - 4171.76] um at all because people never did lemon
[4170.08 - 4173.12] water but everybody's in a dentist chair
[4171.76 - 4176.08] getting their teeth drilled
[4173.12 - 4177.76] what did you do in your life in the past
[4176.08 - 4179.36] was it deficiencies what kind of foods
[4177.76 - 4180.72] were you eating 10 years ago because our
[4179.36 - 4182.56] teeth problems don't develop in the
[4180.72 - 4184.56] moment from what we're doing right now
[4182.56 - 4187.20] our teeth problems develop from 10 years
[4184.56 - 4189.36] ago five years ago from eight years ago
[4187.20 - 4190.88] so and dentist chairs are filled with
[4189.36 - 4191.76] with people that are eating animal
[4190.88 - 4194.08] protein
[4191.76 - 4196.48] so it's not about plant protein it's
[4194.08 - 4197.76] it's filled with everybody and everybody
[4196.48 - 4199.52] so it's really important to know that so
[4197.76 - 4201.52] here's an aloe leaf right here
[4199.52 - 4202.88] um i talk about i'll leave protocols in
[4201.52 - 4203.68] cleanse to heal the symptoms and
[4202.88 - 4206.08] conditions area
[4203.68 - 4207.92] really important to know there's alola
[4206.08 - 4209.68] leaf so what i like to do is i cut off
[4207.92 - 4211.92] this end because it's extra bitter
[4209.68 - 4216.72] i mean i still dig a spoon in there but
[4211.92 - 4218.80] you know i cut off this end right here
[4216.72 - 4220.16] so i mean personally i dig a spoon in
[4218.80 - 4221.36] there and kind of dig
[4220.16 - 4222.80] that out but it's really bitter because
[4221.36 - 4224.24] it's right close to the plant because
[4222.80 - 4225.76] when they pluck the aloe
[4224.24 - 4227.76] they pluck it right off the plant and
[4225.76 - 4230.00] this part right here is really bitter
[4227.76 - 4231.52] that that's really bitter but so i cut
[4230.00 - 4232.72] it off for you guys i figured it's the
[4231.52 - 4235.20] best thing for you guys to
[4232.72 - 4236.16] you know to do too um you can eat the
[4235.20 - 4238.08] aloe
[4236.16 - 4239.44] and you can eat it straight i eat it
[4238.08 - 4240.80] straight okay even though i got the
[4239.44 - 4243.52] medical medium recipes where you can put
[4240.80 - 4245.36] it in a blender and blend it with water
[4243.52 - 4246.72] and drink it down because that's that's
[4245.36 - 4247.92] an amazing way to do it it's an
[4246.72 - 4249.36] incredible way to do it
[4247.92 - 4252.56] i've always talked about that for
[4249.36 - 4255.28] decades but i like to eat it straight
[4252.56 - 4256.88] it's quicker for me too you know and and
[4255.28 - 4258.00] so what i do is i cut off a section
[4256.88 - 4260.96] about so big
[4258.00 - 4260.96] just showing you right here
[4261.12 - 4266.40] i just cut off a section of the aloe
[4264.24 - 4268.00] um don't add to food don't don't add
[4266.40 - 4269.12] food in your blender with it or anything
[4268.00 - 4270.96] else you can
[4269.12 - 4272.80] you can you can put your aloe with what
[4270.96 - 4275.28] you're eating and blend it up of course
[4272.80 - 4275.92] you can you can do that i just like to
[4275.28 - 4277.68] do it
[4275.92 - 4279.28] alone because it's more potent as the
[4277.68 - 4280.40] medicine it does it brings down the
[4279.28 - 4283.44] acids
[4280.40 - 4284.80] um it gets to the digestive tract on its
[4283.44 - 4286.88] own by itself
[4284.80 - 4288.00] which i really love it's an herb i like
[4286.88 - 4291.36] like to take
[4288.00 - 4293.44] by itself is what it is a wild food i
[4291.36 - 4294.80] like to take by itself
[4293.44 - 4296.56] it's a wild food i like to take by
[4294.80 - 4298.72] itself and so
[4296.56 - 4300.00] um what i do is what i just did now i
[4298.72 - 4301.68] have it right here what i did just
[4300.00 - 4303.84] i took a knife right here and i cut it
[4301.68 - 4304.88] like this
[4303.84 - 4307.20] trying to show you in a different way
[4304.88 - 4309.36] here oh there you go
[4307.20 - 4310.56] okay and i open it up like that then i
[4309.36 - 4314.08] fillet it
[4310.56 - 4318.08] i hope i'm not going too fast this
[4314.08 - 4320.72] aloe in in um in supplementation
[4318.08 - 4322.40] i hate i hate aloe in supplementation i
[4320.72 - 4324.80] hate aloe and drinks
[4322.40 - 4325.44] meaning not not like making your own
[4324.80 - 4328.56] fresh
[4325.44 - 4329.92] aloe vera water i hate aloe in bottles
[4328.56 - 4331.12] with preservatives because they put
[4329.92 - 4333.36] preservatives in it
[4331.12 - 4334.88] it sits on the shelf in the health food
[4333.36 - 4336.40] store hey i'm going to grab a bottle of
[4334.88 - 4337.84] aloe if that's the only way you can do
[4336.40 - 4340.40] it and that's the only thing you can get
[4337.84 - 4342.00] you can try that but but i personally
[4340.40 - 4342.80] like trying to get a hold of a leaf if
[4342.00 - 4346.00] you can
[4342.80 - 4349.12] that's my favorite thing to do and um
[4346.00 - 4350.16] so i just laid it back like this i just
[4349.12 - 4351.28] did this
[4350.16 - 4354.24] just trying to show you guys i just
[4351.28 - 4357.84] played it played it back like that
[4354.24 - 4357.84] tripping everywhere right now so
[4358.40 - 4362.56] um and then i flayed this piece right
[4360.24 - 4362.56] here
[4368.00 - 4371.84] i'm going to flay it again
[4373.12 - 4377.68] so i just laid it again with the knife
[4376.16 - 4379.52] i'm probably not doing a great job in
[4377.68 - 4382.16] front of you guys
[4379.52 - 4382.16] as always
[4383.52 - 4388.08] what else do you expect right i'm always
[4385.20 - 4390.88] uh messing something up on here
[4388.08 - 4392.64] and then you i eat this i just put it in
[4390.88 - 4394.72] my mouth and just gobble it down right
[4392.64 - 4396.40] that's one side there just knocked it
[4394.72 - 4398.08] off so here's the other side
[4396.40 - 4401.12] and i just flay the other side like this
[4398.08 - 4401.12] i play the skin back
[4401.28 - 4408.00] try not to get it on the computer too
[4404.56 - 4413.84] the camera there you go
[4408.00 - 4413.84] i do that and i flay it
[4416.56 - 4423.04] and that's the next piece i take both
[4419.68 - 4423.04] off and i eat it just like that
[4423.20 - 4430.32] so that's right there
[4426.80 - 4431.60] and i'll eat it fresh once a day but
[4430.32 - 4433.12] the whole thing is it's great for
[4431.60 - 4434.64] digestive problems i like it for the
[4433.12 - 4437.12] mono eating person
[4434.64 - 4439.36] than in the model eating plan in here so
[4437.12 - 4441.60] when you get cleansed of heal
[4439.36 - 4443.84] um you'll see the mono eating diets in
[4441.60 - 4445.60] here um it's mono-eating
[4443.84 - 4447.60] cleanse and you can do that mono-eating
[4445.60 - 4448.56] cleanse for a long time gastroparesis is
[4447.60 - 4450.16] incredible for
[4448.56 - 4451.92] other different symptoms with your
[4450.16 - 4452.96] digestive tract all of it the mono
[4451.92 - 4456.40] eating cleansing here
[4452.96 - 4458.96] it's really great but what
[4456.40 - 4460.64] what i like those are like the aloe vera
[4458.96 - 4462.08] kind of mixed in there for people doing
[4460.64 - 4462.72] mono-eating people with digestive
[4462.08 - 4464.56] problems
[4462.72 - 4466.16] people with gut problems and gut issues
[4464.56 - 4468.32] i like having the aloe in there so it's
[4466.16 - 4470.72] something right there to think about
[4468.32 - 4471.60] and i mean overall i mean you guys
[4470.72 - 4473.36] cleanse a heel
[4471.60 - 4474.96] i mean check it out these are some of
[4473.36 - 4476.72] the supplement information i can cover
[4474.96 - 4480.88] today i'll do another one
[4476.72 - 4483.44] there's so much really to cover um
[4480.88 - 4484.96] the books on sale and go to
[4483.44 - 4486.64] medicalmeme.com to the supplement
[4484.96 - 4489.44] directory so you know
[4486.64 - 4490.40] like what is safe what is something that
[4489.44 - 4492.40] i would take
[4490.40 - 4493.52] because that's the whole point and of
[4492.40 - 4495.36] having that there
[4493.52 - 4497.04] because what happens in what people do
[4495.36 - 4498.16] is they end up just getting lost out
[4497.04 - 4499.44] there and then
[4498.16 - 4501.12] how do you get better when you're taking
[4499.44 - 4502.32] the wrong zinc you don't how do you get
[4501.12 - 4503.60] better when you're taking
[4502.32 - 4505.12] crella when you're supposed to be taking
[4503.60 - 4506.08] the right kind of spirulina how do you
[4505.12 - 4507.36] get better
[4506.08 - 4509.84] when you're doing too much nutritional
[4507.36 - 4511.52] yeast with all that msg you don't
[4509.84 - 4513.36] nutritional yeast alone
[4511.52 - 4515.36] can make or break somebody's healing it
[4513.36 - 4516.56] can make or break them healing crossing
[4515.36 - 4518.88] a finish line
[4516.56 - 4520.56] and when you really think about so many
[4518.88 - 4522.00] obstacles and so many problems that
[4520.56 - 4522.80] could get in the way that's why these
[4522.00 - 4524.64] books have
[4522.80 - 4526.16] people who actually are able to read
[4524.64 - 4529.20] these books focus
[4526.16 - 4530.80] and actually just really take it
[4529.20 - 4532.64] seriously and move forward with it or
[4530.80 - 4534.24] take it to the doctor that really
[4532.64 - 4535.84] cares about them and wants to help work
[4534.24 - 4536.96] with them the people who move forward
[4535.84 - 4539.92] they're the people who
[4536.96 - 4541.60] who do um it's not just like oh i tried
[4539.92 - 4543.76] celery juice for five days
[4541.60 - 4544.96] and you ended up doing an hpp one on the
[4543.76 - 4547.84] shelf of the of the
[4544.96 - 4548.24] health food store that was like high pr
[4547.84 - 4549.92] high
[4548.24 - 4551.28] pressure pasteurization and doesn't work

[4596.72 - 4600.24] them
[4598.00 - 4601.68] traditional medicinal's the best teas
[4600.24 - 4604.72] okay good question
[4601.68 - 4607.04] i like thorn that's thorin gaba
[4604.72 - 4608.16] the camera's so weird on here that's
[4607.04 - 4611.44] thorn gaba
[4608.16 - 4614.80] i'm just saying sets thorin 5m thf
[4611.44 - 4617.68] um once again vimergy vimergy has the
[4614.80 - 4618.56] um amazing products they got the the
[4617.68 - 4621.52] vegan
[4618.56 - 4622.56] epa dha but the best one there is that's
[4621.52 - 4625.28] vimorjee
[4622.56 - 4626.16] vimergy has the spirulina incredible
[4625.28 - 4629.20] stuff
[4626.16 - 4632.24] all of it um yeah
[4629.20 - 4632.96] so all of the whole thing is just
[4632.24 - 4634.48] because i like
[4632.96 - 4636.00] thorn doesn't mean i like all of their
[4634.48 - 4637.76] products that's not it at all so
[4636.00 - 4639.92] just know that i like their gaba and i
[4637.76 - 4642.40] like their 5mthf
[4639.92 - 4643.76] um i like their methylfolate but it
[4642.40 - 4645.52] doesn't mean i like all their products
[4643.76 - 4647.52] don't get confused at that
[4645.52 - 4649.12] check my directory so you know because
[4647.52 - 4650.24] my directory changes a lot at
[4649.12 - 4652.48] medicalmedium.com
[4650.24 - 4653.60] because if you go there you'll see that
[4652.48 - 4656.32] you know i might like
[4653.60 - 4657.76] one product from thorn or two products
[4656.32 - 4658.48] but i don't like the rest of them
[4657.76 - 4660.64] because of
[4658.48 - 4662.48] all kinds of different pitfalls they
[4660.64 - 4663.20] have in them it's the same thing with a
[4662.48 - 4664.80] lot of products
[4663.20 - 4667.12] vimergy i like all of their products
[4664.80 - 4668.80] because they're like exceptionally above
[4667.12 - 4670.88] board like vimergy that company right
[4668.80 - 4672.56] there visa and victor i am ergy
[4670.88 - 4674.48] they're exceptionally above board i like
[4672.56 - 4678.08] every product they come out with
[4674.48 - 4680.80] um they keep it so fair and so straight
[4678.08 - 4681.44] and it's really unbelievable what
[4680.80 - 4683.52] they've done
[4681.44 - 4684.64] it's the quality and everything about it
[4683.52 - 4686.16] you know here's the licorice from
[4684.64 - 4688.16] vimergy right here
[4686.16 - 4690.08] um but i like a few different companies
[4688.16 - 4690.40] i like a bunch of companies but i only
[4690.08 - 4691.84] like
[4690.40 - 4693.84] certain things from some of these
[4691.84 - 4695.60] companies because they blow it
[4693.84 - 4698.08] in so many other ways with other
[4695.60 - 4699.92] products they just blow it it's it's
[4698.08 - 4703.12] it's incredible how it works
[4699.92 - 4704.88] um alexandra says you're incredible

[4717.28 - 4721.28] they don't care about spending money on
[4720.32 - 4723.60] the product
[4721.28 - 4724.88] they'll spend money on the product when
[4723.60 - 4728.40] other companies won't

[4728.40 - 4732.32] individually tested for toxic heavy
[4730.08 - 4733.92] metals other companies don't
[4732.32 - 4735.04] because it costs too much money so you

[4735.04 - 4737.36] with when you're dealing with a really
