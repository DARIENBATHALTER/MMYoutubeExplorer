[1.96 - 6.00] oral health it's a big deal a lot of
[4.08 - 9.40] people have canker sores cold sores
[6.00 - 12.32] fever blisters mouth ulcers oh it's just
[9.40 - 13.96] a mouth ulcer that's all it is just a
[12.32 - 16.92] mouth ulcer you know it's like well
[13.96 - 19.68] what's a mouth ulcer what is
[16.92 - 21.24] that what's a mouth ulcer right and
[19.68 - 23.16] we'll talk about all this kind of stuff
[21.24 - 25.32] talking about immune system inside the
[23.16 - 28.28] mouth which is a big deal so your immune
[25.32 - 30.84] system in your mouth one of the most
[28.28 - 33.80] important places our immune system is
[30.84 - 35.60] when lymphocytes are freaking out every
[33.80 - 37.12] day in our mouths because they're trying
[35.60 - 39.36] to protect us they all this different
[37.12 - 41.84] stuff going in our mouths lymphocytes
[39.36 - 43.72] are always at it lymphatic glands
[41.84 - 46.20] underneath our neck right all these
[43.72 - 48.20] different areas here so this is really a
[46.20 - 51.12] uh an important topic because so many
[48.20 - 54.96] people have not just oral health issues
[51.12 - 57.60] but immune system issues in the area of
[54.96 - 60.04] their oral health because that's really
[57.60 - 61.44] a big problem right there so it's the
[60.04 - 66.04] immune
[61.44 - 68.04] system in the area where oral health is
[66.04 - 70.08] and they both work together okay we're
[68.04 - 73.52] going to talk about the whole stuff
[70.08 - 74.88] mouthwashes bad bad bad bad bad you
[73.52 - 77.20] don't want to use all those toxic
[74.88 - 79.56] mouthwashes out there I've been saying
[77.20 - 81.80] that for years because this stuff is
[79.56 - 84.12] terrible it's like putting gasoline in
[81.80 - 86.68] your mouth it's basically like just
[84.12 - 89.36] sucking gasoline from a gas tank out of
[86.68 - 90.52] a hose what you see here and then
[89.36 - 92.12] rinsing out your your mouth and then
[90.52 - 94.24] spitting it out that's what it is
[92.12 - 96.16] basically good to see you guys oral
[94.24 - 97.96] health we're talking about okay so this
[96.16 - 101.12] is a big deal this is a show that's
[97.96 - 104.32] important worth watching worth watching
[101.12 - 105.56] for free it's worth it so what you have
[104.32 - 106.96] in front of me right what I have in
[105.56 - 110.84] front of me and in front of you is
[106.96 - 114.48] golden seal golden seal I can't even
[110.84 - 117.36] express how important golden seal is
[114.48 - 120.44] golden seal shock therapy how critical
[117.36 - 122.48] that is I mean just life saving for
[120.44 - 125.28] people in so many ways what you also see
[122.48 - 125.28] in front of me is
[125.84 - 131.16] propolis
[127.60 - 132.92] propolis yeah yeah the heavens open up
[131.16 - 138.64] light comes out of the
[132.92 - 144.32] sky because propolis is literally
[138.64 - 146.08] literally like so powerful so powerful
[144.32 - 148.96] okay so propolis is in front of me right
[146.08 - 151.88] there too oral health propolis oral
[148.96 - 153.60] health propolis oral health propolis and
[151.88 - 155.24] then another thing you see is good
[153.60 - 158.24] oldfashioned
[155.24 - 160.28] zinc good oldfashioned zinc that's fmer
[158.24 - 162.60] G products right there you guys know I
[160.28 - 166.56] love those guys I endorse them
[162.60 - 169.24] wholeheartedly because they never ever
[166.56 - 170.84] did crazy crap to their supplements
[169.24 - 173.56] added all kinds of garbage natural
[170.84 - 175.84] flavors alcohol citric acid that's just
[173.56 - 178.04] the name a few that's not even like so
[175.84 - 182.28] many other things that are in in
[178.04 - 185.68] supplements out there you yeah magnesium
[182.28 - 188.16] sterate soy whatever I mean just all
[185.68 - 189.48] that garbage right they don't do that so
[188.16 - 192.72] that's the vimergy stuff right there if
[189.48 - 195.52] you haven't experienced the vimergy
[192.72 - 196.60] propolis I don't know what to say I
[195.52 - 199.60] could I
[196.60 - 202.00] could golden ticket smack it out of my
[199.60 - 205.00] hand golden ticket smack it out of my
[202.00 - 207.60] hand kick it out of my hand kick me in
[205.00 - 210.08] the face okay I'm just saying that
[207.60 - 211.88] propolis if you don't have it and you
[210.08 - 214.56] haven't experienced it I don't know what
[211.88 - 216.24] more I can say I barely talk about it I
[214.56 - 217.88] talk about it what once every 6 months
[216.24 - 219.68] don't hold me exactly to that time
[217.88 - 223.20] period because I really can't
[219.68 - 225.28] remember exactly what day it was but
[223.20 - 226.80] yeah I it's that important so what you
[225.28 - 229.44] see right here is the zinc you see the
[226.80 - 234.12] zinc right you see the propolis you see
[229.44 - 236.72] the golden seal hint hint hint hint
[234.12 - 238.56] immune system how critical that is
[236.72 - 241.00] especially with everything going around
[238.56 - 243.84] everything going around right right and
[241.00 - 246.84] if you're on the dating scene if you're
[243.84 - 248.44] on the dating scene
[246.84 - 252.00] okay
[248.44 - 255.92] propolis golden seal like say no more
[252.00 - 258.36] say no more and zinc if you're smooching
[255.92 - 261.24] with somebody you don't even really know
[258.36 - 262.92] that much you're on the dating scene and
[261.24 - 264.60] you're you're smooching in the car after
[262.92 - 269.20] a dinner or whatever it
[264.60 - 270.76] is and you propolis you get home and do
[269.20 - 272.64] the propol
[270.76 - 274.48] you get home and you do the zinc you get
[272.64 - 278.08] home and you do the golden
[274.48 - 280.24] seal you do that you fortify your immune
[278.08 - 282.12] system in areas that are
[280.24 - 285.32] critical that are
[282.12 - 288.24] critical seriously important
[285.32 - 292.96] areas
[288.24 - 294.44] so um yeah yeah if you're swapping Spit
[292.96 - 298.48] with
[294.44 - 299.80] someone yeah definitely need that okay
[298.48 - 301.52] all right all right all right I'm just
[299.80 - 304.68] excited because we're talking about the
[301.52 - 307.96] immune system I'm excited because we're
[304.68 - 310.60] talking about oral health it it's a
[307.96 - 313.24] favorite topic of mine I love talking
[310.60 - 315.20] about it because when you get people
[313.24 - 317.00] help when you actually get them real
[315.20 - 319.08] help where they where they can do
[317.00 - 323.08] something that's really beneficial not
[319.08 - 325.60] just [ __ ] coconut oil you know oil
[323.08 - 329.52] pulling I'm sorry I hope I just didn't
[325.60 - 331.80] make 10 more enemies you know I mean I'm
[329.52 - 333.88] the original enemy maker in the health
[331.80 - 335.84] movement because I told people about the
[333.88 - 337.68] collagen bull crap I told them about the
[335.84 - 341.36] oil pulling I told them about the lectin
[337.68 - 343.44] scam so I'm the original enemy maker
[341.36 - 346.04] before people now or like shot and all
[343.44 - 347.44] like blah blah blah blah blah blah in
[346.04 - 348.76] the health you know in the health world
[347.44 - 352.92] right now screaming their heads off
[348.76 - 355.00] about every little thing right but what
[352.92 - 356.52] happened was earlier on you know I I
[355.00 - 358.36] don't think I made that many friends
[356.52 - 360.52] when you're ripping apart collagen
[358.36 - 362.12] supplements fish oil supplements and
[360.52 - 364.52] you're ripping apart all that garbage
[362.12 - 366.40] and all that junk you just don't make a
[364.52 - 368.52] lot of friends
[366.40 - 371.48] anyway the point I'm trying to say is
[368.52 - 374.36] oil pulling does not do anything for the
[371.48 - 376.48] mouth's immune system it doesn't it may
[374.36 - 378.48] make your mouth feel a little slippery
[376.48 - 380.32] your teeth feel a little slippery you
[378.48 - 382.44] know it might feel good rubbing your
[380.32 - 385.52] your tongue across your teeth your front
[382.44 - 388.80] teeth and be like w oil pulling but it
[385.52 - 390.60] can't hold a candle a candle to
[388.80 - 391.80] something like prop especially the right
[390.60 - 394.12] kind of propolis because there's
[391.80 - 395.72] propolis with alcohol this propolis
[394.12 - 397.12] doesn't have alcohol in it you can find
[395.72 - 399.64] propolis out there it'll say alcohol
[397.12 - 401.60] free but there's still alcohol in it
[399.64 - 404.24] they're allowed to do that because they
[401.60 - 406.76] keep it down a little bit right you the
[404.24 - 408.88] Mars info I know I know it blew my mind
[406.76 - 411.72] blew my mind asking Spirit of
[408.88 - 415.52] compassion but what happens is the oil
[411.72 - 418.68] pulling isn't effective the mouthwashes
[415.52 - 420.92] aren't effective either and a lot of the
[418.68 - 422.32] mouthwashes that the natural ones there
[420.92 - 424.24] there's all kinds of crap in there and
[422.32 - 426.36] they're not effective for immune system
[424.24 - 429.76] health for your oral
[426.36 - 432.48] needs but propolis is one of those
[429.76 - 433.56] miracles on the planet and when it's
[432.48 - 436.80] done
[433.56 - 439.68] right it's done right and that's the
[436.80 - 441.48] difference right so the pure propolis
[439.68 - 443.04] right there is is a whole another level
[441.48 - 445.88] it's just so incredible so that's it
[443.04 - 447.20] right there the vimergy one but so let's
[445.88 - 449.00] go into propus a little bit let's go
[447.20 - 450.28] into oral health like what's going on in
[449.00 - 452.12] people's mouth
[450.28 - 454.20] you got the herp simplex one you got the
[452.12 - 457.92] cold sorce you got herp Simplex
[454.20 - 460.56] 2 yeah herp simplex one herp Simplex too
[457.92 - 461.88] in people's mouths some people got two
[460.56 - 463.16] varieties of cold sores they'll have a
[461.88 - 464.28] fever blister that looks a little
[463.16 - 466.68] different does something a little
[464.28 - 469.24] different and then they'll have like
[466.68 - 471.48] cold sores on the outside of their
[469.24 - 472.52] mouth then they'll have cold sores in
[471.48 - 475.52] their
[472.52 - 478.60] nose fever blisters in their nose it's a
[475.52 - 482.28] herpes simplex one or two and the key is
[478.60 - 483.20] immune system for battling that that's a
[482.28 - 486.48] big
[483.20 - 488.12] deal immune system so if you guys just
[486.48 - 491.36] got on here we're doing a little oral
[488.12 - 493.12] health talk which is so needed for
[491.36 - 495.96] people I don't want to forget about it
[493.12 - 498.08] time goes by a lot happens there's a lot
[495.96 - 500.72] going on I'm releasing a book pretty
[498.08 - 503.56] pretty soon there's there's a lot of
[500.72 - 506.24] things going on and but I just you know
[503.56 - 508.36] I just have to make sure I'm a
[506.24 - 510.20] reminder about what this can do and
[508.36 - 512.12] about what propolis can do and golden
[510.20 - 514.48] seal and zinc and how important these
[512.12 - 517.24] things are so we're here we're live
[514.48 - 521.88] right now okay so let's cut into it
[517.24 - 524.56] right here okay so gums that recede
[521.88 - 526.44] because bacteria that's not good is
[524.56 - 528.84] working on them and trying to break them
[526.44 - 530.76] down and try to eat away at them so
[528.84 - 533.08] that's one thing that happens receding
[530.76 - 535.60] gums they get real thin they start to
[533.08 - 537.68] break down they start to right they
[535.60 - 540.76] start to Decay one of the reasons why
[537.68 - 543.88] for receding gums one of the
[540.76 - 545.56] reasons is people have a lot of metals
[543.88 - 547.00] in their system they got mercury in
[545.56 - 548.88] their system they got mercury in their
[547.00 - 550.52] gums that's sitting in there they got
[548.88 - 552.72] mercury in their
[550.52 - 556.24] tongue people have mercury in their
[552.72 - 558.80] tongue yeah they do like if people's
[556.24 - 562.76] tongues were dissected if people's
[558.80 - 564.36] tongues were when when someone dies and
[562.76 - 565.88] if they did this thing where they remove
[564.36 - 567.44] the tongue instead of cut instead of
[565.88 - 568.76] cutting open the brain and and
[567.44 - 569.88] pretending they actually are looking
[568.76 - 572.68] inside somebody's
[569.88 - 574.32] brain which which really they don't
[572.68 - 577.00] terrible I mean they they slice the
[574.32 - 579.16] brains when they do the experiments
[577.00 - 581.84] right when someone donates their brain
[579.16 - 584.12] to science or science buys it without
[581.84 - 586.44] them knowing did you hear about that
[584.12 - 588.96] lately did you hear about that because
[586.44 - 590.68] I've heard about it for decades where
[588.96 - 594.20] people and don't know it but their
[590.68 - 597.52] bodies get sold off if they say it's by
[594.20 - 600.40] accident their bodies get sold off yeah
[597.52 - 605.52] like they'll sell a torso
[600.40 - 607.72] of a girl for $600 they'll sell a head
[605.52 - 610.96] yeah a head for
[607.72 - 615.16] $300 they'll sell two legs for
[610.96 - 617.44] like a $100 a piece $50 a piece to
[615.16 - 619.40] science I mean I don't I don't know
[617.44 - 620.68] anything more deranged I don't there's a
[619.40 - 622.92] lot of reasons why that's totally
[620.68 - 625.68] deranged but it's true and it happens
[622.92 - 626.72] it's happening every day just just you
[625.68 - 630.28] know
[626.72 - 633.96] we're let's bring it back bring it back
[630.28 - 636.72] to to oral health please yeah so what
[633.96 - 639.12] happens is that when they slice a brain
[636.72 - 642.60] okay they they slice it open like you
[639.12 - 644.88] know when you put a um you go to the
[642.60 - 648.48] deli and they
[644.88 - 650.04] put a big slab of you know some cold
[648.48 - 651.96] cuts right and you get cold cuts at a
[650.04 - 653.84] deli and they're slicing it can I have
[651.96 - 656.44] that slice thin please and they set the
[653.84 - 657.84] cutter they set the cutter some like 0
[656.44 - 660.88] 10 or something like that and they slice
[657.84 - 662.32] it thin well they do that with brains
[660.88 - 663.88] and they start looking for stuff they
[662.32 - 667.00] start taking a look at things what they
[663.88 - 669.36] really need to to do is they need to
[667.00 - 671.08] take tongues and they need to do that
[669.36 - 673.24] with tongues they need to actually test
[671.08 - 676.56] what's in tongues tongues get really
[673.24 - 681.68] really toxic really dirty and really
[676.56 - 684.88] toxic that's why eating tongue like beef
[681.68 - 686.60] tongue is ridiculously stupid eating
[684.88 - 688.12] beef tongue unless it's all you have
[686.60 - 690.36] it's if it's all you have and you live
[688.12 - 692.72] in some country somewhere and you're
[690.36 - 695.96] like you're really dead poor and it's
[692.72 - 697.88] either that or eating dirt then yeah
[695.96 - 699.96] then I completely understand you eat a
[697.88 - 702.84] beef tongue you eat a cow tongue I
[699.96 - 704.96] understand I am not shaming anybody or
[702.84 - 707.32] saying don't you know don't ever do that
[704.96 - 709.40] or anything like that I'm just saying if
[707.32 - 711.64] you have the ability not to do that if
[709.40 - 714.68] you have access to some resources and
[711.64 - 716.64] access to some food don't eat a beef
[714.68 - 719.84] tongue a cow
[716.64 - 722.40] tongue don't highly talk toxic highly
[719.84 - 724.76] filled with you toxic heavy metals you
[722.40 - 727.36] got to watch out with organ Meats organ
[724.76 - 729.80] meats are the worst if you're an animal
[727.36 - 733.32] protein person stick with the regular
[729.80 - 735.20] animal protein stick with that I'm just
[733.32 - 737.08] saying if you're an an I support you if
[735.20 - 738.36] you're an animal protein person I
[737.08 - 740.52] support you if you're eating all these
[738.36 - 742.64] toxic organs too of course I support you
[740.52 - 744.64] because I just I just want to offer
[742.64 - 746.36] whatever I can to add to whatever you're
[744.64 - 750.56] doing even if you're doing something
[746.36 - 755.48] wrong yeah sorry
[750.56 - 758.12] wrong but the organ meets are oh my God
[755.48 - 760.60] the trend is insane talking about
[758.12 - 762.84] getting somebody so toxic so fast in
[760.60 - 765.44] their life if you're somebody and you're
[762.84 - 767.28] starting out Young on organ meets like
[765.44 - 769.04] you're starting out at 15 years old or
[767.28 - 771.28] something or 14 years old and your
[769.04 - 774.16] family's feeding you organ meats and
[771.28 - 777.96] you're starting out that young oh dear
[774.16 - 780.24] lord nobody knows nobody knows and then
[777.96 - 783.12] 10 years go by 15 years go by the
[780.24 - 785.00] toxicity level in a child that turns
[783.12 - 787.76] into a young adult that turns into an
[785.00 - 790.36] older adult the toxicity level is so off
[787.76 - 792.44] the chart compared to um if you're going
[790.36 - 795.36] to have grass bed beef from a certain
[792.44 - 799.64] cut you know what I mean muscle from a
[795.36 - 801.92] certain cut right versus if you eat beef
[799.64 - 803.52] Hearts I mean for Animals it's different
[801.92 - 805.08] you need want to feed your dog grass fed
[803.52 - 808.24] beef Hearts you know it's it's different
[805.08 - 810.80] but but it for humans to be eating all
[808.24 - 813.00] the beef hearts and beef liver oh my God
[810.80 - 816.72] and cow liver and cow tongue and cow
[813.00 - 818.76] heart cow what a freaking nightmare to
[816.72 - 820.88] the body and they don't even know nobody
[818.76 - 822.84] even knows they don't even have a clue
[820.88 - 825.08] the organ meat thing is utterly
[822.84 - 826.44] ridiculous I'm not trying to be a jerk
[825.08 - 828.88] or anything that's not what I'm trying
[826.44 - 831.16] to do I'm just trying to be the voice of
[828.88 - 833.28] reason the voice of reason you know
[831.16 - 834.96] Advanced information I know Trends take
[833.28 - 835.96] people down all kinds of rabbit holes
[834.96 - 837.44] and then they're doing it they're
[835.96 - 839.40] getting clicks and likes and they're
[837.44 - 840.80] getting all this play out there and
[839.40 - 842.08] they're they're like you know moving and
[840.80 - 844.04] grooving and then they're they're
[842.08 - 846.24] pushing all their organs organ meat
[844.04 - 848.72] stuff and whatever it is I get it I get
[846.24 - 852.76] it
[848.72 - 857.44] but never never never
[852.76 - 860.88] never would I eat beef liver never great
[857.44 - 860.88] way to intoxification
[869.16 - 873.20] right it's in grass-fed beef it's in
[870.92 - 874.56] small small mounts but it's in there
[873.20 - 876.16] it's it's in everything it's in
[874.56 - 878.00] everything this isn't an anti-animal
[876.16 - 879.76] talk that's not it if your animal
[878.00 - 881.72] protein stick with the regular animal
[879.76 - 884.68] proteins meaning grass-fed or something
[881.72 - 887.04] really good you know if you raise your
[884.68 - 890.04] own cows whatever and just the point is
[887.04 - 891.56] stick with with the regular thing and
[890.04 - 894.12] I'm saying this
[891.56 - 898.24] because you start eating tongues and
[894.12 - 899.64] livers and hearts and other organs too
[898.24 - 902.08] you spleen what whatever you start
[899.64 - 904.52] eating these and you're going to just
[902.08 - 907.00] intoxicate yourself at a rapid Pace at a
[904.52 - 910.12] Mach one level so we're back to oral
[907.00 - 913.00] health I apolog my apologies truly and
[910.12 - 914.76] this isn't an anti-animal protein thing
[913.00 - 916.20] at all and it's not an anti- plant-based
[914.76 - 919.52] thing too I say a lot of things about
[916.20 - 921.68] the plant-based eaters and the vegan the
[919.52 - 923.76] vegan eaters and stuff like that because
[921.68 - 925.76] they do things wrong and they they don't
[923.76 - 928.00] know it but they're intoxicating
[925.76 - 931.76] themselves and that's just it that's
[928.00 - 935.16] even a word intoxic ating okay let's go
[931.76 - 938.76] into oral health a little bit so tongues
[935.16 - 941.04] are toxic they are and it's hard on our
[938.76 - 943.44] immune system when we have these toxic
[941.04 - 946.56] tongues very hard on our immune system
[943.44 - 950.36] in our mouth in our mouth area lymphatic
[946.56 - 953.12] vessels lymphatic system the whole bit
[950.36 - 956.60] there's a tongue right here um they take
[953.12 - 958.36] a look right there there's a tongue you
[956.60 - 960.04] see it's right underneath the eyeball I
[958.36 - 961.60] don't know if you could see that on IG
[960.04 - 965.36] how about on Tik Tok you guys see that
[961.60 - 968.44] on there so there's a tongue okay our
[965.36 - 972.12] immune system is guarding our tongue we
[968.44 - 975.20] have a lot of immune cells in our tongue
[972.12 - 976.96] and there's a reason for that tongues
[975.20 - 979.44] get attacked tongues get a lot of
[976.96 - 981.32] cancers tongues get a lot of different
[979.44 - 984.40] herpes viruses tongues get different
[981.32 - 986.92] kinds of bacteria you know infested in
[984.40 - 988.92] them so it's a big part of how our
[986.92 - 992.08] immune system is always like under a
[988.92 - 996.24] battle under a war in a war it's a big
[992.08 - 999.28] part of it tongue gets toxic okay for
[996.24 - 1002.56] multitudes of reasons one is it's highly
[999.28 - 1005.00] absorbent things we put in our mouth can
[1002.56 - 1007.92] go into a
[1005.00 - 1008.60] tongue faster than they stick around in
[1007.92 - 1011.68] the
[1008.60 - 1014.44] bowel that's right faster than they
[1011.68 - 1017.00] stick around in the bow you ready for
[1014.44 - 1018.64] this too something can absorb in the
[1017.00 - 1020.00] tongue that's toxic that you're eating
[1018.64 - 1022.36] or something like that say you're eating
[1020.00 - 1024.44] some tuna then you're doing like the
[1022.36 - 1026.04] Mercury thing you're eating tuna tuna I
[1024.44 - 1027.52] I got a friend that says I'm I'm eating
[1026.04 - 1029.68] this wild cot tuna I said really you
[1027.52 - 1029.68] like
[1030.72 - 1035.24] Mercury
[1033.04 - 1037.28] so what happens is say you're eating
[1035.24 - 1038.96] that tuna right well your tongue will
[1037.28 - 1043.12] absorb the Mercury
[1038.96 - 1045.12] first uh-huh uh-huh it will it will
[1043.12 - 1049.12] absorb the Mercury
[1045.12 - 1050.96] first before guess what your liver and
[1049.12 - 1052.96] your liver is going to absorb it next it
[1050.96 - 1054.84] is it's going to go down in this the
[1052.96 - 1057.56] stomach and down in the dadum down the
[1054.84 - 1060.16] small intestinal tract down in the guts
[1057.56 - 1061.92] it is and then it's going to be absorbed
[1060.16 - 1064.44] it's going to go up the hepatic portal
[1061.92 - 1065.64] Highway into the liver into your liver
[1064.44 - 1067.36] right your liver is just going to suck
[1065.64 - 1070.04] it up and absorb it up whatever it is
[1067.36 - 1072.68] and take it all in but your tongue had
[1070.04 - 1074.84] first divs first
[1072.68 - 1077.60] divs another thing interesting your
[1074.84 - 1080.72] tongue has to have a lot of blood it has
[1077.60 - 1084.24] to have a lot of blood flow lots of
[1080.72 - 1086.36] blood flow you guys Lots because it has
[1084.24 - 1089.40] lots of it has it has that hyper blood
[1086.36 - 1091.32] flow in your tongue somebody gets their
[1089.40 - 1093.20] tongue
[1091.32 - 1094.64] pierced I mean there's nothing wrong
[1093.20 - 1097.48] with that and someone wants to do that
[1094.64 - 1099.16] it's up to whoever wants to do that but
[1097.48 - 1101.40] it's a shock to the tongue because the
[1099.16 - 1104.76] immune system needs the tongue just kind
[1101.40 - 1107.12] of left alone and you know doing what it
[1104.76 - 1109.20] needs to do you know I had another
[1107.12 - 1111.80] friend who had their tongue pierced many
[1109.20 - 1113.56] years ago and I told them you should
[1111.80 - 1117.08] take that piercing out and just let it
[1113.56 - 1118.68] heal just let it heal you know but if to
[1117.08 - 1121.36] each to each their own people do what
[1118.68 - 1124.64] they want to do I mean I'm not judging
[1121.36 - 1126.76] anybody it is what it is but the
[1124.64 - 1128.32] tongue is
[1126.76 - 1131.76] inherently
[1128.32 - 1132.76] vascular it just is so what that means
[1131.76 - 1134.64] is it
[1132.76 - 1137.44] pulls
[1134.64 - 1139.72] pulls what that word is it means that
[1137.44 - 1141.20] the blood pulls there does it pulls
[1139.72 - 1143.96] there a lot and then it drops off a lot
[1141.20 - 1145.76] of toxins our tongues get toxic our
[1143.96 - 1148.56] tongues get toxic just like our livers
[1145.76 - 1151.16] get toxic they just get toxic so not
[1148.56 - 1153.56] only do tongues absorb when you eat
[1151.16 - 1155.88] something so if you're eating like uh
[1153.56 - 1158.08] tuna fish and the Mercury will go into
[1155.88 - 1159.20] your tongue it'll actually enter it and
[1158.08 - 1162.00] stay in
[1159.20 - 1164.20] there but here's the other thing you
[1162.00 - 1166.40] think the tongue is
[1164.20 - 1168.92] vascular
[1166.40 - 1170.64] hypervascular what about the heart
[1168.92 - 1172.48] that's why I tell people you're into all
[1170.64 - 1177.16] kinds of like organ meats and stuff like
[1172.48 - 1179.60] that do not eat Hearts they're so toxic
[1177.16 - 1182.64] so toxic because they're so
[1179.60 - 1185.20] vascular and and the toxins pull there
[1182.64 - 1186.56] you know this really a rough one I mean
[1185.20 - 1188.32] you know people don't know but again
[1186.56 - 1189.92] it's all about the trends Trends Trends
[1188.32 - 1191.44] not about really people healing in the
[1189.92 - 1193.08] end it's about the trends and then when
[1191.44 - 1195.48] the trends don't really work or they die
[1193.08 - 1199.12] out or they shift then it's on to a new
[1195.48 - 1202.00] trend but it's not about people healing
[1199.12 - 1205.84] it's sad it's
[1202.00 - 1208.28] sad Lena what about dental fillings same
[1205.84 - 1210.84] as with tuna of course if you got the
[1208.28 - 1212.56] mums if you got the the silver fillings
[1210.84 - 1214.08] and stuff if you had the silver fillings
[1212.56 - 1216.28] yeah I mean absorbs into the tongue
[1214.08 - 1218.08] absolutely our tongues get toxic it
[1216.28 - 1220.80] absorbs things and then our immune
[1218.08 - 1223.12] system gets compromised in our mouths
[1220.80 - 1227.52] but our immune systems get compromised
[1223.12 - 1230.44] in everybody's mouth it's also why the
[1227.52 - 1234.56] herpes viruses are so Vigilant they're
[1230.44 - 1237.16] so so hyper
[1234.56 - 1238.56] catchy that some people catch them boom
[1237.16 - 1241.20] they got it some people it takes two
[1238.56 - 1243.60] years right you're smooching with
[1241.20 - 1245.80] someone whatever and you're on the
[1243.60 - 1247.64] dating scene and then everything seems
[1245.80 - 1250.08] okay you don't have anything nothing's
[1247.64 - 1252.08] happening whatever next thing you know
[1250.08 - 1254.12] it you know two years later you break
[1252.08 - 1255.68] out with your first cold sore you're at
[1254.12 - 1257.72] the doctor that's a cold sore that's a
[1255.68 - 1259.80] fever blister came from the date two
[1257.72 - 1262.12] years ago it just happens right depends
[1259.80 - 1263.60] on your immune system too sometimes and
[1262.12 - 1265.52] it depends on what kind of varieties of
[1263.60 - 1267.20] bugs we're talking about now if you guys
[1265.52 - 1269.72] came on here we're talking about the
[1267.20 - 1271.24] propolis we're talking about the zinc
[1269.72 - 1273.36] we're talking about especially the
[1271.24 - 1276.92] propolis too oh my God I can't talk
[1273.36 - 1279.24] enough about it and the golden
[1276.92 - 1281.04] seal we're talking about
[1279.24 - 1285.36] those there's a lot of different
[1281.04 - 1286.60] varieties of HH you know hvs1 herpy
[1285.36 - 1288.88] simplex
[1286.60 - 1292.48] one lots of different varieties of
[1288.88 - 1294.92] Herpes Simplex 2 and people get them in
[1292.48 - 1296.68] their mouth first and they get them
[1294.92 - 1299.84] there
[1296.68 - 1302.60] and they battle this and it comes
[1299.84 - 1304.72] out some people get two or three you
[1302.60 - 1306.12] know over time just because you got
[1304.72 - 1308.20] fever blisters doesn't mean you're not
[1306.12 - 1310.00] going to catch another fever blister
[1308.20 - 1312.12] that's the other thing too just because
[1310.00 - 1313.40] you caught one six years ago doesn't
[1312.12 - 1314.76] mean you're not going to catch another
[1313.40 - 1317.24] from somebody else and it's a different
[1314.76 - 1319.56] variety so now you got two one pops up
[1317.24 - 1321.12] this month one pops up that month one
[1319.56 - 1323.96] pops up this month you really don't know
[1321.12 - 1326.60] the difference one pops up another month
[1323.96 - 1329.56] that's why like oral health is critical
[1326.60 - 1332.72] oral immune system health is
[1329.56 - 1335.20] critical I'm not on here right now to
[1332.72 - 1338.52] have some fun I got a lot going on it's
[1335.20 - 1340.76] just that I feel a
[1338.52 - 1343.04] responsibility
[1340.76 - 1344.52] so let's talk about oral health a little
[1343.04 - 1346.88] bit more when it comes down to immune
[1344.52 - 1349.12] system so lymphatic
[1346.88 - 1351.64] vessels lymphatic
[1349.12 - 1354.52] lands down there in the neck that's a
[1351.64 - 1358.80] hot spot that is such a hot spot right
[1354.52 - 1360.88] there the neck the glands lymphatic
[1358.80 - 1363.40] glands all around the neck back of the
[1360.88 - 1365.12] neck bottom of the you know the base of
[1363.40 - 1369.24] the
[1365.12 - 1371.00] head your throat all of it and then we
[1369.24 - 1372.88] got our tonsils too so we got our
[1371.00 - 1374.84] tonsils if you still have them if you
[1372.88 - 1376.12] still have your tonsils but I get it a
[1374.84 - 1378.04] lot of people still don't have their
[1376.12 - 1379.32] tonsils they lost their tonsils a long
[1378.04 - 1381.48] time ago
[1379.32 - 1383.44] because of immune system challenges they
[1381.48 - 1384.76] had chronic strep and maybe didn't even
[1383.44 - 1386.16] know they had chronic strep maybe they
[1384.76 - 1387.20] were diagnosed with strep throat one
[1386.16 - 1390.48] time but they didn't know they had
[1387.20 - 1393.92] chronic strep for so long
[1390.48 - 1395.92] um tonsilitis tonsils being inflamed
[1393.92 - 1398.60] tonsils being swollen all this matters
[1395.92 - 1400.32] with oral health with gums and teeth
[1398.60 - 1403.40] gums and
[1400.32 - 1406.56] teeth and tongues a lot of people have M
[1403.40 - 1408.80] mouth ulcers they have them on their
[1406.56 - 1410.72] tongue they get canker swords on their
[1408.80 - 1412.44] tongue and they hurt like heck and they
[1410.72 - 1414.20] bite their teeth into it they're like
[1412.44 - 1416.12] trying to bite them like and they're
[1414.20 - 1418.32] biting them a lot of people do that
[1416.12 - 1421.56] they're biting their
[1418.32 - 1424.16] tongue um rightfully so so that's
[1421.56 - 1426.00] another thing that people go through so
[1424.16 - 1428.00] our immune system is heavily challenged
[1426.00 - 1430.40] and it showcases itself through oral
[1428.00 - 1434.28] health tongue health and then what about
[1430.40 - 1436.80] crinkles crinkle tongue crinkle tongue
[1434.28 - 1439.12] Sahara Desert tongue
[1436.80 - 1441.48] right so the whole thing thing with the
[1439.12 - 1445.16] tongue and and crinkling and getting the
[1441.48 - 1446.60] lines in it and all of that too you know
[1445.16 - 1448.76] and a lot of people are like well you
[1446.60 - 1451.28] know it's you go to somebody you go to
[1448.76 - 1454.52] you know Chinese medicine or you go you
[1451.28 - 1456.52] know Oriental medicine or you go to um
[1454.52 - 1458.44] atic you know medicine or whatever and
[1456.52 - 1461.00] you're going to you know you're doing a
[1458.44 - 1464.08] all that and you're going to different
[1461.00 - 1465.76] practitioners NDS herbalists right
[1464.08 - 1467.00] acupuncturists and they're just like oh
[1465.76 - 1469.32] I'm looking at your
[1467.00 - 1471.96] tongue you know you got liver heat
[1469.32 - 1473.56] looking at your tongue and you got this
[1471.96 - 1475.48] but here's another thing people don't
[1473.56 - 1477.60] realize your
[1475.48 - 1479.28] tongue it's not just coming from your
[1477.60 - 1481.04] gut or your liver or anything like that
[1479.28 - 1485.92] and showcasing signs of
[1481.04 - 1489.04] that your tongue itself is challenged
[1485.92 - 1491.76] challenged on immune system levels it's
[1489.04 - 1493.80] challenged orally you're challenged on
[1491.76 - 1496.52] an immune system oral
[1493.80 - 1498.48] health and you could be getting healthy
[1496.52 - 1501.08] kicking butt getting rid of you could be
[1498.48 - 1502.32] doing medical medium stuff you're doing
[1501.08 - 1503.96] medical medium stuff you're getting rid
[1502.32 - 1505.24] of neurological symptoms you're moving
[1503.96 - 1506.68] forward and you're kicking butt and
[1505.24 - 1508.36] you're healing and you're just you're
[1506.68 - 1511.68] you're you're crushing it you knocked
[1508.36 - 1514.04] out 40 symptoms and you're moving
[1511.68 - 1515.80] forward and you can still have a beat up
[1514.04 - 1518.72] tongue for quite a while because
[1515.80 - 1522.48] sometimes the tongues are the last to
[1518.72 - 1526.24] heal sometimes the tongues are the last
[1522.48 - 1527.08] to heal deep seated tongue issues right
[1526.24 - 1529.36] the
[1527.08 - 1531.64] grooves all all of
[1529.36 - 1534.12] that sometimes that takes time and it
[1531.64 - 1536.52] could take you it could take years
[1534.12 - 1538.68] tongue could be tongues are some of the
[1536.52 - 1541.32] most toxic things in our body next to
[1538.68 - 1544.48] our hearts yeah our hearts really toxic
[1541.32 - 1546.80] our livers really toxic and our brains
[1544.48 - 1546.80] really
[1547.00 - 1550.40] toxic down the road they're going to
[1548.80 - 1552.84] offer programs it's going to be closer
[1550.40 - 1555.08] to more closer to ending times but it's
[1552.84 - 1556.60] was talking the spirit of compassion and
[1555.08 - 1558.36] spirit of compassion is closer we get to
[1556.60 - 1560.68] ending times down down the road there
[1558.36 - 1562.80] going to be offering programs where you
[1560.68 - 1564.76] know you just you not only do you are
[1562.80 - 1568.16] you like an organ donor you have an
[1564.76 - 1570.84] organ organ donor card but you also have
[1568.16 - 1573.88] an organ feeder card so because there's
[1570.84 - 1575.80] going to be all kinds of problems with
[1573.88 - 1578.12] crops and the Food Supplies are going to
[1575.80 - 1580.00] dim down because of toxicity and
[1578.12 - 1582.68] everything else down way way way way in
[1580.00 - 1584.88] the future and
[1582.68 - 1587.36] um they're going to be offering people
[1584.88 - 1589.00] who pass away offering organs for being
[1587.36 - 1592.12] consumed because the food supply is
[1589.00 - 1593.52] going to be so scarce um I think I'm
[1592.12 - 1594.84] going to do something about that or talk
[1593.52 - 1597.28] something about that that's really
[1594.84 - 1600.40] intense
[1597.28 - 1602.20] stuff but anyway tongues are going to be
[1600.40 - 1604.04] on the menu is what I'm trying to say
[1602.20 - 1607.40] and that's where I was going they will
[1604.04 - 1610.00] be on the menu and it won't be just cow

[1637.44 - 1640.48] system or Diet belief system or whatever
[1639.24 - 1643.08] it is you want to call it out there a
[1640.48 - 1644.68] trend most people healed and the most
[1643.08 - 1645.56] most people around the planet around the
[1644.68 - 1649.08] globe
[1645.56 - 1652.08] healing the most the most most attacked

[1653.92 - 1658.16] of me I'm just a messenger so let's talk
[1656.52 - 1659.72] about the pro propolis and everything so
[1658.16 - 1662.56] if you if you're

[1662.56 - 1668.36] got a little shot glass here and um I
[1666.24 - 1671.28] might do something kind of funny here I
[1668.36 - 1672.72] might put a little bit of this tea water
[1671.28 - 1675.40] in
[1672.72 - 1678.92] there so I want to talk about how to
[1675.40 - 1681.24] apply to canker sores cold soures mouth
[1678.92 - 1683.00] ulcers so here's what you do even though
[1681.24 - 1684.64] I got this little shot glass out there
[1683.00 - 1686.00] because you can put it in there too if
[1684.64 - 1690.92] you don't like the taste The Taste is
[1686.00 - 1694.60] actually good in my opinion The Taste is
[1690.92 - 1698.44] great in my opinion okay so you got I
[1694.60 - 1701.68] got the propolis right here so applying
[1698.44 - 1704.84] it you apply it right on the source
[1701.68 - 1707.56] that's what I tell all people I know
[1704.84 - 1711.40] that are dealing with anything right on
[1707.56 - 1714.60] the sore droing a little bit right out
[1711.40 - 1716.48] of the thing you put it on the soore
[1714.60 - 1720.16] okay but I well here's the best way
[1716.48 - 1723.76] doing it that's the lazy way lazy way of
[1720.16 - 1727.44] doing it you take a paper towel or or a
[1723.76 - 1730.36] wash cloth that's dry and
[1727.44 - 1734.76] clean not one that's been used for all
[1730.36 - 1737.28] kinds of things you take a was washcloth
[1734.76 - 1741.00] or a paper towel on the inside of the
[1737.28 - 1745.36] mouth you just dry that canker sore dry
[1741.00 - 1746.72] it yes dry it so you just go tap tap tap
[1745.36 - 1749.88] you know you take that paper towel you
[1746.72 - 1752.56] go you you dab it you dry the
[1749.88 - 1754.32] sore it could be a sore on your gum it
[1752.56 - 1757.64] could be a canker sore on your gum on
[1754.32 - 1759.92] your tongue it could be a blister from a
[1757.64 - 1762.20] cold sore which is different herpes cold
[1759.92 - 1766.48] sores are different than canker
[1762.20 - 1768.60] sores right or that area line you know
[1766.48 - 1771.44] what I'm talking about the lines
[1768.60 - 1774.20] so what about the ker swur lines sharp
[1771.44 - 1776.64] Jagged pain in the inside of the mouth
[1774.20 - 1777.96] right the lines you know you feel them

[1777.96 - 1782.32] your mouth you're like the heck where'
[1780.56 - 1784.68] those lines come from and the lines are
[1782.32 - 1786.56] there right people have this all day
[1784.68 - 1788.40] long out there and they got two or three
[1786.56 - 1791.80] canker sturs just on the line and the
[1788.40 - 1794.48] line hurts or if they bit their tongue
[1791.80 - 1797.52] they bit their lip they bit the side of
[1794.48 - 1799.12] the inside of their cheek and now a krur

[1842.08 - 1848.48] canas saurus going down the
[1844.92 - 1851.04] esophagus but what you do is you dry off
[1848.48 - 1852.80] the area if it's on the lip dry it on
[1851.04 - 1855.32] dry it off if it's outside of the lip
[1852.80 - 1858.16] it's already dry pretty much but you
[1855.32 - 1860.28] apply the propolis every single hour you
[1858.16 - 1862.36] apply it to the blister to the dry
[1860.28 - 1864.24] blister to the blister on the outside of

[1875.16 - 1879.92] it if it's if it's in your lip inside
[1877.24 - 1882.88] your mouth and it feeds the immune
[1879.92 - 1884.92] system in that area it feeds the immune
[1882.88 - 1889.56] system in the
[1884.92 - 1891.20] area yes it does so the propolis is
[1889.56 - 1894.16] something that you
[1891.20 - 1896.56] apply right on the
[1894.16 - 1900.48] spot and oh my
[1896.56 - 1902.28] God what it does but it's not just that
[1900.48 - 1904.08] sure okay you might be somebody that
[1902.28 - 1906.08] doesn't have a canker swur but you got
[1904.08 - 1907.56] receding gums you might be somebody that
[1906.08 - 1909.84] doesn't have a canker stur but you got
[1907.56 - 1911.84] some other problems you got other mouth
[1909.84 - 1915.08] problems happening of all different
[1911.84 - 1919.52] kinds bad
[1915.08 - 1923.04] bacteria you put propolis in your mouth
[1919.52 - 1925.60] as your mouth wash or mouth rinse but
[1923.04 - 1928.80] just swallow it because it's your
[1925.60 - 1931.20] propolis what it can do for your oral
[1928.80 - 1933.20] health if this what I was trying to say
[1931.20 - 1934.64] oil pulling it's not that a lot of
[1933.20 - 1937.76] people are even doing oil pulling
[1934.64 - 1939.96] anymore oil pulling is
[1937.76 - 1943.64] ridonculous
[1939.96 - 1946.24] compared to using propolis now keep in
[1943.64 - 1948.04] mind this is the vimergy propolis I
[1946.24 - 1949.48] endorse these guys for a reason because
[1948.04 - 1950.96] nothing touches that stuff it has a
[1949.48 - 1954.48] living coratin in
[1950.96 - 1956.48] it I mean polyphenols a whole bit has a
[1954.48 - 1960.32] living cortin in it it's not like dead
[1956.48 - 1962.00] coratin it's living coratin inside there
[1960.32 - 1963.92] I mean that's a whole another story
[1962.00 - 1965.24] about why this propolis is so incredible
[1963.92 - 1968.08] so what you see it's in the middle out
[1965.24 - 1970.76] of these three it's the propolis pure
[1968.08 - 1972.60] okay so that's the vimer GV is in Victor

[2139.92 - 2147.28] is it's immune system needs care and
[2143.72 - 2151.68] love it needs help and our immune system
[2147.28 - 2153.96] really really is very very productive
[2151.68 - 2155.92] around our mouth in our mouth in our
[2153.96 - 2158.32] neck in our
[2155.92 - 2159.92] throat how many people get tonsilitis
[2158.32 - 2161.56] how many people get their tonsils out
[2159.92 - 2163.20] how many people have sore throats how
[2161.56 - 2164.80] many people have strep throat how many
[2163.20 - 2167.80] people have all kinds of problems left
[2164.80 - 2169.76] and right you name it and their teeth
[2167.80 - 2171.56] end up problematic down the road and

[2171.56 - 2176.16] end up getting sores and all kinds of
[2173.12 - 2180.24] stuff in their mouth and they end up
[2176.16 - 2183.76] getting other things too so oral
[2180.24 - 2186.96] health there's like hands down propolis
[2183.76 - 2188.64] should be in everybody's like bathroom
[2186.96 - 2190.36] that's a great place for it too not just
[2188.64 - 2191.72] in your supplement section wherever you
[2190.36 - 2193.24] keep your supplements and everything and
[2191.72 - 2196.36] you got your supplements lined up or
[2193.24 - 2198.28] whatever that might be and you have that
[2196.36 - 2200.84] propolis should be there and one should
[2198.28 - 2203.76] be in your bathroom for cold sores and
[2200.84 - 2206.44] kker sores and oral stuff and whatever
[2203.76 - 2208.08] it should be in there so you can put it
[2206.44 - 2209.64] in your mouth you can put it on your
[2208.08 - 2211.60] tongue you can actually just you could
[2209.64 - 2214.28] put a squirt of it in your mouth and let
[2211.60 - 2216.28] it just mole around for 30 seconds you
[2214.28 - 2218.56] can do a dropper full and let it mole
[2216.28 - 2221.20] around for 30 seconds seconds or a
[2218.56 - 2222.88] minute in your mouth let it just absorb
[2221.20 - 2226.36] into the immune system so the immune
[2222.88 - 2228.48] system can use it and Gobble it up that
[2226.36 - 2232.00] incredible living coratin that's in
[2228.48 - 2233.40] there what what like God's Gift really
[2232.00 - 2235.76] the problem is with propolis is out
[2233.40 - 2238.08] there they're polluted they're burnt
[2235.76 - 2240.24] they don't have those those um
[2238.08 - 2242.00] phytochemical compounds that are active
[2240.24 - 2244.84] because alcohol's been put in there and
[2242.00 - 2247.12] alcohol just kills every phytochemical
[2244.84 - 2249.52] compound that's why the alcohol world
[2247.12 - 2252.48] inting Ure world it's it's it's dying
[2249.52 - 2254.28] because medical medium exposed that
[2252.48 - 2256.60] medical medium exposed that tincture
[2254.28 - 2258.72] should not have alcohol in them it
[2256.60 - 2260.68] should not have that corn grain alcohol
[2258.72 - 2262.40] in them I mean oh my God that was
[2260.68 - 2264.56] happening for years and years and years
[2262.40 - 2268.88] and I don't care like grape
[2264.56 - 2270.72] alcohol still not good still not good oh
[2268.88 - 2272.48] yeah no this is grape alcohol this isn't
[2270.72 - 2275.32] corn grain alcohol like you know they
[2272.48 - 2278.92] use in a lot of supplements uh I don't
[2275.32 - 2280.64] care still not good bad idea bad idea
[2278.92 - 2282.52] still kills everything still kills the
[2280.64 - 2284.40] phytochemical compound so the vimergy
[2282.52 - 2285.44] stuff they won't do that they won't play
[2284.40 - 2288.28] with
[2285.44 - 2290.56] that they they instead put together a
[2288.28 - 2292.48] propolis that doesn't have that it's
[2290.56 - 2295.60] just you can't like can't get any better
[2292.48 - 2295.60] than that
[2295.92 - 2301.56] so
[2297.60 - 2304.04] cavities cavities okay what I love about
[2301.56 - 2306.60] propolis is it's a great thing to keep
[2304.04 - 2309.24] the mouth's immune system strong because
[2306.60 - 2310.68] cavities can be something that's really
[2309.24 - 2312.08] annoying see a lot of people have toxic
[2310.68 - 2313.80] they're high and toxic heavy metals they
[2312.08 - 2316.24] got a lot of viruses like Epstein bar
[2313.80 - 2318.44] hhv6 out aular virus they got all kinds
[2316.24 - 2322.12] of stuff HPV they just got lots of
[2318.44 - 2324.48] different bugs and so those bugs end up
[2322.12 - 2327.08] you know challenging the immune system
[2324.48 - 2329.96] over and over again and so when that
[2327.08 - 2331.76] happens bacteria that's not great
[2329.96 - 2333.72] bacteria that's sitting inside the mouth
[2331.76 - 2335.44] can actually produce cavities a little
[2333.72 - 2337.28] bit more especially if there's Metals
[2335.44 - 2338.92] around and metals in the tissue and some
[2337.28 - 2341.80] of these high in metals the immune
[2338.92 - 2343.44] system can't keep up with it so cavities
[2341.80 - 2346.12] start getting produced even if you're
[2343.44 - 2347.56] healing I know people they're healing
[2346.12 - 2349.20] look I know people in medical medium
[2347.56 - 2351.00] they heal all their cavities they heal
[2349.20 - 2354.36] their their mouth they heal they their
[2351.00 - 2355.80] teeth regrow enamel so many people
[2354.36 - 2357.60] throughout the years their teeth are
[2355.80 - 2359.80] regrowing
[2357.60 - 2361.56] enamel like they had a hard time with
[2359.80 - 2363.08] their teeth because of the deficiencies
[2361.56 - 2365.36] and nutritional deficiencies they had
[2363.08 - 2366.64] for 20 years and all the medications and
[2365.36 - 2368.04] the drugs they've been on and all the
[2366.64 - 2369.72] different stuff and the benzos and
[2368.04 - 2372.48] everything else everything they tried
[2369.72 - 2374.72] you know you name it down the line right
[2372.48 - 2376.16] and they're beat up and their teeth all
[2374.72 - 2378.32] of a sudden just crumble all the apple
[2376.16 - 2381.20] cider vinegar that's another thing okay
[2378.32 - 2384.00] okay if there's one thing I can give you
[2381.20 - 2385.92] one thing you can take away from this
[2384.00 - 2387.96] stop the Apple C of vinegar stop all
[2385.92 - 2389.76] vinegars but stop the Apple C of vinegar
[2387.96 - 2390.92] if Apple C of vinegar is the only
[2389.76 - 2392.56] vinegar you're going to use because
[2390.92 - 2394.28] you're going to use the B worst vinegars
[2392.56 - 2396.68] then use the Apple Coda vinegar but stop
[2394.28 - 2399.36] it if you're worried about your teeth
[2396.68 - 2402.92] and your HC and your gastric glands be
[2399.36 - 2404.48] careful with the apple cider vinegar
[2402.92 - 2406.28] because apple cider vinegar will start
[2404.48 - 2408.12] leeching all the Calum will leech out of
[2406.28 - 2409.84] your teeth and over time and then years
[2408.12 - 2411.76] go by and even if you're doing the right
[2409.84 - 2413.04] things finally your teeth crumble even
[2411.76 - 2415.48] when you're finally doing the right
[2413.04 - 2417.52] things you find like answers and you're
[2415.48 - 2419.48] healing you know why you're sick from EP
[2417.52 - 2421.88] bar you're getting Metals out your teeth
[2419.48 - 2424.04] can still have the delayed effect of of
[2421.88 - 2427.52] all the vinegar for 20 years so it takes
[2424.04 - 2430.00] time for that to heal too
[2427.52 - 2432.20] mirio says I had receding gums and
[2430.00 - 2434.24] exposed tooth and celery juice fixed
[2432.20 - 2436.32] that for me celery juice does I wrote a
[2434.24 - 2438.36] book the celery juice book that talks
[2436.32 - 2440.84] about what it does for gums and teeth
[2438.36 - 2444.20] and how it could even stop errosion and
[2440.84 - 2445.64] enamel erosion and gum receding yeah I
[2444.20 - 2448.00] mean it's critical you have to have the
[2445.64 - 2449.76] celery juice too there's some people
[2448.00 - 2451.96] that need more than the celery juice but
[2449.76 - 2455.64] the ACV does damage and it does damage
[2451.96 - 2456.64] that shows post post damage later on all
[2455.64 - 2458.04] right so let's talk about the golden
[2456.64 - 2459.80] seal
[2458.04 - 2462.24] so we're talking about the propolis this
[2459.80 - 2464.88] is VY stuff right here V is and Victor i
[2462.24 - 2468.60] m is and Mary E RG
[2464.88 - 2471.44] y.com okay themy stuff I endorse these
[2468.60 - 2473.52] guys because they are the greatest the
[2471.44 - 2475.76] greatest and the greatest you see people
[2473.52 - 2477.12] who like you know like whatever rep
[2475.76 - 2479.44] companies out there and stuff like that
[2477.12 - 2481.88] you see it out there they're not saying
[2479.44 - 2483.32] that you know this is the greatest and
[2481.88 - 2486.96] they don't say all the good reasons and
[2483.32 - 2488.72] all that right but when you know what
[2486.96 - 2490.76] they're doing and how they're doing in
[2488.72 - 2492.84] the process I had to stand behind this
[2490.76 - 2494.96] company do you know how many companies
[2492.84 - 2498.20] come to me out there you
[2494.96 - 2499.72] guys a dozen a day medical medium can
[2498.20 - 2501.08] you get behind my company medical medium
[2499.72 - 2503.68] can you get behind my company medical
[2501.08 - 2506.24] medium if you guys only knew what our
[2503.68 - 2510.84] inboxes looked like you wouldn't believe
[2506.24 - 2512.20] it I could rep a 100 companies out there
[2510.84 - 2513.60] make hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[2512.20 - 2516.00] of millions of dollars but I don't the
[2513.60 - 2517.28] point is it has to be like something
[2516.00 - 2519.04] special the best thing in the world
[2517.28 - 2520.00] world the best thing I think is out
[2519.04 - 2521.84] there in the world and that's the
[2520.00 - 2525.24] vimergy
[2521.84 - 2528.24] stuff anyway the golden
[2525.24 - 2530.52] seal the golden seal speaks for itself
[2528.24 - 2532.52] it just does I talk about it in the
[2530.52 - 2533.84] books I talk about in the medical medium
[2532.52 - 2538.96] series the book
[2533.84 - 2541.32] series golden seal right I love it for a
[2538.96 - 2542.92] lot of reasons there's golden seal shock
[2541.32 - 2545.76] therapy you should look into it
[2542.92 - 2547.60] everybody should have a golden seal and
[2545.76 - 2549.40] not a golden seal with alcohol in it
[2547.60 - 2551.68] natural flavors not a golden seal with
[2549.40 - 2553.36] citric acid in it not a golden seal with
[2551.68 - 2555.44] some other crazy stuff that they're not
[2553.36 - 2556.76] listing on the bottle remember I told
[2555.44 - 2559.20] you there's this like there's this
[2556.76 - 2560.52] there's 10% law I something like I don't
[2559.20 - 2562.56] know it's a small
[2560.52 - 2563.96] percentage and all these supplement
[2562.56 - 2565.24] companies can put all the stuff in it
[2563.96 - 2567.00] nobody even knows they don't have to
[2565.24 - 2569.88] list it well vimergy doesn't do that
[2567.00 - 2570.92] anyway golden seal a potent powerful
[2569.88 - 2573.16] golden
[2570.92 - 2577.68] seal you can't go wrong with that so
[2573.16 - 2579.60] it's another thing too and then um
[2577.68 - 2582.20] the good old
[2579.60 - 2585.24] zinc zinc liquid zinc sulfate right
[2582.20 - 2586.84] there the vimergy one the only one I
[2585.24 - 2589.60] trust
[2586.84 - 2593.68] um critical for the immune system and
[2589.60 - 2596.96] we're in January right now heading into
[2593.68 - 2600.28] February and there is a [ __ ]
[2596.96 - 2604.00] storm heading over into the United
[2600.28 - 2606.72] States it's a [ __ ] storm of a lot of RSV
[2604.00 - 2609.16] a [ __ ] storm of a lot of flu bugs
[2606.72 - 2612.48] different flu of all
[2609.16 - 2614.16] kinds different Seas of all of all kinds
[2612.48 - 2616.00] and all that you believe it at this
[2614.16 - 2618.72] point still I say
[2616.00 - 2621.28] C at this point everybody says what they
[2618.72 - 2624.52] want out there right I still have to say
[2621.28 - 2626.40] C because like I said you don't get
[2624.52 - 2629.28] awards for getting people better A lot
[2626.40 - 2631.28] of people better like thousands upon
[2629.28 - 2632.36] thousands you don't get Awards and you
[2631.28 - 2637.24] don't get
[2632.36 - 2640.80] like um you don't get immunity for it so
[2637.24 - 2642.36] yeah see anyway so there's a lot of that
[2640.80 - 2644.24] going around there's a lot of that out
[2642.36 - 2646.24] there so keep in mind you want your
[2644.24 - 2648.60] immune system strong and protect it you
[2646.24 - 2651.76] want your immune system in a good place
[2648.60 - 2654.44] what you see in front of me is the zinc
[2651.76 - 2656.96] you got the propolis and check out
[2654.44 - 2659.68] golden seal it should be in your cabinet
[2656.96 - 2660.76] it should be in your kitchen it should
[2659.68 - 2663.52] be by your
[2660.76 - 2666.76] nightstand I keep the golden seal by my
[2663.52 - 2669.92] nightstand that's right I shoot some in
[2666.76 - 2671.44] boot boom down it goes what I like to do
[2669.92 - 2673.20] with golden seal is I like to actually
[2671.44 - 2674.20] just let it sit in my mouth and sit in
[2673.20 - 2677.00] my
[2674.20 - 2679.36] throat that's one way of using golden
[2677.00 - 2681.80] seal and um I like to do the same thing
[2679.36 - 2684.32] with propolis and zinc so I put zinc in
[2681.80 - 2685.84] propolis and some golden seal I put a
[2684.32 - 2687.68] little bit in my mouth and I let it you
[2685.84 - 2689.48] know sit there you can put it in a shot
[2687.68 - 2691.28] glass just like this there's nothing
[2689.48 - 2692.80] wrong with that can do that I'm going to
[2691.28 - 2693.80] put some golden seal in here if you
[2692.80 - 2696.08] don't
[2693.80 - 2697.88] mind I'm going to put two dropper fulls
[2696.08 - 2701.44] of golden seal in there

[2950.20 - 2954.16] fluoride's really bad so it's hitting
[2952.28 - 2955.72] mainstream so you're going to blame me
[2954.16 - 2957.04] for a cavity or you're going to blame me
[2955.72 - 2958.80] for
[2957.04 - 2961.08] something you're going to blame medical
[2958.80 - 2962.64] meme information but you're you're not
[2961.08 - 2964.44] like the people in the medical M
[2962.64 - 2966.00] Community who literally have been there
[2964.44 - 2967.72] done that tried everything and they're
[2966.00 - 2969.60] seasoned and they're really applying
[2967.72 - 2971.56] medical medium and customizing it for
[2969.60 - 2975.52] themselves and they have they're humble
[2971.56 - 2977.40] they're humble and their integrity is is
[2975.52 - 2979.84] unbelievable the people in the medical
[2977.40 - 2983.76] medium Community their integrity and
[2979.84 - 2986.00] their humble nature and their
[2983.76 - 2988.12] their they have respect for other people

[2990.24 - 2994.24] so you if you drift into the medical M
[2992.60 - 2995.56] community and you try one thing and you
[2994.24 - 2998.04] don't like me for some reason because

[2998.04 - 3001.12] glasses or something like that and
[2999.40 - 3002.88] you're just pissed or you hear something
[3001.12 - 3003.96] that's a lie and false information out
[3002.88 - 3006.60] there about me because there's a bunch
[3003.96 - 3007.64] of people spreading that constantly if
[3006.60 - 3009.24] you're that and all of a sudden you're
[3007.64 - 3010.88] going to complain about your cavity or
[3009.24 - 3012.36] something or your gums did you really do
[3010.88 - 3013.80] medical medium no and what about the
[3012.36 - 3016.32] medical treatment did you get the
[3013.80 - 3018.20] medical treatment and what about birth
[3016.32 - 3020.20] control were you doing birth control
[3018.20 - 3022.48] when you were 16 years old 17 years old
[3020.20 - 3024.36] 10 you know 10 years ago were you doing
[3022.48 - 3026.28] it when you were you know 15 years ago
[3024.36 - 3027.84] how much birth control did you do and
[3026.28 - 3030.52] what about the Medical Treatments you
[3027.84 - 3034.08] had too like you know what I mean like
[3030.52 - 3037.60] those whatever it is there's a lot of
[3034.08 - 3038.92] stuff so yeah get cracking at it I'd
[3037.60 - 3041.08] like to see all the receipts and see all
[3038.92 - 3043.76] the data let's bring it all out on the
[3041.08 - 3046.44] table
[3043.76 - 3048.48] okay yeah
[3046.44 - 3050.00] exactly and if somebody's out there and
[3048.48 - 3052.16] they want to take it to a whole another
[3050.00 - 3053.84] level of like whatever it is saying that
[3052.16 - 3057.20] harm was created because of this because
[3053.84 - 3060.56] of because of you know like some
[3057.20 - 3062.88] fruit and you could eat meat you can be
[3060.56 - 3064.84] vegan you can do whatever you want and
[3062.88 - 3066.40] still do medical medium but if you're
[3064.84 - 3068.00] like you think you were harmed by
[3066.40 - 3069.60] actually learning some really good
[3068.00 - 3071.92] information and taking care of yourself
[3069.60 - 3073.84] well then we're going to look at all
[3071.92 - 3075.44] your
[3073.84 - 3077.96] records
[3075.44 - 3079.88] yeah yeah like if you want to take it
[3077.96 - 3082.36] out there and put it out there publicly
[3079.88 - 3083.44] like then we need to see all your
[3082.36 - 3084.84] records I want to see all your
[3083.44 - 3086.12] medications I want to see all your
[3084.84 - 3087.48] medical visits I want to see all your

[3087.48 - 3091.12] you buy I want to see everything I want
[3088.68 - 3093.00] to see every single
[3091.12 - 3096.00] receipt
[3093.00 - 3096.00] yeah
[3096.16 - 3101.84] so
[3098.68 - 3104.16] mhm and we should do that too if someone
[3101.84 - 3107.64] wants to take it to to the full extent
[3104.16 - 3112.48] of I've been hurt by actually doing some
[3107.64 - 3115.24] wild blueberries and and my teeth fell
[3112.48 - 3116.80] out from doing medical medium really cuz
[3115.24 - 3118.92] everybody's teeth are healing on medic
[3116.80 - 3120.40] medium and if sometimes it's a delay
[3118.92 - 3122.04] Factor people get into medical medium
[3120.40 - 3124.24] they're already their teeth their their
[3122.04 - 3125.80] teeth was having problems but if you're
[3124.24 - 3128.68] going to go there to the full extent and
[3125.80 - 3130.12] and go like hogwire public about it or
[3128.68 - 3131.76] something then yeah we have to do
[3130.12 - 3133.52] something like legally we need to look
[3131.76 - 3136.08] at all your documents all your records
[3133.52 - 3137.80] all your stuff we need to see like were
[3136.08 - 3139.44] you in a case study somewhere where they
[3137.80 - 3140.92] were only feeding you medical medium
[3139.44 - 3142.12] stuff and they had they were watching
[3140.92 - 3147.28] everything they're watching everything
[3142.12 - 3147.28] you did every food you ate every no
[3148.04 - 3151.76] it's an insane
[3149.32 - 3154.04] world but you guys know
[3151.76 - 3155.76] that living light right there shared
[3154.04 - 3158.48] medical medium information with
[3155.76 - 3160.36] cooworker as soon as she learned she got
[3158.48 - 3162.92] life-changing foods and started medical
[3160.36 - 3166.04] medium healing immediately and her A1C
[3162.92 - 3168.00] has dropped from 6.5 to five that's
[3166.04 - 3170.32] actually really incredible by the way
[3168.00 - 3172.56] and she's lost weight doing morning
[3170.32 - 3174.56] cleanse it's amazing you know know why I
[3172.56 - 3176.16] don't talk about type two type diabetes
[3174.56 - 3178.76] and type one two you know why I don't
[3176.16 - 3181.24] talk about Len and everything else and
[3178.76 - 3183.32] diabetes and stuff like that and and and
[3181.24 - 3185.32] it's in the books I talk about diabetes
[3183.32 - 3187.28] and pre-diabetes and pre pre pre pre
[3185.32 - 3190.08] pre-diabetes in the books Liver Rescue
[3187.28 - 3192.00] you guys I I I I love talking about the
[3190.08 - 3193.64] reason why I don't talk about it because
[3192.00 - 3196.08] you get fixed when you're doing medical
[3193.64 - 3197.92] medium there's so many different
[3196.08 - 3199.64] difficult neurological symptoms that we
[3197.92 - 3201.28] need that I always try to help people
[3199.64 - 3204.36] with and push them forward with because
[3201.28 - 3205.88] those are oh man those can dog along
[3204.36 - 3208.52] because nerves get damaged and you got
[3205.88 - 3212.32] to repair the nerves and they take time
[3208.52 - 3215.36] but man type 2 diabetes boom like boom
[3212.32 - 3217.92] off insulin after a while boom yeah
[3215.36 - 3219.60] because you know you lower those fats
[3217.92 - 3222.60] you're getting the insulin resistance
[3219.60 - 3224.20] and your oh my God the diabetes
[3222.60 - 3226.04] information out there by the way the
[3224.20 - 3227.12] glucose stuff out there and the glucose
[3226.04 - 3229.24] people out there are talking about
[3227.12 - 3231.00] glucose and making big like you know
[3229.24 - 3232.68] making big waves out there because they
[3231.00 - 3234.28] got they run a billion ads they got
[3232.68 - 3235.88] money behind them right and they're
[3234.28 - 3237.32] they're not censored they're not Shadow
[3235.88 - 3239.00] banded and they're out there and they're
[3237.32 - 3240.28] doing the glucose crap out there all
[3239.00 - 3241.68] those people talking about that the
[3240.28 - 3244.92] influencers and
[3241.68 - 3245.96] stuff I don't know how anybody survives
[3244.92 - 3248.88] what they
[3245.96 - 3250.76] offer all they offer are insul creating
[3248.88 - 3253.44] insulin resistance that's that's all
[3250.76 - 3255.04] they offer out there they offer things
[3253.44 - 3256.72] pretending it's going to help eat this
[3255.04 - 3258.32] with this eat this with that and all it
[3256.72 - 3259.56] does is create insulin resistance I
[3258.32 - 3261.48] don't know how anybody's going to get
[3259.56 - 3263.36] better out there with the amount of the
[3261.48 - 3265.88] amount of crap that's regurgitating and
[3263.36 - 3270.24] recycling back into itself it's like a
[3265.88 - 3272.60] giant monster of [ __ ] people send in DMS

[3645.32 - 3651.20] too okay just want to tell you guys
[3648.80 - 3653.04] anyway when it comes down to oral health
[3651.20 - 3654.84] we want to build our immune system we
[3653.04 - 3657.40] want it strong we want the immune system
[3654.84 - 3660.08] in our neck and in our throat and in our
[3657.40 - 3662.96] mouth to be strong so it kills off
[3660.08 - 3665.48] things that enter our mouth so it kills
[3662.96 - 3669.28] off stuff when you go to the
[3665.48 - 3671.32] dentist something you know just all
[3669.28 - 3673.48] kinds of different things
[3671.32 - 3677.68] and here's what I recommend if you're at
[3673.48 - 3679.24] the dentist office make your dentist and
[3677.68 - 3681.72] the
[3679.24 - 3684.36] hygienist right and the
[3681.72 - 3686.92] assistant make them change over their
[3684.36 - 3689.36] gloves if you're at a dentist office
[3686.92 - 3691.12] where they're they're they take your
[3689.36 - 3692.36] they take their gloves off and they
[3691.12 - 3696.00] place it
[3692.36 - 3698.36] down like on the counter they leave the
[3696.00 - 3700.24] assistants leave because they're on like
[3698.36 - 3702.28] this policy of like they don't want to
[3700.24 - 3705.56] waste gloves and then they come back and
[3702.28 - 3707.88] they put the same pair on okay I talk
[3705.56 - 3710.44] about this in brain saver brain saver is
[3707.88 - 3711.72] over there but what I'm trying to say is
[3710.44 - 3713.04] you go to the dentist since we're
[3711.72 - 3716.32] talking about oral health make them
[3713.04 - 3719.08] change out gloves because the gloves are
[3716.32 - 3721.00] to protect the you know protect them
[3719.08 - 3724.04] right but you want you want it to
[3721.00 - 3725.68] protect you too I can go into detail
[3724.04 - 3727.68] about that we can do a whole show on it
[3725.68 - 3728.60] but the whole glove changing thing is
[3727.68 - 3732.08] really
[3728.60 - 3734.24] important so it
[3732.08 - 3735.60] is because they touch everything and
[3734.24 - 3737.08] they're touching all the stuff and all
[3735.60 - 3739.64] that and it's the glove now they're you
