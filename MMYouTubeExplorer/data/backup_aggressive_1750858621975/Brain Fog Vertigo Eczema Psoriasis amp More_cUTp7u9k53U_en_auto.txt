[233.28 - 238.56] knowing the cause and the protocol
[236.48 - 239.92] you know what happens a friend of mine
[238.56 - 241.20] he goes out and gets all the health
[239.92 - 242.88] books out there he's looking at all the
[241.20 - 244.72] health books out there he gets this one
[242.88 - 246.32] he gets this one by some doctor
[244.72 - 248.32] so-and-so or he gets this health book
[246.32 - 251.28] out here and he says how come
[248.32 - 253.28] they don't have specific dosages
[251.28 - 255.52] specific protocols and i always say
[253.28 - 257.60] because they don't know the protocols
[255.52 - 259.76] they don't know why people are sick
[257.60 - 262.00] and how come they don't talk about why
[259.76 - 263.12] someone's really sick why do they have
[262.00 - 264.56] eczema
[263.12 - 266.24] and he grabs all the different health
[264.56 - 268.64] books out there for fun and he reads and
[266.24 - 271.28] he goes i can't find one health book
[268.64 - 274.08] that explains why someone actually has
[271.28 - 275.20] eczema and then a protocol on how to
[274.08 - 276.72] heal
[275.20 - 278.16] because there is none
[276.72 - 280.32] there is none
[278.16 - 281.68] this is the first that's ever been done
[280.32 - 284.32] and that's why i was the first to be
[281.68 - 286.00] censored years ago censored in 2017 i
[284.32 - 287.88] was censored when the first book medical
[286.00 - 289.52] medium came out
[287.88 - 291.68] 2015
[289.52 - 293.44] i was censored we had a fight our way
[291.68 - 294.64] through it you have to fight your way
[293.44 - 296.48] through the darkness right when the
[294.64 - 297.84] darkness comes and wants to stomp out
[296.48 - 300.32] the light
[297.84 - 302.64] you gotta fight your way through it to
[300.32 - 304.40] make sure people heal
[302.64 - 306.40] right so when the darkness comes and
[304.40 - 308.56] wants to stomp that light out be like
[306.40 - 310.72] you can't heal anybody
[308.56 - 312.32] you're not allowed to heal anybody
[310.72 - 314.64] you're not allowed to break the rules
[312.32 - 315.84] and teach them why they're sick the true
[314.64 - 317.92] causes
[315.84 - 319.52] we want everybody is sick the darkness
[317.92 - 321.44] just wants to keep everybody sick going
[319.52 - 323.12] to your pharmacies you see that now see

[332.00 - 336.24] with how many drugs they have to delve
[334.72 - 337.68] out everybody's waiting in line for a
[336.24 - 338.88] drug everybody's waiting in line for a
[337.68 - 340.88] drug

[495.68 - 500.48] chlorella details matter details matter
[498.64 - 502.56] chlorella
[500.48 - 505.76] chlorella is
[502.56 - 508.00] epically harmful for people and they
[505.76 - 509.84] don't even know it and still to this day
[508.00 - 513.28] you see some influencers out there i'm
[509.84 - 515.76] taking my chlorella tablets i'm doing my
[513.28 - 516.80] chlorella powder i'm getting rid of
[515.76 - 518.48] metals
[516.80 - 520.16] even though medical medium taught the
[518.48 - 521.84] world about toxic heavy metals and how
[520.16 - 524.48] to get rid of them all of a sudden i
[521.84 - 526.08] heard from another expert about metals
[524.48 - 526.96] who learned from medical medium or
[526.08 - 528.16] something
[526.96 - 530.40] yeah and
[528.16 - 531.60] i'm doing chlorella now mixing this in
[530.40 - 535.20] there yeah
[531.60 - 538.56] terrifying doesn't remove metals and
[535.20 - 541.76] chlorella drops stuff if it picks up a
[538.56 - 542.88] toxin it moves it drops it in a volatile
[541.76 - 544.56] area
[542.88 - 547.68] nice way to mess up your blood brain
[544.56 - 549.44] berry and everything else i'll tell you
[547.68 - 551.92] is another one these are just some
[549.44 - 555.76] glandular supplements right there that's
[551.92 - 558.24] a tricky one too right glandular sub acv
[555.76 - 559.84] vinegar lose your teeth
[558.24 - 560.96] lose your teeth i may not be the
[559.84 - 563.44] prettiest
[560.96 - 566.24] guy you ever seen okay
[563.44 - 570.00] i may not be you know the most handsome
[566.24 - 572.56] guy in the world but i got all my teeth
[570.00 - 574.32] yeah all my teeth right
[572.56 - 576.32] and there's nothing wrong with them and
[574.32 - 579.52] there's a reason i stayed away from
[576.32 - 581.92] vinegar i stayed away from acv
[579.52 - 584.32] stayed away
[581.92 - 585.60] just an acv and vinegar and acv tablets
[584.32 - 587.76] and everything else and boom or the
[585.60 - 589.20] gummies whatever it is down the road you
[587.76 - 591.20] lose all your teeth
[589.20 - 594.16] and it happens quick they all start
[591.20 - 595.36] crumbling in before you know it before
[594.16 - 597.44] you know it
[595.36 - 600.00] diatomaceous earth particles stay away
[597.44 - 604.16] from that bentonite clay stay away from
[600.00 - 607.52] that activated charcoal stay away from
[604.16 - 610.72] the activated charcoal i'll tell you why
[607.52 - 613.60] when you consume the activated charcoal
[610.72 - 615.68] it suffocates the intestinal lining not
[613.60 - 617.36] allowing nutrients and enzymes and
[615.68 - 619.52] everything that needs an amino acids and
[617.36 - 622.64] all these fantastic things it doesn't
[619.52 - 625.28] allow anything to come through very
[622.64 - 626.80] rarely can it come through so it has to
[625.28 - 630.72] come through in different moments of
[626.80 - 633.28] time you get nutrient deficiency totally
[630.72 - 636.24] nutrient deficiencies
[633.28 - 638.64] big time with activated charcoal right
[636.24 - 640.24] so keep that in mind right there these
[638.64 - 642.40] are just a few things i'm just going to
[640.24 - 644.24] run down a few things okay so what
[642.40 - 645.76] you're learning with the medical medium
[644.24 - 646.80] information
[645.76 - 648.40] is
[646.80 - 650.40] priceless
[648.40 - 654.00] because your health
[650.40 - 657.60] means everything you can't put a price
[654.00 - 662.16] on your health you cannot put a price
[657.60 - 663.44] it's not measurable your soul
[662.16 - 667.36] you cannot
[663.44 - 670.24] put a price on your soul
[667.36 - 673.12] it cannot happen
[670.24 - 674.88] your soul is beyond priceless there is
[673.12 - 678.24] no price
[674.88 - 678.24] we take our soul
[678.40 - 686.32] and it goes and leaves here this planet
[682.80 - 687.84] after we're gone right
[686.32 - 692.80] and there's no way there's no way to
[687.84 - 693.92] measure that value of a human soul right
[692.80 - 696.56] so that's
[693.92 - 699.84] and that soul sits inside our physical
[696.56 - 701.68] body our physical health is critical
[699.84 - 703.44] it's precious
[701.68 - 705.20] all these things matter so when we're
[703.44 - 706.96] talking about getting our health back
[705.20 - 708.24] and our lives back and you guys just
[706.96 - 709.36] came on here we're talking about brain
[708.24 - 712.24] fog we're talking about headaches and
[709.36 - 715.04] migraines protocols and supplements
[712.24 - 717.04] eczema talk about vertigo protocols and
[715.04 - 718.88] supplements right
[717.04 - 721.84] your health matters
[718.88 - 724.88] so taking the wrong things like they all
[721.84 - 726.80] throw at us okay your bentonite clay
[724.88 - 728.40] rips your intestinal tract apart
[726.80 - 731.52] destroys your lining in your intestinal
[728.40 - 733.12] tract you don't do clays
[731.52 - 735.20] remember that
[733.12 - 737.28] okay so very important to know all of
[735.20 - 740.00] this so let's move on a little bit so i
[737.28 - 741.36] just want to kind of kind of cover that
[740.00 - 743.04] area
[741.36 - 744.48] right
[743.04 - 747.04] and
[744.48 - 747.84] here's an interesting part here to run
[747.04 - 750.32] by because we're talking about
[747.84 - 752.40] supplements and protocols so if you guys
[750.32 - 754.00] got a second all right
[752.40 - 755.60] before we go on though
[754.00 - 757.84] just telling you i'll be on rumble
[755.60 - 759.28] exclusively to talk about a talk that's
[757.84 - 762.80] different than anything today that i'm
[759.28 - 765.04] doing on these lives right it's a 6 30
[762.80 - 767.68] eastern 3 30
[765.04 - 771.28] specific just letting you know
[767.68 - 773.12] and i'm making an announcement pretty
[771.28 - 774.80] soon about something i've never done
[773.12 - 776.64] before it could be it could go really
[774.80 - 777.68] bad it could go really good i don't know
[776.64 - 779.20] what
[777.68 - 782.48] but you guys might want to listen out
[779.20 - 784.48] for that something haven't done
[782.48 - 787.28] could be exciting
[784.48 - 790.40] all right you'll notice that almost
[787.28 - 794.16] every one of the items
[790.40 - 796.64] that's recommended supplementation
[794.16 - 799.84] in this book in the protocols so if you
[796.64 - 802.08] go to eczema you go to brain fog you go
[799.84 - 803.28] to an area inside this book you'll
[802.08 - 806.08] notice
[803.28 - 810.32] almost all of the recommendations of
[806.08 - 814.24] supplements in there are mostly singles
[810.32 - 817.44] singles say you take a lemon balm what
[814.24 - 821.20] does it say it says lemon balm
[817.44 - 824.64] it's not a blend of 50 herbs it's not a
[821.20 - 827.12] blend of 50 nutrients
[824.64 - 829.20] that's how they take you
[827.12 - 832.88] that's how they take you
[829.20 - 836.00] yeah that's rip off land and that's why
[832.88 - 838.32] people don't get better i mean people
[836.00 - 840.16] who get sick don't get better people who
[838.32 - 842.24] are waiting back and forth are not so
[840.16 - 844.24] sick and sick they're just elevating
[842.24 - 846.00] back and forth and things are keeping
[844.24 - 847.92] afloat and keeping a float when you go
[846.00 - 849.52] down and you go really sick and you're
[847.92 - 851.36] really sick
[849.52 - 852.56] you got to know the protocols and you
[851.36 - 854.96] have to know
[852.56 - 856.64] why singles
[854.96 - 859.20] are critical
[856.64 - 859.20] singles
[859.28 - 863.20] i call this singles for a reason right
[861.36 - 866.00] here so you'll notice that almost every
[863.20 - 869.52] one of the items to come
[866.00 - 872.00] in this section a single herb
[869.52 - 874.72] right what you won't find here are
[872.00 - 877.28] bottles and bottles of supplements you
[874.72 - 880.32] guys this is so important
[877.28 - 883.04] with dozens and dozens of ingredients
[880.32 - 885.20] herbs dozens of vitamins a dozen amino
[883.04 - 888.08] acids and more you won't find that in
[885.20 - 890.24] the recommended supplements here
[888.08 - 892.48] because you don't get better you don't
[890.24 - 895.20] go to the finish line details matter
[892.48 - 896.64] details matter details matter
[895.20 - 898.48] they matter
[896.64 - 902.72] there's a reason for this when you fill
[898.48 - 906.00] a capsule with anywhere from 10 to 40
[902.72 - 908.32] items 10 to 40 nutrients
[906.00 - 910.24] 10 to 40 nutrients of herbs and whatever
[908.32 - 912.32] else and minerals and amino acids or
[910.24 - 916.32] whatever it's going to be it's only
[912.32 - 919.76] going to contain a spec of each one so
[916.32 - 923.60] it's only going to contain a spec of
[919.76 - 923.60] each one keep that in mind
[924.24 - 929.36] and that spec won't it won't even be of
[926.80 - 931.04] the quality that you need
[929.36 - 933.28] this is why
[931.04 - 935.44] junk supplements or supplements that are
[933.28 - 936.88] even of quality of some sort don't get
[935.44 - 938.84] people better after all these years this
[936.88 - 940.48] is you guys
[938.84 - 943.76] maybe
[940.48 - 946.72] many of you guys know the history in the
[943.76 - 947.92] last 10 20 30 years in your life you're
[946.72 - 949.20] seasoned
[947.92 - 950.72] you've been there you tried all these
[949.20 - 952.64] piles of supplements you've been to
[950.72 - 954.16] another lime doctor and tried a bunch
[952.64 - 955.60] more pile supplements and you went to a
[954.16 - 957.28] functional medicine doctor and you tried
[955.60 - 958.64] this and the specialist who tried this
[957.28 - 960.40] you're taking all the supplements and
[958.64 - 961.84] then a year goes by you're still sick
[960.40 - 963.60] and they all sit and up in the cat
[961.84 - 965.20] cupboard and then you get a whole bunch
[963.60 - 967.28] more because you go see another doctor
[965.20 - 969.12] right and all these supplements are
[967.28 - 971.68] saturated with lots and lots and lots of
[969.12 - 974.16] bits and spark pieces of tidbits of
[971.68 - 976.08] nutrients like i said and that's why
[974.16 - 977.68] people don't get better this is so
[976.08 - 979.76] important if you guys just came on we're
[977.68 - 983.52] about to run into brain fog
[979.76 - 985.76] headaches and migraines eczema vertigo
[983.52 - 985.76] right
[986.40 - 990.32] this is a practice that the industry
[988.56 - 992.24] does they put together junk supps and
[990.32 - 994.08] they put specs and specs and specs and
[992.24 - 996.00] tidbits in of each little thing that's
[994.08 - 998.00] how they make their money when you do a
[996.00 - 999.68] spec of an amino acid then a speck of
[998.00 - 1001.60] this is speck of spirulina and then a
[999.68 - 1003.52] speck of this and then a speck of
[1001.60 - 1005.36] bladder rack and then a speck of an herb
[1003.52 - 1006.88] whatever it is you just spec spec spec
[1005.36 - 1009.52] specs back
[1006.88 - 1012.32] you got a capsule now with a bunch of
[1009.52 - 1015.28] specks that will never move the needle
[1012.32 - 1017.44] you can't move the needle with a speck
[1015.28 - 1019.20] here you are sick for real reasons we're
[1017.44 - 1020.96] going to talk about cover and cleanse
[1019.20 - 1022.48] the heel and you can't move the needle
[1020.96 - 1023.44] with a speck
[1022.48 - 1026.32] this
[1023.44 - 1029.28] schooling or whatever this learning or
[1026.32 - 1031.76] this information is so critical here
[1029.28 - 1033.52] there's a reason why i'm here making
[1031.76 - 1035.60] shorts for free making sure i'm not
[1033.52 - 1037.36] turning this into some kind of course
[1035.60 - 1039.84] making sure i'm not making you guys pay
[1037.36 - 1043.20] for all this information this is
[1039.84 - 1043.20] precious information
[1043.44 - 1047.84] so
[1045.44 - 1050.48] alina says i am migraine free
[1047.84 - 1052.96] and i had daily migraines for two years
[1050.48 - 1055.12] nothing helped with medical medium means
[1052.96 - 1057.12] alina you were doing the protocols you
[1055.12 - 1059.28] were doing you're seeing
[1057.12 - 1061.52] what works and you're experiencing it
[1059.28 - 1063.60] and you're feeling it
[1061.52 - 1066.88] yeah cindy lou says it's so hard to hear
[1063.60 - 1068.08] about friends taking junk supplements
[1066.88 - 1070.24] right
[1068.08 - 1071.92] i wasted so much money
[1070.24 - 1074.24] so let's go into it a little bit let's
[1071.92 - 1076.00] head into an area now let's talk about
[1074.24 - 1078.80] brain fog
[1076.00 - 1081.92] you can have brain fog
[1078.80 - 1084.24] and this person can have brain fog
[1081.92 - 1086.08] and this person can have brain fog
[1084.24 - 1087.76] on this other person over here can have
[1086.08 - 1090.48] brain fog
[1087.76 - 1092.24] and everybody can have brain fog
[1090.48 - 1095.28] but nobody will know
[1092.24 - 1097.12] why they have brain fog you can guess
[1095.28 - 1098.88] everybody can guess you can go to
[1097.12 - 1101.36] another practitioner another doctor and
[1098.88 - 1103.52] we can guess while we have brain fog
[1101.36 - 1105.52] and we can guess and we can guess and we
[1103.52 - 1109.12] can guess to the cows come home we can
[1105.52 - 1111.36] guess until the cows come home
[1109.12 - 1113.68] but won't know why we have brain fog
[1111.36 - 1116.80] lots of guesses
[1113.68 - 1119.68] the true cause of brain fog is low-grade
[1116.80 - 1122.56] chronic viral infections
[1119.68 - 1126.40] most commonly caused by one of the over
[1122.56 - 1128.64] 60 varieties of epstein-barr virus
[1126.40 - 1132.56] and toxic heavy metals such as mercury
[1128.64 - 1136.00] aluminum and copper or both of viral and
[1132.56 - 1138.96] a viral load and toxic heavy metals in
[1136.00 - 1141.92] combination so viral load and toxic
[1138.96 - 1144.96] heavy metals in combination right
[1141.92 - 1147.04] copper toxic heavy metal right there
[1144.96 - 1149.68] right it's copper
[1147.04 - 1152.72] big thing of copper right here okay
[1149.68 - 1153.92] toxic heavy metal in our system
[1152.72 - 1156.16] right
[1153.92 - 1159.04] virus
[1156.16 - 1162.08] virus inner system
[1159.04 - 1163.20] virus and metals
[1162.08 - 1164.64] makes
[1163.20 - 1165.84] brain fog
[1164.64 - 1168.80] how
[1165.84 - 1172.24] because the virus feeds off of metal
[1168.80 - 1174.24] releases a metal neurotoxin
[1172.24 - 1176.88] that neurotoxin
[1174.24 - 1178.56] heads up to the brain
[1176.88 - 1180.32] enters
[1178.56 - 1182.80] the brain
[1180.32 - 1184.24] lands on neurons and you got the brain
[1182.80 - 1185.76] fog
[1184.24 - 1187.68] let's go into the brain a little bit for
[1185.76 - 1191.76] a couple of seconds
[1187.68 - 1193.68] everybody's got metal inside their head
[1191.76 - 1196.96] everybody does
[1193.68 - 1198.88] it's ignored by the industries
[1196.96 - 1202.16] it's frowned upon to even think about
[1198.88 - 1204.00] how that's even possible
[1202.16 - 1205.44] the industries they'd still be well they
[1204.00 - 1207.76] still are they're still putting mercury
[1205.44 - 1209.92] amalgams in people what am i saying
[1207.76 - 1212.16] i was wrong just got corrected by spirit
[1209.92 - 1213.92] of compassion just now
[1212.16 - 1215.92] i mean i hate being corrected by
[1213.92 - 1217.68] spiritual compassion but i have to eat
[1215.92 - 1221.04] it when i gotta eat it
[1217.68 - 1222.16] when i've been wrong
[1221.04 - 1223.92] and
[1222.16 - 1225.52] what i was thinking for a second was no
[1223.92 - 1227.52] they don't put mercury amalgams in
[1225.52 - 1228.72] anybody anymore it's been outlawed or
[1227.52 - 1230.64] something they don't do it in spirit
[1228.72 - 1233.04] compassion corrected me and said no
[1230.64 - 1234.88] they're doing it still they still put
[1233.04 - 1237.20] put mercury amalgams in people here in
[1234.88 - 1240.40] the u.s and around the world i was stand
[1237.20 - 1243.52] corrected so i have to eat that one
[1240.40 - 1245.92] but regardless okay
[1243.52 - 1248.48] there's so much mercury out there that's
[1245.92 - 1251.04] to be had in many ways
[1248.48 - 1253.60] it's in the fish you eat every time i
[1251.04 - 1255.20] hear no i had sushi i'm eating healthy i
[1253.60 - 1256.80] had my sushi
[1255.20 - 1257.68] i'm eating healthy
[1256.80 - 1259.20] right
[1257.68 - 1261.28] having my sushi
[1259.20 - 1262.96] okay every time i hear that i just i
[1261.28 - 1264.00] just
[1262.96 - 1265.92] kind of like
[1264.00 - 1268.72] cower a little bit like
[1265.92 - 1270.08] bone it down like what
[1268.72 - 1271.76] really
[1270.08 - 1273.36] because you just get more mercury so
[1271.76 - 1275.12] when you have your brain fog or you're
[1273.36 - 1277.84] going to feed your brain fog more and
[1275.12 - 1277.84] more and more
[1278.48 - 1282.48] our brains get mercury
[1280.80 - 1285.04] our brains get a lot of toxic heavy
[1282.48 - 1287.92] metals inside of them okay
[1285.04 - 1288.84] those metals start to rust and corrode
[1287.92 - 1292.08] and
[1288.84 - 1293.36] bleed those metals start to
[1292.08 - 1295.04] decay
[1293.36 - 1298.00] is what they do
[1295.04 - 1301.52] just like your mercury filling did in
[1298.00 - 1304.16] your tooth they break up they discharge
[1301.52 - 1306.24] they decay and the same thing happens
[1304.16 - 1308.24] with all the metal particles inside of
[1306.24 - 1310.08] our brain
[1308.24 - 1312.88] and those toxic heavy metals once they
[1310.08 - 1314.40] start coming apart
[1312.88 - 1315.60] outgassing
[1314.40 - 1317.20] rusting
[1315.60 - 1319.68] decaying
[1317.20 - 1322.96] right popping apart all those different
[1319.68 - 1324.72] molecules of toxic heavy metals
[1322.96 - 1327.52] they start to age
[1324.72 - 1329.92] and then it spreads to adjacent tissue
[1327.52 - 1331.92] and neurons and then your electrical
[1329.92 - 1333.52] field starts hitting more and more metal
[1331.92 - 1335.04] and more and more places and now you've
[1333.52 - 1336.80] got the brain fog and the brain fog's
[1335.04 - 1338.72] bad and the brain fog is worse and the
[1336.80 - 1340.00] brain fogs back and that's what happens
[1338.72 - 1342.56] right there
[1340.00 - 1343.52] and we get in trouble
[1342.56 - 1345.92] then
[1343.52 - 1347.68] if you got a viral issue too you've got
[1345.92 - 1349.20] a viral issue got the shingles
[1347.68 - 1352.16] epstein-barr
[1349.20 - 1353.76] hhv-6 set of megalovirs all the viruses
[1352.16 - 1355.36] that everybody walks around with the
[1353.76 - 1357.20] viruses
[1355.36 - 1358.88] the real virus is the ones that have
[1357.20 - 1361.52] been keeping everybody chronically ill
[1358.88 - 1364.16] the ones that trigger up
[1361.52 - 1366.00] when they get a bad flu or the plague
[1364.16 - 1367.68] and then boom they triggered up i don't
[1366.00 - 1369.28] know why i got the hearing problems now
[1367.68 - 1371.12] after the plague normally i have the
[1369.28 - 1373.12] tinnitus and the vertigo after playing
[1371.12 - 1375.44] that those are viral issues that's
[1373.12 - 1377.52] reactivated shingles reactivated
[1375.44 - 1379.28] epstein-barr reactivate viruses when you
[1377.52 - 1380.96] have the viruses
[1379.28 - 1382.56] you don't even need the plague you got
[1380.96 - 1384.40] the viruses
[1382.56 - 1386.40] right the viruses are feeding off those
[1384.40 - 1388.48] metals inside the body
[1386.40 - 1390.08] then they release neurotoxins and then
[1388.48 - 1391.84] we're even worse off with a brain fog
[1390.08 - 1393.60] you could have the worst brain fog your
[1391.84 - 1395.68] brain fog could get so bad you don't
[1393.60 - 1397.76] even know who you are sometimes that's
[1395.68 - 1399.44] how bad brain fog can get it could get
[1397.76 - 1401.20] really crazy
[1399.44 - 1402.56] so i'm in the brain fog section now i
[1401.20 - 1404.24] covered a little bit about the cause of
[1402.56 - 1406.64] brain fog something that
[1404.24 - 1408.24] you can't hear from a doctor something
[1406.64 - 1410.40] something that you can't hear from a
[1408.24 - 1412.56] practitioner unless they use medical
[1410.40 - 1414.80] medium info or they mutated medical
[1412.56 - 1416.64] medium info and added their own
[1414.80 - 1418.48] blend of something in there
[1416.64 - 1420.64] right so what's in here we got a fresh
[1418.48 - 1423.44] celery juice work up to 32 ounces every
[1420.64 - 1426.80] morning if that's all you can do
[1423.44 - 1426.80] just the fresh celery juice
[1426.88 - 1431.92] about you
[1429.28 - 1433.52] i never shame anybody i never shame
[1431.92 - 1435.44] anybody
[1433.52 - 1438.88] when it comes down to healing i know
[1435.44 - 1440.88] it's not easy we take one step at a time
[1438.88 - 1443.04] i'm not here
[1440.88 - 1444.48] to make things harder than they already
[1443.04 - 1446.40] are for so many sick people and
[1444.48 - 1447.60] chronically ill people
[1446.40 - 1449.28] i'm not
[1447.60 - 1450.40] i mean you can just get celery juice
[1449.28 - 1452.32] down i'm fine but you know what's gonna
[1450.40 - 1455.44] happen though right
[1452.32 - 1456.56] yeah that medical medium guy
[1455.44 - 1458.72] he's telling everybody they could be
[1456.56 - 1460.72] cured one shot would sell a glass of
[1458.72 - 1462.08] celery juice and they're cured medical
[1460.72 - 1463.60] medium is going to be clear every
[1462.08 - 1464.96] medical medium
[1463.60 - 1466.80] give it out a glass of celery juice
[1464.96 - 1468.56] everybody's cured one shot that's what
[1466.80 - 1470.64] they're saying let's write a let's write
[1468.56 - 1474.16] another media
[1470.64 - 1476.64] another media slander story
[1474.16 - 1478.32] right you guys know how it rolls it
[1476.64 - 1480.32] moves the needle for many people when
[1478.32 - 1482.40] you first take a few sips
[1480.32 - 1484.32] right but it's also a powerful healing
[1482.40 - 1485.76] tool coupled with a lot of medical
[1484.32 - 1489.52] medium tools
[1485.76 - 1492.00] combined with other medical medium tools
[1489.52 - 1494.32] to move the needle in some serious
[1492.00 - 1495.92] chronic illness brain fog or anything
[1494.32 - 1498.72] like that
[1495.92 - 1500.32] yeah i've seen people down celery juice
[1498.72 - 1502.96] for a week and boom their brain fog
[1500.32 - 1504.72] lifts i've also seen them need way more
[1502.96 - 1506.64] than that
[1504.72 - 1508.16] way more than this this is fresh celery
[1506.64 - 1509.44] juice so you might be somebody that
[1508.16 - 1510.88] needs a little bit more than celery
[1509.44 - 1512.24] juice so here you go here's cleanse the
[1510.88 - 1515.36] heel a minute
[1512.24 - 1517.84] and now it says celery force right by
[1515.36 - 1520.16] the way i took some before i came on
[1517.84 - 1522.08] and it's kicking in it's kicking in
[1520.16 - 1524.80] right celery force that's the vimergy
[1522.08 - 1526.80] celery force says that in there
[1524.80 - 1529.20] i took four capsules before coming on to
[1526.80 - 1530.76] this live just now
[1529.20 - 1534.80] so then there's
[1530.76 - 1538.44] 5mthf right so i see 5mthf
[1534.80 - 1541.76] in here so it says one capsule daily of
[1538.44 - 1543.52] 5mthf right the methylfolate one capsule
[1541.76 - 1547.04] daily
[1543.52 - 1549.68] actually says one capsule twice a day
[1547.04 - 1551.60] ashwagandha
[1549.68 - 1555.20] says ashwagandha
[1551.60 - 1558.40] right here one dropper full twice a day
[1555.20 - 1561.04] for brain fog ashwagandha so i'm doing
[1558.40 - 1562.56] one dropper full right there
[1561.04 - 1564.32] in the shot glass
[1562.56 - 1565.68] so what i like to do is i like to put up
[1564.32 - 1567.60] in the shot glass and i like to put a
[1565.68 - 1569.68] little bit of water and then then i'm
[1567.60 - 1573.76] good okay
[1569.68 - 1576.72] so we got that barley grass juice powder
[1573.76 - 1578.40] the barley grass cheese powder
[1576.72 - 1580.32] the supplements i use for my friends and
[1578.40 - 1581.36] family and for me that i recommend
[1580.32 - 1582.96] anything
[1581.36 - 1585.44] anytime a friend contacts me and says
[1582.96 - 1587.28] what do i take for this
[1585.44 - 1588.40] i'll be like make sure it's it's it you
[1587.28 - 1590.88] get that and they're like well what
[1588.40 - 1592.96] brand i'm like vimorji i'm not sponsored
[1590.88 - 1594.48] by these guys but the stuff is that good
[1592.96 - 1596.08] right that's the barley grass juice
[1594.48 - 1597.20] powder
[1596.08 - 1599.52] right
[1597.20 - 1602.40] it says cat's claw here it's interesting
[1599.52 - 1603.92] so it says cat's claw okay
[1602.40 - 1606.00] so
[1603.92 - 1609.04] there's a cat's glove
[1606.00 - 1610.88] now why would we need cats claw for
[1609.04 - 1613.12] brain fog
[1610.88 - 1616.08] because someone might have a really
[1613.12 - 1620.00] difficult case of brain fog where it's
[1616.08 - 1622.72] viral for sure not just metals maybe
[1620.00 - 1624.48] it's a lot of viral going on maybe they
[1622.72 - 1625.76] got the epstein barr and they got the
[1624.48 - 1627.68] shingles and they got some other ones
[1625.76 - 1629.76] and they're creating a lot of poison in
[1627.68 - 1632.00] their system and you want to do some
[1629.76 - 1634.64] viral killing
[1632.00 - 1637.76] some epstein-barr killing you want to do
[1634.64 - 1639.36] some shingles slaying so that's where
[1637.76 - 1641.76] you got the cat's cost so it's in the
[1639.36 - 1643.20] brain fog section right here cat's claw
[1641.76 - 1645.84] right there
[1643.20 - 1648.96] so what does it say for a dosage it says
[1645.84 - 1650.88] one drop or full twice a day
[1648.96 - 1652.80] one dropper full twice a day so let's
[1650.88 - 1655.12] put some cat's claw
[1652.80 - 1656.48] in there okay
[1655.12 - 1659.36] lemon balm
[1656.48 - 1661.04] lemon balm is anti-viral
[1659.36 - 1663.92] it's also
[1661.04 - 1666.16] healing for the nerves lemon balm is
[1663.92 - 1669.04] really soothing on the central nervous
[1666.16 - 1670.56] system incredible for panic attacks
[1669.04 - 1671.84] anytime i've had a family member a
[1670.56 - 1674.24] friend or anything say they have some
[1671.84 - 1675.76] anxiety or some panic attack or anytime
[1674.24 - 1677.76] i talk to a doctor that wants advice
[1675.76 - 1679.60] from me i'll be like make sure you do
[1677.76 - 1681.84] make sure you have your patients do the
[1679.60 - 1684.80] lemon bomb for panic attacks you can you
[1681.84 - 1687.68] can do a lot of lemon balm
[1684.80 - 1691.04] so important so important one dropper
[1687.68 - 1692.32] full twice a day it says for brain fog
[1691.04 - 1694.40] so i'm going to put a dropper full of
[1692.32 - 1697.04] lemon balm in there
[1694.40 - 1698.40] if you guys don't mind right
[1697.04 - 1701.52] see that
[1698.40 - 1703.04] got a drop on the book
[1701.52 - 1704.96] so let's see what else we got going on
[1703.04 - 1706.64] the chaga mushroom
[1704.96 - 1708.96] we you know beverage has a chaga
[1706.64 - 1712.48] mushroom i didn't put it out just now
[1708.96 - 1712.48] the limit licorice root
[1713.28 - 1717.28] so why would we use licorice root for
[1715.36 - 1718.24] brain fog
[1717.28 - 1721.44] why
[1718.24 - 1724.16] antiviral licorice root is anti
[1721.44 - 1726.24] epstein-barr the very thing behind one
[1724.16 - 1728.48] of the very things next to metals is the
[1726.24 - 1730.88] epson bar right the very thing behind
[1728.48 - 1733.20] brain fog so you see licorice roots here
[1730.88 - 1735.76] one dropper full
[1733.20 - 1735.76] that in there
[1737.36 - 1742.72] all right nettle leaf it's interesting
[1740.96 - 1745.04] spirit of compassion wants a metal leaf
[1742.72 - 1747.04] in here one dropper full twice a day of
[1745.04 - 1749.28] the nettle leaf so you got the metal
[1747.04 - 1750.80] leaf now look you could be somebody i
[1749.28 - 1755.44] don't want anybody overwhelmed you can
[1750.80 - 1757.36] be somebody that just does one thing
[1755.44 - 1759.92] you can be somebody that just does a
[1757.36 - 1763.60] couple of things here because the b12 is
[1759.92 - 1764.48] coming up so it says b12 all right
[1763.60 - 1766.88] so

[1771.60 - 1776.72] b12 one dropper full twice a day b12

[2385.04 - 2389.28] different liver issues right
[2388.08 - 2391.04] so
[2389.28 - 2393.04] we're talking about eczema right now so
[2391.04 - 2394.72] how many people are dealing with eczema
[2393.04 - 2397.12] let's go into that so i'm in the
[2394.72 - 2400.88] protocol for eczema and let's go into
[2397.12 - 2402.96] the true causes of eczema right now
[2400.88 - 2404.48] let's go into that a little bit
[2402.96 - 2405.36] so i'm going to move the book over a
[2404.48 - 2408.36] touch
[2405.36 - 2408.36] okay
[2414.00 - 2416.72] somehow
[2415.20 - 2419.36] some way
[2416.72 - 2422.96] in somebody's life
[2419.36 - 2425.44] something moved into the liver
[2422.96 - 2426.64] something what is it what moved into
[2425.44 - 2429.52] their liver
[2426.64 - 2432.96] somewhere maybe they drank
[2429.52 - 2434.48] water that went through copper pipes
[2432.96 - 2436.32] maybe
[2434.48 - 2437.60] they had
[2436.32 - 2440.32] copper
[2437.60 - 2443.28] from some other water contamination in a
[2440.32 - 2444.24] restaurant when they got their coffee
[2443.28 - 2447.92] maybe
[2444.24 - 2450.16] their family members had ddt already
[2447.92 - 2451.76] inside of them which is high in copper
[2450.16 - 2454.24] ddt
[2451.76 - 2455.92] and that ddt passed down from generation
[2454.24 - 2457.36] to generation
[2455.92 - 2460.08] maybe
[2457.36 - 2462.00] someone had pharmaceuticals
[2460.08 - 2463.92] that were high in copper because all
[2462.00 - 2467.84] pharmaceuticals are high in toxic heavy
[2463.92 - 2471.36] metals and somehow that copper found its
[2467.84 - 2472.64] way inside their liver
[2471.36 - 2474.88] right
[2472.64 - 2477.60] and then that copper sat there it was
[2474.88 - 2478.48] fine that that copper sat there that was
[2477.60 - 2480.96] okay
[2478.48 - 2483.44] so right if the copper sat there right
[2480.96 - 2484.72] let the copper sit in somebody's liver
[2483.44 - 2487.36] that's fine
[2484.72 - 2488.80] that's fine but then one day
[2487.36 - 2490.24] one day
[2488.80 - 2491.84] that person
[2490.24 - 2492.84] whoever that is
[2491.84 - 2495.92] ended up
[2492.84 - 2497.92] contracting an epstein-barr virus
[2495.92 - 2500.88] the epstein barr
[2497.92 - 2502.24] and maybe that epstein barr was passed
[2500.88 - 2504.00] down
[2502.24 - 2507.20] from their parents generation to
[2504.00 - 2509.12] generation in the womb as a child
[2507.20 - 2511.76] maybe the epstein barr
[2509.12 - 2515.20] was passed around in college
[2511.76 - 2517.68] maybe it was that first person that you
[2515.20 - 2520.56] know someone became intimate with and
[2517.68 - 2523.28] that partner in life or anybody and that
[2520.56 - 2526.08] was passed along maybe they drank out of
[2523.28 - 2527.92] a glass at a restaurant an epstein-barr
[2526.08 - 2530.40] was on that glass stuck in somebody's
[2527.92 - 2532.08] lipstick or stuck in some guy's saliva
[2530.40 - 2534.32] that wasn't washed off the glass good
[2532.08 - 2536.40] enough at the restaurant
[2534.32 - 2538.24] maybe they'd have seen bar was on a
[2536.40 - 2539.60] toilet seat somewhere
[2538.24 - 2541.20] and someone's
[2539.60 - 2543.76] put their butt right down on the toilet
[2541.20 - 2545.92] seat and picked up that epstein bar
[2543.76 - 2548.56] and found its way inside of them
[2545.92 - 2550.40] but they got the epstein-barr virus an
[2548.56 - 2551.52] epstein-barr
[2550.40 - 2553.84] has
[2551.52 - 2555.60] a really good relationship with copper
[2553.84 - 2557.52] the copper was in the liver and the
[2555.60 - 2560.80] epstein bar is now in the liver and that
[2557.52 - 2562.08] epstein bar feeds off of copper inside
[2560.80 - 2563.36] the liver
[2562.08 - 2565.44] you see
[2563.36 - 2567.44] and as that epson bar is eating all that
[2565.44 - 2569.68] copper particles that were trapped
[2567.44 - 2573.20] inside that liver and somebody that i've
[2569.68 - 2575.92] seen bar got so full and so fat and
[2573.20 - 2577.20] happy and so stuffed as if it was
[2575.92 - 2580.08] thanksgiving
[2577.20 - 2581.92] that the epstein bar burped
[2580.08 - 2584.56] and pooped
[2581.92 - 2586.40] out that copper
[2584.56 - 2588.72] and that copper poop
[2586.40 - 2592.24] in that copper burp
[2588.72 - 2593.36] outgassed a copper neurotoxin but that's
[2592.24 - 2596.00] okay
[2593.36 - 2598.08] that copper neurotoxin sat inside the
[2596.00 - 2600.24] liver for the first six months of that
[2598.08 - 2603.44] person's time with all this and then
[2600.24 - 2604.96] that copper neurotoxin that the virus
[2603.44 - 2606.64] pooped out
[2604.96 - 2608.56] and excreted out
[2606.64 - 2610.32] stayed inside the liver for longer and
[2608.56 - 2611.12] longer and then that liver finally got
[2610.32 - 2614.80] so
[2611.12 - 2617.80] tired of holding on to all that copper
[2614.80 - 2617.80] dermatoxin
[2618.08 - 2623.20] that it puffed out of the liver
[2620.40 - 2624.96] and that copper dermatoxin puffed and
[2623.20 - 2628.24] puffed out of the liver and then it
[2624.96 - 2630.56] started heading to the outer regions of
[2628.24 - 2633.12] the skin in the derma
[2630.56 - 2635.84] and that person got their eczema and
[2633.12 - 2638.08] their psoriasis
[2635.84 - 2639.92] and that's the cause of eczema psoriasis
[2638.08 - 2641.76] story time i thought i would do a story
[2639.92 - 2643.44] time on the cause of eczema and
[2641.76 - 2646.16] psoriasis
[2643.44 - 2648.08] so what do we do about it fine
[2646.16 - 2650.96] fine
[2648.08 - 2653.04] someone might say you convinced me
[2650.96 - 2656.80] what do we do about it we got to get one
[2653.04 - 2658.72] or two one or the other out of the liver
[2656.80 - 2661.12] we got to get the virus out of liver the
[2658.72 - 2664.16] epstein-barr virus or we have to get the
[2661.12 - 2666.80] copper out which one would you like
[2664.16 - 2668.08] which one do you want to get out i don't
[2666.80 - 2670.08] care which one
[2668.08 - 2671.60] you want to get out the viral issue get
[2670.08 - 2673.36] out the virus you want to get out the
[2671.60 - 2675.52] copper and get out the copper because in
[2673.36 - 2678.48] this book cleanse the heel you can do
[2675.52 - 2680.56] the heavy metal detox cleanse
[2678.48 - 2683.04] you can do the heavy metal detox
[2680.56 - 2686.40] smoothie you can have like you know the
[2683.04 - 2687.76] vimergy spirulina or demergy barley
[2686.40 - 2689.52] grass

[2689.52 - 2693.20] metal detox smoothie you can have the
[2691.44 - 2695.28] dolls right
[2693.20 - 2698.16] there's the dolls liquid
[2695.28 - 2701.28] okay you can put that in there
[2698.16 - 2702.88] but you can get the copper out
[2701.28 - 2705.04] there's a way to get it out and when you
[2702.88 - 2706.56] get the copper out if that's the route
[2705.04 - 2708.40] you want to go you want to go with
[2706.56 - 2710.96] getting the metal out
[2708.40 - 2713.04] hey you can get rid of your eczema
[2710.96 - 2714.56] you can get rid of it
[2713.04 - 2716.48] and if you want to go the route of
[2714.56 - 2719.28] getting the epstein bar out you can do
[2716.48 - 2721.20] that too then you go with the anti
[2719.28 - 2723.36] epstein-barr
[2721.20 - 2724.88] anti-epstein bar option
[2723.36 - 2727.52] and you can get
[2724.88 - 2730.00] the viral issue out
[2727.52 - 2731.20] of your liver
[2730.00 - 2733.28] so that's
[2731.20 - 2735.68] eczema okay
[2733.28 - 2738.08] one or more of the 60 varieties of fcmr
[2735.68 - 2740.88] virus living inside the liver feeding
[2738.08 - 2743.68] on an abundance of the toxic heavy metal
[2740.88 - 2746.00] copper releasing a copper-infused
[2743.68 - 2748.88] dermatoxin that circulates throughout
[2746.00 - 2751.84] the body and can't detoxify properly due
[2748.88 - 2753.68] to a high fat high protein diet whether
[2751.84 - 2756.80] it's plant-based or animal-based there's
[2753.68 - 2758.16] no there's no uh being biased against
[2756.80 - 2760.08] one or the other
[2758.16 - 2762.08] you can do a high-protein plant-based
[2760.08 - 2763.76] diet a high-fat plant-based
[2762.08 - 2765.60] plant-based diet you can do a high-fat
[2763.76 - 2767.36] high-protein animal-based diet doesn't
[2765.60 - 2769.36] matter
[2767.36 - 2771.20] and other food choices that are
[2769.36 - 2773.12] unproductive to the condition when these
[2771.20 - 2775.12] dermatoxins float to the surface of the
[2773.12 - 2777.36] skin they cause the source and rashing
[2775.12 - 2778.88] of eczema psoriasis
[2777.36 - 2782.80] with vitiligo
[2778.88 - 2785.84] it's an aluminum-based dermatoxin it's
[2782.80 - 2788.64] an aluminum-based dermatoxin different
[2785.84 - 2790.32] pathogen toxin brews are are behind
[2788.64 - 2792.72] different varieties of these skin
[2790.32 - 2794.48] conditions so that's right there so what
[2792.72 - 2796.64] do we do
[2794.48 - 2799.60] what do we do about eczema
[2796.64 - 2801.36] right so let's go to page 509 where it
[2799.60 - 2803.68] is that's where xm is i just lost the
[2801.36 - 2805.12] page okay
[2803.68 - 2807.52] here we are
[2805.12 - 2809.52] and it says fresh celery juice
[2807.52 - 2810.96] fresh celery juice if that's all you can
[2809.52 - 2813.12] do let's do that
[2810.96 - 2816.72] and that's all you can do
[2813.12 - 2820.48] let's do it let's do it why not it also
[2816.72 - 2822.72] has five mta five five mthf here because
[2820.48 - 2824.80] i like that for helping the skin
[2822.72 - 2827.28] but you'll see in here there's cat's
[2824.80 - 2831.40] claw you'll see in here lemon balm
[2827.28 - 2831.40] licorice fruit l-lysine
[2831.68 - 2837.84] l-lysine for the epstein bar right and
[2835.28 - 2840.40] i'll say the dosage for 500 milligram
[2837.84 - 2842.40] capsules twice a day if you can only do
[2840.40 - 2844.16] one capsule once a day that's where you
[2842.40 - 2845.84] start talk to your doctor see what's
[2844.16 - 2847.36] right for you maybe you're somebody
[2845.84 - 2849.52] that's sensitive you just want to do one
[2847.36 - 2852.08] little thing because you've tried so
[2849.52 - 2854.16] many bad things and things that were not
[2852.08 - 2856.00] good that you just you got burned too
[2854.16 - 2859.84] many times and now you're scared you say
[2856.00 - 2859.84] okay well i'll do one thing
[2860.08 - 2864.96] and then it says mullin leaf it says
[2862.16 - 2868.00] nettle leaf it says spirulina it says
[2864.96 - 2872.24] the b12 the zinc the c right
[2868.00 - 2873.76] so it shows in here an anti epstein-barr
[2872.24 - 2876.72] protocol
[2873.76 - 2878.56] but it also shows the spirulina
[2876.72 - 2881.04] right and the barley grass juice powder
[2878.56 - 2883.92] because you're doing an anti-copper
[2881.04 - 2885.84] based metal protocol
[2883.92 - 2887.60] it's like hey someone wants to get
[2885.84 - 2890.00] better
[2887.60 - 2891.92] there are answers out there there are
[2890.00 - 2894.88] answers out there
[2891.92 - 2896.48] is adults tincture better than flakes
[2894.88 - 2899.04] you could do either or
[2896.48 - 2900.56] either or adults tincture or the flags
[2899.04 - 2902.56] like right if you got the flakes use the
[2900.56 - 2903.84] flakes so if you got the flakes use the
[2902.56 - 2906.00] flakes
[2903.84 - 2907.84] right this is just so easy for me
[2906.00 - 2910.48] because a lot of times i can't find the
[2907.84 - 2913.04] flakes i can't find adults i run out all
[2910.48 - 2916.32] the time so this is just this is so easy
[2913.04 - 2918.80] for me and what i like about the dulce
[2916.32 - 2921.52] the dulce liquid right is all of it's
[2918.80 - 2922.96] there to grab onto the metal and i know
[2921.52 - 2925.44] because
[2922.96 - 2928.48] all of the chemical compounds are there
[2925.44 - 2930.24] to grab onto metal and pull metal out so
[2928.48 - 2932.24] i just i just love it
[2930.24 - 2934.24] atlantic dolls tincture that's the
[2932.24 - 2935.68] vimergy if you don't know the company
[2934.24 - 2937.92] i'm not sponsored by the guys but it's
[2935.68 - 2940.84] vimergy v is in victor i am as
[2937.92 - 2943.84] amerigy.com
[2940.84 - 2945.52] ray so we're talking about eczema let's
[2943.84 - 2947.12] hit vertigo really quick let's look for
[2945.52 - 2948.88] vertigo
[2947.12 - 2951.84] so i'm going there now
[2948.88 - 2953.76] i think it's on 550.
[2951.84 - 2955.92] so a lot of conditions a lot of symptoms
[2953.76 - 2958.00] in here so let's try to let's try to get
[2955.92 - 2960.80] there we'll find that
[2958.00 - 2963.44] here it is so we got vertigo
[2960.80 - 2965.76] okay so vertigo is the vagus nerve
[2963.44 - 2968.16] everybody needs to know that april taft
[2965.76 - 2970.56] says can you explain how eczema heals
[2968.16 - 2971.60] does it constantly
[2970.56 - 2973.68] how it
[2971.60 - 2975.44] here's how it works right the minute you
[2973.68 - 2977.52] start cleaning up your liver
[2975.44 - 2979.44] you start cleaning that up if that liver
[2977.52 - 2982.96] is filled up with a lot of dermatoxin
[2979.44 - 2985.04] from the virus or a lot of copper right
[2982.96 - 2986.88] it gets sludgy it gets packed in there
[2985.04 - 2988.96] so as you're trying to heal your liver
[2986.88 - 2991.36] is going to be puffing out a lot of that
[2988.96 - 2993.20] old copper a lot of that old dermatox
[2991.36 - 2995.28] and a lot of that old viral byproduct
[2993.20 - 2997.44] right it's going to be puffing it out so
[2995.28 - 2999.52] you you get your healing it's not
[2997.44 - 3001.28] unusual to have moments where it's up
[2999.52 - 3003.52] and down i always say three steps up two
[3001.28 - 3005.44] steps back three sips up two steps back
[3003.52 - 3007.60] so you're going up right eventually once
[3005.44 - 3010.24] your liver clears up with enough of that
[3007.60 - 3012.24] now you're home free it's less and less
[3010.24 - 3014.08] less and less less and less and then
[3012.24 - 3015.92] it's gone so many people you've seen how
[3014.08 - 3017.52] many people got worse got rid of the
[3015.92 - 3018.72] worst skin conditions and medical medium
[3017.52 - 3020.08] information by the way that's never
[3018.72 - 3022.16] happened before in chronic illness
[3020.08 - 3024.32] anywhere in history
[3022.16 - 3026.00] and that's what's incredible about it
[3024.32 - 3027.68] someone might have a more aggressive
[3026.00 - 3030.40] viral condition that takes a little bit
[3027.68 - 3032.16] more of a makes a little bit more work
[3030.40 - 3033.84] well that's why the protocols are here
[3032.16 - 3036.72] you can take it as far as you need to go
[3033.84 - 3037.60] to keep on getting a more aggressive bug
[3036.72 - 3039.76] out
[3037.60 - 3040.40] right or if you got a lot of copper in
[3039.76 - 3042.00] there
[3040.40 - 3044.00] it takes a little time to get the copper
[3042.00 - 3045.20] out but one is going to get one is going
[3044.00 - 3046.96] to give it's going to be either the
[3045.20 - 3048.80] viral issue is going to give give and
[3046.96 - 3050.72] boom or it's going to be the copper is
[3048.80 - 3053.44] going to get and boom and then you're
[3050.72 - 3055.36] home free so many people have
[3053.44 - 3056.16] riddled with eczema
[3055.36 - 3058.64] and
[3056.16 - 3060.80] and just and it's gone right so let's
[3058.64 - 3064.56] talk about vertigo a little bit
[3060.80 - 3066.08] vertigo is the vagus nerves
[3064.56 - 3067.52] the vagus
[3066.08 - 3070.08] nerves
[3067.52 - 3073.28] that's what vertigo is right
[3070.08 - 3074.96] so keep in mind so the vertigo
[3073.28 - 3076.40] also when someone has vertigo i mean
[3074.96 - 3078.96] they can have tightness of the chest
[3076.40 - 3080.96] they can have tightness of the throat
[3078.96 - 3082.88] they can feel not just dizzy and have
[3080.96 - 3084.88] the balance issues somebody with vertigo
[3082.88 - 3088.08] can have even more than that so not just
[3084.88 - 3089.52] dizziness and and the balance issues
[3088.08 - 3091.52] it's you can have tightness to the chest
[3089.52 - 3094.48] you get crippling anxiety when you when
[3091.52 - 3096.96] your vagus nerves are inflamed crippling
[3094.48 - 3098.96] anxiety panic attacks a lot of people
[3096.96 - 3100.88] have panic attack where they're just
[3098.96 - 3103.12] panic attacks all the time their heart's
[3100.88 - 3104.72] going they're panic attacking everywhere
[3103.12 - 3107.52] they're nervous they're scared you know
[3104.72 - 3109.28] because they're so ptsd from their panic
[3107.52 - 3110.80] attacks that's another thing you get the
[3109.28 - 3113.28] post-traumatic stress syndrome from
[3110.80 - 3114.72] having so much anxiety right and that's
[3113.28 - 3116.64] really difficult for so many and the
[3114.72 - 3119.60] vagus nerves are inflamed so when the
[3116.64 - 3121.12] vagus nerves come out of the brain stem
[3119.60 - 3122.80] and they come out of that brain stem
[3121.12 - 3125.68] right so when the vagus nerves come out
[3122.80 - 3127.44] of there okay and there's then now
[3125.68 - 3129.04] they're traveling and they're going in a
[3127.44 - 3130.80] couple of different directions hitting
[3129.04 - 3132.72] every single almost every single nerve
[3130.80 - 3135.28] an intestinal tract hitting nerves in
[3132.72 - 3137.76] the heart right when those vagus nerves
[3135.28 - 3139.92] get inflamed
[3137.76 - 3143.28] that's when anything could go wrong with
[3139.92 - 3144.88] the vertigo at any moment because the
[3143.28 - 3146.72] brain stem
[3144.88 - 3149.36] vagus nerves coming out of the brain
[3146.72 - 3151.28] stem get inflamed up there by the brain
[3149.36 - 3153.52] stem
[3151.28 - 3155.04] and then boom you're in vertigo boom
[3153.52 - 3156.64] you're in vertigo
[3155.04 - 3158.72] that's where you are
[3156.64 - 3160.56] and now you're getting the bed spins the
[3158.72 - 3162.00] room's spinning you're getting the spins
[3160.56 - 3163.76] you close your eyes and everything's
[3162.00 - 3165.52] moving this way you know and going like
[3163.76 - 3167.68] this over and over again where you close
[3165.52 - 3169.36] your eyes and then you're literally you
[3167.68 - 3171.04] you have to sit so still as you're
[3169.36 - 3173.68] spinning and then you you turn over and
[3171.04 - 3176.08] you you vomit on the floor you know so
[3173.68 - 3177.68] many people just vomit they can't help
[3176.08 - 3179.36] it they're spinning so much that they
[3177.68 - 3181.84] have a bedpan where they vomit in the
[3179.36 - 3183.60] bedpan some people can't walk they're so
[3181.84 - 3185.76] dizzy and it starts hitting them or they
[3183.60 - 3187.04] go down where they're walking and all
[3185.76 - 3188.88] they're walking along and all of a
[3187.04 - 3190.56] sudden they start going down like they
[3188.88 - 3192.24] feel like they're going down even though
[3190.56 - 3193.76] they're standing upright they feel like
[3192.24 - 3195.76] they're going down that's the kind of
[3193.76 - 3197.84] vertigo they have
[3195.76 - 3199.68] okay so they have all these different
[3197.84 - 3202.80] renditions so many people have this
[3199.68 - 3205.36] where the vertigo is just out of control
[3202.80 - 3206.84] and what that is is that's the vagus
[3205.36 - 3209.84] nerves being
[3206.84 - 3211.44] inflamed but what are they inflamed with
[3209.84 - 3213.28] medical medium information teaches
[3211.44 - 3215.84] people why they're inflamed
[3213.28 - 3217.84] okay and so when you look at that you're
[3215.84 - 3220.32] like why are they inflamed like what's
[3217.84 - 3222.48] going on true cause epstein-barr virus
[3220.32 - 3223.92] epstein-barr virus neurotoxins wreak a
[3222.48 - 3225.52] lot of havoc
[3223.92 - 3228.08] they create fibromyalgia they create
[3225.52 - 3231.12] vertigo they create tinnitus there's
[3228.08 - 3233.44] over 60 varieties of epsom bar
[3231.12 - 3235.44] and different epstein bars do different
[3233.44 - 3238.40] things some aggravate
[3235.44 - 3240.40] aggravate aggravate um vagus nerves like
[3238.40 - 3243.04] no other virus does
[3240.40 - 3246.32] and if you're high in toxic heavy metals
[3243.04 - 3248.96] then there's even more chances of having
[3246.32 - 3251.36] a vertigo that sticks around and keeps
[3248.96 - 3253.52] the brain stem area and the vagus nerves
[3251.36 - 3255.68] and everything inflamed this is all
[3253.52 - 3257.84] original medical medium information
[3255.68 - 3260.00] which leads to that whole thing where
[3257.84 - 3261.76] you know everybody takes a nugget they
[3260.00 - 3263.36] go out there somewhere and drop the
[3261.76 - 3264.80] nugget off somewhere nobody knows where
[3263.36 - 3266.88] it came from and they'll never know how
[3264.80 - 3269.28] to really heal
[3266.88 - 3270.56] so veneers
[3269.28 - 3272.00] is
[3270.56 - 3274.64] made up
[3272.00 - 3276.00] so we have to know that so meniere's
[3274.64 - 3279.12] disease
[3276.00 - 3280.80] where you have crystals in your ear
[3279.12 - 3283.44] is a theory
[3280.80 - 3284.24] just critical to know
[3283.44 - 3286.16] all
[3284.24 - 3288.16] vertigo
[3286.16 - 3289.68] that's mysterious
[3288.16 - 3292.16] because meniere's is
[3289.68 - 3293.92] just mysterious because they're just
[3292.16 - 3296.32] theorizing saying maybe it's these
[3293.92 - 3298.16] crystals in somebody's ear well
[3296.32 - 3300.32] that was
[3298.16 - 3302.16] a funny theory when you're 60 years old
[3300.32 - 3305.04] because that's what happened back back
[3302.16 - 3306.64] 30 years ago back 30 40 40 years ago if
[3305.04 - 3309.36] you were 60 years old 50 years old you
[3306.64 - 3312.16] got your first bout of vertigo
[3309.36 - 3313.28] because young people didn't get vertigo
[3312.16 - 3314.24] by the way
[3313.28 - 3316.80] rare
[3314.24 - 3319.60] rare a 20 year old a 19 year old a 17
[3316.80 - 3322.96] year old ever got vertigo it was only 60
[3319.60 - 3325.04] year olds 70 year olds 80 year olds
[3322.96 - 3327.36] 50 year olds back 40 years ago it was
[3325.04 - 3329.60] only 50 year olds it was rare was ever a
[3327.36 - 3332.08] 40 year old that got vertigo yeah you'd
[3329.60 - 3334.32] get that occasional 30 38 year old or
[3332.08 - 3337.28] something a 35 year old but it was rare
[3334.32 - 3339.28] vertigo mysterious vertigo was always
[3337.28 - 3341.52] for people that were in their 60s or 70s
[3339.28 - 3343.28] or 80s back 40 50 years ago remember
[3341.52 - 3345.28] talking to doctors a long time ago
[3343.28 - 3347.28] they'd be like oh yeah it's vertigo
[3345.28 - 3349.04] cases are people that are in their 70s
[3347.28 - 3350.16] you know in my practice another doctor
[3349.04 - 3351.52] like people in their 80s and other
[3350.16 - 3353.44] people be like yeah i had a few that are
[3351.52 - 3356.00] in their 50s but that's years ago right
[3353.44 - 3357.92] now you're 20 you're 19 years old you're
[3356.00 - 3359.68] 21 years old you're 25 years old and
[3357.92 - 3362.24] everybody's got vertigo now so what
[3359.68 - 3365.76] happened did the crystals change did the
[3362.24 - 3367.04] crystals pick a different age bracket
[3365.76 - 3369.04] i'm kind of curious on that because i
[3367.04 - 3371.76] scratch my head all the time they always
[3369.04 - 3373.28] said when you're 80 years old you got
[3371.76 - 3375.44] meniere's that's what your vertigo is
[3373.28 - 3377.04] it's crystals in your ear
[3375.44 - 3379.76] because you know you've got crystals in
[3377.04 - 3381.76] your okay well that it's only for older
[3379.76 - 3384.16] people because young people don't have
[3381.76 - 3386.40] crystals crystals don't exist in young
[3384.16 - 3388.16] people's ears okay i'm scratching my
[3386.40 - 3390.32] head on that one because everybody in
[3388.16 - 3392.08] their 20s now has vertigo they're all
[3390.32 - 3394.72] getting sick with vertigo and they don't
[3392.08 - 3396.48] have crystals so i'm kind of confused
[3394.72 - 3398.24] there did the crystals all of a sudden
[3396.48 - 3400.16] change their job
[3398.24 - 3402.80] because i'd like to know that
[3400.16 - 3404.32] did the so-called crystals these this
[3402.80 - 3406.72] theory of crystals from the medical
[3404.32 - 3409.04] establishment did they change their age
[3406.72 - 3411.12] bracket of what they're targeting
[3409.04 - 3411.84] are they like are they like some kind of
[3411.12 - 3414.40] like
[3411.84 - 3416.56] demographic social media demographic
[3414.40 - 3418.88] crystals all get together around a round
[3416.56 - 3420.00] table i think to all these crystals get
[3418.88 - 3421.28] together
[3420.00 - 3424.40] and they're all talking to each other
[3421.28 - 3426.16] like hey by the way let's go start uh
[3424.40 - 3428.08] causing vertigo in a 20 year old for the
[3426.16 - 3429.84] first time in history
[3428.08 - 3431.92] no the crystals didn't change their
[3429.84 - 3433.84] demographic they didn't change their age
[3431.92 - 3435.68] bracket they didn't change anything the
[3433.84 - 3437.52] crystals weren't the reason why anybody
[3435.68 - 3439.76] had vertigo was always viral it's
[3437.52 - 3441.84] because the vagus nerves get inflamed
[3439.76 - 3443.68] here's the problem people in their 20s
[3441.84 - 3445.36] now are all getting inflamed vagus
[3443.68 - 3447.92] nerves people in their 20s people in
[3445.36 - 3450.08] their 30s people in their teens are all
[3447.92 - 3452.00] getting inflamed vagus nerves and that's
[3450.08 - 3453.84] why they end up getting the vertigo it's
[3452.00 - 3454.96] the epstein-barr
[3453.84 - 3457.04] causing
[3454.96 - 3458.88] it's the epidemic of the epstein barr
[3457.04 - 3460.40] the different varieties the fact that it
[3458.88 - 3462.16] went rampant the fact that it's been
[3460.40 - 3463.60] passed around over and over again all
[3462.16 - 3466.56] around the world the fact that everybody
[3463.60 - 3466.56] has epstein-barr
[3466.88 - 3472.08] yeah
