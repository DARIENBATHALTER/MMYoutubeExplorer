[3.12 - 7.68] clubhouse making the tomato cucumber and
[5.92 - 8.56] herb salad we're talking about digestive
[7.68 - 10.40] problems
[8.56 - 12.48] digestive issues how many of you guys
[10.40 - 13.76] have digestive problems and how serious
[12.48 - 15.20] are they are they in your way
[13.76 - 17.52] do you have the acid reflux they have
[15.20 - 19.12] the crohn's colitis you have the gastric
[17.52 - 22.48] bloating the cramps
[19.12 - 24.16] the constipation do you have the runs
[22.48 - 25.84] you'll have the loose stools which is
[24.16 - 28.80] kind of a funny one because
[25.84 - 29.52] i'd rather have the loose stools instead
[28.80 - 32.72] of
[29.52 - 35.44] cramping bloating can't get
[32.72 - 36.80] a really hard stool out the hard stool
[35.44 - 38.88] will not come out
[36.80 - 40.80] you know that was a head scratcher for
[38.88 - 42.48] me for years because
[40.80 - 44.00] over the years helping so many people
[42.48 - 46.08] for decades people come into my
[44.00 - 47.28] office i'd hear that somebody like well
[46.08 - 48.88] i'm only here for
[47.28 - 52.56] these loose stools and i'm like all
[48.88 - 54.80] right well how loose are these stools
[52.56 - 56.32] and the person i've heard this so many
[54.80 - 57.36] times personally like you know they're
[56.32 - 60.88] kind of like not
[57.36 - 63.28] that hard they're not formed enough
[60.88 - 65.28] they're not they're not good enough and
[63.28 - 66.96] i'm like but you're okay otherwise right
[65.28 - 68.48] i'm like yeah i'm okay otherwise but i
[66.96 - 70.72] just got these kind of
[68.48 - 72.24] loose stools and i'm like you know what
[70.72 - 76.24] that's that's actually
[72.24 - 78.32] okay that's actually okay anyway um
[76.24 - 81.20] so people deal with bloating they got
[78.32 - 84.08] sibo they get told they got candida
[81.20 - 86.00] they got hives right the whole bit
[84.08 - 87.44] they're told their histamines are up
[86.00 - 89.60] they're told they got the fructose
[87.44 - 91.28] intolerance they're told a lot of things
[89.60 - 92.80] but they deal with a lot of gut problems
[91.28 - 94.32] of rounded all around and everything
[92.80 - 95.28] good to see you guys we're live on
[94.32 - 96.96] facebook youtube
[95.28 - 98.88] yep we're live on tick tock right there
[96.96 - 101.28] clubhouse 2 at the same time
[98.88 - 102.64] going gonna make a raw dish which is
[101.28 - 105.68] really good and guess what
[102.64 - 107.04] fat-free raw dish because everybody's
[105.68 - 108.56] fatting themselves to death
[107.04 - 110.08] fatting themselves to death that's what
[108.56 - 112.72] they're doing like
[110.08 - 113.52] fat fat veg gotta be tahini tahini oil
[112.72 - 116.00] oil
[113.52 - 116.72] you know nuts seeds nut butters peanut
[116.00 - 119.60] butter
[116.72 - 120.32] the milk cheese eggs butter butter cow
[119.60 - 122.40] butter
[120.32 - 123.84] just whatever uh you know anything
[122.40 - 125.44] sheep's butter whatever they can find
[123.84 - 128.16] it's just like that fat
[125.44 - 129.44] and that's all that's all fine and all
[128.16 - 131.12] until you're sick
[129.44 - 132.64] got the gallstones you got the kidney
[131.12 - 134.32] stones you got the liver problems you
[132.64 - 135.44] got the weight gain coming on later on
[134.32 - 136.48] down the road
[135.44 - 137.76] and then you get rid of all those
[136.48 - 139.28] processed foods all those processed
[137.76 - 140.64] foods and you're still on fat fat
[139.28 - 142.40] then you go vegan and plant-based and
[140.64 - 144.64] you're still tanking the fat that that
[142.40 - 146.56] and then your digestive system just
[144.64 - 148.48] starts to break down more and more
[146.56 - 150.24] even if you made improvements it still
[148.48 - 151.84] starts to break down and we end up in
[150.24 - 152.88] the same place and now we're like i'm
[151.84 - 155.92] eating so good
[152.88 - 157.68] i'm eating so great i'm eating so good
[155.92 - 158.80] why is this happening i'm a vegan and
[157.68 - 161.12] i'm eating so good

[161.12 - 165.20] i'm eating so clean
[162.56 - 167.04] but why am i still getting sick again
[165.20 - 168.40] because those digestive problems get
[167.04 - 170.00] worse and worse because no one's

[562.64 - 568.64] many people so
[564.88 - 570.40] um anka says gastroparesis question mark
[568.64 - 572.40] can you talk more about it
[570.40 - 573.52] what happens when you eat too much at
[572.40 - 574.56] once
[573.52 - 577.12] if you're somebody that's really
[574.56 - 580.24] sensitive you got to keep in mind if you
[577.12 - 582.24] haven't been eating a lot like you
[580.24 - 583.76] haven't been eating a lot okay it's not
[582.24 - 585.44] something that you do you don't eat a
[583.76 - 586.16] lot at once you don't eat a lot of food
[585.44 - 588.96] at once
[586.16 - 588.96] keep in mind
[589.36 - 593.68] that when you start eating more you're
[592.40 - 597.36] going to feel it
[593.68 - 600.00] because the intestinal tract shrinks
[597.36 - 602.24] that's how it works and a lot of us lose
[600.00 - 604.40] our elastasicity in our intestinal tract
[602.24 - 607.52] or small intestinal tract
[604.40 - 609.76] it starts to harden up a little bit if
[607.52 - 610.56] we've been eating the wrong foods for so
[609.76 - 612.72] many years
[610.56 - 615.36] we got pathogens and toxic heavy metals
[612.72 - 618.72] inside our gut because it happens a lot
[615.36 - 620.80] and what goes on is then you start
[618.72 - 622.72] eating more so you start eating a big
[620.80 - 623.76] meal at once and you got a really large
[622.72 - 626.56] meal
[623.76 - 627.84] and what happens is that that large meal
[626.56 - 630.64] starts to push
[627.84 - 631.68] through the small intestinal tract and
[630.64 - 633.52] we can really
[631.68 - 636.08] feel it we can really feel it and then
[633.52 - 636.80] we don't think we digested our food but
[636.08 - 640.88] we did
[636.80 - 643.76] digest our food we digested it enough
[640.88 - 644.56] and but what happens is larger amounts
[643.76 - 646.88] of food
[644.56 - 648.96] sometimes stretches out the small
[646.88 - 650.80] intestinal tract as it's going down
[648.96 - 652.72] and we could really feel that it's one
[650.80 - 654.72] thing another thing is if it's not large
[652.72 - 656.88] amounts of food and you feel
[654.72 - 658.40] your intestinal tract you feel
[656.88 - 661.44] discomfort
[658.40 - 663.04] keep in mind that when the nerves in the
[661.44 - 663.92] lining of the intestinal tract are
[663.04 - 667.04] inflamed and
[663.92 - 668.00] foods moving through it's rubbing the
[667.04 - 669.60] lining
[668.00 - 671.76] and there are foods that don't rub the
[669.60 - 674.88] lining that make our condition worse
[671.76 - 678.00] like eggs keep that in mind milk cheese
[674.88 - 680.88] butter dairy eggs all of that
[678.00 - 681.60] doesn't rub gluten bread doesn't rub the
[680.88 - 685.04] lining
[681.60 - 687.44] so you may eat that and not feel it okay
[685.04 - 690.48] but if you eat something like cucumbers
[687.44 - 693.68] and lettuce like this beautiful lettuce
[690.48 - 695.44] you might feel it rubbing your lining
[693.68 - 697.20] because your lining is inflamed it
[695.44 - 698.48] doesn't mean it didn't digest it doesn't
[697.20 - 700.16] mean these foods aren't healing you
[698.48 - 702.00] because these are healing foods
[700.16 - 703.52] but you're gonna feel it a lot of people
[702.00 - 705.12] have metals
[703.52 - 707.28] and they have a lot of toxic heavy
[705.12 - 709.76] metals they've got pathogens
[707.28 - 711.44] and they're inside the gut they're
[709.76 - 713.84] inside the intestinal tract
[711.44 - 715.84] so keep that in mind there gastroparesis
[713.84 - 716.56] is in cleanse the heel i talk about it
[715.84 - 719.12] in there
[716.56 - 719.76] okay and sometimes with gastroparesis
[719.12 - 722.32] it's all
[719.76 - 725.36] electrical so it's all vagus nerve
[722.32 - 727.68] related and it's coming from the brain
[725.36 - 729.44] so a lot of cases of gastroparesis are
[727.68 - 731.20] coming from the brain so keep that in
[729.44 - 733.68] mind how that works
[731.20 - 734.96] the brain is not sending the correct
[733.68 - 738.64] signals or they're not
[734.96 - 739.20] reaching the gut so that peristaltic
[738.64 - 741.52] action
[739.20 - 743.04] happens and peristaltic action starts to
[741.52 - 744.64] move and do its thing
[743.04 - 746.88] you're not getting the signals they're
[744.64 - 748.40] not matching up because a lot of people
[746.88 - 751.36] have toxic heavy metals
[748.40 - 752.40] in the brain short circuiting
[751.36 - 755.68] information
[752.40 - 758.48] that's running down the vagus nerve
[755.68 - 760.32] and heading to the gut creating that
[758.48 - 761.36] peristaltic action so now you're not
[760.32 - 764.32] getting that peristaltic
[761.36 - 766.64] action so so we're not getting that
[764.32 - 769.12] twisting and that massaging that our gut
[766.64 - 769.52] does as it moves the food down and
[769.12 - 771.52] through
[769.52 - 773.76] we're not getting that because the
[771.52 - 777.28] signals coming from the brain
[773.76 - 780.48] are not wired like the the um
[777.28 - 782.88] the brain stem is not receiving
[780.48 - 783.84] signals from the neurons up in the
[782.88 - 786.96] larger
[783.84 - 788.32] the top of the brain so the hemispheres
[786.96 - 790.00] so those signals aren't happening
[788.32 - 791.68] they're not going to the brain stem and
[790.00 - 793.84] then boom not going down the
[791.68 - 795.20] down the uh vagus nerve and boom not
[793.84 - 796.48] going down into the small intestinal
[795.20 - 798.08] tract and that's a lot
[796.48 - 799.76] a lot of stuff behind gastroparesis
[798.08 - 802.56] that's why i'm always like we got to get
[799.76 - 804.64] metals out we got to do that that's one
[802.56 - 805.60] reason the other thing for gastroparesis
[804.64 - 808.16] is
[805.60 - 809.04] pathogen infections they're just not
[808.16 - 812.08] detectable
[809.04 - 812.64] so viral loads viral loads inside the
[812.08 - 815.28] liver
[812.64 - 816.08] viral loads inside the intestinal tract
[815.28 - 818.64] causing
[816.08 - 821.44] lots of inflammation and then that could
[818.64 - 822.64] get a gastroparesis diagnosis so that's
[821.44 - 828.24] how it works there
[822.64 - 830.88] that's just a couple of tidbits good to
[828.24 - 832.80] see you guys glad you guys are coming on
[830.88 - 835.28] michelle elsa's cortisone shots are
[832.80 - 835.28] horrible
[835.44 - 839.76] yeah i mean cortisone shots are just
[837.12 - 841.84] they're just so rough they're so rough

[849.76 - 853.20] that amazon but the point is is i'm
[851.60 - 854.64] talking about the mono eating cleanse
[853.20 - 857.84] challenge
[854.64 - 860.40] jerome says my digestive really started
[857.84 - 864.24] to heal once i got rid of my
[860.40 - 865.04] multi vitamins the multivitamins wreak
[864.24 - 867.12] havoc
[865.04 - 869.44] that's one of those things a lot of
[867.12 - 870.72] those junky multivitamins even ones that
[869.44 - 872.32] come from companies that are really
[870.72 - 872.72] reputable and they're expensive they're
[872.32 - 876.00] just
[872.72 - 877.76] junk multivitamins etc and bought the
[876.00 - 879.36] bimergy instead
[877.76 - 882.24] that are supposed to be good for my
[879.36 - 884.64] symptoms which are neurological
[882.24 - 886.00] of course lemon water and celery is the
[884.64 - 888.40] holy grail
[886.00 - 889.04] that's really incredible one of the
[888.40 - 890.80] tricks
[889.04 - 892.80] in the industry i'm just going to give
[890.80 - 896.00] you this to you right now you guys
[892.80 - 900.24] is the multi vitamin or protein
[896.00 - 903.60] powder scams and or multi-vitamin
[900.24 - 905.36] powder scams that's probably one of the
[903.60 - 907.28] big tricks one of the big scams in the
[905.36 - 908.72] industry in alternative medicine
[907.28 - 909.92] so just keep an eye on that you're going
[908.72 - 912.24] to spend a lot of money on these
[909.92 - 914.08] multivitamins they're highly irritating
[912.24 - 916.88] to the intestinal tract and gut
[914.08 - 917.28] they're irritating to the system they're
[916.88 - 920.32] they're
[917.28 - 922.32] garbage even they're high priced garbage
[920.32 - 924.08] from the best companies out there so
[922.32 - 924.80] what we think is the best companies out
[924.08 - 928.24] there
[924.80 - 930.24] and they use a speck of this in a speck
[928.24 - 932.64] of that you cannot heal
[930.24 - 933.92] with a speck of a whole bunch of things
[932.64 - 936.64] that some
[933.92 - 937.92] guy at some lab decided to put together
[936.64 - 939.44] and offer that to the
[937.92 - 941.36] to the to the board members of the
[939.44 - 941.92] company and the board members are like
[941.36 - 944.00] sure that
[941.92 - 945.36] that that that sounds good to me what do
[944.00 - 947.28] you think frank
[945.36 - 949.04] does that sound good to you they got the
[947.28 - 950.48] multivitamin they priced it all out we
[949.04 - 952.24] can make a lot of money and it's just a
[950.48 - 953.76] speck of this and the speck of that
[952.24 - 955.84] well what do you think what do you think
[953.76 - 958.72] bob how does that how was that
[955.84 - 960.08] chairman bob uh the lab guy came and he
[958.72 - 961.44] showed us the new multivitamin they're
[960.08 - 963.12] gonna put out what do you think
[961.44 - 964.88] uh-huh okay let's get it together let's
[963.12 - 966.16] do it good you got our go you got our
[964.88 - 967.28] permission

[967.28 - 970.08] understand how those multivitamins are
[968.80 - 972.32] they're the worst
[970.08 - 973.20] they're the junkiest even from the best
[972.32 - 975.84] companies
[973.20 - 977.44] they waste your time all of that your
[975.84 - 978.88] waste your energy
[977.44 - 980.72] keep that in mind and they're not for a
[978.88 - 983.04] specific condition
[980.72 - 984.24] they're not for a specific condition
[983.04 - 985.92] you're sick with something
[984.24 - 988.40] that's that's not there for you like

[1012.80 - 1015.28] is it
[1013.36 - 1018.00] like how does that work but we we get
[1015.28 - 1020.08] led all these directions
[1018.00 - 1021.60] and then we're just stuck we're stuck
[1020.08 - 1023.12] we're stuck we're sick

[1029.20 - 1032.80] i had decades of people pouring into my
[1030.96 - 1034.88] office from around the world because i
[1032.80 - 1036.32] was the bizarre symptoms guy
[1034.88 - 1037.76] having answers for symptoms for the
[1036.32 - 1039.04] first time in our history and chronic
[1037.76 - 1041.12] illness right
[1039.04 - 1042.56] and people walk in be like i actually
[1041.12 - 1046.56] have an answer now
[1042.56 - 1048.32] and it's not candida it's not in it
[1046.56 - 1051.44] and he's not telling me to go on this
[1048.32 - 1054.72] big old bulky multivitamin
[1051.44 - 1056.32] and and you know so keep that in mind
[1054.72 - 1059.04] how it works out there and it's not my
[1056.32 - 1061.52] genes he's not saying it's genes and
[1059.04 - 1064.08] it's not my body attacking itself
[1061.52 - 1065.44] he actually has an answer he's actually
[1064.08 - 1068.48] saying what's happening
[1065.44 - 1070.24] and so what happens is that multivitamin
[1068.48 - 1072.56] i've seen that used so many times

[1174.08 - 1180.56] so yeah
[1178.24 - 1183.84] bridgette what about ibs talked about
[1180.56 - 1187.44] the cause of ibs for years and years
[1183.84 - 1188.96] and what's interesting about ibs is
[1187.44 - 1191.36] conventional medicine alternative
[1188.96 - 1194.64] medicine just believes ibs is
[1191.36 - 1194.64] irritable bowel syndrome
[1195.60 - 1199.28] that was one i made fun of for a long
[1197.60 - 1201.20] time not people having
[1199.28 - 1202.88] ibs no way i would never make fun of
[1201.20 - 1206.40] that in a million years
[1202.88 - 1208.00] but i made fun of conventional medicine
[1206.40 - 1209.76] and alternative medicine for years
[1208.00 - 1212.08] because of that one sarcastic being
[1209.76 - 1217.04] sarcastic about it think about it
[1212.08 - 1220.56] so the all the technology we have
[1217.04 - 1224.16] all the medical research and science
[1220.56 - 1227.92] all the alternative research in science
[1224.16 - 1231.36] all the medical universities right
[1227.92 - 1232.72] all the big pharma right all the big
[1231.36 - 1235.60] corporations
[1232.72 - 1237.20] all the big insurance companies all the
[1235.60 - 1241.28] entire
[1237.20 - 1243.36] kitten caboodle right the best they can
[1241.28 - 1246.64] come up with
[1243.36 - 1248.96] is you have ibs that means
[1246.64 - 1251.84] you go to the doctor i don't feel really
[1248.96 - 1253.44] good in my stomach down here and
[1251.84 - 1255.92] i kind of go to bathroom it kind of
[1253.44 - 1258.56] hurts a little
[1255.92 - 1260.40] no answer think about that do you ever
[1258.56 - 1265.68] think about that
[1260.40 - 1268.24] all the great minds in the medical world
[1265.68 - 1269.44] all the technology and all they can come
[1268.24 - 1272.64] up with
[1269.44 - 1276.88] with everything they got is you have
[1272.64 - 1278.00] ibs really i got ibs i got a diagnosis
[1276.88 - 1281.36] finally got an answer
[1278.00 - 1283.44] what is that irritable bowel

[1283.44 - 1288.08] irritable bowel

[1292.40 - 1296.88] uh it's a i have an irritable bowel
[1294.48 - 1300.88] syndrome that's not an answer
[1296.88 - 1305.28] okay i talk about in the medical
[1300.88 - 1307.68] medium series streptococcus causes ibs
[1305.28 - 1309.44] and there's reasons why strep gets fed
[1307.68 - 1311.04] and we eat the foods we shouldn't eat
[1309.44 - 1312.72] that feedstrap and then we have
[1311.04 - 1313.68] antibiotics throughout our life and the
[1312.72 - 1315.60] strep gets worse
[1313.68 - 1316.72] we end up with ibs talk about that all
[1315.60 - 1318.56] the time
[1316.72 - 1320.40] yes it's awful it hurts and makes you
[1318.56 - 1323.68] feel nauseous

[1347.20 - 1350.00] medium information
[1348.48 - 1352.16] causing these problems so people that
[1350.00 - 1352.48] know gastroparesis is vagus nerve that's
[1352.16 - 1354.08] not
[1352.48 - 1355.76] that's not just out there that's always
[1354.08 - 1357.04] been medical medium medical medium

[1359.28 - 1364.08] medical medium information
[1360.64 - 1367.76] for years anxiety with vagus nerve is
[1364.08 - 1371.12] medical medium information for decades
[1367.76 - 1372.64] the other sad thing is is that
[1371.12 - 1374.40] all this stuff that comes from medical
[1372.64 - 1376.32] medium originally people just it just
[1374.40 - 1377.44] got out there and got out there from all
[1376.32 - 1379.52] the lecturing the teaching the
[1377.44 - 1382.16] publishing the books and
[1379.52 - 1383.36] and it's like and people can't find
[1382.16 - 1386.08] their way back
[1383.36 - 1388.00] they just can't find their way back to
[1386.08 - 1389.44] know where it originates from
[1388.00 - 1392.00] science research doesn't know the vagus
[1389.44 - 1393.52] nerves related to any of that
[1392.00 - 1395.52] so what someone in the alternative
[1393.52 - 1396.24] medicine world just woke up one morning
[1395.52 - 1399.36] was like
[1396.24 - 1400.72] huh no it it comes from
[1399.36 - 1402.40] the source that i've always had this
[1400.72 - 1405.84] information come from
[1402.40 - 1408.56] vagus nerve causing symptoms
[1405.84 - 1411.52] and it being vagus nerve is medical
[1408.56 - 1411.52] medium information
[1412.24 - 1419.76] doing some salad right now

[1525.76 - 1529.60] if you lower the fats they go away
[1528.32 - 1531.68] quicker
[1529.60 - 1534.08] if you lower the fats they go away
[1531.68 - 1534.08] quicker
[1534.88 - 1541.76] the fats slow down our healing
[1538.72 - 1542.80] i want you guys to know that the fats
[1541.76 - 1546.48] slow down
[1542.80 - 1549.68] are healing keep that in mind okay
[1546.48 - 1552.96] they slow down our healing
[1549.68 - 1554.00] interesting right so i love when you
[1552.96 - 1556.32] hear the hole
[1554.00 - 1557.28] you need fats for your brain fats
[1556.32 - 1559.28] healthy fats
[1557.28 - 1561.36] your brain needs them you'll die without
[1559.28 - 1563.68] them really
[1561.36 - 1563.68] really
[1564.56 - 1569.84] you'll die without sugar that i do
[1566.56 - 1571.68] though you'll die without glucose
[1569.84 - 1573.36] your brain dies without glucose it
[1571.68 - 1573.68] doesn't die without fat your brain's not
[1573.36 - 1575.44] made
[1573.68 - 1576.88] out of so much fat as everybody says
[1575.44 - 1578.08] it's made out of it's made out of
[1576.88 - 1580.56] glycogen storage
[1578.08 - 1582.56] hardened glycogen deposits that's the
[1580.56 - 1584.08] majority of what makes makes up and
[1582.56 - 1587.68] creates up all the glial
[1584.08 - 1590.08] cells it's not fat
[1587.68 - 1591.68] so misinformation about fat just gets
[1590.08 - 1592.32] everybody in trouble gets them in
[1591.68 - 1595.04] trouble but
[1592.32 - 1597.36] there's reasons for that you're not
[1595.04 - 1599.04] supposed to get healthy
[1597.36 - 1600.56] if you get healthy by chance and you
[1599.04 - 1601.68] learn how to kick out the bad you know
[1600.56 - 1604.16] processed foods and you
[1601.68 - 1604.96] at least keep yourself going that way
[1604.16 - 1608.24] right
[1604.96 - 1609.84] that's not what the industry wants
[1608.24 - 1612.08] the pharmaceutical industry wants you
[1609.84 - 1616.40] sick they want you dying
[1612.08 - 1618.96] they do they do they need you sick
[1616.40 - 1622.16] in order to keep them going chopping up
[1618.96 - 1622.16] some tomatoes right here
[1623.36 - 1628.24] i think you guys know that though
[1626.48 - 1630.48] so i'm making a salad just working on it
[1628.24 - 1631.60] as you see you guys there's fats already
[1630.48 - 1633.04] in every food
[1631.60 - 1634.48] there's fats in this beautiful lettuce
[1633.04 - 1635.28] right here this butter leaf lettuce has
[1634.48 - 1638.96] fat in it
[1635.28 - 1643.76] it's got omega-3s in it usable omega-3s
[1638.96 - 1647.12] usable right real bioavailable
[1643.76 - 1649.52] and keep this in mind
[1647.12 - 1651.04] you think you're on a keto diet you're
[1649.52 - 1652.48] not on a keto diet
[1651.04 - 1654.32] you're just on a healthier animal
[1652.48 - 1656.08] protein diet
[1654.32 - 1658.64] or if you're plant-based on a keto
[1656.08 - 1661.36] plant-based diet you're just on a
[1658.64 - 1662.88] you're just on a healthier vegan diet
[1661.36 - 1664.88] based basically right
[1662.88 - 1666.80] so keep in mind that no one goes into
[1664.88 - 1668.96] ketosis anymore
[1666.80 - 1670.24] that was given up a long time ago
[1668.96 - 1671.28] because people die when they go into
[1670.24 - 1673.92] ketosis
[1671.28 - 1675.52] so the whole ketogenic diet is just
[1673.92 - 1677.44] really a trendy name for something no
[1675.52 - 1679.36] one even enters into like
[1677.44 - 1681.52] you're actually doing why go keto now
[1679.36 - 1683.76] well you're not going to go into ketosis
[1681.52 - 1685.12] so number one flaw you don't want to go
[1683.76 - 1687.60] into ketosis either
[1685.12 - 1689.04] but it's the number one flaw of diets
[1687.60 - 1690.16] that are created of nobody knowing
[1689.04 - 1692.16] what's going on
[1690.16 - 1694.40] because what happens is if you eat one
[1692.16 - 1695.52] avocado on a keto diet you can't go into
[1694.40 - 1697.36] ketosis
[1695.52 - 1699.68] you can't i don't care what practitioner
[1697.36 - 1701.44] you go to what diet expert you talk to
[1699.68 - 1704.16] what trainer you talk to
[1701.44 - 1706.08] what blood test you had looking for
[1704.16 - 1707.60] ketones you can't you can't go into
[1706.08 - 1710.32] ketosis
[1707.60 - 1712.96] if you have one avocado in that diet
[1710.32 - 1716.56] because the avocado is a lot of sugar
[1712.96 - 1719.60] cheese is a lot of sugar you can't go
[1716.56 - 1720.48] into ketosis eating cheese because it's
[1719.60 - 1722.88] a lot of sugar
[1720.48 - 1723.60] if you have a small little handful of
[1722.88 - 1725.44] berries
[1723.60 - 1726.88] you can't go into ketosis so if your
[1725.44 - 1728.48] ketogenic diet allows you to have
[1726.88 - 1730.08] berries and you'll notice that
[1728.48 - 1731.84] the keto diet allows you to have all
[1730.08 - 1735.36] this like berries
[1731.84 - 1736.56] green apples cheese the keto diet the
[1735.36 - 1738.72] ketogenic diets have
[1736.56 - 1739.68] you know it's avocado it's nuts it's
[1738.72 - 1742.96] seeds
[1739.68 - 1746.00] years ago the keto diet
[1742.96 - 1748.88] okay was a dangerous test
[1746.00 - 1749.84] they removed everything with sugar out
[1748.88 - 1751.84] of your diet
[1749.84 - 1753.36] they removed the avocado which is sugar
[1751.84 - 1755.04] they remove yeah sugar
[1753.36 - 1757.04] avocados got a lot of sugar in it it's a
[1755.04 - 1757.84] fruit it's a fatty fruit it's got a lot
[1757.04 - 1760.32] of sugar in it
[1757.84 - 1762.08] they removed the avocado they removed
[1760.32 - 1763.44] all nuts and seeds peanut butter which
[1762.08 - 1766.16] is sweet
[1763.44 - 1767.52] peanut butter sweet there's nuts are
[1766.16 - 1769.12] sweet
[1767.52 - 1771.04] a walnut like they're they have a
[1769.12 - 1771.52] sweetness to it because it's part sugar
[1771.04 - 1774.08] right
[1771.52 - 1774.56] they removed all the nuts all the seeds
[1774.08 - 1777.76] right
[1774.56 - 1780.16] and they put people literally on no
[1777.76 - 1782.16] calories that that are derived from on
[1780.16 - 1783.60] any level from any kind of carbohydrate
[1782.16 - 1786.80] or sugar
[1783.60 - 1789.20] and then they watched people die because
[1786.80 - 1792.64] their brain went so void
[1789.20 - 1795.04] of glucose so the ketogenic experiment
[1792.64 - 1796.80] was an epic disaster that killed people
[1795.04 - 1799.12] but they kept the name but they brought
[1796.80 - 1801.12] in sugar is what they did
[1799.12 - 1802.96] and even meat has sugar in it so what
[1801.12 - 1805.60] they would do is they would boil
[1802.96 - 1806.72] the sugar out of meat because meat has
[1805.60 - 1809.60] sugar
[1806.72 - 1810.16] right the animal's blood the animal's
[1809.60 - 1813.52] blood
[1810.16 - 1816.56] is sugar that's how it works
[1813.52 - 1820.00] the blood inside an animal is
[1816.56 - 1823.44] sugar your blood has
[1820.00 - 1825.44] glucose in it it's sugar right
[1823.44 - 1827.12] so they did was the ketogenic experiment
[1825.44 - 1829.28] many years ago decades ago
[1827.12 - 1830.96] what they did was they removed the sugar
[1829.28 - 1836.08] out of the meat
[1830.96 - 1840.16] they boiled the sugar out of the meat
[1836.08 - 1842.08] right they didn't fry the meat and give
[1840.16 - 1845.36] people fried meat
[1842.08 - 1848.96] they didn't give people broiled
[1845.36 - 1849.68] beef they boiled the sugar out of the
[1848.96 - 1851.68] beef
[1849.68 - 1854.48] and they only gave that to the people in
[1851.68 - 1856.72] the experiment the ketogenic experiment
[1854.48 - 1857.76] and what they found was when they took
[1856.72 - 1861.44] out every
[1857.76 - 1862.96] single molecule of sugar the person got
[1861.44 - 1864.88] sick lethargic
[1862.96 - 1866.08] lost their thinking process couldn't
[1864.88 - 1870.32] function and either
[1866.08 - 1873.36] died or went into a coma
[1870.32 - 1876.40] or just could barely function
[1873.36 - 1876.96] so they realized the ketosis experiment
[1876.40 - 1880.96] was
[1876.96 - 1883.92] a dangerous one a really really bad idea
[1880.96 - 1886.80] so now the ketogenic diet we have today
[1883.92 - 1889.20] there's carbs in it everywhere
[1886.80 - 1891.28] there's carbs in it everywhere they also
[1889.20 - 1893.12] notice with the old ketogenic diet when
[1891.28 - 1896.08] they started bringing that in
[1893.12 - 1897.28] to the mainstream there was already a
[1896.08 - 1900.24] little bit of carb
[1897.28 - 1902.48] in here wheat germ wheat germ was
[1900.24 - 1903.76] allowed in the old ketogenic diet
[1902.48 - 1906.00] you know you were allowed to do wheat
[1903.76 - 1909.52] germ so you had a little bit of
[1906.00 - 1910.80] carbohydrate in places right you had a
[1909.52 - 1912.24] little bit
[1910.80 - 1914.32] but people were getting heart attacks
[1912.24 - 1915.52] and strokes they had no antioxidants
[1914.32 - 1917.76] they had no
[1915.52 - 1920.24] they had no leafy greens of course they
[1917.76 - 1921.76] didn't even have iceberg lettuce anyway
[1920.24 - 1923.52] they didn't have oranges they didn't
[1921.76 - 1925.12] have things that keep you healthy and
[1923.52 - 1927.60] strong
[1925.12 - 1928.96] is what they didn't have so people would
[1927.60 - 1929.60] get heart attacks people would get
[1928.96 - 1931.36] stroked
[1929.60 - 1932.88] people get heart disease real fast to
[1931.36 - 1934.80] get those cholesterol problems off the
[1932.88 - 1936.56] chart they get everything all wrong
[1934.80 - 1940.72] and so then the ketogenic diet had to
[1936.56 - 1943.04] make it like a transformation you guys
[1940.72 - 1945.12] and they had to start putting sugar in
[1943.04 - 1946.96] it so one of the first starts of the
[1945.12 - 1949.04] sugar was green juices
[1946.96 - 1951.60] so green juices entered the ketogenic
[1949.04 - 1954.00] diet green juices
[1951.60 - 1955.76] and green juices that had a little bit
[1954.00 - 1958.00] of glucose in it
[1955.76 - 1960.00] because some of the vegetables are like
[1958.00 - 1960.88] green juices with beet in there that's
[1960.00 - 1963.76] glucose
[1960.88 - 1965.92] green juices with carrot in there green
[1963.76 - 1968.40] juices and then they started putting in
[1965.92 - 1970.12] a few berries and then they started
[1968.40 - 1973.20] putting in the ketogenic diet
[1970.12 - 1974.48] avocado more sugar you see
[1973.20 - 1976.72] there's putting more sugar in your
[1974.48 - 1979.12] ketogenic diet guess what
[1976.72 - 1981.04] ketosis stops then they put a little
[1979.12 - 1982.40] cheese in there oh high quality cheese
[1981.04 - 1984.16] in your ketogenic diet
[1982.40 - 1986.08] that's good for you right and they put
[1984.16 - 1987.76] that in there and then they put butter
[1986.08 - 1991.04] in there which is sugar
[1987.76 - 1994.64] it's not just fat butters sugar
[1991.04 - 1998.40] sweet it's like butter's sweet
[1994.64 - 1999.04] it is right not candy sweet but it's
[1998.40 - 2002.56] sweet
[1999.04 - 2004.56] there's a sweetness to it okay and then
[2002.56 - 2006.64] in these foods had nutrients in there
[2004.56 - 2008.96] they had nuts then they put nuts and
[2006.64 - 2010.72] seeds in the ketogenic diet which were
[2008.96 - 2013.76] sugars
[2010.72 - 2015.60] see and the green juice and the berries
[2013.76 - 2017.36] and the avocado and the nuts and seeds
[2015.60 - 2018.00] had nutrients in it which started
[2017.36 - 2019.84] helping get
[2018.00 - 2021.36] people get a little bit better and
[2019.84 - 2024.40] they're and it's like they're
[2021.36 - 2025.68] redesigning a screw-up and they're tr
[2024.40 - 2026.88] they're like redesigning it it's
[2025.68 - 2028.24] unbelievable what happens they're trying
[2026.88 - 2030.72] to redesign the screw
[2028.24 - 2032.32] is what's going on and in the end all
[2030.72 - 2033.92] they did was make a healthier animal
[2032.32 - 2036.16] protein diet
[2033.92 - 2037.44] that's all a healthier animal protein
[2036.16 - 2038.96] diet that happens to have
[2037.44 - 2040.24] a few more antioxidants and some
[2038.96 - 2041.76] nutrients here and there and you get a
[2040.24 - 2042.80] little bit of berries if you want you
[2041.76 - 2044.24] got a little bit of that
[2042.80 - 2045.92] you get a little bit of you know you got
[2044.24 - 2047.68] your avocado which is your healthy fat
[2045.92 - 2049.20] because avocado is good for you
[2047.68 - 2050.64] sure it's good for you but if you're
[2049.20 - 2052.24] trying to heal from chronic illness it's
[2050.64 - 2053.92] not your best friend but it's still good
[2052.24 - 2056.32] for you
[2053.92 - 2057.76] and then people were craving more sugar
[2056.32 - 2059.12] and they're craving more sugar so they
[2057.76 - 2060.24] had to offer something in there so then
[2059.12 - 2061.76] they started throwing in all the
[2060.24 - 2063.68] chocolate
[2061.76 - 2065.44] butter fat with a little bit of that raw
[2063.68 - 2068.72] sugar in there or honey and
[2065.44 - 2070.40] raw sugar but people were craving more
[2068.72 - 2072.00] sugar in the ketogenic diet so they had
[2070.40 - 2072.56] to put more things in there so they had
[2072.00 - 2075.36] to put
[2072.56 - 2077.68] more green apples and more berries and
[2075.36 - 2079.44] they had to put something in here
[2077.68 - 2082.24] and now there's keto stuff that's like
[2079.44 - 2084.40] keto donuts and cookies and cakes now
[2082.24 - 2086.24] it's that's keto friendly that's keto
[2084.40 - 2088.64] friendly it's got this many grams of
[2086.24 - 2090.72] carbohydrates that's keto friendly
[2088.64 - 2092.64] and that's how it works you see it's all
[2090.72 - 2094.16] a game of
[2092.64 - 2096.56] not knowing what the heck's going on
[2094.16 - 2097.84] it's a game of scam it's a game of all
[2096.56 - 2099.84] this
[2097.84 - 2101.68] but everybody just walks into it like
[2099.84 - 2103.12] you walk into it uneducated and
[2101.68 - 2103.60] everybody walks into it uneducated
[2103.12 - 2106.00] they're like
[2103.60 - 2107.68] you just walk right into it like oh what
[2106.00 - 2109.52] really that's keto friendly good let me
[2107.68 - 2110.56] have that oh am i in ketosis nobody
[2109.52 - 2112.56] knows
[2110.56 - 2113.84] but what happens is you end up binging
[2112.56 - 2116.80] and that happened all the time
[2113.84 - 2118.40] because there was no sugar in their diet
[2116.80 - 2120.16] because no one was eating avocados in
[2118.40 - 2121.76] the original ketogenic diet they weren't
[2120.16 - 2123.12] eating nuts and seeds and berries and
[2121.76 - 2123.52] they weren't eating anything that they
[2123.12 - 2126.56] were
[2123.52 - 2129.44] binging they'd be like
[2126.56 - 2131.20] they'd be keto for a week and binge
[2129.44 - 2132.08] because they needed some kind of glucose
[2131.20 - 2133.76] for their brain
[2132.08 - 2135.36] you see how it works they needed glucose
[2133.76 - 2137.44] for their brain
[2135.36 - 2139.84] now the keto diet is doing celery juice
[2137.44 - 2142.48] so that's in the keto diet now
[2139.84 - 2144.80] so celery juice is in the keto diet now
[2142.48 - 2146.32] celery's got glucose in it still
[2144.80 - 2147.84] you can't go into ketosis if you're
[2146.32 - 2150.00] doing celery juice you can't go into
[2147.84 - 2152.32] ketosis
[2150.00 - 2154.08] and but they're doing celery juice it's
[2152.32 - 2155.44] helping the real problem so then
[2154.08 - 2157.84] someone's tagging
[2155.44 - 2159.68] ketogenic diets really helping people
[2157.84 - 2161.76] look this one person's getting better
[2159.68 - 2164.00] this one person's just lost 50 pounds on
[2161.76 - 2165.92] a ketogenic diet for the last six months
[2164.00 - 2168.16] there's no other person and what's
[2165.92 - 2170.72] happening is in the ketogenic diet
[2168.16 - 2172.72] they're putting in things that help you
[2170.72 - 2173.84] they're like old medical medium tools
[2172.72 - 2176.08] they're putting in
[2173.84 - 2177.04] celery juice and they're putting in some
[2176.08 - 2179.04] juices
[2177.04 - 2180.16] and they're putting in a little of this
[2179.04 - 2183.04] and they're putting in a little
[2180.16 - 2183.92] spirulina then they're putting in there
[2183.04 - 2185.60] they're actually
[2183.92 - 2187.44] they're actually putting in things then
[2185.60 - 2189.28] they're putting in some spinach in your
[2187.44 - 2190.96] keto diet now for the first time
[2189.28 - 2192.56] then you're putting in cilantro in your
[2190.96 - 2194.24] keto diet now for the first time
[2192.56 - 2195.84] and then they're saying the ketogenic
[2194.24 - 2198.88] diet is getting you better
[2195.84 - 2200.96] not the things that get you better like
[2198.88 - 2204.00] asparagus and cilantro
[2200.96 - 2204.80] and spinach and berries and whatever and
[2204.00 - 2206.80] they're not saying
[2204.80 - 2208.40] in the celery juice they're not saying
[2206.80 - 2211.52] those are what's getting you better
[2208.40 - 2212.64] they're wrapping it up in this keto keto
[2211.52 - 2214.56] bowl
[2212.64 - 2216.56] that's keto that's getting it better so
[2214.56 - 2219.52] this is really interesting stuff on how
[2216.56 - 2219.52] things work you know
[2219.68 - 2223.44] yeah let's make a salad we're still
[2221.12 - 2226.56] doing that
[2223.44 - 2228.96] very very interesting
[2226.56 - 2229.68] when you think about it right so what
[2228.96 - 2232.80] i'm going to do
[2229.68 - 2234.72] is i'm going to
[2232.80 - 2236.96] chop up the cucumber a little bit okay
[2234.72 - 2238.80] so i like chopping up thin slices so i'm
[2236.96 - 2240.80] going to do that right here you guys
[2238.80 - 2242.40] and i'm chopping it up on an angle a
[2240.80 - 2243.60] little bit so they don't roll off the
[2242.40 - 2245.36] cutting board
[2243.60 - 2247.52] so if you do a little one did one rolled
[2245.36 - 2250.32] off how do you like that
[2247.52 - 2253.04] so we're gonna do a little bit of i like
[2250.32 - 2256.16] them kind of thin like this
[2253.04 - 2261.04] don't like them real real thick
[2256.16 - 2261.04] right okay
[2261.68 - 2264.88] my trigeminal neuralgia is just about
[2264.00 - 2268.08] gone
[2264.88 - 2270.32] now healing my digestion thank you reena
[2268.08 - 2273.36] i'm so happy for you seriously i really
[2270.32 - 2276.48] am if you guys just get on here
[2273.36 - 2280.08] medical medium mono cleanse
[2276.48 - 2284.56] challenge next week i'm pumped up
[2280.08 - 2290.00] actually pumped up janine
[2284.56 - 2290.00] what about hc's g drops it's terrifying
[2290.24 - 2292.80] hcg
[2294.32 - 2300.96] the hcg
[2297.44 - 2306.00] terrified popping some cucumber on here
[2300.96 - 2308.96] not a fan at all probably one of the
[2306.00 - 2311.44] most ridiculous things because what they
[2308.96 - 2313.60] did is they just starved you to death
[2311.44 - 2314.48] they just they put you on 500 calories a
[2313.60 - 2316.96] day
[2314.48 - 2319.12] got people exercising on 500 calories a
[2316.96 - 2320.64] day you'd end up binging yourself to
[2319.12 - 2323.12] death i've seen so many people just
[2320.64 - 2324.80] binge themselves like crazy it stresses
[2323.12 - 2325.52] out their adrenals stresses out their
[2324.80 - 2329.76] liver
[2325.52 - 2329.76] they're sicker than ever before from hcg
[2330.64 - 2334.32] people get sicker than ever before
[2334.80 - 2338.84] they go into it well whoa something's
[2336.40 - 2341.76] changing something's happening
[2338.84 - 2344.56] man and then they get
[2341.76 - 2347.36] screwed over in the end because that's
[2344.56 - 2347.36] how it works
[2348.56 - 2351.92] the world of guessing games in the
[2350.08 - 2353.68] industries and everybody involved
[2351.92 - 2355.44] just really they're just playing people
[2353.68 - 2359.12] in so many ways not everybody
[2355.44 - 2359.68] but boy my god they just play people in
[2359.12 - 2361.44] such an

[2465.36 - 2470.56] is derived from a stagnant sluggish
[2468.16 - 2470.56] liver
[2470.88 - 2476.48] just letting you know it's medical
[2473.92 - 2478.24] medium information
[2476.48 - 2480.88] friend of mine just told me that they
[2478.24 - 2484.08] were listening to some kind of
[2480.88 - 2486.16] opera somewhere and then a commercial
[2484.08 - 2489.36] came on between the opera
[2486.16 - 2492.56] and it was this doctor
[2489.36 - 2496.88] saying how weight gain is caused by
[2492.56 - 2500.08] an overburdened stagnant liver
[2496.88 - 2503.84] to sell a product right first of all
[2500.08 - 2506.32] medical medium publish this first
[2503.84 - 2508.00] it's spirit of compassion's information
[2506.32 - 2509.68] that our weight gain is derived from an
[2508.00 - 2511.20] overburdened sluggish liver
[2509.68 - 2512.80] and there's no scientific study that
[2511.20 - 2514.72] discovered it prior
[2512.80 - 2516.64] and there's a doctor sitting there
[2514.72 - 2518.80] reading liver rescue book
[2516.64 - 2520.72] not telling anybody and then saying in a
[2518.80 - 2522.40] commercial to sell her product that it's
[2520.72 - 2525.36] coming from weight loss is coming from
[2522.40 - 2525.36] an overburdened liver
[2527.36 - 2539.92] just like come on i think it's a
[2536.48 - 2539.92] twilight zone personally
[2542.48 - 2548.40] but i like the twilight zone
[2545.76 - 2548.40] it's all right
[2548.88 - 2552.88] makes life interest interesting you know
[2554.88 - 2558.16] all right so we got this herb salad
[2556.80 - 2561.20] we're moving on and i'm not
[2558.16 - 2562.80] telling people that i'm the source so i
[2561.20 - 2563.92] can just be like oh i'm the source it's
[2562.80 - 2565.04] just that how are you going to find out
[2563.92 - 2567.84] how to heal because
[2565.04 - 2569.44] what what this person did is this person
[2567.84 - 2570.96] also offered a bunch of things that
[2569.44 - 2573.20] makes your problem worse
[2570.96 - 2574.88] so it's like okay your liver is causing
[2573.20 - 2576.80] your weight gain because it's stagnant
[2574.88 - 2578.72] sluggish i'm doctor whatever
[2576.80 - 2580.24] and then she went on like something like
[2578.72 - 2582.40] that that this is the cause of it and
[2580.24 - 2583.44] then here's the powder i want you to be

[2716.40 - 2719.92] your gut
[2717.12 - 2722.00] it's not going to want to get killed off
[2719.92 - 2724.32] it's not going to want to go
[2722.00 - 2725.12] bacteria and viruses don't want to just
[2724.32 - 2726.64] leave
[2725.12 - 2727.84] they don't be like okay throw my hands
[2726.64 - 2730.24] in the air and i'm going to go they've
[2727.84 - 2732.48] been living in you for a long time
[2730.24 - 2733.76] they've been grown by the classified
[2732.48 - 2737.12] medical industry
[2733.76 - 2738.80] grown in labs out of eggs and they've
[2737.12 - 2741.12] been put out into the world
[2738.80 - 2743.20] purposely so that you have all these
[2741.12 - 2747.60] different pathogens inside of you
[2743.20 - 2750.72] right that's what the the weaponized
[2747.60 - 2753.92] biological warfare you know
[2750.72 - 2755.52] all started before 1920. so they started
[2753.92 - 2757.04] learning how the classified medical
[2755.52 - 2759.28] industry started learning how to
[2757.04 - 2760.88] propagate all these bugs and then they
[2759.28 - 2763.28] were like whoa we could actually
[2760.88 - 2765.20] create illness in people to feed the
[2763.28 - 2767.44] medical industry for years to come and
[2765.20 - 2768.88] the publicly the publicly known medical
[2767.44 - 2770.56] research and science will never be aware
[2768.88 - 2771.76] of it unless they discover it as time
[2770.56 - 2775.44] goes on
[2771.76 - 2776.08] and it was a really great incredible
[2775.44 - 2777.44] scheme
[2776.08 - 2778.56] of all time when you think about it
[2777.44 - 2779.28] you've got the classified medical
[2778.56 - 2780.80] industry
[2779.28 - 2782.64] raising all these bugs behind
[2780.80 - 2784.32] everybody's backs and then you've got
[2782.64 - 2785.84] your publicly known medical industry
[2784.32 - 2787.68] like the medical schools and all that
[2785.84 - 2789.68] pumping out doctors right
[2787.68 - 2790.96] and doing all that stuff in research and
[2789.68 - 2793.20] they're two worlds
[2790.96 - 2794.56] and they in the private industry the
[2793.20 - 2795.28] classified industry released all the
[2794.56 - 2799.20] bugs
[2795.28 - 2801.36] in 1920 1930 1940 1950
[2799.20 - 2803.60] all the herpes simplex ones and herpes
[2801.36 - 2806.56] simplex twos right
[2803.60 - 2807.36] all released you know so everybody
[2806.56 - 2809.92] thought that
[2807.36 - 2811.84] woodstock is why herpes simplex 1 went
[2809.92 - 2814.64] around and herpes simplex 2 went around
[2811.84 - 2816.80] it was because of woodstock in 1969
[2814.64 - 2819.04] and it wasn't because of woodstock and
[2816.80 - 2820.72] everybody having free sex in 1969
[2819.04 - 2822.80] because that's what they blamed it on
[2820.72 - 2824.72] that's not why simplex 1 and simplex 2
[2822.80 - 2825.76] went around simplex 1 and simplex 2 were
[2824.72 - 2827.92] released
[2825.76 - 2829.92] before night right around 1920 early
[2827.92 - 2830.24] before 1920 it was released and they
[2829.92 - 2832.08] were
[2830.24 - 2833.52] releasing it publicly with nobody
[2832.08 - 2835.12] knowing it and they were putting it out
[2833.52 - 2836.08] there so people would get simplex 1 and
[2835.12 - 2837.84] simplex 2.
[2836.08 - 2839.68] and then people would pass it around by
[2837.84 - 2841.60] the time woodstock came around and
[2839.68 - 2843.76] you know that age of free love came
[2841.60 - 2845.44] around in the 1960s
[2843.76 - 2847.44] everybody was passing around their
[2845.44 - 2849.60] simplex ones and simplex twos but it
[2847.44 - 2851.52] wasn't because really because of that
[2849.60 - 2853.68] it was because it was put out there to
[2851.52 - 2856.00] get passed around you see how it works
[2853.68 - 2858.00] and so the classified industry put out
[2856.00 - 2861.20] all these bugs all through the 1920s
[2858.00 - 2863.36] and 1930s and 1940s and the epstein bars
[2861.20 - 2864.48] and the cytomegaloviruses and the hhv-6
[2863.36 - 2865.92] were all put out there
[2864.48 - 2867.84] and then the publicly known medical
[2865.92 - 2869.36] research science never knew why anybody
[2867.84 - 2871.04] was sick they still don't know now but
[2869.36 - 2872.48] they stumbled across the bugs along the
[2871.04 - 2874.24] way and was like whoa
[2872.48 - 2876.00] that's that's a virus we see under the
[2874.24 - 2877.52] microscope meanwhile they're just
[2876.00 - 2879.68] discovering what was already known by
[2877.52 - 2887.84] the classified industry
[2879.68 - 2887.84] put a little bit of lemon on here
