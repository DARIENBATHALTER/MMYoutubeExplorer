[53.68 - 56.88] private information that i haven't
[55.52 - 59.12] shared with anybody

[59.12 - 64.88] was a child since age four
[61.28 - 66.48] and i got the the chapters are packed
[64.88 - 68.96] they even have information about the
[66.48 - 70.80] plague we're dealing with today
[68.96 - 72.56] and that's just to start i mean i mean i
[70.80 - 73.76] could sit here all day with this that's
[72.56 - 75.84] how packed it is
[73.76 - 78.24] anyway we're gonna make the sweet and
[75.84 - 81.28] sour stir fries what we're doing
[78.24 - 84.00] and it's out of the revised and expanded
[81.28 - 85.20] medical medium book new edition so i'm
[84.00 - 88.88] excited
[85.20 - 90.96] so i'm gonna get my things ready and
[88.88 - 92.24] show you i got the bell peppers i know
[90.96 - 94.72] some of you are like no
[92.24 - 96.32] not i can't do a bell pepper it's gonna
[94.72 - 98.16] it's gonna hurt me it's not gonna hurt
[96.32 - 99.76] you this is really good for you
[98.16 - 101.28] i got the orange bell peppers i got the
[99.76 - 102.08] red bell peppers which you don't want is
[101.28 - 104.56] a green
[102.08 - 106.08] bell pepper green it's not ripe so you
[104.56 - 109.36] got to remember that
[106.08 - 111.12] green bell peppers are not ripe
[109.36 - 113.20] that's the whole ticket right there
[111.12 - 115.92] right you want to eat
[113.20 - 117.52] ripe food and green bell peppers aren't
[115.92 - 119.60] so keep that in mind because somebody
[117.52 - 120.72] will have a green bell pepper
[119.60 - 123.20] and it's not going to feel good in their
[120.72 - 125.68] stomach because unripe food
[123.20 - 127.68] doesn't feel good it just doesn't i mean
[125.68 - 128.40] can you imagine eating an unripe mango
[127.68 - 131.12] you just
[128.40 - 132.24] really hard mango or an unripe avocado
[131.12 - 133.28] where you can't even you guys like
[132.24 - 136.00] avocados well
[133.28 - 137.44] if your avocado's not ripe right are you
[136.00 - 138.80] just gonna eat it where it's hard as a
[137.44 - 139.28] rock where you can't get a knife through
[138.80 - 142.40] it
[139.28 - 143.92] so but a green bell pepper is not ripe
[142.40 - 145.84] and that's what you want to avoid but
[143.92 - 147.36] the red ones are ripe so i got some
[145.84 - 148.96] carrots here too so i want to show you a
[147.36 - 151.52] few things
[148.96 - 154.16] i'm working with i got some carrots i
[151.52 - 156.24] got some peppers i got some green onions
[154.16 - 158.24] these are scallions
[156.24 - 159.68] with the green onions there i'll you
[158.24 - 160.96] know you can call them green onions i
[159.68 - 161.44] call them scallions that's what i like
[160.96 - 163.28] to do
[161.44 - 164.88] i got some garlic right here i got some
[163.28 - 166.64] ginger so letting you know maybe you
[164.88 - 171.20] guys have some of the stuff
[166.64 - 172.88] in your kitchen right now and
[171.20 - 174.80] i got some limes because we're going to
[172.88 - 177.36] need that got some other stuff too
[174.80 - 177.36] over here
[178.56 - 183.76] i got some beautiful asparagus so
[182.40 - 185.52] that's going to be in the stir fry this
[183.76 - 187.04] is sweet and sour stir fry that's what
[185.52 - 188.88] i'm making
[187.04 - 190.96] i got the brussels sprouts right here
[188.88 - 192.64] too you can use broccoli the recipe
[190.96 - 194.08] calls for broccoli but i had these
[192.64 - 195.84] beautiful brussels sprouts
[194.08 - 197.92] and that's a cruciferous i want to use
[195.84 - 199.84] for this um
[197.92 - 203.20] renita says i can't eat any peppers they
[199.84 - 203.20] cause joint pain for me
[203.28 - 208.56] well make sure they're not green peppers
[206.80 - 210.72] make sure they're never green
[208.56 - 213.04] make sure they're they're red and make
[210.72 - 213.44] sure that have you ever had a piece of
[213.04 - 216.56] red
[213.44 - 218.88] bell pepper by itself like a piece
[216.56 - 220.64] or was it peppers and something else was
[218.88 - 223.92] it peppers in a sausage
[220.64 - 226.48] grinder with cheese was it peppers
[223.92 - 227.12] in a chicken grinder with cheese was it
[226.48 - 229.84] was it
[227.12 - 230.56] peppers and eggs was it peppers and
[229.84 - 232.80] butter
[230.56 - 234.16] what was it that you were having was it
[232.80 - 236.16] was it gluten
[234.16 - 237.84] was there like was there was it a pepper
[236.16 - 240.24] sandwich with all these other things and
[237.84 - 242.00] then gluten was involved and
[240.24 - 244.08] keep that in mind just we can do some
[242.00 - 244.96] self-diagnosis a little self-diagnosis
[244.08 - 247.76] there like
[244.96 - 248.72] could a little piece of red bell pepper
[247.76 - 251.76] be the problem
[248.72 - 253.68] or is it whatever that pepper was in
[251.76 - 255.52] that was maybe the problem what was
[253.68 - 256.80] going on was there vinegar in there so
[255.52 - 259.12] that's another thing too because the
[256.80 - 261.52] true cause of joint pain
[259.12 - 263.20] is viral stuff so that's the joint pain
[261.52 - 264.00] so it's viral stuff i talk about that
[263.20 - 265.84] with ra
[264.00 - 267.76] rheumatoid arthritis i talk about the
[265.84 - 271.20] epstein-barr virus being
[267.76 - 273.76] the joint pain maker it hurts the nerves
[271.20 - 274.72] swells up joints too so keep that in
[273.76 - 276.24] mind
[274.72 - 277.84] but hey you can stay away from the red
[276.24 - 279.76] bell pepper and the orange bell pepper
[277.84 - 281.36] of course of course try something else
[279.76 - 281.76] keep it out of the stir fry how about
[281.36 - 284.08] that
[281.76 - 285.20] lorraine lawson wow green bell peppers
[284.08 - 287.36] are not ripe
[285.20 - 289.20] yes they're not ripe exactly totally no
[287.36 - 290.80] wonder why no wonder i thought peppers
[289.20 - 293.52] affected me at one time
[290.80 - 294.80] i stopped eating them but love the red
[293.52 - 297.04] and orange ones
[294.80 - 298.48] the green bell peppers so another thing
[297.04 - 300.80] too somebody might
[298.48 - 302.56] get a pepper meal of some kind like a
[300.80 - 304.64] dish or a condiment and it's got
[302.56 - 306.40] green and red and other things in it or
[304.64 - 309.60] or but the green
[306.40 - 311.52] pepper is what causes problems anything
[309.60 - 312.32] unripe can cause trouble so keep that in
[311.52 - 315.52] mind
[312.32 - 316.24] um hi from michigan glad you guys are
[315.52 - 318.08] here

[322.32 - 326.16] venture into knowing what the joint pain
[324.24 - 327.76] is and learning what that joint pain is
[326.16 - 329.36] you can always get this right here in
[327.76 - 331.20] the future it's on amazon

[338.64 - 342.00] so jalapenos if you do green out
[340.80 - 344.16] jalapenos
[342.00 - 345.20] you can have a problem look for red
[344.16 - 347.92] jalapenos
[345.20 - 349.92] a green jalapeno is unripe it's an
[347.92 - 352.48] unripe pepper
[349.92 - 353.76] you don't want an unripe tomato you
[352.48 - 356.64] don't want an unripe
[353.76 - 357.28] pepper you don't want an unripe avocado
[356.64 - 360.56] you don't want
[357.28 - 362.72] a prawn ripe banana on ripe mango
[360.56 - 364.16] you know you don't want that for sure
[362.72 - 365.84] you know people are so there's there's
[364.16 - 367.84] health advocates out there or health
[365.84 - 370.88] so-called health experts out there
[367.84 - 372.96] that hate the banana so much they don't
[370.88 - 374.56] like bananas because they're like sugar
[372.96 - 377.68] sugar but then they'll recommend
[374.56 - 379.36] an unripe banana so they'll put that in
[377.68 - 381.44] their book or they'll put there on their
[379.36 - 382.96] podcast where do an unripe banana
[381.44 - 384.72] that's the worst thing you can do you
[382.96 - 387.60] don't want unripe
[384.72 - 388.96] bananas on ripe fruits you don't want to
[387.60 - 390.80] eat an orange that didn't turn
[388.96 - 392.96] orange you don't want to eat a green
[390.80 - 395.92] unripe orange where it's green
[392.96 - 397.12] on a tree you want food to be ripe
[395.92 - 398.40] that's the key
[397.12 - 399.84] and that's something that people get in
[398.40 - 400.48] trouble with in general because they
[399.84 - 402.56] won't
[400.48 - 404.40] they won't know what they're doing those
[402.56 - 407.36] jalapenos when they're green
[404.40 - 409.20] they're on ripe so keep that in mind too
[407.36 - 410.16] green bell peppers are so yummy though
[409.20 - 411.60] yeah you know
[410.16 - 413.20] alex if you still want to eat them you
[411.60 - 416.64] could still have green bell peppers
[413.20 - 417.84] you can you can so i'm making some food
[416.64 - 418.96] now i'm going to start making this
[417.84 - 421.12] stir-fry
[418.96 - 423.04] i'm excited what's the name of the book
[421.12 - 425.36] please i just saw that
[423.04 - 426.16] this is medical medium okay secrets
[425.36 - 427.92] behind chronic
[426.16 - 430.24] mystery illness and how to finally heal
[427.92 - 431.68] and this is the new edition so revised
[430.24 - 434.16] and expanded
[431.68 - 435.28] so i cover chronic fatigue syndrome
[434.16 - 438.32] lupus
[435.28 - 439.68] ra multiple sclerosis lyme disease this
[438.32 - 441.84] is the book
[439.68 - 443.36] that blew the roof off of lyme disease
[441.84 - 445.68] and millions have healed because of it
[443.36 - 446.64] so this is the truth about lyme and how
[445.68 - 448.40] to heal it
[446.64 - 449.84] so it's in this book here that's just
[448.40 - 452.88] some of the stuff in here there's
[449.84 - 455.04] recipes the 28-day cleanse the famous
[452.88 - 457.04] 28-day cleanse that's turned lives
[455.04 - 459.84] around brought people back
[457.04 - 460.96] from the grave i mean brought people
[459.84 - 463.20] back
[460.96 - 464.48] they were literally in wheelchairs
[463.20 - 466.48] suffering in bed
[464.48 - 467.84] and the 28-day cleanse has brought so
[466.48 - 471.12] many lives back
[467.84 - 474.32] and this is the book so jim
[471.12 - 474.80] kathy says i've had the all cat blood
[474.32 - 476.80] test
[474.80 - 478.16] that says i'm highly reactive to bell
[476.80 - 479.68] peppers or bananas
[478.16 - 482.80] how can i do your cleanses when they
[479.68 - 482.80] call for banana well
[482.88 - 487.28] um look i talk to doctors all the time
[485.20 - 489.04] about that test and the consensus is
[487.28 - 490.80] between lots of doctors i know
[489.04 - 493.28] plus information that i've learned along
[490.80 - 495.28] the way about that that the test is very
[493.28 - 496.64] inconsistent so it'll tell you that
[495.28 - 498.64] you're sensitive to a lot of different
[496.64 - 500.88] things but what it won't tell you
[498.64 - 502.64] is maybe something that you should be
[500.88 - 504.72] sensitive like you should keep out of
[502.64 - 506.48] your diet so
[504.72 - 508.16] does that test tell you to stay away
[506.48 - 510.24] from eggs because eggs
[508.16 - 512.72] feed all manners of illness that feeds
[510.24 - 514.96] pathogens viruses bacteria
[512.72 - 518.24] so if you have any kind of condition at
[514.96 - 520.64] all eczema psoriasis
[518.24 - 522.40] cfs lupus aches and pains tingles
[520.64 - 522.88] numbness vertigo dizziness whatever it
[522.40 - 525.52] is
[522.88 - 527.20] you know ringing in the ears utis
[525.52 - 528.08] chronic sinusitis whatever you have
[527.20 - 530.64] going on
[528.08 - 531.92] eggs will feed all these bugs and what
[530.64 - 533.76] the alcat test
[531.92 - 535.36] never understood or never knew the
[533.76 - 538.16] makers of it okay
[535.36 - 538.64] was they never knew what causes sickness
[538.16 - 541.04] so
[538.64 - 543.12] the creators of the alcat test don't
[541.04 - 544.40] know what causes cfs or lyme disease
[543.12 - 546.00] unless they learned it from medical
[544.40 - 546.64] medium information like so many doctors
[546.00 - 548.64] have
[546.64 - 549.92] but they didn't know what causes any
[548.64 - 552.24] sickness and illness so
[549.92 - 554.24] all of a sudden now they're experts at
[552.24 - 556.16] what foods you should stay away from
[554.24 - 557.28] you know that's interesting too so
[556.16 - 558.88] they're experts
[557.28 - 561.20] but meanwhile they can't get anybody
[558.88 - 562.96] better that's got the ms and they can't
[561.20 - 564.40] get the people better with lupus and
[562.96 - 566.56] they can't get the people better with
[564.40 - 567.68] raging eczema psoriasis where they can't
[566.56 - 568.96] wear clothes
[567.68 - 570.48] and they're suffering all night
[568.96 - 571.76] scratching their skin off and it's
[570.48 - 573.92] bleeding everywhere
[571.76 - 576.32] well they can do an lcat test for that
[573.92 - 577.92] eczema patient or that psoriasis patient
[576.32 - 579.76] but they sure as heck can't stop their
[577.92 - 581.44] skin from tearing off and then bleeding
[579.76 - 583.52] all night long in agony and needing
[581.44 - 586.80] drugs to try to calm the pain down
[583.52 - 588.64] well they can't fix that so what i
[586.80 - 590.56] kind of like what i've learned through
[588.64 - 592.72] the years is when
[590.56 - 593.92] you know something works and you've seen
[592.72 - 595.92] it work and
[593.92 - 597.76] the results are there and millions have
[595.92 - 600.00] healed from the information
[597.76 - 602.00] that's kind of the leads you kind of go
[600.00 - 602.64] with because the makers of the alcat
[602.00 - 604.80] test
[602.64 - 606.00] well they can't save that person with
[604.80 - 607.60] severe eczema
[606.00 - 609.84] and they can't save that person in the
[607.60 - 611.76] wheelchair that needs to get out and
[609.84 - 613.60] recover further that mass and they can't
[611.76 - 615.36] save that person with neurological lyme
[613.60 - 617.04] and their life is falling apart all
[615.36 - 619.12] around them and
[617.04 - 620.80] and they can't save anybody there they
[619.12 - 622.48] can tell you that you should stay away
[620.80 - 624.88] from a banana and they should tell you
[622.48 - 627.60] they can tell you that
[624.88 - 628.64] mandy i had those food sensitivity tests
[627.60 - 631.44] two years two
[628.64 - 634.16] um two years ago and was told i was
[631.44 - 637.44] highly sensitive to bananas turnout
[634.16 - 640.08] that was incorrect once i found the mm
[637.44 - 640.56] information in 2017 i eat bananas every
[640.08 - 642.24] day
[640.56 - 643.92] every single day and they have helped me
[642.24 - 647.60] heal being being
[643.92 - 650.48] so high in lysine correct 100 mandy
[647.60 - 651.44] right on so true and that's the mistakes
[650.48 - 654.40] out there
[651.44 - 655.28] once again you got a whole bunch of
[654.40 - 656.56] hackers
[655.28 - 658.32] this is how you know this leads into
[656.56 - 660.48] something i've been thinking about like
[658.32 - 661.92] just recently but this leads to a whole
[660.48 - 664.64] bunch of hackers in health
[661.92 - 666.00] right and they got all these different
[664.64 - 667.92] ways of doing stuff
[666.00 - 669.12] meanwhile they don't know what's wrong
[667.92 - 670.80] and they're kind of like just they're
[669.12 - 673.04] shooting blanks everywhere it's like hey
[670.80 - 674.48] stay away from that banana stay away
[673.04 - 676.00] from that tomato
[674.48 - 677.60] stay away meanwhile they don't even know
[676.00 - 678.64] why anybody's suffering and i don't know
[677.60 - 683.04] why you're sick
[678.64 - 685.36] and a whole bit um lunell
[683.04 - 687.12] you going good this evening going great
[685.36 - 688.64] i'm here so let's talk about this let's
[687.12 - 689.52] get this going and i want to cover some
[688.64 - 692.16] cool things
[689.52 - 693.36] um i just want you guys getting better i
[692.16 - 695.04] want you guys healing
[693.36 - 696.96] so i'm going to slice up some carrots to
[695.04 - 698.40] start with okay
[696.96 - 700.08] so i'm going to thinly slice up some
[698.40 - 703.12] carrots i got them right here
[700.08 - 706.56] so this is the sweet and sour stir-fry
[703.12 - 708.08] um look i understand it's it's easy easy
[706.56 - 710.80] to get tricked
[708.08 - 711.68] into the owl cat it's easy to get
[710.80 - 715.04] tricked
[711.68 - 718.48] into food sensitivities because
[715.04 - 721.68] you know one of the things is that
[718.48 - 724.88] what food sensitivity tests change
[721.68 - 725.84] they change literally by the hour so you
[724.88 - 728.32] can get some
[725.84 - 730.96] blood drawn right you can do even some
[728.32 - 734.64] saliva testing or blood drawn
[730.96 - 736.88] okay and you can do it an hour later
[734.64 - 739.36] if you went back to your doctor an hour
[736.88 - 743.04] later and had a new blood test
[739.36 - 746.72] drawn it would show different
[743.04 - 750.56] sensitivities to different foods in one
[746.72 - 752.96] hour okay a day later
[750.56 - 754.40] the same thing all of a sudden now your
[752.96 - 756.80] food sensitivity says
[754.40 - 758.24] tess says you're allergic to cilantro
[756.80 - 758.96] now oh you're not supposed to have
[758.24 - 761.68] parsley
[758.96 - 763.92] oh stay away from strawberries oh forget
[761.68 - 765.84] asparagus that's a bad one too
[763.92 - 767.92] here's what's funny you can get that
[765.84 - 769.84] test done and get it done a month later
[767.92 - 772.40] and here's what your doctor will do
[769.84 - 774.24] your fancy doctor will go hey some new
[772.40 - 775.12] sensitivities showed up on your test
[774.24 - 777.04] this month
[775.12 - 778.48] since last month you're not just now
[777.04 - 780.72] sensitive to some bananas
[778.48 - 782.08] but you're sensitive to some cilantro
[780.72 - 785.60] you're sensitive to
[782.08 - 786.88] some parsley and this is how ridiculous
[785.60 - 788.88] it really is
[786.88 - 790.80] and how it consistent if they did a
[788.88 - 794.32] blood test an hour later
[790.80 - 796.80] after you went to bathroom okay
[794.32 - 798.16] or ate something all of a sudden that
[796.80 - 801.76] test would change
[798.16 - 803.60] isn't that incredible um
[801.76 - 806.56] karen todd says finding your books gave
[803.60 - 808.24] me my foot from being amputated due to
[806.56 - 809.04] severe infection that spread throughout
[808.24 - 811.28] my body
[809.04 - 812.40] thank you for all you do for us karen
[811.28 - 815.60] you know like
[812.40 - 818.88] look i understand because
[815.60 - 820.80] it it's the people that haven't suffered
[818.88 - 822.24] and they haven't struggled and they
[820.80 - 822.80] don't know what it's like to be down
[822.24 - 824.64] there
[822.80 - 826.32] in that in that spot they don't know
[824.64 - 828.32] what it's like to have that kind of
[826.32 - 832.24] struggle or suffering right
[828.32 - 833.52] and um i'm slicing these carrots by the
[832.24 - 835.44] way thinly slicing them
[833.52 - 836.72] and they don't know what it what it's
[835.44 - 838.88] like to be there
[836.72 - 840.40] they're easy to judge quick you know
[838.88 - 841.04] they're easy to judge quick they'll be
[840.40 - 843.20] like
[841.04 - 844.96] no don't listen to the m make sure
[843.20 - 846.64] you're on apple cider vinegar make sure
[844.96 - 847.68] you do two tablespoons of apple cider
[846.64 - 850.08] vinegar every day
[847.68 - 852.40] that'll help your foot you know you hear
[850.08 - 854.56] all this kind of information out there
[852.40 - 856.32] and what's sad is that information can
[854.56 - 859.84] get you in trouble and when you're
[856.32 - 863.52] when you're in a situation that's really
[859.84 - 863.92] really tricky and exactly maybe about to
[863.52 - 866.96] get
[863.92 - 867.60] your foot amputated or something every
[866.96 - 871.68] little bit
[867.60 - 874.00] counts every little bit counts
[871.68 - 875.76] it really matters then but if you're
[874.00 - 876.56] you're you're fairly healthy don't have
[875.76 - 878.16] much going on
[876.56 - 879.76] maybe just a little anxiety and a little
[878.16 - 882.96] fatigue right
[879.76 - 884.56] and you're fairly healthy um
[882.96 - 886.16] you know you can you can play around
[884.56 - 887.76] with all these different things
[886.16 - 889.52] but you know what it really counts is
[887.76 - 892.96] when yeah when when
[889.52 - 895.44] when it matters matters the most um
[892.96 - 897.20] elena says i am 70 healed thanks to
[895.44 - 900.40] anthony
[897.20 - 903.04] incredible incredible you know
[900.40 - 904.40] just keep on working at it um rebecca

[918.96 - 922.96] there you'll see
[920.08 - 925.12] the kitchen store okay so it's it's
[922.96 - 928.72] under the kitchen store it's a non-stick
[925.12 - 928.72] ceramic frying pan
[929.76 - 934.16] great glad you guys are here what i'm
[932.00 - 935.36] doing is putting some carrots in here so
[934.16 - 937.28] i think i got enough
[935.36 - 939.12] because this is a nice good sized pan
[937.28 - 940.72] right there
[939.12 - 943.52] all right and now i'm going to do some
[940.72 - 943.52] brussels sprouts
[944.72 - 951.68] i'm going to chop these up a little bit
[948.56 - 953.36] so look you guys one cup sliced carrots
[951.68 - 956.00] we're going to do one um
[953.36 - 957.12] we're gonna do around two cups one to
[956.00 - 959.52] two cups of
[957.12 - 960.72] brussels sprouts now recipe calls for
[959.52 - 962.40] broccoli
[960.72 - 964.56] but i'm gonna throw these really nice
[962.40 - 966.48] brussels sprouts in here too
[964.56 - 970.32] that's what i'm doing now so let me get
[966.48 - 970.32] these in here so this can start cooking
[974.08 - 979.68] um so you know like there's a lot of
[977.68 - 982.24] hackers out there health hackers you
[979.68 - 983.76] guys hear about biohacking have you guys
[982.24 - 987.44] heard about biohacking
[983.76 - 987.44] right and
[988.00 - 992.16] it's really not a good term bio
[990.56 - 994.32] biohacking
[992.16 - 996.00] because really what it means it's a lot
[994.32 - 999.12] of guessing games
[996.00 - 1001.20] so biohacking is really just hey i'm
[999.12 - 1003.84] gonna try to hack my body
[1001.20 - 1006.00] i'm gonna try to trick out my body i'm
[1003.84 - 1008.64] gonna try to psych out my body
[1006.00 - 1010.24] i'm not gonna know what my body needs or
[1008.64 - 1011.84] hear what my body needs
[1010.24 - 1013.76] i'm just going to kind of guess with a
[1011.84 - 1015.76] bunch of crap i find out there and then
[1013.76 - 1019.20] i'm going to try to hack my body
[1015.76 - 1021.44] whether my body likes it or not
[1019.20 - 1023.36] you know so the bio hacking thing is
[1021.44 - 1026.88] really kind of a tough one for me
[1023.36 - 1030.00] because when i hear it i hear
[1026.88 - 1032.32] really hey i don't know what's wrong
[1030.00 - 1033.68] i don't know what my body needs i don't
[1032.32 - 1036.16] know what i should do
[1033.68 - 1039.28] but i'm just going to try to like hack
[1036.16 - 1042.40] it and what i noticed with biohacking
[1039.28 - 1045.44] is all the bio hacking
[1042.40 - 1048.72] all the bio hacking is
[1045.44 - 1050.84] really adrenaline based stuff
[1048.72 - 1052.08] so it's like oh you got all these health
[1050.84 - 1054.96] experts
[1052.08 - 1056.24] and they're all bio hack experts okay
[1054.96 - 1058.64] but really what they're doing
[1056.24 - 1059.60] is they're teaching people how to get
[1058.64 - 1061.52] adrenalized
[1059.60 - 1062.72] they're teaching people how to live on
[1061.52 - 1065.12] adrenaline
[1062.72 - 1067.12] so health experts should really be
[1065.12 - 1068.32] called how to get high on your own
[1067.12 - 1070.96] adrenaline
[1068.32 - 1072.56] not you know let's bio hack and find
[1070.96 - 1075.44] some answers that way
[1072.56 - 1076.96] because bio hacking's really like a lot
[1075.44 - 1077.84] of stuff thrown out there these days
[1076.96 - 1079.44] it's like
[1077.84 - 1080.88] lots of cacao make sure you're doing
[1079.44 - 1082.32] your cacao make sure you're doing your
[1080.88 - 1084.00] apple cider vinegar
[1082.32 - 1086.00] make sure you're doing you know lots of
[1084.00 - 1087.92] your coffee drinks do your matcha tea
[1086.00 - 1089.28] try that that's good for you so
[1087.92 - 1091.04] biohacking can
[1089.28 - 1092.56] you know and then there's also it goes
[1091.04 - 1093.68] beyond that right so you guys i'm
[1092.56 - 1095.68] putting brussels sprouts in there
[1093.68 - 1096.16] biohacking is like not just caffeine
[1095.68 - 1098.16] which
[1096.16 - 1099.92] really that's a big one for biohacking
[1098.16 - 1102.32] get everybody on caffeine
[1099.92 - 1103.52] get everybody on chocolate right but
[1102.32 - 1105.76] biohacking is also
[1103.52 - 1107.68] high fat get everybody on a high fat
[1105.76 - 1108.08] diet that's already been on a high fat
[1107.68 - 1110.00] diet
[1108.08 - 1111.76] who's already gotten sick from being on
[1110.00 - 1114.48] a high fat diet all these years
[1111.76 - 1115.04] and then we say hey get on a high fat
[1114.48 - 1117.28] diet
[1115.04 - 1118.80] you know that's another thing too so but
[1117.28 - 1119.12] i want to talk about that a little bit
[1118.80 - 1121.20] like
[1119.12 - 1122.48] what happens is when you do a high fat
[1121.20 - 1125.04] diet
[1122.48 - 1126.96] because that's what everybody does
[1125.04 - 1127.92] you're burning out your adrenals faster
[1126.96 - 1130.16] than they should be
[1127.92 - 1131.04] you're using your credit card your
[1130.16 - 1132.88] adrenal
[1131.04 - 1134.16] credit card something that's really
[1132.88 - 1138.40] important to know
[1134.16 - 1140.24] see your adrenals are only good
[1138.40 - 1142.24] they're only as good as how you treat
[1140.24 - 1145.44] them and take care of them
[1142.24 - 1147.60] and we waste them throughout the years
[1145.44 - 1149.28] so a lot of the biohackers actually all
[1147.60 - 1151.52] of the biohackers out there
[1149.28 - 1152.56] are really just about wearing down your
[1151.52 - 1154.56] adrenals
[1152.56 - 1156.56] burning them out and one way to do that
[1154.56 - 1158.40] is the high fat diet so what happens is
[1156.56 - 1159.52] when you're eating all this fat
[1158.40 - 1160.80] which you're not going to find in this
[1159.52 - 1162.32] dish by the way when you're eating all
[1160.80 - 1165.04] this fat
[1162.32 - 1166.64] what i call radical fats your blood gets
[1165.04 - 1167.76] thick with that fat and then your
[1166.64 - 1169.68] adrenals
[1167.76 - 1171.76] have to spit out all this adrenaline
[1169.68 - 1175.28] pump all this adrenaline out to thin
[1171.76 - 1178.40] out your blood so your adrenaline
[1175.28 - 1179.60] becomes a blood thinner that's really
[1178.40 - 1182.32] important to know
[1179.60 - 1183.28] the reason why it's trying to save your
[1182.32 - 1186.00] brain
[1183.28 - 1186.88] your brain sends a message to your
[1186.00 - 1190.08] adrenals
[1186.88 - 1191.04] save me that's what your brain does send
[1190.08 - 1194.24] adrenaline
[1191.04 - 1196.72] fast because this person
[1194.24 - 1197.44] actually dumped a ton of fat inside the
[1196.72 - 1199.84] body
[1197.44 - 1201.76] the fat's going to head up to the brain
[1199.84 - 1203.12] and and take the oxygen away
[1201.76 - 1205.44] so here's what happens when you're doing
[1203.12 - 1208.88] the high fat diet you take
[1205.44 - 1211.52] oxygen away from your blood
[1208.88 - 1213.76] you lose oxygen out of your blood that
[1211.52 - 1216.88] means your brain gets less oxygen
[1213.76 - 1220.56] so your brain your nervous system sends
[1216.88 - 1221.12] out a signal an alarm bell that alarm
[1220.56 - 1224.24] bell
[1221.12 - 1227.52] goes right to the adrenals the adrenals
[1224.24 - 1229.20] then floods your bloodstream with a lot
[1227.52 - 1232.40] of adrenaline
[1229.20 - 1234.80] every time you eat your big fatty meal
[1232.40 - 1236.64] okay because the health hackers and the
[1234.80 - 1241.52] biohackers they want you to do that
[1236.64 - 1241.52] every time you do that what happens is
[1242.16 - 1246.40] your brain is begging for help from your
[1244.88 - 1249.68] adrenals
[1246.40 - 1251.28] so it's looking for help your adrenals
[1249.68 - 1254.24] release all this adrenaline the
[1251.28 - 1256.96] adrenaline thins out your blood
[1254.24 - 1258.88] so your brain to save your brain to
[1256.96 - 1260.88] protect your brain
[1258.88 - 1263.20] it ha your adrenals have to release all
[1260.88 - 1266.24] this adrenaline to thin out your blood
[1263.20 - 1268.24] so the fat doesn't kill the brain
[1266.24 - 1269.44] happens every day every meal you have
[1268.24 - 1270.00] you have the bacon and eggs in the
[1269.44 - 1272.24] morning
[1270.00 - 1273.92] your adrenals are pumping you want to do
[1272.24 - 1274.80] a carnivore diet adrenals are pumping
[1273.92 - 1277.20] i'm not anti
[1274.80 - 1279.04] i'm not anti-animal protein you guys i'm
[1277.20 - 1280.16] not anti-vegan plant-based
[1279.04 - 1282.24] i'm just telling you what happens
[1280.16 - 1283.28] because you could be vegan you can be
[1282.24 - 1285.36] plant-based
[1283.28 - 1287.04] right and guess what you're on a
[1285.36 - 1289.92] high-fat diet
[1287.04 - 1291.36] um tiffany says i'm so confused you
[1289.92 - 1294.48] didn't use any oil
[1291.36 - 1295.20] no oil needed in stir fry you got a hot
[1294.48 - 1297.76] pan
[1295.20 - 1299.04] right here hot ceramic pan i got the
[1297.76 - 1300.56] carrots in here i got the brussels
[1299.04 - 1300.88] sprouts i'm cooking them down a little
[1300.56 - 1302.56] bit
[1300.88 - 1304.00] i got the heat on i just put a little
[1302.56 - 1305.68] water a little touch
[1304.00 - 1307.60] just a little water in there that's all
[1305.68 - 1309.44] you needed to do
[1307.60 - 1311.12] so i'll give you guys a little recap
[1309.44 - 1313.20] this is really important to know
[1311.12 - 1315.60] when you're told to do those high fat
[1313.20 - 1318.80] diets which everybody's told to do
[1315.60 - 1321.92] okay what is happening is your brain
[1318.80 - 1322.96] is crying for help sends a signal down
[1321.92 - 1324.96] to the adrenals
[1322.96 - 1326.08] the adrenals release all this
[1324.96 - 1328.56] epinephrine
[1326.08 - 1329.92] to thin out your blood so that the fat
[1328.56 - 1332.80] doesn't rob oxygen
[1329.92 - 1334.00] from your brain right now you're on an
[1332.80 - 1335.52] adrenal high
[1334.00 - 1337.12] so now that's a lie a lot of people are
[1335.52 - 1338.80] like whoa i just had that
[1337.12 - 1340.88] i just had the animal protein i'm
[1338.80 - 1342.96] starting to just i feel better now
[1340.88 - 1344.88] i feel like myself what's happening is
[1342.96 - 1347.20] you're getting the adrenaline surge
[1344.88 - 1348.32] or say you're plant-based say you're
[1347.20 - 1351.52] plant-based
[1348.32 - 1354.08] okay say you're vegan i just ate a whole
[1351.52 - 1355.76] pile of nuts
[1354.08 - 1357.84] i just ate a whole bunch of macadamia
[1355.76 - 1361.36] nuts i just ate a whole
[1357.84 - 1363.04] whole pile of peanuts i just had a
[1361.36 - 1365.44] two tablespoons three tablespoons of
[1363.04 - 1367.04] peanut butter on my smoothie bowl
[1365.44 - 1368.80] i just had some almond butter and almond
[1367.04 - 1373.20] milk you know
[1368.80 - 1374.88] i just had some butter some
[1373.20 - 1376.56] if ghee if you're into animal protein i
[1374.88 - 1378.16] just had some butter and so what's
[1376.56 - 1381.36] happening is
[1378.16 - 1382.00] just so you know you can be plant-based
[1381.36 - 1384.00] and vegan
[1382.00 - 1385.20] and you can kill your adrenals over time
[1384.00 - 1387.20] now hey hey hey
[1385.20 - 1388.48] sounds a little too much right you're
[1387.20 - 1390.08] killing your adrenals
[1388.48 - 1392.08] how can that be just because you're
[1390.08 - 1392.64] eating a high fat diet whether it's
[1392.08 - 1394.56] healthy
[1392.64 - 1396.00] or not how can that be i mean this
[1394.56 - 1397.28] doesn't sound right you guys i just cut
[1396.00 - 1397.84] the bell pepper i showed you this the
[1397.28 - 1399.68] other day
[1397.84 - 1402.00] i cut the top off right there and i'm
[1399.68 - 1405.84] just taking out the center
[1402.00 - 1408.00] that's all and i got the bell pepper
[1405.84 - 1409.20] you might be thinking it's kind of harsh
[1408.00 - 1410.56] isn't it he's
[1409.20 - 1412.80] he's saying that we're killing our
[1410.56 - 1415.84] adrenals on the high fat diet
[1412.80 - 1416.88] you know how's that possible well here's
[1415.84 - 1419.04] how it goes
[1416.88 - 1420.64] your adrenals don't die quick and they
[1419.04 - 1423.20] don't die too easy
[1420.64 - 1425.12] so they hang on because they have to
[1423.20 - 1427.04] because that's how we stay alive
[1425.12 - 1429.20] it's our adrenals that keep us alive
[1427.04 - 1430.56] that's a big part of how we stay alive
[1429.20 - 1431.92] right cutting up some
[1430.56 - 1434.56] bell pepper here but here's what goes
[1431.92 - 1436.16] wrong you keep on doing it you keep on
[1434.56 - 1437.76] doing everybody has different levels
[1436.16 - 1439.68] they have a different adrenal strengths
[1437.76 - 1441.76] different levels of tolerance
[1439.68 - 1442.96] some people have weaker adrenals some
[1441.76 - 1444.64] people have one
[1442.96 - 1446.80] one adrenal that's stronger than the
[1444.64 - 1449.52] other right but then
[1446.80 - 1450.80] you also get someone where it hits them
[1449.52 - 1452.32] pretty good along the way
[1450.80 - 1454.88] they don't know it until they have their
[1452.32 - 1458.00] baby yeah
[1454.88 - 1461.20] hard pregnancies are from weak
[1458.00 - 1462.56] adrenals throughout the years from high
[1461.20 - 1466.64] fat diets
[1462.56 - 1469.68] from caffeine from chocolate okay
[1466.64 - 1472.72] all right from from uh and
[1469.68 - 1474.40] hard child births hard pregnancy
[1472.72 - 1476.64] hard child birth because here's what
[1474.40 - 1480.16] happens it's
[1476.64 - 1483.04] in order to have a baby your adrenals
[1480.16 - 1484.00] have to be supersonic they got to be
[1483.04 - 1486.88] powerful
[1484.00 - 1488.24] they got to be strong so a woman's
[1486.88 - 1490.48] adrenals are not like
[1488.24 - 1493.36] men's adrenals and men don't know this
[1490.48 - 1495.84] so men health hackers and biohackers
[1493.36 - 1497.60] all over the internet out there they'll
[1495.84 - 1498.80] just tell you do lots of caffeine that's
[1497.60 - 1502.40] how you do your matcha tea
[1498.80 - 1504.16] do your cacao do your high fat diets but
[1502.40 - 1506.08] they're not the ones that are going to
[1504.16 - 1508.08] have that hard childbirth potentially or
[1506.08 - 1509.60] the second baby being really difficult
[1508.08 - 1511.04] because the adrenals start to weaken
[1509.60 - 1514.24] over time
[1511.04 - 1517.68] so what happens is you need
[1514.24 - 1521.60] your adrenals working top notch
[1517.68 - 1524.24] when you deliver a baby when a baby
[1521.60 - 1525.60] is born when you birth a baby so it's
[1524.24 - 1528.80] very important to know this
[1525.60 - 1530.16] but there's a lot of women right now and
[1528.80 - 1531.60] young women they're saying that was a
[1530.16 - 1534.56] really difficult labor
[1531.60 - 1535.28] the labor went four hours why the labor
[1534.56 - 1538.56] went
[1535.28 - 1542.16] seven hours how come the labor went two
[1538.56 - 1543.04] days how come like why does it have to
[1542.16 - 1546.72] be that hard
[1543.04 - 1550.72] labor to go two days and
[1546.72 - 1552.80] um and what they don't know
[1550.72 - 1555.04] is all those years even if it was two
[1552.80 - 1557.36] years even it was three years
[1555.04 - 1558.40] of the coffee drinks the matcha tea the
[1557.36 - 1561.60] energy drinks
[1558.40 - 1563.76] the chocolate chocolate every week
[1561.60 - 1565.76] all the cacao cacao nibs whatever
[1563.76 - 1568.80] chocolate bars whatever
[1565.76 - 1570.00] all of that beats down the adrenals and
[1568.80 - 1571.12] here's another thing that kills the
[1570.00 - 1572.88] adrenals for women so they have
[1571.12 - 1573.84] difficult child births here's another
[1572.88 - 1577.36] thing
[1573.84 - 1579.84] intermittent fasting epic disaster
[1577.36 - 1581.44] for childbirth okay years of
[1579.84 - 1583.68] intermittent fasting
[1581.44 - 1585.52] breaks down the adrenals because you run
[1583.68 - 1588.48] on adrenaline all day
[1585.52 - 1590.32] you withhold food so your adrenals have
[1588.48 - 1593.36] to release adrenaline
[1590.32 - 1595.52] to replace glucose so now
[1593.36 - 1597.60] glucose has to be replaced that's your
[1595.52 - 1600.08] blood sugar glucose right
[1597.60 - 1601.60] so you have no glucose going on you're
[1600.08 - 1604.80] intermittent fasting
[1601.60 - 1607.36] right and you're going without food
[1604.80 - 1609.92] you're on caffeine all day long
[1607.36 - 1612.08] and your adrenals are flooding all day
[1609.92 - 1616.64] long your adrenals are flooding all day
[1612.08 - 1618.32] long see and they start to wear down
[1616.64 - 1621.04] so then you got so here's what's
[1618.32 - 1623.36] happening biohackers are teaching women
[1621.04 - 1624.56] women biohackers too men biohackers are
[1623.36 - 1627.20] teaching women
[1624.56 - 1629.20] to intermittent fast the wrong way okay
[1627.20 - 1630.88] to get all jacked up on caffeine
[1629.20 - 1633.76] and to do high fat diets when they do
[1630.88 - 1637.20] eat the combination of all three
[1633.76 - 1641.04] is an epic disaster for child for for
[1637.20 - 1642.56] for delivering a baby okay and
[1641.04 - 1645.36] and so that's very important to know
[1642.56 - 1647.04] it's also an epic disaster for future
[1645.36 - 1648.48] hair thinning and hair loss and what
[1647.04 - 1649.84] you'll find is women
[1648.48 - 1652.08] end up getting hair thinning after
[1649.84 - 1654.80] having a baby yeah
[1652.08 - 1656.08] because it's just too much too much
[1654.80 - 1659.04] happened to their adrenals
[1656.08 - 1661.36] in the years before they had their baby
[1659.04 - 1663.20] too many things happen to their adrenals
[1661.36 - 1665.12] and the hair started thinning and then
[1663.20 - 1666.16] they get the sunspots and the age spots
[1665.12 - 1668.16] everywhere
[1666.16 - 1670.00] and then they get they they get the weak
[1668.16 - 1671.76] adrenals and then they lose energy and
[1670.00 - 1674.56] then they need more caffeine and more
[1671.76 - 1677.76] caffeine and more caffeine
[1674.56 - 1681.44] so chopping up some
[1677.76 - 1683.20] orange bell pepper here so bio hackers
[1681.44 - 1683.92] and health experts really shouldn't be
[1683.20 - 1686.00] called
[1683.92 - 1687.84] health experts well actually they should
[1686.00 - 1689.52] be they're health experts to how to
[1687.84 - 1691.76] trash your adrenals
[1689.52 - 1692.88] weaken adrenals shorten them for the
[1691.76 - 1694.72] long haul
[1692.88 - 1696.32] make life more difficult for millions of
[1694.72 - 1698.24] women and
[1696.32 - 1699.52] even some men in some ways in different
[1698.24 - 1701.12] ways but
[1699.52 - 1702.72] especially for women especially for
[1701.12 - 1705.76] women
[1702.72 - 1708.32] you need your adrenals to be on point
[1705.76 - 1711.84] for threatening events
[1708.32 - 1716.64] hard times a divorce
[1711.84 - 1721.52] a bad breakup a betrayal car accident
[1716.64 - 1721.52] you know you can't lift up a car
[1722.00 - 1725.60] you know out of a ditch off of somebody
[1724.08 - 1727.36] that's trapped under it
[1725.60 - 1730.00] when your adrenals have had 10 years of
[1727.36 - 1732.40] caffeine 10 years of high fat diets
[1730.00 - 1734.08] 10 years of intermittent fasting you
[1732.40 - 1736.32] won't get that car off that person
[1734.08 - 1737.84] underneath that car
[1736.32 - 1740.72] you will though if you protect your
[1737.84 - 1742.96] adrenals and keep those adrenals strong
[1740.72 - 1745.20] and not get tricked and fooled by
[1742.96 - 1748.48] biohackers
[1745.20 - 1750.40] so something really important to know
[1748.48 - 1752.08] um i got some red bell peppers here i
[1750.40 - 1753.68] got some orange bell peppers i got some
[1752.08 - 1755.20] brussels sprouts in here too and i got
[1753.68 - 1756.72] some carrots i'm making a stir fry it's
[1755.20 - 1758.32] called sweet and sour stir-fry
[1756.72 - 1760.08] if you guys just got on here it's a
[1758.32 - 1760.64] medical medium new addition right here a
[1760.08 - 1762.64] recipe
[1760.64 - 1764.64] right out of this brand new book coming
[1762.64 - 1767.60] out that's the recipe i'm making
[1764.64 - 1768.88] so i just want to let you know and
[1767.60 - 1771.04] here's the other thing
[1768.88 - 1772.32] your adrenals are what creates the most
[1771.04 - 1773.84] important hormones
[1772.32 - 1776.32] so everybody's worried about hormones my
[1773.84 - 1777.92] hormones my hormones my hormones doctor
[1776.32 - 1779.12] says worry about my hormones
[1777.92 - 1782.00] doctor says she's worried about my
[1779.12 - 1784.16] hormones my reproductive system
[1782.00 - 1785.44] my hormones maybe my hormones are off
[1784.16 - 1787.76] that's what you'll hear right
[1785.44 - 1788.80] your your adrenals are the hormone
[1787.76 - 1791.28] makers
[1788.80 - 1792.64] the liver is the second hormone maker
[1791.28 - 1795.84] but the adrenals
[1792.64 - 1799.20] that's the big one that's your estrogen
[1795.84 - 1800.56] that's your that is where that's where
[1799.20 - 1802.48] it's happening right there
[1800.56 - 1803.60] it's those adrenals so that's your
[1802.48 - 1805.68] testosterone
[1803.60 - 1807.44] you need that testosterone that's your
[1805.68 - 1809.92] estrogen those adrenals
[1807.44 - 1811.60] are what's cranking that out every day
[1809.92 - 1813.20] so when you're worried about hormones
[1811.60 - 1814.24] and you say well my doctor says my
[1813.20 - 1816.32] hormones are off
[1814.24 - 1817.84] my nutritionist said maybe my hormones
[1816.32 - 1820.24] are off you know
[1817.84 - 1822.00] you know all that well guess what at the
[1820.24 - 1823.68] same time your nutritionist is going to
[1822.00 - 1824.16] tell you to do the high fat diet tell
[1823.68 - 1825.76] you
[1824.16 - 1828.00] matcha tea is just fine eat lots of
[1825.76 - 1829.68] chocolate it's good for you studies say
[1828.00 - 1831.52] and they're going to tell you that and
[1829.68 - 1832.88] then they're going to tell you with all
[1831.52 - 1834.00] that and the coffee and the coffee
[1832.88 - 1835.76] drinks and
[1834.00 - 1837.36] the chocolate and the intermittent
[1835.76 - 1839.20] fasting they're going to tell you to do
[1837.36 - 1840.72] with all that combined and then they'll
[1839.20 - 1841.92] say hey you know what
[1840.72 - 1843.28] and all that's going to be killing your
[1841.92 - 1845.52] adrenals which is going to mess up your
[1843.28 - 1847.44] hormones more and more and more and more
[1845.52 - 1849.68] but then they're going to say why don't
[1847.44 - 1852.16] you do some hot yoga
[1849.68 - 1853.60] why don't you do some hot yoga that's an
[1852.16 - 1855.12] adrenal destroyer
[1853.60 - 1856.64] right there i got nothing against yoga i
[1855.12 - 1857.92] think it's great i think you know i
[1856.64 - 1861.04] think it's great
[1857.92 - 1862.72] hot yoga it's ridiculous it's actually
[1861.04 - 1864.80] the adrenal crusher
[1862.72 - 1866.64] what hot yoga does if you do it long
[1864.80 - 1868.32] term will make sure that when you do
[1866.64 - 1870.48] want to have that baby
[1868.32 - 1872.40] that's going to be a hard birth okay not
[1870.48 - 1875.12] everybody because their adrenals are
[1872.40 - 1876.96] maybe stronger than someone else's but
[1875.12 - 1878.56] eventually it catches up to everybody
[1876.96 - 1879.92] and it catches up to them later on in
[1878.56 - 1883.28] life in different ways
[1879.92 - 1885.60] maybe fatigue maybe aging faster
[1883.28 - 1887.68] maybe you know sensitive nervous systems
[1885.60 - 1888.40] from adrenaline pumping through them so
[1887.68 - 1891.04] much
[1888.40 - 1891.68] so health experts and biohackers are
[1891.04 - 1895.20] really
[1891.68 - 1896.80] adrenal destroyer experts
[1895.20 - 1899.28] they promote everything that destroys
[1896.80 - 1900.88] adrenals shortens women's lives as far
[1899.28 - 1903.12] as aging them faster
[1900.88 - 1904.56] making life more difficult and then
[1903.12 - 1907.52] they'll tell you to do the saunas
[1904.56 - 1909.28] with a really high temps you know really
[1907.52 - 1912.40] high temperatures they'll say
[1909.28 - 1915.44] do the saunas high temperatures true
[1912.40 - 1916.40] 130 degree 150 degrees stay in there for
[1915.44 - 1919.52] 40 minutes
[1916.40 - 1921.36] whatever and what you'll do is right on
[1919.52 - 1923.92] the edge of hyperthermia
[1921.36 - 1924.88] your body goes into shock and goes into
[1923.92 - 1927.12] crisis
[1924.88 - 1929.04] and then you and then that high comes
[1927.12 - 1930.16] out because your adrenals are flooding
[1929.04 - 1932.24] in for dear life
[1930.16 - 1933.76] your brain's saying you're cooking my
[1932.24 - 1936.96] freaking brain
[1933.76 - 1938.24] your brain is telling your adrenals god
[1936.96 - 1940.40] help me you're cooking
[1938.24 - 1942.16] my brain so you're sitting there being
[1940.40 - 1944.72] told to do these really hot
[1942.16 - 1945.60] hot hot yoga you're doing the real hot
[1944.72 - 1947.12] saunas
[1945.60 - 1949.36] you've got the temperature really high
[1947.12 - 1951.44] you're told to stay in there longer
[1949.36 - 1952.80] and what's happening is your brain is
[1951.44 - 1955.76] starting to cook
[1952.80 - 1956.40] and then it's calling for adrenaline to
[1955.76 - 1959.76] save
[1956.40 - 1961.20] its life which is your life so
[1959.76 - 1962.96] the adrenals are flooding all this
[1961.20 - 1965.12] adrenaline by the time you're 30 minutes
[1962.96 - 1968.00] 40 minutes into your hot sauna
[1965.12 - 1969.12] which is another brainiac really silly
[1968.00 - 1971.04] idea
[1969.12 - 1972.32] and then your adrenals are now like
[1971.04 - 1974.00] you're wasting them and
[1972.32 - 1976.32] wasting them and then you feel high
[1974.00 - 1977.36] after that sauna that really hot one i'm
[1976.32 - 1978.96] not talking about going into the
[1977.36 - 1980.16] infrared sauna for five minutes 10
[1978.96 - 1982.00] minutes 20 minutes
[1980.16 - 1983.52] you know at a reasonable temp i'm
[1982.00 - 1986.40] talking about
[1983.52 - 1987.04] you know not even like 105 whatever you
[1986.40 - 1988.80] know
[1987.04 - 1990.88] the point is is you're going in high
[1988.80 - 1992.80] temperatures in these saunas now
[1990.88 - 1994.48] and what you're doing is you're getting
[1992.80 - 1996.64] high off of adrenaline so
[1994.48 - 1997.52] biohackers and health experts are
[1996.64 - 2000.32] experts
[1997.52 - 2002.96] at destroying your adrenals shortening
[2000.32 - 2005.28] and aging your life
[2002.96 - 2006.40] setting you up for misery later on when
[2005.28 - 2007.92] you're in your 40s
[2006.40 - 2009.68] so when you're 22 and you're doing your
[2007.92 - 2011.44] hot saunas and it sounds like a great
[2009.68 - 2012.80] idea and you got these cool guys and
[2011.44 - 2014.32] cool people whatever
[2012.80 - 2016.24] and telling you what to do you do this
[2014.32 - 2018.96] hot sauna you crank it up
[2016.24 - 2019.92] and now you get high afterwards they're
[2018.96 - 2022.88] still robbing
[2019.92 - 2023.76] and stealing they're vampires that are
[2022.88 - 2027.12] robbing
[2023.76 - 2030.80] and stealing your adrenaline reserves
[2027.12 - 2032.64] breaking down your adrenals and
[2030.80 - 2034.16] yeah saunas are very healing when you
[2032.64 - 2037.44] use them right
[2034.16 - 2039.68] but see biohackers and health experts
[2037.44 - 2040.88] they don't use a lot of things right
[2039.68 - 2042.64] they don't
[2040.88 - 2044.08] and the same thing with cold plungers
[2042.64 - 2046.72] and cold
[2044.08 - 2047.68] and you know cold plunges okay that's
[2046.72 - 2050.88] another thing too
[2047.68 - 2052.96] any kind of cold shock therapy all right
[2050.88 - 2056.48] it's any kind of cold shock therapy i'm
[2052.96 - 2056.48] gonna get some asparagus in here now
[2058.88 - 2062.32] anything in the hypothermic realm so
[2060.96 - 2063.84] when you sit there and you freeze
[2062.32 - 2066.16] yourself
[2063.84 - 2068.00] what you're doing is you're putting your
[2066.16 - 2069.76] body in shock and then your adrenals are
[2068.00 - 2071.60] now cooking again they're cranking
[2069.76 - 2073.20] your adrenals are now flooding again you
[2071.60 - 2074.72] see how it works
[2073.20 - 2076.64] so now you're killing your adrenals
[2074.72 - 2077.92] again because your brain's saying you're
[2076.64 - 2081.28] freezing me
[2077.92 - 2084.64] see so when you do the cold plunges
[2081.28 - 2085.12] and the cold therapies your brain is
[2084.64 - 2088.56] saying
[2085.12 - 2090.80] okay now you're freezing you're freezing
[2088.56 - 2093.20] my ass off is what your brain's saying
[2090.80 - 2094.48] send out the adrenaline army send out
[2093.20 - 2096.16] the adrenaline reserves
[2094.48 - 2098.48] because we need adrenaline here because
[2096.16 - 2101.68] you're putting me in shock
[2098.48 - 2102.64] so it's not just the heat it's also the
[2101.68 - 2105.76] cold
[2102.64 - 2106.88] see it's life threatening in the entire
[2105.76 - 2108.32] brain
[2106.88 - 2109.76] so how do you use this karen how do you
[2108.32 - 2111.52] use the sauna correctly you can use an
[2109.76 - 2113.92] infrared sun you can also use a steam
[2111.52 - 2115.76] shower steam bath sauna steam
[2113.92 - 2117.20] so you can do that but you don't cook
[2115.76 - 2119.28] yourself you stay in there
[2117.20 - 2120.80] for a little while you need to do 15 20
[2119.28 - 2123.28] minutes do 10 minutes
[2120.80 - 2124.32] keep the temps reasonable don't keep
[2123.28 - 2127.28] them blaring
[2124.32 - 2129.28] and don't be a hero because the
[2127.28 - 2130.96] biohackers
[2129.28 - 2132.40] what they do is they don't care about
[2130.96 - 2134.64] women's health really
[2132.40 - 2135.52] they're usually men and they usually
[2134.64 - 2137.36] tell you
[2135.52 - 2139.68] to just push it to the limit push it to
[2137.36 - 2141.52] the max and that's what they do
[2139.68 - 2143.76] and so they'll end up saying they won't
[2141.52 - 2145.92] do something they won't be protective
[2143.76 - 2148.00] over women they won't be like no be
[2145.92 - 2149.60] cautious keep the heat at a reasonable
[2148.00 - 2151.92] rate just be in there for a certain
[2149.60 - 2153.68] amount of time check out how you feel
[2151.92 - 2155.60] you won't hear any of that you'll hear
[2153.68 - 2157.04] here's what you do here's the new trend
[2155.60 - 2160.16] here's a new fad
[2157.04 - 2162.32] crank it you know and do it every day do
[2160.16 - 2165.36] your sauna crank the heat up
[2162.32 - 2167.52] and and then people get damaged
[2165.36 - 2169.12] they get damaged later on you might not
[2167.52 - 2171.12] sense it in the moment you might not
[2169.12 - 2173.36] sense it in the first year or two
[2171.12 - 2174.80] you'll sense it later on and then your
[2173.36 - 2176.88] adrenals are cooked
[2174.80 - 2179.44] things are actually you're in a lot
[2176.88 - 2180.72] difficult situation with your health
[2179.44 - 2182.56] and if you're somebody with chronic
[2180.72 - 2185.36] illness if you have anything going on if
[2182.56 - 2187.20] you have fibro or cfs me or anything
[2185.36 - 2189.04] lupus forget that symptoms how about
[2187.20 - 2191.44] symptoms you know feel good you got
[2189.04 - 2193.28] fatigue you got ace and pains
[2191.44 - 2195.28] you know your feet hurt your back hurt
[2193.28 - 2196.64] your neck how you've got teeth that hurt
[2195.28 - 2198.88] your neck hurts right
[2196.64 - 2200.32] any of that you got to be careful you do
[2198.88 - 2202.88] the sauna carefully
[2200.32 - 2203.44] do the infrared one you can do a steam
[2202.88 - 2207.04] sun
[2203.44 - 2208.40] carefully so you be mindful
[2207.04 - 2210.16] which leads me to the next thing i have
[2208.40 - 2212.24] to tell you guys because that just
[2210.16 - 2215.36] reminded me about something okay
[2212.24 - 2218.72] everybody's so spiritual you know
[2215.36 - 2221.76] everybody's so spiritual everybody's
[2218.72 - 2223.52] you know into self-care everybody's
[2221.76 - 2225.28] honoring their body
[2223.52 - 2227.04] right like you hear it now everybody
[2225.28 - 2228.40] hears it everybody's talking about it
[2227.04 - 2230.08] everybody's honoring their body
[2228.40 - 2232.88] everybody's so careful
[2230.08 - 2234.00] on that level where they're like hey i'm
[2232.88 - 2237.20] honoring my body
[2234.00 - 2238.80] i'm using my intuition okay everybody's
[2237.20 - 2242.40] so spiritual
[2238.80 - 2244.32] right and meanwhile
[2242.40 - 2245.52] they're not listening to their body
[2244.32 - 2249.68] they're not
[2245.52 - 2252.88] you know being spiritual is about
[2249.68 - 2255.36] letting some things go like vices
[2252.88 - 2256.64] and it's okay if you can't let a vice go
[2255.36 - 2259.20] it's all right
[2256.64 - 2260.72] that's okay i get it some people need
[2259.20 - 2262.88] devices absolutely
[2260.72 - 2265.04] they need them to survive life is hard
[2262.88 - 2268.24] i'm putting green onion in here
[2265.04 - 2270.32] scallions but
[2268.24 - 2272.88] there's a lot of people these days
[2270.32 - 2276.08] they're acting like spiritual experts
[2272.88 - 2278.32] acting like they're so spiritual
[2276.08 - 2280.00] and they're literally intermittent fast
[2278.32 - 2281.60] intermittent fasting they're on caffeine
[2280.00 - 2283.04] all day long they're doing all this
[2281.60 - 2284.72] caffeine on their body they're doing
[2283.04 - 2287.84] chocolate all day
[2284.72 - 2289.04] and being spiritual is living without a
[2287.84 - 2291.60] little bit you know what i mean
[2289.04 - 2293.52] being spiritual is learning how to let
[2291.60 - 2297.20] go of vice
[2293.52 - 2300.72] and then feeling what that feeling is
[2297.20 - 2304.24] being spiritual is being able to like
[2300.72 - 2305.92] give your body something truly back so
[2304.24 - 2308.24] instead of saying everybody's honoring
[2305.92 - 2311.04] their body you know what own it
[2308.24 - 2312.00] okay just finally own it you're not
[2311.04 - 2315.44] honoring your body
[2312.00 - 2319.12] totally be straight out be honest please
[2315.44 - 2321.76] okay you know what i mean because
[2319.12 - 2323.52] if you really were to honor your body
[2321.76 - 2324.72] you'd break out of the caffeine
[2323.52 - 2328.24] addiction
[2324.72 - 2330.80] let it go and fix what's wrong
[2328.24 - 2332.72] the caffeine hides everything so it's
[2330.80 - 2334.32] hiding everything for everybody it's got
[2332.72 - 2336.96] them on a big high
[2334.32 - 2338.32] and look look i'm not judging anybody i
[2336.96 - 2341.68] look i know some people
[2338.32 - 2343.28] had some hard lives hard lives and
[2341.68 - 2344.72] that cup of coffee pushes them through
[2343.28 - 2348.48] their day okay
[2344.72 - 2349.84] and i got friends with hard lives and
[2348.48 - 2352.32] you know they were like look i'm working
[2349.84 - 2354.72] on it i'm like totally i totally get it
[2352.32 - 2355.52] it's just that some of the friends i
[2354.72 - 2357.52] have
[2355.52 - 2359.20] they're not saying how down they how how
[2357.52 - 2360.32] they got it all down they're not saying
[2359.20 - 2362.16] how spiritual they are
[2360.32 - 2363.76] acting so spiritual they're not
[2362.16 - 2364.80] pretending on their youtube channels how
[2363.76 - 2367.20] spiritual they are
[2364.80 - 2369.28] you know they're straight out they're
[2367.20 - 2370.24] saying i got a lot of work to do you
[2369.28 - 2372.40] know they're humble
[2370.24 - 2373.60] i got a lot of work to do i'm trying to
[2372.40 - 2375.92] honor my body
[2373.60 - 2377.92] but i'm just not there yet you know
[2375.92 - 2379.68] right now life's hard i'm pushing
[2377.92 - 2383.44] through each hour man
[2379.68 - 2385.92] anthony i'm pushing through hour by hour
[2383.44 - 2387.12] and i know i need to work on stuff and
[2385.92 - 2388.48] at least i know
[2387.12 - 2390.40] and that's the key right there but
[2388.48 - 2391.84] what's happening here is people are
[2390.40 - 2394.16] being told
[2391.84 - 2395.52] things are good for them now everybody's
[2394.16 - 2396.88] saying hey the caffeine caffeine's good
[2395.52 - 2398.48] for you everybody's saying the coffee
[2396.88 - 2398.96] drinks and the chocolate is so good for
[2398.48 - 2401.12] you
[2398.96 - 2402.00] and then everybody's like i'm honoring
[2401.12 - 2405.12] my body
[2402.00 - 2406.96] i'm being so spiritual i'm you know i'm
[2405.12 - 2409.60] i'm a health expert now
[2406.96 - 2410.00] and come on let's just be real a little
[2409.60 - 2413.20] bit
[2410.00 - 2414.88] because if you removed that caffeine
[2413.20 - 2416.72] you would notice depression starts to
[2414.88 - 2418.40] kick in you'd notice that fatigue starts
[2416.72 - 2419.04] to kick in you can't do your workouts
[2418.40 - 2420.56] anymore
[2419.04 - 2422.24] you know that anxiety would start
[2420.56 - 2423.04] kicking in and that's when you honor
[2422.24 - 2424.96] your body
[2423.04 - 2426.56] that's when you're spiritual because
[2424.96 - 2428.56] you're without your vice
[2426.56 - 2429.60] and you're honoring your body and you
[2428.56 - 2431.28] start
[2429.60 - 2433.76] and you start you know and you get off
[2431.28 - 2435.68] that high fat diet and you realize whoa
[2433.76 - 2437.28] wait a minute what's wrong here honoring
[2435.68 - 2439.44] your body is
[2437.28 - 2440.96] finding out what's really wrong too it's
[2439.44 - 2443.28] it's about hey
[2440.96 - 2444.96] i got a problem i can't focus and
[2443.28 - 2447.84] concentrate without my caffeine
[2444.96 - 2449.84] how do i fix this you know i can't
[2447.84 - 2451.52] function without my caffeine i can't do
[2449.84 - 2453.44] my two hour workouts now every day
[2451.52 - 2457.20] because without my caffeine
[2453.44 - 2459.44] or how about this i got to keep my
[2457.20 - 2461.52] caffeine in order to function
[2459.44 - 2462.48] i know it's not good for me i know it's
[2461.52 - 2463.76] a drug
[2462.48 - 2465.68] you know i know everybody's trying to
[2463.76 - 2469.20] pretend it's good for you now
[2465.68 - 2471.76] but you know honoring honoring you
[2469.20 - 2473.44] honoring your body is really about being
[2471.76 - 2474.72] self-aware for real like really
[2473.44 - 2477.44] self-actualized
[2474.72 - 2478.32] really self-realized it's about saying
[2477.44 - 2481.12] hey
[2478.32 - 2482.16] you know i know i need work you know
[2481.12 - 2484.08] it's about a little bit
[2482.16 - 2485.28] humbling a little bit about knowing you
[2484.08 - 2487.44] need some work
[2485.28 - 2488.72] i've just seen a lot lately people think
[2487.44 - 2490.40] they got it all down
[2488.72 - 2491.76] spiritually they got it all down where
[2490.40 - 2493.04] they're talking the good stuff
[2491.76 - 2495.60] they're talking about they're honoring
[2493.04 - 2497.84] their body they're talking about
[2495.60 - 2499.60] that whole thing they're saying how in
[2497.84 - 2501.28] their intuition is off the charts and
[2499.60 - 2504.40] their intuition is so strong
[2501.28 - 2506.96] right i hear that a lot but
[2504.40 - 2506.96] you know what
[2507.44 - 2511.12] they need some work anyway they need
[2509.92 - 2513.04] caffeine for energy
[2511.12 - 2514.32] because there's some problems okay so
[2513.04 - 2516.80] look i'm going to make some sauce right
[2514.32 - 2518.64] here so i'm going to do that now
[2516.80 - 2520.56] so i got a stir fry going i got some
[2518.64 - 2522.00] asparagus on here
[2520.56 - 2524.08] i'm going to start with some pineapple
[2522.00 - 2524.72] juice look this is a pineapple juice
[2524.08 - 2527.76] right here
[2524.72 - 2530.00] it's a really good organic one so
[2527.76 - 2531.44] i got that now i don't have a fresh
[2530.00 - 2534.72] pineapple
[2531.44 - 2535.92] to juice so i'm going to use pineapple
[2534.72 - 2537.92] juice that's what i'm gonna do right

[2619.76 - 2623.84] expert like a real one
[2622.40 - 2625.60] being honest with yourself and i know
[2623.84 - 2627.52] you guys are honest with yourselves

[2633.60 - 2639.44] guys
[2634.16 - 2639.44] okay but you know
[2639.60 - 2642.56] but the thing is is when you're a health
[2641.12 - 2643.36] expert and you never suffered or
[2642.56 - 2647.12] struggled
[2643.36 - 2649.04] never had any problems you're young and
[2647.12 - 2650.64] everything's taken care of for you and
[2649.04 - 2652.32] you're out there promoting the heck out
[2650.64 - 2654.48] of a
[2652.32 - 2656.08] a caffeine product and it's keeping you
[2654.48 - 2657.84] running around like crazy and it's
[2656.08 - 2658.48] hiding your anxiety and it's hiding your
[2657.84 - 2660.32] fatigue
[2658.48 - 2662.00] and it's hiding your depression and
[2660.32 - 2663.68] you're telling another hundred thousand
[2662.00 - 2666.88] people or fifty thousand people that
[2663.68 - 2669.44] they should be jacked up on caffeine too
[2666.88 - 2670.64] it's not really honoring your body or
[2669.44 - 2672.00] others
[2670.64 - 2674.32] or teaching them how to intermittent
[2672.00 - 2676.16] fast wrong getting some lime juice here
[2674.32 - 2677.68] okay two tablespoons of lime juice in
[2676.16 - 2681.36] this
[2677.68 - 2681.36] i'm gonna put some grated ginger in here
[2682.80 - 2686.56] you know when you're a health expert
[2684.08 - 2688.48] you're supposed to protect people right
[2686.56 - 2690.00] that's what you're supposed to do and
[2688.48 - 2693.12] you're supposed to give in
[2690.00 - 2696.16] a little bit right give in
[2693.12 - 2699.68] be honest be truthful
[2696.16 - 2702.72] about what you're doing it's like
[2699.68 - 2704.96] protecting people is the number one
[2702.72 - 2707.44] thing that should be in your soul and on
[2704.96 - 2710.56] your mind as a health expert
[2707.44 - 2710.96] that's the critical thing that you gotta
[2710.56 - 2714.48] be
[2710.96 - 2714.48] and it's hard to protect people when
[2714.64 - 2718.16] you know you're training them to be
[2716.24 - 2719.84] jacked up on caffeine
[2718.16 - 2721.68] training them to lose their adrenal
[2719.84 - 2722.88] strength so they have difficult
[2721.68 - 2724.16] childbirths later
[2722.88 - 2725.68] training them for all these things so
[2724.16 - 2726.88] i'm going to put i got it next thing i'm
[2725.68 - 2729.92] going to put a little
[2726.88 - 2731.68] tomato paste in here that's what i'm
[2729.92 - 2734.32] doing now
[2731.68 - 2734.32] get a spoon
[2735.28 - 2739.20] so right now i have a cup of pineapple
[2738.16 - 2741.20] juice in here
[2739.20 - 2742.32] all right so i got that i'm going to put
[2741.20 - 2745.28] some tomato paste
[2742.32 - 2748.64] a couple teaspoons in here or a couple
[2745.28 - 2751.20] tablespoons of tomato paste in the sauce
[2748.64 - 2751.20] there we go
[2754.16 - 2757.52] so i got that in there now i'm going to
[2755.84 - 2761.84] grate some ginger that's going to go in
[2757.52 - 2761.84] here too
[2769.52 - 2773.68] and the whole biohacking thing is really
[2771.52 - 2776.64] kind of
[2773.68 - 2778.16] interesting when you think about it it's
[2776.64 - 2781.12] really a guessing game
[2778.16 - 2782.48] and i noticed all biohackers these days
[2781.12 - 2784.08] just want to make sure that whatever
[2782.48 - 2786.32] they're offering for advice most of it
[2784.08 - 2789.60] means killing your adrenals
[2786.32 - 2794.16] that's what it means you know maybe
[2789.60 - 2796.00] maybe it doesn't matter right who cares
[2794.16 - 2797.68] i mean should we really care just let
[2796.00 - 2800.00] people do what they want to do
[2797.68 - 2803.76] let them do what makes them happy let
[2800.00 - 2805.20] them um let them get the hair thinning
[2803.76 - 2807.44] you know all the women getting the hair
[2805.20 - 2809.44] thinning let the age spots happen let
[2807.44 - 2810.24] the wrinkled skin happen real fast the
[2809.44 - 2813.52] wrinkles
[2810.24 - 2813.52] when they shouldn't be happening
[2813.60 - 2820.16] menopause symptoms coming on faster
[2817.04 - 2821.84] right losing precious hormones critical
[2820.16 - 2823.04] hormones for the whole body
[2821.84 - 2825.12] so that you're not in the doctor's
[2823.04 - 2827.60] office every single day
[2825.12 - 2828.88] you know all worried about the hormones
[2827.60 - 2832.48] right
[2828.88 - 2834.40] so i don't know i mean shouldn't we care
[2832.48 - 2836.00] or what about if you get you have an
[2834.40 - 2837.52] experience someday you pick up some bugs
[2836.00 - 2841.20] you pick up some epstein bar
[2837.52 - 2842.80] i got some some grated ginger in here
[2841.20 - 2845.84] what if you pick up a new epstein bar
[2842.80 - 2845.84] and you get really sick
[2846.16 - 2851.20] and your adrenals can't handle it
[2849.44 - 2854.40] so i'm going to do some garlic too i'm
[2851.20 - 2854.40] going to mince up some garlic
[2855.04 - 2860.64] you want your adrenal strong you guys
[2858.24 - 2863.84] you want your adrenals strong for what
[2860.64 - 2866.72] gets thrown at you in your lifetime
[2863.84 - 2868.80] and so adrenal robbers which are
[2866.72 - 2870.56] basically vampires in the health field
[2868.80 - 2872.64] now there's tons of them out there tons
[2870.56 - 2875.68] of vampires in the health field now
[2872.64 - 2878.00] they'll teach you how to rob
[2875.68 - 2879.52] and kill your adrenals right they'll
[2878.00 - 2880.88] teach you that matcha tea is good for
[2879.52 - 2883.20] you all that caffeine they'll teach you
[2880.88 - 2885.68] cacao is all good for you so you
[2883.20 - 2887.44] just ruin your adrenals so they're the
[2885.68 - 2890.00] real thieves right
[2887.44 - 2892.56] but i'm going to put some garlic in here
[2890.00 - 2892.56] too you guys
[2896.48 - 2903.04] then they'll go on podcasts
[2900.08 - 2903.76] talk about all the scientific studies
[2903.04 - 2906.56] well you know
[2903.76 - 2908.40] last when i checked no one ever got
[2906.56 - 2910.48] better from a scientific study ever in
[2908.40 - 2912.64] chronic illness
[2910.48 - 2914.88] so i guess you could wait for another 20
[2912.64 - 2917.84] years for scientific studies to come out
[2914.88 - 2919.28] to get you better but we've already
[2917.84 - 2920.88] waited 50 70 years
[2919.28 - 2923.20] for scientific studies to get everybody
[2920.88 - 2926.00] better at chronic illness but
[2923.20 - 2927.28] but last i checked there's no study that
[2926.00 - 2930.32] fixes anybody
[2927.28 - 2932.16] um can you show me a study somewhere
[2930.32 - 2934.24] that gets somebody out of a wheelchair
[2932.16 - 2935.92] with ms
[2934.24 - 2937.52] okay so let's do i put the garlic in
[2935.92 - 2939.92] here that's great
[2937.52 - 2943.20] that's in here maple syrup's next so i
[2939.92 - 2945.28] got two tablespoons of maple syrup
[2943.20 - 2947.28] that's in the sauce and we go with one
[2945.28 - 2948.96] tablespoon of arrowroot
[2947.28 - 2950.72] powder which i have right here just so
[2948.96 - 2957.28] you know so one tablespoon
[2950.72 - 2959.76] of arrowroot powder in the sauce
[2957.28 - 2959.76] got that
[2960.48 - 2964.32] i didn't know a scientific study can
[2965.28 - 2969.60] stop somebody from having the worst
[2967.36 - 2971.04] preeclampsia
[2969.60 - 2973.84] i didn't know a scientific study can
[2971.04 - 2976.32] stop somebody from having pcos
[2973.84 - 2976.32] didn't know
[2977.92 - 2981.44] really didn't know and i didn't know a
[2979.52 - 2983.20] scientific study can
[2981.44 - 2985.36] stop somebody's encephalitis brain
[2983.20 - 2988.48] inflammation from mecfs
[2985.36 - 2990.16] or stop their vertigo or stop their jaw
[2988.48 - 2992.00] pain
[2990.16 - 2993.60] and their trigeminal neuralgia there's
[2992.00 - 2995.68] not one scientific study that's ever
[2993.60 - 2998.24] stopped anybody's trigeminal neuralgia
[2995.68 - 2999.68] so you guys this is the sauce i just
[2998.24 - 3001.28] made right here a little tomato paste
[2999.68 - 3002.80] some maple syrup some arrowroot some
[3001.28 - 3006.08] garlic some ginger
[3002.80 - 3006.72] okay cup of pineapple juice and i'm
[3006.08 - 3010.32] turning it
[3006.72 - 3014.40] into here or pouring it into here okay
[3010.32 - 3014.40] and i got the heat up here
[3017.12 - 3020.24] this is stir fry got the asparagus in
[3019.52 - 3022.56] here
[3020.24 - 3025.60] got the carrots got the red bell pepper
[3022.56 - 3027.76] got the orange bell pepper
[3025.60 - 3029.52] i mean have you guys have you guys found
[3027.76 - 3032.80] a scientific study to
[3029.52 - 3035.04] fix your depression or have you found
[3032.80 - 3038.56] one to fix your anxiety
[3035.04 - 3040.40] just wondering crippling anxiety
[3038.56 - 3043.76] i haven't seen a scientific study that
[3040.40 - 3043.76] fixes anybody's tinnitus
[3047.12 - 3051.52] it's a whole other thing so i got the
[3050.24 - 3052.64] stir fry here i'm just going to wait
[3051.52 - 3055.28] i'm going to crank up the heat a little
[3052.64 - 3058.00] bit more get it cooking
[3055.28 - 3059.76] but all those adrenal highs all those
[3058.00 - 3062.32] adrenal highs everybody's doing
[3059.76 - 3062.80] it's incredible almost every single
[3062.32 - 3064.56] person
[3062.80 - 3066.48] almost every single person is on
[3064.56 - 3069.04] caffeine every single day
[3066.48 - 3070.32] every single day and adrenal high
[3069.04 - 3072.40] adrenal high
[3070.32 - 3073.84] everybody's intermittent fasting not
[3072.40 - 3075.68] everybody but a lot of people
[3073.84 - 3077.84] almost everybody right in the health
[3075.68 - 3079.36] scene and they're killing their adrenals
[3077.84 - 3081.20] that way adrenal high adrenal high
[3079.36 - 3083.12] because when you go without glucose
[3081.20 - 3085.12] your adrenals replace the glucose and
[3083.12 - 3086.72] flood flood flood flood and it makes you
[3085.12 - 3088.56] do more chocolate more caffeine more
[3086.72 - 3090.16] coffee drinks more matcha tea more green
[3088.56 - 3091.28] tea whatever more energy drinks
[3090.16 - 3093.76] and you're just doing the intermittent
[3091.28 - 3095.60] fasting like that so there's more people
[3093.76 - 3097.12] doing that more people doing
[3095.60 - 3098.72] the hot saunas but i'm talking about the
[3097.12 - 3101.60] hot saunas right long
[3098.72 - 3103.68] long time in there 40 minutes more heat
[3101.60 - 3104.24] cranked up until you go into that crisis
[3103.68 - 3106.00] and then your
[3104.24 - 3107.76] adrenals flood like crazy and you come
[3106.00 - 3108.24] out like oh my god i feel so good i'm
[3107.76 - 3112.80] high
[3108.24 - 3112.80] and you're totally high on adrenaline
[3115.76 - 3118.96] and then you know you do the apple cider
[3117.20 - 3121.04] vinegar and you kill your stomach glands
[3118.96 - 3124.88] with the apple cider vinegar
[3121.04 - 3127.92] you kill your stomach glands and
[3124.88 - 3129.20] once you kill your stomach glands you're
[3127.92 - 3131.60] going to need adrenaline too
[3129.20 - 3132.96] to help digest your food so then people
[3131.60 - 3133.60] do this thing where they don't get it
[3132.96 - 3134.96] but
[3133.60 - 3137.20] once your stomach lands start getting
[3134.96 - 3139.04] eaten up start getting eaten up and
[3137.20 - 3141.12] weakened from apple cider vinegar eaten
[3139.04 - 3142.80] up and weakened from caffeine once those
[3141.12 - 3145.28] once a stomach lands the things that
[3142.80 - 3147.20] make your gastric juices and your hcl
[3145.28 - 3148.72] once they start weakening then you're
[3147.20 - 3150.72] going to need more adrenaline to
[3148.72 - 3152.08] try to digest food and try to get
[3150.72 - 3155.52] peristaltic action
[3152.08 - 3155.52] you're gonna need more adrenaline
[3156.72 - 3163.12] so basically i guess the talk today
[3160.24 - 3164.56] is information today the trendy stuff
[3163.12 - 3166.40] that's happening in the health experts
[3164.56 - 3169.36] in the biohackers today
[3166.40 - 3171.36] are really promoting how to kill and
[3169.36 - 3173.12] destroy your adrenals
[3171.36 - 3174.72] which inevitably will shorten your life
[3173.12 - 3176.16] make your life more miserable later on
[3174.72 - 3177.28] and you'll never be able to connect the
[3176.16 - 3179.44] dots
[3177.28 - 3181.12] why is my hair falling out i'm a woman
[3179.44 - 3182.08] it's not supposed to fall out why is it
[3181.12 - 3184.40] happening
[3182.08 - 3185.44] wait my hormones what my hormones are
[3184.40 - 3188.08] all messed up
[3185.44 - 3190.24] um let me go to another doctor it's
[3188.08 - 3192.88] because you're adrenals
[3190.24 - 3193.60] um huh i can't digest my food good
[3192.88 - 3196.88] anymore
[3193.60 - 3198.32] how come your adrenals stomach lands
[3196.88 - 3199.52] and then you start getting sick with all
[3198.32 - 3200.88] kinds of different conditions because
[3199.52 - 3202.48] everybody's getting sick
[3200.88 - 3204.08] everybody's getting sick so i'm making a
[3202.48 - 3205.76] stir fry right here
[3204.08 - 3208.00] everybody's getting sick everybody's
[3205.76 - 3209.68] getting a symptom no one's escaping
[3208.00 - 3211.60] that unless you know what to do and how
[3209.68 - 3211.92] to heal but the health experts today and
[3211.60 - 3214.88] the
[3211.92 - 3215.92] biohackers they're just out to basically
[3214.88 - 3220.00] rob and steal
[3215.92 - 3222.08] theft and basically rape and pillage
[3220.00 - 3224.64] your adrenal glands
[3222.08 - 3228.40] all for what so they can still they can
[3224.64 - 3228.40] do their caffeine and feel good about it
[3229.04 - 3233.04] and i know look i'm all for yoga big
[3231.20 - 3234.64] time i think it's i love it i think it's
[3233.04 - 3238.80] great
[3234.64 - 3242.16] but hot yoga just be cautious
[3238.80 - 3244.48] you know just be cautious because
[3242.16 - 3246.40] it's it's an adrenal surge you lose a
[3244.48 - 3249.12] lot of adrenaline you weaken the adrenal
[3246.40 - 3252.96] glands from doing it
[3249.12 - 3256.16] but what do i know the hell do i know
[3252.96 - 3256.96] right i mean millions of people getting
[3256.16 - 3259.28] better
[3256.96 - 3261.04] all around the world 35 years experience
[3259.28 - 3264.32] teaching doctors
[3261.04 - 3266.72] that information it heals
[3264.32 - 3268.40] advanced information that's now that i
[3266.72 - 3270.24] published first that science research is
[3268.40 - 3273.60] stealing
[3270.24 - 3274.48] um what do i know st mason says but i
[3273.60 - 3277.36] would love it if
[3274.48 - 3278.88] anthony could clarify on cold showers
[3277.36 - 3281.92] cold showers are fine
[3278.88 - 3285.36] it's just cold showers are fine i just
[3281.92 - 3287.92] wouldn't um if you're okay
[3285.36 - 3289.04] if you're struggling with a condition
[3287.92 - 3291.20] you're not well
[3289.04 - 3292.32] you got some fatigue cold showers aren't
[3291.20 - 3294.16] great meaning
[3292.32 - 3297.12] freezing cold showers where you shock
[3294.16 - 3300.32] your body staying in there too long
[3297.12 - 3303.44] like bringing your body temperature down
[3300.32 - 3306.32] not a great thing okay
[3303.44 - 3308.48] you don't want like ice cold do a cool
[3306.32 - 3309.68] shower where you feel a little bit of
[3308.48 - 3312.80] that shock right
[3309.68 - 3313.28] just don't go ice cold don't be jumping
[3312.80 - 3316.24] into
[3313.28 - 3318.00] you know like the ice and and staying in
[3316.24 - 3319.04] there too long because you're gonna be
[3318.00 - 3320.56] on adrenaline
[3319.04 - 3322.32] straight adrenaline when you're in the
[3320.56 - 3322.72] shower right and you just flip it to
[3322.32 - 3323.84] cold
[3322.72 - 3326.32] and you're in the shower and you flip it
[3323.84 - 3328.32] right to cold okay
[3326.32 - 3330.64] and that hits you and you go like this
[3328.32 - 3330.64] you're like
[3332.00 - 3335.36] is the waters hitting you your adrenals
[3334.32 - 3336.64] are flooding
[3335.36 - 3338.64] that's what's happening they're going
[3336.64 - 3340.56] crazy and you're getting adrenaline
[3338.64 - 3342.32] surges adrenaline high
[3340.56 - 3343.60] you don't want to do too much of it you
[3342.32 - 3345.12] don't want to get let it get out of
[3343.60 - 3347.20] control and if you got some health
[3345.12 - 3350.08] issues of any kind
[3347.20 - 3350.08] probably wouldn't do it at all
[3350.48 - 3354.40] what's wrong with hot yoga i'll tell you
[3352.64 - 3357.20] what's wrong what happens is when you're
[3354.40 - 3358.64] pushing yourself in that kind of heat a
[3357.20 - 3362.00] lot of studios keep it
[3358.64 - 3364.56] really really hot on hot weather days
[3362.00 - 3366.48] on top of it so outside of the studio
[3364.56 - 3367.84] could be like a 90 degree day where
[3366.48 - 3369.12] depending on where you are during the
[3367.84 - 3371.60] summer or whatever it is
[3369.12 - 3373.44] so it's already your body's already
[3371.60 - 3374.96] elevating at a much higher temperature
[3373.44 - 3375.68] your body's trying to cool itself
[3374.96 - 3377.44] already
[3375.68 - 3380.32] then you're going to do hot you go into
[3377.44 - 3381.92] a hot yoga studio they got it cranked up
[3380.32 - 3383.52] and you're sitting there for an hour
[3381.92 - 3385.36] session sometimes hour and a half
[3383.52 - 3386.56] session i've seen hot yoga sessions two
[3385.36 - 3388.64] hours i've seen them
[3386.56 - 3390.20] even less or whatever but what you're
[3388.64 - 3393.12] doing is you're going into
[3390.20 - 3395.20] hyperthermia so now you're go but but
[3393.12 - 3397.12] your will your free will is making you
[3395.20 - 3398.72] do it like i gotta do this i gotta push
[3397.12 - 3399.60] through with everybody else to this hot
[3398.72 - 3401.92] yoga
[3399.60 - 3403.68] you can't stop me i gotta do it i gotta
[3401.92 - 3405.28] show everybody i can do it too
[3403.68 - 3406.96] so everybody's in there and everybody's
[3405.28 - 3408.16] like and they're breathing and they're
[3406.96 - 3410.08] doing their hot yoga
[3408.16 - 3411.20] meanwhile your brain is saying you're
[3410.08 - 3413.68] cooking me baby
[3411.20 - 3415.20] you're cooking me so hey i need
[3413.68 - 3417.12] adrenaline so now your
[3415.20 - 3419.12] your adrenals are surging and purging
[3417.12 - 3419.76] and purging by the end of that whole
[3419.12 - 3422.00] session
[3419.76 - 3423.60] you're high on adrenaline because your
[3422.00 - 3424.72] brain almost cooked because you had to
[3423.60 - 3427.92] use adrenaline
[3424.72 - 3428.56] it's hard on the system then you end up
[3427.92 - 3430.88] getting that
[3428.56 - 3432.40] that adrenal fatigue hormone imbalance
[3430.88 - 3433.84] imbalances later
[3432.40 - 3435.68] you get if you're if you're young and
[3433.84 - 3437.20] you're trying to have a baby
[3435.68 - 3438.24] you're you're there's a good chance
[3437.20 - 3439.76] you're going to have a difficult
[3438.24 - 3441.92] childbirth
[3439.76 - 3443.36] because you need all the adrenaline you
[3441.92 - 3446.64] can to have a smooth
[3443.36 - 3449.28] childbirth weak adrenals means difficult
[3446.64 - 3449.28] child births

[3471.52 - 3474.16] issues and you're usually tired on and
[3473.52 - 3476.72] off
[3474.16 - 3477.84] so you just you know you're you're
[3476.72 - 3479.84] working on healing
[3477.84 - 3482.08] that's an incredible sarah an incredible
[3479.84 - 3484.08] start and i'm proud of you
[3482.08 - 3485.44] 28 day cleanse you could do longer term
[3484.08 - 3486.32] you can do it longer you can ask your
[3485.44 - 3488.08] doctor too
[3486.32 - 3489.68] how long your doctor wants you to be on
[3488.08 - 3491.36] it if you feel for your health
[3489.68 - 3493.44] healthcare practitioner and so forth but
[3491.36 - 3494.80] the 28 day a lot of medical doctors know
[3493.44 - 3496.56] about medical medium information
[3494.80 - 3498.00] thousands of them across the country use
[3496.56 - 3499.36] medical medium information the books and
[3498.00 - 3503.04] everything in their practices
[3499.36 - 3503.52] but but the 20-day cleanse is one aspect
[3503.04 - 3505.76] but
[3503.52 - 3508.24] looking at where your condition is like
[3505.76 - 3509.84] say it's adrenal fatigue so
[3508.24 - 3512.40] if you were diagnosed with adrenal
[3509.84 - 3513.28] fatigue or do you have neurological
[3512.40 - 3515.52] fatigue
[3513.28 - 3517.60] too which is your nervous system being
[3515.52 - 3519.76] affected by a little bit of epstein-barr
[3517.60 - 3521.20] because adrenal fatigue is one thing but
[3519.76 - 3523.84] you can have also
[3521.20 - 3524.72] chronic fatigue which is neurological
[3523.84 - 3526.80] fatigue
[3524.72 - 3528.80] which means your fatigue for other
[3526.80 - 3530.72] reasons besides your adrenals even
[3528.80 - 3533.68] though the adrenals could be part of it
[3530.72 - 3534.32] that's when it's important to have like
[3533.68 - 3536.32] you know
[3534.32 - 3538.64] like in here there's an adrenal section
[3536.32 - 3539.92] in here shows supplements and protocols
[3538.64 - 3541.36] and dosages
[3539.92 - 3542.72] i mean you can talk to your practitioner
[3541.36 - 3544.80] and show your practitioner's book in the
[3542.72 - 3548.56] section in there and you can see there's
[3544.80 - 3551.76] more you can do so not only can you do
[3548.56 - 3553.52] the 28-day cleanse right not only can
[3551.76 - 3555.76] you do the 28-day cleanse
[3553.52 - 3557.60] but you can do supplements too and in
[3555.76 - 3559.44] here i have them all listed in here too
[3557.60 - 3561.44] supplements for the for the adrenals and
[3559.44 - 3562.48] here and you can take a little bit at a
[3561.44 - 3564.96] time and start
[3562.48 - 3566.88] reinforcing your adrenals that way if
[3564.96 - 3570.40] your fatigue persists
[3566.88 - 3572.80] you might have some neurological fatigue
[3570.40 - 3574.40] which is some chronic fatigue syndrome
[3572.80 - 3576.16] from epstein barr
[3574.40 - 3578.08] that's happening then you want to go
[3576.16 - 3579.36] anti-viral which these books provide all
[3578.08 - 3580.88] that information you can take them to
[3579.36 - 3583.28] your doctor so forth and talk to them
[3580.88 - 3583.28] about it
[3583.60 - 3588.16] see you guys got the stir-fry here but
[3587.36 - 3591.76] we're talking
[3588.16 - 3600.16] about a lot of stuff so i'm going to
[3591.76 - 3605.04] actually put this on a plate
[3600.16 - 3605.04] so just letting you know here that
[3606.96 - 3614.96] i'm gonna put i'm gonna plate this right

[3633.76 - 3637.60] this is in the medical medium book okay
[3636.40 - 3639.28] the link is in
[3637.60 - 3641.28] the description right there it's a
[3639.28 - 3642.56] healing recipe it's got some red bell
[3641.28 - 3644.08] peppers in there it's got the carrots
[3642.56 - 3644.96] it's got the sweet and sour sauce in
[3644.08 - 3647.20] there too it's
[3644.96 - 3650.00] garlic ginger asparagus it's got some
[3647.20 - 3650.00] brussels sprouts
[3650.24 - 3657.84] that's the dish it's right here
[3658.96 - 3664.96] so there it is i think mine
[3662.64 - 3666.24] here versus mine that was made here when
[3664.96 - 3668.88] i made this i think i chopped it a
[3666.24 - 3668.88] little differently
[3669.12 - 3676.00] but that's the recipe right there
[3672.88 - 3677.92] listen you guys your body wants to know
[3676.00 - 3680.24] you're in it with them your body wants
[3677.92 - 3682.96] to know you're on the same page
[3680.24 - 3684.24] your body is always up against what we
[3682.96 - 3686.56] think
[3684.24 - 3687.68] we should do or what we get told what we
[3686.56 - 3691.04] should do out there
[3687.68 - 3694.00] if we're told caffeine's okay our bodies
[3691.04 - 3694.88] like its pants it's like wait a
[3694.00 - 3696.16] minute
[3694.88 - 3698.00] wait a minute you're going to dump all
[3696.16 - 3699.28] that caffeine in me you're going to do
[3698.00 - 3701.20] that to me what do you mean the
[3699.28 - 3702.56] communication breakdown between your
[3701.20 - 3705.12] actual body
[3702.56 - 3706.00] and your free will and your will to do
[3705.12 - 3707.68] things
[3706.00 - 3709.20] you see what i'm talking about that's
[3707.68 - 3711.76] where the problem is so
[3709.20 - 3713.28] it's like that's why i kind of like it
[3711.76 - 3714.72] pains me to see a little bit out there
[3713.28 - 3716.24] when people are like so spiritually
[3714.72 - 3718.08] connected and they're so they got their
[3716.24 - 3719.76] health down so good and their intuition
[3718.08 - 3722.00] so great but their bodies like
[3719.76 - 3723.04] freaking out saying why are you killing
[3722.00 - 3724.88] me man
[3723.04 - 3726.32] why are you killing my adrenals who told
[3724.88 - 3727.44] you to eat a chocolate bar every single
[3726.32 - 3729.60] day
[3727.44 - 3730.72] 90 child who told you to eat cacao nibs
[3729.60 - 3732.64] every single day like that
[3730.72 - 3734.64] good or something with all that caffeine
[3732.64 - 3737.20] your adrenals are just getting toasted
[3734.64 - 3738.72] it's like who told you to go into a
[3737.20 - 3740.56] sauna for too long
[3738.72 - 3742.40] with such a high heat like who told you
[3740.56 - 3744.16] to jump into ice and
[3742.40 - 3745.76] and freeze yourself to hyperthermia
[3744.16 - 3746.96] level to your adrenals freak out who
[3745.76 - 3749.36] told you to go into a
[3746.96 - 3750.00] yoga studio with the heat being at 105
[3749.36 - 3751.92] degrees
[3750.00 - 3753.92] on a 100 degree day outside during the
[3751.92 - 3756.00] summer time with your body going into
[3753.92 - 3757.52] total hyperthermia like who told you so
[3756.00 - 3758.80] your adrenals have to clean up all the
[3757.52 - 3762.08] mess your body
[3758.80 - 3764.40] your body is just like freaking out and
[3762.08 - 3766.16] it needs those adrenal reserves for the
[3764.40 - 3768.32] long haul who told you to intermittent
[3766.16 - 3769.76] fast what it was some brainiac idea from
[3768.32 - 3771.68] somebody to make sure you're jacked up
[3769.76 - 3773.36] on caffeine all day and no food
[3771.68 - 3774.80] and then you eat a high fat meal at the
[3773.36 - 3776.24] end of the day which also kills your
[3774.80 - 3779.04] adrenals
[3776.24 - 3780.40] it's never ending throw in a whole bunch
[3779.04 - 3781.84] of other stuff too
[3780.40 - 3783.20] and then while you're intermittent fast
[3781.84 - 3785.52] and then have chocolate at the end of
[3783.20 - 3787.44] the night like two on top of it
[3785.52 - 3789.36] so maybe even chocolate ice cream you
[3787.44 - 3790.88] intermittent fast all day long and then
[3789.36 - 3792.08] boom you have your big fatty meal at the
[3790.88 - 3793.52] end of the day and then you have some
[3792.08 - 3794.72] chocolate or something else or maybe
[3793.52 - 3796.80] some weed
[3794.72 - 3798.40] so now you know some weed at the end of
[3796.80 - 3800.64] the day smoking weed
[3798.40 - 3801.60] i'm not judging anybody people do all
[3800.64 - 3805.04] kinds of stuff
[3801.60 - 3806.24] i'm just saying our body what it wants
[3805.04 - 3808.24] to do
[3806.24 - 3810.24] could be a lot different than what we
[3808.24 - 3813.36] want to do you know
[3810.24 - 3814.16] like our body might be thinking a lot
[3813.36 - 3817.20] different than
[3814.16 - 3819.92] what we're thinking right heather says
[3817.20 - 3821.52] that's a crazy diet
[3819.92 - 3823.60] our body's thinking differently you see
[3821.52 - 3826.64] what i mean so
[3823.60 - 3828.24] think about that so i mean
[3826.64 - 3830.64] and that's the other thing but there's
[3828.24 - 3831.28] all these biohackers every day out there
[3830.64 - 3834.00] now
[3831.28 - 3835.20] health enthusiasts and influencers and
[3834.00 - 3837.20] health experts and
[3835.20 - 3839.60] whatever you want to call everybody now
[3837.20 - 3841.36] and they got big ideas and it's the same
[3839.60 - 3842.48] old crap everybody else is selling and
[3841.36 - 3844.00] it's the same old
[3842.48 - 3845.84] that everybody else is selling and it's
[3844.00 - 3847.12] the same old stuff it's called kill your

[3901.92 - 3905.28] first child births or third ones where
[3903.44 - 3906.32] it's epic disaster because their
[3905.28 - 3909.04] adrenals are saying
[3906.32 - 3911.04] dear god i just did 10 years of caffeine
[3909.04 - 3912.64] and 10 years of all this other stuff
[3911.04 - 3914.64] and no one protected me and told me
[3912.64 - 3916.32] about it and now i'm just crapping out
[3914.64 - 3918.00] while i'm trying to have a baby
[3916.32 - 3919.60] and that's what the adrenals that's what
[3918.00 - 3921.28] they do and that's why some women will
[3919.60 - 3923.84] be in labor for two days because their
[3921.28 - 3925.68] adrenals can't cut the mustard
[3923.84 - 3927.04] because they've been doing caffeine for
[3925.68 - 3929.92] the last five years
[3927.04 - 3931.44] six seven years and every and these
[3929.92 - 3932.96] podcast doctors are sitting on the
[3931.44 - 3934.56] podcast they'll be like much
[3932.96 - 3937.04] tea is good for you yeah i drink it
[3934.56 - 3938.64] every day oh it's got antioxidants every
[3937.04 - 3940.40] woman should be drinking their caffeine
[3938.64 - 3944.00] every single day
[3940.40 - 3947.76] and that's how it works but like i said
[3944.00 - 3947.76] what do i know right
[3949.12 - 3953.20] you know what do i know it's a you know
[3952.88 - 3957.52] it's
[3953.20 - 3960.56] it's funny because it's like
[3957.52 - 3962.24] the key is let's just be all straight
[3960.56 - 3966.08] out and honest about it
[3962.24 - 3968.88] let's just be open about stuff
[3966.08 - 3969.92] and let's see the reality of it see
[3968.88 - 3971.36] let's
[3969.92 - 3972.40] i'm tired of hearing people say they're
[3971.36 - 3974.08] going to speak their truth or they're
[3972.40 - 3976.80] speaking their truth or
[3974.08 - 3978.48] truth truth or whatever it is and it's
[3976.80 - 3980.48] not really truth
[3978.48 - 3982.64] i just like to do real truth that's what
[3980.48 - 3984.08] i like to do like real truth
[3982.64 - 3985.68] and there's a difference between real
[3984.08 - 3987.84] truth and bs
[3985.68 - 3988.88] truth or fake truth there's a big
[3987.84 - 3990.80] difference
[3988.88 - 3992.00] and yeah i'm the only one going against
[3990.80 - 3994.64] the caffeine industry
[3992.00 - 3995.04] right now pretty much yeah i'm the only
[3994.64 - 3996.72] one
[3995.04 - 3999.28] telling it like it is about all this
[3996.72 - 4001.60] other stuff but
[3999.28 - 4002.48] isn't it about like making sure that

[4008.24 - 4012.56] given the knowledge
[4009.76 - 4014.56] isn't it about making sure that your
[4012.56 - 4016.00] life is precious and everything in your
[4014.56 - 4019.28] life and everything you do
[4016.00 - 4020.40] matters i don't want that robbed or

[4026.32 - 4032.24] want that it's like
[4029.12 - 4036.40] and be cautious
[4032.24 - 4036.40] be cautious look out
[4036.64 - 4040.80] renata says what's hard to convince
[4038.64 - 4042.56] people to listen to this info
[4040.80 - 4044.00] what's hard is to convince people to
[4042.56 - 4045.76] listen to this info
[4044.00 - 4048.24] it's heartbreaking how stubborn some
[4045.76 - 4050.48] people can be i was told today
[4048.24 - 4052.32] just chill out nutritional yeast
[4050.48 - 4054.72] tomatoes
[4052.32 - 4055.68] so just chill about nutritional yeast
[4054.72 - 4059.20] tomatoes
[4055.68 - 4060.88] have msg too nutritional yeast
[4059.20 - 4062.88] it can make or break somebody's healing
[4060.88 - 4063.44] process i just want you guys to know
[4062.88 - 4066.64] that
[4063.44 - 4069.20] it can um it's highly toxic
[4066.64 - 4071.36] and what nutritional yeast does it
[4069.20 - 4073.36] interferes with the brain chemistry
[4071.36 - 4075.04] it interferes with electricity in the
[4073.36 - 4076.64] brain neurotransmitters in the brain
[4075.04 - 4077.52] it's one thing what nutritional yeast
[4076.64 - 4080.56] does
[4077.52 - 4083.12] another thing nutritional yeast does is
[4080.56 - 4084.48] it weakens the immune system it doesn't
[4083.12 - 4087.60] build the immune system
[4084.48 - 4088.64] so if you got fibrocfs eczema psoriasis
[4087.60 - 4091.36] depression anxiety
[4088.64 - 4092.80] whatever you got going on utis bladder
[4091.36 - 4095.84] infections kidney infections
[4092.80 - 4097.36] whatever you got acne yeah acne
[4095.84 - 4098.88] your immune system lowers down and you
[4097.36 - 4100.72] get acne every time your immune system
[4098.88 - 4102.48] lowers you get acne
[4100.72 - 4104.32] tomatoes don't have msg by the way but
[4102.48 - 4106.00] anyway all
[4104.32 - 4108.00] what happens is that nutritional yeast
[4106.00 - 4110.40] can make or break your finish line
[4108.00 - 4111.28] your healing to the end your finish line
[4110.40 - 4112.64] maybe
[4111.28 - 4114.16] you don't have any issues you're eating
[4112.64 - 4115.44] it all day long because you got nothing
[4114.16 - 4117.92] yet
[4115.44 - 4119.20] everybody is going to get sick who isn't
[4117.92 - 4121.36] sick now
[4119.20 - 4122.72] that's where we're heading everybody
[4121.36 - 4124.96] gets something
[4122.72 - 4126.08] everybody gets something and some get
[4124.96 - 4129.20] many get much
[4126.08 - 4131.12] more than just something um
[4129.20 - 4132.48] people who aren't sick will spout out
[4131.12 - 4134.08] where's your study
[4132.48 - 4135.68] they don't want to know like your track
[4134.08 - 4136.96] record of how many people healed in the
[4135.68 - 4139.84] world doing your info
[4136.96 - 4141.68] or they don't want to know what celery
[4139.84 - 4142.72] juice does for people and why it's the
[4141.68 - 4145.36] biggest
[4142.72 - 4146.08] the biggest out there as far as how many
[4145.36 - 4149.28] people are doing
[4146.08 - 4150.72] it there's no trend or anything else
[4149.28 - 4152.80] that overrides it but you know why you
[4150.72 - 4154.32] don't hear about it every minute celery
[4152.80 - 4155.76] juice even though everybody's doing it
[4154.32 - 4156.96] 500 million people in the world are
[4155.76 - 4158.40] doing it right now the reason why i
[4156.96 - 4160.80] don't hear about it
[4158.40 - 4162.40] because it makes no one money it makes
[4160.80 - 4164.64] nobody money
[4162.40 - 4166.40] and all the other crap makes people
[4164.64 - 4168.72] money collagen
[4166.40 - 4170.48] coffee caffeine whatever it is makes
[4168.72 - 4172.56] people tons of money right
[4170.48 - 4174.24] so because it makes them all money you
[4172.56 - 4177.60] hear about it every minute
[4174.24 - 4180.24] every single minute um
[4177.60 - 4182.40] so yeah so people who aren't sick
[4180.24 - 4184.16] they'll they'll be spouting out like
[4182.40 - 4185.76] they haven't figured out that science
[4184.16 - 4188.40] doesn't have the answers yet
[4185.76 - 4190.16] if you're sick did a scientific study
[4188.40 - 4192.16] fix your fibromyalgia i'm just curious
[4190.16 - 4194.40] did it fix your trigeminal neuralgia
[4192.16 - 4195.92] did it fix your ra did a scientific
[4194.40 - 4199.04] study fix anything
[4195.92 - 4200.72] did it fix something that you got
[4199.04 - 4202.72] kind of curious right are you still sick
[4200.72 - 4203.12] do you still get bouts of it are you
[4202.72 - 4205.36] still
[4203.12 - 4206.56] dealing with something because there's
[4205.36 - 4208.48] no science study
[4206.56 - 4210.24] that has ever fixed somebody's eczema or
[4208.48 - 4213.44] psoriasis
[4210.24 - 4216.00] ever got it better ever
[4213.44 - 4217.20] think about that just think about that
[4216.00 - 4219.60] for two seconds
[4217.20 - 4221.36] like oh my god but you'll hear a bunch
[4219.60 - 4222.88] of people who aren't really that sick
[4221.36 - 4225.28] yet or maybe they're just
[4222.88 - 4227.04] a little mentally sick but they're not
[4225.28 - 4227.44] they got other problems meaning like
[4227.04 - 4229.28] they're
[4227.44 - 4231.12] struggling with some kind of hardship
[4229.28 - 4232.80] mentally and emotionally maybe there's
[4231.12 - 4234.32] somebody that
[4232.80 - 4236.16] you know maybe there's somebody that
[4234.32 - 4238.80] doesn't have physical symptoms
[4236.16 - 4240.00] really but they have a lot of emotional
[4238.80 - 4241.52] turmoil
[4240.00 - 4243.44] and they don't know what it's like to

[4298.40 - 4303.12] opinion on collagen yeah you can't eat
[4301.28 - 4304.72] collagen to fix collagen you can't eat
[4303.12 - 4306.40] collagen to create collagen you can't
[4304.72 - 4308.16] eat a sheep's eyeball to fix your
[4306.40 - 4310.16] eyeball you can't eat a human eyeball
[4308.16 - 4311.92] to fix your eyeball you can't eat kidney
[4310.16 - 4312.72] to fix your kidney can't eat liver to
[4311.92 - 4314.72] fix your liver
[4312.72 - 4316.16] you can't eat brain to fix your brain
[4314.72 - 4317.52] you can't eat a cow's brain to fix your
[4316.16 - 4320.48] brain you can't eat a human brain to
[4317.52 - 4322.08] fix your brain it doesn't work what's
[4320.48 - 4322.80] really disturbing about the collagen
[4322.08 - 4325.60] thing
[4322.80 - 4327.92] it's such a psych out for people it
[4325.60 - 4329.04] really insults people in a way that's
[4327.92 - 4332.72] unbelievable
[4329.04 - 4334.96] how dare you think you can eat something
[4332.72 - 4336.00] to actually fix something but eat that
[4334.96 - 4338.24] very thing
[4336.00 - 4339.28] it doesn't happen it doesn't exist it'll
[4338.24 - 4343.20] never happen
[4339.28 - 4346.00] you can't eat brain to heal your brain
[4343.20 - 4346.96] bottom line and that's something to
[4346.00 - 4348.88] remember
[4346.96 - 4350.88] you have to eat other foods to build
[4348.88 - 4353.52] your collagen you have to create
[4350.88 - 4355.68] collagen through using foods that create
[4353.52 - 4357.36] that actually help you build collagen
[4355.68 - 4358.16] the process in your body to create
[4357.36 - 4360.72] collagen
[4358.16 - 4362.72] comes from leafy greens it comes from
[4360.72 - 4364.64] fruits it comes from these foods here
[4362.72 - 4366.64] these healing foods asparagus it comes
[4364.64 - 4368.48] from these healing foods
[4366.64 - 4370.64] that's where it comes from it's so
[4368.48 - 4372.96] insulting to trick people out
[4370.64 - 4375.20] maybe the system thinks people are so
[4372.96 - 4378.24] dumb or something out there maybe
[4375.20 - 4380.08] the evil system that just you know banks
[4378.24 - 4381.76] trillions of dollars on stupid ideas
[4380.08 - 4385.84] thinks people are that gullible and that
[4381.76 - 4385.84] stupid i don't know how how it happens
