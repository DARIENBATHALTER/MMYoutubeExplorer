[176.22 - 180.48] because it's a 20-day cleanse right
[178.62 - 182.64] where we're doing it this is incredible

[190.32 - 195.12] start today start tomorrow either way
[193.02 - 198.24] we're doing it
[195.12 - 202.20] people have to realize there are bodily
[198.24 - 204.60] fluids left on toilet seats
[202.20 - 206.28] those people don't realize that I know
[204.60 - 209.04] people that don't even think that they
[206.28 - 211.02] don't think bodily fluids are on toilet
[209.04 - 213.12] seats
[211.02 - 216.00] those bodily fluids can contain
[213.12 - 218.22] varieties of streptococcus they always
[216.00 - 220.46] contain varieties of streptococcus
[218.22 - 224.04] really many strains of which are
[220.46 - 226.38] antibiotic resistant
[224.04 - 227.70] definitely E coli
[226.38 - 230.40] staff
[227.70 - 234.20] herpes simplex 1 Herpes Simplex 2 are
[230.40 - 236.52] always on toilet seats public restrooms
[234.20 - 239.36] Epstein-Barr yes Epstein-Barr can be on
[236.52 - 242.16] a toilet seat there are shingles hhv6
[239.36 - 247.32] cytomegalovirus CMV
[242.16 - 249.12] and HPV can be on a toilet seat that
[247.32 - 252.90] means that these bugs can be on toilet
[249.12 - 257.52] seats surfaces and usually are
[252.90 - 262.02] indeed they truly usually are so public
[257.52 - 264.30] restrooms that is what is on there
[262.02 - 267.00] they're covering toilet seats
[264.30 - 270.54] so this is critical flopping down
[267.00 - 274.22] straight onto a public toilet seat is
[270.54 - 274.22] not a wise practice
[274.56 - 278.94] if there's anything to take away if it's
[276.72 - 281.16] just one thing and that's all
[278.94 - 283.50] just one thing to take away from meta
[281.16 - 285.96] from volumes of medical medium
[283.50 - 288.18] information
[285.96 - 291.62] if you want to throw away everything and
[288.18 - 293.94] take one one thing with you let it be
[291.62 - 298.28] flopping down straight onto a public
[293.94 - 298.28] toilet seat is not a wise practice
[298.80 - 303.66] then there's then there's the toilet
[301.20 - 307.62] water in the bowl
[303.66 - 311.16] even if the toilet was flushed but
[307.62 - 313.38] toilets never truly flush
[311.16 - 315.36] pretty crazy isn't that there's always
[313.38 - 318.74] invisible leftover material floating
[315.36 - 318.74] around in the toilet water
[321.62 - 326.10] and as you go to the bathroom why do I
[324.36 - 329.52] think that's funny that's not a funny
[326.10 - 331.80] thing but why am I laughing here
[329.52 - 334.10] if you if you go
[331.80 - 337.74] and as you go to the bathroom
[334.10 - 341.22] splashes from the water can pop up back
[337.74 - 343.86] into you okay
[341.22 - 346.08] it's very easy to get infected in
[343.86 - 349.08] restrooms because when you're going to
[346.08 - 350.88] the bathroom you're exposed
[349.08 - 353.04] for example when someone is having a
[350.88 - 356.54] bowel movement their rectum doesn't
[353.04 - 356.54] immediately close
[356.76 - 361.98] these are really good books these brain
[359.28 - 365.22] saver books are mind-blowing
[361.98 - 366.36] as their fecal matter Torpedoes into the
[365.22 - 368.88] water
[366.36 - 371.64] it's very easy for that water to Splash
[368.88 - 374.52] up and enter into the rectum as the
[371.64 - 376.50] rectum is still closing you guys were
[374.52 - 379.44] day two of the medical medium brain shot
[376.50 - 381.18] therapy challenge okay and we're going
[379.44 - 383.70] to be doing 20 days if you just got on
[381.18 - 385.68] here reading out a brain saver all right
[383.70 - 387.36] so I'm excited about this is good
[385.68 - 388.86] information to be talking about we're
[387.36 - 390.66] just talking about pathogen exposure
[388.86 - 393.06] shock maybe you weren't on a public
[390.66 - 394.86] restroom recently but there's other
[393.06 - 397.56] reasons through the pathogen exposure
[394.86 - 400.52] shot it's really a powerful healing shot
[397.56 - 400.52] in so many ways
[401.64 - 407.58] before you poo
[404.88 - 409.38] it's best to place a sheet or two of
[407.58 - 412.86] toilet paper on the surface of the water
[409.38 - 415.38] to mitigate splash
[412.86 - 418.40] this might sound ridiculous for a second
[415.38 - 418.40] but it's not
[418.74 - 422.64] how many people don't realize how many
[420.54 - 425.84] bugs they contract sitting on a public
[422.64 - 425.84] restroom toilet
[426.24 - 431.10] dropping a poo in the toilet and then it
[428.64 - 433.62] sends water right up into the rectum
[431.10 - 435.48] before the rectum closes
[433.62 - 437.88] and now they have a brand new
[435.48 - 440.40] streptococcus one that's antibiotic
[437.88 - 443.70] resistant that some other person had in
[440.40 - 446.28] their body because they took 20
[443.70 - 449.28] billion antibiotics in the course of
[446.28 - 450.44] their lifetime the kind of mitigate and
[449.28 - 454.26] keep that
[450.44 - 457.80] streptococcus under control as it gave
[454.26 - 459.78] size and sore throats and UTIs and
[457.80 - 460.86] bladder infections and kidney infections
[459.78 - 463.92] and
[460.86 - 465.54] and acne and acne yeah because acne
[463.92 - 468.30] streptococcus that's what acne is it's
[465.54 - 471.36] not hormones it's streptococcus
[468.30 - 473.10] so it's best to place a sheet or two of
[471.36 - 476.30] toilet paper on the surface of the water
[473.10 - 476.30] to mitigate splash
[476.52 - 482.34] because it stops the splash
[480.48 - 484.62] to protect yourself further it's
[482.34 - 487.26] important to flush a public toilet
[484.62 - 489.78] before you even use it if you go into a
[487.26 - 492.68] public restroom flush the toilet before
[489.78 - 492.68] you use it
[495.36 - 500.16] if it's a urinal urinal
[498.06 - 502.50] you don't want to flush that one I'm
[500.16 - 504.74] talking about a toilet
[502.50 - 507.12] not one of those you know urinals right
[504.74 - 510.18] those when you hit that when you hit
[507.12 - 511.92] that that thing right splashes
[510.18 - 515.76] everybody's urine all you know other
[511.92 - 519.26] guys urine right on you right
[515.76 - 519.26] but I'm talking about the toilet
[521.34 - 526.44] it's important to flush a public toilet
[523.32 - 529.44] before you even use it if it has a lid
[526.44 - 531.30] put the lid down before flushing it so
[529.44 - 533.88] when you're in a public bathroom put the
[531.30 - 535.20] lid down before flushing it
[533.88 - 536.94] foreign
[535.20 - 538.92] did you guys expect we'd be talking
[536.94 - 540.24] about this today at all on day two of
[538.92 - 542.52] the medical beam breaks out there be
[540.24 - 546.32] quench challenge
[542.52 - 546.32] you flush with your foot I just saw
[547.74 - 552.90] other way otherwise try to turn away or
[550.62 - 556.62] back away while it's Flushing
[552.90 - 559.38] I'm on page 195 of the brain saver book
[556.62 - 562.86] the Mist can project outward with
[559.38 - 565.08] viruses or bacteria in it so you want to
[562.86 - 567.60] shut the lid of the toilet
[565.08 - 570.90] you never want to keep the lid of a
[567.60 - 574.16] toilet open on a plane
[570.90 - 574.16] before you flush it
[574.20 - 579.00] because when you're on a plane if you
[575.94 - 583.88] don't shut that lid it literally
[579.00 - 583.88] will shoot up right into your face
[584.34 - 588.90] if there's a lid laugh out loud then you
[586.62 - 590.48] got to turn around Jackie B gotta turn
[588.90 - 593.34] around away like I was just reading
[590.48 - 596.24] liziam says this is the manual we needed
[593.34 - 596.24] when we were born
[596.66 - 601.08] Erica Malik says so many don't have lids
[599.88 - 602.40] I know
[601.08 - 605.58] I know
[602.40 - 608.72] many people won't use enough toilet
[605.58 - 608.72] paper to wipe
[612.84 - 616.46] don't use like one sheet
[617.28 - 620.94] so they'll use one sheet fine I totally
[619.50 - 623.88] get it but
[620.94 - 625.86] one sheet right they use a few tiny
[623.88 - 627.78] sheets perhaps in the name of saving
[625.86 - 630.54] trees or if they're in the habit of
[627.78 - 632.76] using less to save money of course or
[630.54 - 635.40] they just miss the target
[632.76 - 636.72] they end up with a handful of feces so
[635.40 - 640.14] what happens when people go to bathroom
[636.72 - 643.62] they usually 95 of the people have a
[640.14 - 647.10] handful of the feces of course
[643.62 - 649.08] that hand will then flush the toilet
[647.10 - 650.46] so we're talking about the toilet handle
[649.08 - 652.44] now you guys if you're talking about
[650.46 - 654.18] there's another handle so someone just
[652.44 - 655.56] went to the bathroom they wiped their
[654.18 - 656.76] ass with a couple of sheets they got
[655.56 - 658.56] feces on their hand and now they're
[656.76 - 660.78] flushing the toilet right
[658.56 - 663.68] because not every place is automatic
[660.78 - 663.68] flush
[665.34 - 669.90] that hand will then flush a toilet
[667.26 - 672.48] toilet if it's not automated
[669.90 - 674.52] it's not automated
[672.48 - 677.40] then that hand will touch the soap
[674.52 - 678.84] dispenser and this it's Spencer and the
[677.40 - 681.72] sink handles
[678.84 - 683.76] leaving behind more feces particles and
[681.72 - 686.34] then after they wash their hands they'll
[683.76 - 688.44] touch the dirty handles again to shut
[686.34 - 690.72] off the sink
[688.44 - 693.18] so it's like you turn the sink on you
[690.72 - 694.26] have feces on your hand you're washing
[693.18 - 697.62] your hands
[694.26 - 699.30] the feces is on the handles and then
[697.62 - 700.98] you're done washing your hands and then
[699.30 - 702.48] you shut the handles off again you shut
[700.98 - 704.04] the handle off again and you got feces
[702.48 - 706.20] back on your hand tear Appleman says the
[704.04 - 707.40] toilets are flush while you're sitting
[706.20 - 711.80] on them
[707.40 - 711.80] yeah that's that's a tough one
[717.42 - 721.56] all right
[720.00 - 723.30] even if
[721.56 - 725.10] their own hands are clean they're
[723.30 - 726.90] touching handles that other people have
[725.10 - 728.46] touched those other people could have
[726.90 - 731.48] touched their eyes
[728.46 - 731.48] blown their nose
[731.52 - 735.72] or just touched their face while
[733.20 - 738.30] applying makeup in the bathroom mirror
[735.72 - 740.94] then as everyone exits the bathroom
[738.30 - 744.60] they're touching the spot on the door
[740.94 - 746.76] everyone else has put their hands on
[744.60 - 749.70] what I try to do in the public restroom
[746.76 - 753.12] is I look for any other spot to open the
[749.70 - 755.04] door if I can a spot that I don't think
[753.12 - 756.90] someone touched and I'll even ask Spirit
[755.04 - 758.76] of compassion nobody
[756.90 - 760.26] anybody touch the bottom of the handle
[758.76 - 761.70] and spirit confession to say a whole
[760.26 - 764.06] bunch of people use the bottom of the
[761.70 - 764.06] handle
[768.00 - 773.34] hand sanitizer does not stop all of
[770.94 - 775.02] these hand body exposures it's it's a
[773.34 - 777.48] noble idea
[775.02 - 779.94] partially helpful sometimes and yet hand
[777.48 - 782.34] sanitizer is random in its ability to
[779.94 - 783.78] kill pathogens it's not good enough we
[782.34 - 785.70] have to be careful about how we use
[783.78 - 787.50] public facilities to stay mind hold that
[785.70 - 789.18] pathogen transmission is common in
[787.50 - 791.70] restrooms
[789.18 - 794.88] that's one of the biggest places that
[791.70 - 796.86] pathogen transmission occurs it's in the
[794.88 - 798.72] restrooms anyway we're talking about the
[796.86 - 800.22] pathogen exposure shot this is day two
[798.72 - 802.50] of the medical medium brain shot therapy
[800.22 - 804.48] cleanse challenge
[802.50 - 806.34] I got brain Saver in my hand do you have
[804.48 - 808.32] brain saver do you have brain saver
[806.34 - 811.08] protocols two incredible books
[808.32 - 814.20] amazon.com us on sale right now which is
[811.08 - 815.94] incredible all on its own
[814.20 - 817.98] you guys I got ingredients in front of
[815.94 - 819.96] me we're doing the exposure shot pretty
[817.98 - 822.36] soon and I'm excited about that you have
[819.96 - 824.64] your ingredients by the way and have you
[822.36 - 826.44] signed up to the cleanse challenge the
[824.64 - 830.36] brain shot therapy challenge so I just
[826.44 - 830.36] want to remind everybody so
[830.52 - 835.16] sharing food and drink and dining out
[835.32 - 840.12] be mindful of sharing food and drink
[838.20 - 844.16] you're also sharing saliva sometimes
[840.12 - 844.16] even microscopic blood particles
[844.26 - 848.34] sometimes we share food and drink
[846.06 - 850.62] knowingly as when we eat off the same
[848.34 - 852.66] plate or drink out of the same bottle or
[850.62 - 855.68] glass sometimes we share with other
[852.66 - 858.00] people unknowingly
[855.68 - 860.16] restaurants do not usually clean their
[858.00 - 863.16] glasses properly there tends to be
[860.16 - 866.16] residue on all the glasses
[863.16 - 869.88] lipstick residue for example tends to
[866.16 - 872.10] hold on to pathogens on glasses so
[869.88 - 875.04] that's just people don't realize the
[872.10 - 876.96] restaurants and bars they don't wash
[875.04 - 880.08] those glasses good
[876.96 - 882.02] lipstick could sit residue on the
[880.08 - 886.08] glasses just over and over again
[882.02 - 892.14] lipstick encapsulates pathogens protects
[886.08 - 894.60] them like a waxy protective cover
[892.14 - 896.52] keeping the bugs sustained on the
[894.60 - 898.26] glasses for days
[896.52 - 900.24] so if you're drinking your glass at the
[898.26 - 901.74] restaurant lipstick is
[900.24 - 903.54] holding
[901.74 - 905.52] and harboring
[903.54 - 906.96] leftover lipstick on the glasses you
[905.52 - 908.76] can't even see the leftover lipstick
[906.96 - 911.70] it's not like see me read a perfect red
[908.76 - 914.60] print like red lipstick like
[911.70 - 914.60] it's print on there
[915.36 - 920.46] check this one out
[917.16 - 923.34] see if this sounds appetizing
[920.46 - 926.34] Benny Jen says bars rinse their glasses
[923.34 - 928.44] a rinse isn't good enough
[926.34 - 931.08] that's for sure
[928.44 - 934.16] that would not make me feel confident if
[931.08 - 938.04] I was in a bar we rinsed our glasses
[934.16 - 941.10] great all right
[938.04 - 943.50] um by the way you just touched the glass
[941.10 - 945.54] from the inside of the glass as you've
[943.50 - 947.88] got it ready in hand and filled it up
[945.54 - 950.34] thank you for doing that bartender thank
[947.88 - 952.20] you for putting your hands inside my
[950.34 - 954.24] glass
[952.20 - 956.34] God knows what was on your hands when
[954.24 - 957.90] you just went to the bathroom is there a
[956.34 - 961.46] feces on your hands because it's now
[957.90 - 961.46] inside my glass at the bar
[961.62 - 968.28] foreign
[963.50 - 970.14] sounds appetizing okay you guys
[968.28 - 973.26] many men
[970.14 - 976.26] have extremely sticky saliva
[973.26 - 976.26] barf
[978.06 - 982.62] right I don't know is it does that make
[980.82 - 984.84] you like does that make when I heard
[982.62 - 986.52] that from spiritual compassion like how
[984.84 - 988.56] would how would anybody know that
[986.52 - 990.84] there's no science on that there's no
[988.56 - 993.18] report on that there's no study on that
[990.84 - 995.94] sort of capacity told me that men have
[993.18 - 999.42] really sticky saliva and when I heard
[995.94 - 1001.58] that I was like we do like what what do
[999.42 - 1003.76] you mean we have sticky saliva I was
[1001.58 - 1003.76] like
[1004.16 - 1006.34] foreign
[1006.86 - 1011.66] many men have sticky extremely sticky
[1009.50 - 1015.20] saliva because men often go around
[1011.66 - 1018.80] chronically dehydrated
[1015.20 - 1023.24] eating protein heavy diets
[1018.80 - 1026.00] and protein is extremely sticky
[1023.24 - 1029.12] and proteins are extremely sticky Foods
[1026.00 - 1031.94] higher protein diets tend to make saliva
[1029.12 - 1035.18] very very gluey
[1031.94 - 1038.96] men's saliva can sit on glasses for a
[1035.18 - 1040.94] week after multiple Washings
[1038.96 - 1044.68] hey but the bartender just rinsed the
[1040.94 - 1044.68] glass out that's good enough for me
[1044.90 - 1049.46] thank you bartender for rinsing out that
[1047.66 - 1051.68] glass
[1049.46 - 1055.16] you put your hands inside that glass too
[1051.68 - 1058.58] when you gave it to me thank you
[1055.16 - 1060.26] all right you guys if anybody just came
[1058.58 - 1062.36] on here we're day two the medical mean
[1060.26 - 1063.98] Branch out there be cleanse challenge
[1062.36 - 1067.40] okay
[1063.98 - 1069.50] Forks in restaurants oh my God
[1067.40 - 1072.32] Forks
[1069.50 - 1074.90] dude
[1072.32 - 1079.12] Forks in restaurants just like Forks at
[1074.90 - 1079.12] home create small injuries in the mouth
[1079.40 - 1084.46] small injuries in the mouth
[1081.50 - 1084.46] unnoticeable
[1084.50 - 1089.20] the steel in Forks is porous
[1089.30 - 1098.48] metal forks stick into the person's gums
[1094.60 - 1101.20] dislodging tiny bits of plaque and gum
[1098.48 - 1101.20] bacteria
[1101.44 - 1105.14] this is why I don't use forks in a
[1104.24 - 1108.68] restaurant
[1105.14 - 1111.68] Olga says even a dishwasher can't rid of
[1108.68 - 1114.70] that no way people's lipstick gluey
[1111.68 - 1117.50] saliva in in restaurants
[1114.70 - 1120.14] notoriously two in restaurants that
[1117.50 - 1123.50] stuff doesn't leave those glasses easy
[1120.14 - 1125.42] me too 787 on YouTube good to see you
[1123.50 - 1127.70] the hot water would often run out when
[1125.42 - 1130.04] it was busy at the restaurant I worked
[1127.70 - 1131.72] at uh-huh and I've heard that a billion
[1130.04 - 1135.38] times by the way but dishes were still
[1131.72 - 1137.72] being washed correctamundo
[1135.38 - 1140.12] I've totally seen that I've heard that
[1137.72 - 1143.36] so many times too
[1140.12 - 1145.58] me too that was good thank you
[1143.36 - 1148.34] metal forks sticking to the person's
[1145.58 - 1150.20] gums dislodging tiny bits of plaque and
[1148.34 - 1152.84] gum bacteria
[1150.20 - 1154.34] compressing it into the pores of the
[1152.84 - 1157.52] fork
[1154.34 - 1161.66] you know that right that that's
[1157.52 - 1165.32] plaque and skin flakes inside the mouth
[1161.66 - 1168.14] skin cells being pressed into the fork
[1165.32 - 1170.42] the porous parts of the fork so the
[1168.14 - 1172.94] pores in the silverware get clogged up
[1170.42 - 1178.48] with cells from the inside of people's
[1172.94 - 1178.48] mouths including micro amounts of blood
[1178.70 - 1183.26] restaurant
[1180.38 - 1186.64] Forks okay
[1183.26 - 1186.64] filled with all of that
[1186.92 - 1195.16] Forks in restaurants can be biohazards
[1191.84 - 1195.16] nobody knew that
[1195.74 - 1200.48] watch it be talked about now out there
[1198.32 - 1203.84] well poached once again for the medical
[1200.48 - 1206.42] meeting books and not cited
[1203.84 - 1208.88] they're not sterilized as if you were at
[1206.42 - 1210.68] the dentist's office at the dentist's
[1208.88 - 1212.78] office before they stick metal in your
[1210.68 - 1215.06] mouth you guys they have to put it in
[1212.78 - 1217.46] the sterilization machine or open up a
[1215.06 - 1221.44] brand new one
[1217.46 - 1221.44] they're not doing that at the restaurant
[1223.64 - 1229.76] they're not sterilized as if you were at
[1226.52 - 1231.98] the dentist's office where a sterilized
[1229.76 - 1234.86] tool goes in your mouth even if it's
[1231.98 - 1236.30] just poking around on a tooth let me
[1234.86 - 1240.08] look here
[1236.30 - 1244.76] okay Jessica let's just take a look yep
[1240.08 - 1244.76] yep poking in here does that hurt oh
[1246.08 - 1250.76] instead eating with bar or restaurant
[1248.72 - 1253.16] silverware is like going to the dental
[1250.76 - 1255.74] office where they take all their dental
[1253.16 - 1257.66] tools and wash them by hand or throw
[1255.74 - 1259.94] them in a common dishwasher would you
[1257.66 - 1261.50] like the dentist to just take all their
[1259.94 - 1263.06] dental tools and put it in a common
[1261.50 - 1265.58] dishwasher
[1263.06 - 1267.68] don't worry
[1265.58 - 1270.26] um assistant
[1267.68 - 1272.72] um Dental nurse hygienist nurse
[1270.26 - 1275.06] hygienist can you go back at the
[1272.72 - 1277.76] dishwasher back there and can you get
[1275.06 - 1279.02] all the dental tools out we ran it on
[1277.76 - 1284.50] clean
[1279.02 - 1284.50] cycle whatever rinse rinse cycle
[1291.74 - 1296.30] as is mind-blowing my mind is blown my
[1294.92 - 1297.74] mind was blown when Spirit of compassion
[1296.30 - 1298.70] gave me the info to begin with I was
[1297.74 - 1300.98] like what
[1298.70 - 1302.54] I mean I've known some of it that Spirit
[1300.98 - 1303.74] of passion has given to me why I go to
[1302.54 - 1305.54] restaurants and stuff but when I really
[1303.74 - 1308.32] think about the details around it too
[1305.54 - 1308.32] it's been insane
[1309.32 - 1313.82] because most dishwashers do not get hot
[1311.90 - 1315.98] enough to kill pathogens that's another
[1313.82 - 1318.92] thing dishwashers in restaurants aren't
[1315.98 - 1322.42] hot enough to kill pathogens you gotta
[1318.92 - 1322.42] have some serious Heat
[1323.60 - 1328.28] before putting them in your mouth or the
[1326.30 - 1330.44] next patient
[1328.28 - 1332.36] that's why I say that utensils in
[1330.44 - 1334.76] restaurants can be biohazards
[1332.36 - 1336.44] potentially spreading every pathogen and
[1334.76 - 1339.20] disease
[1336.44 - 1343.34] and for years I've said that busy chefs
[1339.20 - 1345.32] oh I know chefs hate me too
[1343.34 - 1348.34] everybody hates me now it's been
[1345.32 - 1348.34] building up for years
[1349.28 - 1353.48] leaving chefs hate me now and for years
[1351.44 - 1355.28] I've said that busy chefs in busy
[1353.48 - 1357.26] restaurants often cut their hands and
[1355.28 - 1361.18] fingers daily
[1357.26 - 1361.18] which is Russian Roulette
[1361.46 - 1365.92] for transmitting any kind of pathogen
[1370.28 - 1373.94] oh
[1372.08 - 1374.84] thought I saw a comment it is brain
[1373.94 - 1376.58] saver
[1374.84 - 1379.88] someone's asking I'm reading out a brain

[1389.42 - 1393.82] brain saver book so we're doing the
[1390.80 - 1393.82] pathogen exposure job
[1394.16 - 1397.82] here are some tips if you have to eat
[1396.38 - 1399.68] out so if you're something you have to
[1397.82 - 1402.26] eat out here are some tips get ready for
[1399.68 - 1405.38] them bring alcohol wipes and wipe your
[1402.26 - 1408.26] forks and other utensils it's not a
[1405.38 - 1410.78] guarantee but it's definitely something
[1408.26 - 1413.36] or ask for a mug get this one this is
[1410.78 - 1414.86] what I have always done get ready for
[1413.36 - 1417.98] this one
[1414.86 - 1422.00] when I'm at a restaurant I'll say can I
[1417.98 - 1424.88] have a mug of scalding hot water
[1422.00 - 1428.18] like you know for tea
[1424.88 - 1430.40] and then I place my utensils in that so
[1428.18 - 1432.14] they bring a mug of scalding hot water
[1430.40 - 1434.60] lake for tea
[1432.14 - 1437.72] and then I'll take my fork in the
[1434.60 - 1441.02] restaurant plop that in there like that
[1437.72 - 1443.42] and just let it sit there for a while
[1441.02 - 1444.44] is that not the coolest or what that's
[1443.42 - 1445.58] the coolest
[1444.44 - 1447.44] people want to know what the medical
[1445.58 - 1448.78] medium does
[1447.44 - 1451.82] here's one right here ready
[1448.78 - 1453.92] alternatively bring your own utensils or
[1451.82 - 1456.26] order food that doesn't require utensils
[1453.92 - 1458.36] and eat with your hands
[1456.26 - 1460.52] but you got to be careful though where
[1458.36 - 1462.32] were your hands were they opening up the
[1460.52 - 1464.30] restaurant door like yeah I'm coming in
[1462.32 - 1468.32] to eat boom grab the restaurant door
[1464.30 - 1470.78] you've got strep covet RSV flu all in
[1468.32 - 1472.28] your hands now lupus free with celery
[1470.78 - 1473.96] three through three my friend owns
[1472.28 - 1477.26] restaurants and she said when the
[1473.96 - 1478.88] utensils are still dry so sorry she said
[1477.26 - 1481.34] when the utensils are still dirty after
[1478.88 - 1484.00] the washer they just dip in water and
[1481.34 - 1484.00] wipe them
[1484.04 - 1488.24] now I believe it
[1486.44 - 1492.26] so alternatively you could bring your
[1488.24 - 1493.40] own utensils which I've done but I do
[1492.26 - 1496.04] you know
[1493.40 - 1499.82] like to put the utensils in a hot you
[1496.04 - 1501.56] know mug of water there too if I can
[1499.82 - 1503.72] or I'll order something that doesn't
[1501.56 - 1506.68] require using utensils then I'll make
[1503.72 - 1506.68] sure my hands are clean
[1506.78 - 1510.14] ask for your food to go this is an
[1509.12 - 1511.34] important tip right here if you're
[1510.14 - 1513.56] eating out in restaurants you guys
[1511.34 - 1516.20] seriously check this out this is just
[1513.56 - 1517.88] incredible ask for your food to come
[1516.20 - 1519.98] very hot
[1517.88 - 1522.68] if the chef cut their finger while
[1519.98 - 1526.16] preparing your meal or there's foodborne
[1522.68 - 1528.20] pathogens on there too the heat of the
[1526.16 - 1530.42] food and the plate is a great way to
[1528.20 - 1533.42] kill viruses that may be in that blood
[1530.42 - 1536.12] of the chef that got it on your food
[1533.42 - 1538.46] if you're doing a raw dish then that's
[1536.12 - 1539.96] not you know raw salad obviously you
[1538.46 - 1541.88] can't throw it in heat you know in the
[1539.96 - 1543.32] oven but ask for your food to come
[1541.88 - 1544.10] really hot if you're ordering cooked
[1543.32 - 1548.80] food
[1544.10 - 1548.80] that's what I've done in a restaurant
[1549.74 - 1555.20] because I worry about eating raw food in
[1553.16 - 1557.90] a restaurant because I don't know if
[1555.20 - 1561.56] chicken juices went and spilled on raw
[1557.90 - 1563.66] chicken on my my lettuce
[1561.56 - 1565.82] and I would also do the pathogen
[1563.66 - 1568.22] exposure shot when you come home after
[1565.82 - 1570.94] you ate at the restaurant and maybe even
[1568.22 - 1570.94] before you go
[1573.26 - 1577.28] how about this one
[1574.76 - 1579.08] ask for beverages that come in bottles
[1577.28 - 1582.62] that haven't been opened to avoid
[1579.08 - 1585.26] drinking out of glasses I've done that
[1582.62 - 1587.00] I've consumed beverages out of bottles
[1585.26 - 1588.50] because I didn't want to drink out of
[1587.00 - 1590.06] the glass I'd be like can you give me a
[1588.50 - 1591.80] bottle
[1590.06 - 1594.50] ready for this though
[1591.80 - 1596.36] wipe off the top and the neck of the
[1594.50 - 1599.12] bottle with an alcohol wipe before
[1596.36 - 1600.62] drinking because then the bottle gets
[1599.12 - 1602.54] brought to you
[1600.62 - 1605.84] by a waiter
[1602.54 - 1608.12] that has possibly 10 viruses and bugs
[1605.84 - 1609.86] and bacteria and feces on their hands
[1608.12 - 1610.82] because it's just going to happen and
[1609.86 - 1612.86] then
[1610.82 - 1615.20] or the waiter was grabbing everybody's
[1612.86 - 1617.24] dirty dishes and forks and stuff like
[1615.20 - 1619.16] that and then oh yeah I'll get you a
[1617.24 - 1622.54] bottle would you like sparkling water
[1619.16 - 1622.54] get you a bottle here it is
[1624.74 - 1628.58] wipe off the top and neck of the bottle
[1626.90 - 1631.58] with alcohol white before drinking gas
[1628.58 - 1633.56] your lips May slip past the part of the
[1631.58 - 1635.30] bottle that had been under the cap onto
[1633.56 - 1637.16] the area where the server was touching
[1635.30 - 1639.44] the bottle as They carried it because
[1637.16 - 1642.26] you know when you drink the bottle your
[1639.44 - 1645.56] lips might slap you know they might slip
[1642.26 - 1647.54] past that top of the bottle
[1645.56 - 1650.48] and you know hit the area that's
[1647.54 - 1653.30] wherever contaminated
[1650.48 - 1654.26] if bottles aren't an option ask for a
[1653.30 - 1655.70] can
[1654.26 - 1657.26] but then you're dealing with aluminum
[1655.70 - 1658.16] but hey look you do the best you can
[1657.26 - 1661.28] make sure you're doing the heavy metal
[1658.16 - 1663.32] detox cleanses that are in these books
[1661.28 - 1665.36] in which case try to wipe down the rim
[1663.32 - 1666.80] and pour area of the can before opening
[1665.36 - 1668.54] I understand you have to drink out of a
[1666.80 - 1670.04] can for some situation I'm on board
[1668.54 - 1672.20] whatever
[1670.04 - 1674.30] not shaming anybody there's just ways of
[1672.20 - 1676.82] doing it right to protect yourself
[1674.30 - 1679.40] lesser evils
[1676.82 - 1682.04] if you're forced to drink out of a glass
[1679.40 - 1684.08] this is interesting
[1682.04 - 1687.74] if you're forced to drink out of a glass
[1684.08 - 1690.04] ask for a wrapped straw or bring your
[1687.74 - 1693.02] own straw
[1690.04 - 1696.22] if you can bring your own cup and glass
[1693.02 - 1696.22] to the restaurant too
[1696.92 - 1700.22] all right so let's talk about dental
[1698.24 - 1703.16] visits for a couple of seconds pathogen
[1700.22 - 1705.62] exposure shot here's a comment right
[1703.16 - 1708.02] here on oh Miss Candy
[1705.62 - 1711.74] it's people like you that cause Mass
[1708.02 - 1714.74] hysteria about germs and not wanting to
[1711.74 - 1717.68] get them and then staying in and never
[1714.74 - 1719.14] leaving their homes really germs are
[1717.68 - 1722.48] okay
[1719.14 - 1725.48] ah you're one of those people
[1722.48 - 1725.48] interesting
[1725.98 - 1732.86] well first of all I would like to
[1729.02 - 1733.94] respond to that comment very much so
[1732.86 - 1736.58] so
[1733.94 - 1740.18] if germs are okay
[1736.58 - 1742.52] right what about all the people that
[1740.18 - 1744.92] have lost your lives to germs was it
[1742.52 - 1748.34] okay for them
[1744.92 - 1751.72] what about all the elderly people that
[1748.34 - 1751.72] were knocked off by covet
[1751.82 - 1759.50] was germs okay for them in the moment
[1756.26 - 1761.30] how many people died of covid
[1759.50 - 1764.00] how many people die of the flu every
[1761.30 - 1766.70] year was germs okay for them
[1764.00 - 1768.68] I'm just wondering
[1766.70 - 1769.76] well we can't ask them because they're
[1768.68 - 1772.52] gone
[1769.76 - 1775.46] so we can't call those people up and say
[1772.52 - 1777.92] you were in a nursing home and they
[1775.46 - 1780.26] weren't careful there
[1777.92 - 1782.60] and covet ran through it
[1780.26 - 1785.18] or you know
[1782.60 - 1786.80] Kobe ran through your house and knocked
[1785.18 - 1789.98] off your aunt
[1786.80 - 1793.34] or your grandmother grandfather but we
[1789.98 - 1796.46] can't ask them if germs were okay
[1793.34 - 1799.28] with them we can't ask them it's really
[1796.46 - 1800.72] ignorant ignorant thing you just said
[1799.28 - 1802.28] you don't know the cause of chronic
[1800.72 - 1805.40] illness
[1802.28 - 1806.96] it's actually pathogens germs
[1805.40 - 1808.34] so you got people that are better and
[1806.96 - 1810.98] you got moms that can't get out of bed
[1808.34 - 1812.90] to feed their children
[1810.98 - 1814.82] you got teenagers that are suffering
[1812.90 - 1818.60] with autoimmune right now because of
[1814.82 - 1821.12] germs viruses and bacteria
[1818.60 - 1823.76] but you're but you're really ignorant
[1821.12 - 1824.90] about all of this and I'm not blaming
[1823.76 - 1827.00] you
[1824.90 - 1828.86] but you should probably learn something
[1827.00 - 1831.08] here
[1828.86 - 1833.30] and not be really
[1831.08 - 1835.04] you know
[1833.30 - 1837.74] dumb about it
[1835.04 - 1839.54] awareness is actually the key of knowing
[1837.74 - 1840.92] so you can keep precautions so if you're
[1839.54 - 1842.24] somebody really suffering with chronic
[1840.92 - 1844.64] illness right now and you had a hard
[1842.24 - 1846.50] time in your life and you you already
[1844.64 - 1847.82] have neurological fatigue because you're
[1846.50 - 1849.62] dealing with a mystery illness because
[1847.82 - 1852.32] you're dealing with like a virus like
[1849.62 - 1854.12] Epstein-Barr giving you brain
[1852.32 - 1855.86] inflammation and everything else like I
[1854.12 - 1857.24] talk about the brain books you're
[1855.86 - 1860.24] already suffering
[1857.24 - 1862.04] you don't need more epstein-bars you
[1860.24 - 1864.14] don't need more simplexes you don't need
[1862.04 - 1867.14] more Simplex too you don't need more
[1864.14 - 1868.46] anything you need more streptococcus if
[1867.14 - 1870.38] you're already suffering with acne
[1868.46 - 1872.84] because of strep
[1870.38 - 1874.52] do you need more more germs do you need
[1872.84 - 1877.16] more streptococcus because you can have
[1874.52 - 1879.56] even worse acne I mean
[1877.16 - 1881.36] you don't want you don't want to pick up
[1879.56 - 1883.34] three different strips from using public
[1881.36 - 1885.68] restrooms wrong knowing how to take
[1883.34 - 1888.86] precautions and and how you know this
[1885.68 - 1891.68] has your back protecting you so you
[1888.86 - 1894.20] don't live a Lifetime on antibiotics
[1891.68 - 1895.64] you pick up two more streptococcus off
[1894.20 - 1897.92] of a toilet seat
[1895.64 - 1899.84] and now you're gonna like more UTIs and
[1897.92 - 1901.94] you're on antibiotics
[1899.84 - 1903.32] is that a good thing so you really like
[1901.94 - 1904.88] germs
[1903.32 - 1906.92] that would probably be the stupidest
[1904.88 - 1908.90] thing comment I've ever read in a long
[1906.92 - 1910.64] time actually
[1908.90 - 1913.76] someone of those people that make people
[1910.64 - 1915.74] afraid of germs come on the darkness
[1913.76 - 1918.02] wants you to be in the dark and not know
[1915.74 - 1919.64] about any of these germs in any of these
[1918.02 - 1921.62] bugs they don't the darkness doesn't
[1919.64 - 1923.42] want you to protect yourself
[1921.62 - 1925.04] classified medical research and Sciences
[1923.42 - 1926.84] want you to protect yourself no one
[1925.04 - 1929.24] wants you to protect yourself they want
[1926.84 - 1931.52] you sick sick or sicker sicker do you
[1929.24 - 1933.74] pay the price until you're gone bye they
[1931.52 - 1936.32] just want you to go
[1933.74 - 1938.12] so yeah
[1936.32 - 1939.92] and if you're under that if you're under
[1938.12 - 1942.14] that thought
[1939.92 - 1945.80] if you're under that belief that germs
[1942.14 - 1948.92] make you stronger oh really
[1945.80 - 1950.66] oh they do they make you stronger
[1948.92 - 1953.18] uh-huh
[1950.66 - 1955.10] tell that to somebody who just got mono
[1953.18 - 1957.86] and it beat the
[1955.10 - 1960.38] crap out of them
[1957.86 - 1961.88] it really makes you stronger and now
[1960.38 - 1963.74] they got thyroid problems five years
[1961.88 - 1965.24] later and now they've got fibromyalgia
[1963.74 - 1967.10] five years later because if I've seen
[1965.24 - 1968.90] bar oh that made them stronger
[1967.10 - 1972.02] this information is so you can be aware
[1968.90 - 1973.88] and know how to kill pathogens
[1972.02 - 1976.28] that's what this is it's so you can use
[1973.88 - 1977.72] your own free will to actually Empower
[1976.28 - 1979.94] yourself and be like you know what I'm
[1977.72 - 1982.52] not gonna be a sucker anymore and I'm
[1979.94 - 1984.02] not going to be brainwashed anymore and
[1982.52 - 1985.70] I'm going to have my Free Will and use
[1984.02 - 1988.90] my Free Will and protect myself from
[1985.70 - 1988.90] pathogens in the whole bit
[1991.10 - 1994.70] so you can defend yourself because the
[1993.26 - 1996.50] chronically ill they can't defend
[1994.70 - 1997.88] themselves
[1996.50 - 2000.46] it's hard
[1997.88 - 2002.86] the system's not set up for them to do
[2000.46 - 2005.26] that there are things we can do and be
[2002.86 - 2008.02] smart about as we go along
[2005.26 - 2011.32] our way things to protect ourselves with
[2008.02 - 2013.60] so when someone says a comment like that
[2011.32 - 2016.84] it just shows me how
[2013.60 - 2019.48] really out of touch you are and also
[2016.84 - 2021.34] you've never been sick yet
[2019.48 - 2022.60] with chronic illness but when you get
[2021.34 - 2023.98] chronic illness we'll see what you're
[2022.60 - 2026.80] we'll see who's laughing down the road
[2023.98 - 2030.10] then you'll be all upset
[2026.80 - 2033.16] our Schroeder said I love how he reads
[2030.10 - 2035.62] all comments either good or bad he's so
[2033.16 - 2036.54] honest I try my best and I'm at your
[2035.62 - 2039.34] service
[2036.54 - 2041.74] and that's your service I'll even do a
[2039.34 - 2043.66] curtsy Nicholas Russell says people
[2041.74 - 2047.02] think germs strengthen their immune
[2043.66 - 2049.80] systems oh really
[2047.02 - 2049.80] really
[2051.16 - 2056.14] that's why you know so many people are
[2053.08 - 2058.54] dying right now that's unbelievable me
[2056.14 - 2061.06] too 787 it's amazing that so many are
[2058.54 - 2063.64] under the spell of more exposure makes
[2061.06 - 2067.08] you stronger but stay away from Grandma
[2063.64 - 2069.60] if you're sick exactly
[2067.08 - 2072.82] contradictions
[2069.60 - 2076.12] constant contradictions
[2072.82 - 2078.28] that's what that is exactly
[2076.12 - 2080.74] exactly
[2078.28 - 2082.96] germs make you stronger let me go pick
[2080.74 - 2085.36] up another Simplex herpes one cold sore
[2082.96 - 2087.34] virus and now I got trigeminal neuralgia
[2085.36 - 2091.00] I'm suffering and I'm on a whole bunch
[2087.34 - 2091.00] of freaking oxies
[2091.60 - 2096.22] how many people are literally on opioids
[2094.12 - 2097.96] prescribed from their doctor because
[2096.22 - 2100.06] their trigeminal neurologist making it
[2097.96 - 2102.76] so they can't even live
[2100.06 - 2105.34] because of herpes simplex one oh so let
[2102.76 - 2108.54] me go and catch another and maybe two
[2105.34 - 2108.54] more and not be aware
[2109.90 - 2114.94] I mean I can go on all day but we're in
[2112.18 - 2116.86] the brain shot therapy cleanse challenge
[2114.94 - 2119.92] yep
[2116.86 - 2121.48] MV Doom over there on YouTube so if
[2119.92 - 2123.34] you're completely healthy you should
[2121.48 - 2124.72] still be taking all the precautions yeah
[2123.34 - 2126.58] of course
[2124.72 - 2128.92] of course you should because guess what
[2126.58 - 2130.54] no one stays completely healthy and by
[2128.92 - 2132.34] the way no one is completely healthy now
[2130.54 - 2134.98] in this day and age
[2132.34 - 2137.38] everybody has something
[2134.98 - 2139.30] gnawing at them
[2137.38 - 2140.80] and yeah if you don't stay aware of it
[2139.30 - 2142.42] you'll collect all these pathogens and
[2140.80 - 2144.52] get sicker down the road
[2142.42 - 2147.18] I don't know if anybody's watching the
[2144.52 - 2147.18] world right now
[2148.06 - 2154.18] but the drugstores have lines of people
[2150.24 - 2156.64] sick like never before in our history
[2154.18 - 2158.92] the medical industry
[2156.64 - 2160.06] is like crashing hospitals are filled
[2158.92 - 2162.52] with people
[2160.06 - 2165.64] the world has changed everybody's
[2162.52 - 2167.14] getting sick everybody's sick you might
[2165.64 - 2169.06] be healthy right now strong and
[2167.14 - 2170.92] everything's good
[2169.06 - 2173.20] and if you don't take care of yourself
[2170.92 - 2176.62] and know without what to look out for to
[2173.20 - 2180.10] protect yourself boom
[2176.62 - 2183.16] the scale is tipped Heidi Curtis says
[2180.10 - 2184.66] I'd rather know the truth viruses were
[2183.16 - 2186.58] making me super sick until I found
[2184.66 - 2189.46] medical meme information I'm so grateful
[2186.58 - 2192.22] it's critical to know the truth and then
[2189.46 - 2193.72] because you've already been sick from
[2192.22 - 2195.76] any kind of viruses you've already had
[2193.72 - 2198.16] pathogen exposure in your life it's good
[2195.76 - 2200.98] to actually know what to look out for so
[2198.16 - 2203.50] you don't add to it sure somebody else
[2200.98 - 2204.94] out there who's not sick enough yet or
[2203.50 - 2207.40] they're not so sick and they're just
[2204.94 - 2209.14] going to their acupuncturist for some
[2207.40 - 2210.82] you know little bit of needles in their
[2209.14 - 2212.44] back or they're going to get a massage
[2210.82 - 2214.96] once a while or they go see their
[2212.44 - 2217.12] routine doctor for a checkup
[2214.96 - 2219.58] because they get a headache once every
[2217.12 - 2221.50] six months those people we're gonna are
[2219.58 - 2223.42] gonna get sick down the road too they're
[2221.50 - 2225.28] not looking out for exposures they're
[2223.42 - 2227.26] not looking into anything they're gonna
[2225.28 - 2229.90] get sick later anyway because it happens
[2227.26 - 2232.42] every day just because
[2229.90 - 2233.92] you don't know about it and are not
[2232.42 - 2235.42] aware of what's going on out there
[2233.92 - 2238.24] doesn't mean it's not happening that's
[2235.42 - 2240.72] where ignoring things bites you in the
[2238.24 - 2240.72] butt
[2242.44 - 2248.16] anyway
[2244.60 - 2248.16] that was a good comment
[2249.04 - 2254.20] all right so what else can I
[2252.28 - 2255.64] what else can I read Dental visits let's
[2254.20 - 2257.08] just run into Dental visits are you guys

[2283.30 - 2288.42] their teeth out there
[2285.16 - 2288.42] people don't realize that
[2288.76 - 2294.82] all right Dental visits
[2291.88 - 2296.62] Warehouse one on YouTube says

[2319.78 - 2324.88] herpes simplex 1 whatever it is

[2326.26 - 2331.24] and and use your free will to break it
[2329.08 - 2334.30] down that's why we're doing the exposure
[2331.24 - 2336.22] the pathogen exposure shot right now
[2334.30 - 2339.40] and bring the books to your doctor and
[2336.22 - 2341.44] ask your doctor's advice on what to do

[2347.86 - 2352.54] it for a little bit all right
[2350.68 - 2355.54] the dentist's office is another place
[2352.54 - 2358.06] where pathogens are transferred
[2355.54 - 2360.34] often dentists hygienists and assistants
[2358.06 - 2363.70] will put oh my God
[2360.34 - 2367.50] will put on their gloves and then start
[2363.70 - 2367.50] touching everything with their gloves
[2367.96 - 2373.72] the dentist and the hygienist and the
[2370.66 - 2376.36] the assistant at the dentist office is
[2373.72 - 2378.72] wearing their gloves to protect them not
[2376.36 - 2378.72] you
[2380.16 - 2386.26] foreign oh thank God my dentist and his
[2384.10 - 2391.48] sister thank God my thank God that
[2386.26 - 2395.44] hygienist is wearing nitrile gloves phew
[2391.48 - 2398.20] meanwhile the hygienist is grabbing this
[2395.44 - 2401.32] boom grabbing that grabbing this in here
[2398.20 - 2403.24] opening up drawers grabbing this and who
[2401.32 - 2407.34] knows what's on the gloves right now and
[2403.24 - 2407.34] then I was going in here like this
[2408.28 - 2412.78] you know
[2410.64 - 2414.46] after they had their hands in other
[2412.78 - 2415.84] people's mouths too like all kinds of
[2414.46 - 2417.22] different stuff like meaning and then
[2415.84 - 2418.66] they're touching everything right now
[2417.22 - 2420.28] they're touching all those surfaces
[2418.66 - 2422.44] again of course it might take a little
[2420.28 - 2424.48] handy wipe and go oh well I'll do the
[2422.44 - 2427.68] light handle there I'll do this for a
[2424.48 - 2427.68] second I'll do this for a second
[2430.36 - 2433.56] and they don't even do that
[2434.86 - 2438.94] they're touching the handles of the
[2436.96 - 2440.80] lights adjusting them and also touching
[2438.94 - 2443.74] chairs controls computer keyboards
[2440.80 - 2445.78] computer keyboards yeah totally
[2443.74 - 2447.46] in the end they're latex or nitrile
[2445.78 - 2448.84] gloves are only protecting the
[2447.46 - 2452.14] practitioner
[2448.84 - 2455.26] dude not protecting the patient
[2452.14 - 2459.66] drives me crazy corn EMA says I was a
[2455.26 - 2459.66] dental assistant that's so true
[2461.02 - 2465.70] bana says they keep saying that if you
[2463.96 - 2468.46] get sick your immune system is getting
[2465.70 - 2470.74] better I was sick as child very often
[2468.46 - 2474.66] and I didn't miss sorry and I didn't see
[2470.74 - 2474.66] any improvements in my immune system
[2475.24 - 2479.98] it's just really just make believe when
[2478.54 - 2484.02] they say that
[2479.98 - 2484.02] the more germs the stronger you get
[2492.10 - 2498.96] here's a cool Agostino on YouTube my dad
[2495.22 - 2498.96] is a dentist and this is true
[2500.56 - 2504.70] I believe you
[2502.66 - 2507.70] yet the surfaces are touching with those
[2504.70 - 2509.68] new gloves may have saliva blood is this
[2507.70 - 2511.66] true
[2509.68 - 2513.82] yet the services they're touching with
[2511.66 - 2516.88] those new gloves may have saliva blood
[2513.82 - 2519.46] and mouth tissue cells on them
[2516.88 - 2523.12] and those surfaces have often not been
[2519.46 - 2528.40] sterilized between patients
[2523.12 - 2528.40] that's how pathogens can be transmitted
[2530.26 - 2533.50] all right so let me read this next
[2532.24 - 2535.48] little part if you guys got another
[2533.50 - 2537.52] second
[2535.48 - 2540.58] to avoid this situation bring your own
[2537.52 - 2543.70] disinfecting wipes to the dentist and
[2540.58 - 2545.98] ask them to wipe down high touch spots
[2543.70 - 2547.72] such as controls buttons and handles
[2545.98 - 2550.30] that they think they're going to use
[2547.72 - 2552.70] during your procedure
[2550.30 - 2555.22] and ask them to put on fresh gloves
[2552.70 - 2558.84] afterwards so after they do all that
[2555.22 - 2561.34] have them put on another set of gloves
[2558.84 - 2564.28] you can't be afraid to ask your dentist
[2561.34 - 2565.96] for better sanitary steps to be taken if
[2564.28 - 2567.88] people learn to request this it will
[2565.96 - 2570.42] become more common practice in the
[2567.88 - 2570.42] dentist office

[2667.42 - 2671.32] basic tip

[2671.32 - 2674.62] hygiene
[2672.52 - 2677.56] like hand washing when you're been in
[2674.62 - 2679.90] public spaces that's the thing
[2677.56 - 2681.58] you get off out of an airport and you
[2679.90 - 2684.00] get some place you want to wash your
[2681.58 - 2684.00] hands
[2684.94 - 2692.38] Susan Blanda says not Dental phobia get
[2688.60 - 2694.48] sick after almost every visit
[2692.38 - 2696.04] so it's not Dental phobia you actually
[2694.48 - 2698.02] get sick after a revisit I can't tell
[2696.04 - 2699.58] you how many people get sick
[2698.02 - 2702.52] after a visit at the dental office
[2699.58 - 2705.42] especially around flu season
[2702.52 - 2705.42] which is now
[2711.10 - 2715.00] you know be careful with shopping carts
[2712.78 - 2716.74] too then they say medical medium
[2715.00 - 2719.74] information didn't work
[2716.74 - 2721.90] I started medical medium yeah I've been
[2719.74 - 2724.30] doing it for like a month
[2721.90 - 2726.04] I'm doing my celery juice I'm listening
[2724.30 - 2727.54] to this crazy guy I'm doing medical
[2726.04 - 2730.54] medium
[2727.54 - 2732.28] yeah and then I got so sick
[2730.54 - 2735.16] so sick
[2732.28 - 2737.38] my stomach got sick I got a fever I was
[2735.16 - 2739.24] so sick I was coughing during that
[2737.38 - 2740.62] medical medium meanwhile they were at
[2739.24 - 2744.28] the dentist's office picked up the flu
[2740.62 - 2745.84] or stomach flu got sick
[2744.28 - 2749.64] yeah
[2745.84 - 2749.64] or yeah I started medical medium
[2750.94 - 2754.92] and it was something else that got them
[2752.68 - 2754.92] sick
[2755.62 - 2759.70] foreign
[2757.78 - 2761.80] you got to worry about shopping cart
[2759.70 - 2763.12] handles I've always done that my whole
[2761.80 - 2764.56] life you got to worry about shopping
[2763.12 - 2766.36] cart handles
[2764.56 - 2768.04] you got to clean a shopping cart handle
[2766.36 - 2770.20] definitely with a handy wipe there's no
[2768.04 - 2773.10] question this is long before covet
[2770.20 - 2773.10] pre-all that
[2773.38 - 2777.88] it's also important to stay aware when
[2775.12 - 2779.98] handling objects we just brought into
[2777.88 - 2782.20] our homes okay
[2779.98 - 2784.18] I understand if you can do this if this
[2782.20 - 2786.88] isn't an option
[2784.18 - 2788.26] it just be fine but I want to read this
[2786.88 - 2789.82] one thing about packages it's
[2788.26 - 2792.22] interesting
[2789.82 - 2794.68] okay packages can be a huge source of
[2792.22 - 2797.56] transmission like the flu or covid or
[2794.68 - 2800.20] strep or MRSA okay especially when
[2797.56 - 2802.36] you're setting down packages so what I
[2800.20 - 2804.28] do is when I get a new package that
[2802.36 - 2805.84] comes there's a delivery a medical
[2804.28 - 2808.00] medium book
[2805.84 - 2810.46] right I don't take the package and throw
[2808.00 - 2812.20] it on my kitchen counter you can but
[2810.46 - 2814.00] just remember when you put that package
[2812.20 - 2815.56] on the kitchen counter you probably want
[2814.00 - 2818.14] to wipe off that kitchen counter space
[2815.56 - 2819.22] because these packages have grease
[2818.14 - 2821.98] underneath them and all kinds of
[2819.22 - 2823.86] pathogens and stuff like that
[2821.98 - 2826.66] foreign
[2823.86 - 2828.94] says I've had around 10 Dental visits
[2826.66 - 2831.70] during last year and after the last one
[2828.94 - 2833.92] I did the brain shots and this was the
[2831.70 - 2836.68] only time I didn't feel bad or sick
[2833.92 - 2839.02] after the visit definitely doing this
[2836.68 - 2841.36] again we're doing it now with this shot
[2839.02 - 2843.52] we are together
[2841.36 - 2846.40] putting that shot together I'm gonna do
[2843.52 - 2847.72] it in a couple seconds with you guys
[2846.40 - 2850.00] okay
[2847.72 - 2853.62] you might not want to set packages that
[2850.00 - 2857.80] just came in from UPS FedEx whatever the
[2853.62 - 2861.12] UPS wherever it is USPS or wherever or
[2857.80 - 2864.10] around the country around the world
[2861.12 - 2865.30] you don't want to set the packages on a
[2864.10 - 2867.34] cutting board
[2865.30 - 2869.50] so my cutting board right here like I
[2867.34 - 2871.54] won't put a package that just came in
[2869.50 - 2874.02] the mail I won't just put it on my
[2871.54 - 2874.02] cutting board
[2874.18 - 2879.22] or my kitchen counter placing a new
[2876.64 - 2881.62] package on a crib I've seen people they
[2879.22 - 2883.12] place it on a crib or on a bed or a
[2881.62 - 2884.98] couch I'm like well I wouldn't do it
[2883.12 - 2887.26] that that way either
[2884.98 - 2888.88] and then grabbing the package and then
[2887.26 - 2890.50] you're rubbing your eye you know after
[2888.88 - 2891.94] you grab the package you're rubbing your
[2890.50 - 2893.68] eye
[2891.94 - 2895.24] sure enough it's there's a good chance
[2893.68 - 2897.90] nothing's gonna happen but what if it's
[2895.24 - 2897.90] at one time
[2897.94 - 2901.36] you know you're fixing your eye makeup
[2899.74 - 2903.28] or you're moving your hair constantly
[2901.36 - 2905.56] while in the middle of opening a package
[2903.28 - 2907.06] wash your hands after handling packages
[2905.56 - 2909.88] what I'm saying is when you get packages
[2907.06 - 2912.04] fresh off you know like you just ordered
[2909.88 - 2913.60] something and it came and you grabbed
[2912.04 - 2915.22] your package and brought it in put it in
[2913.60 - 2917.44] a spot where you don't think it's going
[2915.22 - 2920.04] to be a you know a big exposure spot
[2917.44 - 2923.38] like your cutting board or your bed
[2920.04 - 2925.18] don't put the package on your bed put it
[2923.38 - 2928.50] somewhere right and then wash your hands
[2925.18 - 2928.50] after you've opened up the package
[2928.72 - 2933.88] it's just it's good
[2931.72 - 2935.62] find a designated area for your packages
[2933.88 - 2938.26] that isn't a high exposure spot in your
[2935.62 - 2939.58] home if you are not in a rush to open it
[2938.26 - 2941.14] wait a day
[2939.58 - 2944.28] unless it's a medical medium book then
[2941.14 - 2944.28] wash your hands up here
[2944.92 - 2949.44] a practice I call decanting the practice
[2947.26 - 2951.64] you like wine decanting the wine
[2949.44 - 2953.86] decanting the package
[2951.64 - 2957.40] because packages can have people's mucus
[2953.86 - 2959.38] and saliva the man especially during flu
[2957.40 - 2962.32] season whoa
[2959.38 - 2964.78] traces a fecal matter skin flakes or any
[2962.32 - 2968.50] other bodily fluid fluids can be on the
[2964.78 - 2972.04] packages if you like if they did DNA
[2968.50 - 2975.28] testing on your packages when they come
[2972.04 - 2978.70] in the mail or whatever delivery they
[2975.28 - 2980.56] did DNA testing on there
[2978.70 - 2981.46] they got to find DNA of all kinds of
[2980.56 - 2984.34] stuff
[2981.46 - 2986.74] Amanda says yes I had a client of mine
[2984.34 - 2988.78] who worked for UPS delivery drivers pee
[2986.74 - 2990.04] in jars in the car no bathroom breaks
[2988.78 - 2992.74] the reason why they pee and I'm not
[2990.04 - 2996.22] blaming them for peeing in the car in
[2992.74 - 2998.50] the jar but it's true I've seen that out
[2996.22 - 3000.72] there too now I'm not blaming anybody
[2998.50 - 3002.64] for that because I get it if you're
[3000.72 - 3006.18] trying to get packages done
[3002.64 - 3009.44] it's holidays and you gotta pee
[3006.18 - 3009.44] you're gonna pull out a jar
[3010.20 - 3014.10] if you give a package three to five days
[3012.30 - 3015.66] if you can't in your designated area
[3014.10 - 3017.10] there will be lesser chance of being
[3015.66 - 3018.66] exposed you know I mean you could
[3017.10 - 3020.40] whatever
[3018.66 - 3022.50] but wash your hands afterwards whatever
[3020.40 - 3024.30] if you do open your package
[3022.50 - 3026.52] so know that and take precursive
[3024.30 - 3028.38] precautions with your packages learn
[3026.52 - 3030.74] this information
[3028.38 - 3034.32] here's the question right here
[3030.74 - 3036.12] DYI Health says
[3034.32 - 3039.54] okay
[3036.12 - 3042.18] Simone and yet getting or sorry Simone
[3039.54 - 3044.64] and yet people are getting sick he's
[3042.18 - 3047.58] advising that we are aware
[3044.64 - 3050.04] while we're there asking the hygienist
[3047.58 - 3053.30] not to touch other things while they are
[3050.04 - 3053.30] working in your mouth yeah
[3053.40 - 3057.90] beyond all of this awareness about
[3055.38 - 3060.24] exposures and sources you could limit
[3057.90 - 3063.66] the damage a virus can do by making your
[3060.24 - 3066.00] body an inhospitable place for viruses
[3063.66 - 3067.56] how you can limit the other brain
[3066.00 - 3069.96] betrayers in your life I talked about
[3067.56 - 3072.00] that in here you're working on doing an
[3069.96 - 3074.34] exposure shot right here all of it
[3072.00 - 3077.40] anyway
[3074.34 - 3079.80] and there's a quote at the bottom
[3077.40 - 3080.88] there is a greater truth Underneath It
[3079.80 - 3083.40] All
[3080.88 - 3086.34] there are answers to why people feel the
[3083.40 - 3087.78] way they do Anthony William medical
[3086.34 - 3089.94] medium
[3087.78 - 3091.14] all right you guys

[3295.08 - 3299.16] world the onslaught of domestic chemical
[3297.12 - 3301.50] warfare and the pathogens were up
[3299.16 - 3303.48] against I'm on page 516 if you guys want
[3301.50 - 3305.22] to read along
[3303.48 - 3308.16] they're in our schools it's in our
[3305.22 - 3311.16] institutions our society today has
[3308.16 - 3313.08] reached catechismic proportions
[3311.16 - 3315.72] you know they do when all the kids go
[3313.08 - 3317.16] back to college before they go back to
[3315.72 - 3319.68] college
[3317.16 - 3322.62] they bomb
[3319.68 - 3326.60] the dorms
[3322.62 - 3329.60] with every single killer
[3326.60 - 3332.70] rodenticides pesticides everything

[3335.64 - 3344.10] bomb all the dorms they're riddled in an
[3340.20 - 3345.96] unbelievable level of insecticide
[3344.10 - 3347.70] when you send your kid off to school
[3345.96 - 3349.26] right
[3347.70 - 3351.06] and these things get collected
[3349.26 - 3353.04] throughout the years when you embark on
[3351.06 - 3354.84] these cleanse options you're using your
[3353.04 - 3356.64] free will and your intention to clean
[3354.84 - 3358.86] and protect the organ that Harbors the

[3387.12 - 3392.46] Enlightenment is not about being
[3389.76 - 3395.40] all-knowing

[3403.98 - 3408.60] is not just about all knowing that's not
[3406.56 - 3409.80] the answer Enlightenment is about having
[3408.60 - 3413.12] control
[3409.80 - 3413.12] and empowerment
[3413.58 - 3417.00] since we don't have control about what
[3415.62 - 3418.50] resides around us in the world because
[3417.00 - 3420.96] you can't control the world you have
[3418.50 - 3423.26] control about how you can protect
[3420.96 - 3423.26] yourself

[3594.66 - 3596.90] can
[3597.00 - 3602.22] all right let's do this
[3600.06 - 3604.08] this is the mm 1500 it's on sale right
[3602.22 - 3606.78] now I call it the medicine machine the
[3604.08 - 3609.18] medicine maker okay
[3606.78 - 3611.46] get the mm-900 too
[3609.18 - 3615.30] they have high compression
[3611.46 - 3617.70] I endorsed these machines for a reason
[3615.30 - 3620.78] because they're incredible they're cold
[3617.70 - 3624.48] pressed masticating juicers
[3620.78 - 3625.80] preserving nutrients but these squeeze
[3624.48 - 3628.32] out
[3625.80 - 3629.10] everything they can and that saves you
[3628.32 - 3632.22] money
[3629.10 - 3634.98] food costs are rising
[3632.22 - 3637.92] and Rising no matter what you're eating
[3634.98 - 3639.30] doesn't matter if it's processed food or
[3637.92 - 3641.58] a vegetable
[3639.30 - 3644.04] food costs are rising
[3641.58 - 3646.14] right but when you're using a medicine
[3644.04 - 3648.06] machine that's saving you money so it
[3646.14 - 3650.28] pays for itself
[3648.06 - 3651.78] it's incredible
[3650.28 - 3654.78] it's because juicers don't squeeze
[3651.78 - 3658.08] enough juice out and then after two
[3654.78 - 3661.56] years most juicers when they break down
[3658.08 - 3663.96] you can't get parts replaced 15-year
[3661.56 - 3666.54] warranty on the 900 and the 1500
[3663.96 - 3671.04] stinkfronto all right

[3683.46 - 3688.46] it's just really crazy all right so
[3685.50 - 3688.46] let's start with some time
[3688.56 - 3694.26] then knock a little time in here
[3691.68 - 3697.02] by the way Omega has a new support group
[3694.26 - 3700.62] for medical medium people who purchase
[3697.02 - 3705.00] the 1500 or the 900s check it out they
[3700.62 - 3707.46] got a like a phone number an email
[3705.00 - 3711.62] we got a new support group
[3707.46 - 3711.62] so I'm putting about six frigs in here
[3714.42 - 3719.82] we go I got my time in here I posted it
[3718.08 - 3723.54] on telegram by the way
[3719.82 - 3726.92] let's put some Rosemary in here now
[3723.54 - 3726.92] two sprigs of Rosemary
[3730.32 - 3738.12] this is a serious serious exposure shot
[3735.08 - 3740.58] aw in Europe they have trouble sourcing
[3738.12 - 3743.70] green asparagus Depending on time of
[3740.58 - 3746.04] year his white asparagus okay to use for
[3743.70 - 3748.32] sure and now I'm kind of upset because I
[3746.04 - 3750.78] don't know if I put white asparagus in
[3748.32 - 3753.20] the brain saver book but yes it's okay
[3750.78 - 3753.20] to use
[3756.54 - 3760.20] and maybe I did put it in there I don't
[3758.58 - 3763.38] know I just put Garlic in there so I put
[3760.20 - 3765.60] thyme I put Rosemary I put Garlic in
[3763.38 - 3767.82] there now I'm putting in asparagus next
[3765.60 - 3769.32] now these are small
[3767.82 - 3772.14] these ones so I'm going to put in
[3769.32 - 3776.66] probably more than two this is two raw
[3772.14 - 3776.66] medium asparagus Spears right
[3779.16 - 3783.62] but these are like small so I'm gonna
[3781.02 - 3783.62] pop in
[3784.08 - 3787.74] a couple more they're like really tiny
[3786.24 - 3789.96] and dried out
[3787.74 - 3792.12] all right
[3789.96 - 3794.40] next one is two raw brussels sprouts
[3792.12 - 3796.26] really tiny brussels sprouts I've been
[3794.40 - 3798.30] having a hard time getting the big ones
[3796.26 - 3801.90] so I'm probably gonna pop in a little
[3798.30 - 3803.46] bit like that's one right there
[3801.90 - 3807.44] so I'm gonna have to put in four of
[3803.46 - 3807.44] these because two of them are equal
[3807.84 - 3812.10] one more
[3809.78 - 3813.66] because they got brussels sprouts in it
[3812.10 - 3816.66] like this
[3813.66 - 3819.54] these are like that all right
[3816.66 - 3822.54] one or two stalks of celery
[3819.54 - 3824.96] uh one it's a one to two stalks of
[3822.54 - 3824.96] celery
[3825.30 - 3830.36] right
[3827.40 - 3830.36] I'm gonna put two
[3832.38 - 3837.26] pathogen exposure shot is one of my
[3834.96 - 3837.26] favorite
[3837.48 - 3840.50] it really is
[3840.54 - 3843.56] okay here we go
[3846.78 - 3851.46] Valerie says I always have frozen
[3848.88 - 3853.56] asparagus in my freezer can I defrost
[3851.46 - 3855.96] them and use them
[3853.56 - 3858.06] yes you can
[3855.96 - 3861.02] I had to wait for that answer from
[3858.06 - 3861.02] Spirit of compassion
[3861.72 - 3867.18] by the way when you ask a question
[3864.72 - 3869.82] guess who's talking to me
[3867.18 - 3872.84] Spirit of compassion
[3869.82 - 3872.84] that's how it works
[3878.10 - 3881.48] all right shutting this down
[3882.18 - 3887.46] by the way with this juicer
[3884.34 - 3889.38] when the pulp does come out
[3887.46 - 3891.30] this is so dry this time it's like
[3889.38 - 3893.70] coming out like dust
[3891.30 - 3895.92] and that's where the money saved is at
[3893.70 - 3898.08] which is incredible
[3895.92 - 3900.84] it's not like the spinning basket ones
[3898.08 - 3903.84] or the centrifuges and all those
[3900.84 - 3905.88] they just they just Scorch the juice
[3903.84 - 3908.16] because it's scorching literally
[3905.88 - 3909.30] scorching it's brutalizing it's not cold
[3908.16 - 3911.64] pressed
[3909.30 - 3914.48] and on top of it
[3911.64 - 3917.04] it's incredible how dry this comes out
[3914.48 - 3918.66] it's unbelievable so the amount of juice
[3917.04 - 3920.52] that's saved I think is in the profile
[3918.66 - 3922.68] link is the description on the mm-900
[3920.52 - 3924.78] and the mm-1500
[3922.68 - 3927.86] all right I think that moment has come
