[0.48 - 4.72] heavy metal pumped up about it
[3.28 - 7.28] you know
[4.72 - 10.56] heavy metals
[7.28 - 14.08] controls us more than we know
[10.56 - 16.88] toxic heavy metals control our mind
[14.08 - 19.12] i think that's why the industries
[16.88 - 20.72] are even involved with it because they
[19.12 - 23.20] are
[20.72 - 25.28] the more toxic heavy metals that enter
[23.20 - 28.00] our brain
[25.28 - 30.80] the more chances
[28.00 - 32.96] we're gonna screw up we're gonna screw
[30.80 - 32.96] up
[33.76 - 40.08] toxic heavy metals
[36.40 - 40.08] causes more suicides
[40.16 - 45.92] than people would even believe or know
[43.84 - 48.80] heavy metals can create a depression
[45.92 - 51.60] that's so devastating a mysterious
[48.80 - 54.32] depression that's so devastating where
[51.60 - 57.52] you can't seem to see
[54.32 - 58.88] the light on any level
[57.52 - 61.04] where
[58.88 - 63.12] that depression
[61.04 - 67.60] takes over
[63.12 - 67.60] it takes over everything there's no hope
[67.84 - 71.52] there's no
[69.28 - 75.04] light
[71.52 - 75.04] there's no sanctuary
[75.12 - 77.68] there's no
[77.84 - 82.32] anything when you're that severely
[80.24 - 84.40] depressed
[82.32 - 86.80] but yet the toxic heavy metals creating
[84.40 - 90.48] that depression
[86.80 - 90.48] can push somebody to suicide
[90.64 - 95.68] toxic heavy metals
[92.88 - 96.80] really show themselves when an elder
[95.68 - 99.20] gets
[96.80 - 103.60] dementia
[99.20 - 106.08] and you lose touch with that elder
[103.60 - 108.00] that mother that father
[106.08 - 110.00] that grandmother
[108.00 - 111.36] that grandfather
[110.00 - 114.00] that great grandmother that great
[111.36 - 116.24] grandfather
[114.00 - 117.68] you lose touch with that person or that
[116.24 - 119.60] best friend
[117.68 - 122.16] where the best friend is
[119.60 - 125.36] losing their mind
[122.16 - 125.36] toxic heavy metals
[125.44 - 130.48] can devastate lives
[128.40 - 131.92] but yet
[130.48 - 133.84] you don't hear anything really about
[131.92 - 135.44] toxic heavy metals i spent 35 years
[133.84 - 136.40] trying to teach people about toxic heavy
[135.44 - 138.08] metals
[136.40 - 139.84] so they know and now you kind of faintly
[138.08 - 143.28] hear it amongst the
[139.84 - 145.44] alternative health industry right and
[143.28 - 146.16] they all give all the wrong stuff for it
[145.44 - 148.32] like
[146.16 - 149.68] do charcoal by the way is
[148.32 - 152.16] terrifying
[149.68 - 153.04] internally when you take charcoal
[152.16 - 156.16] do
[153.04 - 158.24] uh this do chlorella which doesn't work
[156.16 - 159.44] doesn't remove metals
[158.24 - 161.04] and
[159.44 - 162.96] what happens is that
[161.04 - 165.52] that
[162.96 - 168.00] toxic heavy metals can also change our
[165.52 - 170.56] decisions in life

[182.72 - 188.08] to a university do i go to this
[184.56 - 190.16] university or do i go to that university

[219.84 - 225.80] best is not your fault

[241.12 - 246.88] has toxic heavy metals and that person's
[243.76 - 248.96] just not just agreeable where it's just
[246.88 - 251.52] not working and then the relationship

[276.80 - 280.84] relationship is really difficult
[279.68 - 284.72] really
[280.84 - 286.16] difficult toxic heavy metals

[305.20 - 310.16] condition so that person gets tagged as
[308.08 - 311.68] an anxiety-ridden person amongst their
[310.16 - 313.68] family and friends
[311.68 - 315.28] when it's not even the person's fault

[325.36 - 329.68] tagged that by family members and
[327.36 - 331.76] friends how confusing is that that's not
[329.68 - 334.24] even who the real person is inside toxic
[331.76 - 338.04] heavy metals are creating that
[334.24 - 338.04] toxic heavy metals
[338.16 - 342.88] can alter so many things in our lives
[340.80 - 345.44] around us and shape and change
[342.88 - 345.44] everything

[372.16 - 377.12] and then get hit by a car
[374.40 - 379.12] on the freaking highway
[377.12 - 380.40] toxic heavy metals can make somebody on
[379.12 - 383.20] the highway
[380.40 - 385.04] have a seizure
[383.20 - 388.64] and then four or five people die on the
[385.04 - 390.80] highway because of toxic heavy metals
[388.64 - 394.48] people seizure all the time on highways
[390.80 - 396.48] driving on roadways
[394.48 - 397.76] and run off the road and hit and hit

[402.48 - 407.04] drink
[403.68 - 409.04] and drink get drunk and hit somebody
[407.04 - 411.04] because metals can create a depression
[409.04 - 413.12] and only alcohol seems to soothe it so
[411.04 - 414.48] toxic heavy metals makes somebody
[413.12 - 416.40] addictive and now they're drinking all
[414.48 - 418.40] this alcohol and then they go and kill
[416.40 - 420.32] somebody and guess what it was toxic
[418.40 - 422.64] heavy metals that actually propel that
[420.32 - 424.48] sure the person's at fault sure they did
[422.64 - 426.24] they drank and all that but toxic heavy
[424.48 - 428.80] metals made their life unbearable so
[426.24 - 431.04] they had to do that toxic heavy metals
[428.80 - 434.96] make kids go
[431.04 - 434.96] and snort fentanyl and cocaine
[435.52 - 440.08] toxic heavy metals
[437.76 - 441.68] make people at spring break drink
[440.08 - 443.44] themselves to death and there's always
[441.68 - 445.60] that one person that over drinks and
[443.44 - 448.16] they get uh poisoning and their parents
[445.60 - 449.68] get a phone call from the morgue and the
[448.16 - 452.48] morgue is talking to the parents saying
[449.68 - 454.96] i'm sorry mr smith i'm sorry mrs smith
[452.48 - 458.96] but your 19 year old daughter
[454.96 - 458.96] got alcohol poisoning in his dead
[459.76 - 464.64] toxic heavy metals
[462.72 - 467.12] creates a lot of problems including
[464.64 - 469.76] madness
[467.12 - 471.36] madness
[469.76 - 473.76] to the point where
[471.36 - 475.84] terrible crimes are committed it takes
[473.76 - 477.76] also a bad person don't get me wrong but
[475.84 - 481.44] when you have toxic heavy metals in a
[477.76 - 484.16] bad person that's when it goes really
[481.44 - 484.16] downhill
[484.64 - 488.32] you put toxic heavy metals in a good
[486.56 - 490.00] person you'll get bad decisions and
[488.32 - 491.52] wrong decisions and you'll get all kinds
[490.00 - 493.60] of issues and all kinds of symptoms and
[491.52 - 496.08] conditions and confusion amongst friends
[493.60 - 498.64] and family around them making their life
[496.08 - 500.56] difficult making the person suffering
[498.64 - 503.36] difficult but if you stick toxic heavy
[500.56 - 505.84] metals in a madman
[503.36 - 508.48] then a war or something can happen you
[505.84 - 511.60] stick toxic heavy metals in someone
[508.48 - 514.00] who's just already batshit crazy and you
[511.60 - 516.64] put metals in them it only compiles it
[514.00 - 518.32] and makes it worse right
[516.64 - 519.92] you stick toxic heavy metals in a
[518.32 - 521.92] surgeon they're going to be extra
[519.92 - 524.08] tremoring when they're cutting you open
[521.92 - 525.92] okay but they don't want to retire
[524.08 - 527.68] because they can't retire because they
[525.92 - 529.92] need the money because surgeons still
[527.68 - 531.44] have to work for a living so as they're
[529.92 - 532.96] shaking a little bit and they're on all
[531.44 - 534.72] their caffeine to control it and their
[532.96 - 536.16] medications to control it the surgeon's
[534.72 - 538.16] working on you and they got a tremor
[536.16 - 539.84] condition because the toxic heavy metals
[538.16 - 541.60] toxic heavy metals can change the
[539.84 - 543.84] outcomes of people who are getting
[541.60 - 545.76] surgeries done by doctors that got toxic
[543.84 - 547.36] heavy metals inside of them toxic heavy
[545.76 - 548.64] metals can change the outcome of all
[547.36 - 550.40] everybody's lives for all these
[548.64 - 553.52] different reasons
[550.40 - 553.52] toxic heavy metals
[554.64 - 558.80] can make it
[556.32 - 561.04] where critical mistakes are made all the
[558.80 - 562.96] time
[561.04 - 564.64] so
[562.96 - 566.08] is it important

[651.28 - 655.52] something as good as what they did
[653.68 - 658.00] because for some reason
[655.52 - 660.16] they're they they have the capacity to
[658.00 - 661.60] fight for it i don't know if i have that
[660.16 - 663.36] strength to fight for what they've done
[661.60 - 665.44] the fight to make actually this stuff
[663.36 - 667.68] the cleanest stuff on the planet
[665.44 - 670.24] i mean of course i would fight but man
[667.68 - 671.92] that's what i love about this stuff
[670.24 - 674.32] but if this company ever changes what
[671.92 - 675.52] they're doing boom they're gone they
[674.32 - 677.12] change what they're doing with their
[675.52 - 678.72] products out of here i don't wanna i
[677.12 - 680.72] don't you know what i mean
[678.72 - 682.72] but anyway incredible stuff right now
[680.72 - 684.08] it's the best stuff out there and they
[682.72 - 684.96] made promises that they're not gonna
[684.08 - 686.64] change
[684.96 - 689.12] so you guys we're on tick tock right now
[686.64 - 690.80] we're live there there's a question on
[689.12 - 692.72] tick tock what's the difference between
[690.80 - 694.40] blueberries and wild blueberries good
[692.72 - 695.76] question you guys so what's the
[694.40 - 697.28] difference between blueberries and wild
[695.76 - 699.20] blueberries okay
[697.28 - 702.88] a blueberry
[699.20 - 704.64] is a cultivated fruit that still has
[702.88 - 707.20] wonderful nutrients and some
[704.64 - 709.60] antioxidants i love regular blueberries
[707.20 - 711.68] if i see a pint of regular blueberries
[709.60 - 713.60] i'll eat them absolutely they're good
[711.68 - 717.28] for you they are
[713.60 - 719.68] they're related they're related to its
[717.28 - 722.08] cousin which is the real blueberry like
[719.68 - 725.44] the wild blueberry right the wild
[722.08 - 726.72] blueberry is a wild food that means that
[725.44 - 728.88] the difference is when you're dealing
[726.72 - 730.56] with the wild food is is remarkable the
[728.88 - 734.24] antioxidants are off the chart they're
[730.56 - 736.56] much higher anthocyanins much stronger
[734.24 - 739.20] right that's just one thing the other
[736.56 - 740.72] thing is adaptive
[739.20 - 743.20] adaptive
[740.72 - 746.24] you can burn the wild the blueberries
[743.20 - 748.96] down to the ground and they'll come back
[746.24 - 751.60] if you go and torch the cultivated
[748.96 - 753.44] blueberry down to the ground
[751.60 - 755.20] you see nothing
[753.44 - 757.52] you see nothing come back
[755.20 - 759.52] nothing comes back
[757.52 - 761.28] and that's one of the big things right
[759.52 - 762.88] there what that means is the wild
[761.28 - 765.12] blueberry's got
[762.88 - 768.32] thousands and thousands of years of
[765.12 - 770.40] information in it to survive to beat out

[803.28 - 808.08] and i hope the angels are watching as
[805.20 - 811.04] well from above we're live on getter
[808.08 - 812.24] one more i actually forgot
[811.04 - 813.92] so you guys we're in the heavy metal
[812.24 - 815.76] detox cleanse challenge right now we're
[813.92 - 818.08] day two this is exciting i'm making the
[815.76 - 819.76] heavy metal detox smoothie i'm gonna run
[818.08 - 821.44] some celery really quick through here i
[819.76 - 824.00] got cilantro right there which is
[821.44 - 825.60] exciting so we're gonna have some fun so
[824.00 - 829.28] this is gonna be a great time we're
[825.60 - 831.28] gonna talk about mental illness
[829.28 - 832.56] we're going to talk about anxiety
[831.28 - 834.32] depression a little bit of that we'll
[832.56 - 836.00] talk about the vagus nerve too and
[834.32 - 836.88] everything else we can so how do we do
[836.00 - 838.96] this
[836.88 - 841.60] how do we actually do this
[838.96 - 844.48] we take a lemon
[841.60 - 845.76] if you can only do one part of this
[844.48 - 848.24] cleanse
[845.76 - 850.40] you're not gonna get metals out
[848.24 - 851.84] if you just do the lemon water but
[850.40 - 853.60] you're gonna flush your liver in the
[851.84 - 855.92] morning which is really exciting unless
[853.60 - 858.64] you all you do it like a ham turkey
[855.92 - 859.92] bacon sausage breakfast egg breakfast
[858.64 - 861.52] you do that then you're probably not
[859.92 - 863.60] gonna flush much at all out of your
[861.52 - 865.52] liver but if you start out with lemon
[863.60 - 868.56] water first thing and it's all you do
[865.52 - 871.92] you made a move man in your life you did
[868.56 - 873.60] you made a big move right
[871.92 - 874.80] so cut open the lemon
[873.60 - 876.08] and i'm going to squeeze some lemon in
[874.80 - 879.12] here right there
[876.08 - 880.24] this is really hard to do
[879.12 - 882.16] right
[880.24 - 884.96] it's not hard to do
[882.16 - 887.92] i'm being
[884.96 - 890.96] hardly sarcastic i guess
[887.92 - 890.96] i don't know what i'm being
[891.04 - 894.48] done
[892.16 - 896.24] that's step one right there you did it
[894.48 - 898.56] even if it's just this at least you're
[896.24 - 900.24] gonna get a little hydration and a flush
[898.56 - 902.80] right in the morning especially if you
[900.24 - 905.36] don't do any heavy fats in the morning
[902.80 - 908.40] too so if you just do the lemon water in
[905.36 - 911.20] the morning life starts to change
[908.40 - 914.24] don't do hot lemon i know i did this
[911.20 - 916.24] yesterday where no hot water no hot
[914.24 - 918.88] you don't want to kill the lemon you
[916.24 - 920.72] don't want to kill the
[918.88 - 921.92] michelle l that's the best word for it
[920.72 - 924.64] exactly
[921.92 - 925.44] she's just yeah totally
[924.64 - 927.60] so
[925.44 - 930.16] you don't want to kill the living
[927.60 - 932.64] phytochemical compounds inside
[930.16 - 934.72] the lemon the lemon juice you don't want
[932.64 - 936.64] to destroy that the living enzymes the
[934.72 - 940.24] living water inside when a lemon's on a
[936.64 - 942.32] tree or in the basket or at home in the
[940.24 - 944.24] basket of the grocery store or at home
[942.32 - 947.28] on your cutting board your lemon's still
[944.24 - 949.68] alive it has it hasn't died
[947.28 - 952.40] so when you do the hot water you kill
[949.68 - 953.76] the lemon juice you kill it right so you
[952.40 - 956.32] don't want to do that in order for that
[953.76 - 959.44] hydration to happen it has to be raw
[956.32 - 962.48] lemon juice you put it in hot water you
[959.44 - 964.96] have cooked lemon juice which is fine if
[962.48 - 966.96] you want a hot lemon tea so a little bit
[964.96 - 968.72] of lemon balm tea you want some honey
[966.96 - 970.24] you want some ginger tea you want to
[968.72 - 972.16] squeeze lemon in there but it's doing a
[970.24 - 975.44] different thing this is different here

[1043.20 - 1046.80] can start your cleanse someday
[1045.12 - 1048.48] very important
[1046.80 - 1051.04] and you can read the details of the
[1048.48 - 1052.48] cleanse in here a lot of information
[1051.04 - 1054.40] that can be answered
[1052.48 - 1058.80] so make sure you guys get cleansed to
[1054.40 - 1058.80] heal it's so critical it really is
[1059.52 - 1063.76] that's what you need there the next
[1060.80 - 1066.32] thing you need is spirulina right do you
[1063.76 - 1067.68] have a spirulina that's the one i like
[1066.32 - 1069.04] that's the best one right there so
[1067.68 - 1071.12] that's the vimorcy you'll see the little
[1069.04 - 1073.28] vimergy label right there
[1071.12 - 1075.60] there it is right there
[1073.28 - 1076.80] so that's the vimorji right see if i can
[1075.60 - 1078.40] get this straight how do you get this
[1076.80 - 1079.44] straight
[1078.40 - 1081.36] what
[1079.44 - 1082.96] what there we are
[1081.36 - 1085.04] that was that was weird that was
[1082.96 - 1087.04] psychedelic i couldn't tell you right
[1085.04 - 1088.40] now that was really psychedelic
[1087.04 - 1090.56] all right
[1088.40 - 1093.36] so that's the vimercy powder right there
[1090.56 - 1095.68] so you need that now if you get another
[1093.36 - 1096.96] if you get another spirulina
[1095.68 - 1100.40] right
[1096.96 - 1102.96] keep in mind it may not be as strong and
[1100.40 - 1104.88] may not be as good it may not be as
[1102.96 - 1108.16] clean and if that's the case you're
[1104.88 - 1109.52] still using something and so that's good
[1108.16 - 1111.76] okay
[1109.52 - 1113.12] but that's the best one
[1111.76 - 1114.88] it's barley grass juice powder let's see
[1113.12 - 1117.12] if we get a close up on that one too so
[1114.88 - 1118.64] the barley grass juice powder
[1117.12 - 1119.92] right there you go
[1118.64 - 1123.04] so that's the emergency barley cream now
[1119.92 - 1126.32] this is important to know barley grass
[1123.04 - 1127.84] don't make a mistake and get just barley
[1126.32 - 1129.92] grass
[1127.84 - 1131.76] don't do that you want barley grass
[1129.92 - 1134.16] juice powder because here's how it works
[1131.76 - 1135.68] barley grass you're just gonna poop out
[1134.16 - 1136.64] you're just gonna poop the barley grass
[1135.68 - 1137.68] out
[1136.64 - 1138.88] that's all
[1137.68 - 1139.60] it's just going to come out the other
[1138.88 - 1141.68] end
[1139.60 - 1143.76] that's what it's going to do
[1141.68 - 1145.20] barley grass juice powder you're not
[1143.76 - 1148.16] going to poop out
[1145.20 - 1150.48] sure you might poop some out naturally
[1148.16 - 1151.84] depending on how fast you poop after you
[1150.48 - 1153.52] eat and stuff everybody's got a
[1151.84 - 1155.92] different time span because of
[1153.52 - 1157.52] peristaltic action issues and stuff but
[1155.92 - 1160.24] the barley grass juice powder will
[1157.52 - 1162.40] absorb and assimilate that will absorb
[1160.24 - 1165.04] and assimilate and it'll get into your
[1162.40 - 1167.36] bloodstream and to your brain is what

[1410.32 - 1413.12] have any sugar don't have any sugar and
[1411.76 - 1416.08] stuff like that when they don't even get
[1413.12 - 1417.36] it a banana is anti-viral
[1416.08 - 1418.24] they don't even know why anybody's sick
[1417.36 - 1419.68] and they're telling you not to eat a
[1418.24 - 1422.40] banana
[1419.68 - 1424.80] bananas have antiviral compounds in them
[1422.40 - 1426.56] anti-pathogen compounds anti-mold
[1424.80 - 1428.48] anti-yeast anti-everything meanwhile the
[1426.56 - 1431.60] alternative industry has been putting
[1428.48 - 1433.60] people into banana fare for years now
[1431.60 - 1435.04] right i did a podcast episode on it
[1433.60 - 1436.32] right medical media podcast apple
[1435.04 - 1437.52] podcast
[1436.32 - 1440.24] they try to put people in fear of
[1437.52 - 1441.28] bananas like scared to death of a banana
[1440.24 - 1443.76] right
[1441.28 - 1446.24] and how ridiculous is that
[1443.76 - 1448.16] they're children with autism and adhd
[1446.24 - 1450.16] the doctors like don't eat bananas don't
[1448.16 - 1452.72] give the kids sugar
[1450.16 - 1453.92] it's it's psycho
[1452.72 - 1456.16] meanwhile
[1453.92 - 1458.32] your brain runs on sugar did you know
[1456.16 - 1460.72] that if your brain doesn't receive sugar
[1458.32 - 1463.04] within 10 seconds guess what it dies
[1460.72 - 1464.72] it dies
[1463.04 - 1466.48] the blood going to your brain is
[1464.72 - 1468.24] traveling with glucose in it if you
[1466.48 - 1469.92] don't get glucose to your brain why do
[1468.24 - 1471.84] you think the old keto diet used to kill
[1469.92 - 1473.28] people all the time you guys don't know
[1471.84 - 1474.80] many well actually some of you guys
[1473.28 - 1476.08] might have experienced watching this or
[1474.80 - 1477.44] gone through it so i'm actually wrong
[1476.08 - 1479.20] about that spirit just said you're wrong
[1477.44 - 1480.56] there are some people that actually are
[1479.20 - 1482.32] in the medical medium community that did
[1480.56 - 1484.32] the old keto diet in the old way and
[1482.32 - 1487.12] almost died
[1484.32 - 1489.36] i love when spirit uh corrects me
[1487.12 - 1491.20] it's like a school teacher it's like a
[1489.36 - 1492.32] school teacher on my butt
[1491.20 - 1495.28] every time
[1492.32 - 1497.04] anyway so the whole point is
[1495.28 - 1498.56] is that we need sugar to the brain so
[1497.04 - 1500.72] now here's how the heavy metal detox
[1498.56 - 1502.96] smoothie works it works
[1500.72 - 1505.44] where there's glucose to travel a lot of
[1502.96 - 1506.96] these nutrients
[1505.44 - 1508.88] to the brain
[1506.96 - 1511.52] to get the metals out that's where i was
[1508.88 - 1513.52] going the whole point and and so where
[1511.52 - 1517.04] i'm heading here is why do we do the
[1513.52 - 1517.04] heavy metal detox movie
[1517.12 - 1520.80] we do it because we're trying to get
[1519.04 - 1522.08] metals out of the brain and glucose is a
[1520.80 - 1524.00] big part of it and we make sure there's
[1522.08 - 1526.24] ample glucose inside the smoothies what
[1524.00 - 1529.24] we do all right i'm gonna put the banana
[1526.24 - 1529.24] down
[1530.08 - 1533.52] let's make some celery juice really
[1531.36 - 1533.52] quick
[1534.48 - 1537.84] all right
[1536.48 - 1539.92] so i'm gonna run some celery through
[1537.84 - 1542.64] here it's part of the cleanse if you
[1539.92 - 1545.12] don't have a juicer use a blender then
[1542.64 - 1547.60] strain it with a cheesecloth or a milk
[1545.12 - 1549.28] nut milk bag and that's fine you can do
[1547.60 - 1550.72] that you know
[1549.28 - 1552.08] this is amazing right here this thing is
[1550.72 - 1555.08] running good
[1552.08 - 1555.08] right
[1558.24 - 1560.80] okay
[1559.20 - 1562.56] you guys get the book check out the
[1560.80 - 1564.96] check out the details in the book under
[1562.56 - 1568.24] the heavy metal cleanse okay don't add
[1564.96 - 1568.24] water to your celery
[1568.32 - 1573.44] i'm gonna run some celery through here
[1570.80 - 1575.68] [Applause]
[1573.44 - 1575.68] right
[1576.08 - 1580.24] 16 ounces if you need to do less do
[1578.48 - 1581.60] eight ounces if you need to do less
[1580.24 - 1584.24] because you're sensitive because you're
[1581.60 - 1586.56] really toxic do four ounces if you're
[1584.24 - 1589.36] really toxic do four ounces then work
[1586.56 - 1591.20] your way up same thing you want to do
[1589.36 - 1595.20] with the heavy metal detox smoothie it's
[1591.20 - 1596.96] very gentle all of the gentle
[1595.20 - 1598.48] what i love about the heavy metal detox
[1596.96 - 1601.76] smoothie and the heavy metal detox
[1598.48 - 1604.32] cleanse it's gentle
[1601.76 - 1607.12] there's radical nutty people and
[1604.32 - 1609.52] alternative medicine in the cultish
[1607.12 - 1611.04] alternative medicine out there that all
[1609.52 - 1615.36] said well like this is how you get
[1611.04 - 1617.52] metals out they make you so sick
[1615.36 - 1619.28] people get so sick
[1617.52 - 1620.64] sometimes it ruins their lives they'll
[1619.28 - 1622.40] go and they'll get these dangerous
[1620.64 - 1623.92] chelation treatments
[1622.40 - 1627.84] and they'll just they're
[1623.92 - 1627.84] damaged for years
[1632.72 - 1637.20] lydia says facebook stops
[1635.68 - 1638.88] yeah that's whoa
[1637.20 - 1642.56] they're just they just yeah we're
[1638.88 - 1642.56] censored on facebook for some reason
[1644.00 - 1646.96] because i'm talking about bananas
[1645.52 - 1648.16] somebody in facebook probably doesn't
[1646.96 - 1649.76] like the bananas because they've been
[1648.16 - 1652.56] taught not to be bananas so they're like
[1649.76 - 1654.16] oh i'll fix that medical medium let's
[1652.56 - 1658.16] hit this button a couple more times and
[1654.16 - 1658.16] knock off another bunch of people
[1659.04 - 1663.92] just guess it
[1661.52 - 1663.92] all right
[1665.20 - 1668.72] so when it comes down to the heavy metal
[1666.96 - 1670.80] detox smoothie it's really gentle it's
[1668.72 - 1672.00] critical that it's that gentle sarah
[1670.80 - 1675.68] says i just ordered the spare of the end
[1672.00 - 1675.68] of barley grass juice powder amazing
[1676.64 - 1679.68] amazing
[1678.24 - 1682.48] making a little bit of solar juice so
[1679.68 - 1685.08] celery juice neutralizes the toxins
[1682.48 - 1687.20] and neutralizes metals it helps to
[1685.08 - 1691.44] dislodge that
[1687.20 - 1694.80] it creates a dislodging of purging now
[1691.44 - 1697.12] celery juice does not bind onto metals
[1694.80 - 1698.72] specifically and carry them completely
[1697.12 - 1701.12] out of the body that's not celery
[1698.72 - 1704.64] juice's role celery juice's role is to
[1701.12 - 1704.64] neutralize metals
[1704.72 - 1709.52] lower their strength and their toxic
[1708.00 - 1712.80] nature
[1709.52 - 1714.32] celery juice does bind on to metal
[1712.80 - 1716.64] byproduct
[1714.32 - 1720.32] that makes us sick that gives us a lot
[1716.64 - 1723.32] of metal conditions and symptoms and
[1720.32 - 1723.32] diseases
[1725.52 - 1729.36] people get better just drinking celery
[1727.68 - 1730.72] juice with the brain fog i hear it all
[1729.36 - 1732.16] the time it's like oh my god my brain
[1730.72 - 1734.88] fog so much better i'm doing celery
[1732.16 - 1737.36] juice and part of that reason is because
[1734.88 - 1739.12] the celery juice is removing
[1737.36 - 1741.12] toxic heavy metal
[1739.12 - 1744.00] by-product
[1741.12 - 1744.00] by-product
[1744.72 - 1750.24] that's different than the metal itself
[1747.20 - 1752.16] but it's byproducts so celery is already
[1750.24 - 1754.80] helping everybody with their metal
[1752.16 - 1757.76] problems every single day
[1754.80 - 1757.76] that's what's incredible
[1758.88 - 1763.52] michelle l says it's a team effort
[1760.96 - 1765.60] indeed it is the celery juice acts as
[1763.52 - 1768.80] part of that as part of that team member
[1765.60 - 1768.80] so it's really important
[1775.92 - 1779.68] now listen some people have more toxic
[1777.76 - 1781.76] heavy metals than others some people
[1779.68 - 1784.24] have them deeper in the brain
[1781.76 - 1787.44] keep that in mind some people have more
[1784.24 - 1789.76] metals different kinds of metals
[1787.44 - 1792.56] all that's important to know you
[1789.76 - 1794.48] somebody else may not be doing anything
[1792.56 - 1797.44] but the heavy metal detox smoothie and
[1794.48 - 1799.12] they have a really bad case of metals
[1797.44 - 1800.16] and they're not reading the details in
[1799.12 - 1801.36] the book
[1800.16 - 1803.68] about like
[1801.36 - 1805.20] adding additional customizing protocols
[1803.68 - 1808.40] and stuff
[1805.20 - 1810.08] customizing is critical and that's what
[1808.40 - 1812.08] medical medium information it's about
[1810.08 - 1814.64] it's not one size fits all because
[1812.08 - 1816.64] everyone has a different level of metals
[1814.64 - 1818.08] and different circumstances with with
[1816.64 - 1822.36] what they're dealing with in their
[1818.08 - 1822.36] symptoms and conditions right
[1822.48 - 1826.43] so there we go got some celery juice
[1824.96 - 1827.68] right here
[1826.43 - 1829.36] [Music]
[1827.68 - 1831.52] hey w can you let us know how long it
[1829.36 - 1833.04] can take to get metals out exactly what
[1831.52 - 1834.84] i'm talking about right now yo fruits
[1833.04 - 1837.36] and
[1834.84 - 1839.20] vegetables that's a cool handle eo
[1837.36 - 1841.28] fruits and vegetables so yeah so what
[1839.20 - 1842.88] happens is that
[1841.28 - 1843.92] a lot of people may have a lot of a lot
[1842.88 - 1846.24] of different metals so let's go into
[1843.92 - 1848.72] that a little bit okay so i got my brain
[1846.24 - 1848.72] over here
[1848.96 - 1852.16] one of my brains
[1850.64 - 1854.08] right
[1852.16 - 1855.44] somebody may have metals in the left
[1854.08 - 1856.88] left hemisphere and not the right
[1855.44 - 1858.72] hemisphere somebody may have them in the
[1856.88 - 1860.24] left and right uh hemisphere somebody
[1858.72 - 1861.68] may have them in the frontal lobe
[1860.24 - 1863.52] everybody's got a different situation
[1861.68 - 1864.40] with metals more people might have more
[1863.52 - 1865.68] metal
[1864.40 - 1867.68] other people might have more metal in
[1865.68 - 1869.68] the brain stem
[1867.68 - 1871.12] a lot of different situations
[1869.68 - 1873.28] someone might have metals in the
[1871.12 - 1875.76] emotional center of the brain
[1873.28 - 1877.68] keep that in mind so we can have metals
[1875.76 - 1879.84] in different areas some people may have
[1877.68 - 1881.36] more mercury more leads somebody
[1879.84 - 1883.04] somebody might have more aluminum more
[1881.36 - 1884.72] copper somebody might have only copper
[1883.04 - 1887.04] and a little bit of aluminum somebody
[1884.72 - 1889.36] might have aluminum calcium
[1887.04 - 1890.72] the bad one industrialized calcium
[1889.36 - 1893.60] copper
[1890.72 - 1896.16] lead arsenic cadmium and nickel somebody
[1893.60 - 1899.12] might have just a ton of mercury
[1896.16 - 1900.48] not literally a ton figuratively but a
[1899.12 - 1902.48] lot of mercury
[1900.48 - 1904.84] so that's the difference right there
[1902.48 - 1907.36] okay and that's what changes
[1904.84 - 1910.96] everything all right
[1907.36 - 1910.96] so keep that in mind i see aj
[1912.88 - 1917.40] all right we got some celery juice right
[1914.40 - 1917.40] here
[1929.36 - 1933.28] you guys we got some celery right here
[1931.92 - 1935.28] i'm gonna pour it from the corner this
[1933.28 - 1937.44] time see when i'm back here my juicer's
[1935.28 - 1940.56] in the way so i actually have to
[1937.44 - 1942.96] pour it from the corner
[1940.56 - 1942.96] smart
[1944.72 - 1949.20] just laughing at myself
[1946.64 - 1952.16] like usual all right so we got some
[1949.20 - 1952.16] celery juice right here
[1952.96 - 1958.88] how do you test which heavy metals you
[1955.12 - 1960.96] have good question let's answer it
[1958.88 - 1963.76] let me just cap this off you guys right
[1960.96 - 1967.52] here
[1963.76 - 1967.52] yep thank you for asking that question
[1967.92 - 1972.32] i'm going to move this down here just
[1969.44 - 1972.32] give me one second
[1974.84 - 1979.44] nice how do you test what metals that
[1977.84 - 1981.44] you like what metals you have here's
[1979.44 - 1983.84] here's how it works to begin with metals
[1981.44 - 1985.36] sit inside organs so you can't test for
[1983.84 - 1987.68] all the metals and you can't test for
[1985.36 - 1989.28] every metal in the body it doesn't work
[1987.68 - 1991.12] like that so that's important to know
[1989.28 - 1992.64] right so
[1991.12 - 1994.72] if you guys just came on here make sure
[1992.64 - 1996.64] you have cleanse the heel when you can
[1994.72 - 1999.60] get it free at the library
[1996.64 - 2001.60] um amazon.com 51 off the heavy metal
[1999.60 - 2003.44] detox cleanse is in here or day two of
[2001.60 - 2004.96] the heavy metal detox cleanse challenge
[2003.44 - 2007.20] so just so you know what we're doing
[2004.96 - 2007.20] right
[2009.44 - 2014.32] so when you get a heavy metal detox test
[2012.24 - 2016.96] they're testing a quick snapshot of time
[2014.32 - 2019.68] they're testing your blood a quick
[2016.96 - 2021.52] snapshot of time is what they're doing
[2019.68 - 2024.96] they're getting some blood in the moment
[2021.52 - 2027.36] at that part of the body right
[2024.96 - 2029.20] so when you're getting your blood tested
[2027.36 - 2031.36] okay
[2029.20 - 2033.04] if you ever have an ink have you ever
[2031.36 - 2034.72] had a tattoo just assume you got toxic
[2033.04 - 2036.24] heavy metals in the organs
[2034.72 - 2037.52] because that's what the ink is it's got
[2036.24 - 2039.28] all these metals in it we'll talk about
[2037.52 - 2042.00] that in a second again
[2039.28 - 2044.00] but if you had your blood tested
[2042.00 - 2046.88] for toxic heavy metals it's a snapshot
[2044.00 - 2048.48] it's just a window meanwhile metals can
[2046.88 - 2050.00] build up in your organs for years but
[2048.48 - 2051.60] you don't see it in the blood test so
[2050.00 - 2053.12] when they do take a blood test and they
[2051.60 - 2054.40] see some that's just what's floating
[2053.12 - 2055.84] around in their bloodstream in that
[2054.40 - 2058.00] moment
[2055.84 - 2060.88] they can't go and do a brain biopsy on
[2058.00 - 2064.16] you so they can't be like hold on mister
[2060.88 - 2064.16] hold on mr wilson
[2064.40 - 2066.96] we're going to see how many we're going
[2065.68 - 2068.96] to knock you out under general
[2066.96 - 2070.96] anesthesia
[2068.96 - 2073.20] and uh
[2070.96 - 2074.96] we're going to do a brain biopsy on you
[2073.20 - 2076.88] right now don't worry we're gonna knock
[2074.96 - 2078.72] you out okay we knocked you out you're
[2076.88 - 2080.48] you're under anesthesia now let's just
[2078.72 - 2081.60] cut open the skull and let's do a brain
[2080.48 - 2083.04] biopsy
[2081.60 - 2084.64] and we're gonna get that biopsy and now
[2083.04 - 2086.16] we're gonna study that on how many heavy
[2084.64 - 2087.76] metals you are you have and here's the
[2086.16 - 2090.48] problem even with that so even if they
[2087.76 - 2090.48] could do that
[2090.56 - 2094.32] they're going to pick a spot in the
[2091.92 - 2096.40] brain that the metals aren't even in
[2094.32 - 2098.80] your metals can be located anywhere they
[2096.40 - 2100.80] can be anywhere they can they can biopsy
[2098.80 - 2102.96] the wrong side they can
[2100.80 - 2104.72] the metals can be anywhere inside the
[2102.96 - 2106.16] brain they can't go and dissect your
[2104.72 - 2107.52] brain while you're under anesthesia
[2106.16 - 2109.12] you'll never come out of it if they
[2107.52 - 2110.96] dissect your brain and cut everything
[2109.12 - 2112.40] open and look for it it's not going to
[2110.96 - 2113.20] happen
[2112.40 - 2116.08] so
[2113.20 - 2118.16] it's impossible to measure metals is
[2116.08 - 2119.04] what i'm trying to say unless you drank
[2118.16 - 2122.32] a
[2119.04 - 2124.48] a gallon of lead
[2122.32 - 2126.32] lead water
[2124.48 - 2128.24] and you had lead poisoning and you
[2126.32 - 2129.84] literally were going into neurological
[2128.24 - 2131.36] seizure and coma and you're in the
[2129.84 - 2132.48] hospital they know you have lead
[2131.36 - 2134.16] poisoning
[2132.48 - 2135.68] they can test out lead really high in
[2134.16 - 2137.92] your bloodstream because you just got
[2135.68 - 2140.80] the lead but you but other than that if
[2137.92 - 2142.80] we don't have that kind of exposure
[2140.80 - 2145.68] then what we're dealing with is we never
[2142.80 - 2147.52] know there is no analysis or test that
[2145.68 - 2149.60] could determine how many metals we have
[2147.52 - 2151.52] in every organ inside our brain inside
[2149.60 - 2153.12] our liver or anything else
[2151.52 - 2155.36] you start getting alzheimer's you got
[2153.12 - 2157.68] metals really bad
[2155.36 - 2159.68] a hair analysis doesn't do it do the
[2157.68 - 2161.68] trick either
[2159.68 - 2163.92] a hair analysis is not going to tell you
[2161.68 - 2165.44] how much lead you have in your liver how
[2163.92 - 2166.80] much mercury you have in different parts
[2165.44 - 2168.88] of your brain how many how much
[2166.80 - 2171.52] mercury's in your spleen how much
[2168.88 - 2173.92] aluminum's in your pancreas how much
[2171.52 - 2175.68] aluminum is underneath your derma how
[2173.92 - 2178.72] like nothing like you're not gonna get
[2175.68 - 2178.72] any answers for that
[2181.44 - 2184.88] i'm just gonna since i brought this up
[2183.52 - 2186.32] i'm not telling you to remove your
[2184.88 - 2187.92] tattoos i saw a bunch of comments
[2186.32 - 2190.48] yesterday and everybody's like oh crap i
[2187.92 - 2192.40] gotta get my tattoos removed
[2190.48 - 2194.80] you don't have to get your tattoos
[2192.40 - 2197.28] removed you don't you just have to be
[2194.80 - 2199.12] proactive on catching the metals as they
[2197.28 - 2200.48] leave your derma into your bloodstream
[2199.12 - 2202.08] because for the rest of your life
[2200.48 - 2203.84] they're gonna leave your derma into the
[2202.08 - 2205.12] bloodstream they're gonna soak down down
[2203.84 - 2207.20] through
[2205.12 - 2209.36] and if you go and get a tattoo today and
[2207.20 - 2211.28] you hop into like a hipster
[2209.36 - 2212.96] tattoo place
[2211.28 - 2215.20] you know it's real like like totally you
[2212.96 - 2216.88] know i don't know hollywood boulevard
[2215.20 - 2218.32] hipster tattoo place that you've been
[2216.88 - 2220.80] recommended to you because they got the
[2218.32 - 2222.56] best vegan non-cruelty ink
[2220.80 - 2224.32] you're just completely just you know
[2222.56 - 2226.32] you're you're it's distant for
[2224.32 - 2227.28] misinformation because there's no such
[2226.32 - 2229.36] thing
[2227.28 - 2231.60] you have to have metal in the ink to get
[2229.36 - 2232.64] that color to pop so light hits it and
[2231.60 - 2235.28] it pops
[2232.64 - 2237.36] you have to have that christie seriously
[2235.28 - 2238.64] i'm serious there is none
[2237.36 - 2240.64] so
[2238.64 - 2243.76] what happens is that you have to have
[2240.64 - 2245.68] it's all metal it's all metal
[2243.76 - 2247.92] it's all minerals
[2245.68 - 2249.92] but not the good kind so your ink is
[2247.92 - 2252.32] filled with all metal
[2249.92 - 2254.80] yeah i don't care who says we had ours
[2252.32 - 2257.60] tested there's no metals in it no no no
[2254.80 - 2259.68] no both i call bs
[2257.60 - 2261.68] i call bs
[2259.68 - 2262.96] industrialized metals and they're
[2261.68 - 2265.92] they're they're
[2262.96 - 2269.60] it's fine particles it's nano it's
[2265.92 - 2272.64] actually under it's like septo
[2269.60 - 2274.08] it's like septo right
[2272.64 - 2276.64] so you need to know that
[2274.08 - 2278.32] that metal is like septo size
[2276.64 - 2281.36] so that's what it is that's an entirely
[2278.32 - 2283.92] different size right that's crazy small
[2281.36 - 2285.68] so what it is is that's what is inside
[2283.92 - 2287.68] the ink and that's what makes the light
[2285.68 - 2290.00] hit it so you hit the the light goes and
[2287.68 - 2291.84] hits your skin and then it pops so you
[2290.00 - 2294.24] guys will give you a rundown now and
[2291.84 - 2295.12] everything
[2294.24 - 2296.40] all right

[2301.52 - 2306.00] minutes going to 16 to 32 ounces of
[2304.00 - 2307.68] celery juice
[2306.00 - 2310.48] wait
[2307.68 - 2312.16] another 15 to 30 minutes
[2310.48 - 2313.68] get your smoothie going that's what
[2312.16 - 2316.00] we're going to do right now

[2326.48 - 2330.08] okay
[2327.92 - 2331.92] glucose
[2330.08 - 2334.24] delivers
[2331.92 - 2336.08] the phytochemical compounds and the
[2334.24 - 2338.88] antioxidants and everything else that
[2336.08 - 2342.00] have to get to your brain and liver and
[2338.88 - 2345.44] other organs you gotta have the banana
[2342.00 - 2345.44] don't be afraid of banana
[2346.72 - 2350.40] unless you hate banana then okay put
[2349.04 - 2352.56] mango in there
[2350.40 - 2354.08] you hate banana but man
[2352.56 - 2356.56] here's the thing like all these
[2354.08 - 2358.88] alternatives are in here
[2356.56 - 2361.20] just so you know they're all in here

[2365.36 - 2369.76] in there let's get the wild blueberries
[2366.80 - 2371.84] in here here are the wild blueberries
[2369.76 - 2373.60] right here

[2381.28 - 2387.12] right frozen wild blueberries
[2385.36 - 2388.40] if you don't have wild blueberries use
[2387.12 - 2390.56] blackberries but they're not going to do
[2388.40 - 2393.12] the same thing but it's the closest
[2390.56 - 2395.68] thing we can we can use if you don't
[2393.12 - 2397.84] have an option the key is to have three
[2395.68 - 2401.36] out of these five ingredients if
[2397.84 - 2403.44] possible shoot for three out of five
[2401.36 - 2405.28] shoot for four out of five shoot for
[2403.44 - 2406.56] five out of five would be really
[2405.28 - 2408.88] incredible
[2406.56 - 2411.44] but if you only have three out of five
[2408.88 - 2412.96] that's what you have then
[2411.44 - 2416.80] we got the wild blueberry in there
[2412.96 - 2418.32] cilantro get about a cup in there

[2529.68 - 2533.64] teaspoon right there
[2536.48 - 2540.08] it's not my way or the highway
[2540.64 - 2544.88] it's what can you do can you do
[2544.96 - 2549.44] a little bit of lemon water what can you
[2547.28 - 2551.20] do i'm gonna drop in some while wild
[2549.44 - 2552.80] some barley grass juice powder next
[2551.20 - 2554.72] right here
[2552.80 - 2556.24] medical medium info is about going as
[2554.72 - 2557.84] far as you need to go when you want to
[2556.24 - 2561.20] go and when you want to do it it's about
[2557.84 - 2563.68] going as far as you want to go
[2561.20 - 2565.20] and when
[2563.68 - 2567.20] yes let's talk about the lymphatic
[2565.20 - 2568.64] system once i get this smoothie going i
[2567.20 - 2570.08] want to talk about the lymphatic system
[2568.64 - 2571.68] there's a lot of misinformation about
[2570.08 - 2573.52] the lymphatic system out there and quite
[2571.68 - 2574.88] frankly it's it's kind of embarrassing
[2573.52 - 2576.88] at this point
[2574.88 - 2578.96] and and and a nuisance too because it
[2576.88 - 2581.44] interferes with people's healing so i
[2578.96 - 2582.80] can't wait to cover that for a minute
[2581.44 - 2584.40] so i'm going to put
[2582.80 - 2585.76] now the dulce liquid
[2584.40 - 2588.96] right there
[2585.76 - 2592.08] i'm going to put a shot of that in
[2588.96 - 2593.76] you could do one or two dropper fulls
[2592.08 - 2595.52] i might even throw a little whole piece
[2593.76 - 2596.40] in there too just a little whole piece
[2595.52 - 2597.60] of
[2596.40 - 2599.76] there we go
[2597.60 - 2601.92] right
[2599.76 - 2603.36] and then
[2601.92 - 2604.80] i'm going to put a little bit of this in
[2603.36 - 2605.92] here too i mean people that don't even
[2604.80 - 2607.60] have the wild blueberries but they can
[2605.92 - 2609.60] get a hold of a wild blueberry juice
[2607.60 - 2611.76] that's that's the way to go right
[2609.60 - 2613.20] you can go do that option
[2611.76 - 2614.96] it doesn't mean go to the store and buy
[2613.20 - 2616.56] a blueberry juice because the blueberry
[2614.96 - 2618.80] juice is not going to be the same thing
[2616.56 - 2620.72] it's going to be wild blueberry
[2618.80 - 2622.72] now you guys know i do work
[2620.72 - 2626.40] with wyman's
[2622.72 - 2626.40] i do work with wyman's
[2626.64 - 2628.88] okay
[2629.84 - 2634.80] because the process of what they do i'm
[2632.32 - 2636.96] supportive 100 i endorse them i work
[2634.80 - 2639.44] with them on this important pouring a
[2636.96 - 2642.96] little bit in there right

[2645.36 - 2649.92] all right
[2646.48 - 2651.36] i think we got what we need in here
[2649.92 - 2653.20] we're loaded up
[2651.36 - 2655.36] that's the smoothie right there let's
[2653.20 - 2656.64] give it a blend
[2655.36 - 2658.40] and we'll talk about the lymphatic
[2656.64 - 2662.20] system for a couple of minutes let's
[2658.40 - 2662.20] turn this puppy on
[2665.36 - 2667.84] here we go

[2790.48 - 2794.00] a deep sense of sadness and they don't
[2792.32 - 2795.84] know why they have the sadness i've
[2794.00 - 2797.44] watched for years i've watched for years
[2795.84 - 2799.12] something that happens to people like
[2797.44 - 2800.64] they have this deep sense of sadness
[2799.12 - 2802.16] they they're not sure if it's a
[2800.64 - 2804.64] depression but they don't really know
[2802.16 - 2806.48] they just it's a sense of like
[2804.64 - 2808.16] sadness right so then they go to a
[2806.48 - 2809.28] therapist and the therapist is trying to
[2808.16 - 2810.96] crack them
[2809.28 - 2812.80] so then the therapist is trying to crack
[2810.96 - 2814.88] them tell me about your life
[2812.80 - 2816.56] like whoa i'm like this is what i do
[2814.88 - 2818.00] this is what i you know this is my life
[2816.56 - 2818.96] and i'm like okay well let's find out
[2818.00 - 2820.08] where the problem is right there's
[2818.96 - 2821.20] nothing wrong with that right you go to
[2820.08 - 2822.80] the therapist
[2821.20 - 2824.24] and then there's that therapist the deep
[2822.80 - 2825.44] sense of sadness doesn't end up
[2824.24 - 2827.04] resolving so now they're at a
[2825.44 - 2828.40] psychiatrist right then they're then
[2827.04 - 2829.84] then from there they're at their doctor
[2828.40 - 2831.60] and that doctor's doing a work up and
[2829.84 - 2834.00] taking blood out of them and more blood
[2831.60 - 2835.68] out of them and making them sicker right
[2834.00 - 2837.04] and then now they're going from the
[2835.68 - 2838.40] doctor to another doctor but they have
[2837.04 - 2840.00] this deep sense of sadness right and
[2838.40 - 2842.32] then their family's like why are you so
[2840.00 - 2845.04] sad why are you so sad then they go find
[2842.32 - 2846.96] a psychic
[2845.04 - 2848.88] and then the psychic says that they're
[2846.96 - 2851.12] sad because in their past life they had
[2848.88 - 2853.84] their head chopped off under queen
[2851.12 - 2856.00] victoria of whatever year and whatever
[2853.84 - 2858.96] whatnot or they were burned alive at the
[2856.00 - 2860.80] stake as a witch or their sadness is
[2858.96 - 2862.48] because they were on the titanic and
[2860.80 - 2864.08] they went down the titanic went down and
[2862.48 - 2865.60] they were one of the people that died on
[2864.08 - 2868.72] the titanic in their past lives and
[2865.60 - 2870.88] that's why they have this deep sadness
[2868.72 - 2872.48] meanwhile the whole time
[2870.88 - 2873.92] it's toxic heavy metals eating away at
[2872.48 - 2875.28] their brain and that sadness becomes
[2873.92 - 2876.80] something worse down the road unless
[2875.28 - 2878.16] they address the toxic heavy metals and
[2876.80 - 2880.24] something worse than something worse so
[2878.16 - 2882.00] then when they have a real serious
[2880.24 - 2884.56] problem down the road with their brain
[2882.00 - 2889.12] 20 years down the road okay and now it's
[2884.56 - 2889.12] serious like some serious craps going on
[2890.48 - 2893.60] no one knew it was a toxic heavy metals
[2892.24 - 2895.20] but they thought all these years is
[2893.60 - 2897.32] because of one of their past lives they
[2895.20 - 2902.54] died on the titanic
[2897.32 - 2902.54] [Music]
[2903.92 - 2909.28] snack on some apples that's part of this
[2906.08 - 2910.80] metal detox cleanse
[2909.28 - 2912.24] okay snap on some apples we're gonna
[2910.80 - 2913.60] talk about the lymphatic system let's
[2912.24 - 2915.92] run across that with a little bit
[2913.60 - 2917.28] lymphatic system
[2915.92 - 2918.72] we're on it
[2917.28 - 2920.80] oh
[2918.72 - 2923.76] very careful the guts of this dummy just
[2920.80 - 2923.76] fall right out
[2924.64 - 2928.24] okay
[2926.56 - 2930.80] lymphatic system time you'll see some
[2928.24 - 2932.80] lymphatic vessels somewhere right here
[2930.80 - 2934.80] say the lymphatic vessels here
[2932.80 - 2937.28] some little lymph nodes some lymphatic
[2934.80 - 2940.40] vessels there we are right
[2937.28 - 2942.00] if you hear
[2940.40 - 2943.84] from facebook groups that are not
[2942.00 - 2945.76] authentic facebook groups of medical
[2943.84 - 2946.96] medium where it's not the medical medium
[2945.76 - 2948.48] authentic
[2946.96 - 2950.08] right
[2948.48 - 2951.60] facebook group and you've got these so
[2950.08 - 2954.32] what happens is you get medical medium
[2951.60 - 2955.60] fans that eventually create
[2954.32 - 2959.36] not all of them do this but they
[2955.60 - 2960.88] eventually create a facebook group right
[2959.36 - 2962.80] over the years
[2960.88 - 2965.60] they create a facebook group and then
[2962.80 - 2969.04] they start changing everything they
[2965.60 - 2971.20] start trying to indoctrinate the people
[2969.04 - 2972.64] coming in they make it look like it's
[2971.20 - 2974.08] all medical medium they make it look
[2972.64 - 2976.16] like medical medium doesn't know what
[2974.08 - 2978.08] he's talking about anymore and they just
[2976.16 - 2980.72] get people in so they can sell all their
[2978.08 - 2982.72] stuff right all their lymphatic tonics
[2980.72 - 2984.88] and all kinds of crazy stuff and then
[2982.72 - 2986.24] what happens is people go into the group
[2984.88 - 2987.92] the group gets bigger and bigger and
[2986.24 - 2990.24] bigger and it becomes kind of like this
[2987.92 - 2992.08] half-like medical medium yeah i kind of
[2990.24 - 2993.20] like them in this half i kind of hate
[2992.08 - 2995.84] them
[2993.20 - 2997.92] and it becomes this group that is just a
[2995.84 - 3000.64] smorgasbord of like nothing but
[2997.92 - 3003.04] misinformation some haters
[3000.64 - 3004.56] some naysayers people don't even read
[3003.04 - 3006.40] the books or the medical medium books
[3004.56 - 3009.44] they never even read any of the books
[3006.40 - 3011.20] and it becomes this just big colossal
[3009.44 - 3014.24] cluster
[3011.20 - 3015.76] and that's what it is right
[3014.24 - 3017.44] and so
[3015.76 - 3019.36] in these groups in some of these groups
[3017.44 - 3020.80] under each other you're saying yes yes
[3019.36 - 3022.00] yes you've seen this over and over again
[3020.80 - 3023.84] yeah i know
[3022.00 - 3025.84] so i just have to bring this up because
[3023.84 - 3028.32] here's one of the colossal screw-ups
[3025.84 - 3030.24] that are happening now is
[3028.32 - 3031.60] you can't do the heavy metal detox
[3030.24 - 3033.76] cleanse unless you cleanse your
[3031.60 - 3035.68] lymphatic system get lymphatic drainage
[3033.76 - 3037.12] and lymphatic massage that's the most
[3035.68 - 3038.88] ridiculous thing i've ever heard in my
[3037.12 - 3041.68] life
[3038.88 - 3043.92] and so people will be like wait a minute
[3041.68 - 3045.12] i'm afraid do i even start the heavy
[3043.92 - 3046.48] metal ones meanwhile the person's
[3045.12 - 3048.08] suffering they got anxiety they got
[3046.48 - 3050.64] depression they got all kinds of
[3048.08 - 3053.20] problems they're sick they got you mean
[3050.64 - 3055.20] i can't do the heavy metal detox cleanse
[3053.20 - 3057.92] unless i do what with my lymphatic
[3055.20 - 3060.00] system buy your lymphatic products
[3057.92 - 3061.84] okay so i'm in this new facebook group
[3060.00 - 3064.16] right now and i'm gonna now buy all your
[3061.84 - 3066.56] lymphatic system products too let me
[3064.16 - 3068.56] spend a fortune a thousand dollars on
[3066.56 - 3070.16] all of your lymphatic products because
[3068.56 - 3072.32] you're telling me i can't do the heavy
[3070.16 - 3074.40] metal detox movie unless i clear my
[3072.32 - 3077.12] lymphatic system
[3074.40 - 3079.28] and oh by the way i better pay for and
[3077.12 - 3080.96] buy your program too your thousand
[3079.28 - 3082.72] dollar program that i'm gonna have to
[3080.96 - 3084.56] buy as well because you seem to know
[3082.72 - 3086.08] more than the medical medium does
[3084.56 - 3087.60] because the medical medium is not saying
[3086.08 - 3089.04] that you have to cleanse and drain and
[3087.60 - 3090.56] do this with your lymphatic system
[3089.04 - 3092.32] before doing the heavy metal detox
[3090.56 - 3093.76] smoothie
[3092.32 - 3095.52] and that's the information out there
[3093.76 - 3096.40] that goes screwed up happens in all
[3095.52 - 3098.40] these
[3096.40 - 3099.92] places dana white
[3098.40 - 3103.36] says it's because they're selling a
[3099.92 - 3105.12] lymphatic reset program 100 true right
[3103.36 - 3106.80] so what you have is you have all these
[3105.12 - 3109.44] like i used to call baby sharks but
[3106.80 - 3111.04] right now i just call basically just
[3109.44 - 3113.52] i don't know what name i could name them
[3111.04 - 3115.28] now right i don't want to like
[3113.52 - 3116.72] you know how you're just like you just
[3115.28 - 3118.24] you don't want to stoop down to their
[3116.72 - 3119.60] level you guys know it's right you don't
[3118.24 - 3122.96] want to stoop down to your level and be
[3119.60 - 3124.88] like say something really bad
[3122.96 - 3125.84] right but when their intention is really
[3124.88 - 3127.68] dark
[3125.84 - 3129.92] and they're misleading people and they
[3127.68 - 3131.60] stare people off off the deep end
[3129.92 - 3132.96] instead they're the wrong direction and
[3131.60 - 3134.80] they end up not helping them but they
[3132.96 - 3136.88] want to sell them their whatever
[3134.80 - 3138.96] you can't you know you it's it's just
[3136.88 - 3140.64] crazy how it works right
[3138.96 - 3141.84] but they use medical medium to bring
[3140.64 - 3143.20] these people down so they're using
[3141.84 - 3144.56] medical medium to bring these people
[3143.20 - 3146.16] down they use medical medium to lure
[3144.56 - 3148.24] them in and then they use medical medium
[3146.16 - 3151.96] to bring them down right so let's talk
[3148.24 - 3151.96] about the lymphatic system
[3152.08 - 3156.72] the heavy metal detox cleanse or
[3154.32 - 3158.24] smoothie and celery juice
[3156.72 - 3161.44] or lemon water
[3158.24 - 3161.44] is cleaning up your liver
[3161.92 - 3165.20] when you clean up your liver the
[3163.20 - 3167.28] lymphatic system automatically gets
[3165.20 - 3170.16] cleaned up so your lymphatic system
[3167.28 - 3171.68] automatically gets cleaned up
[3170.16 - 3173.76] anything you're doing for your lymphatic
[3171.68 - 3176.00] system doesn't fix the problem
[3173.76 - 3177.36] it doesn't and no one even can measure
[3176.00 - 3179.52] if it's helping the lymphatic system
[3177.36 - 3181.36] they can't see your lymphatic system
[3179.52 - 3183.44] you can take a lymphatic system tonic
[3181.36 - 3185.92] it's not going to fix it or help it
[3183.44 - 3187.76] there's no anything that shows
[3185.92 - 3190.00] that it would or could
[3187.76 - 3193.28] it's someone's idea i guess out there
[3190.00 - 3195.76] that oh lymphatic system this will help
[3193.28 - 3197.44] so the point is is that they'll tell you
[3195.76 - 3198.56] you can't start the metal cleanse or
[3197.44 - 3201.44] anything unless you address the
[3198.56 - 3203.04] lymphatic system right it's false
[3201.44 - 3205.28] information of the worst kind and it's
[3203.04 - 3207.44] misleading first of all the heavy metal
[3205.28 - 3208.96] detox smoothie that you would drink if
[3207.44 - 3210.72] you're doing this to see this metal
[3208.96 - 3212.80] smoothie right there
[3210.72 - 3214.56] goes into the liver and it starts to
[3212.80 - 3216.40] restore it
[3214.56 - 3217.84] as your liver is restoring the lymphatic
[3216.40 - 3219.60] system is automatically restoring
[3217.84 - 3221.68] because your lymphatic system is going
[3219.60 - 3224.00] to be
[3221.68 - 3225.52] not great because your liver is stagnant
[3224.00 - 3227.36] and sluggish it's the dumping ground so
[3225.52 - 3229.52] your lymphatic system is the trash
[3227.36 - 3232.32] ground for a bad liver for a liver
[3229.52 - 3233.76] that's stagnant and sluggish and dirty
[3232.32 - 3235.28] so when you're doing the heavy metal
[3233.76 - 3237.36] detox
[3235.28 - 3238.88] you're cleaning up
[3237.36 - 3240.96] right your liver
[3238.88 - 3242.64] so then the sewer system lymphatic
[3240.96 - 3244.80] system gets cleaned up automatically
[3242.64 - 3248.08] that's the whole point so by saying no
[3244.80 - 3250.00] you have to buy my lymphatic program
[3248.08 - 3251.76] and you have to subscribe and buy all my
[3250.00 - 3253.20] stuff and products and lymphatic before
[3251.76 - 3255.28] you can even do medical medium because
[3253.20 - 3257.28] medical medium doesn't know
[3255.28 - 3260.16] he doesn't know better i know better
[3257.28 - 3262.88] than him so i'm gonna sell you my my
[3260.16 - 3264.16] lymphatic programs right
[3262.88 - 3265.92] and that's where the confusion gets
[3264.16 - 3267.52] right there it's really terrible
[3265.92 - 3269.44] and
[3267.52 - 3271.20] i get it you know
[3269.44 - 3273.28] there's a lot of sharks baby sharks out
[3271.20 - 3274.80] there that's what it is lots of them a
[3273.28 - 3276.72] lot of baby sharks in the medical mean
[3274.80 - 3278.80] community that healed from medical
[3276.72 - 3281.76] medium information they're still using
[3278.80 - 3283.60] it now but then they leave and they kick
[3281.76 - 3285.20] like they kick medical medium down as
[3283.60 - 3287.04] they're leaving they step on them and
[3285.20 - 3288.80] spit on them and then they go because
[3287.04 - 3291.28] they're just like no i want to sell my
[3288.80 - 3293.60] whatever my ionizer water machine i want
[3291.28 - 3296.08] to sell my fulvic acid i want to sell my
[3293.60 - 3297.52] humic acid i want to sell my shilajit i
[3296.08 - 3299.92] want to sell them whatever i'm going to
[3297.52 - 3302.24] mlm into
[3299.92 - 3304.40] so the liver is just the lymphatic
[3302.24 - 3306.32] system is an overflow of your liver so
[3304.40 - 3307.60] your liver has to clean up and that's
[3306.32 - 3309.28] what this does so when you do your
[3307.60 - 3312.00] celery juice you do your lemon water
[3309.28 - 3314.00] right here and you do your your heavy
[3312.00 - 3315.68] metal detox smoothie right or if you're
[3314.00 - 3317.28] just using a little bit of spirulina
[3315.68 - 3318.72] every day or however you want to do it
[3317.28 - 3320.48] and customize the way you want to do
[3318.72 - 3322.80] you're cleaning up your liver inevitably
[3320.48 - 3324.96] it cleans up your lymphatic system is
[3322.80 - 3327.12] what it does
[3324.96 - 3328.96] key information right there just so you
[3327.12 - 3331.20] know
[3328.96 - 3331.20] so
[3331.36 - 3336.80] you'll see this out there all the time
[3335.28 - 3338.80] and the problem is they won't get
[3336.80 - 3340.96] censored but i will so facebook will
[3338.80 - 3342.56] censor me but facebook won't censor them
[3340.96 - 3344.24] so their group gets bigger and bigger
[3342.56 - 3346.56] with the misinformation
[3344.24 - 3349.44] and that's the way life works but i
[3346.56 - 3352.24] think darkness just finds its way to
[3349.44 - 3354.56] kind of like create these situations
[3352.24 - 3356.80] and it's just it's it's interesting
[3354.56 - 3359.20] but hey we work for the light and we got
[3356.80 - 3361.04] to remember that okay the other thing
[3359.20 - 3363.04] too is these other places they become
[3361.04 - 3364.72] cults you know so what happens is they
[3363.04 - 3367.20] become cults
[3364.72 - 3369.20] in so many ways because they're the ones
[3367.20 - 3371.84] making all these darn roles they're
[3369.20 - 3373.12] making roles that are like
[3371.84 - 3376.16] crazy
[3373.12 - 3377.84] and you have to pay in those cults right
[3376.16 - 3378.88] you have to pay that's how crazy it
[3377.84 - 3380.16] works too
[3378.88 - 3382.48] because now you're in fear and you
[3380.16 - 3384.32] better get that lymphatic protocol
[3382.48 - 3386.32] programmed for a thousand dollars you
[3384.32 - 3387.60] better get something out you know what i
[3386.32 - 3391.12] mean and that's how just so you think
[3387.60 - 3393.12] they prey on sick people
[3391.12 - 3395.28] and that's that's what happens
[3393.12 - 3396.80] when your lymphatic system
[3395.28 - 3399.52] when your liver gets really really
[3396.80 - 3401.36] sluggish and stagnant and really dirty
[3399.52 - 3403.12] and it's dumping in into your
[3401.36 - 3404.72] bloodstream and it's dumping into
[3403.12 - 3406.32] everything it's not just
[3404.72 - 3408.48] a lymphatic system when your liver is
[3406.32 - 3410.56] really dirty it overflows and it dumps
[3408.48 - 3411.68] into everything and then we get
[3410.56 - 3414.88] sensitive
[3411.68 - 3416.40] and sensitive and people get sensitive
[3414.88 - 3417.68] and it's not even the lymphatic system
[3416.40 - 3419.04] causing a problem that's the other
[3417.68 - 3420.80] problem so people don't realize that
[3419.04 - 3422.64] their lymphatic system is not giving
[3420.80 - 3424.16] them any problems
[3422.64 - 3425.60] they're sick from nervous system
[3424.16 - 3427.04] problems they're sick from vagus nerve
[3425.60 - 3428.56] problems they're sick from neurological
[3427.04 - 3429.76] issues they're sick from pathogens
[3428.56 - 3431.36] they're sick from all these things
[3429.76 - 3434.40] they're not sick because their lymphatic
[3431.36 - 3436.48] system is an issue that's another reason
[3434.40 - 3438.56] why it's so screwed up of what they're
[3436.48 - 3440.40] doing they're trying to get someone kind
[3438.56 - 3442.00] of mental about their lymphatic system
[3440.40 - 3443.44] when their lymphatic system has nothing
[3442.00 - 3444.72] to do with why they're sick to begin
[3443.44 - 3446.24] with and has nothing to do with why
[3444.72 - 3449.04] they're sensitive nothing to do with why
[3446.24 - 3450.96] they're neurologically feeling pain and
[3449.04 - 3452.48] their suffering nothing to do with their
[3450.96 - 3454.56] symptoms nothing to do with their
[3452.48 - 3458.00] anxiety or anything like that
[3454.56 - 3459.68] nothing you can have somebody
[3458.00 - 3462.00] got somebody with a real lymphatic
[3459.68 - 3464.16] problem like severe lymphoedema
[3462.00 - 3465.76] right some something separate
[3464.16 - 3467.20] you have somebody with that and they
[3465.76 - 3468.64] won't have anxiety they won't have
[3467.20 - 3470.56] anything else they won't have any of
[3468.64 - 3472.48] these problems doesn't mean so what they
[3470.56 - 3473.84] do is they take all these symptoms and
[3472.48 - 3476.96] conditions everybody's suffering with
[3473.84 - 3478.88] and then they'll say whoa i can totally
[3476.96 - 3480.88] i can manipulate them saying this is a
[3478.88 - 3483.60] medical medium facebook group i can
[3480.88 - 3485.36] manipulate them get them in and then i
[3483.60 - 3487.36] could tell them that all their symptoms
[3485.36 - 3489.04] and all their suffering is their
[3487.36 - 3491.44] lymphatic system or something and i
[3489.04 - 3492.72] could make a crap boatload of money
[3491.44 - 3494.80] perfect and i'll get a bunch of
[3492.72 - 3496.40] administrators in that facebook group so
[3494.80 - 3497.60] the administrators traders are like yeah
[3496.40 - 3498.80] anthony doesn't know what he's talking
[3497.60 - 3500.32] about yeah anthony doesn't know what

[3520.64 - 3523.20] go to the library
[3522.08 - 3525.68] a lot

[3525.68 - 3529.04] the people that
[3527.20 - 3531.04] get the medical mean books get it for
[3529.04 - 3532.88] free at the library and that's the way i

[3546.40 - 3550.88] how to get rid of medals
[3548.08 - 3552.64] which i think is just ridiculous i could

[3552.64 - 3557.04] time and get the book okay and i don't
[3554.88 - 3559.12] control the price on amazon they knocked
[3557.04 - 3561.44] it down so low that it cost more to
[3559.12 - 3563.60] print the book isn't that nice of them i
[3561.44 - 3566.64] will tell you this i really think it's
[3563.60 - 3570.08] angelic intervention i believe the
[3566.64 - 3573.20] angels intervened with amazon
[3570.08 - 3576.96] to cut the book so low in price
[3573.20 - 3579.04] regardless of whatever happens whether i
[3576.96 - 3580.80] can keep lights on or not
[3579.04 - 3582.32] all right whether i can keep the
[3580.80 - 3584.00] utilities going
[3582.32 - 3586.40] it doesn't matter i really think it's
[3584.00 - 3590.32] angelic intervention they made the price
[3586.40 - 3592.64] 51 off on this massive textbook
[3590.32 - 3595.52] on amazon i think it's it's incredible
