[0.80 - 10.92] [Music]
[9.04 - 15.72] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 18.36] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.72 - 19.88] medium hello I'm Anthony William and
[18.36 - 22.20] you're listening to the medical medium
[19.88 - 24.00] radio show where each week I talk about
[22.20 - 25.84] the most advanced healing information
[24.00 - 29.36] and secrets about health much of which
[25.84 - 30.92] is not found anywhere else and is it is
[29.36 - 32.72] decades ahead head of what's out there
[30.92 - 35.44] now I'm kind of giggly today as I've
[32.72 - 37.48] always said who has 10 or 20 30 years to
[35.44 - 38.76] wait for answers for example the show
[37.48 - 43.32] today we're talking about
[38.76 - 45.24] UTI UTI urinary tract infections yeah is
[43.32 - 46.84] this an important topic yeah you better
[45.24 - 48.80] believe it is it's really important
[46.84 - 50.72] we're going to cover this it's really
[48.80 - 52.88] important and you know there's a lot of
[50.72 - 54.72] reasons why it's important for sure and
[52.88 - 56.56] I'm giggling because I was I was
[54.72 - 59.72] remembering right before I got on to the
[56.56 - 63.60] show was remembering so many stories if
[59.72 - 67.48] you UTI over the decades where I'd help
[63.60 - 70.24] people try to prepare so they're not
[67.48 - 72.76] heading on a plane and you feel that UTI
[70.24 - 74.44] coming on so they're they're not I mean
[72.76 - 77.20] there's nothing worse than that and I
[74.44 - 79.64] feel bad and I'm not I'm not laughing
[77.20 - 82.08] I'm I'm giggling because I remember so
[79.64 - 84.44] many times I've been able to to you know
[82.08 - 87.28] to stop it from happening and that gives
[84.44 - 89.24] you relief and so I'm laughing now
[87.28 - 90.52] because I'm excited about giving people
[89.24 - 92.72] relief
[90.52 - 94.36] and and that makes me happy because you
[92.72 - 96.76] know I've I've spent so much time trying
[94.36 - 98.76] to prepare people to so it would not
[96.76 - 100.76] happen you know like you people that get
[98.76 - 102.24] them all the time so to try to get rid
[100.76 - 103.68] of them and so they're gone for good and
[102.24 - 105.00] there' be this process where it takes a
[103.68 - 106.68] little time you know all of a sudden you
[105.00 - 109.16] have less UTI than less and finally
[106.68 - 110.84] they're gone for good and I've been able
[109.16 - 112.88] to help so many people over the decades
[110.84 - 114.84] and I remember you know there's always
[112.88 - 117.24] this good feeling like the pressure is
[114.84 - 119.48] off when not only did their UTI get
[117.24 - 120.92] better without using antibiotics but it
[119.48 - 122.72] would get get better and go away for
[120.92 - 124.28] good and it gives you this relief this
[122.72 - 126.80] like oh thank God the person doesn't
[124.28 - 128.84] have to suffer anymore in their life and
[126.80 - 130.44] that get gets me giggly because that's
[128.84 - 132.20] what it's all about it's is getting
[130.44 - 133.96] people that relief of any kind in all
[132.20 - 135.60] these different illnesses we talk about
[133.96 - 137.92] so I'm excited about today today you
[135.60 - 140.72] know I was like Hey UTI okay this is
[137.92 - 142.48] great um so it's really important to
[140.72 - 143.84] know so listen I just got to tell you
[142.48 - 145.92] something this is I say this at the
[143.84 - 148.00] beginning of every show for a real real
[145.92 - 151.08] important reason you know the
[148.00 - 154.04] information on this show here you can't
[151.08 - 156.04] get anywhere else it's not possible and
[154.04 - 158.52] if you did get it anywhere else it came
[156.04 - 160.64] from me originally whether anybody likes
[158.52 - 162.68] it or not so it's really important to
[160.64 - 164.16] understand the information here doesn't
[162.68 - 165.84] it's not backed by interest groups it
[164.16 - 167.44] doesn't come from in interest groups it
[165.84 - 169.36] doesn't come from medical funding with
[167.44 - 171.00] strings attached it doesn't come from
[169.36 - 172.92] botched research with the thumb on the
[171.00 - 174.40] scale because there's money behind it
[172.92 - 177.32] because that's what happens with almost
[174.40 - 179.16] every study I hate to say it you guys
[177.32 - 180.48] when it comes down to chronic illness
[179.16 - 183.08] when it comes down to chronic illness
[180.48 - 184.60] especially any s any study that's done
[183.08 - 186.96] there's somebody putting a thumb on the
[184.60 - 189.04] scale I'm sorry it's just the way it
[186.96 - 191.16] works I know this for a fact I know
[189.04 - 193.52] people in the field in the Science World
[191.16 - 195.72] I know you name it and I've heard and
[193.52 - 197.48] seen it all I know how it works there's
[195.72 - 198.64] no persuaded belief systems with the
[197.48 - 200.44] information that I'm giving you there's
[198.64 - 202.32] no private panels of influencers that
[200.44 - 204.44] you guys have no idea exist in
[202.32 - 206.72] alternative medicine all throughout
[204.44 - 209.28] alternative medicine to have something
[206.72 - 212.40] come out a certain way so it can then be
[209.28 - 214.96] to Al used in a certain way it's just
[212.40 - 216.72] how it works investors invest in all
[214.96 - 218.56] aspects of alternative medicine and
[216.72 - 220.64] conventional medicine and guess what we
[218.56 - 222.20] are free from it you need to know this
[220.64 - 224.56] if you're a first-time listener it's
[222.20 - 226.76] that critical to know trust me it is
[224.56 - 228.76] that critical to know because it's
[226.76 - 231.60] important no private panels of
[228.76 - 235.48] influencers no health field payoffs and
[231.60 - 237.92] no trendy traps those nasty trendy traps
[235.48 - 240.08] that confuse people to stop them from
[237.92 - 242.32] healing taking advantage of their
[240.08 - 243.96] vulnerabilities of being sick for a long
[242.32 - 248.40] time and not knowing what direction to
[243.96 - 250.36] go and sucking them in with trendy traps
[248.40 - 252.20] there are so many of them at this point
[250.36 - 254.04] it is endless and it is actually
[252.20 - 255.84] sickening so that's a whole thing there
[254.04 - 257.48] so I'm just telling you this Joe does
[255.84 - 259.08] not have any of that it's the only
[257.48 - 262.16] Health show out there in the world
[259.08 - 263.72] actually that is pure and untampered
[262.16 - 265.80] with the information that's here it's
[263.72 - 267.68] Advanced it's a clean Source it was
[265.80 - 269.24] given to me as a gift since age four
[267.68 - 271.24] I've been using it ever since to fight
[269.24 - 273.60] for the people and fight for your rights
[271.24 - 277.96] of healing and fight for womenkind and
[273.60 - 280.48] Mankind to make sure that we have better
[277.96 - 283.52] lives and that's what the gift was given
[280.48 - 287.04] to me for and you just need to know that
[283.52 - 289.84] before we start so we're going into
[287.04 - 292.68] UTI let's talk about that a little bit
[289.84 - 295.04] you know you're you got your bag packed
[292.68 - 297.88] and you're heading off maybe a family
[295.04 - 301.08] member is driving you to a um to you
[297.88 - 303.32] know to the airport and and you feel a
[301.08 - 305.96] little bit of UTI coming on and you're
[303.32 - 308.44] like darn it I know this feeling I felt
[305.96 - 309.92] this before and I'm feeling it again and
[308.44 - 313.40] I'm about to hop on a
[309.92 - 316.00] plane okay and or or you're about to go
[313.40 - 319.84] on a bus or you're about to go on a
[316.00 - 324.12] vacation with someone or a trip or a car
[319.84 - 326.80] trip or it's a big family night out and
[324.12 - 330.48] you're getting a UTI or it's a dinner
[326.80 - 333.56] party or you have to go to your boss's
[330.48 - 336.16] house for a party or you have to go
[333.56 - 337.88] whatever it could be or hey you're
[336.16 - 339.16] you're you joined a bathon so you're
[337.88 - 340.88] going to be biking you're going to be
[339.16 - 343.60] riding a bicycle with you know a
[340.88 - 346.04] thousand people and you feel that UTI
[343.60 - 347.76] coming on you're like not now and you're
[346.04 - 349.52] like already looking for the cranberry
[347.76 - 351.44] juice you're already looking for the
[349.52 - 355.04] cranberry
[351.44 - 356.40] juice and yeah for real like how many
[355.04 - 358.88] people have ever felt this how many
[356.40 - 361.48] people mostly women not men but mostly
[358.88 - 363.72] women have this have this experience and
[361.48 - 366.24] the same thing with BV bacterial
[363.72 - 368.44] vaginosis the same thing there it just
[366.24 - 370.52] starts coming on it could be before a
[368.44 - 373.60] cycle it could be right directly after a
[370.52 - 376.04] cycle just pass and there it is it's
[373.60 - 377.84] kind of coming on and there's discharge
[376.04 - 380.20] and you you're going to the doctors
[377.84 - 382.16] doctor's not sure if it's UTI or if it's
[380.20 - 383.84] you know or if it's BV or if it's a
[382.16 - 386.36] yeast infection and yeast infections
[383.84 - 388.28] being thrown in there left and right
[386.36 - 390.40] what is this all about anyway what if it
[388.28 - 392.76] is a bacterial infection
[390.40 - 394.64] what what kind of bacteria ah nobody
[392.76 - 396.60] really knows how do you like that isn't
[394.64 - 399.56] that funny that the labs don't really
[396.60 - 400.92] know isn't that funny you go in there
[399.56 - 402.44] and you got this kind of infection
[400.92 - 404.32] whether it's mild or starting or
[402.44 - 408.12] possibly yeast or not or what it's just
[404.32 - 409.88] you know hey nobody really knows I'm
[408.12 - 411.72] just being honest that's just how it
[409.88 - 413.88] works I've talked to a lot of urologists
[411.72 - 416.64] over the years too talked to a lot of
[413.88 - 418.92] them and you know that basically the
[416.64 - 421.00] protocol is is basically the bottom line
[418.92 - 422.88] is here just take this antibiotic and
[421.00 - 424.40] and go off in your way and we'll see
[422.88 - 426.96] what the lab says or we'll see what a
[424.40 - 429.40] culture says and and but what kind of
[426.96 - 431.24] bacteria is really going on for a UTI
[429.40 - 434.64] for real urinary tract
[431.24 - 436.48] infection and is it just yeast as yeast
[434.64 - 438.88] infection these are all the important
[436.48 - 442.64] questions and it's all important to know
[438.88 - 446.32] how things work so let's cut into it a
[442.64 - 447.24] UTI is bacterial you ready for this you
[446.32 - 451.36] ready for
[447.24 - 453.20] this a yeast infection no this isn't
[451.36 - 455.12] someone's going to say oh okay duh it's
[453.20 - 456.44] bacterial UTI okay isn't it bacterial
[455.12 - 458.96] you can just hop on line and look a
[456.44 - 461.60] yeast infection is
[458.96 - 463.48] bacterial that's right that's right a
[461.60 - 465.12] yeast infection is bacterial if you know
[463.48 - 466.64] that already it came from me originally
[465.12 - 467.96] I'm the first person that actually put
[466.64 - 471.76] that out there years
[467.96 - 475.52] ago exactly a yeast infection is
[471.76 - 478.40] bacterial bacterial that's right really
[475.52 - 482.24] important to know this really important
[478.40 - 485.36] yeast will be present many times when
[482.24 - 487.52] bacteria is jacking up when bacteria is
[485.36 - 490.64] is you know working its way up to the
[487.52 - 491.68] surface when when bacteria is flowing
[490.64 - 493.80] when it's growing when it's
[491.68 - 496.60] proliferating when it's
[493.80 - 500.48] evolving that's right and what will
[496.60 - 505.24] happen is yeast will try to beat it out
[500.48 - 508.04] it will try to beat it out because yeast
[505.24 - 510.04] its job is to gobble everything that
[508.04 - 512.60] shouldn't be around so that bacteria
[510.04 - 514.60] doesn't take over so when you have
[512.60 - 516.60] symptoms of a yeast infection and you go
[514.60 - 519.76] on to the doctor and you're on a yeast
[516.60 - 521.88] infection um treatment what's really
[519.76 - 522.96] happening is there's a bacterial
[521.88 - 527.24] infection that's
[522.96 - 528.72] underlying and that is the problem right
[527.24 - 530.36] there that there's that's why the yeast
[528.72 - 532.04] infection comes and comes and it keeps
[530.36 - 533.56] on coming and it over and over get
[532.04 - 535.00] another yeast infection n another yeast
[533.56 - 536.52] infection that's because bacteria is not
[535.00 - 538.60] being dealt with another yeast infection
[536.52 - 541.76] that's because it's bacterial it's
[538.60 - 544.00] bacterial there's a a bacteria involved
[541.76 - 547.00] another yeast infection there it goes
[544.00 - 550.08] that's how it works that's how it works
[547.00 - 553.52] and you know for years for years you
[550.08 - 556.80] know UTI have always been a mystery a
[553.52 - 558.00] mystery to research in science I'm just
[556.80 - 559.12] telling you right now they got a couple
[558.00 - 562.20] of treatments they pump you up with
[559.12 - 564.12] steroids if it gets really bad and they
[562.20 - 566.92] pump you up with tons of antibiotics
[564.12 - 570.04] whether they do it IV both steroids or
[566.92 - 572.72] antibiotics IV or whether they they
[570.04 - 575.52] administer it orally that's that's
[572.72 - 577.60] basically the treatment and whatever Hit
[575.52 - 579.24] or Miss whatever happens if it finally
[577.60 - 581.56] subsides and it eases
[579.24 - 584.16] off and you know you're able to you're
[581.56 - 586.00] able to get through it it it could come
[584.16 - 587.32] back again you could get the bleeding
[586.00 - 588.88] the whole bit we're going to talk about
[587.32 - 590.84] why the bleeding comes what the bleeding
[588.88 - 592.16] is of course it can run into the kidneys
[590.84 - 593.48] it could be it could start from the
[592.16 - 595.24] kidneys it could start from the urea
[593.48 - 596.20] thre the Ura it can start from it can
[595.24 - 599.20] start from
[596.20 - 601.72] anywhere and can start from the bladder
[599.20 - 603.64] you know bladder infection of course
[601.72 - 606.40] could be all three areas could be just
[603.64 - 608.92] one area nobody really knows I mean a
[606.40 - 610.84] real serious kidney infection a
[608.92 - 613.16] bacterial serious bacterial kidney
[610.84 - 614.56] infection doctors can most most of the
[613.16 - 616.24] time be like okay no this is in the
[614.56 - 618.16] kidney it's actually the kidney this is
[616.24 - 619.72] it this is severe let's do you know lots
[618.16 - 621.08] of antibiotics let's do a treatment of
[619.72 - 623.12] steroids let's try to get this under
[621.08 - 625.12] control but what is that bacteria that
[623.12 - 628.12] even gets to that point for some so many
[625.12 - 632.56] people out there what is it in what kind
[628.12 - 634.88] it's strep it's strep a cacus it's strep
[632.56 - 637.24] that's what it is it's the strep throat
[634.88 - 639.76] that we had at one time in our lives
[637.24 - 641.16] it's the strep that gets in the sinuses
[639.76 - 643.56] it's the same strep that causes
[641.16 - 645.24] sinusitis for so many people it sits in
[643.56 - 647.64] the cavities and the sinus cavities and
[645.24 - 650.00] sits in there and it gets in it just it
[647.64 - 652.48] works in the it works in the canals of
[650.00 - 654.32] the sinus passages it gets in there and
[652.48 - 656.28] it stays in there for years for so many
[654.32 - 659.32] people who get chronic sinusitis chronic
[656.28 - 660.76] allergies sinus infections and and
[659.32 - 662.48] anything can tip it over you got some
[660.76 - 664.40] hay fever anything that triggers it
[662.48 - 665.92] anything out there Foods or whatever it
[664.40 - 667.64] could feed the bacteria the bacteria
[665.92 - 669.44] your immune system can be you know
[667.64 - 671.44] overrun by so many contaminantes out
[669.44 - 672.40] there that the bacteria can just start
[671.44 - 675.28] taking
[672.40 - 676.68] over and so and that happens really
[675.28 - 679.96] common with sinusitis people with
[676.68 - 682.56] sinuses sinus problems but that same
[679.96 - 685.96] bacteria that's in our system and it
[682.56 - 689.80] just isn't strap a through
[685.96 - 692.00] H okay it used to be a and b
[689.80 - 695.20] now we've come to a place where at least
[692.00 - 698.52] science and research is at least at
[695.20 - 701.56] least acknowledging more groups of strep
[698.52 - 703.64] I was telling people about more groups
[701.56 - 706.84] of strep when I was eight years old
[703.64 - 709.48] hearing it from Spirit okay I was also
[706.84 - 711.88] told by Spirit at 8 years old that there
[709.48 - 713.72] would be so many groups of strep that
[711.88 - 716.28] you couldn't even fit it in the alphabet
[713.72 - 719.52] you would need more than one alphabet to
[716.28 - 722.96] actually fit it all in
[719.52 - 724.48] okay and guess what we're up to H and
[722.96 - 727.00] I'm going to tell you right now we're
[724.48 - 729.72] far past H and maybe they're already
[727.00 - 732.44] tacking on a couple more hi JK maybe
[729.72 - 734.60] they're about to head there but that's
[732.44 - 737.60] how many different groups of strep never
[734.60 - 739.72] mind the mutated varieties in every
[737.60 - 741.96] single group that science and research
[739.72 - 744.96] have no idea
[741.96 - 746.56] about so many varieties of strep and
[744.96 - 748.56] it's everywhere it's on public toilet
[746.56 - 751.68] seats it's on the public toilet handle
[748.56 - 753.12] it's on restaurant door knobs it's you
[751.68 - 755.32] know you walk into a restaurant you know
[753.12 - 757.56] what I do when I walk into a restaurant
[755.32 - 759.40] you know what I do a first thing I ask
[757.56 - 760.92] Spirit if there's anything on the handle
[759.40 - 761.96] that's the first thing I do I say to
[760.92 - 764.36] Spirit there's anything on the door
[761.96 - 766.00] handle spirit says no if there's no flu
[764.36 - 768.08] virus or there's no nothing on the door
[766.00 - 770.32] handle um then then I'll just I'll grab
[768.08 - 772.08] the door handle but I'll always grab the
[770.32 - 774.04] door handle underneath the door handle
[772.08 - 776.16] in a spot that not everybody thinks to
[774.04 - 778.28] grab it and then I also asked Spirit did
[776.16 - 779.76] someone think to be kind of like tricky
[778.28 - 781.68] too where they can you know grab the
[779.76 - 782.88] underneath the door handle did someone
[781.68 - 785.76] already do
[782.88 - 788.00] that you know and and it you know I'll
[785.76 - 789.76] get the first thing I'll ask is Spirit
[788.00 - 791.48] okay and you know and I'll grab the
[789.76 - 793.48] underneath or I'll take my pinky I'll
[791.48 - 795.76] open the door with my pinky underneath
[793.48 - 797.72] it because the last thing I need right
[795.76 - 799.40] now is another variety of strep or some
[797.72 - 801.08] other variety of strep or anything you
[799.40 - 803.44] know that could have got could get into
[801.08 - 805.48] me or whatever the last thing I need is
[803.44 - 807.04] is any variety of strep and I've been
[805.48 - 809.28] fortunate and I'm strep free and I've
[807.04 - 811.48] been very happy and fortunate about it
[809.28 - 813.36] but he gets in almost everybody and
[811.48 - 815.80] everybody everybody everybody in so many
[813.36 - 818.20] different ways and not just UTI not just
[815.80 - 819.48] sinusitis and sinist problems but strep
[818.20 - 821.16] throats sore throats that aren't
[819.48 - 822.56] diagnosed as strep throat because they
[821.16 - 824.20] can't find the strep on the surface
[822.56 - 825.36] because it's not your first strep throat
[824.20 - 826.48] so then you still have these sore
[825.36 - 828.12] throats you get these random sore
[826.48 - 829.52] throats you get run down which also
[828.12 - 831.52] means there's an Epstein bar present
[829.52 - 834.48] somewhere in the body
[831.52 - 836.76] somewhere and so it's easy to pick up
[834.48 - 838.24] strap they can pick it up anywhere so
[836.76 - 839.52] you can pick it up with physical contact
[838.24 - 842.68] with people and and everything like that
[839.52 - 843.88] and that's another thing too is that so
[842.68 - 845.76] many people have different varieties of
[843.88 - 847.04] strep and it's and here's the problem so
[845.76 - 848.36] many people have been on so many
[847.04 - 849.64] different antibiotics and different
[848.36 - 853.28] kinds of
[849.64 - 855.72] antibiotics that they their strep could
[853.28 - 857.40] be antibiotic resistant that's another
[855.72 - 859.32] thing too so you can have all these
[857.40 - 861.60] different antibiotic resistant streps
[859.32 - 863.32] floting around where they're they're
[861.60 - 864.80] resistant to one type of antibiotic but
[863.32 - 866.64] maybe not to another but then you got
[864.80 - 868.16] people that have had strep in their
[866.64 - 870.20] system all all through their lives
[868.16 - 872.76] causing all all kinds of symptoms like
[870.20 - 874.72] lots of acne cuz strep is actually
[872.76 - 877.40] behind acne cystic acne is caused by
[874.72 - 880.24] strep I'm just going to tell you right
[877.40 - 882.24] now and you know when you have this kind
[880.24 - 884.52] of strep in the system and it's in there
[882.24 - 886.40] cooking people take antibiotics they
[884.52 - 888.08] take antibiotics for a flu virus they
[886.40 - 891.28] take antibiotics for bronchitis and all
[888.08 - 893.16] of a sudden the strep gets fed a new
[891.28 - 894.80] antibiotic then it upgrades itself this
[893.16 - 896.36] is how it works and sometimes we have to
[894.80 - 897.72] use antibiotics we're in crisis Zone
[896.36 - 899.68] we're not taking care of ourselves we're
[897.72 - 901.12] not taking the right supplements to take
[899.68 - 903.76] care of our immune systems we're not
[901.12 - 905.68] eating the right foods and so we end up
[903.76 - 907.52] just like in an emergency situation or
[905.68 - 910.00] like oh my God dear Lord I got this
[907.52 - 914.36] infection or some my eyes blown up sty
[910.00 - 916.68] sty are strep that's what causes a sty
[914.36 - 921.68] you know the IAI that's
[916.68 - 924.56] strep and not only that you guys sibo
[921.68 - 926.64] that's strep that's strep in the gut
[924.56 - 929.24] that's not just overgrowth of bacteria
[926.64 - 931.52] that's overgrowth of strep that was fed
[929.24 - 934.32] antibiotics along the way from childhood
[931.52 - 936.20] on in some capacity and if it wasn't
[934.32 - 938.44] antibiotics actually literally
[936.20 - 940.32] administered treatment from a doctor
[938.44 - 942.60] prescribed and you've taken it was
[940.32 - 946.44] antibiotics you received from the water
[942.60 - 949.16] supply or antibiotics you received from
[946.44 - 951.44] food I mean not every single person has
[949.16 - 953.36] eaten a piece of chicken that's organic
[951.44 - 955.40] antibiotic free I'm sorry but that was
[953.36 - 957.36] just recently that it's mostly out and
[955.40 - 959.84] still all the restaurants Stock the
[957.36 - 963.20] regular chicken that's loaded win
[959.84 - 966.16] antibiotics so nowh no matter what you
[963.20 - 969.00] get the antibiotics in you so they're in
[966.16 - 971.12] there and they feed strep and then we
[969.00 - 973.88] end up with something like a
[971.12 - 976.72] UTI a lot of time also sexual contact
[973.88 - 979.84] you know a new partner or something and
[976.72 - 981.76] you know and and bugs bug normal bugs
[979.84 - 984.52] like strep that that are everywhere they
[981.76 - 986.16] just pass along and then a person gets
[984.52 - 989.48] their first
[986.16 - 991.36] UTI or their second kind after they
[989.48 - 995.16] haven't had them for too many
[991.36 - 996.72] years so it's just around and you know
[995.16 - 997.96] sorry about the story I know I did that
[996.72 - 999.56] long story about the grabbing the door
[997.96 - 1001.84] handle but that's true and then the
[999.56 - 1004.24] bathroom handle I actually just take my
[1001.84 - 1007.00] wrist and kind of use my wrist around
[1004.24 - 1009.68] the door handle or something you know to
[1007.00 - 1011.88] try not to touch the bathroom handle I
[1009.68 - 1013.56] mean maybe it's I'm I'm a little too
[1011.88 - 1015.40] much with that but the thing is is I
[1013.56 - 1017.32] know what where bugs are anyway cuz
[1015.40 - 1019.20] Spirit tells me when I sit on the plane
[1017.32 - 1021.92] I know if there's merca on my my plane
[1019.20 - 1024.20] seat I know if there's you know I know
[1021.92 - 1026.44] if there's tuberculosis you know cuz
[1024.20 - 1029.44] someone coughed and sneezed tuberculosis
[1026.44 - 1032.76] all over my my airline seat and I can
[1029.44 - 1033.80] ask spirit so you know it so yeah of
[1032.76 - 1035.32] course it's something that had been
[1033.80 - 1038.08] given as a gift to know through
[1035.32 - 1039.84] throughout my life and it it's helped me
[1038.08 - 1041.80] but I realize you guys don't have that
[1039.84 - 1043.88] so you know to bring handy wipes and
[1041.80 - 1045.80] stuff like that bring handy wipes always
[1043.88 - 1048.20] have the handy wipes it's really
[1045.80 - 1049.72] important but the bottom line why does
[1048.20 - 1051.04] it matter because you can get strep on
[1049.72 - 1052.92] your finger and stick it in your eye and
[1051.04 - 1055.32] have a sty and it could be your first
[1052.92 - 1057.24] sty for the first time and then after
[1055.32 - 1059.88] that a year later you have a UTI and
[1057.24 - 1062.36] have no idea why or how you got that
[1059.88 - 1063.76] UTI because what it was it started with
[1062.36 - 1065.56] the sty and it went into the body and
[1063.76 - 1068.24] into the system and it got down to where
[1065.56 - 1070.76] it got down to this is how it
[1068.24 - 1071.96] works so it's not about fearing life
[1070.76 - 1073.48] it's not about that at all it's about
[1071.96 - 1075.04] knowledge is power it's about knowing a
[1073.48 - 1076.72] lot it's about knowing everything it's
[1075.04 - 1078.60] about knowing all the things you need
[1076.72 - 1080.16] cuz guess what's worse than not not
[1078.60 - 1081.52] knowing what you need to know I'll tell
[1080.16 - 1083.72] you what's
[1081.52 - 1086.40] worse is not knowing what you need to
[1083.72 - 1089.88] know gu that's what I'm trying to
[1086.40 - 1091.76] say so you need to know what's what's
[1089.88 - 1094.12] going on I think I mixed it up there a
[1091.76 - 1096.44] little bit just bear with me you need to
[1094.12 - 1098.64] know what's going on because there's
[1096.44 - 1102.64] nothing worse than not knowing that's it
[1098.64 - 1104.56] that's it that's it talking too fast
[1102.64 - 1106.88] talking way too fast somebody I think
[1104.56 - 1108.72] someone did a comment while back was on
[1106.88 - 1112.32] social media and they said he talks too
[1108.72 - 1113.72] slow he talks too slow and so I was like
[1112.32 - 1116.16] oh God you know it's the second time I
[1113.72 - 1117.56] heard I talks too slow and then and then
[1116.16 - 1118.92] I picked it up a little bit it just
[1117.56 - 1122.36] naturally happened I guess and someone
[1118.92 - 1125.88] say he talks too fast I can't listen to
[1122.36 - 1128.96] him all right okay go back to yeast
[1125.88 - 1130.44] infections yeast infections candida
[1128.96 - 1131.64] other types of yeast there's a lot of
[1130.44 - 1133.12] different varieties of yeast there's a
[1131.64 - 1134.88] lot of different varities of fungus some
[1133.12 - 1136.80] some are really mean and nasty and some
[1134.88 - 1140.64] are just friendly and nice and great
[1136.80 - 1143.88] some friendly nice cute special fluffy
[1140.64 - 1145.64] light and Airy fungus which isn't bad is
[1143.88 - 1148.00] there to stop
[1145.64 - 1149.60] bacteria it's there to stop bacteria it
[1148.00 - 1153.00] could be irritating could be agitating
[1149.60 - 1155.52] could be problematic but it's there to
[1153.00 - 1159.72] try to gobble up
[1155.52 - 1161.48] proteins and other things like that
[1159.72 - 1163.68] other things like bad hormones and
[1161.48 - 1166.04] proteins that are in eggs and other
[1163.68 - 1168.72] things and all this that find their way
[1166.04 - 1170.56] into the bladder and they find their way
[1168.72 - 1172.60] into the vaginal area and they just find
[1170.56 - 1176.00] their way all over the place and and the
[1172.60 - 1178.92] yeast wants to just start eating it up
[1176.00 - 1180.28] and gobbling it up because if it doesn't
[1178.92 - 1182.20] guess what's going to feed off of it
[1180.28 - 1183.80] it's going to be strep that's what's
[1182.20 - 1185.72] going to feed off of it when yeast is
[1183.80 - 1187.80] present strp is present it's in there
[1185.72 - 1189.96] somewhere it's in the
[1187.80 - 1191.88] system that's the whole thing when
[1189.96 - 1194.24] someone is exploding with candida in
[1191.88 - 1197.08] their intestinal track that means strep
[1194.24 - 1198.88] is rampant Pro proliferating and going
[1197.08 - 1201.56] crazy also in there
[1198.88 - 1203.72] too so that's why the candid is freaking
[1201.56 - 1205.72] out because it's trying to gobble all
[1203.72 - 1207.64] the bad fats everybody's eating on these
[1205.72 - 1210.00] high trendy fat diets it's trying to
[1207.64 - 1213.28] gobble all this crazy
[1210.00 - 1216.12] stuff it's not trying to gobble fruit
[1213.28 - 1218.36] it's not trying to gobble
[1216.12 - 1220.64] vegetables but it's gobbling all this
[1218.36 - 1223.44] other stuff because it's trying not to
[1220.64 - 1226.12] let the shrep like ignite and
[1223.44 - 1228.24] proliferate and grow and just and and
[1226.12 - 1229.32] and move and vastly you know Cruise
[1228.24 - 1232.44] through the
[1229.32 - 1234.36] system so very important to know how it
[1232.44 - 1237.88] works same thing yeast infection same
[1234.36 - 1240.08] thing with BV it's all strep related yes
[1237.88 - 1242.04] it is and the groups of strep are now
[1240.08 - 1243.80] way past the alphabet we have including
[1242.04 - 1245.48] two alphabets but science and research
[1243.80 - 1246.92] is so behind it's unbelievable
[1245.48 - 1248.56] especially with chronic illness anything
[1246.92 - 1251.68] to do with chronic illness it's so
[1248.56 - 1253.76] behind don't get science confused don't
[1251.68 - 1256.64] get don't get confused about the good
[1253.76 - 1258.60] parts of science don't get confused
[1256.64 - 1260.76] about what they do with with like like
[1258.60 - 1262.80] mathematics and they try to create uh
[1260.76 - 1264.52] parts and they try to they try to build
[1262.80 - 1266.16] things and they try to create better
[1264.52 - 1267.88] equipment for diagnosis and everything
[1266.16 - 1269.28] else don't get confused by that science
[1267.88 - 1270.80] versus chronic illness where science
[1269.28 - 1272.24] research knows nothing about I'm sorry
[1270.80 - 1275.04] they know nothing about chronic illness
[1272.24 - 1277.92] we got over 250 million sick people in
[1275.04 - 1279.28] the US alone 250 million with symptoms
[1277.92 - 1282.76] and
[1279.28 - 1284.36] conditions okay and I'm just going to be
[1282.76 - 1285.36] straightforward science of research
[1284.36 - 1286.88] doesn't even have their finger on the
[1285.36 - 1289.16] pulse they still think autoimmune is the
[1286.88 - 1290.80] body attacking itself it's unbelievable
[1289.16 - 1292.32] if you want to learn more about that get
[1290.80 - 1293.88] thyroid healing my book thyroid healing
[1292.32 - 1295.12] if you don't have my books here's some
[1293.88 - 1296.60] someone said this the other day that
[1295.12 - 1299.48] said why do I need your books I can
[1296.60 - 1301.36] listen to your radio shows I that that's
[1299.48 - 1302.76] that's that's unbelievable because the I
[1301.36 - 1305.20] can't cover a fraction of what's in the
[1302.76 - 1307.76] books in these radio shows I just can't
[1305.20 - 1310.36] it's not even possible so thyroid
[1307.76 - 1312.32] healing talks about the autoimmune great
[1310.36 - 1314.56] mistake that we have right now that's
[1312.32 - 1317.28] going on that that you know someone I
[1314.56 - 1318.84] think someone was saying to me like I
[1317.28 - 1320.00] I'm kind of upset at you and I said what
[1318.84 - 1322.40] are you talking about you're upset at me
[1320.00 - 1325.80] what do you mean and they said well my
[1322.40 - 1328.32] body is attacking itself I said what and
[1325.80 - 1329.96] they go my body is attacking itself and
[1328.32 - 1331.80] you're wrong because my body's attacking
[1329.96 - 1333.20] itself I was diagnosed with an
[1331.80 - 1335.36] autoimmune disease and my body is
[1333.20 - 1336.96] attacking itself how dare you say your
[1335.36 - 1339.56] body's not attacking
[1336.96 - 1343.24] itself and it it would it just blew me
[1339.56 - 1346.40] away actually it blew me away it totally
[1343.24 - 1348.76] did the body attacks a virus not the
[1346.40 - 1351.04] body tissue not the not the body cells I
[1348.76 - 1352.16] talk about it in great detail in thyroid
[1351.04 - 1354.68] healing and I've talked about it on
[1352.16 - 1356.52] shows too it's not attacking a single
[1354.68 - 1358.08] cell in the body your immune system is
[1356.52 - 1359.88] working for you it's not working against
[1358.08 - 1362.64] you on any level it gives people
[1359.88 - 1364.20] tremendous tremendous tremendous relief
[1362.64 - 1365.52] and gets them healing especially what
[1364.20 - 1366.56] they know what to do with their automine
[1365.52 - 1368.24] especially when they know how to heal
[1366.56 - 1369.52] their thyroid finally especially when
[1368.24 - 1370.92] they know how to heal themselves from
[1369.52 - 1374.20] lupus especially when they know how to
[1370.92 - 1376.68] heal themselves from ra and everything
[1374.20 - 1378.20] else so when someone gets all upset
[1376.68 - 1380.00] because they they like the fact that
[1378.20 - 1381.00] their body's attacking itself I I don't
[1380.00 - 1384.64] get that
[1381.00 - 1386.48] one I don't get that one I really don't
[1384.64 - 1388.40] so I was just like okay okay all right
[1386.48 - 1389.84] fine sorry sorry your body's hacking
[1388.40 - 1392.16] itself okay
[1389.84 - 1394.00] fine you know you know the thing is is
[1392.16 - 1396.60] is is
[1394.00 - 1398.64] uh the thing is that when it comes down
[1396.60 - 1400.32] to chronic illness like I was saying
[1398.64 - 1401.80] very little is known about any of it
[1400.32 - 1404.48] there's plenty of fancy
[1401.80 - 1405.48] names okay and but you have to
[1404.48 - 1407.28] understand something the science and
[1405.48 - 1409.04] research behind chronic illness and what
[1407.28 - 1410.72] is out there and the studies and whatnot
[1409.04 - 1412.92] that are out there and everything they
[1410.72 - 1414.32] are paid for and they are funded for all
[1412.92 - 1416.52] the wrong directions for all the wrong
[1414.32 - 1418.76] reasons that's the way the system is
[1416.52 - 1420.92] built and guess what it funnels itself
[1418.76 - 1424.80] down to UTI and urinari tract infections
[1420.92 - 1427.04] you better believe it it really does
[1424.80 - 1429.00] where are we today with UTI you either
[1427.04 - 1430.68] get an antibiotic or you get a steroid
[1429.00 - 1432.44] and see you later hopefully it goes away
[1430.68 - 1434.00] someday that's where we are chronic
[1432.44 - 1435.28] illness with science and research go to
[1434.00 - 1436.48] an alternative doctor he might give you
[1435.28 - 1437.96] an herb or two he might give you some
[1436.48 - 1439.96] cranberry extract he might give you
[1437.96 - 1441.84] something might she might give you this
[1439.96 - 1443.36] whatever but in the end they're still
[1441.84 - 1446.12] not going to know it's really strep and
[1443.36 - 1447.64] it's it's in it's in it's in the system
[1446.12 - 1449.68] and it's deep in the system and it has
[1447.64 - 1451.16] to be warded out it has to be weeded out
[1449.68 - 1452.72] it has to come out of your system you
[1451.16 - 1454.16] got to kill off the strep you got to not
[1452.72 - 1456.60] feed it and that's another thing you got
[1454.16 - 1459.40] to learn to not feed the strep in order
[1456.60 - 1461.96] to get better from UTI
[1459.40 - 1464.04] UTI okay that keep on coming and coming
[1461.96 - 1466.36] and coming the bacteria is feeding off
[1464.04 - 1467.84] of something it really likes whether
[1466.36 - 1469.60] it's feeding off of something it really
[1467.84 - 1471.24] likes inside the liver whether it's
[1469.60 - 1472.64] feeding it's feeding off of something it
[1471.24 - 1475.08] really likes it's coming from other
[1472.64 - 1476.72] places the kidneys you know and and
[1475.08 - 1479.48] because it's it's all getting through
[1476.72 - 1481.80] osmosis all you know the way the body
[1479.48 - 1484.64] eliminates both the intestinal tract and
[1481.80 - 1486.48] the kidneys and there's fuel for the
[1484.64 - 1488.84] bacteria to
[1486.48 - 1492.64] thrive and here's the
[1488.84 - 1494.80] thing the yeast with yeast infections is
[1492.64 - 1499.76] just kind of a little outer
[1494.80 - 1502.76] sign then you got strep ins inside okay
[1499.76 - 1504.48] inside the reproductive system then you
[1502.76 - 1507.68] got it inside the
[1504.48 - 1509.68] gut and it that's how it
[1507.68 - 1511.92] works and then you have a little bit
[1509.68 - 1514.12] inside the liver and and that's how it
[1511.92 - 1516.68] works it's not scary there's nothing
[1514.12 - 1518.16] scary about it in fact it's great
[1516.68 - 1519.80] because when you know what's up we're
[1518.16 - 1521.20] going to do some strep killing we're
[1519.80 - 1522.92] going to kick its butt we're going to
[1521.20 - 1524.24] knock it out of the system you're not
[1522.92 - 1525.60] going to have to deal with the sty
[1524.24 - 1527.80] anymore you're not going to have to deal
[1525.60 - 1529.44] with the sinus infections anymore you're
[1527.80 - 1531.40] not going to have to deal with the UTI
[1529.44 - 1533.56] all that will minimize and minimize and
[1531.40 - 1535.36] minimize and be less and less and less
[1533.56 - 1537.48] you'll get the antibiotics out of your
[1535.36 - 1539.32] system you'll get them out of your your
[1537.48 - 1540.96] your um your liver you'll get them out
[1539.32 - 1543.20] of your spine the antibiotics will start
[1540.96 - 1545.08] leaving your system so they won't even
[1543.20 - 1547.48] be able to feed the different varieties
[1545.08 - 1549.04] of strep that are mutated that that are
[1547.48 - 1552.36] actually mutated because of antibiotic
[1549.04 - 1553.92] use for you know over the century so all
[1552.36 - 1556.28] this is really
[1553.92 - 1559.48] important and you know so let's talk
[1556.28 - 1561.44] about severity of UTI okay um sometimes
[1559.48 - 1562.36] it's just a burning sometimes it's just
[1561.44 - 1564.92] a burning
[1562.36 - 1568.16] itching um sometimes it's a little bit
[1564.92 - 1569.36] of pain um urinating in general with the
[1568.16 - 1570.80] bladder sometimes you can have like
[1569.36 - 1572.80] bladder spasms going on where you're
[1570.80 - 1574.00] feeling bladder spasms sometimes you can
[1572.80 - 1575.36] have achy kidneys you could have
[1574.00 - 1577.96] achiness all over the body you could
[1575.36 - 1579.32] have a fever and different levels and
[1577.96 - 1581.28] different kinds and different kinds of
[1579.32 - 1582.68] strep cause different kinds of UTI and
[1581.28 - 1583.76] then you could have the bleeding too
[1582.68 - 1586.44] which is
[1583.76 - 1590.36] rupturing rupturing of tiny micro blood
[1586.44 - 1592.80] vessels cap lares that are rupturing and
[1590.36 - 1595.36] they're rupturing because of a bacterial
[1592.80 - 1596.92] overload and so the bacteria is causing
[1595.36 - 1598.16] rupturing in the little blood vessels
[1596.92 - 1600.00] next thing you know you're urinating
[1598.16 - 1602.16] blood
[1600.00 - 1604.24] everywhere so there's different levels
[1602.16 - 1605.76] of of how this could work some people
[1604.24 - 1607.80] they can also just get a really bad
[1605.76 - 1609.24] kidney strep infection for the first
[1607.80 - 1611.84] time it comes along with the worst case
[1609.24 - 1614.04] Amano they ever had and maybe they're in
[1611.84 - 1616.28] college or something or it's summer time
[1614.04 - 1618.20] and you know after after college is over
[1616.28 - 1619.60] and it's summertime and then a lot of
[1618.20 - 1622.68] women young women go through this where
[1619.60 - 1623.96] they have the worst the first UT UTI in
[1622.68 - 1625.56] their life it's the worst there's
[1623.96 - 1627.80] bleeding there's kidney infection
[1625.56 - 1629.88] there's fever they're they're at their
[1627.80 - 1631.96] pediatrician and if they still have a
[1629.88 - 1633.32] pediatrician most most people keep their
[1631.96 - 1636.60] pediatricians all the way until they
[1633.32 - 1638.32] like 20 now and then you know and or
[1636.60 - 1640.20] they end up at the ER they end up with
[1638.32 - 1641.76] an antibiotic some steroids they'll stay
[1640.20 - 1644.64] a night in a hospital if the fever's
[1641.76 - 1646.28] High um and then they'll go home and
[1644.64 - 1648.60] then that's their first you know kind of
[1646.28 - 1650.28] weird UTI with that weird UTI is that's
[1648.60 - 1652.24] a strep infection
[1650.28 - 1654.44] 100% so I'm trying to give you all the
[1652.24 - 1656.16] different scenarios before you know we
[1654.44 - 1658.60] got a little time we got a little time
[1656.16 - 1660.28] to burn as far as the I got plenty of
[1658.60 - 1661.36] things we're going to do for UTI but we
[1660.28 - 1662.68] have a little time to talk about the
[1661.36 - 1664.96] different scenarios the different
[1662.68 - 1666.52] severities and levels and then there's
[1664.96 - 1668.36] just regular like I said before it's
[1666.52 - 1672.04] just a little pain a little twitch a
[1668.36 - 1674.72] little nerve twitch um um little spasm
[1672.04 - 1677.68] when urinating a little itch a little
[1674.72 - 1679.20] burn um you know there's that too and
[1677.68 - 1680.64] there's that rundown feeling you can get
[1679.20 - 1682.44] with it too you can get kind of run down
[1680.64 - 1684.60] your throat gets a little kind of horse
[1682.44 - 1686.40] it gets a little uh little sore while
[1684.60 - 1688.64] you're getting like a
[1686.40 - 1690.32] UTI um happens with women a lot when
[1688.64 - 1692.16] they have their cycle right after right
[1690.32 - 1694.40] before their cycle they they get a UTI
[1692.16 - 1698.04] and it could happen each month and it
[1694.40 - 1699.80] can happen every six months but it does
[1698.04 - 1701.64] happen and it happens more than anybody
[1699.80 - 1703.96] knows and it happens all the time it's
[1701.64 - 1706.84] it's like if you if you can count how
[1703.96 - 1709.24] many from mild to severe UTI are
[1706.84 - 1711.84] occurring or East infection UTI are
[1709.24 - 1713.76] occurring just across the country at any
[1711.84 - 1716.20] given time you wouldn't believe what it
[1713.76 - 1718.96] would be it would be it would blow your
[1716.20 - 1721.04] mind and then if you know tack on sinus
[1718.96 - 1722.80] infections and also lung infections too
[1721.04 - 1724.52] there's a lot of lung problems people
[1722.80 - 1725.92] have where they have a chronic cough
[1724.52 - 1728.48] they go to doctors they take tons of
[1725.92 - 1730.00] antibiotics and they haven't had a flu
[1728.48 - 1731.64] they haven't had a cold or anything and
[1730.00 - 1733.64] they got this chronic wheezing chronic
[1731.64 - 1735.20] cough chronic lung problems that's also
[1733.64 - 1736.40] strep that sits inside the lungs for a
[1735.20 - 1738.32] lot of different people and that's a
[1736.40 - 1740.04] different variety of strep
[1738.32 - 1741.52] and that strep just incubates in lungs
[1740.04 - 1743.32] while you're taking antibiotics for it
[1741.52 - 1744.80] and whatever and it get just doesn't get
[1743.32 - 1746.56] it's becomes immune to different
[1744.80 - 1749.08] antibiotics and that's a different kind
[1746.56 - 1750.80] of strip but those people also get U
[1749.08 - 1754.36] periodically throughout life it's it's
[1750.80 - 1756.28] it's it's just all in our system and so
[1754.36 - 1757.92] now it's time what do we do and how do
[1756.28 - 1758.68] we you know fix this how do we get
[1757.92 - 1761.24] things
[1758.68 - 1764.04] better why does
[1761.24 - 1766.16] cranberry why does cranberry work why
[1764.04 - 1768.56] does cranberry work it must have worked
[1766.16 - 1771.56] at one point for
[1768.56 - 1773.88] someone right cranberry juice or
[1771.56 - 1775.52] Cranberry extract or cranberry pills or
[1773.88 - 1776.44] something it must have worked at one
[1775.52 - 1779.08] point for
[1776.44 - 1782.92] somebody keep in mind cranberry is a
[1779.08 - 1787.48] fruit cranberry is a fruit keep that in
[1782.92 - 1791.36] mind really important any fruit helps a
[1787.48 - 1794.36] UTI any fruit there's a reason for that
[1791.36 - 1797.16] the sugars and fruits can't feed any
[1794.36 - 1800.32] bacteria can't feed any virus can't feed
[1797.16 - 1801.88] any any yeast can't feed anything the
[1800.32 - 1805.40] sugars and
[1801.88 - 1809.44] fruits they can't feed anything bad but
[1805.40 - 1814.32] what they do is those sugars bond to
[1809.44 - 1816.28] bacterial killers they bond to bacterial
[1814.32 - 1820.32] killers and that
[1816.28 - 1822.88] bond is what knocks out bacteria that's
[1820.32 - 1825.24] what knocks out bacteria so for instance
[1822.88 - 1826.92] Elderberry syrup incredible for UTI
[1825.24 - 1829.96] taking Elderberry syrup got to get a
[1826.92 - 1831.44] really good one high quality one and you
[1829.96 - 1833.96] know you you get an Elderberry syrup you
[1831.44 - 1836.16] take a tablespoon Elderberry syrup you
[1833.96 - 1837.56] know one one tablespoon twice a day one
[1836.16 - 1839.48] tablespoon three times a day to help
[1837.56 - 1840.68] knock that UTI but that's not the only
[1839.48 - 1843.24] thing you could use it that it's a
[1840.68 - 1848.56] really mild UTI that could probably
[1843.24 - 1850.92] work and but the sugar in Elder
[1848.56 - 1854.48] berries is what does
[1850.92 - 1857.80] it the sugar wild blueberries work
[1854.48 - 1860.68] better for UTI than cranber
[1857.80 - 1865.28] does wild blueberries do they work
[1860.68 - 1868.24] better any fruit helps um knock out
[1865.28 - 1869.92] bacteria any fruit any all the way up to
[1868.24 - 1871.60] bananas so the fruit hating world is out
[1869.92 - 1873.92] of control more than ever before in
[1871.60 - 1876.44] history right now for no reason for no
[1873.92 - 1878.68] reason you know listen to the fruit fear
[1876.44 - 1880.80] show listen to that so you know what's
[1878.68 - 1883.68] going on it's actually it's Sinister
[1880.80 - 1886.16] it's actually Sinister so but that's
[1883.68 - 1889.80] cranberry knocks out
[1886.16 - 1891.56] bacteria and because antoin and not just
[1889.80 - 1893.00] that other phytochemical compounds that
[1891.56 - 1895.56] are
[1893.00 - 1898.60] antibacterial attach themselves to the
[1895.56 - 1900.40] sugar and it's this this sugar and the
[1898.60 - 1904.68] antoin or the phytochemical that kills
[1900.40 - 1908.56] off bacteria attached to the sugar enter
[1904.68 - 1910.56] cells easily they enter organs easily
[1908.56 - 1913.84] they enter hard to reach places where
[1910.56 - 1916.52] strep hides and
[1913.84 - 1918.96] incubates and that's how it works strep
[1916.52 - 1921.04] tries to burn burrow itself in the
[1918.96 - 1922.96] urethra it tries to burrow itself in the
[1921.04 - 1925.56] urinary tract it tries to burrow itself
[1922.96 - 1929.20] in the in the in the inner sides of the
[1925.56 - 1931.16] of the gallbladder nobody knows that
[1929.20 - 1932.32] nobody knows a strep makes pockets and
[1931.16 - 1935.36] that becomes
[1932.32 - 1937.44] cystitis down the road intercal
[1935.36 - 1939.44] cystitis that's just that's from years
[1937.44 - 1941.32] of having strep years and years and
[1939.44 - 1943.76] years of having strep in the wrong diet
[1941.32 - 1945.60] and having the wrong diet and the strep
[1943.76 - 1947.64] feeding off of dairy and feeding off of
[1945.60 - 1949.56] eggs or feeding off of a P of cheese on
[1947.64 - 1951.56] a pizza from 20 years or feeding off of
[1949.56 - 1953.44] you know goodies or feeding off of high
[1951.56 - 1955.40] fat foods even if it's healthy trendy
[1953.44 - 1957.92] high fat fat even if it's just straight
[1955.40 - 1960.64] keto high fat that's somewhat healthy
[1957.92 - 1962.80] whatever it is Strep loves lots of fats
[1960.64 - 1965.60] it loves lots of fat and it loves lots
[1962.80 - 1967.04] of it loves lots of also other things
[1965.60 - 1968.64] that are in Foods it loves what's in
[1967.04 - 1970.60] eggs it loves what's in that stuff it
[1968.64 - 1972.44] loves what's in corn it loves what it
[1970.60 - 1973.60] actually loves Woodson actually with in
[1972.44 - 1975.04] corn that's different than fruit
[1973.60 - 1977.56] entirely different corn is different
[1975.04 - 1980.04] than fruit it loves Woodson
[1977.56 - 1982.64] um a lot of these things loves what's in
[1980.04 - 1984.04] pork and so you know so when you have
[1982.64 - 1985.36] pork when you have bacon and you think
[1984.04 - 1988.20] Bacon's healthy or something you're
[1985.36 - 1990.12] having bacon that's just that just keeps
[1988.20 - 1991.80] strep around forever and eventually you
[1990.12 - 1993.36] get the you get the cystitis you get the
[1991.80 - 1995.92] interstial cystitis and this the
[1993.36 - 1997.32] bacteria build little pockets from
[1995.92 - 1999.40] Little Scar Tissue Pockets start
[1997.32 - 2000.92] building and the strep hides and these
[1999.40 - 2002.60] are cells that are hard to reach for
[2000.92 - 2004.56] anything and then when you dump in
[2002.60 - 2007.80] Cranberry you dump in Wild blueberry you
[2004.56 - 2011.04] dump in Elderberry in your system and it
[2007.80 - 2014.60] and and it goes into cells in hard to
[2011.04 - 2017.72] reach places excuse me hard to reach
[2014.60 - 2019.56] places and it gets in there deep and it
[2017.72 - 2021.24] starts pushing out the bacteria starts
[2019.56 - 2023.24] knocking it out it starts getting it out
[2021.24 - 2024.40] of there another thing that's in fruits
[2023.24 - 2025.48] like cranberry W blueberry and
[2024.40 - 2026.88] Elderberry and I'm just saying those
[2025.48 - 2028.24] three never mind a whole bunch of others
[2026.88 - 2030.16] I could be saying just tons of fruit
[2028.24 - 2032.48] whatever papaya whatever you know what's
[2030.16 - 2034.84] in there lots of vitamin C heavy loads
[2032.48 - 2037.48] of vitamin C guess what bacteria hates
[2034.84 - 2039.76] it hates vitamin C with avengeance with
[2037.48 - 2041.96] everything it's got it hates vitamin C
[2039.76 - 2043.32] because vitamin C not only feeds your
[2041.96 - 2045.08] lymphocytes your basophils your
[2043.32 - 2048.68] monocytes your neutrophils not only does
[2045.08 - 2051.04] it feed your immune system to go after
[2048.68 - 2055.28] strep and identify it tag it and and bag
[2051.04 - 2056.44] it not only does it have that ability to
[2055.28 - 2059.84] do all
[2056.44 - 2062.68] that but What vitamin c does it's
[2059.84 - 2065.24] poisonous it's a toxin to bacteria it's
[2062.68 - 2067.00] actually highly toxic to bacteria only
[2065.24 - 2069.44] That's What vitamin C is highly tox
[2067.00 - 2071.04] toxic to bacteria so when you have
[2069.44 - 2072.80] cranberry juice what's in cranberry
[2071.04 - 2074.20] juice you got this this this special
[2072.80 - 2075.68] vitamin C that's just just in
[2074.20 - 2077.44] cranberries that's just in Wild
[2075.68 - 2080.56] blueberry that's just an Elderberry that
[2077.44 - 2082.32] vitamin C is a toxin highly toxic to
[2080.56 - 2083.76] bacteria so these are some of the
[2082.32 - 2085.24] reasons why it works because people
[2083.76 - 2086.56] don't know why it works and they just
[2085.24 - 2088.88] don't
[2086.56 - 2092.52] know so that's what's happening there
[2088.88 - 2093.88] that's what's going on okay so another
[2092.52 - 2095.64] thing to understand when you're dealing
[2093.88 - 2098.72] with um when you're dealing with
[2095.64 - 2100.72] bacteria strep causing UTI is you don't
[2098.72 - 2102.60] want to feed it so back to those Foods
[2100.72 - 2104.92] you got to be on the no Foods if you're
[2102.60 - 2107.04] in you know if you're into uh if you're
[2104.92 - 2109.12] a big animal protein person then try to
[2107.04 - 2112.12] do the animal proteins that that that
[2109.12 - 2114.96] don't feed strep and try to keep it
[2112.12 - 2116.56] lowfat lots of leaner versions and not
[2114.96 - 2118.92] too many I would honestly if you're
[2116.56 - 2120.40] somebody dealing with UTI I would try to
[2118.92 - 2122.00] get off the animal protein for a little
[2120.40 - 2123.68] while and try to do something like the
[2122.00 - 2125.16] 28 day cleanse or try to do something
[2123.68 - 2127.24] you know my first book or try to do
[2125.16 - 2129.68] something and listen if if you're a
[2127.24 - 2132.88] vegan and you're plant-based and you got
[2129.68 - 2134.76] UTI get off the nuts just limit them
[2132.88 - 2137.84] they're really healthy but limit them
[2134.76 - 2139.76] limit your fat content don't eat so many
[2137.84 - 2143.40] avocados don't eat so many nuts and
[2139.76 - 2145.28] seeds don't me eat too many oils and and
[2143.40 - 2146.84] you know be cautious also of strange
[2145.28 - 2149.28] grains you know a lot of vegetarians
[2146.84 - 2152.56] they eat you know they still eat um
[2149.28 - 2153.76] different you know they eat like um
[2152.56 - 2155.44] Sprite of Buckwheat and they eat all
[2153.76 - 2157.88] kinds of other things that they eat and
[2155.44 - 2161.16] and that's fine but it's it's at the
[2157.88 - 2164.12] same time too many grains too much of it
[2161.16 - 2166.40] is not great for a UTI so that's another
[2164.12 - 2168.08] thing too so if you're a macrobiotic you
[2166.40 - 2169.64] know and all you do is eat GRS you know
[2168.08 - 2171.36] try to bring in more fruit and
[2169.64 - 2175.52] vegetables and leafy
[2171.36 - 2177.24] greens and limit the grains um
[2175.52 - 2179.32] especially the bad grains especially the
[2177.24 - 2181.80] bad ones all the gluten all the gluten
[2179.32 - 2183.20] varieties but here's the thing though
[2181.80 - 2185.36] it's it's it's like this and if you're a
[2183.20 - 2186.84] vegetarian just don't eat the eggs don't
[2185.36 - 2189.16] eat the eggs don't eat the cheese time
[2186.84 - 2190.40] to be if you're vegetarian you don't
[2189.16 - 2191.68] like meat and you're afraid to eat meat
[2190.40 - 2193.40] or it's not in your belief system or
[2191.68 - 2195.76] whatever it is then you you should go
[2193.40 - 2197.24] all the way plant-based I I'm you just
[2195.76 - 2198.88] should you should be getting rid of the
[2197.24 - 2199.72] eggs and get rid of the dairy if you
[2198.88 - 2203.00] have
[2199.72 - 2204.88] UTI if you're dealing with sinusitis if
[2203.00 - 2208.36] you're dealing with lung issues if
[2204.88 - 2209.48] you're dealing with sty if you're
[2208.36 - 2212.40] dealing with
[2209.48 - 2215.48] sio get off the eggs get off the dairy
[2212.40 - 2217.00] go plant-based if you're vegetarian I'm
[2215.48 - 2218.32] just being honest it's it's not about
[2217.00 - 2219.64] what side I'm picking on it's about
[2218.32 - 2221.16] what's right for the problem and that's
[2219.64 - 2222.72] what I'm trying to say I'm I don't I
[2221.16 - 2224.72] don't I'm not sucked into a belief
[2222.72 - 2226.64] system I'm not sucked into a belief
[2224.72 - 2229.04] system where you can't eat a grain or
[2226.64 - 2231.00] you you you you you can't eat a piece of
[2229.04 - 2233.20] chicken if your heart desires or if you
[2231.00 - 2235.76] or if you're all plant-based or all raw
[2233.20 - 2237.12] I don't I all you whatever you want to
[2235.76 - 2238.88] do but I'm going to tell you right now
[2237.12 - 2241.68] what you should do when it comes down to
[2238.88 - 2244.36] what's wrong with you in that moment and
[2241.68 - 2246.40] with UTI animal products keep them down
[2244.36 - 2248.20] low none of the dairy none of the eggs
[2246.40 - 2249.68] all that just throw all that out if
[2248.20 - 2251.76] you're eating meat I would probably
[2249.68 - 2253.60] consider just knocking that back keep it
[2251.76 - 2256.84] down to real small portions at different
[2253.60 - 2258.36] times and try to do other things and you
[2256.84 - 2259.80] know bring in other Foods bring in sweet
[2258.36 - 2262.36] potatoes bring in more of those bring in
[2259.80 - 2264.24] Winter squash bring in regular potatoes
[2262.36 - 2266.08] because guess what those don't feed
[2264.24 - 2268.12] strep either none of that feeds strep
[2266.08 - 2270.20] but if you have a high high fat diet
[2268.12 - 2272.20] really high fat content what you're
[2270.20 - 2274.12] every what's a high fat diet it's high
[2272.20 - 2276.64] protein just look out look out for that
[2274.12 - 2279.84] it's hidden under the word high protein
[2276.64 - 2282.04] then that's a high fat diet so you just
[2279.84 - 2283.80] got to look out you're having more fats
[2282.04 - 2285.48] than you even know and they're in the
[2283.80 - 2287.68] bloodstream they're in the body and they
[2285.48 - 2290.24] take on the intestinal lining they they
[2287.68 - 2292.12] Harbor strep and you just got to min
[2290.24 - 2293.76] minimize if you're vegan and plant-based
[2292.12 - 2295.04] you can't be doing four avocados a day
[2293.76 - 2296.48] unless it's the only food you have then
[2295.04 - 2298.44] it's totally fine if you got meaning
[2296.48 - 2300.52] like you can do four avocados a day but
[2298.44 - 2302.48] if you got UTI and you got strep and you
[2300.52 - 2305.28] got all the strep related stuff then
[2302.48 - 2307.12] back it down to one avocado a day back
[2305.28 - 2308.40] it down to one and a half AV as a day
[2307.12 - 2310.20] unless you're having a get together in a
[2308.40 - 2312.08] party then you know go to go go crazy
[2310.20 - 2313.24] with the guacamole if you're paleo or
[2312.08 - 2315.60] you're somebody that's totally in high
[2313.24 - 2317.40] protein animal protein you shouldn't be
[2315.60 - 2319.40] eating animal protein three times a day
[2317.40 - 2320.84] no way you if you got strep if you got
[2319.40 - 2322.68] UTI if you got all these different
[2320.84 - 2325.24] problems sorry it's never going to go go
[2322.68 - 2326.88] go go away completely 100% you got to
[2325.24 - 2328.76] you got to lower your animal proteins I
[2326.88 - 2330.32] hate saying that I'm sorry but it's true
[2328.76 - 2332.08] I don't care what fancy doctor what
[2330.32 - 2333.92] fancy belief system or trend is out
[2332.08 - 2335.24] there right now saying you know stay
[2333.92 - 2336.72] away from all fruit you should just be
[2335.24 - 2338.20] eating tons of animal protein I don't
[2336.72 - 2339.20] care what it is if you got UTI they
[2338.20 - 2340.92] don't know what the hell they're talking
[2339.20 - 2343.00] about and guess what that's is how it
[2340.92 - 2346.04] works in the industry nobody knows what
[2343.00 - 2348.52] they're talking about so here's the deal
[2346.04 - 2350.44] is yeah I'm sarcastic a little snarky
[2348.52 - 2352.60] today you know but here but but like I
[2350.44 - 2354.76] said I I like having people not having
[2352.60 - 2356.56] the pressure on them I like people being
[2354.76 - 2358.04] being getting the relief I want people
[2356.56 - 2360.12] better I want people to not have to
[2358.04 - 2361.60] worry about that UTI that's going to
[2360.12 - 2364.32] sneak up on them during their wedding
[2361.60 - 2366.04] day you know I'm I'm just you know I'm
[2364.32 - 2367.24] I'm or when they're the most important
[2366.04 - 2368.32] moment in life they're about to give a
[2367.24 - 2370.24] speech somewhere and they're getting the
[2368.32 - 2371.96] worst UTI they've ever had I've seen it
[2370.24 - 2374.28] over and over year after year out there
[2371.96 - 2376.24] in the old days I've seen it and even
[2374.28 - 2378.12] now people getting those UTI and they
[2376.24 - 2379.92] sneak up on them and and it just messes
[2378.12 - 2381.36] them up they can't have fun they they're
[2379.92 - 2382.96] going to a movie theater with friends
[2381.36 - 2384.20] and they got a UTI that's a problem and
[2382.96 - 2386.92] they're just they're not even watching
[2384.20 - 2389.16] the movie because they're in agony
[2386.92 - 2390.80] whatever I've seen it I've seen it all
[2389.16 - 2392.40] including some severe cases that got
[2390.80 - 2393.44] really bad in people and they've lived
[2392.40 - 2394.68] like that and they didn't have to
[2393.44 - 2397.64] anymore cuz they got the answers they
[2394.68 - 2399.44] knew what to do so with the diets you
[2397.64 - 2400.44] lower your animal protein to once a day
[2399.44 - 2403.28] that's what I would do if you're a big
[2400.44 - 2405.32] animal protein person big animal Pro you
[2403.28 - 2407.00] lower it down to once a day keep it
[2405.32 - 2408.36] small portion bring in more fruits bring
[2407.00 - 2409.48] in more vegetables leafy greens and
[2408.36 - 2411.68] we're going to talk about some herbs and
[2409.48 - 2414.16] vitamins too if you're if you're plant-
[2411.68 - 2416.44] paste and you're vegan um or raw just
[2414.16 - 2419.08] lower the fats don't do the oils maybe
[2416.44 - 2421.00] just a few hemp seeds are fine maybe
[2419.08 - 2422.72] just one and a half avocados a day maybe
[2421.00 - 2424.24] a teaspoon of coconut oil somewhere in
[2422.72 - 2425.60] there on on a salad or whatever it is
[2424.24 - 2429.00] you can you can heat it up and put it on
[2425.60 - 2430.92] a salad but you know just try to do much
[2429.00 - 2432.24] more fruit try to do more fruit
[2430.92 - 2434.56] different kinds of fruits try to do
[2432.24 - 2436.00] other things too um if you're Raw it's
[2434.56 - 2437.16] going to be all raw if you're a vegan
[2436.00 - 2438.96] that eats cooked it's going to be some
[2437.16 - 2440.36] Cooks to too the vegetables and
[2438.96 - 2442.76] everything
[2440.36 - 2446.92] else I'm not picking
[2442.76 - 2449.16] sides I'm seeing what's really going on
[2446.92 - 2450.80] from what has been given to me as a gift
[2449.16 - 2452.28] so that people can find their way and
[2450.80 - 2454.16] have the answers and know what's causing
[2452.28 - 2456.68] problems and know how to heal them and
[2454.16 - 2458.12] let me tell you something okay you know
[2456.68 - 2459.40] Spirit told me when I was younger that
[2458.12 - 2461.12] that was really important it was
[2459.40 - 2462.44] important to have that sight but I
[2461.12 - 2463.88] didn't think I was the only one in the
[2462.44 - 2465.72] industry to have that sight and it's
[2463.88 - 2467.20] still to this day with with everything
[2465.72 - 2468.76] that I'm seeing out there day and day
[2467.20 - 2469.84] out and the new books coming out and the
[2468.76 - 2472.48] new literature and what's on the
[2469.84 - 2474.52] Internet it's like oh my God everybody's
[2472.48 - 2476.48] still blind and I want you to be able to
[2474.52 - 2477.92] see and know what to do for each
[2476.48 - 2479.08] condition and these these radio shows
[2477.92 - 2480.28] we're going to be doing there these are
[2479.08 - 2482.64] going to get really intense and we're
[2480.28 - 2484.20] going to do more and more of them and
[2482.64 - 2485.60] we're just going to be rocking the truth
[2484.20 - 2487.20] and putting the truth out more and more
[2485.60 - 2489.92] like never before
[2487.20 - 2492.00] for so the bottom line is this what else
[2489.92 - 2494.00] can we do for UTI one thing is
[2492.00 - 2496.64] everybody's got a zinc deficiency yes
[2494.00 - 2499.12] they have a zinc deficiency and the zinc
[2496.64 - 2500.68] attacking zinc is also been a trend oh
[2499.12 - 2502.00] it's going to get rid of all your copper
[2500.68 - 2503.24] oh you're not going to have any copper
[2502.00 - 2505.44] oh you can't take zinc you're going to
[2503.24 - 2508.24] lose all your copper first of all I
[2505.44 - 2510.48] can't tell you how wrong that is number
[2508.24 - 2512.44] one we have so much copper in our system
[2510.48 - 2514.80] it's the one mineral we can't get away
[2512.44 - 2518.52] from we have so much of it it even gets
[2514.80 - 2520.72] us sick there's so much copper in food
[2518.52 - 2523.56] I'm talking about levels of toxic copper
[2520.72 - 2526.28] in food not to mention good copper in
[2523.56 - 2528.48] food there's so much of it abound you
[2526.28 - 2530.76] can't even lose it if you want it to in
[2528.48 - 2532.84] fact you need to get rid of some because
[2530.76 - 2536.12] it can keep you sick and knock down your
[2532.84 - 2539.52] immune system and it hurts you copper
[2536.12 - 2542.16] actually hurts you it doesn't help you
[2539.52 - 2544.48] it hurts you it's an IT copper is
[2542.16 - 2546.84] riddled on every conventional piece of
[2544.48 - 2549.84] of food that exists on the Planet
[2546.84 - 2552.36] riddled in Copper never mind even
[2549.84 - 2555.24] organic food has copper in it naturally
[2552.36 - 2558.52] copper is not deficient in our soil in
[2555.24 - 2560.84] fact it is it is overabundance and
[2558.52 - 2562.24] copper is a serious problem too when you
[2560.84 - 2564.28] have too much copper your liver builds
[2562.24 - 2566.08] up all this copper it causes eczema
[2564.28 - 2569.00] psoriasis it causes all these problems
[2566.08 - 2570.80] with people so when people out there
[2569.00 - 2572.40] would you hear it from everybody oh
[2570.80 - 2575.64] watch the zinc oh it's going to get rid
[2572.40 - 2577.92] your copper another another theory that
[2575.64 - 2579.84] was paid for somewhere with some thumb
[2577.92 - 2581.52] on the scale while back and some study
[2579.84 - 2584.88] put out there why because if you become
[2581.52 - 2587.00] zinc deficient you get sick and I I
[2584.88 - 2590.60] believe I
[2587.00 - 2593.24] believe that keeping everybody sick is
[2590.60 - 2595.76] probably on somebody's agenda out there
[2593.24 - 2598.44] in the world and I have good reason to
[2595.76 - 2600.40] believe CU I got a source that tells me
[2598.44 - 2604.12] and it's
[2600.40 - 2606.48] spirit Spirit tells me and not just that
[2604.12 - 2609.24] I got other sources too and anyway the
[2606.48 - 2611.08] bottom line is the bottom line is copper
[2609.24 - 2612.80] it you know when you take zinc and you
[2611.08 - 2614.48] take the right kind of zinc the zinc I
[2612.80 - 2615.64] talk about the zinc that's on my website
[2614.48 - 2617.64] if you go to my website and you go to
[2615.64 - 2619.36] the supplemental directory I don't I
[2617.64 - 2620.64] it's not that I'm selling supplements I
[2619.36 - 2624.00] don't I try to get you there where you
[2620.64 - 2625.64] need to go you go to my supplement um uh
[2624.00 - 2627.32] directory you find the right kind of
[2625.64 - 2629.32] zinc you build your immune system up and
[2627.32 - 2631.16] you'll have less UTI and less UTI
[2629.32 - 2633.48] because guess what when you when you
[2631.16 - 2635.16] have the zinc in your system the strep
[2633.48 - 2636.44] is going to lower and lower and
[2635.16 - 2637.44] naturally lower it's not going to be
[2636.44 - 2639.60] able to function it's not going to be
[2637.44 - 2642.28] able to do what it needs to
[2639.60 - 2644.68] do and that's what I'm talking
[2642.28 - 2647.12] about guess what strep can feed off of
[2644.68 - 2649.76] though can feed off high amounts of
[2647.12 - 2652.20] copper so it's it you shouldn't be
[2649.76 - 2654.64] afraid of a little bit of zinc the very
[2652.20 - 2657.88] thing that actually helps stop strep and
[2654.64 - 2661.44] stop the UTI I've seen it save people
[2657.88 - 2662.76] from Agony actual Agony it's one it's
[2661.44 - 2664.36] it's deficient in the soil there's no
[2662.76 - 2665.76] zinc in the soil I don't care if it's
[2664.36 - 2670.00] the best organic farm there's no zinc in
[2665.76 - 2670.76] the soil oil there isn't zinc is gone
[2670.00 - 2672.96] been
[2670.76 - 2675.92] obliterated been obliterated because of
[2672.96 - 2677.36] f Fallout from World War II from the
[2675.92 - 2679.64] from the you know the
[2677.36 - 2682.00] bomb okay that's still in the air coming
[2679.64 - 2684.20] down every day every day it never came
[2682.00 - 2685.60] down it's still up there just floating
[2684.20 - 2686.88] around the atmosphere just floating
[2685.60 - 2688.80] around just floating around floating
[2686.88 - 2692.60] around and dropping slowly Non-Stop and
[2688.80 - 2694.28] what it does is that Fallout in the in
[2692.60 - 2696.08] the minute forms that it's dropping
[2694.28 - 2697.52] non-stop in all the fields and all all
[2696.08 - 2698.96] the even the organic fields and
[2697.52 - 2700.88] everything else what it does is it
[2698.96 - 2703.28] cancels out zinc gets in the soil and it
[2700.88 - 2706.04] cancels out zinc science and research
[2703.28 - 2708.04] doesn't realize that that Fallout is is
[2706.04 - 2710.88] diminishing zinc to the point of of not
[2708.04 - 2712.16] being in our in our in our food supply
[2710.88 - 2714.12] so don't be afraid of taking a little
[2712.16 - 2716.24] bit of zinc if you're sensitive just try
[2714.12 - 2717.72] to switch off maybe to a good capsule I
[2716.24 - 2719.76] got a I got a capsule zinc on the
[2717.72 - 2723.48] directory too the liquid one is the one
[2719.76 - 2726.56] I like the liquid ones the right
[2723.48 - 2729.36] kind so and just don't run off and get
[2726.56 - 2731.32] any old zinc it might be loaded with
[2729.36 - 2733.24] citric acid or something they put like
[2731.32 - 2734.60] two parts citric acid in some of those
[2733.24 - 2736.44] zinc bottles it's the worst thing I've
[2734.60 - 2738.48] ever seen or it might be loaded with
[2736.44 - 2740.20] something else or it might not be a zinc
[2738.48 - 2741.52] supplement it might be a zinc with 20
[2740.20 - 2743.32] other minerals so you're getting like
[2741.52 - 2745.16] this much zinc but 20 other minerals
[2743.32 - 2747.40] just try not to get confused and pick up
[2745.16 - 2749.32] the wrong thing CU it's not going to
[2747.40 - 2752.64] help but you need that for the UTI you
[2749.32 - 2753.96] need the zinc okay so that's number one
[2752.64 - 2756.88] number two let's do some herbs I
[2753.96 - 2759.44] Bright's a great one for UTI ibite is a
[2756.88 - 2762.32] great one propolis that's a great one so
[2759.44 - 2764.04] ibrite propolis okay lemon balb that's
[2762.32 - 2766.00] amazing that's a that's amazing one for
[2764.04 - 2768.12] maintenance you could be on that as a
[2766.00 - 2770.24] maintenance to actually fend off strep
[2768.12 - 2772.72] so that you don't get a UTI or any other
[2770.24 - 2775.12] type of thing I'm talking about so
[2772.72 - 2777.64] that's a great one all right I like
[2775.12 - 2778.40] licorice root on and off you can do that
[2777.64 - 2782.00] for
[2778.40 - 2784.04] UTI that does help with strep it does
[2782.00 - 2785.60] help and then and then um let's see what
[2784.04 - 2787.04] else olive leaf that's a great one to
[2785.60 - 2789.60] have the Elderberry I talked about
[2787.04 - 2792.24] before Oregon grap root Oregon grape
[2789.60 - 2794.76] root that's a good one for
[2792.24 - 2797.84] UTI couple of dropperfuls of that twice
[2794.76 - 2799.00] a day and dosages wise you can go look
[2797.84 - 2800.48] you can talk to your practitioner talk
[2799.00 - 2802.80] to your practitioner about dosages talk
[2800.48 - 2805.08] to your practitioner whatever but I mean
[2802.80 - 2807.48] if if it was me and I had a UTI which
[2805.08 - 2810.28] I've never had in my life but if I had
[2807.48 - 2812.72] one okay and and I you know and I hope I
[2810.28 - 2814.36] never get one and you know if I but if I
[2812.72 - 2816.32] did have one I'd be doing like two
[2814.36 - 2818.24] dropper FS twice a day
[2816.32 - 2819.92] of the orgon graef rooot I would do
[2818.24 - 2821.36] probably when if I had the UTI in the
[2819.92 - 2823.76] moment I'd probably be doing like four
[2821.36 - 2826.20] dropper fulls of golden seal golden seal
[2823.76 - 2829.08] three times a day I'd do three dropper
[2826.20 - 2831.00] fulls twice a day a lemon balm I would
[2829.08 - 2833.00] do you know olive leaf two dropper FS
[2831.00 - 2835.84] twice a day I would do one tablespoon of
[2833.00 - 2837.68] Elderberry three times a day yeah sure
[2835.84 - 2839.40] i' I'd probably take a cranberry extract
[2837.68 - 2841.00] why not I'll probably be eating up in my
[2839.40 - 2844.56] wild blueberries
[2841.00 - 2847.44] too vitamin C I'd be doing six eight
[2844.56 - 2848.72] capsules of Ester SE twice a day and if
[2847.44 - 2850.40] you're sensitive and you can't do these
[2848.72 - 2852.28] dosages of course I'm not saying to do
[2850.40 - 2854.60] these dosages at all this is just what I
[2852.28 - 2855.88] would do but if you're sensitive
[2854.60 - 2857.72] whatever you go to your practitioner you
[2855.88 - 2861.52] take one capsule of vitamin C you take
[2857.72 - 2864.40] five drops of of lemon bomb if you
[2861.52 - 2865.84] want but but I would be doing all those
[2864.40 - 2867.24] so so you're getting the list down I'm
[2865.84 - 2868.36] trying to think is there anything else
[2867.24 - 2870.12] in the list that'd be really good you
[2868.36 - 2872.80] got the vitamin C that's a big
[2870.12 - 2874.60] deal that's a a big one you can do monol
[2872.80 - 2875.80] Lauren sometimes that helps sometimes it
[2874.60 - 2877.00] doesn't but it's worth throwing in in
[2875.80 - 2880.08] there if you're really dealing with or
[2877.00 - 2882.68] suffering with UTI in a bad way you can
[2880.08 - 2887.64] definitely do that throw some monolaurin
[2882.68 - 2889.48] in there that's okay um sure absolutely
[2887.64 - 2892.96] nettle leaf that has a maintenance to
[2889.48 - 2895.52] help keep strep back nett Leaf is great
[2892.96 - 2898.04] that's a good one um turmeric that's a
[2895.52 - 2900.36] great one for UTI too it can help keep U
[2898.04 - 2902.88] Back turmeric is a great one ccin or
[2900.36 - 2904.64] cumin or however you want to say it
[2902.88 - 2908.04] that's a great one also for
[2904.64 - 2911.20] UTI so these are some of the options um
[2908.04 - 2913.16] I like Oregon grape root like I said and
[2911.20 - 2915.56] um I like the golden seal I like the
[2913.16 - 2916.68] olive leaf I like the lemon bomb I like
[2915.56 - 2919.32] the
[2916.68 - 2922.16] ibrite okay and the Elderberry you know
[2919.32 - 2924.08] bring all those in and they can really
[2922.16 - 2927.20] help the propolis that's a big one too
[2924.08 - 2929.88] like I said earlier that's a big one and
[2927.20 - 2931.84] you know what happens is it if you have
[2929.88 - 2933.56] one coming on you just Hammer everything
[2931.84 - 2935.20] you bring it in you bring it in and then
[2933.56 - 2937.48] you when when it's gone you can keep a
[2935.20 - 2938.80] maintenance of a little bit of zinc a
[2937.48 - 2941.32] maintenance a little bit of zinc maybe a
[2938.80 - 2943.48] little bit of Elderberry and some lemon
[2941.32 - 2944.84] balm keep maintenance as you're cleaning
[2943.48 - 2946.56] your Foods up making sure you're not
[2944.84 - 2947.72] eating Foods if like I said make sure
[2946.56 - 2949.84] you're not eating too much fat if you're
[2947.72 - 2951.28] on a high protein animal diet lower them
[2949.84 - 2953.68] bring in more fruits and
[2951.28 - 2956.76] vegetables okay I love it how the
[2953.68 - 2958.40] experts now the other experts out there
[2956.76 - 2960.24] whatever so-called experts I love how
[2958.40 - 2962.44] they pull this where they're starting to
[2960.24 - 2964.20] see finally for the first time ever in
[2962.44 - 2966.12] the history of their their practices and
[2964.20 - 2967.56] what they're doing they're seeing that
[2966.12 - 2968.84] people are getting better by remove
[2967.56 - 2971.08] first of all they see when you remove
[2968.84 - 2972.36] the dairy and the and and the gluten and
[2971.08 - 2973.88] they see people getting a little better
[2972.36 - 2975.68] but then they realize they're lowering
[2973.88 - 2977.16] the animal proteins a little bit some
[2975.68 - 2978.68] some belief systems are shifting and
[2977.16 - 2980.56] they're actually lowering the animal
[2978.68 - 2982.44] proteins and they're bringing in just
[2980.56 - 2984.16] more more more vegetables and leafy
[2982.44 - 2987.48] greens but they're lowering the animal
[2984.16 - 2989.12] proteins and and Eureka they think they
[2987.48 - 2992.08] struck gold because people are getting a
[2989.12 - 2993.64] little better and a little better yep
[2992.08 - 2996.12] you know what I was doing that 30 years
[2993.64 - 2997.88] ago 30 years ago
[2996.12 - 3001.00] there are people out there right now at
[2997.88 - 3002.56] the age 60 65 that have lived great
[3001.00 - 3006.60] lives because they got that information
[3002.56 - 3007.92] 30 35 years ago from me okay you you the
[3006.60 - 3009.40] thing is the experts don't know it's
[3007.92 - 3010.60] because they're lowering the fats they
[3009.40 - 3013.60] don't understand it when you lower the
[3010.60 - 3016.08] fats the fats the high fat feed bacteria
[3013.60 - 3017.92] and viruses and they hide bacteria and
[3016.08 - 3019.92] viruses so what I'm saying is if you
[3017.92 - 3022.08] still want to be on high protein just
[3019.92 - 3023.96] lower the amounts if you still want to
[3022.08 - 3026.12] be plant-based lower the amounts of nuts
[3023.96 - 3027.88] and seeds lower the amounts of um of
[3026.12 - 3029.36] fats in other ways and oils and stuff
[3027.88 - 3032.08] like just lower bring it down bring in
[3029.36 - 3033.92] more fruits bringing more leafy greens
[3032.08 - 3035.32] bringing if look if you're if you're if
[3033.92 - 3037.56] you're not all raw and you're cooked
[3035.32 - 3039.36] then bring in cooked vegetables bring in
[3037.56 - 3041.92] potatoes and they could be really
[3039.36 - 3046.64] helpful and keep the bacteria down so it
[3041.92 - 3046.64] can't eat and Thrive it can't eat and
[3046.88 - 3053.68] Thrive so look the bottom line is it's
[3051.04 - 3056.80] about you getting stronger healthier
[3053.68 - 3058.96] about you avoiding calamity
[3056.80 - 3061.88] it's about you know avoiding adversity
[3058.96 - 3065.16] in your life it's about just getting
[3061.88 - 3068.20] away from the bad lands and getting into
[3065.16 - 3069.40] the good lands and moving forward and
[3068.20 - 3072.68] knowing what to
[3069.40 - 3073.64] do so you know when it comes down to ETI
[3072.68 - 3075.44] and when it comes down to yeast
[3073.64 - 3078.24] infections too you still want to do
[3075.44 - 3080.56] these things you still want to do these
[3078.24 - 3083.40] things because the this because there's
[3080.56 - 3085.76] an underlying strep Factor going on with
[3083.40 - 3087.80] bacterial vaginosis yeah it you know
[3085.76 - 3089.72] that that too you want to do these
[3087.80 - 3092.24] things to get that bacteria down and you
[3089.72 - 3095.16] want to do the foods and get the foods
[3092.24 - 3098.92] better and better the the most the most
[3095.16 - 3102.36] bug feeding food there is is eggs it's
[3098.92 - 3107.28] the most bug feeding food on the planet
[3102.36 - 3110.24] it feeds every bug that isn't good is
[3107.28 - 3111.44] what it does it feeds every single
[3110.24 - 3115.12] variety of
[3111.44 - 3118.24] strep it the strep was actually raised
[3115.12 - 3120.92] in Labs a long time ago and somehow got
[3118.24 - 3123.48] out of the labs and into our bodies
[3120.92 - 3126.56] that's interesting that's
[3123.48 - 3129.32] interesting that that strep was raised
[3126.56 - 3132.28] and guess what it was raised on it was
[3129.32 - 3134.28] raised on egg that's what it was raised
[3132.28 - 3137.64] on that was his food
[3134.28 - 3139.64] Choice guess what's in some antibiotics
[3137.64 - 3141.84] egg believe it or
[3139.64 - 3144.12] not and there's all kinds of things in
[3141.84 - 3146.24] antibiotics petroleum you know engine
[3144.12 - 3147.68] oil you name it that's all that's
[3146.24 - 3149.96] actually all in antibiotics the
[3147.68 - 3151.32] petroleum the engine oil you name it
[3149.96 - 3153.16] it's not that you can't take an
[3151.32 - 3155.12] antibiotic in a crisis situation because
[3153.16 - 3157.08] you've gotten there it's about doing
[3155.12 - 3159.44] everything else so eventually that
[3157.08 - 3161.48] crisis situation doesn't come and hit
[3159.44 - 3164.20] you and goes away and you see it go by
[3161.48 - 3167.00] and you You Kiss It Goodbye you said bye
[3164.20 - 3168.20] and you wave It Goodbye so it's gone and
[3167.00 - 3171.04] gone for
[3168.20 - 3172.44] good and that's what you want to do
[3171.04 - 3174.12] that's what you want to do and if you're
[3172.44 - 3175.56] worried about getting a UTI someday and
[3174.12 - 3176.92] you've never had one and you might have
[3175.56 - 3178.76] something else cooking like a little bit
[3176.92 - 3181.24] of sibo you think your doctor thinks or
[3178.76 - 3183.00] believes or you got something else going
[3181.24 - 3184.64] on like a little bit of gastritis
[3183.00 - 3186.40] because gastritis is also something
[3184.64 - 3189.24] that's caused by strep some of the it's
[3186.40 - 3192.72] chronic gastritis and bloating
[3189.24 - 3195.64] constipation bloating gastritis all that
[3192.72 - 3197.52] has strep behind it if you think that's
[3195.64 - 3201.00] what's going on let's start going
[3197.52 - 3203.72] anti-strep and start knocking this stuff
[3201.00 - 3205.48] down and we can do it simply if this is
[3203.72 - 3207.88] too overwhelming and I've given you too
[3205.48 - 3210.20] much you start small and you start with

[3230.96 - 3234.52] feel amazing in there now I talk to
[3233.32 - 3236.20] plant-based people and they're like I've
[3234.52 - 3237.48] never felt better in my entire life I've
[3236.20 - 3239.36] been sick for 30 years I went
[3237.48 - 3240.72] plant-based I can't believe it I've
[3239.36 - 3242.88] gotten everything better it's the
[3240.72 - 3245.28] greatest thing in the world so they
[3242.88 - 3246.72] don't feel stuck in it and then you got
[3245.28 - 3248.20] people that are in some other belief
[3246.72 - 3249.72] system or they're in a belief system and
[3248.20 - 3250.92] they're they're not feeling good they

[3252.04 - 3256.56] they're stuck in it because they can't
[3253.36 - 3259.72] get out of it whatever it is just lower
[3256.56 - 3262.44] the fat intake so that the strep can't
[3259.72 - 3264.52] feed off of that hide or pilate

[3273.96 - 3278.36] Caked Up in the intestinal tract in the
[3275.76 - 3281.72] walls and turns rancid and putrid it
[3278.36 - 3283.96] gets inside the bladder we urinate fat
[3281.72 - 3286.96] out of our body we urinate fat out of
[3283.96 - 3289.20] our body we actually do and what happens
[3286.96 - 3291.84] is it builds up in the bladder lining
[3289.20 - 3294.16] and it Shields strap all the time
