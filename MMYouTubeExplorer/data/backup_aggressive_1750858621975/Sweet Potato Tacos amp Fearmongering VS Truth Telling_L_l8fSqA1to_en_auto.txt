[62.88 - 67.08] uh and peer pressuring intense peer
[66.08 - 70.32] pressuring
[67.08 - 73.20] gaslighting fear mongering
[70.32 - 75.04] right the whole bit the thing is is you
[73.20 - 76.56] ever run into anybody you guys have you
[75.04 - 78.32] ever run into anybody that just they
[76.56 - 82.24] weren't ready

[82.24 - 89.44] you know to do what they needed to do
[86.32 - 90.96] you know they weren't ready to
[89.44 - 92.48] take care of themselves like they needed
[90.96 - 94.48] to do right you know
[92.48 - 95.84] they're still doing the whole in
[94.48 - 97.20] moderation
[95.84 - 98.96] i could still have a pizza on the

[113.20 - 118.24] step to free themselves right
[116.16 - 119.44] and someone's gonna be like hey you
[118.24 - 121.20] should be allowed to do whatever you

[128.72 - 132.40] be allowed to partake in things because

[142.08 - 146.08] you know we get told hey doing something
[145.04 - 148.16] is going to make us
[146.08 - 149.68] stronger getting exposure is going to
[148.16 - 150.96] make us stronger
[149.68 - 154.56] you know that's what we're told all the
[150.96 - 156.80] time michelle says gaslighting is
[154.56 - 158.48] his gas lighting is now wide right
[156.80 - 161.04] widespread out there
[158.48 - 162.64] it's all about gaslighting totally you
[161.04 - 164.08] know i met you know i remember
[162.64 - 166.00] a while back talking to somebody and
[164.08 - 167.84] they were and they're like
[166.00 - 170.16] yeah but wait a minute if i'm taking
[167.84 - 173.92] care of myself and eating so good so
[170.16 - 176.24] i'm eating so much good food and
[173.92 - 178.08] i'm watching out for my dairy products
[176.24 - 181.12] and i'm watching out for fried foods and
[178.08 - 184.40] i'm watching out for canola oil
[181.12 - 187.84] right i'm just i'm just making myself
[184.40 - 189.04] weaker i'm just making myself weaker
[187.84 - 190.32] because i was talking to somebody this
[189.04 - 192.48] person was telling me i was talking to
[190.32 - 194.64] somebody aw and they were like
[192.48 - 196.64] yeah you can have a little bit of this
[194.64 - 197.20] let your body experience a little bit of
[196.64 - 199.52] that
[197.20 - 201.36] you should have some chocolate who cares
[199.52 - 202.32] if you get a little canola oil in you in
[201.36 - 204.00] a treat
[202.32 - 205.84] you know you should be having some kind
[204.00 - 207.92] of chocolate treat you could have
[205.84 - 210.24] coffee if you want you could have a
[207.92 - 210.96] glass of wine you can have some alcohol
[210.24 - 212.64] right
[210.96 - 215.60] you could have a little bit of this in a
[212.64 - 218.64] little bit of that makes you stronger
[215.60 - 221.92] you get weaker if you
[218.64 - 224.64] you know if you push that away
[221.92 - 226.72] you get weaker if you you know if you
[224.64 - 230.24] keep that stuff out
[226.72 - 232.96] you become orthorexic right
[230.24 - 234.72] so that's another gaslighting term right
[232.96 - 236.08] so here you are you're trying to heal
[234.72 - 237.84] you're trying to take care of yourself
[236.08 - 239.44] because you don't feel good
[237.84 - 240.56] because you're sick and you don't feel
[239.44 - 242.00] good and you're trying to take care of
[240.56 - 243.28] yourself you're trying to heal
[242.00 - 244.56] and you're trying to eat right and
[243.28 - 246.00] you're trying to keep the gluten out and
[244.56 - 246.72] you're trying to keep the dairy products
[246.00 - 249.76] out
[246.72 - 251.28] and you're watching what you're eating
[249.76 - 252.72] and all of a sudden
[251.28 - 254.40] you know it's a lot of work to do that

[254.40 - 256.96] what you're eating we're really being
[256.16 - 260.00] censored today

[290.64 - 295.04] the oven
[291.20 - 298.48] too you guys but what you'll find is
[295.04 - 300.16] someone will think you know hey like
[298.48 - 302.00] i'm eating healthy i'm taking care of
[300.16 - 303.60] myself and then someone's going to come
[302.00 - 304.72] and sabotage them and say you're
[303.60 - 306.80] orthorexic
[304.72 - 308.00] and it's like wait what am i and they're
[306.80 - 310.00] being gas lit
[308.00 - 311.52] boom right there like the flames are
[310.00 - 314.40] happening right there
[311.52 - 314.96] like wait a minute what am i i'm i'm
[314.40 - 318.16] what
[314.96 - 320.32] orthorexic what's that you're obsessed
[318.16 - 321.68] about healthy food you're obsessed about
[320.32 - 324.96] eating healthy
[321.68 - 326.96] you're obsessed about healthy food right
[324.96 - 328.00] you know and you're just you're just
[326.96 - 330.56] obsessed
[328.00 - 332.24] that's a disease so now you've got the
[330.56 - 334.16] eating healthy disease
[332.24 - 335.36] so somebody will say that out there
[334.16 - 337.68] really really
[335.36 - 339.12] gas light the freaking hell out of
[337.68 - 340.96] someone so bad
[339.12 - 342.00] because that just clobbers you here you
[340.96 - 343.60] are you're trying to take care of
[342.00 - 344.24] yourself and it's hard job as it is
[343.60 - 346.00] right
[344.24 - 347.44] you don't feel good you got symptoms you
[346.00 - 348.80] got conditions
[347.44 - 351.12] you're working hard on trying to take
[348.80 - 352.00] care of yourself and somebody comes
[351.12 - 354.08] along and they got
[352.00 - 355.60] like gasoline and a lighter and they're
[354.08 - 356.88] just dumping it on you and they just
[355.60 - 359.92] light the flame
[356.88 - 361.36] is what they do and and they're doing it
[359.92 - 362.72] with a couple of different ways
[361.36 - 365.68] you'll either whether whether you're
[362.72 - 367.52] called orthorexic or something or
[365.68 - 369.36] if you're just like you're obsessed
[367.52 - 371.12] about food why are you so obsessed about
[369.36 - 372.80] food i don't need to be obsessed about
[371.12 - 374.56] food i could just live my life and not
[372.80 - 375.76] think about food and eat whatever i want
[374.56 - 377.12] when i want
[375.76 - 379.12] and then it makes you feel like a real
[377.12 - 380.00] piece of crap too that's one right there
[379.12 - 382.96] because a lot of people
[380.00 - 384.40] who aren't sick they aren't sick or they
[382.96 - 386.40] say they're sick
[384.40 - 388.16] but they're really not they get a little
[386.40 - 391.52] energy a little brain
[388.16 - 392.00] touch of brain fog little acne they see
[391.52 - 393.68] their
[392.00 - 395.92] different functional medicine doctors
[393.68 - 398.56] they stay out of the woods
[395.92 - 399.20] because they're not eating so so
[398.56 - 400.96] terrible
[399.20 - 402.72] and they're not sick yet they're not
[400.96 - 403.92] sick sick yet right
[402.72 - 405.76] and then they'll be the ones to be like
[403.92 - 408.00] i don't really think about food i don't
[405.76 - 411.20] really focus about food i live my life
[408.00 - 412.40] i'm a life liver not a food eater you
[411.20 - 414.88] focus on food
[412.40 - 416.32] you go focus on food there you know yeah
[414.88 - 418.00] you go worry about everything you're
[416.32 - 420.32] eating go worry about all your
[418.00 - 422.32] your lettuces worry about your tomatoes
[420.32 - 424.00] worried about all your stuff and
[422.32 - 425.60] i'll go live my life and have a glass of
[424.00 - 428.00] wine when i feel like it and i'll have a
[425.60 - 430.00] little pizza when i feel like it and
[428.00 - 431.92] you know you know i'll pick choices
[430.00 - 433.04] intuitively to what feels good in the
[431.92 - 434.56] moment but other than that i don't
[433.04 - 436.16] really think about food so it's another
[434.56 - 437.60] form of gas lighting right there
[436.16 - 439.68] it's another thing here they bring the
[437.60 - 441.52] gasoline container over and they got the
[439.68 - 442.56] lighter and they're dumping gasoline on
[441.52 - 444.64] you and they
[442.56 - 446.80] they hit the flame and that's how it
[444.64 - 447.52] works right and then the moderation gas
[446.80 - 449.44] lighting
[447.52 - 451.12] that that right there is a whole other
[449.44 - 453.12] another thing all on its own
[451.12 - 454.72] so it's like yeah you should be allowed
[453.12 - 456.88] to do moderation
[454.72 - 458.80] or you weaken your system i heard that
[456.88 - 461.92] one pretty recently like
[458.80 - 463.76] your system needs to be bombarded by all
[461.92 - 465.28] this crap out there you need to go out
[463.76 - 466.72] on the streets you need to breathe in
[465.28 - 470.96] all the smog
[466.72 - 473.04] you need to get exposed by germs
[470.96 - 475.04] you need to be licking your hands after
[473.04 - 477.76] you touch a hand door handle
[475.04 - 479.44] a doorknob so you walk into a place you
[477.76 - 480.48] touch the doorknob doesn't matter just
[479.44 - 483.12] lick your hand that
[480.48 - 484.16] that before the plague that's going
[483.12 - 485.92] around right now
[484.16 - 487.36] you know people just didn't even care
[485.92 - 489.84] they didn't even care just touching
[487.36 - 493.04] everything doesn't matter rub your eye
[489.84 - 496.48] you know it's like get exposed because
[493.04 - 500.00] it makes you stronger that is not true
[496.48 - 502.24] that is not true right so
[500.00 - 504.32] it's fear mongering saying look be
[502.24 - 506.40] cautious about that door handle
[504.32 - 507.60] you shouldn't have your finger in the
[506.40 - 509.60] taste tester
[507.60 - 511.12] at the grocery store you shouldn't be
[509.60 - 514.00] going into the grocery store
[511.12 - 515.20] and sticking your hand in the sample jar
[514.00 - 516.96] at the grocery store
[515.20 - 518.88] those little square pieces of cheese in
[516.96 - 520.08] the sample jar that everybody else have
[518.88 - 522.32] their hands in right before
[520.08 - 524.32] the plague before the plague now because
[522.32 - 526.56] they changed all the rules right
[524.32 - 528.40] and you stick your hand in that sample
[526.56 - 530.16] jar and you pop those little cheese
[528.40 - 531.76] squares in your mouth and now you're
[530.16 - 533.20] you're pushing your cart and you find
[531.76 - 535.04] another sample jar
[533.20 - 536.72] and you go and grab some of that right
[535.04 - 540.16] there right
[536.72 - 542.72] and next thing you know it right
[540.16 - 544.32] you're you're you're exposed but if
[542.72 - 545.12] someone said you shouldn't be sticking
[544.32 - 547.12] your hands
[545.12 - 548.16] truth-telling right truth-telling now
[547.12 - 549.92] okay
[548.16 - 551.76] truth-telling you shouldn't be sticking
[549.92 - 554.64] your hands in that sample jar
[551.76 - 555.44] at the grocery store all right and
[554.64 - 557.52] putting that
[555.44 - 559.36] stuff in your mouth you're gonna be
[557.52 - 560.96] throwing other people's streptococcus in
[559.36 - 561.28] your mouth you're gonna start be putting
[560.96 - 563.68] in
[561.28 - 565.60] other people's e coli you know someone
[563.68 - 568.16] just went to the bathroom
[565.60 - 569.28] and they wiped their butt they got feces
[568.16 - 571.04] on their hand
[569.28 - 572.96] and now they're reaching in that they're
[571.04 - 574.80] reaching in that little sample jar
[572.96 - 576.08] right there let me go in that sample let
[574.80 - 578.08] me oh pineapple
[576.08 - 580.24] with the pineapple with the toothpick
[578.08 - 580.56] stuck in it and a little piece of cheese
[580.24 - 582.24] there
[580.56 - 583.76] let me go grab that in the grocery store
[582.24 - 585.28] oh let me grab one too let me grab
[583.76 - 586.88] another one too
[585.28 - 588.56] meanwhile the person who prepared it
[586.88 - 590.48] also came out of the bathroom
[588.56 - 592.48] they wiped their butt who knows how good
[590.48 - 595.92] they wash their hands or if they why why
[592.48 - 598.48] they wash your hands at all and so
[595.92 - 599.44] that's truth telling right there that's
[598.48 - 601.84] true tally
[599.44 - 603.76] right you should never put any pain you
[601.84 - 604.32] should never put any paper on the toilet
[603.76 - 606.72] seat
[604.32 - 608.00] that's being totally obsessive totally
[606.72 - 610.08] out of control
[608.00 - 611.60] you should never have to put toilet
[610.08 - 613.44] paper or any kind of paper
[611.60 - 615.04] protection on the toilet paper toilet
[613.44 - 617.44] seat in public restrooms
[615.04 - 618.16] just sit on the seat sit on the seat get
[617.44 - 620.96] exposed
[618.16 - 621.60] makes you stronger makes you stronger
[620.96 - 625.36] right
[621.60 - 626.88] true telling is don't be sitting on that
[625.36 - 630.64] toilet seat
[626.88 - 631.92] that somebody else sat on okay
[630.64 - 634.48] i can't tell you how many people have
[631.92 - 635.76] herpes on their butt you guys have no
[634.48 - 638.32] idea
[635.76 - 638.88] 30 plus years of doing the work that i'm
[638.32 - 641.12] doing
[638.88 - 643.04] doctors sending patients to me from all
[641.12 - 646.16] over the world right
[643.04 - 649.44] and and the amount of people that have
[646.16 - 653.44] herpes on their butt
[649.44 - 656.72] it's unbelievable right shingles breaks
[653.44 - 657.44] breakouts on their butt simplex one
[656.72 - 660.48] breakouts
[657.44 - 662.08] on their butt simplex tube breakouts on
[660.48 - 665.28] their butt
[662.08 - 668.80] strap on their butt but
[665.28 - 669.28] cheeks breakouts and pustules on their
[668.80 - 672.24] butt
[669.28 - 673.44] cheeks simplex and everything else dr
[672.24 - 675.20] fun have you ever seen any of the
[673.44 - 677.12] patients have that
[675.20 - 678.88] doctor font any patients have that with
[677.12 - 681.20] the breakouts on their butt right there
[678.88 - 682.56] they're they're right their butt cheeks
[681.20 - 686.32] the breakouts
[682.56 - 689.44] so but you know but truth telling is
[686.32 - 691.60] put paper down on that seat truth
[689.44 - 694.72] telling medical medium information is
[691.60 - 698.88] flush the toilet in the public restroom
[694.72 - 700.80] before you sit on that seat
[698.88 - 703.04] because whatever swimming around that's
[700.80 - 703.36] left over one flush doesn't get rid of
[703.04 - 705.36] it
[703.36 - 706.88] did you know that you guys one flush
[705.36 - 709.12] when somebody goes to the bathroom
[706.88 - 711.28] okay and they flush the toilet it's
[709.12 - 713.68] important information
[711.28 - 714.88] and they flush the toilet right and that
[713.68 - 716.48] toilet bowl goes down
[714.88 - 718.24] oops oops all clean water that's not
[716.48 - 720.72] clean there's still
[718.24 - 722.08] it never gets rid of that seven gallons
[720.72 - 724.80] that goes down
[722.08 - 726.96] always leaves like a half a gallon
[724.80 - 730.08] quarter of a gallon behind
[726.96 - 731.60] so you all got you got all that germ all
[730.08 - 733.84] sitting in there and then you go sit on
[731.60 - 734.72] the toilet and you got that sitting
[733.84 - 737.52] right there just
[734.72 - 739.04] just ready for you ready for you right
[737.52 - 741.68] so it's not only do you need
[739.04 - 742.56] the cover like protection on the toilet
[741.68 - 745.92] seat
[742.56 - 749.52] but you got to worry about the splash
[745.92 - 752.64] so if you're peeing sitting down
[749.52 - 754.72] right you're going to have splash
[752.64 - 755.92] coming up from that water it's just
[754.72 - 759.12] going to be splashing
[755.92 - 761.12] you see all these micro splashes right
[759.12 - 762.80] so you wanna you in a public restroom
[761.12 - 764.56] you wanna flush it
[762.80 - 766.00] before you even sit on there even if the
[764.56 - 767.60] water looks clean oh it obviously
[766.00 - 768.56] flushed somebody flushed it will flush
[767.60 - 770.32] it again
[768.56 - 772.00] so then you have less of a chance of
[770.32 - 774.56] exposure but
[772.00 - 775.36] is this fear-mongering are you scared
[774.56 - 777.76] now
[775.36 - 779.36] are you scared like is everybody scared
[777.76 - 781.92] are you scared out of your mind
[779.36 - 784.24] right or is it truth-telling or can
[781.92 - 785.52] someone handle truth-telling
[784.24 - 787.52] what is it if they can't handle
[785.52 - 789.92] truth-telling i understand
[787.52 - 791.28] but what is it is it fear-mongering
[789.92 - 793.04] right
[791.28 - 795.04] ashley kevin says that's what the splash
[793.04 - 797.60] is the worst um
[795.04 - 798.88] now it's protecting it's having your
[797.60 - 801.12] back
[798.88 - 802.88] you know so it's either is it fear
[801.12 - 805.92] mongering or is it having
[802.88 - 806.48] your back or having your body's back how
[805.92 - 809.68] about that
[806.48 - 811.04] or you having your body's back you know
[809.68 - 812.80] so when you look at all the different
[811.04 - 814.40] levels you guys
[812.80 - 815.92] we're live on youtube live on facebook
[814.40 - 817.28] i'm about to make sweet potato tacos or
[815.92 - 819.12] live on clubhouse
[817.28 - 820.48] if you look at it all right you'll see
[819.12 - 823.28] the traps everywhere
[820.48 - 823.84] okay the moderation trap right there
[823.28 - 825.60] okay
[823.84 - 827.36] then you feel like well moderation
[825.60 - 829.04] everybody's saying moderation
[827.36 - 831.36] maybe that's the right way to go maybe
[829.04 - 833.68] that's what i should do right
[831.36 - 836.24] and but what no one realizes is you
[833.68 - 838.16] poison yourself in moderation we poison
[836.24 - 839.68] ourselves in moderation do you like
[838.16 - 842.96] poisoning yourself
[839.68 - 845.84] i mean we poison ourselves in moderation
[842.96 - 848.48] and it's almost like pushing the body to
[845.84 - 851.60] the limit pushing the body to the edge
[848.48 - 854.72] will the body give yeah it does
[851.60 - 856.16] it gives on everybody eventually right
[854.72 - 858.40] chris you seem finding me good to see
[856.16 - 859.28] you yeah and and so the whole thing is
[858.40 - 862.96] we
[859.28 - 866.48] we have this mechanism our body
[862.96 - 867.60] that gets pushed to the edge all the
[866.48 - 869.92] time
[867.60 - 871.12] and it eventually starts to break down
[869.92 - 873.36] one way or another
[871.12 - 876.24] it just starts to break down it just
[873.36 - 878.88] does some people saw it earlier
[876.24 - 880.16] some people it's not narashini it's good
[878.88 - 881.60] to see you glad you're on i'm gonna

[1006.80 - 1011.84] take these little cubes here
[1012.88 - 1016.00] is the toilet bowl
[1016.96 - 1020.72] filled with a lot of bad bugs and we
[1019.12 - 1021.76] have to be careful when we sit on it
[1020.72 - 1025.44] publicly
[1021.76 - 1029.04] yeah we do got to be cautious
[1025.44 - 1032.16] before the plague very few people
[1029.04 - 1035.04] no one i knew did
[1032.16 - 1036.00] the the hand sanitizer before touching
[1035.04 - 1038.56] the cart
[1036.00 - 1040.24] at the grocery store do a couple more of
[1038.56 - 1042.32] these
[1040.24 - 1046.72] just grab the cart doesn't matter what
[1042.32 - 1046.72] ha what was what's on the cart handles
[1047.12 - 1050.00] rub your eye
[1050.16 - 1055.44] spread the flue
[1053.52 - 1057.04] everybody's got the flu in the winter
[1055.44 - 1058.80] everybody's touching everything
[1057.04 - 1060.08] touching doorknobs no one's thinking
[1058.80 - 1062.32] about anything
[1060.08 - 1065.36] doesn't matter just eat something grab a
[1062.32 - 1068.72] sandwich don't wash your hands
[1065.36 - 1070.00] right makes you stronger it doesn't i've
[1068.72 - 1073.04] seen
[1070.00 - 1073.52] i've seen it knock people down and knock
[1073.04 - 1081.84] them down
[1073.52 - 1081.84] i'm going to cut a couple more of these
[1085.52 - 1090.88] so our immune system weakens
[1088.96 - 1092.72] because it's bombarded by so many
[1090.88 - 1094.08] different things so your immune system
[1092.72 - 1095.84] is bombarded our immune system
[1094.08 - 1097.92] is bombarded is it fear mongering or is
[1095.84 - 1099.60] the truth telling
[1097.92 - 1101.52] our immune system gets bombarded every
[1099.60 - 1104.00] single day okay radiation
[1101.52 - 1104.72] all right mercury falling out of the sky
[1104.00 - 1107.84] okay
[1104.72 - 1110.00] mosquito spray just so you know that the
[1107.84 - 1113.20] chemical companies are trying to kill us
[1110.00 - 1114.00] they just dump mosquito spray all over
[1113.20 - 1116.96] the world
[1114.00 - 1117.68] on top of us mosquito sprays okay that's
[1116.96 - 1119.60] what they do
[1117.68 - 1120.80] that's their favorite is that mosquito
[1119.60 - 1122.40] spray right
[1120.80 - 1124.16] we breathe in and we breathe in and we
[1122.40 - 1127.28] get knocked down the point is
[1124.16 - 1129.52] it's not about being in fear it's about
[1127.28 - 1132.64] how do we fortify ourselves protect
[1129.52 - 1134.40] ourselves make ourselves stronger
[1132.64 - 1136.24] and then the perfumes colognes just so
[1134.40 - 1137.84] you know that stuff is so toxic
[1136.24 - 1139.92] the air fresheners the scented candles
[1137.84 - 1143.36] are so toxic
[1139.92 - 1146.64] so toxic it's unbelievable you guys have
[1143.36 - 1150.16] got you don't know it's so bad
[1146.64 - 1152.40] so bad um okay i'm gonna

[1152.40 - 1156.72] much right here
[1154.80 - 1158.16] so i'm gonna put some lime juice in here
[1156.72 - 1158.96] basically i'm gonna marinate these a
[1158.16 - 1160.48] little bit
[1158.96 - 1162.96] so let me put this down for a second
[1160.48 - 1162.96] right here

[1180.72 - 1183.44] live their life and they don't want to
[1181.84 - 1186.24] be thinking anything so
[1183.44 - 1187.60] they don't want to be thinking about
[1186.24 - 1189.68] something
[1187.60 - 1192.48] they have no control over but you really
[1189.68 - 1194.72] do have control over so much got control
[1192.48 - 1197.68] over the perfumes clones in your life

[1206.64 - 1210.16] those
[1207.44 - 1211.60] that's a big deal on its own um that
[1210.16 - 1213.52] just knocks people down
[1211.60 - 1215.28] knocks them down bad right you got
[1213.52 - 1217.12] control over how much fish you're eating
[1215.28 - 1219.04] you got to worry about the mercury right
[1217.12 - 1221.76] got control when you learn
[1219.04 - 1223.68] that fish oil supplements will will
[1221.76 - 1225.04] bring you so fast to alzheimer's and
[1223.68 - 1227.36] dementia down the road

[1382.88 - 1388.48] about that medical treatment
[1385.28 - 1391.68] how come nobody told me
[1388.48 - 1394.00] to be cautious about all the different
[1391.68 - 1397.84] toxins and poisons how come
[1394.00 - 1399.68] no one told me you know to be cautious
[1397.84 - 1401.68] in the airport with my luggage because
[1399.68 - 1403.84] it's so loaded with
[1401.68 - 1405.04] i wasn't told about it affecting my
[1403.84 - 1406.80] children and
[1405.04 - 1409.44] and having the right you know the
[1406.80 - 1412.16] baggage right next to my children
[1409.44 - 1413.68] nobody told me about perfumes colognes
[1412.16 - 1415.36] and how toxic they are and how they
[1413.68 - 1417.28] lower the immune system
[1415.36 - 1419.84] and scented candles lower the immune
[1417.28 - 1422.72] system they drop the immune system
[1419.84 - 1424.40] you know if i only knew if i only knew
[1422.72 - 1427.60] how to heal
[1424.40 - 1429.60] all these years right
[1427.60 - 1430.80] and you know there's a podcast episode
[1429.60 - 1433.28] on that to you guys
[1430.80 - 1434.56] no one about fragrances and all that you
[1433.28 - 1435.68] should you can check that out medical
[1434.56 - 1437.44] media podcast said
[1435.68 - 1439.12] apple podcast killing you smelly is the
[1437.44 - 1441.12] name of that episode
[1439.12 - 1443.60] nobody told me about how caffeine's
[1441.12 - 1446.72] damaging my adrenals
[1443.60 - 1447.92] and and bringing on my depression even
[1446.72 - 1449.60] worse
[1447.92 - 1451.60] nobody told me it was a psychoactive
[1449.60 - 1454.72] drug that was actually
[1451.60 - 1458.08] not healthy for me right and then
[1454.72 - 1459.20] creates birth problems and in conditions
[1458.08 - 1463.20] with my children
[1459.20 - 1465.20] too but no one talks about that okay
[1463.20 - 1466.80] and i've had so many people tell me over
[1465.20 - 1467.68] the years how come nobody knew any of
[1466.80 - 1470.64] this
[1467.68 - 1472.16] why do we have to trial and error you
[1470.64 - 1474.24] know nobody told me that
[1472.16 - 1476.00] it was important to be cautious about
[1474.24 - 1477.76] exposure versus
[1476.00 - 1479.68] thinking that exposure would make me
[1477.76 - 1481.68] stronger and make my immune system
[1479.68 - 1484.00] stronger because we're supposed to get
[1481.68 - 1486.32] a stronger immune system due to exposure
[1484.00 - 1488.32] because that's what we're told right
[1486.32 - 1490.80] just every bit of exposure makes you
[1488.32 - 1493.92] strong but no one's saying
[1490.80 - 1494.56] anything about that like what to look
[1493.92 - 1497.76] out for
[1494.56 - 1498.64] okay and all these all these things
[1497.76 - 1501.92] matter
[1498.64 - 1502.56] you know and who's looking out for us in
[1501.92 - 1504.48] the end
[1502.56 - 1505.76] right so we have to look out for each
[1504.48 - 1507.04] other but if we're not given that
[1505.76 - 1509.04] information and we're not giving those
[1507.04 - 1509.60] tools how do we look out for ourselves
[1509.04 - 1512.16] how do we
[1509.60 - 1513.84] look out for us how do we look out for
[1512.16 - 1515.84] each other how do we look out for our
[1513.84 - 1518.24] family members the whole bit

[1568.48 - 1574.40] i love it jocelyn
[1571.92 - 1575.60] i wish more people knew about how toxic
[1574.40 - 1577.60] fragrances are
[1575.60 - 1579.60] even after you tell them they keep on
[1577.60 - 1582.32] using them absolutely
[1579.60 - 1582.32] of course they do
[1583.20 - 1587.20] one thing that happens that people don't
[1584.80 - 1590.24] understand is that
[1587.20 - 1593.28] fragrances are an
[1590.24 - 1596.32] invasion upon us
[1593.28 - 1599.44] perp it's purposeful
[1596.32 - 1601.04] that the form of darkness no
[1599.44 - 1602.96] that might be too far i might have gone
[1601.04 - 1604.80] too far on that
[1602.96 - 1607.44] i think you guys think i've gone too far
[1604.80 - 1610.64] to that but
[1607.44 - 1612.32] it's a form of darkness because the
[1610.64 - 1616.16] chemical companies
[1612.32 - 1619.36] who conjure up these dangerous chemicals
[1616.16 - 1620.56] just laughing in our faces slapping in
[1619.36 - 1624.24] our faces
[1620.56 - 1624.88] right like creating fake wildflower
[1624.24 - 1628.64] smells
[1624.88 - 1631.84] and just fake toxic perfume smells
[1628.64 - 1632.56] right and meanwhile really just laughing
[1631.84 - 1633.92] at our face
[1632.56 - 1637.04] i'm gonna put a little honey in there
[1633.92 - 1637.04] you guys okay if i do that
[1638.64 - 1641.84] a lot went in there
[1646.00 - 1651.12] right then they make us afraid of bugs
[1649.52 - 1652.40] they'll make us afraid of mosquitoes
[1651.12 - 1654.64] they'll make us afraid of things and
[1652.40 - 1657.20] then they'll just want us to wish we had
[1654.64 - 1662.24] mosquito spray being dumped on us
[1657.20 - 1662.24] you know it's like
[1662.48 - 1666.08] they fear monger us into they fear
[1665.36 - 1670.96] monger us
[1666.08 - 1675.12] into wanting to be intoxicated
[1670.96 - 1676.88] you know um
[1675.12 - 1678.72] ticks cause lyme disease they'll say
[1676.88 - 1680.16] which is not true ticks don't cause lyme
[1678.72 - 1683.36] disease you guys
[1680.16 - 1684.64] but you wouldn't believe in in places
[1683.36 - 1687.60] where there are a lot of ticks
[1684.64 - 1689.68] people getting tick spray all on their
[1687.60 - 1691.68] properties all on their yards right
[1689.68 - 1693.20] for their children to play so that's
[1691.68 - 1696.96] that's what's happening right
[1693.20 - 1699.92] so all like oh my god all in new england
[1696.96 - 1701.52] on the east coast of the u.s other
[1699.92 - 1702.80] places united states and
[1701.52 - 1704.88] practically anywhere in the united
[1702.80 - 1707.52] states now right is
[1704.88 - 1708.88] parents are being told you know you
[1707.52 - 1710.72] better have some
[1708.88 - 1712.00] some chemical company come in a
[1710.72 - 1714.40] pesticide company
[1712.00 - 1715.92] come insecticide and spray for ticks in
[1714.40 - 1718.24] your lawn your property
[1715.92 - 1720.16] your your adjacent woods maybe to your
[1718.24 - 1722.64] property or your house right
[1720.16 - 1723.20] because you know your children you know
[1722.64 - 1724.96] need to be
[1723.20 - 1726.80] safe because they're going to get lyme
[1724.96 - 1728.32] disease from tick bites right
[1726.80 - 1730.24] children don't get lyme disease from
[1728.32 - 1733.44] tick bites right i talk about that in
[1730.24 - 1734.96] the medical medium book the new edition
[1733.44 - 1737.44] children don't get lyme disease from
[1734.96 - 1739.04] tick bites bites it's not tick bites
[1737.44 - 1741.04] ticks don't do that so it's really
[1739.04 - 1741.76] important to know this is a new addition
[1741.04 - 1745.12] by the way
[1741.76 - 1747.92] and mosquitoes don't spread disease
[1745.12 - 1750.00] here in the united states and most other
[1747.92 - 1753.36] places around the world right
[1750.00 - 1755.36] malaria is the only thing that
[1753.36 - 1757.36] mosquitoes have ever spread
[1755.36 - 1759.36] and even that's questionable by the way
[1757.36 - 1762.08] in certain for certain reasons
[1759.36 - 1763.68] but the bottom line is they'll put you
[1762.08 - 1766.16] in fear about these things and
[1763.68 - 1767.76] in tick with ticks everybody sprays
[1766.16 - 1770.72] their lawns they spray
[1767.76 - 1772.16] all around their house they spray in
[1770.72 - 1774.24] their houses
[1772.16 - 1776.12] and now you're exposing your children to
[1774.24 - 1779.36] a deadly
[1776.12 - 1780.00] neurotoxic chemical right it does have
[1779.36 - 1783.60] long-term
[1780.00 - 1786.56] damage to the body and nervous system
[1783.60 - 1788.56] and so so now your children are in the
[1786.56 - 1791.12] yard they're playing in the grass that
[1788.56 - 1793.68] was sprayed by the tick spray company
[1791.12 - 1794.48] i mean it's the endless problems with
[1793.68 - 1796.24] this
[1794.48 - 1798.32] i mean with with the mistakes that are
[1796.24 - 1800.64] made all the time but you get put
[1798.32 - 1801.60] into fear about it so the gas lighting
[1800.64 - 1803.92] comes around so the
[1801.60 - 1805.04] end up bringing that big that big
[1803.92 - 1807.44] gasoline can
[1805.04 - 1809.52] over just jump it there we go they dump
[1807.44 - 1811.04] it all over you and bring out the match
[1809.52 - 1812.48] you gotta spray for ticks you gotta
[1811.04 - 1813.36] spray for ticks you gotta spray for
[1812.48 - 1816.72] ticks
[1813.36 - 1820.24] and you get you get lit up again
[1816.72 - 1823.28] are incense toxic yeah they are yvonne
[1820.24 - 1826.56] um yeah they're toxic
[1823.28 - 1828.16] incense is just as toxic i'm just going
[1826.56 - 1829.68] to be straight up is the perfumes the
[1828.16 - 1831.76] clones air fresheners and scented
[1829.68 - 1834.00] candles
[1831.76 - 1836.56] chemical companies got your number they
[1834.00 - 1838.48] got your number
[1836.56 - 1840.64] they got your number in your head your
[1838.48 - 1841.68] mind they got your number in your head
[1840.64 - 1845.12] in mind
[1841.68 - 1847.28] um kim blocker says
[1845.12 - 1848.56] are you against a cup of organic coffee
[1847.28 - 1850.88] for fatty liver
[1848.56 - 1853.28] look it's not that i'm against it like
[1850.88 - 1856.00] hey he's against it
[1853.28 - 1857.68] but if you have a fatty liver i mean i i
[1856.00 - 1859.28] wouldn't drink coffee if you have a
[1857.68 - 1859.92] fatty liver because the coffee the
[1859.28 - 1862.40] caffeine
[1859.92 - 1863.76] is what tires out a liver and keeps on
[1862.40 - 1865.92] tiring out a liver
[1863.76 - 1867.76] so if you have a fatty liver there's not
[1865.92 - 1869.52] it's not going to be an easy road to
[1867.76 - 1870.80] healing a fatty liver if you have any
[1869.52 - 1872.00] caffeine going in there
[1870.80 - 1874.48] should listen to the medical mean
[1872.00 - 1877.12] podcast coffee matcha tea and
[1874.48 - 1878.56] and chocolate um medical mean podcast
[1877.12 - 1881.92] apple podcast
[1878.56 - 1884.16] so what coffee does is and all caffeine
[1881.92 - 1886.40] does is it stresses out the liver it
[1884.16 - 1887.28] weakens it it beats it down and that's
[1886.40 - 1889.52] what it does and
[1887.28 - 1891.04] and that might be just a simple way of
[1889.52 - 1893.12] saying it right there but if you want
[1891.04 - 1895.28] the more detailed version
[1893.12 - 1897.28] is caffeine prompts your adrenals to
[1895.28 - 1898.96] flood a tremendous amount of epinephrine
[1897.28 - 1901.04] into your bloodstream your liver has to
[1898.96 - 1902.32] soak it up like a sponge in order to
[1901.04 - 1904.64] protect your brain
[1902.32 - 1906.08] and your heart from becoming damaged by
[1904.64 - 1908.00] the caffeine's effects of
[1906.08 - 1909.52] triggering off your adrenals and then
[1908.00 - 1911.12] all that epinephrine is flooding into
[1909.52 - 1912.88] your bloodstream so your liver has to be
[1911.12 - 1914.00] the sponge that's your mop right do you
[1912.88 - 1915.76] have a mop in your kitchen
[1914.00 - 1916.96] you guys mop your kitchen at all do you
[1915.76 - 1917.52] do that because that's your liver you
[1916.96 - 1918.84] should see
[1917.52 - 1921.12] on the end of that mop when you're
[1918.84 - 1923.68] mopping right you're mopping
[1921.12 - 1924.80] along right is that a new prop i have to
[1923.68 - 1927.12] get the mop
[1924.80 - 1928.16] and you know and you're mopping along
[1927.12 - 1930.24] right
[1928.16 - 1932.88] that's your liver attach the bottom of
[1930.24 - 1935.04] that broom that handle that mop handle
[1932.88 - 1936.64] that's your liver and it's got to mop up
[1935.04 - 1938.64] the floor well that's what it's doing
[1936.64 - 1940.16] with all that adrenaline
[1938.64 - 1942.08] and it's all caffeine it's not just
[1940.16 - 1943.76] coffee it's matcha tea it's
[1942.08 - 1946.16] whatever type of green tea it's every 10
[1943.76 - 1949.76] black tea it's energy drinks
[1946.16 - 1952.00] it's caffeine pills destroys the liver
[1949.76 - 1954.08] and destroys the liver by prompting all
[1952.00 - 1954.96] that adrenaline that epinephrine from
[1954.08 - 1957.28] being
[1954.96 - 1958.88] you know surging out of your adrenals
[1957.28 - 1960.24] and then your liver has to be like i
[1958.88 - 1961.12] said that sponge and that's what it has
[1960.24 - 1963.92] to do okay
[1961.12 - 1965.68] cacao chocolate the same thing and if
[1963.92 - 1967.76] you got a fatty liver it's not that i'm
[1965.68 - 1969.68] against it it's like look i want to look
[1967.76 - 1970.88] if you if you want chocolate if you want
[1969.68 - 1975.20] coffee if you want
[1970.88 - 1978.24] i get it but but what i'm against is
[1975.20 - 1979.92] it's i'm against yeah
[1978.24 - 1981.20] i'm against the industries you know i
[1979.92 - 1982.96] mean they said the industries aren't
[1981.20 - 1986.00] looking out for people
[1982.96 - 1988.96] leslie says i would say sheila says what
[1986.00 - 1990.96] about decaf coffee it's all the same

[1992.16 - 1996.08] they're far from safe i'm sorry to say
[1995.04 - 1998.56] no
[1996.08 - 2000.16] i'm sorry to say no it was a bad idea
[1998.56 - 2001.52] there's no science behind it
[2000.16 - 2003.20] and that's the thing everybody thinks
[2001.52 - 2005.84] what's the science behind it no
[2003.20 - 2006.48] it's it was a bad idea terrible idea
[2005.84 - 2008.16] actually
[2006.48 - 2010.40] people are so obsessed with their coffee
[2008.16 - 2013.44] they're so obsessed with their caffeine
[2010.40 - 2016.08] that it was a really bad idea to
[2013.44 - 2017.20] to to um to do the enema the coffee

[2033.28 - 2038.32] um right on my friend right there i'm
[2036.80 - 2040.80] going to pull the stomach out okay
[2038.32 - 2042.24] your stomach's got a really really
[2040.80 - 2045.04] really
[2042.24 - 2046.80] thick skin inside just so you know i'm
[2045.04 - 2049.20] just letting you know okay
[2046.80 - 2050.64] and it's there to buffer poison in case
[2049.20 - 2053.84] we get
[2050.64 - 2056.16] we accidentally swallow poison right
[2053.84 - 2057.44] and i talked about this one time okay
[2056.16 - 2060.64] humankind
[2057.44 - 2061.12] didn't know what what to eat right it's
[2060.64 - 2064.56] all about
[2061.12 - 2067.28] wait a minute let me try that herb
[2064.56 - 2068.88] or that root or that shoot and everybody
[2067.28 - 2070.00] stood around somebody when they tried
[2068.88 - 2071.84] something new
[2070.00 - 2074.32] native american culture i had a native
[2071.84 - 2075.12] american a friend of mine right tell me
[2074.32 - 2077.68] about
[2075.12 - 2078.72] what their ancestors say right back in
[2077.68 - 2081.20] their ancestors said
[2078.72 - 2081.76] back in the day it was everybody stood
[2081.20 - 2084.24] around
[2081.76 - 2086.08] why one brave native american tried
[2084.24 - 2088.88] something new
[2086.08 - 2089.60] just so you know tried something new
[2088.88 - 2092.64] should i
[2089.60 - 2093.76] can i eat that tuber or that shoot or
[2092.64 - 2097.84] that rhizome
[2093.76 - 2100.88] can i eat that rhizome from that shrub
[2097.84 - 2101.52] and then eat it and see how sick they
[2100.88 - 2103.44] get
[2101.52 - 2105.20] do they get devastatingly sick are they
[2103.44 - 2105.84] in fetal position and vomiting for two
[2105.20 - 2107.60] days
[2105.84 - 2109.04] do they completely shut down and go
[2107.60 - 2111.28] unconscious do they
[2109.04 - 2112.96] choke and their throat just swell up and
[2111.28 - 2116.96] they can't breathe and they die
[2112.96 - 2121.28] right and so um your stomach
[2116.96 - 2124.40] is created is made to be that buffer
[2121.28 - 2125.20] for for mistakes of survival or stupid
[2124.40 - 2126.64] mistakes
[2125.20 - 2127.92] or whatever so i'm checking the oven
[2126.64 - 2128.84] right now you guys bear with me in a
[2127.92 - 2134.00] second
[2128.84 - 2134.00] um those are toasting up
[2136.64 - 2140.08] they actually only need another minute
[2138.16 - 2142.00] or so and i'm gonna make a sauce make a
[2140.08 - 2145.36] hot sauce
[2142.00 - 2145.68] so okay back to this again so when we
[2145.36 - 2148.72] dump
[2145.68 - 2149.84] coffee poisonous effects of caffeine get
[2148.72 - 2151.68] buffered a little bit
[2149.84 - 2153.12] from that thick skin inside the stomach
[2151.68 - 2154.24] right they get buffered a little bit
[2153.12 - 2157.12] from that thick skin
[2154.24 - 2157.68] okay but when you put coffee up the back
[2157.12 - 2159.92] end
[2157.68 - 2160.72] there's no buffer it goes directly into
[2159.92 - 2163.52] your bloodstream
[2160.72 - 2165.36] to your heart into your brain and it
[2163.52 - 2166.64] annihilates the central nervous system
[2165.36 - 2168.32] if you're somebody with central nervous
[2166.64 - 2169.84] system symptoms what does that mean i
[2168.32 - 2171.04] don't have any central nervous system
[2169.84 - 2172.72] symptoms
[2171.04 - 2174.96] i don't have any what's he talking about
[2172.72 - 2178.96] i got no nervous system symptoms
[2174.96 - 2182.48] migraines anybody migraines neck pain
[2178.96 - 2185.68] back pain leg pain insomnia
[2182.48 - 2187.12] nervous system okay tinkles and numbness
[2185.68 - 2189.76] ringing in the ears nervous system
[2187.12 - 2192.56] vertigo dizziness balance issues
[2189.76 - 2194.64] depression anxiety nervous system so
[2192.56 - 2196.48] whatever what up burning skin
[2194.64 - 2198.16] pain in your jaw pain in your teeth
[2196.48 - 2199.92] unexplained nervous system
[2198.16 - 2201.28] right floaters in the eyes nervous
[2199.92 - 2203.20] system okay
[2201.28 - 2205.12] black spots in your eyes white spots in
[2203.20 - 2207.60] your eyes all nervous system
[2205.12 - 2208.56] right so you got all these new all these
[2207.60 - 2210.80] nervous system
[2208.56 - 2211.60] conditions and symptoms out there right
[2210.80 - 2214.00] the worst thing
[2211.60 - 2215.60] ever is to put coffee up the back end
[2214.00 - 2217.36] because when you put coffee that way
[2215.60 - 2219.60] there's no buffer from that thick skin
[2217.36 - 2223.20] from the stomach you guys
[2219.60 - 2225.52] and even that still isn't good enough
[2223.20 - 2228.40] right it just buffers it to some degree
[2225.52 - 2231.36] so it slowly gets to the brain
[2228.40 - 2232.16] and the heart versus you go the coffee
[2231.36 - 2233.68] enema
[2232.16 - 2235.84] that goes right into your bloodstream it
[2233.68 - 2238.16] hits your liver right away bam
[2235.84 - 2239.36] wax that liver not to cleanse it it
[2238.16 - 2241.84] doesn't cleanse it
[2239.36 - 2242.88] it shocks it and weakens it and disables
[2241.84 - 2244.32] it
[2242.88 - 2246.72] that's what it does when you do coffee
[2244.32 - 2248.00] enema right and then
[2246.72 - 2249.84] and then the caffeine gets into the
[2248.00 - 2250.96] bloodstream and causes a big problem i'm
[2249.84 - 2252.24] going to take that out i think that's
[2250.96 - 2254.84] just about getting there
[2252.24 - 2256.96] so let me just grab an oven mitt wrap it
[2254.84 - 2261.68] up you guys
[2256.96 - 2261.68] that's what i'm doing get these out
[2262.48 - 2266.40] these are toasted up nice okay so i am
[2265.44 - 2270.00] going to
[2266.40 - 2272.00] let me make the sauce and let me find a
[2270.00 - 2276.72] spot where this should go
[2272.00 - 2276.72] okay so maybe we can put it over here
[2279.60 - 2285.84] all right
[2292.32 - 2296.72] okay it's gonna burn on that towel but
[2295.12 - 2298.24] i'll put it there
[2296.72 - 2300.00] all right i got it right there you guys
[2298.24 - 2301.84] so i'm just i'm just gonna make a sauce
[2300.00 - 2305.36] right now
[2301.84 - 2305.36] let's do that i'm gonna sip a little tea
[2306.32 - 2313.84] so good with honey and the lemon balm
[2308.00 - 2313.84] tea it's so incredible
[2316.72 - 2319.76] it's not that moringa is bad or anything
[2318.72 - 2322.88] it just
[2319.76 - 2322.88] doesn't do a whole lot
[2323.44 - 2326.96] it there's a lot of things people say
[2325.36 - 2328.40] what about this what about moreno what
[2326.96 - 2329.60] about this what about that you know it's
[2328.40 - 2331.36] not that it's bad
[2329.60 - 2332.96] what about maca what about this what
[2331.36 - 2336.48] about that right it's like
[2332.96 - 2338.40] maca doesn't fix anyone right and
[2336.48 - 2340.00] here's the thing all these things that
[2338.40 - 2342.16] come out whether it's niem oil
[2340.00 - 2343.68] moringa maca whatever that comes out
[2342.16 - 2345.60] right dear antler whatever somebody
[2343.68 - 2348.08] throws out next right
[2345.60 - 2350.00] collagen whatever people don't realize
[2348.08 - 2352.80] it all comes from a place of
[2350.00 - 2354.32] no one knew why anybody's sick and why
[2352.80 - 2355.84] someone's suffering and struggling
[2354.32 - 2358.40] that's the health realm
[2355.84 - 2359.76] all through the years the reason why i
[2358.40 - 2361.60] got all the connections that
[2359.76 - 2363.12] have happened in my life and most
[2361.60 - 2365.04] powerful people in the world reaching
[2363.12 - 2368.32] out to me is because
[2365.04 - 2369.36] what happened was people said he has an
[2368.32 - 2370.48] answer
[2369.36 - 2373.04] because there's there was never any
[2370.48 - 2374.96] answers in the health realm right
[2373.04 - 2376.72] and he has answers to why i have
[2374.96 - 2379.20] mysterious tingles and numbness
[2376.72 - 2380.48] he has answers to why i have this jaw
[2379.20 - 2382.56] pain that won't go away
[2380.48 - 2384.64] right it's a shingles virus nobody knew
[2382.56 - 2387.44] that he had answers to why
[2384.64 - 2387.92] people are struggling with burning skin
[2387.44 - 2391.52] right
[2387.92 - 2393.28] or chronic etis you know he had answers
[2391.52 - 2395.44] that's he got answers right nobody had
[2393.28 - 2396.88] the answers okay so
[2395.44 - 2399.20] but at the same time in the health room
[2396.88 - 2401.28] everybody health health world right
[2399.20 - 2402.80] everybody throws out like try this try
[2401.28 - 2404.56] that try this
[2402.80 - 2406.00] this will help you green tea will help
[2404.56 - 2408.64] you this will help you
[2406.00 - 2410.00] help you with what really with what
[2408.64 - 2411.92] because nobody knows why anybody's
[2410.00 - 2414.08] sick it's either people think it's your
[2411.92 - 2416.08] genes or your body's attacking itself
[2414.08 - 2417.36] or you you're making it up and you're
[2416.08 - 2420.56] lying or
[2417.36 - 2424.32] you're seeking out attention right
[2420.56 - 2426.56] nobody knows why anybody was sick okay
[2424.32 - 2427.76] um astrid said i thought maca is for
[2426.56 - 2430.88] fertility
[2427.76 - 2431.84] um then that's made up that's just made
[2430.88 - 2433.76] up
[2431.84 - 2434.96] there's no scientific study that could
[2433.76 - 2436.88] definitively show
[2434.96 - 2438.64] that maca can help with fertility right
[2436.88 - 2442.32] there just isn't astrid so that's just
[2438.64 - 2445.28] made up and that's what happens maca
[2442.32 - 2447.04] maca came out during a time where where
[2445.28 - 2449.84] anybody
[2447.04 - 2450.80] looking for cool things neither you
[2449.84 - 2452.72] needed a cool
[2450.80 - 2454.16] name and it always took off you just
[2452.72 - 2455.36] need a cool name like maka took off
[2454.16 - 2456.64] because people were like maka what's
[2455.36 - 2458.00] maka maka maka maka
[2456.64 - 2459.76] everybody's like oh my god put it here
[2458.00 - 2461.28] put it there same thing with neem oil
[2459.76 - 2464.40] it's like neem oil
[2461.28 - 2465.68] neem neem all through the internet
[2464.40 - 2468.16] and then you know that's how it works
[2465.68 - 2469.76] right but neem oil
[2468.16 - 2472.40] doesn't fix your multiple sclerosis
[2469.76 - 2474.40] lupus fibromyalgia ra
[2472.40 - 2476.40] lyme disease aches and pains tingles and
[2474.40 - 2477.12] numbness ringing in the ears depression
[2476.40 - 2479.84] anxiety see
[2477.12 - 2480.56] see how it works maca doesn't either so
[2479.84 - 2483.12] it's like
[2480.56 - 2483.76] if you want somebody to get better it
[2483.12 - 2487.60] can't be
[2483.76 - 2489.28] trendy things so to speak it has to be
[2487.60 - 2491.12] something that actually works
[2489.28 - 2492.64] and then when it finally works then it
[2491.12 - 2495.92] takes off right
[2492.64 - 2498.72] but maca took off because of money
[2495.92 - 2499.60] money right there was no money in celery
[2498.72 - 2502.08] juice
[2499.60 - 2503.92] it was people actually healing okay and
[2502.08 - 2507.12] that's why it still survives today
[2503.92 - 2510.64] because there's not one dollar into
[2507.12 - 2512.08] a massive campaign that celery juice is
[2510.64 - 2515.68] something you need to do
[2512.08 - 2517.92] not one dollar right and so and
[2515.68 - 2519.12] it's out there healing people and
[2517.92 - 2522.64] changing lives
[2519.12 - 2525.76] because it works because celery works
[2522.64 - 2526.80] it's in you know but maca never changed
[2525.76 - 2529.52] any lives
[2526.80 - 2529.92] but maca had millions of dollars behind
[2529.52 - 2532.08] it
[2529.92 - 2532.96] to convince people it's something you
[2532.08 - 2536.72] should buy
[2532.96 - 2539.04] right kombucha tea millions of dollars
[2536.72 - 2540.56] in advertising to convince every yoga
[2539.04 - 2544.08] mama they should be
[2540.56 - 2547.04] on it right but it doesn't do anything
[2544.08 - 2548.48] so you can still be a sick yoga mama
[2547.04 - 2550.00] trying to go to yoga class
[2548.48 - 2551.76] with fibro and aches and pains and
[2550.00 - 2554.24] fatigue but
[2551.76 - 2555.60] maca or kombucha tea aren't gonna fix it
[2554.24 - 2557.60] see how it works
[2555.60 - 2559.04] but the millions of dollars behind these
[2557.60 - 2560.72] things the millions of dollars behind
[2559.04 - 2561.68] collagen the millions of dollars behind
[2560.72 - 2564.96] these things
[2561.68 - 2565.52] is it's it's all like it's basically a
[2564.96 - 2567.12] fake out
[2565.52 - 2569.92] smoke and mirrors and it's bait and
[2567.12 - 2571.92] switch it's constantly like this right
[2569.92 - 2573.04] celery juice has all the odds stacked
[2571.92 - 2575.84] against it
[2573.04 - 2576.48] every the media trying to stop it every
[2575.84 - 2578.64] single
[2576.48 - 2580.16] in the health world tries to clobber the
[2578.64 - 2582.08] crap out of it because it makes nobody
[2580.16 - 2585.04] money it just heals people
[2582.08 - 2586.88] and so it's end in medical mediums the
[2585.04 - 2587.92] originator so that doesn't help all on
[2586.88 - 2590.48] its own
[2587.92 - 2592.48] because people just get all bent out of
[2590.48 - 2595.52] shape about that alone right
[2592.48 - 2598.24] but celery juice lives on its own
[2595.52 - 2600.24] because it heals and heals and heals and
[2598.24 - 2600.56] heals and saves lives and changes lives
[2600.24 - 2602.72] and
[2600.56 - 2603.92] moves people forward right with no money
[2602.72 - 2605.92] can you imagine
[2603.92 - 2608.08] if you put the money that was behind
[2605.92 - 2610.00] kombucha tea and the money behind
[2608.08 - 2611.60] probiotics and the money behind any of
[2610.00 - 2613.60] this stuff right
[2611.60 - 2615.44] in maca whatever if you put that kind of
[2613.60 - 2617.28] money behind celery juice
[2615.44 - 2618.72] not only would there be like 500 million
[2617.28 - 2620.00] people drinking it right now
[2618.72 - 2621.92] naturally around the world because it
[2620.00 - 2624.56] works but you'd have six
[2621.92 - 2626.08] billion people drinking it if five
[2624.56 - 2628.16] billion people drinking it
[2626.08 - 2630.00] it's just it's just it's incredible how
[2628.16 - 2631.44] it works um let's make the sauce right
[2630.00 - 2634.24] now you guys
[2631.44 - 2637.36] i got a food processor right here just
[2634.24 - 2637.36] going to flip this around
[2640.16 - 2644.72] it's kind of a chill day we're just
[2641.60 - 2646.40] we're talking about some cool things
[2644.72 - 2648.00] guys you think it'd help if i can plug
[2646.40 - 2649.72] this in
[2648.00 - 2652.77] so which i'm gonna do
[2649.72 - 2652.77] [Music]
[2652.80 - 2656.64] so what i'm gonna do is get a little
[2654.24 - 2659.68] extension cord in a second and plug this
[2656.64 - 2661.36] food processor in so that's what i was
[2659.68 - 2663.20] saying your stomach is designed to
[2661.36 - 2666.00] handle poison
[2663.20 - 2666.80] but only certain amounts of poison to a
[2666.00 - 2669.20] certain degree
[2666.80 - 2671.28] the stomach can buffer but other than
[2669.20 - 2671.84] that we still get poisoned by things you
[2671.28 - 2674.40] know
[2671.84 - 2676.48] it's like it's like a dangerous poison
[2674.40 - 2679.60] like cyanide right
[2676.48 - 2679.92] if it goes into the stomach you'll live
[2679.60 - 2684.32] a
[2679.92 - 2687.36] half an hour longer or hour longer
[2684.32 - 2690.64] than if it was put into an enema so
[2687.36 - 2693.76] somebody put a dangerous dangerous
[2690.64 - 2694.48] poison like cyanide in an enema you
[2693.76 - 2697.68] would die
[2694.48 - 2699.12] in seconds just set two seconds and
[2697.68 - 2701.44] that's the difference if it went into
[2699.12 - 2703.44] the stomach you'll be at the hospital
[2701.44 - 2705.12] dying but you'll be a livestone that's
[2703.44 - 2708.16] the difference in how the stomach works
[2705.12 - 2710.88] so we'll go with a half cup
[2708.16 - 2712.96] of chopped red bell pepper we're making
[2710.88 - 2714.96] the hot sauce right now
[2712.96 - 2717.68] so just taking out the center right
[2714.96 - 2720.40] there there you go
[2717.68 - 2720.40] put it over here
[2722.32 - 2725.60] so i'm just going to chop this up
[2728.16 - 2731.52] these are really sharp knives i'm
[2729.68 - 2732.56] dealing with right now and like i said
[2731.52 - 2734.64] before
[2732.56 - 2736.80] be really careful with sharp knives
[2734.64 - 2739.04] because you cut yourself real easily
[2736.80 - 2740.96] um that's a massive mistake in the
[2739.04 - 2741.44] culinary world would they say that dull
[2740.96 - 2743.12] knives
[2741.44 - 2744.64] cause more injuries that's not true
[2743.12 - 2746.56] actually that's so not true
[2744.64 - 2747.84] i've seen people chop their fingers off
[2746.56 - 2750.96] with sharp knives
[2747.84 - 2751.60] and and not get injured with in you know
[2750.96 - 2754.40] with
[2751.60 - 2755.12] with adult knife steak knives are
[2754.40 - 2756.48] different
[2755.12 - 2758.32] okay those are different that's a whole
[2756.48 - 2760.56] nother story i'm talking about these
[2758.32 - 2763.52] type of chopping knives let's put some
[2760.56 - 2765.52] cherry tomatoes in here too
[2763.52 - 2766.72] okay you can chop up the cherry tomatoes
[2765.52 - 2767.84] pudding in there i'm just gonna throw
[2766.72 - 2772.16] them right in
[2767.84 - 2775.12] um third of a cup
[2772.16 - 2776.32] see that that's probably it right there
[2775.12 - 2779.84] there you go
[2776.32 - 2781.04] nice cherry tomatoes okay um let's do a
[2779.84 - 2783.36] clove of garlic
[2781.04 - 2785.36] look you can do three cloves of garlic
[2783.36 - 2787.52] you can do one clove of garlic

[2787.52 - 2790.72] the hot sauce the medical medium hot
[2789.12 - 2794.32] sauce for this

[2796.24 - 2799.28] so i'm gonna put one clove of garlic in
[2798.56 - 2803.12] there
[2799.28 - 2806.72] let's do that
[2803.12 - 2808.56] all right so then put some lemon
[2806.72 - 2810.24] in there some lemon juice in there too
[2808.56 - 2812.16] let's see i got a lemon over here you

[2812.16 - 2818.16] nice okay and get some lemon juice in
[2816.88 - 2819.92] here i think i'm gonna get a tiny
[2818.16 - 2822.72] strainer real quick
[2819.92 - 2822.72] so what i'm gonna do
[2826.16 - 2831.12] i'm gonna look for that i think we're
[2828.80 - 2831.12] down
[2833.52 - 2835.84] anyway
[2836.72 - 2839.28] here we go
[2841.68 - 2845.20] so i'm going to put some lemon so this
[2843.84 - 2847.60] is the hot sauce i'm making right here
[2845.20 - 2847.60] you guys
[2851.76 - 2856.88] so get that in there i'm gonna put some
[2854.00 - 2859.84] lime juice in here too
[2856.88 - 2859.84] let's cut a lime
[2863.76 - 2868.08] that's not a lime that's actually juicy
[2865.84 - 2868.08] enough
[2868.48 - 2872.00] there we go some lime in here too so
[2871.36 - 2873.36] making this hot
[2872.00 - 2875.60] sauce while we're talking about some fun
[2873.36 - 2875.60] stuff
[2876.56 - 2882.48] you can do um a little less lime if you
[2880.40 - 2887.52] want a lot i like more lime
[2882.48 - 2889.28] there we go
[2887.52 - 2891.04] put some raw honey in here you have the
[2889.28 - 2893.12] option of maple syrup if you don't like
[2891.04 - 2896.64] honey on any level
[2893.12 - 2896.64] so you got the option of maple syrup
[2898.48 - 2904.72] just move this over
[2901.60 - 2904.72] so put some honey in here
[2908.24 - 2911.84] all right and i'm going to put a hot
[2910.88 - 2913.60] pepper
[2911.84 - 2915.20] so i have a couple different hot peppers
[2913.60 - 2917.28] here
[2915.20 - 2918.88] i got these fresh super chilies i'm
[2917.28 - 2922.96] gonna pop one in there

[2959.92 - 2963.84] happen to make it a lot
[2961.44 - 2965.76] people want to say what is what does aw
[2963.84 - 2969.20] eat what is he eating what is he doing

[3295.20 - 3298.64] anymore
[3296.16 - 3299.92] so when the gas lighter comes by and
[3298.64 - 3301.92] they just want to torch you
