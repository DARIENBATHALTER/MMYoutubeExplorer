[22.76 - 26.56] really important right there I know a
[23.88 - 27.92] lot of people have ink I respect it I
[26.56 - 30.24] dig it there's a lot of great artists
[27.92 - 32.00] out there incredible gifted people that
[30.24 - 34.08] are doing all kinds of incredible
[32.00 - 37.60] designs and freehand on people's bodies
[34.08 - 39.32] body art I'm not against it you know
[37.60 - 44.56] it's not that kind of thing this isn't
[39.32 - 46.28] an anti- tattoo podcast episode but it's
[44.56 - 48.88] really important because it's an
[46.28 - 50.64] important podcast episode about tattoos
[48.88 - 52.52] and how to keep your health safe so it
[50.64 - 55.40] is really important so I talk about
[52.52 - 58.80] toxic heavy metals yes toxic heavy
[55.40 - 61.92] metals in your tattoo ink and how there
[58.80 - 66.28] is no such thing and I repeat there is
[61.92 - 69.48] no such thing as tattoo ink that's metal
[66.28 - 73.28] free I repeat so I just hope that gets
[69.48 - 75.48] out there and Rings throughout the ether
[73.28 - 77.56] and then leaves this planet and then
[75.48 - 80.32] heads through the solar system and then
[77.56 - 82.48] into the Galaxy and then out out of the
[80.32 - 84.72] Galaxy and into the universe and there
[82.48 - 86.72] forth because it's important to know and
[84.72 - 88.60] maybe people on another planet somewhere
[86.72 - 90.36] that are doing all this ink and tattoos
[88.60 - 92.52] and everything else maybe they'll hear
[90.36 - 95.44] it and that will travel all the way to
[92.52 - 97.88] that planet and get to them and someone
[95.44 - 99.24] will be sitting there maybe by a lake
[97.88 - 102.44] and they're going to hear it and it's
[99.24 - 105.44] going to be like there's no such thing
[102.44 - 107.32] as metal free ink there is no such thing
[105.44 - 109.48] I want people to know this I don't care
[107.32 - 111.84] if it's cruelty-free animal free the
[109.48 - 114.12] whole bit listen to this podcast episode

[197.52 - 201.04] something in the intestinal tract
[199.08 - 205.00] something happening there an eating
[201.04 - 207.84] disorder can develop just from that
[205.00 - 209.04] alone okay this is important if you guys
[207.84 - 210.96] want to know I'm reading out of brain
[209.04 - 213.36] saver right now if you don't have this
[210.96 - 215.08] book and you didn't read this section
[213.36 - 218.40] here about eating disorders you're
[215.08 - 221.00] missing out this book is packed it's got
[218.40 - 223.12] so much information really protective
[221.00 - 224.76] information too including things to
[223.12 - 226.72] avoid like certain supplementation and
[224.76 - 228.56] everything that causes damage to your

[233.84 - 238.44] library get get it out of the library if
[236.28 - 240.36] you want okay so for instance if you
[238.44 - 243.20] have a hot spot in your intestinal
[240.36 - 245.84] track so if you got a hot spot if you're
[243.20 - 248.88] inflamed somewhere in your intestinal
[245.84 - 251.52] track if you're inflamed somewhere
[248.88 - 253.84] anywhere in here and you eat something
[251.52 - 255.80] and it finds its way going down here and
[253.84 - 257.84] it's taking its time and it's going
[255.80 - 260.24] through right and it finally gets down
[257.84 - 264.28] to that hot spot and it hits it and now
[260.24 - 267.84] you're nauseous or you got a pain you're
[264.28 - 270.20] going to think whoa it was that food
[267.84 - 271.76] food fear develops very easily because
[270.20 - 273.76] this this is just one example I'm going
[271.76 - 275.00] to cut so much into this information
[273.76 - 276.36] you're going to love it you are
[275.00 - 279.24] absolutely going to love this
[276.36 - 281.36] information so if you got a hot spot
[279.24 - 283.72] anywhere in your intestinal tract if you
[281.36 - 285.48] got a hot spot in your dadum see you got
[283.72 - 288.36] a lot of inflammation in your dadum
[285.48 - 290.92] because you have H pylori or you have an
[288.36 - 293.92] old infection that's been fering in
[290.92 - 296.56] there for 10 years 15 years say you got
[293.92 - 299.16] all this extra yeast and mold growing in
[296.56 - 301.12] here you're inflamed because of a virus
[299.16 - 302.96] or say like a shinkles virus creating
[301.12 - 305.08] colitis or something else see you got
[302.96 - 307.36] diagnosed with crohn's whatever it is
[305.08 - 309.88] that's going on whatever's happening
[307.36 - 311.60] here you got a hot spot inside your
[309.88 - 313.32] intestinal tract and maybe it never went
[311.60 - 314.32] that far and you've never been diagnosed
[313.32 - 316.00] and you're just kind of like you're
[314.32 - 318.52] dealing with certain aches and pains or
[316.00 - 320.36] certain stomach cramps or flatulence or
[318.52 - 325.04] stomach issues or bloating whatever it
[320.36 - 326.96] is the food you eat you'll associated
[325.04 - 329.32] with those symptoms very quick and

[412.88 - 417.84] bloating gets
[414.44 - 420.44] worse was it the food that just did that
[417.84 - 422.84] could it have been or was it just it was
[420.44 - 424.64] going to happen you already have a
[422.84 - 426.56] problem you're already having bloting
[424.64 - 428.40] problems was it the food you ate the day
[426.56 - 431.48] before you may not even know was it the
[428.40 - 435.04] food you ate 3 days before is it even
[431.48 - 435.92] the food is it even the food but you
[435.04 - 438.92] know what
[435.92 - 440.84] happens this gets messed up right here
[438.92 - 445.00] and it gets messed up quick that's right
[440.84 - 448.76] you guys this gets messed up because
[445.00 - 452.72] this gets messed with it's so easy to go
[448.76 - 455.08] down a rabbit hole with eating and food
[452.72 - 457.48] and eating and food when you don't even
[455.08 - 460.52] know why you're even having a symptom or
[457.48 - 464.80] a condition or a problem and we easily
[460.52 - 467.80] associate a food we have instantly to a
[464.80 - 469.80] problem right so if I had some kind of
[467.80 - 472.52] inflammation because I had some strep in
[469.80 - 474.76] my intestinal tract or strep in my colon
[472.52 - 476.44] and I had some ecoli in my colon and
[474.76 - 478.80] it's creating all kinds of different
[476.44 - 481.00] pivots and divots inside my colon and
[478.80 - 483.84] intestinal track just say I had that
[481.00 - 486.72] right and then I'm eating something or
[483.84 - 488.96] whatever it is and then I'm not feeling
[486.72 - 491.52] good because that's starting to ache
[488.96 - 492.96] down here or however it is I'm going to
[491.52 - 494.96] be so messed up in my head I'm going to
[492.96 - 498.00] be like I I don't know if it was that
[494.96 - 501.08] maybe I should just have some toast some
[498.00 - 503.64] dry toast or something and scrape off
[501.08 - 506.20] the burnt stuff off the toast and just
[503.64 - 509.16] have that plain I'm nauseous I got some
[506.20 - 511.64] pain it confuses people everything does
[509.16 - 513.40] no matter what it is that they have you
[511.64 - 515.12] know going on and there's people who are
[513.40 - 516.48] suffering from bloating constantly and
[515.12 - 518.48] they want to get rid of that bloating so
[516.48 - 519.92] they get told to drink celery juice
[518.48 - 522.08] because they hear about it working and
[519.92 - 523.56] saving lives and they go and they have
[522.08 - 524.84] some and they're bloating still there
[523.56 - 526.68] and they're like oh it's the celery
[524.84 - 528.52] juice the celery juice is causing the
[526.68 - 531.08] problem now it's every day it's a new
[528.52 - 533.72] thing causing a problem and we get the
[531.08 - 536.08] food fear so the food fear just goes
[533.72 - 538.56] crazy in our minds and rightfully so
[536.08 - 541.28] because it's that confusing and that
[538.56 - 543.68] difficult to navigate and so people
[541.28 - 545.08] don't realize the minute you start
[543.68 - 546.48] getting sick the minute you start
[545.08 - 547.96] getting symptoms unless you've
[546.48 - 550.88] experienced this do you know what I'm
[547.96 - 553.28] talking about it's that intense
[550.88 - 555.96] wondering wish over there on YouTube my
[553.28 - 558.84] mind has been messed up with that is for
[555.96 - 561.36] sure hard to undo it especially when you
[558.84 - 563.64] just want to be normal again you can go
[561.36 - 565.80] down this rabbit hole and down and down
[563.64 - 567.48] it and down it and down and it can get
[565.80 - 569.96] really difficult for a lot of people you
[567.48 - 571.92] don't know what the heck to eat
[569.96 - 573.92] you just don't know like what do I eat
[571.92 - 575.64] what's okay can I have eggs oh eggs feel

[754.72 - 760.80] PTSD so every time you put food in your
[758.32 - 762.92] mouth this can develop into an eating
[760.80 - 765.60] disorder where you're actually getting a
[762.92 - 767.72] PTSD eating disorder where every time
[765.60 - 771.88] food is entering into your mouth you're
[767.72 - 773.84] scared you're afraid now you're worried
[771.88 - 777.04] you're worried like is it going to be
[773.84 - 779.32] okay is it going to hurt I don't feel so
[777.04 - 781.60] good that food doesn't work for me and
[779.32 - 785.24] then you'll instantly cast out foods
[781.60 - 786.92] that actually are there to help you heal
[785.24 - 791.24] and recover
[786.92 - 794.52] you but yet you might accidentally keep
[791.24 - 795.96] foods that are not helping you and you
[794.52 - 797.96] keep them in because they feel good in
[795.96 - 800.56] the moment it seems so that's where the
[797.96 - 803.56] confusion lies as well we sit there we
[800.56 - 806.72] don't know what to eat exactly and we'll
[803.56 - 809.16] eat a food that seems to settle okay
[806.72 - 811.32] feel okay but little do we know that
[809.16 - 813.56] food's feeding a problem a condition
[811.32 - 816.28] it's feeding some kind of virus or
[813.56 - 818.80] pathogen it's adding to a problem it's
[816.28 - 820.80] putting pressure on your pancreas more
[818.80 - 823.80] issues to your liver more sluggishness
[820.80 - 825.88] to your liver and you don't realize it
[823.80 - 827.92] and now you're just like okay I don't
[825.88 - 829.48] know what's good what's bad cuz then 3
[827.92 - 831.12] days later you're eating a food that
[829.48 - 832.80] seems to be comfortable and seems to be
[831.12 - 835.04] working 3 days later now you're getting
[832.80 - 836.52] sicker and you don't know what to do you
[835.04 - 837.80] don't know what it is and then you're
[836.52 - 839.52] like well I better eat something
[837.80 - 843.16] healthier I better try something
[839.52 - 846.20] healthier let me eat a salad let me eat
[843.16 - 848.44] some vegetables and then you're eating
[846.20 - 850.32] some crunchy vegetable you're chomping
[848.44 - 853.12] on a carrot that's something that a lot
[850.32 - 855.24] of people go to instantly that aren't
[853.12 - 857.12] eating that healthy and they don't know
[855.24 - 858.80] what to eat they're like okay I better
[857.12 - 860.52] do something good for myself I better
[858.80 - 863.44] eat something healthy and they end up
[860.52 - 865.40] chomping on a Raw carrot what happens
[863.44 - 866.88] when they do that they're they're
[865.40 - 869.56] they're cre they're jumping on a Raw
[866.88 - 872.32] carrot all this roughage is coming from
[869.56 - 874.76] that hard kind of like crunchy Raw
[872.32 - 877.24] carrot they send it down the track
[874.76 - 878.96] they're inflamed in weird little spots
[877.24 - 881.64] like in their intestinal tract or the
[878.96 - 883.60] bottom of their dadum they're inflamed
[881.64 - 885.84] they got a problem whether it's H pylori
[883.60 - 888.60] or stpy coli or something else going on
[885.84 - 891.48] or Ci or something and then when the
[888.60 - 894.88] food when the when the carrots the
[891.48 - 897.08] crunchy carrots that fibrous carrot
[894.88 - 899.28] starts to head down there it hits the
[897.08 - 901.00] hot spot and now they're nauseous
[899.28 - 903.00] they're nauseous they're sick they're
[901.00 - 905.04] like what's wrong with me I can't even
[903.00 - 907.00] eat a carrot I was told carrots are
[905.04 - 909.00] healthy and now they're all of a sudden
[907.00 - 913.36] scared they're in fear now they're
[909.00 - 915.56] eating butter on toast with an egg or
[913.36 - 917.24] they're eating cheese and they're like
[915.56 - 919.36] that's that's the only thing I can eat
[917.24 - 921.72] is a piece of cheese or an egg or a
[919.36 - 923.48] piece of toast and they end up in that
[921.72 - 925.52] situation where they're pretty much on
[923.48 - 926.96] toast egg and cheese diet I don't know
[925.52 - 930.28] if you guys have ever seen that it's
[926.96 - 932.36] like milk toast eggs and cheese that's
[930.28 - 935.28] what they end up in or rice pudding
[932.36 - 937.76] that's another one too Tressa oh my God
[935.28 - 940.20] you are talking directly to my mom right
[937.76 - 941.92] now she's really struggling this an
[940.20 - 944.36] important topic I'm so sorry your mom's
[941.92 - 945.92] struggling right now my heart pours out
[944.36 - 949.88] to her by the way okay
[945.92 - 952.40] Teressa um juwel says yes my head got
[949.88 - 955.40] messed up because I was so afraid to eat
[952.40 - 957.40] and this is a really critical critical
[955.40 - 959.68] topic because it's happening every day
[957.40 - 961.44] to people new people every day people
[959.68 - 963.68] who have already been sick too every
[961.44 - 965.80] single day Lisa says this is me over
[963.68 - 967.36] there on IG I'm so sorry you guys
[965.80 - 970.20] struggled with this along the way I'm
[967.36 - 972.00] hitting the intestinal track talk first
[970.20 - 974.36] with this issue but we're going to go
[972.00 - 976.48] deeper into other places of how it works
[974.36 - 978.76] with your brain how it works with
[976.48 - 981.48] emotions how it works with creating the
[978.76 - 983.00] eating disorder the food fear because
[981.48 - 985.32] that's what we're talking about here is
[983.00 - 987.24] food fear and it's food fear developed
[985.32 - 989.60] from not feeling good and getting a
[987.24 - 991.64] symptom not knowing what to eat still
[989.60 - 993.80] struggling with that symptom associating
[991.64 - 995.76] that food with that symptom and then
[993.80 - 997.64] we're now down a rabbit hole that's what
[995.76 - 999.12] we're talking about today so let's go
[997.64 - 1002.28] into it first I want to take a little
[999.12 - 1004.60] sip here I want to finish some of my
[1002.28 - 1008.20] aren't you here if that's okay with you
[1004.60 - 1010.40] guys tra said this oh wait um TR said
[1008.20 - 1013.36] this is exactly my mother explanation
[1010.40 - 1016.16] points this is wild you're touching on
[1013.36 - 1018.92] exactly everything she's going through
[1016.16 - 1021.44] it's like you heard our prayers when
[1018.92 - 1024.76] listen and I want to talk about to you
[1021.44 - 1026.72] something very important okay that that
[1024.76 - 1029.24] you can heal and you can get better and
[1026.72 - 1031.76] you can recover and get past this
[1029.24 - 1033.80] there's a way also to understanding how
[1031.76 - 1035.68] this works with Foods where you're
[1033.80 - 1037.04] feeling this way and you're afraid and
[1035.68 - 1039.16] you're having that food fear but there's
[1037.04 - 1040.96] a way to come out of it and just having
[1039.16 - 1043.68] this knowledge alone is going to help
[1040.96 - 1044.92] people out there because once you
[1043.68 - 1046.48] understand this a little bit you
[1044.92 - 1049.12] understand your body then you understand
[1046.48 - 1051.56] what's going on you could rise above the
[1049.12 - 1054.04] food fear and the eating disorders that
[1051.56 - 1057.12] are created and the PTSD that's created
[1054.04 - 1059.24] from it it's all important Catalina over
[1057.12 - 1063.24] there in IG this is exactly how I felt
[1059.24 - 1065.28] for three years whoa three years whoa
[1063.24 - 1068.72] where I'm scared to eat because
[1065.28 - 1070.40] everything makes me bloated and then
[1068.72 - 1072.00] it's scary and here's what happens on
[1070.40 - 1073.64] that one since we are in the intestinal
[1072.00 - 1075.76] tract talk let's go into bloating a
[1073.64 - 1078.52] little bit bloating can come and go at
[1075.76 - 1082.16] random times could be intermittent or
[1078.52 - 1086.12] always always there right always there
[1082.16 - 1089.20] but worse less worse still there and
[1086.12 - 1092.80] always there worse less worse still
[1089.20 - 1096.20] there and always there worse worse
[1092.80 - 1098.92] really bad and then B back down to not
[1096.20 - 1101.04] so bad scale 1 to 10 my bloating is

[1113.24 - 1117.00] bloating is down a little bit later on

[1117.00 - 1121.00] up back to 11 back to 12 is your head
[1118.92 - 1122.72] spinning my head's spinning that's how
[1121.00 - 1123.84] hard it is and that's what people go
[1122.72 - 1127.32] through right
[1123.84 - 1127.32] there hang on a
[1128.92 - 1133.76] sec just I got a celery juice here too
[1131.88 - 1137.72] and a grapefruit juice
[1133.76 - 1139.56] here and no this is not a juice
[1137.72 - 1141.72] fast
[1139.56 - 1141.72] all
[1144.32 - 1151.00] right I took the celery force and
[1148.84 - 1152.32] forgive me but I talk faster I have to
[1151.00 - 1155.16] try to slow it
[1152.32 - 1158.68] down I talk faster after I take the
[1155.16 - 1162.24] celery Force I'm just telling you okay
[1158.68 - 1165.64] after I take this I talk faster it can

[1184.84 - 1190.36] yeah all right back to
[1188.08 - 1192.08] this let's go into the bloating thing a
[1190.36 - 1194.64] little bit the bloating thing is a
[1192.08 - 1197.96] tricky one because you can be bloated
[1194.64 - 1200.08] from something you ate 2 days ago and
[1197.96 - 1201.80] then it still has you bloated and then
[1200.08 - 1204.60] you eat something that can get rid of
[1201.80 - 1207.04] your bloat so you drink or eat something
[1204.60 - 1211.16] that can get rid of your bloat and but
[1207.04 - 1215.24] you're now bloated you're bloated from
[1211.16 - 1218.24] something else before days ago even a
[1215.24 - 1219.60] week ago and now you're trying to eat
[1218.24 - 1222.52] something or take something or drink
[1219.60 - 1226.96] something that can fix your bloating if
[1222.52 - 1229.32] you knew to do it long term if you knew
[1226.96 - 1231.80] to do it long enough
[1229.32 - 1234.04] it could fix it but you'll never know
[1231.80 - 1236.16] because you'll never know you're still
[1234.04 - 1237.96] bloated you don't know to do something
[1236.16 - 1239.64] longterm enough you won't know what to
[1237.96 - 1242.20] avoid a lot of people won't know what to
[1239.64 - 1244.80] avoid and then we run into a
[1242.20 - 1248.28] problem Michelle haters attacking the
[1244.80 - 1251.48] way we eat is just sad yep haters are
[1248.28 - 1254.16] really sad they are it's a lot of
[1251.48 - 1256.60] varieties of haters too like a lot of
[1254.16 - 1259.36] varieties of haters there's different
[1256.60 - 1263.56] Garden varieties of haters and then
[1259.36 - 1266.12] there's just evil evil Sinister haters
[1263.56 - 1268.64] and then there's demonically possessed
[1266.12 - 1270.96] haters that are evil to and then there's
[1268.64 - 1273.60] just I mean it's there's a whole
[1270.96 - 1275.68] different ladder of haters by the way
[1273.60 - 1277.56] there's jealous haters there's haters
[1275.68 - 1279.28] that want to destroy you there's haters
[1277.56 - 1281.32] that want to kill you there's haters
[1279.28 - 1283.24] that just want to see you whatever dead
[1281.32 - 1284.80] and then there's haters that just they
[1283.24 - 1286.40] can't help it they're just so jealous
[1284.80 - 1287.92] they just want to create problems
[1286.40 - 1290.64] there's a lot of haters out there all
[1287.92 - 1294.12] right that's the hater scale thank you
[1290.64 - 1296.36] celer force can we thank you celer force
[1294.12 - 1298.36] we'll do a whole hater scale right here
[1296.36 - 1301.16] we'll run through it really quick all
[1298.36 - 1304.76] right let's
[1301.16 - 1306.72] move so basically the bottom line is
[1304.76 - 1308.00] what I see in a lot of people and plus
[1306.72 - 1309.56] with the bloating and it wasn't going to
[1308.00 - 1311.72] be a bloating talk but it's good to talk
[1309.56 - 1314.24] about it a little bit what
[1311.72 - 1316.96] happens is
[1314.24 - 1320.28] that the HCL is so diminished your
[1316.96 - 1322.60] gastric glands are so diminished
[1320.28 - 1324.88] you have a lot of things growing in here
[1322.60 - 1328.24] that shouldn't be growing in
[1324.88 - 1330.24] here your liver stagnant and
[1328.24 - 1333.28] sluggish and you're
[1330.24 - 1336.52] bloating okay it has to be rectified it
[1333.28 - 1338.76] has to heal it you have to recover you
[1336.52 - 1342.12] have to get the bloating down like
[1338.76 - 1345.20] celery juice is critical for recovering
[1342.12 - 1347.32] bloat because it's restoring your HCL
[1345.20 - 1349.04] it's restoring your gastric glands it's
[1347.32 - 1352.60] killing off pathogens
[1349.04 - 1354.96] yeast mold overgrowth of unproductive
[1352.60 - 1357.68] fungus that's important all on its own
[1354.96 - 1358.68] it's a medical medium tool you guys know
[1357.68 - 1360.00] that tool and there's a lot of other
[1358.68 - 1362.64] medical medium tools to get rid of
[1360.00 - 1365.32] bloating but the point is is that in
[1362.64 - 1368.80] order though to get rid of
[1365.32 - 1372.16] bloating one has to understand that they
[1368.80 - 1374.88] may be eating foods that aren't creating
[1372.16 - 1377.88] their bloating but they're going to help
[1374.88 - 1380.04] you get to the finish line but what
[1377.88 - 1383.48] happens with bloating is you may eat a
[1380.04 - 1386.28] healthy food that's going to help you
[1383.48 - 1388.92] get to the finish line but instead you
[1386.28 - 1390.44] get bloated because you're so hypers
[1388.92 - 1394.56] sensitive that you're going to bloat so
[1390.44 - 1398.20] easy you become afraid of that food you
[1394.56 - 1400.64] become afraid of 4 oz of celery juice
[1398.20 - 1403.88] you become afraid of
[1400.64 - 1407.16] papaya afraid of a steamed
[1403.88 - 1410.36] potato you become afraid of a wild
[1407.16 - 1411.60] blueberry you become afraid of something
[1410.36 - 1413.56] and then you're in this place where
[1411.60 - 1416.84] you're afraid now of spinach you're
[1413.56 - 1418.88] afraid of a leafy graen and when you get
[1416.84 - 1421.64] to that point of fear and you don't know
[1418.88 - 1423.88] what to eat we end up going to comfort
[1421.64 - 1425.68] Foods foods that we've been eating since
[1423.88 - 1427.52] we were a child foods that we've been
[1425.68 - 1430.00] eating since we were young and we end up
[1427.52 - 1433.04] running to like eggs cheese and toast
[1430.00 - 1436.28] again we end up running back to Pasta
[1433.04 - 1438.44] macaroni and cheese eggs toast we end up
[1436.28 - 1440.40] running back to bread we end up running
[1438.44 - 1442.44] running back to these kinds of foods or
[1440.40 - 1444.84] we end up running back to treats and
[1442.44 - 1446.76] chocolate and things like that because
[1444.84 - 1449.28] we don't know where to go we get
[1446.76 - 1451.92] stressed we're totally frustrated with
[1449.28 - 1454.76] our healing process and what's wrong and
[1451.92 - 1456.96] we just we go running for things that
[1454.76 - 1460.64] aren't going to help us and it happens
[1456.96 - 1463.96] every day out there mono eating is a
[1460.64 - 1465.52] miracle okay a miracle for people so I'm
[1463.96 - 1468.84] going to grab the cleanse the heel book
[1465.52 - 1472.56] right here all right so Medical medium
[1468.84 - 1474.88] put mono eating um on the map all these
[1472.56 - 1479.44] years and it's important to understand
[1474.88 - 1482.60] how it works right when you do like
[1479.44 - 1486.04] aano eating where it's like bananas and
[1482.60 - 1487.84] celery juice or steam potatoes and
[1486.04 - 1490.12] celery juice and if you look you'll see
[1487.84 - 1492.20] the different varieties in here what
[1490.12 - 1492.96] happens is that you end up building up
[1492.20 - 1496.72] your
[1492.96 - 1499.12] HCL you end up healing the environment
[1496.72 - 1502.36] in your intestinal tract you end up
[1499.12 - 1504.32] reducing pathogen loads and you end up
[1502.36 - 1506.68] recovering so so many people go to the
[1504.32 - 1509.64] mono eating and cleanse the heel because
[1506.68 - 1512.48] it literally saves their life it saves
[1509.64 - 1515.16] them from surgeries I can't tell you how
[1512.48 - 1516.60] many people that have reached out out
[1515.16 - 1519.60] there in the world in medical Med
[1516.60 - 1522.52] community that were able to avoid a
[1519.60 - 1524.72] surgery where their doctor their surgeon
[1522.52 - 1526.48] said you don't have to get 20 in of your
[1524.72 - 1529.80] colon cut out you don't have to get 20
[1526.48 - 1533.76] in of your intestinal tract cut out
[1529.80 - 1536.72] and they actually literally save their
[1533.76 - 1539.56] themselves from radical surgical
[1536.72 - 1542.60] procedures because you're doing the mono
[1539.56 - 1545.80] cleanse okay in cleanse to heal it's
[1542.60 - 1548.00] that powerful and then once you heal a
[1545.80 - 1550.28] lot of the hot spots in here too so once
[1548.00 - 1552.52] you heal a lot of the hot spots you can
[1550.28 - 1554.84] add more healing tools you don't have to
[1552.52 - 1556.72] be on the monoc cleanse forever a lot of
[1554.84 - 1559.08] people they go on the monoc cleanse for
[1556.72 - 1560.88] just a short time and they just correct
[1559.08 - 1563.12] themselves they reable themselves it's
[1560.88 - 1566.12] incredible a lot of people go on it
[1563.12 - 1568.60] longer see KY shelman says over there on
[1566.12 - 1570.96] YouTube Anthony you suggest it you
[1568.60 - 1573.48] suggested monoc cleanse to me and this
[1570.96 - 1576.44] greatly turned around my food
[1573.48 - 1579.76] sensitivities it greatly projected me on
[1576.44 - 1582.88] my healing Journey thank you um Casey
[1579.76 - 1584.16] shelman thank you for that comment what
[1582.88 - 1585.16] happens is that a lot of people with
[1584.16 - 1588.44] food
[1585.16 - 1590.96] sensitivities the monoc cleanse corrects
[1588.44 - 1592.92] them starts to restore the person moves
[1590.96 - 1594.24] them P back out of this and I'm talking
[1592.92 - 1596.52] about the monoc cleans cuz so many
[1594.24 - 1598.56] people have food fear and if they have a
[1596.52 - 1601.12] symptom or condition anything intestinal
[1598.56 - 1602.92] tract anything stomach anything like
[1601.12 - 1607.68] that that they're suffering and
[1602.92 - 1610.84] struggling with it's now a game of PTSD
[1607.68 - 1613.60] what do I eat food
[1610.84 - 1615.48] fear and we end up with this eating
[1613.60 - 1616.96] disorder around all of it and we're
[1615.48 - 1618.40] suffering and we're struggling and we
[1616.96 - 1620.20] don't know how to get out of it but when
[1618.40 - 1621.60] you have direction and you know what to
[1620.20 - 1623.84] do and you end up doing something like
[1621.60 - 1625.76] the medical medium monoc cleanse and you
[1623.84 - 1627.72] choose one that's right for you just
[1625.76 - 1629.00] choose the one that you feel will work
[1627.72 - 1630.60] because that's the whole thing you can
[1629.00 - 1633.12] choose different ones in here you could
[1630.60 - 1635.12] try one try another and then what
[1633.12 - 1638.40] happens is as you're recovering at least
[1635.12 - 1642.20] you have a a schematic at least you have
[1638.40 - 1644.48] a catalyst to actually adhere by to take
[1642.20 - 1646.28] you to that finish line where you don't
[1644.48 - 1649.56] have to be always questioning things
[1646.28 - 1651.64] like is this not good is this not good
[1649.56 - 1653.32] because you don't have to question
[1651.64 - 1655.48] something that's literally saved that
[1653.32 - 1657.20] many lives and healed that many people
[1655.48 - 1659.20] the track record the street credit is
[1657.20 - 1660.80] already built into this so it's not like
[1659.20 - 1663.04] you're going to it like did anybody ever
[1660.80 - 1664.60] get better oh yeah Millions have with
[1663.04 - 1668.48] the medical medium books but the monoc
[1664.60 - 1670.88] cleanses so many have recovered avoided

[1700.56 - 1705.36] that hot spots we're talking about how
[1703.08 - 1708.08] someone could be like I can't eat any
[1705.36 - 1711.64] vegetables I cannot eat any Raw veget
[1708.08 - 1714.92] vegetables aw I can't eat raw lettuce I
[1711.64 - 1718.48] can't eat raw greens I can't eat
[1714.92 - 1720.32] anything raw it hurts my stomach and it
[1718.48 - 1722.00] doesn't digest and what they don't
[1720.32 - 1723.44] realize when they can't eat some raw
[1722.00 - 1725.68] spinach or they can't eat some raw
[1723.44 - 1730.04] Tomatoes or raw cucumbers what they
[1725.68 - 1733.36] don't realize is the cucumber is
[1730.04 - 1736.00] digesting the tomato is
[1733.36 - 1738.08] digesting the lettuce is
[1736.00 - 1740.64] digesting they don't think it's diges
[1738.08 - 1744.32] gesting but it is but what they're
[1740.64 - 1747.20] feeling is inflamed nerves attached to
[1744.32 - 1750.20] the Linings of the intestinal
[1747.20 - 1753.64] track so they're
[1750.20 - 1755.64] feeling inflamed areas along the
[1753.64 - 1758.68] intestinal
[1755.64 - 1762.16] track they're feeling hot
[1758.68 - 1764.64] spots is what they're feeling so as the
[1762.16 - 1766.44] lettuce is moving through and the
[1764.64 - 1769.52] tomatoes are moving
[1766.44 - 1772.48] through and the cucumbers are moving
[1769.52 - 1775.48] through it's hitting a hot spot and
[1772.48 - 1780.96] they're going I'm not digesting this I'm
[1775.48 - 1780.96] not digesting this I don't think I'm
[1781.08 - 1786.60] digesting I can't eat a cucumber ever
[1783.48 - 1790.12] again I can't eat a raw cucumber ever
[1786.60 - 1792.20] again I can't eat a tomato I can't eat
[1790.12 - 1794.24] lettuce ever
[1792.20 - 1797.80] again what they don't
[1794.24 - 1799.80] realize is it's okay to eat the lettuce
[1797.80 - 1801.76] it's it's okay to eat the Cucumber it's
[1799.80 - 1805.28] okay to eat the tomato but then they're
[1801.76 - 1807.76] in fear that it's not okay because
[1805.28 - 1810.96] they're feeling something but what they
[1807.76 - 1814.04] don't realize is they're feeling a hot
[1810.96 - 1816.20] spot they're feeling a Hot Spot
[1814.04 - 1817.20] somewhere whether it's a hot spot where
[1816.20 - 1819.52] it's just
[1817.20 - 1823.36] bloat or it's a hot spot where they're
[1819.52 - 1826.76] feeling a cramp or some pressure or a
[1823.36 - 1829.40] little bit of pain or discomfort or
[1826.76 - 1832.00] something else and they're feeling like
[1829.40 - 1833.64] they're not digesting that raw lettuce
[1832.00 - 1835.16] they feel like they're not digesting
[1833.64 - 1837.76] those tomatoes and
[1835.16 - 1839.84] cucumbers and that orange they eat or
[1837.76 - 1843.40] whatever it is and they're just like I
[1839.84 - 1846.44] cannot eat citrus I cannot ever have
[1843.40 - 1848.64] citrus I can never have a cucumber I
[1846.44 - 1850.96] can't have a tomato rolled out rolled
[1848.64 - 1853.24] out they rolled out one out no Citrus no
[1850.96 - 1856.64] cucumber no tomato No cilantro no
[1853.24 - 1859.64] spinach no lettuce no kale no mosh no
[1856.64 - 1862.20] this no that they've rolled it all out
[1859.64 - 1863.92] gone gone gone they can't have a raw
[1862.20 - 1866.56] piece of broccoli ever you can't have a
[1863.92 - 1870.28] raw piece of cauliflower anymore all
[1866.56 - 1871.56] those are ruled out and gone so we have
[1870.28 - 1874.88] this problem
[1871.56 - 1876.80] where they can't eat anything raw
[1874.88 - 1880.44] completely ruled out so now they're in
[1876.80 - 1883.84] that zone nothing raw so what that means
[1880.44 - 1885.92] is they won't even have any raw juice
[1883.84 - 1887.96] they won't have raw celery they won't
[1885.92 - 1889.28] have raw celery juice which is different
[1887.96 - 1891.36] different and it works differently you
[1889.28 - 1894.44] guys know the whole rules with celery
[1891.36 - 1896.80] juice 16 o on an empty
[1894.44 - 1899.84] stomach
[1896.80 - 1902.28] strained right strained so it can get in
[1899.84 - 1904.28] there do its thing flush clean the liver
[1902.28 - 1906.76] rebuild the H hydrochloric acid get
[1904.28 - 1910.28] things back to back to square
[1906.76 - 1911.68] one but the point is all that roughage
[1910.28 - 1913.84] they they'll never be able to eat a
[1911.68 - 1916.96] carrot rolled out carrots
[1913.84 - 1918.52] gone raw cabbage in a salad raw cabbage
[1916.96 - 1922.52] is gone
[1918.52 - 1926.36] everything by heirloom tomatoes
[1922.52 - 1930.48] gone so you walk down red bell peppers
[1926.36 - 1931.88] gone so just suddenly it's food fear I
[1930.48 - 1935.16] can't eat
[1931.88 - 1939.60] anything all of these foods are
[1935.16 - 1942.32] gone Apple peaches nectarines Cherries
[1939.60 - 1944.76] Berries
[1942.32 - 1947.96] gone melons
[1944.76 - 1950.60] gone it just disappears it's out of your
[1947.96 - 1954.16] diet now so now you're like I can only
[1950.60 - 1957.08] do cook food or
[1954.16 - 1958.08] toast or eggs and I hear eggs are so
[1957.08 - 1959.52] healthy and blah blah blah and
[1958.08 - 1961.64] everybody's talking about eggs so let me
[1959.52 - 1963.16] go on a whole bunch of eggs four or six
[1961.64 - 1965.56] eggs a day because it's the only thing I
[1963.16 - 1968.52] can eat because it doesn't seem to hurt
[1965.56 - 1971.44] when I eat an egg so what they don't
[1968.52 - 1973.60] realize is they end up losing all these
[1971.44 - 1976.64] foods that can help them
[1973.60 - 1978.16] heal but then because they don't
[1976.64 - 1979.64] understand and how know how to read
[1978.16 - 1981.56] their hot
[1979.64 - 1982.92] spots and they think they're not
[1981.56 - 1985.32] digesting it
[1982.92 - 1988.88] whatsoever and they have food fear to
[1985.32 - 1991.72] towards all these foods and then they
[1988.88 - 1995.84] eat an egg and they don't feel anything
[1991.72 - 1999.84] no hot spot no problem no discomfort
[1995.84 - 2003.00] they eat a nice fluffy scrambled egg
[1999.84 - 2005.08] they need a n they eat a nice batch of
[2003.00 - 2007.60] fluffy egg
[2005.08 - 2010.16] whites and it goes down in here they get
[2007.60 - 2011.88] a hard-boiled egg and it goes down and
[2010.16 - 2013.84] it sits in here and what's happening
[2011.88 - 2016.96] what they don't realize is the egg is
[2013.84 - 2020.76] liquefying it's turning into a goo and
[2016.96 - 2023.44] that goo isn't massaging the intestinal
[2020.76 - 2025.72] tract it's not massaging the colon It's
[2023.44 - 2027.52] not massaging the stomach and what's
[2025.72 - 2031.40] happening is that egg is just turning
[2027.52 - 2034.88] into a little like a ball of glue forget
[2031.40 - 2038.16] eggs that bread is turning into a ball
[2034.88 - 2041.12] of glue forget bread that cheese is
[2038.16 - 2043.56] turning into a ball of glue and it's
[2041.12 - 2044.88] sitting in there and it feels okay it
[2043.56 - 2047.76] feels
[2044.88 - 2050.12] good hey that bread pasta
[2047.76 - 2053.44] basically that wheat
[2050.12 - 2056.60] pasta with the cheese sitting in there
[2053.44 - 2058.08] like goo and it's not touching anything
[2056.60 - 2061.00] so it's not touching any of the hot
[2058.08 - 2063.40] spots you're not getting red flags no
[2061.00 - 2065.44] red flag here no red flag there no red
[2063.40 - 2067.16] flag there but what's happening is the
[2065.44 - 2069.52] eggs the dairy products the cheese the
[2067.16 - 2072.20] milk the butter all of that that's
[2069.52 - 2076.48] sitting in here is
[2072.20 - 2076.48] feeding what's keeping you
[2077.20 - 2082.72] sick it's feeding what's keeping you
[2084.12 - 2089.84] sick and then you end up with the same
[2087.44 - 2091.96] symptoms no matter what that come and go
[2089.84 - 2093.96] so now it's not like every symptoms gone
[2091.96 - 2098.00] cuz you're eating milk eggs cheese and
[2093.96 - 2099.80] butter and bread and it's becoming a goo
[2098.00 - 2101.36] and it's not touching anything inside
[2099.80 - 2104.08] and it's becoming a goo it's not hitting
[2101.36 - 2106.92] any hot spots for the moment but you
[2104.08 - 2109.24] stay sick you end up getting sicker and
[2106.92 - 2112.32] then all of a sudden because everything
[2109.24 - 2114.92] you're eating is feeding the bad bugs
[2112.32 - 2118.08] the bacteria the unproductive yeast the
[2114.92 - 2119.84] unproductive fungus and mold the viruses
[2118.08 - 2123.16] because what you're eating is feeding
[2119.84 - 2126.40] all of that you all of a sudden get a

[2138.12 - 2143.28] happy and it spilled over and it blew up
[2141.44 - 2146.00] and now you're

[2384.48 - 2389.12] their life and they're eating just as
[2387.04 - 2392.80] anybody else would be eating and then
[2389.12 - 2395.44] these symptoms start to develop you're
[2392.80 - 2397.12] eating when everybody else is eating
[2395.44 - 2401.16] you're living your life you're getting a
[2397.12 - 2405.16] simp sympt and now the food becomes
[2401.16 - 2407.36] questionable this is so so powerful Andy
[2405.16 - 2409.80] melany over there on
[2407.36 - 2411.16] YouTube thank you for timestamping so
[2409.80 - 2412.64] many of those things you do on YouTube
[2411.16 - 2414.40] when you do the the comment and you
[2412.64 - 2416.64] timestamp it like you do that's actually
[2414.40 - 2419.76] really cool by the
[2416.64 - 2422.48] way in some cases if it's a chronic
[2419.76 - 2425.00] nausea for example then Foods become
[2422.48 - 2428.32] pick and choose a game of what's going
[2425.00 - 2431.80] to help ease this nausea then nausea
[2428.32 - 2436.76] hell the nausea hell have you been
[2431.80 - 2441.00] through it before it torments pregnant
[2436.76 - 2442.92] women who don't know what to eat they
[2441.00 - 2445.36] have a baby
[2442.92 - 2447.72] developing the baby developing needs
[2445.36 - 2449.72] nutrients the best
[2447.72 - 2453.28] nutrients the
[2449.72 - 2453.28] nausea is like
[2453.52 - 2458.92] this
[2455.24 - 2461.08] barrier to getting nutrient to the baby
[2458.92 - 2464.04] because when women become pregnant and
[2461.08 - 2465.96] they're nauseous all the time they end
[2464.04 - 2468.44] up choosing foods that are trying to
[2465.96 - 2470.16] work with the nausea versus choosing a
[2468.44 - 2472.92] food that's going to be really good for
[2470.16 - 2475.20] that early stage of development for the
[2472.92 - 2477.12] baby instead they're choosing things
[2475.20 - 2478.88] like anything to break the nausea
[2477.12 - 2481.00] they're choosing chocolate loaded with
[2478.88 - 2483.56] caffeine that's really bad
[2481.00 - 2485.60] for the tiny cells that are developing
[2483.56 - 2488.20] into a a
[2485.60 - 2490.04] fetus and so what's happening so they're
[2488.20 - 2492.48] choosing things that are they're trying
[2490.04 - 2495.72] to calm the nausea down the morning
[2492.48 - 2500.12] sickness so they're just eating gluten
[2495.72 - 2503.28] Rich toast with butter they're drinking
[2500.12 - 2505.68] coffee yes they're eating chocolate
[2503.28 - 2507.88] they're just eating pasta and cheese
[2505.68 - 2510.88] they're eating chocolate cake they're
[2507.88 - 2512.48] just working with the nausea no judgment
[2510.88 - 2515.36] nothing like that I'm giving you an
[2512.48 - 2519.00] example of how those early cells of the
[2515.36 - 2521.80] baby need celery
[2519.00 - 2526.16] juice they need sweet
[2521.80 - 2530.12] potatoes they need winter squash caboa
[2526.16 - 2532.36] squash they need beautiful red
[2530.12 - 2535.20] potatoes they need
[2532.36 - 2536.96] blueberries they need raspberries they
[2535.20 - 2539.56] need all of these things these early
[2536.96 - 2542.56] cells of the baby that are just
[2539.56 - 2545.04] developing need all of these foods but
[2542.56 - 2546.68] instead because of the nausea those
[2545.04 - 2548.92] Foods aren't on the list for a lot of
[2546.68 - 2550.80] women that get that early nausea with
[2548.92 - 2552.80] their early pregnancy and they're just
[2550.80 - 2555.72] looking for just glue they're looking
[2552.80 - 2558.24] for just glue they just kind of calm the
[2555.72 - 2558.24] nausea
[2558.48 - 2564.56] down okay in some cases if someone has
[2562.00 - 2567.60] chronic nausea and chronic nausea just
[2564.56 - 2571.32] minus the pregnancy like nausea in
[2567.60 - 2574.52] general can really rule the roost with
[2571.32 - 2577.84] food fear picking choices suffering and
[2574.52 - 2580.44] struggling the nausea is a big one Foods
[2577.84 - 2582.36] become pick and choose a game of what's
[2580.44 - 2584.32] going to help ease the nausea is this
[2582.36 - 2586.04] going to help ease the nausea today is
[2584.32 - 2588.44] this going to help let me try this let
[2586.04 - 2590.04] me try that no that doesn't work for me
[2588.44 - 2591.52] oh I better try some celery juice to
[2590.04 - 2593.60] ease the nausea oh it's not easy in the
[2591.52 - 2596.68] nausea oh never drink celery juice again
[2593.60 - 2599.00] it's a bad idea it becomes a pick and
[2596.68 - 2601.84] choose game of what's going to help ease
[2599.00 - 2604.48] this nausea what's not helping this
[2601.84 - 2606.80] nausea do any of these Foods I'm eating
[2604.48 - 2608.92] contribute to this nausea that's what it
[2606.80 - 2612.56] comes it becomes literally
[2608.92 - 2614.52] Madness you're not crazy nobody's crazy
[2612.56 - 2618.44] who's going through
[2614.52 - 2621.08] this but it creates a type of Madness
[2618.44 - 2623.88] with the nausey this is a prime example
[2621.08 - 2626.88] Deborah over there Deborah Lynn designs
[2623.88 - 2629.48] that was me nauseous for 6 months lost
[2626.88 - 2629.48] 20
[2629.52 - 2636.36] lbs how come when I'm not eating I still
[2632.84 - 2637.68] have the nausea there's that person the
[2636.36 - 2639.72] person that's still that's not even
[2637.68 - 2642.44] eating and they still have the nausea
[2639.72 - 2644.44] and then then there's the person who the
[2642.44 - 2647.28] nausea goes away when they're not eating
[2644.44 - 2649.52] so they're not eating and not eating and
[2647.28 - 2652.44] then when they pick a food and they get
[2649.52 - 2656.64] the nausea back they associate a
[2652.44 - 2660.56] whiplash to that food they grab an
[2656.64 - 2665.04] Apple the Apple they eat apple goes down
[2660.56 - 2668.48] to shoot they get the nausea the apples
[2665.04 - 2672.36] poison there's a mental Association to
[2668.48 - 2672.36] the Apple throw the Apple
[2673.48 - 2679.32] away leblanca says I definitely had food
[2676.76 - 2681.32] fear during pregnancy I was so scared to
[2679.32 - 2684.32] eat anything with
[2681.32 - 2687.44] seasoning
[2684.32 - 2689.64] indeed Jennifer gagnan says can you
[2687.44 - 2691.92] explain the cause of the nausea I threw
[2689.64 - 2695.36] up for nine months
[2691.92 - 2696.72] straight oh my God it's really difficult
[2695.36 - 2699.44] for so many people I'm so sorry you've
[2696.72 - 2699.44] gone for
[2699.48 - 2704.28] that do any of the foods I'm eating are
[2702.36 - 2706.64] they the reason for my nausea are they
[2704.28 - 2709.48] creating the nausea then our mind and
[2706.64 - 2711.28] our Consciousness starts to pick up on
[2709.48 - 2713.80] patterns and habits because of small
[2711.28 - 2716.80] bursts of PTSD developing did you hear
[2713.80 - 2719.88] that you guys you guys got to have this
[2716.80 - 2721.88] book tell other people about this book
[2719.88 - 2724.24] such a great
[2721.88 - 2728.00] book you eat something and you're
[2724.24 - 2730.84] nauseous so you identify
[2728.00 - 2734.40] that food as being the problem so you
[2730.84 - 2736.52] learn to avoid that food just as you get
[2734.40 - 2738.80] comfortable eating another food thinking
[2736.52 - 2741.24] you're safe and good you get nauseous
[2738.80 - 2743.60] again you just got comfortable with that
[2741.24 - 2744.88] food you're starting to eat an orange
[2743.60 - 2746.44] you're comfortable with that food it
[2744.88 - 2748.80] didn't give me nauseousness didn't give
[2746.44 - 2750.56] me nausea yesterday and now I got
[2748.80 - 2754.20] nauseousness today cuz I'm having that
[2750.56 - 2755.92] Orange Boom see you later orange Gone
[2754.20 - 2758.16] With the Wind
[2755.92 - 2759.64] man
[2758.16 - 2761.36] you just started getting comfortable
[2759.64 - 2763.48] with each food and then you're
[2761.36 - 2765.60] uncomfortable with that food so Kiss It
[2763.48 - 2767.68] Goodbye you think you're safe and you
[2765.60 - 2771.84] think you're good and then boom you're
[2767.68 - 2772.96] not safe anymore safeness is gone so
[2771.84 - 2774.92] then that's another food you're
[2772.96 - 2777.48] uncomfortable eating suspecting it's
[2774.92 - 2780.44] contributing to the problem is that my
[2777.48 - 2782.80] problem is it my problem this can carry
[2780.44 - 2785.12] on into other Foods as well nausea
[2782.80 - 2788.28] doesn't usually receive a diagnosis
[2785.12 - 2790.32] because nausea or maybe be nervous could
[2788.28 - 2792.84] maybe be nervousness and
[2790.32 - 2795.28] anxiety if everything checks out okay in
[2792.84 - 2797.24] the abdomen it's passed off as your just
[2795.28 - 2799.32] sensitive so nausea really is the
[2797.24 - 2801.08] diagnosis it doesn't really get a
[2799.32 - 2803.76] diagnosis especially if everything
[2801.08 - 2804.92] checks out okay if you're somebody with
[2803.76 - 2807.16] a mystery
[2804.92 - 2808.60] nausea and everything looks okay and
[2807.16 - 2812.12] checks out
[2808.60 - 2814.52] okay you're sensitive that's what is
[2812.12 - 2817.04] told to each person what's not told to
[2814.52 - 2820.04] the person is they might have a pathogen
[2817.04 - 2822.56] stirring the pot they might have a vagus
[2820.04 - 2824.16] nerve problem creating a problem they
[2822.56 - 2827.48] might have other things too you might
[2824.16 - 2829.36] have inflamed nerves vagus nerves going
[2827.48 - 2834.24] around your intestinal tract and so
[2829.36 - 2834.24] forth and it's giving you vagal
[2835.16 - 2841.00] nausea this mystery nausea can bring
[2837.68 - 2842.92] about serious Eating Disorders even when
[2841.00 - 2845.36] reaching out for help even when
[2842.92 - 2847.52] searching for a doctor or practitioner

[3256.60 - 3262.36] right your original symptoms don't even
[3259.32 - 3263.84] matter anymore it's like no I started
[3262.36 - 3265.28] out with a pain in my chest the
[3263.84 - 3267.12] tightness of my chest I started out and
[3265.28 - 3268.72] they said it was panic attack but then I
[3267.12 - 3270.20] got tingles and numbness in my arms and
[3268.72 - 3271.80] then I got this and then I got this now
[3270.20 - 3272.84] I got fatigue that doesn't matter
[3271.80 - 3274.28] anymore it's all about what you're
[3272.84 - 3277.68] eating
[3274.28 - 3280.60] now affirmation 65 over there in IG that
[3277.68 - 3285.00] was my life
[3280.60 - 3288.80] OMG you got an audience now you sought
[3285.00 - 3291.16] out doctors to get help but that's long
[3288.80 - 3293.84] been forgotten by the
[3291.16 - 3297.88] audience especially if you're like 21 or
[3293.84 - 3301.76] 25 years old or 28 years old or
[3297.88 - 3303.68] 18 years old or younger or however maybe
[3301.76 - 3306.16] in your 30s but either way you have an
[3303.68 - 3308.52] audience now and now you got like
[3306.16 - 3311.64] friends friends
[3308.52 - 3314.04] friends family family friends family
[3311.64 - 3316.04] friends co-workers families friends and
[3314.04 - 3318.08] they're all watching you and it isn't
[3316.04 - 3320.72] about your symptoms anymore it's just
[3318.08 - 3323.24] about you and your food and how you
[3320.72 - 3324.72] screwed up it's you and your food and
[3323.24 - 3326.32] how you have must have an eating
[3324.72 - 3328.00] disorder now and maybe your simp
[3326.32 - 3330.12] symptoms weren't really real to begin
[3328.00 - 3332.56] with maybe your digestive problems
[3330.12 - 3334.40] weren't really real maybe you're not
[3332.56 - 3337.04] really sick you were sick you got
[3334.40 - 3338.88] doctors saying you were sick I guess but
[3337.04 - 3340.16] all that's kind of drifting away because
[3338.88 - 3341.32] it's all about what you're putting in
[3340.16 - 3342.84] your mouth in your foods and your
[3341.32 - 3345.80] problems in your foods and that's
[3342.84 - 3349.84] compiling and compounding the PTSD
[3345.80 - 3351.20] causing now even more riffs more PTSD
[3349.84 - 3353.00] and now you feel like you're really down
[3351.20 - 3355.24] the rabbit hole and no one understands
[3353.00 - 3357.64] you and you're
[3355.24 - 3359.00] misunderstood Shan J over there on
[3357.64 - 3362.52] YouTube thank you for being here by the
[3359.00 - 3365.32] way you're speaking to me right now you
[3362.52 - 3368.32] said you commented amazing Cherry appan
[3365.32 - 3370.88] can relate to everything you're
[3368.32 - 3373.24] describing over there in IG family and
[3370.88 - 3376.12] friends could never understand it wasn't
[3373.24 - 3378.72] until I had to have emergency surgery
[3376.12 - 3383.04] that they believed
[3378.72 - 3386.60] me the focus is all gone now it's the
[3383.04 - 3390.28] focus on you're not eating enough are
[3386.60 - 3393.68] you eating enough you're eating too much
[3390.28 - 3396.72] you're getting too skinny you're looking
[3393.68 - 3401.08] sickly you need to put some meat on your
[3396.72 - 3404.20] bones are you getting enough
[3401.08 - 3407.84] protein and you're not eating the right
[3404.20 - 3408.80] things then the fear of eating occurs
[3407.84 - 3411.20] and
[3408.80 - 3413.32] intensifies and that's harder than
[3411.20 - 3415.32] anyone can understand and it happens
[3413.32 - 3416.84] every day out there there are people
[3415.32 - 3418.56] just you know
[3416.84 - 3420.60] there are people that Heckle the medical
[3418.56 - 3422.44] medum community and they're just trying
[3420.60 - 3423.96] to put fear and doubt in their minds are
[3422.44 - 3426.52] you getting enough protein are you
[3423.96 - 3429.32] getting enough protein there's so
[3426.52 - 3431.36] there's it's everywhere it's everywhere
[3429.32 - 3433.36] and when you're sick and struggling and
[3431.36 - 3437.44] you don't feel good it's like the
[3433.36 - 3440.56] vultures come in is what they do the
[3437.44 - 3442.68] vultures come in and they just say the
[3440.56 - 3444.44] rot in this crap and they don't
[3442.68 - 3446.56] understand what you've been through they
[3444.44 - 3450.36] don't know what your struggles are
[3446.56 - 3453.92] they're not in your shoes and at your
[3450.36 - 3453.92] home they don't get
[3454.48 - 3460.44] it even if you
[3456.96 - 3462.76] diagnos even if you're diagnosed with a
[3460.44 - 3465.24] named physical condition right off the
[3462.76 - 3467.24] bat it's easy to develop an eating
[3465.24 - 3469.00] disorder in part because there's still
[3467.24 - 3470.56] not a medical understanding of what
[3469.00 - 3474.64] causes the
[3470.56 - 3476.92] condition so it's not getting healed
[3474.64 - 3479.00] somebody with a simple case of heartburn
[3476.92 - 3480.72] acid reflux or exam for example can
[3479.00 - 3482.92] develop an eating disorder because it's
[3480.72 - 3483.64] always on their mind let's hit that a
[3482.92 - 3487.00] little
[3483.64 - 3490.16] bit W blueberry's over
[3487.00 - 3492.76] there the protein brainwashing has drove
[3490.16 - 3495.92] me crazy and we will have to deal with
[3492.76 - 3500.84] it for the rest of
[3495.92 - 3502.40] Life yeah this just that's powerful by
[3500.84 - 3505.68] the
[3502.40 - 3507.36] way okay so I want to go into this part
[3505.68 - 3509.12] this is interesting right here right
[3507.36 - 3511.96] even if it's something like a simple
[3509.12 - 3513.52] case of heartburn acid reflux you guys
[3511.96 - 3516.28] for example it can develop into an
[3513.52 - 3518.88] eating disorder because it's always on
[3516.28 - 3521.28] your mind because it's here it's like
[3518.88 - 3522.76] heartburn what do I eat oh that bothers
[3521.28 - 3525.72] me oh that doesn't bother me that
[3522.76 - 3528.00] doesn't bother me that bothers
[3525.72 - 3529.60] me a friend I haven't talked to in a
[3528.00 - 3531.64] long long time reached out to me and
[3529.60 - 3533.52] said you know I got this heartburn acid
[3531.64 - 3536.60] reflux thing I did all the testing at
[3533.52 - 3539.36] the doctor I did all this everything
[3536.60 - 3542.56] and um it's like I'm scared to eat
[3539.36 - 3544.68] anything ew scared to eat anything
[3542.56 - 3546.12] anything I eat I don't know this was
[3544.68 - 3548.56] working for me yesterday it's not
[3546.12 - 3551.64] working for me today this might work for
[3548.56 - 3556.76] me tomorrow but it didn't when tomorrow
[3551.64 - 3556.76] came yesterday and your mind goes wof
[3557.24 - 3562.48] W eating a food that seems to be working
[3560.20 - 3564.32] gives you a sense of security then if it
[3562.48 - 3566.48] isn't working anymore and the acid
[3564.32 - 3569.56] reflux or nausea returns it's like old
[3566.48 - 3571.56] friend letting you down old friend
[3569.56 - 3574.52] letting you down sometimes it's not
[3571.56 - 3576.20] about the symptoms sometimes experiences
[3574.52 - 3579.04] when you're eating that food it's about
[3576.20 - 3582.48] what they're told about that food so
[3579.04 - 3585.36] here's a real brain screw
[3582.48 - 3587.52] is even if you discover somewhere along
[3585.36 - 3589.92] the way the right food to eat to heal
[3587.52 - 3592.40] yourself some [ __ ] is going to like
[3589.92 - 3593.88] tell you that it's the wrong food and
[3592.40 - 3596.56] it's bad for
[3593.88 - 3600.84] you I don't know how anybody can heal
[3596.56 - 3603.52] anymore out there I just don't know it's
[3600.84 - 3605.56] that bad there's that many sick people
[3603.52 - 3609.20] and they're just biohacking themselves
[3605.56 - 3611.84] to death and everybody's like squealing
[3609.20 - 3614.88] like pics like do this do that buy my
[3611.84 - 3617.76] program do this eat this do
[3614.88 - 3619.84] that and darkness is rampant out there
[3617.76 - 3621.64] right now I don't know how people are
[3619.84 - 3624.00] going to survive in 10 years from now as
[3621.64 - 3626.36] it gets worse and worse and
[3624.00 - 3627.96] worse yeah they'll poach things for
[3626.36 - 3630.52] medical medium information that's healed
[3627.96 - 3632.80] people along the way but they'll mix it
[3630.52 - 3634.28] with crap that won't heal them I don't
[3632.80 - 3636.92] know how anybody's going to get better
[3634.28 - 3639.40] down down the road Natalie says the
[3636.92 - 3641.36] sickest and most narcissistic people
[3639.40 - 3643.56] prey on those trying to better
[3641.36 - 3647.44] themselves we live in a sick world it's
[3643.56 - 3651.40] overwhelming sometimes well
[3647.44 - 3654.40] spoken I could not have said that better
[3651.40 - 3657.04] myself Dr Fawn biohackers are hacking
[3654.40 - 3660.08] People's Health away indeed they're
[3657.04 - 3663.56] pecking People's Health
[3660.08 - 3665.80] away food has an ingrain connection to
[3663.56 - 3667.84] our physical being our physical
[3665.80 - 3669.84] understanding even if we aren't dealing
[3667.84 - 3672.32] with ongoing Health complaints if
[3669.84 - 3674.60] someone is home one evening gets some
[3672.32 - 3676.48] kind of chest pain for a minute and gets
[3674.60 - 3678.64] on the phone with family and friends the
[3676.48 - 3679.92] first thing everyone says is what did
[3678.64 - 3682.36] you eat
[3679.92 - 3685.52] tonight if that person decides to go to
[3682.36 - 3688.28] the ER the doctor asks what did you eat
[3685.52 - 3690.60] tonight night the question always comes
[3688.28 - 3692.60] up that's how interconnected we are with
[3690.60 - 3695.80] food in general and that's how we end up
[3692.60 - 3697.92] living with food fear like we are so
[3695.80 - 3700.00] interconnected it's one of those details
[3697.92 - 3701.96] that Patients First Volunteer every time
[3700.00 - 3703.72] they go into the ER to the hospital I
[3701.96 - 3706.20] ate this and this tonight I ate this
[3703.72 - 3708.36] tonight I ate this ter appan says when
[3706.20 - 3711.92] people try to frame medical medium yeah
[3708.36 - 3714.72] frame that is the word yes as
[3711.92 - 3717.16] restrictive and fear-mongering the only
[3714.72 - 3719.12] reason I can eat without excruciating
[3717.16 - 3721.16] pain and fear is because of medical
[3719.12 - 3723.36] medium information I was literally
[3721.16 - 3726.44] starving to death I couldn't eat thank
[3723.36 - 3726.44] you Tara you're the
[3726.64 - 3732.32] best I was sitting at home eating my
[3729.80 - 3735.12] dinner I had this terrible pain in my
[3732.32 - 3737.00] stomach my back my chest my lower
[3735.12 - 3739.24] abdomen I thought I don't know what I
[3737.00 - 3741.48] thought it come to the ER and that's the
[3739.24 - 3744.08] first thing people devou because the
[3741.48 - 3746.52] reason why they devou that information
[3744.08 - 3749.08] is because it's so intertwined to foods
[3746.52 - 3753.44] and eating and our health and foods and
[3749.08 - 3755.32] eating you guys I could go on all day
[3753.44 - 3757.68] long with this
[3755.32 - 3760.28] book that's how much incredible
[3757.68 - 3762.56] information is in this book Brain saver
[3760.28 - 3764.64] Casey shelman over there on YouTube I
[3762.56 - 3768.72] think sometimes it's jealousy and
[3764.64 - 3771.24] insecurity about how they eat
[3768.72 - 3773.28] sometimes projecting their fears on
[3771.24 - 3776.36] what's different but they see the
[3773.28 - 3778.76] healing but they project their fears cuz
[3776.36 - 3781.48] they don't want to have to think about
[3778.76 - 3783.76] healing and health and what to eat and
[3781.48 - 3786.16] meaning like they think of okay
[3783.76 - 3788.92] okay everybody thinks about what to eat
[3786.16 - 3791.96] I don't care who they are
[3788.92 - 3794.32] everyone and everyone is worried about
[3791.96 - 3796.04] their food to some degree no matter what
[3794.32 - 3797.80] because you can't just eat 10 loaves of
[3796.04 - 3800.32] bread with butter on it you'll end up
[3797.80 - 3802.44] with pancreatitis with with a pound of
[3800.32 - 3804.12] butter you can't just eat a whole
[3802.44 - 3806.48] chocolate cake every single night
[3804.12 - 3808.28] because that's not going to help
[3806.48 - 3812.04] you can't do a lot of things you got to
[3808.28 - 3814.44] be careful with lupus free celery 333
[3812.04 - 3817.40] over there on YouTube I just read an
[3814.44 - 3820.20] anti-ed medium post from someone who was
[3817.40 - 3822.92] on medical medium for 7 years and gained
[3820.20 - 3825.24] 30 lbs yet she is posting other
[3822.92 - 3827.80] supplements and chocolate and saying to
[3825.24 - 3830.52] be your own health expert and stop with
[3827.80 - 3832.12] the cult first of all you can't even
[3830.52 - 3834.04] tell you can't even trust if that's a
[3832.12 - 3836.48] real story meaning like the story
[3834.04 - 3837.72] they're trying to frame and paint
[3836.48 - 3840.72] there's been an attack on the medical
[3837.72 - 3842.16] medum community by a group of people you
[3840.72 - 3843.76] guys know about the plotters and so
[3842.16 - 3846.20] forth there's been a massive attack on
[3843.76 - 3848.36] the community um a lot of people injured
[3846.20 - 3850.12] in the community we know because a lot
[3848.36 - 3852.16] of people have told us about their harm
[3850.12 - 3853.88] stories how damaged they are and injured
[3852.16 - 3855.00] they are and we're actually working on
[3853.88 - 3859.32] that working with them and doing
[3855.00 - 3861.20] something about that by the way and and
[3859.32 - 3864.08] it's going to be some people in trouble
[3861.20 - 3867.00] point is is that a lot of damage has
[3864.08 - 3870.36] been done due to framing and lies and so
[3867.00 - 3873.04] forth and the attack and a lot of fake

[4171.72 - 4174.56] that you know cuz the industry you know
[4173.12 - 4178.24] how the movie industry and the TV
[4174.56 - 4179.52] industry is can be really dark right

[4276.28 - 4281.20] everything was just kept out of that
[4278.52 - 4283.36] film because in the film industry it's a
[4281.20 - 4285.88] lot of Darkness everything was kept out
[4283.36 - 4288.40] of it and

[4352.88 - 4356.88] know that that was actually a healing
[4354.56 - 4358.52] tool when they when they filmed that it
[4356.88 - 4360.80] just happened to kick and just right and
