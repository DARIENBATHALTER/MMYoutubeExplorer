00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,280
on clubhouse

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,160
we're doing immune system building this

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,160
is a critical

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,840
critical live right here you might want

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,440
to take notes

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,960
because it's that important medical

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,760
medium information was always about

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,359
rebuilding the immune system medical

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,439
medium information

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,119
was the only that knew about all the

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,519
different viruses

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,359
of the epstein-barr sediment virus what

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,599
people were up against with shingles

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,000
what the symptoms are relating to these

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
viruses which was never known as far as

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,680
symptoms

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,680
and how to protect ourselves including

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,600
the flu viruses

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,559
and other bugs like that too so really

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,640
important also mm info

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,559
let everybody know how to protect their

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,079
immune system originally

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,840
before the plague and i talked about

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,760
and right actually during the place and

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
i talked about the new edition

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,800
medical medium new edition right here

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,559
revised and expanded

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,160
i talked about that information about

31
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,960
the plague we're up against now and how

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,240
it works and

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,479
how that instigates the epstein bar

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,479
and causes these epstein bars to come

35
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,360
out other viruses to come out too so

36
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,000
we're talking about rebuilding the

37
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,439
immune system

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,080

their immune system building

63
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,719
i think they're doing their zing i think

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
they're doing their golden seal i think

65
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,360
they're doing

66
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
their lemon balm i think they're doing

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,319
their time t but they're not

68
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,920
not everybody right and just some people

69
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,560
and it's like okay well

70
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,319
when it comes down to immune system

71
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,000
that's how we can protect ourselves but

72
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,920
it's not just about

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
taking things to do that it's about

74
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,360
knowing why it happens you guys like on

75
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,080
tick tock i'm telling you now

76
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
it's important to know how zinc works in

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,599
your system

78
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
how it makes the bugs the pathogens the

79
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,680
viruses

80
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,640
docile that's important and then we lose

81
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,239
all our zinc

82
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,080
people don't have zinc in their bodies

83
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,280
they don't have it there it's a critical

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
trace mineral

85
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
and the reason why they don't have it

86
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
there it's not in your food

87
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,040
it's not in your food some will say

88
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,000
oysters oysters eat some oysters to get

89
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,319
your zinc are you kidding

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,920

91
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,480
you are if anything

92
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
abby said this shock therapy really

93
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,920

one using vimergy's ink a few times

97
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
even when you feel a sore throat coming

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640

that i trust is the vimergi zinc right

104
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,959

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,680
stabilized and that's the difference

191
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,240
between vimergy's

192
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,000
zinc versus somebody else's zinc the

193
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,199
other zincs aren't stable

194
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,199
and that's the problem um but where

195
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
would i get the information you guys

196
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,720
where would it come from right how would

197
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,440
i know

198
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,440
that they're just taking all your blood

199
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,280
and all they need is a tiny drop

200
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,800
right but no one's talked about it in

201
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,319
all of the medical fields no one's

202
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,440
talked about an alternative medicine no

203
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,039
one caught it

204
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,560
how would i know that people go

205
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,919
backwards and go backwards and go

206
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,880
backwards with their healing they don't

207
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,479
even heal

208
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,080
and that if you have lyme disease

209
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,199
they'll take so much blood from you if

210
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,039
you have lupus they'll take so much

211
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,080
blood for it the ms will take so much

212
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,600
blood cancer

213
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,360
and they'll send you backwards and

214
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
remove your immune system is am i a

215
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
genius

216
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,039
is that where it comes from no i'm not a

217
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,720
genius

218
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,639
it comes from the information i told you

219
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
that it all comes from you guys it comes

220
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,759
from above since age four

221
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,720
right and if you can get past

222
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,199
the fact that i hear a voice since age

223
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,039
four

224
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,639
giving us advanced medical information

225
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,919
then you are open to the tools to heal

226
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,240
you are open to it you are free to heal

227
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,280
right you can you can just you can move

228
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
forward and heal

229
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,199
you know you have a friend of mine that

230
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,639
is a doctor you became a new friend of

231
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,840

233
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,120
years and years

finally get a chance and

237
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,280
it took me a while to get past the whole

238
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,440
thing where you get your information

239
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,280
but you've saved so many lives and i've

240
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,000
heard it from so many doctors now all

241
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,080
around and i've heard

242
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
about also a lot of jealous doctors that

243
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,120
that don't like you because they're

244
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,639
tired of hearing your name from all

245
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,280
their patients bringing in the books and

246
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,720
stuff

247
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,960
and he said but it works and and i don't

248
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,120
care where the information comes from

249
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,800
eliza said got very bad allergic

250
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,080
reaction to supplement

251
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,800
yeah you did not recommend buying now

252
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,599
only the ones you are recommending i

253
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
mean

254
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,440
there are zincs out there that have all

255
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,599
the citric acid in there it's terrifying

256
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,000
just burn a hole in your throat right

257
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,440
there's there's tinctures out there and

258
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,919
all the alcohol right

259
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
you know back it still happens now

260
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,440
people like people like

261
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,680
do medical medium and do this other

262
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,840
person's stuff right they're all because

263
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,039
they're paid to say this stuff and the

264
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,400
other person's stuff

265
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,240
has all this alcohol and all the

266
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,080
tinctures their golden seal has alcohol

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,960
in it right

269
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,560
and then you got to be careful with the

270
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,720
in the herbal world because in the

271
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,120
herbal world what will happen

272
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,560
okay which works against your immune

273
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,880
system you guys

274
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,080

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,680
right is they got all these tinctures

277
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,599
and and someone just says let's just

278
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,479
throw 20 different herbs in this

279
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,200
tincture

280
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,480
you're getting that much herb like that

281
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,800
much herb

282
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,720

283
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,640
i mean not even a speck

284
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,640
and then it's an alcohol right it's an

285
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,600
alcohol it's not an immune system

286
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,640
builder

287
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,880
their immune system breakers you know so

288
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,560

348
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,360

a thousand doctors and not

352
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,079
have that information think about how

353
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,079

teaching doctors that piece of

356
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,079
information but think about how valuable

357
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,040
that is

358
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,760

430
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,320
time in a second i just saw somebody ask

431
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,000
about that on tic tac

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,360
infused water going so i got the thyme

434
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,880
infused

435
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,160
tea which is a medical medium tool right

436
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,160
proud to say it is truly

437
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
because of how many people it has helped

438
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,720
and from where the information comes

439
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,720
from

440
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,800
i'm steeping it for 15 minutes so you

441
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,240
know we might not be on that exact 15

442
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,839
minute mark it could be a little after

443
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,680
whatever happens naturally

444
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,160
because we're live right here this is in

445
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,959
a studio recording where

446
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,560
everything's picture perfect right time

447
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,480

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,759
all day long for exposure time is more

515
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,120
powerful

516
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,039
than any other trendy idea

517
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,480
that's starting to come out about

518
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,079
exposure

519
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,760
and i'm not going to try to rip apart

520
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,520
that idea or anything or debunk it right

521
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,240
now or anything like that

522
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,520
but it doesn't work this is what i

523
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,799
prepared everybody for

524
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,280
all along that's the whole point and

525
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,000
it doesn't have to come out now it's

526
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,760
been out

527
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,600
i've been already ahead of the curve

528
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,360
making sure you were prepared

529
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
so you had that health with liz you love

530
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,799
the time t incredible

531
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,320
so um but everybody's in a panic right

532
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,600
now not everybody but a lot of people

533
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,960
are in a panic right now

534
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,480
yeah exactly on tick-tock and

535
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,039
they're in a panic right now what do i

536
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,080
do about exposure about something

537
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,360
and so the time is where

538
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,280
that viral exposure lies

539
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,880
that's where the anti-viral nature

540
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,080
for exposure is it's in the time water

541
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,679
it's in the time t i talked about

542
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,919
how the flues the plaguing flues

543
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,799
knock down everybody's immune system

544
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,200
causing

545
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,679

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,919
over a year ago like well over a year

563
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,240
ago making sure you guys were prepared

564
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,520
for

565
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,960
that flu storm for that

566
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,400
whole plague for that pandemic right off

567
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,520
the running

568
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,960
and i did i did instagram lives

569
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,880
facebook lives in january

570
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,039
going all the way back not this january

571
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,679
the january before this january

572
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,799
that would just pass so but then you

573
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,559
know what happens is

574
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,400
then this kind of silly stuff occurs

575
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,240
right and people are like

576
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,000
all of a sudden they're they're chasing

577
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,440
once again the gay guessing game so

578
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,640
they're chasing the guessing games

579
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,679
because of exposure that's what's

580
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,320
happening right now

581
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,760
so once again guessing games right

582
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,360
that's how it works

583
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,400
meanwhile you don't have to have the

584
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,280
guessing game that's the whole point

585
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,440
you don't have to have it yes uh betty

586
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,280
says and given us a whole pdf

587
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:45,039
with healing tools exactly exactly

588
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,400
and that pdf by the way betty that pdf

589
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,840
went viral it completely

590
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,559
covered the planet viral i can't even

591
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,600
imagine

592
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,080
how many you guys how many people had

593
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,360
that pdf around the planet

594
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,679
and so medical media put the tools out

595
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,000
there

596
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,440
so the guessing games wouldn't have to

597
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
be there but then

598
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
all of a sudden let's get a new silly

599
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,559
trend

600
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,760
let's get a new guessing game out there

601
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,200

602
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,880
exposure

603
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,120
and meanwhile it's like what uh huh okay

604
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,320
all right use something that doesn't

605
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400

610
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,120
therapy talking about vitamin c shock

611
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,400
therapy we're doing the time infused

612
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,240
water we're doing the time

613
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,159
t that's what we have you guys we're

614
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,240

facebook we're live on youtube we're

616

live on clubhouse

617
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,760
let's talk about the benefits so so what

618
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,840
i love about time is

619
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:49,120
time okay time hangs in the bloodstream

620
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,000
it stays in the bloodstream okay because

621
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,840
you can take an herb it doesn't mean

622
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,960
it's going to stay in the bloodstream

623
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,360
it doesn't mean it's going to stay in

624
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,120
there long you have to

625
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,760
have something in the bloodstream

626
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,880
that's working for you that's the key

627
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
okay

628
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,159
and that's the most important place

629
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,720
right there it has to be

630
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,760
the bloodstream right so what time does

631
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,640
is it hangs

632
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,440
it doesn't go away it doesn't go way

633
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,120
easy

634
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,720
so what i like to do is i like to drink

635
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,880
it on and off all day

636
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,640
so that if i didn't drink it the next

637
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,440
day or didn't drink it the day after the

638
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,240
next day

639
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,360
it was still in my system so it stays in

640
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,840
your bloodstream

641
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,640
for a good couple days lucy good to see

642
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,440
you today

643
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,600
on saturday yeah can we do the time t

644
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,520
during the advanced 369 yes you can

645
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,520
you can do the time t good question

646
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,720
lissy definitely you can

647
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,159
right and so what i like about the time

648
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,919
is it has an everlasting like effect

649
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,320
is what it does right it's the gift that

650
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,240
keeps on giving so it's not like a lot

651
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,760
of herbs a lot of herbs you've got like

652
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,440
a half a day in there

653
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,280
that's what you have a lot of herbs you

654
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,440
got one day in there

655
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,520
and that's just naturally how it works

656
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,520
the herbs can still be amazing

657
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,919
still be incredible like goldenseal

658
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,960
goldenseal is a one-dayer

659
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,960
that's a one-dayer right still critical

660
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,640
still critical for the immune system

661
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,480
still really is really important that's

662
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,679
the bemidji golden seal right

663
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,039
um and so um and i'm not sponsored but

664
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,039
it's the stuff i use

665
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,240
all the time so i use gold and seal all

666
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,760
the time if i think i got a little

667
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,799
exposure boom i'm down in a bunch of

668
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,799
goldenseal

669
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,640
that's what i do i think i got a little

670
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,320
exposure boom get down again

671
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,120
so that's a one dayer well

672
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,679
the time which i love about it is it

673
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,480
hangs

674
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,400
it's got hang time it's got shelf life

675
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,280
inside your bloodstream

676
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,120
shelf life inside your body and then if

677
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,440
we can't if we don't keep up on it

678
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,640
it's still protecting us so two days

679
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,720
later

680
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,840
time is still floating around our

681
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,200
bloodstream

682
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,360
that's what i love about it now what

683
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,039
does time do

684
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,159
it basically what time does it's a

685
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,880
disinfectant

686
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,559
to pathogens pathogens hate

687
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,159
disinfectants

688
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,400
and that's what they despise one of the

689
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,640
things they despise the most right

690
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,600
so not just pathogens but pathogen

691
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,039
byproducts

692
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,480
viral byproducts viral star

693
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,480
dust okay because you know

694
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,720
viruses leave a path of all kinds of

695
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,240
debris and all kinds of crap

696
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,480
and all kinds of garbage not just

697
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,679
neurotoxins and dermatoxins

698
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,760
a byproduct of all kinds and so

699
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,600
all that stuff builds up in a lymphatic

700
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,120
system builds up in our liver it builds

701
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,039
up in our bloodstream

702
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
and time is this disinfectant that's

703
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,640
doing some cleaning in our system

704
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,320
that's what's so incredible about it

705
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,559
right and

706
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,320
yeah viral dust you like that one

707
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,400
michelle i mean that's what it is

708
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,360
okay see we hear hero time after time

709
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,440
good song

710
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,200
and so what i really love about it is

711
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,039
you have to just remember hey i'm doing

712
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,440
my time water i'm doing my time infused

713
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,840
tea

714
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,880
water what is it doing for me it's an

715
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,880
antiseptic

716
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:08,799
okay pathogens are allergic viruses

717
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:12,080
are allergic to the oil in time

718
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:15,679
okay so time has this really

719
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,760
um thin thin thin oil

720
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,200
is what time actually has so it's a va

721
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,120
there's fat in everything i told you

722
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,039
guys there's fat in every single herb

723
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,480
this is why i try to keep your fats down

724
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,880
with all your foods

725
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,720
your overt fats down i'm trying to keep

726
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,120
all your overt fats down

727
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,200
because we're we're hurting ourselves

728
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,960
with all that fat we do constantly over

729
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,279
and over and over again right

730
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,240
and that all that fat from overt fat

731
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,840
stops

732
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,279
things from working for you in other

733
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,400
ways and i've talked about that because

734
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,919
your bloodstream

735
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,120
and i'll go into that in a second though

736
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,159
what happens in your bloodstream with

737
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,159
all the fats

738
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:53,360
but time okay time oil

739
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:57,360
which is an omega-3 in time

740
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,640
itself right is an antiseptic too so

741
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,080
that right there it's

742
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,760
it's the one of the only fats

743
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,320
there are that propel viruses

744
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,600
it's in time so you can't just drink

745
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,240
some olive oil i'm going to repel some

746
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,760
viruses no your viruses will get worse

747
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,520
can't just eat some more chicken getting

748
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,960
all that chicken fat thinking that the

749
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,679
fat's going to repel viruses no your

750
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,760
virus is getting

751
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,440
worse can't just eat your eggs i'll just

752
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,559
feed the viruses straight out

753
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,080
you can't just do a whole bunch of

754
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,600
peanut butter well you know what there's

755
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,039
there's some omegas in peanut butter

756
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
there's a magazine walnuts there's a

757
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,760
mega

758
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,919
magazine in pumpkin seeds there's a

759
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,039
magazine you know and

760
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,720
chia seed so i use thyme essential oil

761
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,440
every day topically but i am going to

762
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,159
make the tea

763
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,679
too i mean if you want to use thyme

764
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,000
essential oil topically

765
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,279
right you can but it's it's not going to

766
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,919
stop exposure

767
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,440
so you can't use time for exposure well

768
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,120
the thing is with that is you might be

769
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,520
able to use it on your hand maybe

770
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,400
right and then if you were exposed to

771
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,240
something

772
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,080
in your hand like you grab the shopping

773
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,320
cart that could help a little bit so

774
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,720
that does help a little bit

775
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,440
but internally though it has to be like

776
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,200
the time t

777
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,360
time infused water that's where it

778
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,279
really kicks in inside the body

779
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:14,480
but it's that that it's that micro oil

780
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,320
micro omega oil that's in time but

781
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,159
it's not in anywhere else you eat a

782
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,080
bunch of hemp seeds you eat your peanut

783
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,679
butter you eat your walnuts you eat your

784
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,240
almonds

785
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,880
that fat doesn't repel any viruses or

786
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
bugs

787
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,159
you have your chicken you have your fish

788
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,480
you have your milk eggs cheese butter

789
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,080
that doesn't repel anything now just

790
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,279
just so you know

791
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,480
it's it's special for time it only

792
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,880
exists for time

793
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,159
and then there's an alkaloid in time too

794
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,520
so

795
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,200
time carries alkaloids okay

796
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,880
just like so many other plant foods do

797
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,440
they have a lot of alkaloids

798
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,640
and the alkaloid in time is another type

799
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,960
of antiseptic

800
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,600
so it repels viruses too so that's

801
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,240
another thing as well so the alkaloid

802
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,600
is a chemical compound in time right

803
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,120
it's in the leaf

804
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,120
okay the time oil is in the stem

805
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,120
so that's where the thyme oil is you see

806
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,159
where the stem is right here you guys

807
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,919
see that stem see the little leaves

808
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,000
that's where the alkaloid is that repels

809
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,000
viruses you see that stem

810
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,360
that's where the oil is that repels

811
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,880
viruses okay

812
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,200
i'm holding a piece of time you guys on

813
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,200
clubhouse right now

814
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,760
um so this is where the magic happens

815
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,240
right there

816
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,200
it's the antiviral alkaloid which is a

817
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,799
chemical compound

818
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:38,240
phytochemical compound and it's the

819
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,960
oil that's in the stem right

820
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,760
that micro oil that's in the stem and so

821
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,919
these are where the magic lies

822
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,120
okay and you remember when i told you

823
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,679
guys

824
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,679
remember when i told you guys that if

825
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,880
you eat fat

826
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,600
it stays in your bloodstream okay clogs

827
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,919
up the liver

828
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,120
stays in your bloodstream all right if

829
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,440
you're eating too much fat

830
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,720
it gets your bloodstream all clogged up

831
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,200
but those aren't anti-viral oils

832
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,279
they're not antiviral that's how it

833
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,960
works your avocado

834
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,080
oil in the avocado that fat's not

835
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,360
anti-viral

836
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,159
right and so it's it's about

837
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,520
what foods are the antiviral

838
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:22,559
antibacterial compounds you know so the

839
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,799
oil in time

840
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,360
and it's not an overt that's the whole

841
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,559
point no one would ever believe or

842
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,679
think by just looking at time like this

843
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,960
that there's fat in it

844
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,039
and it's on such a minute level

845
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,720
such of my my new level but that's

846
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,000
what's incredible and healthy fats are

847
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,520
great i mean if you're doing healthy

848
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,360
fats and that's the fats you use that's

849
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,480
that's great if you do your olive oil

850
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,000
you do your avocado you do your

851
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,520
sunflower seeds your hemp seeds your

852
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,279
nuts and seeds your pumpkin seeds

853
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,799
you do any of that those are the better

854
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,960
fats right

855
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,320
and if you're i would stay off a pork if

856
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,799
you're an animal protein person

857
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,720
that fat will make you sick that brings

858
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,880
down your immune system the more fat you

859
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,000
eat your immune system can drop

860
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,559
keep that in mind all right and

861
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,799
when you get sick or you're coming down

862
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,360
with something and you eat a heavy meal

863
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,720
and what constitutes a heavy meal

864
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,559
this is about immune system boosting

865
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,799
this is critical information guys just

866
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,399
take these notes down now if you're

867
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,200
getting sick

868
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,200
or you think you were exposed and you

869
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,360
think that sore throat's coming on

870
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,399
your body's starting to ache you're not

871
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
feeling good

872
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,440
you think you might have caught the

873
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,640
plague think you might have caught the

874
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,760
flu

875
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,440
right the last thing you want to do

876
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,640
is eat a big heavy meal do not eat a big

877
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,720
heavy meal if you did fine fine just

878
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,279
don't eat another big heavy meal

879
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,039
okay but the last thing you want to do

880
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,520
is eat a big heavy meal

881
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,360
that will take your immune system down

882
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,000
all that fat and that big heavy meal

883
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,440
will take your

884
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,720
immune system down and then whatever

885
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,520
you've been exposed to

886
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,840
the plague some virus you're exposed to

887
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,640
the flu

888
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,200
it's gonna get a chance to take off and

889
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,000
really

890
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,320
root that's what it's going to do take

891
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,880
off and really root

892
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,880
you see how it works trisha marie it's

893
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,080
valuable information right

894
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,440
okay and so one of the greatest tools i

895
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
can give you outside of the tools

896
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,080
themselves that i'm about to do the zinc

897
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,039
shock therapy the vitamin c shock

898
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,360
therapy right

899
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,960
we'll go into that next one of the

900
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,640
greatest tools i can give you

901
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,880
is making sure you don't eat that heavy

902
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,000
meal filled with fat

903
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,200
right when you got exposed right so if

904
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,880
you're around somebody

905
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,399
and you're around somebody and you're

906
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,760
like oh my god they just came down with

907
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,039
the plague oh my god i was around

908
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,559

flu oh my god they came down some kind

910
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,360

someone just came down with something oh

912
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,320
my god someone just was dealing with

913
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,320
some kind of medical stuff

914
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,960
and and i'm getting exposed whatever it

915
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,559
is you don't want to go and tank

916
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,919
that's when you don't want to go in tank

917
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,279
and all of a sudden it's like let me go

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,880
tank let me go eat

you don't want to fat yourself to death

932
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,279
at that moment you don't want to choose

933
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,840
that moment to fat yourself to death

934
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,960
because that is how it happens someone

935
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,480
gets exposed

936
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,240

937
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,679

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,279
wrong and

944
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,519

doctor tells you your doctor tells you

1061
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,119

doctor likes right whatever you want to

1063
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,400
do

1064
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,920
um you can ask your doctor about this

1065
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,560
can ask your doctor about it no problem

1066
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,400
too

1067
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,640
okay i'm just showing you what i do for

1068
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,720
myself i do for my family right

1069
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,000
now um now what i do is

1070
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,480
you can do it a couple different ways

1071
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,400
you can put put it right in your mouth

1072
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,520
um that's one way then shock therapy

1073
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,880
because i talk about that it's in the

1074
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,520
book it's in the medical media new

1075
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,520
edition right here

1076
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:13,680
i like in the water too all right

1077
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,000
i like it in water as well um

1078
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,440
so and you can put in some water and

1079
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,800
still let it sit in your mouth that's

1080
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,480
something you can do you can also

1081
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,720
swallow it down if you really want to do

1082
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,200
it that way as well you can go

1083
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,400
either way okay so one way to do it is

1084
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,400
you do the two dropper holes

1085
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:38,640
right put that in your throat

1086
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,640
and two dropper folds this ink

1087
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,359
okay every three hours just like that

1088
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,800
that's in shock therapy okay you can

1089
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,200
hold it in your mouth

1090
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,480
30 seconds up to a minute whatever you

1091
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,680
feel comfortable with

1092
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,000
right and that's what i tell friends and

1093
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,520
family you know you ask your doctor

1094
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,520
you do what your doctor wants to but

1095
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,720
that's what i tell friends and family

1096
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,640
um and you can do that

1097
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,079
every three hours so it's two dropper

1098
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,000
fulls every three

1099
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,599
hours and you can do it for one day you

1100
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,200
can do it to two days

1101
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,200
so two days is another thing you can do

1102
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,000
renata says his in-shock therapy is

1103
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,280
incredible saved me and my husband from

1104
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,880
cove exposure multiple times

1105
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,880
incredible incredible

1106
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,320
so when it comes down to building our

1107
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,760
immune system there's a couple ways you

1108
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,800
guys can look at it

1109
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,000
right right

1110
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,920
you can build it short term you can

1111
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,760
build it long term

1112
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,119
right so i like building the immune

1113
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,760
system short term

1114
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,200
and long term i like them both so i'll

1115
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,079
talk about that a little bit if you're

1116
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,320
sensitive

1117
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,680
you're welcome to try um a milder

1118
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,920
version of the medical medium shock

1119
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,119
therapy so you can do a milder version

1120
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,400
that's just the version now for my

1121
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,880
friends and family cold white spring

1122
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,240
good see right now

1123
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,760
awesome glad you're here today um elune

1124
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,160
hell good to see you

1125
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,760
glad you're here today so let's work on

1126
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,520
let's talk about zing for a little bit

1127
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,480
zinc is something that we don't

1128
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,720
have in our food anymore so as i was

1129
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,160
talking about before is like oysters

1130
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,599
like someone's like you can get zing

1131
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,560
from oysters make sure you eat a lot of

1132
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,520
oysters

1133
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,440
it's like are you kidding me you know i

1134
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,640
mean you suck down all those oysters i

1135
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,359
mean you're just gonna get

1136
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,119
hepatitis possibly okay because

1137
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,320
literally there's so much mercury in

1138
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,560
that oyster

1139
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,839
so much mercury in that oyster that

1140
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,000
you're just going to feed every bug in

1141
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,079
your body rapidly especially inside the

1142
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,960
liver so oysters are like a bad idea for

1143
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,200
the liver

1144
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,640
because healthy lizards and oysters

1145
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,599
you've got the smiley faces on that one

1146
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,320
yeah because

1147
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,720
there's so much mercury in oysters for

1148
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
one

1149
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,640
in dioxins and oysters it's just immune

1150
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,320
system lower

1151
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,000
so it breaks down the immune system and

1152
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,000
people have to understand that that's

1153
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,200
that's a problem all on its own right

1154
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,040
and but mercury feeds

1155
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,520
viruses to begin with so i'm gonna eat a

1156
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,160
bunch of oysters is what i'm gonna do

1157
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,000
eat a bunch of oysters meanwhile you're

1158
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,280
feeding every virus in your body and

1159
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,839
that's that's what goes wrong right

1160
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,800
there

1161
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,280
um and so you got the viruses everybody

1162
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,160
is about

1163
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,599
to say you just got exposure of any kind

1164
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,040
say you're in a new relationship and you

1165
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,280
just picked up one or two varieties of

1166
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,040
epstein-barr by accident

1167
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,800
because everybody's carrying around bugs

1168
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,520
right and you can't carry a new epstein

1169
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,200
bar

1170
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,400
and it's floating in your system the

1171
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,079
last thing you want to do is get a whole

1172
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,520
bunch of oysters in your system too you

1173
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,119
don't want to eat a whole bunch of those

1174
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,839
because basically the mercury is going

1175
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,079
to feed

1176
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,440
the virus and it's going to take off so

1177
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,839
that's something right there to consider

1178
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,520
but

1179
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,960
so it's important to get rid of these

1180
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,000
ideas that are out there another thing

1181
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,240
is pumpkin seeds

1182
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,359
just eat a bunch of pumpkin seeds every

1183
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,040
day

1184
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,160
there's such a minute level of zinc and

1185
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,000
pumpkin seeds

1186
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,359
but the reason why pumpkin seeds are

1187
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,480
heralded

1188
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,040
as being the zinc holy grail

1189
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,720
like pumpkin seeds is the zinc holy

1190
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,480
grail right

1191
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,720
the reason why is because there's

1192
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,000
detectable zinc

1193
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,599
in pumpkin seed detectable

1194
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,599
zinc right detectable doesn't mean

1195
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,680
it's enough zinc to get us by for five

1196
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,000
seconds it doesn't mean it's enough zinc

1197
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,839
to actually restore our zinc reserves it

1198
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,160
doesn't mean it's enough zinc

1199
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,200
to do anything for us pumpkin seeds are

1200
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,839
great for you

1201
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,280
it's the best the one of the best fats

1202
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,400
if you're into fats

1203
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,839
one of the healthiest fats right and

1204
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,440
even with that said you just don't want

1205
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,960
to be downing all this pumpkin seed

1206
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,640
butter and eating all these pumpkin

1207
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,440
seeds because too much fat still too

1208
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,280
much fat because

1209
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,480
that's what's happening out there yeah

1210
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,720
oysters are the

1211
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,280
ocean cleaners so yeah they're really

1212
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,640
toxic for us because of that right there

1213
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,000
so zing toxicity so sue says zing

1214
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,839
toxicity question

1215
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,040
mark um i mean you have to be doing a

1216
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,599
lot of zinc

1217
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,119
a lot of zinc for a zinc toxicity issue

1218
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,000
so keep that in mind

1219
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,400
and so that's important to know but what

1220
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,200
you can get

1221
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,960
with with supplementation is is copper

1222
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,160
toxicity so you got to look out for that

1223
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,359
because people like we got to take

1224
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,880
copper

1225
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,640
because you you know we need copper

1226
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,359
you've got to take copper well copper is

1227
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,839
the immune

1228
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,440
immune system lower as well it lowers

1229
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,640
the immune system

1230
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,640
really takes it down a notch copper is

1231
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,119
so abundant that we're loaded with

1232
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,119
copper

1233
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,119
all of us are saturated with copper

1234
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,720
comes from our new clothes we buy from

1235
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,160
the fungicides all the pesticides and

1236
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,400
herbicides comes from that

1237
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,319
it's dropped out of the sky it's in our

1238
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,920
water comes out of our pipes it comes

1239
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,560
out of you know everywhere comes out of

1240
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,359
wells comes out of town city water right

1241
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,359
so copper we're and then the earth is

1242
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,880
saturated in copper

1243
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:54,079
so organic organic farm

1244
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,960
land is high in copper

1245
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,400
so all the food we grow is high in

1246
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,400
copper but not

1247
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,520
supposed to be high in copper but it's

1248
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,240
high in copper right

1249
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,319
so we're coppered out that's why we have

1250
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,839
the raging eczema psoriasis

1251
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,839
we have all the issues with skin

1252
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,400
problems copper is a big reason for all

1253
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,000
of that

1254
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,440
so okay so that's important to know um

1255
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,800
so and and we'll just go we'll go a

1256
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,920
little bit deeper into this for one

1257
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,599
second here so

1258
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,280
we're all worried about copper when

1259
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,000
copper that's more abundant than

1260
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,359
anything

1261
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,319
but zinc isn't abundant so like i said

1262
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,960
the zinc is detectable in a pumpkin seed

1263
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,119
but still not enough to keep us going

1264
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,040
you can sit there gobbling down pumpkin

1265
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,480
seeds all day long till you're sick to

1266
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,760
your guts

1267
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,200
and you're not gonna get the zinc you

1268
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,480
need to protect your immune system to

1269
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,520
protect yourself so that's something

1270
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,040
really important though because that

1271
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,800
comes up all the time so i could just

1272
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,560
eat some pumpkin seeds i don't need to

1273
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,000
i don't need to worry about zinc ever i

1274
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,400
don't need to take a few drops of zinc i

1275
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,960
mean

1276
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,319
even if you take like you know i told

1277
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,040
the doctor the other day you could just

1278
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,599
do

1279
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,880
three tiny drops one two three four five

1280
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,319
drops

1281
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,839
you can take one two drops and

1282
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,040
you know you can take a dropper full a

1283
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,319
day depending on what's happening and

1284
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,440
talk about protocols in the medical

1285
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,400
medium books but

1286
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,319
zinc keeps your immune system from

1287
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,839
overreacting and under reacting so

1288
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,880
here's what happens let me give you guys

1289
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:18,720
this

1290
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,240
okay so um

1291
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,000
you got a virus right here and this is

1292
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,079
medical medium information about sin

1293
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,760
okay that doctors are actually using out

1294
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,599
there and i saw something out there

1295
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,680
plagiarized information wasn't cited

1296
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,200
back to mm but

1297
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,160
viruses when you get exposed to a flu

1298
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,440
virus

1299
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,400
or exposed to some kind of plague virus

1300
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,440
right which is essentially really a flu

1301
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,839
virus

1302
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,839
when you get exposed to that that

1303
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,440
hybridized flu virus

1304
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,960
that's what the plague is hybridized

1305
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:54,960
blue virus when you get exposed to that

1306
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,920
your immune system can overreact

1307
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,160
your immune system can also under react

1308
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,839
and that's what takes a per that's why

1309
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,079
that person there got real sick real

1310
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,359
fast

1311
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,400
that person there got sick kind of

1312
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:14,800
slow and steady but

1313
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:18,240
stayed sick too long that person

1314
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,920
got sick too fast but

1315
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,680
got better quicker doesn't mean that's a

1316
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,960
good thing it either because they got

1317
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,400
so sick so fast it shocked the system

1318
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,960
that person got sick so slow but stayed

1319
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,839
sick

1320
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,880
longer would shock the system you see so

1321
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,720
that right there

1322
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:41,520
it's one thing or a bug is so bad a flu

1323
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,319
virus is so bad

1324
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,560
that your system gets shocked so bad

1325
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,040
you're in trouble okay

1326
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,440
so that's overreacting so what happens

1327
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,280
is our immune system without zinc

1328
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,520
overreacts under reacts overreacts

1329
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,440
under reacts see how it works you guys

1330
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,720
it's really important info

1331
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,359
overreacts and under reacts zinc

1332
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,760
in our body keeps your immune system

1333
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,119
from

1334
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,920
freaking out but keeps it also

1335
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,760
from not going to sleep because your

1336
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,560
immune system also can stay asleep

1337
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,920
it's just staying asleep you're sick but

1338
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,640
it's a sleep

1339
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,280
it's a sleep and that can happen too

1340
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,200
right

1341
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,800
but you don't want one or the other you

1342
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,440
especially don't want

1343
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,560
your immune system overreacting that's

1344
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,440
what you don't want

1345
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,440
right darlene it's really interesting um

1346
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,560
and so that's what i love about zinc

1347
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,359
so it's that modular it's that modulator

1348
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,000
it's what it is it's like modulating you

1349
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,079
know

1350
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,160
it's like that power box that's

1351
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,040
modulating for a surge

1352
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,160
a power surge and that's what it does so

1353
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,000
that's what zinc does so that's

1354
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,960
important um

1355
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,800
and that's what i love about it so

1356
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,000
anyway let's talk about vitamin c we did

1357
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,839
some zinc shock therapy

1358
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,440
we talked about that look you guys want

1359
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,880
more info on that

1360
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,160
zinc shark therapy in the medical medium

1361
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:08,079
new edition boom it's right there

1362
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:11,359
okay let's talk about vitamin c

1363
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,319
therapy too we'll go into there now so

1364
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,800
microc is the one that i use which is um

1365
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,319
the vimergy microc

1366
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,160
and what's what's tricky about vitamin c

1367
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,280
is if you have a sensitive tummy

1368
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:28,400
right get a sensitive tummy

1369
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,359
a vitamin c is like battery acid to your

1370
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,280
tummy

1371
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,640
that's what it could feel like battery

1372
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,839
acid to your tummy

1373
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:39,920
so ascorbic acid straight ascorbic

1374
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,280
acid and some people they're too

1375
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,880
sensitive for that

1376
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,680
they're sensitive they're either

1377
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,480
inflamed they have no hcl

1378
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,359
they're just sensitive so their lining

1379
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,720
is sensitive

1380
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,480
in their small intestinal tract they're

1381
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,440
duodenum they're stomach lining

1382
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,280
sensitive

1383
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,359
so so when it comes to vitamin c this is

1384
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,079
the only one that i feel confident now

1385
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,119
that because we need vitamin c we need

1386
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,640
vitamin c

1387
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,559
so the only one that i feel really

1388
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,079
confident about okay

1389
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:10,000
and it's it's it's one that's buffered

1390
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,599
enough and that's the whole key so

1391
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,280
that's the one i recommend it's the

1392
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,760
vimorgy you guys know

1393
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:21,680
um so anyway there's the micro seat

1394
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:24,880
right there

1395
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,720
so maria says i almost didn't get fevers

1396
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,359
before medical medium information

1397
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,200
after starting i have had really high

1398
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,319
temperatures

1399
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:38,480
over 40.5 cell celsius

1400
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:39,839
so i mean the thing is with that is it's

1401
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,920
really important to know is like i want

1402
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:44,559
you to be your own detective

1403
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,760
and so were you starting medical medium

1404
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,680
information

1405
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,359
because you were feeling like you were

1406
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,440
getting sick

1407
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,800
or heading to a place of getting sick

1408
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,319
happens to a lot of people

1409
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,400
there's something inside of them that

1410
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,079
just says i'm gonna go

1411
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,319
start doing some medical medium

1412
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,559
information because i need to

1413
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,319
start getting better because i'm

1414
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,440
something in me i'm not feeling better

1415
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,800
i'm not feeling good

1416
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,720
it's one thing's really important to

1417
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,280
know um

1418
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,599
the other thing is is were you exposed

1419
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,400
to a new infection so ask your doctors

1420
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,079
these things

1421
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,000
you know you should talk to your doctors

1422
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,440
about this like ask your doctor

1423
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,359
you know because i've talked to doctors

1424
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,880
about this stuff and it's like

1425
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,280
some people get exposed to new

1426
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,839
infections is it a new relationship did

1427
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,800
they get

1428
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,880
mono and now they have mono and strep

1429
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,640
throat because they have a new infection

1430
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,400
from a new relationship

1431
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,760
did they get do they pick something up

1432
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,839
from a public bathroom

1433
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,520
in a restaurant they were eating food in

1434
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,319
one of the things that i tell people

1435
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,040
to really look out for is chefs cutting

1436
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,599
their fingers

1437
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,079
it happens every day in the restaurants

1438
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,119
more

1439
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,640
people eat chef's blood than anybody

1440
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,119
could ever even know

1441
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,720
it happens every single night a sous

1442
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,839
chef

1443
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,200
someone helping a kitchen hand cuts

1444
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,280
their fingers in the kitchen

1445
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,200
right a lot of people have thin skin on

1446
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,800
their hands they're getting cut and

1447
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,559
scratched while they're working

1448
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,240
moving boxes then they're handling food

1449
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,760
chefs are cutting their fingers they put

1450
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,119
a band-aid on and put a rubber glove but

1451
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,040
there's blood everywhere

1452
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,200
so this is another thing too so one of

1453
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,000
the biggest ways we actually transfer

1454
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,359
viruses

1455
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,200
pathogens around is through eating out

1456
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,800
that's the that's like between

1457
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,480
relationships

1458
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,839
that's the second big one so it's

1459
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,640
relationships the first bit

1460
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,359
first one right there and then boom

1461
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,400
eating out

1462
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:37,599
that's the second one right there and so

1463
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,720
um i mean that's important to know

1464
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:43,760
and and when it comes down to

1465
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,079
when it comes down to okay like

1466
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,359
what i would do me personally if i was

1467
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,000
getting fevers

1468
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,839
i would be like okay good thing i'm

1469
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
doing medical medium information

1470
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,359
because if i wasn't how bad would all

1471
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,040
that stuff be

1472
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,720
because it's the whole point it's about

1473
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,400
making sure you're so proactive and

1474
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,079
taking care of yourself so at least

1475
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,359
you've got that in your hands

1476
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,200
i'm sure you get the support from your

1477
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,599
doctors to do medical medium information

1478
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,720
ask your doctors you know if you can do

1479
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,760
mm info

1480
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,880
um and and learn about it but there's a

1481
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,520
couple things about being your own

1482
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,400
detective

1483
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,280
and what's happening in your foods is mm

1484
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,119
info

1485
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,720
minus the chocolate the caffeine the

1486
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,240
apple cider vinegar nutritional yeast

1487
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,800
the whey protein powder the protein

1488
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,119
powders

1489
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,160
the fish oil is it minus all that that's

1490
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,160
just some things right there it's

1491
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,880
medical medium information

1492
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,559
minus all the fats is medical medium

1493
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,400
information minus the eggs the chilled

1494
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,400
milk cheese dairy butter

1495
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,920
so it's one thing it's one thing we can

1496
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,559
say

1497
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,920
hey medical media information i'm doing

1498
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,880
but are you doing medical medium

1499
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,559
information

1500
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,079
how much medical mean information are

1501
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,200
you doing so these are things to

1502
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,160
consider right there

1503
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,000
like are you doing just celery juice or

1504
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,640
a heavy metal detox smoothie

1505
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,599
are you still eating eggs dairy

1506
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,800
chocolate

1507
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,559
matcha tea kombucha tea bone broth

1508
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,079
apple cider vinegar vinegars what else

1509
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,559
are you doing and then

1510
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,119
are you still doing collagen the protein

1511
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,000
powders

1512
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,960
citric acid natural flavors alcohol all

1513
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,960
these things matter

1514
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,319
right there because if you're doing any

1515
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,319
of that stuff

1516
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:16,079
you means you're only dabbling in

1517
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,680
medical medium information

1518
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,000
so when you're dabbling it should be

1519
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,839
like you know what i started dabbling in

1520
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,680
medical medium information

1521
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,280
i started playing around celery just a

1522
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,680
little um

1523
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,839
and and that's what i'm doing and oh my

1524
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,000
god these fevers are so bad

1525
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,200
because i started dabbling in medical

1526
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,280
medium information

1527
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,119
so just all i just want people to be

1528
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,160
their own detective

1529
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,359
so they know how to heal themselves they

1530
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,960

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,720
essential oils i'm going to be straight

1549
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,640
up

1550
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,160
i don't recommend taking them internally

1551
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,960
i know they get the essential oil crowd

1552
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,319

facebook youtube i don't like the

1557
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,440
ingestion

1558
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,559
of essential oils i think it was a bad

1559
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,200
idea

1560
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,240
i think it was a bad idea from the start

1561
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,160
just letting you know

1562
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,359
okay essential oils right i i do like i

1563
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,440
do support

1564
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,839
i support them when it comes down to on

1565
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,400
the skin i support them on that level

1566
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,599
infusions right infusers i support them

1567
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,319
in that level too

1568
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:04,160
you know vaporizers using them in those

1569
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,720
like i support essential oils i'm fine

1570
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,079
with it

1571
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:11,520
but consuming them internally

1572
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,920
i saw a lot of disasters happen right

1573
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,839
so ingesting the ingesting them it was

1574
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,240
never a medical medium recommendation it

1575
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,680
was

1576
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,359
to any of the people that came to me

1577
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,319
personally for 35 years

1578
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:24,400
for 30 years was never something i would

1579
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:27,119
ever do in fact every time

1580
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,319
someone would get into my office right

1581
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,079
they'd get into my office

1582
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,640
okay i got my appointment with you this

1583
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:35,200
would be like 1995 or

1584
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,079
1999 or whatever years all the years i

1585
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,119
did this i'd have

1586
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,760
people coming into my office and

1587
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,200
i would be like you're not ingesting

1588
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,720
those essential oils right because i

1589
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,319
would hear it all the time like yeah

1590
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,760
i'm told to drink the essential oils

1591
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,359
that's going to help my lyme disease i

1592
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,880
feel like oh my god dear lord

1593
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:54,720
no it's not and sensitive people

1594
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,240
they their nervous system can't handle

1595
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,799
it it can really

1596
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,440
really wig them out without their vagus

1597
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,960
nerve

1598
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,400
totally wigged out their bags their

1599
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,720
stress their vagus nerve out stress

1600
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,760
their

1601
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,079
their their um phrenic nerves out

1602
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,280
and and this is inhaling it too

1603
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,599
essential oils

1604
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,960
inhaling certain essential oils can be

1605
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,640
too strong for people with nervous

1606
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,480
system sensitivities

1607
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,480
with tightness of chest tightness of

1608
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,160
throat you know vagus phrenic nerve

1609
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,440
issues anxiety depression

1610
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,559
so i would always err in caution on

1611
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,319
essential oils

1612
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,680
say if you've got real sensitivities

1613
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,400
where in the sense where you're

1614
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,200
neurologically sensitive don't even

1615
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,160
breathe them in

1616
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,480
real don't breathe in strong amounts of

1617
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,559
it

1618
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,920
light and airy is fine little here and

1619
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,559
there on your wrist and you're just not

1620
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,079
covering

1621
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,599
don't wipe your whole body down with

1622
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,280
essential oil if you've got

1623
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,520
nervous system issues that are really

1624
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,799
sensitive i've always said this and

1625
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:51,200
and and do not ingest them don't be

1626
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,240
drinking essential oil concoctions i'm

1627
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,000
just letting you know

1628
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,839
that was never a recommendation here

1629
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,440
andrea says i got sicker after ingesting

1630
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:01,040

1633
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,000
on people so that's something that's

1634
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,920
important that's worth

1635
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,760
right now that alone that piece of

1636
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,799
information is worth the price of

00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,760
admission here

1638
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:16,000
