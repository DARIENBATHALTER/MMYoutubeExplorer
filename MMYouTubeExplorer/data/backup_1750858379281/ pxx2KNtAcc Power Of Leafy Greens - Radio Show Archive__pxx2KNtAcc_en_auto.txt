[60.40 - 64.44] disaster for the future if that sounds
[62.20 - 66.84] like fear and Chaos you know don't get
[64.44 - 69.84] me wrong it's not it's reality it's
[66.84 - 71.52] truth and truth matters when 10 years
[69.84 - 73.28] down the road and you're you don't know
[71.52 - 74.80] what's going on and you got symptoms and
[73.28 - 76.20] conditions and you're sick and you don't
[74.80 - 77.28] know why you're mineral deficient and
[76.20 - 79.24] all these problems and you're seeing
[77.28 - 81.16] doctor after doctor after doctor and you
[79.24 - 83.36] didn't have all your leafy greens the
[81.16 - 85.48] right ones at the right time in your
[83.36 - 86.84] life all these years think about it have
[85.48 - 89.96] you been eating leafy green since you
[86.84 - 93.08] were a child lots of leafy greens no you
[89.96 - 95.12] haven't this is an important show so
[93.08 - 97.92] hang on there fasten your seat bels get
[95.12 - 100.16] ready for this one because um this means
[97.92 - 102.80] a lot I I I feel like it means a lot
[100.16 - 105.12] because what happens is I see it over
[102.80 - 107.48] and over again you're not getting enough
[105.12 - 109.84] leafy greens you're not getting enough
[107.48 - 112.80] celery juice you're not getting any
[109.84 - 114.64] celery juice how about that I mean do
[112.80 - 117.36] does everybody have years of celery
[114.64 - 119.44] juice behind them in their in their
[117.36 - 121.52] whole being of their whole nature of who
[119.44 - 123.36] they are and their existence their
[121.52 - 126.04] physical nature all these years no they
[123.36 - 128.08] don't they don't have that some people
[126.04 - 130.56] think juicing is just it's just not a
[128.08 - 132.60] good thing that you don't have to juice
[130.56 - 135.48] that back a long time ago no one had
[132.60 - 137.68] juicers so why should we use them now
[135.48 - 140.28] back in the caveman time nobody was
[137.68 - 142.08] juicing so why do we need them now
[140.28 - 144.08] because we're in a different world right
[142.08 - 146.04] now toxins pollutants liver
[144.08 - 148.04] troublemakers poisons that saturate the
[146.04 - 150.12] liver all kinds of different viruses
[148.04 - 152.96] bacteria everything we're up against now
[150.12 - 156.00] we need every Edge we can get and guess
[152.96 - 159.00] what everybody's digestive tract is
[156.00 - 162.60] basically annihilated by these things
[159.00 - 165.12] okay B bad bacteria by the millions and
[162.60 - 167.12] billions inside their intestinal tract
[165.12 - 169.76] and sometimes really bad versions of
[167.12 - 172.12] bacteria bad strep aactas causing sibo
[169.76 - 174.84] ecoli different groups of ecoli
[172.12 - 178.48] different varieties of SEI all kinds of
[174.84 - 180.60] Staff all kinds of fungus sitting inside
[178.48 - 184.04] our intestinal tract
[180.60 - 186.36] thriving and taking up space making it
[184.04 - 189.00] harder to absorb what we need to absorb
[186.36 - 192.32] our nutrients juicing is one of those
[189.00 - 194.40] lifesaving elements life-saving elements
[192.32 - 196.44] I juice every morning and I take my
[194.40 - 198.80] Omega Juicer that's the best juicer
[196.44 - 200.68] there is there hands down the best
[198.80 - 202.24] juicer there is out there there's no
[200.68 - 203.76] question about it I know all the juicers
[202.24 - 205.40] the masticating ones all the different
[203.76 - 207.48] ones the ones with the gears all that I
[205.40 - 209.56] know all the juicers and a mega juicer
[207.48 - 211.92] is incredible it's the one I use I run
[209.56 - 214.12] my celery through there every single
[211.92 - 215.84] morning I make sure there's leafy greens
[214.12 - 219.04] in my diet you know people say well what
[215.84 - 220.84] do you eat Anthony what do you eat
[219.04 - 223.00] what's your whole thing I'll tell you
[220.84 - 225.88] what I do eat I'll tell you something
[223.00 - 228.32] that's in my diet and it's no secret
[225.88 - 230.88] okay it's leafy greens it's drinking
[228.32 - 233.08] celery juice absolutely but here's the
[230.88 - 235.36] key no matter what you do in your diet
[233.08 - 236.92] whatever you believe in I'm going to
[235.36 - 240.00] tell you right now also I want to back
[236.92 - 243.16] up a little bit we also need the potency
[240.00 - 245.08] and the quantity of the juice that's
[243.16 - 247.92] critical we can't get that just from
[245.08 - 250.16] eating so we do need to eat our leafy
[247.92 - 252.76] greens because we get we get lots of
[250.16 - 255.84] minerals lots of nutrients from that too
[252.76 - 258.00] but we also still have to juice we have
[255.84 - 260.48] to juice our celery we have to juice
[258.00 - 262.60] other things too not just celery and so
[260.48 - 264.64] we do have to keep this in mind you know
[262.60 - 266.24] I like the juice just straight celery
[264.64 - 268.24] and then I like to eat my leafy greens
[266.24 - 271.64] and I'm going to talk about it all too
[268.24 - 274.32] and we're up against so much so many
[271.64 - 276.52] pollutant so many toxins so much stress
[274.32 - 282.52] so much adrenaline when you get stressed
[276.52 - 285.80] out okay your adrenals Purge and flood
[282.52 - 288.68] they Purge and flood that's what happens
[285.80 - 291.12] that adrenaline is toxic abrasive it's
[288.68 - 293.60] poisonous it's like a battery acid it's
[291.12 - 295.52] corrosive it gets in the intestinal
[293.60 - 298.32] lining that that adrenaline gets into
[295.52 - 301.40] the intestinal lining and it burns the
[298.32 - 304.28] lining scor pures it making it a
[301.40 - 306.92] campground for bad bacteria it kills
[304.28 - 310.20] good bacteria our own adrenaline from
[306.92 - 313.76] when we're under stress destroys our
[310.20 - 316.84] good bacteria in our guts our good
[313.76 - 318.92] microorganisms in our guts and as all
[316.84 - 321.72] our good microorganisms and our good
[318.92 - 323.60] bacteria start to disappear over time
[321.72 - 326.28] from all that adrenaline scorching it
[323.60 - 329.08] and all the pollutants and poisons we
[326.28 - 331.96] end up eating all these foods that feed
[329.08 - 333.88] bad bacteria so we're still eating some
[331.96 - 336.52] eggs cuz we think eggs are healthy we
[333.88 - 337.84] think eggs are in a healthy diet now we
[336.52 - 340.20] we think that they're healthy right
[337.84 - 342.92] meanwhile they're not they feed viruses
[340.20 - 345.52] bacteria pathogens microorganisms and
[342.92 - 348.48] when they when all your good bacteria is
[345.52 - 350.24] disappearing from stress okay and
[348.48 - 352.80] adrenaline scorching the Linings of the
[350.24 - 354.80] intestinal tract and colon and all the
[352.80 - 357.12] way up to dadum and everywhere when that
[354.80 - 358.60] happens we start eating we're eating bad
[357.12 - 360.28] food too we think we're getting a
[358.60 - 362.56] moderation diet good moderation diet
[360.28 - 364.48] we're eating a good healthy raw cheese
[362.56 - 366.16] maybe we're eating some eggs we think
[364.48 - 368.40] we're doing good for ourselves a little
[366.16 - 372.12] grass-fed butter these things feed
[368.40 - 374.68] bacteria they feed viruses but this may
[372.12 - 376.44] not hit us all at once it takes a few
[374.68 - 378.40] years for this to kind of happen and
[376.44 - 380.40] roll in and kind of Roll Along and then
[378.40 - 382.72] we start getting our first symptoms we
[380.40 - 384.64] start getting our first issues we start
[382.72 - 386.36] getting the bloating you know gas
[384.64 - 388.72] gastritis we start getting different
[386.36 - 390.88] things happening cramps and all kinds of
[388.72 - 393.20] stuff and bad breath and all these
[390.88 - 395.72] different things and our proteins rot in
[393.20 - 397.44] our gut and the fats that we're eating
[395.72 - 399.88] because we're all on high fat diets turn
[397.44 - 402.16] ran it and Cake the Linings we got the
[399.88 - 404.16] bad bacteria proliferating and thriving
[402.16 - 405.68] off of all this the good bacteria is
[404.16 - 408.00] diminishing and diminishing and
[405.68 - 410.64] probiotics doesn't cut it a probiotic
[408.00 - 411.96] won't do it won't take care of it and
[410.64 - 415.44] that's why if we're not doing that
[411.96 - 416.80] celery juice we're not doing that herb
[415.44 - 418.20] and if we're not doing that powerful
[416.80 - 419.84] herb the celery juice and we're not
[418.20 - 421.80] getting our leafy greens in when we need
[419.84 - 423.04] to like a spinach soup which I'm going
[421.80 - 425.80] to talk about in a little while and
[423.04 - 428.16] other things we're not replenishing
[425.80 - 430.56] we're not killing off the bad bacteria
[428.16 - 432.84] as well see everybody thinks probiotic
[430.56 - 434.92] Prebiotic probiotic they're thinking all
[432.84 - 437.12] that kind of thing right but probiotic
[434.92 - 438.68] doesn't kill bad bacteria if you're
[437.12 - 439.92] loaded with bad bacteria that's already
[438.68 - 441.84] been thriving you could take all the
[439.92 - 446.68] probiotics you want that doesn't stop
[441.84 - 449.56] bad bacteria a probiotic isn't a killer
[446.68 - 453.28] of streptococus it's not a killer of
[449.56 - 456.08] coli is the very things that create sibo
[453.28 - 458.64] um sinusitis the very all mucus and
[456.08 - 459.76] discharge loose you know loose bowels
[458.64 - 462.84] when you're not supposed to have loose
[459.76 - 466.80] bowels mucus in the stool gas cramps
[462.84 - 468.80] bloating ulcers I'm just naming a few
[466.80 - 470.32] diverticulosis diverticulitis I'm just
[468.80 - 473.60] naming a few things
[470.32 - 476.52] appendicitis you know eoli and strep and
[473.60 - 479.00] strep in our system creates all this
[476.52 - 482.16] rosacea it's another one too all that
[479.00 - 484.60] can just from all this down in there and
[482.16 - 487.40] you think a probiotic is the fixer of
[484.60 - 489.32] that you know when I see a commercial on
[487.40 - 491.24] television or something when I'm I was
[489.32 - 492.36] at a friend's office and I was waiting
[491.24 - 495.00] because I was I was going to go out to
[492.36 - 496.20] lunch with them and you know I'm waiting
[495.00 - 498.68] and and I'm in their office and there's
[496.20 - 499.96] a TV on in the office and it's sitting
[498.68 - 502.40] there and I see a commercial of a
[499.96 - 503.96] probiotic like it's this big answer and
[502.40 - 505.76] then it's funny I saw a commercial after
[503.96 - 508.52] of fish oil fish oil the very thing that
[505.76 - 510.92] actually feeds feeds all viruses is fish
[508.52 - 512.80] oil cuz the Mercury to trace the trace
[510.92 - 515.32] essence of mercury left in every single
[512.80 - 517.40] fish oil capsule there ever was and it
[515.32 - 519.44] feed feeds all that bacteria and all
[517.40 - 521.52] that that viral stuff it's amazing the
[519.44 - 525.00] world we live in where the information
[521.52 - 526.56] is so still backwards not helpful I I
[525.00 - 528.28] almost think sometimes it's just meant
[526.56 - 530.80] to be that way just to keep people down
[528.28 - 532.52] and keep women down keep women kind down
[530.80 - 534.40] you know I just really believe so I
[532.52 - 536.76] believe that the systems actually set up
[534.40 - 538.08] to hurt people but the professionals
[536.76 - 539.32] don't really know that I mean they
[538.08 - 541.40] they're they're just they're all they're
[539.32 - 544.44] trying to help people I get that but the
[541.40 - 547.52] bottom line is is that probiotic you're
[544.44 - 549.40] taking cannot kill off the bad bacteria
[547.52 - 551.76] that's already been growing over time
[549.40 - 553.68] for a long time and you need to do
[551.76 - 556.60] something bigger and better than that
[553.68 - 558.92] and leafy greens come into play if
[556.60 - 561.68] they're not enough leafy greens in your
[558.92 - 564.76] diet I promise you we're going to have
[561.68 - 566.68] problems later I I look I'd rather be
[564.76 - 569.36] straight out I've always been straight
[566.68 - 571.52] out with you guys always have I love
[569.36 - 573.52] hearing sometimes out there and YouTube
[571.52 - 575.04] land and other places and all that and
[573.52 - 576.28] lectures and stuff when people say that
[575.04 - 577.48] they're straight out with them and then
[576.28 - 579.96] you're listening to the information
[577.48 - 582.48] you're like okay sure sure meanwhile
[579.96 - 584.96] it's just nothing but propaganda to the
[582.48 - 587.40] usual stuff to the usual songs everybody
[584.96 - 588.76] singing listen I'm being straight out
[587.40 - 590.92] that's why I've always delivered the
[588.76 - 593.28] information to the core the reality of
[590.92 - 595.52] it if I wasn't I'd be all about
[593.28 - 597.76] probiotics 247 and trying to sell you
[595.52 - 600.08] one probably too hey here's my probiotic
[597.76 - 603.28] you guys here's my my new probiotic from
[600.08 - 605.40] Anthony William look instead what am I
[603.28 - 607.20] doing you got to buy leafy greens and
[605.40 - 610.16] Anthony William gets no pennies off of
[607.20 - 611.92] that not one cent not $1 okay you know
[610.16 - 613.96] what I mean I want you juicing celery
[611.92 - 616.56] juice Anthony William gets nothing off
[613.96 - 617.76] of that the point is is I want you guys
[616.56 - 620.32] to have it straight and know what's
[617.76 - 624.32] going on so let's go let's go into leafy
[620.32 - 626.96] greens have a living microorganisms on
[624.32 - 628.44] them think about that how can that be
[626.96 - 631.32] possible you go to your go to your
[628.44 - 633.72] Farmers Market Market in the summertime
[631.32 - 635.56] in the fall in the spring you get any
[633.72 - 639.76] leafy greens whatsoever or any leafy
[635.56 - 642.24] green herbs cilantro parsley you get any
[639.76 - 645.08] of these herbs there's microorganisms
[642.24 - 646.56] riddled on there you don't want to wash
[645.08 - 648.32] them thoroughly you just want to rinse
[646.56 - 651.12] them off and get any dirt off or
[648.32 - 653.24] anything and that's fine kale out of the
[651.12 - 655.04] garden there's microorganisms on there
[653.24 - 657.16] they're called elevated biotics
[655.04 - 660.36] undiscovered still by research and
[657.16 - 663.48] science I brought elevated bi biotics I
[660.36 - 665.48] brought that to the world through spirit
[663.48 - 667.80] and spirit's information I put it in
[665.48 - 669.16] book one medical medium book one okay
[667.80 - 671.20] that's the one with the chest x-ray on
[669.16 - 672.32] the cover so if you go to Amazon or you
[671.20 - 675.16] go and look for it you'll see the
[672.32 - 677.28] medical medium book one and and that has
[675.16 - 679.12] a chest x-ray on it's like a blue cover
[677.28 - 680.44] you'll see that right there secrets
[679.12 - 682.84] behind chronic illness and how to
[680.44 - 688.16] finally heal so here's the deal is
[682.84 - 690.40] elevated biotics is only on these fresh
[688.16 - 692.24] fruits and leav leafy greens you can get
[690.40 - 694.96] from farmers markets pick off a tree
[692.24 - 697.28] pick out of your garden or growing
[694.96 - 699.48] Sprouts if you grow Sprouts in your
[697.28 - 701.08] kitchen you grow some different Sprouts

[707.20 - 711.76] sprouts and when you're doing that the
[709.36 - 714.16] microorganisms they will just appear on
[711.76 - 716.72] these leaves naturally in the wild even
[714.16 - 719.80] on your kitchen counter on a sprout they
[716.72 - 722.20] will they will prosper on there these

[732.24 - 737.88] microorganisms that come from these
[734.68 - 739.56] leafy greens called elevated biotics
[737.88 - 743.24] that end up in your Elum of your
[739.56 - 746.44] intestinal tract creating abundance of
[743.24 - 749.04] B12 so you can heal and lose methylation
[746.44 - 750.88] issues and actually heal and Rise Above
[749.04 - 753.64] methylation problems which are liver
[750.88 - 755.12] issues um vitamins can being converted
[753.64 - 758.48] issues all these different issues that
[755.12 - 760.60] happen in fact the MTHFR gene mutation
[758.48 - 762.48] you won't even get that to ring up at a
[760.60 - 764.16] doctor's office through their testing
[762.48 - 766.04] that's basically just an elevation of
[764.16 - 768.08] inflammation test anyway but it won't
[766.04 - 770.12] even ring up if you're getting enough of
[768.08 - 772.64] these elevated biotics through leafy
[770.12 - 774.76] greens into your body that end up in
[772.64 - 776.84] your elium producing B12 and gets you
[774.76 - 779.60] out of trouble this is a lot of
[776.84 - 781.72] information it's a lot of information
[779.60 - 785.24] but it's here for you so that you can
[781.72 - 787.12] heal and move forward so here's the deal
[785.24 - 789.88] we're growing all this bad bacteria in
[787.12 - 792.36] our guts bad microorganisms in our guts
[789.88 - 794.20] we're growing it all it's prospering we
[792.36 - 796.08] got the strep we got the eoli we got all
[794.20 - 798.52] the different varieties of bad bacteria
[796.08 - 800.84] so many so it's not even cataloged or
[798.52 - 803.60] calculated by any science or or research
[800.84 - 805.44] or any kind of any kind of institution
[803.60 - 807.32] none of them have their fingers on all
[805.44 - 810.44] the different bad bacteria that's inside
[807.32 - 814.24] of us but it grows it prospers and it
[810.44 - 817.12] and it develops and as it develops we
[814.24 - 819.96] need something to knock it out something
[817.12 - 823.04] to sweep it out something to eliminate
[819.96 - 825.08] it out leafy greens not only have like
[823.04 - 826.84] your own that you grow in your garden or
[825.08 - 828.96] you grow at the or you get at the Farm's
[826.84 - 831.52] Market not only do they have these
[828.96 - 834.68] microorganisms called elevated biotics
[831.52 - 836.92] to it to actually repopulate your
[834.68 - 839.52] intestinal tract unlike any probiotic
[836.92 - 842.24] can ever or any kind of soil born
[839.52 - 844.64] microorganism can ever not only are
[842.24 - 845.80] these elevated bi biotics that powerful
[844.64 - 848.24] and can
[845.80 - 852.60] repopulate but the leafy
[848.24 - 854.92] green can sweep it sweeps the walls of
[852.60 - 857.96] the intestinal tract lining gently
[854.92 - 859.88] caressing the walls a lot of people
[857.96 - 861.92] think greens are hard and difficult to
[859.88 - 864.56] digest but they're easy to digest
[861.92 - 866.44] they're super easy they're very leafy
[864.56 - 869.60] greens are actually predigested
[866.44 - 871.72] practically they're easy to digest
[869.60 - 875.08] that's not the problem it's just that
[871.72 - 877.04] the fiber content touches gently
[875.08 - 879.52] massages and touches the intestinal
[877.04 - 881.72] track so it touches the dadum and small
[879.52 - 884.88] intestinal tract and colon and people
[881.72 - 887.64] who are inflamed automatically from
[884.88 - 889.64] colonies of eoli and colonies of strepto
[887.64 - 892.08] coctus because they have all these
[889.64 - 894.12] colonies of bad bacteria they're
[892.08 - 895.88] elevated with inflammation they also
[894.12 - 898.24] have the shingles virus they also have
[895.88 - 900.64] the epscene bar clinging to the walls of
[898.24 - 902.80] their int inal tracts and Linings and
[900.64 - 905.16] when you have all that and bad fungus
[902.80 - 908.32] not candida that's a good fungus bad
[905.16 - 910.16] fungus when they have bad fungus all
[908.32 - 912.88] clinging to the walls of the intestinal
[910.16 - 915.64] tract the nerves on the intestinal tract
[912.88 - 917.72] Linings get hyp sensitive so that if
[915.64 - 919.80] you're not eating something really soft
[917.72 - 921.72] like a piece of gooey bread that sits in
[919.80 - 923.36] the middle of your digestive tract or
[921.72 - 925.16] you're not eating some eggs that turns
[923.36 - 928.08] into straight goo in the middle of your
[925.16 - 930.48] digestive tract or having something like
[928.08 - 932.52] a piece of ham that just sits there in
[930.48 - 934.56] the middle of your intestinal tract if
[932.52 - 937.84] you're not eating like simple things
[934.56 - 940.00] like that or something soft and smooth
[937.84 - 942.48] you know soft and smooth something that
[940.00 - 944.76] feels like it's not abrasive and it
[942.48 - 947.04] becomes gooey inside of you or something
[944.76 - 949.04] like chicken just plain chicken which
[947.04 - 951.48] doesn't rub on the sides of the
[949.04 - 954.04] intestinal tract Linings and colon it
[951.48 - 956.04] collects there over time the chicken fat
[954.04 - 957.12] gets rancid and it collects on there and
[956.04 - 959.32] I'm not saying that because I'm
[957.12 - 961.84] anti-animal products or Pro Pro vegan or
[959.32 - 964.16] Pro an animal or Pro whatever that's not
[961.84 - 966.44] what it is I'm just saying it like it is
[964.16 - 968.84] what would when these things like eggs
[966.44 - 971.72] and all this gets gooey you don't feel
[968.84 - 974.04] it you don't feel it move through you
[971.72 - 976.64] don't feel it move through and because
[974.04 - 978.96] you don't feel it move through what
[976.64 - 980.68] happens is you think you're digesting it
[978.96 - 982.56] and you think you're digesting it fine
[980.68 - 984.28] you see how it works you eat some
[982.56 - 986.40] lettuce and you're just like I can't
[984.28 - 988.28] digest lettuce it's cuz you're feeling
[986.40 - 990.08] it you're already inflamed now this
[988.28 - 991.44] isn't everybody but there's a lot of
[990.08 - 992.96] people that have this elevated
[991.44 - 995.40] inflammation in their intestinal tracts
[992.96 - 997.44] and Linings and all that but see the
[995.40 - 999.80] leafy greens go in and they clean up
[997.44 - 1001.72] those rancid fats and proteins that are
[999.80 - 1003.00] rotting and also feeding bacteria in the
[1001.72 - 1004.84] intestinal walls and I'm going to go
[1003.00 - 1006.12] into that a little deeper in a minute so
[1004.84 - 1007.72] what I'm trying to tell you is the
[1006.12 - 1010.52] sensitive nerves in your intestinal
[1007.72 - 1012.44] tract and colon those sensitive nerves
[1010.52 - 1014.20] are because we're inflamed by viruses
[1012.44 - 1016.44] like the shingles sitting in there
[1014.20 - 1018.80] causing mild colitis and the Celiac
[1016.44 - 1020.52] which is caused by bacteria and viruses
[1018.80 - 1022.24] and all these different conditions of
[1020.52 - 1025.16] the intestinal tract the bowels getting
[1022.24 - 1028.24] inflamed pockets in the bowels pockets
[1025.16 - 1030.24] in the colon that expand so expansions
[1028.24 - 1032.32] in the small intestinal tract where it's
[1030.24 - 1034.76] going normal and then boo it Puffs out
[1032.32 - 1036.80] like it's herniated you know we have all
[1034.76 - 1038.60] that in all of our guts and then
[1036.80 - 1040.92] shrinking in intestinal tract where
[1038.60 - 1042.60] there's narrowing people have narrowing
[1040.92 - 1045.40] so when something's kind of squeezing
[1042.60 - 1048.16] through if it's not gooey and soft and
[1045.40 - 1050.08] squeezing through like eggs being gooey
[1048.16 - 1052.16] after you chew it and turns into just a
[1050.08 - 1054.36] mucus ball as you swallow it and you
[1052.16 - 1056.32] know goes down you know if that's going
[1054.36 - 1058.08] through those little narrowings then you
[1056.32 - 1059.40] don't really feel it so bad even though
[1058.08 - 1061.76] it's still feeding the problem and
[1059.40 - 1065.28] feeding the very bacteria that creates
[1061.76 - 1066.56] intestinal tract wall narrowings so all
[1065.28 - 1067.84] of that but when you start eating a
[1066.56 - 1070.36] little leafy green and you're one of
[1067.84 - 1072.00] these sensitive Critters and you start
[1070.36 - 1074.56] eating some leafy green say oh I don't
[1072.00 - 1076.28] not digesting good because your nerves
[1074.56 - 1079.04] are feeling it you know you're feeling
[1076.28 - 1081.20] it because you feel something it's
[1079.04 - 1083.24] touching the walls of everything what
[1081.20 - 1085.12] it's doing it's sweeping it's cleaning
[1083.24 - 1087.40] it's doing the cleanup it's touching
[1085.12 - 1089.04] rancid fats rotting proteins that have
[1087.40 - 1091.56] been there for years that are feeding
[1089.04 - 1095.16] all the bad bacteria it's touching all
[1091.56 - 1097.08] this stuff see so it's cleaning up the
[1095.16 - 1099.80] system that's a whole another thing the
[1097.08 - 1102.04] leafy greens do but what else do they do
[1099.80 - 1105.84] they leave trace minerals behind that
[1102.04 - 1109.76] feed good bacteria they're prebiotics
[1105.84 - 1113.28] celery juice in herb is a pre biotic it
[1109.76 - 1115.32] feeds all of the good bacteria that's
[1113.28 - 1117.36] what it does the good thing about celery
[1115.32 - 1118.96] juice I talk about my celery juice book
[1117.36 - 1120.24] medical medium celery juice you got to
[1118.96 - 1122.68] pick up that book you won't be
[1120.24 - 1124.40] disappointed I promise what what's in
[1122.68 - 1126.48] there and I can't explain it all here
[1124.40 - 1129.20] it's impossible it's too big of a book
[1126.48 - 1132.04] but what's in there is that celery
[1129.20 - 1135.40] juices sodium cluster salts they hit the
[1132.04 - 1137.80] bad bacteria they hit it the sodium
[1135.40 - 1141.52] cluster salt hits the bad bacteria sucks
[1137.80 - 1144.80] the life out of it pulls it apart cleans
[1141.52 - 1147.88] out that bad bacteria the poison inside
[1144.80 - 1151.00] of it the carcass of the bacteria ends
[1147.88 - 1155.04] up being now fuel for good bacteria your
[1151.00 - 1157.16] good bacteria devours the bad bacteria
[1155.04 - 1159.72] because the sodium cluster salted celery
[1157.16 - 1162.88] juice allowed that to happen it actually
[1159.72 - 1164.68] allowed that to happen is what it did so
[1162.88 - 1167.36] then when that good bacteria is feeding
[1164.68 - 1169.24] off of the Dead bad bacteria it's
[1167.36 - 1170.76] getting refueled
[1169.24 - 1172.72] and then that's how we're we're
[1170.76 - 1174.00] prospering even more and more there's so
[1172.72 - 1176.04] many good things about why you want to
[1174.00 - 1178.68] do the celery juices the herb the leafy
[1176.04 - 1181.28] greens all of it celery juice is not a
[1178.68 - 1183.60] leafy green it's got leafy greens on
[1181.28 - 1185.32] celery okay so the stocks you buy the
[1183.60 - 1188.00] whole bit there's leafy greens on there
[1185.32 - 1191.12] so it is partly a leafy green okay but
[1188.00 - 1194.04] it is an herb but I like the leafy green
[1191.12 - 1196.72] herbs the cilantro The Parsley the
[1194.04 - 1198.84] celery I like these in your life These
[1196.72 - 1201.64] Are Powerful in the leaf leafy green
[1198.84 - 1203.40] herb family that I want you to be on and
[1201.64 - 1206.36] celery juice and leafy greens go hand
[1203.40 - 1208.40] inand together to recover illness to
[1206.36 - 1210.12] stay healthy so we have to remember that
[1208.40 - 1213.28] you can't just if you want to just do
[1210.12 - 1214.52] leafy greens it's great bringing leafy
[1213.28 - 1216.12] greens in your diet now want to talk
[1214.52 - 1217.56] about quantities and all that as we go
[1216.12 - 1219.36] along so I hope you guys all hang in
[1217.56 - 1221.88] there for this because we got so much to
[1219.36 - 1224.44] talk about but you have to have the
[1221.88 - 1228.76] celery juice too these are some of the
[1224.44 - 1232.72] tickets I can't tell you how many people
[1228.76 - 1237.16] that are plant-based fail in their
[1232.72 - 1239.28] plant-based diet fail in their
[1237.16 - 1241.76] recoveries because they don't have any
[1239.28 - 1245.56] celery juice in there or not enough or
[1241.76 - 1248.68] they only tried it once or no no leafy
[1245.56 - 1251.12] greens in there too it happens all the
[1248.68 - 1254.40] time all the people that leave the
[1251.12 - 1256.16] plant-based movement all of them that's
[1254.40 - 1257.76] that ended up going to a doctor a
[1256.16 - 1259.16] functional medicine doctor that believed
[1257.76 - 1260.76] in Pro protein protein protein and
[1259.16 - 1262.32] they're not getting enough protein and
[1260.76 - 1264.64] it was the it was the vegan diet that
[1262.32 - 1266.76] hurt them you know they hear that and
[1264.64 - 1268.08] they just they wa back and forth or they
[1266.76 - 1270.04] just they start heading to animal
[1268.08 - 1272.16] protein Kingdom again and they start
[1270.04 - 1274.52] heading there they're always they're
[1272.16 - 1276.88] always at that point where they they
[1274.52 - 1279.12] lose out because they never did enough
[1276.88 - 1280.76] leafy greens they never knew about the
[1279.12 - 1283.68] 28 day cleanse in book one medical
[1280.76 - 1287.04] medium book one they never knew about uh
[1283.68 - 1288.48] the 369 in Liver Rescue and that's the
[1287.04 - 1289.92] thing and I'm even talking about the
[1288.48 - 1292.32] plant-based movement where it was all
[1289.92 - 1294.28] high carb and low fat that plant-based
[1292.32 - 1297.40] movement there's a plant-based movement
[1294.28 - 1299.44] where it was lowfat um high carb they
[1297.40 - 1301.04] never did enough leafy greens they did a
[1299.44 - 1303.08] handful of romae lettuce that was the
[1301.04 - 1305.88] big thing it's some Ro Roma lettuce once
[1303.08 - 1307.64] in a while they they eat a lot of fruit
[1305.88 - 1309.60] a lot of starches but they didn't do
[1307.64 - 1311.64] celery juice and they didn't do leafy
[1309.60 - 1313.00] greens and that's how it works and I
[1311.64 - 1315.56] can't tell you how many people in the
[1313.00 - 1318.24] Paleo movement the non- plant-based
[1315.56 - 1319.80] movement where it's paleo or keto animal
[1318.24 - 1321.40] protein or high animal protein or some
[1319.80 - 1323.56] kind of Mediterranean or animal protein
[1321.40 - 1324.92] whatever it is where they get sick they
[1323.56 - 1326.96] get sick but it's never blamed on their
[1324.92 - 1328.96] diet it's never blamed on their diet
[1326.96 - 1331.00] ever I mean it's always blamed on the
[1328.96 - 1333.44] plant-based person all you do is have to
[1331.00 - 1334.32] cough once and that's it it's your diet
[1333.44 - 1337.08] that's what happens that's what
[1334.32 - 1339.52] everybody says you can't escape that you
[1337.08 - 1343.20] have to walk on water as a plant-based
[1339.52 - 1346.20] person you can't H you can't even have
[1343.20 - 1348.68] flatulence as a plant-based person you
[1346.20 - 1351.36] can't have bad breath as a plant-based
[1348.68 - 1353.80] person cuz it's your diet causing it you
[1351.36 - 1355.40] can't have anything wrong but when your
[1353.80 - 1358.04] animal protein is some kind no matter
[1355.40 - 1360.08] what it is it's never blamed on diet no
[1358.04 - 1361.36] way it's just hey look that you're
[1360.08 - 1363.04] getting enough protein that's all that
[1361.36 - 1364.08] matters okay let's go look at some there
[1363.04 - 1365.60] something else that is it's probably
[1364.08 - 1367.20] your genetics or your body's attacking
[1365.60 - 1368.64] itself or something El or it's your
[1367.20 - 1370.48] metabolism or something that's what be
[1368.64 - 1372.24] thrown at that person or you're not
[1370.48 - 1374.32] exercising enough or you're not maybe
[1372.24 - 1377.24] you're eating too much maybe you had too
[1374.32 - 1378.80] much fruit one day five years ago here's
[1377.24 - 1383.20] the point
[1378.80 - 1387.08] okay I never said ever just to eat fruit
[1383.20 - 1389.20] I never ever ever told anyone in my life
[1387.08 - 1391.44] to just meaning
[1389.20 - 1394.12] someone someone that didn't have a
[1391.44 - 1396.68] particular problem not like I remember a
[1394.12 - 1398.76] long long time ago there was this child
[1396.68 - 1401.12] that could not eat anything and the mom
[1398.76 - 1403.04] took this child everywhere didn't matter
[1401.12 - 1405.48] what this child would do or couldn't eat
[1403.04 - 1408.16] anything there wouldn't be best doctors
[1405.48 - 1412.76] in the world she flew her she flew her
[1408.16 - 1414.56] son around the world to the best clinics
[1412.76 - 1418.28] best conventional clinics there were on
[1414.56 - 1421.56] the planet all around the globe us
[1418.28 - 1422.48] abroad everywhere and the child couldn't
[1421.56 - 1425.84] e
[1422.48 - 1428.00] anything and then okay spirit said
[1425.84 - 1432.00] bananas is going to be the key and the
[1428.00 - 1433.64] child ate bananas and ate bananas only
[1432.00 - 1435.52] and recovered and it saved the child's
[1433.64 - 1439.24] life now the child's actually just
[1435.52 - 1442.56] filled with muscle strong and adult now
[1439.24 - 1445.92] and living life has children has a
[1442.56 - 1448.48] family and it's because of those bananas
[1445.92 - 1450.20] and I've seen that too with Papaya but
[1448.48 - 1452.48] see these are different circumstances
[1450.20 - 1455.48] these are very trying difficult times of
[1452.48 - 1457.72] food poisoning very very very trying
[1455.48 - 1459.84] different difficult times and even then
[1457.72 - 1461.60] the leafy greens had to come in later
[1459.84 - 1464.08] they still had to come in in order to
[1461.60 - 1465.96] sustain that so there's like people who
[1464.08 - 1467.84] have gone through heck and back with
[1465.96 - 1470.32] food poisoning critical food po
[1467.84 - 1472.76] poisoning issues you know I've seen more
[1470.32 - 1474.68] than one case of a child that could only
[1472.76 - 1476.64] eat banana too it's just there's been
[1474.68 - 1478.48] more than one cases over the last three
[1476.64 - 1481.12] years I talked to doctors where a doctor
[1478.48 - 1483.28] said you know what it's unbelievable
[1481.12 - 1486.16] it's it had a child that was it could
[1483.28 - 1489.40] not eat anything would didn't matter
[1486.16 - 1492.20] what it was it' be debilitating cramping
[1489.40 - 1494.08] except for except for banana and I even
[1492.20 - 1495.52] I even saw that when I was talking to a
[1494.08 - 1497.36] doctor we had a big conversation about
[1495.52 - 1499.32] it one time and so I've seen a doctor go
[1497.36 - 1502.60] through that too where it saved a
[1499.32 - 1505.20] child's life but the leafy greens have
[1502.60 - 1506.36] to come later same thing with you know
[1505.20 - 1508.16] people when they get severe food
[1506.36 - 1509.76] poisoning papaya is the only thing you
[1508.16 - 1512.12] can give them when I had food poisoning
[1509.76 - 1513.44] as a child when I had severe food
[1512.12 - 1516.36] poisoning as a
[1513.44 - 1520.92] child um the only thing that worked for
[1516.36 - 1523.32] me spirit said was pears was pears okay
[1520.92 - 1526.68] so I got these right pears off my my
[1523.32 - 1528.48] great-grandfather's tree and I had an
[1526.68 - 1530.64] abundance of them for like two or three
[1528.48 - 1532.72] straight weeks and I lived off of these
[1530.64 - 1535.84] pears until I can bring in some leafy
[1532.72 - 1538.32] greens and bring in some celery juice
[1535.84 - 1542.16] the point is is that that's the only
[1538.32 - 1545.08] times I've ever ever ever recommended or
[1542.16 - 1548.00] seen wear fruit on its own for a certain
[1545.08 - 1551.00] purpose and there are these certain rare
[1548.00 - 1553.16] situations but other than that everybody
[1551.00 - 1555.68] have ever talked to recommended a diet
[1553.16 - 1558.52] or or some kind of food regime or some
[1555.68 - 1561.20] kind of food you know food s uh system
[1558.52 - 1563.72] some kind of recovery system leafy
[1561.20 - 1565.80] greens were in there celery juice was in
[1563.72 - 1568.92] there other things were in there besides
[1565.80 - 1570.88] fruit and so but fruit is really it's an
[1568.92 - 1573.72] important key to our health and we can't
[1570.88 - 1575.44] lose that but the bottom line is when
[1573.72 - 1578.04] you're plant-based whether you're
[1575.44 - 1580.92] plant-based in in in the mindset of say
[1578.04 - 1582.48] low carb lowfat plant-based you have to
[1580.92 - 1584.40] have those leafy greens or the celery
[1582.48 - 1586.80] juice and you have to have them long
[1584.40 - 1588.80] enough long enough it can't be for one
[1586.80 - 1591.76] month in your life out of 5 years of
[1588.80 - 1593.40] being plant-based it's just it's just
[1591.76 - 1595.40] that you're going to miss out same thing
[1593.40 - 1597.20] with paleo same same with keto same with
[1595.40 - 1598.48] any kind of other diet animal protein if
[1597.20 - 1600.28] you're not doing the leafy greens in the
[1598.48 - 1602.72] celery juice you're going to end up
[1600.28 - 1605.64] having problems you're going to have
[1602.72 - 1608.52] problems because it's the missing link
[1605.64 - 1612.76] and I've been saying this since day one
[1608.52 - 1614.76] day one going back decades now decades
[1612.76 - 1616.60] it's the missing link it's that critical
[1614.76 - 1618.60] and you have to take it that
[1616.60 - 1620.68] seriously it's not just the mineral
[1618.60 - 1623.16] salts that you have to have which are
[1620.68 - 1625.20] critical for our life the trace mineral
[1623.16 - 1626.28] salts it's a phytochemical compounds
[1625.20 - 1628.84] it's the
[1626.28 - 1630.44] alkaloids it's all of it that's in these
[1628.84 - 1632.40] leafy greens it's the
[1630.44 - 1634.88] antioxidants it's the trace mineral
[1632.40 - 1637.32] nutrients it's all of that it's a
[1634.88 - 1639.60] micronutrients it's even more than that
[1637.32 - 1642.12] it's an energy in the leafy green
[1639.60 - 1645.44] there's an energy within the leafy green
[1642.12 - 1648.24] for the human body there's a symbiotic
[1645.44 - 1650.56] relationship that they need each other
[1648.24 - 1652.12] it's so critical if we want to go in
[1650.56 - 1654.28] that direction I know I don't go in that
[1652.12 - 1656.76] direction all the time or I talk about
[1654.28 - 1658.80] that but it's that important and there's
[1656.76 - 1660.24] vegan diets and plant-based diets that
[1658.80 - 1662.00] actually are they're not about the
[1660.24 - 1664.64] lowfat ones they're all about the keto
[1662.00 - 1666.36] vegan keto plant-based it's all about
[1664.64 - 1668.52] heavy fats all the time the nut Butters
[1666.36 - 1670.24] the nuts and everything else and the
[1668.52 - 1672.08] oils and the coconut oil and everything
[1670.24 - 1673.72] like that where's the leafy greens
[1672.08 - 1676.64] where's all the leafy greens and that's
[1673.72 - 1678.40] why that crowd tends to go away from
[1676.64 - 1680.16] vegan eventually once they start getting
[1678.40 - 1681.28] sick or they're losing some weight and
[1680.16 - 1682.52] they're getting a little bit better in
[1681.28 - 1683.92] different ways because they cut out glut
[1682.52 - 1685.68] and they cut out dairy products they cut
[1683.92 - 1687.44] out animal proteins and they end up
[1685.68 - 1689.16] getting sick too because we all have
[1687.44 - 1692.00] things in us and troublemakers and heavy
[1689.16 - 1694.84] metals and it's not coming out and leafy
[1692.00 - 1696.64] greens helps get those out get the bad
[1694.84 - 1698.80] bacteria out get the viruses out a
[1696.64 - 1700.60] little bit get the toxic heavy metals
[1698.80 - 1702.64] out get the poisons out of the liver so
[1700.60 - 1705.20] you don't get sick so no matter where
[1702.64 - 1707.08] you go on what diet front you want to be
[1705.20 - 1711.72] on without the leafy greens and the
[1707.08 - 1712.80] celery juice you're lost it's amazing
[1711.72 - 1714.76] and you know it's not like this
[1712.80 - 1716.48] information's out there spirit's the
[1714.76 - 1718.84] only one putting this information out
[1716.48 - 1721.08] there that's it it's coming from Spirit
[1718.84 - 1722.44] it's coming from up there and and that's
[1721.08 - 1723.76] where I get the information if you
[1722.44 - 1726.04] haven't if you don't know anything about
[1723.76 - 1728.28] the medical medium but the point is is
[1726.04 - 1729.80] that that's where it has to come from
[1728.28 - 1732.24] because no one else has ever talked
[1729.80 - 1734.44] about it it's it's unbelievable we're
[1732.24 - 1736.68] still stuck in that whole protein World
[1734.44 - 1738.36] high fat world and and we're all still
[1736.68 - 1740.12] stuck in that not eating enough leafy
[1738.36 - 1742.20] greens and and all of that so it's
[1740.12 - 1746.04] important leafy greens hold precious and
[1742.20 - 1748.04] vital mineral salts partially composed
[1746.04 - 1750.08] of a group of co-actors associated with
[1748.04 - 1751.44] sodium and in the case of celery juice
[1750.08 - 1752.52] it's a sodium cluster salt which is
[1751.44 - 1755.44] entirely different than what's in a
[1752.52 - 1757.08] leafy green but in the spinach there's
[1755.44 - 1759.96] this partially comp there's this group
[1757.08 - 1763.04] of co-actors associated with sodium that
[1759.96 - 1766.80] group of co-actors is powerful too such
[1763.04 - 1769.40] as Trace bioavailable iodine chromium
[1766.80 - 1773.00] sulfur magnesium calcium potassium
[1769.40 - 1774.44] silica manganese and malinam you know
[1773.00 - 1776.40] all of that critical for
[1774.44 - 1779.12] neurotransmitter and neuros support
[1776.40 - 1781.92] neuron support the foundation the
[1779.12 - 1786.40] building blocks the electrolytes all of
[1781.92 - 1788.16] that see the electrolytes they come from
[1786.40 - 1790.56] the celery juice especially the celery
[1788.16 - 1793.84] juice nothing beats that but the but the
[1790.56 - 1795.48] leafy greens also hold these different
[1793.84 - 1797.32] constituents these different things of
[1795.48 - 1798.96] electrolytes these different Power
[1797.32 - 1800.84] sources electrolytes the different
[1798.96 - 1802.52] groups of electrolytes too so we can get
[1800.84 - 1804.88] some of those from there these leafy
[1802.52 - 1806.56] greens are high in enzymes enzymatic
[1804.88 - 1808.56] power celery juice has like in the
[1806.56 - 1809.92] celery juice book the medical medium
[1808.56 - 1811.48] celery juice book you'll read about the
[1809.92 - 1814.24] enzymes and celery juice which is
[1811.48 - 1817.36] unmatched but still the leafy greens you
[1814.24 - 1820.88] need those enzymes too vitamin A vitamin
[1817.36 - 1823.56] B folic acid alkaloids healing alkaloids
[1820.88 - 1826.04] plant compounds that fight disease are
[1823.56 - 1828.16] in Leafy grains and if you're only
[1826.04 - 1829.80] eating a handful once a while in a mixed
[1828.16 - 1832.04] green salad at a restaurant it's not
[1829.80 - 1836.36] going to be enough micronutrients for
[1832.04 - 1838.64] restoring the endocrine system the power
[1836.36 - 1841.32] these leafy greens have providing
[1838.64 - 1844.96] micronutrients to restore the endocrine
[1841.32 - 1848.20] system these unique groups of nutrients
[1844.96 - 1851.56] working together to feed all organ
[1848.20 - 1853.36] systems all the organ systems that's the
[1851.56 - 1855.36] power I'm talking about from leafy
[1853.36 - 1858.12] greens so guess what let's just throw
[1855.36 - 1859.48] all that away who cares
[1858.12 - 1861.80] let's just make sure you get plenty of
[1859.48 - 1864.08] eggs let's just make sure you get you
[1861.80 - 1865.72] know some turkey let's just make sure
[1864.08 - 1867.44] you get plenty of nuts and N Butters if
[1865.72 - 1870.20] you're vegan let's just make sure you
[1867.44 - 1871.84] get plenty of avocado and some oils and
[1870.20 - 1873.64] maybe get some fish oil too take some
[1871.84 - 1875.12] fish oil capsules take some whe protein
[1873.64 - 1877.48] powder you know I'm kidding right I
[1875.12 - 1880.52] don't want you on any of that really and
[1877.48 - 1881.72] make sure make sure you're getting you
[1880.52 - 1884.00] know let's just say let's make sure
[1881.72 - 1885.20] let's let's focus on oatmeal I mean
[1884.00 - 1886.64] there's nothing wrong with oatmeal but
[1885.20 - 1889.24] the point is is that's what I'm saying
[1886.64 - 1894.20] is without these leafy greens everything
[1889.24 - 1897.28] else will fall flat it will fall flat it
[1894.20 - 1899.16] won't be enough not in this world not
[1897.28 - 1900.80] with what's going on in this world not
[1899.16 - 1902.80] the viruses and bacteria and everything
[1900.80 - 1904.16] else we're up against in this world not
[1902.80 - 1905.48] with all the chronic illness and the
[1904.16 - 1907.92] suffering and the anxiety and the
[1905.48 - 1909.60] depression and the memory loss and the
[1907.92 - 1911.20] brain fog that we're dealing in this
[1909.60 - 1912.60] world and the headaches and the
[1911.20 - 1914.20] migraines and the Tinkles and numbness
[1912.60 - 1916.48] and vertigo and aches and pains and
[1914.20 - 1918.92] ringing in the ears and body aches body
[1916.48 - 1920.52] burning all that different stuff body
[1918.92 - 1923.92] burning that's the body feeling like
[1920.52 - 1926.52] it's on fire the skin rashes lupus
[1923.92 - 1928.44] related rashes ecus ricis all related
[1926.52 - 1930.40] rashes all the different problems
[1928.44 - 1931.84] everybody has it's not going to be
[1930.40 - 1934.32] enough it's going to fall flat without
[1931.84 - 1938.24] the leafy greens and celery juice that's
[1934.32 - 1940.12] it I look you know I mean I'm just kind
[1938.24 - 1942.56] I just got to tell
[1940.12 - 1944.24] you you know I got to keep on going I
[1942.56 - 1945.76] got to keep on going that's what I have
[1944.24 - 1947.68] to do wake up in the morning and say
[1945.76 - 1950.44] let's what can I do for everybody bu
[1947.68 - 1953.12] what can I do how can I help you greens
[1950.44 - 1955.64] are the most bioavailability for for the
[1953.12 - 1958.16] protein aspect too and I don't even care
[1955.64 - 1960.04] about that I don't care about protein
[1958.16 - 1962.96] protein protein because there's protein
[1960.04 - 1966.76] in everything protein's not the problem
[1962.96 - 1969.24] if we if we were like if we weren't sick
[1966.76 - 1972.64] in this world and the whole world wasn't
[1969.24 - 1974.56] getting sick I mean then you then look I
[1972.64 - 1976.16] mean if protein was the answer the whole
[1974.56 - 1978.84] world's getting sick what does it make
[1976.16 - 1980.32] any sense think about it so there's
[1978.84 - 1982.16] plenty of protein in Greens there's
[1980.32 - 1983.64] plenty of protein in all foods it's not
[1982.16 - 1985.44] even the problem but if you're worried
[1983.64 - 1988.36] about if you're one of those protein
[1985.44 - 1990.80] people then don't have any fear there's
[1988.36 - 1992.32] protein and greens that's the thing and
[1990.80 - 1993.92] the thing is with the greens the protein
[1992.32 - 1996.44] and greens no other protein touches it
[1993.92 - 1998.08] it's the best protein there is even
[1996.44 - 1999.68] though it's actually the mineral salts
[1998.08 - 2001.72] not the protein in the leafy greens the
[1999.68 - 2004.20] body needs to build muscle with the
[2001.72 - 2009.72] proteins are still good in in leafy
[2004.20 - 2013.32] greens building muscle all hinges upon a
[2009.72 - 2016.72] carbohydrate and mineral salts building
[2013.32 - 2019.48] muscle all hinges upon a
[2016.72 - 2022.68] carbohydrate and mineral
[2019.48 - 2024.80] salts that's how it works I want to talk
[2022.68 - 2026.32] about bulking for a minute bulking with
[2024.80 - 2027.64] people who are weightlifting bulking
[2026.32 - 2028.68] with people who are actually pushing
[2027.64 - 2029.96] weights they're trying to get big
[2028.68 - 2031.60] they're trying to get muscles all that
[2029.96 - 2033.48] stuff I want to talk about that a little
[2031.60 - 2035.72] bit what people find when they don't
[2033.48 - 2037.96] have enough carbohydrates in their diet
[2035.72 - 2039.88] what they find is a they can't bulk up
[2037.96 - 2041.48] those M muscles as big as they want to
[2039.88 - 2043.60] get them they can't get the muscles to
[2041.48 - 2045.92] where they need to be they can't build
[2043.60 - 2049.08] them like they want to so they end up
[2045.92 - 2050.88] adding carbohydrates to their proteins
[2049.08 - 2053.72] which is fat so they put fat and
[2050.88 - 2055.52] carbohydrates together and they end up
[2053.72 - 2057.64] building more muscle because they
[2055.52 - 2060.12] brought carbohydrates in but they kept
[2057.64 - 2062.84] the fats and because they kept the fats
[2060.12 - 2065.72] they kept fat on their body so they bulk
[2062.84 - 2068.36] up they end up with a layer of fat plus
[2065.72 - 2070.92] more muscle and then they're in the
[2068.36 - 2073.12] realm of how do we cut back how do we
[2070.92 - 2075.20] cut back to somehow get the fat off of
[2073.12 - 2077.68] us and try to keep the muscle it's a
[2075.20 - 2079.28] game that doesn't work out that good
[2077.68 - 2081.12] because now you're trying to cut back
[2079.28 - 2083.28] now you're going it's a yo-yo you're
[2081.12 - 2085.76] going back and forth on a yo-yo and
[2083.28 - 2088.00] you're like trying to cut back on food
[2085.76 - 2090.44] and cut back on carbs again but you
[2088.00 - 2092.48] don't get rid of the protein and the fat
[2090.44 - 2093.76] so you end up you end up getting stuck
[2092.48 - 2095.16] where you get stuck with this little
[2093.76 - 2096.48] excess weight on you and you're trying
[2095.16 - 2097.88] to get rid of it but then you start
[2096.48 - 2099.28] losing your muscle once you get rid of
[2097.88 - 2100.60] carbohydrates again because
[2099.28 - 2102.12] carbohydrates is the one thing that
[2100.60 - 2103.64] builds muscle it's that and mineral
[2102.12 - 2106.80] salts it's
[2103.64 - 2109.36] carbohydrates and that's the whole point
[2106.80 - 2112.92] but if these people just did carbs and
[2109.36 - 2115.08] greens leafy greens lots of carbs
[2112.92 - 2117.96] healthy carbs I'm talking about healthy
[2115.08 - 2120.24] carbs like fruits and leafy greens and
[2117.96 - 2122.60] celery juice if they did these things
[2120.24 - 2126.60] all together you'd be able to build
[2122.60 - 2128.24] bigger muscle and not get the fat layer
[2126.60 - 2129.88] that's the whole thing and not get the
[2128.24 - 2131.88] fat layer why do you think someone has
[2129.88 - 2134.08] to use a carbohydrate to bulk up in
[2131.88 - 2135.96] order to get more muscle why do you
[2134.08 - 2137.80] think they need to bring that in because
[2135.96 - 2139.56] when they're on just their lean meats
[2137.80 - 2141.52] and their vegetables they can't get the
[2139.56 - 2143.08] muscle they just can't get the muscle
[2141.52 - 2144.96] they want so they have to bring in all
[2143.08 - 2146.80] these carbs and it's called bulking and
[2144.96 - 2150.64] you end up with a layer of fat on the
[2146.80 - 2152.24] body and that layer of fat shows hey
[2150.64 - 2153.96] what that layer of fat is it's from all
[2152.24 - 2156.28] the protein and all the and all the
[2153.96 - 2158.64] dense fat plus the carbohydrate combined
[2156.28 - 2162.00] you can't put put those together leafy
[2158.64 - 2163.60] greens contain Omega-3s naturally so
[2162.00 - 2165.24] they're already in there if someone's
[2163.60 - 2167.80] worried about Omega-3s and all the
[2165.24 - 2169.24] omega-3 fatty acids they contain them
[2167.80 - 2170.68] leafy greens have them butter leaf
[2169.24 - 2173.28] lettuce red leaf lettuce they all have
[2170.68 - 2174.32] it greens hold some of that that's
[2173.28 - 2176.68] something right there that's
[2174.32 - 2178.88] automatically in there so it's something
[2176.68 - 2182.20] you know about barley grass juice powder
[2178.88 - 2184.68] is a critical leafy green critical one I
[2182.20 - 2187.20] like the vimergy barley grass juice
[2184.68 - 2190.28] powder it's viz and Victor I EMS and
[2187.20 - 2192.24] Mary E rgy they have the best spirina
[2190.28 - 2195.00] they have the best barley grass juice
[2192.24 - 2196.96] powder hands down I've ever come across
[2195.00 - 2198.48] yet it's a mama poop company I love
[2196.96 - 2200.64] those guys because they care about
[2198.48 - 2203.00] people and when I use it I know it's
[2200.64 - 2205.48] good and I know it's good and so that's
[2203.00 - 2207.40] the kind of leafy green I really like a
[2205.48 - 2208.60] barley grass juice powder I make sure
[2207.40 - 2210.48] that's in there I do the heavy metal
[2208.60 - 2212.20] detox smoothie every morning I put the
[2210.48 - 2214.44] vimergy barley grass juice powder in
[2212.20 - 2216.56] there I put the vimergy spirina in there
[2214.44 - 2218.92] I get the Frozen wild blueberries I put
[2216.56 - 2221.68] the that day I even use the viie uh wild
[2218.92 - 2223.32] blueberry powder I mix it up I mix it up
[2221.68 - 2226.00] in some coconut water I put it in a
[2223.32 - 2227.92] smoothie but the point is that's what
[2226.00 - 2230.20] you need I throw some cilantro in there
[2227.92 - 2231.76] which is my other leafy green I like
[2230.20 - 2234.80] getting my leafy greens from like the
[2231.76 - 2237.64] fresh cilantro I like DOL it's a sea
[2234.80 - 2239.48] Leaf it's a leafy vegetable so I like
[2237.64 - 2241.40] DOL which is a which is a leafy
[2239.48 - 2244.20] vegetable it's what I love but my leafy
[2241.40 - 2246.68] greens is MASH which is MH Water Crest I
[2244.20 - 2249.36] love that one Swiss Shard lettuce red
[2246.68 - 2252.12] leaf lettuce um green leaf lettuce
[2249.36 - 2253.68] spinach kale I love all those those are
[2252.12 - 2255.44] my leafy greens that I use all the time
[2253.68 - 2258.24] darker leafy greens plus lighter leafy
[2255.44 - 2260.20] greens I love them all so that's what I
[2258.24 - 2261.88] do and then I love that DLS in my
[2260.20 - 2264.68] smoothie for the heavy metal detox
[2261.88 - 2267.92] smoothie which is a sea Leaf a sea
[2264.68 - 2269.60] vegetable I love that one and so I put
[2267.92 - 2271.44] the cilantro in there which is a leafy
[2269.60 - 2273.96] green I put the vimergy barley grass
[2271.44 - 2276.08] cheese powder I'm getting my leafy
[2273.96 - 2278.20] greens I wish you guys could because
[2276.08 - 2280.80] it's that important the trace minerals
[2278.20 - 2283.32] how alizing it is it's all
[2280.80 - 2285.80] incredible and then you know it's so
[2283.32 - 2287.60] what matters is if you're into like even
[2285.80 - 2288.92] if you're into exercising and you're not
[2287.60 - 2290.72] just trying to recover from a chronic
[2288.92 - 2292.56] illness and build some muscle you're
[2290.72 - 2294.84] just you feel fine and you want to build
[2292.56 - 2298.00] muscle you don't have to combine all
[2294.84 - 2300.04] that fat with all those bad carbs to try
[2298.00 - 2302.68] to bulk up because that's what people do
[2300.04 - 2304.60] now you want the healthy
[2302.68 - 2306.12] carbohydrates you want the fruits you
[2304.60 - 2307.92] want the mangoes you want the papayas
[2306.12 - 2309.56] you want all that in there you want the
[2307.92 - 2311.80] oranges you want the apples you want the
[2309.56 - 2313.44] pears you want all that healthy fruit
[2311.80 - 2315.20] you want the the blueberries the wild
[2313.44 - 2317.48] blueberries and then you want to combine
[2315.20 - 2319.68] that with leafy greens and celery juice
[2317.48 - 2322.64] make sure that's in your program whether
[2319.68 - 2324.08] you're plant-based or your paleo or your
[2322.64 - 2325.72] animal protein and you're adding in the
[2324.08 - 2326.96] animal protein into your diet or if
[2325.72 - 2329.00] you're plant-based and you're adding in
[2326.96 - 2330.68] something else into your diet would it
[2329.00 - 2332.56] could be beans I see plant-based people
[2330.68 - 2335.28] on beans whatever it is that's what you
[2332.56 - 2336.68] want to do and that with your workout is
[2335.28 - 2338.84] how you start building some mustard
[2336.68 - 2340.08] muscles you know and unless you you know
[2338.84 - 2342.64] unless you've been through chronic
[2340.08 - 2344.32] illness been through Hellen Mac you got
[2342.64 - 2345.72] fatigue you got nerve pain and you're
[2344.32 - 2347.16] trying to get rid of the viruses through
[2345.72 - 2348.68] the medical medium information to clean
[2347.16 - 2350.20] those viruses out and you're trying to
[2348.68 - 2351.56] start to work out again for the first
[2350.20 - 2353.60] time in a long time then you take it
[2351.56 - 2355.76] easy and I'm going to do a whole show on
[2353.60 - 2357.28] that again about how all that works you
[2355.76 - 2358.88] can recover your muscles recover your
[2357.28 - 2360.92] bodies as you're healing from chronic
[2358.88 - 2362.80] illness so I'll do a whole show on that
[2360.92 - 2364.16] too and I'm also going to do a show on
[2362.80 - 2366.68] just in general muscle building
[2364.16 - 2369.08] bodybuilding in the future because it's
[2366.68 - 2371.08] never been my focus my focus is about
[2369.08 - 2372.40] saving lives offering life-saving
[2371.08 - 2374.16] information that's ahead of Science of
[2372.40 - 2376.04] research and chronic illness getting
[2374.16 - 2378.72] people recovered from the deaths of
[2376.04 - 2380.84] Despair that's always been my focus it's
[2378.72 - 2384.20] not about building a few muscles it's
[2380.84 - 2386.00] always been about recovering people so
[2384.20 - 2389.04] they can get to a point where they can
[2386.00 - 2390.80] work out and and because they can't
[2389.04 - 2393.24] because they're suffering and they're
[2390.80 - 2394.92] sick they got the lupus and the Ms and
[2393.24 - 2397.48] they got the hives breaking out the
[2394.92 - 2400.20] fatigue the anxiety severe depression
[2397.48 - 2402.44] body aches and pains their face hurt
[2400.20 - 2404.08] nerves teeth hurt they can't talk they
[2402.44 - 2406.32] can barely walk so the people have
[2404.08 - 2408.36] helped out recovering my whole life for
[2406.32 - 2410.04] decades so I never I never worried about
[2408.36 - 2411.92] the bodybuilding aspect of it because
[2410.04 - 2413.20] it's about saving lives not about
[2411.92 - 2415.72] getting somebody to look better for the
[2413.20 - 2417.36] beach that's never been my issue it's
[2415.72 - 2419.72] never been my goal to worry about that
[2417.36 - 2421.60] but I do help professional athletes I do
[2419.72 - 2423.92] help them to get better on their game
[2421.60 - 2425.80] all of that over the years absolutely
[2423.92 - 2428.44] and to build more muscle and get more
[2425.80 - 2430.84] agile more flexibility and all of that
[2428.44 - 2433.08] of course but the goal has always been
[2430.84 - 2434.48] people suffering struggling getting out
[2433.08 - 2436.04] of the depths of despair of the chronic
[2434.48 - 2437.60] illness finally getting answers for the
[2436.04 - 2439.28] first time ahead of science and research
[2437.60 - 2441.32] so they could rise above it helping out
[2439.28 - 2442.84] their family members all of that and
[2441.32 - 2444.52] that's what the books are about and
[2442.84 - 2446.60] that's what these shows are about leafy
[2444.52 - 2448.16] greens are a part of that so let's move
[2446.60 - 2450.76] on to the next part of leafy greens this
[2448.16 - 2452.56] is so great the 28 day cleanse in
[2450.76 - 2454.24] medical medium book one the 28 day
[2452.56 - 2455.92] cleanse I love that one powerful I've
[2454.24 - 2458.64] seen it bring lives back long before
[2455.92 - 2461.00] that book was published and the spinach
[2458.64 - 2462.76] soup in the 28 day cleanse and this is
[2461.00 - 2464.68] for anybody who's animal protein non-
[2462.76 - 2466.36] animal protein because it's a 28 day
[2464.68 - 2468.56] cleanse to get them back on track I've
[2466.36 - 2470.48] seen people live on this 28 day cleanse
[2468.56 - 2472.08] for years in their life recovering
[2470.48 - 2473.80] themselves getting themselves in in the
[2472.08 - 2475.48] in and where they want to be the
[2473.80 - 2478.84] Perfection to their health the way they
[2475.48 - 2481.64] want but the bottom line is um spinach
[2478.84 - 2483.72] soup is a big part of it all that
[2481.64 - 2484.92] spinach soup you take a whole bunch of
[2483.72 - 2487.00] spinach in there I'm not talking about a
[2484.92 - 2489.28] little handful of spinach I'm talking
[2487.00 - 2491.84] about like two three cups of spinach
[2489.28 - 2493.92] half a container half a big container I
[2491.84 - 2496.16] put one full container in there and you
[2493.92 - 2498.16] keep on blending it up in your in your
[2496.16 - 2499.84] mixer keep on blending it up I throw it
[2498.16 - 2501.64] in the food processor and I do it I like
[2499.84 - 2503.40] it in the blender the mixer I really
[2501.64 - 2506.28] like it in the blender for this one 2
[2503.40 - 2509.52] and 1/2 cups of chopped um chopped
[2506.28 - 2511.48] spinach love it I put that in there it's
[2509.52 - 2513.96] incredible I throw a couple of large
[2511.48 - 2515.52] tomatoes in there mixing I you could put
[2513.96 - 2517.64] cherry tomatoes in there I like the
[2515.52 - 2519.16] large tomatoes an heirloom tomato I like
[2517.64 - 2521.00] to put in there too two heirloom
[2519.16 - 2525.08] tomatoes like to put a good handful of
[2521.00 - 2528.08] cilantro in there too and one stock of
[2525.08 - 2529.64] celery or half a stock of celery believe
[2528.08 - 2532.04] it or not just put that in there like a
[2529.64 - 2534.48] little half clove of garlic if you're a
[2532.04 - 2537.20] you know a garlic person I love garlic
[2534.48 - 2539.48] it's it's a miracle medicine too I love
[2537.20 - 2540.60] it so I put like a half a clove in there
[2539.48 - 2543.16] sometimes it's too strong for other
[2540.60 - 2545.68] people people hate garlic it's all that
[2543.16 - 2547.72] and then I squeeze some fresh oranges in
[2545.68 - 2549.56] there tan tangin just a couple of
[2547.72 - 2551.08] tangerines or a couple oranges I squeeze
[2549.56 - 2553.16] in there I make sure they're not the
[2551.08 - 2555.12] real bitey ones they they're sweet

[2559.16 - 2562.24] citruses add at different times
[2560.96 - 2564.16] sometimes you get an orange it's really
[2562.24 - 2567.20] bitey it's got a little little bit of an
[2564.16 - 2568.60] acidy flavor and it's too spritely but
[2567.20 - 2570.12] there's a lot of oranges they're sweet
[2568.60 - 2571.40] they're juicy they're delicious they
[2570.12 - 2573.36] can't be afraid of them because they're
[2571.40 - 2575.52] amazing for the body I squeeze that in
[2573.36 - 2578.12] there I blend it up and you got the
[2575.52 - 2580.60] spinach soup you blend it up real nice
[2578.12 - 2583.52] fill it in Nice in a good size Bowl you

[2586.04 - 2589.88] amount of spinach leafy greens in you to
[2588.32 - 2593.32] get you better now if you're someone
[2589.88 - 2595.76] that's in fear of the whole hey oxyc
[2593.32 - 2598.36] acid oxalates oxyc acid spinach stay
[2595.76 - 2600.60] away from it you're completely wrong the
[2598.36 - 2602.76] fresh spinach there's nothing of that
[2600.60 - 2605.20] concern going on there at all it it's
[2602.76 - 2607.44] far from it it's when you cook spinach
[2605.20 - 2609.16] it's the opposite it see somebody
[2607.44 - 2611.60] flipped that a while back with
[2609.16 - 2613.52] misinformation years ago I don't know
[2611.60 - 2615.40] who did it or how they did it or how
[2613.52 - 2618.00] they accomplished it I don't know if it
[2615.40 - 2620.24] was on purpose by accident by default
[2618.00 - 2621.72] whatever but they flipped it they said
[2620.24 - 2623.32] cooking Your Spinach you know to get rid
[2621.72 - 2625.68] of the oxyc acid that's the only way you
[2623.32 - 2627.00] should eat that's that's the opposite
[2625.68 - 2630.00] You Hinder the spinach you hurt the
[2627.00 - 2632.56] spinach you make the oxyc acid actually
[2630.00 - 2634.32] you destabilize it you know when it's
[2632.56 - 2636.92] when it's that but when it's in raw
[2634.32 - 2639.24] spinach it's in a form that's completely
[2636.92 - 2641.68] harmless it's not a it's not an issue
[2639.24 - 2643.84] with oxyc acid at all when it's raw and
[2641.68 - 2646.56] its raw state is the way to Eat Your
[2643.84 - 2650.04] Spinach it brings back vitality and

[2655.64 - 2659.56] recovering their health I can't tell you
[2657.76 - 2662.44] what that spinach soup has done to save
[2659.56 - 2666.08] lives in the past from people who were

[2819.36 - 2823.88] knee pain that's just some of the things
[2821.36 - 2825.92] in lifechanging Foods I just I just read
[2823.88 - 2829.16] that right out of life-changing foods
[2825.92 - 2830.96] that part right there so you know leafy
[2829.16 - 2833.96] greens are that important look what they

[2836.24 - 2840.36] can help rebuild your hydrochloric acid
[2838.12 - 2842.60] now celery juice helps rebuild your
[2840.36 - 2844.68] hydrochloric acid like no other but the
[2842.60 - 2847.52] leafy greens also add to it too and help
[2844.68 - 2849.64] rebuild it that's another thing too they

[2866.80 - 2870.28] balance blood sugar work with the
[2868.48 - 2874.16] hormones these are just some of the
[2870.28 - 2877.48] things the leafy greens can do it's that
[2874.16 - 2881.08] powerful so the bottom line is if you
[2877.48 - 2883.60] got a guru that you go to and you got a
[2881.08 - 2885.08] book you love out there and if you're
[2883.60 - 2887.68] not getting enough leafy greens in the
[2885.08 - 2890.36] diet and celery juice that book's
[2887.68 - 2893.16] falling short and the guru is falling
[2890.36 - 2896.48] short not because the guru is not a good
[2893.16 - 2898.28] person it's not that at all I'm sure you
[2896.48 - 2899.84] know that Guru is a great person I'm
[2898.28 - 2901.96] sure that coach is a great person I'm
[2899.84 - 2903.44] sure that trainer is a great person I'm
[2901.96 - 2905.04] sure that trainer seems like they got it
[2903.44 - 2906.28] all down in the gym and they got some
[2905.04 - 2908.32] muscles they know all kinds of stuff
[2906.28 - 2909.48] about protein and what shakes to use and
[2908.32 - 2912.04] they and they know about you know
[2909.48 - 2913.92] different things and all that and and
[2912.04 - 2916.80] all of it I'm sure they're really good
[2913.92 - 2918.08] too with what they do absolutely I'm
[2916.80 - 2920.00] sure your best functional medicine
[2918.08 - 2921.72] doctor is good what he does I'm sure
[2920.00 - 2922.92] that book or pamphlet you picked up or
[2921.72 - 2925.04] something you found online or that
[2922.92 - 2926.60] website on online but if it doesn't have
[2925.04 - 2928.28] the celery juice it doesn't have the
[2926.60 - 2929.52] celery juice in the right amount so make
[2928.28 - 2930.80] sure you get the medical medium celery
[2929.52 - 2933.00] juice book so you know the right amounts
[2930.80 - 2934.60] of celery juice to use if you don't have
[2933.00 - 2935.96] the right amount of celery juice and the
[2934.60 - 2937.76] right amount of leafy greens and the
[2935.96 - 2939.64] different varieties of leafy greens in
[2937.76 - 2942.28] your diet on a daily basis no matter
[2939.64 - 2945.56] what you're doing you're missing the
[2942.28 - 2947.60] most important aspect of your health and
[2945.56 - 2950.48] your life your well-being and your
[2947.60 - 2953.32] recovery think about that so whatever
[2950.48 - 2955.56] you subscribe to whatever that might be
[2953.32 - 2957.88] whatever that is it's not going to be
[2955.56 - 2960.88] true it's not going to be true to who
[2957.88 - 2963.32] you are your physical needs your body
[2960.88 - 2965.04] your organs what your soul needs if the
[2963.32 - 2967.56] leafy greens and the seler juice aren't
[2965.04 - 2969.56] there bottom line that's it and if
[2967.56 - 2971.40] you're into the whole like ancestry
[2969.56 - 2973.12] thing where it's the Paleo and the old
[2971.40 - 2974.92] old cavemen and all that if you're into
[2973.12 - 2976.80] that whole thing where where all that
[2974.92 - 2978.04] that that fake science gets developed
[2976.80 - 2979.96] just like fake science in all the
[2978.04 - 2981.76] movements and everything from veganism
[2979.96 - 2983.20] to pism to all that where everybody's
[2981.76 - 2984.60] just throwing science at each other and
[2983.20 - 2986.08] hoping something sticks on the wall
[2984.60 - 2987.84] because they're hoping and they're just
[2986.08 - 2989.52] all digging for things whatever you
[2987.84 - 2992.76] believe in that you fell
[2989.52 - 2995.20] into okay just know that the world has
[2992.76 - 2997.92] changed the world has changed 10 years
[2995.20 - 3001.48] ago you guys the world has changed 15
[2997.92 - 3004.48] years ago we're more polluted now we're
[3001.48 - 3006.64] more hindered Now by pathogens that it
[3004.48 - 3008.72] basically mutated Epstein bar was
[3006.64 - 3010.60] nothing like it was when I was do when I
[3008.72 - 3013.04] was doing this back 20 years ago helping
[3010.60 - 3014.32] people 20 25 years ago the varieties of
[3013.04 - 3015.32] Epstein bar that were out there now
[3014.32 - 3017.48] compared to the ones that are being
[3015.32 - 3020.56] passed around now that people are
[3017.48 - 3022.20] Contracting nothing like it was we're up
[3020.56 - 3025.04] against toxic heavy metals like never
[3022.20 - 3026.76] before in history we're inundated with
[3025.04 - 3028.32] toxic heavy metals we're desperate to
[3026.76 - 3030.40] get the heavy metal detox smoothie for
[3028.32 - 3032.88] medical medium we're we're desperate to
[3030.40 - 3034.72] get that out of the body those Metals
[3032.88 - 3036.36] out of the body we're desperate to get
[3034.72 - 3038.12] those leafy greens and the barley grass
[3036.36 - 3040.12] juice powder in us every day we're
[3038.12 - 3042.32] desperate to get the celery juice in us
[3040.12 - 3044.28] every day to pull the stuff out so if we
[3042.32 - 3047.00] think about hey back in the old days
[3044.28 - 3048.88] back thousands of years ago you know uh
[3047.00 - 3051.32] men just picked a few berries and they
[3048.88 - 3053.08] hunted down some game and they ate a few
[3051.32 - 3056.20] mushrooms and that's what they needed
[3053.08 - 3059.32] you that that that does not apply
[3056.20 - 3061.32] it doesn't it doesn't apply at all we
[3059.32 - 3063.40] have so many different disorders that
[3061.32 - 3066.76] have developed that never existed ever
[3063.40 - 3068.72] in history before ever so many different
[3066.76 - 3070.60] diagnoses somebody can get so many
[3068.72 - 3071.84] non-diagnosis they can get with so much
[3070.60 - 3074.28] confusion with so many different
[3071.84 - 3076.80] problems and symptoms mystery chronic
[3074.28 - 3079.52] illness has turned into something unlike
[3076.80 - 3081.36] ever before in our history today and
[3079.52 - 3083.36] that's why we need the juices that's why
[3081.36 - 3085.08] juicing is critical if you're one of
[3083.36 - 3087.16] those that believes you know you have to
[3085.08 - 3089.00] have the fiber yeah who's who's taking
[3087.16 - 3091.04] your fiber away I'm telling you to eat
[3089.00 - 3092.36] leafy greens I'm telling you eat fruits
[3091.04 - 3094.16] and vegetables and leafy greens who's
[3092.36 - 3096.12] taking your fiber away because that's
[3094.16 - 3098.20] the only place we get fiber so pretty
[3096.12 - 3099.96] much the only place we get real fiber
[3098.20 - 3103.08] but the celery juice and juicing is
[3099.96 - 3105.04] critical because our bodies aren't even
[3103.08 - 3107.20] able to handle food so good they're so
[3105.04 - 3110.44] worn down internally our guts are such a
[3107.20 - 3112.80] mess we need the revitalization of the
[3110.44 - 3115.12] juices to revitalize to strengthen this
[3112.80 - 3116.72] so we can actually even handle fiber
[3115.12 - 3118.96] that's the whole point so we can even
[3116.72 - 3121.84] handle fiber to the degree that we need
[3118.96 - 3123.72] to handle it that's how important it is
[3121.84 - 3125.60] you can juice your leafy greens too I
[3123.72 - 3126.96] like doing two juices I like big big
[3125.60 - 3128.48] celery juice in the morning is what I
[3126.96 - 3130.04] like to do the end of the day I like to
[3128.48 - 3131.52] do a whole another juice where I add
[3130.04 - 3133.00] celery and then I add a few more things
[3131.52 - 3135.64] of course it stops the celery juice from
[3133.00 - 3137.36] working the celery itself but I add the
[3135.64 - 3139.24] leafy greens cucumbers I like the
[3137.36 - 3140.68] cucumber and leafy green juice that's
[3139.24 - 3142.52] what I like at the end of the day maybe
[3140.68 - 3143.64] a couple of stocks of celery in there
[3142.52 - 3145.84] it's not going to do what the celeries
[3143.64 - 3147.88] just did in the morning cuz by itself it
[3145.84 - 3149.84] has to be by itself to do the power it
[3147.88 - 3151.12] really has but I like separating like
[3149.84 - 3154.72] doing two
[3151.12 - 3156.88] juices but the point is it's juicing is
[3154.72 - 3158.56] important so you need to know that
[3156.88 - 3160.00] that's why I used my mega juicer and I
[3158.56 - 3162.20] just put it all through there and that's
[3160.00 - 3164.52] it it's the best one that ever that's
[3162.20 - 3167.60] ever been made out there but the bottom
[3164.52 - 3170.12] line is you guys have to make sure
[3167.60 - 3172.12] you're getting your leafy greens look I
[3170.12 - 3174.24] know this show is probably tough on a
[3172.12 - 3175.96] lot of a lot of people because you're
[3174.24 - 3177.92] hearing me say
[3175.96 - 3179.28] look no matter what you're subscribing
[3177.92 - 3181.24] to out there if you don't get enough
[3179.28 - 3184.56] leafy greens and the juices and the
[3181.24 - 3186.96] celery juice applied into it it's not
[3184.56 - 3189.40] going to be its best and I get it if I
[3186.96 - 3191.08] heard that if I was living my life and
[3189.40 - 3192.76] listening to the best doctor out there
[3191.08 - 3194.44] or the best book I read or whatever it
[3192.76 - 3195.76] is that's out there on stuff and I'm
[3194.44 - 3197.16] doing it and and all of a sudden I'm
[3195.76 - 3200.12] hearing this right now I'd probably be
[3197.16 - 3203.24] irritated too but just kick back sit
[3200.12 - 3205.68] back and realize I'm working for you I'm
[3203.24 - 3207.28] working for you you can just throw away
[3205.68 - 3209.84] you can throw what I'm doing away you
[3207.28 - 3212.16] can throw what I me working for you away
[3209.84 - 3214.36] you can push it aside you can forget
[3212.16 - 3216.52] about it may maybe it's wasted energy on
[3214.36 - 3218.00] my side then cuz you maybe you don't
[3216.52 - 3220.12] like that and you're just like I don't
[3218.00 - 3223.00] care if he's working for me who cares
[3220.12 - 3224.84] but I'm working for you no matter what
