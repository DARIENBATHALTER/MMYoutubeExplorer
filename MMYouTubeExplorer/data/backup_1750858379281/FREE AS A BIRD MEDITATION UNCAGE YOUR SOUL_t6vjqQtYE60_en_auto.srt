00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,440
experience you haven't felt before

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,720
it's a medical medium podcast at apple

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,120
podcast i'm giving

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,159
you that right there that forewarning

95
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,400

um actually says the meditations have

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,680
been so uplifting

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,879
this one right here actually unlocks and

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,799
frees the wire

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,000
cage that's around the sole and that

101
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,599
wire cage is made

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,480
up of broken relationships friendships

103
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,360
confrontations misunderstandings being

104
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,280
judged

105
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,120
losses in your life all these things

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,000
that we kind of put we push aside we

107
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,840
push aside

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,680
and it builds up and it builds up and it

109
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,159
stays in us and it stays with us

110
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,879
and it gets in our way then we can't

111
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,200
trust

112
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,959
and then we make decisions out of the

113
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
fact that we can't trust

114
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,120
so we make decisions that may not be the

115
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,120
best because of this you want

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,560
this pain this emotional pain that so

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,200

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,639
so it's really important there too while

193
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
the green they've all been so powerful

194
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,360
hard to describe how healing it's beyond

195
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,639
words

196
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,160
this one i love this one you know a lot

197
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,680
of times we go through a life

198
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,680
we're misunderstood has that ever

199
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759

200
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,240
you know lost something important to you

201
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,160
in your life have you ever been betrayed

202
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,800
have you had somebody break your trust

203
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,120
or broken promises throughout your life

204
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
maybe a broken relationship did someone

205
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,759
cheat on you

206
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,280
did you have a divorce in your life

207
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,880
which is so difficult

208
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,840
what kind of challenges have you been

209
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
going through are you going through

210
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,840
financial challenges

211
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,080
this meditation is critical for that

212
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,280
critical for also alleviating fear

213
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,160
and anxiety and pain emotional pain

214
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,880
it's got the power to give emotional

215
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,919
relief

216
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,240
within minutes that's what the free

217
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,800
free is a birth meditation will do and

218
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,680
margie says it's truly freeing

219
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
incredible and um tammy says i love the

220
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
meditations

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,960
but i keep falling asleep during them

222
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,199
laugh out loud that's fantastic because

223
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,240
because if that's what it's doing then

224
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,919
you're healing

225
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,599
you're healing on a deep level because

226
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,960
when you fall asleep during one of these

227
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,039
meditations

228
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,720
i'm still there guiding you through it

229
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
and the healing process is happening

230
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,919
through the subconscious mind

231
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,199
so it's really really powerful your

232
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,120
neurons in the emotional center of the

233
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,080
brain are still connecting to the

234
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,560
meditation

235
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,319
you can't go wrong with that um you love

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,919

up that's incredible too

238
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,319
um and so we all get lost and we all get

239
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,639
disconnected down here it's the way it

240
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,400

ichoda says they really are easier to do

271
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,279
than any other meditations i've tried

272
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,959
that's what meditations are supposed to

273
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,240
be they're supposed to be

274
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,839
giving not taking so i just want to tell

275
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,200
you that a meditation

276
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,120
because i learned this from spirit of

277
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,959
compassion a meditation is supposed to

278
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,920
be only giving to you

279
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,640
not taking anything from you meaning not

280
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,800
taking

281
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,200
energy not taking your thoughts your

282
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,519
time it's not supposed to do that

283
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
this is a med these are meditations that

284
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,959
only fulfill

285
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
and give and then get rid of poison

286
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,839
that's in our soul get rid of hardship

287
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,399
and hurt

288
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,160
but man-made meditations are still great

289
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,880
i still recommend them someone likes

290
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,720
them hey

291
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,000
that works you do it whatever if you

292
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,120
love doing that but

293
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,440
they're more difficult to do because

294
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,320
they actually spin your wheels and they

295
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,959
they make you

296
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
work for it but at the same time don't

297
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,839
give you enough

298
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,440
back i hear this all the time i hear it

299
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,600
from gurus that i know

300
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,720
spiritual healers that i know out there

301
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
in the world and they'll tell they'll

302
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
tell me that there's a lot of

303
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,120
meditations that work and don't work

304
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,600
and these are geared to do the work

305
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,519
for you i'm guiding you through it

306
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,360
they're actually releasing the pain

307
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,800
suffering the emotional loss and the

308
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
fear and

309
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,079
because these meditations are from above

310
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,480
something really important to know try

311
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,120
it try it if you're if you if you guys

312
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,560
want to

313
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,240
for sure um amber says i'm dealing with

314
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,360
heartbreak wow

315
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,640
and and you love someone deeply and um

316
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,240
you don't know if we're good for each

317
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,000
other will this help you yes i would

318
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
what i would recommend okay if you're

319
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,480
going through that

320
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,399
i would recommend the moon meditation or

321
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,560
the free is a bird meditation so i would

322
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,600
probably go back and forth on both of

323
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,600
those

324
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,200
if you got a lot of fear though

325
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
somewhere inside of you

326
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
the brain meditation that's a really

327
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
good one too or you had really serious

328
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,760
losses

329
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,760
that one would be really good the brain

330
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,000
meditation but you guys

331
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,120
share these if you can we're a grass

332
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,560
roots movement

333
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,120
is what we are this whole movement

334
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,680
has been built on people actually

335
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,880
healing

336
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,360
versus money dumped into things and pr

337
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,959
and marketing and all that we didn't

338
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,560
have any of that spirit and i

339
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,480
okay spirit of compassion and i didn't

340
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,640
have that it's always been about

341
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,959
someone healed and told somebody else

342
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,160
another person healed told somebody else

343
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,680
so if you can share these episodes so

344
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,440
other people can heal so

345
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,920
because when i wake up in the morning

346
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,440
i'm like okay who needs to heal

347
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,320
who needs this information who needs

348
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,800
the powerful experience that they can

349
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,800
have

350
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,279
so they can move past what's holding

351
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,120
them back who needs to heal in some way

352
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,760
both physically with the books and both

353
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,079
emotionally with the meditations

354
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,079

385
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,639
said oh my god me too i am knocked out

386
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
of sleep too

387
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,680
i go into deep sleep and i wake up at

388
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,720
the end that's

389
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,880
that is healing because what's happening

390
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,079
i'm doing the work for it for you so

391
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,959
that you can even

392
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,600
sleep during the meditation think about

393
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,200
that

394
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,519
you can actually sleep during the

395
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,160
meditation while i do the work with

396
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,560
spirit of compassion's information right

397
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,160
and healing technique so i do the work

398
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,160
as the messenger

399
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,839
so your subconscious mind is getting the

400
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,279
information while you're sleeping

401
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,079
and you're healing and that is really

402
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,279
powerful

403
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,000
it's really incredible um tobias say

404
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,000
tobias

405
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,639
it's amazing that you can listen to this

406
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,079
for free absolutely tobias

407
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,519
medical medium information has always

408
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,200
been for free and there's always been

409
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,320
this old saying out there

410
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,240
that if you have to charge for somebody

411
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,279
to think it's valuable

412
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,000
uh i don't buy into that okay i don't

413
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,399
all right

414
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,079
because i know that's the whole gig out

415
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,800
there and you know with all the stuff

416
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,880
it's like

417
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
charge then they actually think it's

418
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,000
worth it or valuable

419
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,519
so pay for it and then they'll actually

420
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,279
see it's worth no

421
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,279
that's not that shouldn't work like that

422
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,680
okay you give it out for free

423
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,399
if it's powerful it's powerful if it

424
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,199
works

425
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,880
it works okay medical medium books have

426
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,440
already saved millions of lives around

427
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
the planet

428
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,519
medical medium information has already

429
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,320
saved lives and celery juice is one of

430
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,399
the tools

431
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
um but the bottom line is these

432
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,639
meditations guess they're free

433
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,079
of course the link is in description

434
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,480
share it with someone else

435
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,519
for free share it with someone else so

436
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,040
they can heal

437
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
if you don't have an apple device go to

438
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,720
medicalmedium.com

439
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,480
and go to the menu see podcasts in the

440
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,959
menu and just listen to them for free

441
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,680
there

442
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,480
but apple is the place that i officially

443
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,600
lost it

444
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,279
well lost it officially launched it and

445
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
so that people can find their way and

446
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,760
not be lost

447
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,279
during their healing because that's the

448
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,560
whole point because it's uncensored

449
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,399
there and i was worried

450
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,600
that if i launched it on another

451
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,000
platform official

452
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,199
launch at another platform that you guys

453
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,440

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,360
not get the pieces you need you know

455
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,839

it gets it gets uncensored that's not

457
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,279
going to happen

458
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,160

771
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,919
lately because i noticed that

772

my salary bill is going down because i'm

773
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,279
buying less celery because it squeezes

774
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,880
every last juice so i just

775
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,640
when you add that up by the end of the

776
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,240
year what that saves you

777
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
pays for the juicer over and over and

778
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,159
