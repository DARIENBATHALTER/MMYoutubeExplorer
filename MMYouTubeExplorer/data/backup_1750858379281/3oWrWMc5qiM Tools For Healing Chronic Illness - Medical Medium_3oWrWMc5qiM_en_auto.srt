guys a rundown on what i got going going

47
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,759
on

48
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,320
it's good to see everybody coming on

49
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,759
here so this is exciting this mm 1500

50
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,799
you guys

51
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,280
food costs going up going up i said it a

52
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,920
year ago i said it a year ago the reason

53
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,040
why i like the mm-900 and the mm 1500

54
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,720
right here is because it saves me money

55
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720
and i know it's saving other people

56
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
money too so when they're juicing it's

57
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,799
saving saving the money so what happens

58
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,280
is when you go to a juice bar

59
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,600
you're paying more now for the juice

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,240
than ever before in a juice bar right

61
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,119
when you make it at home to help heal

62
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,240
yourself you're paying away less when

63
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,640
you use a juicer that squeezes more out

64
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,759
of the celery and out of the greens

65
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,360
right

66
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,160
when you use a juicer that's squeezing

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,879
more and more out of it you're saving

68
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,440
more money that's the whole point before

69
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,840
the food crisis like where the food food

70
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
prices are going up right before that i

71
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,040
was already saving myself a few thousand

72
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,080
dollars a year more

73
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
with actually doing like the mm-900

74
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,640
right

75
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,560

getter too as well

84
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,360
so what i love about

85
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,120
saving money with the juicing is because

86
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,239
i'm seeing friends going to juice bars

87
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,480
right they go into a juice bar and

88
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,200
they're like why was my juice 20

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,560
why was my celery in green juice 20

90
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,280
why was my green juice in la 25

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,720
now right the price and that's all over

92
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,720
the country and around the world the

93
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,440
prices are going up right so what i love

94
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,000
about juicing at home

95
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
myself is the juicer pays for itself and

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,080
it's saving me money and that's what's

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
happening so every time i'm juicing

98
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,280
every single morning i'm saving myself

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
money it's paying for itself which is

100
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,599
incredible so the juicer pays for itself

101
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,440
over and over and over again i get big

102
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,000
glasses of celery juice that i'm not

103
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,920
paying 25 for

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,680
because it's squeezed this juicer

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,440
squeezes so much out of it so that's

106
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,959
just cool all on its own man so

107
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,720
important so let's start making some ice

108
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,760

109
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,599

bit of kale through here as well but

402
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,199
we'll just do a little straight celery

403
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,760
juice to start with so if you're doing

404
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,600
straight celery juice

405
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,040
here we go

406
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,120
i washed this celery really good this is

407
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,680
conventional celery

408
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,760
just so you know

409
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,120
if you got organic celery

410
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,920
incredible

411
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,480
right

412
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,480
couldn't get any organic right now

413
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,639
so i was like you know what

414
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
still incredible to juice

415
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,399
this

416
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,760
conventional celery absolutely wash it

417
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,800
really good

418
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,360
so what i'm doing right now

419
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,920
is i'm doing straight

420
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
celery

421
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,240
what you'll notice is the pulp is not so

422
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,440
sloppy wet

423
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,160
because it's extracting so much out of

424
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,160
the celery

425
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,880
yeah

426
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,320
now

427
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,800
the whole thing about celery in itself

428
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,160
is it's turning lives around

429
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,160
here's the here's the point that's

430
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,639
actually kind of funny there's a lot of

431
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,959
people juicing celery it's keeping them

432
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,240
afloat while they're doing all this bad

433
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,560
stuff

434
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,160
so they're doing all this bad stuff

435
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,759
they're doing supplements that are bad

436
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,440
like supplements that are actually not

437
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,360
good for them they're doing other things

438
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,800
that are bad they're eating things that

439
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,240
aren't good for them they're drinking

440
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,320
things that aren't good for them and

441
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,639
then they're juicing celery and the

442
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,480
celery is keeping them afloat while

443
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,040
they're doing all this other bad stuff

444
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,120
the celery juice is keeping them alive

445
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,399
it's keeping their skin clear it's

446
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,040
keeping their mind working better

447
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,880
the electrolytes and celery is like no

448
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,680
other when you're doing celery juice

449
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,639
it's critical to do it by itself in the

450
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,800
morning

451
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,800
and then you can do celery and like a

452
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,480
green a leafy green i'll show you how to

453
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,120
do that at the end of the day

454
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,320
you guys just came on here sale mm-1500

455
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
i'm going to make a few things

456
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,199
so

457
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,519
right now i'm making some killer celery

458
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,519
juice

459
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,800
germ theory you're worried about mineral

460
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,919
deficiencies that's a great way to clear

461
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,919
up mineral deficiencies is by using

462
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,520
celery juice because of the trace

463
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,679
mineral salts are so

464
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,000
so over the top that's one of the things

465
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,400
that really helps santara's healing good

466
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
to see you

467
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,919

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,120
things it doesn't work

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,520
one of the most powerful tools it's one

481
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,600
of the most

482
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,480
powerful tools for chronic illness it's

483
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,799
a medical medium tool

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,919
and i'll tell you what

486
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,679
everybody everybody right all the

487
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,200
influencers they're all trying to sell

488
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,799
their potion they're all trying to sell

489
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,559
their stuff out there right so they

490
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,559
don't want to talk about their celery

491
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,400
juice anymore because they can't make

492
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,960
any money off of celery juice and they

493
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,880
don't want to make celery farms rich

494
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,200
so but they're drinking it everybody's

495
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,919
drinking it it's the largest crop in

496
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,080
produce there is right now in the world

497
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,320
the health food stores get deliveries

498
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,720
where it's just a truck of celery that's

499
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,120
never happened in our history it's just

500
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
really amazing how it works okay so we

501
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,919
got

502
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,919
we got some celery juice right there

503
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,720
we're also going to do some kale juice

504
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,240
too

505
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
so i'm going to run a little kale in

506
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,720
there now

507
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,280
so

508
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,679
we can actually do some kale now what i

509
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,600
recommend is you do celery juice by

510
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,000
itself in the morning on an empty

511
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,200
stomach you guys know 16 ounces 8 ounces

512
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,520
16 ounces try a minimum 16 ounces 32

513
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,919
ounces if you can every single morning

514
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,679
on an empty stomach to start cleaning up

515
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,280
the liver to start cleaning up the

516
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,640
organs to help kill off all the

517
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,799
pathogens that aren't supposed to be in

518
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,600
your intestinal tract the bad pathogens

519
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,480
right

520
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,840
you want to get rid of all that

521
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
so

522
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,600
i'm just running a little kale through

523
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
here

524
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,200
jenny tinkle boss says best juicer i've

525
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,280
ever used loved it aw

526
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,880
honored you're here

527
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,679
now what i'm doing is i'm running a

528
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,320
little bit of dinosaur kale through here

529
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,440
this would be an afternoon or at the end

530
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,080
of the day or evening drink right here

531
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,160
because you want the celery by itself in

532
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,280
the morning

533
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,960

just keep on going up in price in the

572
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,200
stores because that's going to happen in

573
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,280
about six months when you go to the

574
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,919
health food store in about six months

575
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,000

576
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,080

juices that are all pasteurized right

580
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,600
when you go

are right

586
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,919

588
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,480
actually saving money and you're doing

yeah it's medical medium clumsy

628
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,679
i think medical medium is clumsy

629
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,039
he's done this too many times

630
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,880
all right

631
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,520
that's the celery juice right there you

632
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,559
guys now like i said before i put kale

633
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,400
in there

634
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,080
and that's great because that's a kale

635
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,760
celery juice something you do in the

636
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,360
afternoon or at night or something like

637
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,360

638
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,919

639
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,520
for chronic illness but celery juice on

640
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,159
its own

641
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,320
is unmatched in the morning especially

642
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,640
when you do it in the morning that's the

643
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,799
point that's when it grabs on and goes

644
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,520
into the brain gets into your glial

645
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,400

ocd their bipolar their schizophrenia

650
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,640

651
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,840

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,360
paper that can prove it there's nothing

682
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,039
out there i'll tell you what kills your

683
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,640
kidneys and kills them fast high protein

684
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,320
high fat

685
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,039
you want to kill your kidneys high

686
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,400
protein high fat i'm talking vegan or

687
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,720
animal you can you can high protein your

688
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
kidneys to death as a vegan and a

689
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,720
plant-based person

690
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,760
you can high protein your kidneys to

691
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,400
death

692
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,159
as an animal protein person keto animal

693
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
protein whatever animal protein doesn't

694
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
matter what what brand what style

695
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,000
whatever

696
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,559
you can kill your kidneys with high

697
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,880
protein your kidneys get a viral

698
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,720
infection that starts the process off

699
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,240
and if anybody has a viral infection in

700
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,720
their kidneys nobody knows about for

701
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,320
years and years and years we end up

702
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,400
killing the kidney because the kidney

703
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,159
can't keep up with the viral infection

704
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,080
so we end up killing the kidneys with

705
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,000
high protein high fat that's how we

706
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,400
damage kidneys that's how we get kidney

707
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,559
stones we get the kidney stones from

708
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,159
high protein high fat destroying our

709
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,600
kidneys and then the other thing is

710
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,840
caffeining our kidneys to death high

711
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,799
caffeine caffeine consumption every

712
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,320
single day coffee that's how we kill our

713
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,200
kidneys and you know what i can

714
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,480

i wasn't in it

755
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,799
to just make peace

756
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,520
i wasn't in it

757
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,600

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,720
so i'll give you a close-up on the red

932
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,399
hot pepper right here so i got garlic

933
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,639
clove that's gonna go in here it's just

934
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,480
gonna go straight in the machine i got

935
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,639
oregano

936
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,639
you can do that i got sage

937
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,159
i even have something called garlic

938
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,320
chives i don't know if you guys ever had

939
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,960
a garlic chive right these are all fresh

940
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,960
herbs this is a fresh hummus fresh herbs

941
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,879
that's what i'm gonna do here so let's

942
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,200
start by putting in a few beans

943
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,280
now i'm making a fat free hummus but i

944
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,079
have these sesame seeds here now here's

945
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,280
the difference when you put sesame seeds

946
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,480
in your hummus through the machine

947
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:54,960
you're not getting a whole bunch like a

948
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,119
tablespoon of tahini oil sesame oil

949
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,359
this is it gives you the flavor of the

950
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,320
sesame if that's what you like it gives

951
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,079
you it doesn't it's not a blob of tahini

952
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,560
with all that added oil they put in the

953
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,000
tahini this is the best way to do it

954
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,200
that's why i call this like the medicine

955
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,200
maker because you're making the

956
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,520
healthiest version of the food you can

957
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,240
ever have or imagine

958
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,079
see i won't go out and buy a hummus out

959
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,079
there because they're all unhealthy for

960
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,440
a million reasons they got citric acid

961
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,920
in them they got additives you can't see

962
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,000
right they got carrageenan and they have

963
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,520
msg they have natural flavors in the

964
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,960
hummuses now so when you go buy hummus

965
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,720
there's all the stuff in there that you

966
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,160
shouldn't be eating and then they dump

967
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,520
all this canola oil in their hummus

968
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,280
and other stuff too like canola oil they

969
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,480
put too much olive oil in their hummus

970
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,079
they have too much tahini in their

971
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,960
hummus they have nutritional yeast in

972
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,320
their hummus nutritional yeast is msg

973
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,560
right they put citric acid which is corn

974
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,320
so that's what they i won't buy a hummus

975
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,440
if i walk by the hummus section in the

976
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,480
store

977
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,480
all i'm seeing is bad that that that's

978
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,560
not good i would never give that to my

979
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,480
kids that's a bad hummus right there

980
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,240
that's a vet look what's in this one and

981
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,200
you see it over and over and over again

982
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,880
right

983
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,760
and that's what i love about this it's

984
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,880
like you break away from that it's like

985
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,520
freedom

986
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,920
which is incredible so

987
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,720

lori says will my older version of the

1073
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,839
omega juicer do the same thing or the

1074
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,320
newest version mine is a year old this i

1075
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,320
don't know what which one you have lori

1076
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,040
you might have a different omega

1077
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,320
altogether the medical medium omegas are

1078
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,560
the mm-900 and the mm-1500

1079
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,480
and nothing does what this does

1080
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,880
this is the mm-1500 it's the full

1081
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,640
nutritional system you make the ice

1082
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,400
cream you make salsas you make hummus

1083
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,160

when you think about how little that is

1089
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,640
with those sesame seeds like that but

1090
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,720

1092
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,680

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,800
tomatoes so let me pop this on on here

1161
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,599
for a second

1162
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,599
you guys can take a look

1163
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,599
so what i like i mean i like eating it

1164
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,680
in so many different ways now this is

1165
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,200
something you probably won't like but

1166
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,520
hey it's just me

1167
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,119
i like putting it on the end of an onion

1168
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,960
so good

1169
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,560
you can do cucumber

1170
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,560
dip your cucumber into it right

1171
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,040
so good as well there we go

1172
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,800
that's a really amazing one

1173
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,960
i'm going to make a black bean one real

1174
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,960
quick

1175
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,400
so you guys you can do a cracker i'll do

1176
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,800
that with the black bean one okay

1177
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,800
all right

1178
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,040
really really good stuff right

1179
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,839
so let's go with the black bean

1180
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,040
and if you want to use a different bean

1181
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,880
and that's what you want to do for your

1182
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,160
hummus like sprouted lentil is something

1183
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,240
that i'm going to make one time with

1184
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,480
this

1185
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,640
austin says never thought to put the

1186
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,680
herbs in it it looks so good it's so

1187
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,880
good

1188
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,920
so fresh so amazing low fat which is

1189
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,839
incredible right there right

1190
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,640
so what i'm doing is i'm drop dropping

1191
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,160
in some black beans

1192
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,079
there you guys

1193
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,560
a little bit of leftover chickpea hummus

1194
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,599
is coming out

1195
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,599
but who's complaining

1196
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,680
there we go

1197
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,280
okay

1198
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,319
you can you don't even have to do the

1199
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,119
sesame seeds you don't have to

1200
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,720
i'm just doing it

1201
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,720
right little flavor going in there

1202
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,839
so this is the black bean one right here

1203
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,599
and do your fresh herbs in the black

1204
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,599
bean one too at the same time

1205
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,359
i don't like using blenders for hummus

1206
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,400
ever since the mm 1500 i won't use a

1207
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,599
blender

1208
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,680
for hummus

1209
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,839
i won't sit there you know with that

1210
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,000
it's just it's not it's not the same

1211
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,000
experience there's so many reasons i

1212
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,480
don't like using the food processor with

1213
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,480
it either

1214
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,920
it's really not a fun experience

1215
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,599
i love doing it this way i'm going to

1216
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,599
put some garlic chives in here

1217
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,920
the flavor in here is insane

1218
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,000
it's much smoother with this that's why

1219
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,520
you can't get it any smoother than this

1220
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,520
some rosemary going in there

1221
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,200
it's so smooth

1222
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,920
right and there you don't have to use

1223
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,040
the oil

1224
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,040
and that's the thing when you do the

1225
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,440
blenders you gotta put that's what they

1226
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,280
do they put all that oil in there that

1227
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,280
nutritional yeast

1228
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,520
you don't have to do any fat in here

1229
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,520
whatsoever fat free so you're protecting

1230
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,119
your liver

1231
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,440
which is so good

1232
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,760
your liver doesn't like fats so you got

1233
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,839
to be careful yeah you know sure you can

1234
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,000
do some healthy avocado some healthy

1235
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,680
hemp seeds some

1236
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,680
sesame seeds some pumpkin seeds

1237
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,280
sunflower seeds right

1238
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,000
it's fine because you can make nut milks

1239
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,520
in here you can do nut butters in here

1240
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,520
with this machine which is incredible

1241
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,960
that hot pepper got me before you guys

1242
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,560
i'm gonna throw another one in here

1243
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,160
this is a super chilly dropping that

1244
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,480
super chilly in here

1245
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,760
but the point is you can do low fat too

1246
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,760
really give your liver a break

1247
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,359
when you need to give it a you know a

1248
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,280
break once in a while

1249
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,680
there's still there's still fat and

1250
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,680
beans

1251
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,440
i always do it to myself with those hot

1252
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,760
peppers

1253
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,680
i'm gonna put a few more sesame seeds in

1254
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,359
there big difference with just putting

1255
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,280
the sesame seeds in there like that

1256
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:02,079
versus sesame oil

1257
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,200
right and all that tahini

1258
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,200
really big difference

1259
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,119
so this black bean hummus

1260
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,440
is like a

1261
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,960
friend and family's favorite over here

1262
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,960
at the aw

1263
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,000
household i'm gonna put a little bit

1264
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,000
more oregano

1265
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,960
in here

1266
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,520
there we go

1267
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,839
all right looking good

1268
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,000
i'll drop a few more in here

1269
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,240
and you see aw what causes extreme

1270
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,599
drowsiness right after eating food i

1271
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,920
noticed that drinking coconut water

1272
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,500
helps to relieve the drowsiness and dc

1273
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,480
that's neurological

1274
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,920
[Music]

1275
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,520
that central nervous system

1276
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,079
right i was telling a doctor the other

1277
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,680
day when people get really tired when

1278
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,520
they're eating food

1279
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,079
their nervous system

1280
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,720
is not getting the full energy it needs

1281
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,880
because it's going to all your digestion

1282
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,800
so your all your reserves go to your

1283
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,720
digestion versus your central nervous

1284
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,720
system so then you get tired right

1285
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,960
that's your central nervous system a lot

1286
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,680
of people it everybody's different if

1287
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,119
you have health issues sometimes it it

1288
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,119
only takes a little bit of food and you

1289
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,880
feel tired because you have you know

1290
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,240
neurological issues right but then

1291
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,079
there's somebody that doesn't have any

1292
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,760
neurological issues yet they can eat a

1293
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,599
whole turkey dinner and they only get

1294
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,079
tired when it's thanksgiving when they

1295
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,839
eat a gigantic turkey dinner and they're

1296
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,440
in insulin resistance and they're

1297
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,280
falling asleep on the couch and they're

1298
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,520
like what can i have another turkey

1299
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,720
drumstick what you know they're falling

1300
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,640
asleep on the couch right

1301
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,400
so this is a black bean hummus right

1302
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,000
here

1303
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,400
i'm gonna put a little bit of lemon in

1304
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,920
there as well

1305
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,480
cold white spring says it depends what

1306
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,800
you are eating too right true may you

1307
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,720
you are so right if you get tired

1308
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,920
absolutely

1309
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,920
that plays a role too

1310
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,240
and if you have nervous systems symptoms

1311
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,640
of any kind

1312
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,640
right and you eat food that's much

1313
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,960
harder on the system

1314
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,559
then you're really going to feel it

1315
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,319
if you have nervous system issues and

1316
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,000
you eat food that's really good and

1317
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,160
healthy still might feel it because you

1318
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,319
have nervous system talk about way less

1319
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,319
right

1320
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,160
because all your reserves they go to

1321
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,760
your digestion and then your nerves are

1322
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,839
like whoa we gotta wait a little while

1323
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,520
until things start leveling out all

1324
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:27,240
right so i just mixed this hummus up i'm

1325
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,240
gonna put it in a little bowl

1326
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:36,079
i could actually put it right here too

1327
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,079
just a little black bean hummus

1328
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,880
so i'm gonna put a little bit next to

1329
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,040
this hummus right here so you got like

1330
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,040
one side you got the black bean

1331
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,640
the other side you have the chickpea

1332
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,119
right

1333
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,119
there you go

1334
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,240
and then you got like these crackers

1335
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,920
right here

1336
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,760
try them all out with a little brown

1337
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,839
