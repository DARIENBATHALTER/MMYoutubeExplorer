it have you noticed have you noticed the

102
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,599
new

103
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,680
war I mean they're armed with demons the

104
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,160
goal is to take down the vegan movement

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,320
have you seen it and so what happened

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,800
was as the in the last few years as the

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,720
carnivore world started to rise up they

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,639
got crafted

109
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,360
so the meat eater guys the dudes that

110
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,759
started hitting social right they

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,000
started hitting social and they're like

112
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,199
you know what we're going to take down

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,759
that vegan crap we're going to take down

114
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,560
veganism we're going to take down the

115
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,639
plant-based movement and we're going to

116
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,240
search to chip away at the Men start you

117
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:54,440
know calling them weak calling them

118
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,759
frail you know calling them feminized

119
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,000
that's one of the things that happened

120
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,160
so it was an incredible technique in war

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,759
and so the

122
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,000
the the animal-based movement the new

123
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,240
animal based movement which is basically

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,400
Atkins but then turned into something a

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,120
little different we're going to go into

126
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,360
that in detail too basically it's the

127
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,080
Akin

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,000
diet without some of the garbage in some

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,000
of the junk and then it's rangle and

130
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,400
repackaged into it's like the Atkins

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,680
movement the paleo diet movement both

132
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,400
ref

133
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:36,160
finagled reclaimed and turned into this

134
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:40,479
new version this mutation of carnivore

135
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,400
and keto and then dudes rose out of it

136
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,520
on social that's what happened they rose

137
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,720
out of it ready to slay and that's

138
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,160
really what happened and they're like

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,479
we're going to slay those vegans and

140
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,840
those plant-based people and we're going

141
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,240
to use all kinds of techniques we're

142
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,639
going to tell women that they can't be

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,319
fertile without meat that's the first

144
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,840
thing so all these women that were

145
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,039
plant-based and vegan and went there

146
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,520
because they weren't feeling well and

147
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,240
they weren't feeling sick decided like

148
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,160
wait a minute here I'm not going to be

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,680
fertile infertility is going to happen

150
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm seeing dudes that are looking pretty

151
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,560
good on social they're talking about hey

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,599
if I stay vegan If I Stay plant-based if

153
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,919
I'm not eating meat I'm not going to

154
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,080
keep my hormones balanced I'm going to

155
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,919
have fertility issues I'm not going to

156
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,160
be able to have a baby when I meet the

157
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,479
right guy

158
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
you know something like that so what's

159
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,840
happening and basically that's what it

160
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,120
is that's what's happening out there

161
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,240
basically so a lot of women were falling

162
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,840
from Grace vegans were falling from

163
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,080
Grace so they would do all their posts

164
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,880
and all their social media posts and

165
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,280
they would say hey they would start out

166
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,680
like look you know my symptoms are kind

167
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,759
of coming back I've been you know vegan

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,919
eggs and you're eating meat and that's

183
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,160
what I should do and then the protein

184
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:32,440
scare the reinvention of the protein

185
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,680
scare developed where once again all

186
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,759
these dudes rising up on social all

187
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,440
trying to say Hey you know like let's

188
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,800
take out the vegans let's take out the

189
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,840
plant-based people let's hit them with

190
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,199
the protein fears again let's feed that

191
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,599
back on people amino acids proteins

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,560
let's feed all of that back on people

193
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,560
and then things like choline choline

194
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,360
choline you need choline you're not

195
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,599
going to get that you need the right

196
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,840
vitamins you need iron right back to

197
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:04,280
those old f years that our grandmothers

198
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,199
had right that are grandmothers had back

199
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,280
to some of those like iron right that

200
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,599
one too now you need to be eating liver

201
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,759
now you need to be eating beef organs

202
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,080
now you need to be eating hearts and

203
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,440
that's what you should be doing so this

204
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,599
movement's growing and growing and it

205
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,280
it's been the last four years but

206
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,360
getting a little heavier and a little

207
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,639
heavier and so the vegans and the

208
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,520
plant-based people have been dropping

209
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,000
like flies mostly the women just

210
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,800
dropping like flies

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,519
getting scared because they don't

212
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,880
understand their symptoms and they're

213
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,279
just getting the minute a vegan person

214
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,760
or a plant-based person gets a symptom

215
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,800
boom they're like now they're doubting

216
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,279
everything they're doubting the

217
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,200
plant-based thing and then they hear

218
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,600
dudes that are working out in the gym

219
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,640
and training and they're on social and

220
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,880
they're sitting there and they're

221
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,920
ripping apart soy boys and stuff and

222
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,080
they're making you know women feel like

223
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,920
their men are weak and fragile and just

224
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,839
they're soy boys and they're feminine in

225
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,800
and then they get told it's all out

226
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,279
there that if you're plant-based as a

227
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,519
dude you're feminized and so that's

228
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,399
another thing too so a whole massive

229
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,279
campaign of bullying has been coming

230
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,760
down on the vegans and the plant-based

231
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,240
people right so I don't know if you guys

232
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,440
have seen it but it's been happening so

233
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,320
all the dudes are being they're all

234
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,800
called soy boys now right they're all

235
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,959
feminized and so a lot of women are like

236
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,519
wait a minute I'm not going to get

237
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,360
fertile I'm going to have infertility my

238
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,760
dude is you know he's feminized my

239
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,959
dude's a soy boy this doesn't look good

240
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,399
I got you know so what's happening is

241
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,160
this war has been really really smart in

242
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,200
a lot of ways to take down the vegan and

243
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,680
plant-based movement and it did I'm

244
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,560
sorry but it did it pretty much

245
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,680
slaughtered it okay I I believe from

246
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,720
what I can see and tell and information

247
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,720
that I get above and all in the above

248
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,959
that the vegan movement was

249
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,760
bigger at at a around

250
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,640
pre-2000 than it is today right now the

251
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,519
plant-based movement and the vegan

252
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,600
movement was bigger a little bit pre

253
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,519
2000 than it is right now so this is

254
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,240
something to think about okay now if you

255
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,079
just got on here you're thinking wait a

256
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,680
minute wait a minute how you know how

257
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,839
does this work medical M information

258
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,040
medical M information is not against

259
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,279
plant-based it's not against veganism

260
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,160
it's not against animal protein it's not

261
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,560
against people that want to keto or

262
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,880
whatever they want to eat animal

263
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,800
products instead it's these powerful

264
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,680
tools that you can incorporate and then

265
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,320
you can learn what to avoid as a

266
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,519
plant-based person as a vegan person as

267
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,440
an animal person as a keto person

268
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,440
whatever it is things you can avoid so

269
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,720
you can take your healing to the next

270
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,800
level that's what medical medium

271
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,000
information always was and people used

272
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,000
to ask me all the time plant-based

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
doctors used to reach out to me some

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,560
I've known some I didn't know and would

275
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,360
say are you a plant-based book or not I

276
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,000
saw your book in the bookstore it wasn't

277
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,519
with all the plantbased people what is

278
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,720
going on aw what are you and what are

279
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,079
you not I'm like why does it have to be

280
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,279
that way my books are fill the tools you

281
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:22,560
can apply for both right there for both

282
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,000
meat animal you know plant-based the

283
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,240
whole bit and so there's always been two

284
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,399
sides of the aisle two sides of the

285
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,279
aisle you guys know this right you're

286
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,920
either plant if you want to call it

287
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,800
veganism because you're you don't want

288
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,480
to wear leather shoes and you don't want

289
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,360
to eat honey it's either plant and vegan

290
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,000
or animal and that animal can be in any

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,200
form Atkins

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,720
paleo um keto uh carnivore whatever it's

293
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,600
either plant-based vegan or animal those

294
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,000
are the two sides of the aisle that's

295
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,240
how the game's been played but in the

296
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,440
last few

297
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,399
years the vegans and the plant-base have

298
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,839
been

299
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,639
slaughtered slaughtered they have the

300
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,920
amount of animal protein doctors coming

301
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,839
out of the woodwork going on social

302
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,800
waging you know War campaigns the amount

303
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,880
of the amount of influencers that are

304
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,040
dudes that are just worried about their

305
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,800
masculinity and just you know trying to

306
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,519
say you got to eat meat and you know and

307
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,600
and the dudes that are plant-based are

308
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,320
just weak and you know frail and they're

309
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,040
thin and and all this stuff and so

310
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,920
they've really done a number and then

311
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,880
you know that wasn't totally enough to

312
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,880
push women out of veganism to push women

313
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,959
out of plant-base the key was you're not

314
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,560
going to be fertile your reproductive

315
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,000
system is going to dry up you're going

316
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,160
to have infertility if you're

317
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,639
plant-based you're not going to be able

318
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,399
to have a baby that was the kicker right

319
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,720
there your hormones aren't going to be

320
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:01,519
balanced properly balanced that was the

321
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,760
nail in the coffin right there so the

322
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,199
Meat Heads okay they did a good one with

323
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,639
that one and the soy boys they're kind

324
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,240
of like stuck because they don't know

325
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,839
the difference they don't know what's

326
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,480
right or wrong the soy boys they don't

327
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,240
know they don't know really what you

328
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,880
have to do to keep yourself healthy

329
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,519
they're just staying away from animal

330
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,040
right they don't know okay and then the

331
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,240
Meat Heads they like they put the nail

332
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,880
in the coffin on that one they just

333
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,399
hammered it in they they did it and they

334
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,800
did a good job they slammed that one

335
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,360
down everybody's throat and they were

336
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,639
like this is what's going to happen to

337
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,240
you you're a girl you want to be

338
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,160
plant-based that's not going to work for

339
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,720
you you're not going to be fertile

340
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,399
you're going to have infertility and

341
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,880
everybody went running and screaming for

342
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:53,160
the most part they pretty much won the

343
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:56,720
war just going to say right there pretty

344
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,560
much won the war now let's go into it a

345
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,440
little bit now some other stuff about it

346
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,360

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,759
uh are you guys with me so far we're

348
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,880

349
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,240
amazing here crispy perspective Meat

350
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,639
Heads versus soy boys laugh out loud

351
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,160
that's what it is it's Meat Heads versus

352
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,839
soy boys and the soy boys don't really

353
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,440
know how to defend themselves and I'll

354
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,240
tell you why so get this this is really

355
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,800
an important part right

356
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,560
here they don't know how to defend

357
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,480
themselves because they don't know

358
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,399
medical medium information they don't

359
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,759
know why people are sick so when the

360
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,079
Meat Heads who get sick who get sick the

361
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,000
Meat Heads say to the soy

362
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:40,759
boys okay you're not going to get your

363
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,920
protein you're going to get sick you're

364
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,399
going to have this problem that person

365
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,800
problem your women aren't going to be

366
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,120
able to have babies when they do that

367
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,360
the soy boys they can't defend

368
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,759
themselves because they don't know

369
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,279
medical medium information they don't

370
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,160
know about the mineral salts they don't

371
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,320
know about the glucose they don't know

372
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,000
about how you can be keto and do it all

373
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,800
wrong you can be animal and do it all

374
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,759
wrong they don't know that vegan isn't

375
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,079
just vegan and period black and white

376
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,720
they don't know that plant-based is just

377
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:13,720
plant-based period in black and white

378
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,079
they don't know that so anybody who's

379
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,160
adopted different plant-based diets or

380
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,240
or vegan diets they did it high fat and

381
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,519
then the women that got on plant-based

382
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,600
did it high fat and when they did at

383
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
high fat they did not get rid of their

384
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,639
symptoms maybe they did for the first

385
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,120
few months and things were going along

386
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,360
or the first year and then it all fell

387
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,680
apart and that's a big deal all on its

388
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,120
own so I'm just turning this down a

389
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,800
little

390
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:44,959
bit the plant-based movement did not did

391
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:48,759
not learn the medical medium information

392
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:52,199
to save itself and now it's going

393
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:55,600
down it did not learn the information it

394
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:59,079
needed to learn to go into war with the

395
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,959
Meat Heads it did not learn this and for

396
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:05,480
that reason it's going down it is I

397
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,040
remember specifically four or five years

398
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,720
ago I was doing an Instagram live one of

399
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,040
those lives or something like that and

400
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,079
somebody came on there just like you

401
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,600
don't know it was it was it was some

402
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,440
plant-based people I think it was two

403
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,839
plant-based women or three there was

404
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,800
like one plant-based woman and then her

405
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,920
friend came on there too and they're

406
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,000
like you don't know what's going on out

407
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,399
there you don't understand this and that

408
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,399
and this and and all that I can

409
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,319
guarantee you right now they're not

410
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,279
plant-based anymore I can guarantee you

411
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:37,199
they've been switched over to animal

412
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,880
protein like probably a year after that

413
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,639
they got a symptom their symptom didn't

414
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,880
go away the Meat Heads came up told them

415
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:47,920
they weren't going to be fertile gone

416
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,839
boom gone they got eaten up because the

417
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,040
vegan movement and the plant-based

418
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,920
movement did not understand medical

419
00:16:52,040 --> 00:17:00,279
medium information and did not learn it

420
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:03,440
they drowned themselves in fats

421
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,919
they got they got the natural flavorings

422
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,439
in the way the MSG in the way and didn't

423
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,559
know it kept them sick they got the

424
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,199
citric acid in the way they kept the

425
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,640
apple cider vinegar sure they were

426
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,319
plant-based but they kept the apple

427
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,480
cider vinegar and they kept the fake

428
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,319
cheeses the fake cheeses and they got

429
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,520
eaten up Alive by the animal kingdom

430
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,120
people they've eaten them up alive buy

431
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,000
shootout spit out the vegan movement's

432
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,360
pretty much dead gone bottom line get

433
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,720
this now here's another thing very

434
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,000
interesting okay somebody can go vegan

435
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,320
because they're worried about animal

436
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,280
rights they're worried about animals

437
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,559
they're worried about animals being hurt

438
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,360
animals being killed we know that

439
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,480
animals have souls yes but what people

440
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,280
don't realize is the minute their

441
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,039
symptoms came on that wasn't enough to

442
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,559
keep them in the game there's very few

443
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:59,480
women left in the vegan movement that

444
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,240
were worried about animals and leather

445
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,400
and worried about animal torture they

446
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,840
got symptoms wor heard some heard a meat

447
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,559
head talk about infertility and they're

448
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,600
gone boom gone didn't matter at all

449
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,559
about animals being hacked to death and

450
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,840
killed it didn't matter about cows being

451
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,440
knocked in the head pigs going into Pig

452
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,679
machines and all coming out ground up it

453
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,600
didn't matter

454
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,880
anymore yeah they got into veganism

455
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,400
became a vegan they did they didn't want

456
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,000
they all got vegan

457
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,400
shoes definitely and vegan sandals and

458
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,760
vegan high heels and whatever shoes that

459
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:42,559
they want vegan sneakers vegan whatever

460
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,840
the vegan boots they got all those okay

461
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,799
they they they were vegan for a while

462
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,200
and then they got their first or second

463
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,640
symptom again or they got symptoms for

464
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,120
the first time in their life because

465
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,039
they they went vegan because they were

466
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,600
worried about animal cruelty and animals

467
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:59,039
and all that stuff and then they got

468
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,320
their first symptoms and then their

469
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,480
doctors like you're not getting enough

470
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,320
protein or they go on social and they

471
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,960
see a doctor now on Social cuz what

472
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,559
happened was social media did not have

473
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,480
hardly any doctors on social media

474
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:15,039
hardly any were on social media years

475
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,280
ago they were just in practice they were

476
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,120
practicing and then the birth of the

477
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,200
social media doctor who doesn't practice

478
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,760
so it's the birth now of the social

479
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,919
media doctor who does not practice and

480
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,400
does not know their patients pain and

481
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,200
suffering who doesn't know really how to

482
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,840
heal their patient who's dealing with

483
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,320
pain and suffering they became a doctor

484
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,320
didn't want to do it it was too nasty

485
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,240
and dirty work they didn't want to

486
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,200
communicate with people one-on-one in

487
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,400
the office they couldn't stand people

488
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,280
sitting there complaining to them about

489
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,559
how they're sick and how this medication

490
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,280
didn't help or how this herb didn't help

491
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,559
that was in this mixture of stuff with

492
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,000
probiotics and they left they didn't

493
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,520
really get into it and they left so

494
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,760
there's a birthing of doctors that never

495
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,159
practiced they're not seasoned doctors

496
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,919
They Don't Know Jack they don't know

497
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,679
squat and they're out there on social

498
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,559
media screaming away and screaming away

499
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,120
and and and getting all kinds of bits

500
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,000
and pieces of information that's not

501
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,039
even from scientific studies and so

502
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,720
forth right also poaching and stealing

503
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,080
medical medium information along the way

504
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,960

505
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,280
way get rid of medals do it this way

506
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,799

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,799
went to regular medical school didn't

508
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,720
want to practice anymore got interested

509
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,880
in health now they're on social media

510
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,000
it's a group of them too that took down

511
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,440
the vegan movement that did a great

512
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,520
job it's a group of those doctors that

513
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:41,240
destroyed the vegan movement destroyed

514
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,720

and plant-based that's not it at all it

518
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,200
doesn't matter to me if you want to heal

519
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,919
plant-based you can do it through

520
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,480
medical meme information you do the 369

521
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,760
you do it you push through if you want

522
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,039
to heal doing animal learn how to do it

523
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,480
learn how to do it right with the animal

524
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,120
stuff and you can do it and you can push

525
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,760
through and you can heal I never took a

526
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,600
side of the aisle do you guys know this

527
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,360

528
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,480
right you guys must know this hey so

529
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,080
when I turned plant-base there were many

530
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,400
vegan people with symptoms on social

531
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,039
social and vegan influencers did not

532
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,120
have answers they would always say you

533
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,200
are either detoxing or not do it right

534
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,600
and that buried them it did it did it

535
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,039
did they didn't want to know medical

536
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,880
medium information the vegan movement

537
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,000
the social the social media vegan

538
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,320
movement they didn't understand medical

539
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,279
medium information maybe they understood

540
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,640
some tidbits they were even adverse to

541
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,840
celery juice didn't even want to do

542
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,080
celery juice or they did it privately

543
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,559
secretly but that's all they did they

544
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:57,039
did not want to learn how to heal while

545
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,320

573
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,840
ones right

575
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,440
very first ones it went from those very

576
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:11,559
first ones to the second ones and then

577
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
it went to the third ones what I mean by

578
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,600
that is then then all of a sudden

579
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,200
another Army of young women coming out

580
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,480
of the plant-based vegan movement would

581
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,360
be like I'm not getting enough protein

582
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,400

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,520
structures are wrong I went to this

584
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,720
doctor I saw a guy on social media you

585
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,120
should follow him too and it went to the

586
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,880
next level went to the next level

587
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,760
so and it's just next level and Next

588
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,559
Level and where were the dudes where

589
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,720
were the vegan dudes if you looked at

590
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,880
the soy

591
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,240
boys wherever they were whoever they are

592
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,760
if you looked at the vegan dudes they

593
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,480
didn't know how to stand up for

594
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,880
themselves they didn't know how to how

595
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,720
to fix things they didn't know how to

596
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,480
get women to be like wait a minute no

597
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,799
wait a minute something's wrong here it

598
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,360
something's wrong here right they didn't

599
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,640
know how to stand up for the plant-based

600
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,919
movement and It Came Crashing Down

601
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,840
crashing down and the trainers and the

602
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,039
weightlifters and the buff dudes and

603
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,200
that they got they even have credentials

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,640
some of them are like nutritionist PS pH

605
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,559
PhD MD chiropractor and they're coming

606
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,320
up and they're just like in the gym and

607
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,679
they're like you need your protein girls

608
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,799

your hormones balanced you need meat

612
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,720
meat's got B6 be this be this like

613
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,840
they're doing this and then women are

614
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:41,679
just like totally mind totally mind like

615
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,520
totally and so the vegan movement Came

616
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,200
Crashing Down it's a ghost of what it

617
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:51,120
was it's a fraction of what it was and

618
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,320
it's going down fast I'm talking to a

619
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,720
complete burn unless you're doing

620
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,399
medical medium information and you learn

621
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,640
how to heal and you understand how to do

622
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:03,440
plant-base properly for your body and

623
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,799
what you need as you're healing same

624
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,399
thing if you're a me eat or two whatever

625
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,080
in the whole bit Alissa says over there

626
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:10,799
on YouTube it's so funny hearing you

627
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,840
talk about this because I've seen this

628
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,240
all happen I was following those

629
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,600
influencers it's crazy there's a war on

630
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,880
I hinted about the war six seven years

631
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,080
ago in the books I hinted about the war

632
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,000
five years ago I hinted about the war

633
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,880
four years ago hinted about it and

634
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,720
talked about it 3 years ago and then it

635
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,919
took over over and that's it people are

636
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,640
clobbered clobbered and there's Carnage

637
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:40,760
Carnage from

638
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,279
it and The Spoils of War and how how

639
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:47,480
much pork

640
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:51,320
fat money was made on the flip side how

641
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:55,399
much money was made from the influencers

642
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,440
pushing meat believe it or not I mean

643
00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:01,240
they slaughtered the plant-based

644
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,279
movement basically now here's what's

645
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,919
happened and I talked about the mistakes

646
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,559
the carore movement made where I told

647
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,080
you about that you want to watch the

648
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,679
last live I did you to hear

649
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,480
that but now we have basically the

650
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,440
Atkins diet refled into a keto diet the

651
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,120
keto diet is really some medical medium

652
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,679
tools mixed in with meat that's what

653
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,640
they did they were so smart that they

654
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,240
learned how to poach medical medium

655
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,360
information so the meat eaters and the

656
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,559
Meat Heads in industry the influencers

657
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,440
they learned how to poach key things for

658
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,120
medical medium information stay away

659
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,720

themselves sick they stayed sick and

680
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,720
then the animal protein movement the new

681
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,520
one I'm talking about the dudes were

682
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,039
smart they were listening to Medical

683
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,760
medium podcasts how do I know a podcast

684
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,799
would come out and two to three of the

685
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,320
meat head influencers would be saying

686
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:49,080
the same thing that was in the podcast

687
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,080
word for word like

688
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,039
plagiarizing so they were listening to

689
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,760
Medical medium information they were

690
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,039
listening to the podcast they were

691
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,440
looking through the books and they saw

692
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,679
stay away from nutrition East and they

693
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:07,360
saw stay away from corn it's all all GMO

694
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:10,679
and they saw stay away from soy it's all

695
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,240
GMO and they used it and poached it they

696
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,240
added it to their fancy keto diet and

697
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,919
they crushed the plant-based movement

698
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,000
because the plant-based people they

699
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,480
didn't want to know enough about medical

700
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,600
medium information to keep them afloat

701
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,720
to keep them safe to keep them able to

702
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:32,919
do it it's Carnage it's Spoils of War

703
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:36,200
it happened the war on veganism and how

704
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,080
smart the Meat Heads were to be able to

705
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,559
collaberate and even take medical medium

706
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,120
information and do

707
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:45,640
so they're so smart they started

708
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,360
screaming no natural flavors no MSG no

709
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,720
natural flavors no MSG they got it from

710
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,799
medical medium information but they got

711
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,519
it and they

712
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,840
robed the plant-based movement do you

713
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,840
guys understand what happened

714
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,960
it's

715
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:07,840
unbelievable I don't disrespect you know

716
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,600
anybody and I have respect for everybody

717
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,559
I even have respect for these idiots

718
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,760
that did that to the plant-based

719
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:20,440
movement because they were they were

720
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,960
thinking at least evil evil but thinking

721
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,679
they were thinking let's steal this from

722
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,840
mm let's use it against a plant-based

723
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,600
movement plant-based movement's not like

724
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,000
let's take this from mm no they're just

725
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,760
like oh guys's a

726
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,640

728
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,919
sorcerer oh you're going to hell you

729
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,600
know what I mean so what happened was a

730
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,600
plant-based movement if you believe in

731
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,200
karma if that's what you believe they

732
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:59,240
got

733
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:01,919
Karma they did slammed slammed

734
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:06,000
the Meat Heads let's see an IG love the

735
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:09,200
beach the Meat Heads versus the soy boys

736
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,200
the new Westside

737
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:21,120
Story okay IG you're absolutely right

738
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,799
many people who are vegan convert it to

739
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:29,960
meat and eggs again not just many almost

740
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:33,200
all of them thanks uh thanks vegan

741
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,120
snia very important to know so why does

742
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,519
this

743
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,919
matter I think it's

744
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,640
important I think it's important because

745
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,399
a couple of things that are critical

746
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,840
when it comes down to chronic

747
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,120
illness you have to know what caused it

748
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,679
you have to know what caused it I'll see

749
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,440
it 10 times in a row and you can say aw

750
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,320
is repeating himself you have to know

751
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,720
what caused it then you have to know

752
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,440
what to do for it it's not about what

753
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,000
side of the aisle you're on you want to

754
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,880
be plant-based damn it you stay

755
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,679
plant-based that's what you do you stay

756
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:09,600
plant-based I support plant-based that's

757
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:12,519
right I do I do big time and you

758
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,000
actually can heal and get down to the

759
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:18,360
nitty gritty inside and you can help

760
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,960
detoxify you can help restore your

761
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,440
immune system and do it plant-based but

762
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,840
you got to do it right and you got to

763
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,440
customize it right to yourself and you

764
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,320
can't get thrown off and what happened

765
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,600
was the vegan movement was just a whole

766
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,080
bunch of people people all t one big

767
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,679
tumble weed of people and they didn't

768
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,600
know the medical medium

769
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,880
information they were just eating

770
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,559
whatever and eating vegan Donuts vegan

771
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,159

772
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,320
cheese vegan that vegan this vegan

00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:50,600
sausages and you know what's really

774
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,960
sad is the fake processed Meats in the

775
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,440
vegetarian movement so that was thrown

776
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,279
on the vegans this was a really

777
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,279
brilliant move right here so the Meat

778
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,559
Heads the ones with now like they're

779
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,639
flashing whatever nutritionist degree

780
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,320
they have they're in the gym they're

781
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:07,600
talking about how you need this amino

782
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,159
acid they're talking about how you know

783
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,600
soy kills right and they're talking

784
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,120
about all these

785
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,559
things and they and it's information

786
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,880
they gleaned from medical medium really

787
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,120
smart how they poached some good pieces

788
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,480
really good pieces that they could have

789
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,120
used that they could use that they did

790
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,480
but the plant-based movement could have

791
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,440
used those tools and they didn't they

792
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,720
didn't what was wrong with

793
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,120
them they didn't they didn't take the mm

794
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,559
info and use the tools to battle the

795
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,760
Meat Heads who have taken them

796
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:44,919
down but let's go into the fake

797
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,679
processed meat game

798
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:50,760
whoa whoa what a great tool the

799
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,519
influencers that are doing the keto and

800
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,559
the meat and the carnivore whatever you

801
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:57,080
want to you know chalk it all up into

802
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,080
one big ball those meet either influen

803
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,799
your trainer weightlifter dudes that are

804
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,760
all into that those dudes they figured

805
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:10,039
something else out they figured out that

806
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,559
they can rank on the processed fake

807
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:16,279
meats that vegans get blamed for what a

808
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:19,000
win what a win because in those fake

809
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,360
processed meats you got all kinds of MSG

810
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,799
you got gluten you got everything bad in

811
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,080
that stuff chemicals everything Galore

812
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:28,720

screaming you're the fake process meat

814
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,880
people and you're doing soy and you're

815
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,960
doing this and you're doing that it's an

816
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,840
incredible weapon they use and here's

817
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,559
the stupid part those guys don't even

818
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,679
realize it those influencers that are

819
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,279
using that weapon against the

820
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,399
plant-based movement don't even realize

821
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,039
something that wasn't the vegan movement

822
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,240
that created all those fake processed

823
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:53,720
meats that vegans tend to Love

824
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,760
sometimes it wasn't that those fake

825
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,000
processed Meats with all that [ __ ] in

826
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,679

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,320
vegetarians gone there might be a few

831
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,879
lingering around and there might be a

832
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,280
few in the medical M community that say

833
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:14,599
they're vegetarians and see themselves

834
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,079
as that but they're mostly all gone the

835
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:20,720
fake processed Meats were created for

836
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:24,960
the vegetarians in the 60s the 70s the

837
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,879

838
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:32,200

vegetarian the vegetarian that buried

847
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,200
everything in nutritional yeast ate a

848
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,200
pile of beans with cheese on it d cow

849
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,000
cheese on it the

850
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:06,079
vegetarian the vegetarian that ate lots

851
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,480
of eggs in the morning and then wanted

852
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,079
some fake

853
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,920
sausage so the industry the food

854
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:16,880
industry created for vegetarians and the

855
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,280
vegetarian movement fake processed Meats

856
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,400
they weren't even for the vegans and the

857
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,720
plant-based people sure I'm sure a vegan

858
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,560
that wanted to become vegan or a person

859
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,760
that became vegan went and bought one of

860
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,320
those turkeys that was actually

861
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,280
processed meat with MSG and gluten but

862
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,160
the point is it was created for the

863
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,240
vegetarians so the Meat Heads

864
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,839
influencers trainers PhD guys whatever

865
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,720
you want to call them that have crushed

866
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:43,119
the vegan movement saying that all their

867
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,000
women are going to be infertile and all

868
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,160
it takes is one woman who's vegan or

869
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,440
plant-based one woman who's vegan or

870
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,960
plant-based who can't have a baby and

871
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,800
they're going to be convinced it's

872
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,240
because those Meat Heads are right and

873
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,359
those influencers are right it's going

874
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,160
to they're going to be convinced that

875
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,880
they totally went down the wrong track

876
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,200
being plant-based and they're not going

877
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,599
to have a baby now and that these dudes

878
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,319
know better out there that are on social

879
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,880
screaming away on how all their women

880
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:10,720
are going to go infertile and I'm going

881
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,359
to tell you what a weapon that was that

882
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,960
was brilliant brilliant for their side

883
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:16,960
to win the

884
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,240
war you just got on the live you got to

885
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,880
rewatch it from the beginning every

886
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:27,319
single word is

887
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,319
important once it's posted

888
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,880
processed fake Meats with all the gluten

889
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,240
and all the MSG and all the garbage in

890
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,839
it and everything else you guys the

891
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,440
processed fake Meats were for the

892
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:38,319
vegetarians not for the vegans the

893
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,119
vegans were never supposed to eat it

894
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:42,720
they was never created for them it was

895
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:44,760
created for the vegetarian and what

896
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,440
happened was these influencers these

897
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,640
Meatheads these keto these carnivore

898
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,720
influencers and and and everything above

899
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,480
including their doctor friends and PhD

900
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,400
friends and everything else what they

901
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,760
did was they pulled a real good fast one

902
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,359
on those vegans and what they did was

903
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,599
they convinced everybody that the

904
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,359
processed fake Meats were vegan were for

905
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,040
vegans they were made for vegans they

906
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,119
were created for vegans and the vegans

907
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,119
just slobbered it and ate it all down

908
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,599
and that was it really good move but

909
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,560
guess what the plant-based people in the

910
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,960
vegans can't stick up for themselves cuz

911
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,400
a they're probably not watching medical

912
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,200
medium stuff really B they don't want to

913
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,839
learn C there was a way to battle that

914
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,480
one easily cuz that was for the

915
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,480
vegetarians not for the plant-based

916
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,480
people

917
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,640
so let's get down to the

918
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,640
nitty-gritty a so over there on YouTube

919
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,160
when I turned plant base there were many

920
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,680
vegan people with symptoms on social and

921
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,920
vegan influencers did not have answers

922
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,560
they would always say you are either

923
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,480
detoxing or not doing it right correct

924
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,040
that's what they would always say you're

925
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,319
detoxing too much you're detoxing too

926
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,280
much that's what they would always say

927
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:56,720
but they didn't know information they

928
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,079
didn't know that it's not detoxing too

929
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,480
much they didn't know it was you got

930
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,839
viruses you got pathogens you're not

931
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,800
eating the right way to support going

932
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,160
against those pathogens they didn't know

933
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,119
why you were sick they didn't know

934
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,640
autoimmune a farce they didn't know

935
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,520
anything Brook over there on YouTube I'm

936
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,440
a perfect example of this I was vegan

937
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,160
for over 10 years before I had my health

938
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,160
challenges after having my first

939
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,119
baby over there Michael Charles over

940
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,839
there on YouTube You're going to be

941
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,960
deficient quotation marks there is what

942
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,920
they'll say not knowing anything about

943
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,160
the B12 that's in your book and the B12

944
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,200
information okay great one so Mye

945
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,640
Charles that's really a really important

946
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,319
one and I want to talk about that for a

947
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:47,599
second okay great one okay the B12

948
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:50,480
weapon is a great one too that's what

949
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,240
he's saying it's these influencers like

950
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,760
I said before the Meat Heads the

951
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,640
trainers whatever you want to call it

952
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,119
the bodybuilders or just the doctors

953
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,760
that don't want to work on patients

954
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,160
they're just they're wealthy doctors

955
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,560
don't need to work ever a day in their

956
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,240
life their mommy and daddy paid for

957
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,000
their medical their medical uh school

958
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,000
they they went through Medical School

959
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,800
whatever it is all paid for by Mommy and

960
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,280
Daddy they got which is fine whatever

961
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,520
that's fine they got they got they got

962
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,079
their medical license but realize they

963
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,400
don't want to practice they don't want

964
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,160
to touch dirty people they're too you

965
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,880
know above that they don't want to deal

966
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,440
with people complaining and crying in

967
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,880
the waiting rooms and them just trying

968
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,440
to like offer a drug or whatever it is

969
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,560
so they just went on social there's a

970
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,560
massive upsurge of these what I call

971
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,560
fake doctors because they don't want to

972
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,200
practice and they don't have

973
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,119
experiencing practice experience

974
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,720
practice right they don't have that so

975
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,880
what they're rising up right now and

976
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,240
they're the ones that are taking down

977
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,119
the vegan movement and the plant-based

978
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,880
movement they Ed the B12 example right

979
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,240
there so Mike they Ed the B12 example

980
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,359
and but what the vegans and the

981
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,800
plant-based people did not adopt what

982
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,440
they did not do is no medical medium

983
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,960
information enough to know that

984
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,359
everybody's B12 deficient all the meat

985
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,440
eaters are B12 deficient and the

986
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:08,040
B12 in meat is not even synergistic to

987
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,560
your body it's not even

988
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,400
bioidentical so you can't even use that

989
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,480
B12 the B12 in meat isn't B12 your body

990
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,359
uses so you become B12 deficient even if

991
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,720
your blood test says you have

992
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,599
B12 and so that's why millions of meat

993
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,400
eaters are getting sick every single day

994
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,160
millions of Keto people millions of the

995
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,920
Paleo people in the past millions of the

996
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,480
Atkins people millions of the new

997
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,359
carnivore people well there isn't

998
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:38,200
millions of those millions of the keto

999
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:40,960
people they're all getting sick too and

1000
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,520
they're all getting like lots of

1001
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,960
different symptoms and they're getting

1002
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:49,240
B12 deficient you can be B12 deficient

1003
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,240
both as a plant-based person and a vegan

1004
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,160
person and as a keto person carnivore

1005
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,640
person or any kind of animal protein

1006
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,720
person you can be B12 deficient and

1007
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,319
guess what every everybody really is

1008
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,560
even if their blood test says a certain

1009
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,319
thing if you learn medical medum

1010
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,280
information you can learn how to heal

1011
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:07,359
the details matter but guess what the

1012
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,359
pl-based movement many of them didn't

1013
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,280
really want to learn or know or didn't

1014
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:15,319
really look at it and they got burned

1015
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,480
they got convinced and pushed out of

1016
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:20,280
something that intuitively they knew was

1017
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,240
good for them keep that in mind a lot of

1018
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,160
people that went plant-based intuitively

1019
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,240
thought this was good for me they used

1020
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,119
their intuition and they knew that the

1021
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,800
plant-based movement was good for them

1022
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:33,000
but then they got psyched out by demons

1023
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,920
demons in the hellfield that actually

1024
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,040
took them out and that's what this is

1025
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,760
about it's the war the Meat Heads

1026
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,760
against the soy

1027
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,960
boys and as soy boy lost because I don't

1028
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,040
know about a recovery from this I really

1029
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,720
don't a recovery for the vegan movement

1030
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,800
is going to be really hard and I know

1031
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,720
what you're thinking you're thinking at

1032
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,400
the last vegan Festival there was 20,000

1033
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,760
people there 15,000 people there that's

1034
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,520
a joke

1035
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,640
that's a joke for the vegan movement for

1036
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,520
the plant-based movement that's really

1037
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:10,240
sad really

1038
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:12,599
sad really is and half those people were

1039
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,240
still half to three4 of those people are

1040
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:16,079
still doing animal products here and

1041
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,760
there and that leads me to the next part

1042
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,800
of the

1043
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,319
topic there's not a lot of people that

1044
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,880
were truly plant-based they always they

1045
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,000
were plant-based for a month and then

1046
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,960
not anymore for a day plant-based for

1047
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,319
another month and not anymore for a day

1048
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,920
then they ate a piece of cheese at a

1049
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:33,319
friend's house then they ate a piece of

1050
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,440
cheese here then they ate an egg two

1051
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:38,440
weeks later there really wasn't a lot of

1052
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,200
people that were plant-based plant-based

1053
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,559
plant-based they wanted to be they were

1054
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,720
trying but they just couldn't do it and

1055
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,760
they just they caved in and they ate an

1056
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,920
egg and they ate a piece of cheese and

1057
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,280
that's what they

1058
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,079
did but there's a lot of people that

1059
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,800
thought when they were vegans and they

1060
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,359
were being a vegan and they thought

1061
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,520
animal cruelty and animals dying and

1062
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,000
getting slaughtered and pigs getting

1063
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,599
slaughtered and killed they were like

1064
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,559
that was enough for them to not do

1065
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,720
anything animal so they're really strict

1066
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,079
like no animal animal no animal and then

1067
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,520
when they got 24 years old 25 years old

1068
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:09,680
and they got their first symptoms and

1069
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,760
something went wrong and they found

1070
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,000
something on their skin and everything

1071
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,680
they panicked and it wasn't about the

1072
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,599
animals anymore forget the animals who

1073
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,240
cares if they die I got a problem on my

1074
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,200
skin I'm protein deficient now and or

1075
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,280
they

1076
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:30,040
believe so the plant-based movement was

1077
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:33,839
always high fat High high fat high fat

1078
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,280
even when it was lowfat a little bit it

1079
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,880
wasn't low it wasn't low of fat enough

1080
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,359
for somebody that had a serious health

1081
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,960
condition that needed to heal so

1082
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:43,520
therefore there's really nowhere to go

1083
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,920
you go into the vegan plant-based

1084
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,760
movement you're kind of stuck you're in

1085
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,160
high-fat land you're in all this other

1086
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,000
stuff you're using canola oil you're

1087
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,480
eating canola oil without even realizing

1088
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,160
it all these

1089
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:58,319
things nutritional yeast vinegars canola

1090
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,800
oils mixed all this stuff citric acid

1091
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,319
all these things right you're eating

1092
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,520
corn you're eating corn but you think

1093
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:05,760
it's organic but it's but it's not and

1094
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,760
it's not organic and it's GMO and you're

1095
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,480
eating soy and you think it's organic

1096
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:15,160
and then like I said

1097
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:18,720
earlier the winners of the war the

1098
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:20,920
winners of the war they won they learned

1099
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,160
medical medium information they learn

1100
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,760
that all soy was bad they learned that

1101
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,920
all corn was bad they learned that and

1102
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,800
by the way corn and soy Fe pathogens so

1103
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,040
here you are a plant-based person eating

1104
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,839
lots of organic corn all the time not

1105
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,680
just one or two ears of corn in the

1106
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,280
summertime you're eating it every day

1107
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,480
and this is key medical beam information

1108
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,359
you're eating it every day you're

1109
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,200
feeding pathogens so here you are as a

1110
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,880
plant-based person and you're feeding

1111
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,319
pathogens and you're getting sick and

1112
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,000
symptoms because of all the corn you're

1113
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,520
eating but you're plant-based you're

1114
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,800
confused so now you're running back to

1115
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,079
eggs you're running back to things you

1116
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,640
see an influencer you see all the women

1117
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,760
influencers the young women influencers

1118
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,119
that try tried the plant-based movement

1119
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,800
and now they're on their feeds talking

1120
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,440
about their protein deficiencies and how

1121
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,599
they don't have they're not fertile or

1122
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,400
they don't know if they're fertile

1123
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:07,839
enough you hear that and then you're

1124
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,760
another woman too and you're just like

1125
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,839
oh my God I'm hearing that I'm running

1126
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,280
from this I'm getting a symptom I didn't

1127
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,520
know it was because I'm eating corn

1128
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,839
every other day I'm getting a symptom I

1129
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,200
better get out of this like they're

1130
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,720
getting out of this and I better get on

1131
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,520
some eggs and some dairy products and

1132
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,599
whatever else I better start eating meat

1133
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:28,200
and choking that stuff down no matter

1134
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,200
what I better learn how to choke it down

1135
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,559
yeah important to know and I talked

1136
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,040
about the last live anybody that's on a

1137
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:41,800
carnivore diet keep in mind you're going

1138
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,119
to hit the wall at some point you're

1139
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,680
just going to hit the wall at some point

1140
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,160
you're going to get gluc glucose

1141
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,160
deficient in your

1142
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,800
brain you're going to get bogged down

1143
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,839
with all that fat that animal fat you're

1144
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,160
going to get nutrient deficient for real

1145
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,240
it's going to show up a couple years

1146
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,160
down the road and you're going to have

1147
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,680
to do what the carnivore people do which

1148
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,640
is bringing honey and lemon that's

1149
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,640
medical medium information bringing

1150
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,160
honey and lemon and then you're going to

1151
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,720
have to bringing fruit medical medium

1152
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,040
information again remember I was the one

1153
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,559
that broke fruit fear do you guys

1154
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,000
remember that medical medium information

1155
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,559
broke the whole fruit fear thing broke

1156
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,400
the whole fruit fear thing so that

1157
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:20,440
carnivore could have S could save its

1158
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,720
skin did you know that I made Fruit

1159
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,440
acceptable in the health World which

1160
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,319
means the carnivore people now saved

1161
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,160
their butts when they were dying from

1162
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:31,280
just eating meat alone they saved their

1163
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,319
butts by now bringing in Fruit that's

1164
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,160
medical medium information that allowed

1165
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:37,880
the carnivore people to eat fruit they

1166
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,440
would have never touched fruit in a

1167
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,960
million

1168
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,720
years in a million

1169
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,079
years if it wasn't for medical medium

1170
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,119
spending all those years all that time

1171
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:52,040
publishing all that stuff about fruit

1172
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,200
fear and making it acceptable so people

1173
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,240
would bring in their fruits and not be

1174
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,200
afraid and ostracized right and bring in

1175
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,800
their fruits so when the new keto

1176
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,359

because I made it safe for them they

1184
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,880
were smart they took that information

1185
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,000
and they used it and it's protecting

1186
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,240
them while they're slaughtering the

1187
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,240
plant-based in vegan

1188
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,640

weaponized not only the infertility they

1190
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,200
weaponized the hormones being imbalanced

1191
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,200
in women with their reproductive system

1192
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:45,680
they weaponized

1193
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,520
that they weaponized the soy and the

1194
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,760
corn information from medical medium

1195
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,960
they took that information they

1196
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,160
weaponized

1197
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,400
that and they

1198
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,680
[Music]

1199
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,119
weaponized the feminization

1200
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,520
Factor

1201
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:05,240
feminizing they weaponize that they

1202
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,440
convince the plant-based women and the

1203
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:10,720
vegan women that the dudes that are

1204
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,800
vegan are feminized they're feminine now

1205
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,720
from what they were doing and that's not

1206
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,200

they're like my sperm is strong that's

1212
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,640
what they're all basically trying to say

1213
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:32,319
and they actually do say that

1214
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,480
too some not all of them but some of

1215
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,319

00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,040
they've completely coined the

1222
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,079
plant-based movement and the vegan

1223
00:48:52,040 --> 00:49:00,240
movement with that kind of

1224
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:02,599
thing as a brilliant game and

1225
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,079
strategy and from what I see I don't

1226
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:07,319
think the plant-based movement and the

1227
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,799

1266
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:44,000
scam that you know scam you and get by

1267
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,880
and what binge they're on when they when

1268
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,440
they binge and when they do it and the

1269
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,599
time they did it they're not going to do

1270
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,040
that because that's going to destroy

1271
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:51,160
their platform now their platform is

1272
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,359
destroyed it's not going to be helpful

1273
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,319
for them they're not going to be able to

1274
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:56,319
bank and Bank

1275
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,079
The Spoils of War man slaughtering the

1276
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,559
vegan and plant-based movement they did

1277
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,480
a great job and they did it they did it

1278
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:07,640
is there any hope there's always

1279
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,280
hope I don't see the vegan and

1280
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,319
plant-based movement coming out of it

1281
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,920
anytime soon I see it going down even to

1282
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:17,400
a darker pit in a deeper rabbit hole is

1283
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,640
where it's going if you're plant-based

1284
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,960
stay plant-based but learn how to do it

1285
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:24,040
right if you're plant-based stay

1286
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:27,160
plant-based learn how to do it right

1287
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:30,079
okay it's very important right there

1288
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:32,359
learn how to do it right save yourself

1289
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,640
cuz you will be on meet at some point in

1290
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:37,000
your life because you'll be so confused

1291
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,880

00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,599

1293
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,920
back on eggs and whatever else and meat

1294
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,680
and whatever else confused doing the

1295
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,880
ring around the rosie doing the musical

1296
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,359
chairs

1297
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,799
doing you know you're going to be in

1298
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,640
that big old forever Catch 22 not

1299
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:55,880
knowing what to do not knowing how to

1300
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,799
heal symptoms still coming symptoms

1301
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,000
still kind of going up and down new

1302
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:01,839
symptoms appearing that's what where

1303
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,440
you'll be if you're plant-based stay

1304
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:07,000
plant-based but learn how to do it and

1305
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:10,400
customize it to what you need

1306
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,160
critical maram right there it is so true

1307
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,440
I read books by MDS to help my brain and

1308
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,559
it was all about keto it made me worse

1309
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,480
of course cuz keto can't help a brain

1310
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:21,160
thank goodness I found medical medium

1311
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,000
through a friend and and that takes me

1312
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,839
to the next part you can't fix a brain

1313
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,520
you can't detox a brain when you're on

1314
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,280
keto

1315
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,839
it just can't but if you're 24 years old

1316
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,599
and you're working out every day and you

1317
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,599
really you didn't have a sick moment in

1318
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,799
your life yet you just got some athletes

1319
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:40,160
foot and you just got some fungus on

1320
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:41,280
your feet because all those dudes got

1321
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,799
fungus on their feet and I'm going to

1322
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,720
tell you right now because I know this

1323
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:48,799
because I know I've talked to enough

1324
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:52,319
people enough times I also got a little

1325
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:54,839
voice in my ear and so they still got

1326
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:57,839
athletes foot they still got jockage

1327
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:59,480
fungus that comes in goes with creams

1328
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:01,559
they still got all that but they're not

1329
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,839
exhibiting that neurological fatigue yet

1330
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:06,240
or anything like that that comes later

1331
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,520
that comes later when they hit the wall

1332
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,760
and they get their first batch of

1333
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,760
shingles all over the side of their body

1334
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,359
on the side of their torso and they're

1335
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,280
in they're into that whole thing now

1336
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,040
they're just you know in that place and

1337
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,760
they're confused and like what's going

1338
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,359
on here it comes sickness comes every or

1339
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,359
they just have a heart

1340
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,839
attack like so many people are doing

1341
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,720
every single day right now at age 20 2

1342
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:31,119
age 30 the heart attacks are crazy right

1343
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,200
now the amount of people that are dying

1344
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:36,520
with heart problems is unbelievable just

1345
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:40,760
like I predicted Tressa says can we also

1346
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:44,119
talk about all those Meat Heads in shape

1347
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,839
claiming they look buff from carnivore

1348
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:47,599
when they're doing steroids and of

1349
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,000
course not mentioning it of course they

1350
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,359
do a lot of steroids and a lot of guys

1351
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,760
do they don't do steroids like the

1352
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:55,079
steroid days like the old days they

1353
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,240
don't do that like the old days they do

1354
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:58,839
testosterone

1355
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,119
they don't do the they don't do the

1356
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:02,480
steroids that they did back back then

1357
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,400
just so you know and the growth hormones

1358
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,880
and the in the steroids they just do

1359
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,680
testosterone right the doctors are

1360
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,240
giving them all testosterone they want

1361
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,520
their testosterone to be somewhere

1362
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:15,680
around

1363
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:17,520
1,200 1,400 1,600 1,800 so they want

1364
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,079
that they want to see testosterone

1365
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,680
levels like 1,800 on their blood test

1366
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:25,400
and they and then they want to even take

1367
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:28,040
more testosterone than that so they are

1368
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,599
on steroids they up their testosterone

1369
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:32,200
they're working out that's what they're

1370
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,599
doing that's a big part of it too out

1371
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,400
there you know the other big part of it

1372
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:39,440
is that the ones you see on social they

1373
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,200
don't have a job most of them they don't

1374
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,280
work a job they're in the gym they're in

1375
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,040
the gym four hours a day they pamper

1376
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,240
themselves they self-care themselves to

1377
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,520
death they can do it day in and day out

1378
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,440
haven't gotten sick yet their stress is

1379
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,720
really low to down real low those are

1380
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,839

1381
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,520

these all these doctors are literally

1404
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,079
they're all just playing the field now

1405
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,680
on social and they're not practicing and

1406
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:56,359
they're able to selfcare themselves to

1407
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,599
death and do four hours in the gym every

1408
00:55:56,359 --> 00:55:59,280

00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,559
just pissed at me I probably lost so

1441
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,799
many followers because I went after

1442
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,920
nutritional yeast because people use

1443
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:32,119
that like

1444
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,920
crack and the Meat Heads they took that

1445
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,680
information and they have so many

1446
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,079
weapons and they took infertility for

1447
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,799
the women and they took they took the

1448
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:43,319
whole thing where the soy boys the men

1449
00:57:39,799 --> 00:57:45,200
are feminized and they took all of that

1450
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:47,240
and they weaponized all these bits in

1451
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,559
pieces and they did a good

1452
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:52,200
job and they're not even done they're

1453
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,799
not even

1454
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:58,079
done and they put the last nail in the

1455
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:59,599
coffin with that fertility crap right

1456
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,960
they knock that one

1457
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,960
in not going to be a lot of women left

1458
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,119
doing plant-based or vegan so they're

1459
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,200
going to be sick either way if they

1460
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,200
don't learn the medical medium

1461
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:14,240
information this isn't about medical

1462
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:16,319
medium medical medium is not on either

1463
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,680
side this is just what's happening in

1464
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,160
the world right now I need people to

1465
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,240
know I'm not sitting here trying to

1466
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,200
fight for

1467
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,160
vegans I'm not sitting you're trying to

1468
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,839
fight for

1469
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:30,400
vegans I'm not

1470
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:32,319
you can do animal proteins in a way to

1471
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,440
still use medical medium and heal

1472
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,079
they're figuring it out those Meat Heads

1473
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,480
are partially figuring it out they

1474
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,400
brought the fruit

1475
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,960
in they know to stay away from corn and

1476
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,079
soy yeah they know to stay away from all

1477
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,400
the MSG and all the you know weird

1478
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:50,799
ambiguous places they they're

1479
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,680
learning and they're figuring it out and

1480
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:54,119
they're getting some benefits from it

1481
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,359
and they're moving forward and they're

1482
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:57,680
able to get on their social media

1483
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,160
platform and say my skin was yucky I had

1484
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:02,079
acne now it's getting a little bit

1485
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,359
better and then you got some girl who's

1486
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,960
plant-based who's following this dude's

1487
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:09,039
account and she's plant-based and her

1488
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,680
acne is blowing up because she doesn't

1489
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,559
know medical medium information about

1490
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,559
how to get rid of acne while you're

1491
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,000
plant-based how you can do that while

1492
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,559
you're plant-based she's not going to

1493
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,920
know that so then she's watching the

1494
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:21,839
dude and she's just plant-based

1495
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:27,280
movements just going to be gone I think

1496
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:29,760
it's probably probably on its last leg

1497
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,760
just in this the rest of this year early

1498
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,359

to let but I prayed to like it I have

1504
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,119
now had it every day for two weeks in a

1505
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,760
row and love the taste major

1506
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:51,520
improvements in my health definitely

1507
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,640
Missing Link thank you it is a missing

1508
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,920
link and I want to tell you something

1509
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,799
about the spinach soup the medical beam

1510
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,760
spinach soup I'm going to make it for

1511
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:59,920
you next live I do because I want to

1512
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,799
show you different like variables that

1513
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,720
make it taste better and how how to do

1514
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:06,200
it just right and what you can do with

1515
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:09,000
that what you can do with that it's

1516
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:12,799
incredible one of the weapons that the

1517
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,839
meat hads used which was being anti

1518
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:19,359
vegetable and anti- leafy

1519
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:21,920
green another really good weapon of

1520
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,400
choice against the plant-based people

1521
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,000
because they know that the plant-based

1522
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,280
people are eating their salads and

1523
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,839
plant-based women are eating their

1524
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:34,880
salads they know that plant-based women

1525
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:38,079
love salads and they know women love

1526
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:41,440
salads so another way to really wipe the

1527
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:44,400
floor clean of the with the plant-based

1528
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:47,079
movement was to hit the vegetables are

1529
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,960
bad they're toxic here's the reasons why

1530
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:54,160
out in nature what happens is this

1531
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:57,039
greens are bad they took that like paleo

1532
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,520
information of vegetables being

1533
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,720
de and they Incorporated it and they

1534
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:03,760
used it as a weapon against a

1535
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:07,400
plant-based movement so the plant-based

1536
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:09,440
girls plant-based women would be like

1537
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,319
well I'm not supposed to be eating these

1538
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,760
vegetables either this dude's saying

1539
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:15,599
that these things are

1540
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,480
toxic and it's it's another great weapon

1541
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,119
that happened and descended upon the

1542
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,640
plant-based movement now if you don't

1543
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:25,960
see any of this out there happening it's

1544
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:30,680
out there happening and it's rampid and

1545
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:32,480
it is going a mile a minute right now so

1546
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,920
I'm giving you all the different

1547
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,280
variations the understandings of of

1548
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,760
what's Happening kind of how it was

1549
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,079
derived around the time frame it was

1550
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,559
derived what's going on with

1551
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:46,880
it and you're going to see pretty soon

1552
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:51,000
all of the fashion companies are not

1553
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,799
going to be offering vegan leather

1554
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,279
pretty soon they're going to be only

1555
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:58,640
offering one shoe in vegan leather Two

1556
01:01:56,279 --> 01:02:01,799
Shoes in vegan leather you're going to

1557
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:04,960
see that next year you're G to see

1558
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:06,920
fashion designers not offering it

1559
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,640
companies and fashion brands not

1560
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,559
offering it you'll see going out to

1561
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,680
pasture is where you're going to see

1562
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:15,000
that go that's going to be in the next

1563
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,839
coming couple of

1564
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,079
years

1565
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:23,200
because because veganism is dying

1566
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:26,640
veganism is practically dead plant-based

1567
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,920
movement is just about on its way

1568
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,640
let's start making some food and I'll

1569
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,640
cover a little bit

1570
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:40,039
more back to this if you're this is

1571
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:42,599
important I'm not pining for either

1572
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:45,039
side I feel bad for the plant-based

1573
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:47,799
people there's a way to be

1574
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:52,720
plant-based and there's a way to heal

1575
01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:52,720
there's a way to fix your problems

1576
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,520
plant-based Bela says I've been

1577
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:01,400
listening to you and reading your books

1578
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:04,440
for like eight years I see people and

1579
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,319
companies all the time now saying things

1580
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,000
I first heard from you it's so strange

1581
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,000
and that's what they're doing they've

1582
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,160
gone into the medical medium series the

1583
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,240
medical medium Bibles and they poached

1584
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,079
the crap out of them now here's what I

1585
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,799
was supposed to do but I wouldn't

1586
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,160
wouldn't have done it

1587
01:03:17,799 --> 01:03:22,920
anyway so I have people coming to me

1588
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,760
that that because I don't have like I

1589
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,039
don't have PR firms working for me I

1590
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,839
don't do the pr firm thing and you know

1591
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,520

01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,799
books went out there people healed and

1594
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:38,279
told somebody

1595
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:40,079
else so PR marketing firms come up to me

1596
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:41,599

this okay they'll say these things

1605
01:03:54,039 --> 01:04:00,200
they'll say why did you put all that

1606
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:03,400
information for free in nine books over

1607
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:05,319
the last 10 years why didn't you take

1608
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,880
pieces of this because it was original

1609
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:08,599
information it wasn't out there why

1610
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,079
didn't you package and sell each

1611
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:12,279
individual

1612
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,079

billionaire by now they say it all the

1614
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,680
time I say because that's that's that's

and get them for free you can buy one

1618
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,279
for 20 bucks I mean that's free also in

1619
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,000
hundreds and hundreds of live streams

1620
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:33,079
and podcasts they also poach the

1621
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,039
information and so what happened is what

1622
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:37,960
you see now is all this early medical

1623
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:41,119
medium information being weaponized and

1624
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:43,039
used it is and you see people talking

1625
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:45,079
about it you see podcast doctors talking

1626
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,319
about it you see it out there right

1627
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:48,920
exactly they took the info and they're

1628
01:04:47,319 --> 01:04:51,359
using it and they're weedling it into

1629
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:53,559
their own belief systems like carnivore

1630
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:55,760
and like keto and like even some

1631
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:57,640
plant-based people are doing it too but

1632
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,119
plant based people could not save the

1633
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,240
movement because they didn't want to

1634
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,799
know medical medium information

1635
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:05,559

happened if you want to be animal

1672
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:03,839
protein you can and do medical medium I

1673
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:06,279
never ever said meat was poison meat was

1674
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:09,640
terrible for your health in the sense

1675
01:07:06,279 --> 01:07:11,920
where it's highly toxic and poisonous I

1676
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,480
never said don't eat meat I never said

1677
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,480
people are stupid by eating meat I never

1678
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,480
said anything of the

1679
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:23,319
sort but what I have said all these

1680
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:25,839
years is if you want to go the meat root

1681
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:28,079
there's a way to do it you can heal you

1682
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:30,440
can work on your healing process and you

1683
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,440
can do

1684
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:37,440
it okay little bit more lemon juice in

1685
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,440

1686
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,799
lemons I was never on one side of the

1687
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:51,359
aisle and one side only because you got

1688
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:53,319

1689
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,599
to way your body needs it everything

1690
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:57,319
about it but what I did say though you

1691
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:01,480
can fat yourself to

1692
01:07:57,319 --> 01:08:04,680
death you can eat so much overt fat that

1693
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:06,760
you can really decline in so many ways

1694
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:09,039
that's one thing all on its own I mean

1695
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:12,000

01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:31,679
the beginning of

01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:31,679
2025 the winter of

1726
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:37,319

other side of the planet but the winter

1728
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:41,239
of

1729
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:44,719
2025 would be

1730
01:09:41,239 --> 01:09:48,080
probably the veganism and plant-based

1731
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:50,440
movement um

1732
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:52,640

for that what they on YouTube I noticed

1798
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:56,080
at my local organic store things used to

1799
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:58,280
cater to a lot of vegans but in the past

1800
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,000
year or more that changed and I didn't

1801
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:03,960
understand why catering to vegans is

1802
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,520
disappearing absolutely it's definitely

1803
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:10,000
disappearing farmers markets all

1804
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:13,120
included it's um and menus too in

1805
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,360
restaurants as well menus are not going

1806
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,440
to cater as much you're going to see

1807
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:20,880
less and less on the menus there's going

1808
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:22,600
to be less vegans going into places and

1809
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,960
that's that's the thing and asking for

1810
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:26,120
things and that's what's happening which

1811
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,120
is is you

1812
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:31,760
know which is really really annoying for

1813
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,320
so many people because why when I talk

1814
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,840
about truths a lot of people get

1815
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:39,199
offended and then they're upset and then

1816
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:41,679
I don't make friends um my podcast

1817
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:44,000
episodes Don't Make Friends especially

1818
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:47,880
the one that I'm putting out next week

1819
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,960
you know like there's there's it's like

1820
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:52,560
yeah a lot of things that I've said over

1821
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:54,239
these years the fragrance thing right I

1822
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,280
broke the fragrance thing out in the

1823
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:58,320
world now it's of course getting all

1824
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:00,520
poached right there's a new person every

1825
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,679
day like fragrances it's always some PhD

1826
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:07,280
guy or something

1827
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:10,080
and um and they're like fragrances are

1828
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:12,320
bad got I'm chopping up some tomato but

1829
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:15,480
I when I broke the fragrance thing the

1830
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,960
hate man the hate was so thick when you

1831
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,679
break the stuff out first and you teach

1832
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:22,159
about it and stuff and you message about

1833
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,639
it especially from Spirit like all the

1834
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:26,880
info oh my God the amount of the hate

1835
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:29,600
was crazy but then weeks or months or

1836
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,040
years later those same people who were

1837
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,639
hating on me talking crap about me on

1838
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:36,560
social media they're all using the

1839
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:39,760
information benefiting it and passing it

1840
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,760
around like they're the

1841
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:47,639
experts when you do things like that you

1842
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:51,320
have to reckon with that when you leave

1843
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:54,000
here I think that's something

1844
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,360
that you know Spirit of compassion told

1845
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
me that when I was

1846
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:01,960
younger that when you purposely do evil

1847
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,639
[ __ ] like that or you purposely do evil

1848
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:07,239
stuff with intentions behind it you sit

1849
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:09,560
there and you try to demean and hurt

1850
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:11,520
someone like you know you you're you're

1851
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:13,159
you're a medical medium hater you're

1852
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,040
ranking on what he what the medical

1853
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:17,080
medium is talking about the information

1854
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,560
right and you're ruining people's

1855
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:21,040
chances of healing because they get

1856
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,199
thrown by it right think about that and

1857
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:25,040
then a year later two years later 3

1858
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:26,840
years later you take medical me

1859
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,360
information you never apologize for what

1860
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,520
you've done you never said how you were

1861
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:33,080
wrong and and Anthony William had it

1862
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:36,159
right and then you end up using it well

1863
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:37,719
what happens is when you purposely do

1864
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:40,520
that

1865
01:15:37,719 --> 01:15:43,600
purposely it's something that has to be

1866
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,920
resolved before you die so when you're

1867
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,520
80 years old 90 years old 70 years old

1868
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,800
whatever it is 60 years old or whatever

1869
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,800
is going to happen with someone in their

1870
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,920
life and you're on your

1871
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:56,600
deathbed that gets brought before you

1872
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,360
Spirit of compassion has always told me

1873
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:02,920
that gets brought before

1874
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:04,400
you it does and it's basically like you

1875
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:08,040
remember when you purposely

1876
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:10,159
intentionally were just evil and you

1877
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:12,040
thwarted people's healing process and

1878
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:14,000
you said all these things and then you

1879
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:17,480
took the information and then you

1880
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:21,120
benefited from it and never apologized

1881
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:24,159
and never came clean you remember that

1882
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:27,480
and you were evil when you did it that

1883
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:28,960
has to be resolved before you pass on

1884
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,800
and so I see all these people doing that

1885
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,920
and I'm like you think that's just like

1886
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,520
that that's it nothing to worry about

1887
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,199
anymore that's it it's over you totally

1888
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,000
screw me over like that you know you

1889
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:41,320
tell people this and that you do this

1890
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,159
then you take the info that info comes

1891
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,600
from

1892
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:47,080
above that info you learned and you're

1893
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,000
spreading around and using against me

1894
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:51,159
and using for yourself the benefit and

1895
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:55,199
doing these evil you know these evil

1896
01:16:51,159 --> 01:16:57,960
things that's information that came from

1897
01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:01,320
a Divine Source from

1898
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:03,960
above you don't think down the road

1899
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:08,000
there may be some payment for that in a

1900
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:08,000
on a spiritual level well you'll

1901
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:12,560

yep it's over all right just in a little

1923
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,920
bit more time okay so I'm going to put a

1924
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:27,199
little green onion in here really quick

1925
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,199
okay so some green

1926
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:33,320
onion you guys this dish is really

1927
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:41,600
delicious if you're a meat eater and

1928
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:43,120
you're somebody that's on keto or

1929
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,800
whatever and you're watching this and

1930
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,880
you're not sure if you hate me or like

1931
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:50,199
me even though you you kind of probably

1932
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:53,840
heard you can do animal products I never

1933
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:55,760
ripped down meat and ripped it apart and

1934
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,400
attacked people support or anything like

1935
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:00,360
that have always been supportive if

1936
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:02,880
you're an animal protein dude or or you

1937
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:04,480
know person of some kind and you're you

1938
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,920
know you're an animal protein person

1939
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:09,719
here's what I would do I would make this

1940
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:11,360
dish I would take the Millet and move

1941
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:14,840
the Millet out and not use it in this

1942
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:17,400
dish and I would put a small portion of

1943
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:20,159
your favorite meat in the dish that's

1944
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:22,040
what I would do that's all if you're a

1945
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:24,520
meat eater that's what I would do I

1946
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:27,679
would not do it with the Millet in there

1947
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:29,520
I would replace the Millet with the meat

1948
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:31,600
and I wouldn't use a lot of meat I'd use

1949
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:34,199
a little bit of meat because the meat is

1950
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,239
an overt fat and you don't want to over

1951
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:38,960
fat your dish too high you're not going

1952
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:41,480
to heal if you over fat your dish too

1953
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,520
high and then I would make sure that

1954
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:45,679
that was pretty much your only meat for

1955
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,360
the day if you're trying to heal if

1956
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,360
you're chronically

1957
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,480
sick all right what else we got cooking

1958
01:19:55,040 --> 01:20:03,600
here um I'm going to um cut up an onion

1959
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:03,600
a little bit okay let me do

1960
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:10,239
that see is this an onion that's a good

1961
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:10,239
onion it is a good onion right

1962
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:27,120
here another thing too marketing wise

1963
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:30,800
marketing the meat found a great way to

1964
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:33,960
Market great techniques great tactics as

1965
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,400
well they really can do a lot of damage

1966
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,159
to the plant-based

1967
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,600
movement the take down of the

1968
01:20:37,159 --> 01:20:41,239
plant-based

1969
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:44,760
movement was on

1970
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:47,480
purpose it was to get plant-based people

1971
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:50,920
to buy their stuff and do their stuff

1972
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:54,000
buy their protein powders by all their

1973
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:57,239
things it was to get people that were on

1974
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,520
plant Pro protein powders to go and buy

1975
01:20:57,239 --> 01:21:05,280

greens that's what you do with it now

1995
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,880

1996
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:05,760

right here too so let's get some mint in

2008
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,120
here I'm not going to use a lot of

2009
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:41,199
mint I'm just going to eat a little bit

2010
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:43,480
of mint today not a lot of it I'm going

2011
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:44,679
to eat a little bit of it okay there we

2012
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:47,679
go

2013
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:51,440
there coming together you guys coming

2014
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:53,520
together so we got Millet so we can do

2015
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:56,080
we can do a little bit of millet half

2016
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:59,040
cup a full cup whatever you would like

2017
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:02,480
I'm going to do a scoop gauge

2018
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:05,159
it two cups you can do

2019
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:10,639
so I'm going to take some freshly cooked

2020
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:10,639
Millet here it's cooked perfectly too as

2021
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:20,440
well see what you don't do is you don't

2022
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:25,480
put an over it fat you don't put oil in

2023
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:28,040
here with this Millet you don't do that

2024
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:30,080
you keep you keep the fats

2025
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:31,880
out and list if you're if you're

2026
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,280
somebody that's you know you just don't

2027
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:35,159
want to do the Millet you don't have to

2028
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,639
do the Millet do it without the Millet

2029
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:38,440
if you're a meat eater take the Millet

2030
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,480
out replace it with some meat but do it

2031
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,719
the way I was talking about going to put

2032
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,239
a little bit more here cuz I want

2033
01:23:41,719 --> 01:23:45,000
roughly around two cups so I'm going to

2034
01:23:43,239 --> 01:23:47,199
put a little bit more in here there you

2035
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:52,000
go see how that

2036
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:52,000
looks nice looking real

2037
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,440
good give it a good mix

2038
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:01,040
I think it's got a great balance of

2039
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,040
everything in

2040
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:08,000
there I can put it in a different

2041
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:10,760
Bowl Millet is one of my favorite grains

2042
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:14,760
it's a grain that can help you heal it

2043
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:16,560
can offers a lot of nutrition a lot of

2044
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:18,560
phytochemical

2045
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,440
compounds it's not that you should be un

2046
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:23,560
Mill it every day it's one of these

2047
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,880
things though you can use as a tool if

2048
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:28,520
you use it just

2049
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:31,719
right if you mix Millet with a whole

2050
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:34,760
bunch of oil and a whole bunch of nut

2051
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:39,080
butter or tahini it's not a good it's

2052
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:42,920
not a good use of it if you're

2053
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:46,920
healing cweed hero says no radical

2054
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:49,560
fat just conservative fat really

2055
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:51,440
smart so yeah so there we go I made the

2056
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:53,199
dish I made it in this bowl I could set

2057
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:56,440
it up in a different Bowl though

2058
01:24:53,199 --> 01:25:01,000
potentially make it kind of look look

2059
01:24:56,440 --> 01:25:01,000
okay uh you can do it in different ways

2060
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,960
here and maybe I can even do this really

2061
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:12,679
quick can do something like this

2062
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,800
too and what you can do is just

2063
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:23,880
basically plac in this

2064
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:26,159
beautiful like little white Bowl here

2065
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:30,679
and there we we

2066
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:30,679
go that was not an exhaustive

2067
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:39,040
list I can talk about the war against

2068
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:42,760
