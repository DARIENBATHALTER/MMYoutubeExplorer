i'm excited to be on right now our vice

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,040
is in the way where

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,240
you get ostracized you get

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,200

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,080
to try to

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759
break a vice because it makes everybody

43
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,680
else feel uncomfortable

44
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,119
so if you try to break a vice of some

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,560
kind like you're hanging out with

46
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,159

48
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
and you don't want that cheeseburger so

49
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,840
you're just

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,119

so you're the one made to feel

58
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,119
uncomfortable right

59
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
and and so we're not allowed to break

60
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,799
our vices did you ever

61
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,960
ever see that we're not allowed to break

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,600
our vices

63
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,280
so breaking our vices is kind of like

64
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,880
off limits

65
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,360
if you start breaking your vices

66
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,640
whatever those vices are caffeine

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,000
coffee cheese right

68
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
cheese milk butter whatever those vices

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
might be

70
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,200
pizza something that you guys you know

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,360
you guys like so maybe some pizza i got

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,440
a pizza right here and

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,920
whatever that vice is you have to

74
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,080
you have to stay in line and we get

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,599
punished if we break that line if we

76
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,480
come out of that line right

77
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,360
get punished by people around us loved

78
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,560
ones

79
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,160
friends people we know and

80
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,599
you're just that weirdo you're that

81
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,959
weirdo you're worried about your health

82
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,400
or you're that you're that weirdo that

83
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,080
has health issues

84
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
and that's kind of what happens out

85
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,040
there and what what's going on with

86
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,000
people so much is that they're up

87
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,640
against that so it's hard

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,239
to break your vices even if you're

89
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,560
breaking coffee even if you

90
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,519
you want to break your vice you still go

91
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,080
up against this

92
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,599
michael says 11 days no coffee feeling

93
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,680
better than ever

94
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,319
incredible teresa i bought the mm-900

95
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,400
and love it i think my celery juice

96
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,319
tastes better it tastes better for me

97
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
that's what i've noticed when you have a

98
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,760
cold pressed juicer especially one like

99
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
this that squeezes all the juice out of

100
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,480
it

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,159
because it's really it's taking all that

102
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
flavor out it's like

103
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,400
removing that flavor the way it should

104
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,319
be out of that fiber and pulp and giving

105
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,920
you that straight herbal extract

106
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,440
extraction so you know vices have been

107
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,799
difficult for so many people

108
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,799
not because they're hard to break

109
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,640
even though that's one aspect of it

110
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,959
right you guys on tick tock

111
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,840
it's it's hard enough to break it break

112
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,319
a vice

113
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
right that's hard enough i get it but

114
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,799
it's not the whole

115
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,920
show it's not the whole issue

116
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,920
it's not the whole problem it

117
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,760
it's more than that it's the people

118
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,000
around us and i'm not

119
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,239
saying we should be upset about the

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,360
people around us that's not it at all

121
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,120
it's just that we're made to feel like

122
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,040
we're in the wrong doing if we're trying

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
not to have that donut

124
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,400
if we're trying not to have that you

125
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
know because

126
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
in the thing is is they got the upper

127
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,560
hand like

128
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,120
our friends our family our loved ones or

129
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,840
people

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
in at work or whatever it is right

131
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,040
co-workers

132
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,000
they got the upper edge if they're

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,479
eating all the bad stuff

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,360
or all the vice stuff they got the upper

135
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,320
edge

136
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,479
because they know like we got that

137
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,240
little voice inside of us that's saying

138
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,840
you know what i'll just do this donut

139
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,759
one more time

140
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,440
i haven't had a donut in a while let me

141
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,680
just do this cookie let me do this

142
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,360
chocolate chip cookie one more time

143
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,759
let me do this donut one more time and

144
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,840
i'll start to i'll fix it after that i

145
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,960
won't do any more after that todd says

146
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,639
what about a little

147
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,160
mushroom coffee um well the mushroom

148
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,600
thing is fine

149
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,160
the mushroom that's okay but

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
you know what what i don't like is they

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,800
take an addictive substance

152
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,039
and then they try to make you feel good

153
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,880
about that addictive substance

154
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,160
by adding something good for you like a

155
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,160
rishi mushroom or

156
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,360
chaga mushroom or some kind of mushroom

157
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,720
to the coffee

158
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,880
so if you like being totally jaked over

159
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
tricked then yeah have your mushroom

160
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,919

drink your mushroom coffee if you want

164
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,520
to be a sucker because

165
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
the industry put the mushroom coffee

166
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,720
together

167
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080

221
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,759
how we get trapped in these vices

222
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,160
because the people

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
the people around us god bless them the

224
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,440
people around us

225
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,880
have the upper hand because if they're

226
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,479
eating those donuts

227
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,720
and they're eating that sushi yeah

228
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,280
sushi's a junk food if they're eating

229
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,800
those burgers if they're eating the

230
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,560
cheese and the milk

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,120
and the bread and the pizza and they're

232
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,199
having the pizza they got the upper hand

233
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,800
they do they got the upper hand

234
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:06,000
it's important to know and that

235
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,039
upper hand is really difficult

236
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,639
on so many it really is it is

237
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,400
so i know i disappeared on you guys a

238
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,800
little bit so it's just talking about

239
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,400
how

240
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,680
the people around us that keep us on our

241
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,160
vices

242
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
have that edge and they have that upper

243
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,440
hand

244
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,560
and that's the hard part one of the hard

245
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,919
parts right there

246
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,680
you're going to see family you're going

247
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,960
to see friends you're not going to want

248
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
to turn down the donut you're not going

249
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,039
to want to turn down the bagel you're

250
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
not going to want to turn down the

251
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,320
burger or the pizza

252
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,399
certainly not the pizza right not going

253
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,959
to want to turn down the cookies

254
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,959
even if they're gluten-free cookies so

255
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,399
we're stuck

256
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,080
we're stuck in the vice you know and we

257
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,839
need family and friend many people say i

258
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
need my family and friends some people

259
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,120
say well

260
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,519
i live life alone i don't need i don't

261
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
need

262
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,560
you know family around me some people

263
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,240
i've heard this from different people

264
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,959
all through my life

265
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,839
where but you eventually run into

266
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,800
somebody

267
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,519
or someone and even if it's somebody you

268
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,360
haven't talked to

269
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,959
in so long michelle l good to see you

270
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,040
like sabotage

271
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,120
and yeah so the sabotage occurs

272
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,880
and we get tangled up in it we get

273
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,160
caught in that sabotage

274
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,640
that's exactly it i think that

275
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,560
if you're going to break a vice you have

276
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,240
to be aware of this stuff

277
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,839
you do okay no one's a bad person for

278
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,800
eating burgers and

279
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,680
for eating hot dogs and eating chicken

280
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,399
fingers and eating pizza

281
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,360
no one's a bad person for gobbling down

282
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,680
vegan cookies by the truckload

283
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,519
gobbling down all those vegan cookies

284
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,399
and chocolate chip cookies gluten-free

285
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,040
cookies

286
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,959
and cakes and doughnuts no one's a bad

287
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,480
person for eating the milk cheese and

288
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,920
the butter

289
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
it's not about that it's not about if

290
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,959
you're good or you're bad

291
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,320
it's not about that at all but we're

292
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,519
made to feel

293
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,440
bad we're made to feel bad

294
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
by the people around us a lot of times

295
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,160
if we want

296
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,760
to change the way we're doing things

297
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,440
and one of the reasons why we change the

298
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,200
way of doing things i mean you guys know

299
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,800
this you start getting sick

300
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,440
you start getting some symptoms in your

301
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,600
life lunell good to see you

302
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,720
and you start getting to a place in your

303
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
life where you're sick you've got

304
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
symptoms you're seeing doctors you're

305
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
seeing people and it's like whoa i gotta

306
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,560
get off the processed foods i gotta get

307
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,720
off the

308
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,839
fried greasy foods i have to get off of

309
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,560
this stuff

310
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,839
and we get into a place where

311
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,200
it's hard to do that with the people

312
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,839
around us and so it takes a willpower

313
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,240
takes a will power because we're going

314
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,560
to feel like we're a bad person

315
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,800
we better eat that donut we better have

316
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,279
that slice of pizza

317
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,560
but they got the upper hand our friends

318
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,240
their family

319
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,040
our loved ones that that are not

320
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,760
really that supportive of changing our

321
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,760
foods they got the upper hand

322
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,800
because man that upper hand is pretty

323
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
intense it's like

324
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,320

it's a medical device

387
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,920
juicers are medical devices so they're

388
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,279
extractors

389
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,680
for medicine did you know that when

390
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,200
big pharma did you guys know this a big

391
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,079
pharma make all their drugs

392
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,959
when they make all their drugs out there

393
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,560
right

394
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,800
did you know that they're doing

395
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,399
extractions that's what they do

396
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
they're synthesizing but they're also

397
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,279
extracting they're synthesizing they're

398
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,320
extracting

399
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,360
they're they have machines

400
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,760
in big pharma that are like juicers

401
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,760
so and they have these machines in big

402
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,360
pharma that are like juicers they're

403
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,279
medical style juicers they're geared for

404
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,040
they're small too they're like small

405
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,240
machines they have them in their drug

406
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,600
factories

407
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,079
and they're there to extract and

408
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,279
and with the alchemy that they work with

409
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,839
so

410
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,160
what people what no one gives credits to

411
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,800
juicers like this that's a medical

412
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,920
device a medical tool but it's

413
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,600
downplayed

414
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,519
that's always downplayed out there when

415
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,880
it's the one of the most important

416
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,800
critical devices in your life

417
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,399
you don't have a juicer i recommend

418
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,560
someday getting a juicer

419
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,240
if you don't get the mm 900 hds even

420
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,360
though it's on sale right now then and

421
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
you get another juicer

422
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,959
fine i want you to be able to juice

423
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,800
that's the number one goal

424
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,639
so it doesn't matter to me in the end

425
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
like what juicer you have this one just

426
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
saves me money

427
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,120
i talk about that all the time people

428
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,480

you guys when it comes down to this

440
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,079
herbal extractors what you're looking at

441

right now

442
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,480
it's extracting medicine that's why i

443
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,920
call it a medical tool a medical device

444
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,920
because it extracts medicine

445
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,279
hey how you been good good i'm about to

446
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,560
have

447
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,720
i'm about to have a hot dog

448
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,240
yeah i'm not over doing it

449
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
just once every couple of weeks i have a

450
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,839
hot dog

451
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,839
yeah it's moderation i talk about the

452
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,360
moderation thing all the time right

453
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,639
because that's what my doctor keeps on

454
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,639
telling me i can have what i want in

455
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,560
moderation

456
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,279
so i just leave it to a hot dog once

457
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,399
every couple weeks

458
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,240
i had one five days ago well i did okay

459
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,880
that's okay i'm having one five days ago

460
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,600
and having one now

461
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,360
so that's not like two every two weeks

462
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,680
but this is a different month and i just

463
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,920
i just feel like i needed that

464
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,240
yeah i'll just wait a little longer and

465
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,240
then

466
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,800
i'll wait it out and try to have my hot

467
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,240
dog a week for and a half from now

468
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,720
think i can do it well

469
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,720
the other

470
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,120
i've been having this chocolate fudge

471
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,079
ice cream

472
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,120
i'm doing two i'm doing this chocolate

473
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:23,360
fudge ice cream every two weeks

474
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,040
yeah what what's wrong with that

475
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
so if i'm doing the hot dog every two

476
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,680

477
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,839

483
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,360
my doctor said moderation works it's it

484
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,560
works so what i'm doing is i'm

485
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,560
practicing moderation

486
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,959
i'm having a pizza every two weeks a

487
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,320
chocolate fudge sundae every week and

488
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,360
i'm having a hot dog

489
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,759
every two weeks so i'm doing the

490
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,120
moderation thing really well

491
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,559
yeah i had a little cheese the other day

492
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,720
and i had some bread so that's like a

493
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,679
pizza

494
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,240
um yeah i gotta eat my chocolate fudge

495
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,600

496
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,240
moderation is yeah i could

497
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,679
look i know i'm lactose intolerant is

498
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,199
that even real

499
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:27,439
lactose intolerance i know i'm i'm

500
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,520
i shouldn't be having dairy i know

501

okay all right i gotta go

504
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,240
but vices are ridiculously hard to break

505
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,400
because of

506
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,000
people around us that's one reason why

507
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
they're really hard to break

508
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
it's not because anybody's bad it's not

509
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,559
because there's bad people around us

510
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,679
there's not because of any of those

511
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,799
reasons

512
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,919
it's because of the reason of it's they

513
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,760

514
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,840

it's not gonna hurt um

533
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
so we run into we run into this all the

534
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,520
time

535
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,799
we run into the solar panels reading

536
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,640
comments as they come up

537
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,400
death by a thousand cuts is what it ends

538
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,559
up being so we're up against the death

539
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,320
by a thousand cuts

540
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,080
so we get a job here we get a job there

541
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,840
we get a job here we get a job there

542
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,960
what are you guys doing to go against

543
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,039
those cuts what are we doing

544
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,480
dairy products feeds the pathogens that

545
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,280
are inside of us

546
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,799
so milk cheese butter will feed all the

547
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,080
bugs inside of us

548
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,480
eggs will feed the bugs inside of us

549
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,919
so all these little bugs inside of us

550
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,400
they'll get fed by

551
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,320
milk cheese and butter so you got your

552
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,880
stick of butter right here

553
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,679
viruses love butter they do

554
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,280
and it takes weeks to get the dairy out

555
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,880
so the question by the way that was a

556
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,960
really good question

557
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,080
about should i have some ice cream once

558
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,000
a week is that okay

559
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,200
or i eat ice cream once a week is that

560
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,880
okay

561
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,799
strike seven seven thanks anthony very

562
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,280
much thank you for being on here

563
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,200
so that's a really good question but it

564
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,400
takes more than a week to get the dairy

565
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,760
out of you

566
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,919
so it'll take 10 14 days

567
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,919
sometimes longer depends on how like

568
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,320
stagnant and sluggish your liver is

569
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,280
so getting that cheese out of you or

570
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,679
that

571
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,640
ice cream out of you that milk out of

572
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,640
you

573
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,160
getting that out any kind of dairy

574
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,559
product doesn't just

575
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,160
it doesn't get out in two days like i'm

576
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,000
gonna go to bathroom and it's all gonna

577
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,360
be cleaned out it just doesn't it sits

578
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,799
on the sides of your intestinal tract

579
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,120
for days and days and days

580
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,240
over a week it's there feeding all the

581
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,240
different bugs

582
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,000
all the different pathogens so if you've

583
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,080
got eczema psoriasis

584
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,080
if you've got rosacea if you have acne

585
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,400
if you have vitiligo

586
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,919
if you have any condition at all any

587
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,640
condition it doesn't matter what it is

588
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,400
whether you got

589
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,559
chronic fatigue syndrome or hashimoto's

590
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,600
thyroiditis you really don't get a good

591
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,679
chance to heal

592
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,440
because you got a dairy product in you

593
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,960
and the dairy product in you is sitting

594
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,840
there and it's feeding all the different

595
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,919
bugs

596
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,120
and it's feeding them every single day

597
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,799
and it takes days and days to get it out

598
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,039
lynette says what about organic raw

599
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,960
cheese that's the only dairy i give my

600
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,760
kids

601
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
look i look at it this way i look at it

602
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,280
this way

603
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,799
are the kids perfectly fine do they have

604
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,640
any symptoms

605
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,880
i get asked this by doctors all the time

606
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,480
too and

607
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,559
are the kids dealing with any kind of

608
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,080
condition any kind of symptom

609
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,080
so that's one thing right there so

610
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,120
that's just we can we put that into

611
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,480
consideration

612
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
because it doesn't matter if your dairy

613
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,080
is raw or your dairy is cooked your

614
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,280
dairy is pasteurized

615
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,120
it doesn't matter if your dairy has been

616
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,000
heated up in the oven doesn't matter if

617
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,039
your dairy is just

618
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,600
raw dairy it's still gonna feed

619
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,960
any bugs or pathogens so if kids have

620
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,679
rashes skin conditions

621
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,559
eczema psoriasis whether they got some

622
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,400
adhd

623
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,600
or they got some brain fog because kids

624
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,640
have brain fog

625
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,600
we don't call it brain fog with kids we

626
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,480
don't call it

627
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,679
we'll call it like attention you know

628
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,799
drifting off

629
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,760
and you know behavioral issues or

630
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,360
something and

631
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,480
we'll call it that and so it all depends

632
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
on what kind of symptoms are your

633
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,880
children

634
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,960
exhibiting what about their teeth that's

635
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,000
another one too so

636
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,559
are your children's teeth

637
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,559
or your children's teeth are they having

638
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,120
problems are the new teeth growing in

639
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,000
are the baby teeth problematic were the

640
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,640
baby teeth

641
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,400
rotting where the baby teeth getting

642
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,280
cavities

643
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,480
where the baby teeth being pulled had to

644
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,880
be pulled

645
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,679
what's going on with the baby teeth and

646
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,440
then the

647
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,200
new teeth coming in what's happening

648
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,760
with those teeth so that's a big one

649
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,880
right there

650
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,559
so if you have you have a child that

651
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,919
has teeth problems or a baby that has

652
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,360
teeth problems where the teeth are

653
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,480
coming in and we've got all these teeth

654
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,200
issues

655
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,960
then raw cheese isn't going to be a good

656
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,280
one because

657
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,520
that's how we lose our calcium too so we

658
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,200
lose our bones that way

659
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,480
so we'll talk about this right it's

660
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,679
actually a good segue into this here

661
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,360
so when mommy's really really acidic and

662
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,559
she's eating dairy and she's eating

663
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,880
cheese

664
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,840
she's losing all of her calcium that's

665
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,880
the calcium

666
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,799
the baby uses so the baby

667
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,720
get the baby's calcium comes from mom

668
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,799
having spare calcium spear calcium like

669
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,200
calcium that's derived from

670
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,679
fruits vegetables anything else that she

671
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,760
eats wild foods if she ever eats that

672
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,720
any kind of herbs if she ever takes any

673
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,320
kind of herbs

674
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,760
throughout her life right so that

675
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,679
calcium disappears

676
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,960
if everybody's acidic if mom's really

677
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,799
acidic

678
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,159
margaret says my little one was born

679
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,480
with rotting teeth

680
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,720
she had to get four cavities at one

681
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,559
years old

682
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,559
four caps at one years old four caps

683
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,640
so dr fine good to see you there

684
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,159
basically what happens is that pregnant

685
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,440
women are told to eat all the wrong

686
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,559
stuff

687
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,640
and that happens every day and then the

688
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,360
baby's teeth are gonna be problematic

689
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,600
because of that

690
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,039
so pregnant moms are told to eat dairy

691
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,320
and look there's a lot of pregnant

692
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,200
pregnant moms out there

693
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,760
they got their farms and they got their

694
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,320
instagram page and youtube page

695
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,320
and they live partially off the land and

696
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,480
they have their own milk

697
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,080
and they have their own butter they make

698
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,600
their own butter

699
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,440
and they're pregnant and they're giving

700
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,400
it to their children and they're eating

701
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,799
it and

702
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,000
they may have had good calcium storage

703
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,760
bins in them

704
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,080
starting from their childhood from their

705
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,279
mom they may have good calcium storage

706
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,200
bins maybe they don't have a lot of

707
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,679
toxic heavy metals in their system

708
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,799
because that takes away our calcium too

709
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,120
it interferes

710
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,440
but all that cheese and that milk and

711
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,840
that dairy regardless of it being

712
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,320
not like all natural where it's on a

713
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,039
farm it's raw versus pasteurized either

714
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
way

715
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,960
it's going to require that you lose all

716
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,360
that calcium inside

717
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,400
your bones you lose that inside your

718
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,559
bloodstream

719
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,559
over time and so when you're pregnant

720
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,799
what happens to a lot of babies

721
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,880
so when mom's pregnant she's eating all

722
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,080
that dairy or ate all that dairy before

723
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,279
her pregnancy

724
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,039
and there's a real serious acidic

725
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,960
environment going on

726
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,640
and then the calcium is not available

727
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,799
for the baby

728
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,480
so teeth suffer when calcium's not

729
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,600
available teeth suffer

730
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,520
so in infants that's where we we end up

731
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,120
with the teeth problems

732
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,799
we end up going into that direction

733
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,159
right there

734
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,720
so let's go let's keep on talking about

735
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,720
some other stuff

736
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,320
so when we're doing our foods when we

737
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,559
when we're doing our foods

738
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,440
like our donuts our cakes or cookies our

739
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,480
cheese

740
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,720
our milk our butter

741
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,000
we're creating this acid environment

742
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,360
from all of it

743
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,799
and that's not the only place we have

744
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,720
the acid environment we have it from

745
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,440
other places too animal approach people

746
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,919
who eat animal

747
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,120
protein i always tell them that they

748
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,279
need to balance it

749
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,360
where's your leafy greens because if you

750
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,960
just do your animal protein

751
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,640
you're doing your animal protein and you

752
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,480
only do a little bit of broccoli you

753
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,320
only do some green beans you only do a

754
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,159
little lettuce here and there

755
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,360
you only do some cauliflower rice here

756
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,799
and there but you're doing your animal

757
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,240
proteins

758
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,960
you're gonna get yourself in trouble

759
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,760
eventually because

760
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,120
you need to be buffering that with

761
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,159
something else the leafy greens are

762
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,559
critical

763
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,600
so the leafy greens are so important

764
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,200
right there

765
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,039
and what people don't realize is that

766
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,559
not enough people not not

767
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,840
people are not eating enough leafy

768
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,159
greens they're not balancing that acid

769
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,240
environment

770
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,400
and then there's all the fats so then we

771
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,919
got all that fat in the diet so that's a

772
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,080
whole other problem all on its own

773
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,039
so whether you're plant-based and you're

774
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,880
vegan

775
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,080
everybody's tanking the fats right i

776
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,440
always say you guys are fatting

777
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,360
themselves to death they're fatting

778
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,360
themselves to death

779
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,120
and as they're doing that that's a whole

780
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,600
other problem all on its own because

781
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,799
that's

782
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,559
acidic so you can be like hey i'm vegan

783
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,480
i'm plant-based i don't do the dairy

784
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,440
products i'm in the pocket right here

785
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,640
aw is going to let me off the hook i'm

786
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,880
totally cool

787
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,640
let's let the back to the landers be

788
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,039
eating they're churning their own butter

789
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,919
and

790
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,960
drinking their raw milk let other people

791
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,880
be eating their

792
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,159
store-bought cheese and stop

793
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,039
store-bought dairy that's been

794
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,360
pasteurized

795
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,720
i'm off the hook i'm vegan i'm off the

796
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,720
hook i'm plant-based

797
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,640
i don't have any problem at all that's

798
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,240
not true if you're taking the almond

799
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,919
butter the peanut butter

800
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,600
if you're eating too many walnuts eating

801
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,640
too many seeds pumpkin seeds sunflower

802
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,799
seeds every single day

803
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,799
if you're having too much oil and that

804
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,200
oil gets away from us all the time

805
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,880
if you're eating too many avocados if

806
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,720
you're doing all of this

807
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:22,399
all of that is acid it's all acid

808
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,840
fatty acids essential

809
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,320
fatty acids you're doing all your olive

810
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,200
oil

811
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,320
olive oil is acidic as heck really

812
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,360
really acidic

813
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,320
and it's acidic inside the body really

814
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,760
important to know

815
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,440
that people don't realize that they're

816
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,880
like wait a minute that's not acid

817
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,279
that's not acid

818
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,679
so we get this acidic environment when

819
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,360
we're tanking the fats

820
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,279
so what we do is we grow up we're

821
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,200
usually eating all the milk cheese

822
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,480
butter we're doing all the comfort foods

823
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,000
we're doing all the vice

824
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,600
foods we were talking about vices

825
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,640
earlier

826
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,279
we're doing all these comfort foods and

827
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,000
then

828
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,279
even when we go healthy or we're eating

829
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,840
healthier

830
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,080
we're still doing all the fat which is

831
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,960
acidic so we're basically living in this

832
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,720
acidic environment our urine stinks when

833
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,559
it shouldn't stink

834
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,919
because that's a whole other thing is

835
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,200
people's pee isn't supposed to smell

836
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,679
rancid

837
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,880
and awful like people's pee is not

838
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,640
supposed to smell

839
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,039
urine is actually not supposed to have

840
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,679
such an intense smell at all

841
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,640
but that urine is all acids so it's

842
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,000
everybody just

843
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,799
peeing that acid out urine is not

844
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,120
supposed to be yellow

845
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,279
you know it's not supposed to be yellow

846
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,520
and it's not supposed to smell

847
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,279
just so you guys know it's supposed to

848
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,760
be a light faint smell

849
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,399
and it's not supposed to be yellow all

850
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,960
that is

851
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,279
acids pouring out of us our minerals in

852
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,480
our body pouring out of us

853
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,000
that's what that is and

854
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,520
if you start eating really healthy

855
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,799
you're doing like the morning cleanse

856
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,159
you're taking care of yourself you're

857
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,000
juicing your celery juice and you still

858
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,159
have stinky pee

859
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,480
and it's really yellow now you're

860
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,320
cleansing out old stuff

861
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,679
you're cleansing out old stuff that was

862
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,520
built inside of you for years

863
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,200
what helps the acidic body what helps to

864
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,640
heal that

865
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,919
well i'm not going to say fruits and

866
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,399
vegetables because that's not going to

867
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,960
do it

868
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,000
it's not enough you need powerful herbal

869
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,640
extractions

870
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,720
like the celery juice so whether you get

871
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,960
a juicer down the road whether you get

872
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,720
some other juicer down the road whether

873
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,640
you have a juicer

874
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,640
and you're using it whatever that one is

875
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,240
that is a powerful

876
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,399
medical tool and that's one way

877
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,520
of reclaiming your health back and

878
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,880
balancing that

879
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,679
stopping the assets from injuring

880
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,720
and taking from you like neutralizing

881
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,279
those assets

882
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,200
neutralizing those acids people who got

883
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,000
eczema psoriasis skin problems health

884
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,080
conditions you're really really acidic

885
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,279
asparagus produces a smell sandra

886
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,120
yeah because it's got a chemical

887
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,520
compound that does that

888
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,720
so asparagus has a chemical compound

889
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,480
inside

890
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,960
of it that is creating that smell

891
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,960
so that's what asparagus is it's not

892
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,520
it's not causing it's not that doesn't

893
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,799
mean you're acidic but asparagus is

894
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,159
really cleansing it's very cleansing

895
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,640
if you're eating enough of it you're

896
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,720
going to be cleansing your system

897
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,720
cleansing your system we have so much

898
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,640
stuff built inside our liver spilled

899
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,159
inside of us we have so much

900
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,080
junk and garbage we have acid stored in

901
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,000
places we have salt deposits

902
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,520
that shouldn't be inside our body stored

903
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,440
in places

904
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,159
we have deposits of pesticides

905
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,039
herbicides fungicides toxic heavy metals

906
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,159
solvents household cleaners we have

907
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,520
fragrances

908
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,640
inside of us fragrances inside of us

909
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,720
i recently talked to a surgeon who has a

910
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,200
really good sense of smell incredible

911
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,480
sense of smell doesn't use fragrances

912
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:07,039
never uses fragrances and even

913
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,760
opted in in or to change the chemicals

914
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,720
that they use to a chemical that didn't

915
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,039
smell as much

916
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,880
in the or so and this surgeon

917
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,559
told me that because the the surgeon

918
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,279
doesn't use the fabric softeners

919
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,960
doesn't use all the different fragrances

920
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,240
doesn't use the chemicals doesn't use

921
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,080
chemical cleaners

922
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,320
conventional cleaners doesn't use

923
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,320
cologne or perfume no air fresheners

924
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,840
doesn't burn scented candles

925
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,039
this surgeon said that the smell of

926
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,440
patients

927
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,080
when they're saturated in scented

928
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,840
candles

929
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,679
on their skin from their house when

930
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,279
they're saturated with air fresheners

931
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,360
from their house when they're saturated

932
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,480
with all this the smell of it when

933
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,600
the surgeon cuts the patient open the

934
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,200
smell

935
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,840
it's the first time i've had a surgeon

936
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,600
ever tell me that and confirm

937
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,600
what spirit of compassion's information

938
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,760
is that that

939
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,679
you can actually smell the inside of

940
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,200
their body and smell the air fresheners

941
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,720
and smell the scented candles from the

942
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,840
inside of the body

943
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,880
and so the surgeon said that because he

944
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,200
removed

945
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,960
everything everything in his life

946
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,000
whereas house doesn't smell like any

947
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,200
chemical cleaners

948
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,360
his nose got really really sharp super

949
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,919
super sharp you guys

950
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,799
so sharp every time he cuts open a

951
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,880
patient

952
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,640
he just doesn't smell all the toxins

953
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,360
inside the body which is what

954
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,960
which has got that real gas that ammonia

955
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,399
comes out of people when you cut people

956
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,600
open

957
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,720
on the table right for surgery

958
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,480
ammonia just comes right out of them all

959
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,399
that rotting petrified flat

960
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,600
uh flesh that they've eaten that's in

961
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,159
their guts

962
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,000
all the acids that are in their blood

963
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,679
all the fat that's in their blood that

964
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,880
went rancid because it's floating around

965
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,279
their blood every day because they're

966
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,000
eating nothing but fats every single day

967
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,760
when you cut open a patient the stink

968
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
comes out of them

969
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,880
it's it's it's awful right well the

970
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,880
surgeon now

971
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,440
can smell it's not just that stink but

972
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,399
the air fresheners come out of people

973
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,880
so the air freshener coming out the

974
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,240
scented candles coming out

975
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,000
and that's what the surgeon can smell

976
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,919
so it's really incredible when you think

977
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,840
about it so when people are doing all

978
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,519
this scented candles that's inside their

979
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,120
bloodstream that's inside their liver

980
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,559
that's circulating inside of them we're

981
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,840
doing the air fresheners every single

982
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,200
day i tell people pull those air

983
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,960
fresheners out

984
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,120
people should be complaining to every

985
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,279
single clothing company

986
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,919
that sends anything that reeks but the

987
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,399
problem is people don't even smell

988
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,000
the new clothes reeking with air

989
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,039
fresheners and the factories and the

990
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,039
warehouses

991
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,799
with all that smell the chemicals on the

992
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,320
clothes people don't complain because

993
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,000
they can't smell it because they already

994
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,080
have it inside their house

995
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,840
everything stinks inside their house

996
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,200
it's all the chemical cleaners

997
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,600
conventional cleaners

998
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:00,960
detergents fabric softeners

999
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,559
so m tribe says

1000
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,320
but how are people living off the

1001
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,399
typical american diet

1002
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,000
it seems like nothing is wrong well look

1003
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,760
there are people on the typical american

1004
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,919
diet right but they end up sick

1005
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,960
they just end up sick later no one gets

1006
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,720
sick

1007
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,720
everybody gets sick with something i

1008
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,280
talk to people that are on the typical

1009
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,800
american diet sav and they've had

1010
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,760
surgeries but yeah they're fine

1011
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,639
afterwards

1012
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,079
they you know they've had their

1013
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,879
gallbladder taken out now they're back

1014
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,560
in action

1015
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,240
they've had panics removed now they're

1016
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,919
back back in action

1017
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,440
they've had some other type of surgery

1018
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,679
now they're back in action

1019
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,960
or they get sick later with chronic

1020
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,480
illness they end up

1021
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,240
feeding their pathogens they end up

1022
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,919
picking up a new pathogen they end up

1023
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,599
picking up a new epstein bar

1024
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,560
or or a shingles um

1025
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,679
ore or strep or something they pick

1026
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,480
something up

1027
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,240
and it finally tips the scale or

1028
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,159
whatever's been incubating inside of

1029
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,440
them they're fc bar for 20 30 years if

1030
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,560
they don't have an aggressive one

1031
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,119
finally it takes over or the stress plus

1032
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,640
the eff the fight or flight the caffeine

1033
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,079
finally takes over

1034
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,000
all the vinegar they've done all these

1035
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,520
years starts to break apart their teeth

1036
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,440
now they're in the dentist chair all the

1037
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,720
time getting dental work it hits all at

1038
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,320
once so many times like that with

1039
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,640
but the think about people like hey

1040
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,599
those people can eat what they want

1041
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,040
they eventually get sick and go down

1042
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,160
they eventually do

1043
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,000
and we're in a place where that's

1044
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,520
happening more than ever somebody says

1045
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,640
do celery do you support

1046
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,839
autoimmune diseases it supports it in

1047
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,760
the right direction

1048
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,920
it doesn't support the auto autoimmune

1049
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,079
disease to stay there

1050
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,760
so so what you'll see out there is all

1051
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,920
these things out there support

1052
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,240
autoimmune that's what they do apple

1053
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,359
cider vinegar supports autoimmune

1054
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,720
in keeping it there forever vinegar

1055
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,599
supports it

1056
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,280
caffeine supports caffeine supports your

1057
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,359
autoimmune disease

1058
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,680
in the opposite direction making it

1059
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,400
worse or keeping it there forever

1060
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,520
it doesn't support it getting you out of

1061
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,839
autoimmune disease

1062
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,359
caffeine doesn't pull you out of

1063
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,280
autoimmune disease

1064
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,119
the vices don't pull you out of

1065
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,119
autoimmune we keep our autoimmune you

1066
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,400
have sushi you keep your autoimmune

1067
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,920
you have some donuts you have

1068
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,599
gluten-free donuts you keep your

1069
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,040
autoimmune you have vegan donuts you

1070
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,200
keep your autoimmune

1071
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,079
you keep it there you have your burgers

1072
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,760
you have

1073
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,200
you can be in a vegan restaurant and

1074
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,480
still have one of those bean burgers or

1075
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,680
something like that but the amount of

1076
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,000
crap that's in there and the amount of

1077
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,920
fat

1078
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,680
that's in there and the msg that's

1079
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,480
hidden in there and the canola oil and

1080
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,520
anything else

1081
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,880
you're still keeping your autoimmune

1082
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,079
and so we end up keeping that autoimmune

1083
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,560
around forever

1084
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,119
celery juice helps take us out of that

1085
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,440

condition

1089
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,960
and celery juice pushes people out of

1090
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,839
that

1091
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,520

guys so

1135
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,880
it's important to know these things

1136
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,040
about getting out of that acid

1137
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,599
environment we can talk a good game we

1138
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,280
can talk about assets and alkaline but

1139
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,960
if we don't know really anything about

1140
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,560
it how can we do that so if you

1141
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,880
if you're hearing information from

1142
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,320
so-called health experts that know about

1143
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,280
alkalinity

1144
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,400
and acidity body being acidic and

1145
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,599
they're telling you to have all your

1146
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,040
avocados

1147
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,200
they're telling you to have you know all

1148
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,000
your your healthy fats you're telling

1149
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,040
you can have your peanut

1150
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,280
butter they're telling you all these

1151
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,119
things your olive oil

1152
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,240
and they're pushing it they're telling

1153
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,240
you can have your lean proteins

1154
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,599
that it's not that you can't have any of

1155
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,960
that but if you're sick and you're

1156
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,640
struggling with a symptom or you got

1157
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,560
eczema you got psoriasis

1158
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,480
you have something that you want to get

1159
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,040
rid of you have to bring down the fats

1160
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,160
because

1161
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,119
the fats are acidic it's all acid

1162
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,480
that's what the fats are it's fatty

1163
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,640
acids

1164
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,119
that's what the fats are it's all acidic

1165
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,560
so we have to learn how to bring down

1166
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,160
those fats

1167
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,000
but first things first what kind of

1168
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,040

1180
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,160

1181

let's juice a little celery now

1208
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:53,440
we're coming to the end of the sale with

1209
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:55,599
the mm-900 just letting you guys know

1210
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,680
best protocol for chronic yeast

1211
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,800
infections

1212
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,560
this is one part of it right here what

1213
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,599
is a chronic yeast infection

1214
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,880
what is it is it yeast right

1215
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,280
no it's not it's not just yeast

1216
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,480
yeast is just present with a chronic

1217
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,300
yeast infection

1218
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,560
it's just present

1219
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,599
[Applause]

1220
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,760
a yeast infection is streptococcus

1221
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:26,079
it's strep bacteria behind everything

1222
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,040
and that's why the yeast infection stays

1223
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,280
chronic

1224
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,640
because there's a bacterial infection

1225
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,720
behind there

1226
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,920
and the reason why people get rid of

1227
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,079
their yeast bacterial infections

1228
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,280
with celery juice is because celery

1229
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,119
juice kills the

1230
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,040
streptococcus bacteria behind the yeast

1231
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,640
that's why so it kills the strep

1232
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,839
bacteria behind the yeast

1233
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,839
important to know

1234
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,119
celery juice is no joke it's an herbal

1235
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,599
medicine so you're witnessing an herbal

1236
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,599
medicine

1237
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:06,240
eating celery sticks is not enough

1238
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,280
it's not enough you guys and if you're

1239
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,599
somebody who's

1240
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,280

1241
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,040

1243
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,079
you can't stop your chocolate you're

1244
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,000
still doing

1245
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,200
it you have your chocolate bars pieces

1246
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,119
of chocolate every day

1247
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,960
you better be countering those death by

1248
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,400
a thousand cuts

1249
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,920
you know when you count the squares

1250
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,880
right here it's one two three and then

1251
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,480
one two three four

1252
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,760
five six so you got three across

1253
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:38,400
you need four across 24 squares

1254
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,160
that's 24 cuts 24 cuts

1255
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,240
what are you doing to counter it what

1256
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,240
herbal medicine are you guys doing

1257
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,119
probably gonna say oh no i take my herbs

1258
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,720
by a great a great healer

1259
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:56,000
look into those herbs look into them

1260
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,440
what fillers are there is there alcohol

1261
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,119
in your tinctures

1262
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,880
that's what i love about the vimergy

1263
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,040
stuff there's no

1264
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,040
alcohol but it's even better than that

1265
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,359
there's no junk no fillers hidden in

1266
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,000
there

1267
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,560
no msg hidden in there and so that's the

1268
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,920
vimergy licorice root right there

1269
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,680
that's the dimmer to cat's claw so

1270
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:22,079
what tools are you guys using to counter

1271
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:24,800
counter the the cuts to counter the acid

1272
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,560
look i don't i don't expect anybody to

1273
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,400
do at all

1274
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,839
unless they get there and they just

1275
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,040
they're so tired of being sick and they

1276
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,760
need to go further because they're

1277
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,760
really sick

1278
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,920
i just basically i'm just in that

1279
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,079
place of what are you doing what can we

1280
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,079

1281
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,760

throughout the years

1290
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,480
they've gone vegan not because of

1291
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,000
medical medium necessarily

1292
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,079
because they're following some vegan

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,079
medium anything

1302
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:34,480
i see that all the time all the time

1303
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,480
how many natural flavors are people

1304
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,079
consuming what kind of natural flavors

1305
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,400
that's all msg

1306
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,839
what about the nutritional yeast what

1307
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,839
about that

1308
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:48,319
nutritional yeast and then the vinegars

1309
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,480
how many vinegars are you using if you

1310
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,760
have sushi if you have vegan sushi it's

1311
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,359
vinegar

1312
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,920
i can't tell you how many people

1313
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,359
go with their friends to get sushi and

1314
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,800
they get the fish free

1315
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:06,640
sushi meaning no tuna and it's

1316
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,240
loaded with vinegar and they think

1317
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,280
they think that they're all good and

1318
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,280
it's loaded with vinegar

1319
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,960
then they'll just say they're still

1320
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,240
doing the mm they're doing the mm

1321
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,240
protocol

1322
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,680
and they're not getting better so people

1323
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,800
will do that all the time

1324
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,520
and they're not even on the right

1325
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,079
supplements it's like yeah i took a zinc

1326
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,839
well not really if you're taking a zinc

1327
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,560
with all the citric acid in it and all

1328
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,680
the other crap

1329
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,079
in there and all the fillers if you're

1330
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,680
not doing like the vimergy zinc or one

1331
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,200
comparable which i haven't found one

1332
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,400
comparable but you can use whatever your

1333
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,079
doctor tells you you know do what your

1334
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,359
doctor says

1335
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,359
narasini good to see you but all these

1336
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,200
things matter so how many mm tools and

1337
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,960
where are we going with the tools like

1338
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,960
are we really using the mm tools

1339
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,160
the juicer is a critical medical medium

1340
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,520
tool

1341
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,680
and if you have your own juicer it's

1342
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,160
different than this use it that's

1343
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,599
a medical medium tool if you're using

1344
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,880
some other juicer out there it's a

1345
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,800
medical medium toll

1346
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,720
because if you need to use it as an

1347
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,640
herbal extractor

1348
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,319
and you need to extract that herbal

1349
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:14,240
medicine

1350
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:16,960
i just juiced all the celery juice right

1351
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,599
and that's that's all the pulp you guys

1352
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,839
right there

1353
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,119
that's it on tick tock check this guys

1354
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,680
check this out you guys

1355
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,200
it's in between two fingers look and

1356
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,480
it's dry

1357
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,079
it's dry that's the pulp if i squeeze it

1358
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,040
into a little ball

1359
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,800
this is incredible right here this is

1360
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,680
the most i've ever seen it get to this

1361
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,400
point

1362
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,960
that's it right there it's a little ball

1363
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,160
in my

1364
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,920
fingers you guys see that

1365
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,760
this is dry and that's a ball between my

1366
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,240
fingers i'm actually kind of blown away

1367
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,040
like i don't know how this even happened

1368
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,079
to this degree this is the best i've

1369
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,920
ever seen

1370
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,119
my juicer ever do and it always does

1371
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,480
great

1372
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:05,040
uh i'm holding between my two fingers

1373
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:07,680
this tiny little ball of dried pulp

1374
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,480
and that is what i'm talking about right

1375
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,119
there about the mm-900 hds

1376
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,640
it's 82 off it's almost 100 off and i

1377
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,079
hear people out there saying oh my god

1378
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,119
thank god i got it because i

1379
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,920
saved about basically 100 bucks and um

1380
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,839
and i got the mm-900 but it's the omega

1381
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,240
juicers.com you got to go there you guys

1382
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:29,440
omega juicers.com omega

1383
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,240
juicers.com gotta get the mm-900 hds

1384
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,520
because it's not any

1385
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,599
their their other juicers aren't going

1386
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,920
to do this they got juicers that look

1387
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,559
like this it's got to be the mm-900 hds

1388
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,640
it's not going to do

1389
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,680
what i'm doing this i can't even put

1390
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,319
this down because i don't even

1391
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,880
understand how this happened

1392
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:46,000
like that's the next level is what this

1393
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,000
is

1394
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,520
so i'm holding a tiny ball of dried pulp

1395
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,200
in between my fingers

1396
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,119
and that's how much juice i have right

1397
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,800
here

1398
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:06,400
i'm actually saving that right there

1399
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:08,160
be calling up my friends afterwards

1400
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,760
i mean it's always small and it's always

1401
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,720
dry but that was

1402
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,240
a whole other level so i'm doing a

1403
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,559
little straining right here straining

1404
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,040
the juice

1405
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,400
you have to strain your celery juice

1406
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,760
it's not going to work as good

1407
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,960
you have to strain it it's

1408
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:30,400
critical that you strain it it's giving

1409
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:35,119
everybody the 4-1-1 on that

1410
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:38,559
it's critical that you strain the juice

1411
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:41,200
so what medical tools are you guys

1412
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,319
using which medical devices are you

1413
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,880
using

1414
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,319
and people say well medical tools i got

1415
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,440
some crutches

1416
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:50,720
in the closet i got you know something

1417
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,839
else and i'm like okay

1418
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,880
a friend of mine's grandmother has a

1419
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,640
walker

1420
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,480
and i'm like i'm not talking about that

1421
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,240
medical that kind of medical tool

1422
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,280
you need the walker yes but what about

1423
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,960
something that's going to help so

1424
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,319
grandma can start walking again without

1425
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,480
the walker

1426
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,319
like we need to go into that direction

1427
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,079
like where's the medical tool

1428
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,240
in ecmo psoriasis i'll go into that a

1429
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,400
little bit celery juice

1430
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,240
is incredible because of what it does

1431
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,680
when someone has extra psoriasis

1432
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,839
so i just want to grab something real

1433
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,839
quick

1434
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,839
so when it comes down to when it comes

1435
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,839
down to someone getting

1436
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:31,839
eczema someone getting psoriasis

1437
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,839
so here's your liver right here

1438
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,359
that's your liver a right liver

1439
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,240
i should have wrote it back or actually

1440
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,000
you can see it so that's your liver

1441
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,760
if you got eczema you got psoriasis you

1442
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,400
got some kind of skin condition

1443
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,599
you even have acne there's bugs inside

1444
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,720
the liver

1445
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,599
when it comes down to eczema and

1446
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,480
psoriasis you got

1447
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,880
epstein-barr inside the liver rosacea

1448
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,800
too i've seen bar inside the liver

1449
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,760
when you have acne you've got

1450
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,920
streptococcus inside the liver

1451
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,359
your liver is a little bug holder it's

1452
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,920
the bug holder

1453
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,760
that's what your liver is it holds the

1454
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,480
bugs

1455
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,960
and those bugs start to feed off of

1456
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,079
stuff

1457
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,520
they feed off of toxic heavy metals so

1458
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,760
they feed off of those toxic heavy

1459
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,079
metals you're in medical medium school

1460
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,079
right now

1461
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:27,200
so you got the toxic heavy metals inside

1462
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,680
the liver and all those bugs feed off of

1463
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,599
that

1464
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,280
someone has eczema psoriasis the epstein

1465
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,200
bar feeds off of

1466
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,760
copper so that's what the epstein bar

1467
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,280
feeds off of

1468
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,480
so if you have epsilon bar inside the

1469
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:43,280
liver it's going to feed off of copper

1470
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,359
and then release a dermatoxin and that

1471
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,520
dermatoxin is released

1472
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,520
so we'll do a little dermatoxin coming

1473
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,960
out of here that's a dermatoxin swimming

1474
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,119
out of the liver

1475
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,480
it's heading up the highway it's getting

1476
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,559
into the bloodstream

1477
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,559
it's a derma dermatoxin right

1478
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,960
that's your dermatoxin that dermatoxin

1479
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,240
eventually finds its way to the skin

1480
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,599
and you end up with eczema or celery

1481
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,119
juice the reason why

1482
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,800
it's reversing tens of thousands of

1483
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,359
people's eczema for the good

1484
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,079
like for good re reversing eczema

1485
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:22,319
psoriasis

1486
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,359
for good forever it's because the celery

1487
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,240
juice

1488
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,520
is killing off the epstein bar inside

1489
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,000
the liver

1490
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,960
sodium cluster salts kill so the sodium

1491
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,480
remember i told you about the sodium

1492
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,079
cluster salts you got the macro

1493
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,640
sodium right the macro sodium inside the

1494
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,240
celery

1495
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,559
then you've got the subgroup sodium

1496
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,040
which is a little solar system

1497
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,119
that's your sodium cluster salts that's

1498
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,880
going around the sodium

1499
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,200
that's your medicine so when you do your

1500
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,800
herbal extraction you guys

1501
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,920
with your juicer even if it's not as

1502
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,920
good as this juicer

1503
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,200
it's not it's a crappy juicer bad juicer

1504
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,800
you're still doing a herbal extraction

1505
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,280
to some degree for sure

1506
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,079
when you do your herbal extraction

1507
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,720
you're taking

1508
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,520
that sodium cluster salt you're drinking

1509
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,680
it

1510
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,760
that's your herbal medicine so you're

1511
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,040
actually drinking consuming your herbal

1512
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,319
medicine

1513
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,240
and then that sodium cluster salt

1514
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,359
when that touches when it goes inside

1515
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,200
the liver

1516
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,559
cause here it goes goes inside the liver

1517
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,079
i don't know if this is actually working

1518
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,720
out but i think it is

1519
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:27,760
so the sodium cluster salt right there

1520
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,839
goes inside the liver

1521
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,359
right there goes inside the number it

1522
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:35,359
kills off the epstein bar

1523
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,359
so that no more dermatoxins come out

1524
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,880
of the liver no more dermatoxins come

1525
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,640
out

1526
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,400
so then your skin starts to heal your

1527
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,960
skin starts to heal your skin starts to

1528
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,559
heal

1529
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,760
some people have eczema syriza so bad

1530
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,040
and they have a stubborn epstein bar

1531
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,240
that they need to be doing some other

1532
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,280
things like i talked about in the

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,599

learn how to do it

1550
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,160
some people celery juice isn't going to

1551
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,920
be enough but you have to have a celery

1552
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,240
juice it's a critical part of it like

1553
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,760
the celery juice is like a critical

1554
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,359
piece of getting rid of that excellent

1555
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,960
psoriasis

1556
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,559
but if you have a real stubborn epstein

1557
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,240
bar and you're not doing other things

1558
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,520
then now you got to bring in other tools

1559
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,400
in the protocols and medical medium

1560
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,559
healing tools

1561
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,440
got to bring in the zinc the right kind

1562
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,359
of liquid

1563
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,200
sulfate zinc you got to bring the right

1564
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,880
kind of supplements in too

1565
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,040
but i've seen people they clean up their

1566
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,040
diet enough they get rid of their vices

1567
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,559
they're getting off the caffeine they're

1568
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,640
getting off of the milk

1569
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,880
cheese butter they're using their celery

1570
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,599
juice they're annihilating their epstein

1571
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,520
bar

1572
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,359
or if somebody's got acne they're

1573
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,240
annihilating their strep

1574
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:04,240
inside the liver and they're cleaning

1575
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,800
things up so they get rid of all that

1576
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,720
acne on their skin

1577
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,119
so you can do it the tools are there but

1578
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:14,559
celery juice is a big part of it

1579
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:16,240
so is this so when someone has a juicer

1580
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,280
is it a medical tool it's a medical

1581
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,400
device

1582
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,160
it is and it's an herbal extractor and

1583
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,200
it's helping you get rid

1584
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,720
of conditions that's what it's doing

1585
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,240
celery juice is helping reverse

1586
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,480
conditions elizabeth says

1587
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,640
elizabeth ann smith is there a reason

1588
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,920
you choose that juicer over the other

1589
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,400
omega

1590
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,640
yeah wide mouth absolutely that's not

1591
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,480
the celery juicer so the other one is

1592
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,040
not the celery juicer

1593
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,720
um and so the whole point about this

1594
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,079
juicer it's the celery juicer and it

1595
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,680
juices other

1596
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,040
stuff too it juices i love it for

1597
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,680
anything i'll juice anything in fact

1598
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,799
i'll do

1599
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,559
a juice someday with other stuff the

1600
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:56,880
reason why i choose this juicer

1601
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,160
one reason is because what you just

1602
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,319
witnessed you won't get

1603
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,720
from any other omega juicer you won't

1604
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:05,760
get a little ball

1605
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,799
of dried pulp

1606
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,720
dried fiber that's it right there

1607
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,480
you won't get that that that's not in

1608
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,079
the other juicers so if you go to

1609
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,839
omega juicers.com and you see there's

1610
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,760
another juicer for sale

1611
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,599
you're not going to be able to extract

1612
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,839
that celery juice

1613
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,839
like this there's no way so this is

1614
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,119
their celery juicer models the mm-900

1615
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,359
hds

1616
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,839
what this means is you just cut your

1617
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,880
celery in half your celery costs in half

1618
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,240
at least by a third at least by a third

1619
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,440
i've seen it where it's a half so it's

1620
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,960
half the cost

1621
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,559
the juicer paid for itself paid for

1622
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,680
itself paid for itself over and over

1623
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,119
again

1624
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,720
i mean wouldn't you tell it wouldn't you

1625
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,400
tell your friends that if

1626
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,000
something paid for itself over and over

1627
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,040
again i mean this is it right here

1628
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,119
here's the pulp

1629
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:54,559
that's it just lost it that's it

1630
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,559
all it is is that much

1631
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,319
why do i like to throw things in the air

1632
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,599

stuff in the air all the time

1636
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:09,040
i wonder what that is maybe

1637
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,280
lorraine one thing i noticed about your

together

1658
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,920
systematically by spirit of compassion

1659
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:52,160

1664
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,200
not the app uh lorraine says emote this

1665
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:06,240
is motivational

1666
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,240
it's hard to break vices when

1667
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,240
we're around family and friends we're

1668
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,920
the bad people

1669
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,000
we're the people that you know we're

1670
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,240
just causing an up eve we're making

1671
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,480
everybody feel uncomfortable

1672
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,240
is what we're doing i think what a big

1673
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,240
part of the whole vice breaking thing

1674
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,079
around loved ones and others and friends

1675
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,000
and co-workers is that

1676
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,920
yeah it's making it it's making them

1677
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,040
feel uncomfortable because they're not

1678
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,000
eating healthy or healthy enough

1679
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,559
and they're stuck on vices they're stuck

1680
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,680
on the

1681
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:40,000
you know the bad sugar the bad fat

1682
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,839
all the time they're stuck on the milk

1683
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,200
cheese the butter which is the bad fat

1684
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,240
and the bad sugar because that's all

1685
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,400
lactose

1686
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,680
the bad sugar they're stuck on the

1687
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,760
different things there's you know

1688
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,599
and they don't want to be feeling

1689
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,640
uncomfortable because you're changing

1690
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,280
your life

1691
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,640
you're working on healing you're working

1692
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,720
hard to heal

1693
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,920
they don't want to feel that they don't

1694
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,920
want to feel that

1695
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,040
shannon says oh my god yes my family

1696
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,720
thinks i'm crazy for eating healthy

1697
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,720
so you're you need to be eating some

1698
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,200
pizza shannon i think that's what it is

1699
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,880
right

1700
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,559
you need to eat a donut in front of them

1701
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,040
is that what you have to do is you have

1702
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,280
to

1703
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,359
you have to throw yourself on the line

1704
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,280
for them is that what you have to do

1705
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,480
you have to eat a pizza in front of them

1706
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,160
right you gotta

1707
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,839
you gotta prove yourself do you have to

1708
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,359
prove yourself you have to prove

1709
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,680
yourself because that's what we feel

1710
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,319
like

1711
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,760
we're told to feel that way we're pushed

1712
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,240
into feeling that way that now we have

1713
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,079
to

1714
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,319
we have to do it for them like let's

1715
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,760
take a hit for them

1716
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,280
even though it's not going to make you

1717
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,240
healthy which isn't going to be good for

1718
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,319
friends and family

1719
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,280
if you're not healthy but i better take

1720
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,280
this hit for them

1721
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,680
and it's it's unfair really when you

1722
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,480
think about it

1723
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:53,520
so so you'll end up being in put to a

1724
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,240
place where you're being pushed into

1725
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,839
having to eat the foods that aren't good

1726
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,599
for you that you know and your heart and

1727
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:01,839
soul aren't good for you

1728
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,200
but they always have the upper hand tic

1729
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:06,319
toc says no more

1730
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,319
they always have the upper hand and the

1731
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,720
upper hand is

1732
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,720
it's hard to break these foods it's hard

1733
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,440
we've been raised on them we have

1734
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,960
these are comfort foods we've had these

1735
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,240
comfort foods in our system

1736
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,960
for in a long many many years we've

1737
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,400
lived with them

1738
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,559
we know what these comfort foods feel

1739
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,480
like inside of us they store

1740
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,480
away inside our organs deep in our

1741
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,400
organs they store away

1742
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,240
and people don't realize that aspect of

1743
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,559
it too when you eat

1744
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:39,359
all the comfort foods the comfort foods

1745
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,240
are stored deep in organ tissue they

1746
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,440
become

1747
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,040
part of the tissue something to know

1748
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,799
that's really important

1749
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,400
so when you're eating all the milk

1750
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,079
cheese butter

1751
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,400
when you're eating when you have all the

1752
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,960
msg when you're doing all the

1753
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,720
msg deposits in the brain it deposits

1754
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,640
inside the liver

1755
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,240
these things become part of our cells

1756
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,520
and then we walk around with all this

1757
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,920
baggage

1758
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,520
of the past inside of us we walk around

1759
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,760
with all this baggage

1760
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,760
all the baggage of the past is inside of

1761
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,839
us

1762
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,599
something to consider right there so

1763
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:17,680
anyway talk about the

1764
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:20,880
hcs breaking the eczema

1765
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:24,079
breaking it breaking psoriasis

1766
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:27,280
breaking conditions breaking

1767
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,720

1768
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,119
worried about sun spots

1769
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:33,040
so i've seen celery juice reverse

1770
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,880
wrinkles in people

1771
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,240

of all kinds and that's just some that's

1775
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,480
just one part not even talking about the

1776
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,480
lupus and the lyme disease the

1777
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,079
neurological lyme and

1778
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,160

1779
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,079
autoimmune in general you guys

1780
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,079
a lot of people don't even get a

1781
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,880
diagnosis anymore

1782
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,760
they get just an autoimmune label go to

1783
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,400
your doctor they're

1784
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,440

you an individual

1789
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,559
an individual diagnosis anymore i've

1790
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,160
seen that out there now

1791
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,359
so a lot of doctors are sending people

1792
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,480
out the door they're not saying they

1793
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,160
have lupus

1794
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,760
they're not saying they got neurological

1795
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,319
lyme they're sending them out the door

1796
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,960
with just

1797
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:23,040
autoimmune when it's when it's mild in a

1798
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,240
lot of people

1799
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,040
near xenia says i'm 20 years younger so

1800
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,000
lorraine says i love mm info anthony and

1801
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,000
the juggling

1802
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,359
doing a lot of juggling today trying to

1803
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,880
get my words right

1804
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:37,040
good thing spirit of compassion is here

1805
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,920
to help so let's give you guys the quick

1806
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,359
takeaways real quick okay

1807
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,200
you're gonna feel pressure from the

1808
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,480
people around you when it comes down to

1809
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,240
the vices

1810
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,920
breaking vices is hard because that's

1811
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,440
one of the big reasons why it's hard

1812
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,960
if you don't have any of that pressure

1813
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,400
around you it's hard enough

1814
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,520
it's hard enough even if you don't have

1815
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,119
all the family and the friends and the

1816
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,039
co-workers and anybody else

1817
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,200
that's around you pushing you into

1818
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,640
eating that acidic acidic acidic diet

1819
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:04,240
the other takeaway is

1820
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:07,760
acid the fats are the acid too

1821
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,400
fatty acids all that fat in the

1822
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,319
bloodstream makes you terribly acidic

1823
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,760
if you're plant-based you're eating your

1824
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,839
avocados every day

1825
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,119
and you want to become alkaline you're

1826
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,720
losing your chance

1827
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,240
so you got to slow down you got to have

1828
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,839
a little avocado here

1829
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,079
you gotta have just you know little nut

1830
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:25,920
butter here gotta have a little bit of

1831
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:28,400
olive oil here but you gotta be careful

1832
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,000
another thing is the big acid ones

1833
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,920
apple cider vinegar the coffee the

1834
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,599
caffeine don't get tricked by the

1835
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,280
mushroom coffee

1836
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,200
basically it's they're drug dealers

1837
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,480
right now out there it's it's it's

1838
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,160
unbelievable what's happening and

1839
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,119
they're turning good people into drug

1840
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,119
dealers

1841
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,799
because there's the mlm marketing scheme

1842
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,839
with the mushroom coffee

1843
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:49,440
and if you stick coffee with anything

1844
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:51,680

1885
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,960
what

1886
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,119
foods are they still bringing in where's

1887
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,599
the nutritional yeast which is the bad

1888
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,119
stuff

1889
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,480
how much vinegar are they doing how much

1890
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,680
chocolate can they break the chocolate

1891
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,960
they're doing chocolate every couple

1892
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,720
weeks and you need to heal and you're

1893
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,880
seriously sick it's not going to happen

1894
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,559
and how many fats were you on medical

1895
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,960
medium teaches you to keep the fats low

1896
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,280
and everything

1897
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,559
so lunell correct i don't recommend

1898
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,480
coffee enemas it's one of the worst

1899
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,400
things you can do

1900
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,400
damage is the central nervous system

1901
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,119
actually damages it because the stomach

1902
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,440
buffers the caffeine and you can't

1903
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,280
buffer it when it goes up the back end

1904
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,960
so it goes straight to the nerves and it

1905
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,200
injures the nerves

1906
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,799
because so keep that in mind it also

1907
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,760
injures the adrenals when you do coffee

1908
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,799
enemas

1909
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,960
you're injuring the adrenals and

1910
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:51,839
adrenals are precious you guys i'm
