needling not a good thing you don't want

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,880
to miss this little episode here because

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,920
we're going to talk about a Skin Potion

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,079
I'm going to make it in front of us

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,920
right here which you see is micro immune

29
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,079
power right here in my hand so I just

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,200
want to show you it's one thing right

31
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,799
there what you also see is the vimergy

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,399
mm right there okay and this is going to

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,240
be very interesting cuz I'm going to

34
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,759
show you guys what I'm going to make and

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,240
why it's important because right there

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,719
you're talking about the collagen

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,680
Builder the micro immune power with the

38
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,320
organic bamboo

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,320
silica you can't fix the skin from the

40
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,360
outside by the way you guys know I work

41
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,200
with

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,159
vimergy you can't fix the skin from the

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,360
outside we can try all all we want we

44
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,520
can try our hardest we can do everything

45
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,599
we can slather all kinds of stuff on our

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,680
bodies we can be slathering all kinds of

47
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,800
essential oils we can get ourselves

48
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,720
soaking wet with oil and everything and

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,760
hop in bed at night we can do a seaweed

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,879
wrap with oil all over us hop in bed at

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,800
night wake up in the morning and do it

52
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,120
again the next day we can put whatever

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,000
we want on the surface of our skin it's

54
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,840
not going to be enough it's not going to

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,239
fix the elasticity problem that people

56
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,280
get this is important the reason why I'm

57
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,480
even doing this right now is because oh

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239
my God if I hear it one more time my

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,680
skin my skin medical medium my skin what

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,239
do I do hey medical medium I just found

61
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,239
your book and I have skin problems

62
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,000
what's the best route to go like it's a

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,080
skin skin skin and what about stretch

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,480
marks why do we get stretch marks and

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,560
why do they stay there people gain

66
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,280
weight they lose the weight and the

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,760
stretch marks are there how how do we

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,599
best help those stretch marks heal and

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,840
do their thing all this matters you have

70
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,959
to build the skin from the inside out

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,959
it's critical mm info for

72
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,959
years Delia says yeah my sister really

73
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,080
messed her skin on her face up by doing

74
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,840
micro needling she has a lot of

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,799
discoloration from it too so I want to

76
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,680
talk about that with the if you've done

77
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,040
the micro needling and hey you might not

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,959
be off the hook right there I want to

79
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,280
talk about this isn't about tattoos

80
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,879
being bad or good but I want to talk

81
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,680
about instead of what I've always talked

82
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,760
about right about ink I want to talk

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,519
about the surface of the skin I want to

84
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,200
talk about that with the inks if you're

85
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,599
some of dealing with tattoos and you've

86
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,239
done all this kind of ink and you've

87
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,959
done whatever maybe you just got a

88
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,799
little bit of ink behind your ear maybe

89
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,599
you have it on the back of your neck

90
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,079
maybe you shaved your head one day and

91
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,079
you have it on your head maybe you got

92
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,280
it on your leg maybe you got it on your

93
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,519
lower back wherever the ink

94
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,840
is the skin gets affected so I want to

95
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,360
kind of give you guys a oneone on what

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,360
happens when we have Micro injuries on

97
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,519
our skin and how that plays a role on

98
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,880
all of our skin did you hear that so

99
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,400
when you're micro needling your face

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,639
right which don't do and you can do

101
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,600
whatever you want I'm just saying I tell

102
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,080
my family and friends don't do with the

103
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,080
micro needling but what happens is your

104
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,440
skin is the whole organ that's the big

105
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,039
old organ right that's your

106
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:45,000
organ and if you let's take an example

107
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:47,880
here if you hurt a part of your

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,400
stomach a little part of it the entire

109
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,720
stomach gets

110
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,520
affected if you hurt a little part of

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,639
your liver the entire liver gets

112
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,479
affected if you hurt a little part of

113
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,039
your

114
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:07,320
skin the entire organ gets affected by

115
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:09,960
it it compromises the entire organ your

116
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,199
skin and so it's critical to be doing

117
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,680
the right stuff it's critical to build

118
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,280
up that collagen From the Inside Out

119
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,960
heal up the skin from the

120
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,360
inside

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,160
out not from the outside in I know so

122
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,080
many of us is always like outside in

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,560
outside in outside

124
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,759
in really it's inside out that's the key

125
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,199
so I want to talk about we're going to

126
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,240
make we're going to make a Skin Potion

127
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:40,000
right here I'm excited about that this

128
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:43,080
is the vimergy micros immune power with

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,919
the organic bamboo

130
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,400
silica this is the vimergy MSM with the

131
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,039
bamboo silica we're going to be joining

132
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:58,479
these two we're going to be putting

133
00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:01,400
these two together and vimergy is going

134
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,800
to give any anyone who's actually

135
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:09,160
getting this a free lemon balm and 5%

136
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,880
off of the MSM on top of it so the free

137
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,199
lemon bomb which is nerves and nervous

138
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,880
system which believe it or not when

139
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,000
you're dealing with nerves and your

140
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,680
calming nerves it's helpful for what

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,800
it's helpful for your skin I'll talk

142
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,120
about that in a little bit too so this

143
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,039
is really exciting Wendy says my skin is

144
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,319
now better than ever following medical

145
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,720
mean and protocols look

146
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,720
medical meum protocols have always been

147
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,240
incredible for the skin but a lot of

148
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,880
people they have skin injuries and don't

149
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,639
realize this they just have all these

150
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,479
kind of micro injuries on their SK

151
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,960
mosquito bites create micro injuries on

152
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,880
the skin course acne creates micro

153
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,160
injuries on the skin micro needling

154
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,800
creates mic micro injuries on the

155
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,639
skin small tattoos all around the body

156
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,360
or large tattoos create all kinds of

157
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,199
injuries to the Skin So and the skin

158
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,240
gets

159
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,440
affected on the

160
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,639
hole on the

161
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,800
hole well don't worry I just only did it

162
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:22,520
here or don't worry I've only micro

163
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,520
needled here but the skin gets affected

164
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,319
everywhere because it is the organ it

165
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,039
feels it everywhere it knows it

166
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
everywhere

167
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,319
and so that's

168
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,199
important so I want to just cover all

169
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,960
that plus a bunch of others you guys

170
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:43,280
just got here right we're talking about

171
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,280
the skin we're talking about a Skin

172
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,199
Potion the micro C and we're talking

173
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,360
about the MSM combined so I'm going to

00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:56,879
show you the potion combined right we're

175
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,199

we're talking about the MSM no caking

177
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,360
agents no

178
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,720

179
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,440
no one realizes all the powders they get

180
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,840

think that's the serious thing out there

256
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,000
it's serious because it's in the mindset

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,959
of the supplement World about eating

258
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,160
liver and fixing your liver about eating

259
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,560
something and fixing it that's what

260
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,200
we're taught out there and it's Insanity

261
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,600
it's actually

262
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,160
Insanity for some reason people in

263
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,920
health whoever actually supports it

264
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,720
which there's tons of people out there

265
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,480
they've lost their minds because you

266
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:00,959
cannot eat skin to fix your skin you

267
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,959
can't eat collagen to fix your

268
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,680
collagen millions and millions and

269
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,240
millions of bottles and jars and

270
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:14,320
packages of collagen have been sold to

271
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:16,720
the suckers for years that's right

272
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,839
millions billions of dollars have been

273
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,839
made off of

274
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,000
collagen and everybody or almost anybody

275
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,880
and

276
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,079
everybody has purchased that thinking

277
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,480
they're going to actually build their

278
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,480
collagen how how many years have you

279
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,680
seen it how many people do you know were

280
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,720
putting collagen inside their smoothies

281
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,720
and collagen inside mixes tell me have

282
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,160
you done it how many people do you know

283
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,160
how many ads have you seen how much

284
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,120
information is out there about collagen

285
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,320
and taking collagen to help your

286
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,399
collagen you've seen

287
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:56,440
that it doesn't work you can't take

288
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,800
collagen and fix your collagen you can't

289
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,519
take a beef liver and fix your liver you

290
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,519
can't eat somebody's pancreas to fix

291
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,639
your pancreas you can't do it and you

292
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,079
can't eat somebody's nose to fix your

293
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,360
nose and you can't eat their damn ear to

294
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,040
fix your ear it doesn't happen it

295
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,480
doesn't work and the reason why I'm

296
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,839
saying this is because collagens don't

297
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,760
work out

298
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:24,399
there and so if you're looking at skin

299
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,720
cuz I'm I'm driven mad about skin stuff

300
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,600
I hear it all the time like my skin my

301
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,199

304
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,519

305
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,279
collagen if you're somebody that's

306
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,199
worried about skin you have to build and

307
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,279
repair from the inside out and it has to

308
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,560
be stuff that's potent and Powerful the

309
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,040
building blocks have to be there that's

310
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,440
really important the building blocks

311
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,920
have to be

312
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,959

ink not the normal Ink Show though we're

378
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,519
talking about the actual skin that gets

379
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,160
scarred when we get ink because of the

380
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,160
needle going

381
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,439

want something cool written what kills

389
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,559
you does what kills you makes you

390
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,600
stronger what what is it that you want

391
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:41,039
on there I'm not judging anybody I'm

392
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,840
just saying that as an organ as a whole

393
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,919
the whole organ senses anything that

394
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,200
happens to it you know if something if

395
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,880
you get pinched here you get a mosquito

396
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:57,280
bite here your entire

397
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:01,919
organ is in the no it's actually in the

398
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:05,039
know of it you do some micro needling or

399
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,320
you try some other exfoliation it's

400
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,440
another thing

401
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,760
too for years I've watched people get

402
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,760
exfoliated to

403
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,600
death the

404
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,919
exfoliations you got to be cautious on

405
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:26,039
how deep those go how rough those

406
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,000
are and you got to be careful or you got

407
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,799
to be doing stuff from the inside out to

408
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,960
help repair and take care

409
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,960
of all

410
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:40,000
right I got a little skin tissue model

411
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,559
right

412
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,520
here when it comes down to skin repair

413
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:51,960
it has to start from deep down into the

414
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:56,120
Derma it has to be down deep in the

415
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:59,080
Derma here we got to go low you want to

416
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,919
work on skin and keep skin good good you

417
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,360
don't want stretch marks taking over

418
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,640
when you gain weight and then you lose

419
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,720
the weight and you lost all the L right

420
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,679
elasticity of the skin and you got the

421
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,360
skin is is way too

422
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,760
played and it's not bouncing back and

423
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,559
everybody's trying to get the tummy

424
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,880
tucks and they're trying to get all the

425
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,760
different surgeries and Tucks their skin

426
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,640
won't work with them or maybe you just

427
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,120
gained a little bit of weight and then

428
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
you got the stretch marks from a little

429
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,000
bit of

430
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,280
weight the way we have to address all of

431
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
this is always remember no matter what

432
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,080
that when we're addressing skin it has

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,960
to be from the bottom up it has to be

434
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,400
from the ground up so from the ground up

435
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,919
it can't be

436
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:56,159
surface it can't even be follicle

437
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,280
level it has to be right at the base

438
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:02,320
which is what I call the foundation of

439
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:07,840
of your skin deep within the Derma and

440
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:11,000
right under the Derma right under the

441
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,200
skin it's like when you peel that skin

442
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
off of a

443
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,480
chicken when you peel that chicken skin

444
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,960
off of a

445
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:26,880
chicken you want to go between that

446
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,200
bottom layer of that skin to the flesh

447
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,200
basically we're talking about

448
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,240
building that

449
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,559
deep that

450
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,520
deep cuz I know that a lot of people

451
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,480
don't realize how it works with the skin

452
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,159
they think it's either surface or just

453
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,320
below the surface it's

454
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:53,960
not if you want skin stuff to happen

455
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,159
it's got to be Boom at the root at the

456
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,480
root and not at the root of a follicle

457
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,799
we got to go even deeper than that we

458
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,080
have to go under the follicle it has to

459
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,159
be down there and it has to be so deep

460
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,840
where literally it's just under the

461
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,520
first layer of Derma it's actually just

462
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,760
under so it's between that first layer

463
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,520
of Derma and basically everything else

464
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,799
in your body it's between

465
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,760
there and that's key and I want people

466
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,799
to know

467
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,440
this it's not out the it's not on the

468
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,880
outside it's not down under underneath

469
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,520
the outside it's down so

470
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,159
low it's

471
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,080
basically at the bottom and then even

472
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:44,120
under that where

473
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:47,320
there's fluid to your actual physical

474
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,360
body Ashley says okay so how do we get

475
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,559
to the

476
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,640
root so important to know right it's all

477
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,200
about

478
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:01,640
immune power it's all about immune

479
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:05,240
system our immune system patrols that

480
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:09,480
area our immune system needs

481
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,960
antioxidants in that area antioxidants

482
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,799
are one of the critical

483
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,000
Builders right there silica one of the

484
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,840
critical

485
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,880
Builders stopping oxidative stress

486
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:31,000
because oxidative stress lands in the

487
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,000
Deep depths of the skin oxidative

488
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,760
stress fight ORF flight every time I see

489
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,600
anybody in fight or flight or know

490
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,039
somebody's in fight ORF flight or I'm in

491
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,000
fight or flight I'm thinking skin I'm

492
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:51,080
like my Skin's going to pay the

493
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,080
price my Skin's going to age

494
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,600
overnight my Skin's going to take the

495
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,960
hit anytime I see anybody talking about

496
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,159
fight ORF flight or anything happen

497
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,679
happening fight ORF

498
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:05,919
flight first thing I think about is skin

499
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:09,080
I'm like skin whoa whoa that was really

500
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,279
stressful skin whoo because what happens

501
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,679
is and when you're in firefight and all

502
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,360
that epinephrine is just coursing

503
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,799
through the body it's so corrosive it's

504
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,919
like battery acid when we're under

505
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:26,120
stress oxidative stress

506
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,200
oxidizing it winds up trying to find

507
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,840
itself escaping through your skin when

508
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,400
you're under stress and you're going

509
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,000
through all this stuff emotionally

510
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,799
mentally you might stink

511
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,559
more you might stink

512
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:42,559
more you're under stress you start

513
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,279
stinking in the armpits you start

514
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:49,559
sweating it starts to wreak you're under

515
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,559
you have a really stressful day you're

516
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,559
stinking so Manny says is that why we

517
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,400
look terrible after something stressful

518
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:02,080
exactly the skin takes a hit

519
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,120
when we're up against oxidative stress

520
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,720
that's why it's critical to battle

521
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,360
oxidative sh

522
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,720
stress using sh for a second which is my

523
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,200
next thing I want to talk about by the

524
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,799
way that's why but it's critical to know

525
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
that when you're up against that stress

526
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,200
and you're up against all that different

527
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,600
emotional turmoil or something's

528
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,640
happening or it's losses or something's

529
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,159
going on in your life you don't feel

530
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,840
like you're getting enough wins in your

531
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,080
life you got people breathing down your

532
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,039
neck You' got psychic attacks coming

533
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,559
whatever it is that you're dealing with

534
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,919
it's that kind of stress that's

535
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,840
producing that kind of epinephrine that

536
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,080
is coursing through the veins and the

537
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,640
bloodstream and it winds up trying to

538
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,320
escape through the skin desperately and

539
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,520
rise out of

540
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,159
it which leads to the next part I'm

541
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,480
trying to talk about which then we get

542
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,799
in trouble if we're if we're challenged

543
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,039
like that our immune system is

544
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,919
challenged we end up getting in a a

545
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:03,200
place where bugs that reside inside of

546
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,159
us start to rise up a little bit

547
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,840
remember you're looking at here immune

548
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,360
so you're looking at the micro and

549
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,880
you're seeing immune immune system we're

550
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,320
up against all this oxidative

551
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,120
stress our immune system drops all that

552
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,720
adrenaline's coursing through our veins

553
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,960
leaking up through the skin that's why

554
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,840
we have a bad skin looking day when

555
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,279
we've been through hell and back with

556
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:34,000
stress and then bugs want to

557
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:36,720
play well my acne is really coming out

558
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,960
bad I don't know my acne is really bad

559
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,320
these days pimples they're coming out

560
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,080
all this kind of

561
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,679
stuff and that's where oxidative strep

562
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,600
comes

563
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:55,840
in that's where oxidative strep comes

564
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,679
in so what I love about the Skin Potion

565
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,919
I'm

566
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,520
showing which I'm going to show you guys

567
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,760
I'm going to make it in front of you in

568
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,200
a minute it's simple it's easy it's fun

569
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,279
actually tastes good everything's great

570
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,600
what I'm showing you is immune system

571
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,919
and then building blocks for

572
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,200
skin immune system building blocks for

573
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,600
the

574
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,200
skin we're up against a little too much

575
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,279
stress we're in fight or flight we got

576
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,000
the adrenals pumping the adrenaline's

577
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:28,640
corrosive it's going through the veins

578
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,240
it's surfacing through the skin it's

579
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,600
leaking out of our pores and it stinks

580
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:40,600
and it's corrosive and it smells and

581
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:43,480
it's leaking out of our our armpits it's

582
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,440
everywhere and it smell it's on our

583
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,880
feet it's why people's feet can smell

584
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,399
really bad from fight or flight all that

585
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,640
stress and all that adrenaline soaking

586
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:57,200
and purging through her body and can

587
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,360
make your feet really smell Christy says

588
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I've had the the flu these past 3 days

589
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,200
my skin looks

590
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,320
horrible and that's why I was saying we

591
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:11,679
get stressed out our immune system drops

592
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,120
pathogens can raise up like the

593
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,760
strep adrenaline courses through our

594
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,600
body we need immune system support and

595
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,120
we need skin support and that's what the

596
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,640
micro C

597
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,919
is there's Rhyme or Reason here this

598
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,760
isn't like a supplement and I'm trying

599
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,600
to so a supplement that's insane there's

600
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,600
Rhyme or Reason to why things are

601
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
powerful and

602
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,559
helpful we're stressed

603
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:46,120
out our body starts to break down

604
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,720
oxidative stress starts to

605
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:52,559
occur our cells start to take the hit

606
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,600
free radicals start to rise up and

607
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,039
saturate cells adrenaline starts to move

608
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,120
all through the bloodstream

609
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:04,480
and puts stress on our

610
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,519
Landmark which is

611
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,120
this the bottom of our

612
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:14,120
Derma so we're going through

613
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,679
life if you had a hard life and haven't

614
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,720
had a chance to protect yourself protect

615
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:22,000
your skin and if you've had a hard life

616
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,480
the skin will show it the skin will show

617
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,799
it if you haven't had a chance to

618
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,640
protect yourself and all of this as it's

619
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:33,399
happening will actually go and hit the

620
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,640
bottom of the

621
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:36,640
Derma the

622
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,840
sponge so I want to show you something

623
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,840
really

624
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:49,960
quick so the bottom of the

625
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,919
Derma acts as a

626
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,640
sponge that's what it acts as take a

627
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,000
look at this sponge right here in my my

628
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:04,360
hand if you can okay I'll show you guys

629
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,720
on Tik Tok show you guys on IG see this

630
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:10,519
sponge right

631
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:15,320
here sponge is actually absorbing our

632
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:18,799
skin goes up and down it

633
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,559
absorbs like a sponge you don't hear

634
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,240
this out there you won't hear this out

635
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:28,080
there of course mm

636
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,919
info but what it does is it acts as a

637
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,200
sponge see the bottom of the Derma right

638
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,159
there and you see the sponge I'm holding

639
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,679
right

640
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,559
here when you're under stress all those

641
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,720
free radicals are pouring through your

642
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,279
system along with that adrenaline

643
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,279
emotional

644
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,519
challenges what's happening is the

645
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,559
bottom of your Derma right underneath

646
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:52,360
there is starting to soak it all up it's

647
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,360
soaking up the

648
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,159
adrenaline and as it soaks up the

649
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,760
adrenaline it tries to rid it as quick

650
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:05,840
as it

651
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,399
can we got a little camera action going

652
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,399
here let's see what we can

653
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,120
do we're having fun

654
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:17,279
today this is this is an advanced skin

655
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,360
course right here just so you know

656
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,519
you're not going to learn this stuff

657
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,000
anywhere else you're not going to see it

658
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,440
anywhere else it's an advanced skin

659
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,120
course on how it works with your skin

660
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,360
plus stress plus adrenaline so the

661
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,480
bottom of your Derma right here right

662
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,559
where your skin even starts and even

663
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,799
before it starts right before that deep

664
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:38,720
layer even

665
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,960
starts that area right there acts as a

666
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,399
sponge that's what it does that's why

667
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,000
you can get dehydrated if you get

668
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,279
dehydrated your skin feels dehydrated

669
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,919
did you ever see that where you're

670
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:49,799
really dehydrated you ever run into

671
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,519
somebody and you can pinch their skin

672
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:55,840
and nothing bounces back you pinch their

673
00:30:52,519 --> 00:31:00,639
skin nothing bounces back like you pinch

674
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,279
it and it's like stuck or halfway stuck

675
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:04,399
did you ever see that you guys where you

676
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:08,600
pinch their

677
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:11,799
skin because the Derma at the base is a

678
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,880
sponge basically it's sitting there and

679
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,279
it it's

680
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,960
absorbing and then it's

681
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,360
releasing it sponges up all the

682
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,720
adrenaline from flight uh fight ORF

683
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,799
flight right here all the adrenaline

684
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,159
from any kind of emotional stress

685
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,159
whatsoever it sponges it up

686
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,639
and then it tries to push it through the

687
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,639
surface of the skin if it

688
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:38,120
can and here's the thing you might be

689
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:40,000
some of you exercise a lot you're like

690
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,679
well I sweat it all out I exercise I

691
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,080
sweat it all out that's

692
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,639
great that's great all that adrenaline

693
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,960
you're yeah coursing through with all

694
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:52,519
that sweat that's right right through

695
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,919
your skin tissue then what are you doing

696
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:57,679
to protect your skin and collagen

697
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,200
because guess what that is damaging to

698
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,760
the skin I'm not saying exercise is

699
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,480
damaging I'm saying in general as all

700
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,320
that oxidative stress and adrenaline and

701
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,039
free radicals go rushing through that

702
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,480
sponge inside the Derma inside the skin

703
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:12,200
and it forces its way through the skin

704
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,679
what are we doing to protect the skin

705
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,679
because that's how our skin ages really

706
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,679
quick and really

707
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:24,039
fast and what are people going to do

708
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,840
they're going to micro needle they're

709
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:28,360
going to exfoliate the crap out of their

710
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,000
skin skin their

711
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,080
exfoliations left and right they're

712
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,320
going to try scrubs they're going to be

713
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,880
scrubbing their skin left and right

714
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,480
because that's what they're going to do

715
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,279
and I understand why and then they're

716
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,960
going to use all kinds of different

717
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,080
ointments and different creams that have

718
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,760
all kinds of fragrances in them that

719
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:53,120
hurt our

720
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:57,000
skin once again it's from the inside out

721
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:00,480
and it's about getting to the deep under

722
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,880
underneath layer into that sponge into

723
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,840
that Derma right here okay I'll move

724
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,120
this here so you guys can see a closeup

725
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:13,919
down here it's about that layer right

726
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:17,519
there you see it underneath the

727
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,840
folicles way further deep underneath the

728
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,639
follicles that's where it

729
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:28,039
counts that's how you heal the surface

730
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:32,840
that's how you heal the middle it has to

731
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:35,000
be addressed right here at the base and

732
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,559
we can't control every situation we

733
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,880
can't control the stress runder the

734
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,279
oxidative stress we can't control

735
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,000
someone else and what they do we can't

736
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:49,440
control the weather we can't control a

737
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,840
hurricane we can't control the evil that

738
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,120
happens on this planet and there's a lot

739
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,080
of evil happening on this planet we know

740
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,360
that can't control any of that

741
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,159
but so many people are worried about

742
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,200
their skin I hear it until the cows come

743
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:08,839
home every single day out there and so I

744
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,320
wanted to talk about it a little bit

745
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:14,040
because I see the confusion out there

746
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,440
about skin it's vast it's great the

747
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,159
confusion and I want to talk about why

748
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,040
our skin falls apart from stress and if

749
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,119
we're not doing anything for the stress

750
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,480
and here's why I like this take a look

751
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,520
this is the whole point here I'll get a

752
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,440
closeup on this as well here's why I

753
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,440
like this the micro immune power you put

754
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,399
this with the MSM and I'm going to do it

755
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,159
right now and make a potion you put this

756
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,440
together you're talking about that

757
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,320
organic bamboo silica you're talking

758
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,879
about the two types of vitamin C that

759
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,119
doesn't Scorch your stomach

760
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:51,399
lining it's buffered it's not like that

761
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,879
ascorbic acid out there that tears

762
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:55,720
people's guts up right it makes people

763
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:57,320
get the runs and the diarrhea and it

764
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,680
makes them not feel good and you can't

765
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,160
take enough of it and I'm not talking

766
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,000
about that other junk too that ascorbic

767
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,000
acid that's in the fat

768
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,960
lipids uh good luck getting that vitamin

769
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,320
C to

770
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,800
cells that's awful and there's no

771
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,599
anti-caking agents in here this stuff is

772
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,960
pure and that right there is incredible

773
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,680
and what do you do you're battling

774
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,320
stress with all of it you're supporting

775
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,200
the immune system you got building

776
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,040
blocks for the collagen right there

777
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,359
you're not getting fooled or tricked or

778
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,640
duped and sold collagen which as I said

779
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:38,680
before doesn't fix collagen or create

780
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,079
collagen and then you got the silica

781
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,800
which is critical for the skin and the

782
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:47,040
Derma and then combined with the

783
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,400
oxidative free radical breaker which is

784
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,240
the vitamin C and the two kinds of

785
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,800
vitamin C that's buffered and you

786
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,160
combine that with the lemon balm for the

787
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,319
nervous

788
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,839

let's get the stomach out of here

802
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,839
little bit maybe we'll move the liver as

803
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,640
well I'm going to eat liver like a

804
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,319
[ __ ] all

805
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,960
right now look I get it people like to

806
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:52,400
taste the liver it's it's it's a food

807
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,920
for survival back years ago back if you

808
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,000
go 100 years ago and you ran out of meat

809
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,040
but you had a de hydrated liver you

810
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,960
better believe it you're going to be

811
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,960
eating that liver for

812
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:08,040
survival for survival you'll eat

813
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,680
dirt you'll eat anything but it's a bad

814
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,640
idea it's filled with toxins the liver

815
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,920
is filled with so many toxins you know

816
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,480
when I see people like dehydrated liver

817
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,839
and smoothies and stuff like that out

818
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,079
there in the health field in the health

819
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,400
realm I I don't want to laugh I don't

820
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:27,359
think it's funny because I realize what

821
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,680
it's going to do to people's skin

822
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,680
because liver is so filled with it's the

823
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,640
toxic waste dump of the animal I don't

824
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,800
care if it's the grass-fed of all Grassi

825
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,160
fed beef there is B Vine grass-fed I

826
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,079
don't care the liver still has filled

827
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,160
with poison and toxin inside that cow

828
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,760
and this isn't an anti- cow talk I'm

829
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,079
just saying it's filled the toxins and

830
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,319
poisons just like our livers fill the

831
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,119
toxins and poisons right and that liver

832
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:57,960
you eat that and that goes to the skin

833
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,480
all those time toxins and

834
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,520
poisons all right let's do this now this

835
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,119
is kind of fun I think this is actually

836
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,400
really fun all

837
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:13,359

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,480
that tea kettle boiling where it is

843
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,400

Potion okay you want water that's warm I

847
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,079

hands on on it you stick your finger in

849
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,760
there you don't get

850
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,319
burned that's the kind of water I like

00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,800
all right first of all I'm going to put

852
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:54,160
some powders in

853
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,520
there and I'm going to move little this

854
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,520
out of the

855
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,520
way

856
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,319
okay I think I'm going to make some room

857
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,560
here okay first things first we're going

858
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,560
to put a

859
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,520
scoop in

860
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,079
here of the micro

861
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,079
C immune

862
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,440
power okay then we're going to put two

863
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,520
capsules

864
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,800
of the MSM the bamboo

865
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,560
silica right

866
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,480
here two capsules

867
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,480
inside our little

868
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:49,160
cup I'm opening capsules if you guys

869
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,560
want to know I just opened up these

870
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,400
capsules

871
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:58,200
okay then I'm looking

872
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,599
for a little knife here because I'm

873
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,000
going to put

874
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,359
orange you can choose lemon but I'm

875
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,880
going to put orange and there's a reason

876
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,280
why orange is going in here it's not for

877
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:12,040
flavor and it's not for Taste although

878
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,119
it does taste good because it's a juicy

879
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,040
orange we're going to squeeze half an

880
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:20,119
orange in here the reason is because

881
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,599
what's in this orange are two things one

882
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:25,079
is calcium there's a little bit of

883
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,079
silica and orange too and there's

884
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,920
vitamin C

885
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:30,480
three

886
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,079
things what we have in this orange are

887
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,200
three things but I need those three

888
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:39,160
things because I am introducing those

889
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:43,760
three things in its living form fresh

890
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,760
out of an orange to the pure

891
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,280
form

892
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,280
here so what we're doing is we're

893
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,960
introducing the actual C

894
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,520
energetic blend of these

895
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,800
together now here's the cool

896
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,599
thing the orange in there not only makes

897
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,920
it taste good but what it's doing is

898
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,520
that vitamin C inside the orange right

899
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:21,079
there is connecting to the two kinds of

900
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,079
pure vitamin C in here in the immune

901
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:27,400
power we're mixing

902
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,079
them at the same time we're

903
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,680
connecting the

904
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:37,200
calcium the vitamin

905
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:39,960
C and silica to the

906
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,280
MSM we're connecting the silica that's

907
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,040
naturally in an orange there's a little

908
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,599
bit in an orange we're connecting that

909
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,560
to the organic bamboo silica we're

910
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,079
connecting that to the two other

911
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,200
varieties of vitamin C powerful vitamin

912
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,599
C and we're putting it all together and

913
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:02,079
we're making our skin

914
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,079
potion so we got our orange squeezed in

915
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,920
there if you go all the way back to the

916
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,160
beginning here you'll see why I

917
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:13,079
recommend vitamin C

918
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,079
silica yep for your

919
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:20,040
skin and if you go way before this video

920
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,920
right here that we're creating we're

921
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,319
live right now but way before this is

922
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,520
why I've been talking about it for

923
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,280
decades all right so let's get some warm

924
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:32,000
water in

925
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,000
here and we're going to mix

926
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,240
it and you have the Skin Potion right

927
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,520
there get a little spoon

928
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,760
out now what I recommend is don't drink

929
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,960
it right right away give it a couple of

930
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,319
minutes give it a good spin a good mix

931
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,160
and give it a couple of minutes and I

932
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,480
like to sip on it and take it with the

933
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,800
lemon

934
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,520
balm is what I like to

935
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,359
do a little lemon bomb to relax the

936
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,520
nerves and calm you can take the lemon

937
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,599
bomb

938
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,200
before because what I'm doing with the

939
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,040
lemon

940
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,079
bomb is

941
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:28,200
reducing stress inside the

942
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,240
body so that's what I'm doing reducing

943
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,400
stress and then I'm using this right

944
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:38,000
here the Skin

945
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:41,280
Potion to battle the free radicals to

946
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,559
battle the oxidative stress to battle

947
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,559
the corrosive

948
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:50,640
adrenaline and to feed the bottom of the

949
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:52,920
Derma it's about feeding the bottom of

950
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,240
the Derma that

951
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,839
sponge if you don't have orange you can

952
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,720
use lemon or

953
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:03,040
lime but orange is my

954
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,480
favorite now What's Happening Here is

955
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,839
I'm giving it a minute and I'm about to

956
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,200
start sipping it and I want to talk

957
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,160
about what happens when you're sipping

958
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,160
this Skin

959
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,640
Potion I'm going to do a sip right now I

960
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,640
think it's been a couple of minutes just

961
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:26,599
about you feel this when you just sip

962
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,559
it you feel it you give it just

963
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:31,040
20 seconds and you instantly start

964
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:34,880
feeling it you feel it actually get to

965
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,200
places fast there's nothing

966
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,160
inhibiting this from getting to where it

967
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,000
needs to go there's nothing in the way

968
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,280
of it there isn't a whole bunch of fatty

969
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,440
lipids in there this isn't one of those

970
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,800
supplementation things where you got

971
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,480
ascorbic acid mixed with all this fat

972
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,760
which doesn't get to where you need to

973
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,760
go it cancels out itself actually it

974
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,760
cancels itself out this is just

975
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,359
literally straight mainlining it right

976
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,440
here make sure it's stirred

977
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:08,040
enough because the

978
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,559
bottom might get stuck there as you pour

979
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,680
the liquid in so just like anything any

980
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,760
kind of powder you place

981
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,720
into make sure it stirred

982
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,720
enough now you're welcome to put a

983
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,640
little bit more orange than what I did I

984
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,079
just put like kind of a quarter of I

985
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,880
didn't squeeze the whole thing in but

986
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:30,319
you're allowed to put more in there

987
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,319
and that's

988
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,119
fine I'm going to give it a

989
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,640
second it's strong you feel

990
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,559
it it's

991
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,920
intense it goes in quick it goes into

992
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,079
the bloodstream fast for people that are

993
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,960
asking there's a direct link that puts

994
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,760
the products in one cart check it out

995
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,720
out the link is in the profile link is

996
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,119
in the description it puts both all

997
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,480
three products

998
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,480
in one

999
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:11,079
cart we're going to take some lemon bomb

1000
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,280
in a minute too let me see if I can find

1001
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:16,920
a little bit of a shot

1002
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,960
glass or I'll find it in a little

1003
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,400
bit okay

1004
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:26,839
now couple things to

1005
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:29,920
know it just feels good it feels good

1006
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:32,559
very strong very

1007
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,680
potent when you let it co through your

1008
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:37,480
bloodstream just

1009
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:40,520
imagine how it's finding its

1010
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:44,559
way to

1011
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:47,119
here it's finding its way to

1012
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:50,040
here the

1013
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:53,319
bottom of your skin the bottom of your

1014
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:57,480
Derma imagine it's finding its way

1015
00:46:53,319 --> 00:47:00,040
there that's where it's heading

1016
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,200
to help clean that up now what happens

1017
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,359
is when you gain weight and you lose

1018
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,000
weight do you ever notice that some

1019
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:08,839
people they lose weight their skin the

1020
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,880
stretch marks just somehow just

1021
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,599
disappear and some people they lose

1022
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,359
weight a stretch marks are still there

1023
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,760
even two people relatively at the same

1024
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:22,200
weight roughly might not be give or take

1025
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,000
a pound or two different but give or

1026
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:28,839
take either way they lost weight they

1027
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:33,319
weighed similar they had enough weight

1028
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:35,640
on their body that was equal um Miller

1029
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:37,280
says can we drink it every day or how

1030
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,040
often could it be used every day you can

1031
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,200
use

1032
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,240
it you can drink it every single day how

1033
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,119
much

1034
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,640
water a one cup to two cups is fine if

1035
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:49,599
you really have to do a half a cup for

1036
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,119
some reason you can but one to two cups

1037
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,960
of

1038
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:57,720
water if you need to do less for some

1039
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,720
reason you can

1040
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,480
but you feel it every time you take a

1041
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,480
sip of

1042
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,319
this you feel it going through the

1043
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,240
bloodstream because it gets there quick

1044
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:13,480
because it's not being

1045
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,440
inhibited so I want to cover stretch

1046
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,960
mark talk a little bit let's go into

1047
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,640
that I think stretch marks are a big

1048
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,599
deal for a lot of people a lot of people

1049
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,040
are upset by stretch marks they feel

1050
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:31,000
that they feel upset they feel like

1051
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:34,400
betrayed they work so hard to lose their

1052
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,480
weight they work really hard and then

1053
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,880
they have the stretch marks and they're

1054
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,520
like wow I did all this work I got rid

1055
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,119
of some excess unwanted pounds and now

1056
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,800
I'm dealing with stretch

1057
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:49,240
marks reason for those stretch

1058
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,319
marks obviously is because you're

1059
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:55,440
expanding right when you gain weight we

1060
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:59,599
expand we swell we expand so then we get

1061
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:02,400
more more more tissue growth more skin

1062
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:05,920
because we're actually stretching the

1063
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,079
skin our body overcompensates more skin

1064
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,079
is

1065
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:16,160
produced but even with that if someone

1066
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:18,000
gains a few pounds or 10 lb 15 or 20 lb

1067
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,920
and they lose the weight some people

1068
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,799
their stretch marks are a lot worse than

1069
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,400
some other people the reason for

1070
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:28,680
that is the very base the Landmark I'm

1071
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,760
talking about that we want to protect

1072
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,119
and we want to support that very

1073
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,400
landmark and

1074
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,599
base is

1075
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,400
deficient it's

1076
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:43,400
deficient and it's saturated and soaked

1077
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,799
up with toxins and free radicals that

1078
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,040
have been there for

1079
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:49,200
years and it's sufficient of things that

1080
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,200
it

1081
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,359
needs so that

1082
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:00,880
sponge got overs saturated with too much

1083
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:02,359
poisons fight ORF flight too many toxins

1084
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,240
right here at the base right here at the

1085
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:06,720
bottom too much

1086
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,240
adrenalin and it got

1087
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,680
damaged and when that base that bottom

1088
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,440
of that Derma gets

1089
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:16,559
damaged we don't it doesn't bounce back

1090
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,960
easy the staticity is

1091
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:24,160
gone collagen

1092
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:26,720
weakens we lose Vitality in the bottom

1093
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:30,599
of our Derma

1094
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,599
that's where it starts to really

1095
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,720
disappear and if you're dealing with

1096
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,000
somebody with a stagnant sluggish liver

1097
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,160
which is a big part of it all because

1098
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,559
that's saturated with toxins and poisons

1099
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,119
right Dr fine you're saying it right

1100
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:43,960
there it's stagnant sluggish liver

1101
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,079
possibly you're talking about this

1102
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,119
too it doesn't

1103
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,280
help in fact that's a big deal on its

1104
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,200
own some people might have a really

1105
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,200
toxic liver because they're so toxic

1106
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,359
that the Derma got filled up with a lot

1107
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,880
more

1108
00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:01,440
toxins and saturate it with a lot more

1109
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,319
adrenaline and then when they lost the

1110
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,599
weight the elti the elasticity is

1111
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,920
actually

1112
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:12,280
gone they don't have that play that room

1113
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,920
to play anymore it doesn't Revitalize

1114
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,400
easy it doesn't bounce back quick at all

1115
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:21,160
and then we have the stretch

1116
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,680
mark left over so what we're doing here

1117
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,839
we're talking about building the

1118
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,400
building blocks we're talking about down

1119
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:30,040
there in that area we're talking about

1120
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:34,200
restoring collagen because you can't eat

1121
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:38,040
collagen to actually rebuild collagen it

1122
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:41,280
doesn't work we have to rebuild the base

1123
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,880
have to rebuild the landmark and the

1124
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:47,240
foundation because in there is the

1125
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:50,240
secret to fixing lots of scarring that's

1126
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:54,359
occurred at least slowing down

1127
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:57,880
scarring CU scarring can continue on its

1128
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:59,880
own kind of like keloids do a lot of

1129
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,079
people they have scarring on the skin

1130
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,359
but the scarring can

1131
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,079
continue long

1132
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:08,680
past the time where you got the scar so

1133
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:10,799
if you're micro

1134
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,160
needling which is you know which people

1135
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:16,359
have done you get tiny little scars over

1136
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:18,960
time they can build we want to avoid

1137
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:20,319
that same way when people get tattoos

1138
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,400
the skin is

1139
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,799
scarred a lot of people

1140
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:29,520
lose they lose the

1141
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:31,799
look of their tattoo they lose the shine

1142
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,280
of it not just because the toxic heavy

1143
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:35,599
metals are are diminishing and leaving

1144
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,280
and going into their bloodstream and

1145
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,680
organs not because that this isn't a

1146
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,319
toxic heavy metal talk but because of

1147
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:46,160
also the skin has been scarred from the

1148
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:47,920
tattoo work and over time some people

1149
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,040
their their tattoos will fade even

1150
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,520
faster because the skin is actually

1151
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,559
building little scars micro scars that

1152
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,400
we can't see so that's why why it's

1153
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:00,880
important to actually help our skin when

1154
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,400
if we have tattoos to help our skin if

1155
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,559
we've done something with our skin to

1156
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,280
help it if we want that elasticity back

1157
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:09,359
to help it if we want it to look better

1158
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,160
if we've been under a lot of stress we

1159
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:14,000
want that skin looking good and bouncing

1160
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:18,079
back if we've gained weight we want

1161
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,079
stretch marks to be eased

1162
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:25,480
down all of that matters Deonte says I

1163
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:27,680
don't understand when put in the lemon

1164
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,680
with a lemon

1165
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,680
bomb

1166
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:38,160
okay so the lemon

1167
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,799
bomb add a little bit of water to

1168
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:45,319
this can be

1169
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:45,319
before in the middle or

1170
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,920
after you can do the lemon bomb before

1171
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,480
right now I'm in the middle of of doing

1172
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,599
this and I want to show you the lemon

1173
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,839
bomb I I showed you guys up against

1174
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,599
other lemon bombs right how incredible

1175
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,319
this lemon balm is remember I did that

1176
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,160
where I brought other lemon balbs in I

1177
00:54:03,319 --> 00:54:07,359
showed you the difference and what's in

1178
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,599
those lemon balbs and

1179
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,160
everything so that's the lemon balm

1181
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:18,359
balb before you actually do your skin

1182
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:21,319
potion in the middle of the Skin Potion

1188
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:38,319
infusions of the Skin Potion you don't

00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:43,880
shot you can do less water if you'd like

1191
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,880
you can just do a half a cup of water if

1192
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:49,359
you really like but you you can nurse

1193
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,680

know it's going to help people and when

1220
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:17,680
it helps people it matters because I see

1221
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:19,920
people they're tortured with skin

1222
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,119
products they're tortured with skin

1223
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,920
information out there they're tortured

1224
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:25,920
by what they're worried about with their

1225
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,079
skin

1226
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,119
I think everybody everybody is beautiful

1227
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,280
I think you know it's not that I think

1228
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:35,640
that people though they have a hard time

1229
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,799
they want their skin looking a certain

1230
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:43,680
way and I understand I understand the

1231
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:46,280
pain so many people go through with skin

1232
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:49,119
issues their face their

1233
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:52,160
skin on their hands their arms all these

1234
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,880
different places but I just want people

1235
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:58,039
to have an opportunity that's you know

1236
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:01,640
you know extremely valuable and in their

1237
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:04,359
hands choices and options that matter

1238
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:06,160
and help so when it comes down to skin

1239
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:08,280

1245
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:21,559
know that already someone just ask odd

1246
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:26,480
parrot said on Instagram what's in the

1247
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:29,039
Skin Potion it's the micro immune power

1248
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,079
I'll show you right on IG right there

1249
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:33,160
it's

1250
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:36,839
that and it's the

1251
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,880
MSM right there it's a combination along

1252
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:40,280
with the

1253
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,039
orange because what I'm doing is

1254
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,039
introducing vitamin C from the orange to

1255
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,640
the two kinds of vitamin C incredible

1256
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:49,680
vitamin C in

1257
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:52,039
here and

1258
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,400
that's but there's one more thing I did

1259
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:55,240
forget to tell you because there's so

1260
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,960
many different things is the glucose

1261
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:00,599
from the orange the reason why I like

1262
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:04,000
the orange the best as the activator

1263
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:06,440
here in this potion is because of the

1264
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,839
glucose it helps it Mainline into your

1265
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:11,079
bloodstream quick because there's no fat

1266
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:14,200
inhibiting there's no fat in the way and

1267
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:17,000
the micro C and the

1268
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,599
MSM get into the glucose of the orange

1269
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,000
and travels really quickly into the

1270
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,000
bloodstream and that's what I

1271
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:28,760
love just you know the link in the

1272
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:32,280
description Link in the profile puts in

1273
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:35,319
one cart the discount and the products

1274
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:40,200
so it puts the micro C it puts the lemon

1275
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:43,880
balb it puts the MSM the 5% off the free

1276
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:47,799
lemon bomb in one product right there

1277
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:48,960
and then we add that to the Living Water

1278
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:51,640
of the

1279
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,720
