[225.28 - 229.84] seeds
[226.24 - 232.00] like that so isn't it interesting
[229.84 - 233.44] okay merida papaya here it is right here
[232.00 - 235.36] sherry i'm currently
[233.44 - 238.16] so ill doctors can't tell me what's
[235.36 - 241.12] wrong with me and that you know
[238.16 - 242.48] it's really that's so hard and and
[241.12 - 243.04] depending on how many doctors you've
[242.48 - 245.76] gone to
[243.04 - 247.36] too that's so difficult i i mean i
[245.76 - 247.84] understand i've watched this for years
[247.36 - 251.44] that's
[247.84 - 253.76] that's a part of what propelled me
[251.44 - 256.16] to put out the new edition so people can
[253.76 - 258.40] be their own detective
[256.16 - 260.16] they can learn how to heal they can
[258.40 - 260.80] learn how to find out what's wrong with
[260.16 - 263.92] themselves
[260.80 - 265.68] why i put the book out there before the
[263.92 - 268.16] books came out there for 30 years i was
[265.68 - 268.48] known as the bizarre symptoms guy i was
[268.16 - 271.20] sent
[268.48 - 272.08] uh people were sent to me through
[271.20 - 273.44] doctors
[272.08 - 275.36] to find out what was going on with their
[273.44 - 277.28] bizarre symptoms and all that and that's
[275.36 - 278.48] what my work was all these years and all
[277.28 - 280.32] these years
[278.48 - 281.84] and so i put tremendous amount of
[280.32 - 283.52] information in a new addition you can
[281.84 - 286.08] always take it to your doctor too
[283.52 - 287.12] and try to give them a little lead maybe
[286.08 - 290.08] a little you know
[287.12 - 291.20] kind of give them a clue to help them
[290.08 - 294.24] and
[291.20 - 295.92] what's really annoying is when a doctor
[294.24 - 297.68] makes a comment somewhere on social
[295.92 - 298.40] media on one of the platforms whether
[297.68 - 300.88] it's ig
[298.40 - 301.84] or tick tock or something and they they
[300.88 - 303.52] comment
[301.84 - 305.28] about something they don't like that i'm
[303.52 - 306.48] doing like putting out information to
[305.28 - 309.60] help people heal
[306.48 - 311.28] and they they comment and meanwhile they
[309.60 - 312.72] don't even know why anybody's sick they
[311.28 - 314.72] don't know why people are coming to him
[312.72 - 316.48] every day that are sick they don't know
[314.72 - 318.08] they don't know you know why someone's
[316.48 - 319.28] got fatigue they don't know why someone
[318.08 - 321.44] has eczema
[319.28 - 323.20] and they're like oh is there any study
[321.44 - 324.16] behind that okay well that's funny
[323.20 - 325.52] because
[324.16 - 327.92] so many people are going doctor to
[325.52 - 329.84] doctor to doctor to doctor can't find
[327.92 - 332.00] answers can't figure out what's wrong
[329.84 - 334.40] with them don't know how to heal
[332.00 - 335.84] spending thousands of doctors what if
[334.40 - 337.28] they don't have an insurance
[335.84 - 339.28] card too what if they don't have
[337.28 - 341.76] insurance and it's all coming out of
[339.28 - 343.44] their pocket every bit of it it's so sad
[341.76 - 345.60] it's good to have answers it's good to
[343.44 - 347.04] have information
[345.60 - 348.40] just know that my heart pours out to you
[347.04 - 349.28] if you're going through that so i got
[348.40 - 352.16] the
[349.28 - 354.08] um merida papaya i'm showing you guys
[352.16 - 356.00] how i do my fruit bowl
[354.08 - 358.40] i'm showing you how i prepare my fruit a
[356.00 - 358.40] little bit
[359.20 - 362.56] doctors there's a lot of different
[361.28 - 365.20] doctors out there a lot of different
[362.56 - 368.32] phds there's a lot of different people
[365.20 - 370.16] but knowing what causes chronic illness
[368.32 - 372.72] that's an entirely different thing
[370.16 - 374.64] usually doctors right out of med school
[372.72 - 376.56] make the comments they come right out of
[374.64 - 378.16] med school they're hot dogs they come
[376.56 - 380.72] flying out of med school they don't know
[378.16 - 383.76] a thing about why people are sick
[380.72 - 385.76] they don't have any history
[383.76 - 387.36] into that they have no experience and
[385.76 - 388.32] they come flying out of med school with
[387.36 - 391.12] no experience
[388.32 - 392.16] at all and they're so excited you know
[391.12 - 394.56] to just hot dog
[392.16 - 395.20] and get into practice right away and
[394.56 - 397.44] just you know
[395.20 - 398.80] start writing out prescriptions when
[397.44 - 400.56] people come in and start sending it to
[398.80 - 402.32] medical tests but yet they don't even
[400.56 - 404.00] know why people are sick or they don't
[402.32 - 404.88] know how diseases start they don't know
[404.00 - 406.88] how
[404.88 - 408.16] foods play a role they don't know about
[406.88 - 410.24] toxic heavy metals they don't know about
[408.16 - 410.80] viruses they don't know about pathogens
[410.24 - 413.12] but
[410.80 - 415.20] yet you know they're experts instantly
[413.12 - 416.56] out of med school right off the running
[415.20 - 418.72] and they come out and those are the ones
[416.56 - 420.88] that usually don't work either it's it's
[418.72 - 422.40] amazing right now we have more doctors
[420.88 - 424.24] that get out of med school that never
[422.40 - 426.40] work they get out of med school and they
[424.24 - 427.92] start their social media account
[426.40 - 430.08] whether it's tick tock or ig or
[427.92 - 430.72] somewhere and they just want to become
[430.08 - 432.16] famous
[430.72 - 433.68] that's what they want to do now doctors
[432.16 - 435.12] don't want to work anymore all the new
[433.68 - 435.76] ones that come out of med school not all
[435.12 - 437.20] of them but
[435.76 - 439.04] most of them come out of med school and
[437.20 - 441.76] they're like whoa i have to work
[439.04 - 443.60] you mean this is a job oh my god i have
[441.76 - 445.20] to see patients day in and day out well
[443.60 - 447.36] this is stressful i have to get
[445.20 - 448.64] insurance i have to get malpractice
[447.36 - 450.40] insurance this is really
[448.64 - 451.76] stressful most doctors that come out of
[450.40 - 452.72] med school they're like can't i go a
[451.76 - 455.04] different way
[452.72 - 455.84] and now they become like a food expert
[455.04 - 458.56] and now they're like
[455.84 - 459.84] on social media on there you know doing
[458.56 - 461.36] this and that trying to start up
[459.84 - 462.80] accounts because they just want to sit
[461.36 - 463.44] home at their computer they don't want
[462.80 - 464.88] to go to
[463.44 - 466.32] go to the doctor they don't want to go
[464.88 - 466.80] to the office with the other doctors and
[466.32 - 468.80] work
[466.80 - 470.32] and that's happening now that's a big
[468.80 - 471.68] thing going on this is what i do right
[470.32 - 473.92] here
[471.68 - 475.68] or they go into cosmetics they go a lot
[473.92 - 476.16] of doctors go into cosmetics because
[475.68 - 479.20] they
[476.16 - 481.36] figure let's put lip filler in you know
[479.20 - 482.24] women in men's mouth let's do lip filler
[481.36 - 485.28] and that's
[482.24 - 487.28] a way to kind of like escape like
[485.28 - 488.96] all the people coming with problems
[487.28 - 490.80] medical problems left and right with no
[488.96 - 493.04] answers because it gets really tiresome
[490.80 - 493.52] for a doctor when a doctor has to sit
[493.04 - 495.12] there
[493.52 - 496.48] while patients are rolling in all day
[495.12 - 497.76] and they don't have a clue to why
[496.48 - 499.76] they're sick
[497.76 - 501.12] that's really hard for doctors they
[499.76 - 502.56] don't have a clue to why anybody's got
[501.12 - 504.24] fatigue and rna and
[502.56 - 505.76] skin disorders and different conditions
[504.24 - 506.00] they have to scratch your head all day
[505.76 - 507.44] long
[506.00 - 510.16] and be like i don't know why people are
[507.44 - 511.84] sick and because of that no and the
[510.16 - 513.04] doctors just go well what do i do let me
[511.84 - 515.04] look at my textbook here
[513.04 - 517.20] let me look at my my textbook when i
[515.04 - 520.64] just came out of med school it says
[517.20 - 523.36] jeans tell them genes
[520.64 - 524.08] tell them it's a genetic disorder um
[523.36 - 526.08] ma'am
[524.08 - 527.60] um that's a genetic disorder we think
[526.08 - 529.76] it's your genes
[527.60 - 531.20] uh really you need this i'm your 10th
[529.76 - 534.24] doctor you just came to
[531.20 - 535.28] oh no i'm your 15th doctor and that 15
[534.24 - 538.64] doctors just told you
[535.28 - 540.48] is your genes too and so what happens is
[538.64 - 542.24] you know they don't know so they go into
[540.48 - 544.56] cosmetics it's like let's do
[542.24 - 546.08] some lip filler and let's do i'm not
[544.56 - 547.68] saying is anything bad or good about it
[546.08 - 548.96] if that's what you do or that's what you
[547.68 - 550.24] want to do i'm not saying that a lot of
[548.96 - 552.00] men and women do it right
[550.24 - 553.52] but they go into like lip filler and
[552.00 - 555.60] jawline filler
[553.52 - 557.52] and they go into botox you know shove
[555.60 - 560.16] the needle up in your forehead and
[557.52 - 561.28] send that boat send that botulism
[560.16 - 564.40] bacteria in there
[561.28 - 566.00] and they they go into there because
[564.40 - 567.44] you know what i mean that's where a lot
[566.00 - 570.00] of them are heading into now
[567.44 - 570.96] head into cosmetics because they can't
[570.00 - 573.44] handle
[570.96 - 575.04] people pouring in sick with chronic
[573.44 - 576.56] illness just can't handle they don't
[575.04 - 577.84] have the skin for it because they don't
[576.56 - 579.28] have answers
[577.84 - 581.04] guys i'm making the fruit bowl right
[579.28 - 585.36] here if you just got on here

[600.32 - 605.04] or maybe that wasn't just maybe that was
[602.56 - 607.92] just a typo or something but if i do

[613.36 - 617.20] from medical medium information
[615.52 - 619.04] and have gotten their lives back so what

[1409.36 - 1414.48] they just hurt people wherever they can
[1412.80 - 1416.24] without they're not doing it on purpose
[1414.48 - 1418.64] some of it but some of it is

[1427.84 - 1431.68] and no one's paying the price after all
[1430.24 - 1433.36] those years of telling you all those
[1431.68 - 1433.92] good things or when they tell you fish
[1433.36 - 1435.76] oil

[1450.96 - 1453.76] and they've been telling you do fish oil
[1452.48 - 1455.44] all these years this is how the trend
[1453.76 - 1458.96] world works

[1499.60 - 1503.04] silver
[1500.00 - 1504.56] cap silver fillings and you want to keep
[1503.04 - 1505.52] them in you you know when you keep them
[1504.56 - 1507.84] in

[1659.92 - 1662.96] medical medium new edition going to talk
[1661.92 - 1664.08] about mercury
[1662.96 - 1666.00] i'm going to talk about the mercury
[1664.08 - 1669.12] demon
[1666.00 - 1672.32] fit and fab can this heal vitiligo
[1669.12 - 1675.44] well healing vitiligo determines on
[1672.32 - 1675.92] learning about vitiligo right so it's
[1675.44 - 1679.12] about
[1675.92 - 1680.80] learning about the cause of vitiligo
[1679.12 - 1682.80] it's about having the medical medium
[1680.80 - 1684.96] books so you can learn about it vitiligo
[1682.80 - 1686.72] the cause of it is aluminum
[1684.96 - 1688.80] and the epstein-barr virus so what
[1686.72 - 1690.08] happens is the epstein-barr virus sits
[1688.80 - 1693.36] inside your liver
[1690.08 - 1694.56] it feeds off of aluminum that's inside
[1693.36 - 1697.76] your liver
[1694.56 - 1698.32] and then releases a dermatoxin that
[1697.76 - 1701.76] kills
[1698.32 - 1703.76] melanin the pigment that's behind
[1701.76 - 1705.52] the vitiligo and you end up with your
[1703.76 - 1707.52] vitiligo so it's all about
[1705.52 - 1709.12] doing an antiviral protocol knowing how
[1707.52 - 1710.00] to do it and getting rid of the aluminum
[1709.12 - 1712.00] heavy metal detox
[1710.00 - 1714.48] smoothie it's all about that if i had
[1712.00 - 1716.72] vitiligo i'd be on the heavy metal detox
[1714.48 - 1718.24] movie i'd be on the vimergy spirulina
[1716.72 - 1719.36] i'd be on the vimergy barley grass
[1718.24 - 1720.64] that's what i would be doing and be on
[1719.36 - 1724.00] the medical medium
[1720.64 - 1725.44] heavy metal detox smoothie debbie my
[1724.00 - 1727.52] girlfriend who is on
[1725.44 - 1729.68] keto would say that is way too many
[1727.52 - 1732.64] fruits carbohydrates
[1729.68 - 1734.24] yeah i bet i bet she would say that i
[1732.64 - 1736.84] bet she would say that
[1734.24 - 1738.24] definitely guys i'm putting more mango
[1736.84 - 1740.48] here
[1738.24 - 1742.40] but no one's ever gotten sick from
[1740.48 - 1743.12] eating fruit because no one ever ate any
[1742.40 - 1745.36] fruit
[1743.12 - 1746.80] we've had millions and millions and
[1745.36 - 1748.56] millions and hundreds of millions of
[1746.80 - 1750.40] sick people around the globe
[1748.56 - 1751.76] for decades and decades and decades
[1750.40 - 1754.56] hundreds of millions of sick people and
[1751.76 - 1756.32] guess what fruit wasn't on their plate
[1754.56 - 1758.88] i think some people probably had a half
[1756.32 - 1761.76] a grapefruit once in a while with little
[1758.88 - 1763.12] sugar on top maybe on a sunday or maybe
[1761.76 - 1764.80] somebody had blueberry and blueberry
[1763.12 - 1765.68] muffins maybe they had a banana and a
[1764.80 - 1768.24] banana split
[1765.68 - 1770.00] maybe it had fake strawberries in a in a
[1768.24 - 1772.40] milkshake somewhere right
[1770.00 - 1774.72] maybe they had that but fruit isn't the
[1772.40 - 1776.64] number one food group but guess what
[1774.72 - 1778.24] the number one food group is the food
[1776.64 - 1781.36] group keto people are on
[1778.24 - 1784.40] you know what it is it's caffeine
[1781.36 - 1786.88] and guess what keto people they get sick
[1784.40 - 1788.24] they get sick a lot i've had sick
[1786.88 - 1789.84] celebrities
[1788.24 - 1791.76] knock on my door over the years that
[1789.84 - 1793.84] were on keto i've had sick
[1791.76 - 1795.92] doctors knock on my door that were on
[1793.84 - 1797.68] keto some that were making a career out
[1795.92 - 1800.00] of keto and had to knock on my door
[1797.68 - 1802.64] because they were getting so sick
[1800.00 - 1803.68] and i've had i've seen it all out there
[1802.64 - 1805.84] keto doesn't mean
[1803.68 - 1806.80] you're safe oh i'm not keto i'm safe
[1805.84 - 1809.12] i'll never get sick
[1806.80 - 1811.52] i'm on keto i'm i'm good i'm not going
[1809.12 - 1813.44] to get sick because i'm on keto so
[1811.52 - 1815.44] that's never going to happen quite the
[1813.44 - 1818.32] contrary because
[1815.44 - 1819.84] keto doesn't mean anything plant-based
[1818.32 - 1821.84] doesn't even mean anything
[1819.84 - 1823.44] if you don't do it right you can be
[1821.84 - 1824.96] doing keto and do it wrong
[1823.44 - 1826.48] you can be doing plant-based and do it
[1824.96 - 1828.00] wrong oh that's right but someone lost
[1826.48 - 1829.52] weight doing keto after getting off of
[1828.00 - 1830.56] processed foods so maybe they're doing
[1829.52 - 1833.04] it right no
[1830.56 - 1834.88] and they still are on that vinegar and
[1833.04 - 1836.32] that caffeine and other things like that
[1834.88 - 1837.84] and they still got toxic heavy metals
[1836.32 - 1838.64] and pathogens and guess what they still
[1837.84 - 1840.00] get sick
[1838.64 - 1841.84] and they still get into the dentist
[1840.00 - 1843.60] chair and they still lose they still
[1841.84 - 1846.32] need all their veneers
[1843.60 - 1848.24] all the keto doctors podcast doctors
[1846.32 - 1850.64] they all got veneers i know
[1848.24 - 1851.84] i know who they all are and i know they
[1850.64 - 1853.36] all got the mirrors
[1851.84 - 1856.40] all their teeth are like missing they
[1853.36 - 1858.48] got bridges veneers they've got implants
[1856.40 - 1860.24] and they're keto guys this stuff you
[1858.48 - 1863.04] know all of that stuff so now
[1860.24 - 1864.24] keto doesn't mean jack squat when it
[1863.04 - 1866.56] comes to
[1864.24 - 1869.36] when it comes to anything so and i
[1866.56 - 1871.12] totally get it and like you said your
[1869.36 - 1874.00] your friend is going to be like no no
[1871.12 - 1876.24] way for fruit no way because keto is it
[1874.00 - 1877.36] i get it i get it but no fruit is
[1876.24 - 1879.52] something people
[1877.36 - 1880.88] don't eat they just don't they have a
[1879.52 - 1883.36] lunchbox apple
[1880.88 - 1884.40] they got a lunchbox banana they just
[1883.36 - 1886.32] don't eat it
[1884.40 - 1888.16] they don't and so but that's not why
[1886.32 - 1889.04] anybody's sick people just don't eat
[1888.16 - 1891.92] fruit you know
[1889.04 - 1893.04] they just don't and that's what's
[1891.92 - 1897.04] interesting
[1893.04 - 1899.12] um this book is really
[1897.04 - 1902.64] an amazing book and i i gotta tell you
[1899.12 - 1907.20] guys like the fruit fear chapter
[1902.64 - 1910.32] is really um really incredible chapter

[1915.36 - 1918.16] so many mistakes that are being made out
[1917.04 - 1921.04] there right now
[1918.16 - 1922.24] um so many mistakes there really is some
[1921.04 - 1923.68] of the fruit for your chapter as we
[1922.24 - 1926.56] speak
[1923.68 - 1928.40] so ryan can you speak on lectins i'm
[1926.56 - 1930.56] hearing more and more recently and it's
[1928.40 - 1932.08] freaking me out since most of my diet is
[1930.56 - 1933.84] fruits and vegetables
[1932.08 - 1936.00] it's just gonna sidetrack you to get you
[1933.84 - 1938.96] sicker down the road it's a trick
[1936.00 - 1940.64] see before the lectin thing blew up a
[1938.96 - 1942.32] few years ago
[1940.64 - 1943.92] already millions of people healed around
[1942.32 - 1944.48] the world from the medical medium books
[1943.92 - 1946.96] okay
[1944.48 - 1948.40] so the lectin guys were pretending
[1946.96 - 1950.40] nobody got better
[1948.40 - 1952.08] they were like in a bubble or something
[1950.40 - 1954.08] where they were pretending
[1952.08 - 1956.08] no one got better until they actually
[1954.08 - 1956.64] took a few people off of some foods with
[1956.08 - 1959.36] leptin
[1956.64 - 1961.44] what they really did is they just took
[1959.36 - 1962.08] them off a processed food so it was
[1961.44 - 1965.04] another
[1962.08 - 1965.68] kind of hit and miss keto diet is what
[1965.04 - 1968.00] they did
[1965.68 - 1969.84] they took you off of fruits they took
[1968.00 - 1971.20] you off of some different vegetables
[1969.84 - 1973.92] they took you off of some
[1971.20 - 1974.40] starchy carbs and what they did was they
[1973.92 - 1976.32] just
[1974.40 - 1978.40] put basically they put you on some meat
[1976.32 - 1979.68] and vegetables certain vegetables right
[1978.40 - 1981.76] and then if you were somebody that were
[1979.68 - 1983.52] on processed foods you'd be like whoa
[1981.76 - 1985.04] i'm getting better now i'm losing a
[1983.52 - 1986.08] little weight i think i'm feeling a
[1985.04 - 1988.80] little better
[1986.08 - 1989.68] and it was the lectins and it was
[1988.80 - 1991.52] probably the
[1989.68 - 1993.92] one of the greatest scams in the last
[1991.52 - 1996.56] three four years was the lectin scam
[1993.92 - 1997.12] um and you know it's really ridiculous
[1996.56 - 1998.40] so
[1997.12 - 2000.32] what you're going to be told is don't
[1998.40 - 2002.72] eat fruits don't eat you know don't eat
[2000.32 - 2005.52] some vegetables don't eat
[2002.72 - 2007.60] tomato the big lectin guy was like don't
[2005.52 - 2009.68] eat celery don't eat celery and then
[2007.60 - 2011.84] the whole thing blew up with the celery
[2009.68 - 2014.00] juice movement so big he had to give in
[2011.84 - 2015.68] and be like okay you can eat celery
[2014.00 - 2017.68] celery's fine well you don't have to
[2015.68 - 2019.12] worry about those leptins because
[2017.68 - 2020.80] because the whole thing was so many
[2019.12 - 2021.76] people were healing it just stomped on
[2020.80 - 2023.52] everybody the
[2021.76 - 2025.04] celery just moved in just stomped on all
[2023.52 - 2026.48] the podcast doctors all the other
[2025.04 - 2028.88] authors in health
[2026.48 - 2030.32] and so what happened is just the lectin
[2028.88 - 2032.24] thing is really
[2030.32 - 2034.48] it's so misguided there's so much
[2032.24 - 2037.84] misinformation about the lectin stuff
[2034.48 - 2040.96] it's ridiculous so people have healed
[2037.84 - 2041.60] from these foods these herbs leafy
[2040.96 - 2043.60] greens
[2041.60 - 2045.76] fruits and wild foods okay and
[2043.60 - 2046.40] vegetables and in the way medical medium
[2045.76 - 2048.48] has
[2046.40 - 2051.28] the medical medium information has laid
[2048.48 - 2055.20] out debilitating diseases
[2051.28 - 2058.56] eczema psoriasis severe fatigue
[2055.20 - 2062.16] fibrosis multiple cirrhosis
[2058.56 - 2064.96] als parkinson's debilitating diseases
[2062.16 - 2066.00] reversed completely reversed healed 100
[2064.96 - 2068.56] percent
[2066.00 - 2070.00] tens of thousands of healing stories and
[2068.56 - 2072.32] they were eating lectins
[2070.00 - 2073.12] they were eating the lectins these
[2072.32 - 2075.04] lectin
[2073.12 - 2076.32] supplement guys try to sell you so
[2075.04 - 2079.28] here's how it works
[2076.32 - 2081.12] the lectin movement started with people
[2079.28 - 2083.28] trying to sell
[2081.12 - 2085.12] supplements that were supposedly
[2083.28 - 2088.56] protecting you against lectins
[2085.12 - 2090.56] it was a scam that's how it was done
[2088.56 - 2093.12] so it was like let's tell you about
[2090.56 - 2094.16] lectins so we can sell you a lectin
[2093.12 - 2095.84] supplement
[2094.16 - 2097.52] and that's that's that's how it started
[2095.84 - 2098.40] i'm just just being straight up about
[2097.52 - 2100.80] what was going on
[2098.40 - 2102.56] lectins are in everything and if you
[2100.80 - 2104.56] want to not eat anything
[2102.56 - 2106.80] like don't eat any food it's it's
[2104.56 - 2110.08] lectins are in everything so don't eat
[2106.80 - 2113.60] any food whatsoever and
[2110.08 - 2115.76] um you know just just live off of
[2113.60 - 2116.96] i don't know dirt and water i don't know
[2115.76 - 2118.24] live off of something
[2116.96 - 2120.40] try to find something to live off of
[2118.24 - 2122.96] okay maybe put some rocks
[2120.40 - 2124.56] in a soup in a pot of boiling water
[2122.96 - 2125.92] throw some rocks in there and throw a
[2124.56 - 2128.00] little mud in there
[2125.92 - 2130.16] and then try to like stir it up in hopes
[2128.00 - 2133.76] that you you avoid lectins because
[2130.16 - 2136.40] there's lectins in everything and
[2133.76 - 2138.16] um and there's still lectins in dirt
[2136.40 - 2140.08] there's still some lectins in turn
[2138.16 - 2141.60] so the point is is like i guess you just
[2140.08 - 2143.36] can't eat anything right
[2141.60 - 2145.04] so the lectin scam was one of the
[2143.36 - 2146.16] greatest scams and it made a lot of
[2145.04 - 2147.92] people a lot of money
[2146.16 - 2149.92] made a lot of people a lot of money so
[2147.92 - 2152.56] you'll just fall for the scam
[2149.92 - 2154.96] but um hey look try to give you the best
[2152.56 - 2158.16] information i can right
[2154.96 - 2160.24] and when it comes down to fruit fear
[2158.16 - 2162.08] really important and you know it
[2160.24 - 2163.92] information to know it turned out to be
[2162.08 - 2165.76] fruit is a dirty word because of the war
[2163.92 - 2166.56] on sugar and then fruit got thrown into
[2165.76 - 2170.16] there it's like
[2166.56 - 2172.64] sugar's bad sugar's bad so
[2170.16 - 2175.12] fruit must be bad too fruit must be bad
[2172.64 - 2177.12] so i got a fruit fear chapter in here
[2175.12 - 2178.64] where fruit is not the problem i talk
[2177.12 - 2180.40] about it in here i know you probably
[2178.64 - 2181.04] can't see it's getting kind of blasted
[2180.40 - 2183.60] out
[2181.04 - 2184.88] um let's finish up this and we'll talk
[2183.60 - 2186.40] about mercury i want to read a little
[2184.88 - 2188.32] bit about mercury
[2186.40 - 2191.04] information in there so you guys this is
[2188.32 - 2194.08] coming together check this out right
[2191.04 - 2197.20] i know evil fruit oh no we got

[2197.20 - 2202.56] we got blueberries we got mango

[2202.56 - 2208.32] hashimoto's thanks to you anthony
[2205.28 - 2209.44] and it wasn't avoiding lectins see oh by
[2208.32 - 2210.96] the way i forgot to tell you one thing
[2209.44 - 2214.16] about the lectin story
[2210.96 - 2217.68] just so you know the lectin guys
[2214.16 - 2219.68] lectin doctors left in gurus
[2217.68 - 2220.96] never knew what causes chronic fatigue
[2219.68 - 2224.32] syndrome
[2220.96 - 2225.44] r.a lyme disease multiple sclerosis
[2224.32 - 2226.72] fibromyalgia
[2225.44 - 2228.88] and the rest all the different
[2226.72 - 2230.56] conditions excellent psoriasis
[2228.88 - 2232.16] it's guessing games out there they never
[2230.56 - 2233.68] knew what the cause was medical medium
[2232.16 - 2235.04] information was the first to put out
[2233.68 - 2236.48] that information
[2235.04 - 2238.08] they never knew what it was so they're
[2236.48 - 2238.72] doing the guessing games like what is it
[2238.08 - 2240.96] lectins
[2238.72 - 2242.80] well we can sell those things too we can
[2240.96 - 2243.36] sell anti-lectins wait a minute what was
[2242.80 - 2245.68] it
[2243.36 - 2247.20] it could it be uh wait what could be
[2245.68 - 2250.96] what could be causing the problem
[2247.20 - 2252.08] is it gluten amanda are autoimmune
[2250.96 - 2254.48] diseases caused by
[2252.08 - 2256.96] unhealthy diet do you talk about
[2254.48 - 2259.12] autoimmune diseases in your books
[2256.96 - 2260.72] not only do i talk about autoimmune
[2259.12 - 2262.48] diseases in the books
[2260.72 - 2263.76] i talk about how your body doesn't
[2262.48 - 2265.44] attack itself
[2263.76 - 2267.20] and that's what science research says
[2265.44 - 2269.12] science science and research will say
[2267.20 - 2271.12] amanda that your body is turning on
[2269.12 - 2274.00] itself and that's what autoimmune is
[2271.12 - 2276.72] they think so their theory from 1950
[2274.00 - 2278.72] is that your body's immune system is
[2276.72 - 2280.24] destroying itself so if you
[2278.72 - 2281.52] were diagnosed with any kind of
[2280.24 - 2284.40] autoimmune disease whether it's
[2281.52 - 2286.72] hashimoto's or ra or anything
[2284.40 - 2288.88] they they say that your body is turning
[2286.72 - 2290.56] on itself and destroying your cell your
[2288.88 - 2292.48] yourself destroying your organs and all
[2290.56 - 2293.60] that so your immune system now that's
[2292.48 - 2295.92] misinformation
[2293.60 - 2297.60] that's a theory that's misguided and
[2295.92 - 2299.68] that's designed to body shame you and
[2297.60 - 2301.04] also make you basically hate your body
[2299.68 - 2302.24] and feel like you're a failure and
[2301.04 - 2303.92] you're never going to heal because your
[2302.24 - 2306.08] body's turning against itself
[2303.92 - 2307.04] dr fan incredible doctor right here at
[2306.08 - 2310.08] md
[2307.04 - 2310.40] um you are the man that's all i could
[2310.08 - 2311.92] say
[2310.40 - 2314.32] you are an incredible guy i'm glad
[2311.92 - 2316.48] you're here amazing doctor by the way
[2314.32 - 2318.32] so look the bottom line is with
[2316.48 - 2318.72] autoimmune your body doesn't destroy
[2318.32 - 2321.84] itself
[2318.72 - 2324.24] it's not attacking itself and
[2321.84 - 2325.20] that's how much autoimmune information
[2324.24 - 2327.60] is in my books
[2325.20 - 2329.20] it's like there's volumes of it for
[2327.60 - 2331.36] autoimmune the true cause
[2329.20 - 2332.40] viruses so it's viruses that cause
[2331.36 - 2335.36] autoimmune
[2332.40 - 2336.56] that's the cause of it and viruses like
[2335.36 - 2339.36] epstein-barr
[2336.56 - 2340.00] that's the cause of autoimmune but it's
[2339.36 - 2342.32] not really
[2340.00 - 2343.76] autoimmune it's just the cause of the
[2342.32 - 2344.16] symptoms people are getting that are
[2343.76 - 2346.56] being
[2344.16 - 2347.28] labeled as the body's attacking itself
[2346.56 - 2350.56] so
[2347.28 - 2351.36] if you got a condition and that virus is
[2350.56 - 2353.20] behind it
[2351.36 - 2354.72] and i talk about that in the books and
[2353.20 - 2356.08] how it works
[2354.72 - 2357.76] i'm going to finish up the salad talk
[2356.08 - 2360.16] about some mercury

[2531.92 - 2535.36] another doctor
[2533.20 - 2536.80] and and they get this moment of reprieve
[2535.36 - 2537.84] and their family's not pushing them to
[2536.80 - 2539.20] the doctor in that moment
[2537.84 - 2541.28] and they don't know it they start
[2539.20 - 2542.88] getting a little better because they're
[2541.28 - 2545.28] not getting the blood drawn
[2542.88 - 2547.44] and taken out constantly anymore they're

[2666.48 - 2669.52] mean all the medical media books are so
[2667.76 - 2672.48] filled with information
[2669.52 - 2672.48] that's a fruit salad
[2672.72 - 2676.80] i'm in the medical medium new edition as
[2674.48 - 2680.56] we speak you guys
[2676.80 - 2681.68] and i'm in dirty secret okay so dirty
[2680.56 - 2683.68] secret
[2681.68 - 2685.28] and that's the mercury demon so i'm
[2683.68 - 2686.56] gonna read a little piece of it right
[2685.28 - 2690.00] here
[2686.56 - 2693.12] so is mercury gone yet no
[2690.00 - 2694.96] it's not gone yet right
[2693.12 - 2696.56] is the nightmare finally over with
[2694.96 - 2698.32] mercury
[2696.56 - 2700.56] have we come to our senses and learned
[2698.32 - 2702.00] to avoid it at all costs for the sake of
[2700.56 - 2703.44] humankind
[2702.00 - 2706.88] for the sake of our health and
[2703.44 - 2709.92] well-being for the sake of our children
[2706.88 - 2710.56] nope we haven't it's just that it's out
[2709.92 - 2712.40] of sight
[2710.56 - 2714.16] and out of mind there's still plenty of
[2712.40 - 2715.84] mercury to be had it's constantly at her
[2714.16 - 2718.64] fingertips in ways
[2715.84 - 2720.32] that are extremely controversial so i'm
[2718.64 - 2723.84] going to give you that right now
[2720.32 - 2726.32] extremely controversial think about that
[2723.84 - 2728.32] for a little bit
[2726.32 - 2730.64] you know what's happening in today's
[2728.32 - 2731.52] world this is extremely controversial
[2730.64 - 2734.88] right
[2731.52 - 2738.16] and there's mercury involved in
[2734.88 - 2740.56] today's extremely controversial
[2738.16 - 2742.32] stuff happening in the world so that's
[2740.56 - 2744.48] important to know
[2742.32 - 2746.08] just as a result of modern living over
[2744.48 - 2749.12] time your body will accumulate
[2746.08 - 2750.24] toxic heavy metals such as mercury your
[2749.12 - 2752.64] body will
[2750.24 - 2754.16] accumulate that mercury every day it
[2752.64 - 2757.68] falls out of the sky
[2754.16 - 2759.84] it's in pharmaceuticals it's
[2757.68 - 2761.60] everywhere there's still plenty of
[2759.84 - 2763.20] mercury out there it accumulates over
[2761.60 - 2764.80] time we're continually exposed to this
[2763.20 - 2765.84] toxin because it slips through the
[2764.80 - 2767.92] cracks
[2765.84 - 2770.16] figuratively it slips through the cracks
[2767.92 - 2772.56] of our healthcare and industrial systems
[2770.16 - 2774.88] literally mercury absorbs into the
[2772.56 - 2776.96] cracks of your brain
[2774.88 - 2780.16] and all of us have some level of mercury
[2776.96 - 2781.28] inside our bodies it's unavoidable
[2780.16 - 2783.28] so that's important to know so i'm
[2781.28 - 2785.44] reading a little bit on the mercury
[2783.28 - 2787.28] okay why should we care why should you
[2785.44 - 2790.24] guys care why should i care
[2787.28 - 2791.44] because mercury is a top fuel for
[2790.24 - 2794.08] viruses
[2791.44 - 2795.52] that's a top fuel for why people are
[2794.08 - 2797.04] sick this is advanced
[2795.52 - 2798.56] information right here so if you guys
[2797.04 - 2799.28] are here just letting you know it's
[2798.56 - 2801.52] advanced
[2799.28 - 2803.36] information in the medical field that's
[2801.52 - 2806.32] teaching people's out people people out
[2803.36 - 2810.08] there so it's important to know
[2806.32 - 2812.88] it's the top fuel for viruses viruses
[2810.08 - 2815.04] eat mercury that's the big one there why
[2812.88 - 2816.96] are some cases of neurological lyme
[2815.04 - 2818.80] really really bad not just from the
[2816.96 - 2821.28] antibiotic use that happens
[2818.80 - 2821.84] but because viruses behind neurological
[2821.28 - 2823.44] lime
[2821.84 - 2825.52] feed off of mercury that means they have
[2823.44 - 2826.80] a lot of mercury in them bad cases of
[2825.52 - 2828.24] fibromyalgia
[2826.80 - 2829.92] chronic fatigue syndrome at me
[2828.24 - 2831.12] neurological lyme just a lot of
[2829.92 - 2833.44] different conditions
[2831.12 - 2835.04] you got high mercury and you've got the
[2833.44 - 2836.64] tingles and numbness aches and pains of
[2835.04 - 2839.36] dizziness and that's just not it you've
[2836.64 - 2841.52] got floaters in the eyes
[2839.36 - 2843.20] body pain burning pain jaw pain all
[2841.52 - 2845.84] these different things people have
[2843.20 - 2847.60] that's because there's lots of mercury
[2845.84 - 2850.56] for the virus to feed
[2847.60 - 2852.24] off of and zeolite doesn't cover it it
[2850.56 - 2853.92] doesn't cover it i'm letting you know
[2852.24 - 2856.08] anybody says oh you just need the
[2853.92 - 2856.56] zeolite no stuff's been around for 20
[2856.08 - 2858.32] years
[2856.56 - 2859.84] it never worked so i medical media
[2858.32 - 2861.84] information how to put out
[2859.84 - 2863.44] the right way of getting metals out and
[2861.84 - 2865.04] that's what's saving so many people's
[2863.44 - 2868.48] lives right now
[2865.04 - 2872.00] and so mercury is top fuel for viruses
[2868.48 - 2875.36] cancer and bacteria so
[2872.00 - 2878.16] cancers caused by viruses
[2875.36 - 2880.08] okay for the most part caused by viruses
[2878.16 - 2883.60] that's the cancer is caused by
[2880.08 - 2886.72] and mercury feeds that
[2883.60 - 2888.72] virus it feeds those cancer cells
[2886.72 - 2890.48] so that's important to know so mercury
[2888.72 - 2893.04] is a toxin so to make
[2890.48 - 2893.68] cancer you have to have viruses and you
[2893.04 - 2896.72] have to have
[2893.68 - 2898.64] toxins so to create cancer you need both
[2896.72 - 2901.68] those things you need a virus
[2898.64 - 2903.36] and you need toxins well mercury is high
[2901.68 - 2905.20] on that toxin list
[2903.36 - 2907.20] and so if you got the viruses and you
[2905.20 - 2909.52] got the mercury if you don't get
[2907.20 - 2911.44] one out and they're both there for a
[2909.52 - 2912.64] long time and it happens to be a pretty
[2911.44 - 2914.00] annoying virus
[2912.64 - 2915.68] then you can end up with some type of
[2914.00 - 2918.96] cancer
[2915.68 - 2921.20] important to know mercury exposure is a
[2918.96 - 2923.20] factor behind inflammation
[2921.20 - 2925.04] and it can take people hostage by
[2923.20 - 2926.40] causing or contributing to a vast number
[2925.04 - 2929.52] of symptoms and conditions
[2926.40 - 2932.24] okay so mercury can help take
[2929.52 - 2933.76] somebody hostage right i don't have any
[2932.24 - 2935.92] mercury to show you guys
[2933.76 - 2937.76] because you know maybe i need a mercury
[2935.92 - 2939.28] prop i got to figure that out like
[2937.76 - 2939.84] where's the mercury prop like what can i
[2939.28 - 2942.96] use for
[2939.84 - 2945.04] mercury prop right mercury so mercury
[2942.96 - 2946.72] exposure is a factor behind inflammation
[2945.04 - 2948.48] and can take people hostage
[2946.72 - 2950.64] by causing or contributing to a vast
[2948.48 - 2953.92] number of symptoms and conditions
[2950.64 - 2956.96] all right so including depression
[2953.92 - 2960.16] yeah mercury anxiety yeah
[2956.96 - 2963.04] mercury adhd mercury
[2960.16 - 2965.60] autism mercury bipolar disorder mercury
[2963.04 - 2968.24] neurological disorders
[2965.60 - 2969.36] pain in the back of the head anxiety
[2968.24 - 2971.84] it's neurological
[2969.36 - 2972.72] brain fog neurological aches and pains
[2971.84 - 2975.52] neurological
[2972.72 - 2976.72] fatigue neurological so just think about
[2975.52 - 2980.48] that
[2976.72 - 2983.28] adhd that's mercury autism
[2980.48 - 2984.32] mercury bipolar disorder mercury i said
[2983.28 - 2985.44] those already
[2984.32 - 2986.80] i'm going to say them again because
[2985.44 - 2987.84] people are like wait a minute what did
[2986.80 - 2991.88] he say
[2987.84 - 2994.56] epilepsy mercury okay

[3018.08 - 3021.04] you're dealing with mercury and that's
[3019.28 - 3022.80] why it keeps on coming back and keeps on
[3021.04 - 3026.40] coming back

[3062.08 - 3065.04] they've brought a condition like
[3063.52 - 3067.12] depression upon themselves
[3065.04 - 3068.32] you know you're depressed it's just it's
[3067.12 - 3070.80] got to be you
[3068.32 - 3072.08] it's got to be you right it's you need a
[3070.80 - 3073.76] psychiatrist
[3072.08 - 3075.68] you know you're depressed you're going
[3073.76 - 3076.00] to need a therapist psychotherapist like
[3075.68 - 3077.28] a
[3076.00 - 3079.28] psychoanalyst you're going to need some
[3077.28 - 3081.84] kind of some kind of help
[3079.28 - 3082.96] yeah it's good to get help but it's end
[3081.84 - 3086.56] up it's on you
[3082.96 - 3089.44] like it's your fault it's your fault
[3086.56 - 3090.96] so the depression is your fault you're
[3089.44 - 3092.24] not thinking right you're not thinking
[3090.96 - 3094.00] positive your brain
[3092.24 - 3096.24] you know you don't know how to control
[3094.00 - 3096.88] your thoughts you don't know how to see
[3096.24 - 3099.44] things
[3096.88 - 3100.08] you must be just faulty you must just be
[3099.44 - 3102.40] you know
[3100.08 - 3103.60] not so great of a person that's what
[3102.40 - 3106.72] happens
[3103.60 - 3108.56] and it's all part of the mercury's blame
[3106.72 - 3110.56] the victim game because that's how it
[3108.56 - 3113.84] works and you got mercury
[3110.56 - 3115.76] talking for you creating that
[3113.84 - 3116.40] depersonalization that anxiety and that
[3115.76 - 3118.40] depression
[3116.40 - 3120.00] you got mercury talking for you creating
[3118.40 - 3122.00] depression
[3120.00 - 3123.84] and you're held hostage by mercury and
[3122.00 - 3126.16] nobody knows you'd be at your 50th
[3123.84 - 3128.32] doctor you'll be 75 years old now
[3126.16 - 3129.92] at your 100th doctor like why am i still
[3128.32 - 3132.88] depressed after all these years because
[3129.92 - 3134.80] no one's going to tell you it's mercury
[3132.88 - 3137.12] those depressive symptoms are the
[3134.80 - 3140.64] mercury speaking for a patient without
[3137.12 - 3142.72] her consent so here it is you got
[3140.64 - 3144.16] something inside of you which is a toxin
[3142.72 - 3146.00] and it's mercury and it's speaking for
[3144.16 - 3147.28] you without your consent
[3146.00 - 3149.52] and that's what's happening so you're
[3147.28 - 3151.20] depressed you're not feeling good
[3149.52 - 3154.64] emotionally mentally
[3151.20 - 3156.24] you got the mercury inside of you and
[3154.64 - 3158.16] it's kind of like speaking for you
[3156.24 - 3159.84] without your choice
[3158.16 - 3161.68] it's actually speaking for you without
[3159.84 - 3163.28] your consent that's how mercury works
[3161.68 - 3163.84] and that's how the mercury demon people
[3163.28 - 3167.68] love it
[3163.84 - 3169.44] originally so sometimes mercury moves
[3167.68 - 3171.76] past the hostage phase
[3169.44 - 3172.80] and takes someone out yeah there's
[3171.76 - 3174.72] people out there
[3172.80 - 3176.00] got a lot of mercury in their brain and
[3174.72 - 3179.52] it pushes them over
[3176.00 - 3180.56] the edge over the edge and that's really
[3179.52 - 3182.08] sad
[3180.56 - 3185.84] you know resulting in death by
[3182.08 - 3188.08] alzheimer's parkinson's dementia stroke
[3185.84 - 3190.16] it's that serious okay i'm reading out
[3188.08 - 3193.20] of new edition medical medium
[3190.16 - 3196.72] you guys mercury has injured or killed
[3193.20 - 3200.16] well over a billion people mercury
[3196.72 - 3203.76] has injured or killed and put
[3200.16 - 3207.52] over a billion people in an early
[3203.76 - 3208.16] grave right but hey there's no study on
[3207.52 - 3210.16] that
[3208.16 - 3211.84] but where's your study oh i don't know
[3210.16 - 3213.60] why a billion people died
[3211.84 - 3215.20] do you have a science study on that why
[3213.60 - 3216.72] a billion people died we don't know why
[3215.20 - 3217.76] a billion people died because they don't
[3216.72 - 3219.52] have a study yet
[3217.76 - 3221.52] on alzheimer's we don't know why people
[3219.52 - 3222.08] have alzheimer's the best medical
[3221.52 - 3224.80] technology
[3222.08 - 3226.64] in the world and we still don't know why
[3224.80 - 3228.56] is it the body attacking itself
[3226.64 - 3230.80] that must be it is it genes it's genes
[3228.56 - 3236.48] that's why the person has alzheimer's
[3230.80 - 3237.84] it's gene jeans i guess
[3236.48 - 3239.68] no one likes alzheimer's it's
[3237.84 - 3241.92] frightening terrible disease yet it's
[3239.68 - 3243.84] rapidly becoming common
[3241.92 - 3245.52] and it's a hundred percent mercury
[3243.84 - 3248.16] caused
[3245.52 - 3250.40] you heard that here first mercury is 100
[3248.16 - 3252.56] responsible for alzheimer's disease
[3250.40 - 3254.24] you will never in your lifetime hear the
[3252.56 - 3256.56] truth about that anywhere else
[3254.24 - 3258.00] unless a podcast doctor steals it from
[3256.56 - 3260.16] here and they have
[3258.00 - 3261.28] okay there's two podcast doctors out
[3260.16 - 3262.72] there
[3261.28 - 3265.36] that have stolen the information
[3262.72 - 3267.60] straight out of medical medium book one
[3265.36 - 3268.48] because there's no science and research
[3267.60 - 3270.08] behind it
[3268.48 - 3272.08] and it was published here first so they
[3270.08 - 3273.44] took it from here and then they talk
[3272.08 - 3274.72] about mercury now
[3273.44 - 3277.36] because people want to hear about
[3274.72 - 3278.64] mercury because millions of books sold
[3277.36 - 3280.32] around the planet
[3278.64 - 3281.76] and people want to know about mercury
[3280.32 - 3283.28] now because of the first book
[3281.76 - 3284.72] so then you got a couple of podcast
[3283.28 - 3286.48] doctors out there they're acting like
[3284.72 - 3288.56] they know something about mercury
[3286.48 - 3289.76] it's kind of funny you know they should
[3288.56 - 3294.00] cite where it comes from
[3289.76 - 3296.32] but they don't that's classic
[3294.00 - 3298.16] that's how egos work out there i want it
[3296.32 - 3299.52] cited so someone can heal
[3298.16 - 3300.56] they don't want to cite it because they
[3299.52 - 3302.32] want to look like they know what they're
[3300.56 - 3305.04] talking about
[3302.32 - 3306.32] um so let's get let's go into this a
[3305.04 - 3308.48] little bit more
[3306.32 - 3310.56] everyone has a different combination of
[3308.48 - 3313.36] toxic heavy metals inside their brains
[3310.56 - 3315.36] in alzheimer's aluminum is commonly
[3313.36 - 3316.88] present along with mercury
[3315.36 - 3318.96] when that's the case aluminum in the
[3316.88 - 3320.96] brain will play a role and contribute to
[3318.96 - 3323.12] the disease that said
[3320.96 - 3324.00] you can also have alzheimer's without
[3323.12 - 3326.16] aluminum
[3324.00 - 3327.76] whereas you can't have alzheimer's with
[3326.16 - 3328.48] aluminum without mercury so here's how
[3327.76 - 3331.52] it works
[3328.48 - 3333.28] aluminum by itself you guys right
[3331.52 - 3335.20] aluminum by itself can't cause
[3333.28 - 3338.56] alzheimer's it can't
[3335.20 - 3339.84] i mean it can mess you up don't get me
[3338.56 - 3342.08] wrong
[3339.84 - 3343.84] but you gotta have mercury in there too
[3342.08 - 3345.12] with the aluminum to create alzheimer's
[3343.84 - 3346.56] you can even have mercury without
[3345.12 - 3347.36] aluminum and create the alzheimer's
[3346.56 - 3350.80] right
[3347.36 - 3354.24] so that's important to know all right
[3350.80 - 3358.40] so let's go the medical industry
[3354.24 - 3361.20] will never blame mercury for the con
[3358.40 - 3362.08] for any condition any condition at all
[3361.20 - 3365.04] do you know why
[3362.08 - 3366.40] because the medical industry is guilty
[3365.04 - 3370.16] guilty
[3366.40 - 3372.48] of putin mercury in a ton of drugs
[3370.16 - 3372.48] man
[3372.64 - 3379.20] you will never ever in your lifetime
[3375.76 - 3380.72] ever see the blame
[3379.20 - 3383.36] from the industry on mercury you'll
[3380.72 - 3386.40] never see the industry blame mercury for
[3383.36 - 3389.60] anything the medical industry
[3386.40 - 3391.36] is so guilty they got so much blood on
[3389.60 - 3394.88] their hands with mercury
[3391.36 - 3395.92] it would be a cut a trillion is there
[3394.88 - 3397.44] something called it could be is
[3395.92 - 3398.80] katrilian real
[3397.44 - 3400.96] what's the biggest number you could ever
[3398.80 - 3402.48] think of what's the biggest number
[3400.96 - 3403.92] is wasn't it something like a trillion
[3402.48 - 3405.20] zeros or something is that the biggest
[3403.92 - 3407.28] number with like
[3405.20 - 3408.32] a nine after it like what's the biggest
[3407.28 - 3410.00] number out there because i'm not a
[3408.32 - 3413.44] mathematician
[3410.00 - 3417.76] but i can tell you this that lawsuit
[3413.44 - 3420.72] would be that much money because you got
[3417.76 - 3422.20] a billion people dead because of mercury
[3420.72 - 3424.88] you got
[3422.20 - 3428.00] pharmaceuticals with mercury in them
[3424.88 - 3429.76] yeah keep those pharmaceuticals coming
[3428.00 - 3431.46] they all got mercury in them to some
[3429.76 - 3433.60] extent
[3431.46 - 3435.44] [Music]
[3433.60 - 3436.96] and so it's never going to get blamed
[3435.44 - 3440.24] for anything ever ever
[3436.96 - 3443.20] ever it's never going to ever get
[3440.24 - 3444.96] the blame instead some cosmetic doctor
[3443.20 - 3445.68] will come on the medical media platform
[3444.96 - 3448.00] and say
[3445.68 - 3450.96] there's no study that determines mercury
[3448.00 - 3454.16] has anything to do with alzheimer's
[3450.96 - 3455.68] that's what you'll get meanwhile just so
[3454.16 - 3457.12] yeah of course there isn't
[3455.68 - 3459.76] you're not going to put a study on
[3457.12 - 3461.92] something when literally the industry
[3459.76 - 3463.36] itself that's going to do the study has
[3461.92 - 3464.80] mercury and all their stuff and had
[3463.36 - 3466.48] mercury and all their stuff for so long
[3464.80 - 3467.28] including quicksilver going all the way
[3466.48 - 3470.00] back
[3467.28 - 3471.20] which i'll talk about in a second okay
[3470.00 - 3472.80] you're not
[3471.20 - 3475.04] fingers would be pointed into the
[3472.80 - 3478.08] direction of the mercury man
[3475.04 - 3482.24] whose true name is unknown
[3478.08 - 3485.68] uh illumination tell you anything
[3482.24 - 3488.88] if i say the word illumination
[3485.68 - 3489.76] is that close to illumination what's the
[3488.88 - 3493.28] word
[3489.76 - 3495.52] do you guys know the word hey baby paris
[3493.28 - 3496.88] you leave comments sometimes give shout
[3495.52 - 3498.56] out to you too
[3496.88 - 3500.00] because i know i got a shout out for you
[3498.56 - 3503.12] guys
[3500.00 - 3505.28] um you guys are awesome cindy yeah cindy

[3505.28 - 3510.96] yep exactly totally pretty funny
[3509.28 - 3512.48] michelle l guillain-barre i saw
[3510.96 - 3516.00] guillain-barre there the
[3512.48 - 3519.28] epstein barr key limbo so yeah
[3516.00 - 3522.24] so anyway the mercury man
[3519.28 - 3523.28] all right whose true name is unknown
[3522.24 - 3525.40] which
[3523.28 - 3528.40] giving you kind of like some hence
[3525.40 - 3528.40] illumination
[3528.84 - 3534.88] right that basically
[3531.52 - 3538.24] is is over everything in the industries
[3534.88 - 3540.32] controls the industries right
[3538.24 - 3542.16] okay his true name is unknown he's
[3540.32 - 3543.76] responsible for the original and very
[3542.16 - 3545.84] first good old boy industry it's the
[3543.76 - 3548.72] good old boy industry man
[3545.84 - 3550.24] mercury is the original good old boy
[3548.72 - 3553.36] industry
[3550.24 - 3554.76] that's what it is it's killed billions
[3553.36 - 3558.24] of people though
[3554.76 - 3562.00] worldwide billions of people
[3558.24 - 3563.36] um so it wants you
[3562.00 - 3565.28] it wants the medical industry to
[3563.36 - 3567.28] continue to use mercury in their medical
[3565.28 - 3569.28] treatments involving children and adults
[3567.28 - 3572.40] what
[3569.28 - 3573.92] what did i just say just reading the
[3572.40 - 3576.56] book
[3573.92 - 3578.32] so okay i've only covered the basics
[3576.56 - 3580.32] when it comes to the dirty secret of
[3578.32 - 3582.63] mercury that's just the basics that's
[3580.32 - 3584.00] just the basics you guys
[3582.63 - 3586.48] [Laughter]
[3584.00 - 3587.60] pretty funny aj all right medical medium
[3586.48 - 3592.00] revised
[3587.60 - 3594.32] and expanded new edition
[3592.00 - 3595.84] right you guys new addition let's talk
[3594.32 - 3599.12] about dental amalgams
[3595.84 - 3601.20] so about those let's get into that
[3599.12 - 3602.88] okay there's so much to read and talk
[3601.20 - 3604.48] about like you guys i could go to town
[3602.88 - 3606.08] we can talk like this is
[3604.48 - 3607.84] you know we can talk about some killer
[3606.08 - 3612.40] stuff right here
[3607.84 - 3612.40] all right dental amalgams
[3612.48 - 3617.44] dental amalgam fillings are another
[3615.12 - 3619.28] common source of exposure to mercury
[3617.44 - 3621.92] so many of us have had these silver
[3619.28 - 3624.00] fillings in our mouths
[3621.92 - 3626.16] i've been blessed to not have to have
[3624.00 - 3627.84] those silver fillings
[3626.16 - 3629.76] i've been blessed and i have to have you
[3627.84 - 3631.52] know fillings because
[3629.76 - 3633.28] all this fruit i'm eating should have
[3631.52 - 3634.56] rotted out every one of my teeth and i
[3633.28 - 3636.24] should have implants like all the
[3634.56 - 3638.16] podcast doctors that are all keto and
[3636.24 - 3640.16] tell you not to eat fruit
[3638.16 - 3641.76] i should have like no teeth left from
[3640.16 - 3643.28] all these oranges i sucked down every
[3641.76 - 3645.12] single day i must have eaten
[3643.28 - 3648.72] thousands and thousands of oranges i
[3645.12 - 3651.60] probably ate a hundred oranges last week
[3648.72 - 3652.88] um but yeah the podcast doctors who
[3651.60 - 3654.32] don't eat any fruit and tell you not to
[3652.88 - 3656.08] even touch a lemon they're
[3654.32 - 3658.88] just got all the veneers and they got
[3656.08 - 3661.28] all the implants 24 7.
[3658.88 - 3661.28] all right
[3662.32 - 3666.80] this is fun reading the new edition
[3665.28 - 3668.24] medical meme new edition talking about
[3666.80 - 3671.28] dental work
[3668.24 - 3673.20] all right let's go so many of us had
[3671.28 - 3673.68] these silver fillings in our mouths and
[3673.20 - 3677.28] had
[3673.68 - 3679.20] hat and have had them at one point right
[3677.28 - 3680.72] it's becoming popular to get all
[3679.20 - 3683.04] mercury-based fillings removed at a
[3680.72 - 3687.04] holistic dentist office do you know why
[3683.04 - 3689.44] because of medical medium 35 years
[3687.04 - 3691.20] of teaching about those mercury fillings
[3689.44 - 3693.44] going all the way back
[3691.20 - 3695.92] to the 80s when everybody thought they
[3693.44 - 3696.72] were perfect people got their mouths
[3695.92 - 3699.12] filled with it
[3696.72 - 3699.84] dentists were on board there was nothing
[3699.12 - 3702.08] bad about
[3699.84 - 3704.72] it there was no science there's no
[3702.08 - 3707.68] science now still
[3704.72 - 3709.44] all right this may seem sensible like
[3707.68 - 3711.04] the right thing to do
[3709.44 - 3712.48] but you have to be very careful about
[3711.04 - 3714.72] the process getting
[3712.48 - 3716.56] all of your amalgam fillings removed at
[3714.72 - 3718.08] the same time can lead to an extremely
[3716.56 - 3719.28] high level of mercury exposure
[3718.08 - 3721.20] regardless
[3719.28 - 3723.20] of the best techniques and protection
[3721.20 - 3725.12] available at the dentist office you know
[3723.20 - 3727.68] who agrees with me gina and masha
[3725.12 - 3729.20] check out the youtube episode medical
[3727.68 - 3733.12] meme youtube channel
[3729.20 - 3735.84] okay so masha and gina amazing dentists
[3733.12 - 3736.64] really good close friends of mine they
[3735.84 - 3738.96] came on
[3736.64 - 3740.08] the youtube episode with me you guys
[3738.96 - 3741.76] should you guys
[3740.08 - 3743.76] scroll down on youtube and find that
[3741.76 - 3747.76] episode
[3743.76 - 3747.76] see dr fon um
[3748.16 - 3753.60] so yeah so let's go on this a little bit
[3750.32 - 3755.28] more the exposure can put a heavy load
[3753.60 - 3756.80] on the immune system and also feed
[3755.28 - 3758.64] viruses so when you get your
[3756.80 - 3760.32] your mercury fillings out it can feed
[3758.64 - 3761.84] viruses all of a sudden boom you got
[3760.32 - 3762.40] extra mercury in there and look that can
[3761.84 - 3763.60] happen but
[3762.40 - 3765.44] it's what the heavy metal detox
[3763.60 - 3766.88] smoothies for right you can always ask
[3765.44 - 3768.08] your doctor if that's right for you but
[3766.88 - 3769.84] it's what i would recommend
[3768.08 - 3771.60] recommend my friends and family it's in
[3769.84 - 3773.20] the books it's in the book
[3771.60 - 3776.56] got the virus that feeds off of mercury
[3773.20 - 3778.32] when the mercury escapes and gets out
[3776.56 - 3780.64] okay and then when you get all of those
[3778.32 - 3782.88] mercury fillings at once then the
[3780.64 - 3784.16] bloodstream fills up and then all of a
[3782.88 - 3787.04] sudden now if you've got
[3784.16 - 3788.24] viral issues it can go into a massive
[3787.04 - 3791.44] kill-off
[3788.24 - 3793.28] of not the virus but a massive kill-off
[3791.44 - 3795.20] of your red blood count
[3793.28 - 3796.80] could lose your red blood count in a
[3795.20 - 3798.23] shot getting all your mercury fillings
[3796.80 - 3801.28] removed
[3798.23 - 3804.96] [Music]
[3801.28 - 3806.64] so the exposure is a trigger from those
[3804.96 - 3808.16] getting all those out it can trigger off
[3806.64 - 3810.00] any health conditions whether existing
[3808.16 - 3812.72] ones that flare up are new ones that
[3810.00 - 3813.20] develop from a dormant virus that was
[3812.72 - 3815.44] not
[3813.20 - 3816.96] active and then became active and then
[3815.44 - 3819.36] that's the re-ignition
[3816.96 - 3820.00] that's the re-ignition of epstein-barr
[3819.36 - 3822.56] okay
[3820.00 - 3824.16] the reigniting of it people are getting
[3822.56 - 3827.28] tested for that now because of medical
[3824.16 - 3831.52] medium books like this one
[3827.28 - 3833.92] anyway so i know people who have had 10
[3831.52 - 3837.04] fillings dug out at once and as a result
[3833.92 - 3840.48] their blood platelets dropped so low
[3837.04 - 3842.32] that they almost died it's best to
[3840.48 - 3845.12] remove metal fillings only when an
[3842.32 - 3848.16] individual tooth requires it
[3845.12 - 3850.80] hear that such as if the filling becomes
[3848.16 - 3852.96] unstable or the tooth is damaged
[3850.80 - 3853.92] if your teeth and fillings are all in
[3852.96 - 3855.52] good order
[3853.92 - 3857.20] and you're still anxious to have the
[3855.52 - 3860.16] amalgams removed then get
[3857.20 - 3862.56] only one taken out at a time schedule at
[3860.16 - 3864.80] least a month between each removal
[3862.56 - 3867.28] so you so you don't trigger that viral
[3864.80 - 3870.00] load and get yourself sick
[3867.28 - 3871.68] if you're ready if you already had all
