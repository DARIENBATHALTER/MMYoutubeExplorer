down at myself the soul is not inside

24
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,239
the heart it's why in the medieval times

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,739
they focused on beheading everybody

26
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,739
right and there was a reason for that

27
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,440
everybody knew that this was the most

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,180
important area you may have heard of the

the Headless Chicken was a chicken Mike

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,439
survived long after his head was cut off

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,420
they don't understand how a chicken can

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
get his head completely cut off and

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,799
still go around and eat through its neck

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320

Mike stayed alive a chicken has a soul

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,920
no that's not me saying it's Spirit of

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,740
compassion is saying a chicken has a

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,900
soul which resides in the chicken's

42
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,240
brain instead of floating away in The

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,579
Ether the chicken's Soul entered into

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,979
the chicken's body the soul of the

45
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,740
chicken gathered intelligence from the

46
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,320
chicken's brain and took it along with

47
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,299
the soul and then the Soul re-entered

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,040
into the chicken's physical body with

49
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,880
the intelligence of what was in the

50
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,780
brain

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,000
Mike's Soul had its own free will

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,759
that Free Will can determine if you're

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,879
