00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,759
medical medium community and that has

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,480
been attacking bullying harassing and

bakaro she's an alternative medicine

10

practitioner who became a whistleblower

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,640
after she witnessed this hateful group

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,079
in action when they tried to recruit her

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,320
to join them last year Amber caught the

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,440
main members of this group on legally

recorded calls describing their

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,680

about medical medium information to

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,519
Major media outlets in hopes that it

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,359
would lead to securing themselves a deal

22
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,519
for an anti-ed medium documentary on

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,479
Netflix that would bring Fame and other

24
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,640
benefits to them now known infamously

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,840

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,040
was caught on recording and exposed we

including competitors in the health

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,119
industry to try to frame medical medium

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,040
and take down the community what this

38

69
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,280
to be called out for what they've done

70
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,400
and are still doing the medical medium

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,920

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,640
attacked like this and we are going to

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,900
set the record straight as many times as

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,000
we need to

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:36,200
[Music]

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,519
all along Ashley Foster has had ulterior

77
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,640
motives all along Ashley Foster has been

78
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,120
wrong all along Ashley Foster has been

79
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,640
lying Ashley's original story about

80
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,720
Stephanie included the claim that

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,599
Anthony never told Stephanie to see a

82
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,840
doctor we've proven that wrong with

83
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,840
evidence even before we released the

84
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,720
evidence Ashley was publicly corrected

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,920
on this claim Years Ago by the husband

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,360
of one of Stephanie's friends friends

87
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,120
this husband was actually around for

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,239
what happened with Stephanie while

89
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,560
Ashley was not after being publicly

90
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,480
corrected Ashley pivoted and moved

91
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,479
forward with a new manufactured story

92
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,320
line the new Stephanie story became well

93
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,799
okay he told her to go to the doctor I

94
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,120
guess but it wasn't until the end after

95
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,600
it was too late we've proven that wrong

96
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,120
with evidence Ashley claimed that

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,880
Stephanie discovered her breast lump

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,600
while she was staying nights with Ashley

99
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,000
in

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,080
2016 we've proven that wrong with

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,600
evidence Stephanie did not develop the

102
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,720
breast lump until a whole year later in

103
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,160
2017 Ashley then claimed that Anthony in

104
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,800
2016 had told Stephanie that her breast

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,680
lump would never become cancerous we've

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,800
proven that very wrong with evidence

107
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,840
that is not possible because the breast

108
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,039
lump that was discovered in 2017 did not

109
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,919
exist in 2016 Ashley's story was

110
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,639
artificial

111
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
Ashley also claimed that Anthony told

112
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,360
Stephanie that she had hurt her back in

113
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,560
yoga but that Stephanie told Ashley that

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,560
she didn't remember hurting it in yoga

115
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,400
we've proven that wrong with evidence

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,639
Ashley said that Anthony's message to

117
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,440
Stephanie was to just lie still on the

118
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,680
floor we've proven that wrong with

119
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,880
evidence Ashley claimed that Stephanie

120
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,000
had done everything Anthony ever told

121
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,240
her to do we've proven that wrong with

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,080
evidence that's seven major falsities

123
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,919
that Ash was proven wrong on last year

124
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,360
seven major falsities that were designed

125
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,080
to tarnish Anthony's reputation and to

126
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,880
scare people away from applying medical

127
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,639
medium information to heal seven major

128
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,400
falsities that harmed many people's real

129
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,720
lives seven major falsities that Ashley

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,680
needs to be held accountable for among

131
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,400
all of the other falsities and lies that

132
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,919
have been produced by her since this is

133
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,199
the false story that Ashley took the

134
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,360
Vanity Fair when the journalist Dan

135
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,680
Adler reached out to me regarding the

136
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,400
hit piece she had him working on I was

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,840
sent a list of hundreds of questions the

138
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,160
questions that were asked line up and

139
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,919
coordinate exactly with Ashley's

140
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,319
original false Stephanie story from

141
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,800
2020 we are going to be reading off

142
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,280
those questions in an upcoming episode

143
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,560
Vanity Fair manipulated material and got

144
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,400
so many things wrong in the story they

145
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,400
published and that is going to be

146
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,199
thoroughly exposed in this series but

147
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,319
there 's a reason why even Vanity Fair

148
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,360
would not publish these falsities from

149
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,639
Ashley that Ashley wanted them to the

150
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,599
plots have since expressed dismay with

151
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,599
Vanity Fair by stating that the article

152
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:48,000
only quote skim the surface the article

153
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,080
is a lie it just isn't as big of a lie

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
as they wanted it to

155
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,680
be we held back on a lot last time

156
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,759
around with these podcast to give Ashley

157
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,840
an opportunity to do the right thing and

158
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,039
at the very least just stop lying and

159
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,280
spreading

160
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,240
misinformation not only has Ashley not

161
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,879
taken any accountability for the major

162
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,080
falsity she's been proven wrong on but

163
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,680
rather she has since continued on with

164
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,599
her deranged plot she's pivoted she's

165
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,160
created new false narratives and she's

166
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:20,240
manufactured and spread an unimaginable

167
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,280
number of New Lies I suspect that

168
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
another motive of Ashley's now is to try

169
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,599
to cover her tracks because we exposed

170
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,800
in a large scale that her original story

171
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,000
about Stephanie was fabricated and that

172
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,319
she was lying from the very beginning we

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,120
have also only just begun to publicize

174
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,560
the evidence of the true corruption that

175
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,440
took place in the process of Ashley and

176
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,960
the other plotters pushing their false

177
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,680
storyline onto Vanity Fair having to

178
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,720
hammer it into the head of the

179
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,199
journalist and having to threaten him to

180
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,759
get him to publish it yes you heard that

181
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,199
right if you're new to the series it's

182
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,199
all on recorded calls and there's a lot

183
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,120
more that's coming Ashley probably feels

184
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,599
like she has to keep going and trying to

185
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,720
come up with more lies and stories and

186
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,599
trying to drum up fake controversy to

187
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,680
keep up the facade so that she doesn't

188
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,080
look like the liar that she is but being

189
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,800
dishonest and manipulative can only ever

190
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,400
get you so far we are going to be

191
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,879
exposing all of it it's all coming out

192
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,039
now Ashley's pattern is that when she

193
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,720
gets proven wrong she pivots to other

194
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,080
topics and she deflects it's a tactic

195
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,199
meant to distract everyone who's

196
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,400
listening to her by throwing more

197
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,800
seemingly inflammatory false information

198
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,919
about Anthony at them to divert their

199
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,440
attention away from the fact that their

200
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:41,399
leader Ashley was proven wrong and is

201
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,399
lying so I implore anyone who's left out

202
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,880
there still taking Ashley seriously in

203
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,560
any way to ask themselves this if Ashley

204
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,120
is so principled about honesty and the

205
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,640
truth as she so claims then why hasn't

206
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,120
she addressed any one of these seven

207
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,120
major things that she spread online that

208
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,160
she brought to the media and that she

209
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,680
got so blatantly and provably wrong I

210
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,200
will let you sit with

211
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,360
that one of Ashley's true obsessions is

212
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,200
repeatedly declaring how perfectly

213
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,079
honest and morally Superior she is at

214
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,920
the same time as she incessantly calls

215
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:20,200
Anthony a liar sometimes multiple times

216
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,160
per day it seems like Ashley thinks if

217
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,560
she just repeats the words and accuses

218
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,880
him enough times that people will submit

219
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,440
and believe her regardless of how much

220
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
the substance of her arguments either

221
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,200
makes no sense at all or is just

222
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,720
verifiably wrong that is the definition

223
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,880
of true brainwashing and

224
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,720
indoctrination after our podcast came

225
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,880
out that exposed her and the other

226
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,200
individuals involved with this plot

227
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,839
using their own words on recording

228
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,560
Ashley really ramped up this behavior

229
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:53,680
for example on April 20th of 2023 Ashley

230
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,640
changed her Instagram bio to

231
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,079
read in case anyone comes looking for

232
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,760
information about mm/ Amber

233
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:05,120
frauds and

234
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,480
Liars of course she now attacks and

235
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,959
targets me as well because I am the one

236
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,240
who exposed her and her friends using

237
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,160
their own words on recordings around the

238
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,279
same time Ashley posted the following

239
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,560
comment and then deleted it along with

240
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,079
the post that was attached to it shortly

241
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,920
after

242
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:29,000
period I will die on this hill if

243
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,279
someone literally pointed a gun at me

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and ask me to say something other than

245
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:40,560
the truth I am telling I would not do it

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,760
if I don't have my Integrity I have

247
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,519
nothing when asked by a commenter do you

248
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,000
seriously believe your own

249
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,160
Ashley

250
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,120
replied I believe fully in the truth of

251
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:58,560
what I'm saying

252
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,480
yes and on May 5th of 2023 Ashley posted

253
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,200
this

254
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,839
when Anthony started spewing more of his

255
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,399
dark lies on his wacky and idiotic

256
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,240
podcast because of the impending Vanity

257
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,200
Fair article I realized just how

258
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,800
confused and lost people would

259
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,920
be Ashley has yet to produce a single

260
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,880
piece of legitimate evidence that

261
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,600
Anthony or I have lied about a single

262
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,680
thing she's only just continued to spin

263
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,560
ridiculous false stories get things

264
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,959
wrong spread ridiculous rumors and other

265
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,959
plotters who might think that they've

266
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,920
got something with posts on social media

267
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,240
they are very wrong and that will all be

268
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,240
exposed in due time meanwhile Ashley and

269
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,160
her hateful group continue to ignore the

270
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,519
fact that Ashley was proven wrong on

271
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,399
these seven major falsities and more

272
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,600
with evidence after the podcast came out

273
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,600
last year Ashley went on a whole Rampage

274
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,880
about lying as she tried to deflect

275
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,760
attention away from that in that Rampage

276
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,720
Ashley used a well-known true story

277
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,040
about the experiences of a family that

278
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,200
saved the lives of an estimated 800 Jews

279
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,959
and other refugees during the Holocaust

280
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,399
Ashley used the story to try to make a

281
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,639
ludicrous point about lying and in the

282
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:17,440
process of doing so Ashley ironically

283
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:19,560
got no less than 18 facts wrong she

284
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,800
expressed extremely offensive viewpoints

285
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,639
regarding the Holocaust she disgraced

286
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,600
the names of honorary women who risked

287
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,440
their lives to save others during World

288
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,560
War II and Ashley provided a perfect

289
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,920
example that every everyone can verify

290
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,279
of just How Deeply she manipulates

291
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,279
butchers and twists the story she tells

292
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,320
to serve her own agenda we are going to

293
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,399
read off what Ashley posted and then I'm

294
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,519
going to unpack all of the 18 things

295
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,800
that she got wrong one by one almost

296
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:52,120
every single sentence of Ashley's entire

297
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,320
series is wrong in some way the story of

298
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,680
the ten booom family was recounted in a

299
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,279
book called The Hiding Place written by

300
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,160
Corey tboom I read it cover to cover my

301
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,800
myself and anyone out there can use this

302
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,600
book to independently fact check

303
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,480
Ashley's false information for

304
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,040
themselves I encourage you to do so for

305
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,560
context here's some background on the

306
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,800
ten booom family from the official

307
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,199
website of the museum dedicated to

308
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,160
preserving its historical Legacy it says

309
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:20,800
during the second world war the tboom

310
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,720
home became a refuge a hiding place for

311
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,560
fugitives and those hunted by the Nazis

312
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,199
by protecting these people Casper and

313
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,839
his daughters Betsy and Corey risked

314
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:33,199
their lives this non-violent resistance

315
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,839
against the Nazi oppressors was the ten

316
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:39,199
boom's way of living out their Christian

317
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,920
faith during 1943 and into 1944 there

318
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,560
were usually five to six people

319
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,480
illegally living in the tboom home some

320
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,680
of whom were Jews and other members of

321
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,399
the Dutch underground additional

322
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,560
refugees would stay with the ten Booms

323
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,759
for a few hours or a few days until

324
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,199
another safe house could be located for

325
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,240
them through these activities the ten

326
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:00,920
booom family and their many friends and

327
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,120
co-workers of the B group saved the

328
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:08,040
lives of an estimated 800 Jews and other

329
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,160
refugees in July of last year Ashley

330
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,920
posted the following

331
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,480
series okay question do you believe that

332
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,440
sometimes lying to them is in people's

333
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,240
best

334
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:27,320
interest I am a lying is never the right

335
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:31,639
choice person no matter what I want to

336
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,880
share the story that convicted me of

337
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:38,000
this Betsy 10 boom was personally

338
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,959
convicted about honesty she and her

339
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,639
family including Corey T boom hid juice

340
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:48,360
in their house throughout World War II

341
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:52,440
and were eventually arrested Betsy died

342
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,440
in vve Brook concentration

343
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,160
camp okay already we have falsity number

344
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,160
one it was Betsy's sister nollie and

345
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
nollie's daughter cocky who were

346
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,240
convicted about honesty and struggled

347
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,440
with the concept of telling lies in

348
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,399
order to save Jewish life not Betsy

349
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,720
Betsy was clear in her stance that under

350
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,399
the circumstances of the Nazi regime it

351
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,160
was the right thing to do to lie when

352
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,880
necessary for the purposes of saving

353
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,079
innocent lives Ashley also got the name

354
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:25,519
of the Concentration Camp wrong it's

355
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:28,600
Raven's Brook not Rave Brook she

356
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,880
continues her sister Corey recounted a

357
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,880
story of Betsy's

358
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:37,160
honesty falsity number two again it was

359
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,480
not Betsy who was convicted about

360
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,360
honesty it was nollie and nollie's

361
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,360
daughter cocky and we've got falsity

362
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,279
number three here what Ashley is

363
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,120
referring to is not a singular story as

364
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,639
we go through the next several posts

365
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,000
you'll see that Ashley incorrectly

366
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,000
conflated multiple stories of separate

367
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,720
instances once when German soldiers came

368
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,279
to search the house there was not time

369
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,600
for the Jews staying with them at that

370
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:10,040
time to fully hide so they hid onto the

371
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,040
kitchen

372
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,880
table we've got falsity number four the

373
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,920
incident involving the kitchen table in

374
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,040
fact occurred when there was a ria a ria

375
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,120
was a hostile raid during which the

376
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,279
Germans would come to forcibly enlist

377
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,120
young males in Holland to work in

378
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,920
Munitions factories the tboom family had

379
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,240
the young men in in their household hide

380
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,120
in a cellar with a trapo underneath the

381
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,079
kitchen table we've got falsity number

382
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,759
five the target of this raid was not

383
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,360
Jews to be placed in concentration camps

384
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,199
it was Dutch boys like Corey's nephews

385
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,000
that the Nazis wanted to enlist to work

386
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,279
in

387
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,839
factories and falsity number six during

388
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,519
the Razia Cory's nephews did not hide

389
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,720
underneath the table because they didn't

390
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,560
have enough time to quote fully hide

391
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,040
there was actually a Cellar underneath

392
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,240
the kitchen table that had been

393
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,720
specifically designed for hiding from

394
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,559
Nazi soldiers and other threats The

395
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,959
Cellar under the table is exactly where

396
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:13,000
the boys intended to

397
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:16,559
go a German soldier asked Betsy directly

398
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,160
are there any Jews hiding in this

399
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,959
house falsity number seven this is not

400
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,079
the question that was asked in fact the

401
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,839
German Soldier asked where are your

402
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:31,400
brothers do you have brothers how old

403
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,080
are they where are they now again in

404
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,120
this incident the soldiers were looking

405
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:39,720
for Dutch boys not Jews and falsity

406
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,720
number eight it was not Betsy who the

407
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:47,360
soldiers questioned it was cocky Betsy's

408
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,799
niece she said yes they are under the

409
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,799
kitchen

410
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,919
table falsity number nine this is not

411
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,559
what happened cocky not Betsy at first

412
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,520
tried to avoid the question next when

413
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,760
pressured cocky tells the soldiers that

414
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,080
two of her brothers were under the table

415
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,360
but then cocky burst out laughing which

416
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,039
tricked them the Nazis thought that she

417
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,559
was joking they got upset and they left

418
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,960
the soldiers did not capture any of the

419
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,240
boys her sister Corey was horrified and

420
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,840
crushed the couple was arrested and

421
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,960
taken away to a concentration camp Betsy

422
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,960
held fast to her

423
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,799
conviction this post unbelievably has

424
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,559
four falsities in one falsity number 10

425
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,440
this is where Ashley began conflating

426
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,760
different incidents there was a

427
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,600
different event separate from the

428
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,440
kitchen table story in which one

429
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,640
individual woman not a couple was taken

430
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,799
away to the old Jewish theater in

431
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,360
Amsterdam the theater was a holding

432
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,600
place from which Jews could be

433
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,720
transported to concentration camps it

434
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,039
was not a concentration camp

435
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,640
itself falsity number 11 even in this

436
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,480
other incident that occurred at a

437
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,760
completely different time than the

438
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,760
kitchen table Story the Jewish woman who

439
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,799
was captured Analise was never taken to

440
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:13,520
a concentration camp falsity number 12

441
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,480
Corey was not horrified nor crushed by

442
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,640
the kitchen table incident the kitchen

443
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,799
table incident in fact made Corey start

444
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,840
to question the logic of nollie and her

445
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,480
daughter cocky who nearly gave her

446
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,159
brothers up to the Nazis Corey was

447
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,200
horrified and crushed by the theater

448
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,280
incident that resulted in Analise being

449
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,159
captured by by the Nazis which happened

450
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,559
later

451
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:37,600
on falsity number 13 it was not Betsy

452
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,840
who held fast to her conviction it was

453
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,200
nollie and it was in a completely

454
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,080
different

455
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,559
incident less than a week later the

456
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,159
Concentration Camp those Jews were taken

457
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,280
to was liberated by Allied Forces and

458
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,000
everyone there was transported to

459
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,440
Freedom including the couple that had

460
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,320
been in hiding

461
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,960
and this one post from Ashley shockingly

462
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,400
has five falsities in it falsity number

463
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,200
14 the kitchen table incident was

464
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,400
further than a week apart from this

465
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,280
event Ashley conflated different

466
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,159
incidents and got the timeline wrong

467
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,880
falsity number 15 in the other story

468
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,200
involving Analise it was not a

469
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,320
concentration camp that got liberated an

470
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,679
aisee was being held in the old Jewish

471
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,120
theater and the theater was broken into

472
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,120
falsity number 16 the book does not

473
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,280
specify that the theater was broken into

474
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,919
by Allied Forces falsity number 17 not

475
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,159
everyone in the theater was transported

476
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:44,080
to Freedom only 40 Jews were rescued and

477
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,360
it was not a concentration camp that

478
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,159
they were coming

479
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,440
from and falsity number 18 Analise was

480
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,440
part of those 40 rescued Jews but she

481
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,640
was not part of a couple like Ashley

482
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,480
said it is not our job to control the

483
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,440
outcome of our action ctions it is not

484
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,400
our job to decide how and when the truth

485
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:12,400
should be known we either believe in the

486
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,400
immutable importance of it or we don't

487
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,440
period here Ashley concludes her

488
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,840
mutilated version of this story by

489
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,919
asserting her ridiculous Viewpoint that

490
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,880
anyone who lied to the Nazis to protect

491
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,799
and save the lives of Jews during the

492
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,039
Holocaust was morally wrong following

493
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,400
her as

494
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,919
logic Ashley is saying that she believes

495
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,400
everyone should have been honest with

496
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,159
the Nazi soldiers even if it led to more

497
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,679
Jews being Mass

498
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,520
murdered Ashley declares that one should

499
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,000
not be concerned with the consequences

500
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,400
of their actions even in the context of

501
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,760
the holocost and even if their actions

502
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,320
Ena

503
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,320
genocide truly

504
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:57,520
unbelievable people who lie are liars if

505
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,760
you're willing to lie about one thing

506
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,919
you might be willing to lie about

507
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,320
everything One Lie calls into question

508
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:11,279
the entirety of someone's

509
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,279
character what about 2 three 4 100

510
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:19,279
lies I mean how much more ironic could

511
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:22,200
this possibly be Ashley Foster told 18

512
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,039
falsities 18 falsities in a story she

513
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,000
tried to use to make an absurd point

514
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,919
about lying this series was all about

515
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,880
Ashley's Doctrine on always being honest

516
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,600
which Ashley claims she aderes to

517
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,880
perfectly and she's literally violating

518
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,360
that in the very story she used to try

519
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,200
to make that

520
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,880
point and then here Ashley even went as

521
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,000
far as to use derogatory terms to refer

522
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,880
to what the tboom family heroically did

523
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,960
to protect and save the lives of 800

524
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,919
innocent people from being murdered if

525
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,080
the members of the tboom family did not

526
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,720
lie to the Nazi oppressors who were

527
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,919
committing atrocities those 800 Jews

528
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,200
would have died and Ashley has the

529
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,600
audacity to call into question the

530
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,200
entirety of the ten booom family's

531
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,000
character who cares if people are being

532
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,679
tortured abused and murdered it's not

533
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,880
your job to worry at all about the

534
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,039
consequences of your actions what's

535
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,880
important according to Ashley is that

536
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,640
you try to prove your own superiority

537
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,279
like she's trying to do with this warped

538
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,600
story that she

539
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:28,159
invented this is not about promoting

540
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,120
lying it's about having sanity Ashley

541
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,520
could have used anything any other story

542
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,919
or anecdote or something else to express

543
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,039
herself and make the claim that she

544
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:42,480
doesn't believe in lying but to use this

545
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,039
story in this way let alone distorting

546
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,960
it with 18 falsities in the process to

547
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,520
say that when faced with Nazis asking

548
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,640
about Jews hiding in your home during

549
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,440
the Holocaust knowing that they are

550
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,880
going to be taken to a concentration

551
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,919
camp Ashley saying that she would give

552
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,559
up the Jews it's a window into how

553
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,720
Ashley thinks this is what we're dealing

554
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,960
with who in their right mind thinks like

555
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,840
this Ashley's entire false story about

556
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,760
Stephanie was built on her original

557
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,080
claim I never told Stephanie to see a

558
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,400
doctor and not once did Ashley ever

559
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,840
reach out to me or call me up and say

560
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,799
hey what's up did you tell Stephanie to

561
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,399
see a doctor but because she lied she

562
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,600
had a save face and stay with the LIE

563
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:32,880
and that takes a certain kind of person

564
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,799
a person who doesn't want to admit a

565
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,520
huge mistake a person who doesn't want

566
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:43,080
to come clean and keeps going making

567
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,600
more huge false claims lies and mistakes

568
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,919
if anyone wants a window into Ashley's

569
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,799
mind it's this Holocaust story tell

570
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,840
dozens and dozens of lies and falsities

571
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:57,840
and then say how one should never tell a

572
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,799
lie so much so that it's best to just

573
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,880
call out the Jews hiding underneath the

574
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:05,640
table to the Nazis you have the daughter

575
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,559
of a billionaire family that lies and

576
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,640
tells falsities and she's using this

577
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,399
false story about the Holocaust to try

578
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,200
to give you permission to not care about

579
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:20,039
the consequences of your actions this is

580
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,399
the entitlement of Ashley who doesn't

581
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,559
care about who gets harmed by a false

582
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:29,120
story she just wants her documentary she

583
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,960
doesn't care who's in the way

584
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,039
when Ashley's business proposals got

585
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,640
turned down by Anthony and her big

586
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,039
career dreams didn't work out the way

587
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,640
that she wanted them to Ashley set out

588
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,000
on this mission to tear Anthony down to

589
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,960
constantly take stabs at him to try to

590
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,919
blast him in the media to attack him to

591
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,640
put him and the entire medical medium

592
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,440
Community down to be little and demean

593
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,360
them to try to make them feel small and

594
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,159
there is no low that she will not stoop

595
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,559
to in her

596
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,600
Pursuit what makes Ashley serious on

597
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,480
lying even more of an absolute farce is

598
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,880
the fact that Ashley Gravely missed the

599
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,399
mark on what the actual ten booom story

600
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,840
portrays about lying which is very

601
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:13,080
different from the story that Ashley

602
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,919
seems to have made up in her head Betsy

603
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,520
and Cory ten booom took on the role of

604
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:20,480
protecting and saving Jews they are the

605
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,679
heroes of the story their sister nollie

606
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,320
and nollie's daughter cocky are the ones

607
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,200
who were struggling with the concept of

608
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,679
lying not Betsy whom Ashley confused

609
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,880
them with throughout the story nollie's

610
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,880
family pointed out nollie's illogic

611
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,080
nollie was still doing lies with her

612
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,080
actions even if she wouldn't tell lies

613
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,399
from her lips with words and nalo taught

614
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,600
her daughter to think in the same

615
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:46,760
illogical

616
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,520
way for example to nollie as well as

617
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,679
cocky it was okay to partake in creating

618
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,279
the hiding place in the cellar under the

619
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,039
kitchen table for her sons to deceive

620
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:59,399
and hide from German soldiers in but

621
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,000
when the soldiers asked cocky a question

622
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:03,279
she felt that she must tell the truth

623
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,240
from her lips even though it nearly

624
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,000
harmed her own brothers and then cocky

625
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,960
also burst out laughing during this

626
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,760
incident which made it seem like she was

627
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,880
joking about the boys being under the

628
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,240
table and that was not truthful it was

629
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,799
an inconsistency that was directly

630
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,880
addressed in the book itself such as in

631
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:25,360
the following excerpt written by Corey

632
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,399
tboom it says it was a strange dinner

633
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,000
party that evening veering as it did

634
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:30,880
from heartfelt Thanksgiving to the

635
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,720
nearest thing to a bitter argument our

636
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,960
close-nit family has ever had nollie

637
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,039
stuck by cocky insisting she would have

638
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,880
answer the same way God honors truth

639
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,279
telling with Perfect protection Peter

640
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,399
and Bob from the Viewpoint of the trapo

641
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:49,679
weren't so sure and neither was I I

642
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:52,279
could spot the illogic and it isn't

643
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,480
logical to say the truth and do a lie

644
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:58,320
what about analise's false papers and

645
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,760
that maid's uniform on Katrine

646
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,240
nonetheless Ashley goes on to end her

647
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:07,320
depraved series with the following

648
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,159
quote choose your Leaders with wisdom

649
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,120
and

650
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:16,519
forethought to be led by a liar is to

651
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,519
ask to be told lies Octavia E

652
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,559
Butler 18 falsities later and on top of

653
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,760
the repulsive spin she put on a

654
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,679
holocaust story Ashley also disrespected

655
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,399
the names of true heroes but ET and Cory

656
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,039
tboom were incredible honorable

657
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,360
leaders by demonizing the decisions

658
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,720
these women made under entirely evil

659
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,000
circumstances in order to save hundreds

660
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,480
of people's lives Ashley utterly

661
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,240
disgraces the ten booom Legacy and all

662
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,960
of those who fought the absolutely

663
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,760
reprehensible acts of the Nazi regime

664
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,679
including the 6 million Jews who

665
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,840
perished during the

666
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,840
Holocaust and then of course what

667
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:01,279
Ashley's inferring with all of this is

668
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,760
that I'm a liar and that she's not she's

669
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,720
saying that she's such an honest person

670
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,760
she wouldn't even lie to protect a Jew

671
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,120
during the Holocaust while she's telling

672
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:16,200
a story herself with 18 falsities in

673
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:19,679
it this is Ashley's pattern she accuses

674
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:23,519
people of what she's actually doing

675
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,480
Ashley lies Ashley tells false stories

676
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,960
Ashley's version of The Hiding Place

677
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,559

told a total of 78 verifiable lies and

693
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,039
falsities for someone who supposedly

694
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,000
feels so strongly about the truth that

695
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:16,200
she believes it's not even right to lie

696
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,559
to save a Jew's life during the

697
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,519
Holocaust for someone who claimed that

698
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,360
they are a lying is never the right

699
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,519

705
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,360
second in addition to the immeasurable

706
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,880
number of falsities and flat out lies

707
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,159
Ashley has continued to spew in the last

708
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,440
year like saying that her family doesn't

709
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,480
have a private jet or vacation homes

710
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,480
when they do and that she's never made

711
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,880
money off of Instagram when she has

712
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,600
Ashley also has a document Ed record of

713
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,159
instructing other people to lie and be

714
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,639
dishonest for her in fact I am one of

715
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,399
those people in my calls with the

716
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:11,919
plotters last year after they had

717
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:15,320
explained their plan to smear Anthony

718
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,159
and try to create a postmed medium era

719
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,919
Ashley said this to

720
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,679

721
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:26,559

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,559

with oh anything with Anthony until it's

727
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,440
the right time it's a little bit of a

728
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,000
it's a little bit of a d Dynamite like a

729
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,000
loaded situation right

730
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,960

wouldn't tell Anthony the plotters and

737
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,200
Ashley specifically wanted me to keep

738
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:16,679
everything they told me a secret from

739
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,880
Anthony if Anthony had reached out and

740
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,960
asked me what was going on Ashley's

741
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,919
expectation was that I was supposed to

742
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,960
lie to him Ashley apparently believes

743
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,960
it's never the right choice to lie not

744
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,279
under any circumstance no matter what

745
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,639
but not even to save people's lives

746
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:33,880
during the

747
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:36,279
Holocaust except when Ashley wanted me

748
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,639
to lie for the benefit of her and her

749
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:42,480
friends that was somehow

750
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:45,399
okay on July 16th of 2018 a friend

751
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,240
texted Ashley and said by the way a pure

752
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:49,279
encapsulations order I placed went

753
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,840
missing and they are calling me but just

754
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:55,000
in case they accidentally call your

755
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,440
number that's why haha and Ashley

756
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
replied okay just tell them I plac the

757
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,559
order for you because I'm not supposed

758
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,600
to let people use my account

759
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,679
LOL so here Ashley is letting a friend

760
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,320
use her supplement purchasing account

761
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,120
and she's acknowledging that she's not

762
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,240
supposed to this is what Corey and Betsy

763
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,559
tboom from The Hiding Place story that

764
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,480
Ashley referenced would call doing a lie

765
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,440
then Ashley's also instructing her

766
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,960
friend in this text to lie about who

767
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,320
placed her supplement order as her

768
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,480
actions make very clear Ashley said she

769
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,760
is a lying is never the right choice

770
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,440
type of person only because that suited

771
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,600
her Narrative of the moment as that is

772
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,440
obviously not something Ashley actually

773
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,279
believes in or lives

774
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,519
by again we're not arguing for or

775
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,679
against the morality of lying here I'm

776
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,799
simply pointing out the absolutely

777
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,600
unhinged contradictions in Ashley's own

778
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:55,039
thinking writing speech and

779
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,279
behavior since the beginning of Ashley's

780
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,440
mission to smear Anthony Ashley has

781
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,080
attempted to shield and cover for her

782
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,159
falsities by saying that she's just

783
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,399
sharing her truth she's also tried to

784
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,359
infer credibility based on her purported

785
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,879
direct experience with Stephanie for a

786
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:12,480
short period of time in the comment

787
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,000
section of a post Ashley made on

788
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:19,480
February 11th of 20120 she said

789
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,359
this the reason I chose to share exactly

790
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,240
what I did about her story is because I

791
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,159
was there for that small part and

792
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,679
physically present with her so I felt

793
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,679
like something I could share

794
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,320
truthfully in this comment Ashley is

795
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,119
referring to the false timeline that she

796
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,760
also repeated later on in 2020 in which

797
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,320
Ashley stated that Stephanie had

798
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,040
discovered her breast lump while

799
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,119
Stephanie was staying with Ashley in

800
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,399
2016 as we've shared many times this is

801
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,800
incorrect the evidence clearly shows

802
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:54,679
that Stephanie discovered her breast

803
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,640
lump on March 6th of 2017 a whole year

804
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,400
after the timeline of Ashley's fake

805
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,720
story Ashley was not with Stephanie when

806
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,800
Stephanie discovered her breast lump in

807
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,040
2017 as we discussed previously Ashley

808
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,599
admitted that she did not see Stephanie

809
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,320
once during the entire two years that

810
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,240
passed between the time that Stephanie

811
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,640
stayed in Ashley's home in 2016 and the

812
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,119
time that Stephanie passed away in

813
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,800
2018 Ashley did not visit Stephanie

814
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,200
during the time of her injury nor when

815
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,079
Stephanie was in the hospital Ashley's

816
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,160
even admitted that she barely kept in

817
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,680
communication with Stephanie at all

818
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,960
during the time of her injury on March

819
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,280
6th of 2020 she wrote

820
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,560
this stephani I didn't talk often during

821
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,440
her back

822
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,040
injury the truth is that Ashley was not

823
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,880
physically present for any single part

824
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,680
of Stephanie's entire Journey with her

825
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,880
breast lump her back injury her cancer

826
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,000
or her passing so not only is ashly

827
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,800
devoid of facts but the single leg of

828
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,599
credibility she tried to stand on by

829
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,359
saying that she was physically present

830
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,359
for a small portion of what Stephanie

831
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,880
experienced with her breast lump is a

832
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:06,640
lie after the release of our first four

833
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,520
podcasts in which we presented a large

834
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,920
amount of evidence that disproved

835
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,880
Ashley's false storylines Ashley got a

836
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,720
lot of push back for what she had done

837
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,839
and the falsities she was continuing to

838
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,480
try to spread in response to this push

839
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:23,520
back Ashley continued to Pedal the I'm

840
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,839
just sharing my truth narrative it's a

841
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,240
tactic to try to evade being held to an

842
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,680
objective standard of the

843
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,400
truth rather than presenting legitimate

844
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:37,240
facts or evidence Ashley constantly uses

845
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:40,319
and relies upon someone told me I was

846
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,800
there for it I experienced it personally

847
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:45,319
or I heard a rumor statements which

848
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,119
cannot be verified and of course can

849
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:50,880
easily be fabricated and even if it were

850
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:54,000
a valid pass that she's just sharing her

851
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,680
truth Ashley can't even get her truth

852
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,839
straight in all of Ashley's attempts to

853
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,319
make Anthony medical medium information

854
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,599
look bad she's told numerous stories

855
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,880
multiple times in completely different

856
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,440
contradictory versions that cannot all

857
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,880
be true at the same time here is an

858
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,040
example of a storyline Ashley told four

859
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,440
different versions of on February 11th

860
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,440
of 2020 when Ashley first started

861
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,119
posting false information about what had

862
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,000
happened to Stephanie she got a

863
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:26,000
commenter who said I find this very hard

864
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,520
to believe and Ashley

865
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,960
replied that's okay okay I understand I

866
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,160
worked really hard while writing this to

867
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,599
make sure everything I wrote was

868
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,359
absolutely true and not opinion the

869
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,280
truth is she was a close friend of his

870
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:46,280
for several years and had followed his

871
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,160
protocol more exactly than anyone else

872
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:53,359
I've ever met for that entire

873
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,359
time in this version Ashley's saying

874
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,880
that from her own perspective she

875
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:00,640
observed that Stephanie followed

876
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,000
Anthony's protocol more exactly than

877
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,079
anyone else she's ever met for that

878
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,720
entire

879
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,560
time those who actually understand

880
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,560
medical medium information know that

881
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,240
there is no one medical medium protocol

882
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,200
anyway so this is a problematic

883
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,680
statement in and of itself but then in

884
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,880
the second version of this same

885
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,280
statement Ashley says something similar

886
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,119
but adds to it on March 6th of 2020

887
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,520
Ashley posted

888
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:33,119
this and allow me to be clear I have

889
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,920
never met to this day anyone who

890
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:40,800
followed Anthony's advice more closely

891
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,800
than Steph not even Anthony

892
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,119
himself she told this version now with

893
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,359
the addition of not even Anthony himself

894
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,880
in at least two different places which

895
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,240
is ridiculous because Ashley had no idea

896
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,960
what Anthony was eating or not eating as

897
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,720
they were not nearly as close as she

898
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,040
constantly tries to portray it to be in

899
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,160
the third version from May 5th of last

900
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,119
year she says something

901
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:11,440
different also I don't want to be rude

902
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:13,560
but you're patently wrong some of us

903
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,440
here have studied and applied his

904
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:19,800
information more carefully than even

905
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,319
Anthony himself that's something he told

906
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,319
Steph

907
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,960
once so now instead of Ashley making the

908
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,000
statement about Stephanie like she did

909
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,520
in the previous two versions she's

910
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,880
changed the subject of the story to some

911
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,400
of us here have applied the information

912
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,599
better than Anthony

913
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,640
himself Stephanie passed away in 2018

914
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,920
and again Ashley posted this version

915
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,960
last year

916
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,839
2023 does she mean by some of us here

917
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,359
that her and her co- plotters have

918
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,480
followed and applied medical medium

919
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,040
information better than Anthony that's

920
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,000
laughable and instead of this being an

921
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,359
observation from her own perspective

922
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,359
like it was in the previous two versions

923
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:05,359
Ashley's changed it to this is something

924
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:10,599
Anthony told Stephanie

925
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,599
once in the fourth version Ashley says

926
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:17,079
this remember when Anthony claimed Steph

927
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:21,359
didn't follow his protocols well enough

928
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:23,839
what a lie from the pit of Hell Anthony

929
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,000
told me personally one time that Steph

930
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,319
followed his protocols even better than

931
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,319
he

932
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,920
Dead first of all because Ashley

933
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,880
literally gets everything wrong I have

934
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,240
to clear this up Anthony has never said

935
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,400
that Stephanie didn't follow his

936
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,119
protocols well enough absolutely never

937
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,880
said it in previous podcast episodes we

938
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,400
simply debunked Ashley's falsity that

939
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,960
Stephanie had followed medical medium

940
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,400
information to a te we used multiple

941
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,079
pieces of evidence to show that

942
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,560
Stephanie factually did not follow it to

943
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,200
a te there was no implication made that

944
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,599
Stephanie should have done anything

945
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,640
better or differently in fact we played

946
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,920
an audio message from Stephanie in which

947
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,960
she had said that she knew that Anthony

948
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,520
wasn't a fan of the Dr Morse grape fast

949
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,240
that Stephanie said she was quote hooked

950
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,480
on doing but that she was doing them

951
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,079
anyway and that Anthony was not pushing

952
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,680
her to do medical medium instead anyone

953
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:23,880
can go back and listen to our previous

954
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,200
episodes to verify that Stephanie

955
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,720
partook in lots of different modalities

956
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,720
and health approaches at times I would

957
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,640
say this is fine or that is fine because

958
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,160
Stephanie was on her own path doing her

959
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,400
own raw food thing and as she said in

960
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,760
the audio she was already hooked on

961
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,079
certain things so I was supportive of

962
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,119
Stephanie doing what she wanted to do I

963
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,319
did not control Stephanie's decisions or

964
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:53,359
even try to instead I supported her in

965
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:56,319
any decision she made with things that

966
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:59,079
spoke to her even if it wasn't medical

967
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:01,960
medium they're trying to punish me for

968
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:04,119
not controlling Stephanie's wishes and

969
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,960
health choices and then they're also

970
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:09,680
trying to punish me and blame me for

971
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,480
supposedly controlling them this is very

972
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,160
abusive behavior on their

973
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,160
part Ashley said that Anthony's claim

974
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:21,160
was a lie from the pit of Hell when

975
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,400
Ashley fully made up the claim he never

976
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,800
said it what we did share on the podcast

977
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,359
was hard evidence from Stephanie herself

978
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,280
far from a lie and Ashley saying all of

979
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:33,920
this at the same time as she herself is

980
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,640
telling an actual lie as part of a story

981
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,800
she told four different contradictory

982
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,680
versions of in this fourth version of

983
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,640
the same story from Ashley about what

984
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,359
Stephanie was eating and doing instead

985
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,839
of the statement being an observation

986
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,599
from Ashley's own perspective or

987
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,440
something Anthony told Stephanie once

988
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:57,200
like Ashley said previously now she's

989
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,240
changed it to Anthony told Ashley that

990
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,760
Stephanie followed his protocols even

991
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,720
better than he did so which is it all of

992
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,559
these four story versions contradict

993
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,640
themselves and they cannot all be true

994
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,880
at the same time that is because Ashley

995
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,079
is lying and she can't even keep her own

996
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,559
madeup story

997
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:19,160
straight Ashley did not know what I was

998
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,800
eating I didn't speak to Ashley about

999
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,480
how I ate I didn't tell Ashley that

1000
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,800
Stephanie ate better than me I never

1001
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,400
talked to Ashley about Stephanie at all

1002
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,200
so it's not even possible I never told

1003
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,480
Stephanie that Stephanie eats better

1004
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,640
than me Ashley's just fabricating

1005
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,720
stories

1006
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,359
again furthermore Ashley has admitted

1007
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,720
that she isn't really that versed in

1008
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,920
medical medium information in a live

1009
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:50,319
stream she did in 2020 she said

1010
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,720
this all right will I read his new book

1011
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,760
I honestly haven't read like the last

1012
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,440
three probably if I'm being really

1013
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,280
honest

1014
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,040
she honestly hasn't read like the last

1015
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,520
three books this was in 2020 in

1016
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,160
reference to when the cleanse to heal

1017
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,640
book was coming out so it was before

1018
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,319
medical medium revised and expanded and

1019
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,520
it was also before the brains saer books

1020
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:16,440
that means Ashley basically only

1021
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,559
supposedly read the first two out of

1022
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,800
what's now nine books Ashley didn't read

1023
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,960
thyroid healing Liver Rescue celery

1024
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,480
juice cleanse to heal medical medium

1025
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,480
revised brainsaver 1 or brain saver 2

1026
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,000
Ashley has hardly read any medical

1027
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,520
medium material and it shows which makes

1028
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,200
her far from an expert on medical medium

1029
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,680
information so how would Ashley know

1030
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,040
that Stephanie was following medical

1031
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,559
medium information to the letter or not

1032
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,960
if Ashley doesn't even know medical

1033
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,520
medium

1034
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,440
information what's even more insane is

1035
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,599
that there are more examples of Ashley

1036
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,520
telling multiple completely different

1037
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:55,920
contradictory versions of the same story

1038
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,480
the one I'm going to unpack now is one

1039
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,920
that Ashley has told nine different

1040
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,480
versions of would you trust someone who

1041
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,280
has nine different versions of the same

1042
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,640
story about something this one is jam

1043
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,520
packed with falsities and fiction so

1044
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,480
bear with us as we unload this pile of

1045
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,000
crap onto the public this is the

1046
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,240
infamous cat

1047
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
story Ashley's son was sick with a skin

1048
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,240
condition in 2018 he was a baby at the

1049
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,680
time and Ashley sought Anthony's help

1050
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,400
with it in 2019 a year later Ashley

1051
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,040
started publicly telling fake stories

1052
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,800
about this experience she's changed and

1053
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,960
adapted the story more and more with

1054
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,880
time in 2020 right after Ashley came out

1055
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,760
with her false story about Stephanie

1056
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,480
Ashley did a live stream and said that

1057
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,280
Anthony had gotten it wrong with her son

1058
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,839
because Anthony missed the fact that it

1059
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,240
was really a cat allergy that was behind

1060
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:52,559
his eczema

1061
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,400
outbreak this is a story that Ashley

1062
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,920
told me on my recorded calls with her as

1063
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,720
she was trying to convince me that is a

1064
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,200
liar it's a story that I later found out

1065
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,319
has been used many many times by Ashley

1066
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,400
to intentionally try to break people's

1067
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:08,760
trust and confidence in Anthony and in

1068
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,000
medical medium

1069
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,960
information most people who have turned

1070
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,359
against Anthony have heard it it's a

1071
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:20,520
story that Ashley is still telling to

1072
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:23,520
this day it's the cat story the cat

1073
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:26,599
story so as the real cat story was

1074
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,640
actually happening in real time in 2018

1075
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:30,680
there is is a documented record of

1076
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,800
Ashley telling the story correctly and

1077
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,760
consistently to four different people

1078
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,960
when Ashley's son was actively dealing

1079
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,480
with his eczema outbreak Ashley texted

1080
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,680
with Anthony Anthony's wife and two

1081
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,599
different friends about what was

1082
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,680
happening I have all the texts and these

1083
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,319
four truthful versions serve as a record

1084
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,240
for contrasting with all of the

1085
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:55,160
fabricated versions that Ashley has told

1086
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,640
since now since 2019 Ashley has told

1087
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,760
five false versions of the cat story

1088
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,280
that we are aware of and who knows how

1089
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,000
many other versions she's told that we

1090
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,119
haven't seen not only are these five

1091
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,640
versions false contradictory and

1092
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,680
different from the four truthful

1093
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,040
versions of the cat story from when it

1094
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,000
was happening in

1095
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,280
2018 but they're also each different

1096
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,880
from each other and they contradict one

1097
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,800
another I'm going to first play one

1098
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,040
rendition of Ashley's fake version of

1099
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,960
the cat story which was told during her

1100
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,880
April 1st 2020 live stream we are

1101
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,920
redacting the name of Ashley's son for

1102
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,559
his privacy so every time you hear a

1103
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,280
bleep throughout the series it's someone

1104
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,520
saying Ashley's son's name or in one

1105
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,200
instance the name of another one of

1106
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:42,200
Ashley's

1107
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:44,079
children in regards to it's interesting

1108
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,079
I feel like it's another thing that just

1109
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,240
stood out to me as concerning um when

1110
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,359
got really bad eczema of course Anthony

1111
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,040
and I were really close and I had

1112
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:56,440
followed medical medium approach during

1113
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:59,079
pregnancy and so it was like holy cow

1114
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:03,440
what is going on of course I called

1115
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:06,520
Anthony about it and um we talked he

1116
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,200
changed my diet a lot uh well not a lot

1117
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,359
but he was very clear about like you

1118
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,359
need to cut out almost all fat except

1119
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,000
avocado from your diet I was doing like

1120
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:18,800
more of the cashews and the nuts and

1121
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,800
seeds and stuff

1122
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:25,200
um and so I did I I took that out of my

1123
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:28,400
diet and

1124
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,160
um and slowly started to get a little

1125
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,839
bit better over the course of the next 6

1126
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,280
months until he finally healed but the

1127
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:40,200
actual turning point in his healing came

1128
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,400
when we went to Hawaii and realized that

1129
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,359
he was severely allergic to cats cuz he

1130
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,559
was doing really well and then we

1131
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:50,760
changed airbnbs to an Airbnb where there

1132
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:52,720
was a cat and he started breaking out in

1133
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,200
eczema again like the following morning

1134
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:59,640
just like full body

1135
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,640
hives um and so we realized oh he has a

1136
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,200
cat

1137
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,520
allergy um and that was causing like the

1138
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,599
bulk of the problem and so I just find

1139
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,200
it curious that in talking to Anthony

1140
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:11,720
like why wouldn't he have mentioned like

1141
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,880
yes you can make all these dietary

1142
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:18,319
changes but also the fact that you got a

1143
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:20,880
cat four weeks ago is probably the real

1144
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,799
problem so Ashley was breastfeeding her

1145
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,839
baby during this time and what she was

1146
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:27,160
eating had the ability to impact her son

1147
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:29,359
through her breast milk Ashley is saying

1148
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,240
here that she was doing nuts and seeds

1149
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:34,160
and that Anthony had told her to cut out

1150
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,280
almost all fat except avocado she's

1151
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,400
saying that when she did that her son's

1152
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:41,559
eczema started to improve gradually

1153
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,000
until it healed completely but that she

1154
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,680
on her own realized that the actual

1155
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,280
turning point was when they were in an

1156
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:51,160
Airbnb in Hawaii with a cat in it and

1157
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,960
her baby broke out in eczema again

1158
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,520
Ashley is saying that she realized that

1159
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,160
he was reacting due to a cat allergy

1160
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,760
that Anthony had

1161
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,400
missed sounds convincing right if Ashley

1162
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,440
had reached out to you on Instagram like

1163
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,720
she's doing to many people tried to

1164
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,760
recruit you into her hateful group and

1165
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,520
told you the story what would you think

1166
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,760
why didn't Anthony catch that it was a

1167
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,720
cat allergy he's supposed to be able to

1168
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,280
do that he should have known that it was

1169
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:22,280
a cat allergy he's obviously not who he

1170
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:25,200
says he is well here's the real story of

1171
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,160
what actually happened from Anthony's

1172
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,119
text thread we know that Ashley baby

1173
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,480
started having an eczema Outbreak on

1174
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,599
June 19th of

1175
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,640
2018 and then there's a text thread

1176
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,559
between Ashley and a friend from when

1177
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:41,440
her son was dealing with his eczema in

1178
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:44,359
real time on June 28th of 2018 the

1179
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:48,880
friend texted Ashley and said hey honey

1180
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:52,520
how are you how's the rash Ashley

1181
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,680
replied hey BB doing good here gearing

1182
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:58,440
up to head to Dallas tomorrow it's still

1183
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,960
pretty bad but but not getting worse I

1184
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:06,240
think it's actually starting to scab

1185
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,720
up the friend said a poor little Dallas

1186
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,440
will hopefully be

1187
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:12,920
nice Ashley sent a photo of her baby's

1188
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,880
eczema and said

1189
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,520
this I talked to Aunt and he said it's

1190
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,960
most likely the

1191
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:26,119
cat okay we have to pause here this is

1192
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:29,880
the Smoking Gun Ashley texted her friend

1193
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:32,960
saying Anthony told her it's most likely

1194
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:36,119
the cat whereas in the 2020 version of

1195
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,599
the story Ashley said she herself

1196
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,480
discovered that the cat was causing her

1197
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:44,400
baby skin problems and that Anthony had

1198
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:48,520
missed it here it is again the 2020

1199
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,760
version um and so we realized oh he has

1200
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,359
a cat

1201
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,640
allergy um and that was causing like the

1202
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:57,960
bulk of the problem and so I just find

1203
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,480
it curious that in talking Anthony like

1204
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,640
why wouldn't he have mentioned like yes

1205
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,200
you can make all these dietary changes

1206
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:07,640
but also the fact that you got a cat

1207
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,640
four weeks ago is probably the real

1208
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:14,559
problem versus what actually happened

1209
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,799
according to Ashley's own text messages

1210
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,760
from

1211
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:22,559
2018 I talked to Aunt and he said it's

1212
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:27,480
most likely the

1213
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:29,200
cat Ashley Foster is a liar

1214
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,280
there you have it right out of the

1215
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,799
horse's mouth Ashley's own words proving

1216
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,640
that she

1217
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:40,680
lied now we can

1218
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:43,680
continue I talked to Aunt and he said

1219
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:46,640
it's most likely the cat cat has been

1220
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,359
gone 4 days but I'm sure there's still a

1221
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,880
lot here so Dallas might actually help

1222
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:56,400
it heal up further well I mean liver

1223
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,400
issues but the cat as you know

1224
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:01,359
the friend said a the poor baby so did

1225
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,880
you give the cat away or just having a

1226
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:07,319
break from it and Ashley

1227
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,359
replied we gave it to our friends who

1228
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:12,920
wanted it really badly I really love

1229
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:16,440
having a pet around but they create so

1230
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,880
much mess and our home just feels so

1231
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,440
clean

1232
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,960
now Ashley Sayang in these text messages

1233
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,640
that Anthony told her that her son's

1234
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,880
eczema outbreak was due to liver issues

1235
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:34,680
plus the cat Ashley also says that they

1236
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:37,000
gave the cat away on June 24th of 2018

1237
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,319
this is 4 months before the Hawaii

1238
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Retreat remember that in the fake story

1239
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,559
she told in 2020 Ashley said it wasn't

1240
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,559
until the Hawaii Retreat that she

1241
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:50,640
realized that cats affected her son's

1242
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:53,240
skin condition but in reality Ashley had

1243
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,000
already given their pet cat away 4

1244
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:58,000
months before the Hawaii Retreat even

1245
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,440
took place

1246
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:05,680
again Ashley Foster is a

1247
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,920
liar then on July 14th of 2018 Ashley

1248
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,839
texted the same

1249
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:15,640
friend poor little is so bad it's

1250
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:19,119
breaking my heart anything I can do I'm

1251
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:22,880
drinking celery juice nettle tea off all

1252
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:26,400
green and oil and very low fat is

1253
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:30,960
getting little sips of celery juice too

1254
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,960
I'm taking zinc and vitamin C in high

1255
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:37,720
quantities the friend said poor baby is

1256
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:42,559
this worse than he was at the

1257
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:45,880
start h no it was worse at one

1258
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:48,040
point the friend asks it's been ebbing

1259
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:50,000
and flowing then or just gotten a little

1260
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,920
better and not gone up and

1261
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,640
down Ashley says that's sort of what

1262
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,920
it's done

1263
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,240
the friend replies well that's normal

1264
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,880
for a rash at least a bad one anyway it

1265
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,960
could still just be that his immune

1266
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,839
system is weakened still from the cat

1267
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,200
and the allergic reaction and it will

1268
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:12,160
get better soon if it's not worse right

1269
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:16,240
now that's a good sign are you drinking

1270
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:19,640
a lot of OJ and Ashley

1271
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:21,240
says no yeah it isn't continuing to get

1272
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,319
worse at

1273
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:27,319
least just slower to Cal down than I

1274
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:29,839
thought

1275
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:32,400
Anthony had told Ashley already that the

1276
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,440
cat was a trigger for her son and Ashley

1277
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,839
had gotten rid of the cat nearly a month

1278
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,280
prior to this

1279
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,400
conversation as you can see everyone

1280
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,880
Ashley spoke to was well aware that the

1281
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,160
cat was a trigger because as Ashley said

1282
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,440
in her own text messages that was

1283
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,039
something Anthony had told her from the

1284
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:56,920
beginning on August 15th of 2018 the

1285
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:59,599
same friend asked how and Ashley replied

1286
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,880
he's not great pal but I'm trying to be

1287
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,359
patient we're having our whole house

1288
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,200
cleaned top to bottom this weekend

1289
00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:10,839
including all furniture in our HVAC

1290
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:13,119
system it still hasn't been as bad as at

1291
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:13,119
its

1292
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:19,960
worst the friend says a poor little

1293
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,599
guy keep the date that Ashley got her

1294
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,720
house and HVAC system cleaned in mind

1295
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:27,400
for later August

1296
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:31,200
15th in Aver ation that took place a

1297
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:33,079
month later on September 19th of 2018

1298
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,440
Ashley says

1299
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:38,400
this still dealing with skin but I spoke

1300
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,039
with Aunt and he got us on the right

1301
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,160
track I think we'll be through it in the

1302
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:47,039
next few weeks I was having very little

1303
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:49,880
fat like maybe one tablespoon of cashews

1304
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:53,799
a day but it turns out it's not the fat

1305
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,680
itself it's the nuts he actually said

1306
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:59,319
like olive oil would be better than

1307
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:02,880
cashews in terms of helping heal so I

1308
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:06,200
got completely off and he not seeds he

1309
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,920
seems like he's starting to come through

1310
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:11,119
it so now we're getting into what was

1311
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:15,079
happening with the fats the friend

1312
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:17,520
responded I'm thrilled about yippe keep

1313
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:20,559
me posted on his continued healing been

1314
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,799
praying for him next we're going to read

1315
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,240
off a series of texts Ashley sent to a

1316
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:26,720
different friend also in mid-september

1317
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,920
of 2018

1318
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,480
telling the true story consistent with

1319
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,599
the last text thread we just read off of

1320
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,960
what Ashley had discussed with Anthony

1321
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:39,559
about her son

1322
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:43,920
skin nothing crazy but he set to give a

1323
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:45,920
little vitamin c 200 milligrams per day

1324
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,160
and that I shouldn't be eating any nuts

1325
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:52,880
or seeds he actually said olive oil is

1326
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:56,520
fine but no nuts or seeds because of the

1327
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,870
Arginine and then he said lots of squash

1328
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,839
and green juices for

1329
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:03,240
[Music]

1330
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:06,480
me if you remember in the fabricated cat

1331
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:08,240
story Ashley told in 2020 Ashley said

1332
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,720
the real turning point was when she

1333
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:13,559
realized her son had a cat allergy while

1334
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:16,119
they were in Hawaii with a cat in their

1335
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,480
Airbnb in the real story of what

1336
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:20,480
actually happened the true turning point

1337
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,680
was when Ashley listened to Anthony's

1338
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,480
guidance to cut out nuts and seeds when

1339
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:29,880
she realized it was not the fat that was

1340
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,200
the problem it was the nuts and seeds

1341
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,839
specifically when Ashley cut those out

1342
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:37,039
as she said in her own words her son

1343
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:40,039
started to turn the corner and get

1344
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:43,119
better and then from October 15th

1345
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:45,799
through October 21st of 2018 Ashley

1346
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,480
hosted a retreat in Hawaii this is the

1347
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:50,160
retreat that took place right before

1348
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,240
Stephanie passed away I've spoken to

1349
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,880
individuals who were at this Retreat one

1350
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,760
of them shared with me first of all that

1351
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,920
there was not a cat in any of Ashley's

1352
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,760
air bnbs only an outdoor cat around one

1353
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,200
of the airbnbs that was not allowed

1354
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,799
inside this person also shared with us

1355
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,200
that at the retreat Ashley started

1356
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:09,599
eating nuts again and that is the real

1357
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,640
reason why her son's skin flared up

1358
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:15,200
again I have a copy of the menu Ashley

1359
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,559
created for the retreat and it has nuts

1360
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,000
in at least one of the meals for almost

1361
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:22,240
every single day of the

1362
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,520
retreat here are some examples from the

1363
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,640
menu we've got a chopped salad with

1364
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:29,960
Branch dressing which included Vil and

1365
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:32,280
cashew nuts a taco bar with cashew cream

1366
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,799
which is basically all cashew there was

1367
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:38,400
a cashew curry sauce which is basically

1368
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:40,559
all cashew as well there was a pasta

1369
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,760
with cashew butter in the sauce There

1370
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,960
was a macadamia nut parmesan which is

1371
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,400
basically entirely made from macadamia

1372
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,480
nuts there were potato pancakes with a

1373
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,440
roasted garlic cream sauce which is

1374
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,480
basically all cashew again there was a

1375
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,039
pad tie with almond butter in it there

1376
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,599
were sweet potato fries with a Sal

1377
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:01,240
lantro lime Crea which is basically all

1378
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:03,559
cashew there was a horseradish sauce

1379
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,599
which included a lot of cashews there

1380
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:09,240
was also an option for almond butter

1381
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:12,559
sauce on Collard wraps this was a menu

1382
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,119
again that Ashley created herself and

1383
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,200
there are individuals who witnessed

1384
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:17,960
Ashley eating these dishes with nuts

1385
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,240
throughout the course of the

1386
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,599
retreat when Ashley returned from The

1387
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,000
Retreat she got off of nuts and seeds

1388
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:26,920
again and that is when her son's eczema

1389
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,240
cleared up for good

1390
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,039
again there are

1391
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,079
witnesses it is not possible that

1392
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,920
Ashley's son was still being affected by

1393
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:37,559
their household cat around the time of

1394
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:40,039
the October Retreat like Ashley said in

1395
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:42,200
her fabricated 2020 version of the cat

1396
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,720
story I'm going to walk through the

1397
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,400
facts of the timeline Ashley first

1398
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,240
texted Anthony's wife when she was

1399
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:52,319
thinking about getting the cat on June

1400
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:56,200
7th of 2018 the text says

1401
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:59,039
this okay we're thinking of taking in

1402
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:01,000
our friends can possible to keep it on a

1403
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,400
vegan

1404
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,520
diet I have to put out a disclaimer

1405
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,319
first that Anthony has shared publicly

1406
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,480
that he does not recommend having cats

1407
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:11,680
on a vegan diet and Anthony's wife

1408
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,200
expressed this to Ashley at the time

1409
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,520
we're just reading this off to show that

1410
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,880
Ashley got the cat around this time in

1411
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,839
June and then the thread we read

1412
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,319
previously included Ashley confirming

1413
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:25,520
that she gave the cat away on June 24th

1414
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:27,359
of 2018 so between the time Ashley was

1415
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,880
cons considering taking the cat in on

1416
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:33,079
the 7th and the date she gave it away on

1417
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:38,319
the 24th Ashley only had the cat for a

1418
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:41,480
maximum of 18 days in June June 24th the

1419
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:44,559
day she gave the cat away is 4 months

1420
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:48,160
before Ashley was in Hawaii for her

1421
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:52,839
Retreat this alone makes Ashley's 2020

1422
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:55,319
fake version of the cat story entirely

1423
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:59,240
impossible but the actual turning point

1424
01:01:55,319 --> 01:02:01,520
in his human came when we went to Hawaii

1425
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,599
and realized that he was severely

1426
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,200
allergic to cats cuz he was doing really

1427
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:10,160
well and then we changed airbnbs to an

1428
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:11,960
Airbnb where there was a cat and he

1429
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,599
started breaking out an eczema again

1430
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,520
like the following morning just like

1431
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,520
full body

1432
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,680
hives she claimed that she realized her

1433
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,400
son was allergic to cats because he was

1434
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,440
doing really well at first when they

1435
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,760
went to Hawaii in October of 2018

1436
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:31,480
and that it was because he got relief

1437
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:34,039
from the cat that they had at home but

1438
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,880
in reality the cat had already been gone

1439
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:38,799
for four

1440
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:41,720
months Ashley had sent this text on June

1441
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:46,000
28th of

1442
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:48,240
2018 CAD has been gone 4 days we gave it

1443
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,480
to our friends who wanted it really

1444
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:55,119
badly I really love having a pet around

1445
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:59,000
but they create so much mess and our

1446
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:59,000
home just feels feels so clean

1447
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:06,039
now I will say again that Ashley Foster

1448
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,480
is a liar the cat story she told

1449
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:10,920
publicly in 2020 was

1450
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,960
fabricated and she went on to tell more

1451
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,160
fabricated versions of it keep the facts

1452
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:19,119
and records of what really happened with

1453
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,599
Ashley's son his eczema and the cat in

1454
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:24,480
mind as I unpack several other

1455
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,839
fictitious cat story versions the facts

1456
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,319
are that Anthony did tell Ashley that

1457
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:31,799
the cat was a factor in her son's eczema

1458
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:34,520
he did not get it wrong or miss the cat

1459
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:38,319
allergy Ashley only had the cat for a

1460
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:40,920
maximum of 18 days and got rid of it 4

1461
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:43,160
months before the October Retreat

1462
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:46,160
Anthony only told Ashley to avoid nuts

1463
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:48,559
and seeds specifically her son's skin

1464
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,720
started improving when she implemented

1465
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,640
that and then his exzema flared up again

1466
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,760
in October because Ashley started eating

1467
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,880
nuts again at the retreat in Hawaii Ash

1468
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,240
as's son's eczema cleared up for good

1469
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:02,440
when Ashley got off of nuts and seeds

1470
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,000
again several months after she had

1471
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,960
already given the cat away and gotten

1472
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,160
her house deep

1473
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:10,640
cleaned when the plotters made their

1474
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:13,200
attempt to recruit me last year on a

1475
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:15,480
call that I legally recorded Ashley was

1476
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,760
trying really hard to convince me that

1477
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,760
Anthony is a liar and a fraud she told

1478
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:23,079
me a false version of the infamous cat

1479
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,160
story that was even more fabricated than

1480
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:27,920
the false version that we just played

1481
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:29,960
from her 2020 live stream I'm going to

1482
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,039
go through and actually count the number

1483
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,039
of falsities from the cat story she told

1484
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:35,920
me personally on the phone because there

1485
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:40,079
are so

1486
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:43,400
many um I then gave birth to my middle

1487
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:46,400
son and he got like full body eczema

1488
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,799
when he was born and I remember asking

1489
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,400
Anthony what to do what do I do about

1490
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:55,760
this I was a breastfeeding mom he put me

1491
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:58,160
on a fat-free raw diet um which I Stay

1492
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,160
gone for

1493
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:03,520
months we've got falsity number one in

1494
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,720
this version she says Anthony put her on

1495
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:09,039
a fat-free diet in previous version she

1496
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:12,559
had said Anthony told her avocado and

1497
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:15,359
olive oil were okay in reality he said

1498
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:18,760
nuts and seeds specifically were the

1499
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:21,319
problem not fats as a whole falsity

1500
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:24,079
number two Ashley added here that he

1501
01:05:21,319 --> 01:05:26,640
told her to eat raw food only this is

1502
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,480
the only one of nine versions of the cat

1503
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,839
story in which she mentioned this and it

1504
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,160
is not true in one of the text threads

1505
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:34,960
we just read from Ashley told a friend

1506
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,240
while the outbreak was happening in real

1507
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,359
time that Anthony had suggested for her

1508
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:42,880
to eat lots of squashes and said that

1509
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:45,319
olive oil was okay I'm positive Anthony

1510
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,000
that you did not mean for Ashley to only

1511
01:05:45,319 --> 01:05:50,559
consume all of those squashes raw and to

1512
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,920
only have olive oil

1513
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:56,640
raw I did not tell Ashley to eat raw or

1514
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,640
to eat fat-free for her son's xema

1515
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,079
Ashley's flying

1516
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:03,760
again right and we've also got falsity

1517
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,720
number three here with Ashley saying

1518
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,319
that she stayed raw and fat-free for

1519
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,039
months someone I've spoken to who knows

1520
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,559
Ashley witnessed her consuming both

1521
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:14,720
cooked food and fats during this time

1522
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:16,680
Ashley only cut out nuts and seeds for

1523
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,359
about one month and then at her Retreat

1524
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:21,119
she was eating nuts again as well as

1525
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:23,000
other fats and cooked food even during

1526
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,359
the one month that she cut out nuts and

1527
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,440
seeds Ashley was still eating other fats

1528
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:29,559
and cooked

1529
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,680
food there is a publicly available

1530
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:33,720
YouTube video that was submitted to us

1531
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,000
of a vegan get together that took place

1532
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:40,359
on August 14th of 2018 and the video

1533
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,520
stars Ashley this is just under two

1534
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:45,480
months after Ashley son broke out with

1535
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:48,839
eczema Ashley is shown in the video with

1536
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:51,359
a salad with avocado and cooked potato

1537
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:54,000
cakes with dollops of cashew aoli cream

1538
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:56,119
and avocado on top sitting next to her

1539
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,599
son and you can see his

1540
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:00,880
eczema a witness who was at the

1541
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:03,319
Gathering saw Ashley eating the salad

1542
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,880
with avocado and the cooked potato cakes

1543
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:08,760
with cashew aoli cream and avocado on

1544
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:11,079
top cashew aoli cream is very dense and

1545
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,839
takes a lot of cashews to make this is

1546
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:15,240
yet another piece of evidence to show

1547
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:18,559
that Ashley's claim of being on a raw

1548
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:21,359
fat-free diet is completely

1549
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:23,119
false during my call with Ashley she

1550
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:27,799
continued

1551
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:30,960
on um and he told me all this different

1552
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:33,880
stuff we had like a billion air

1553
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,520
purifiers this is falsity number four

1554
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:39,400
Ashley didn't have air purifiers until

1555
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:41,240
after her son's eczema had cleared up

1556
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,880
the air purifiers she got were four

1557
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,760
remediation from the Malibu fires they

1558
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,119
had nothing to do with the cat or her

1559
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,680
son's skin and it was during a different

1560
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:52,760
time period it's a whole other separate

1561
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,880
story which we're going to cover later

1562
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,520
that Ashley conflated with this false

1563
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,680
version of the cat story when she told

1564
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:02,680
it to

1565
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:04,920
me we I was not eating I mean I wasn't

1566
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:06,559
eating anything I was eating fruit and

1567
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:10,200
some

1568
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:12,480
greens falsity number five now Ashley's

1569
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:16,239
down to saying she wasn't even eating

1570
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:18,159
vegetables just fruit and greens that's

1571
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:21,000
how the number two plotter Ashley's

1572
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:23,239
friend Robbie Barbaro eats somehow it's

1573
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,239
not restrictive to her when he does

1574
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:28,000
it but there are witnesses who observed

1575
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:30,319
Ashley eating many foods other than

1576
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,040
fruit and greens during this time such

1577
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,880
as plenty of potatoes and beans in

1578
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,920
another version of this story Ashley

1579
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,560
said she was eating nuts and seeds up

1580
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:42,520
until a month before the retreat and as

1581
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:45,319
we covered she reintroduced nuts at The

1582
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:47,400
Retreat and at Ashley's Retreat there

1583
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:49,799
were plenty of vegetables on the menu

1584
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:53,679
that she created herself lots of

1585
01:08:49,799 --> 01:08:56,480
potatoes radishes yams asparagus carrot

1586
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,839
red cabbage and more along with other

1587
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:02,520
foods like coconut ice cream kelp

1588
01:08:58,839 --> 01:09:05,040
noodles raw honey maple syrup Wasabi

1589
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,520
aerrow root and much more than just

1590
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,839
fruit and

1591
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,359
greens furthermore in a different

1592
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:12,679
version of the cat story I'm going to

1593
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:14,960
share from Ashley later Ashley says in

1594
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:16,759
her own words that she was eating

1595
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,120
vegetables during this

1596
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:22,040
time obviously Ashley's purposely trying

1597
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:24,679
to make it look like Anthony put her on

1598
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,199
some kind of extremely restrictive diet

1599
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:27,960
which he did not

1600
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:29,960
by telling these falsities because she

1601
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:33,400
has to convince people somehow that

1602
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:36,400
Anthony's a bad guy or

1603
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:38,520
something and he kept saying like just

1604
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,880
keep going he's cleansing his liver is

1605
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:43,239
cleansing my hair was falling out my

1606
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,239
nails are

1607
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:49,120
breaking oh the drama there's so much

1608
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,759
that's wrong with this part of her fake

1609
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:54,360
story from the false he's just cleansing

1610
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,159
narrative to her false Health claims

1611
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,560
that we're going to be packing further

1612
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:01,120
in another episode for now I'm just

1613
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:04,000
going to stick to the main falsities

1614
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,199
falsity number six here Ashley's

1615
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,440
omitting the fact that her son's skin

1616
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:10,960
did clear up after she made the dietary

1617
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:12,760
changes Anthony suggested she's doing

1618
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,760
this to make it sound like what Anthony

1619
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:19,040
suggested wasn't working while it was so

1620
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:21,040
restrictive that it was harming her in

1621
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,199
reality Ashley took some time to

1622
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,040
implement what Anthony had suggested

1623
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:29,080
which was to Simply remove nuts and

1624
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:31,080
seeds and as you guys heard in her own

1625
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:33,400
text messages from the true version of

1626
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:36,280
the cat story Ashley said that once she

1627
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:39,760
did that her son's skin started clearing

1628
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:41,920
up and falsity number seven Ashley was

1629
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,560
dealing with pre-existing symptoms and

1630
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,400
conditions before she ever started

1631
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,440
applying medical medium information

1632
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:50,679
including hair loss and there is plenty

1633
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:53,800
of evidence of that that Ashley maybe

1634
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:55,560
doesn't remember I mean it's got to be a

1635
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,280
full-time job at this point for her to

1636
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:00,000
keep her lies straight when she's being

1637
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:02,640
so obscenely dishonest all over the

1638
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,840
place these pre-existing symptoms like

1639
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,640
hair loss however presented long before

1640
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:10,080
Ashley was recommended by Anthony to

1641
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:14,480
remove nuts and seeds for the one month

1642
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:16,360
or so that she actually did in total so

1643
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,080
restrictive I

1644
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,920
know in fact in one of the ebooks that

1645
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,760
Ashley had sold to the medical medium

1646
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,760
Community years ago Ashley wrote this

1647
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,640
about what was going on with her health

1648
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,960
during the time that she gave birth to

1649
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:33,120
her other child that she had before her

1650
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,120
son who had the eczema

1651
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:40,400
outbreak after was born my health

1652
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:45,159
crashed even more severely my depression

1653
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:48,280
became so intense magnified 100 times

1654
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:52,560
getting out of bed felt impossible and

1655
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:56,199
at times it was my hair fell out my skin

1656
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:59,880
grew dull and pale I felt horrible in my

1657
01:11:56,199 --> 01:12:03,920
own body and for a brief period I even

1658
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:07,320
battle thoughts of suicide I weighed 185

1659
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:11,000
lbs and my entire body seemed to Sag in

1660
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:13,760
the aftermath of creating new life at 6

1661
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,880
months postpartum I found help from

1662
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,360
Anthony William who wrote the book

1663
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,360
medical

1664
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:24,520
Medium as you can see from Ashley's own

1665
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,000
testimony of her healing Journey from

1666
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,440
before she got mad at Anthony and

1667
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,159
started telling these fake stories and

1668
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:32,320
trying to rewrite history Ashley's hair

1669
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:35,679
loss was happening after she had her

1670
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:37,960
first baby which was six months before

1671
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,800
she ever interacted with Anthony or his

1672
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:42,960
information in the first

1673
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:45,480
place Ashley's using this falsity as a

1674
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,400
tactic to mess with other women's heads

1675
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,679
it's a great way to scare women who are

1676
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:52,520
applying medical medium information

1677
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,800
women do not want to lose their hair or

1678
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,679
the health of their

1679
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,440
nails yeah

1680
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,239
and that's real

1681
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:02,880
fear-mongering somebody who has to twist

1682
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:04,880
stories like this in order to try to

1683
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,040
scare and mess with the heads of women

1684
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,719
who are already struggling to serve

1685
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:12,080
their own agenda is clearly someone who

1686
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,520
is operating from a place of malice and

1687
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,280
not from a place of

1688
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,639
Sanity during our call Ashley continued

1689
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:22,360
to tell me this fake cat

1690
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:25,320
story um we went to Hawaii actually with

1691
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,840
Taylor to do a retreat with Taylor

1692
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,800
while we were there we were staying at

1693
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,600
an Airbnb with a cat and halfway through

1694
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,080
the retreat we moved to an Airbnb

1695
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:36,840
without a cat we also had a cat um when

1696
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:38,840
we moved to the Airbnb without a cat my

1697
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:41,880
son's exema went away within like the

1698
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:44,560
three days that we were there falsity

1699
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,880
number eight what's funny is that this

1700
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:49,679
is the opposite from other versions of

1701
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,840
the false story that Ashley's told in

1702
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:54,600
another false version Ashley said that

1703
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:57,239
the cat was in the second Airbnb and now

1704
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:00,360
she's say that the cat was in the first

1705
01:13:57,239 --> 01:14:02,400
Airbnb as we stated previously a witness

1706
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:04,560
who was at the retreat said that there

1707
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,920
was actually not a cat in either of

1708
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,960
Ashley's

1709
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,719
airbnbs falsity number nine in this

1710
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,000
version Ashley's claiming that her son's

1711
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:16,239
eczema went away within 3 days while

1712
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,440
they were in Hawaii in the real story

1713
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:21,280
from Ashley's own text messages remember

1714
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:24,480
that her son's eczema actually started

1715
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:27,360
clearing up 1 month before the Hawaii

1716
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:28,880
retreat in October Ashley's son's eczema

1717
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,040
flared up again while they were in

1718
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,320
Hawaii because Ashley started eating

1719
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,239
nuts

1720
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:38,360
again so we got home we gave the cat to

1721
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:40,320
a friend we had our um air conditioning

1722
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:42,199
unit claimed his eczema went away and it

1723
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:45,840
never came

1724
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:47,639
back falsity number 10 if you remember

1725
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,639
back to one of the text threads we read

1726
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:52,800
from Ashley's real version of the cat

1727
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:56,400
story sent to a friend on August 15th of

1728
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,480
2018 Ashley said this

1729
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,719
we're having our whole house cleaned top

1730
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:04,639
to bottom this weekend including all

1731
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,639
furniture and our HVAC

1732
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:10,280
system in fact Ashley had her air

1733
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:14,280
conditioning unit cleaned the weekend of

1734
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:17,560
August 17th which was 2 months before

1735
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:20,360
the Hawaii Retreat not after the Hawaii

1736
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:23,320
Retreat and that concludes this version

1737
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:25,920
of the cat story leaving us with 10

1738
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:28,120
total falsities in just one one of the

1739
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:31,639
multiple fictitious versions that Ashley

1740
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:34,000
has told of this cat story Ashley has

1741
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:36,800
adapted the infamous cat story more and

1742
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,040
more with time right after we released

1743
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,840
the first podcast about the plotters a

1744
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,679
lot of people were shocked to figure out

1745
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,719
that Ashley was behind this attack on

1746
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:46,760
Anthony and the community because they

1747
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,960
remembered how much Ashley has said in

1748
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:51,960
previous years about how Anthony has

1749
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,719
helped her and her family one woman

1750
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,320
recounted what she had seen in a

1751
01:15:53,719 --> 01:15:57,000
Facebook group that she was in with

1752
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:59,840
Ashley during the time of her son's

1753
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:04,280
eczema problem in a comment thread from

1754
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:06,480
April 20th of 2023 the woman said aw

1755
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:08,760
helped Ash's baby recover from pretty

1756
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:11,320
severe eczema I don't know if Ash had

1757
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:13,360
issues herself or just her baby I

1758
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:16,280
remember seeing before and after

1759
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,760
piic Ashley replied with another version

1760
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:22,080
of her fake cat

1761
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:25,440
story respectfully can't let these

1762
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:28,880
inaccuracies go un addressed and Anthony

1763
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:31,239
did not cure my son's eczema he told me

1764
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:33,880
to go on a fat-free diet as a

1765
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:37,239
breastfeeding postpartum mom he

1766
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:40,360
recommended it for months and months and

1767
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:42,719
months he specifically told me that I

1768
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:46,000
just needed to keep going to detox to

1769
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:48,520
help my son we went on a trip and

1770
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,679
realized that my son was allergic to

1771
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:55,199
cats we came back and gave our cat to a

1772
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:58,480
dear friend my son's eczema went away

1773
01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:00,639
within the week and has never come back

1774
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:03,280
I however have suffered incredible

1775
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:07,000
depletion from being on such restrictive

1776
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:09,440
diet for so long I went on to have two

1777
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,520
miscarriages while continuing to follow

1778
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:15,239
Anthony's

1779
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:18,440
advice wow this false version is even

1780
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:20,360
more extreme than the last Ashley has a

1781
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:22,920
pattern of escalating the severity of

1782
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:24,440
her fake stories over time presumably

1783
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,440
after not getting enough of a rise out

1784
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,960
of people

1785
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,080
initially here Ashley's telling the same

1786
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:32,480
falsities about Anthony missing the cat

1787
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:35,679
allergy and that Anthony had told her to

1788
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:38,400
go on a fat-free diet this time she says

1789
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,960
for months and months and

1790
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:43,360
months Ashley also told the same

1791
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:46,320
falsities about how Anthony told her to

1792
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:48,400
just keep going to detox her son that

1793
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,520
she herself discovered the cat allergy

1794
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,639
at The Retreat that they gave the cat

1795
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,520
away after the retreat and that her

1796
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:56,880
son's eczema cleared after the retreat

1797
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,600
none of which is

1798
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,880
accurate now she's added in outrageous

1799
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,800
Health claims to imply that not only

1800
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,920
Anthony got the cause of her son's skin

1801
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:07,920
problem wrong but also that his

1802
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,719
recommendations were restrictive and

1803
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:14,280
caused her harm she says that she quote

1804
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:17,560
suffered incredible depletion from being

1805
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:19,840
on such a restrictive diet for so long

1806
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:22,000
all of this is

1807
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,719
inaccurate again we're going to be

1808
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,600
thoroughly addressing Ashley's

1809
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:28,320
outrageous Health claims in other

1810
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:30,760
episodes for now I'm going to share the

1811
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,159
text message that Ashley sent to Anthony

1812
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,600
when she reached out to him for help

1813
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:37,199
with her baby's

1814
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:40,360
eczema sweet is pretty miserable still

1815
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:43,960
an I'm doing the basic things I can do

1816
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:48,120
while breastfeeding celery juice low fat

1817
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:51,280
green free zinc vitamin C he's getting a

1818
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:55,280
little celery juice too any other

1819
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:57,719
thoughts for me poor little bugs seem so

1820
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:00,000
miserable I'm willing to do something

1821
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:03,360
extreme like a melon juice and green

1822
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,760
juice fast or something but I don't want

1823
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:09,159
to detox and make him

1824
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:11,480
worse Ashley has made it clear over and

1825
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:14,320
over again that she's never understood

1826
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:16,920
medical medium information Anthony very

1827
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:20,040
much advises against things like melon

1828
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:22,280
juice and green juice fasts Ashley said

1829
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:25,159
herself here that she was willing to do

1830
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:29,040
something extreme to help her baby that

1831
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:31,440
was Ashley's input Ashley herself has a

1832
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:33,440
history of extreme dieting that existed

1833
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,760
long before she ever discovered medical

1834
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:39,080
medium information in a post Ashley made

1835
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:41,040
years ago to promote one of her ebooks

1836
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:43,520
Ashley shared a photo of herself in a

1837
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:45,000
wedding dress appearing very thin and

1838
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,960
she said

1839
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,840
this I was thin before my first

1840
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:54,120
pregnancy but it wasn't a healthy calm

1841
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:57,159
thin I used juice and water fasting to

1842
01:19:54,120 --> 01:20:00,280
control my weight and it swung wildly

1843
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:02,920
all over the place even at times when I

1844
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:05,520
was thin I experienced a lot of mental

1845
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:08,960
chaos around

1846
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:11,840
food Ashley's first pregnancy as I went

1847
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:14,600
through previously was before she ever

1848
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:17,280
connected with Anthony or medical medium

1849
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:20,280
information for her son's eczema Anthony

1850
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,440
said no to Ashley's suggestion of melon

1851
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,880
juice and green juice fasting and

1852
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:27,679
literally recommended for her to Simply

1853
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:31,040
remove nuts and seeds from her diet to

1854
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:33,120
help him millions of people with nut and

1855
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,840
Seed allergies live without them every

1856
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,239
day it's far from restrictive and nobody

1857
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,280
made her do it she was pleading for help

1858
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:43,280
from Anthony and again according to

1859
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:45,280
Ashley's own text messages from the true

1860
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,080
version of this story what Anthony

1861
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,920
suggested started clearing up her son's

1862
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:52,600
skin right away in the same comment

1863
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:56,159
thread from last year Ashley

1864
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:59,280
added for clarity sake AK you need to

1865
01:20:56,159 --> 01:21:01,719
know that during that entire time we had

1866
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:04,080
the cat in our house while Anthony was

1867
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:06,960
calling me and doing check-ins with

1868
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:09,280
spirit and telling me that the eczema

1869
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:13,120
was just cleansing and I needed to keep

1870
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:15,480
on my restrictive diet weird that Spirit

1871
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:18,159
never mentioned the cat to him 6 months

1872
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:18,159
earlier

1873
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:26,280
right I mean is this a joke this is how

1874
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:28,840
dangerous Ashley is every single line of

1875
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:31,000
that comment is wrong this is a perfect

1876
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:33,719
example of blatant falsi Ashley is

1877
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,760
pedaling to damage Anthony to plant fear

1878
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:37,480
and doubt to deliberately try to

1879
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,360
convince people that Anthony doesn't

1880
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,719
have accurate information and that he's

1881
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:44,440
harming people and she's trying to break

1882
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:46,920
people's Faith she's a faith

1883
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:49,080
Buster here she's saying the cat was in

1884
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,840
her house the entire time Anthony was

1885
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:55,560
talking to her but Ashley got rid of the

1886
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:57,840
cat on June 24th of 2018

1887
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,760
this was 4 months before she's now

1888
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,800
claiming that she gave the cat

1889
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,600
away she said weird that Spirit never

1890
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:08,679
mentioned the cat to him six months

1891
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:10,760
earlier right this is false ridiculously

1892
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:14,040
false Anthony mentioned the cat as a

1893
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:16,159
trigger from day one but this is exactly

1894
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:18,600
how Ashley deceives and manipulates

1895
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:21,239
people she's trying to rewrite history

1896
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:24,320
here to create an entirely false

1897
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:27,400
narrative I don't care if people believe

1898
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:30,120
in my gift or not that's okay that comes

1899
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:32,199
with a territory since I was 4 years old

1900
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:35,239
but people should be able to make that

1901
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:38,679
choice for themselves without a falsity

1902
01:22:35,239 --> 01:22:41,920
persuading them I did know about the cat

1903
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:44,639
and I told Ashley plain and

1904
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,239
simple as the comment thread goes on the

1905
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:48,239
woman who remembered that Anthony had

1906
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:50,639
helped Ashley's baby with eczema

1907
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:53,560
continued to question Ashley's false

1908
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:56,080
story she said did you have two babies

1909
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,000
with skin issues I pulled up my notes I

1910
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,440
have

1911
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,760
414 pages of notes from our group found

1912
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:05,880
a convo between you and Mana about you

1913
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:08,639
getting a kitten and had a whole body

1914
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:11,840
rash a week after you got the kitten

1915
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:14,280
Mana suggested zinc and C for you not

1916
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,600
him you asked about the cat and she said

1917
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:18,840
yes totally about the

1918
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,080
cat the group that this woman is

1919
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,960
referring to was a Facebook group she's

1920
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:25,440
saying that another woman had suggested

1921
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:28,760
for Ashley to do vitamin C and zinc for

1922
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,600
her son's eczema Ashley implemented that

1923
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:32,600
and then Ashley texted a friend about

1924
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:36,480
her taking these supplements on July

1925
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:37,880
14th of 2018 months before the Hawaii

1926
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,600
retreat in

1927
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:42,760
October Anthony and people in the

1928
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:44,920
medical medium Community all knew that

1929
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:46,840
the pet cat was part of the problem way

1930
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,760
before Ashley and her son stayed in the

1931
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:52,560
Airbnb that Ashley's trying to claim had

1932
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:56,280
a cat in it a woman who wasn't even

1933
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,199
involved had 400 and 14 pages of notes

1934
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,239
from the time that this was happening

1935
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:02,440
and she knew that Ashley's fake cat

1936
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:04,400
story on this thread wasn't adding up

1937
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:05,239
and was contradictory to the notes she

1938
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:08,159
had

1939
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:10,239
taken in the same comment thread Ashley

1940
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:13,360
tried to convince yet another person of

1941
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:14,520
her false cat story to this person she

1942
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:18,400
said

1943
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:21,400
this here's my experience my son had

1944
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:24,440
whole body eczema from a few weeks after

1945
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:26,520
getting a kitten until a week after

1946
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:29,600
giving it

1947
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:32,120
away I'm going to pause to note that

1948
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,960
Ashley's saying here that her son got

1949
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:38,320
the rash a few weeks after they got the

1950
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:41,080
kitten in another comment on the very

1951
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:43,679
same thread Ashley said to a different

1952
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:46,400
person that he had gotten the rash one

1953
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:48,080
week after they got the kitten the

1954
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:51,639
comment one

1955
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:55,920
version my son had whole body eczema

1956
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:58,960
from a few weeks after getting a kitten

1957
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,960
versus the comment to

1958
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:04,360
version we had a cat for a week when he

1959
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,360
got the

1960
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:10,239
rash which is it Ashley a few weeks or

1961
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:13,480
one week after getting the cat it can't

1962
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:15,000
be both this is getting embarrassing for

1963
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:17,560
the woman who said that she would never

1964
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,719
tell a lie and calls herself a truth

1965
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:22,320
teller Ashley continued on with her fake

1966
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:25,000
cat

1967
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:27,920
story The Way We realiz realized what

1968
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,920
was causing it is that we stayed in an

1969
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:35,440
Airbnb without a cat and he began to

1970
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:38,600
improve then we moved to an Airbnb with

1971
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:41,239
a cat and he declined the difference was

1972
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:44,760
rapid enough that we noticed got rid of

1973
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:47,159
the cat his severe whole body eczema

1974
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:51,360
that he had for six months of his life

1975
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:54,639
went away and never came back so that's

1976
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:57,800
my experience I feel like a broken Rec

1977
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,800
but that's all I have to

1978
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
share here we have a lot of the same

1979
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:05,840
falsities from other fictitious versions

1980
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,320
and in this version Ashley also again

1981
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:11,560
flipped the order of the Airbnb with a

1982
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:13,440
cat and the Airbnb without a cat

1983
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:16,480
Ashley's saying here that they had the

1984
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:18,480
cat for six months before giving it away

1985
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:21,480
which is really funny because the woman

1986
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,360
with 414 pages of notes from the

1987
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,679
Facebook group Ashley originally asked

1988
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:29,239
for help in called her out on that lie

1989
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:32,320
by commenting PS no mention in my notes

1990
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:35,000
that you had a cat for months just a

1991
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:37,440
week this woman is correct that Ashley

1992
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,400
did not have the cat for months as a

1993
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:41,960
reminder for everyone of the receipts

1994
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:44,639
and the timeline Ashley texted this to a

1995
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:48,679
friend on June

1996
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:51,480
28th cat has been gone 4

1997
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:54,719
days which means that Ashley only had

1998
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:56,639
the cat for a maximum of 18 days after

1999
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:59,639
she texted about considering taking the

2000
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:02,040
cat in on June 7th we don't have a

2001
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:04,679
record of the exact date Ashley took the

2002
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:06,440
cat in after the 7th it very well could

2003
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:08,880
have only been a week before she gave it

2004
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:11,159
away on the 24th but she did not have it

2005
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:14,920
for longer than 18 days and she most

2006
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:17,960
certainly did not have it for 6 months

2007
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:20,360
Ashley Foster's lies are

2008
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:22,480
pathological it's also worth mentioning

2009
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:24,480
that Ashley interestingly deleted that

2010
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:26,880
whole entire post along with all of

2011
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:30,199
these comments a few short days after

2012
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,239
she posted them that's the end of this

2013
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:34,320
version of the cat story I hope your

2014
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:36,520
head isn't spinning too much yet because

2015
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:39,440
believe it or not there are still two

2016
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:41,600
more the next false version is Ashley's

2017
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,510
first ever public post about the

2018
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,800
infamous cat story from

2019
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:47,760
[Music]

2020
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:51,440
2019 when started struggling with his

2021
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:54,199
rash we had no idea what was causing it

2022
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:56,400
but about a week later I started feeling

2023
01:27:54,199 --> 01:27:59,560
it was the kitten we adopted for our

2024
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:02,080
daughter thankfully some friends of ours

2025
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:05,679
fell in love with sweet Wendell Kitty

2026
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:09,040
and adopted him he's so loved in their

2027
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:11,880
home but even after the cat left the

2028
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:15,239
reactions continued they got a little

2029
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:18,480
better maybe but it was so hard to tell

2030
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:18,480
because it kind of came in

2031
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:24,560
waves okay right here she's admitting

2032
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:26,520
that they got rid of the cat early on

2033
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,159
not months later and that it still

2034
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:30,719
didn't fix the problem which is true

2035
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:32,760
she's leaving out the fact that Anthony

2036
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:34,040
told her the cat was part of the problem

2037
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,400
and that that's when she made the

2038
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:38,719
decision to give the cat away she's

2039
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,639
acting like it was her own Discovery in

2040
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:42,960
other versions that she claimed the cat

2041
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:44,760
allergy was her own Discovery in she

2042
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,600
claimed she didn't make the discovery

2043
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:48,920
until going to Hawaii later on here

2044
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,719
she's claiming that she made the

2045
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:54,719
discovery essentially right away Ashley

2046
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:54,719
continues

2047
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:01,360
on the advice of medical medium I

2048
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:04,920
completely overh my diet and took out

2049
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:08,000
nuts seeds oils anything that could

2050
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:11,360
potentially be an irritant my diet

2051
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,560
consisted and still does of fruits and

2052
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,520
vegetables if you want to know more

2053
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:18,280
about what I eat you can check out my

2054
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:22,719
story highlights the diet change US

2055
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:25,880
helped so much and were a critical

2056
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:28,080
component Ash is admitting here at least

2057
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,199
that the dietary changes did help and

2058
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:32,199
were a critical component she's

2059
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:34,119
misrepresenting the dietary changes as

2060
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:37,280
if Anthony had advised her to cut out

2061
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:39,639
oils and only eat fruits and vegetables

2062
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:42,480
when in fact he said that olive oil was

2063
01:29:39,639 --> 01:29:45,639
fine and simply told her to cut out nuts

2064
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:47,440
and seeds in this story version Ashley

2065
01:29:45,639 --> 01:29:50,239
wasn't clear about the timeline of the

2066
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:52,480
dietary changes Ashley only implemented

2067
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:56,040
getting off nuts and seeds after

2068
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:58,280
September 18th in 2018 and that's when

2069
01:29:56,040 --> 01:30:00,560
she started seeing results in her son it

2070
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:02,800
was only less than a month before she

2071
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:06,199
went to Hawaii and started eating nuts

2072
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:10,400
again then Ashley said

2073
01:30:06,199 --> 01:30:13,040
this but our guy kept on reacting we had

2074
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:16,320
our whole house cleaned top to bottom

2075
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:18,800
including our air ducts that helped some

2076
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:21,239
but it still

2077
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:23,560
persisted now she's saying that her son

2078
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:24,560
kept reacting even after the dietary

2079
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,280
changes

2080
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,000
which is not what she said in other

2081
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:30,960
versions and doesn't even make sense in

2082
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,119
the context of the rest of this version

2083
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:35,600
Ashley's also admitting here that her

2084
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:37,880
air ducts were cleaned early on before

2085
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:40,040
the retreat and that that still didn't

2086
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:41,600
fix the problem which is true and

2087
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:43,320
contradicts what she said in other

2088
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,560
versions about getting the house

2089
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:48,159
including the air duct cleaned after the

2090
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:51,320
retreat she goes

2091
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:53,159
on it wasn't until we went to Hawaii

2092
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:56,320
that we found the final piece of the

2093
01:30:53,159 --> 01:30:59,639
puzzle we stayed in an airbeam be that

2094
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:03,679
had a cat in it before we arrived and

2095
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:05,560
within hours broke out in hives all over

2096
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:08,520
his

2097
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:10,760
body here's where it gets absurd because

2098
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:13,920
this part makes no sense after what you

2099
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:16,000
just heard her say Ashley's deliberately

2100
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,239
leaving out so many things from this

2101
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,040
story she's leaving out the fact that

2102
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:22,600
Anthony told her that the cat was a

2103
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:24,159
trigger for her son's eczema and that

2104
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,960
that's when she decided to get rid of

2105
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:28,719
the pet cat in the first place she's

2106
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:31,119
leaving out the fact that she was off of

2107
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:32,719
nuts and seeds for less than a month and

2108
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:33,480
then she started eating nuts again at

2109
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:35,639
The

2110
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:37,800
Retreat she's leaving out the fact that

2111
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:40,920
the menu she created for her Hawaii

2112
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,560
retreat was full of nuts she's leaving

2113
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,560
out the fact that the real reason why

2114
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:47,600
her son broke out in eczema again in

2115
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:49,800
Hawaii was because of the nuts she

2116
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:52,320
reintroduced now Ashley's saying that

2117
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:54,960
there was a cat in the Airbnb before

2118
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,639
they arrived whereas other versions she

2119
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:00,119
always said there was a cat in the

2120
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:02,000
Airbnb while they were there Ashley also

2121
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:03,760
contradicted herself with this one by

2122
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,080
saying that the retreat cat was the

2123
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:08,280
missing piece acting like it was such a

2124
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:11,040
surprise when she said in the beginning

2125
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:13,320
of this same story version that she

2126
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,920
already knew their pet cat was a trigger

2127
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:17,080
and that's why they had given it away

2128
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:19,880
four months prior to the

2129
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:22,159
retreat and now we have the ninth and

2130
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:24,560
final version of Ashley's cat story

2131
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:28,440
which she is still weaving and twisting

2132
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:31,440
to this day Ashley posted this one right

2133
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:33,320
at the end of last year 2023 As She was

2134
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:37,239
rattling off a ridiculous list of

2135
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:40,560
reasons why Anthony is supposedly a

2136
01:32:37,239 --> 01:32:44,320
liar um I have another one with my son's

2137
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,119
eczema where he kept telling me it was

2138
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,679
because I was eating too much fat I was

2139
01:32:46,119 --> 01:32:54,360
a postpartum nursing mom eating like

2140
01:32:48,679 --> 01:32:56,480
less than half an avocado a day um and

2141
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:58,400
you know he had me testing our house for

2142
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:00,560
mold and doing all this stuff and my son

2143
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,520
was allergic to our cat and we figured

2144
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,280
that out ourselves

2145
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:09,320
and so that was another one where I was

2146
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,320
like wait why why was he so

2147
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:15,440
wrong why was he so wrong my son was

2148
01:33:13,159 --> 01:33:17,239
allergic to our cat and we figured that

2149
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:20,760
out

2150
01:33:17,239 --> 01:33:25,000
ourselves versus what actually happened

2151
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:27,320
according to her own text messages

2152
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,960
I talked to Aunt and he said it's most

2153
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,960
likely the

2154
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:35,760
cat and she also said that he kept

2155
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,320
telling me it was because I was eating

2156
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:41,880
too much

2157
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:44,920
fat versus what actually

2158
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:46,880
happened still dealing with skin but I

2159
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:49,520
spoke with Aunt and he got us on the

2160
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:52,560
right track I think we'll be through it

2161
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:55,360
in the next few weeks I was having very

2162
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:58,239
little fat like maybe one tablespoon of

2163
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:01,760
cashews a day but it turns out it's not

2164
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:04,520
the fat itself it's the nuts he actually

2165
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:07,280
said like olive oil would be better than

2166
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:10,480
cashews in terms of helping

2167
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:11,159
heal it turns out it's not the fat it's

2168
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:14,840
the

2169
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:17,760
nuts as you can see Ashley Foster is a

2170
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:20,199
liar who lies about lying while accusing

2171
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,239
Anthony of being a liar as she's lying

2172
01:34:20,199 --> 01:34:25,239
and has told nine different

2173
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:27,880
contradictory versions of the the same

2174
01:34:25,239 --> 01:34:30,080
story yet another contradiction is that

2175
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:32,119
in one of these virgins Ashley claimed

2176
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:34,360
that her only fat Source each day was

2177
01:34:32,119 --> 01:34:36,080
avocado and in the other version she

2178
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:38,840
claimed that her only fat Source each

2179
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:41,880
day was cashews these two things cannot

2180
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:44,239
be true at the same time and in this

2181
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:46,000
most recent version Ashley also added in

2182
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:49,480
for the first time the claim that

2183
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,920
Anthony had her quote testing for mold

2184
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:55,040
and all this stuff which is just

2185
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:57,440
blatantly not true that is completely

2186
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:00,520
false and it's very telling that she's

2187
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:02,679
only adding that on now years and years

2188
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:05,000
after she started telling this story

2189
01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:07,239
Ashley likes to try to play to people's

2190
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:10,560
emotions because many people are

2191
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:12,639
concerned about mold I never told Ashley

2192
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:14,719
to test for mold in her multi-million

2193
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:18,360
dollar Malibu

2194
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:20,360
mansion furthermore in only one of the

2195
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:22,159
previous false versions of the cat story

2196
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:24,840
we went through Ashley mentioned air

2197
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:28,520
purifiers

2198
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:32,080
um and he told me all this different

2199
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:34,360
stuff we had like a billion air

2200
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:36,679
purifiers Ashley was trying to make it

2201
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:38,880
look like she did everything right she

2202
01:35:36,679 --> 01:35:40,800
followed all of Anthony's advice she

2203
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:44,159
spent a bunch of money on air purifiers

2204
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:47,560
for the cat dander and still Anthony was

2205
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:50,679
wrong but here is what actually happened

2206
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:52,600
with the air purifiers in late 2018

2207
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:54,960
there were massive fires devastating the

2208
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,880
area of Malibu California where Ashley

2209
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:00,480
was living at the time on November 9th

2210
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:02,440
Anthony texted her to check in anony is

2211
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:06,400
going to read the text he had sent to

2212
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:08,280
her please be safe hang in their Ash

2213
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:11,400
worried about you and your precious

2214
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:14,159
babies hope you are okay praying for

2215
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:16,760
your house to be safe too and putting

2216
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:19,400
light all around

2217
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:21,480
it so Anthony you told her that you were

2218
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:24,239
putting light around her house can you

2219
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:26,800
explain for everyone what that means

2220
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:29,679
I asked Spirit to Encompass the entire

2221
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:31,280
house with a force of light and I was

2222
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:33,239
envisioning this force of light

2223
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,840
inhibiting

2224
01:36:33,239 --> 01:36:38,840
Flames okay so you did that and then

2225
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:40,360
Ashley texted you on November 21st to

2226
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:43,400
say

2227
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:46,840
this okay friend what are we talking

2228
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:49,880
about here the devastation is immense

2229
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:51,840
the house next to us burnt to the ground

2230
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:54,480
obviously we want to do the highest

2231
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:56,119
level of smoke remediation we can can

2232
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,880
but with all of the ash in the

2233
01:36:56,119 --> 01:37:02,040
environment and the months it will take

2234
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:05,320
to remove the debris do we need to plan

2235
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:08,440
to be somewhere else for a few

2236
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:11,520
months next Ashley sends a video of her

2237
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:13,679
husband showing their house in perfect

2238
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,480
condition and then her husband pivots

2239
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:18,119
the camera so that it's looking through

2240
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:19,840
the burnt part of their Hedges out at

2241
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:22,639
the empty plot where the neighbor's

2242
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:26,520
house used to be in awe the video gets

2243
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:26,520
cut off a bit but he says

2244
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:47,639
unbelievable next Ashley sends this

2245
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:51,119
text that's our house versus the house

2246
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:55,080
next door supernaturally protected and

2247
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:55,080
surrounded by angels

2248
01:37:55,199 --> 01:38:00,840
so Anthony and spirit protected Ashley's

2249
01:37:58,119 --> 01:38:02,480
multi-million doll home with light and

2250
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:05,000
the video shows that her house was

2251
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:06,679
completely Untouched by the fires while

2252
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,920
her neighbor's house was completely

2253
01:38:06,679 --> 01:38:12,040
disintegrated down to the ground it's

2254
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:14,360
literally right next to Ashley's home

2255
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:16,880
there's hardly any space in between it's

2256
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:19,400
just a very tall wall of Hedges and only

2257
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,960
a small part of the Hedge is burnt down

2258
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,639
that whole thing should have lit up in

2259
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:24,040
flames and taken Ashley's house along

2260
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:25,560
with it it makes no sense

2261
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:27,679
there's nothing left of the neighbor's

2262
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:30,239
house and it's truly a miracle that

2263
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:33,159
Ashley's home was left entirely

2264
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:37,520
intact then Anthony texted her

2265
01:38:33,159 --> 01:38:39,880
back amazing your house was so protected

2266
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:42,440
if you stay there you just have to stay

2267
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:45,040
inside a lot because when the wind blows

2268
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:47,480
there's a lot of Ash in the air that

2269
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:49,679
will go into your lungs but if you're

2270
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:52,400
inside a lot and the inside isn't

2271
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:54,719
saturated with smoke smell then you can

2272
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:57,800
stay there and work with with it once

2273
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:59,560
the rain comes the outside will be so

2274
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:03,719
much

2275
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,719
better the conversation

2276
01:39:04,119 --> 01:39:09,080
continues okay I think in general we're

2277
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,480
planning to stay away until beginning of

2278
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:14,000
the year and have the whole house

2279
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:17,560
treated with ozone and clean top to

2280
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:22,360
bottom you think by January is a good

2281
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:25,000
bet yes that's what I would do wait till

2282
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:27,960
then and we're going to buy some of the

2283
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,960
IQ air

2284
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:32,800
filters it's important to note here that

2285
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:35,639
in this conversation that takes place

2286
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:38,920
one month after Ashley's Hawaii Retreat

2287
01:39:35,639 --> 01:39:42,080
and is about smoke remediation not about

2288
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:43,800
Eczema or a cat Ashley brings up air

2289
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,599
filters and says they're going to buy

2290
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:48,800
some for smoke remediation Anthony was

2291
01:39:46,599 --> 01:39:50,159
not the one to bring it up the

2292
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:55,320
conversation goes

2293
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:55,320
on some rain could come in between too

2294
01:39:56,199 --> 01:40:00,960
yep

2295
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:04,360
yes lots of rain

2296
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:06,520
predicted get the multi-gas one plus

2297
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:08,840
when the rain comes with no brush to

2298
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:12,960
hold it back there will be lots of

2299
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:15,159
landslides so best to be away

2300
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:17,599
yes got

2301
01:40:15,159 --> 01:40:21,199
it thank

2302
01:40:17,599 --> 01:40:24,920
God Amen so many prayers covering our

2303
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:28,480
home thank you

2304
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:31,719
okay so as I said this was one month

2305
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:33,480
after Ashley's Hawaii Retreat Ashley had

2306
01:40:31,719 --> 01:40:37,599
gotten rid of their household cat on

2307
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:40,000
June 24th of this same year five months

2308
01:40:37,599 --> 01:40:42,599
prior to this conversation the air

2309
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,599
purifiers were her idea and she got them

2310
01:40:42,599 --> 01:40:47,520
for smoke remediation not for pet dander

2311
01:40:45,599 --> 01:40:50,320
or her son's eczema like one of her

2312
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:52,639
false versions of the infamous cat story

2313
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:55,760
suggested it's also worth noting that

2314
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:59,560
this convers on November 21st about

2315
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:02,520
Ashley's home took place 8 days after

2316
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:04,960
Stephanie passed away Ashley made no

2317
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:07,040
mention of Stephanie or any problem she

2318
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,520
had with Anthony around it but she

2319
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:11,679
certainly wanted his help with her

2320
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:14,679
multi-million dollar home I know that

2321
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:16,360
this is a lot for everybody to take in

2322
01:41:14,679 --> 01:41:19,080
thank you Amber for doing this for the

2323
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:21,440
community the evidence we presented

2324
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:24,880
today shows that Ashley can't get

2325
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:27,119
anything right even historical stories

2326
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,400
that can be easily fact checked and she

2327
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:31,920
has to fabricate and lie about her own

2328
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,560
personal experiences with me to try to

2329
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:37,520
convince people that I got it wrong to

2330
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:41,280
call me a liar and a fraud when as you

2331
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:43,440
can see here she's caught so many times

2332
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:45,760
in just what has been covered in this

2333
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,800
episode alone lying and telling

2334
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:51,560
fraudulent Stories the story about the

2335
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:54,400
10 booms and the Holocaust is a litmus

2336
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:57,159
test to Ashley's inability to tell not

2337
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:59,560
only stories about Stephanie and me and

2338
01:41:57,159 --> 01:42:02,320
the cat but clearly shows that she

2339
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:04,760
cannot even get a historic story even

2340
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:07,239
partially correct it's one thing when

2341
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:09,920
people hear all these versions of lies

2342
01:42:07,239 --> 01:42:12,280
and falsehoods and her madeup stories

2343
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:14,760
but it's another when you have a

2344
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:17,880
landmark such as the 10 Booms to clearly

2345
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:19,599
see how Ashley can't get it right it's

2346
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,520
another reason why I wouldn't do

2347
01:42:19,599 --> 01:42:24,239
business with Ashley when she proposed

2348
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:27,000
so many business deals she wanted to

2349
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:29,400
partner with me on painfully almost

2350
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,040
everything she said always had falsities

2351
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:34,599
or mistakes or misinformation saturated

2352
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:36,760
in it what Ashley's been doing with the

2353
01:42:34,599 --> 01:42:39,840
cat story is what she's been doing with

2354
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:42,679
her entire smear campaign against me as

2355
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:45,960
a whole it's an endless stream of sloppy

2356
01:42:42,679 --> 01:42:50,040
lies and psychological games how sad is

2357
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:52,360
it that I actually did help her son he

2358
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:55,960
recovered and I helped her out of the

2359
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:58,320
kindness of my heart for free I wasn't

2360
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:00,800
making any money from it I wasn't

2361
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:03,520
gaining anything from it and because she

2362
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:07,119
has nothing to show that I'm a bad guy

2363
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:09,719
or did anything wrong she has to lie and

2364
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:11,840
take something that was positive that I

2365
01:43:09,719 --> 01:43:14,920
actually helped her with and was

2366
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:17,199
accurate about and perverted to make it

2367
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:19,840
look like the exact opposite of what

2368
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:21,760
really happened so that she can try to

2369
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,639
take me

2370
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,920
down there are people who have serious

2371
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:29,119
mental health problems there are people

2372
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:31,800
who are just inaccurate and get things

2373
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:33,679
wrong there are people who attack and

2374
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:36,280
intentionally set out to harm other

2375
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:39,080
people there are people who FIB there

2376
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:41,960
are people who are pathological liars

2377
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:44,719
and then there's Ashley Foster she's

2378
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:47,360
truly in a league of her own this is

2379
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:50,239
unprecedented as we've said and in my

2380
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:52,800
opinion it should be studied

2381
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:54,960
clinically what's even more disturbing

2382
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:57,400
is that this episode just barely

2383
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:00,040
scratches the surface this is what

2384
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:03,159
Ashley does with every story with every

2385
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:07,040
claim with every rumor she spreads it's

2386
01:44:03,159 --> 01:44:08,520
all this distorted it's all this Twisted

2387
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,520
it's all this

2388
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:13,040
untrue and the other plotters have

2389
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:15,760
followed suit and have the same patterns

2390
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:17,960
we could do hundreds of podcast episodes

2391
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:20,920
on twisting the lies and falsities like

2392
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:23,679
this the evidence is all there and this

2393
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:25,920
is just the beginning

2394
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:28,040
with the Stephanie story Ashley and

2395
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,080
Stephanie's brother are abusing the fact

2396
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:32,320
that nobody else has access to the

2397
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:34,400
entirety of Stephanie's text threads

2398
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:36,840
with all of the people who were involved

2399
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,840
or any of the other evidence to see what

2400
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:41,560
Ashley and Stephanie's brother have

2401
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:43,880
hidden manipulated taken out of context

2402
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,719
and altered as they're making outrageous

2403
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:48,199
claims against Anthony and trying to

2404
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:50,840
rewrite history to push a fake story

2405
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:53,520
we'll get to more of that in due time

2406
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:55,880
the ten Boom story and the cat story are

2407
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:58,840
examples that everyone can use to verify

2408
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:01,560
for themselves exactly the level of

2409
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:04,080
unimaginable reality Distortion and

2410
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:06,440
perversion of the truth that Ashley and

2411
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:08,800
her hateful group have continued to

2412
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:10,560
employ with the Stephanie story and with

2413
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:13,199
the other stories that they

2414
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:15,520
tell one online commenter who has

2415
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:17,520
observed the behavior of Ashley and her

2416
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,199
hateful group said

2417
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:23,040
this everything they accuse Anthony and

2418
01:45:20,199 --> 01:45:26,119
the mm community of being is what they

2419
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:28,440
elves are doing to the mm Community it's

2420
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:30,679
so frustrating and sad the amount of

2421
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:32,719
gaslighting belittling and just pure

2422
01:45:30,679 --> 01:45:35,119
hostility from these people is hard to

2423
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:37,320
Bear especially after years of suffering

2424
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:39,520
chronic illness with no answers and all

2425
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:41,840
the trauma that comes with that it's

2426
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:43,520
painful and scary to witness how

2427
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,400
committed these people are to twisting

2428
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,280
reality and taking advantage of people

2429
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:48,360
who don't know any better how do they

2430
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:51,560
live with

2431
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:54,920
themselves another online commenter said

2432
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:56,719
this it's so despicable what are we in

2433
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:59,159
high school this is something high

2434
01:45:56,719 --> 01:46:01,280
schoolers and middle schoolers do it's

2435
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:03,719
Petty and narcissistic behavior it's a

2436
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:06,520
narcissistic smear campaign it's got

2437
01:46:03,719 --> 01:46:08,080
narcissists written all over it only

2438
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:11,000
people with hatred in their hearts would

2439
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:13,280
do this it's obvious but then comes the

2440
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,119
fakeness the lies the smearing of

2441
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:17,880
another person's name and reputation

2442
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:19,400
Without Regrets they are heartless

2443
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:21,599
you're supposed to take everyone into

2444
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:23,560
consideration before you act and speak

2445
01:46:21,599 --> 01:46:25,400
that is what adults do

2446
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:27,199
they will die a slow and lonely death on

2447
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:29,719
their socials and they should regret

2448
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:31,520
this the rest of their lives but Ashley

2449
01:46:29,719 --> 01:46:33,239
probably won't she's always seemed like

2450
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,320
she doesn't actually care about others

2451
01:46:33,239 --> 01:46:36,960
which is

2452
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:40,119
depressing and a third online commenter

2453
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:42,159
said this it has become ridiculous now

2454
01:46:40,119 --> 01:46:44,040
Amber I truly hope the plotters just

2455
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:46,880
fade into the background and leave this

2456
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:49,119
wonderful mm Community alone they are

2457
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:51,440
cruel very childish obsessed with

2458
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:53,400
revenge and embarrassing not forgetting

2459
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:55,679
the Carnage they leave behind that you

2460
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:57,920
mm and the community have to pick up and

2461
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:59,080
repair for those that sadly fell for

2462
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,400
their

2463
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:04,440
lies Ashley has formed her hateful Group

2464
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:06,520
by taking advantage of people who

2465
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:08,920
already have an ulterior reason why they

2466
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:11,040
don't like medical medium whether it's

2467
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:12,679
pure spiritual discrimination or

2468
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:14,880
somebody who sells ionizer water

2469
01:47:12,679 --> 01:47:16,280
machines for example who got mad at

2470
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,239
Anthony when he started sharing about

2471
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:20,920
the downsides of ionizer water machines

2472
01:47:19,239 --> 01:47:23,000
because of how much influence he has in

2473
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:24,560
the health industry

2474
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,920
they're also taking advantage of the

2475
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,239
fact that when people are dealing with

2476
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,360
chronic illness they often get confused

2477
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:32,040
about their

2478
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:33,920
symptoms when somebody's confused

2479
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:36,400
they're may be not reading the books or

2480
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:38,880
understanding trajectory or flare Cycles

2481
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:41,159
or new exposures they're may be having a

2482
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:43,080
hard time implementing the information

2483
01:47:41,159 --> 01:47:45,360
they're frustrated with their symptoms

2484
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:47,119
they're emotional they're vulnerable and

2485
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:49,400
then they come across a post from Ashley

2486
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:51,679
Foster that says Anthony is a liar and a

2487
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:54,320
fraud he missed the fact that my son had

2488
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:56,280
a cat allergy he put me on a restrictive

2489
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:59,679
diet that made my nails break and my

2490
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:02,679
hair fall out it strikes a cord it

2491
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:05,679
instills doubt and fear and that is

2492
01:48:02,679 --> 01:48:07,760
Ashley's goal when in reality the story

2493
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:11,320
she told is the opposite of what

2494
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:14,440
actually happened it's all lies designed

2495
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:16,320
to play on people's emotions it's sick

2496
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:18,840
it's manipulative and it's

2497
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,119
self-serving Ashley does not care about

2498
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:23,920
the chronically ill Ashley doesn't care

2499
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:26,360
about people healing Ashley has publicly

2500
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:29,520
attacked shamed and humiliated the

2501
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:31,520
chronically ill and women and children

2502
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:34,320
which is going to be exposed in this

2503
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:37,639
series this is all about Ashley getting

2504
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:40,520
what she wants and she will lie and use

2505
01:48:37,639 --> 01:48:43,760
and harm anyone that she needs to in the

2506
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:46,360
process there's no other way to say it

2507
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:48,400
it is abusive behavior and Ashley needs

2508
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:51,040
to be held

2509
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:53,520
accountable as we are in the process of

2510
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:55,480
exposing Ashley and her organized

2511
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,920
hateful group for who and what they

2512
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:59,880
really are it's important to take note

2513
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:02,400
of their tactics and patterns that are

2514
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:04,800
likely to follow the plotters have a

2515
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:07,920
documented history of initiating attacks

2516
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:10,199
using lies and misinformation and then

2517
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:13,239
upon getting called out and corrected

2518
01:49:10,199 --> 01:49:15,920
trying to flip it and play victim that

2519
01:49:13,239 --> 01:49:18,480
is not going to work here all this group

2520
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:20,719
has done is spread verifiable lies and

2521
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:23,360
falsities they've carelessly attacked

2522
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:25,520
and harmed many innocent people they've

2523
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:27,280
used and exploited deceased individuals

2524
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:30,040
and others in the process of trying to

2525
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:32,520
get what they want they've repeatedly

2526
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:34,440
explicitly expressed the intent to harm

2527
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:36,159
medical medium and they've even

2528
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:38,360
deliberately tried to stop Anthony from

2529
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:41,080
doing a free event to support and raise

2530
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:43,199
money for the community we have every

2531
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:45,679
right to set the record straight and to

2532
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:47,599
defend the truth with facts and evidence

2533
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,159
and to defend the chronically ill

2534
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:51,639
against the malicious attacks of this

2535
01:49:49,159 --> 01:49:55,400
group and we are going to continue to do

2536
01:49:51,639 --> 01:49:58,119
so we expect the plotters to evade and

2537
01:49:55,400 --> 01:50:00,000
ignore what they have done wrong we

2538
01:49:58,119 --> 01:50:02,920
expect them to continue to lie and

2539
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,920
spread falsities we expect them to Pivot

2540
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:09,080
onto something new they'll make up and

2541
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:12,080
we expect them to skew and alter data

2542
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:14,800
and to hide critical pieces of evidence

2543
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:17,800
that undermines their entire campaign we

2544
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:20,119
also expect the plotters to fabricate

2545
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:22,040
explanations as they do everything they

2546
01:50:20,119 --> 01:50:25,119
can to try to discredit what we're

2547
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:28,679
exposing them for having done and said

2548
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:31,520
in their own words but we are using

2549
01:50:28,679 --> 01:50:35,239
their own text messages voice messages

2550
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:37,719
social media posts words that they spoke

2551
01:50:35,239 --> 01:50:40,880
on recorded calls and other published

2552
01:50:37,719 --> 01:50:44,280
materials there's no use of any AI in

2553
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:46,679
