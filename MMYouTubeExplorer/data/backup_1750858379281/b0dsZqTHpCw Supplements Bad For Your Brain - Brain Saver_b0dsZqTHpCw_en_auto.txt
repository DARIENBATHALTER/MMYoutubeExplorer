[0.84 - 4.86] I'm so blown away at the brain saver
[3.66 - 7.32] books
[4.86 - 10.02] that I'm reading them going through them
[7.32 - 11.52] and it's just mind-boggling how much
[10.02 - 13.22] information coming from spiritual
[11.52 - 17.48] compassion that just blows my mind
[13.22 - 17.48] greatest books of all time
[17.64 - 21.12] swear to God
[19.62 - 23.64] last night
[21.12 - 28.16] four bed
[23.64 - 28.16] I was praying to God okay and
[28.44 - 33.12] was bypassing Spirit of compassion said
[30.30 - 36.54] you know I just I gotta do some prayers
[33.12 - 38.16] here and I was saying how grateful I was
[36.54 - 40.56] because
[38.16 - 43.44] regardless of how much work it was and
[40.56 - 46.80] how much work it is and how much
[43.44 - 49.26] crap I have to face and take from doing
[46.80 - 51.06] it because no one wants the industries
[49.26 - 54.30] don't want these books out
[51.06 - 56.46] that's evident we know that and
[54.30 - 58.44] it's incredible to think that this
[56.46 - 61.80] information
[58.44 - 64.20] came from above and to know people are
[61.80 - 66.42] getting instant relief from the from the
[64.20 - 68.04] brain shot therapies instant relief just
[66.42 - 70.62] like Spirit of compassion told me and
[68.04 - 73.08] just like instant relief
[70.62 - 76.08] it's just something that you just can't
[73.08 - 78.24] even imagine to Be Alive In This Moment
[76.08 - 80.46] In Time
[78.24 - 82.26] to make it this far I didn't think I was
[80.46 - 85.08] going to make it I didn't think I was
[82.26 - 86.46] going to make it past 12. 12 years old I
[85.08 - 87.48] just didn't you know hearing Spirit of
[86.46 - 88.86] compassion and then all the
[87.48 - 91.44] responsibilities I just didn't think I
[88.86 - 92.76] would make it and I think I made it this
[91.44 - 94.38] far
[92.76 - 96.60] and
[94.38 - 99.12] with all the gray in my beard and all
[96.60 - 102.24] the brain my hair hair the things I made
[99.12 - 106.08] made it this far and to actually be able
[102.24 - 108.56] to receive that information not lose my
[106.08 - 112.14] mind doing it
[108.56 - 114.24] and put in 20-hour days
[112.14 - 115.86] sacrifice everything I could possibly
[114.24 - 118.08] sacrifice
[115.86 - 120.36] I didn't shower for three months I mean
[118.08 - 123.66] just whatever it's like you just
[120.36 - 126.18] I just ate and slept in it right slept
[123.66 - 128.58] two hours and then worked and ate in it
[126.18 - 132.12] and just whatever the thing I got this
[128.58 - 135.00] far in being able to somehow survive and
[132.12 - 137.10] get these unbelievable books the
[135.00 - 138.42] greatest books of all time in
[137.10 - 141.54] alternative and conventional medicine
[138.42 - 143.70] history hands down it will be they are
[141.54 - 145.50] I'm allowed to say it because it's my
[143.70 - 146.88] opinion because Spirit of compassion
[145.50 - 150.18] gave me the information and I could
[146.88 - 152.10] judge I could judge that information
[150.18 - 153.96] and
[152.10 - 155.58] what I'm seeing in these books and what
[153.96 - 157.62] I'm seeing what's happening with you

[793.50 - 799.16] a very hated messenger
[795.84 - 801.66] turpentine oil Pearl powder oyster
[799.16 - 804.12] supplements I'm doing the problematic
[801.66 - 807.84] and damaging section oyster supplements
[804.12 - 810.72] Pearl powder sodium bicarbonate
[807.84 - 813.24] meaning baking soda when taken
[810.72 - 816.42] internally in large amounts
[813.24 - 819.84] sodium bicarbonate bad bad bad
[816.42 - 822.72] really damages the body
[819.84 - 824.64] whey protein powder and guess what's
[822.72 - 827.24] last on the list but in problematic and
[824.64 - 830.94] damaging zeolites
[827.24 - 832.02] zeolites zeolite okay so I want to go in
[830.94 - 833.64] there a little bit now there's so much
[832.02 - 834.72] information here it can only cover so
[833.64 - 837.18] much
[834.72 - 838.08] let's talk about why let's hit the Y's a
[837.18 - 841.08] little bit
[838.08 - 842.76] which is going to be fun okay so I'm in
[841.08 - 844.50] it's one thing to say it it's one thing
[842.76 - 845.94] to be like that's bad for you that's bad
[844.50 - 849.18] for you that's bad for you it's another
[845.94 - 852.20] to have an explanation from above that
[849.18 - 852.20] blows your mind
[852.60 - 856.08] that's I mean you know
[854.34 - 858.06] problematic and damaging supplements
[856.08 - 861.48] let's talk about alkaline ionizer water
[858.06 - 864.74] machines it's in that category you ready
[861.48 - 868.56] metal plates inside these machines
[864.74 - 872.10] corrode and oxidize over time
[868.56 - 874.64] slowly leaching oxidized metal byproduct
[872.10 - 878.04] and metal nanoparticles into the water
[874.64 - 880.10] regardless of what brand of machine
[878.04 - 882.42] regardless of what brand of machine
[880.10 - 884.76] oxidized metal byproduct and metal
[882.42 - 887.10] nanoparticles eventually lead to
[884.76 - 889.76] neurological symptoms
[887.10 - 892.62] eventually lead to neurological symptoms
[889.76 - 894.66] alkaline ionizer water machines are not
[892.62 - 898.20] water purifiers their filtration is
[894.66 - 900.18] limited water becomes dead water as it's
[898.20 - 901.92] being deconstructed by the electricity
[900.18 - 904.56] of these machines the water becomes
[901.92 - 906.18] foreign to the human body that's number
[904.56 - 907.68] one on the problematic and damaging
[906.18 - 908.94] supplements unless they're all bad but
[907.68 - 910.92] I'm just saying that's number one number
[908.94 - 912.96] two number three let's move into a
[910.92 - 915.36] couple of different ones okay
[912.96 - 917.16] let's go with bentonite clay how many of
[915.36 - 919.02] you guys been sucked into bentonite clay
[917.16 - 921.84] that whole thing
[919.02 - 924.42] that whole thing
[921.84 - 926.88] bentonite clay these Clays do not remove
[924.42 - 928.92] toxic heavy metals they are too harsh
[926.88 - 930.12] and aggressive on the intestinal tract
[928.92 - 933.00] lining
[930.12 - 934.14] they act as sandpaper in your intestinal
[933.00 - 936.54] tract
[934.14 - 938.28] Clays irritate sensitive nerves that
[936.54 - 940.74] connect in and around the intestinal
[938.28 - 942.30] tract so anybody who has any kind of
[940.74 - 943.80] condition or symptom at all does the
[942.30 - 945.48] bentonite clay in the Clays they're
[943.80 - 947.76] going to totally mess their system all
[945.48 - 950.58] up like their nerves people with
[947.76 - 952.56] sensitive or inflamed vagus nerves you
[950.58 - 955.92] guys vagus nerves should not ingest
[952.56 - 958.02] Clays educating myself how are you page
[955.92 - 961.02] 77 finally the explanation for
[958.02 - 963.74] spontaneous human combustion
[961.02 - 966.72] I am at your service
[963.74 - 968.58] I can't take the credit because it's up
[966.72 - 970.74] there it comes from and I'm a messenger
[968.58 - 972.78] and received it Lisa Marie says years
[970.74 - 974.64] ago you suggested zeolite so no more and
[972.78 - 977.40] I've I've explained that explanation
[974.64 - 979.56] over and over again
[977.40 - 983.10] the only one that I recommended years
[979.56 - 985.92] ago okay still wasn't the greatest
[983.10 - 988.38] but it wasn't as problematic now here's
[985.92 - 990.90] here's the thing we also didn't have
[988.38 - 992.46] pure sources of dolls at the time or
[990.90 - 993.48] other things that were available out
[992.46 - 995.16] there so I was trying to give people
[993.48 - 998.10] another little option but here's the
[995.16 - 1000.68] thing the industry changed the zeolite
[998.10 - 1002.90] industry changed zeolites that were
[1000.68 - 1004.94] inedible were processed in the same
[1002.90 - 1008.42] factories as the ones that were edible
[1004.94 - 1010.10] the inedible ones tear up your
[1008.42 - 1012.80] intestinal lining
[1010.10 - 1014.12] boom real bad
[1012.80 - 1017.78] so
[1014.12 - 1018.86] the world changed I I have my own free
[1017.78 - 1020.96] will
[1018.86 - 1022.10] but the but what they do they have their
[1020.96 - 1023.90] own free will
[1022.10 - 1026.48] and they wanna they wanna do what they
[1023.90 - 1028.04] want to do the the quality and things
[1026.48 - 1029.78] and whatnot and the zeolites that's a
[1028.04 - 1031.30] whole nother game I'm just telling you
[1029.78 - 1033.38] what happened and so that
[1031.30 - 1035.48] cross-contamination was another big part
[1033.38 - 1038.36] of it along with other problems too as
[1035.48 - 1041.72] everything changed
[1038.36 - 1044.72] okay I never said they'd do anything but
[1041.72 - 1046.82] help a tiny bit in the intestinal tract
[1044.72 - 1048.02] if it's the right one there is no right
[1046.82 - 1050.60] one right now
[1048.02 - 1052.46] and but zeolites never travel into the
[1050.60 - 1053.72] bloodstream and remove Metals out of
[1052.46 - 1055.28] your brain they never did it and I never
[1053.72 - 1057.08] said they did
[1055.28 - 1058.58] okay so let's go a little bit further
[1057.08 - 1060.02] here so I want to talk about the Clays a
[1058.58 - 1061.88] little bit more get this
[1060.02 - 1064.78] Bentonite
[1061.88 - 1067.34] The Details Matter by the way
[1064.78 - 1070.70] Bentonite Clays can also disrupt
[1067.34 - 1071.54] microbiome so anybody taking the claims
[1070.70 - 1074.66] and they're worried about their
[1071.54 - 1077.62] microbiome they're completely
[1074.66 - 1080.12] tearing their microbiome to shreds
[1077.62 - 1082.04] Bentonite and other clay suffocate good
[1080.12 - 1083.42] bacteria and microorganisms so if you've
[1082.04 - 1084.86] got good bacteria in your gut because
[1083.42 - 1086.42] it's all about good bacteria in your gut
[1084.86 - 1087.62] good bacteria in your guts all you hear
[1086.42 - 1090.14] out there well guess what you take the
[1087.62 - 1092.90] Bentonite Clays you're gonna
[1090.14 - 1095.20] tear up that good bacteria suffocate
[1092.90 - 1097.64] them kill them
[1095.20 - 1100.10] microorganisms that don't need oxygen
[1097.64 - 1101.84] that does that don't mind being
[1100.10 - 1102.88] suffocated or the bad stuff so check
[1101.84 - 1105.68] this out
[1102.88 - 1108.20] Bentonite and other clay suffocate good
[1105.68 - 1110.24] bacteria and microorganisms and allow
[1108.20 - 1112.10] bad bacteria and microorganisms to
[1110.24 - 1114.16] thrive because Clays remove oxygen
[1112.10 - 1116.42] inside the intestinal tract get ready
[1114.16 - 1118.52] mind-blowing information here it goes
[1116.42 - 1120.38] way ahead of research in science way
[1118.52 - 1122.72] ahead of any anywhere out there I'm just
[1120.38 - 1124.88] going to drop this bomb good bacteria
[1122.72 - 1127.90] and microorganisms need higher levels of
[1124.88 - 1127.90] oxygen to survive
[1128.00 - 1134.98] inside our gut
[1130.94 - 1134.98] that oxygen comes from your food
[1135.38 - 1141.80] bad bacteria and microorganisms need
[1137.90 - 1144.08] lower levels of oxygen to survive Clays
[1141.80 - 1145.88] can create a chronic dehydration within
[1144.08 - 1149.12] the intestinal tract raising bad
[1145.88 - 1151.46] bacteria you take your Clays zeolites of
[1149.12 - 1153.38] clay you take your Clays all them and
[1151.46 - 1156.16] what happens is you raise your bad
[1153.38 - 1156.16] bacteria
[1156.50 - 1160.46] I'm not making friends
[1158.66 - 1162.44] because it's not about that I have to
[1160.46 - 1163.76] have the chronically ill they're back I
[1162.44 - 1165.86] have to have their back
[1163.76 - 1167.84] I have to look out for them
[1165.86 - 1169.28] I noticed that in this world I'm just
[1167.84 - 1171.92] going to just tell you right now just
[1169.28 - 1174.44] heart to heart for two seconds you guys
[1171.92 - 1175.64] would I witness every day and have
[1174.44 - 1178.10] is
[1175.64 - 1179.96] the people the gurus and all that and
[1178.10 - 1181.46] the people in the health movement you
[1179.96 - 1182.66] see them out there they're on podcasts
[1181.46 - 1184.46] and whatever they're doing all their
[1182.66 - 1187.58] thing they're on YouTube doing running
[1184.46 - 1191.14] ads or whatever it is all those gurus
[1187.58 - 1191.14] they're just about making friends
[1191.30 - 1196.40] they'll never go the right direction in
[1193.58 - 1197.78] the end because they're all about what
[1196.40 - 1198.92] friends they got and what friends they
[1197.78 - 1200.18] keep they don't care about the
[1198.92 - 1202.40] chronically ill
[1200.18 - 1204.68] they don't take risks
[1202.40 - 1206.72] they steal and poach when it fits their
[1204.68 - 1208.70] they still improach from mm when it fits
[1206.72 - 1210.92] their narrative in the moment that they
[1208.70 - 1212.72] want to do but they don't care about the
[1210.92 - 1214.94] chronic Lil
[1212.72 - 1217.10] I'm not about making friends I'm about
[1214.94 - 1219.86] making sure you guys have what you need
[1217.10 - 1222.38] anything that comes with it whatever
[1219.86 - 1224.18] Tara Appleman hey so sad bentonite clay
[1222.38 - 1226.04] is one of the first things I tried to
[1224.18 - 1228.92] heal my gut needless to say it didn't
[1226.04 - 1230.72] help it's it's the first thing that so
[1228.92 - 1232.16] many people have tried okay let's go
[1230.72 - 1234.14] into another area
[1232.16 - 1236.72] I can't read all this there's too much
[1234.14 - 1240.62] information in these books you guys 40
[1236.72 - 1243.44] off right now at amazon.com 40 off when
[1240.62 - 1246.74] I saw it this morning I actually yelped
[1243.44 - 1248.18] actually like screamed I was like oh my
[1246.74 - 1252.08] God
[1248.18 - 1255.38] 29 for for brand saver
[1252.08 - 1257.18] 27 for brain saver protocols both books
[1255.38 - 1259.70] you need
[1257.18 - 1263.44] okay let's hit another one
[1259.70 - 1263.44] there's so many to choose from
[1264.68 - 1272.32] let's see let's do a simple one
[1267.50 - 1272.32] chlorella everybody chlorella Chlorella
[1275.48 - 1279.74] recommended chlorella I saw it online
[1277.22 - 1281.72] that's really good for me first of all
[1279.74 - 1283.94] it does not bind down to toxic heavy
[1281.72 - 1287.24] metals properly
[1283.94 - 1290.78] let me make that clear it does not bind
[1287.24 - 1293.36] onto toxic heavy metals properly
[1290.78 - 1297.14] spreads toxic heavy metals into adjacent
[1293.36 - 1300.20] tissue chlorella spreads toxic heavy
[1297.14 - 1301.94] metals into adjacent tissue inside the
[1300.20 - 1305.12] brain that's what it does
[1301.94 - 1309.22] so let's just keep on eating it
[1305.12 - 1309.22] chlorella does not have
[1309.56 - 1313.76] oh it says something else here
[1311.24 - 1315.56] accelerating brain conditions let me add
[1313.76 - 1317.66] that in I'm sorry about that spreads
[1315.56 - 1320.54] toxic heavy metals into adjacent tissue
[1317.66 - 1322.34] accelerating brain conditions
[1320.54 - 1325.78] I don't want to take chlorella if it's
[1322.34 - 1325.78] going to accelerate a brain condition
[1326.30 - 1330.88] chlorella does not have the ability to
[1328.76 - 1334.18] remove toxic heavy metals from the body
[1330.88 - 1338.38] chlorella is not antibacterial or
[1334.18 - 1342.62] anti-viral rather listen to this
[1338.38 - 1344.84] ready it often contains bad bacteria
[1342.62 - 1347.48] resulting in foodborne illness so okay
[1344.84 - 1349.94] let me just buy some chlorella and get
[1347.48 - 1351.62] some foodborne illness that's just one
[1349.94 - 1354.20] that's a fun one let's try to find
[1351.62 - 1357.20] another fun oh Pearl powder
[1354.20 - 1360.26] has been like Pearl powder Pearl powder
[1357.20 - 1362.84] and this here I think this is why I this
[1360.26 - 1367.46] is why so many fake stories and slander
[1362.84 - 1368.90] and hits and smear attacks happen
[1367.46 - 1370.76] towards me
[1368.90 - 1372.32] to the point where there's so much of it
[1370.76 - 1374.00] flooded out there you just can't get
[1372.32 - 1376.28] away from it there's so much made up
[1374.00 - 1378.44] crap about me and this is an example
[1376.28 - 1381.50] Pearl powder if you have a bunch of
[1378.44 - 1383.12] people invested in Pearl powder
[1381.50 - 1385.04] and they they're making it their jam
[1383.12 - 1387.20] they're making it their life and then I
[1385.04 - 1389.30] come along and I'm like don't do it
[1387.20 - 1390.86] Pearl powder because I'm getting the
[1389.30 - 1393.92] information from above Pro powder is not
[1390.86 - 1396.02] good for you now I have 50 more enemies
[1393.92 - 1397.58] online and who knows who they know or
[1396.02 - 1400.94] don't and what they spread and what they
[1397.58 - 1404.42] do because it's just but like I said you
[1400.94 - 1407.30] can go along the way and make friends
[1404.42 - 1409.16] and Bank on it too I could come out with
[1407.30 - 1411.44] a medical medium Pearl powder and sell
[1409.16 - 1414.86] it to all you guys and Bank on a ton of
[1411.44 - 1416.54] money and then to all my Pro powder
[1414.86 - 1418.34] friends won't be mad at me and they'll
[1416.54 - 1421.34] all be happy and everybody will be happy
[1418.34 - 1423.08] but that's evil so I don't work for evil
[1421.34 - 1426.32] there's good there's evil I don't work
[1423.08 - 1427.34] for evil so when it comes down to Pearl
[1426.32 - 1429.38] powder
[1427.34 - 1431.30] I wrote something about it in here well
[1429.38 - 1433.76] I got it from Spirit of compassion and I
[1431.30 - 1435.68] wrote down in here you ready an irrits
[1433.76 - 1437.60] hint that's abrasive to the intestinal
[1435.68 - 1439.40] lining serious like my Pearl powder
[1437.60 - 1441.50] meanwhile they're getting scratched up
[1439.40 - 1443.00] really bad on their intestinal Linings
[1441.50 - 1445.40] and it leads to problems and then
[1443.00 - 1447.74] they'll blame their celery juice
[1445.40 - 1449.96] it irritant that's abrasive to the
[1447.74 - 1452.30] intestinal Linings triggering vagus
[1449.96 - 1455.24] nerves Pearl powder is going to trigger
[1452.30 - 1456.62] vagus nerves in people creating problems
[1455.24 - 1459.44] where they're going to have panic
[1456.62 - 1461.74] attacks like one girl out there and guy
[1459.44 - 1465.62] out there wants another panic attack
[1461.74 - 1467.48] educating myself page 62 too so all
[1465.62 - 1468.80] right so you're on YouTube educating
[1467.48 - 1471.98] myself all right you're on YouTube so
[1468.80 - 1475.64] you sing viral replicate oh replication
[1471.98 - 1477.62] yes wow the book is literally heavy with
[1475.64 - 1481.28] insights okay so you're on you're on the
[1477.62 - 1485.18] you're on the whole thing of viral
[1481.28 - 1487.04] um reproduction whoa yeah replicating
[1485.18 - 1490.24] itself incredible so it's fine at page
[1487.04 - 1490.24] 62 I can't help it
[1490.88 - 1496.16] oh which book am I in
[1493.40 - 1497.66] let's just just find it for a second
[1496.16 - 1500.12] and then we'll go back to having some
[1497.66 - 1502.04] fun for for a minute here you're page 62
[1500.12 - 1504.88] and brain saver there it is viral
[1502.04 - 1504.88] replication
[1505.82 - 1509.72] yep
[1507.98 - 1512.62] I'm probably not allowed to read this
[1509.72 - 1512.62] here

[1540.08 - 1543.32] powder

[1545.60 - 1549.32] it does not leave the intestinal tract
[1547.88 - 1552.56] quickly you guys
[1549.32 - 1554.84] it accumulates and cakes inside pockets
[1552.56 - 1557.06] of the intestinal tract lining so what
[1554.84 - 1558.80] it's doing it's caking in the pockets
[1557.06 - 1559.58] you've got all these girls and guys out
[1558.80 - 1561.56] there
[1559.58 - 1564.32] they got all these intestinal tract
[1561.56 - 1565.76] conditions they're taking Pearl powder
[1564.32 - 1569.72] think it's going to make their skin and
[1565.76 - 1573.74] their nails and their hair so great
[1569.72 - 1576.02] and they're tearing apart their
[1573.74 - 1577.70] intestinal tract
[1576.02 - 1579.38] Pearl powder does not leave the
[1577.70 - 1580.94] intestinal dry quickly it accumulates
[1579.38 - 1582.74] and cakes inside pockets of the
[1580.94 - 1584.84] intestinal tract lining you guys need
[1582.74 - 1586.52] these books just so you can protect
[1584.84 - 1589.64] yourself so you don't get swayed into
[1586.52 - 1592.64] some direction avoid if you have any
[1589.64 - 1594.62] type of intestinal tract disorder
[1592.64 - 1595.76] I don't know but I got like friends
[1594.62 - 1597.32] telling me there's a whole bunch of
[1595.76 - 1598.76] people using Pro powder out there and
[1597.32 - 1599.90] they all got intestinal tract disorders
[1598.76 - 1601.64] and they're all complaining it's getting
[1599.90 - 1604.34] worse but it's not the pro powder it's
[1601.64 - 1606.74] the celery juice right
[1604.34 - 1608.60] avoid if you have any type of intestinal
[1606.74 - 1610.46] tract problem Pearl powder carries
[1608.60 - 1613.16] traces of Mercury
[1610.46 - 1614.24] why does Pearl powder carry Mercury do
[1613.16 - 1617.30] you guys know
[1614.24 - 1619.94] I'm trying to think why would Pearl
[1617.30 - 1621.50] pearls contain mercury Spirit of
[1619.94 - 1623.72] compassion told me this no one's ever
[1621.50 - 1625.64] talked about this ever
[1623.72 - 1629.20] and when I heard that so I was like okay
[1625.64 - 1629.20] Spirits give me what you got
[1629.30 - 1634.76] and he's and basically we're saying was
[1631.58 - 1638.36] well it's it's mercury in the pearl
[1634.76 - 1640.58] powder and I'm like what do you mean
[1638.36 - 1642.32] the accumulation of pearl powder on the
[1640.58 - 1645.02] intestinal tract lining can eventually
[1642.32 - 1646.70] cause bloating due to the powder not
[1645.02 - 1648.14] allowing gas to flow through the
[1646.70 - 1649.46] intestinal tract properly so what
[1648.14 - 1652.52] happens is
[1649.46 - 1655.40] you get pockets of gas that stay into
[1652.52 - 1656.42] you in in you too long because of pearl
[1655.40 - 1658.10] powder
[1656.42 - 1660.10] and the Mercury is going to feed God
[1658.10 - 1662.12] knows what inside of somebody's gut
[1660.10 - 1663.20] streptococcus viruses and everything
[1662.12 - 1666.32] else
[1663.20 - 1668.30] there's mercury in there duh
[1666.32 - 1670.10] okay so let's see let's see if we can
[1668.30 - 1671.84] find another one
[1670.10 - 1674.96] and there's so many in here you guys
[1671.84 - 1676.46] look we're reading in here good to see

[1771.32 - 1777.56] salesman in the tick tock
[1774.08 - 1780.20] engine somewhere or an ionizer a water
[1777.56 - 1782.24] machine user who works in there and it's

[1790.70 - 1794.54] okay let's look look a little bit more
[1792.68 - 1796.10] let's do some okay fish oil and krill
[1794.54 - 1798.14] oil I'm gonna read that one for a moment
[1796.10 - 1800.30] because so many people are on krill oil
[1798.14 - 1802.46] and it's almost like just they're just
[1800.30 - 1803.90] all on krill oil right it's everywhere
[1802.46 - 1807.92] and you you see people that are supposed
[1803.90 - 1809.84] to be so so like
[1807.92 - 1813.14] um really intelligent in the health
[1809.84 - 1814.46] world right they got big websites and
[1813.14 - 1815.72] they're selling lots of stuff they put
[1814.46 - 1817.76] articles out all the time they're
[1815.72 - 1820.52] doctors they're practitioners or they're
[1817.76 - 1822.02] just big influencers or authors and
[1820.52 - 1823.16] they're all into krill oil and you see
[1822.02 - 1825.14] them and you're like wait a minute
[1823.16 - 1826.94] you're supposed to be really smart I
[1825.14 - 1829.46] mean you don't know by now
[1826.94 - 1831.56] from medical medium information contains
[1829.46 - 1834.38] okay so fish oil and krill oil contains
[1831.56 - 1836.48] a homeopathic version of mercury so
[1834.38 - 1838.70] krill oil contains a homeopathic version
[1836.48 - 1840.02] of mercury the essence of mercury but
[1838.70 - 1842.48] get this
[1840.02 - 1844.58] left over after Mercury removal from
[1842.48 - 1847.22] many fish oils allowing methyl Mercury
[1844.58 - 1850.04] to enter the brain easily accelerating
[1847.22 - 1851.90] brain diseases most fish oils are
[1850.04 - 1853.70] manufactured with unwanted fish
[1851.90 - 1855.32] by-product and waste from various
[1853.70 - 1857.66] varieties of fish brought to the
[1855.32 - 1859.22] processing centers and mixed matched
[1857.66 - 1862.22] together during the oil extraction
[1859.22 - 1864.08] process one fish oil capsule can be
[1862.22 - 1867.08] filled with fish oil that was derived
[1864.08 - 1870.02] from dozens of fishes
[1867.08 - 1871.28] when a fish dies the okay
[1870.02 - 1873.32] ready
[1871.28 - 1875.48] you want to hear a mind-blowing line
[1873.32 - 1877.28] there's a mind-blowing line in every
[1875.48 - 1878.72] line in these two books but you want to
[1877.28 - 1880.52] hear a really mind-blowing line that
[1878.72 - 1882.68] like it's just crazy when I even think
[1880.52 - 1884.78] about it when I even read it
[1882.68 - 1887.18] get ready for this
[1884.78 - 1890.36] I mean legendary just unique original
[1887.18 - 1893.12] information from above
[1890.36 - 1895.58] when a fish dies the Mercury and other
[1893.12 - 1899.12] toxic heavy metals oxidize and expand
[1895.58 - 1901.22] more quickly in the dying fish oil
[1899.12 - 1902.18] Who would know that research and science
[1901.22 - 1905.78] doesn't
[1902.18 - 1908.78] due to gases being produced because the
[1905.78 - 1910.70] fish is decomposing
[1908.78 - 1912.38] so when the fish dies and it's
[1910.70 - 1915.62] decomposing
[1912.38 - 1917.98] the Mercury becomes more dangerous in
[1915.62 - 1917.98] the fish
[1920.18 - 1924.92] this is why it's much safer to eat a
[1922.82 - 1928.40] fish than to take a fish oil supplement
[1924.92 - 1930.50] you would never eat as much oil eating a
[1928.40 - 1933.26] piece of fish as you would concentrated
[1930.50 - 1936.02] into a fish oil capsule I mean that's
[1933.26 - 1939.08] just incredible right educating myself
[1936.02 - 1941.00] again says the whole book is
[1939.08 - 1944.44] how much else did you crack me up love
[1941.00 - 1944.44] your jokes I try

[2015.04 - 2019.42] the hormones in Deer Antler disrupt
[2017.92 - 2021.34] naturally produced and occurring
[2019.42 - 2022.84] hormones in the body so we're all about
[2021.34 - 2024.76] hormones right every though everything

[2082.06 - 2086.86] the endocrine system occurs the higher
[2084.16 - 2088.54] the dosage and the longer the dosage is
[2086.86 - 2091.42] taken so somebody's like I take a deer
[2088.54 - 2094.36] antler for 10 years
[2091.42 - 2096.10] the more withdrawal can occur eventually
[2094.36 - 2098.80] causing adrenal fatigue and hair loss

[2244.24 - 2247.90] so many people are on turpentine oil
[2245.92 - 2250.68] it's you know Scorch is the intestinal
[2247.90 - 2250.68] tract linings
[2250.72 - 2256.66] turpentine oil Scorch is the intestinal
[2253.42 - 2258.28] tract Linings you know sign up to the
[2256.66 - 2260.02] medical medium newsletter if you want to
[2258.28 - 2261.46] know about the future light blast that
[2260.02 - 2263.44] I'm going to do with everybody sign up
[2261.46 - 2265.60] to the newsletter
[2263.44 - 2267.22] go to medicalmedium.com or look for the
[2265.60 - 2269.20] link
[2267.22 - 2270.94] turpentine oil scorches the intestinal
[2269.20 - 2272.80] tract Linings killing off more good
[2270.94 - 2275.68] bacteria and microorganisms than bad
[2272.80 - 2277.48] bacteria and microorganisms
[2275.68 - 2279.34] you're killing off the good stuff when
[2277.48 - 2282.78] you take the turpentine oil
[2279.34 - 2282.78] you're killing the good stuff
[2283.12 - 2287.26] when entering the bloodstream when
[2285.28 - 2288.94] turpentine oil and enters the
[2287.26 - 2291.34] bloodstream
[2288.94 - 2292.90] you're raising blood toxicity
[2291.34 - 2295.18] not good
[2292.90 - 2297.64] which stresses and intoxicates the liver
[2295.18 - 2300.28] and brain turpentine oil has a very high
[2297.64 - 2302.80] astringency factor that almost brings it
[2300.28 - 2305.26] to a solvent level when you're taking
[2302.80 - 2307.36] turpentine oil you're actually almost
[2305.26 - 2309.58] bringing your blood toxicity to a
[2307.36 - 2312.28] solvent level which is not good for the
[2309.58 - 2316.60] brain I don't know I do not correct
[2312.28 - 2319.98] English do not recommend turpentine oil
[2316.60 - 2319.98] maybe we can do another one
[2321.34 - 2325.96] there's so many
[2324.10 - 2328.18] nay a
[2325.96 - 2329.02] please tell me which book would help the
[2328.18 - 2331.24] best

[2360.58 - 2365.52] would start book one and then move to

[2368.56 - 2374.64] I'm in a good mood because
[2371.56 - 2374.64] when I think about
[2375.28 - 2380.38] how many lives these books are gonna
[2376.96 - 2382.18] save it gives you some like it gives you

[2524.20 - 2527.92] Miriam says I love the alien podcast now
[2526.66 - 2529.18] I just want to forewarn you I know
[2527.92 - 2531.52] there's a few people that got really
[2529.18 - 2533.74] upset about the alien podcast because it
[2531.52 - 2536.20] scared them and that medical meme
[2533.74 - 2538.12] information is positive and it has all
[2536.20 - 2541.48] this healing information and then here I
[2538.12 - 2544.60] come out with this big old alien podcast
[2541.48 - 2547.42] episode and I come out with this big old
[2544.60 - 2549.16] alien just two-hour podcast episode and
[2547.42 - 2552.94] I tell my story of what happened to me
[2549.16 - 2555.16] when I was younger and with
[2552.94 - 2557.26] the extraterrestrials and you know when
[2555.16 - 2559.66] I and I talked about that and then I
[2557.26 - 2563.62] talked about things about how things
[2559.66 - 2566.32] work or could work or if
[2563.62 - 2568.18] and I know a lot of I know a few people
[2566.32 - 2571.06] got really upset with the alien podcast
[2568.18 - 2573.06] and I could only just say that
[2571.06 - 2573.06] um
[2573.46 - 2578.92] that alien podcast
[2576.34 - 2581.38] is the first of many I'm just not gonna
[2578.92 - 2583.18] come out with the next one yet
[2581.38 - 2586.72] I am going to come out with another
[2583.18 - 2588.22] alien podcast episode I'm just but but I
[2586.72 - 2589.60] should have not said anything because
[2588.22 - 2592.84] it's not going to be for quite a while
[2589.60 - 2594.70] we have a lot of brain episodes I have
[2592.84 - 2597.48] to do so
[2594.70 - 2597.48] all right
[2598.24 - 2603.10] whey protein powder it feeds everything
[2600.82 - 2605.08] bad accelerating symptoms and conditions
[2603.10 - 2606.94] whey protein powder is inflammatory
[2605.08 - 2609.10] because it fuels pathogens that create
[2606.94 - 2610.96] inflammation so you go to the doctor and
[2609.10 - 2612.52] you're like at the you're at the
[2610.96 - 2614.32] functional medicine doctor specialist
[2612.52 - 2616.30] and he's like your inflammatory markers
[2614.32 - 2618.82] are up we don't know what you got lime
[2616.30 - 2620.62] or what or gene mutation we don't know
[2618.82 - 2621.88] what's going on but your inflammatory
[2620.62 - 2625.06] markers are up we don't know if you have
[2621.88 - 2626.92] ra or lupus or whatever you got
[2625.06 - 2629.68] make sure you take your whey protein
[2626.92 - 2631.66] powder the whey protein powder will up
[2629.68 - 2633.58] the inflammation because it's feeding
[2631.66 - 2635.14] pathogens that the functional medicine
[2633.58 - 2637.78] doctor doesn't even know that exists in
[2635.14 - 2639.40] your system whey protein is not a useful
[2637.78 - 2641.32] source of protein because it doesn't
[2639.40 - 2642.64] break down inside our stomachs in small
[2641.32 - 2644.38] intestinal tracts Who would know that
[2642.64 - 2647.98] Spirit of compassion
[2644.38 - 2650.44] naturally human produced hydrochloric
[2647.98 - 2652.36] acid does not dismantle the Whey Protein
[2650.44 - 2653.98] sore bodies can't utilize it so when you
[2652.36 - 2655.54] put whey protein powder in you guess
[2653.98 - 2659.08] what it rots
[2655.54 - 2661.78] whey protein rots in your gut your HCL
[2659.08 - 2664.00] can't break it down it can't do anything
[2661.78 - 2665.56] about it so when you do whey protein
[2664.00 - 2668.26] powder just so you know I hope this
[2665.56 - 2670.84] doesn't all fall apart on me right here
[2668.26 - 2673.66] if you do whey protein powder
[2670.84 - 2674.86] your hydrochloric acid your stomach
[2673.66 - 2676.96] lands
[2674.86 - 2681.12] you're not going to be able to break it
[2676.96 - 2681.12] down it can't be utilized or taken apart
[2682.24 - 2685.72] let's talk about the brain shot therapy
[2683.92 - 2688.00] a little bit you guys
[2685.72 - 2691.54] if anybody on here is
[2688.00 - 2693.40] breezing through and you see these books
[2691.54 - 2695.08] just know
[2693.40 - 2696.46] when you read them you'll know they're
[2695.08 - 2698.86] the greatest books of all time Natural
[2696.46 - 2700.90] Health and any health book you ever go
[2698.86 - 2703.48] to that's not MediCal medium but you
[2700.90 - 2704.26] ever go to after that will never touch
[2703.48 - 2705.88] it
[2704.26 - 2708.76] there won't be there isn't a health book
[2705.88 - 2710.56] out there they eat better doctors
[2708.76 - 2713.50] that put out books
[2710.56 - 2715.72] nothing can touch these books I could
[2713.50 - 2718.24] say it with confidence maybe I need the
[2715.72 - 2720.16] ego shifter maybe my ego got out of
[2718.24 - 2722.44] control and my ego's all big now and I
[2720.16 - 2724.96] need the ego shifter in the books
[2722.44 - 2726.94] but the point is
[2724.96 - 2728.80] is that they're that good and I can
[2726.94 - 2730.48] judge them because the information comes
[2728.80 - 2732.22] from above so I have every right to make
[2730.48 - 2734.08] a judgment call myself my judgment call
[2732.22 - 2736.18] is they're the greatest books of all
[2734.08 - 2737.74] time for for the for chronic illness for
[2736.18 - 2740.08] the future of neurological problems and
[2737.74 - 2742.12] brain issues all of the above and what
[2740.08 - 2744.58] you'll notice is once you're in here you
[2742.12 - 2745.78] can't go back to the others like not
[2744.58 - 2747.40] MediCal meeting books those you can
[2745.78 - 2749.92] always go to cleanse the heel is epic
[2747.40 - 2752.08] but the point is and has healed so many
[2749.92 - 2754.54] people but the point is is when you go
[2752.08 - 2756.94] back to other health books that come out
[2754.54 - 2758.74] other diet books or health books and
[2756.94 - 2761.56] things like that and you go to that and
[2758.74 - 2763.72] then you go to here or you go to here
[2761.56 - 2767.08] into that and then you'll know
[2763.72 - 2768.64] what you have here you'll know creative
[2767.08 - 2770.50] heart says these are the best yet
[2768.64 - 2774.16] without a doubt
[2770.50 - 2776.26] honored honored honored

[3671.22 - 3677.58] and they're spreading information that's
[3675.42 - 3679.08] trying to destroy my credibility I mean
[3677.58 - 3681.96] they're not probably doing it on purpose
[3679.08 - 3685.74] but they're just so they're so hurt by
[3681.96 - 3688.62] The Imposter that they're then trying to
[3685.74 - 3690.42] warn others that that medical medium
[3688.62 - 3692.78] Anthony William guy that Anthony William
[3690.42 - 3696.12] Guy is a bad guy
[3692.78 - 3697.98] so I didn't do any of that that the
[3696.12 - 3700.44] imposters are doing like doing
[3697.98 - 3702.54] consultations taking people's money or
[3700.44 - 3703.86] saying terrible things to them or
[3702.54 - 3706.20] whatever they're doing
[3703.86 - 3708.42] I do not do consultation so if anyone is
[3706.20 - 3713.18] saying they emailed or anything else
[3708.42 - 3713.18] with me it wasn't me it was an imposter
[3718.92 - 3722.16] been working really hard because I'm
[3720.42 - 3723.30] trying to get a podcast episode done for
[3722.16 - 3725.16] you guys and I'm doing all kinds of
[3723.30 - 3727.38] stuff and I think I had it five minutes
[3725.16 - 3728.64] of sleep last night am I
[3727.38 - 3730.20] hang it in there
[3728.64 - 3732.06] please let others know about the
[3730.20 - 3733.62] Imposter
[3732.06 - 3735.60] you know what I love about these lives
[3733.62 - 3737.76] it's like this personal connection you
[3735.60 - 3739.08] guys like it's like we're really just
[3737.76 - 3740.52] Heart to Heart talking about all this
[3739.08 - 3743.58] great stuff oh yeah
[3740.52 - 3745.50] reviews can you leave some reviews
[3743.58 - 3746.88] I mean if you like the books if you like
[3745.50 - 3748.92] the brain saver books or you just like
[3746.88 - 3752.46] what they look like or you like the
[3748.92 - 3754.44] cover or you like the topic brain Savor
[3752.46 - 3756.42] you know the protocols whatever it is
[3754.44 - 3758.70] leave some reviews on Amazon if you can
[3756.42 - 3760.80] or Barnes and Nobles or whatever you got
[3758.70 - 3762.90] the book if you can that would be
[3760.80 - 3764.28] amazing or if you just bought the book
[3762.90 - 3765.06] and you want to go to Amazon and leave a
[3764.28 - 3766.86] review
[3765.06 - 3770.42] and I want to show you how you can clean
[3766.86 - 3770.42] the books one more thing
[3771.18 - 3775.86] so
[3772.62 - 3777.66] at Amazon when you order a book and it
[3775.86 - 3779.10] could be other other
[3777.66 - 3781.20] um places too
[3779.10 - 3783.90] when you order a book they have conveyor
[3781.20 - 3785.88] belts so anytime you place an order your
[3783.90 - 3787.50] order goes on a conveyor belt so what
[3785.88 - 3788.64] happens is somebody takes a book off the
[3787.50 - 3790.80] shelf
[3788.64 - 3792.66] they got an order take the book off the
[3790.80 - 3794.16] shelf medical medium someone just
[3792.66 - 3796.20] ordered the medical mean book throw it
[3794.16 - 3798.84] on the conveyor belt
[3796.20 - 3801.18] the conveyor belt's got grease on it by
[3798.84 - 3805.08] the time the book heads down the
[3801.18 - 3807.54] conveyor belt the book can be just
[3805.08 - 3809.40] greasy everywhere
[3807.54 - 3813.42] you open it up
[3809.40 - 3815.76] aw gave me a used book how dare he
[3813.42 - 3818.34] why would he do this if your book is
[3815.76 - 3821.46] tattered or injured or destroyed
[3818.34 - 3823.14] just tell Amazon and get a replacement
[3821.46 - 3825.84] the other thing is
[3823.14 - 3827.76] if it's just dirty and you want to do
[3825.84 - 3830.64] something about you can clean it just
[3827.76 - 3832.02] get a little bit of water
[3830.64 - 3834.30] right here
[3832.02 - 3836.46] put a little bit of dish soap on top too
[3834.30 - 3837.18] a little bit of dish soap right here we
[3836.46 - 3839.88] go
[3837.18 - 3842.52] and then you can give your cover a nice
[3839.88 - 3844.74] clean and get that grease off you can
[3842.52 - 3845.94] even use a handy wipe let's see if I
[3844.74 - 3847.44] have one
[3845.94 - 3851.64] I don't think I have one right here but
[3847.44 - 3853.80] that's okay you can use a handy wipe
[3851.64 - 3855.96] and clean it up
[3853.80 - 3857.82] come out nice and clean you'll be so
[3855.96 - 3859.86] happy
[3857.82 - 3862.50] educating myself says the reviews need
[3859.86 - 3863.34] 10 stars and they don't have 10 Stars
[3862.50 - 3865.32] though
[3863.34 - 3867.48] I am honored
[3865.32 - 3870.06] Lorena late to the party but I'll catch
[3867.48 - 3871.92] up were you always late to school
[3870.06 - 3874.44] just kidding
[3871.92 - 3877.26] I was
[3874.44 - 3879.60] I was always late
[3877.26 - 3882.18] and I never went to college I don't have
[3879.60 - 3885.06] not college educated
[3882.18 - 3887.52] Steph Cohn says stop making so much
[3885.06 - 3890.28] sense I'll try I'll try not to make so
[3887.52 - 3892.86] much sense I will try to
[3890.28 - 3895.74] I'll try to scramble my brain up and try
[3892.86 - 3899.00] not to make so much sense
[3895.74 - 3899.00] I was always late
[3899.16 - 3904.44] medical medium info makes so much sense
[3901.50 - 3906.48] but it's not common sense
[3904.44 - 3908.52] medical medium information is not common
[3906.48 - 3910.32] sense because it's not common it's all
[3908.52 - 3912.00] unique original comes from above nobody
[3910.32 - 3913.68] ever knew it in the health field of any
[3912.00 - 3916.08] health field there ever was it's all
[3913.68 - 3918.36] original it's all published original
[3916.08 - 3920.28] and it's stolen and pull poached but
[3918.36 - 3922.98] medical meme information is not common
[3920.28 - 3925.94] sense it makes sense
[3922.98 - 3925.94] it makes sense
[3928.26 - 3932.70] it's intricate information detailed and
[3930.30 - 3934.98] comprehensive and has street cred it's
[3932.70 - 3937.02] got street cred you guys
[3934.98 - 3939.24] more people healing from the medical
[3937.02 - 3940.80] medium books and I'm proud to say the
[3939.24 - 3944.10] number one medical meaning the number
[3940.80 - 3947.16] one health book series in the world for
[3944.10 - 3951.42] eight years running now
[3947.16 - 3953.22] I will place my dummy Stomach back in
[3951.42 - 3955.14] we can talk about all kinds of stuff
[3953.22 - 3957.96] stomachs everything else hopefully it's
[3955.14 - 3959.94] gut stay in right there no don't fall
[3957.96 - 3961.80] out
[3959.94 - 3964.20] I'm just in a good mood to you guys
[3961.80 - 3966.30] because the reason why is because this
[3964.20 - 3969.02] marks a time in history
[3966.30 - 3971.94] and
[3969.02 - 3973.50] you know maybe a big part of the world
[3971.94 - 3975.78] will never know about it
[3973.50 - 3977.10] and that's okay it's not okay because I
[3975.78 - 3978.66] want people who are suffering to heal
[3977.10 - 3981.12] but
[3978.66 - 3983.04] I gotta live with it if however it's
[3981.12 - 3984.84] going to be
[3983.04 - 3988.58] but I'll tell you this is that this
[3984.84 - 3988.58] marks a very special moment in history
[3989.34 - 3994.68] and can I just say
[3992.16 - 3997.82] authors don't put out two massive books
[3994.68 - 3997.82] on the same day
[3998.34 - 4004.34] my publisher said uh
[4002.00 - 4007.34] uh he might be the first
[4004.34 - 4009.56] who's crazy enough to have two
[4007.34 - 4012.62] release on the same day
[4009.56 - 4014.30] well Spirit has that much information so
[4012.62 - 4018.22] there was nothing
[4014.30 - 4018.22] we can do we had to do it
[4018.26 - 4023.24] you guys
[4019.76 - 4025.16] appreciate you to you guys I really do
[4023.24 - 4027.58] Jackie B says you're the only one who
[4025.16 - 4027.58] makes sense
[4029.90 - 4034.52] can you tell Dr Nesbitt that because I
[4032.42 - 4036.50] swear he thinks I don't make a lick a
[4034.52 - 4039.68] sense and
[4036.50 - 4041.66] he said I have to go to school someday I
[4039.68 - 4043.82] have to go to college someday he wants
[4041.66 - 4047.00] me to go to a university and get college
[4043.82 - 4048.58] educated I told him that I'm not a smart
[4047.00 - 4052.16] guy
[4048.58 - 4056.98] and I'm just a good listener and I hear
[4052.16 - 4056.98] the words and I write them down
[4057.86 - 4061.28] it's not an easy process but I'm just
[4059.96 - 4064.40] glad you guys
[4061.28 - 4066.50] got the legendary books I'm calling them
[4064.40 - 4068.18] legendary because I know
