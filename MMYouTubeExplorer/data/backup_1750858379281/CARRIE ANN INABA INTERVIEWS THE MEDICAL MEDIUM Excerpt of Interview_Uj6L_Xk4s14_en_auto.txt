[0.08 - 4.32] you said that you're hoping that the
[2.00 - 5.92] work you do will help bridge the gap
[4.32 - 8.72] between the sick
[5.92 - 10.64] and the not so sick yeah because
[8.72 - 12.64] yeah what happens is you have the not so
[10.64 - 14.24] sick the not so sick of people that are
[12.64 - 15.92] still living their lives
[14.24 - 17.52] they're living their lives nothing
[15.92 - 19.36] stopping them from living their lives
[17.52 - 21.76] they might have a little bit of acne
[19.36 - 24.24] they might have a little bit of bloating
[21.76 - 25.12] maybe a little fatigue periodically okay
[24.24 - 27.68] maybe
[25.12 - 29.92] a little bit of that maybe um
[27.68 - 31.52] maybe some brain fog that's come that's
[29.92 - 32.72] intermittent right
[31.52 - 35.20] and then
[32.72 - 37.36] you got someone who
[35.20 - 39.04] they could barely get into a shower when
[37.36 - 40.08] water hits them and almost knocks them
[39.04 - 41.76] over
[40.08 - 43.68] they need help with somebody making
[41.76 - 45.52] their food they can't take a walk
[43.68 - 47.60] outside for more than 10 minutes or five
[45.52 - 49.28] minutes they can't sit in the sun it'll
[47.60 - 50.88] knock them out they'll be sick for three
[49.28 - 52.88] days
[50.88 - 54.88] you've been there right been there yeah
[52.88 - 56.64] i know and and so there's there's the
[54.88 - 58.56] not so sick and this
[56.64 - 60.72] and the sick right so sick and what
[58.56 - 63.04] happens is there's a confusion between
[60.72 - 65.60] them both because the not so sick
[63.04 - 68.00] haven't been inconvenienced enough
[65.60 - 68.88] to know what the really sick are going
[68.00 - 70.40] through
[68.88 - 72.48] and so what i'm trying to do is i'm
[70.40 - 75.44] trying to bridge this great divide can
[72.48 - 77.28] you explain a little bit of what you do
[75.44 - 78.96] as the medical medium
[77.28 - 80.64] sure i started out when i was young
[78.96 - 82.88] right at age four
[80.64 - 86.48] and i heard a voice
[82.88 - 87.36] and that voice gave me information
[86.48 - 88.40] about
[87.36 - 90.88] others
[88.40 - 94.08] meaning what they were feeling a house
[90.88 - 94.96] if they were sick if something was wrong
[94.08 - 97.92] and then
[94.96 - 98.96] beyond that gave me information
[97.92 - 100.56] on
[98.96 - 103.76] advanced
[100.56 - 104.80] advanced stuff about you know viruses
[103.76 - 108.80] and
[104.80 - 111.20] bacteria and toxic heavy metals and the
[108.80 - 113.04] nervous system and vagus nerves the
[111.20 - 114.56] voice was teaching me
[113.04 - 116.64] teaching me
[114.56 - 120.48] how to pronounce things how to say
[116.64 - 121.60] things how to identify them in people
[120.48 - 123.60] how to
[121.60 - 127.84] understand the information
[123.60 - 130.80] and it led to a life of where i am now
[127.84 - 133.36] where i put the information in the books
[130.80 - 135.92] so people with chronic illness
[133.36 - 138.56] can have a chance to heal when we talked
[135.92 - 139.76] um about this stuff specifically last
[138.56 - 141.36] year when i was going through my
[139.76 - 142.72] troubles and i asked you to just kind of
[141.36 - 144.96] help me out again
[142.72 - 146.40] you checked in what did you tell
[144.96 - 148.24] everybody what you what you noticed
[146.40 - 152.16] because i i remember you told me celery
[148.24 - 154.24] juice and to um do the heavy metal detox
[152.16 - 158.00] and then you also said to eat a lot of
[154.24 - 159.68] potatoes yeah i was trying to put you on
[158.00 - 162.96] an antiviral
[159.68 - 166.08] you know diet keeping foods out that
[162.96 - 168.96] feed bugs that feed viruses because
[166.08 - 171.04] fibromyalgia is epstein-barr that's what
[168.96 - 172.64] creates fibromyalgia so what happens is
[171.04 - 175.12] you can go to a fibro doctor they'll be
[172.64 - 176.72] like you got fibro you can go to a then
[175.12 - 178.24] walk into a lyme doctor's doctor's
[176.72 - 180.40] office and they'll just be a lyme doctor
[178.24 - 183.04] and they'll be like you got lyme disease
[180.40 - 185.68] i can go into you know a lupus doctor
[183.04 - 187.84] like you got lupus yes it's exhausting
[185.68 - 189.36] but those three are epstein-barr let's
[187.84 - 191.84] get a little bit into the celery juice
[189.36 - 194.48] exactly like what are the
[191.84 - 196.16] exact the benefits besides what i feel
[194.48 - 198.16] which i want to say is i feel
[196.16 - 200.64] clear-headed every time i drink celery
[198.16 - 202.88] juice you know the cool thing about it
[200.64 - 205.76] it's a neutralizer it's neutralizing
[202.88 - 207.68] acids then it's neutralizing toxins then
[205.76 - 209.76] it's diffusing and neutralizing metals
[207.68 - 212.32] it doesn't pull metals out but it it
[209.76 - 214.96] diffuses it neutralizes their damaging
[212.32 - 216.48] effects and then it neutralizes other
[214.96 - 218.80] things too like chemicals like the
[216.48 - 220.88] fragrances and the air fresheners that
[218.80 - 222.72] get in us and all that other junk that's
[220.88 - 224.16] getting the chemicals that are there
[222.72 - 225.68] that are we're breathing in every day
[224.16 - 227.12] it's helping to neutralize all that
[225.68 - 229.52] right the other thing it's doing it's
[227.12 - 232.00] restoring the hcl and the stomach glands
[229.52 - 235.04] which helps you have strong hcl and the
[232.00 - 236.80] strong hcl kills pathogens
[235.04 - 239.28] and that's like your that's like your
[236.80 - 240.72] bug killer what um is your favorite
[239.28 - 241.92] podcast or what was the one that you're
