[62.96 - 66.80] to talk about the sodium cluster salts
[65.20 - 69.20] i'm going to talk what about what
[66.80 - 71.20] happens when you're eating
[69.20 - 72.56] all of your pork all these years you had
[71.20 - 75.36] pork 10 years ago
[72.56 - 76.96] it's still inside of you it's still
[75.36 - 80.24] inside of you
[76.96 - 82.48] it is it hasn't left right
[80.24 - 84.00] you carry it around inside of you even
[82.48 - 85.76] if you're in shape or you think you're
[84.00 - 86.08] in shape you're working out you've got
[85.76 - 89.52] some
[86.08 - 91.28] abs you still got the pork inside of you
[89.52 - 93.36] and it doesn't come out celery just
[91.28 - 94.64] helps get the old pork all that old
[93.36 - 97.68] bacon fat
[94.64 - 100.08] and bacon grease out of you and that's
[97.68 - 101.04] one thing celery juice helps us do is it
[100.08 - 103.28] gets gets that
[101.04 - 104.16] bacon fat out of us where's the bacon
[103.28 - 107.12] fat sit
[104.16 - 107.76] sits inside the liver you can be you can
[107.12 - 109.68] be some
[107.76 - 112.16] some dude you could be in the gym you
[109.68 - 114.80] got some abs you're working out
[112.16 - 115.60] you still got the bacon fat inside of
[114.80 - 118.80] you
[115.60 - 120.64] and it sits there it sits on the inside
[118.80 - 122.48] lining of the intestinal tract inside
[120.64 - 124.56] the lining of the colon that's where it
[122.48 - 127.04] sits
[124.56 - 128.24] and it just breaks our system down i've
[127.04 - 130.32] seen a lot of people
[128.24 - 131.84] fall apart when they start getting older
[130.32 - 133.68] just they could be
[131.84 - 135.12] going good going good going good and
[133.68 - 136.88] they just start breaking down and
[135.12 - 138.32] falling apart and everything just starts
[136.88 - 141.04] to fall apart
[138.32 - 142.24] and then you know where are we there you

[198.64 - 202.00] i'm going to show you how it works we're
[199.84 - 204.96] squeezing out every last drop of juice
[202.00 - 206.40] out of the celery where the pulp is dry
[204.96 - 208.88] but we're talking about look we're going
[206.40 - 211.12] to um we're going to talk about the
[208.88 - 213.20] power of celery what it does for us how
[211.12 - 215.84] you cannot underestimate it how people
[213.20 - 217.92] drink it when they get off of it it
[215.84 - 218.24] their symptoms start to come back or
[217.92 - 220.00] they
[218.24 - 221.68] feel it they're like wait a minute i
[220.00 - 222.96] feel something because that's how much
[221.68 - 226.48] it's doing for us
[222.96 - 228.80] right and and don't get confused
[226.48 - 230.08] why like who's doing celery juice well
[228.80 - 231.92] everybody is because they keep on
[230.08 - 232.48] building more farms more farms more
[231.92 - 235.60] farms
[232.48 - 237.84] thousands of celery farms right
[235.60 - 238.96] but everybody keeps the hush hush quiet
[237.84 - 240.72] quiet you guys
[238.96 - 242.72] quiet don't want to tell anybody i'm
[240.72 - 244.24] drinking it don't want influencers don't
[242.72 - 245.28] want to tell anybody they're drinking it
[244.24 - 247.60] anymore
[245.28 - 250.32] uh audrey says it's amazing best
[247.60 - 251.92] purchase in years this juicer right
[250.32 - 253.60] it really is it i'll tell you what the
[251.92 - 254.24] juicer has done for me if you guys want
[253.60 - 256.56] to know
[254.24 - 257.76] all right so what would i let me just
[256.56 - 259.84] give you some history okay
[257.76 - 261.60] i've tried all the juicers out there all
[259.84 - 264.48] the cold-pressed juicers out there
[261.60 - 264.88] all right um nicole says so this juicer
[264.48 - 267.52] does
[264.88 - 269.60] juice other items yes it does not just
[267.52 - 271.28] celery yes it juices other items
[269.60 - 272.80] and what i find is to juice other items
[271.28 - 274.64] better because
[272.80 - 276.24] it has the ability to squeeze every last
[274.64 - 277.44] drop out of them and that's what i love
[276.24 - 280.32] about the juicer
[277.44 - 281.36] um this this model is made specifically
[280.32 - 283.76] for celery
[281.36 - 285.44] and you can use it for anything what i
[283.76 - 286.64] find is i use it for everything and i'm
[285.44 - 289.12] happier with that
[286.64 - 290.80] than other juicers i've tried all the
[289.12 - 291.60] all the juicers out there i'm just
[290.80 - 293.20] letting you know
[291.60 - 294.64] and i'll tell you a little history about
[293.20 - 296.08] it okay
[294.64 - 297.76] and you guys could get any juicer you
[296.08 - 298.32] want look you guys can use any juicer
[297.76 - 299.92] you want
[298.32 - 301.76] it's just that everybody's always asking
[299.92 - 303.36] me and i hold it off for a while and i
[301.76 - 304.64] hold it on for a while i hold it up for
[303.36 - 305.92] a while and then it finally just like
[304.64 - 306.64] all right all right this is the one i
[305.92 - 309.92] use
[306.64 - 310.72] and but like a little history about it
[309.92 - 313.04] for me right
[310.72 - 314.88] tried every juicer i don't care what
[313.04 - 316.96] juicer somebody throws out at me like
[314.88 - 318.56] did you do this one did you do that one
[316.96 - 320.40] did you do this one i tried them all
[318.56 - 323.44] okay and they
[320.40 - 324.08] haven't saved me money i buy a lot of
[323.44 - 327.84] celery
[324.08 - 331.28] like i buy a lot of celery you know and
[327.84 - 334.24] i got a lot of celery right here and
[331.28 - 335.92] you know it costs money absolutely but
[334.24 - 338.96] when you squeeze
[335.92 - 342.48] that juice out of your celery
[338.96 - 344.80] like squeeze more of it out of it
[342.48 - 346.08] you're saving money so then when i got
[344.80 - 348.88] this juicer
[346.08 - 350.88] i was buying less less celery than
[348.88 - 352.80] buying less celery than buying less
[350.88 - 354.48] but wait a minute i was still drinking
[352.80 - 356.24] the same amount of juice
[354.48 - 358.48] and so i was seeing where it was saving
[356.24 - 360.64] me money so then what this juicer did
[358.48 - 363.28] which the other juicers never did for me
[360.64 - 365.76] is this juicer paid for itself you guys
[363.28 - 367.76] on clubhouse it paid for itself
[365.76 - 370.24] that's what it did and i'm like wait a
[367.76 - 372.72] minute so this juicer paid for itself
[370.24 - 373.76] and then paid for itself again and then
[372.72 - 377.12] i noticed
[373.76 - 380.56] it paid for itself again okay
[377.12 - 381.44] now as i as i calculated that it was
[380.56 - 384.24] really awesome
[381.44 - 385.28] nazil says it was a life changer when i
[384.24 - 388.48] switched to this
[385.28 - 390.32] juicer the mm-900 hds and
[388.48 - 392.56] don't get it confused with other ones i
[390.32 - 395.20] used to get two cups of celery juice
[392.56 - 396.08] out of two bags of celery now from one
[395.20 - 399.76] bag
[396.08 - 402.72] i make two cups of cj and you guys
[399.76 - 404.56] that's that's for real that's what i've
[402.72 - 405.68] been trying to tell everybody about like
[404.56 - 407.28] all the time
[405.68 - 408.96] that's what i'm like i tell my friends
[407.28 - 410.08] that well what's the difference between
[408.96 - 410.96] this juicer i'm like what are you
[410.08 - 413.76] kidding
[410.96 - 416.08] um hazel said i started with a different
[413.76 - 418.40] juicer and it soaked me dry with
[416.08 - 421.28] money and not enough juice i love the
[418.40 - 421.76] omega juicer the mm-900 gives me more
[421.28 - 424.16] juice
[421.76 - 425.20] and it pays for itself it pays for
[424.16 - 427.28] itself
[425.20 - 429.60] so check this out right now having a
[427.28 - 430.96] juicer pay for itself is one thing
[429.60 - 432.80] right and that's what this juicer did
[430.96 - 435.92] when no other juicer did that for me
[432.80 - 438.00] but it paid for itself again right and
[435.92 - 439.68] then it paid for itself again
[438.00 - 441.52] and then again because i did the
[439.68 - 442.48] calculations for how much money i spent
[441.52 - 445.76] on celery
[442.48 - 448.80] it turned out that the m m 900
[445.76 - 450.00] paid for itself a dozen times for me
[448.80 - 451.76] so it's like wait a minute just got
[450.00 - 452.32] another juicer well just got another
[451.76 - 454.32] juicer
[452.32 - 455.92] wait it paid for itself again it paid
[454.32 - 457.84] for itself again
[455.92 - 459.28] and i i couldn't believe it so i'm just
[457.84 - 462.48] letting you know how it works for me
[459.28 - 465.12] and i'm excited about it um so it's the

[530.08 - 533.36] what what it needs to do for you and i'm
[532.24 - 534.80] going to give you a rundown on how that
[533.36 - 537.44] works
[534.80 - 539.60] mc good to see you emcee on youtube
[537.44 - 539.60] right
[539.68 - 545.68] um mc says keep the juice raw
[544.16 - 547.28] yeah you of course you want to keep it
[545.68 - 548.48] raw you don't want to cook your celery
[547.28 - 552.40] juice
[548.48 - 554.80] um good to see you guys coming on
[552.40 - 554.80] everybody
[555.84 - 559.20] you guys there's some you you might get
[557.84 - 560.56] build up but you get filled up with
[559.20 - 562.64] every single juicer
[560.56 - 564.56] so you get build up from your fruits and
[562.64 - 566.96] vegetables you're juicing
[564.56 - 568.56] you get build up i use a little bonnie
[566.96 - 570.24] and amy that's what i do put a little
[568.56 - 571.60] bonnie on me on the sponge
[570.24 - 573.92] i said yeah i got right underneath my
[571.60 - 577.28] sink right here and i i get that
[573.92 - 580.16] i get that build up owl is what i do
[577.28 - 581.92] so i'm doing a little juicing right now
[580.16 - 584.32] obviously let's run some celery sticks
[581.92 - 584.32] through here
[585.52 - 591.36] um can you juice the leaves can you
[589.52 - 592.96] juice without the leaves they make it
[591.36 - 593.92] taste horrible of course you can cut the
[592.96 - 595.36] leaves off
[593.92 - 597.20] there's nothing wrong with cutting the
[595.36 - 599.28] leaves back
[597.20 - 605.20] uh that's fine you could cut them back
[599.28 - 606.64] as much as you want you guys
[605.20 - 609.04] i'm just reading your comments can you
[606.64 - 610.56] add a little ice susan says can you add
[609.04 - 613.84] a little ice
[610.56 - 616.24] no you can't you can't add ice
[613.84 - 617.52] you can't add water you can't add
[616.24 - 621.36] supplements
[617.52 - 624.00] you can't add you know
[621.36 - 624.40] anything because if you add something to
[624.00 - 627.76] it
[624.40 - 629.52] you dilute the sodium cluster sauce
[627.76 - 630.96] sodium cluster salt i'm going to show
[629.52 - 632.56] you guys a little bit about really quick
[630.96 - 634.32] okay i'm just gonna shut this down for a
[632.56 - 637.68] second right
[634.32 - 641.76] so here's how it works okay
[637.68 - 643.44] let's get this off here this cap um
[641.76 - 645.44] you guys see this right here all right
[643.44 - 647.76] i'm holding up a white board right here
[645.44 - 649.84] okay sodium cluster salts okay
[647.76 - 651.92] that's your macro sodium right there
[649.84 - 653.68] okay that's in celery
[651.92 - 656.24] that's your macro that's your macro
[653.68 - 658.48] sodium you're looking at it right there
[656.24 - 659.28] okay now here's the difference with
[658.48 - 661.68] celery
[659.28 - 662.96] this is why people heal all around the
[661.68 - 663.60] world i'm going to give you guys a
[662.96 - 666.56] rundown
[663.60 - 668.48] okay it's not what science research says
[666.56 - 670.40] where oh there's sodium there's this
[668.48 - 672.80] much sodium in celery
[670.40 - 673.60] we calculated how much sodium is in
[672.80 - 676.40] celery
[673.60 - 677.12] okay that's what they say right there's
[676.40 - 680.32] sodium
[677.12 - 681.60] you know yeah true right what no one
[680.32 - 684.32] understands
[681.60 - 685.68] okay is that there's a subgroup of
[684.32 - 687.52] sodium in celery
[685.68 - 689.52] how come it's not discovered yet why
[687.52 - 691.52] should they discover it
[689.52 - 692.56] first of all the industries want us sick
[691.52 - 694.00] they want us dying
[692.56 - 695.44] they want us buying drugs right they
[694.00 - 696.32] want us buying pharmaceuticals they want
[695.44 - 698.64] us buying
[696.32 - 700.24] you know medications right they want to
[698.64 - 701.92] keep us sick right the industry does
[700.24 - 702.32] because if you get better then everybody
[701.92 - 703.68] go
[702.32 - 705.36] in the industries they lose all their
[703.68 - 708.16] money okay so
[705.36 - 708.88] who's going to pay 50 million dollars
[708.16 - 710.32] 100 million
[708.88 - 711.52] who's going to pay 200 million dollars
[710.32 - 712.08] for a whole team of scientists to
[711.52 - 713.68] actually
[712.08 - 716.24] find the subgroup of sodium who's going
[713.68 - 718.64] to pay for that do you ask like
[716.24 - 721.12] think about that ask yourself who's
[718.64 - 723.60] gonna come up with 200 million dollars
[721.12 - 725.92] put a team together just so they can
[723.60 - 728.32] prove anthony william right
[725.92 - 730.32] and then more people around the world
[728.32 - 732.88] heal does that make sense to you
[730.32 - 733.60] is that doesn't make any sense so here
[732.88 - 736.08] it goes okay
[733.60 - 738.48] the macro that's the macro sodium inside
[736.08 - 742.24] celery so inside your sodium inside your
[738.48 - 744.40] celery stick okay and
[742.24 - 746.32] around it is like it's like a solar
[744.40 - 749.40] system around the sun
[746.32 - 752.72] right so when you
[749.40 - 755.92] dehydrate your celery into a powder
[752.72 - 757.44] you lose the solar system you guys you
[755.92 - 759.12] lost the subgroup of
[757.44 - 761.20] the sodium cluster salts the subgroup
[759.12 - 764.32] sodium you lost it
[761.20 - 765.76] bye-bye now it can't heal you now it
[764.32 - 769.04] can't help you
[765.76 - 770.32] right this gets suspended in a living
[769.04 - 773.44] solution
[770.32 - 776.96] that when you squeeze that celery
[773.44 - 780.80] stick you get the subgroup the sub
[776.96 - 782.80] um you get the subgroup of sodium
[780.80 - 783.84] which is that solar system around the
[782.80 - 786.40] macro
[783.84 - 788.24] sodium that's what you get these are
[786.40 - 791.20] trace minerals
[788.24 - 792.24] designed by planet earth by mother
[791.20 - 795.52] nature
[792.24 - 796.80] the miracle of mother nature these are
[795.52 - 800.32] trace minerals that are
[796.80 - 803.44] only bonded in a living solution
[800.32 - 806.64] around the macro sodium
[803.44 - 808.56] letting you know you add water to it you
[806.64 - 811.04] just disturbed and diluted it
[808.56 - 814.32] you add lemon to it you just dilute it
[811.04 - 815.84] that solar system that's around okay
[814.32 - 817.92] that's subgroup of sodium that's around
[815.84 - 818.72] the sodium the macro sodium you just
[817.92 - 820.56] disturbed it
[818.72 - 822.72] you add another vegetable in there
[820.56 - 824.24] another fruit you destroyed it
[822.72 - 825.60] it doesn't mean you can't eat celery it
[824.24 - 827.52] doesn't mean you can't have celery in a
[825.60 - 828.40] juice you can put celery in a juice with
[827.52 - 830.88] other things
[828.40 - 831.44] it's still good for you but you won't be
[830.88 - 835.28] able to
[831.44 - 837.60] access that miracle that subgroup
[835.28 - 839.84] of sodium you won't be able to access
[837.60 - 841.52] the sodium cluster salts
[839.84 - 843.28] which is the trace minerals that are
[841.52 - 846.32] designed specifically
[843.28 - 848.88] to be swimming around in a circle like a
[846.32 - 851.60] solar system around the macro sodium
[848.88 - 853.20] you won't be able to actually have that
[851.60 - 856.00] you won't be eligible
[853.20 - 857.60] to heal through celery juice if you
[856.00 - 860.64] destroy that
[857.60 - 861.12] okay in science research they want to
[860.64 - 863.60] just they
[861.12 - 865.60] just want to keep everything dumbed down
[863.60 - 867.44] oh there's a little bit of this in there
[865.60 - 869.76] there's a little bit of potassium in
[867.44 - 872.40] celery there's a little bit of this oh
[869.76 - 875.44] a little touch of vitamin c but no one's
[872.40 - 879.36] going to take 200 million dollars
[875.44 - 881.04] assemble a massive group of scientists
[879.36 - 882.80] to start fishing for something they
[881.04 - 884.16] don't know is there and that's why it
[882.80 - 885.76] takes so much
[884.16 - 887.52] it just you can't just wake up one
[885.76 - 890.08] morning be a scientist and then
[887.52 - 891.20] look look into a scope and find
[890.08 - 893.20] something when you don't know where it
[891.20 - 897.20] is it takes decades for them to find
[893.20 - 899.12] simple things and no one's gonna do that
[897.20 - 900.40] and so because first of all because then
[899.12 - 902.40] it'll be like whoa
[900.40 - 903.68] celery actually can help you heal
[902.40 - 905.36] because it's already healing millions
[903.68 - 906.24] worldwide but everybody wants to ignore
[905.36 - 907.68] that
[906.24 - 909.12] the media doesn't care anymore it
[907.68 - 910.24] doesn't matter how many people get their
[909.12 - 912.96] lives back like get
[910.24 - 914.24] literally their lives back and people
[912.96 - 916.40] just ignore it right
[914.24 - 918.24] but it's that subgroup of sodium right
[916.40 - 920.00] there the sodium cluster salts
[918.24 - 921.76] these are the trace minerals that are
[920.00 - 924.96] bonded in a solution
[921.76 - 926.72] okay of living fluid it suspends them
[924.96 - 928.24] around that macro sodium that's how it
[926.72 - 930.24] works right there you guys
[928.24 - 932.56] um giving you kind of a little rundown
[930.24 - 932.56] on that
[934.48 - 937.84] how long does it take celery juice to
[936.00 - 942.08] help a chronic fatigue syndrome
[937.84 - 945.36] it's a healing tool right
[942.08 - 948.48] so it all depends learning about
[945.36 - 948.80] what your chronic fatigue is matters so
[948.48 - 952.80] you
[948.80 - 954.24] learn about what your cfs says right
[952.80 - 956.24] that's critical right there so i'm
[954.24 - 960.40] holding the medical meeting new edition
[956.24 - 961.76] which is the book of all books about cfs
[960.40 - 963.52] okay and
[961.76 - 965.92] [Music]
[963.52 - 966.56] when you learn what's causing it then
[965.92 - 969.44] you'll realize
[966.56 - 970.80] look i may have an epstein-barr virus dr
[969.44 - 972.72] faun good to see you md
[970.80 - 974.16] i may have an epstein-barr virus in me
[972.72 - 976.48] if i got cfs
[974.16 - 978.63] i may have two epstein-barr viruses in
[976.48 - 980.84] me if i have cfs you see how it works
[978.63 - 982.19] [Music]
[980.84 - 983.93] okay
[982.19 - 986.16] [Applause]
[983.93 - 989.20] [Music]
[986.16 - 991.20] so once you learn that you know why
[989.20 - 991.76] you're using celery juice you're using
[991.20 - 994.96] it
[991.76 - 996.96] to help destroy epstein-barr because it
[994.96 - 998.72] breaks down the membrane on the virus so
[996.96 - 1000.96] we're gonna go there and it also depends
[998.72 - 1003.36] what what else are you doing
[1000.96 - 1004.96] celery juice is one of the tools i've
[1003.36 - 1008.56] seen people get rid of fatigue
[1004.96 - 1009.76] with celery juice yeah i've also seen
[1008.56 - 1011.92] other people
[1009.76 - 1014.88] move the needle but they need to do
[1011.92 - 1014.88] other things too
[1015.12 - 1021.52] celery juice fixes some people like that
[1018.80 - 1022.56] you see it every day out there okay
[1021.52 - 1024.80] other people
[1022.56 - 1026.00] it's moving the needle to get them there
[1024.80 - 1028.80] to the finish line
[1026.00 - 1029.67] right so that's important to know how
[1028.80 - 1032.36] that works
[1029.67 - 1034.64] [Music]
[1032.36 - 1037.20] antivirals are important you may need
[1034.64 - 1039.76] additional anti-virals i talk about that
[1037.20 - 1042.96] in the medical medium new edition
[1039.76 - 1045.84] right so what what i here's how i look
[1042.96 - 1048.96] at a juicer
[1045.84 - 1052.96] i look at a juicer as a medical device
[1048.96 - 1056.80] that's how i see a juicer okay now
[1052.96 - 1060.16] i see it as a medical tool bottom line
[1056.80 - 1060.16] that's how i look at it
[1061.20 - 1070.56] every day
[1067.12 - 1073.36] because what is it what is a juicer
[1070.56 - 1075.60] why are you juicing the juicing for the
[1073.36 - 1079.20] fun of it
[1075.60 - 1081.28] right why bother juicing just eat pizza
[1079.20 - 1082.56] why bother juicing just eat cheese and
[1081.28 - 1085.52] pork
[1082.56 - 1087.84] just eat fried eggs every day why why
[1085.52 - 1091.12] bother juicing
[1087.84 - 1092.72] when you think about it um
[1091.12 - 1094.16] you're juicing because you're you're
[1092.72 - 1095.84] trying to save your butt or you're
[1094.16 - 1098.40] juicing to try to fix something or
[1095.84 - 1100.56] you're juicing to try to heal something
[1098.40 - 1101.92] it's like oh let me go out and buy a
[1100.56 - 1104.64] juicer
[1101.92 - 1106.56] just for the fun of it let me go spend
[1104.64 - 1108.32] the money buy a juicer i feel great
[1106.56 - 1108.96] living my life but let me get a juicer
[1108.32 - 1111.20] anyway
[1108.96 - 1112.48] right so when you guys think about it
[1111.20 - 1114.08] it's it's
[1112.48 - 1115.84] you know we're we're getting a juicer
[1114.08 - 1118.00] because something's wrong like
[1115.84 - 1119.12] we're not feeling good or we're trying
[1118.00 - 1120.88] to find an answer
[1119.12 - 1123.52] to healing or we're trying to improve
[1120.88 - 1126.48] our health because something's not right
[1123.52 - 1127.12] and so what is a juicer it's a medical
[1126.48 - 1128.96] tool
[1127.12 - 1130.40] that's what it is it's a health tool
[1128.96 - 1131.68] it's a medical tool i see it as a
[1130.40 - 1133.12] medical device
[1131.68 - 1134.72] if you guys just got on this is the
[1133.12 - 1136.32] mm-900 hds
[1134.72 - 1138.64] incredible sale i haven't seen a sale
[1136.32 - 1143.04] like this from omegajuicers.com
[1138.64 - 1146.24] it's 25 off 82
[1143.04 - 1148.80] off this juicer this is the
[1146.24 - 1150.08] celery model but it does everything else
[1148.80 - 1152.00] too that's what i love it was telling
[1150.08 - 1153.52] everybody earlier how it paid for itself
[1152.00 - 1154.88] over and over again it just didn't pay
[1153.52 - 1156.72] for itself once and someone else said
[1154.88 - 1159.84] that i think two people said that
[1156.72 - 1161.04] um i saw the in the comments and it just
[1159.84 - 1163.60] doesn't pay for itself
[1161.04 - 1165.68] once it's paid for itself a dozen times
[1163.60 - 1168.32] for me i buy so much celery
[1165.68 - 1169.92] and and it's just it's such a great it's
[1168.32 - 1171.52] such a great tool so i just did some
[1169.92 - 1172.96] juicing just now you guys let me just
[1171.52 - 1176.08] move this towel right here
[1172.96 - 1179.44] so in in this in this bowl here
[1176.08 - 1181.84] i have extremely audra says great juicer
[1179.44 - 1182.80] thank you i'm so glad you like it i feel
[1181.84 - 1185.52] the same way
[1182.80 - 1186.24] i have this thing a pulp in my hand
[1185.52 - 1189.36] right
[1186.24 - 1190.88] and i show this every time that pulp is
[1189.36 - 1194.40] dry
[1190.88 - 1196.72] it's dry i mean i've had the wettest
[1194.40 - 1197.92] pulp from all the other juicers spitting
[1196.72 - 1199.92] out wet pulp
[1197.92 - 1201.04] you name it i've seen it all out there
[1199.92 - 1204.40] right and
[1201.04 - 1205.20] this is nice and dry that's it this is a
[1204.40 - 1208.24] pulp
[1205.20 - 1209.52] and this is very fibrous celery i'm
[1208.24 - 1212.72] dealing with
[1209.52 - 1215.28] this is extremely fibrous so
[1212.72 - 1216.64] if it was another batch of celery there
[1215.28 - 1220.16] would probably be
[1216.64 - 1222.48] this much in there only right
[1220.16 - 1223.20] this is extremely fibrous celery so
[1222.48 - 1227.12] because some
[1223.20 - 1229.68] some celery um bunches batches
[1227.12 - 1230.24] it's just basically all fiber right so
[1229.68 - 1231.60] it takes
[1230.24 - 1233.36] it's you know it takes a lot to squeeze
[1231.60 - 1235.44] that juice out and that's what i love
[1233.36 - 1237.68] about the juicer it's all dry
[1235.44 - 1238.96] and that's where the money is at the
[1237.68 - 1240.80] money's at
[1238.96 - 1242.40] how dry the pulp is that's where the
[1240.80 - 1244.40] money's at cold white spring says
[1242.40 - 1245.76] i just got the juicer it's great so glad
[1244.40 - 1249.44] you got it
[1245.76 - 1251.60] incredible it's the mm900 hds
[1249.44 - 1253.84] uh john says that's really true it pays
[1251.60 - 1255.28] for itself totally worth so glad
[1253.84 - 1256.64] got that in the beginning and what i
[1255.28 - 1257.76] like about it's easy to clean the other
[1256.64 - 1259.44] thing to you guys
[1257.76 - 1260.72] is it's quiet i can juice at five
[1259.44 - 1263.36] o'clock in the morning i'm not waking up
[1260.72 - 1265.76] the house
[1263.36 - 1269.20] and falcon says how long is juice good
[1265.76 - 1272.00] for how long will that container last
[1269.20 - 1272.40] uh you and does it get degraded over
[1272.00 - 1274.24] days
[1272.40 - 1276.24] of course anything you know you juice
[1274.24 - 1277.68] you want to drink right away if you can
[1276.24 - 1281.04] you want to drink
[1277.68 - 1281.92] quickly if you can 24 hours is kind of
[1281.04 - 1283.52] the limit
[1281.92 - 1285.52] but yeah of course you can drink your
[1283.52 - 1285.84] celery juice in two days it'll still
[1285.52 - 1289.28] have
[1285.84 - 1292.40] power it'll still have its healing
[1289.28 - 1293.76] sodium cluster salts right it'll still
[1292.40 - 1297.68] have these but when you go
[1293.76 - 1300.96] too many days when you go too many days
[1297.68 - 1304.08] that subgroup of sodium right that's
[1300.96 - 1307.20] circulating the macro
[1304.08 - 1308.56] mineral sodium right that sub subgroup
[1307.20 - 1310.48] sodium of sodium
[1308.56 - 1312.16] that starts to weaken after a couple of
[1310.48 - 1313.76] days in the fridge so then your celery
[1312.16 - 1316.96] juice is getting kind of old
[1313.76 - 1320.88] which brings me to the next thing
[1316.96 - 1324.32] which is hpp hpp
[1320.88 - 1326.80] is not good for me remember those words
[1324.32 - 1328.48] that's basically the slogan it should be
[1326.80 - 1330.80] is hpp
[1328.48 - 1331.84] is not good for me and that's something
[1330.80 - 1334.08] that people need to know
[1331.84 - 1335.60] hpp is high pressure pasteurization so
[1334.08 - 1336.80] you walk into the store you think you're
[1335.60 - 1339.04] getting your celery juice
[1336.80 - 1339.92] you're getting it out of a that was
[1339.04 - 1342.24] bottled
[1339.92 - 1343.28] and that stuff is dead it'll they're
[1342.24 - 1346.48] allowed to say
[1343.28 - 1349.16] raw or fresh because
[1346.48 - 1350.64] they're using a non-heated
[1349.16 - 1353.20] pasteurization
[1350.64 - 1355.44] but still it destroys the sodium cluster
[1353.20 - 1357.36] salts it still denatures
[1355.44 - 1358.56] the very thing your celery juice is
[1357.36 - 1360.00] trying to help you with
[1358.56 - 1361.44] so you'll see somebody out there i tried
[1360.00 - 1362.64] celery juice it's not helping me i
[1361.44 - 1364.96] didn't find any
[1362.64 - 1367.28] i didn't find any way it helped me i
[1364.96 - 1369.60] tried some celery juice that didn't work
[1367.28 - 1371.04] it's like you've been drinking hpp off
[1369.60 - 1372.64] the shelf every day
[1371.04 - 1374.32] if you go to a juice bar and they juice
[1372.64 - 1374.80] it fresh in front of you that's the
[1374.32 - 1377.36] fresh
[1374.80 - 1379.04] juice that's the fresh juice you guys
[1377.36 - 1381.52] that's it right there
[1379.04 - 1382.48] and if you juice it at home like this
[1381.52 - 1385.52] that's the fresh
[1382.48 - 1388.72] juice keep that in mind hpp
[1385.52 - 1389.68] does not work you can't get the healing
[1388.72 - 1391.52] you need
[1389.68 - 1394.00] from the hpp high pressure
[1391.52 - 1396.16] pasteurization it's a trick out too
[1394.00 - 1397.60] total trick out going to the store it's
[1396.16 - 1399.60] in the cold section
[1397.60 - 1401.28] it's sitting there on the shelf you go
[1399.60 - 1403.20] and grab it you think you got something
[1401.28 - 1407.12] good you go buy it you're drinking it
[1403.20 - 1410.08] the stuff is already bad it's gone bad
[1407.12 - 1410.48] gone bad in the sense that not rance it
[1410.08 - 1413.52] but
[1410.48 - 1415.36] it's been changed it's not like you
[1413.52 - 1417.84] think it really is because that high
[1415.36 - 1421.52] pressure pasteurization is experimental
[1417.84 - 1423.36] and it collapses cell structures
[1421.52 - 1424.72] of the juice that's what high pressure
[1423.36 - 1428.08] pasteurization
[1424.72 - 1431.68] pasteurization does it collapses
[1428.08 - 1433.60] cell structures so what happens is
[1431.68 - 1434.88] celery juice is something that is so
[1433.60 - 1437.04] powerful inside the body
[1434.88 - 1439.12] helps us so much inside the body but
[1437.04 - 1440.80] it's got to be intact to do it and
[1439.12 - 1442.32] that's one of the keys right there
[1440.80 - 1444.80] so this is important now i'm gonna i'm
[1442.32 - 1448.32] gonna pop it in here real quick
[1444.80 - 1448.32] um do a little
[1448.56 - 1461.36] fill this glass jar so i got one celery
[1459.12 - 1463.60] juice right there
[1461.36 - 1465.44] which i'm excited about so you want to
[1463.60 - 1466.72] strain it you see how i got a strainer
[1465.44 - 1468.56] you guys
[1466.72 - 1470.72] yeah you can let this really sit and
[1468.56 - 1472.72] then completely drip out
[1470.72 - 1474.40] and then you can press it with a spoon
[1472.72 - 1478.16] too and get every single
[1474.40 - 1480.56] last drop out i love having control over
[1478.16 - 1482.08] you know over the celery juice you don't
[1480.56 - 1484.16] have control over it with these other
[1482.08 - 1485.52] juicers too it's like the stuff spitting
[1484.16 - 1487.20] spatting out anywhere
[1485.52 - 1488.88] and when it's a juicers where it's cold
[1487.20 - 1492.48] press there's
[1488.88 - 1495.12] metal gears inside of some of them
[1492.48 - 1496.24] metals going against itself so here's
[1495.12 - 1497.04] something that's really important
[1496.24 - 1499.52] someone says
[1497.04 - 1500.08] oh well you know he's just trying to
[1499.52 - 1503.12] sell his
[1500.08 - 1504.88] juicer so uh you know i've seen some
[1503.12 - 1507.20] really good users out there and
[1504.88 - 1508.80] and the whole bit in the vegan community
[1507.20 - 1510.40] and anywhere else and
[1508.80 - 1512.80] you know he's just he's just hooked on
[1510.40 - 1514.88] to a mega and that's his brand right
[1512.80 - 1516.24] well that's funny because with some of
[1514.88 - 1520.40] those juicers you guys
[1516.24 - 1522.88] there's metal gears metal gears
[1520.40 - 1523.84] do you guys know what that means right
[1522.88 - 1528.48] metal on
[1523.84 - 1532.32] metal think about it metal on metal
[1528.48 - 1535.84] what does that mean where's over time
[1532.32 - 1539.36] right you use that juicer for five years
[1535.84 - 1542.16] and those metal gears are banged up
[1539.36 - 1543.92] all that metal went inside of you it
[1542.16 - 1545.20] went into your juice
[1543.92 - 1547.12] so i'm just going to sit there and
[1545.20 - 1548.64] collect more metal over the years and
[1547.12 - 1550.08] more metal
[1548.64 - 1551.92] i don't have to worry about this with
[1550.08 - 1553.60] this machine so
[1551.92 - 1555.36] and and i was at a friend's house and
[1553.60 - 1556.16] they were making me juice and they had a
[1555.36 - 1559.76] good juicer
[1556.16 - 1562.88] they did but it was the metal gears
[1559.76 - 1564.88] right the metal gears and i was like
[1562.88 - 1567.20] uh looks like i'm getting a dose of
[1564.88 - 1568.08] metal today in my juice even though it's
[1567.20 - 1570.64] so my new
[1568.08 - 1571.84] in the moment it adds up over time and i
[1570.64 - 1573.28] was telling my friends you know
[1571.84 - 1575.84] how long you had that t-shirt like i had
[1573.28 - 1577.60] this juicer for three years you know
[1575.84 - 1578.88] and the parts broke down once in a while
[1577.60 - 1580.48] and i've ordered some more parts and
[1578.88 - 1581.68] i've gotten it whatever and happens to
[1580.48 - 1583.28] every juicer like that
[1581.68 - 1585.04] and it's like it's like they're like
[1583.28 - 1586.56] okay but you know that that the metal
[1585.04 - 1589.12] gears
[1586.56 - 1591.04] they're they're they're grinding into
[1589.12 - 1593.04] each other to make your juice
[1591.04 - 1594.72] you know what that means right oh yeah i
[1593.04 - 1596.08] guess metal on metal i go yeah kind of
[1594.72 - 1597.68] like the brakes on your car you guys
[1596.08 - 1598.16] ever have a car where the brakes finally
[1597.68 - 1600.40] went
[1598.16 - 1601.68] and now you're literally metal on metal
[1600.40 - 1603.68] your metal rotor
[1601.68 - 1605.92] and your metal brake pad is now scraping
[1603.68 - 1608.96] and it's going
[1605.92 - 1610.72] right squeak squeak and so
[1608.96 - 1612.00] i don't have to worry about that with
[1610.72 - 1614.32] this machine so
[1612.00 - 1615.04] i don't have a metal gear two metal
[1614.32 - 1618.16] gears
[1615.04 - 1619.92] in there crunching together and that's
[1618.16 - 1621.36] another reason why i like this
[1619.92 - 1623.36] health with liz good to see you on tik
[1621.36 - 1626.64] tok um
[1623.36 - 1627.92] kerry says it's 80 off now 82 off you
[1626.64 - 1632.08] just ordered it carrie
[1627.92 - 1634.32] mm-900 hds right right
[1632.08 - 1635.36] so um we'll cover a couple little things
[1634.32 - 1637.20] too i just wanted to cover
[1635.36 - 1638.96] that information it's all important you
[1637.20 - 1640.00] guys i talked about sodium cluster salts
[1638.96 - 1643.28] you guys know that
[1640.00 - 1645.92] right so it's one thing to like
[1643.28 - 1647.52] juice just don't get me wrong here right
[1645.92 - 1649.84] there's one thing
[1647.52 - 1651.44] to just juice right a doctor friend told
[1649.84 - 1654.00] me the other day like
[1651.44 - 1655.04] you know and he said well juicing yeah
[1654.00 - 1656.48] juicing is great
[1655.04 - 1658.24] everybody should juice i'm like wait a
[1656.48 - 1661.36] minute wait a minute
[1658.24 - 1664.72] don't give me that juicing bs
[1661.36 - 1667.76] don't you know and he laughed
[1664.72 - 1669.52] he laughed right you know he goes
[1667.76 - 1671.28] no juicing is great for you who doesn't
[1669.52 - 1673.44] know juicing isn't good for you i go
[1671.28 - 1675.04] don't give me that bs
[1673.44 - 1676.64] because there's a difference between
[1675.04 - 1677.84] making sure you juice your celery and
[1676.64 - 1679.76] you juice it right
[1677.84 - 1682.16] and you know how to you know how to do
[1679.76 - 1683.92] the celery juice the whole bit the
[1682.16 - 1686.24] details matter so i just want to cover
[1683.92 - 1689.36] that right there the details matter
[1686.24 - 1690.32] they matter you know and important to
[1689.36 - 1694.16] know
[1690.32 - 1695.84] um the details matter
[1694.16 - 1697.36] so you can sit there and juice all your
[1695.84 - 1699.04] carrots and your cabbage and your
[1697.36 - 1699.84] whatever and juice all your stuff like
[1699.04 - 1703.04] that right
[1699.84 - 1705.04] people did that people did that people
[1703.04 - 1706.80] did that for years
[1705.04 - 1708.56] it doesn't mean they got their cfs
[1706.80 - 1710.24] better it doesn't mean they got their
[1708.56 - 1711.76] five real better you guys it doesn't
[1710.24 - 1713.36] mean they got their multiple sclerosis
[1711.76 - 1713.84] better it doesn't mean they got anything
[1713.36 - 1715.12] better
[1713.84 - 1716.64] sure they might have got something a
[1715.12 - 1717.68] little better but then it all went
[1716.64 - 1720.96] backwards
[1717.68 - 1722.72] again but the bottom line is it's like
[1720.96 - 1726.00] celery juice is a whole
[1722.72 - 1726.56] nother level it's a whole entirely
[1726.00 - 1729.28] different
[1726.56 - 1729.84] therapeutic medicine way of dealing with
[1729.28 - 1732.80] things
[1729.84 - 1733.52] of handling things with your health so
[1732.80 - 1736.56] it's like
[1733.52 - 1738.08] if i was to have a juicer it's going to
[1736.56 - 1740.32] be for celery
[1738.08 - 1742.48] and yellow juice other things for fun
[1740.32 - 1743.52] yeah there's ways of doing medicinal
[1742.48 - 1744.96] juices there are
[1743.52 - 1746.88] like spirit has talked to me about all
[1744.96 - 1747.44] the different medicinal juices different
[1746.88 - 1749.68] ways of
[1747.44 - 1751.68] of combinations which i'll share over
[1749.68 - 1753.36] time but the point is is this is
[1751.68 - 1756.08] important when it comes down to
[1753.36 - 1756.56] celery that's that where the details
[1756.08 - 1758.32] matter
[1756.56 - 1760.88] instead of like oh yeah okay just i
[1758.32 - 1762.96] threw some celery sticks in my juice
[1760.88 - 1764.08] no it's about making sure you do your
[1762.96 - 1767.84] celery juice right
[1764.08 - 1770.72] that's how we move the needle um
[1767.84 - 1772.56] so that's important so don't get plastic
[1770.72 - 1774.24] into the body from that machine
[1772.56 - 1777.20] you're never you're never going to have
[1774.24 - 1779.20] non-plastic exposure on the planet
[1777.20 - 1780.24] you're exposed to plastic 24 7
[1779.20 - 1782.24] everywhere
[1780.24 - 1784.80] it's falling out of the sky it's in the
[1782.24 - 1786.64] air it's it's on everything
[1784.80 - 1787.84] like we can't run from plastic it's in
[1786.64 - 1790.32] the water supply
[1787.84 - 1793.12] we can't run from plastic right but
[1790.32 - 1795.92] plastic detox is really easy
[1793.12 - 1796.48] detox is really easy plastic comes out
[1795.92 - 1800.72] of the body
[1796.48 - 1802.32] really easy it can come out the next day
[1800.72 - 1804.16] if you're doing the right things to come
[1802.32 - 1805.28] out the next day plastic comes out of
[1804.16 - 1806.40] the body a lot of times when you're not
[1805.28 - 1807.76] even doing the right things but the
[1806.40 - 1811.12] whole point is
[1807.76 - 1812.56] is that metal doesn't come out of the
[1811.12 - 1814.64] body easy
[1812.56 - 1815.68] and that's something to know right there
[1814.64 - 1818.72] okay
[1815.68 - 1820.24] and and this is and just so you know
[1818.72 - 1822.64] this is like the innards here
[1820.24 - 1823.84] this is bpa-free right so that's
[1822.64 - 1825.28] important to know
[1823.84 - 1826.96] but um you guys by the way it's free
[1825.28 - 1831.52] shipping in the us right now too
[1826.96 - 1832.24] so it's 82 off 25 no 82 dollars yeah you
[1831.52 - 1835.76] save
[1832.24 - 1838.32] 25 off you guys but
[1835.76 - 1839.76] metal scares me because if you're not
[1838.32 - 1841.04] that's something you've got to work hard
[1839.76 - 1842.80] on like with the medical medium heavy
[1841.04 - 1844.08] metal detox smoothie
[1842.80 - 1846.64] and you don't want to be getting more
[1844.08 - 1849.36] metal in you all the time and that's why
[1846.64 - 1850.16] i don't like the other juicers too it's
[1849.36 - 1853.20] it's all the
[1850.16 - 1856.40] metal interaction it's a big
[1853.20 - 1859.60] part of why you know i don't like that
[1856.40 - 1861.84] um this is this is one piece
[1859.60 - 1862.88] instead of gears grinding against each
[1861.84 - 1866.24] other
[1862.88 - 1869.12] or or centrifuges with metal spinning
[1866.24 - 1869.76] and grinding right and if you got those
[1869.12 - 1872.72] fine
[1869.76 - 1874.08] use them juice your celery i do want you
[1872.72 - 1875.68] to get celery juice in you no matter
[1874.08 - 1877.52] what and that's the goal
[1875.68 - 1879.68] so keep with the juicer you have if
[1877.52 - 1882.08] that's the one you have
[1879.68 - 1884.08] but it's that metal situation it always
[1882.08 - 1886.64] gets to me it's always has so that's why
[1884.08 - 1888.48] that's why i got that's why i backed
[1886.64 - 1889.20] this juicer that's why i backed i was
[1888.48 - 1891.36] like you know what
[1889.20 - 1893.92] uh you know what i want to let people
[1891.36 - 1896.48] know i'll work with you guys at omega
[1893.92 - 1898.24] i want to let people know okay so the
[1896.48 - 1900.00] sale is at a mega that's where it is
[1898.24 - 1902.48] it's at their website
[1900.00 - 1904.08] not on amazon important to know so the
[1902.48 - 1907.44] sale for this juicer isn't
[1904.08 - 1910.48] at amazon it's omega juicers.com
[1907.44 - 1913.36] so mega juicers.com omega
[1910.48 - 1915.28] and there's just so you know you got to
[1913.36 - 1916.56] look for the mm 900 hds or you're not
[1915.28 - 1917.92] going to get the right juicer
[1916.56 - 1920.80] somebody asked that question so i was
[1917.92 - 1922.24] answering it so
[1920.80 - 1924.24] what i love about this user too is it
[1922.24 - 1926.16] cleans so easy
[1924.24 - 1927.84] and that's important to know how it
[1926.16 - 1929.28] cleans so easy
[1927.84 - 1932.16] um so there's always a question that
[1929.28 - 1935.68] comes up why am i allergic to celery
[1932.16 - 1937.84] well it depends when you eat celery
[1935.68 - 1939.76] is something does something crazy happen
[1937.84 - 1942.56] does your throat close up
[1939.76 - 1942.88] do you start coughing and choking when
[1942.56 - 1945.76] you
[1942.88 - 1947.84] drink celery or eat celery do you have a
[1945.76 - 1950.00] reaction when you have crudite
[1947.84 - 1951.20] like is it the kind of allergic reaction
[1950.00 - 1952.80] of celery where you're
[1951.20 - 1954.32] at a friend's house and you take a
[1952.80 - 1956.64] celery stick and you dip it in some
[1954.32 - 1958.00] hummus or you dip it in some sour cream
[1956.64 - 1959.92] you know dressing or something or
[1958.00 - 1961.28] whatever it is and you all of a sudden
[1959.92 - 1962.56] you eat that celery stick and it's
[1961.28 - 1964.32] definitely the celery stick and you're
[1962.56 - 1965.84] choking swelling your throat swelling
[1964.32 - 1967.36] that's that's different
[1965.84 - 1969.12] that's an allergic reaction someone can
[1967.36 - 1970.48] have with any single food i've seen
[1969.12 - 1972.08] people have that with meat
[1970.48 - 1973.76] seen that people have the chicken i've
[1972.08 - 1977.04] seen the people having peanut butter
[1973.76 - 1978.56] i've seen it happen with seeds nuts oils
[1977.04 - 1980.24] i've seen it happen with any fruit and
[1978.56 - 1984.24] vegetable right
[1980.24 - 1987.60] so and i've seen it happen with all that
[1984.24 - 1990.64] right or is it something where you had
[1987.60 - 1992.48] a food sensitivity test and you're told
[1990.64 - 1994.80] celery is one of them
[1992.48 - 1996.08] okay because i got a doctor calling
[1994.80 - 1997.68] right now
[1996.08 - 2000.24] who i got a doctor that's calling right
[1997.68 - 2003.12] now and he's gonna give me my
[2000.24 - 2005.12] food sensitivity test he's gonna tell me
[2003.12 - 2006.56] about my food sensitivities and all that
[2005.12 - 2009.12] so he's calling it a little bit i don't
[2006.56 - 2010.72] know when he's he's calling and

[2091.76 - 2095.76] cantaloupe
[2093.36 - 2097.68] all right how does these tests work do
[2095.76 - 2098.24] you even know how these allergies come
[2097.68 - 2101.36] up
[2098.24 - 2104.48] you really don't know okay
[2101.36 - 2106.00] so basically all right how am i allergic
[2104.48 - 2106.80] to these when i never react to any of
[2106.00 - 2109.84] them
[2106.80 - 2110.96] oh i'm not allergic to eggs dr solgar i

[2128.08 - 2131.20] i had them sitting there i could eat
[2130.24 - 2132.64] eggs then
[2131.20 - 2134.72] okay that's amazing that my food
[2132.64 - 2136.56] sensitivity test just like i heard my
[2134.72 - 2138.48] friend's food sensitivity test too
[2136.56 - 2139.92] they're allowed to eat things too that
[2138.48 - 2140.56] like eggs and they're allowed to have
[2139.92 - 2143.44] pork
[2140.56 - 2145.44] i can have pork too oh that's fantastic
[2143.44 - 2148.96] did you hear that buddy
[2145.44 - 2150.72] we're gonna slaughter you later
[2148.96 - 2152.40] and i'm gonna make sure we cut you up in
[2150.72 - 2155.44] a lot of pieces
[2152.40 - 2156.40] can i have can i have buddy's feet like
[2155.44 - 2159.44] pigs feet
[2156.40 - 2161.60] i can't i'm not allergic to pork okay
[2159.44 - 2163.12] i'll do that i'll make sure we do that
[2161.60 - 2164.56] so i can have things like a little bit
[2163.12 - 2167.28] of pork that's not on the list
[2164.56 - 2168.88] is an allergy that's interesting but i
[2167.28 - 2170.96] got to worry about the strawberry what
[2168.88 - 2174.24] other berries do i have to worry about
[2170.96 - 2175.92] uh black raspberry i haven't had one of
[2174.24 - 2178.24] those i don't think ever
[2175.92 - 2179.84] okay all right well i'm glad thanks for
[2178.24 - 2182.88] the food sensitivity test
[2179.84 - 2186.72] but i'm allergic to celery right okay
[2182.88 - 2188.64] okay thanks dr soldier
[2186.72 - 2190.16] just so you know that's how it is with a
[2188.64 - 2191.44] lot of people if you guys ever
[2190.16 - 2193.92] experienced that
[2191.44 - 2195.60] right that's how it's that's how the
[2193.92 - 2197.12] system's rigged
[2195.60 - 2199.36] basically they don't know what you're
[2197.12 - 2200.32] allergic to unless you they still don't
[2199.36 - 2202.08] even know if you're allergic to
[2200.32 - 2205.28] something if your throat swells up
[2202.08 - 2206.80] they just gotta eyeball it you can when
[2205.28 - 2208.40] you eat something
[2206.80 - 2211.52] and someone's throat swells up and
[2208.40 - 2214.16] they're having their anaphylactic shock
[2211.52 - 2215.60] they still don't know like it's how it's
[2214.16 - 2216.16] possible or if they're allergic to that
[2215.60 - 2218.24] never mind
[2216.16 - 2220.00] why is it possible a doctor can run all
[2218.24 - 2221.60] those tests food sensitivity tests what
[2220.00 - 2224.80] a scam system that is
[2221.60 - 2226.72] and they'll give you 30 allergies
[2224.80 - 2228.64] to like 30 fruits and vegetables and
[2226.72 - 2230.16] herbs and you'll be all of a sudden
[2228.64 - 2232.32] allergic to someone's
[2230.16 - 2233.52] a scallion you'll be allergic to some
[2232.32 - 2236.16] other like
[2233.52 - 2237.92] wacko thing and that's how it's rigged
[2236.16 - 2239.60] exactly i mean is that how it is
[2237.92 - 2241.12] you guys know you guys seen this you've
[2239.60 - 2242.64] gone through this i know many of you
[2241.12 - 2245.52] gone through this
[2242.64 - 2245.52] so anyway um
[2246.24 - 2249.44] here's the thing about what i love about
[2247.76 - 2250.56] celery juice okay so
[2249.44 - 2253.20] here's the thing what i love about
[2250.56 - 2253.20] celery juice
[2253.36 - 2256.88] that's that's an immune cell right there
[2256.24 - 2261.28] okay
[2256.88 - 2263.28] immune cells need mineral salts
[2261.28 - 2265.60] that's what they need they thrive on
[2263.28 - 2266.24] them so what happens is that subgroup of
[2265.60 - 2269.36] sodium
[2266.24 - 2272.08] right there sodium cluster salts
[2269.36 - 2273.28] helps to fortify and strengthen your
[2272.08 - 2275.44] immune cells
[2273.28 - 2277.36] right it's one thing right there it
[2275.44 - 2279.52] helps to get little gobble it one up
[2277.36 - 2281.36] a white blood cell will gobble one up
[2279.52 - 2282.64] when it gobbles up a solar system right
[2281.36 - 2284.72] here because it will
[2282.64 - 2286.08] it's to be super strong that's one thing
[2284.72 - 2290.56] that's interesting
[2286.08 - 2292.80] another thing that's really good is that
[2290.56 - 2294.08] celery juice that sodium cluster salt
[2292.80 - 2295.84] right there that i was showing you guys
[2294.08 - 2299.28] that subgroup of sodium
[2295.84 - 2302.16] it eats away the slip cover
[2299.28 - 2303.36] on bacteria and viruses so there's slip
[2302.16 - 2305.84] covers out here
[2303.36 - 2307.04] really important to know all the bugs
[2305.84 - 2310.00] inside of us
[2307.04 - 2312.32] have a protective sheath and that's how
[2310.00 - 2315.76] they stay alive and stay strong
[2312.32 - 2318.80] so they can evade all kinds of problems
[2315.76 - 2320.48] right so the sodium cluster salts eats
[2318.80 - 2322.00] away at that slip cover
[2320.48 - 2323.92] but you may think you don't have any
[2322.00 - 2325.12] bacteria you may think you don't have
[2323.92 - 2327.68] any viruses
[2325.12 - 2328.40] fibromyalgia aches and pains tingles and
[2327.68 - 2330.64] numbness
[2328.40 - 2332.56] mystery tingles and numbness ringing in
[2330.64 - 2335.76] the ears vertigo ever
[2332.56 - 2336.48] all that's viral okay chronic sinusitis
[2335.76 - 2339.52] utis
[2336.48 - 2341.76] bacteria right styes right
[2339.52 - 2342.80] if anybody has cold sores fever blisters
[2341.76 - 2345.68] boom viral
[2342.80 - 2347.12] right these are just some things if
[2345.68 - 2351.04] you've been diagnosed with anything
[2347.12 - 2354.08] ms lupus lyme disease pathogens right
[2351.04 - 2358.16] viruses but that's just some things
[2354.08 - 2359.76] fatigue bloating aches and pains
[2358.16 - 2361.36] feeling like you're 100 years old when
[2359.76 - 2363.12] you're only 50.
[2361.36 - 2364.16] you know all these things right feeling
[2363.12 - 2365.60] like you're 100 years old when you're
[2364.16 - 2368.08] only 22.
[2365.60 - 2369.12] okay the viruses and bacteria that make
[2368.08 - 2371.84] us sick
[2369.12 - 2373.52] feeding off the toxins inside of us okay
[2371.84 - 2375.92] have a slip cover on them
[2373.52 - 2377.12] and the sodium cluster salt eats away
[2375.92 - 2380.08] that slip cover
[2377.12 - 2382.24] and blows them up explodes them
[2380.08 - 2386.48] important to know
[2382.24 - 2390.72] really important information um
[2386.48 - 2393.04] so if someone gets like diarrhea
[2390.72 - 2394.72] they get runs they get the runs from
[2393.04 - 2398.56] their celery juice
[2394.72 - 2401.12] okay you're killing off
[2398.56 - 2402.80] pockets of bacteria so let's do this
[2401.12 - 2404.72] right now let's do a little
[2402.80 - 2407.36] run down on something for you guys real
[2404.72 - 2407.36] quick okay
[2408.84 - 2411.84] so
[2412.16 - 2416.48] so inside your gut lives a whole bunch
[2415.12 - 2420.08] of bad bacteria
[2416.48 - 2423.20] right and viruses too but they hide
[2420.08 - 2426.00] in pockets of rancid
[2423.20 - 2428.08] fat that stuck to the walls of your
[2426.00 - 2431.44] intestinal tract
[2428.08 - 2432.64] they thrive in pockets that are in the
[2431.44 - 2435.60] colon too
[2432.64 - 2437.12] okay and so putrefied proteins that
[2435.60 - 2439.76] didn't digest well
[2437.12 - 2441.36] because everybody has crappy digestion
[2439.76 - 2443.68] rancid fats that are caked onto the
[2441.36 - 2447.20] intestinal walls and linings
[2443.68 - 2447.92] right that's still there your pork fat
[2447.20 - 2450.56] you had
[2447.92 - 2452.40] i wasn't kidding about that it's still
[2450.56 - 2454.64] sitting on the lining of your gut and
[2452.40 - 2457.12] what's behind that pork fat
[2454.64 - 2457.92] are the bugs so that's important to know
[2457.12 - 2462.56] right there
[2457.92 - 2466.48] so what's sitting behind that pork fat
[2462.56 - 2469.36] are the bugs right and
[2466.48 - 2471.28] those little guys you know and they
[2469.36 - 2472.80] colonize in there
[2471.28 - 2474.56] now you might be somebody who says oh i
[2472.80 - 2476.00] got a good good practitioner i got a
[2474.56 - 2476.72] good doctor i'm all these gut health
[2476.00 - 2478.84] protocols
[2476.72 - 2480.08] all these probiotics well good
[2478.84 - 2483.44] microorganisms
[2480.08 - 2485.44] they don't fight bad microorganisms
[2483.44 - 2487.44] so good bacteria doesn't fight bad
[2485.44 - 2488.48] bacteria they don't care about each
[2487.44 - 2490.16] other
[2488.48 - 2491.76] you can put all the good bacteria you
[2490.16 - 2492.72] want inside your gut all the good
[2491.76 - 2494.80] probiotics
[2492.72 - 2496.08] inside your gut you can put anything you
[2494.80 - 2499.36] want inside there
[2496.08 - 2502.56] it's all good right microorganism world
[2499.36 - 2505.52] and guess what you can put it all in
[2502.56 - 2507.36] but it doesn't care or go against or
[2505.52 - 2508.96] defend you from the bad bugs
[2507.36 - 2510.72] the bad bugs just sit there doing their
[2508.96 - 2512.96] thing they'll still cause harm
[2510.72 - 2515.28] to still create more pockets they'll eat
[2512.96 - 2515.68] away at your lining over the year scar
[2515.28 - 2518.32] it up
[2515.68 - 2519.60] cause scar tissue right and they'll
[2518.32 - 2522.16] cause problems
[2519.60 - 2523.28] they'll multiply multiply release toxins
[2522.16 - 2526.24] because of it
[2523.28 - 2528.08] keep you more sick and toxic but you can
[2526.24 - 2529.60] put all the good microorganisms you want
[2528.08 - 2530.64] inside your body and it's not going to
[2529.60 - 2533.92] defend you
[2530.64 - 2535.60] at all against the bad stuff and
[2533.92 - 2537.28] that's one of the things you can stay
[2535.60 - 2538.72] sick you can go do all the gut health
[2537.28 - 2540.56] protocols you want but you stay
[2538.72 - 2542.32] sick if you're really sick you're going
[2540.56 - 2544.08] to stay sick over time
[2542.32 - 2546.64] or get sick again because the bad stuff
[2544.08 - 2549.84] is always in there
[2546.64 - 2552.00] and um why don't they ever see this
[2549.84 - 2554.56] stuff during colonoscopies
[2552.00 - 2555.60] we're talking microscopic levels right
[2554.56 - 2558.96] we're talking the
[2555.60 - 2560.72] microscopic world that's why right
[2558.96 - 2562.16] but i've talked to surgeons there's a
[2560.72 - 2563.68] lot of stuff inside there's a lot of
[2562.16 - 2566.96] putrified linings
[2563.68 - 2567.84] with rancid fats petrified proteins in
[2566.96 - 2570.80] the gut
[2567.84 - 2571.92] and the the scope just goes right by it
[2570.80 - 2574.32] it's it's all there
[2571.92 - 2575.12] on the lining of the walls but what you
[2574.32 - 2576.80] mistake
[2575.12 - 2579.68] what happens is what you mistake if you
[2576.80 - 2581.12] ever look at the pathway of the camera
[2579.68 - 2582.24] going in
[2581.12 - 2584.80] you think you're looking at your
[2582.24 - 2587.36] intestinal tract lining
[2584.80 - 2589.20] but we're looking at a layer over the
[2587.36 - 2591.04] intestinal tract lining
[2589.20 - 2593.12] just keep that in mind and then when a
[2591.04 - 2595.20] polyp comes out of that intestinal tract
[2593.12 - 2598.08] lining when a polyp pops out
[2595.20 - 2600.16] they'll see the polyp but you're still
[2598.08 - 2603.28] going to have a layer
[2600.16 - 2605.12] of all the putrified proteins putrefied
[2603.28 - 2605.68] rancid fat you're still going to have
[2605.12 - 2607.68] that there
[2605.68 - 2609.92] there's still that layer and it's in
[2607.68 - 2610.80] pockets too when that scope goes around
[2609.92 - 2612.64] and everything
[2610.80 - 2614.64] it's not catching every pocket every
[2612.64 - 2615.20] bend that's important to know right
[2614.64 - 2619.12] there
[2615.20 - 2622.32] okay and the majority of the garbage
[2619.12 - 2623.28] is up here that's the majority of the
[2622.32 - 2625.92] garbage
[2623.28 - 2627.28] it's up here it's all in this area here
[2625.92 - 2628.32] and then you have plenty of it in other
[2627.28 - 2630.08] areas too
[2628.32 - 2632.00] but what people mistaken i've talked to
[2630.08 - 2634.32] a colon surgeon about that
[2632.00 - 2635.60] he says what people don't understand is
[2634.32 - 2637.36] you're right he said
[2635.60 - 2639.04] that lining is not technically the
[2637.36 - 2640.88] lining that the camera is looking at
[2639.04 - 2644.16] that's a lining of
[2640.88 - 2646.88] of putrified junk that's adhered
[2644.16 - 2648.00] it's adhered to your colon and
[2646.88 - 2651.52] intestinal tract no one
[2648.00 - 2653.68] gets to see a fresh colon lining
[2651.52 - 2656.32] when they're doing a scope you've got
[2653.68 - 2658.40] years of the junk all stuck to the sides
[2656.32 - 2659.84] and that's one of the things to know but
[2658.40 - 2661.60] the microscopic world
[2659.84 - 2663.76] the cameras can't see the microscopic
[2661.60 - 2666.00] world no way the scope going up their
[2663.76 - 2667.68] rounds not looking at the microorganisms
[2666.00 - 2670.08] and if the good and bad ones are doing
[2667.68 - 2671.28] their thing um
[2670.08 - 2673.20] anyway if you're sensitive with the
[2671.28 - 2675.12] celery juice and you're having diarrhea
[2673.20 - 2676.32] you're having loose bowels build
[2675.12 - 2678.40] yourself up
[2676.32 - 2679.76] do a little bit two to four ounces or
[2678.40 - 2681.44] ask your doctor what's right for you
[2679.76 - 2682.24] okay that's fine ask your doctor what's
[2681.44 - 2685.52] right for you
[2682.24 - 2688.32] you can do that it's perfectly fine
[2685.52 - 2689.52] um but anyway you guys just wanted to
[2688.32 - 2692.72] let you know that
[2689.52 - 2696.96] 82 dollars off which is
[2692.72 - 2699.40] incredible right it's 25 off but 82
[2696.96 - 2700.60] is the break you get but it's at a
[2699.40 - 2704.40] megajuicers.com
[2700.60 - 2707.76] omega megajuicers.com
[2704.40 - 2710.40] and that's where the sale is and it's
[2707.76 - 2712.40] mm-900 hds so you know if you don't get
[2710.40 - 2714.08] the mm-900 hds you're not going to get
[2712.40 - 2716.00] the juicer it squeezes
[2714.08 - 2718.00] all the juice out you're going to get
[2716.00 - 2719.20] another juicer that doesn't squeeze as
[2718.00 - 2721.60] much juice out
[2719.20 - 2722.72] and that defeats the purpose of what
[2721.60 - 2724.56] you're trying to do
[2722.72 - 2726.00] you're trying to get a juicer to pay for
[2724.56 - 2729.12] itself
