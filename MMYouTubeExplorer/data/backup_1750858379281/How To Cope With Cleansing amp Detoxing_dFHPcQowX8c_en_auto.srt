31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,159
pathogens aren't always behind our

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,159
cravings

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,500
everybody's got pathogens everybody's

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,659
got strep

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,380
they have some type of pathogen within

36
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,439
them they'll have Epstein-Barr shingles

37
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,200
hhv6 cytomegalovirus they're hhv7 so

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,840
many different cold sore viruses canker

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,780
sore viruses so many people live with

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,880
pathogens all the time and I remember

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,700
the days before medical medium published

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,579
books where no one in the health realm

43
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,259
really knew about pathogens in the

44
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,299
Natural Health realm at all nobody knew

45
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,579
about pathogens being responsible for so

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,380
many different symptoms conditions so

47
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,299
this part I'm reading right now in

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,619
cleanse the heel is about adrenaline

49
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,860
release now we're talking about

50
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,560
cleansing so hang in there for the ride

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,960
I'm here Jacoby says I still need my

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,979
Stones it's storming out there so you

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,959
can't get it you'll get them later

54
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,700
amazing

55
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,239
pathogens aren't always behind our

56
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,860
cravings when we avoid certain foods

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,840
Cravings also have an emotional

58
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,480
component now the reason why I was

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,680
saying that is because

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:29,220
pathogens love to eat certain foods and

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,959
that can get us into the craving mode

62
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,200
so when we have all these different

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,220
pathogens inside of us they need to eat

64
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,400
pathogens don't just exist and that's it

65
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,760
they have to eat they have to reproduce

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,680
that's what pathogens do

67
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,000
Cravings also have an emotional

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,800
component

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,459
that's an important thing to understand

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,099
too so if we have cravings could easily

71
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,780
be an emotional component involved a

72
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,519
trigger have you ever been triggered

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,700
into cravings

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,819
have you ever had a stress trigger of

75
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,640
some kind that sends you into a place of

76
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,159
craving I'm craving that coffee I'm

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,879
craving that chocolate I'm craving that

78
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,560
salty fatty sweet snack I'm craving that

79
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,239
chocolate cake I'm craving those hot

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,379
dogs craving those cheeseburgers craving

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,500

00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,659
I'm craving chicken fingers I'm craving

83
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,860
nuggets from the fast food chain

84
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,480
restaurant I'm craving craving craving

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,239
Cravings also have an emotional

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,860
component people tend to be long oh this

87
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,580
is really cool right here

88
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,920
people tend to belong to one of two

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,799
schools when it comes to eating and

90
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,980
emotions see if this resonates at all

91
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,019
with you guys in the one school are

92
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,519
folks who eat to take their mind off

93
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:56,519
their pain emotional pain do you eat to

94
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,739
take your mind off of emotional pain

95
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,239
where it's like get that food out like

96
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,980
maybe you're at work or something like

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,720
that you're maybe you're in the office

98
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,040
maybe you're wherever you are maybe

99
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,180
you're at a friend's house a family

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,760
member's house and you're eating to

101
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,860
suppress

102
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,400
emotional pain you're eating to take

103
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,060
your mind off of some type of emotional

104
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,740
trigger emotional situation

105
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,860
emotional pain

106
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,620
when we're in this school and we take

107
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,540
away certain Comfort Foods sometimes we

108
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,740
start to experience a few feelings we

109
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,479
were trying to use food to suppress

110
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,919
interesting if you just got on here I'm

111
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,020
actually reading out a cleanse Hill if

112
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,340
you don't have this book

113
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,199

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,780
missing out it's incredible book

information has so many things in there

117
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,320
so when you're in this one school so you

118
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,940
there's people that belong to usually

119
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,740
two schools when it comes to eating and

120
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,180
emotions and this one school or folks

121
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,740
who eat to take their mind off their

122
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,139
pain and when we're in this school and

123
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,060
we take away certain Comfort Foods we

124
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,419
start to experience a few feelings we

125
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,699
are trying to stuff down down inside

126
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,259
stuff down I see a lot of people asking

127
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,620
about the collecting Stones Journey

128
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:19,500

hope you are truly

149
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,620
sometimes we start to experience a few

150
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,419
feelings when we take away Comfort Foods

151
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,960
because we were using those Comfort

152
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,520
foods to suppress and bury deep down

153
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,900
inside

154
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,900
Who stuff it down we're in pain we're

155
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,259
struggling mentally and emotionally and

156
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,360
we need to shove those emotions in

157
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,940
constantly so we need those Comfort

158
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,819
foods to shove them in deep that's how

159
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,360
it's done Comfort Foods shove them in

160
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,360
deep

161
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,800
that old familiar sadness loneliness

162
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:46,020
fear shame guilt

163
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:49,080
anybody yeah it just hits everybody

164
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,080
the sadness the loneliness the fear the

165
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,720
shame the guilt or anger

166
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,259
starts to cast a shadow over our

167
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,539
thoughts we remove that food

168
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:03,240
that was shoving it deep down inside

169
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:06,840
that emotional pain

170
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,560
we've removed that food and then anger

171
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:14,520
can Surface anger can get triggered

172
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,020
anger can steep up and start to take

173
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,639
over

174
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,560
that has that ever happened to any of

175
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,539
you guys because you take away those

176
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,039
Comfort Foods especially if you're

177
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,020
taking away this Comfort foods and you

178
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,460
don't have something really healing

179
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,840
really nutritious really

180
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,819
fortifiable for the brain if you don't

181
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,919
have that then we get in trouble

182
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,300
especially we get in trouble then

183
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,460
hmm

184
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,539
hopefully you don't mind

185
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,539
a little sip here

186
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:50,400
so even anger can start to Shadow over

187
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,580
our thoughts or even creeps in as a

188
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,500
sinking in the stomach or tightness in

189
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,539
the chest and in that moment the

190
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,199
pleasures of pizza or mac and cheese or

191
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:04,139
ice cream seem the perfect antidote it's

192
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,660
like when something starts creeping up

193
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,960
something is percolating up something

194
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:14,099
emotional is coming out of that Lion's

195
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,259
Den out of that Dragon's Cave and when

196
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,660
it starts to come up

197
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,400
we gotta shove it back in we better get

198
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,979
the macaroni and cheese out we better

199
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,900
get the pizza out and ready we better

200
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,840
get the chocolate cake going we better

201
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,060
get the chocolate going the cacao we

202
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,279
better get our favorite protein bars

203
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,200
chocolate bars candy bars that are all

204
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,419
natural filled with a whole bunch of

205
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,479
crap and garbage we just better get

206
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,539
whatever it is we better get stuff in us

207
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,020
that comfort food and shove it down deep

208
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,940
because that dragon's coming out of the

209
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,860
cave and it's surfacing and it's coming

210
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,180
out of there guys I'm reading how to

211
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,500
cleanse the heel

212
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,600
talking about cleansing because

213
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,940
cleansing and detoxing is critical in

214
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,680
the summer it's summer time perfect time

215
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,640
to do it you're not freezing your ass

216
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,920
off

217
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,899
and it's summertime unless you're on the

218
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,519
other opposite side of the planet and

219
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,420
you're cold but still it's a good time

220
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,420
to do it then too

221
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,600
it's a really good time

222
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:22,200
I say trying to suppress because

223
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:25,260
does eating really suppress emotions

224
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,140
does eating all those Comfort Foods

225
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,980
really suppress the emotions

226
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:36,180
or is it like a temporarily we shove it

227
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:39,060
down but does it truly suppress it all

228
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,040
because it comes back again and then we

229
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,860
need the Comfort foods to shove it back

230
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,660
down and then it comes back up again and

231
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,220
we need the Comfort foods to shove it

232
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,959
back down and what if you're somebody

233
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,000
where you're doing the Comfort foods and

234
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,980
it's not really working and the emotions

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,800
are just kicking in the gear and you

236
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,380
can't shove it down anymore and it seems

237
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,260
to be coming up right the wild blueberry

238
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,360
babe says no quick fix exactly so it

239
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,720
just keeps on percolating keeps on

240
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,140
coming out and we try to push it back

241
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,140
down

242
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,060
so I say trying to suppress

243
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,580
because does eating really suppress

244
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,680
emotions only temporarily are you

245
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,339
reading that did you see that

246
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,019
page 446 and cleanse the heel only

247
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,880
temporarily it says right there there

248
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,519
you go emotional liver

249
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,360
live a rescue I think I got live rescue

250
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,360
behind me right here

251
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,740
and is suppression the real goal do we

252
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,420
want to suppress it do we want to shove

253
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,040
down those emotions do we want to try to

254
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,980
keep it all down do you want to keep

255
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,899
that pipe from exploding

256
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,660
do we want

257
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,440
to keep that hurt down

258
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,440
deep

259
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:02,940
in is suppression the real goal probably

260
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:05,339
not healing is the real goal true

261
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,800
emotional suppression can happen

262
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,779
sometimes when you've been harmed and

263
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,640
the adrenaline that Harbors the pain of

264
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:13,440
the trauma gets stored deep in the

265
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,160
neurons of the emotional centers of the

266
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,839
brain that's usually not a bad thing

267
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,220
emotional walls exist to protect us I

268
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,980
want to talk about that for a little bit

269
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,959
here I am cleanser heal you guys I saw

270
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,760
somebody ask what book is it what page

271
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,760
446 and cleanse the heel

272
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:35,640
so as we stuff things down

273
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:40,200
to try to suppress the pain

274
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:42,899
and push down that emotional hurt

275
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,720
and we eat our comfort foods to try to

276
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:48,779
keep it shoved down

277
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,339
it still creeps back up

278
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:53,279
because suppressing it with Comfort

279
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,220
Foods isn't the answer

280
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,079
but it's a really hard hard time Rooney

281
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,120
says where do I sign up I think you sign

290
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,360
emotional walls exist to protect us

291
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,360
other than this truly suppressed trauma

292
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,100
though pain tends to resurface when we

293
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,459
start thinking about it again we feel

294
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,160
that urge to eat certain foods again

295
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:43,079
I'm keeping myself distracted

296
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm eating

297
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:48,240
a nice big bowl

298
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,880
of macaroni and cheese

299
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,500
the cheese has got kind of burnt on top

300
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,420
a little bit so it's nice and brown and

301
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,880
crispy on top

302
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,920
just the way I like it

303
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,300
took it out of the oven

304
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:06,540
it's this tasty cheesy macaroni kind of

305
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,440
a burnt topping crack into it with a

306
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,260
fork

307
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm keeping myself distracted this is

308
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,579
helping me emotionally in the moment

309
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,320
it's helping me

310
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:21,000
keep down that Dragon I've been hurt

311
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,220
I've been hurt bad

312
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,620
I had a bad day

313
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,720
I'm tired

314
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,720
crack open

315
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,700
that cheesy surface with the fork get

316
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,700
that mac and cheese in my system

317
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,660
then the pain starts resurface again

318
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,180
we start thinking about that pain and

319
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,240
that suffering again I'm not

320
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,320
being distracted enough again I need a

321
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,320
slice of pizza now

322
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,740
when we start thinking about food again

323
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,560

if anyone is having trouble that's

339
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,839
signed up to the collecting Stones

340
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,740
meditation journey and you're you're

341
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,740
lost in the moment

342
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:56,100
when we start feeling or thinking about

343
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:59,040
that hurt again that trigger again

344
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,959
we want to eat certain foods again and

345
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,019
that can keep happening over and over

346
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,120
again if we don't know which foods can

347
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,680
actually help our bodies heal while

348
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,480
we're going through emotional hardships

349
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,800
and I get it we can eat ourselves sick

350
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,899
when we're going through some hardships

351
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,639
now remember this is the school of

352
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,760
eating when you have a trigger this is

353
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,519
the school of eating Comfort Foods when

354
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,519
you have a hardship I'm not in the other

355
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,260
school yet so we'll get there too

356
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,420
and I realized that when we're in this

357
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,880
school of eating a lot of foods to

358
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,680
shove down emotional pain emotional

359
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:36,720
sorrow when we're using food as a drug

360
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,699
we're using food as a drug to shove it

361
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,160
down deep inside when we're in that

362
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:43,019
position we can eat ourselves sick where

363
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,540
the food we can't even get enough food

364
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,699
in us anymore to kind of numb things up

365
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,380
or help it out because their stomachs

366
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:52,079
can't handle any more food how many

367
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,560
people go through that delete a whole

368
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,120
cheese pizza or pepperoni cheese pizza

369
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,100
and they're stuffed they can't even

370
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,660
breathe but then their mind is on how

371
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,399
stuffed they are but if that trigger

372
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,260
starts happening again they're kind of

373
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,660
stuck because they can't go and eat a

374
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,279
whole nother cheese pizza to shove it

375
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,440
down and shove those emotions down

376
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,720
because their stomach is so full so

377
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,440
they're in this weird lull it's torture

378
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,440
for a lot of people

379
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:21,300
one of the reasons we consume Comfort

380
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,699
Foods in the first place is to sop up

381
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,440
the adrenaline that comes with emotional

382
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,540
disturbances and conflicts and I just

383
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,279
want to say that we don't know that

384
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,740
we don't know that I mean that's medical

385
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,260
meme info but people don't know that's

386
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,360
what's happening

387
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,100
where we don't know we're consuming

388
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,740
Comfort Foods in the first place to stop

389
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,660
up adrenaline nobody ever knew that I

390
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,639
mean that's medical meme info it's in

391
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,199
the books but nobody knew that that

392
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,180
that's what we're doing

393
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,459
but that's what we're doing that's one

394
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,199
of these innate Instincts by the way

395
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,779
because when you go through a hardship

396
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,480
in a difficult time you get an

397
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:00,240
adrenaline explosion

398
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,120
or implosion

399
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,439
which you get an adrenaline

400
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,540
surge

401
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,980
and when that surge happens it's

402
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,480
floating around through your bloodstream

403
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,160
it's throat floating around in your

404
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,780
organs it's hitting your brain and it's

405
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,040
got all kinds of information in there

406
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,439
that I was talking about that

407
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,839
information if I was hurt that trust was

408
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,000
broken I was let down I was betrayed

409
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,419
something happened to me something's

410
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,640
wrong I'm upset again I was triggered

411
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:29,100
that was a terrible argument I just got

412
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,679
into with with someone that's my partner

413
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,140
my friend I'm in a relationship whatever

414
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,440
it is that's happening

415
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,940
that adrenaline is coursing through your

416
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,840
system and coursing through your system

417
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,820
and then we actually take food and don't

418
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,220
realize it we don't realize that this is

419
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,880
part of an innate innate instinct is we

420
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,500
take food and we eat it because we're

421
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720
actually trying not just because we're

422
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,539
hungry we're eating it because we're

423
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,760
trying to sop up the adrenaline surge

424
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:02,720
toxic adrenaline that has so much

425
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,720
information in it

426
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:10,380
traditional Comfort Foods think tacos

427
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:13,440
nachos Pizza mac and cheese ice cream

428
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,059
spaghetti with meatballs pancakes french

429
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,059
fries Lobster with butter

430
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,160
chicken wings pulled pork sandwiches

431
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,120
now I've never had a pulled pork

432
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,640
sandwich

433
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,919
ever in my life

434
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,020
and anytime I like hear somebody had one

435
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,360
or someone ate one or there's there's

436
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,280
one on some kind of thing on social

437
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,179
media or something and some chefs making

438
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,880
a pulled pork sandwich and I mean I

439
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,559
can't eat that I just can't do it you

440
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,900
know there's something about it I can't

441
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,179
eat a pulled pork sandwich I just can't

442
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,220
but I'm but I'm not shaming anybody that

443
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,960
can or anybody that does and I'm not

444
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,480
making fun of anybody that does and I'm

445
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,940
not judging anybody that does but every

446
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,160
time I always think pancreatitis you

447
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,500
know every time I see somebody playing

448
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,240
with pork or eating a pulled pork

449
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,100
sandwich or something like that all I

450
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,620
think of is pancreatitis it's like

451
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,799
pulled pork pancreatitis pulled pork

452
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,440
sandwiches pancreatitis

453
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,400
grilled cheese fried eggs are usually

454
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,940
high in fat that fat is what's

455
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,179
soaking

456
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,179
stuff up the fat is what's doing the

457
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:26,100
sopping up so here's what's happening

458
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,440
you get some bad news you got triggered

459
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,720
or you're just in a mode and you got

460
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,580
triggered somehow some way you got PTSD

461
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,400
and you got triggered

462
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,020
someone could easily have some PTSD and

463
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,860
they get triggered so now we're

464
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,900
triggered so now our adrenal is surging

465
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,059
it's coursing through our veins and our

466
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,919
organs and as that adrenaline is

467
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,080
coursing through our veins and organs

468
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,799
it's got information in it that's hurt

469
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:56,400
we're hurt fear

470
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:59,039
guilt shame anger all coursing through

471
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,919
our veins and then we go and we take

472
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,960
something that's greasy or fried and we

473
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,760
want to sop it up we don't know that's

474
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,240
what we're doing but we're innately

475
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,419
trying to stop up the adrenaline

476
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,600
and that's part of the whole suppressing

477
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:18,059
emotions that's going on that's part of

478
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,700
the whole eating to suppress eating to

479
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,860
shove it down deep inside that's all

480
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,720
part of it right there

481
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,340
so when we're doing traditional Comfort

482
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,960
Foods now you might be a vegan and

483
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,940
you're shoving it down with all kinds of

484
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,860
you know crazy nut butter concoctions

485
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,840
and donuts and cakes that are vegan

486
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,120
donuts and cakes filled with canola oil

487
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,440
and all this garbage right you might be

488
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,360
somebody that's shoving it you might be

489
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,880
a vegan or a plant-based person and

490
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,059
you're shoving it down with uh a vegan

491
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,559
bar or shoving it down with a chocolate

492
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,900
bar

493
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,460
all that cacao all that fat to sop up

494
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
that adrenaline because you're triggered

495
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,059
so you're trying to sop up all that

496
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,340

lactose

503
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,940
but still we use it and we're shoving it

504
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,100
down and we're trying to sop up all that

505
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,200

511
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,220

so when we're trying to shove stuff down

515
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:37,620
and it's not the more vegan or

516
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,240
plant-based options or something like

517
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,220
that that still may not be good for us

518
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,780
we shove it down with tacos and nachos

519
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,280

but I am here live right now talking

547
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,760
about it we're talking about other

548
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,039
things too

549
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,140
someone said hummus

550
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,299
yeah hummus with all that tahini in

551
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,580
there and olive oil in it to sop it up

552
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:59,220
so maybe you're a plant-based person and

553
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,120
you're sopping it up

554
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,120
those emotions

555
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,320
loving healing says once I accept it

556
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,080
that detox was going to be emotional it

557
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,500
helped ride the waves and finally push

558
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,620
forward with healing foods

559
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,620
amen that was really a really

560
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,440
interesting and spot on

561
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:26,039
Ro says

562
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,659
was hospitalized to pancreatitis twice

563
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,880
I'm so sorry to hear that and I believe

564
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:32,159
you were of course because a lot of

565
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,240
people that happens to them and I'm so

566
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,240
sorry you've gone through that

567
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:44,220
here's the key point

568
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,620
the fat cells trap the adrenaline the

569
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,480
adrenaline has emotions in it from what

570
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,640
you're going through your PTSD and

571
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,400
everything else

572
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,740
and with that

573
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,840
your adrenaline then gets trapped in the

574
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,020
fat cells and all the different fat that

575
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,640
gets stored up into organs

576
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,360
in the case of adrenaline that was

577
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,820
released at a highly emotional time

578
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,340
it holds information about the fear hurt

579
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,659
betrayal injury or stress overload we

580
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,159
were experiencing in that moment what

581
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm trying to say is I'll just break it

582
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,360
down right here

583
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,140
I'll break it down right here

584
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,140
we get hurt

585
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:29,220
we have an emotional adrenaline surge

586
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,280
we might be experiencing some type or

587
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,200
form of chaos emotional chaos of some in

588
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,740
some way fear

589
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,419
anger all of it

590
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,860
adrenaline's floating around in our

591
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,780
bloodstream

592
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,020
coursing through our veins

593
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,360
we have this innate response

594
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:51,659
of shooting for a comfort food grabbing

595
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,760
a comfort food that's high in fat most

596
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,679
definitely and high in sugar a lot of

597
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,960
times it's not the sugar

598
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,860
but it's the high fat content that

599
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,960
really

600
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,539
stops up the adrenaline we eat that high

601
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,340
fatty food it soaks up the adrenaline

602
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:07,200
and then stores it deep in her organs

603
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,400
with the information of that hurt when

604
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,539
we cleanse

605
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,539
it comes out

606
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,419
some people don't eat when trauma

607
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,100
happens and I'm about to get to that

608
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,820
that's the second School we're about to

609
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:23,280
read and they eat and they grab Comfort

610
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,779
Foods at some point when it's later on

611
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,760
down the road because they have to eat

612
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:28,679
at some point so they have hurt they

613
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,539
have pain they have fear they're

614
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,100
triggered they got the PTSD and they

615
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,740
don't eat they've got the spigot off

616
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,779
they shut the spigot off and that's off

617
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,440
and then they don't eat but they gotta

618
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,440
eat eventually

619
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:47,039
let's see joking

620
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:49,559
says I am discouraged I receive so much

621
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,600
acne after the cleanse I know I should

622
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:55,380
continue but I am not happy because

623
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,179
first I had it hadn't it and now I have

624
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,179
it a lot so I'll give you a couple

625
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,440
little rundowns on that first of all

626
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,539
um

627
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,340
what cleanse are you even doing what's

628
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,740
going on in there many things could be

629
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,500
happening could have had exposure at

630
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,360
some point when people say they did the

631
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,799
cleanse I've had situations where it's

632
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,559
not even a medical meme cleanse that

633
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,539
we're doing a lot of people just are

634
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,520
just doing somebody's cleanse is that

635
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,659
something to know were you doing a

636
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,340
cleanse plus a whole bunch of different

637
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,480
other stuff were you doing a cleanse and

638
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,900
a whole bunch of different supplements

639
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,000
that were filled with all this garbage

640
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,860
which cleanse were you even doing was it

641
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,260
out of a medical medium book were you

642
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,760
eating something before the cleanse that

643
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,260
was crazy were you eating something

644
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,360
right after the cleanse that was crazy

645
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,640
it there's so many different aspects it

646
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,640
can go you can go on and on and on did

647
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,480
you get a recent bacterial exposure to

648
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,220
kick up the acne did the acne get

649
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,500
triggered by something else from some

650
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,620
other exposure that you were

651
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,480
susceptible to or mean or exposed to it

652
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,100
the list goes on so we have to be a

653
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,600
detective we have to understand the

654
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,940
books and the information and be a

655
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,460
detective understand what we're doing

656
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,880
some people before they go on a cleanse

657
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,159
they trash themselves with a ton of

658
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,659
crazy food and I can't be a fly on the

659
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,400
wall in everybody's house and

660
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,740
everybody's bathroom

661
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,159
but I do know this that a lot of people

662
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,260
before they embark on a cleanse

663
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:24,840
eat the out of a bunch of comfort

664
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,900
food that comfort food gets in their

665
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,659
liver it gets in their bloodstream in

666
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,940
their lymphatic system it feeds all

667
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,860
kinds of bacteria all kinds of other

668
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,020
pathogen matter then you go on the

669
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,779
cleanse but yet all that stuff is

670
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,220
sitting there feeding bugs so you might

671
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,419
have to do you know ask your doctor

672
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,159
what's right for you but you might have

673
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:47,760
to do another cleanse you might have to

674
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,620
do another one with it and then did you

675
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,900
look at protocols as you look at

676
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,179
protocols with acne did you look at the

677
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,159
supplementation protocols and read about

678
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,679
that because when you're dealing with

679
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,020
acne or dealing with pathogens did you

680
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,580
have any recent antibiotic use out there

681
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,700
I'm saying this to everybody overall

682
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,039
blankets for everybody blanket statement

683
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,539
for everybody did you use any

684
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,140
antibiotics for something recently

685
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:14,880
because strep is antibiotic resistant it

686
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,799
goes down from antibiotics and then it

687
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,840
goes back up stronger than ever and

688
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,960
that's how it works

689
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,720
um or was your body killing off so much

690
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,940
stress so much strep was your body

691
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,159
killing and eliminating so much strep

692
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,440
while you were cleansing and then you

693
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,080
had just all the toxic crap coming out

694
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,520
the strap was fighting for its life so

695
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,620
it came out because you're actually

696
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,080
making a dent in it and cleaning it up

697
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,299
I'm trying to give people all the tips

698
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,600
right up front a whole bunch of them to

699
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:47,580
take a look at and see what's going on

700
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,740
yeah I mean it's so simple as that

701
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,299
including you know new relationships

702
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,500
from six months ago before you started

703
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,600
your cleanse where you were already

704
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,279
coming into a place where you were about

705
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,919
to get a new strep infection causing

706
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:01,020
acne and other symptoms maybe a new

707
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,659
relationship whole bit it's the whole

708
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,279
whole thing so all these things are

709
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,080
including including drinking off

710
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,480
somebody else's glasses eating off of

711
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,200
somebody else's plates but in all of

712
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,640
that okay or like were you careful with

713
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,020
the grocery cart handles because I'm

714
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,600
going to tell you right now there's at

715
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,240
least at least 50 different varieties of

716
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,860
strep these days these days right now on

717
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,860
grocery store cart handles

718
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,640
so I would use a white bee on that

719
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,620
grocery store card handle just a minute

720
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,299
you even get up to it I would never go

721
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,340
up to it and just grab it and be like

722
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:36,960
hey I'm a warrior doesn't even matter

723
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,940

728
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:51,360
streptococcus streptococcal and strip

729
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,340
might be someone who needs to get off of

00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,419
be doing that while they're cleansing

732
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:59,460

indeed

742
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,559
see Lila Collins I took my time cutting

743
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,779
out fats five years later all I have is

744
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,039
celery juice smoothies raw foods fruits

745
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:28,440
and vegetables with beverages

746
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,200
supplements you can do it too which

747
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,940
means it's really helping you

748
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,580
so

749
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,020
all this stuff is important to know keep

750
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,539
that in mind

751
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:42,480
um just gave you a rundown on so many

752
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:45,360
different aspects of what's going on

753
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,279
of how it works you literally could be

754
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,440
coming down with a new variety of strep

755
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,640
you picked up three months ago and the

756
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,919
cleansing is critical because it's

757
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,460
helping to get it out you can also be in

758
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:58,320
a place where you fed it prior you can

759
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,659
also be in a place where you're actually

760
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,940
cleansing out old antibiotics in your

761
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,820
system for from 15 years ago 10 years

762
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,760
ago from when you took antibiotics for

763
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,919
strep infections for strep throat and

764
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,500
acne and that's coming out of your liver

765
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:16,080
so that can be a whole other aspect of

766
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,419
it but either way it for everybody

767
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,880
people got different situations stubborn

768
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:23,279
strep bacteria are like super bugs and

769
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,919
they can take a lot of strong protocols

770
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,419
for a while to get rid of them it takes

771
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,220
time for a lot of people here's another

772
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,620
thing everybody's acne is different

773
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,640
because everybody's acne isn't the same

774
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,399
strip

775
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,399
keep that in mind too that's a big one

776
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:41,220
right there someone can have such a

777
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,600
stubborn strep that takes time and

778
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,840
protocols

779
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,520
because it's so antibiotic resistant or

780
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,899
so stubborn there's so many strains

781
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,059
there's hundreds and hundreds of strains

782
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:52,620
of strep and someone can have multiple

783
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,480
strains of strep and this is critical to

784
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,159
know right here since we're on this

785
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,559
topic because I want to help out like

786
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,480
this stuff too not just the emotional

787
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,059
aspect but the physical aspect with

788
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,340
things and I just want to say

789
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,779
that you can be some you can have

790
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,820
someone you can have two different

791
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:10,500
people with two different forms of acne

792
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,279
nobody even knows the difference so one

793
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:18,120
person has one antibiotic stubborn

794
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:21,960
really really mean mean ass strep and

795
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:24,480
then another person it's not so stubborn

796
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,360
it's not so antibiotic resistant or

797
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,760
resistant to things and doesn't take too

798
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,140
much to clean it up another person could

799
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,440
have more strep in their lymphatic

800
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,480
system and less in their lymphatic

801
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,039
system the next person more strep in

802
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,620
your liver and the other person with

803
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,120
acne has less strep in their liver so

804
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,860
that's a whole other thing too the

805
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,600
different amounts and all that and you

806
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,440
can pick up a strap from somebody else

807
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,480
who took 20 antibiotics and that strep

808
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,399
was stubborn as heck and then you got

809
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,799
that same variety and that happens to

810
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:57,659
people a lot a lot of people get into

811
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,940
relationships and the person that got

812
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,100
into a relationship with has a stubborn

813
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,500
strep that they took antibiotics for 10

814
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:07,860
years for one that was giving them UTIs

815
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,140
and then they picked up that strep from

816
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,600
that person and now they have that that

817
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,700
strap in their system that's that's um

818
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,100
immune to 20 antibiotics and it's

819
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:20,519
stubborn so

820
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,500
oh dear lord

821
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,080
somebody could have a strep that's been

822
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,940
in 20 other people who took a hundred

823
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,620
antibiotics

824
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,740
and that

825
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,840
can happen too so I hate to say this but

826
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,320
someone

827
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,480
can be in a strap that was in

828
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,480
20 people

829
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,340
and 100 antibiotics it's that crazy how

830
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,380
it works so

831
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,220
before we go down the rabbit hole with

832
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:52,019
this

833
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:54,299
what it is is these things we can move

834
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:56,760
out of our body we can cleanse out and

835
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,059
we can beat out because we can starve

836
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,460
these bacteria and pathogens

837
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:04,500
we can starve them if we take away the

838
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,120
food that the pathogens like which is

839
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,559
medical medium information because guess

840
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,800
what nobody knew

841
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,960
pathogens like bacteria actually ate

842
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,300
anything and now you see how much people

843
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,520
how many people in the industry poached

844
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,520
medical medium information about that

845
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,359
acne is bacterial it's not hormones you

846
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:27,780
got acne you have bacteria causing it

847
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:29,399
so all good information we just ran

848
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,379
across a whole strap thing just now

849
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,419
Nicole says I need help with chocolate

850
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm addicted

851
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:37,260
I understand completely it's it's not an

852
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,060
easy one chocolate is one of those

853
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,280
things where the caffeine has everybody

854
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,460
so jacked up once you come off that

855
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,040
caffeine ride it's intense really

856
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:50,359
intense and by the way there's an acne

857
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,359
protocol in cleanse the heel

858
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,480
good good good

859
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,720
Sarah

860
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:06,000
my fiance my fiance has cellulitis

861
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,200
two rounds of antibiotics and no relief

862
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,780
I started him on celery juice boom gone

863
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,480
Sarah incredible and that proves

864
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,740
something very important right there I

865
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,660
always say

866
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,579
everybody's different

867
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:24,060
their exposures what they have in them

868
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:27,060
and everything else so your fiance only

869
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:31,079
needed celery juice

870
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:33,720
to get rid of cellulitis

871
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,579
that's incredible I always say that some

872
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,680
people only need celery juice just to

873
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:39,000
get rid of one thing by the way I'm in

874
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Clinton Hill you guys if you don't have

875
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,300
the book you're missing out

876
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,339
it's

877
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,500
by far

878
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:48,540
one of the most powerful books in health

879
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,579
out there in the world today

880
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,680
Millions

881
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:55,560
have gotten this book in their hands and

882
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,760
moved themselves forward and got rid of

883
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,500
some of the most

884
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,500
crippling conditions

885
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,300
okay

886
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,300
let's roll a little bit

887
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,280
once the fat has soaked up the

888
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,520
adrenaline the stress hormone becomes

889
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,740
trapped in our fat cells fat cells that

890
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,320
then become part of us as they take up

891
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,180
residents inside our organs so we got

892
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,339
this adrenaline that's taking up

893
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,859
residence because it's in a fat cell

894
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:28,380
it's building up inner organs and

895
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:30,540
there's information of fear and shame

896
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,720
and guilt and chaos and triggers and

897
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:36,000
PTSD all wrapped up in there and that's

898
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,820
how cleansing how critical cleansing is

899
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,820
to help get rid of and push that out of

900
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,700
our body how incredible is that

901
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:49,040
Kim Miller I get sick every time I'm in

902
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,040
a new relationship I always wondered why

903
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,960
there's yeah there's so much involved in

904
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,300
that but we can't be afraid of a new

905
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,960
relationship we can't be afraid

906
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,839
of being with people of seeking love and

907
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,420
finding partnership and partners we

908
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,579
can't be afraid of that we have to live

909
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,660
our lives people have to live their

910
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:12,960
lives

911
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:16,140
there's a soul mate waiting for someone

912
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,260
who doesn't already have one

913
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,900
all important things but knowing what to

914
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,760
do if you get sick because you find this

915
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,700
most amazing person in the world and you

916
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,980
get sick but you can do something

917
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,079
health-wise

918
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,000
and you can make a choice on how to heal

919
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,099
yourself but knowing what you're up

920
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,440
against health-wise is good idea too to

921
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:39,720
make a choice as well it's like okay

922
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,280
I know what I'm up against I can do

923
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,520
things there's things I can do for

924
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,520
myself

925
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,500
here's the key Point adrenaline holds

926
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,720
information in the case of adrenaline

927
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:57,420
that was released at highly emotional

928
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,880
times it holds information about fear

929
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,220
hurt betrayal injury or stress overload

930
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,420
we experience in that moment so I know I

931
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,420
was I was saying that anyway

932
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:10,560

933
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,900

941
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,980
relationship laugh out loud

942
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,220
um

943
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:42,119
Brett Winters

944
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,820
how are you Brett

945
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,980
eating fat releases adrenaline to thin

946
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,200
out our blood but it also soaks up

947
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,460
adrenaline explain indeed so you're

948
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,700
talking about medical meme information

949
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,140
so what happens is that when we eat a

950
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,960
lot of fat

951
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:00,240
it takes adrenaline to try to become a

952
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,460
blood thinner for that fat so if you're

953
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,560
eating tacos load it with you know

954
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,420
greasy fat you're eating pizzas you're

955
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,880
eating fried or you're eating buffalo

956
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,880
chicken wings

957
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,859
in a bar somewhere whatever you're

958
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,099
eating these things

959
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:19,920
you're eating pulled pork sandwiches

960
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:22,619
mac and cheese whatever it is all that

961
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,400
fat that butter or that oil that grease

962
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:28,680
that animal fat or plant fat too A lot

963
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,099
of people take a ton of plant fat right

964
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:36,060
so all of that fat

965
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,560
is there we innately eat all of that to

966
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,359
sop up

967
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,300
the adrenaline

968
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:45,540
right that's the Comfort zop up

969
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:49,140
but Brett at the same time all that fat

970
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,839
we're eating is releasing adrenaline

971
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:54,119
to try to blood thin it so to try to do

972
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,040
like a blood thinner so we don't get a

973
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,700
heart attack so we don't stroke out so

974
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,680
we don't get a a clog

975
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,420
so we can get oxygen to our brain

976
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,700
because the more fat we eat the less

977
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,800
oxygen we get to our brain

978
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,000
mm info

979
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,000
I have to say that now

980
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,880
imagine that

981
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:20,339
the world we've we now live in okay

982
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,560
so when that happens

983
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:25,740
that occurs too so it's a vicious cycle

984
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,540
it's a catch-22 exactly that but keep in

985
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,920
mind this

986
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,420
when we're not going through an

987
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,180
emotional hardship we're not going

988
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:36,599
through a stress moment or a big Trigger

989
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,800
or PTSD everybody is still eating fat

990
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,900
because they're addicted to the

991
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,540
adrenaline cycle the adren adrenaline

992
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,160
surge so they can't break away from all

993
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,859
that cacao

994
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,500
that fatty cacao they can't break away

995
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:51,660
from those cupcakes and the donuts they

996
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,460
can't break away from the vegan donuts

997
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,200
and vegan cupcakes and the pizzas and

998
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,820
the vegan pizzas they love the vegan

999
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,800
pizzas because they're loaded with oil

1000
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,240
there's no fat free vegan pizza in a

1001
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,040
restaurant

1002
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,920

moment

1083
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:12,660

1085
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:18,060
too when you go out and get your vegan

1086
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,220
pizza things loaded with MSG you just

1087
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,420
don't know it but it's loaded versus

1088
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,400
when you're at home and you're making

1089
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,380

00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,660
when you're in restaurants or eating out

1102
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,119

Banna says after suffering from severe

1133
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,640
acne I am finally much better following

1134
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,099
medical medium morning cleanse even not

1135
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,640
a hundred percent

1136
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:30,060
now I want to be fully raw I am afraid

1137
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:34,640
of detoxing in the form

1138
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,640
of acne what can I do about it

1139
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,260
okay we can't live in fear

1140
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,880
it's just part of being here on planet

1141
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,980
mess

1142
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,300
part of being here in plant stress

1143
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,780
planet Earth

1144
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,220
okay we can't live in fear right moving

1145
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,960
forward with our health and doing the

1146
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,359
right things

1147
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:59,880
is always important to do

1148
00:46:54,359 --> 00:47:02,880
and we can't be afraid

1149
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,339
but if you're doing the morning cleanse

1150
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,079
and you're getting relief incredible

1151
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:08,640
then that's what you do

1152
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,099
there's nothing wrong with that you can

1153
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,200
go slower you can do it in with an ease

1154
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:14,819
you can add little things in at a time

1155
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,560
when you read the medical medium books

1156
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:18,780
you can talk to your doctor too about

1157
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,180
what you feel is good or your doctor

1158
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,980
feels as good I mean but you can take it

1159
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,200
baby steps you can just do morning

1160
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,420
cleanses and morning cleanses it is and

1161
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,920
only that and that's all you do that's

1162
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,780
fine

1163
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,520
and if things are in a great place

1164
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,440
because of that then that's where you

1165
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,880
are

1166
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,859
so yeah

1167
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,300
and a lot of a lot of times with acne a

1168
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:41,040
lot of people they're just trapped in it

1169
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,859
and they have to push through to get to

1170
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,020
the other side takes time for a lot of

1171
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,400
different people but a lot of people it

1172
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,020
could just be like yeah you're doing

1173
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,599
that one thing celery juice or a morning

1174
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,619
cleanse and that's what you're doing and

1175
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,619
you're in a good place

1176
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,319
note not everything is detox too I I

1177
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,500
apologize by the way that I haven't

1178
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:13,319
gotten the medical medium Detox episode

1179
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:18,079
out on the medical meme podcast

1180
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:18,079
letting you know I've been working on it

1181
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,560
I have I have

1182
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,200
and I'm going to work on a lot of

1183
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,060
episodes too with medical meme podcasts

1184
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,700
just mind-blowing stuff

1185
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:33,140
like for the next few months like

1186
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,140
seriously some great stuff

1187
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,960
what happens is if you have strep

1188
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,460
bacteria a lot of times when people

1189
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,980
cleanse

1190
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,780
that strep is dying off that strep is

1191
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:48,060
actually clearing out of the system it's

1192
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,740
moving out of your system you're

1193
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:52,560
starving that strep

1194
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:55,200
but a lot of times you know acne can be

1195
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,480
a detox

1196
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,819
in the sense where if you're killing off

1197
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,680
a whole bunch of it

1198
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:04,140
keep that in mind so a lot of people

1199
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,000
I've seen where and straps a really good

1200
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,700
topic right now a lot of people they'll

1201
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,440
have three or four or even 10 varieties

1202
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,119
of strep in their system they're just

1203
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,200
loaded it's all through their intestinal

1204
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,200
tract

1205
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,880
I just riddled in their intestinal tract

1206
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,619
it's in their liver it's all in their

1207
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,839
lymphatic system they got acne on their

1208
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:24,119
chest they got acne on their back acne

1209
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,099
on their neck they got acne on their

1210
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:28,800
temples they acne on their face their

1211
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:31,440
nose are just loaded with acne they got

1212
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,900
a lot of strep in them they got

1213
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,900
um antibiotic resistant varieties of

1214
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,839
acne in them and the minute you start

1215
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,700
dumping stuff in there to just keep

1216
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,980
basically you're killing off the strep

1217
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,839
there's a lot of toxins coming from the

1218
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,460
bacterias as you know as it's also

1219
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,800
exploding that can happen too if

1220
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:52,160
someone's so fully loaded what I mean so

1221
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,780
fully loaded people got diverticulosis

1222
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,180
diverticulitis they got styes they got

1223
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,140
UTIs constantly there's people out there

1224
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,780
though

1225
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,180
literally shrep is running their whole

1226
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:05,280
life and we got to push it out of them

1227
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:07,079
if you have strep bacteria

1228
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,140
you'll have acne at some point in your

1229
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,599
life that's not detox it's just a

1230
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:15,599
symptom of strep bacteria

1231
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,940
you will get acne one day if you have

1232
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:20,460
strep we can't blame everything on detox

1233
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,660
that gets people in trouble it does get

1234
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,880
people in trouble when we blame

1235
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,920
everything on detox too well a lot of

1236
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,319
people don't realize if they have strep

1237
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,300
they'll have acne at some point in their

1238
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,640
life if they have strep so that that's

1239
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,079
important to keep in mind too but there

1240
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,319
is this thing

1241
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,800
as I was saying before if someone's so

1242
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:43,380
loaded with so many varieties

1243
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,060
and now we're pulling Foods away from

1244
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,579
that strep

1245
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:49,800
and we're releasing all that old stored

1246
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:52,440
up antibiotics that they took for years

1247
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,599
that's in their liver and we're moving

1248
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,000
all this stuff about

1249
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:58,559
yeah I mean they can they can just be

1250
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,540
sitting there with their acne that

1251
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,400
they've had all along until it finally

1252
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:04,380
starts clearing up blaming everything

1253
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,960
though on detox

1254
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:09,200
came outside of the medical medium

1255
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,200
community

1256
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,900
people who don't know what the true

1257
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,980
causes of their symptoms and conditions

1258
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,140
are

1259
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,240
that's an important note for anybody

1260
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:20,460
who's paying attention anybody who's

1261
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,319
listening that's a really critical note

1262
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,839
right there blaming everything on detox

1263
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,400
is not a medical medium Community thing

1264
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:28,619
or medical medium books and information

1265
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,839
thing I think everything's just blamed

1266
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:33,300
on detox oh that's detox oh what's that

1267
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:35,420
that's detox oh that's detox first of

1268
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,420
all

1269
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:42,660
that's just not correct the correct way

1270
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,660
it should be handled

1271
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:47,760
that's just a term a blanket statement

1272
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:49,200
and term that was created because people

1273
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,700
don't know why people are sick and

1274
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,740
what's wrong with them and that came

1275
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,720
from outside of the community

1276
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:57,900
that's where that came from from people

1277
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,819
that did not know influencers or whoever

1278
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:02,400
are practitioners that did not know why

1279
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:03,720
someone had a symptom or condition so

1280
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,819
they'll start blaming everything about

1281
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,140
detox Pathways that are being clogged

1282
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:09,300
they'll be like oh that's because your

1283
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,559
detox pathways are being clogged that's

1284
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,240
because you don't know your detox

1285
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,800
Pathways really do you know your detox

1286
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,619
pathways

1287
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:20,220
you know acne for example acne is not

1288
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:23,280
because your detox pathways are clogged

1289
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:25,380
it's because you have strep

1290
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,180
all this is important information for so

1291
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,400
many people that are looking for this

1292
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,140
these tidbits

1293
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,900
as I see out there people do ask about

1294
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:35,640
it I've seen a lot of questions

1295
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,500
so keep in mind the whole blame

1296
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:40,260
everything on detox is not a medical

1297
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,599
medium thing if you read all eight

1298
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,640
medical textbooks

1299
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,200
you're not going to see riddled all

1300
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,359
through these eight medical textbooks

1301
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,400
that everything's detox and everything

1302
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:52,260
everything is detox just blame

1303
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,000
everything on there blame that symptom

1304
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,440
that condition on detox you're not going

1305
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,359
to see that you look through the

1306
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,420
symptoms and conditions of all these

1307
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:03,119
diseases and symptoms right of all these

1308
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:06,180
conditions and illnesses and sicknesses

1309
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:10,319
in these books you don't see a blanket

1310
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:13,020
thing oh that's detox oh that's detox

1311
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:14,339
nerve pain isn't your detox Pathways

1312
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:17,099
clogged

1313
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:18,119
it's viral it's injuries it's all kinds

1314
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:20,640
of stuff but it's not your detox

1315
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,800
Pathways clogged I'm giving you just a

1316
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,140
little tidbit of what would be in the

1317
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,740
medical medium detox

1318
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,740
podcast

1319
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:37,339
don't mind I am going to sip a little

1320
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,339
bit here

1321
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,900
okay

1322
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,559
let's also not forget about the other

1323
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,180
school of emotions and eating I just

1324
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,579
want to cover the other school because I

1325
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,400
feel bad I only covered the first school

1326
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:55,500
the one school can I cover the other

1327
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,400
school do we do we have time to do this

1328
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,400
get ready for this

1329
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:05,880
on IG acne also can be caused by thick

1330
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:08,059
bile sludge check about it

1331
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,700
really because science doesn't know that

1332
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:14,160
research doesn't know that

1333
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,859
there's nothing out there there's no

1334
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,260
there's no study

1335
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:21,780
there's no microscope anybody stuck up

1336
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,059
somebody's ass or a microscope that they

1337
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,800
stuck in somebody's throat or a

1338
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:27,960
microscope they stuck into their body

1339
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,079
and into their veins or down into the

1340
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,420
liver that said oh thick bile that must

1341
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:35,640
be why you have acne that doesn't exist

1342
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,319
so there's that's just made up because

1343
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,119
there's no signs of research this has

1344
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,680
ever discovered that that could be why

1345
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:45,260
acne really is

1346
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,260
acne is instead an actual infection

1347
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,339
so keep that in mind it's it's an

1348
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,500
infection it's like a pushed wall an

1349
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:55,319
actual infection

1350
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:57,359
it's an infection

1351
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:59,540
it's not thick bile or anything like

1352
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,540
that

1353
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,280
so I just want to cover that

1354
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,819
let's also not forget about the other

1355
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,099
school of emotions and eating in this

1356
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:15,240
school are folks who prefer to avoid

1357
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:17,460
food when they're in pain emotionally

1358
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,619
so they avoid the food they're not

1359
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,319
running to comfort Foods they're not

1360
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:24,300
shoving down a pizza they're not pushing

1361
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:28,140
something deep down inside

1362
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:30,540
so this is a group of people that shut

1363
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:34,619
off the spigot they're just like no I'm

1364
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:36,720
not gonna eat I'm not gonna eat

1365
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:38,700
in this school are folks who prefer to

1366
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,579
avoid food when they're in emotional

1367
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:43,559
pain often triggered because their

1368
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:47,280
emotions have taken away their appetite

1369
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:50,520
or made them feel sick I'm so sick from

1370
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,220
that betrayal oh my God I'm sick I gotta

1371
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,480
pull this knife out of my back

1372
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:57,420
and

1373
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,540
I just can't eat right now I'm so

1374
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:03,420
disgusted I'm so upset I'm so angry I'm

1375
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:06,000
so emotional I'm in so much pain

1376
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,920
emotionally I can't handle it I can't

1377
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,900
eat there's no way I'm putting food in

1378
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,260
my stomach right now there's no freaking

1379
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:17,119
way I'm ever gonna stick food in my

1380
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,119
stomach right now when I'm upset

1381
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,520
this approach can turn into an addiction

1382
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,960
to having no appetite it can I've seen a

1383
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,420
lot of people they're emotionally hit

1384
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,859
every minute every which way and they

1385
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,440
just can't eat

1386
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:34,520
so it becomes an addiction

1387
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,520
to not eat

1388
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:43,619
over there in IG yes that's me I stop

1389
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,740
eating

1390
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:49,319
um start the Gypsy medium

1391
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:52,260
and then Rainbow Bright says so there is

1392
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:54,920
no detox acne just an ongoing infection

1393
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,920
correct

1394
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,940
yes it's always because of strep if you

1395
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:04,980
are cleansing it

1396
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:08,359
there can be some die off but it's

1397
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,359
caused by strep either way

1398
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:16,800
I can't tell you how many people have

1399
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:18,960
used mm info completely I've gotten rid

1400
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,000
of their strep debilitating strep

1401
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,740
covered their whole body

1402
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,099
gotten rid of it

1403
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:28,260
use the protocols made sure they weren't

1404
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:31,380
feeding it with the the you know the

1405
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:33,059
foods that will feed it right making

1406
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,640
sure they do all that and then they get

1407
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:38,280
into a new relationship

1408
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:40,440
they pick up a brand new strap or two

1409
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,059
and they start getting some other form

1410
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,800
of acne

1411
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:45,359
and then they have to do it again have

1412
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,920
to clean up and make sure you know

1413
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,660
they're fighting to clean it up and do

1414
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,859
the right protocols and boom get rid of

1415
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:53,599
it

1416
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:56,099
journey sg1 I am going to read

1417
00:57:53,599 --> 00:58:00,599
that comment there

1418
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:04,079
acne is also said to be hormones yes

1419
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:05,640
it's said to be hormones no it's not

1420
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,559
hormones now there's going to be a bunch

1421
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,599
of people that say okay that he just

1422
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:12,240
lost me there he lost me it's hormones

1423
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,240
hormones hormones hormones hormones

1424
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:18,359
people don't realize is that strep Ebbs

1425
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,819
and flows with the immune system

1426
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:24,119
and so with women their immune system

1427
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:26,760
drops during their cycle it drops during

1428
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:29,460
menstruation it drops during ovulation

1429
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:33,420
it drops during pregnancies and

1430
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:37,200
childbirth it drops monthly

1431
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,859
it drops during puberty with

1432
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,099
um

1433
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:42,359
with both both and what happened here's

1434
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:44,040
what's important so here's what's

1435
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:47,099
interesting

1436
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:49,200
anytime there's an anytime there is a

1437
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:50,940
hormone change

1438
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:54,000
keep that in mind

1439
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:56,160
whether it's puberty or menstruation or

1440
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,760
ovulation

1441
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,700
or something happening

1442
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:05,220
hormonally right a hormonal change the

1443
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:08,099
immune system drops and for women the

1444
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:10,619
immune system drops

1445
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:13,079
keep that in mind

1446
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:14,760
the Divine list says blaming hormone is

1447
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:18,020
propaganda to make women blame

1448
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:21,900
themselves that's true

1449
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:25,339
into the wild Blues yep I also break out

1450
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,339
with acne when I'm sick

1451
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:31,640
yep I always break out with acne when

1452
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,640
I'm sick

1453
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:37,020
so what happens is that we break out

1454
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,359
with acne because when we're sick the

1455
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:41,520
immune system drops and then strep Rises

1456
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,200
up very important to know that like

1457
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,460
that's how it works strep is always an

1458
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,380
infection

1459
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:49,980
it's always inside our body living in

1460
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:52,079
our body it's an ongoing strep infection

1461
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:55,319
when we when our immune system is

1462
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:57,180
compromised like say betrayal or an

1463
00:59:55,319 --> 00:59:59,720
adrenaline surge because we're totally

1464
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:04,020
stressed out from something

1465
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:05,099
yeah adrenaline hormonal immune system

1466
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:08,099
drops

1467
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:09,540
strep acts up and Rises

1468
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:12,599
menstruation

1469
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:15,720
immune system drops in women strep Rises

1470
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:17,220
up so that's why there was a connect the

1471
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,700
dots

1472
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:24,359
from mainstream medicine

1473
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:27,240
mainstream medicine said that acne is

1474
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:31,380
caused by hormones mainstream medicine

1475
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:33,359
was only noting that it happened to a

1476
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,220
lot of people when there was a hormone

1477
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:38,099
shift

1478
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:39,960
acne rose up but did not know why

1479
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:43,400
because the immune system drops and then

1480
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,400
strep gets stronger

1481
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:53,880
so much information

1482
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,799
I can't stop myself I said it keeps on

1483
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,359
coming out

1484
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:58,380
yeah

1485
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,420
okay

1486
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:05,599
so there's a whole bunch of people that

1487
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:05,599
literally say my life is out of control

1488
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,819
my life is out of control I just my PTSD

1489
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:16,079
is out of control I just got hurt again

1490
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:18,359
my trust was broken I was betrayed

1491
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,099
I just got into a confrontation I just

1492
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:22,559
people don't understand me I'm not

1493
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:23,819
understood I'm not validated no one

1494
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,920
understands me

1495
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:28,079
I'm not going to eat because guess what

1496
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,180
I can't control other people and I can't

1497
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,220
control the crap happening to me and I

1498
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:34,079
can't control the difficult time I'm in

1499
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,240
I can't control the relationship that

1500
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,799
was you know my boyfriend just broke up

1501
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,599
with me or my girlfriend just broke up

1502
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:43,260
with me I can't control any of it so

1503
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:45,960
what I can control is food

1504
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:48,119
so if I can't control anything else I'm

1505
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:51,599
definitely not eating because I will

1506
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:53,940
definitely not eat because I will

1507
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,280
control my eating I will control my food

1508
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,680
I am going to use that

1509
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,900
I'm sick I don't want to eat I'm sick of

1510
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,940
my stomach I don't want to eat so I am

1511
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:04,619
now going to be like no I can't control

1512
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:07,220
anything else out there so I'm going to

1513
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:07,220
control my food

1514
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,540
they already feel that they don't have

1515
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:14,400
control over their environment or

1516
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:16,440
situations happening around them or

1517
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,260
people in their life and so whether

1518
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:22,260
consciously or subconsciously they try

1519
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:25,500
to exert extreme control over what they

1520
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,900
put into their mouths

1521
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:30,180
people from the other school those who

1522
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:32,280
overeat often struggle with loss of

1523
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,540
control too they happen to have a

1524
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,119
different way of dealing with the

1525
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:38,579
sensation for those who withhold food

1526
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,619
while food cravings may still surface

1527
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:44,280
and surface intensely they're even

1528
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:46,440
stronger craving is not to eat or to eat

1529
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,980
very little that's what they do to try

1530
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:52,200
to hold control and maintain control one

1531
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,599
doesn't always stay in this path or

1532
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,940
pattern forever sometimes hunger can

1533
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:59,280
become so overpowering because the body

1534
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:01,020
can only function for so long with

1535
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,400
adrenaline filling the critically needed

1536
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,319
blood sugar

1537
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,480
to the point that somebody ends up

1538
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:08,819
switching over to the other schools so

1539
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,740
the school switch the schools switch a

1540
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:15,119
lot they switch a lot

1541
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:17,940
eating a lot when I get hurt emotionally

1542
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:20,760
switches to not eating at all

1543
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:23,640
eating not at all switches to eating

1544
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,619
emotionally eating a lot of it a lot of

1545
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,799
