[154.88 - 161.76] i never ever could believe when i was a
[159.04 - 163.12] kid and i was laying in a wild blueberry
[161.76 - 165.04] field
[163.12 - 167.52] i know i told you guys this before but i
[165.04 - 169.92] just i couldn't believe it i was just
[167.52 - 172.32] laying in the sea of wild blueberries
[169.92 - 174.72] around me right
[172.32 - 175.92] and the birds were just flying by above
[174.72 - 178.48] me
[175.92 - 180.96] and some clouds would come and the sun
[178.48 - 182.16] was out and i'd be laying in those
[180.96 - 184.08] glorious
[182.16 - 185.52] blueberry field right with blue
[184.08 - 188.16] blueberries just
[185.52 - 189.76] being in the sun hitting that minute
[188.16 - 191.76] beaming
[189.76 - 195.84] and spirit of compassion telling me the
[191.76 - 197.84] power they had and how amazing they were
[195.84 - 199.44] right for the body and health and the
[197.84 - 201.12] antioxidant
[199.44 - 204.48] levels
[201.12 - 206.00] an entirely different beast all together
[204.48 - 207.64] in the food world because that's what
[206.00 - 209.44] everybody's up against are up against
[207.64 - 210.80] oxidation
[209.44 - 213.84] so everything we're up against is
[210.80 - 216.40] oxidation right now that's what it is
[213.84 - 218.56] chemicals toxocapa metals pathogens
[216.40 - 220.88] whatever it is it's oxidation it's like
[218.56 - 222.96] oxidizing the body right acids
[220.88 - 225.68] everybody's acidic and we just sit there
[222.96 - 226.72] and we oxidize we oxidize we age really
[225.68 - 228.32] quick
[226.72 - 230.16] and then we just we're set up for
[228.32 - 231.44] disease we're set up for sickness you
[230.16 - 234.64] know that's what happens you love the
[231.44 - 235.60] juice lifelong amazing
[234.64 - 237.60] yep
[235.60 - 239.92] incredible incredible now this isn't the
[237.60 - 241.76] cultivated blueberry this is the wild
[239.92 - 244.16] blueberry huge difference right there
[241.76 - 246.24] all on its own the cultivated blueberry
[244.16 - 249.20] is an empty
[246.24 - 250.48] like an empty shell it's it's yeah it's
[249.20 - 251.84] healthy
[250.48 - 254.64] but
[251.84 - 256.56] big difference between wild blueberries
[254.64 - 259.04] and cultivated blueberries something to
[256.56 - 261.12] know right there cultivated blueberries
[259.04 - 262.40] the big blueberries in the clam shells
[261.12 - 264.64] you go to the store you get the little
[262.40 - 267.68] clamshell pack
[264.64 - 270.00] and you open the clamshell right
[267.68 - 271.52] and you got the big blueberries in there
[270.00 - 273.28] i mean
[271.52 - 275.20] they're okay for our health just like
[273.28 - 277.84] any fruit
[275.20 - 281.12] but a wild food is an entirely different
[277.84 - 282.48] situation so what happens is
[281.12 - 285.60] you can burn
[282.48 - 287.52] the wild blueberry to the ground burn it
[285.60 - 288.88] to the ground
[287.52 - 292.40] right
[288.88 - 293.12] and it will grow back up it'll grow back
[292.40 - 297.04] up
[293.12 - 300.08] you burn an oak tree down
[297.04 - 303.12] you burn a thousand-year-old oak tree
[300.08 - 306.00] down it won't come back up
[303.12 - 307.92] you need an acorn
[306.00 - 308.80] being carried
[307.92 - 311.84] by
[308.80 - 314.80] a bird
[311.84 - 317.36] or a squirrel you need an acorn
[314.80 - 320.64] and plant that acorn in the ground in
[317.36 - 322.56] hopes that that oak tree grows right
[320.64 - 326.24] when it comes down to the wild blueberry
[322.56 - 327.84] plant you can burn it to the earth
[326.24 - 331.28] scorching
[327.84 - 334.40] scorching flames and it grows back up
[331.28 - 337.04] and it has survived the tundra
[334.40 - 338.48] thousands and thousands of years of cold
[337.04 - 340.16] drought
[338.48 - 342.48] right everything
[340.16 - 345.52] and it's that kind of food that takes it
[342.48 - 346.88] to another level so that's a wild food
[345.52 - 348.40] and that's what i love you guys you came

[434.84 - 438.72] incredible right
[437.60 - 441.28] i'm going to make a couple of drinks
[438.72 - 442.16] with this incredible juice
[441.28 - 443.92] so
[442.16 - 445.84] i just want to run down a couple of
[443.92 - 447.84] things first of all you know i work with
[445.84 - 449.20] wyman's because i want this stuff to
[447.84 - 452.00] stick around
[449.20 - 453.68] because what it takes to harvest
[452.00 - 455.84] these wild blueberries
[453.68 - 461.20] in this one little window of the year
[455.84 - 465.12] this one little window in north america
[461.20 - 467.92] right up in maine it's one little window
[465.12 - 470.16] you only get this one shot to harvest
[467.92 - 472.40] these babies that's it
[470.16 - 475.92] and then to harvest them
[472.40 - 479.20] and then to put them in a press
[475.92 - 481.12] to squeeze the juice out of them
[479.20 - 482.08] not an easy process
[481.12 - 483.36] right
[482.08 - 486.00] to get
[483.36 - 487.36] a wild medicine because that's what i
[486.00 - 489.28] call it that's what i call this my
[487.36 - 491.20] family calls it that's what i call it
[489.28 - 493.60] see that says i've been drinking it for
[491.20 - 495.84] eight months all of my friends keep
[493.60 - 498.80] telling me how pretty my skin looks it's
[495.84 - 501.52] the antioxidants on facebook incredible
[498.80 - 503.92] zanette on facebook
[501.52 - 508.24] antioxidants so what's the difference
[503.92 - 510.56] why does the wild blueberry antioxidants
[508.24 - 514.16] make a difference right
[510.56 - 517.04] entirely different than the clamshell
[514.16 - 519.04] case you know you get the clamshell
[517.04 - 521.20] half pine or pint whatever it is right
[519.04 - 524.08] you get the little pint-sized clamshell
[521.20 - 525.92] cultivated blueberries
[524.08 - 526.96] i won't even get those it's not that i'm
[525.92 - 528.88] a snob
[526.96 - 530.32] it's not that i'm snob
[528.88 - 532.24] you know when i go in the store and i
[530.32 - 533.36] see those i'm like no i'm i'm not
[532.24 - 535.60] getting that
[533.36 - 537.44] you know i want to drink
[535.60 - 539.36] i want to drink that
[537.44 - 541.44] blue gold i want to drink it i want to
[539.36 - 543.44] drink that gold and
[541.44 - 546.72] so because you know what happens is the
[543.44 - 549.28] the regular cultivated blueberry
[546.72 - 551.36] doesn't have that anthocyanin level it
[549.28 - 553.52] just doesn't have it doesn't have that
[551.36 - 555.20] polyphenol level it doesn't have that
[553.52 - 556.40] link is in the description guys i'm
[555.20 - 557.76] going to make a couple of drinks but i
[556.40 - 559.60] just want to talk about the wild
[557.76 - 561.44] blueberry a little bit and why the juice
[559.60 - 563.52] is so critical and the whole bit and why
[561.44 - 566.08] i'm so happy about the fact that it
[563.52 - 568.16] exists the fact that they press this
[566.08 - 571.12] stuff and they put it in the bottle so
[568.16 - 573.04] when i look at the bottle i'm like
[571.12 - 576.48] what's in here right
[573.04 - 579.12] no citric acid no msg no natural flavors
[576.48 - 580.40] no garbage no hidden stuff thrown in
[579.12 - 583.04] there
[580.40 - 584.80] right no fortified
[583.04 - 586.80] bs
[584.80 - 589.36] none of that no fillers hidden
[586.80 - 591.52] underneath at all right none of that so
[589.36 - 592.72] that's important you guys
[591.52 - 594.00] it's one thing right there that's
[592.72 - 596.64] incredible right
[594.00 - 602.24] not from concentrate nothing's added and
[596.64 - 605.84] it's not hpp baby no way is it hpp
[602.24 - 607.68] dang right hpp
[605.84 - 609.68] bad
[607.68 - 612.48] and that's what i love about it
[609.68 - 615.84] high pressure pasteurization is bad and
[612.48 - 617.52] this isn't hpp
[615.84 - 621.44] so and that's what i love about it right
[617.52 - 623.68] there it's incredible serena says
[621.44 - 625.52] that new one well yeah well this is a
[623.68 - 627.52] what
[625.52 - 628.88] i'm gonna pour a glass of wine in a
[627.52 - 632.24] little bit
[628.88 - 634.24] invite my doctor friends over
[632.24 - 636.40] mm-hmm they graduated from the best
[634.24 - 637.44] medical university
[636.40 - 638.64] they're here they have their own
[637.44 - 641.44] practice they're coming over they're
[638.64 - 643.28] gonna have a glass of wine with me
[641.44 - 645.52] we're gonna do some wine tasting here
[643.28 - 646.40] and we're going to see how dry the wine
[645.52 - 649.52] is
[646.40 - 649.52] and how good the wine is
[649.60 - 652.32] so i want to talk about the difference
[651.44 - 653.92] like when we're talking about
[652.32 - 655.12] antioxidant power
[653.92 - 657.04] why like
[655.12 - 658.80] zanette was saying her skin looks good
[657.04 - 661.92] after drinking it for eight months and
[658.80 - 666.48] what's happening with that right
[661.92 - 668.96] antioxidants stop you from oxidizing
[666.48 - 671.20] that's the whole point oxidizing means
[668.96 - 673.20] you're you're dying
[671.20 - 676.16] that's what we do we spend a lifetime
[673.20 - 677.44] oxidizing until we're finally
[676.16 - 680.56] gone
[677.44 - 680.56] that's how it works right
[681.60 - 684.64] i don't know what's going to happen once
[682.88 - 686.80] i start drinking this i'm already
[684.64 - 689.04] getting kind of silly now just talking i
[686.80 - 691.12] don't even know when i start drinking
[689.04 - 692.64] this it could get really bad
[691.12 - 694.72] all right
[692.64 - 696.96] i'm gonna get drunk on this stuff
[694.72 - 698.56] today i'm gonna get drunk on this stuff
[696.96 - 700.96] all right so we're talking about the
[698.56 - 704.32] antioxidants right
[700.96 - 707.76] so manganese
[704.32 - 710.40] manganese not magnesium
[707.76 - 711.92] manganese okay
[710.40 - 713.12] manganese
[711.92 - 716.00] is the
[713.12 - 718.32] mineral
[716.00 - 720.16] trace mineral that connects the dot with
[718.32 - 721.44] the antioxidant
[720.16 - 722.40] i'm just telling you right now how it
[721.44 - 724.24] works
[722.40 - 727.92] manganese helps to connect the dot with
[724.24 - 730.00] the antioxidant it helps the antioxidant
[727.92 - 732.32] work
[730.00 - 733.84] and so what wild blueberries have in
[732.32 - 735.92] them
[733.84 - 736.88] and the wyman's wild blueberry juice has
[735.92 - 737.60] in it
[736.88 - 739.44] is
[737.60 - 742.16] manganese
[739.44 - 745.04] so it's high in manganese now if you get
[742.16 - 747.12] a you know if you get a batch of wild
[745.04 - 748.88] blueberries
[747.12 - 751.12] and you can get them that one time in
[748.88 - 752.32] your in that year or you get some frozen
[751.12 - 754.64] wild blueberries
[752.32 - 756.40] they have it in there too right when you
[754.64 - 757.76] press it
[756.40 - 760.56] and press it
[757.76 - 763.28] and it's in its potency like this
[760.56 - 766.40] takes it even to another level right
[763.28 - 770.00] which is incredible but manganese
[766.40 - 772.72] is that dot connector for an antioxidant
[770.00 - 774.88] to actually work
[772.72 - 776.96] and so
[774.88 - 778.48] when it's high in manganese
[776.96 - 780.32] naturally occurring because the wild
[778.48 - 783.28] blueberry is so high in manganese it's
[780.32 - 785.28] insane freaking insane actually
[783.28 - 787.92] because of that
[785.28 - 790.08] any antioxidants that you got cooking
[787.92 - 792.32] inside that wild blueberry the dots
[790.08 - 794.72] connect it when that dot's connected
[792.32 - 796.96] stuff happens in your life and your
[794.72 - 799.52] health stuff starts to happen and that's
[796.96 - 800.72] a big part of it right there
[799.52 - 801.92] so we're gonna make some drinks we're
[800.72 - 803.52] gonna have some fun i'm making wild
[801.92 - 806.00] blueberry hibiscus iced tea and i'm
[803.52 - 808.48] gonna be making wild blueberry lemonade
[806.00 - 810.32] i'm excited about this right
[808.48 - 812.72] it lasts it lasts a long time the
[810.32 - 816.40] refrigerator you crack it open you do
[812.72 - 818.32] two ounces a day for your health
[816.40 - 820.24] that's what you crack it open you do two
[818.32 - 823.44] ounces a day you do four ounces a day
[820.24 - 825.92] whatever you'd like to do okay
[823.44 - 827.52] and i'm going to get some ice too in a
[825.92 - 830.16] second as well

[840.00 - 845.44] shots and
[843.04 - 848.16] i'm sipping my shot
[845.44 - 848.16] i'm like a wimp
[851.12 - 857.52] that stuff is harsh man
[853.68 - 859.28] there's vodka in that one
[857.52 - 860.64] there's no vodka in that one it's
[859.28 - 863.52] straight wild blueberry juice and it's
[860.64 - 866.96] not harsh it's delicious and it's fun
[863.52 - 869.36] and it tastes good it's incredible
[866.96 - 869.36] all right

[876.96 - 880.88] blessed i've been very fortunate and
[878.48 - 882.84] lucky to actually be walking through a
[880.88 - 885.84] wild blueberry
[882.84 - 887.92] field when i was younger
[885.84 - 891.52] and
[887.92 - 893.36] you can feel it the energy
[891.52 - 895.44] and when you lay on the earth with those
[893.36 - 896.84] wild blueberry plants
[895.44 - 898.40] they're
[896.84 - 902.32] humming
[898.40 - 902.32] the dragonflies are flying around
[902.40 - 907.20] honeybees are kind of
[904.40 - 907.20] jumping around
[907.52 - 911.28] and you got those beautiful wild
[909.36 - 913.04] blueberries just sitting on top of the
[911.28 - 915.92] plants
[913.04 - 919.28] and the wind is blowing through them and
[915.92 - 922.08] they're kind of all doing this thing
[919.28 - 924.96] and it's beautiful and it is incredible
[922.08 - 927.44] experience and you can feel the energy
[924.96 - 930.80] and the frequency of the wild blueberry
[927.44 - 932.48] plant with the wild blueberries on
[930.80 - 934.88] right there right there
[932.48 - 936.00] on display

[939.04 - 943.20] and you lay in that field and it's an
[941.04 - 944.72] experience all on its own
[943.20 - 948.00] and when i think about the fact that
[944.72 - 952.00] that's bottled and put into

[1027.84 - 1032.16] understand it out there and i was

[1435.28 - 1438.24] order and you get five percent off from
[1436.72 - 1440.80] there on out with the subscription it's
[1438.24 - 1443.44] insane i mean how incredible is that
[1440.80 - 1445.60] lucy does it doesn't it lose nutritional
[1443.44 - 1448.24] value once it's juiced and bottled it
[1445.60 - 1450.72] doesn't that's the incredible thing
[1448.24 - 1451.76] the wild blueberry
[1450.72 - 1454.96] right
[1451.76 - 1457.04] gets more accessible to the body
[1454.96 - 1459.36] when frozen
[1457.04 - 1461.84] right or put in a bottle and that's
[1459.36 - 1464.88] another thing people don't realize
[1461.84 - 1466.24] okay so it actually helps
[1464.88 - 1467.60] because what happens is there's a big
[1466.24 - 1469.68] difference with the wild blueberry it's
[1467.60 - 1471.52] not a cultivated
[1469.68 - 1473.68] it's not a cultivated
[1471.52 - 1475.12] berry cultivated berries have different
[1473.68 - 1477.44] polyphenols they have different
[1475.12 - 1480.24] antioxidants the whole entire thing so
[1477.44 - 1483.92] it's really incredible what it does
[1480.24 - 1485.60] hpp is not good though so
[1483.92 - 1488.08] what you have to realize
[1485.60 - 1488.96] high pressure pasteurization that's not
[1488.08 - 1491.68] this
[1488.96 - 1494.40] that i don't trust that i don't like i
[1491.68 - 1495.76] do not trust hpp
[1494.40 - 1498.24] that's why i always say people if you do
[1495.76 - 1499.92] your celery juice don't do hpp don't buy
[1498.24 - 1502.00] it like that there's a big difference so
[1499.92 - 1504.08] when you look in here
[1502.00 - 1506.08] it's not from concentrate there's
[1504.08 - 1508.16] nothing in here no citric acid no
[1506.08 - 1511.28] natural flavors no msg no fillers the
[1508.16 - 1513.44] whole bit let's make another drink
[1511.28 - 1515.92] angela how much do we use in the heavy
[1513.44 - 1518.80] metal detox smoothie as a sub for two
[1515.92 - 1520.00] cups of wild blueberries
[1518.80 - 1521.84] now
[1520.00 - 1522.88] this is potent stuff
[1521.84 - 1524.32] okay
[1522.88 - 1527.76] this is potent stuff
[1524.32 - 1529.36] you don't want to throw a bottle of this
[1527.76 - 1531.28] in your
[1529.36 - 1534.88] smoothie like you don't want to take it
[1531.28 - 1534.88] and throw the whole bottle in just like
[1535.92 - 1539.20] until it's done you don't want to do
[1537.20 - 1541.36] that okay
[1539.20 - 1543.12] all right so there's a difference so
[1541.36 - 1544.48] with this it's like if you want to do
[1543.12 - 1546.32] the heavy metal detox smoothie you could
[1544.48 - 1548.48] do two to four ounces throw it in there
[1546.32 - 1550.48] four ounces is good boom four ounces if
[1548.48 - 1552.48] you want to do a smoothie
[1550.48 - 1554.00] you can even get away with two ounces if
[1552.48 - 1556.64] you wanted to do that in a smoothie you
[1554.00 - 1558.56] can get away with that
[1556.64 - 1561.52] if you don't have your wild blueberries
[1558.56 - 1561.52] or anything like that
[1561.68 - 1567.12] so it's ten percent off on a case
[1565.60 - 1568.32] or even three bottles if you want to get
[1567.12 - 1570.64] three bottles right if you do a
[1568.32 - 1573.36] subscription it's 10 off first order and
[1570.64 - 1576.56] 5 from there on after the subscription
[1573.36 - 1578.40] is cool that's a great thing to do
[1576.56 - 1580.16] that is amazing so you guys take a look
[1578.40 - 1582.64] at this drink before i move it out of
[1580.16 - 1582.64] the way
[1583.44 - 1587.20] right there it is i'm gonna bring it

[2086.96 - 2091.44] that is exquisite truly the podcast i'm
[2090.40 - 2092.96] going to be doing a whole round of new
[2091.44 - 2094.24] podcasts
[2092.96 - 2095.60] but everybody's going to have to fasten
[2094.24 - 2098.56] their seatbelts with those babies
[2095.60 - 2100.32] because i'm not messing around
[2098.56 - 2102.48] you got to have a stomach for the
[2100.32 - 2105.36] medical medium podcast
[2102.48 - 2105.36] too much truth
[2107.12 - 2109.36] right
[2110.24 - 2113.20] once you get off the other health
[2111.68 - 2115.12] podcasts
[2113.20 - 2116.80] after you've had enough of their their
[2115.12 - 2118.16] bs
[2116.80 - 2120.88] and you get onto the medical media
[2118.16 - 2123.68] podcast your mind just blows up because
[2120.88 - 2123.68] you're like what
[2125.84 - 2130.96] no seriously
[2127.36 - 2133.28] i'm gonna have some some great podcasts
[2130.96 - 2133.28] okay
[2133.44 - 2138.32] thoughts on substituting juice for
[2135.68 - 2141.68] berries in the detox movie
[2138.32 - 2143.44] you can absolutely so many times
[2141.68 - 2145.92] when i don't have the frozen berries
[2143.44 - 2146.96] well first of all i always put the juice
[2145.92 - 2148.72] in
[2146.96 - 2149.84] the heavy metal detox smoothie when i
[2148.72 - 2151.68] make it
[2149.84 - 2154.32] i put the berries and the juice in
[2151.68 - 2155.76] that's what i do right
[2154.32 - 2158.40] so
[2155.76 - 2160.48] i see this as a fine wine
[2158.40 - 2162.24] right
[2160.48 - 2164.48] because first of all it's better than
[2162.24 - 2166.80] wine for a lot of reasons
[2164.48 - 2168.64] right because it's a wild blueberry
[2166.80 - 2171.52] it's an entirely different ratio of
[2168.64 - 2172.72] antioxidants the manganese is off the
[2171.52 - 2173.92] chart
[2172.72 - 2175.60] right
[2173.92 - 2177.44] and that's one thing and there's no
[2175.60 - 2180.40] alcohol
[2177.44 - 2181.92] alcohol destroys
[2180.40 - 2185.44] antioxidants
[2181.92 - 2187.12] alcohol destroys
[2185.44 - 2188.48] chemical compounds phytochemical
[2187.12 - 2190.08] compounds so when people have why it's
[2188.48 - 2190.96] like i'm drinking a glass of wine a
[2190.08 - 2193.20] night
[2190.96 - 2195.28] for my heart or for my health it's like
[2193.20 - 2197.36] okay sounds great and all but that
[2195.28 - 2199.68] alcohol just destroyed all your phyto
[2197.36 - 2200.88] phytochemical compounds in the grapes
[2199.68 - 2202.56] you would have been better off eating a
[2200.88 - 2204.00] handful of grapes or something like that
[2202.56 - 2206.08] right
[2204.00 - 2208.80] but when you're dealing with this this
[2206.08 - 2211.28] is the kind of wine that i serve when
[2208.80 - 2215.16] company comes over people come over
[2211.28 - 2215.16] this is it right here
[2218.88 - 2221.44] i think
[2222.64 - 2228.08] what you got to do is you got to hold
[2224.16 - 2228.96] your hand like this right
[2228.08 - 2231.04] kind of
[2228.96 - 2233.60] move it around a little bit
[2231.04 - 2235.12] like you see everybody do
[2233.60 - 2237.60] like you see all the rich people do
[2235.12 - 2239.84] right all the rich people
[2237.60 - 2242.00] you know
[2239.84 - 2243.76] these rich people are so weird they're
[2242.00 - 2244.96] like their wine is everything they're
[2243.76 - 2248.16] just like
[2244.96 - 2250.88] honey i think this is a good wine indeed
[2248.16 - 2251.92] it's a thousand dollars a bottle
[2250.88 - 2253.52] yes
[2251.92 - 2255.52] it's kind of dry
[2253.52 - 2256.48] hmm
[2255.52 - 2257.76] yes
[2256.48 - 2260.72] you smell
[2257.76 - 2263.75] smell those grapes
[2260.72 - 2265.36] take a sip dear i will
[2263.75 - 2267.68] [Music]
[2265.36 - 2267.68] hmm
[2269.36 - 2274.40] very good
[2270.88 - 2274.40] that's kind of a dry wine
[2276.32 - 2279.80] is this a 1942
[2280.32 - 2284.80] 10 000 a bottle
[2282.64 - 2286.88] i will order twenty thousand bottles at
[2284.80 - 2289.20] ten thousand dollars a bottle for my
