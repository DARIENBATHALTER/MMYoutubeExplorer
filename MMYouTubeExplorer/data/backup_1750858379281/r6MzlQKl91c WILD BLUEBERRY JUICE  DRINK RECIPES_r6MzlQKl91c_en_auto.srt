me

oxidation

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,400
oxidation right now that's what it is

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,560
chemicals toxocapa metals pathogens

oxidizing the body right acids

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,680
everybody's acidic and we just sit there

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,720
and we oxidize we oxidize we age really

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,319
quick

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,159
and then we just we're set up for

101
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,440
disease we're set up for sickness you

102
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,640
know that's what happens you love the

103
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,599
juice lifelong amazing

104
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,599
yep

105
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,920
incredible incredible now this isn't the

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,760
cultivated blueberry this is the wild

107
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,159
blueberry huge difference right there

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,239
all on its own the cultivated blueberry

109
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,200
is an empty

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
like an empty shell it's it's yeah it's

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,840
healthy

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,640
but

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,560
big difference between wild blueberries

114
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,040
and cultivated blueberries something to

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,120
know right there cultivated blueberries

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,400
the big blueberries in the clam shells

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
you go to the store you get the little

118
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,680
clamshell pack

119
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,000
and you open the clamshell right

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,520
and you got the big blueberries in there

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,280
i mean

122
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
they're okay for our health just like

123
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
any fruit

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,120
but a wild food is an entirely different

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,479
situation so what happens is

126
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
you can burn

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,520
the wild blueberry to the ground burn it

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,880
to the ground

129
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,400
right

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,120
and it will grow back up it'll grow back

131
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,040
up

132
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,080
you burn an oak tree down

133
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,120
you burn a thousand-year-old oak tree

134
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,000
down it won't come back up

135
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,919
you need an acorn

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
being carried

137
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,840
by

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,800
a bird

139
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,360
or a squirrel you need an acorn

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,639
and plant that acorn in the ground in

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,560
hopes that that oak tree grows right

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,240
when it comes down to the wild blueberry

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,840
plant you can burn it to the earth

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,280
scorching

145
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,400
scorching flames and it grows back up

146
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,039
and it has survived the tundra

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,479
thousands and thousands of years of cold

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,160
drought

149
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,479
right everything

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,520
and it's that kind of food that takes it

151
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,880

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,280
i'm going to make a couple of drinks

194
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,160
with this incredible juice

195
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,919
so

196
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
i just want to run down a couple of

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,840
things first of all you know i work with

198
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,199
wyman's because i want this stuff to

199
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
stick around

200
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,680
because what it takes to harvest

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,840
these wild blueberries

202
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:41,199
in this one little window of the year

203
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:45,120
this one little window in north america

204
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,919
right up in maine it's one little window

205
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,160
you only get this one shot to harvest

206
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,400
these babies that's it

207
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,919
and then to harvest them

208
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,199
and then to put them in a press

209
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,120
to squeeze the juice out of them

210
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,080
not an easy process

211
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,360
right

212
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,000
to get

213
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,360
a wild medicine because that's what i

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,280
call it that's what i call this my

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,199
family calls it that's what i call it

216
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,599
see that says i've been drinking it for

217
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,840
eight months all of my friends keep

218
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,800
telling me how pretty my skin looks it's

219
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,520
the antioxidants on facebook incredible

220
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,919
zanette on facebook

221
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,240
antioxidants so what's the difference

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,560
why does the wild blueberry antioxidants

223
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,159
make a difference right

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,039
entirely different than the clamshell

225
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,039
case you know you get the clamshell

226
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,200
half pine or pint whatever it is right

227
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,080
you get the little pint-sized clamshell

228
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,920
cultivated blueberries

229
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,959
i won't even get those it's not that i'm

230
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
a snob

231
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,320
it's not that i'm snob

232
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,240
you know when i go in the store and i

233
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,360
see those i'm like no i'm i'm not

234
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,600
getting that

235
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,440
you know i want to drink

236
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,360
i want to drink that

237
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,440
blue gold i want to drink it i want to

238
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,440
drink that gold and

239
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,720
so because you know what happens is the

240
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,279
the regular cultivated blueberry

241
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,360
doesn't have that anthocyanin level it

242
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,519
just doesn't have it doesn't have that

243
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,200
polyphenol level it doesn't have that

244
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,399
link is in the description guys i'm

245
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,760
going to make a couple of drinks but i

246
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,600
just want to talk about the wild

247
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,440
blueberry a little bit and why the juice

248
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
is so critical and the whole bit and why

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,080
i'm so happy about the fact that it

250
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,160
exists the fact that they press this

251
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,120
stuff and they put it in the bottle so

252
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,040
when i look at the bottle i'm like

253
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,480
what's in here right

254
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,120
no citric acid no msg no natural flavors

255
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,399
no garbage no hidden stuff thrown in

256
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,040
there

257
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,800
right no fortified

258
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,800
bs

259
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,360
none of that no fillers hidden

260
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,519
underneath at all right none of that so

261
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,720
that's important you guys

262
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,000
it's one thing right there that's

263
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,640
incredible right

264
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,240
not from concentrate nothing's added and

265
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:05,839
it's not hpp baby no way is it hpp

266
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,680
dang right hpp

267
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,680
bad

268
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,480
and that's what i love about it

269
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,839
high pressure pasteurization is bad and

270
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,519
this isn't hpp

271
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,440
so and that's what i love about it right

272
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,680
there it's incredible serena says

273
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,519
that new one well yeah well this is a

274
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,519
what

275
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,880
i'm gonna pour a glass of wine in a

276
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,240
little bit

277
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,240
invite my doctor friends over

278
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,399
mm-hmm they graduated from the best

279
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
medical university

280
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,640
they're here they have their own

281
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440
practice they're coming over they're

282
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,279
gonna have a glass of wine with me

283
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
we're gonna do some wine tasting here

284
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,399
and we're going to see how dry the wine

285
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,519
is

286
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,519
and how good the wine is

287
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,320
so i want to talk about the difference

288
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,920
like when we're talking about

289
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,120
antioxidant power

290
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,040
why like

291
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,800
zanette was saying her skin looks good

292
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
after drinking it for eight months and

293
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,480
what's happening with that right

294
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,959
antioxidants stop you from oxidizing

295
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,200
that's the whole point oxidizing means

296
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,200
you're you're dying

297
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,160
that's what we do we spend a lifetime

298
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
oxidizing until we're finally

299
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,560
gone

300
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
that's how it works right

301
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
i don't know what's going to happen once

302
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,800
i start drinking this i'm already

303
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,040
getting kind of silly now just talking i

304
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,120
don't even know when i start drinking

305
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,640
this it could get really bad

306
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,720
all right

307
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,959
i'm gonna get drunk on this stuff

308
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,560
today i'm gonna get drunk on this stuff

309
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,959
all right so we're talking about the

310
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,320
antioxidants right

311
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:47,760
so manganese

312
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,399
manganese not magnesium

313
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,920
manganese okay

314
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,120
manganese

315
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,000
is the

316
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,320
mineral

317
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,160
trace mineral that connects the dot with

318
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
the antioxidant

319
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,399
i'm just telling you right now how it

320
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,240
works

321
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,920
manganese helps to connect the dot with

322
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,000
the antioxidant it helps the antioxidant

323
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,320
work

324
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,839
and so what wild blueberries have in

325
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,920
them

326
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,880
and the wyman's wild blueberry juice has

327
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,600
in it

328
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,440
is

329
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,160
manganese

330
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,040
so it's high in manganese now if you get

331
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,120
a you know if you get a batch of wild

332
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,880
blueberries

333
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
and you can get them that one time in

334
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,320
your in that year or you get some frozen

335
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,639
wild blueberries

336
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,399
they have it in there too right when you

337
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,760
press it

338
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,560
and press it

339
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,279
and it's in its potency like this

340
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,399
takes it even to another level right

341
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:50,000
which is incredible but manganese

342
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,720
is that dot connector for an antioxidant

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,880
to actually work

344
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,959
and so

345
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,480
when it's high in manganese

346
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,320
naturally occurring because the wild

347
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,279
blueberry is so high in manganese it's

348
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,279
insane freaking insane actually

349
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,920
because of that

350
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,079
any antioxidants that you got cooking

351
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,320
inside that wild blueberry the dots

352
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,720
connect it when that dot's connected

353
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,959
stuff happens in your life and your

354
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,519
health stuff starts to happen and that's

355
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,720
a big part of it right there

356
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,920
so we're gonna make some drinks we're

357
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
gonna have some fun i'm making wild

358
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,000
blueberry hibiscus iced tea and i'm

359
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,480
gonna be making wild blueberry lemonade

360
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,320
i'm excited about this right

361
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,720
it lasts it lasts a long time the

362
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,399
refrigerator you crack it open you do

363
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,320
two ounces a day for your health

364
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,240
that's what you crack it open you do two

365
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,440
ounces a day you do four ounces a day

366
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,920
whatever you'd like to do okay

367
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,519
and i'm going to get some ice too in a

368
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,160
second as well

369
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,519
i think i might need a shot

370
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,519
i'm gonna have this right here

371
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
i'm one of those wimps i'm only sipping

372
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,560
my shot right

373
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,000
you ever see that

374
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,040
ever see a show everybody's drinking

375
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,440
shots and

376
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,160
i'm sipping my shot

377
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,160
i'm like a wimp

378
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,519
that stuff is harsh man

379
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,279
there's vodka in that one

380
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,639

444
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,320
for them to do this alone

445
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,279
is unbelievable all right

446
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,079
because

447
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,560
it's not an easy process to put this

448
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,240
stuff in a bottle and have it there for

449
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,079
people so they can

450
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,720
do their antioxidant shot and that's

451
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,000
what i call an antioxidant shot

452
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,519
a lot of people don't understand

453
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,400
antioxidants they don't they don't know

454
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,839
what that means anthocyanins polyphenols

455
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,439
and antioxidants they just don't

456
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,160
understand it out there and i was

457
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,000

antioxidants

462
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,959

464
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,039

and then you're in if you do the

611
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,279
subscription you don't have to put any

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,720
code in you get 10 off on your first

613
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,240
order and you get five percent off from

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,799
there on out with the subscription it's

615
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,440
insane i mean how incredible is that

616
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,600
lucy does it doesn't it lose nutritional

617
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,240
value once it's juiced and bottled it

618
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,720
doesn't that's the incredible thing

619
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,760
the wild blueberry

620
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,960
right

621
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,039
gets more accessible to the body

622
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,360
when frozen

623
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,840
right or put in a bottle and that's

624
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,880
another thing people don't realize

625
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,240
okay so it actually helps

626
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
because what happens is there's a big

627
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,679
difference with the wild blueberry it's

628
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,520
not a cultivated

629
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,679
it's not a cultivated

630
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,120
berry cultivated berries have different

631
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,440
polyphenols they have different

632
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,240
antioxidants the whole entire thing so

633
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,919
it's really incredible what it does

634
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,600
hpp is not good though so

635
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,080
what you have to realize

636
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,960
high pressure pasteurization that's not

637
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,679
this

638
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,400
that i don't trust that i don't like i

639
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,760
do not trust hpp

640
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,240
that's why i always say people if you do

641
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,919
your celery juice don't do hpp don't buy

642
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,000
it like that there's a big difference so

643
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,080
when you look in here

644
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,080
it's not from concentrate there's

645
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,159
nothing in here no citric acid no

646
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,279
natural flavors no msg no fillers the

647
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,440
whole bit let's make another drink

648
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,919
angela how much do we use in the heavy

649
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,799
metal detox smoothie as a sub for two

650
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,000
cups of wild blueberries

651
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,840
now

652
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,880
this is potent stuff

653
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,320
okay

654
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,760
this is potent stuff

655
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,360
you don't want to throw a bottle of this

656
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,279
in your

657
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,880
smoothie like you don't want to take it

658
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,880
and throw the whole bottle in just like

659
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,200
until it's done you don't want to do

660
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,360
that okay

661
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,120
all right so there's a difference so

662
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,480
with this it's like if you want to do

663
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,320
the heavy metal detox smoothie you could

664
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,480
do two to four ounces throw it in there

665
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,480
four ounces is good boom four ounces if

666
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,480
you want to do a smoothie

667
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,000
you can even get away with two ounces if

668
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,640
you wanted to do that in a smoothie you

669
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,559
can get away with that

670
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,520
if you don't have your wild blueberries

671
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,520
or anything like that

672
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,120
so it's ten percent off on a case

673
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,320
or even three bottles if you want to get

674
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,640
three bottles right if you do a

675
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,360
subscription it's 10 off first order and

676
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,559
5 from there on after the subscription

677
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,400
is cool that's a great thing to do

678
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,159
that is amazing so you guys take a look

679
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,640

umakali dr nesbit

727
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,960
dr desmond and me are not in good terms

728
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,039
we're not in good on good terms at all

729
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,520
right now

730
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,399
he botched up a surgery really bad and i

731
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,520
actually

732
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,559
was really upset at him because

733
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,559
he took somebody's

734
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,320
took somebody's heart out of them and he

735
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,440
was supposed to

736
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:49,039
have the

737
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,120
transplant ready and then he realized

738
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,679
he didn't have it in the refrigerator

739
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,760
and it something went wrong and

740
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,559
whole thing was a disaster dr nesbitt is

741
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,240

always succeeding but i don't know

747
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,840

748
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,840

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,720

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,560
their seatbelts with those babies

880
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,320
because i'm not messing around

881
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,480
you got to have a stomach for the

882
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,359
medical medium podcast

883
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,359
too much truth

884
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,359
right

885
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,200
once you get off the other health

886
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,119
podcasts

887
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,800
after you've had enough of their their

888
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,160
bs

889
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,880
and you get onto the medical media

890
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,680
podcast your mind just blows up because

891
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,680
you're like what

892
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,960
no seriously

893
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:33,280
i'm gonna have some some great podcasts

894
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,280
okay

895
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,320
thoughts on substituting juice for

896
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,680
berries in the detox movie

897
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,440
you can absolutely so many times

898
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,920
when i don't have the frozen berries

899
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,960
well first of all i always put the juice

900
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,720
in

901
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,839
the heavy metal detox smoothie when i

902
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,680
make it

903
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,320
i put the berries and the juice in

904
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,760
that's what i do right

905
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,400
so

906
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,480
i see this as a fine wine

907
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,240
right

908
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,480
because first of all it's better than

909
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,800
wine for a lot of reasons

910
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,640
right because it's a wild blueberry

911
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,520
it's an entirely different ratio of

912
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,720
antioxidants the manganese is off the

913
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,920
chart

914
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,599
right

915
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,440
and that's one thing and there's no

916
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,400
alcohol

917
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,920
alcohol destroys

918
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,440
antioxidants

919
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,119
alcohol destroys

920
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,480
chemical compounds phytochemical

921
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,079
compounds so when people have why it's

922
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,960
like i'm drinking a glass of wine a

923
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,200
night

924
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,280
for my heart or for my health it's like

925
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,359
okay sounds great and all but that

926
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,680
alcohol just destroyed all your phyto

927
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,880
phytochemical compounds in the grapes

928
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,560
you would have been better off eating a

929
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,000
handful of grapes or something like that

930
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,079
right

931
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,800
but when you're dealing with this this

932
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,280
is the kind of wine that i serve when

933
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,160
company comes over people come over

934
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,160
this is it right here

935
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,440
i think

936
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,079
what you got to do is you got to hold

937
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,960
your hand like this right

938
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,040
kind of

939
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,599
move it around a little bit

940
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,119
like you see everybody do

941
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,599
like you see all the rich people do

942
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,839
right all the rich people

943
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,000
you know

944
