[10.92 - 16.04] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[16.08 - 20.92] medium hello I'm Anthony William and
[19.24 - 23.08] you're listening to the medical medium
[20.92 - 25.32] radio show where each week I talk about
[23.08 - 27.92] the most advanced healing information
[25.32 - 30.32] and secrets about health much of which
[27.92 - 33.24] is not found anywhere else and is
[30.32 - 35.40] decades ahead of what's out there now as
[33.24 - 37.56] I've always said who has 10 or 20 30
[35.40 - 39.80] years to wait for answers to their
[37.56 - 42.00] illnesses we don't have that time to
[39.80 - 44.92] wait we need these answers because as
[42.00 - 46.76] the time goes on as each year goes on
[44.92 - 48.80] and we're not well and we're not feeling
[46.76 - 51.92] good and we're struggling and battling
[48.80 - 54.60] different symptoms we need the answers
[51.92 - 57.04] we need to know we need to know now it's
[54.60 - 60.48] going on and we can't wait for
[57.04 - 63.80] literature that's 10 20 years behind 10
[60.48 - 67.20] 20 years behind to keep on circulating
[63.80 - 69.16] over and over again even if it's got new
[67.20 - 71.00] Frills and chills going on it's got a
[69.16 - 73.72] little bit of flash going on so it looks
[71.00 - 76.36] like it's changed up it's still the same
[73.72 - 79.04] theories behind it and that's what's
[76.36 - 80.92] amazing about the medical Medium show
[79.04 - 83.76] because spirit's going to bring you
[80.92 - 86.36] what's real what's now what you need to
[83.76 - 88.72] heal how you can heal what we can do to
[86.36 - 91.08] move forward together how we can not
[88.72 - 93.40] just backtrack over and over again how
[91.08 - 95.08] we can move forward instead and that's
[93.40 - 97.00] what this show is about it's really
[95.08 - 98.68] important to know that anybody knew that
[97.00 - 100.68] just you know got on to the show just
[98.68 - 101.96] now and listening and you know you
[100.68 - 104.28] clicked on your device and you're
[101.96 - 105.40] listening that's what this show is about
[104.28 - 107.32] it's about getting you information
[105.40 - 108.92] that's Advanced because if you're still
[107.32 - 110.48] talking about leaky gut you don't even
[108.92 - 111.96] know what leaky gut is because that's
[110.48 - 113.60] the whole thing there's new new
[111.96 - 116.76] literature coming out new books new
[113.60 - 119.40] information new stuff on the internet um
[116.76 - 121.24] coming out about leaky gut and it's
[119.40 - 124.24] actually not accurate it's
[121.24 - 127.20] misinformation it's old information
[124.24 - 130.40] keeps on coming back at us but it gets
[127.20 - 132.36] repackaged over and over again and even
[130.40 - 134.72] when an idea is slightly new in the
[132.36 - 137.20] health field it has an old baggage
[134.72 - 139.24] attached to it like all the baggage like
[137.20 - 141.72] your body's still attacking itself kind
[139.24 - 142.92] of baggage where it's all your genes and
[141.72 - 144.56] that's your problem and that's why
[142.92 - 147.40] you're sick so you can't doing anything
[144.56 - 149.24] about it it's that kind of stuff it's
[147.40 - 150.40] just the old stuff or it's all in your
[149.24 - 151.84] head still
[150.40 - 153.44] and that you're you're you're fine and
[151.84 - 155.36] it's all in your head and you look good
[153.44 - 156.96] and you you look fine so what's wrong
[155.36 - 158.92] with you because you look fine from the
[156.96 - 163.16] outside so what can be wrong with you on
[158.92 - 166.08] the inside and so all this old baggage
[163.16 - 169.64] is attached to even new stuff coming out
[166.08 - 173.12] every day and I'm waiting I'm waiting
[169.64 - 174.56] for that to change and you it didn't so
[173.12 - 176.68] spirit said it's time for you to start
[174.56 - 179.76] doing something about it you have to
[176.68 - 181.76] help people now on a wider basis on a WI

[495.00 - 500.12] almost didn't make it here literally
[497.96 - 502.56] here at all there were times in my life
[500.12 - 504.44] when I was 10 11 12 years old where I
[502.56 - 506.80] said you know what this is not I'm not
[504.44 - 510.20] going to make it because you can't
[506.80 - 513.48] function as a normal human being knowing
[510.20 - 515.80] everything about someone all the time in
[513.48 - 518.60] every crowd you're in in every place you

[556.52 - 560.60] excited because in there are over 50
[559.12 - 564.00] fruits and vegetables and what they do

[564.00 - 568.12] conditions what symptoms they heal in
[566.32 - 569.92] and here's the thing I'm talking about
[568.12 - 571.64] this right now because we're going into
[569.92 - 574.08] allergies and we're going we're going to
[571.64 - 576.36] be talking about food and we're going to
[574.08 - 579.48] be cutting into this a little bit and
[576.36 - 583.60] just so you know there are foods that we
[579.48 - 585.88] we were told we have a sensitivity to
[583.60 - 588.48] that are actually lifechanging and we
[585.88 - 589.76] and really healing us and we're doing
[588.48 - 593.12] other things we're having a little bit
[589.76 - 596.28] of a detox or we're having a healing
[593.12 - 598.76] effect and we're told that that isn't
[596.28 - 602.08] what it is we're told we're allergic to
[598.76 - 605.68] self cery we're told we're allergic to
[602.08 - 609.28] an Apple we're told we're allergic to an
[605.68 - 613.20] orange we're told we're allergic to a
[609.28 - 616.76] lettuce we're told we're allergic to
[613.20 - 619.08] asparagus and we're confused about foods
[616.76 - 621.64] and life-changing Foods I spell it out
[619.08 - 624.24] Advanced information from Spirit that's
[621.64 - 626.32] decades and decades ahead of its time in
[624.24 - 628.48] there about what phytochemicals are
[626.32 - 631.04] really doing what for us what's changing
[628.48 - 634.16] our lives when we eat and how to protect
[631.04 - 635.92] ourselves and it we need this resource

[635.92 - 641.28] how to protect our family you know all
[638.36 - 643.92] of it is in there what we're what we
[641.28 - 646.40] need to avoid and what we need to
[643.92 - 649.56] actually be afraid of out there so we
[646.40 - 651.96] can rise above it and push it away
[649.56 - 654.44] that's right it's about what we need to
[651.96 - 656.80] really know about and look out for to
[654.44 - 659.20] protect our family and our friends and
[656.80 - 661.88] our loved ones so you know look into to
[659.20 - 665.92] that when you can as soon as you can
[661.88 - 667.92] check it out so hey look look you know I
[665.92 - 670.84] I'm sure you've heard it before you know
[667.92 - 672.84] you're allergic to something or maybe
[670.84 - 675.00] maybe you know you think you you're
[672.84 - 676.52] allergic to something but I want to
[675.00 - 679.80] start out talking to you about a couple
[676.52 - 683.00] of things with this to begin with
[679.80 - 685.20] science and research doesn't know what
[683.00 - 687.40] happens to food when it enters the
[685.20 - 690.96] stomach you heard me say that before
[687.40 - 692.88] you've heard it from me to cor okay and
[690.96 - 695.56] I have to say it again because it
[692.88 - 698.96] applies it applies once
[695.56 - 702.00] again so here we go Medical Science
[698.96 - 704.04] medical research and Science in general
[702.00 - 706.92] doesn't know what happens to food when
[704.04 - 709.72] it enters the stomach okay we are in the
[706.92 - 711.92] baby stages when I mean baby stages I
[709.72 - 714.60] mean we're in the actually we're in the
[711.92 - 718.32] dinosaur prehistoric stage of
[714.60 - 719.72] understanding that yeah the assimilation
[718.32 - 721.48] enzymes
[719.72 - 724.44] digestion
[721.48 - 727.36] absorption but what does all that mean
[724.44 - 729.60] enzymes breaking down food okay the
[727.36 - 731.60] pancreas does a little bit of this and
[729.60 - 734.68] the hydrochloric acid does a little bit
[731.60 - 736.24] of that but did you know that science
[734.68 - 738.68] and research doesn't know that there's a
[736.24 - 740.96] blend of seven different acids in
[738.68 - 743.68] hydrochloric acid that's in the stomach
[740.96 - 747.12] and they've only singled out one of them
[743.68 - 748.60] why maybe funding maybe nobody cares
[747.12 - 750.80] maybe they just haven't stepped on it
[748.60 - 754.24] yet maybe they haven't just come across
[750.80 - 755.72] it yet but that's just one example of
[754.24 - 758.84] how we don't know what's going on in the
[755.72 - 763.04] gut okay so the latest information about
[758.84 - 764.56] leaky gut sure but that's out there but
[763.04 - 767.28] the information about the fact that your
[764.56 - 771.60] hydrochloric acid is a blend of seven
[767.28 - 774.24] different acids seven okay and those
[771.60 - 776.68] seven acids actually do a whole bunch of
[774.24 - 779.52] things that nobody knows and there's
[776.68 - 782.68] foods like celery
[779.52 - 785.84] that build up the seven different
[782.68 - 788.36] acids because celery has mineral salts
[785.84 - 789.88] undiscovered by medical research and
[788.36 - 791.56] medical science this is a big one today
[789.88 - 793.44] this is about medical research medical
[791.56 - 795.56] science blah blah blah blah blah but
[793.44 - 798.64] that's a big this is a big one today
[795.56 - 800.16] about that because it's really another
[798.64 - 803.76] place where we're
[800.16 - 805.72] lost and so so think about that there's
[803.76 - 808.24] these mineral salts and celery that have
[805.72 - 809.96] not been identified measured or weighed
[808.24 - 811.88] we know there're sodium in celery but
[809.96 - 813.96] that's it and we think all sodium's the
[811.88 - 816.80] same just like we think all Sugar's the
[813.96 - 818.64] same okay just like we think now the
[816.80 - 821.68] sugar and an apple is the same as as
[818.64 - 824.12] corn syrup I mean come on come
[821.68 - 827.96] on just all right and that's what's
[824.12 - 830.44] going on out there okay and so you have
[827.96 - 832.84] to understand that celery is comprised
[830.44 - 835.72] of these different mineral salts that
[832.84 - 837.40] are not that are not discovered and they
[835.72 - 839.12] change the chemistry inside the
[837.40 - 842.24] intestinal tract and inside the gut and
[839.12 - 845.32] the dadum and in the stomach itself so
[842.24 - 848.04] that we Thrive so that our liver heals
[845.32 - 850.96] so that our liver doesn't overproduce
[848.04 - 853.88] bile and burn out and burn itself out so
[850.96 - 856.60] we get fatty liver pre fatty liver the
[853.88 - 860.12] whole bit and so that we can kill off
[856.60 - 863.00] hpylori so celery juice actually has
[860.12 - 866.64] phytochemicals in it to kill off H
[863.00 - 869.20] pylori to kill it to burn it right out
[866.64 - 870.80] of there literally
[869.20 - 873.24] okay but science and research doesn't
[870.80 - 875.96] know that either you see where we are we
[873.24 - 877.52] we're really in a place that we're just
[875.96 - 879.48] walking around bumping heads until we
[877.52 - 881.00] see something on TV on one of the shows
[879.48 - 882.84] on one of the health shows they're
[881.00 - 885.40] saying oh you can do this and do that
[882.84 - 887.20] and all that information is outdated
[885.40 - 888.80] I've I've tuned in once in a while I I
[887.20 - 890.52] can't help myself and tune in once in a
[888.80 - 892.64] while and look at those and say oh my
[890.52 - 895.96] God that stuff is that stuff's back
[892.64 - 898.32] again from 30 years ago that steps back
[895.96 - 900.64] again and you know and everybody's just
[898.32 - 903.28] like doesn't know and so you need to
[900.64 - 904.84] know cuz we're going to arm you we're
[903.28 - 906.96] going to arm you with health we're going
[904.84 - 908.80] to arm you with with health and
[906.96 - 912.16] spiritual information we're going to arm
[908.80 - 914.36] you with truth okay and we're going to
[912.16 - 916.00] arm you with truth about all of this see
[914.36 - 917.96] science doesn't know what happens to
[916.00 - 919.56] food when it enters the stomach and
[917.96 - 922.04] that's a huge foundation and it's going
[919.56 - 926.28] to take a long time before they get
[922.04 - 929.60] there okay so how does science know what
[926.28 - 931.64] we're allergic to or not how does that
[929.60 - 934.08] happen okay first of all science of
[931.64 - 936.92] research doesn't know what healing
[934.08 - 939.48] powers are in food yet thousands of
[936.92 - 941.68] phytochemicals I talked about raw honey
[939.48 - 947.56] right I talked about that the other day
[941.68 - 950.36] over 200,000 working alive
[947.56 - 952.28] phytochemicals that have every function
[950.36 - 954.56] ability meaning that are involved with
[952.28 - 956.88] every part of your hormones to every
[954.56 - 959.08] part of the organs to your immune system
[956.88 - 960.96] to every aspect of your immune system
[959.08 - 962.72] your rbc's your white counts your
[960.96 - 964.60] lymphocytes your basophils your
[962.72 - 968.48] monocytes your neutrophils it goes on
[964.60 - 971.68] and on and on and that's in Honey and
[968.48 - 973.04] nobody knows and these phytochemicals
[971.68 - 974.80] that are all in these fruits and
[973.04 - 977.32] vegetables and honey also like I was
[974.80 - 979.80] saying destroy bacteria mold viruses
[977.32 - 982.00] they stop and prevent diseases they
[979.80 - 985.20] reverse and prevent
[982.00 - 987.52] cancer and how these Foods care for us
[985.20 - 990.08] is another thing that is completely
[987.52 - 991.80] unknown and I talk about a lot of this
[990.08 - 993.56] in the in the life-changing Foods book
[991.80 - 995.60] that's why I brought it up earlier
[993.56 - 997.04] because it's in there and we're going to
[995.60 - 999.36] you know we're going to always talk
[997.04 - 1000.92] about it but it's in there and we don't
[999.36 - 1002.72] know about what these foods do to care
[1000.92 - 1005.16] for us we don't know science and
[1002.72 - 1007.88] research doesn't know how they fuel us
[1005.16 - 1009.44] what organs and glands they care for and
[1007.88 - 1014.84] nurture and
[1009.44 - 1019.24] fuel okay and none of this is known by
[1014.84 - 1022.68] science just like mystery illnesses is
[1019.24 - 1026.16] hundreds of mystery illnesses that have
[1022.68 - 1028.96] labels and names of symptoms that
[1026.16 - 1032.72] science doesn't know the cause of do you
[1028.96 - 1036.24] see where we are right now at
[1032.72 - 1038.24] 2016 I mean come on you see we where we
[1036.24 - 1041.36] are right now this is
[1038.24 - 1043.28] unbelievable so autoimmune like I talked
[1041.36 - 1046.28] about before is not the body attacking
[1043.28 - 1048.68] itself okay we we talked about that and
[1046.28 - 1051.60] that's not how it works you know I won't
[1048.68 - 1054.20] you down that Lane right now but that's
[1051.60 - 1056.44] you know the body does not attack itself
[1054.20 - 1058.48] okay in fact it's the opposite there's
[1056.44 - 1061.04] something attacking us and our body is
[1058.48 - 1063.36] involved in trying to heal that so
[1061.04 - 1065.12] that's how autoimmune works and then it
[1063.36 - 1068.24] goes on down the line to other great
[1065.12 - 1071.76] mistakes so if we don't know what's
[1068.24 - 1075.44] causing lupus and ra and you know
[1071.76 - 1077.64] Hashimoto and we know we know here at
[1075.44 - 1080.08] the show you know cuz you're learning
[1077.64 - 1081.60] every day from What Spirit has to say
[1080.08 - 1085.64] because that's where the information's
[1081.60 - 1088.68] coming from you know the truth and and
[1085.64 - 1091.32] I'm delivering that to you guys you know
[1088.68 - 1094.04] and and I'm learning from Spirit just
[1091.32 - 1096.92] like you are I'm learning from Spirit
[1094.04 - 1098.48] okay so you know the truth so we're
[1096.92 - 1100.04] becoming those experts we're becoming
[1098.48 - 1101.44] those Health experts right you're with
[1100.04 - 1103.60] me on that
[1101.44 - 1105.28] 100% and that's what Spirit tells me
[1103.60 - 1106.84] that we're we're becoming those experts
[1105.28 - 1109.68] with all the information spirit's giving
[1106.84 - 1111.48] us we know what what's causing the ra we
[1109.68 - 1113.44] know what's causing the hashimotos we
[1111.48 - 1116.00] know what's causing fibromyalgia tentis
[1113.44 - 1118.80] vertigo brain fog like really what's
[1116.00 - 1120.52] causing brain fog not not not
[1118.80 - 1123.12] misinformation about brain fog that's
[1120.52 - 1125.56] riddled all over there out there I mean
[1123.12 - 1127.84] we know the real things behind all of
[1125.56 - 1132.24] this now and we're still
[1127.84 - 1135.04] learning look look you can actually
[1132.24 - 1137.32] research and look up the tallest
[1135.04 - 1140.44] mountain and you're going to get an
[1137.32 - 1142.24] answer because they've been able to
[1140.44 - 1144.84] research and science has been able to
[1142.24 - 1148.44] measure the tallest mountain okay cuz
[1144.84 - 1151.84] you can weigh it and you can measure
[1148.44 - 1156.12] it you can systematically on a physics
[1151.84 - 1159.36] level weigh it and measure it okay you
[1156.12 - 1161.84] can look for the deepest ocean the
[1159.36 - 1164.32] deepest ocean and look to see how deep
[1161.84 - 1167.12] the deepest ocean is and you're going to
[1164.32 - 1169.84] get a pretty darn good answer because
[1167.12 - 1172.52] they're able to weigh it and measure it
[1169.84 - 1175.08] that's science that's
[1172.52 - 1178.12] science but you can't weigh and measure
[1175.08 - 1180.84] lupus you can't it's a name for a
[1178.12 - 1183.36] confusion of elevated inflammation
[1180.84 - 1185.80] there's no weighing there's no measuring
[1183.36 - 1188.92] nobody knows what causes the symptoms we
[1185.80 - 1190.40] do here you can't weigh and measure
[1188.92 - 1192.28] mystery illness that everybody's
[1190.40 - 1193.72] suffering from decade after decade and
[1192.28 - 1195.60] then their children get that mystery
[1193.72 - 1197.80] illness over and then their children get
[1195.60 - 1200.72] it you can't weigh and measure it yet
[1197.80 - 1202.80] science is just not there so we have to
[1200.72 - 1206.76] do we what we have to do listen I
[1202.80 - 1211.44] recently was talking to a mother whose
[1206.76 - 1215.68] son is in college okay and his Professor
[1211.44 - 1217.56] went on a tangent to the whole classroom
[1215.68 - 1221.04] to the whole you know to everybody there
[1217.56 - 1224.00] went on a tangent about how fruit is bad
[1221.04 - 1226.80] for us fruit is bad for us and is filled
[1224.00 - 1229.28] with sugar okay a professor college
[1226.80 - 1231.84] professor is sitting there
[1229.28 - 1235.84] okay talking about how fruit is bad for
[1231.84 - 1239.08] us telling kids okay young
[1235.84 - 1242.72] adults that fruit is bad for us and how
[1239.08 - 1244.96] how this is a type of fruit fear that
[1242.72 - 1247.36] I've seen many times lately over the
[1244.96 - 1250.96] last couple of years develop and a fruit
[1247.36 - 1254.40] fear and a food fear I should say a food
[1250.96 - 1256.76] fear has seeped into our own
[1254.40 - 1259.00] universities and I've heard this before
[1256.76 - 1261.48] some of our professors have adopted a
[1259.00 - 1263.56] belief system from misinformation
[1261.48 - 1266.60] they've adopted a belief system so they
[1263.56 - 1268.12] went to like a belief system that
[1266.60 - 1271.16] doesn't have any real medical research
[1268.12 - 1273.00] or science so we're in the University
[1271.16 - 1275.04] okay all right professors are supposed
[1273.00 - 1278.84] to be doing stuff that's only measured
[1275.04 - 1280.68] and made only measured and weighed so
[1278.84 - 1284.12] professors are only supposed to be doing
[1280.68 - 1286.96] something that's only measured or
[1284.12 - 1288.64] weighed because it's about it's about
[1286.96 - 1291.20] University it's about science it's about
[1288.64 - 1292.88] research this was a science class that's
[1291.20 - 1297.24] why I'm saying this this was a science
[1292.88 - 1301.04] class but then adopts a belief system
[1297.24 - 1303.72] from some other place that says that
[1301.04 - 1306.00] sugar is all the same now and it's bad
[1303.72 - 1309.48] and that's not correct science at all on
[1306.00 - 1313.76] any level tells an entire group of
[1309.48 - 1315.40] students a large Class A large Gathering
[1313.76 - 1317.72] to not eat fruit at
[1315.40 - 1319.16] all I mean and this isn't the first time
[1317.72 - 1321.24] I heard heard this I've heard this a lot
[1319.16 - 1322.48] I mean I've heard this multiple times in
[1321.24 - 1328.16] the last couple of
[1322.48 - 1331.08] years and so her son challenges the
[1328.16 - 1334.60] professor and says since since when has
[1331.08 - 1334.60] an apple been bad for
[1336.16 - 1345.40] anyone especially since college students
[1341.08 - 1349.68] don't eat fruit anyway they eat caffeine
[1345.40 - 1351.76] coffee bad sugar Donuts
[1349.68 - 1355.04] Bagels
[1351.76 - 1358.56] Pizza um I don't know the list goes on
[1355.04 - 1362.40] and on and on and on alcohol the list
[1358.56 - 1364.64] goes on and on and on okay so and but
[1362.40 - 1367.56] everybody's being told not to eat an
[1364.64 - 1370.64] apple or a piece of fruit so the so this
[1367.56 - 1372.48] this um this student challenged the
[1370.64 - 1375.24] professor and the professor was actually
[1372.48 - 1378.28] upset and the student you know is paying
[1375.24 - 1381.16] the price so this is this is an example
[1378.28 - 1383.00] of what we're up to so you pay all this
[1381.16 - 1384.56] money send your children to school
[1383.00 - 1386.28] you're entrusting that they're at least
[1384.56 - 1389.88] going to get research in
[1386.28 - 1391.72] science and you know we're we're feeling
[1389.88 - 1394.20] that we're being taught the truth the
[1391.72 - 1396.12] what science is best to offer I'm not
[1394.20 - 1398.60] saying this is how it is in school all
[1396.12 - 1400.64] around at all I'm just saying this is
[1398.60 - 1402.56] where the health movement is getting
[1400.64 - 1405.00] twisted up into everything it's where
[1402.56 - 1409.28] it's being pulled into everything at
[1405.00 - 1413.12] every angle and getting us in trouble
[1409.28 - 1416.80] because that Apple can help save lives
[1413.12 - 1418.44] keep you here longer and help you heal
[1416.80 - 1419.88] so why am I talking about all this why
[1418.44 - 1421.48] am I getting into research and science
[1419.88 - 1422.88] to such a degree because I I know we're
[1421.48 - 1424.84] talking about allergies and everything
[1422.88 - 1428.52] because in order to understand the
[1424.84 - 1431.60] allergy the world you have to know the
[1428.52 - 1434.28] flaws you have to know where everything
[1431.60 - 1437.08] is unstable because if you don't you're
[1434.28 - 1439.28] going to buy into the system that has
[1437.08 - 1441.36] been created for allergies and you're
[1439.28 - 1444.28] going to mess yourself up and mess your
[1441.36 - 1446.68] head up and you're not going to be able
[1444.28 - 1448.60] to feed yourself the right Foods because
[1446.68 - 1451.20] you're going to let science and research
[1448.60 - 1453.84] that isn't correct dictate what you're
[1451.20 - 1456.16] supposed to eat you guys so that you
[1453.84 - 1459.24] don't help your own family so that
[1456.16 - 1461.92] you're afraid to give your child an
[1459.24 - 1463.88] orange because you think that something
[1461.92 - 1466.56] came up on some test that you might have
[1463.88 - 1468.84] been allergic to it or your son or
[1466.56 - 1471.48] daughter or your
[1468.84 - 1473.88] husband and and then that's just going
[1471.48 - 1475.36] to cheat you it's going to cheat you out
[1473.88 - 1477.92] of something that's going to keep you
[1475.36 - 1481.16] here healthier keep you here
[1477.92 - 1484.08] longer and it matters it matters when
[1481.16 - 1486.84] you get to the age of 60 which is
[1484.08 - 1491.32] Young and you want to go the Long Haul
[1486.84 - 1492.60] to 100 it matters when you're 70 and
[1491.32 - 1496.80] it's those
[1492.60 - 1499.36] oranges that you had 10 years ago that
[1496.80 - 1503.80] are keeping you here longer because of
[1499.36 - 1506.84] the phytochemicals in it it matters that
[1503.80 - 1511.08] that cilantro you had in your
[1506.84 - 1513.44] guacamole 5 years ago believe it or not
[1511.08 - 1514.48] has power in it that's keeping you here
[1513.44 - 1517.80] till you're
[1514.48 - 1520.24] 75 without realizing it cuz we don't
[1517.80 - 1522.76] know because science and research hasn't
[1520.24 - 1525.28] measured and weighed any of this
[1522.76 - 1527.92] whatsoever and so when we get told in
[1525.28 - 1529.52] the allergy testing world that you're
[1527.92 - 1531.68] allergic to this you're allergic to that
[1529.52 - 1533.60] it's in your way get rid of this and
[1531.68 - 1535.72] it's all the foods that are good for you
[1533.60 - 1538.36] that are actually lifechanging that can
[1535.72 - 1540.76] save your life give you a longer life
[1538.36 - 1543.92] bring you on down to that that final
[1540.76 - 1547.24] place of succeeding in a length of life
[1543.92 - 1550.36] that we want to and need to succeed in
[1547.24 - 1553.64] it matters big time you see why I'm like
[1550.36 - 1557.48] extra what is it extra sarcastic extra
[1553.64 - 1559.88] annoying today extra extra passionate
[1557.48 - 1562.32] okay okay extra passionate about this
[1559.88 - 1565.20] you guys see okay so let's go into this
[1562.32 - 1567.56] a little bit let's let's let's have some
[1565.20 - 1569.64] fun okay so you got your seat bels on
[1567.56 - 1572.04] let's do it all right now I'm not
[1569.64 - 1573.36] talking about anaphylactic shock I'm not
[1572.04 - 1574.60] talking about that we're going to do a
[1573.36 - 1576.88] whole show on that down the road
[1574.60 - 1578.44] anaphylactic shock that's a whole
[1576.88 - 1580.76] different occurrence and a whole
[1578.44 - 1583.24] different thing when someone is
[1580.76 - 1585.92] dangerously allergic to
[1583.24 - 1587.84] something and that means it's not just
[1585.92 - 1590.00] peanut butter somebody can have
[1587.84 - 1592.28] anaphylactic shock to
[1590.00 - 1595.48] latex somebody can have anal
[1592.28 - 1599.32] anaphylactic shock to
[1595.48 - 1602.52] paint someone can have it to
[1599.32 - 1604.76] gasoline you know Gasol gasoline hits
[1602.52 - 1607.28] somebody's hand when they're at the pump
[1604.76 - 1609.60] pumping their own gasoline and they need
[1607.28 - 1613.28] an EpiPen because they're going into
[1609.60 - 1615.32] anaphylactic shock to a
[1613.28 - 1617.68] beasting this is different than what
[1615.32 - 1620.40] we're talking about today this is a
[1617.68 - 1622.44] different reaction whole different thing
[1620.40 - 1625.40] so we're going to separate that but
[1622.44 - 1627.68] today talking about allergies seasonal
[1625.40 - 1629.76] allergies talking about food
[1627.68 - 1631.52] allergies on a different level we're
[1629.76 - 1633.08] talking about those you guys hear about
[1631.52 - 1635.44] this before have you been through it all
[1633.08 - 1638.56] have you been through the whole thing
[1635.44 - 1640.04] okay well we're going to talk about IG
[1638.56 - 1642.44] IGG
[1640.04 - 1645.96] testing that's what we're going to talk
[1642.44 - 1647.80] about immunoglobulin testing okay
[1645.96 - 1650.52] antibodies in the blood so we're going
[1647.80 - 1654.24] into that a little bit right now what's
[1650.52 - 1657.68] happening is we have this testing that's
[1654.24 - 1659.92] happening right now that can showcase if
[1657.68 - 1660.80] you are allergic to certain foods or
[1659.92 - 1664.00] some
[1660.80 - 1667.00] foods but it's not
[1664.00 - 1669.64] accurate it's not correct is what it's
[1667.00 - 1671.68] not and I'm going to talk about why for
[1669.64 - 1673.00] example since we don't know what food
[1671.68 - 1674.56] does we don't understand what's
[1673.00 - 1678.32] happening inside the
[1674.56 - 1680.52] body so when IG tests come back
[1678.32 - 1682.88] and they say Hey you are allergic to
[1680.52 - 1686.32] celery and I hear that once in a while
[1682.88 - 1688.92] you're allergic to celery what's really
[1686.32 - 1690.16] happening is that the celery is killing
[1688.92 - 1692.28] off a
[1690.16 - 1696.00] pathogen the
[1692.28 - 1699.88] pathogen is releasing a
[1696.00 - 1702.72] toxin that toxin creates a
[1699.88 - 1704.32] histamine and this is for some people
[1702.72 - 1705.96] that you know it shows up on the test
[1704.32 - 1708.20] hey you're allergic to celery they're
[1705.96 - 1710.48] saying that because you're celery juice
[1708.20 - 1713.64] and your celer is destroying hpylori
[1710.48 - 1718.12] it's killing off strepa cacus that
[1713.64 - 1721.40] causes sibo it's lowering and reducing
[1718.12 - 1723.68] sibo it's it's knocking out it's
[1721.40 - 1725.64] literally knocking mold and disarming it
[1723.68 - 1727.16] completely so if anybody who's worried
[1725.64 - 1729.72] about getting mold in their system or
[1727.16 - 1733.44] has mold in their system and that's what
[1729.72 - 1735.00] it's doing so when we do the IGG test we
[1733.44 - 1736.88] come home and we're like okay I got this
[1735.00 - 1738.68] big list we did not you know 90 Foods
[1736.88 - 1740.76] plus plus plus Foods okay I'm allergic
[1738.68 - 1743.52] to Cinnamon I'm allergic to celery I'm
[1740.76 - 1746.12] allergic to Orange I'm allergic to um
[1743.52 - 1749.08] Blackberry I'm allergic to hazelnuts I'm
[1746.12 - 1752.16] allergic to uh cucumber allergic to
[1749.08 - 1754.80] Tomato um we're doing the you know the
[1752.16 - 1757.16] what is it the uh process of elimination
[1754.80 - 1761.28] diet now through all this process it's
[1757.16 - 1762.72] totally chaotic and not correct and look
[1761.28 - 1764.28] I could be hurting somebody's feelings
[1762.72 - 1766.20] right now I mean I got a lot of good
[1764.28 - 1767.76] practitioners that that take the
[1766.20 - 1769.12] information that I have and they do
[1767.76 - 1770.60] different testings and stuff so I'm
[1769.12 - 1773.16] saying that if you are a practitioner
[1770.60 - 1774.96] and you do the IGG be open-minded in
[1773.16 - 1777.40] different ways you can still do this
[1774.96 - 1779.40] test and still be open-minded to what's
[1777.40 - 1781.92] going on meaning I know you're
[1779.40 - 1784.12] open-minded but you can still pick up
[1781.92 - 1786.68] more data from what we're talking about
[1784.12 - 1789.40] today and incorporate it into there so
[1786.68 - 1791.80] you can still be aware of why it's
[1789.40 - 1793.44] showcasing that test not you as a
[1791.80 - 1795.72] practitioner or a doctor or as a
[1793.44 - 1797.92] physician that's um not the one that's
[1795.72 - 1801.44] not understanding it's the test itself
[1797.92 - 1803.36] on what it's built upon it's the tool so
[1801.44 - 1804.80] this is going to broaden that tool and
[1803.36 - 1808.20] that spectrum and the information
[1804.80 - 1811.96] involved around there so let's go into
[1808.20 - 1814.64] it here um what happens is when someone
[1811.96 - 1815.72] has a dairy allergy that they feel
[1814.64 - 1819.08] lactose
[1815.72 - 1820.96] intolerant that they feel that they they
[1819.08 - 1823.88] have something go wrong the minute they
[1820.96 - 1827.60] eat dairy products that's
[1823.88 - 1830.40] because the dairy itself is feeding
[1827.60 - 1832.84] something rampantly it's feeding
[1830.40 - 1836.16] something so there's something inside
[1832.84 - 1840.32] someone's gut or intestinal tract that's
[1836.16 - 1843.40] feeding off of the dairy itself and then
[1840.32 - 1846.16] eliminating eliminating a poison a much
[1843.40 - 1848.88] more poisonous substance than the dairy
[1846.16 - 1852.16] itself this is what lactose intolerance
[1848.88 - 1855.16] is lactose intolerance isn't because
[1852.16 - 1857.64] someone is intolerant to
[1855.16 - 1858.80] lactose see how behind we are with
[1857.64 - 1860.96] science and
[1858.80 - 1864.60] research you got to have yeah get your
[1860.96 - 1867.00] notepad out get a cup of tea too get
[1864.60 - 1869.20] listen to this show over again in the
[1867.00 - 1870.60] archives as well and you get a cup of
[1869.20 - 1874.00] tea and you get your notepad and just go
[1870.60 - 1876.48] over it again and again and so when you
[1874.00 - 1878.68] eat the dairy and it's someone like
[1876.48 - 1880.04] yourself okay and you've been told your
[1878.68 - 1882.16] lactose intolerance because you have to
[1880.04 - 1885.52] run to the bathroom you're running to
[1882.16 - 1887.60] the bathroom because that dairy product
[1885.52 - 1890.16] is hyper feeding it's called hyper
[1887.60 - 1893.32] feeding that's it Spirit tells me Hyper
[1890.16 - 1896.16] feeding it's feeding a set of bugs in
[1893.32 - 1898.40] the colon and intestinal track that's
[1896.16 - 1900.32] having a Feeding Frenzy just like a
[1898.40 - 1902.92] whole bunch of piranha a whole bunch of
[1900.32 - 1905.12] piranha in a fish tank and you throw
[1902.92 - 1906.56] some food in there like little fish and
[1905.12 - 1908.44] they just have a Feeding Frenzy and they
[1906.56 - 1910.24] just bite all these fish fish in half
[1908.44 - 1913.44] they just they just eat all these fish
[1910.24 - 1916.20] gobble them up and it's like crazy and
[1913.44 - 1919.20] that's what happens and when this occurs
[1916.20 - 1922.32] the body reacts acts it reacts because
[1919.20 - 1925.00] when bugs feed rapidly they go to
[1922.32 - 1927.00] bathroom the bugs go to bathroom they
[1925.00 - 1929.76] have to eliminate and when they
[1927.00 - 1931.24] eliminate they eliminate the dairy
[1929.76 - 1933.56] product the
[1931.24 - 1935.48] lactose and other things in the dairy
[1933.56 - 1937.84] product not even the lactose that's
[1935.48 - 1939.48] another thing too it's not about lactose
[1937.84 - 1941.48] intolerance it's about more than lactose
[1939.48 - 1944.64] intolerance it's all kinds of aspects of
[1941.48 - 1947.76] dairy that feed problems and then the
[1944.64 - 1950.28] bugs eliminate a poison that's much more
[1947.76 - 1953.88] toxic it's like a methyl poison a methyl
[1950.28 - 1954.92] poison meaning it is synergistically
[1953.88 - 1957.40] designed
[1954.92 - 1959.40] differently it can travel it can do
[1957.40 - 1962.00] things it's much more
[1959.40 - 1964.20] poisonous and then the body reacts and
[1962.00 - 1966.36] you have diarrhea you have cramps you
[1964.20 - 1969.40] have stomach cramps you have bloating
[1966.36 - 1972.36] all of this okay that's how it works
[1969.40 - 1976.40] that's how it works now you can
[1972.36 - 1980.40] still be allergic to dairy products but
[1976.40 - 1983.72] it not show up on the IGG test not show
[1980.40 - 1985.92] up on the IGG test that's how confusing
[1983.72 - 1989.00] the testing is or any kind of allergy
[1985.92 - 1992.56] testing you can be allergic to Dairy and
[1989.00 - 1998.28] other foods will show up I'll tell you
[1992.56 - 2001.04] why other Foods okay are killing off
[1998.28 - 2003.60] pathogens they're killing off pathogens
[2001.04 - 2005.68] and it triggers off the allergy testing
[2003.60 - 2009.20] so here's how it works here's how it
[2005.68 - 2013.20] works if you eat a fig and it's killing
[2009.20 - 2015.28] off eoli in your intestinal tract ecoli
[2013.20 - 2018.28] which causes diverticulitis
[2015.28 - 2020.36] diverticulosis or strep which causes
[2018.28 - 2023.52] diverticulosis diverticulitis whatever
[2020.36 - 2025.96] when you kill that off it
[2023.52 - 2030.92] explodes so when you eat a
[2025.96 - 2034.56] food like garlic that kills off H pylori
[2030.92 - 2038.68] CI staff strepa cacus
[2034.56 - 2042.40] eoli mold is mold mold actually mold can
[2038.68 - 2044.16] be alive so when you kill off
[2042.40 - 2046.92] anything it
[2044.16 - 2048.88] explodes and it's poisonous when it
[2046.92 - 2051.44] explodes when it
[2048.88 - 2053.32] explodes and it's Affiliated to the food
[2051.44 - 2055.40] that killed it off it's going to show up
[2053.32 - 2057.68] on the IGG test that you're actually
[2055.40 - 2061.52] that you're actually allergic to figs
[2057.68 - 2062.80] that you're actually allergic to a food
[2061.52 - 2065.56] that you're actually allergic to
[2062.80 - 2068.16] something that was doing this you're
[2065.56 - 2070.64] allergic to banana because banana kills
[2068.16 - 2073.44] viruses in the intestinal tract it kills
[2070.64 - 2075.12] shingles which cause causes colitis so
[2073.44 - 2078.76] it kills off shingles which causes
[2075.12 - 2083.24] colitis that's what bananas does bananas
[2078.76 - 2084.84] do and and so bananas do more than that
[2083.24 - 2086.48] they kill off lots of things in the
[2084.84 - 2088.28] intestinal tract that shouldn't be there
[2086.48 - 2089.48] but they leave good bacteria they feed
[2088.28 - 2093.32] good
[2089.48 - 2097.12] bacteria but when a banana kills off
[2093.32 - 2099.40] HIV you said it I said it you hear it hi
[2097.12 - 2101.56] IV when it kills off
[2099.40 - 2103.56] retroviruses when it kills off stealth
[2101.56 - 2106.16] viruses when it kills off you know
[2103.56 - 2108.48] colitis viruses such as such as
[2106.16 - 2111.36] shingles when it kills off epine bar
[2108.48 - 2114.52] cyto megler virus when it kills off
[2111.36 - 2117.28] bacteria that bacteria that virus
[2114.52 - 2118.64] explodes it explodes it dies because
[2117.28 - 2123.24] there's a phytochemical in this food
[2118.64 - 2127.28] that kills off that pathogen okay so
[2123.24 - 2129.16] then it's a crap storm on the IGG test
[2127.28 - 2130.48] or that thing's flying everything you're
[2129.16 - 2131.72] allergic to this you're allergic to
[2130.48 - 2132.88] Santo you're allergic to Strawberry
[2131.72 - 2134.56] you're allergic to Banana you're
[2132.88 - 2135.96] allergic to Apple now you're allergic to
[2134.56 - 2137.80] artichokes out of nowhere you're
[2135.96 - 2139.36] allergic to asparagus you're allergic to
[2137.80 - 2143.16] zucchini you're allergic to Winter
[2139.36 - 2144.56] squash butternut squash and it's insane
[2143.16 - 2148.88] it's lunacy I'm just going to be
[2144.56 - 2149.84] straight up it's lunacy so you have to
[2148.88 - 2152.80] understand how it works and the
[2149.84 - 2154.16] difference is alternative medicine
[2152.80 - 2155.96] doesn't know and I don't care if it's
[2154.16 - 2157.64] the best book The Best Literature I
[2155.96 - 2159.20] don't care if the best article I don't
[2157.64 - 2161.36] care if it's the best thing on the
[2159.20 - 2163.92] internet the most advanced guy girl you
[2161.36 - 2166.76] got out there doing what they're
[2163.92 - 2170.44] doing if they don't know that we're
[2166.76 - 2172.76] allergic to wheat because wheat feeds a
[2170.44 - 2174.92] pathogen and then that pathogen's
[2172.76 - 2177.16] eliminating causing the allergy or
[2174.92 - 2179.68] causing the body to have a reaction
[2177.16 - 2182.12] causing a body to have Celiac if they
[2179.68 - 2183.60] don't know that yet which they don't
[2182.12 - 2186.52] then we're way
[2183.60 - 2188.16] behind so we're hoping that gets fixed
[2186.52 - 2189.36] and you you guys are actually part of
[2188.16 - 2190.56] that you're part of the knowing the
[2189.36 - 2192.52] information cuz you know the right
[2190.56 - 2194.28] information and it changes everything
[2192.52 - 2196.16] and it breaks all the rules and it moves
[2194.28 - 2198.04] forward it moves people forward so we
[2196.16 - 2200.40] stopped you know we're stopped you know
[2198.04 - 2201.28] being in the in the old ages or the back
[2200.40 - 2204.12] you
[2201.28 - 2207.08] know back in the that day we're back out
[2204.12 - 2209.12] of that day here's the deal so when
[2207.08 - 2211.48] you're eating wheat when you're eating
[2209.12 - 2213.52] wheat and that wheat is feeding
[2211.48 - 2215.92] something in the intestinal tract you're
[2213.52 - 2219.76] going to get Celiac it's not your body
[2215.92 - 2221.36] attacking itself self it's not the fact
[2219.76 - 2223.48] that your body is trying to destroy
[2221.36 - 2226.40] itself it's not the fact that these
[2223.48 - 2228.04] antibodies are out to destroy you so
[2226.40 - 2230.08] when IGG testing does all these
[2228.04 - 2232.64] different foods and they say well
[2230.08 - 2234.52] there's you know there's there's there's
[2232.64 - 2237.92] proof here in the testing that says
[2234.52 - 2239.88] there's antibodies that tell us that you
[2237.92 - 2242.36] know your body is attacking it's
[2239.88 - 2245.36] allergic to an Apple it's allergic to
[2242.36 - 2248.56] asparagus it's allergic to Basil it's
[2245.36 - 2251.36] allergic to parsley it's allergic to
[2248.56 - 2253.84] nettle and when we get told that it's
[2251.36 - 2256.12] not accurate it's not how it works
[2253.84 - 2258.08] partially nettle and asparagus and
[2256.12 - 2259.68] artichoke they get rid of pathogens
[2258.08 - 2261.80] they're phytochemicals are clean and
[2259.68 - 2264.64] detox and when you clean and detox it
[2261.80 - 2268.32] ruins the IGG test it completely ruins
[2264.64 - 2269.96] all of the allergy testing in general
[2268.32 - 2273.92] that
[2269.96 - 2275.96] occurs and when somebody's eating wheat
[2273.92 - 2278.16] and they're having a reaction that can
[2275.96 - 2279.84] last days or weeks later or they're not
[2278.16 - 2283.48] even sure it's the wheat doing it it's
[2279.84 - 2286.12] just the wheat feeding bugs and bugs are
[2283.48 - 2288.96] feasting releasing
[2286.12 - 2291.64] toxins that's what's really
[2288.96 - 2294.28] happening same thing with eggs eggs can
[2291.64 - 2297.76] feed bugs it can grow cysts and
[2294.28 - 2300.12] tumors even if I I've seen people I've
[2297.76 - 2302.12] seen people they got tumors they got
[2300.12 - 2304.20] cysts they got breast cancer they get
[2302.12 - 2306.64] the IGG test they get the the allerg
[2304.20 - 2308.76] allergy testing and the allergy tests
[2306.64 - 2310.44] come back they're allergic to a food
[2308.76 - 2312.08] that's going to help stop their cancer
[2310.44 - 2314.00] like wild blueberries they're allergic
[2312.08 - 2315.84] to blueberries is what I'm saying or
[2314.00 - 2317.44] they're allergic to raspberries even
[2315.84 - 2319.44] though they're not having a r reaction
[2317.44 - 2321.08] when they eat the raspberry blueberry
[2319.44 - 2323.56] but then the test says they're not
[2321.08 - 2325.44] allergic to eggs they're not allergic to
[2323.56 - 2327.40] eggs the very thing that grows Cy in
[2325.44 - 2329.12] tumors and feeds viruses to grow cyant
[2327.40 - 2330.52] tumors and creates breast cancer and
[2329.12 - 2333.40] thyroid cancer and all these other
[2330.52 - 2335.64] Cancers and liver cancer eggs and the
[2333.40 - 2336.88] tests come back where you can eat eggs
[2335.64 - 2338.76] so you walk out of the office office
[2336.88 - 2342.32] whoa I can't eat blueberries raspberries
[2338.76 - 2345.40] and blackberries I can't eat melon I
[2342.32 - 2348.16] can't eat watermelon I can't eat this
[2345.40 - 2349.72] but I can eat eggs do do you see what
[2348.16 - 2351.92] I'm saying or you see where I'm going
[2349.72 - 2355.40] here so that's what I'm talking about
[2351.92 - 2356.88] right there so here's how it works
[2355.40 - 2361.32] there's Foods we
[2356.88 - 2363.80] eat that kill off bugs like apples
[2361.32 - 2365.60] there's Foods we eat like raspberries
[2363.80 - 2367.64] that kill off bugs inside our body
[2365.60 - 2369.88] pathogens that responsible for most of
[2367.64 - 2372.68] all disease there's Foods we eat that
[2369.88 - 2375.28] are eliminating toxic heavy metals you
[2372.68 - 2377.84] guys pulling them out of our body
[2375.28 - 2380.64] eliminating F Malahide that's in her
[2377.84 - 2384.28] body eliminating ammonia
[2380.64 - 2387.52] eliminating um uh
[2384.28 - 2390.60] byproduct eliminating jelly that's
[2387.52 - 2393.56] produced by viruses and
[2390.60 - 2395.40] bacteria eliminating all kinds of these
[2393.56 - 2398.32] poisons and toxins and toxic heavy
[2395.40 - 2400.16] metals and chem chemicals and pesticides
[2398.32 - 2401.04] and DDT that's been in her system from
[2400.16 - 2403.52] our
[2401.04 - 2405.28] forefathers everything these foods are
[2403.52 - 2409.92] eliminating and when they eliminate
[2405.28 - 2412.60] these toxins they trigger off a reaction
[2409.92 - 2414.68] sometimes histamine reactions sometimes
[2412.60 - 2416.04] other reactions because they're detoxing
[2414.68 - 2418.48] they're pulling this stuff out of the
[2416.04 - 2420.08] body so when you get your allergy tests
[2418.48 - 2422.88] they're chaotic they're all over the
[2420.08 - 2424.40] place they're not even in control
[2422.88 - 2426.48] they're picking up the fact that you're
[2424.40 - 2428.60] detoxing that you're killing off bugs
[2426.48 - 2431.76] you're eliminating toxic heavy metals
[2428.60 - 2434.44] and it's it's picking up all of
[2431.76 - 2436.08] that and then in the end you get a list
[2434.44 - 2437.80] of data that tells you not to eat
[2436.08 - 2441.36] certain
[2437.80 - 2445.48] foods and that's where it's all
[2441.36 - 2450.08] wrong and if you are having reactions to
[2445.48 - 2453.40] pollen to Ragweed hay fever get rid of
[2450.08 - 2456.52] wheat get rid of dairy get rid of eggs
[2453.40 - 2459.88] get rid of canola oil get rid of soy get
[2456.52 - 2461.28] rid of corn get rid of MSG I talk about
[2459.88 - 2462.84] it all the time look for it it's in
[2461.28 - 2466.00] everything in natural
[2462.84 - 2468.40] flavors get rid of all of that and if
[2466.00 - 2471.44] you want to go further get rid of
[2468.40 - 2474.08] Rye okay and you know get rid of some
[2471.44 - 2477.24] other grains if you really want to and
[2474.08 - 2481.68] move those out bring in more fruits and
[2477.24 - 2484.36] vegetables you'll be less apt to getting
[2481.68 - 2487.80] anything from hay fever your hay fever
[2484.36 - 2490.32] symptoms will drop your Ragweed
[2487.80 - 2493.72] symptomss will drop your you know your
[2490.32 - 2495.44] symptoms from pollen will drop and you
[2493.72 - 2496.96] won't be so light sensitive and you
[2495.44 - 2499.52] won't have so many problems because
[2496.96 - 2501.64] those foods are feeding strap in the
[2499.52 - 2503.76] sinuses strap in the system strep in the
[2501.64 - 2505.76] lungs strep of cockus all over the body
[2503.76 - 2507.40] all kinds of bacteria all kinds of bugs
[2505.76 - 2509.44] different viruses and because all these
[2507.40 - 2510.72] foods that I mentioned are feeding all
[2509.44 - 2514.24] of that all the
[2510.72 - 2517.12] time what including pork well that feeds
[2514.24 - 2518.72] all these bugs and when that happens
[2517.12 - 2520.52] you're going to be more sensitive to the
[2518.72 - 2522.56] overload so when you start getting in
[2520.52 - 2524.72] front of mold you're going to react more
[2522.56 - 2526.44] when you start getting in front of
[2524.72 - 2528.60] pollen you're going to react more when
[2526.44 - 2529.80] you start getting in front of you know
[2528.60 - 2531.12] hay you know when you start getting in
[2529.80 - 2534.80] front of hay when you start getting in
[2531.12 - 2537.72] front of ragweed you're going to react
[2534.80 - 2539.44] more so remember that keep these Foods
[2537.72 - 2541.04] out if you want and listen if it's too
[2539.44 - 2544.28] much or it's too scary start with one
[2541.04 - 2546.72] food just get weed out one food that's
[2544.28 - 2548.08] it you know I remember 30 years ago I
[2546.72 - 2550.16] told somebody to get off wheat spirit
[2548.08 - 2552.40] said get off wheat it was like an alien
[2550.16 - 2553.60] landed from another planet or something
[2552.40 - 2555.84] it was like spaceship just you know
[2553.60 - 2557.92] everybody was looking up in the sky as
[2555.84 - 2559.40] if there was like spaceships coming down
[2557.92 - 2561.04] be they could because no one could
[2559.40 - 2563.08] figure that could fathom what do you
[2561.04 - 2565.48] mean wheat what's wheat oh is that the
[2563.08 - 2567.56] bread I'm eating it's 30 30 years ago
[2565.48 - 2570.72] like what do you mean wheat you mean the
[2567.56 - 2572.60] bread that gives us life is it I need to
[2570.72 - 2575.48] get rid of that that's what it was like
[2572.60 - 2578.24] 30 years ago okay I'm just telling you
[2575.48 - 2580.76] I'm sure many of you you know that and
[2578.24 - 2582.32] um so the bottom line is if you need to
[2580.76 - 2583.84] but if you need to wait on that you need
[2582.32 - 2585.36] to just get rid of one thing get rid of
[2583.84 - 2587.28] one thing get rid of two things whatever
[2585.36 - 2590.68] you think you can do and bring in more
[2587.28 - 2593.48] more things okay why would somebody
[2590.68 - 2595.12] react with burning sensation around
[2593.48 - 2597.00] their mouth if they had an apple there
[2595.12 - 2599.60] are a few people out there they have an
[2597.00 - 2602.68] apple and they react they get they get
[2599.60 - 2604.72] um they get a f funny feeling in their
[2602.68 - 2607.48] around their lips because that means
[2604.72 - 2610.44] that one time they had an apple when
[2607.48 - 2613.72] they were younger that was loaded with
[2610.44 - 2616.60] pesticides or DDT with a different name
[2613.72 - 2619.48] on it DDT switch names over and over
[2616.60 - 2622.24] again it's always been around so DDT or
[2619.48 - 2624.44] other pesticides with an with you know
[2622.24 - 2627.16] on top of that Apple waxed into that
[2624.44 - 2629.12] apple and so when they bit into that
[2627.16 - 2631.44] apple and it had a line of pesticides
[2629.12 - 2633.20] from a conventional apple and it got on
[2631.44 - 2635.68] their lips and in their mouth their body
[2633.20 - 2639.16] reacted from that chemical agent so then
[2635.68 - 2642.40] when they eat any Apple after that any
[2639.16 - 2646.04] Apple their body actually is going to
[2642.40 - 2648.56] react that can go away by eliminating
[2646.04 - 2651.32] all of the foods I talked about
[2648.56 - 2652.80] and um bringing in more fresh fruits of
[2651.32 - 2655.44] other fresh fruits and other vegetables
[2652.80 - 2658.64] and things like that over time that will
[2655.44 - 2661.56] go away and someone be less reactive
[2658.64 - 2663.20] when they have something like that and
[2661.56 - 2664.88] then there's other reactions when
[2663.20 - 2667.40] someone feels funny in different ways
[2664.88 - 2671.68] those are detox reactions from the foods
[2667.40 - 2673.20] healing the person in different ways now
[2671.68 - 2675.36] a lot of things happen when you eat
[2673.20 - 2677.72] wheat or you eat dairy or you eat eggs
[2675.36 - 2679.36] you won't know what it's doing to you
[2677.72 - 2681.40] keeping you back holding you back with
[2679.36 - 2683.00] your chronic illness for weeks or even
[2681.40 - 2684.44] forever because you just you'll stay
[2683.00 - 2686.16] chronically ill eating these things and
[2684.44 - 2689.52] not know what's doing it and then when
[2686.16 - 2691.64] you eat something like a celery stick or
[2689.52 - 2693.44] a cucumber slice you feel funny or a
[2691.64 - 2696.60] tomato because those things are pulling
[2693.44 - 2697.52] out toxins pulling out Lots and lots of
[2696.60 - 2700.64] toxic
[2697.52 - 2702.64] debris and all kinds of bugs and then
[2700.64 - 2704.28] you start reacting so you don't know so
[2702.64 - 2705.84] you go back to just eating you know
[2704.28 - 2708.80] bread and cheese grilled cheese
[2705.84 - 2710.52] sandwiches with butter I get it but you
[2708.80 - 2715.36] know you take one day at a time you work
[2710.52 - 2717.76] with it the point of this is not to be
[2715.36 - 2719.92] afraid of that list you're getting
[2717.76 - 2721.24] handed to you at the allergy's office
[2719.92 - 2722.92] meaning I'm not talking about
[2721.24 - 2725.48] anaphylactic shock list that's a
[2722.92 - 2727.92] different story you know be afraid of
[2725.48 - 2729.20] that that list that's different there's
[2727.92 - 2730.64] a whole different reason we're going to
[2729.20 - 2732.56] cover that in the next show and not in
[2730.64 - 2734.44] the next show coming up but coming up
[2732.56 - 2737.32] we're going to do that in the future but
[2734.44 - 2739.24] don't be afraid of the other list but be
[2737.32 - 2742.28] afraid meaning be be
[2739.24 - 2744.96] concerned about the wheat the dairy the
[2742.28 - 2746.84] eggs okay the milk cheese the butter the
[2744.96 - 2749.00] ghee be afraid of all that stuff be
[2746.84 - 2750.76] concerned of all that stuff too that
[2749.00 - 2752.44] stuff will keep your hay fever keep your
[2750.76 - 2753.96] Ragweed problems keep you on allergy
[2752.44 - 2756.08] medicine keep on all those different
[2753.96 - 2758.36] allergy medicines the nasal sprays all
[2756.08 - 2760.52] that that stuff will keep feeding MGS
[2758.36 - 2762.16] keeping you on all of that like I said
[2760.52 - 2764.68] take one day at a time just incorporate
[2762.16 - 2766.80] celery juice into your life maybe some
[2764.68 - 2768.44] some wild blueberries just incorporate
[2766.80 - 2770.92] something like that into your life you
[2768.44 - 2772.88] take one day at a time is what you know
[2770.92 - 2774.64] is all you have to
[2772.88 - 2777.80] do
[2774.64 - 2779.96] so the bottom line is because medical
[2777.80 - 2782.88] research and medical science isn't there
[2779.96 - 2785.88] yet with what foods do for us and what
[2782.88 - 2788.48] foods don't do for us it's going to
[2785.88 - 2790.48] going to be you know it's basically
[2788.48 - 2792.28] going to be just a guessing game or a
[2790.48 - 2796.36] guessing match out
[2792.28 - 2799.32] there okay a guessing match I'll say
[2796.36 - 2802.80] that instead of the other thing so so
[2799.32 - 2805.88] just realize that we can't be guessing
[2802.80 - 2807.60] with your life with your health with
[2805.88 - 2809.52] your children's health with your
[2807.60 - 2812.48] grandchildren's health we can't be
[2809.52 - 2814.16] guessing anymore aren't you tired of it
[2812.48 - 2817.24] I just I I want to know are you guys
[2814.16 - 2819.32] tired of it okay cuz may maybe hey maybe
[2817.24 - 2821.36] I'm pushing it too far because I'm tired
[2819.32 - 2822.76] of it and I know other people tired of
[2821.36 - 2825.96] it I'm just wondering if you guys are
[2822.76 - 2827.48] tired of it because it's real out there
[2825.96 - 2830.44] that's just a guessing game and we got
[2827.48 - 2832.24] to blow by that we need more that's what
[2830.44 - 2834.88] it's about today that's what it's about
[2832.24 - 2840.04] with allergies so what I suggest in the
[2834.88 - 2842.68] allergy world is don't fall victim to
[2840.04 - 2846.20] the misinformation from the IGG test or
[2842.68 - 2847.60] other allergy tests you keep the doctor
[2846.20 - 2849.80] because the doctor cares and the
[2847.60 - 2852.48] doctor's an amazing doctor in probably
[2849.80 - 2854.88] every every way it's just that the tool
[2852.48 - 2857.88] is what I'm saying don't fall victim for
[2854.88 - 2859.36] the testing tool you know talk to your
[2857.88 - 2861.24] doctor and practitioner if you really
[2859.36 - 2862.68] like your doctor and your practitioner
[2861.24 - 2863.84] and and they're telling you to stay away
[2862.68 - 2866.04] from all these foods that you're not
[2863.84 - 2867.72] sure if you even react or not to fruits
[2866.04 - 2868.96] and vegetables meaning stay away from
[2867.72 - 2870.36] all these fruits and vegetables that you
[2868.96 - 2873.32] don't even know if you're really
[2870.36 - 2875.32] allergic or not to or you're reacting to
[2873.32 - 2877.80] you know talk to your practitioner talk
[2875.32 - 2879.52] to your doctor and say can I have these
[2877.80 - 2881.96] asparagus cuz it never seemed to really
[2879.52 - 2884.88] bug me that much I I had them in my diet
[2881.96 - 2886.68] before you know can I bring them back in
[2884.88 - 2888.72] and talk to your doctor and say look is
[2886.68 - 2890.20] it possible the asparagus is offering
[2888.72 - 2891.76] something else for my health that could
[2890.20 - 2895.20] keep me here
[2891.76 - 2897.64] longer and I need that back in
[2895.20 - 2899.72] here is that
[2897.64 - 2901.60] possible I want to talk about sweet
[2899.72 - 2903.64] potatoes who eats sweet potatoes do you
[2901.60 - 2905.92] guys eat any sweet potatoes out there
[2903.64 - 2908.16] who's eating sweet potatoes out there do
[2905.92 - 2911.60] you like them because they're
[2908.16 - 2914.80] good okay if you're told you're allergic
[2911.60 - 2916.28] to them don't listen make sure you eat
[2914.80 - 2918.08] those sweet potatoes unless you're
[2916.28 - 2919.48] having an anaphylactic shock with it
