[101.16 - 105.48] right there all right
[103.50 - 107.88] you guys we're talking about blood sugar
[105.48 - 111.72] hypoglycemia hyperglycemia to my insulin
[107.88 - 113.64] resistance Let's uh what else can we
[111.72 - 115.14] talk about all about that blood sugar
[113.64 - 117.60] then we're just gonna say it straight
[115.14 - 120.96] off the bat right now in order to have a
[117.60 - 122.94] blood sugar issue whatsoever like a
[120.96 - 124.98] blood sugar issue outside of the fact
[122.94 - 127.92] that someone isn't eating say
[124.98 - 130.74] a blood sugar issue you have to have
[127.92 - 132.12] three things one out of three things
[130.74 - 134.46] wrong you could have all three things
[132.12 - 136.20] wrong you could have your liver be a
[134.46 - 138.78] problem your pancreas could be a problem
[136.20 - 141.12] or your adrenals be a problem you can
[138.78 - 143.46] have adrenals and pancreas and your
[141.12 - 145.38] liver is fine you can have pancreas in
[143.46 - 148.08] your liver your adrenals are fine you
[145.38 - 150.78] can have liver adrenals and pancreas
[148.08 - 153.60] having a problem all three of them but
[150.78 - 155.16] these are the three things right there
[153.60 - 157.74] that determine if you're going to be
[155.16 - 160.68] having a blood sugar problem so that one
[157.74 - 163.14] day one day down the road
[160.68 - 165.60] after eating a little too much of this
[163.14 - 168.06] or one day down the road after eating a
[165.60 - 171.72] little too much of this right here
[168.06 - 173.10] right or one day down the road having a
[171.72 - 174.30] little too much of this right here
[173.10 - 176.28] excuse me I'm gonna take an ice cream
[174.30 - 179.94] break if you guys don't mind I got an
[176.28 - 182.94] ice cream right here whoa let me
[179.94 - 186.24] see sorry sorry sorry I gotta check my
[182.94 - 189.60] oxygen levels one more time
[186.24 - 192.90] okay oxygen at 100 feeling good about
[189.60 - 194.82] that because on hold on uh one
[192.90 - 196.92] Mississippi she must be doing this
[194.82 - 198.54] before
[196.92 - 201.42] okay I'm just trying to figure out my
[198.54 - 203.64] heart per per minute I don't think I
[201.42 - 205.62] have this one down yet but I will
[203.64 - 207.36] the point I'm trying to say right here
[205.62 - 208.44] what we're talking about we're talking
[207.36 - 210.60] about blood sugar we're talking about
[208.44 - 212.16] new trends that happen all the time A
[210.60 - 214.20] lot of people are checking their blood
[212.16 - 215.64] sugar every hour they're monitoring
[214.20 - 217.26] their blood sugar and then they think
[215.64 - 219.30] they got it down with what they're
[217.26 - 220.68] eating they're eating healthier they're
[219.30 - 222.60] eating whether it's plant-based or
[220.68 - 224.70] they're keto or a healthy what's
[222.60 - 226.74] so-called healthy animal protein based
[224.70 - 229.26] diet they think they got it all in check
[226.74 - 231.24] I'm not talking about diabetics okay I'm
[229.26 - 233.16] not talking about type 1 diabetes I'm
[231.24 - 235.62] not talking about
[233.16 - 236.94] um type 2 diabetes I'm not talking about
[235.62 - 240.00] all the different types of medical
[236.94 - 242.22] medium coined a long time ago in the
[240.00 - 244.62] terms of how many types there really are
[242.22 - 246.54] I'm not going into that I'm going into
[244.62 - 249.24] like every day whether you're in Fitness
[246.54 - 250.98] every day whether you're concerned about
[249.24 - 253.56] your blood sugar
[250.98 - 256.98] I'm talking about that aspect of it
[253.56 - 259.68] right now people think that they're in
[256.98 - 261.90] control of their health because they're
[259.68 - 263.82] looking at their their blood sugar
[261.90 - 266.40] they're monitoring their blood sugar and
[263.82 - 268.62] they think they have total control over
[266.40 - 270.06] their health and then as they're eating
[268.62 - 273.12] and doing things and taking care of
[270.06 - 275.34] themselves but what can happen is it can
[273.12 - 278.64] create an eating disorder it can create
[275.34 - 282.06] OCD it can actually add to somebody's
[278.64 - 284.70] OCD it can become overwhelming it can
[282.06 - 286.32] create anxiety it can be something that
[284.70 - 288.54] it's more important than what you're
[286.32 - 290.34] doing in that moment is more important
[288.54 - 293.82] than what's happening in that moment or
[290.34 - 295.08] that day it can confuse people a whole
[293.82 - 296.46] bunch of things that are happening with
[295.08 - 298.62] that so I want to go into blood sugar
[296.46 - 300.48] issues also monitoring blood sugar and
[298.62 - 301.86] so forth so let's go let's roll into it
[300.48 - 304.50] a little bit
[301.86 - 306.12] first and foremost
[304.50 - 307.98] somebody
[306.12 - 310.50] living their life
[307.98 - 312.60] perfectly fine
[310.50 - 316.98] they don't have a problem
[312.60 - 319.32] and then suddenly their A1C is rising
[316.98 - 321.54] they're at the doctor's office
[319.32 - 324.06] they get some blood work
[321.54 - 326.34] their A1C is up
[324.06 - 328.62] and something's wrong and they're like
[326.34 - 331.32] what's wrong right
[328.62 - 334.74] and what people don't realize is that
[331.32 - 337.62] it's a process over the years of three
[334.74 - 341.10] things breaking down the liver is the
[337.62 - 342.96] most popular one the most important one
[341.10 - 344.64] as far as with blood sugar to start with
[342.96 - 347.16] because the liver starts to get stagnant
[344.64 - 349.32] and sluggish and when it gets stagnant
[347.16 - 351.96] and sluggish and starts to break down it
[349.32 - 355.20] puts a burden on so many different
[351.96 - 356.46] levels on the body so the liver starts
[355.20 - 359.28] breaking down
[356.46 - 361.98] the ability to break down fats to
[359.28 - 364.08] disperse it with bile reserves that
[361.98 - 366.42] starts to break down and wear down
[364.08 - 368.52] so fats stay in the bloodstream even
[366.42 - 370.86] longer they stay in the liver even
[368.52 - 373.46] longer and that gets people in trouble
[370.86 - 373.46] so
[374.58 - 378.60] I want to bring this guy in here we're
[376.92 - 381.42] making uh
[378.60 - 383.16] stovetop macaroni and cheese
[381.42 - 384.60] and a little bit hang around for that
[383.16 - 386.90] because I would love to make that for
[384.60 - 386.90] you guys
[387.44 - 391.04] macaroni and cheese
[391.50 - 396.24] all right
[393.06 - 398.34] so people get stagnant sluggish livers
[396.24 - 400.86] they do
[398.34 - 403.50] most people who get the stagnosticish
[400.86 - 405.54] livers are getting it because they're on
[403.50 - 407.88] the high fat diets their whole life
[405.54 - 410.70] because everybody is eating a certain
[407.88 - 412.86] amount of fat every single day whether
[410.70 - 414.84] it's for breakfast lunch or dinner if
[412.86 - 416.70] you're intermittent fasting you're still
[414.84 - 418.98] going to eat fat at the end of the day
[416.70 - 420.96] you're going to have it either six
[418.98 - 422.58] o'clock eight o'clock at night nine
[420.96 - 424.14] o'clock at night four o'clock in the
[422.58 - 426.36] afternoon but you're going to end up
[424.14 - 427.98] eating fat at some point even when
[426.36 - 430.92] you're intermittent fasting
[427.98 - 432.24] but the fats over time burden and break
[430.92 - 434.16] down the liver
[432.24 - 436.20] and when it burns and breaks down the
[434.16 - 437.58] liver we end up getting blood sugar
[436.20 - 439.56] problems
[437.58 - 441.78] that's why type 2 diabetes when people
[439.56 - 444.72] start eating better and better
[441.78 - 448.44] suddenly they either need less insulin
[444.72 - 449.70] or the numbers appear better their A1C
[448.44 - 452.40] is better
[449.70 - 454.44] because their liver is not burdened down
[452.40 - 456.90] by Fats as much anymore so people be
[454.44 - 458.76] like well I don't do fast food anymore I
[456.90 - 461.34] don't do restaurant food anymore I don't
[458.76 - 465.42] do junk food you know greasy food fried
[461.34 - 467.22] food I'm doing lean animal protein I'm
[465.42 - 470.58] eating more salads
[467.22 - 471.84] I'm eating healthier and my A1C is
[470.58 - 474.06] dropping
[471.84 - 475.44] because their insulin resistance is
[474.06 - 477.48] reducing
[475.44 - 480.84] because what they were doing before
[477.48 - 482.52] though over the years LED them to a
[480.84 - 484.56] stagnant sluggish liver
[482.52 - 485.76] eventually putting a burden on their
[484.56 - 487.92] pancreas
[485.76 - 490.02] eventually creating a problem where it
[487.92 - 492.72] even weakened their adrenals and then
[490.02 - 495.84] their A1C started to climb
[492.72 - 498.18] so that's one way we get problems with
[495.84 - 501.30] blood sugar issues another is
[498.18 - 503.40] if pathogens get into the liver
[501.30 - 505.14] and someone has the Epstein-Barr virus
[503.40 - 507.12] the Epstein-Barr virus has been in the
[505.14 - 509.64] liver for a long time
[507.12 - 511.32] it's causing wear and tear it's
[509.64 - 512.82] producing a tremendous amount of
[511.32 - 516.00] byproduct
[512.82 - 518.40] that byproduct builds up in the liver it
[516.00 - 520.56] starts to get dysfunctional coupled with
[518.40 - 522.24] the high fat diet along the way
[520.56 - 524.94] and then the liver starts to break down
[522.24 - 527.16] and get sluggish and stagnant any kind
[524.94 - 531.78] of viruses the liver is like the virus
[527.16 - 534.42] home hhv six hhv7 said a regular virus
[531.78 - 536.58] shingles virus herpes simplex 1 Herpes
[534.42 - 540.12] Simplex 2 all the different Epstein-Barr
[536.58 - 542.64] viruses plus bacteria too all Harbor and
[540.12 - 543.54] hide inside people's livers and over
[542.64 - 545.46] time
[543.54 - 547.86] if we're not taking care of our liver
[545.46 - 550.62] and we're eating all these high fat
[547.86 - 552.66] dishes and high fat meals and all these
[550.62 - 555.24] Foods we're not supposed to be eating
[552.66 - 557.76] every every single day we're burdening
[555.24 - 559.38] the liver plus we're feeding most likely
[557.76 - 561.72] what the choices we're making we're
[559.38 - 565.02] feeding the bugs that reside inside the
[561.72 - 567.84] liver and then that grows oh more and
[565.02 - 570.42] more creating a a breakdown of the liver
[567.84 - 573.36] stagnant sluggish fatty liver usually
[570.42 - 576.00] too all around and then the blood sugar
[573.36 - 577.74] becomes unstable and people have
[576.00 - 579.78] problems and sure people can be like
[577.74 - 581.88] well I can go and start exercising I
[579.78 - 584.58] could get my life back if you're not
[581.88 - 586.50] chronically ill and you can exercise I'm
[584.58 - 588.48] gonna go and watch my diet I'm going to
[586.50 - 590.22] watch my calories I'm going to eat
[588.48 - 591.48] better maybe I'll do maybe I'll do a
[590.22 - 593.22] little intermittent fasting maybe I'll
[591.48 - 595.44] eat a healthier diet maybe I'll eat more
[593.22 - 597.78] salads whatever it is if they start
[595.44 - 600.18] noticing improvements their blood sugar
[597.78 - 602.40] comes down a little bit and they start
[600.18 - 605.34] to kind of recoup and they seem to get
[602.40 - 607.38] their bearings seem to get ahead of it
[605.34 - 609.72] but in the end it's not fixing the
[607.38 - 612.18] problem completely and they end up
[609.72 - 614.64] eating way too much fat no one fixes
[612.18 - 616.14] what's wrong as far as the viral issues
[614.64 - 619.10] that happen inside the liver and inside
[616.14 - 622.44] the body the breakdown of the the liver
[619.10 - 625.20] when it's actually infested with
[622.44 - 627.60] um pathogens and people don't get ahead
[625.20 - 629.70] of that so over time people just get
[627.60 - 632.64] sick and one thing that I think people
[629.70 - 635.16] have to understand that no matter what
[632.64 - 637.62] everybody is going to be sick with
[635.16 - 642.30] something no matter what you can see the
[637.62 - 644.30] best trainer on social you can see the
[642.30 - 646.44] um healthiest weight lifters
[644.30 - 647.42] bodybuilders on social they're still
[646.44 - 650.00] going to be sick with something
[647.42 - 653.30] eventually it doesn't make anybody
[650.00 - 656.40] indestructible nobody's indestructible
[653.30 - 657.96] people get sick no matter what and in
[656.40 - 660.06] the end they're gonna get sick if they
[657.96 - 662.10] get sick later on in life they get sick
[660.06 - 664.68] later on in life if they get sick in
[662.10 - 667.44] their 60s they get sick in their 60s
[664.68 - 670.62] they get sick in their 70s whichever it
[667.44 - 672.42] is it hits them one way or another
[670.62 - 674.52] so it's important to know really what's
[672.42 - 677.58] going inside in the body so you can
[674.52 - 680.16] avoid as many pitfalls as possible and
[677.58 - 683.46] get yourself to a place where you can at
[680.16 - 686.10] least avoid some of the worst conditions
[683.46 - 688.44] or some of the most Troublesome or
[686.10 - 691.32] mysterious conditions as you're living
[688.44 - 693.48] your life but either way when people say
[691.32 - 695.94] oh I'm gonna live forever well we can't
[693.48 - 697.44] live forever we can't live for hundreds
[695.94 - 699.90] and hundreds of years
[697.44 - 702.30] it's just not going to happen we're not
[699.90 - 704.04] going to live to be 500 years old we're
[702.30 - 707.76] not going to be lived to be 600 years
[704.04 - 709.50] old it's not going to happen so with
[707.76 - 711.54] that in mind we have to protect
[709.50 - 714.90] ourselves as good as we can and notice
[711.54 - 716.34] that people see young people and they
[714.90 - 717.66] think whoa I'm going to listen to that
[716.34 - 721.08] young person because that young person
[717.66 - 724.02] has it all down that 25 year old who's
[721.08 - 726.30] you know doing the bodybuilding
[724.02 - 728.88] who's eating all the right things it
[726.30 - 731.64] seems that's where I want to be that's
[728.88 - 734.40] who I want to be and don't realize that
[731.64 - 736.62] that's a far cry from chronic illness
[734.40 - 737.94] it's a far cry from mysterious chronic
[736.62 - 740.46] illness because you can get mysterious
[737.94 - 743.34] chronic illness at 19 years old 15 years
[740.46 - 745.86] old 10 years old 25 years old in
[743.34 - 748.68] whatever age and there's a big confusion
[745.86 - 751.44] to someone who actually is an athlete or
[748.68 - 753.66] someone who is young and strong
[751.44 - 755.94] to somebody who's chronically sick and
[753.66 - 758.28] actually has problems with their health
[755.94 - 760.20] that's mysterious like an autoimmune
[758.28 - 762.36] condition that they still don't
[760.20 - 764.10] understand or anything about what they
[762.36 - 767.58] about that autoimmune condition do they
[764.10 - 769.44] understand blood sugar is kind of this
[767.58 - 772.14] thing where it's a little bit taking
[769.44 - 773.94] over because you got all these people in
[772.14 - 775.44] the world right now that don't know why
[773.94 - 777.06] they're struggling they don't know why
[775.44 - 779.34] they have anxiety they don't know why
[777.06 - 781.08] they have depression or eczema and
[779.34 - 783.60] psoriasis they don't know why they have
[781.08 - 786.06] chronic fatigue syndrome and autoimmune
[783.60 - 787.68] diagnosis lupus they don't know why they
[786.06 - 790.02] have tingles and numbness and aches and
[787.68 - 791.94] pains and back pain body pain head pain
[790.02 - 792.78] they don't know why they have blurry
[791.94 - 794.46] eyes
[792.78 - 796.56] and they don't know why they have
[794.46 - 798.42] burning skin and Tinkles and numbness
[796.56 - 801.06] like I said before in Vertigo and
[798.42 - 802.08] dizziness and there's this group of
[801.06 - 804.48] people
[802.08 - 806.22] that doesn't know why so when they
[804.48 - 807.78] search around on social and they look
[806.22 - 809.40] around the internet they run across home
[807.78 - 810.90] maybe your blood sugar is it your blood
[809.40 - 813.72] sugars your blood sugar is your blood
[810.90 - 815.28] maybe it's that and then it feels like
[813.72 - 818.10] you can gain some kind of control
[815.28 - 820.68] monitoring your blood sugar not even if
[818.10 - 822.72] you're not a diabetic so then it's easy
[820.68 - 824.46] to fall into let me see my blood sugar
[822.72 - 826.14] and let me see what I'm eating and let
[824.46 - 828.18] me see what my blood sugar is doing but
[826.14 - 830.40] really that's a trap
[828.18 - 831.96] because it takes us away from really
[830.40 - 834.00] what's wrong
[831.96 - 836.40] the real things that are wrong and the
[834.00 - 839.36] real problems people have and why
[836.40 - 842.88] they're sick it pulls us away from that
[839.36 - 846.30] so we miss the ball we don't have our
[842.88 - 849.06] eyes on the right ball instead we end up
[846.30 - 852.36] falling into traps where we're checking
[849.06 - 854.64] our oxygen levels every hour we're
[852.36 - 857.84] checking our heart rate we're checking
[854.64 - 861.84] our blood sugar every hour or two hours
[857.84 - 863.58] and then it becomes this Obsession where
[861.84 - 865.56] our whole life is about our blood sugar
[863.58 - 867.60] and we're watching it and we're
[865.56 - 870.24] monitoring it and we're looking at our
[867.60 - 871.32] monitors and it's a different there's a
[870.24 - 873.54] big difference when you're a type 1
[871.32 - 875.58] diabetic or type 2 diabetic right and
[873.54 - 877.62] you want to keep an eye on it people
[875.58 - 880.86] shouldn't otherwise people shouldn't
[877.62 - 882.30] live their life worried about it
[880.86 - 884.52] athletes shouldn't live their life
[882.30 - 886.74] worrying about it just people who aren't
[884.52 - 889.26] athletic shouldn't worry about living
[886.74 - 890.58] their life worrying about it and in
[889.26 - 892.26] general in people who are chronically
[890.58 - 894.18] sick shouldn't worry about it either
[892.26 - 895.68] there's more important things to worry
[894.18 - 898.08] about
[895.68 - 899.70] um Melissa on IG says I haven't had any
[898.08 - 902.58] blood sugar issues since starting
[899.70 - 904.86] medical medium foods and that takes me
[902.58 - 906.48] to the next place is medical medium
[904.86 - 910.74] information
[906.48 - 913.14] medical medium Protocols are already
[910.74 - 915.36] blood sugar supporting
[913.14 - 917.22] they always were like medical medium
[915.36 - 920.82] Protocols are never like intermittent
[917.22 - 924.18] fast on coffee all day long make sure
[920.82 - 925.50] you stay on coffee you know make sure
[924.18 - 927.54] you're
[925.50 - 928.80] you know just drinking your coffee every
[927.54 - 930.96] single morning and throughout the
[928.80 - 933.96] afternoon intermittent fast
[930.96 - 936.30] and that's it until you eat sometime at
[933.96 - 939.24] some later point of the day there's ways
[936.30 - 942.54] to do it where you're not eating
[939.24 - 943.38] a whole bunch of intense heavy food in
[942.54 - 945.42] the morning
[943.38 - 947.40] where you can actually keep that away
[945.42 - 949.14] and you can still take care of yourself
[947.40 - 951.78] which leads to fats I want to talk about
[949.14 - 955.02] fats if you guys are open to that it
[951.78 - 957.78] plays a an enormous part of the blood
[955.02 - 960.66] sugar roll is how much fat intake we
[957.78 - 964.20] have how many fats we're consuming that
[960.66 - 966.18] plays a massive role into in blood sugar
[964.20 - 967.74] stability so I want to go into that a
[966.18 - 972.44] little bit too so I'm just going to move
[967.74 - 972.44] this guy over if you guys are okay
[973.20 - 976.38] and here's the other thing too
[974.64 - 978.90] intermittent fasting leads to blood
[976.38 - 982.10] sugar crashing that's something to
[978.90 - 982.10] understand all on its own
[982.50 - 985.16] foreign
[991.02 - 995.04] so what you see in front of me right
[992.76 - 997.56] here are adrenals
[995.04 - 999.00] and kidneys but you're looking at these
[997.56 - 1000.56] adrenal glands right on top of the
[999.00 - 1002.84] kidneys
[1000.56 - 1005.12] now adrenal glands are a critical part
[1002.84 - 1006.32] of how we keep blood sugar stable so
[1005.12 - 1007.42] when you're doing medical medium
[1006.32 - 1012.20] information
[1007.42 - 1014.60] you're restoring adrenal glands
[1012.20 - 1017.12] that includes if you're doing any of the
[1014.60 - 1020.48] medical medium cleanses if you're doing
[1017.12 - 1023.12] the 369 if you're doing the 369 Advance
[1020.48 - 1026.84] if you're doing the monocleens heavy
[1023.12 - 1029.84] metal detox whichever it is it's
[1026.84 - 1032.18] supporting of the adrenals it's why
[1029.84 - 1035.24] people are here it's a big part of why
[1032.18 - 1037.04] people heal and get stronger when
[1035.24 - 1039.32] they're doing medical medium protocols
[1037.04 - 1042.20] such as the medical medium cleanses the
[1039.32 - 1044.72] 28 day cleanse is supportive of the
[1042.20 - 1046.10] adrenals and there's something that I
[1044.72 - 1048.86] hear out there every now and then it's
[1046.10 - 1052.22] like I'm cleansing too hard
[1048.86 - 1054.56] it it's going to be hard on my adrenals
[1052.22 - 1056.90] I'm cleansing too hard it's too tough on
[1054.56 - 1059.12] my adrenals that's not true
[1056.90 - 1061.28] unless you're doing something that's not
[1059.12 - 1063.32] a medical medium cleanse maybe you're
[1061.28 - 1065.78] doing some other cleanse out there and
[1063.32 - 1067.58] then I can't speak for that I can't say
[1065.78 - 1069.80] well I don't know if that's hard on your
[1067.58 - 1071.96] journals I do know that just
[1069.80 - 1073.28] intermittent fasting alone is hard on
[1071.96 - 1076.58] the adrenals and this isn't an
[1073.28 - 1078.38] intermittent fasting show but I'm saying
[1076.58 - 1080.60] that because a lot of people are doing
[1078.38 - 1083.30] it and they're burning out their
[1080.60 - 1085.70] adrenals while they're doing it and
[1083.30 - 1087.50] that's really important to know so when
[1085.70 - 1089.36] you're doing like a medical medium 369
[1087.50 - 1091.94] or a mono cleanser heavy metal detox
[1089.36 - 1094.76] cleanser a 28 day cleanse
[1091.94 - 1097.64] a medical Medium you're supporting your
[1094.76 - 1100.40] adrenals even while you're cleansing
[1097.64 - 1103.94] even why poisons and toxins are leaving
[1100.40 - 1106.48] the body it's still supporting your
[1103.94 - 1109.88] adrenals not only supporting them
[1106.48 - 1112.04] restoring them and bringing them back
[1109.88 - 1114.32] but I think what happens there are other
[1112.04 - 1116.66] cleanses out there in the world in the
[1114.32 - 1119.36] industry Health industry that do hurt
[1116.66 - 1120.98] the adrenals and there are other cleanse
[1119.36 - 1123.86] cleanses out there and people do them
[1120.98 - 1126.32] that actually say oh my adrenals my
[1123.86 - 1128.60] adrenaline it's from too much cleansing
[1126.32 - 1131.12] but that's not MediCal medium
[1128.60 - 1133.40] information or medical medium cleanses
[1131.12 - 1135.20] that's a critical piece of information
[1133.40 - 1138.14] to understand
[1135.20 - 1140.48] now in order to protect the adrenals you
[1138.14 - 1142.64] have to have enough mineral salts enough
[1140.48 - 1145.28] Trace mineral salts
[1142.64 - 1147.26] so that's critical what you'll find on
[1145.28 - 1149.42] medical medium cleanses is you'll find
[1147.26 - 1152.84] this right here
[1149.42 - 1154.94] which is really important to see and you
[1152.84 - 1157.40] guys know what this is right here this
[1154.94 - 1158.84] is the celery juice
[1157.40 - 1162.08] celery juice
[1158.84 - 1163.88] is one of the most supportive for the
[1162.08 - 1165.32] adrenal glands because of the trace
[1163.88 - 1167.96] mineral salts
[1165.32 - 1169.70] critical for adrenals
[1167.96 - 1171.86] so somebody else's cleansed out there is
[1169.70 - 1172.88] not going to have celery juice in it I
[1171.86 - 1173.96] don't know what it's going to have in
[1172.88 - 1177.26] there maybe it's going to have some
[1173.96 - 1179.54] weird Paris parasitical blending send
[1177.26 - 1181.04] down and mix with water maybe it's going
[1179.54 - 1182.30] to have something else maybe they're
[1181.04 - 1184.58] going to say you can still do your
[1182.30 - 1187.10] coffee maybe they're going to say you
[1184.58 - 1188.78] can still do cacao nibs and your you
[1187.10 - 1190.22] know your cacao maybe it's going to be
[1188.78 - 1191.78] any of that maybe it's they're going to
[1190.22 - 1192.74] say you can still do your apple cider
[1191.78 - 1194.24] vinegar
[1192.74 - 1198.44] and they're going to tell you that's
[1194.24 - 1201.14] fine hey do your apple cider vinegar
[1198.44 - 1204.32] some cacao nibs right there
[1201.14 - 1206.84] some cocoa powder right there
[1204.32 - 1209.54] some apple cider vinegar right here
[1206.84 - 1211.70] all of those are destructive to the
[1209.54 - 1213.26] adrenal glands
[1211.70 - 1215.72] highly
[1213.26 - 1218.00] injurious to adrenal glands over time
[1215.72 - 1220.82] why am I saying this
[1218.00 - 1222.62] what does it matter because people are
[1220.82 - 1224.12] worried about blood sugar well if you're
[1222.62 - 1226.94] really worried about blood sugar then
[1224.12 - 1229.70] you might want to know what affects your
[1226.94 - 1232.52] blood sugar when adrenal glands weaken
[1229.70 - 1236.18] and start to break down when they start
[1232.52 - 1240.20] to go downhill your adrenals your blood
[1236.18 - 1244.28] sugar gets crazy unstable it just starts
[1240.20 - 1246.70] to go wacko important to know and so
[1244.28 - 1250.88] people with their high on their caffeine
[1246.70 - 1252.02] are high on their drugs right all these
[1250.88 - 1254.30] different things they're high on
[1252.02 - 1256.94] stimulants they're high on their coffee
[1254.30 - 1258.56] all the time
[1256.94 - 1260.06] they're high in their chocolate ice
[1258.56 - 1262.10] cream let's see if I have chocolate in
[1260.06 - 1263.66] here today I got chocolate ice cream
[1262.10 - 1265.94] they're high in their chocolate ice
[1263.66 - 1269.66] cream and their adrenals are taking a
[1265.94 - 1271.76] hit boom boom boom boom they're taking a
[1269.66 - 1273.08] hit every time you're having that cacao
[1271.76 - 1274.52] every time you're having that chocolate
[1273.08 - 1277.10] every time you're having your chocolate
[1274.52 - 1279.44] this is chocolate coconut ice cream that
[1277.10 - 1283.16] should be fine I'm just gonna have some
[1279.44 - 1286.10] chocolate coconut ice cream with almond
[1283.16 - 1287.06] milk in it totally different aw you
[1286.10 - 1290.12] don't know what you're talking about
[1287.06 - 1291.92] that one's safe and really good both
[1290.12 - 1294.80] people don't realize it's still gonna
[1291.92 - 1298.10] Hammer your adrenals and break them down
[1294.80 - 1300.02] over time very important enough
[1298.10 - 1301.70] so everybody's being trained to be on
[1300.02 - 1303.68] stimulants all the time
[1301.70 - 1305.66] it's like I'm on stimulants I'm on a
[1303.68 - 1308.06] high I'm trying to chase a high
[1305.66 - 1312.20] caffeine and stimulants
[1308.06 - 1314.42] add it to a high fat diet
[1312.20 - 1316.94] both of that is really hard because a
[1314.42 - 1318.74] high fat diet is stimulating all on its
[1316.94 - 1321.94] own so here's what happens when you go
[1318.74 - 1321.94] and you eat something like this
[1322.40 - 1329.96] when you eat a nice greasy cheeseburger
[1325.34 - 1332.90] tastes so good bite into it so yummy
[1329.96 - 1334.40] you're biting into that flesh with that
[1332.90 - 1338.00] cheese
[1334.40 - 1340.82] and it's greasy and delicious and juicy
[1338.00 - 1343.40] you get an adrenal High
[1340.82 - 1346.60] that's when it hits
[1343.40 - 1346.60] when you get your pizza
[1346.82 - 1351.32] and it could be a vegan pizza vegan
[1348.50 - 1354.20] pizza can be really high in fat totally
[1351.32 - 1356.24] jacked up with fat
[1354.20 - 1359.12] and when you get all that fat in your
[1356.24 - 1361.40] system your adrenals have to thin out
[1359.12 - 1363.92] your blood so your adrenals are pumping
[1361.40 - 1365.72] to thin out the blood and that's hard on
[1363.92 - 1368.42] the adrenals too
[1365.72 - 1370.40] so what you'll find is that when you're
[1368.42 - 1373.76] doing like a medical medium cleanse and
[1370.40 - 1377.54] 369 Advanced or the 28 day cleanse
[1373.76 - 1380.84] you see that the fats aren't there for a
[1377.54 - 1381.92] reason to finally restore your adrenal
[1380.84 - 1386.42] glands
[1381.92 - 1388.70] but giving you enough calories glucose
[1386.42 - 1391.52] to help keep you going to keep your
[1388.70 - 1393.68] brain going to make you strong keeping
[1391.52 - 1395.66] the fats out so you can cleanse poisons
[1393.68 - 1399.02] and toxins
[1395.66 - 1400.94] without getting sicker
[1399.02 - 1403.94] and that's really important right there
[1400.94 - 1407.00] on it so let's go into that a bit
[1403.94 - 1409.28] when people are eating too much high fat
[1407.00 - 1411.98] your pancreas takes a hip with that
[1409.28 - 1415.10] constantly
[1411.98 - 1417.62] so not only does your liver take a hit
[1415.10 - 1420.74] but your pancreas takes a hit
[1417.62 - 1423.32] so a lot of people are on high fat diets
[1420.74 - 1425.00] and it's hitting their pancreas hard
[1423.32 - 1426.62] it's hitting their adrenals hard because
[1425.00 - 1429.68] their adrenals are releasing all this
[1426.62 - 1432.32] adrenaline to thin out the blood
[1429.68 - 1435.50] because you need that adrenaline to move
[1432.32 - 1437.54] that fat around and help disperse it
[1435.50 - 1438.74] and then the liver's got to release all
[1437.54 - 1441.56] this bile
[1438.74 - 1443.72] and that takes us to like another level
[1441.56 - 1446.96] what happens is that
[1443.72 - 1449.90] everybody's on the high fat diets
[1446.96 - 1452.48] the liver's doing double time their
[1449.90 - 1456.32] adrenals are doing double time they're
[1452.48 - 1457.70] pancreas is doing double time
[1456.32 - 1460.46] all three
[1457.70 - 1462.38] and then something's got to give
[1460.46 - 1464.44] the A1c
[1462.38 - 1469.18] blood sugar instability
[1464.44 - 1469.18] hypoglycemia when it's uncalled for
[1470.26 - 1477.38] hyperglycemia when it's uncalled for
[1473.66 - 1479.78] blood sugar instability up and down
[1477.38 - 1481.82] goes down real fast
[1479.78 - 1485.36] goes up real fast
[1481.82 - 1487.64] isn't stabilized well you know I saw
[1485.36 - 1491.84] this new practitioner and they said you
[1487.64 - 1494.00] better eat some nuts with your cheese
[1491.84 - 1496.46] I saw this other new doctor and this
[1494.00 - 1499.52] other new doctor said I better eat like
[1496.46 - 1503.00] some salmon with berries
[1499.52 - 1505.46] I saw this other practitioner
[1503.00 - 1507.26] and that practitioner told me that I
[1505.46 - 1508.64] should have an apple with peanut butter
[1507.26 - 1510.86] on it
[1508.64 - 1512.78] it helped to keep the blood sugar stable
[1510.86 - 1515.06] another practitioners said I should have
[1512.78 - 1517.04] some tofu
[1515.06 - 1519.20] with some vegetables and that'll keep
[1517.04 - 1520.64] the blood sugar going it's like all this
[1519.20 - 1523.70] stuff you hear out there and there's a
[1520.64 - 1525.32] lot of confusion to food combining with
[1523.70 - 1529.28] blood sugar
[1525.32 - 1533.18] and that's where we run into a mess
[1529.28 - 1536.24] because if someone sells somebody the
[1533.18 - 1537.68] idea that you can monitor your blood
[1536.24 - 1541.42] sugar
[1537.68 - 1544.58] and food combined around it and watch it
[1541.42 - 1547.60] and as as if that is going to be a
[1544.58 - 1547.60] control for you
[1547.82 - 1551.72] then
[1549.02 - 1553.70] that's trouble trouble in Paradise all
[1551.72 - 1556.00] on its own so I want to cut into that a
[1553.70 - 1556.00] little bit
[1557.48 - 1564.08]  my husband's doctor just told him
[1561.14 - 1566.54] he's headed for diabetes now he is
[1564.08 - 1568.76] listening to me about eating better and
[1566.54 - 1571.70] applying some medical medium tools
[1568.76 - 1573.20] incredible congratulations to him I'm
[1571.70 - 1575.30] proud of him
[1573.20 - 1576.86] and I'm proud of you too see guys I'm
[1575.30 - 1578.84] just boiling a little water right here
[1576.86 - 1580.34] because I'm going to be cooking pasta in
[1578.84 - 1582.26] a little bit I'm going to make make some
[1580.34 - 1583.88] stovetop macaroni and cheese which
[1582.26 - 1586.88] sounds like not a good thing to eat at
[1583.88 - 1590.06] all sounds bad
[1586.88 - 1592.64] stovetop macaroni and cheese
[1590.06 - 1594.80] Elevate evolve says I'm not perfect with
[1592.64 - 1597.08] this information yet but I keep trying
[1594.80 - 1599.24] and don't give up I'm continuing to make
[1597.08 - 1601.70] progress even though I still struggle
[1599.24 - 1603.50] with food addiction I cannot express how
[1601.70 - 1605.98] grateful I am proud of you thank you for
[1603.50 - 1605.98] being here
[1606.34 - 1611.48] one of the three things starts to go
[1609.50 - 1613.28] bonkers
[1611.48 - 1615.02] whether it's the adrenal glands the
[1613.28 - 1616.70] liver or the pancreas
[1615.02 - 1619.10] you might be somebody where it's too
[1616.70 - 1621.08] adrenal glands and liver another person
[1619.10 - 1623.66] it's pancreas and liver another person
[1621.08 - 1626.30] it's adrenal glands and pancreas another
[1623.66 - 1629.80] person it's just the adrenal glands but
[1626.30 - 1634.82] when they start to go south blood sugar
[1629.80 - 1637.16] becomes unstable it drops too fast
[1634.82 - 1639.56] you get the shakes
[1637.16 - 1641.72] it goes up too fast
[1639.56 - 1645.62] you get the dizziness
[1641.72 - 1648.02] it goes down too fast you get both it
[1645.62 - 1649.46] goes all over the place and you go to
[1648.02 - 1650.84] this doctor and this doctor and this
[1649.46 - 1653.72] doctor see you're not diabetic you're
[1650.84 - 1655.82] not a diabetic but
[1653.72 - 1657.98] what I recommend is we monitor your
[1655.82 - 1660.56] blood sugar all the time and you make
[1657.98 - 1662.18] sure that you're doing your cheese
[1660.56 - 1665.54] sticks
[1662.18 - 1667.34] with some peanut butter an apple
[1665.54 - 1670.76] we got to make sure that you're doing
[1667.34 - 1672.26] just the right Blends or you're eating
[1670.76 - 1673.82] one thing here and then one thing here
[1672.26 - 1675.56] and a half an hour later one thing here
[1673.82 - 1676.94] one thing here it's a guessing game and
[1675.56 - 1679.18] that's the confusion but here's what's
[1676.94 - 1681.50] amazing about it all
[1679.18 - 1683.60] what you're going to see now and where
[1681.50 - 1686.48] we're heading to in Alternative Health
[1683.60 - 1688.10] and Wellness is you're going to see
[1686.48 - 1689.54] science
[1688.10 - 1691.52] you're going to see
[1689.54 - 1694.04] science
[1691.52 - 1696.62] like check this out
[1694.04 - 1698.54] here's how many people did this here's
[1696.62 - 1700.64] how many people tried that and it worked
[1698.54 - 1702.98] here's how many people did this there
[1700.64 - 1704.36] was a study that says this and you're
[1702.98 - 1706.28] going to see a lot of that and it's
[1704.36 - 1708.32] gonna you're gonna buy into it and in
[1706.28 - 1710.90] the end you're just going to be playing
[1708.32 - 1712.82] the same old guessing game with your
[1710.90 - 1714.98] health and chronic illness
[1712.82 - 1717.62] and all that's fine is if you're a
[1714.98 - 1719.42] healthy person everything seems okay
[1717.62 - 1721.28] and you're doing your exercising you're
[1719.42 - 1722.66] working out you're a trainer you're an
[1721.28 - 1725.42] athlete or you're somebody that just
[1722.66 - 1727.28] works out you eat good
[1725.42 - 1729.44] and you can just play with that you can
[1727.28 - 1731.66] play in that land where wow all these
[1729.44 - 1733.52] people good results at blood sugar if
[1731.66 - 1735.80] they try this let's do this monitor here
[1733.52 - 1737.30] let's try and all that's great but when
[1735.80 - 1739.58] you're chronically sick you're really
[1737.30 - 1741.20] sick and you've spent a lot of time on
[1739.58 - 1743.72] mattress island or in bed which is
[1741.20 - 1745.58] mattress island or couch Island it's an
[1743.72 - 1747.14] entirely different story it's back to
[1745.58 - 1749.18] the same old drawing board
[1747.14 - 1751.82] Lindsay on IG says I used to wear a
[1749.18 - 1754.82] glucose monitor and had crazy lows and
[1751.82 - 1757.22] highs of blood sugar and now it's all
[1754.82 - 1758.78] normalized and no need to wear a monitor
[1757.22 - 1760.78] thanks to Medical medium lifestyle which
[1758.78 - 1764.96] takes me to the next point
[1760.78 - 1768.14] mm info allows people
[1764.96 - 1770.38] to not have to go into eating disorder
[1768.14 - 1770.38] land
[1770.72 - 1778.08] blood sugar monitoring eating disorder
[1774.10 - 1779.42] OCD obsessive compulsive Behavior land
[1778.08 - 1782.36] [Music]
[1779.42 - 1784.88] it can help protect people and protect
[1782.36 - 1788.56] them from falling prey into going
[1784.88 - 1791.24] backwards I noticed something right now
[1788.56 - 1794.36] in the health movement
[1791.24 - 1797.48] is people can come out with a convincing
[1794.36 - 1799.46] approach suck a whole people a bunch of
[1797.48 - 1802.58] people in through advertisements and ads
[1799.46 - 1804.62] and money suck them down a funnel
[1802.58 - 1806.54] get them sold on something and now
[1804.62 - 1809.78] they're checking the blood sugar every
[1806.54 - 1813.50] half a freaking hour
[1809.78 - 1816.38] and you can lose your mind doing it
[1813.50 - 1818.48] you can lose your mind you get sold that
[1816.38 - 1821.24] it's control
[1818.48 - 1823.04] you're going to be achieving for
[1821.24 - 1825.52] yourself you're going to be sold that it
[1823.04 - 1830.48] means that you're in self-control now
[1825.52 - 1832.64] you are in control of your destiny of
[1830.48 - 1835.52] your life of your health you just wear
[1832.64 - 1837.68] that blood sugar monitor sign into this
[1835.52 - 1839.54] program make sure you look at all the
[1837.68 - 1842.02] stats and Things fill out all the stuff
[1839.54 - 1846.50] they want you to fill out pay a little
[1842.02 - 1848.72] 1999 or 39.99 here uh-huh
[1846.50 - 1852.38] and in the end
[1848.72 - 1854.24] you're chasing a unicorn
[1852.38 - 1858.80] is what you're doing
[1854.24 - 1862.04] and me I'd rather chase a unicorn
[1858.80 - 1863.72] than Chase an apparition
[1862.04 - 1866.48] of a unicorn
[1863.72 - 1869.24] and then find myself in the end just
[1866.48 - 1870.80] stuck back into the same old hell they
[1869.24 - 1872.54] don't know why I'm sick they don't know
[1870.80 - 1874.58] why I'm fatigued they don't know why I
[1872.54 - 1876.98] have eczema or psoriasis they don't know
[1874.58 - 1879.74] why I'm dizzy blurry eyes aches and
[1876.98 - 1881.54] pains my legs feel like sandbags my arms
[1879.74 - 1884.06] feel like sandbags I got tingles and
[1881.54 - 1885.74] numbness I got vertigo tinnitus all
[1884.06 - 1888.08] kinds of popping sounds in my ears
[1885.74 - 1890.90] infections lung infections I don't feel
[1888.08 - 1892.52] good I catch the flu or the sea every
[1890.90 - 1895.40] single month
[1892.52 - 1899.18] and most of my time is spent
[1895.40 - 1902.54] on the couch or in bed and I got sucked
[1899.18 - 1906.10] into a whole nother scam and
[1902.54 - 1906.10] that's what happens to people every day
[1906.62 - 1911.72] so Michelle says people didn't know how
[1909.14 - 1913.10] to get enough calories without fat they
[1911.72 - 1916.70] did not
[1913.10 - 1919.94] mean info put that out there to get
[1916.70 - 1922.52] calories enough without all of the fats
[1919.94 - 1925.40] yeah so people don't know how to get
[1922.52 - 1927.08] enough calories it's true
[1925.40 - 1928.88] and if you know medical meme information
[1927.08 - 1930.98] you can learn that you can get enough
[1928.88 - 1933.44] calories and do it right
[1930.98 - 1935.96] so you can sustain yourself and protect
[1933.44 - 1938.06] your adrenals but going back to this
[1935.96 - 1942.70] very important point one thing I hear
[1938.06 - 1945.38] every now and then that was kind of
[1942.70 - 1946.94] chanted into the medical medium
[1945.38 - 1950.24] community
[1946.94 - 1951.92] was I'm detoxing too fast it's hard on
[1950.24 - 1953.30] my adrenals
[1951.92 - 1955.16] no
[1953.30 - 1958.46] it's not
[1955.16 - 1960.26] unless you're doing something
[1958.46 - 1965.12] that isn't
[1960.26 - 1969.14] what you should be or could be doing
[1965.12 - 1972.56] unless you're doing something that isn't
[1969.14 - 1975.02] what you're supposed to be doing
[1972.56 - 1978.38] very important to know
[1975.02 - 1979.58] it's like it's like literally a zombie
[1978.38 - 1983.12] bite
[1979.58 - 1987.20] a zombie bite I'm detoxing too much it
[1983.12 - 1990.22] must be hard on my adrenals no
[1987.20 - 1993.26] nothing is hard on the adrenals
[1990.22 - 1995.06] unless you're doing something to be hard
[1993.26 - 1996.26] on your adrenals
[1995.06 - 1998.66] that's all
[1996.26 - 2000.34] that's all what's hard on your adrenals
[1998.66 - 2002.44] caffeine are you doing chocolate just
[2000.34 - 2004.74] want to know do I have to do fly on the
[2002.44 - 2004.74] wall again
[2005.56 - 2010.36] and usually people are feeling real
[2007.60 - 2011.62] symptoms and it's not detox it's real
[2010.36 - 2014.50] symptoms
[2011.62 - 2017.08] I'm sure some people do feel the malaise
[2014.50 - 2020.26] of an intense detox if they were really
[2017.08 - 2024.04] toxic and really sick to begin with but
[2020.26 - 2025.78] even then it's not what people think
[2024.04 - 2029.50] meanwhile so many people are going
[2025.78 - 2031.84] through fat withdrawal MSC MSG
[2029.50 - 2033.76] withdrawal chocolate withdrawal how much
[2031.84 - 2035.50] chocolate are you on how much coffee are
[2033.76 - 2037.48] you on
[2035.50 - 2039.04] how much MSG are you on or you want
[2037.48 - 2041.80] nutritional yeast because that stuff
[2039.04 - 2044.08] makes you high do you know why people
[2041.80 - 2046.84] need to pound that stuff
[2044.08 - 2049.62] like they need to pound it like I know
[2046.84 - 2052.72] people where it's not a teaspoon of
[2049.62 - 2054.28] nutritional yeast
[2052.72 - 2058.06] it's
[2054.28 - 2060.04] a court of it like they have to pound it
[2058.06 - 2063.40] in the recipes it tastes like cheese
[2060.04 - 2065.26] it's so good it's it's like the Brewer
[2063.40 - 2066.70] Yeast was it's just yummy the
[2065.26 - 2069.00] nutritional yeast of Brewer Yeast
[2066.70 - 2072.82] because of that MSG we get high on it
[2069.00 - 2075.28] and boom our neurons are going off and
[2072.82 - 2077.44] firing off
[2075.28 - 2080.74] and people are so used to being high all
[2077.44 - 2083.14] day when you come off of it you feel
[2080.74 - 2085.36] you really feel it
[2083.14 - 2087.58] you aren't High Enough
[2085.36 - 2089.98] then you come off
[2087.58 - 2091.90] and you feel it you go through a
[2089.98 - 2094.08] withdrawal if you were up here all the
[2091.90 - 2094.08] time
[2094.42 - 2096.96] so
[2099.34 - 2101.80] we're talking about blood sugar if you
[2100.72 - 2103.90] guys just got here we're gonna make a
[2101.80 - 2105.76] stovetop macaroni and cheese we're gonna
[2103.90 - 2108.16] do that in a few minutes just covering
[2105.76 - 2110.26] some blood sugar information let's go
[2108.16 - 2112.36] into vinegar and apple cider vinegar so
[2110.26 - 2114.22] people believe
[2112.36 - 2116.32] in the health field that apple cider
[2114.22 - 2117.94] vinegar stabilizes blood sugar
[2116.32 - 2122.08] and
[2117.94 - 2126.72] no it doesn't but what
[2122.08 - 2126.72] vinegar does apple cider vinegar does
[2127.84 - 2132.88] is it destroys the bones
[2130.18 - 2135.88] it destroys the teeth
[2132.88 - 2138.90] it ruins teeth
[2135.88 - 2142.78] you do 10 years of apple cider vinegar
[2138.90 - 2145.48] eventually your teeth will dissolve from
[2142.78 - 2148.78] the inside out
[2145.48 - 2154.90] from the inside out
[2148.78 - 2157.66] I don't know how or in what way or
[2154.90 - 2160.18] I don't know if it takes an angel
[2157.66 - 2163.54] coming out of the sky
[2160.18 - 2166.74] I don't know if it takes
[2163.54 - 2169.78] a gigantic squid coming out of the ocean
[2166.74 - 2171.04] I don't know and devours a ship I don't
[2169.78 - 2173.08] know what it's going to take for people
[2171.04 - 2175.42] to stop their vinegar or to learn what
[2173.08 - 2178.96] their vinegar does to them I'm doing
[2175.42 - 2181.96] medical medium and it's hurting me
[2178.96 - 2185.74] I'm doing medical medium and I it ruined
[2181.96 - 2189.16] my health I did medical medium
[2185.74 - 2191.02] no what you did was vinegar
[2189.16 - 2192.46] you couldn't stay away from it it was
[2191.02 - 2194.50] impossible it was in every single
[2192.46 - 2196.30] condiment in your refrigerator
[2194.50 - 2199.84] it was your apple cider vinegar shots
[2196.30 - 2203.14] you did lots of chocolate don't say you
[2199.84 - 2205.72] didn't do lots of chocolate you ate in
[2203.14 - 2209.64] restaurants which was loaded with canola
[2205.72 - 2209.64] oil and vinegar and MSG
[2210.10 - 2213.66] you did your popcorn
[2214.00 - 2219.10] you did your high fats because you were
[2216.82 - 2223.24] only low fat or no fat for two weeks or
[2219.10 - 2225.16] three weeks in your life if at best if
[2223.24 - 2228.22] at best
[2225.16 - 2230.68] and with all that probably ups and downs
[2228.22 - 2234.46] and challenges and deficiencies you had
[2230.68 - 2236.56] long before medical medium information
[2234.46 - 2242.14] came your way
[2236.56 - 2245.38] severe severe deficiencies in your life
[2242.14 - 2248.80] see eganza says your books are amazing
[2245.38 - 2250.84] cleared my acne I've had since 13 years
[2248.80 - 2253.60] old I'm 34
[2250.84 - 2255.82] now happy to implement
[2253.60 - 2257.92] mm protocols
[2255.82 - 2260.10] which leads me to this topic I wanted to
[2257.92 - 2260.10] say
[2261.16 - 2265.84] people can heal
[2263.68 - 2268.18] they actually can
[2265.84 - 2271.42] it really can
[2268.18 - 2274.38] and I don't judge people I don't judge
[2271.42 - 2277.68] them for what their
[2274.38 - 2277.68] intercepted by
[2277.78 - 2281.50] what's happening in health and wellness
[2279.46 - 2285.40] is not like it was six years ago four
[2281.50 - 2289.00] years ago eight years ago 15 years ago
[2285.40 - 2290.98] it is a smorgasbord of
[2289.00 - 2294.06] I'm not saying it because I'm like Mr
[2290.98 - 2296.50] Big Man the medical medium's the best
[2294.06 - 2298.96] I'm the best
[2296.50 - 2302.32] has nothing to do with it
[2298.96 - 2304.24] this information comes from above
[2302.32 - 2306.58] is where it comes from I'm just a
[2304.24 - 2308.08] messenger but it's important for people
[2306.58 - 2309.46] to know
[2308.08 - 2312.28] that yeah
[2309.46 - 2314.68] the environment has changed people get
[2312.28 - 2316.78] lost easy out there and they're trying
[2314.68 - 2319.12] so many different things it took all
[2316.78 - 2321.34] these years
[2319.12 - 2323.44] with the fight I had to fight to try to
[2321.34 - 2325.24] get alcohol out of herbal tinctures did
[2323.44 - 2328.06] you guys know this
[2325.24 - 2330.34] there's more glycerin tinctures out
[2328.06 - 2332.32] there in the world now without alcohol
[2330.34 - 2333.16] because of medical movement from the
[2332.32 - 2336.06] fight
[2333.16 - 2336.06] the fight
[2336.70 - 2342.22] even people I won't mention their name
[2338.98 - 2343.78] popular so-called popular in the genre
[2342.22 - 2346.18] of health and healing
[2343.78 - 2348.70] different doctors and stuff like that
[2346.18 - 2349.90] pounded people to death with alcoholic
[2348.70 - 2353.02] tinctures
[2349.90 - 2355.66] just grain alcohol pounded them to death
[2353.02 - 2358.24] with corn grain alcohol
[2355.66 - 2359.92] it took years to get alcohol out of
[2358.24 - 2362.08] supplements and it's still in there and
[2359.92 - 2364.00] it's still out there but but it's less
[2362.08 - 2368.80] than it ever was
[2364.00 - 2371.74] but then social happens and
[2368.80 - 2373.48] the amount of advertisements and
[2371.74 - 2376.24] products that have junk and garbage in
[2373.48 - 2378.70] them food products that have junk and
[2376.24 - 2381.22] garbage in them it's just no way to keep
[2378.70 - 2383.50] things clean out there and I don't judge
[2381.22 - 2384.88] people if they turn around and they
[2383.50 - 2386.44] leave medical medium for five seconds
[2384.88 - 2388.54] they take their attention off and now
[2386.44 - 2391.06] they hear some dude say no you actually
[2388.54 - 2392.56] cacao powder is really good for you
[2391.06 - 2394.12] it's helpful it's helpful for your
[2392.56 - 2396.82] adrenals it's helpful for your heart

[2396.82 - 2401.38] to be brain
[2398.80 - 2403.72] so easy and then you're like whoa I love
[2401.38 - 2405.28] chocolate I'm gonna be on chocolate
[2403.72 - 2406.78] you should do apple cider vinegar
[2405.28 - 2408.04] because apple cider vinegar is the real
[2406.78 - 2409.54] thing and make sure you do it with
[2408.04 - 2410.92] Mother you shouldn't do the other
[2409.54 - 2412.60] vinegars but wait a minute medical
[2410.92 - 2413.92] medium once told me and I'm forgetting
[2412.60 - 2416.14] right now somehow I'm forgetting
[2413.92 - 2417.82] something's taking over my brain
[2416.14 - 2419.86] I thought medical meme says that apple
[2417.82 - 2422.56] cider vinegar actually dissolves your
[2419.86 - 2424.96] teeth and can actually damage your liver
[2422.56 - 2426.64] and actually hurt your health in your
[2424.96 - 2428.26] connective tissue wait I'm forgetting it
[2426.64 - 2429.88] for some reason I'm forgetting it there
[2428.26 - 2432.34] it goes I forgot I don't even remember
[2429.88 - 2433.72] medical medium apple cider vinegar is
[2432.34 - 2435.40] that good I'm going to take some shots
[2433.72 - 2436.96] of it now maybe it'll help my blood
[2435.40 - 2442.54] sugar
[2436.96 - 2445.00] it's easy to get derailed by the amount
[2442.54 - 2447.28] the amount of propaganda that's out
[2445.00 - 2449.44] there both in the vegan land and the
[2447.28 - 2453.82] animal protein land all of it I see
[2449.44 - 2455.98] people putting liver in their smoothies
[2453.82 - 2457.48] animal live I don't I have nothing
[2455.98 - 2459.76] against people eating eating animal
[2457.48 - 2461.20] products medical medium information is
[2459.76 - 2463.06] about you can eat animal products and
[2461.20 - 2464.56] learn the information and heal and still
[2463.06 - 2468.52] do it on animal products you can do it
[2464.56 - 2470.02] on plant-based you can do it vegetarian
[2468.52 - 2472.42] you just have to learn the information
[2470.02 - 2475.08] so you can heal people are putting some
[2472.42 - 2478.06] of the most toxic stuff I've ever seen
[2475.08 - 2481.84] ever in their smoothies they're putting
[2478.06 - 2485.44] actual beef liver which is the toxic
[2481.84 - 2486.70] waste the toxic dump they're putting in
[2485.44 - 2488.32] there
[2486.70 - 2490.60] these are the things that are going on
[2488.32 - 2492.34] out there and I'm not even scratching
[2490.60 - 2494.56] the surface
[2492.34 - 2496.48] Shamrocks and sunflowers says actually a
[2494.56 - 2498.46] medical medium is the best
[2496.48 - 2502.42] it's the only thing that is healing My
[2498.46 - 2505.14] IC and I tried everything
[2502.42 - 2505.14] it's incredible

[2511.12 - 2515.68] about swelling that's that's a really
[2513.40 - 2518.08] great episode it was an Enlightenment

[2554.20 - 2559.38] have that boiling for a while so I'm
[2556.12 - 2559.38] going to add a little bit more water
[2565.91 - 2571.90] [Music]
[2568.24 - 2575.46] it's really hard watching people
[2571.90 - 2575.46] become slaves
[2577.66 - 2583.48] slaves
[2580.42 - 2587.58] the blood sugar scam
[2583.48 - 2587.58] that's happening out there in the world
[2588.40 - 2592.78] I know we want control and we want to
[2591.40 - 2595.60] feel like
[2592.78 - 2597.46] we have full control over our health and
[2595.60 - 2598.78] wellness
[2597.46 - 2600.88] but
[2598.78 - 2603.16] every prediction
[2600.88 - 2604.90] if that's what you want to call it
[2603.16 - 2606.70] every prediction
[2604.90 - 2609.52] that I put out there
[2606.70 - 2613.02] comes through over the years comes truth
[2609.52 - 2613.02] one way or another
[2614.32 - 2619.36] every
[2615.46 - 2622.48] time I say something like carnivore
[2619.36 - 2625.50] people are going to be on honey
[2622.48 - 2625.50] and apples
[2625.54 - 2629.34] they end up on honey and apples
[2629.56 - 2633.34] the plant-based people all go back to
[2631.78 - 2635.20] eggs right when they leave plant-based
[2633.34 - 2636.76] they go back to eggs set it for years
[2635.20 - 2639.40] long before
[2636.76 - 2642.40] whatever it is
[2639.40 - 2646.18] long C is Epstein-Barr and then it comes
[2642.40 - 2649.60] out later that long C is Epstein-Barr
[2646.18 - 2651.04] multiple sclerosis is caused by obscene
[2649.60 - 2654.34] bar infections
[2651.04 - 2656.50] published it first and then years later
[2654.34 - 2659.74] science puts it out
[2656.50 - 2662.56] that's the cause of multiple sclerosis
[2659.74 - 2664.54] and these are just a few things
[2662.56 - 2665.80] and I'm telling you now the whole blood
[2664.54 - 2668.50] sugar game
[2665.80 - 2669.82] where you got a monitor stuck to you and
[2668.50 - 2672.22] you're playing around with graphs and
[2669.82 - 2674.20] charts and you're signing up to stuff
[2672.22 - 2675.28] and you're eating this food in this in
[2674.20 - 2676.60] combination and eating this in
[2675.28 - 2678.64] combination you're looking at your butts
[2676.60 - 2681.28] you're completely getting smoking
[2678.64 - 2684.18] mirrors bait and switch
[2681.28 - 2684.18] is what's happening
[2685.42 - 2688.90] so I'm making the stovetop mac and
[2687.70 - 2690.94] cheese
[2688.90 - 2692.68] and even with me saying all of that I'm
[2690.94 - 2694.36] making macaroni and cheese and you might
[2692.68 - 2696.22] be like that guy's crazy
[2694.36 - 2699.06] everything he just told me and he's
[2696.22 - 2699.06] making mac and cheese
[2699.70 - 2704.14] but it's mac and cheese without the bad
[2702.22 - 2705.88] stuff Michelle says my family won't
[2704.14 - 2707.74] listen even though I've helped them
[2705.88 - 2710.40] before
[2707.74 - 2710.40] I understand
[2710.74 - 2715.24] so I'm about to
[2712.78 - 2718.62] make some good stuff right here I'm
[2715.24 - 2718.62] going to get the potatoes ready
[2719.95 - 2723.19] [Music]
[2729.88 - 2735.64] [Music]
[2733.06 - 2738.34] I'm making a fat free
[2735.64 - 2740.92] cheese for the macaroni so it's stovetop
[2738.34 - 2742.72] macaroni and cheese cheese it's not
[2740.92 - 2743.86] vegan cheese in the sense where you know
[2742.72 - 2745.42] the vegan cheese you can buy in the
[2743.86 - 2746.80] store which is loaded with natural
[2745.42 - 2749.44] flavors
[2746.80 - 2750.58] it could be loaded with soy to be loaded
[2749.44 - 2752.56] with all kinds of different things maybe
[2750.58 - 2753.82] it's an almond cheese maybe it's
[2752.56 - 2755.26] something like that but there's always
[2753.82 - 2757.84] something in there
[2755.26 - 2759.40] that shouldn't be in there
[2757.84 - 2761.62] and there's always a percentage of
[2759.40 - 2763.06] something bad in there that shouldn't be
[2761.62 - 2764.47] in there either
[2763.06 - 2765.58] now
[2764.47 - 2767.86] [Music]
[2765.58 - 2769.60] how do we stabilize our blood sugar like
[2767.86 - 2772.30] the true way of stabilizing our blood
[2769.60 - 2774.10] sugar we minimize the fat intake in our
[2772.30 - 2776.26] diet
[2774.10 - 2779.74] we lower it
[2776.26 - 2782.50] and it all depends on where you're at
[2779.74 - 2783.46] is it your pancreas your adrenals and
[2782.50 - 2786.88] your liver
[2783.46 - 2789.22] that are struggling is it just your
[2786.88 - 2790.90] liver is it just your adrenals whatever
[2789.22 - 2793.06] it is that's happening out of those
[2790.90 - 2794.80] three
[2793.06 - 2798.10] and most people
[2794.80 - 2799.48] it's liver and adrenals whichever it is
[2798.10 - 2801.94] though
[2799.48 - 2803.62] once you start removing some of the fats
[2801.94 - 2806.08] out of your diet
[2803.62 - 2808.60] eating
[2806.08 - 2811.48] enough calories
[2808.60 - 2814.96] that are in the safe Zone
[2811.48 - 2817.42] making sure you're hydrated just enough
[2814.96 - 2819.88] blood sugar problems start to dwindle
[2817.42 - 2822.10] and start to disappear
[2819.88 - 2824.02] it's something that you don't want to
[2822.10 - 2825.70] have to worry about I don't worry about
[2824.02 - 2828.76] my blood sugar

[2935.80 - 2939.34] countless studies out there it doesn't
[2937.30 - 2941.08] matter if it makes me feel crazy or if

[2941.08 - 2944.74] it makes me feel depressed and sad or
[2942.94 - 2946.78] I'm crying in a corner or I need another
[2944.74 - 2948.10] Square it doesn't matter if I'm addicted
[2946.78 - 2951.16] and I gotta have the chocolate bar
[2948.10 - 2952.48] there's countless studies that says this
[2951.16 - 2955.14] chocolate's so good for me I'm just

[2963.40 - 2967.18] going to have a square because that
[2964.96 - 2969.52] shit's crazy that's why because you know
[2967.18 - 2971.08] it ain't good for you and that's why
[2969.52 - 2972.58] you're eating a square if it was good
[2971.08 - 2975.16] for you you'd be eating two or three
[2972.58 - 2980.44] chocolate bars every single day boom
[2975.16 - 2983.80] ninety percent cacao 70 cacao whatever
[2980.44 - 2986.02] because the stimulant gets you high
[2983.80 - 2989.20] and you don't like the way it feels but
[2986.02 - 2991.54] there's payback baby there's cause and
[2989.20 - 2993.88] effect when you eat that chocolate what
[2991.54 - 2995.92] goes up must come down and guess what
[2993.88 - 3000.00] comes down and guess what gets shot and
[2995.92 - 3003.80] guess what gets beat up is your adrenals

[3041.70 - 3046.26] about those drugs they know I know about
[3043.74 - 3048.42] that bad study they said where asbestos
[3046.26 - 3050.64] was really good for us and that millions
[3048.42 - 3053.16] of people are dead because asbestos
[3050.64 - 3055.32] cancer I know the studies were they
[3053.16 - 3059.36] always say they're right but they say
[3055.32 - 3059.36] the cacao study is right

[3158.28 - 3163.56] things
[3159.60 - 3166.14] but don't throw the scientific BS at me
[3163.56 - 3167.82] about what a study is on cacao because
[3166.14 - 3170.34] women know
[3167.82 - 3171.30] did they got all be careful with that
[3170.34 - 3175.26] stuff
[3171.30 - 3178.44] for a lot of reasons they know that
[3175.26 - 3183.00] stuff will make them sick
[3178.44 - 3185.46] jacked up panic attacks wiped out and
[3183.00 - 3187.64] addicted like you're a fiend in a like a
[3185.46 - 3187.64] fiend

[3212.88 - 3217.62] thing I stopped following you and I
[3215.82 - 3218.88] don't know I I don't really read your
[3217.62 - 3222.18] books

[3229.56 - 3234.06] because of it that's not it life's hard
[3231.66 - 3235.98] if chocolate's all you're on and you're
[3234.06 - 3238.86] not on something far worse
[3235.98 - 3240.48] that's a miracle all in its own that's
[3238.86 - 3242.04] how screwed up this world is if you're
[3240.48 - 3242.88] not drinking a pint of whiskey every
[3242.04 - 3245.94] night
[3242.88 - 3247.56] then you know what exactly
[3245.94 - 3250.20] if you're not doing a ton of
[3247.56 - 3252.66] cocaine like every night this is amazing
[3250.20 - 3254.10] that's how crazy this world is and
[3252.66 - 3257.18] that's how messed up this world is I'm
[3254.10 - 3257.18] gonna pop some pasta in here
[3258.54 - 3263.84] but
[3260.52 - 3263.84] I'm just saying
[3265.56 - 3269.06] I'm just saying
[3275.52 - 3280.32] the pasta I'm using is on the medical
[3277.74 - 3282.80] medium directory
[3280.32 - 3282.80] foreign
[3283.88 - 3288.54] pasta is on the medical medium directory
[3287.34 - 3290.22] you know when you're watching Youtube
[3288.54 - 3292.56] and stuff and you see all the ads come
[3290.22 - 3294.12] in and now people are doing is they're
[3292.56 - 3295.32] actually doing their own like ads right
[3294.12 - 3296.82] in the middle they're like telling a
[3295.32 - 3298.56] story and then all of a sudden it leaves
[3296.82 - 3299.70] there and it gets edited and now they're
[3298.56 - 3304.44] like
[3299.70 - 3306.18] if you sign up for our 39.99 blah blah
[3304.44 - 3307.86] blah blah and you gotta wait for him to
[3306.18 - 3310.04] stop and it's like okay back to the
[3307.86 - 3310.04] story
[3315.36 - 3321.42] cheese in a little bit too but I just
[3317.10 - 3324.36] want to wait just a little bit
[3321.42 - 3327.18] before I make that but I am gonna peel
[3324.36 - 3329.58] the potatoes you want this to be like
[3327.18 - 3331.68] a cheese where you don't want the skins
[3329.58 - 3334.02] on the potatoes
[3331.68 - 3336.00] so I'm taking a fork and just taking
[3334.02 - 3338.22] this you don't want to like a brown
[3336.00 - 3340.14] cheese this is going to be
[3338.22 - 3342.60] a beautiful
[3340.14 - 3348.02] delicious cheese without the nutritional
[3342.60 - 3348.02] yeast the MSG without the additives
[3348.12 - 3354.92] this beats any vegan cheese out there I
[3350.94 - 3354.92] don't care what anybody says hands down
[3358.26 - 3362.40] I mean some of the vegan cheeses are so
[3360.36 - 3364.14] bad out there I'm like unless you have
[3362.40 - 3366.00] an issue you're probably better off with
[3364.14 - 3369.50] the Cow Cheese
[3366.00 - 3369.50] that's pure
[3369.54 - 3373.80] I mean that's how bad the vegan cheeses

[3553.62 - 3558.38] so it's really good
[3555.06 - 3558.38] so let's go into it a little bit
[3562.44 - 3566.34] Lauren says what if your nutritional
[3564.06 - 3568.62] yeast doesn't have MSG
[3566.34 - 3571.80] that's the problem
[3568.62 - 3575.16] I'm really glad you said that
[3571.80 - 3577.80] really glad listen to my podcast about
[3575.16 - 3581.94] nutritional yeast
[3577.80 - 3584.58] there is no nutritional yeast that
[3581.94 - 3586.80] doesn't have MSG
[3584.58 - 3591.24] there is no
[3586.80 - 3594.12] nutritional yeast that doesn't have MSG
[3591.24 - 3597.56] there's no apple cider vinegar
[3594.12 - 3597.56] that doesn't kill your liver
[3598.80 - 3603.12] burnout
[3600.30 - 3605.58] your stomach lands in your stomach and
[3603.12 - 3608.16] kill your HCL
[3605.58 - 3610.68] and dissolve your bones and teeth there
[3608.16 - 3613.46] is no apple cider vinegar that does not
[3610.68 - 3613.46] do that
[3615.00 - 3620.10] you guys know what happened
[3617.34 - 3623.52] do you remember
[3620.10 - 3626.70] when conventional wisdom
[3623.52 - 3628.20] and conventional Medical Science said it
[3626.70 - 3632.58] is safe
[3628.20 - 3636.00] to breathe in asbestos it is safe
[3632.58 - 3637.62] to have lead in gasoline it is safe to
[3636.00 - 3641.82] smoke
[3637.62 - 3645.24] it is safe to have lead in paint chips
[3641.82 - 3647.28] it is safe to take a thousand drugs that
[3645.24 - 3649.08] they took off the market
[3647.28 - 3650.94] because they had to pull them from the
[3649.08 - 3653.64] market because they weren't safe
[3650.94 - 3656.94] are you forgetting that whole thing that
[3653.64 - 3659.22] happened because in alternative medicine
[3656.94 - 3662.16] they're doing the same thing
[3659.22 - 3663.66] chocolate's good for you
[3662.16 - 3665.04] and maybe if you're not chronically sick
[3663.66 - 3667.38] and you want to play with a little bit
[3665.04 - 3668.76] of chocolate so be it
[3667.38 - 3670.26] but if you're somebody that's really
[3668.76 - 3671.70] struggling with a chronic illness that's
[3670.26 - 3673.32] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[3671.70 - 3676.08] like death by a Thousand Cuts remember
[3673.32 - 3678.12] I'm talking about like what chips away
[3676.08 - 3680.60] at you when you're already struggling
[3678.12 - 3680.60] and sick
[3684.78 - 3689.28] alternative medicine in Wellness Health
[3687.18 - 3692.70] and Wellness has made it
[3689.28 - 3695.36] that's good that's dumb has made it
[3692.70 - 3698.04] so that
[3695.36 - 3700.34] they tell you everything is good and it
[3698.04 - 3700.34] isn't
[3701.46 - 3705.20] I've never been the food police
[3709.26 - 3712.46] I need a place to put this pot
[3713.76 - 3716.36] right
[3719.22 - 3726.72] guys bear with me a little bit
[3722.22 - 3729.50] I am just getting some macaroni here

[3740.58 - 3746.04] anything they want
[3743.22 - 3749.10] if that means I have to go to the store
[3746.04 - 3753.36] and pick up something
[3749.10 - 3757.02] that's on the medical medium warning
[3753.36 - 3758.94] warning don't eat if you're sick
[3757.02 - 3761.46] even if it's something like that I'll go
[3758.94 - 3763.98] pick it up if I got company over and
[3761.46 - 3765.48] they're like well I'm hankering for this

[3793.08 - 3795.66] okay
[3794.34 - 3799.34] so what I'm gonna do is pop these
[3795.66 - 3799.34] potatoes in the food processor
[3800.64 - 3805.26] I'm not the food police one of my
[3802.74 - 3808.50] friends or family come over I don't tell
[3805.26 - 3809.88] them what they should eat I'll prepare
[3808.50 - 3812.70] them something
[3809.88 - 3814.08] anything they want
[3812.70 - 3816.12] and
[3814.08 - 3817.86] I'll tell them about options and stuff
[3816.12 - 3819.72] to heal or
[3817.86 - 3821.76] tell them about some good stuff they can
[3819.72 - 3824.36] have
[3821.76 - 3824.36] all right
[3824.46 - 3829.52] I'm gonna get these potatoes in here I'm
[3826.62 - 3829.52] gonna cut them in pieces
[3831.42 - 3836.36] so I'm just gonna actually break them
[3833.64 - 3836.36] down a little bit
[3848.58 - 3850.76] foreign
[3852.54 - 3856.74] but if you're really sick
[3854.70 - 3858.96] and you want to go as far as you can
[3856.74 - 3862.16] with your healing process you want to go
[3858.96 - 3862.16] as far as it needs to take
[3865.20 - 3869.58] but if you're a guest in my house
[3867.84 - 3871.08] and you
[3869.58 - 3874.08] are there
[3871.08 - 3874.08] yeah
[3874.38 - 3879.06] I want to make sure I'm a good Hoster
[3876.96 - 3880.62] all right so I got some potatoes in here
[3879.06 - 3882.42] for my cheese
[3880.62 - 3883.50] and I'm gonna put some carrots in here
[3882.42 - 3886.38] as well
[3883.50 - 3889.92] steamed carrots
[3886.38 - 3893.04] I'm going to add some water to this
[3889.92 - 3894.60] I'm going to do some
[3893.04 - 3898.10] um onion powder I'm going to do about
[3894.60 - 3898.10] two tablespoons of onion powder
[3900.36 - 3904.46] you want a decent amount of onion powder
[3902.16 - 3904.46] in here
[3905.64 - 3908.10] okay
[3906.42 - 3910.88] I'm gonna put a little bit of garlic
[3908.10 - 3910.88] powder in here too
[3913.08 - 3916.70] there we go a little bit of purple
[3921.24 - 3926.12] yeah and we're gonna put a little bit of
[3922.98 - 3926.12] dried oregano in here too
[3927.00 - 3931.76] it's gonna be really good
[3928.50 - 3931.76] a little bit of turmeric
[3933.84 - 3938.88] which will probably add to obviously the
[3936.24 - 3940.56] cheese color there's no soy in here just
[3938.88 - 3941.52] so you know there's no soy in here at
[3940.56 - 3943.20] all
[3941.52 - 3945.74] I'm gonna add some lemon juice fresh
[3943.20 - 3945.74] lemon juice
[3947.52 - 3950.60] a little strainer here
[3955.62 - 3961.44] what about I got a just a large amount
[3958.80 - 3964.50] of pasta I made and made basically two
[3961.44 - 3966.54] boxes of pasta
[3964.50 - 3969.56] so it's gonna take
[3966.54 - 3969.56] more than really
[3970.02 - 3973.64] a small amount of lemon but
[3974.34 - 3977.60] I put a little bit more in here
[3977.70 - 3982.98] a little strainer here
[3980.40 - 3984.60] add a little bit of water to
[3982.98 - 3987.32] two thirds of a cup
[3984.60 - 3987.32] should do it
[3989.22 - 3994.40] the lemon helps to give it this zesty
[3991.56 - 3994.40] good flavor
[3994.86 - 3998.18] you can add salt
[3998.82 - 4003.50] if you like
[4000.74 - 4005.54] I have some some family coming over and
[4003.50 - 4007.46] I think they're gonna have this dish
[4005.54 - 4010.18] so I might have to put a little bit of
[4007.46 - 4010.18] salt in here
[4017.00 - 4020.30] there's people that can't live without
[4018.44 - 4022.94] salt they can't live without the flavor
[4020.30 - 4025.52] the taste of salt like they won't eat
[4022.94 - 4027.14] their food they just won't if it's
[4025.52 - 4028.40] missing
[4027.14 - 4031.28] okay
[4028.40 - 4033.76] put the lemon juice in here
[4031.28 - 4033.76] okay
[4038.30 - 4043.16] let me try this you guys okay with this
[4041.42 - 4044.72] see what happens
[4043.16 - 4046.04] all right
[4044.72 - 4047.12] let's get a lid on it and put a little
[4046.04 - 4049.58] water
[4047.12 - 4051.08] in there as well
[4049.58 - 4054.38] start with that I'm going to add some
[4051.08 - 4057.80] more if I need to kind of like add
[4054.38 - 4060.74] and I'm gonna need a wire
[4057.80 - 4063.52] it's my favorite thing to do
[4060.74 - 4063.52] boom
[4075.46 - 4079.00] a little bit more
[4088.48 - 4092.02] and there we go
[4099.68 - 4105.02] you can do this in a blender
[4102.08 - 4107.36] but you usually in blenders you've got
[4105.02 - 4108.56] to add a little bit more water and I
[4107.36 - 4110.42] don't want
[4108.56 - 4112.90] a really
[4110.42 - 4112.90] like
[4117.68 - 4120.70] it's coming out really good
[4131.90 - 4137.98] had a little bit more water because he
[4134.12 - 4137.98] used a lot more potato than normal
[4143.24 - 4148.40] I'm hungry
[4145.64 - 4150.38] beautiful color Grizzy Grizz says
[4148.40 - 4152.42] beautiful color
[4150.38 - 4154.42] that's a compliment I'll take any
[4152.42 - 4157.64] compliments look at this
[4154.42 - 4161.36] really great thank you
[4157.64 - 4163.94] everybody else like this is this okay
[4161.36 - 4165.68] Karen says question
[4163.94 - 4167.62] who cleans your kitchen when you are
[4165.68 - 4171.02] done making a mess
[4167.62 - 4176.18] a whole team of people
[4171.02 - 4179.72] that because I am too Above cleaning
[4176.18 - 4181.94] I am so Above cleaning I'm just into I
[4179.72 - 4183.86] go get my massage after this
[4181.94 - 4188.42] I go take a run
[4183.86 - 4192.08] and I get my nails done but so I can't
[4188.42 - 4195.88] be bothered with cleaning I do the
[4192.08 - 4195.88] cleaning I do the cleaning
[4196.30 - 4205.18] I break my butt and clean up the mess
[4200.30 - 4205.18] I made the mess I will clean it
[4206.06 - 4211.16] so that's the cheese right there now
[4208.58 - 4215.08] this is the creamy cheese
[4211.16 - 4215.08] putting some on just like that
[4215.80 - 4221.60] amazing amazing so I'm just gonna get
[4219.32 - 4225.76] the cheese to get in here a little bit
[4221.60 - 4225.76] I'm gonna add some more I like it creamy
[4227.54 - 4230.26] there we go
[4239.72 - 4243.94] now I'm just mixing it in a little bit
[4241.70 - 4243.94] here
[4251.60 - 4257.56] laughs
[4253.76 - 4257.56] it's piping hot so it's actually
[4259.04 - 4263.90] and I might even with the rest of this I
[4261.50 - 4267.16] might even add a bunch more
[4263.90 - 4267.16] into this one
[4273.88 - 4280.76] the rest of it
[4276.22 - 4284.24] no Dairy no fat no butter no oil
[4280.76 - 4287.68] there's no oil in here this is non-dairy
[4284.24 - 4287.68] no soy
[4288.08 - 4292.10] no vegan cheese that's filled with
[4290.24 - 4294.36] natural flavors and everything else
[4292.10 - 4297.52] that's terrible none of that either
[4294.36 - 4297.52] [Music]
[4304.34 - 4308.06] this cheese is the good part I don't
[4306.26 - 4310.82] want to waste it I want every bit of it
[4308.06 - 4314.38] in here because this is really how this
[4310.82 - 4314.38] becomes so good
[4314.72 - 4317.44] amazing
[4319.18 - 4323.14] gotta give it some mix time
[4327.32 - 4331.94] now you gotta think this is a dairy-free
[4329.36 - 4334.90] mac and cheese
[4331.94 - 4334.90] is what it is
[4335.00 - 4340.70] now you can go one step past this if you
[4338.42 - 4344.42] would like
[4340.70 - 4346.58] you can put this in a baking dish
[4344.42 - 4349.10] set the oven for
[4346.58 - 4352.22] um 350.
[4349.10 - 4353.96] set the oven for 375 and you can put
[4352.22 - 4355.94] this in a baking dish and you can make
[4353.96 - 4358.22] baked mac and cheese you know how you do
[4355.94 - 4360.64] that work and then you actually put it
[4358.22 - 4360.64] right in
[4360.92 - 4363.16] foreign
[4380.38 - 4383.98] cheese right there
[4384.08 - 4387.68] I mean
[4385.52 - 4389.30] you can definitely do an oven where
[4387.68 - 4393.16] you've just toast the top if you really
[4389.30 - 4393.16] wanted to which is incredible
[4400.70 - 4403.66] but there it is
[4404.36 - 4407.42] incredible that's the stovetop macaroni
[4406.58 - 4409.58] and cheese you guys we talked about
[4407.42 - 4411.50] blood sugar
[4409.58 - 4413.12] talked about stabilizing blood sugar now
[4411.50 - 4414.50] one of the things that happens a big
[4413.12 - 4416.12] mistake that people make with blood
[4414.50 - 4418.52] sugar
[4416.12 - 4419.72] is they're in a vicious cycle and I
[4418.52 - 4421.64] wanted to cover this because this is the
[4419.72 - 4425.00] part I actually didn't cover yet so it's
[4421.64 - 4426.74] important they're in a vicious cycle of
[4425.00 - 4428.72] insulin resistance
[4426.74 - 4431.12] where they have to eat the thing that
[4428.72 - 4432.80] doesn't help them but it yet it feels
[4431.12 - 4436.28] like it helps them
[4432.80 - 4438.38] in order to stabilize their blood sugar
[4436.28 - 4439.64] so if someone gets the shakes or they
[4438.38 - 4441.74] get the low blood sugar or the
[4439.64 - 4443.48] hypoglycemia whatever it is that they're
[4441.74 - 4445.94] you know that they're dealing with or
[4443.48 - 4449.54] they're monitoring their blood sugar
[4445.94 - 4451.94] but they're told to eat things to
[4449.54 - 4453.44] stabilize their blood sugar when in turn
[4451.94 - 4456.32] it doesn't stabilize their blood sugar
[4453.44 - 4457.76] but yet it feels like it does
[4456.32 - 4459.26] so it's like whoa I have to eat
[4457.76 - 4460.58] something right now I'm having a blood
[4459.26 - 4462.44] sugar low I'm having a blood sugar
[4460.58 - 4464.48] problem and then they go and eat some
[4462.44 - 4465.56] hummus and I'm saying hummus is terrible
[4464.48 - 4468.08] or anything
[4465.56 - 4469.70] but because of all the tahini or the oil
[4468.08 - 4471.98] in the hummus
[4469.70 - 4473.60] they feel like whoa that just stabilized
[4471.98 - 4475.94] me and they just had a bunch of fat and
[4473.60 - 4478.82] that just stabilized me
[4475.94 - 4481.34] and but yet that's not the answer to
[4478.82 - 4483.08] fixing a blood sugar problem
[4481.34 - 4485.00] regardless
[4483.08 - 4486.38] I need some chips a lot of people do
[4485.00 - 4487.94] this thing like just need a few chips
[4486.38 - 4490.22] they open up a bag of chips it could be
[4487.94 - 4491.48] like a healthier bag of chips in the
[4490.22 - 4493.10] natural food store
[4491.48 - 4494.54] and they go and they open a healthy bag
[4493.10 - 4497.06] of chips and they eat like three or four
[4494.54 - 4498.68] chips and they get stabilized right and
[4497.06 - 4500.30] they think whoa I'm stabilizing my blood
[4498.68 - 4502.28] sugar or they eat a handful of nuts or
[4500.30 - 4504.14] half a bag of nuts and they're like I'm
[4502.28 - 4506.12] stabilizing my blood sugar
[4504.14 - 4507.86] or they have some bacon
[4506.12 - 4509.54] and they're like whoa I'm stabilizing my
[4507.86 - 4511.46] blood sugar but it's a catch-22 because
[4509.54 - 4513.38] here you're having blood sugar problems
[4511.46 - 4515.06] and then you're using things that put
[4513.38 - 4517.22] you into a vicious cycle where the
[4515.06 - 4518.54] problem will never be fixed and it'll
[4517.22 - 4520.58] just keep going and going and going
[4518.54 - 4523.40] because you don't fix the actual root
[4520.58 - 4527.06] problem Rose Jackson said the absolute
[4523.40 - 4529.94] disrespect and slander we receive from
[4527.06 - 4533.00] everyone when we speak about your info
[4529.94 - 4535.82] as though we are in the wrong because
[4533.00 - 4540.20] it's not science
[4535.82 - 4543.02] yeah I know I know you guys bear it you
[4540.20 - 4545.36] bear it well man and I'm honored to be
[4543.02 - 4548.60] in this with you truly
[4545.36 - 4550.46] takes a special soul to see through the
[4548.60 - 4553.16] smoke
[4550.46 - 4554.84] to understand what this is and what the
[4553.16 - 4556.28] information is in the medical medium
[4554.84 - 4558.14] book series
[4556.28 - 4560.30] to understand what's in in the podcast
[4558.14 - 4562.10] the medical Ian podcast
[4560.30 - 4564.20] it takes a special soul to understand
[4562.10 - 4568.96] that
[4564.20 - 4568.96] and to see it and see through everything
[4569.72 - 4574.52] and then you know to hear crap from
[4571.58 - 4576.64] people out there in a world that's sick
[4574.52 - 4579.38] right like they got all the answers
[4576.64 - 4581.96] stovetop mac and cheese right here
[4579.38 - 4585.26] that's the recipe

[4592.04 - 4597.26] blood sugar talk quick rundown right now
[4595.22 - 4599.00] that just keep in mind that any of the
[4597.26 - 4602.60] cleanses in the medical medium books is
[4599.00 - 4605.12] supportive of blood sugar problems
[4602.60 - 4607.52] critical to know anybody who's actually
[4605.12 - 4608.66] worried about their blood sugar numbers
[4607.52 - 4611.42] if you're dealing with blood sugar
[4608.66 - 4613.22] issues it's good to know why
