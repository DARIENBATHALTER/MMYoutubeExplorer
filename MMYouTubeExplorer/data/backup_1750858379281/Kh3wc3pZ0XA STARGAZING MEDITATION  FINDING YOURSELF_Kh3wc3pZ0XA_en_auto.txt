[568.08 - 574.08] so hey loon lunell's here uh
[571.68 - 574.88] whoa how did you make it i think it's
[574.08 - 576.80] aren't you like
[574.88 - 578.72] on the other side of the world and it's
[576.80 - 580.32] uh it's like nighttime now or something

[580.32 - 584.72] or something
[581.20 - 587.44] um anyway and look you guys
[584.72 - 588.40] the stargazing meditation you definitely
[587.44 - 591.04] want to try it
[588.40 - 592.56] if you can because it's powerful for
[591.04 - 594.52] healing the soul
[592.56 - 596.00] powerful to heal anxiety
[594.52 - 600.88] depersonalization
[596.00 - 603.36] depression even ocd it's really a power
[600.88 - 604.00] packed kind of thing that turns our
[603.36 - 606.88] lives around
[604.00 - 607.20] the reason why is because our souls they
[606.88 - 609.12] get
[607.20 - 610.40] injured down here you know when someone
[609.12 - 613.76] betrays you
[610.40 - 614.96] when someone you know you know uh messes
[613.76 - 616.72] with you okay
[614.96 - 618.32] when they mess with you you know
[616.72 - 620.24] emotional struggles i call them
[618.32 - 620.80] emotional bullets when emotional bullets
[620.24 - 622.72] are being
[620.80 - 624.24] you know shot at you in the whole bit
[622.72 - 625.44] when those emotional bullets are flying
[624.24 - 627.84] at you and stuff
[625.44 - 629.68] and so we get hurt along the way here
[627.84 - 631.36] and our soul gets kind of like a little
[629.68 - 632.24] beat up from it and you know that what
[631.36 - 634.96] i'm talking about
[632.24 - 636.80] broken relationships broken friendships
[634.96 - 638.48] over the years or something happens and
[636.80 - 640.00] the next thing you know it you're like
[638.48 - 641.52] i don't really feel like meeting
[640.00 - 642.64] somebody i don't feel like moving
