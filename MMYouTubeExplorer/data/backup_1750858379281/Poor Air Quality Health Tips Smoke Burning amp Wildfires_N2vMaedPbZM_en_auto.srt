1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,020
many of you are aware of the massive

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,580
fires that are happening right now out

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,500
there and so many people are breathing

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,240
in a lot of smoke I have family that's

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,519
calling me and they're saying what do I

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,780
do how do I deal with this so I got a

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,639
couple of tips one I'm going to show you

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,540
in a little bit with is water and a

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,539
cloth

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,220
the other is immune system and

11
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,340
antioxidant support and I'll tell you

12
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,960
why because what's in the air is a

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,720
massive trigger for a lot of people with

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,279
chronic illness that's my main concern

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,040
people who are struggling with different

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,780
health conditions autoimmune other types

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,200
of health conditions they can be

18
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,520
triggered easier than other people

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,559
overall everybody should be concerned

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,020
about breathing in too much smoke but

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,440
it's not just the smoke itself like if

22
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,840
you had a fire pit going or if you were

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,360
breathing in some wood that was burning

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,640
the smoke has chemicals in it because

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,579
they're using fire retardants to

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,800
actually Calm the Fire down or try to

27
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,559
Die the fire out so they're dumping a

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,080
lot of chemicals on the fire it becomes

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,119
dust those particles float around and

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,340
travel hundreds and hundreds thousands

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,380
of vials so I just want to cover a few

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,119
critical tips to start with right here

33
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,979
glutathione

34
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,600
that's one right there I endorse of

35
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,340
energy that's the products I use it's

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,759
the products I recommend my friends and

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,960
family glutathione right there

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,759
detoxification you gotta remember that

39
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,979
whenever you see glutathione it's

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,380
detoxification so it helps the body

41
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,360
naturally

42
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,200
detoxify and what happens is when you're

43
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,420
breathing in smoke filled with chemicals

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,579
and you're getting that inside your

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,920
lungs inside your body it has to go

46
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,200
somewhere it can't just sit inside the

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,600
body we want to get it out eventually so

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,700
that's glutathione right there it also

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,740
supports your immune system glutathione

50
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,320
as well so that's the best one I've ever

51
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,820
seen right there because of energy and

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,939
the four things they do with their

53
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,020
purity which is incredible anyway micro

54
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,119
C

55
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,060
so vitamin C that's another one right

56
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,340
there the energy micro C is an

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,500
incredible antioxidant too so these are

58
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,560
the ones I'm taking right now and I'm

59
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,599
telling family and friends so let's move

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,459
on to another one there's the propolis

61
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,280
which is immune system now if you're

62
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,459
wondering why immune system like why is

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,040
he talking about immune system because

64
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:26,879
chemicals and smoke in the air lowers

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,800
our immune system it's a trigger and

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,520
when it triggers us and triggers our

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,680
immune system then we're open to other

68
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,360
problems and so many people have healed

69
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,920
so many problems out there and so many

70
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,319
people have they're struggling with

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,060
their health and so when we're dealing

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,879
with triggers we're dealing with

73
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,040
possible Avalanches with our health so

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,180
these are things that are critical and

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,260
this is what I'm telling friends and

76
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,940
family

77
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,879
propolis is another one that's the

78
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,720
immune system right there zinc that's

79
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,879
the immune system as well B12 that's for

80
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,700
your cells overall and that's what your

81
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,680
cells the thing is what happens with B12

82
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,080
it supports a lot of different parts of

83
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,519
the body like every part of the body so

84
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,300
when you're dealing with smoke

85
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,800
inhalation toxins in the air it's also a

86
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,140
critical thing too so let's go into this

87
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,700
part here what you see is a bowl of

88
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,980
water

89
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,860
now if you're going from your house to

90
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,140
your car a lot of people are traveling a

91
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,879
lot of people are on the road they may

92
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,239
not be able to get some things they need

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,000
because the time of year so what you're

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,159
seeing right here is a quick easy tip

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,920
which I really love so what I'm doing

96
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,440
here so I just have a simple bowl of

97
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,140
water I have a cloth right here now this

98
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,840
is a dish cloth a dish towel I'm

99
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,599
squeezing out excess water but I'm

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,840
leaving the towel damp now if you have

101
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,060
to be outside for some reason in this

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,739
smoke you have to leave the house you

103
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,159
have to go from your house to your car

104
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,379
what you want to do is take a a damp

105
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,720
cloth like this that you just squeeze

106
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,519
the water out and you want to make like

107
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,940
a cup

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,760
and you take your hands like this see

109
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,799
and you give yourself enough space you

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,799
don't want it like this where your hands

111
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,720
are just really close like that you want

112
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,160
to give yourself enough space so there's

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,000
air

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,919
inside of here so you have a gap and

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,620
then you take that and you put this over

116
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,040
your mouth like this over your face like

117
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,699
this and you breathe and what you're

118
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,100
doing is it's not about whoa that's not

119
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,960
as good as a mask or is that is a mask

120
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,380
better is it not that's not what this is

121
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,759
about because you can't soak a mask so

122
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,500
that's one thing right there they just

123
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,460
it doesn't really work you have to take

124
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,620
a cloth like this get it wet you know do

125
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,940
this like I said before get it in there

126
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,340
nice and

127
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,960
you don't want it dry in one part and

128
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,139
that's a mistake that can happen where

129
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,199
you only have it moist in one area

130
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,000
dry in another you you don't want to do

131
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,100
it that way you want to have the entire

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,740
cloth wet

133
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,660
not sopping wet where it's dripping all

134
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,979
over you but you want it wet so I'm just

135
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,360
going to squeeze it out a little bit

136
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:19,139
more

137
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,020
there we go you're trapping some of the

138
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:26,280
smoke within it but the key is you're

139
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:30,240
trapping chemicals dust particles dust

140
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,220
that's being dropped onto the fire so

141
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,320
the helicopters and the planes are

142
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,740
dropping all that fire retardant onto

143
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,840
the flames and so that dust those

144
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,639
particles are what's in the air it makes

145
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,639
it more difficult for people to breathe

146
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,400
it gives people more complications it's

147
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,020
a bigger trigger so if you're outside if

148
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,660
you have to travel if you have to go to

149
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,960
your car this is a simple easy way to do

150
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,880
it now don't get too wrapped up with

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,460
what kind of cloth if you have a dish

152
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,500
towel a washcloth if you have anything

153
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,060
like that and you take it you put it

154
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,259
right up to your face and you make a

155
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,139
really nice

156
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,120
Wide Cup and you can breathe through

157
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,419
that towel right there and you're

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,000
breathing air and that air has all the

159
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,460
dust particles chemical particles and it

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,120
gets trapped easily within the moisture

161
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,800
of the cloth now that's really effective

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,199
I'm not saying that is like

163
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,060
the end-all to what you're doing like

164
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,380
that's going to fix it all you're still

165
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,759
going to get some smoke in there you're

166
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,280
still going to get some particles in

167
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,160
there it's not something you want to use

168
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,240
and go up to a fire with nothing like

169
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,800
that this is just a quick tip from

170
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,960
dealing with running from your house to

171
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,419
your car dealing with being out there

172
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,240
trapped in it maybe you're at a family

173
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:53,340
event and you're Outdoors anything like

174
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,319
that and you can just you know get a

175
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,039
dish towel or a washcloth and do that

176
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,280
it's helpful it helps to to minimize

177
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,900
that smoke and those chemicals and the

178
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,780
particles and the Dust

179
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,479
and then once again important critical

180
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,800
supplement like the glutathione which is

181
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,100
a big one so right now I'm telling

182
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,400
family and friends glutathione that's a

183
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,919
big one right there and the micro C the

184
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,720
antioxidants immune system immune system

185
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,360
the immune system all the cells in your

186
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,520
body so and if you can only get a few of

187
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,160
these if you only have an opportunity to

188
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,979
get three of them I would get the micro

189
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,800
C the glutathione I would probably get

190
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,800
those two and maybe the propolis but all

191
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,080
of them are important and it's the

192
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,979
quality of these you guys know I endorse

193
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,300
these guys for a reason because it's the

194
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,960
best stuff out there I've talked about

195
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,759
the four reasons why there's nothing in

196
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,199
these supplements that shouldn't be in

197
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,819
there and other supplements and

198
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,740
supplement companies they deal with

199
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,000
there's a there's always things in

200
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,860
people's supplements that they don't

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,620
know about because legally you're

202
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,539
allowed to have a certain percentage of

203
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,539
ingredients that you don't disclose to

204
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:09,000
the the actual consumer dimmers you

205
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,759
won't do that it's actually the purest I

206
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,160
can find out there but anyway you guys

207
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,960
