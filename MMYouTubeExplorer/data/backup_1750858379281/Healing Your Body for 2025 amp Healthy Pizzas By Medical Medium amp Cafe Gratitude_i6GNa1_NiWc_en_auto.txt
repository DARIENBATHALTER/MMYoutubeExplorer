[15.68 - 19.44] there's ways to do it one of the
[17.28 - 22.16] problems out there is that people don't
[19.44 - 24.32] know that there are options to heal that
[22.16 - 26.32] there are ways to heal there a lot of
[24.32 - 29.28] noise out there a lot of confusion and
[26.32 - 31.80] people they don't always take the right
[29.28 - 34.16] path because they don't know something
[31.80 - 36.04] else is better and something else is
[34.16 - 37.96] there for them so they can move forward
[36.04 - 40.28] and heal because that's what it's all
[37.96 - 42.08] about it's about getting better there's
[40.28 - 43.48] a lot of talk out there there's a lot of
[42.08 - 44.96] stupid talk out there there's a lot of

[55.04 - 59.04] doing what they've done in the last 10
[56.56 - 61.48] 20 30 years they end up learning like

[614.28 - 617.96] and then you're getting more blood drawn
[616.60 - 620.16] and then you're trying this and then
[617.96 - 621.52] you're on two medications and it's hit
[620.16 - 623.56] or miss and then you're getting some

[832.52 - 838.84] wave wave of sick people and this year
[836.76 - 840.32] it's going to be a tough one so you got
[838.84 - 841.88] to have the right information you got to
[840.32 - 844.20] know how to move forward there is a way
[841.88 - 846.48] to heal there's going to be a lot of flu
[844.20 - 851.16] bugs later on this year there's going to
[846.48 - 854.36] be a lot of weird bugs later on this
[851.16 - 856.36] year everybody's screaming about what's
[854.36 - 859.20] floating in the sky right
[856.36 - 861.84] now everybody's freaking out about one
[859.20 - 863.48] thing or another and I'm not saying
[861.84 - 865.24] what's floating in the sky is a great
[863.48 - 868.48] thing I'm not saying that at
[865.24 - 871.40] all I'm just saying everybody's getting
[868.48 - 874.24] sicker it's what's really happening
[871.40 - 876.36] you'll see you'll see and you'll see why
[874.24 - 878.92] do you think health is taking over why
[876.36 - 882.72] do you think every single model and
[878.92 - 884.32] celebrity and every single Sports person
[882.72 - 886.08] is trying to push something in the
[884.32 - 889.36] health world because they're struggling
[886.08 - 891.56] with symptoms too because everybody's
[889.36 - 894.88] getting symptoms and everybody's getting
[891.56 - 898.48] sicker and sicker but you don't have to
[894.88 - 902.96] get sicker and sicker you don't have to
[898.48 - 904.68] you can can heal and avoid all that and
[902.96 - 907.48] and really
[904.68 - 909.76] can swim through that
[907.48 - 912.96] current that everybody's up against
[909.76 - 914.76] right now of all the shock and awe and
[912.96 - 918.04] Magic Bullets being thrown at them left
[914.76 - 920.20] and right the crazy thing is is years
[918.04 - 923.40] ago when there was some Magic Bullets
[920.20 - 926.56] around then and nobody got better when
[923.40 - 928.12] shil hit the fan nobody got better
[926.56 - 931.40] everybody with chronic illness who had
[928.12 - 933.48] thyroid diseases Hashimoto everybody
[931.40 - 936.60] with fibro lime disease neurological
[933.48 - 938.56] lime they took XY never got them better
[936.60 - 940.80] fic minerals that was the next thing
[938.56 - 944.12] back 20 years ago never got anybody
[940.80 - 946.56] better it didn't and it was the next
[944.12 - 948.56] thing and the next thing and next thing
[946.56 - 951.92] and that's how it went but now we're in
[948.56 - 953.96] a Land of there are hundreds of things
[951.92 - 955.88] and hundreds of Magic Bullets and you
[953.96 - 958.32] could swim in that stuff and sit in that
[955.88 - 959.56] stuff for a really long time if you're
[958.32 - 963.00] struggling
[959.56 - 965.48] and you're sick with some neurological
[963.00 - 967.28] problems so what are you doing for your
[965.48 - 968.16] health like what are you doing because
[967.28 - 971.08] what
[968.16 - 974.36] I know is you have to have these
[971.08 - 978.16] landmarks these foundational Staples you
[974.36 - 979.72] have to have these solid
[978.16 - 983.00] foundations
[979.72 - 985.68] critical critical they have these solid
[983.00 - 988.52] foundations and you got to stay with
[985.68 - 990.76] these solid foundations and you got to
[988.52 - 994.72] hold with them
[990.76 - 996.68] because you need something there that
[994.72 - 998.16] works so if you want to try all the
[996.68 - 999.88]  out there or try the different
[998.16 - 1001.92] things and whatever flashy new thing
[999.88 - 1003.40] gets thrown at someone every single
[1001.92 - 1005.40] person is being thrown a flashy new
[1003.40 - 1006.80] thing sure you want to do that that's
[1005.40 - 1009.96] great but you better have some
[1006.80 - 1011.48] foundational tools you better have
[1009.96 - 1014.16] something
[1011.48 - 1017.96] there a
[1014.16 - 1020.08] landmark there that's holding you strong
[1017.96 - 1022.12] while you're trying trying to heal and
[1020.08 - 1024.92] being thrown off left and right not
[1022.12 - 1027.24] enough protein not enough
[1024.92 - 1029.16] protein deficiencies
[1027.24 - 1031.64] deficiencies you should be drinking out
[1029.16 - 1033.92] of copper pots and copper you us using
[1031.64 - 1036.32] copper utensils and wearing copper
[1033.92 - 1039.24] jewelry and drinking copper thermoses
[1036.32 - 1040.80] that's your answer it's not your answer
[1039.24 - 1043.08] that's actually dangerous but that's
[1040.80 - 1044.96] what I mean you should be freezing your
[1043.08 - 1046.88] ass off you should be taking ice baths
[1044.96 - 1049.72] you should be you should be putting
[1046.88 - 1054.16] yourself into ice shock
[1049.72 - 1057.56] no bad bad bad bad bad point
[1054.16 - 1060.64] is point is you better have some
[1057.56 - 1062.44] foundational tools so no matter what
[1060.64 - 1064.68] you're doing you got something that's
[1062.44 - 1066.48] helping you while you're getting pushed
[1064.68 - 1068.60] into other things or pear pressured into
[1066.48 - 1073.80] other things or tricked into other
[1068.60 - 1076.76] things you need to have the core
[1073.80 - 1080.12] foundational strength in your
[1076.76 - 1082.40] healing so that you can hold strong and
[1080.12 - 1084.08] then move forward especially with the
[1082.40 - 1087.36] bugs to
[1084.08 - 1090.28] come I mean four years
[1087.36 - 1092.80] ago right it four years ago
[1090.28 - 1097.40] now or is it more than four years ago
[1092.80 - 1098.68] now right when the bug hit the town
[1097.40 - 1102.40] there's going to be
[1098.68 - 1105.16] more they're coming they're on the
[1102.40 - 1107.76] way and you got to have that core
[1105.16 - 1110.96] Foundation it's got to be
[1107.76 - 1113.68] there so I came on here to say look this
[1110.96 - 1115.24] is the start of the Year just wanted to
[1113.68 - 1118.64] say hi to everybody also let you know
[1115.24 - 1120.20] about the Killer Pizza party because
[1118.64 - 1123.08] that alone is really
[1120.20 - 1125.12] exciting but I want to talk about some
[1123.08 - 1127.00] tools and I want to talk about the
[1125.12 - 1128.76] foundational tools and I've said that
[1127.00 - 1130.04] years ago too you needed the
[1128.76 - 1133.72] foundational
[1130.04 - 1138.04] tools very important for healing okay
[1133.72 - 1140.40] for one simple some foods to avoid
[1138.04 - 1144.60] simple I know you don't want to hear
[1140.40 - 1145.56] this I know I get slammed every time
[1144.60 - 1149.16] every
[1145.56 - 1151.40] time and I'm ready to take a hit again
[1149.16 - 1151.40] I'm
[1151.84 - 1159.12] ready I'm primed I'm ready this
[1156.00 - 1161.40] year and I'm not messing
[1159.12 - 1164.68] around but I want to tell you one of the
[1161.40 - 1166.84] foods to avoid is the eggs I know when
[1164.68 - 1169.76] people hear it they start freaking out
[1166.84 - 1171.72] and then boom everybody body's on board
[1169.76 - 1173.24] you know eggs are good for you you need
[1171.72 - 1175.16] the protein they're filled with vitamins
[1173.24 - 1177.00] and minerals they're filled with choline
[1175.16 - 1179.04] they got everything you ever need it
[1177.00 - 1181.04] it's eggs it's eggs it's eggs but I
[1179.04 - 1184.20] promise you this whether anybody likes
[1181.04 - 1187.40] it or not no matter how much crap I
[1184.20 - 1189.36] get if you got chronic illness if you're
[1187.40 - 1191.88] somebody that has a
[1189.36 - 1195.16] symptom I promise you this those eggs
[1191.88 - 1197.88] aren't going to help they're going to be
[1195.16 - 1200.44] a monkey on your back and they're going
[1197.88 - 1203.32] to hold you you down on your healing
[1200.44 - 1204.72] process even if you keep them in there
[1203.32 - 1206.12] and you're bettering you're getting a
[1204.72 - 1207.52] little better with your illness because
[1206.12 - 1209.00] you're doing a bunch of stuff and you
[1207.52 - 1212.40] keep them in
[1209.00 - 1214.28] there it's going to
[1212.40 - 1218.32] eventually you're going to be back to
[1214.28 - 1219.24] full circle or 180° however you want to
[1218.32 - 1223.36] say
[1219.24 - 1225.64] it because eggs will feed what's coming
[1223.36 - 1227.92] and what's in people people still don't
[1225.64 - 1230.28] realize it all the different pathogens
[1227.92 - 1232.88] that were actually raised in labs and
[1230.28 - 1235.48] manufactured
[1232.88 - 1237.92] by classified medical research
[1235.48 - 1240.48] science many many years ago they used
[1237.92 - 1243.32] eggs to do it all the suffering people
[1240.48 - 1245.24] have right now is from the herpes
[1243.32 - 1247.28] viruses it's from the herpes simplex one
[1245.24 - 1249.60] herpes simplex 2 it's what creates
[1247.28 - 1252.16] cancer it's all the
[1249.60 - 1254.00] viruses it's the epscene bars that end
[1252.16 - 1256.80] up creating cancer it's all the
[1254.00 - 1259.24] different bugs that end up creating
[1256.80 - 1261.04] cancer and what happens is is that all
[1259.24 - 1262.24] these bugs feed on something that people
[1261.04 - 1264.12] don't realize it was what they were
[1262.24 - 1266.00] raised on and it was eggs so that's just
[1264.12 - 1268.76] one foundational tool right there you
[1266.00 - 1270.72] throw everything else away and you just
[1268.76 - 1272.56] say you know what I'm holding off on the
[1270.72 - 1274.92] eggs you're doing yourself a
[1272.56 - 1277.48] foundational
[1274.92 - 1279.68] favor that alone right
[1277.48 - 1282.36] there sure you want to go grab the Magic
[1279.68 - 1286.36] Bullets left and right and everything
[1282.36 - 1290.12] else but that's the big one right there
[1286.36 - 1295.32] okay that's the big one
[1290.12 - 1297.84] viruses feed on toxins equals cancer
[1295.32 - 1300.60] viruses Staying Alive because they feed
[1297.84 - 1304.24] on eggs so they can feed on toxins and
[1300.60 - 1307.04] create cancer there you
[1304.24 - 1309.32] go important to understand how it
[1307.04 - 1310.52] works and right now we're heading into a
[1309.32 - 1311.92] place where a lot of people are getting
[1310.52 - 1312.96] sicker and sicker it's going to happen
[1311.92 - 1314.36] faster and faster and you're going to
[1312.96 - 1315.80] read more things about it and see more
[1314.36 - 1317.96] things about it and there's going to be
[1315.80 - 1319.88] a thousand more Magic Bullet companies
[1317.96 - 1321.64] and Magic things and Magic Bullet this
[1319.88 - 1323.80] and this to try and they're just going
[1321.64 - 1325.92] to come out and be like Oh try this oh
[1323.80 - 1328.40] no try that oh no you need to be doing
[1325.92 - 1329.80] keto oh you need to be carnivore now oh
[1328.40 - 1331.60] you need to do this you need to eat lots
[1329.80 - 1333.44] of eggs oh you need your fish again or
[1331.60 - 1336.08] your fish oil and it's going to go back
[1333.44 - 1338.24] to this again and then the same old crap
[1336.08 - 1340.88] happens right where you got the wars
[1338.24 - 1344.00] between the plant-base and the carnivore
[1340.88 - 1345.56] or keto and animal right you see this
[1344.00 - 1347.36] now and I talked about it before did you
[1345.56 - 1349.00] see how bad it's getting plant-based
[1347.36 - 1351.24] movement
[1349.00 - 1352.88] I'm on look I'm I totally support
[1351.24 - 1354.20] plant-based I told this told you before
[1352.88 - 1356.68] I also supported somebody's doing an
[1354.20 - 1358.80] animal protein thing because there's
[1356.68 - 1360.80] tools you can do medical meme tools fit
[1358.80 - 1364.48] in both both places so you can do your
[1360.80 - 1365.92] healing right but man the vegans whether
[1364.48 - 1367.12] vegans know it or not they're asleep
[1365.92 - 1369.04] right now on the plant-based people
[1367.12 - 1372.08] they're asleep right now they're just
[1369.04 - 1373.72] getting destroyed out there the
[1372.08 - 1376.16] movements being destroyed it's the
[1373.72 - 1380.44] saddest thing I've ever
[1376.16 - 1382.48] seen okay and eggs are part of how
[1380.44 - 1384.76] they're destroying it that's what's
[1382.48 - 1386.48] crazy cuz no one wants to give up their
[1384.76 - 1387.84] eggs on any level to come for food their
[1386.48 - 1390.00] eggs they don't want to give up their
[1387.84 - 1391.00] eggs no way that's one foundational tool
[1390.00 - 1393.36] stay away from those if you're
[1391.00 - 1394.84] chronically sick cuz I promise you they
[1393.36 - 1396.64] are going to get in your way I don't
[1394.84 - 1399.48] even have an egg prop with me right now
[1396.64 - 1402.48] but whatever all right another
[1399.48 - 1405.72] foundational tool okay that I've talked
[1402.48 - 1407.00] about forever stay away from canola oil
[1405.72 - 1409.20] and now some people out there like

[1702.36 - 1707.56] it a little bit like caffeine's
[1704.64 - 1709.32] bad and they're drinking alcohol too I
[1707.56 - 1710.88] notice you'll see see some alcohol's bad
[1709.32 - 1712.72] for you alcohol's bad for your brain
[1710.88 - 1714.16] really because I put it in the books
[1712.72 - 1715.68] that alcohol's bad for the brain but
[1714.16 - 1717.04] anyway alcohol is bad for the brain now
[1715.68 - 1718.56] so you see some people meanwhile they
[1717.04 - 1720.84] were just drinking wine a couple of
[1718.56 - 1722.88] years ago they had they had their
[1720.84 - 1725.12] Revelation their Epiphany that like now
[1722.88 - 1726.96] don't don't drink alcohol anymore and
[1725.12 - 1729.12] shock and awe that person said don't
[1726.96 - 1732.12] drink alcohol
[1729.12 - 1733.76] whoa those are Basics those are easy
[1732.12 - 1735.60] ones right there you know you shouldn't
[1733.76 - 1736.80] be doing caffeine you know if you're
[1735.60 - 1738.20] sick with chronic illness you shouldn't
[1736.80 - 1739.64] be doing caffeine you shouldn't even be
[1738.20 - 1741.36] doing chocolate you shouldn't be do
[1739.64 - 1746.32] shouldn't be doing
[1741.36 - 1746.32] um uh coffee green tea
[1746.80 - 1751.16] matcha but people do it anyway should be
[1749.64 - 1753.00] careful with chocolate if you're sick
[1751.16 - 1755.76] with chronic illness but it's really
[1753.00 - 1757.12] hard to break away from that and I
[1755.76 - 1760.04] completely understand it see I'm not
[1757.12 - 1763.68] judging anybody it's not about judging
[1760.04 - 1767.56] anyone cuz I get it life is hard it's
[1763.68 - 1771.76] easy to go to chocolate and caffeine and
[1767.56 - 1774.00] coffee and cheese and eggs life is hard
[1771.76 - 1777.80] totally get it foundational pieces
[1774.00 - 1780.60] though you can take
[1777.80 - 1781.68] them smack them out of my hands fine
[1780.60 - 1784.76] either
[1781.68 - 1787.28] way that's what you can
[1784.76 - 1789.88] do I just found a golden ticket here you
[1787.28 - 1792.28] can take the golden ticket smack it out
[1789.88 - 1794.84] in my hand medical medium morning cleans
[1792.28 - 1798.84] talk about that a little bit treat your
[1794.84 - 1799.92] liver good treat your liver good
[1798.84 - 1801.60] let's talk about the morning cleanse
[1799.92 - 1804.44] just for a couple of seconds here
[1801.60 - 1806.68] morning cleanse lemon water boom move on
[1804.44 - 1808.96] to some celery juice boom you can have
[1806.68 - 1812.76] some fruit plain old fruit which is now
[1808.96 - 1815.96] allowed it's now allowed in the keto
[1812.76 - 1817.72] diet and morning cleanse is in the book
[1815.96 - 1820.64] cleanse to heal you can have some fruit
[1817.72 - 1822.80] now which is allowed in the KE keto
[1820.64 - 1824.64] diet remember when you know you weren't
[1822.80 - 1828.24] even allowed a green
[1824.64 - 1830.64] apple anyway the point is keeping off of
[1828.24 - 1835.20] fats in the morning no bacon no eggs no
[1830.64 - 1837.72] butter no milk no avocado no cheese no
[1835.20 - 1843.44] oils no olive
[1837.72 - 1846.36] oil keeping the over fats away and do a
[1843.44 - 1849.72] morning cleanse which leads me to
[1846.36 - 1853.40] this you can be somebody that rips apart
[1849.72 - 1855.72] being off of the overt fats but just so
[1853.40 - 1858.28] you know you're never going to really
[1855.72 - 1860.12] truly cleanse as deep as you need to if
[1858.28 - 1864.16] you're doing overt
[1860.12 - 1866.44] fats so at least catch a morning cleanse
[1864.16 - 1867.84] so you can do a little bit of cleansing
[1866.44 - 1869.84] because that's what it does it gives you
[1867.84 - 1871.48] a daily cleanse when you do the morning
[1869.84 - 1873.44] cleansing you do your your lemon water
[1871.48 - 1876.36] you do your celery juice you do your
[1873.44 - 1878.44] hmbs how about that and then you do if
[1876.36 - 1880.08] you want to do some fruit sure if you're
[1878.44 - 1882.60] starving and you're really hungry do
[1880.08 - 1885.00] some potato steamed potato no oil no
[1882.60 - 1888.44] cheese no nothing on it and then
[1885.00 - 1890.16] afternoon you can bring in your avocado
[1888.44 - 1891.32] whatever you want your nuts your seeds
[1890.16 - 1893.00] if that's somebody that you know if
[1891.32 - 1894.16] you're somebody that eats that your fish
[1893.00 - 1896.04] or whatever it is if you're somebody
[1894.16 - 1898.84] like that or your animal protein person

[1898.84 - 1904.16] morning that's the morning cleanse it's

[1983.00 - 1988.48] depersonalization it's put people on the
[1985.00 - 1991.48] map back into life and then someone gets
[1988.48 - 1992.92] jealous that's in the healing World
[1991.48 - 1996.92] somebody
[1992.92 - 2000.12] who was sued for stealing somebody's
[1996.92 - 2002.08] money somebody who doesn't even have a
[2000.12 - 2004.48] doctor's license anymore and then
[2002.08 - 2006.72] they're running ads 24/7 runs running
[2004.48 - 2010.72] ads 24/7 they're using the their family
[2006.72 - 2012.64] to do it all kinds of like fake
[2010.72 - 2014.92] testimonials and they start ripping
[2012.64 - 2017.00] apart things like cilantro they start
[2014.92 - 2019.36] ripping apart things like spirulina
[2017.00 - 2022.48] maybe you've seen some of
[2019.36 - 2025.24] this meanwhile what were they really
[2022.48 - 2027.16] doing just a few years ago
[2025.24 - 2028.48] nothing and what were they really doing
[2027.16 - 2030.20] a few years ago they had anything to do
[2028.48 - 2033.04] with he heavy metals
[2030.20 - 2036.04] nothing the system set up right now it's
[2033.04 - 2038.04] rigged for failure for people so they
[2036.04 - 2039.12] won't heal and the one thing I want the
[2038.04 - 2042.08] reason why I'm saying this and bringing
[2039.12 - 2045.60] this in because the traps out there are
[2042.08 - 2048.60] set you you can like me you can hate me
[2045.60 - 2050.36] I don't care I mean I hope you like me
[2048.60 - 2051.76] but what am I going to do you got your
[2050.36 - 2054.52] own free will you don't like me what am
[2051.76 - 2056.80] I going to do but one thing's for
[2054.52 - 2058.92] certain whether you like the way I look
[2056.80 - 2061.92] don't like the way I look you like you
[2058.92 - 2063.28] know what I mean one thing's for certain
[2061.92 - 2065.44] this
[2063.28 - 2068.44] works and has gotten people out of
[2065.44 - 2069.84] wheelchairs not just one person
[2068.44 - 2071.96] hundreds and
[2069.84 - 2074.32] hundreds something that can never be
[2071.96 - 2076.52] done out there and this industry doesn't
[2074.32 - 2078.72] like that that's why I'm always attacked
[2076.52 - 2081.60] that's why I'm always right that's why
[2078.72 - 2083.20] I'm always censored attack Shadow band
[2081.60 - 2085.64] you name it everything that's ever
[2083.20 - 2088.36] happened and then people trying to talk
[2085.64 - 2091.52]  but one thing's for certain you do
[2088.36 - 2092.92] the right tools you heal I mean take the
[2091.52 - 2094.16] books to your doctor ask them what's
[2092.92 - 2097.80] right for
[2094.16 - 2099.68] you but I know what's in here moves
[2097.80 - 2103.68] people forward and moves the needle and
[2099.68 - 2106.20] gets them better if they do it right
[2103.68 - 2108.04] meaning they just don't do it one day or
[2106.20 - 2110.72] they don't do it just do it one week and
[2108.04 - 2112.12] they do it half ass one week and then
[2110.72 - 2113.72] they're eating all this chocolate not
[2112.12 - 2115.00] telling anybody and they're eating all
[2113.72 - 2116.84] this other stuff and they're getting
[2115.00 - 2118.24] blood taken out for no reason left and
[2116.84 - 2121.48] right and they're doing you know and
[2118.24 - 2121.48] they're getting all kinds of
[2124.08 - 2128.20] stuff and all this stuff's happening
[2126.96 - 2130.08] then it's going to take takes some time
[2128.20 - 2132.64] you got to get on it you got to work it
[2130.08 - 2136.48] you got to put this into motion and you
[2132.64 - 2136.48] got to heal and you can heal for
[2136.60 - 2143.00] 2025 if I was a fly on the wall the fly
[2139.84 - 2143.00] is going to come back by the
[2145.08 - 2151.08] way if I was a fly on the
[2147.88 - 2154.52] wall and I can see what people are
[2151.08 - 2156.44] doing they're doing
[2154.52 - 2160.56] unbelievable if I could look at their
[2156.44 - 2162.88] credit card receipts their credit card
[2160.56 - 2165.72] statements if I could look at their
[2162.88 - 2168.84] restaurants they're eating in what
[2165.72 - 2171.32] they're buying at the grocery store what
[2168.84 - 2175.28] they're eating while they're drinking a
[2171.32 - 2178.56] celery juice 3 years ago for a month or
[2175.28 - 2181.48] something if I can see what people are
[2178.56 - 2184.04] doing and I can to some
[2181.48 - 2187.96] degree fin wall
[2184.04 - 2189.48] can so can
[2187.96 - 2191.28] unfortunately a lot of people don't tell
[2189.48 - 2192.76] the truth and they won't say what
[2191.28 - 2194.08] they're really doing what they're really
[2192.76 - 2196.00] eating and that's another thing that
[2194.08 - 2198.60] happens because that's how social works
[2196.00 - 2202.20] that's how people work
[2198.60 - 2204.56] but the heavy metal detox has turned
[2202.20 - 2204.56] lives
[2205.72 - 2212.00] around and it works it works and if
[2210.16 - 2215.28] someone's pushed away from it because of
[2212.00 - 2217.04] a campaign trying to lead people to
[2215.28 - 2219.96] whatever they're selling or whatever
[2217.04 - 2222.76] crapping hes they're selling whatever it
[2219.96 - 2224.84] is and they miss out on a chance to heal
[2222.76 - 2226.04] cuz now they're afraid of cilantro and
[2224.84 - 2228.56] now they're afraid of something like
[2226.04 - 2230.24] spirina or they're afraid of something
[2228.56 - 2232.88] and they don't know what they could they
[2230.24 - 2235.72] don't know how to heal you just send
[2232.88 - 2238.16] them down to track and they're going to
[2235.72 - 2239.64] be stuck for another five years after
[2238.16 - 2242.60] they paid thousands and thousands of
[2239.64 - 2244.88] dollars for programs chrisa Ritz it
[2242.60 - 2247.72] helped me so much that hmds cleanse and

[2278.88 - 2285.36] these things matter they do and then you
[2282.08 - 2288.28] got the brain shot Therapies in the
[2285.36 - 2289.96] brainsaver books I mean I know many of
[2288.28 - 2292.16] you guys live by them I know many of you
[2289.96 - 2293.12] guys have tried them but they're mental
[2292.16 - 2296.24] health
[2293.12 - 2298.60] tools they are mental health
[2296.24 - 2302.20] tools healing is
[2298.60 - 2304.48] possible there's a way to do it it's in
[2302.20 - 2304.48] our
[2304.84 - 2310.56] hands the brain shot therapies help
[2307.08 - 2311.84] physically and mentally both physically
[2310.56 - 2314.12] and
[2311.84 - 2316.80] mentally truly
[2314.12 - 2318.28] powerful so it's go to a couple couple
[2316.80 - 2321.44] other things here
[2318.28 - 2321.44] so all
[2323.96 - 2327.60] right why do you have to have these
[2325.88 - 2329.88] foundational tools because some people
[2327.60 - 2331.08] are under a lot of stress their adrenals

[2357.88 - 2363.92] to have those coupled with being
[2361.16 - 2366.00] cautious on some of the foods that will
[2363.92 - 2367.40] feed a problem the one thing you're
[2366.00 - 2369.48] going to get with the medical medium

[2491.68 - 2497.52] health episodes as well psychosis and
[2494.28 - 2499.40] similar breakdowns maybe months later
[2497.52 - 2502.12] would that be more immediate it could be
[2499.40 - 2504.08] some immediate and months later and
[2502.12 - 2505.96] years
[2504.08 - 2507.12] later and that's why we have to take
[2505.96 - 2510.04] care of ourselves have those
[2507.12 - 2513.48] foundational tools and do the healing we
[2510.04 - 2513.48] need to do and move
[2513.96 - 2517.28] forward so I know a lot of people are
[2516.00 - 2518.60] freaking out and you'll see that on
[2517.28 - 2521.24] social everybody's just freaking out
[2518.60 - 2525.36] about like you'll see it out
[2521.24 - 2525.36] there food chemicals food
[2526.60 - 2532.04] chemicals food chemicals are bad I've
[2529.92 - 2533.16] talked about them in all the books
[2532.04 - 2536.40] processed
[2533.16 - 2540.36] foods it's not why everybody is getting
[2536.40 - 2543.00] dangerously sick and sick and sicker
[2540.36 - 2545.20] it's not unfortunately that's not the
[2543.00 - 2547.48] reason I know they're looking for stuff
[2545.20 - 2550.20] like that but what you'll see the
[2547.48 - 2553.68] industries do is you'll see them
[2550.20 - 2556.32] still hide from the pathogens and the
[2553.68 - 2557.52] metals see little bit of the metal stuff
[2556.32 - 2559.32] creep up because they're learning the
[2557.52 - 2561.92] medical medium information right all the
[2559.32 - 2564.28] metal information I put all these years
[2561.92 - 2567.88] but you'll see them skirt around the
[2564.28 - 2570.92] pathogens once again and they'll try to
[2567.88 - 2572.72] just look for these other you know
[2570.92 - 2576.00] things and they'll try to do shock and
[2572.72 - 2579.12] awe this food chemical this die number
[2576.00 - 2581.40] three this die here this thing
[2579.12 - 2583.56] here you're going to see a lot of that
[2581.40 - 2585.92] why everybody's looking for reasons why
[2583.56 - 2587.40] people are sick and at the same time
[2585.92 - 2589.96] whether it's accidental it's accidental
[2587.40 - 2592.68] or purposely could be accidental they're
[2589.96 - 2595.60] not seeing the real reasons why people
[2592.68 - 2595.60] are sick and
[2595.96 - 2601.28] suffering so one problem with the flu
[2599.08 - 2605.84] and the Sea that's coming again over and
[2601.28 - 2609.64] over again the RSV and the neuro
[2605.84 - 2609.64] virus and the
[2610.00 - 2619.32] SS and all the other different ones like
[2614.76 - 2622.08] the bird bugs the problem with all these
[2619.32 - 2624.20] is if you don't have your foundations
[2622.08 - 2625.80] intact and you're not cleaning out some
[2624.20 - 2628.00] of the garbage getting some of the
[2625.80 - 2630.16] metals out knocking back some of the
[2628.00 - 2633.56] pathogens it becomes too much of an
[2630.16 - 2635.76] overload too much of an overload
[2633.56 - 2638.00] 2025 going to be a year where we're
[2635.76 - 2641.04] going to get a wave a bunch waves of a
[2638.00 - 2644.04] lot of bugs going to be coming
[2641.04 - 2646.56] through and people aren't taking care of
[2644.04 - 2649.16] themselves properly and knocking down
[2646.56 - 2651.56] the bugs that they have in them living
[2649.16 - 2652.48] in them all the time and that's the
[2651.56 - 2657.20] perfect
[2652.48 - 2659.80] storm for all that stuff Uma a w where
[2657.20 - 2661.92] have you been okay okay okay
[2659.80 - 2664.44] okay get
[2661.92 - 2666.80] ready I'm only going to squeak out an
[2664.44 - 2669.64] inkling of this information right here
[2666.80 - 2673.88] and inkling of this
[2669.64 - 2673.88] information okay if you're
[2674.44 - 2678.68] interested you know how you guys have
[2676.60 - 2680.84] been asking for Spiritual information
