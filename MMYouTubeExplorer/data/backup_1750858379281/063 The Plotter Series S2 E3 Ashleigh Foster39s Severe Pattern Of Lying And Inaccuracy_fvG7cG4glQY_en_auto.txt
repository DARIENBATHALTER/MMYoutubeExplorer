[0.80 - 5.28] The Following episode is part of a
[2.80 - 7.68] series dedicated to exposing an
[5.28 - 9.56] organized hateful group that has been on
[7.68 - 11.76] a Relentless pursuit to destroy the
[9.56 - 14.76] medical medium community and that has
[11.76 - 17.48] been attacking bullying harassing and

[20.36 - 25.96] bakaro she's an alternative medicine
[22.96 - 28.04] practitioner who became a whistleblower
[25.96 - 30.64] after she witnessed this hateful group
[28.04 - 34.08] in action when they tried to recruit her
[30.64 - 37.32] to join them last year Amber caught the
[34.08 - 39.44] main members of this group on legally
[37.32 - 42.88] recorded calls describing their
[39.44 - 46.68] premeditated multi-step plan to create a
[42.88 - 50.56] quote postm medal medium era by feeding
[46.68 - 52.60] false stories and claims about me and
[50.56 - 55.56] about medical medium information to
[52.60 - 58.52] Major media outlets in hopes that it
[55.56 - 61.36] would lead to securing themselves a deal
[58.52 - 64.52] for an anti-ed medium documentary on
[61.36 - 68.48] Netflix that would bring Fame and other
[64.52 - 70.64] benefits to them now known infamously
[68.48 - 73.84] instead for their malicious plot that
[70.64 - 77.04] was caught on recording and exposed we
[73.84 - 80.12] refer to this hateful group as the
[77.04 - 83.00] plotters their entire smear campaign is
[80.12 - 86.28] spearheaded by one woman who comes from
[83.00 - 88.96] an extremely wealthy family didn't get

[88.96 - 94.80] now seeking re Revenge she's made it her
[91.88 - 97.80] mission to gather a bunch of plotters
[94.80 - 99.52] with ulterior motives and AES to grind
[97.80 - 103.20] including competitors in the health
[99.52 - 106.12] industry to try to frame medical medium
[103.20 - 109.04] and take down the community what this
[106.12 - 111.00] organized hateful group has done is
[109.04 - 112.88] unprecedented it's one of the biggest
[111.00 - 115.92] scandals that's ever happened in the
[112.88 - 118.36] health industry as you'll see it's also
[115.92 - 120.36] one of the biggest instances of
[118.36 - 123.64] capturing corruption within the
[120.36 - 126.60] mainstream media so prepare yourself for
[123.64 - 129.40] lots of details and nuances as we are
[126.60 - 132.52] going to be thoroughly untangling the
[129.40 - 135.08] massive Web of Lies they have spun and
[132.52 - 137.80] we're going to be releasing a lot of
[135.08 - 140.80] disturbing new information new
[137.80 - 144.12] recordings and mind-blowing evidence of
[140.80 - 146.84] just how far they are going to lie to
[144.12 - 148.76] try to get what they want some of the
[146.84 - 151.52] evidence we're presenting in these
[148.76 - 154.68] episodes in includes original written
[151.52 - 157.48] content such as text messages social
[154.68 - 160.64] media posts that have been produced by
[157.48 - 163.96] the plots and will be reenacted for
[160.64 - 166.24] greater ease in following along those
[163.96 - 168.72] who are listening along to the podcast

[177.20 - 183.96] more some of you may be unaware that
[180.44 - 186.92] this has even been happening but many of
[183.96 - 190.28] you have been tremendously injured and
[186.92 - 192.80] harmed by what they have done the record
[190.28 - 195.80] needs to be set straight and they need
[192.80 - 198.28] to be called out for what they've done
[195.80 - 200.40] and are still doing the medical medium
[198.28 - 202.92] Community does not deserve to be
[200.40 - 205.64] attacked like this and we are going to
[202.92 - 208.90] set the record straight as many times as
[205.64 - 213.00] we need to
[208.90 - 216.20] [Music]
[213.00 - 219.52] all along Ashley Foster has had ulterior
[216.20 - 223.64] motives all along Ashley Foster has been
[219.52 - 226.12] wrong all along Ashley Foster has been
[223.64 - 227.64] lying Ashley's original story about
[226.12 - 229.72] Stephanie included the claim that
[227.64 - 232.60] Anthony never told Stephanie to see a
[229.72 - 234.84] doctor we've proven that wrong with
[232.60 - 236.84] evidence even before we released the
[234.84 - 238.72] evidence Ashley was publicly corrected
[236.84 - 240.92] on this claim Years Ago by the husband
[238.72 - 243.36] of one of Stephanie's friends friends
[240.92 - 245.12] this husband was actually around for
[243.36 - 248.24] what happened with Stephanie while
[245.12 - 250.56] Ashley was not after being publicly
[248.24 - 252.48] corrected Ashley pivoted and moved
[250.56 - 256.48] forward with a new manufactured story
[252.48 - 258.32] line the new Stephanie story became well
[256.48 - 260.80] okay he told her to go to the doctor I
[258.32 - 264.12] guess but it wasn't until the end after
[260.80 - 266.60] it was too late we've proven that wrong
[264.12 - 268.12] with evidence Ashley claimed that
[266.60 - 269.88] Stephanie discovered her breast lump
[268.12 - 270.60] while she was staying nights with Ashley
[269.88 - 273.00] in
[270.60 - 275.08] 2016 we've proven that wrong with
[273.00 - 278.60] evidence Stephanie did not develop the
[275.08 - 281.72] breast lump until a whole year later in
[278.60 - 284.16] 2017 Ashley then claimed that Anthony in
[281.72 - 286.80] 2016 had told Stephanie that her breast
[284.16 - 289.68] lump would never become cancerous we've
[286.80 - 291.80] proven that very wrong with evidence
[289.68 - 294.84] that is not possible because the breast
[291.80 - 298.04] lump that was discovered in 2017 did not
[294.84 - 299.92] exist in 2016 Ashley's story was
[298.04 - 301.64] artificial
[299.92 - 303.04] Ashley also claimed that Anthony told
[301.64 - 305.36] Stephanie that she had hurt her back in
[303.04 - 307.56] yoga but that Stephanie told Ashley that
[305.36 - 310.56] she didn't remember hurting it in yoga
[307.56 - 312.40] we've proven that wrong with evidence
[310.56 - 315.64] Ashley said that Anthony's message to
[312.40 - 318.44] Stephanie was to just lie still on the
[315.64 - 320.68] floor we've proven that wrong with
[318.44 - 322.88] evidence Ashley claimed that Stephanie
[320.68 - 326.00] had done everything Anthony ever told
[322.88 - 329.24] her to do we've proven that wrong with
[326.00 - 332.08] evidence that's seven major falsities
[329.24 - 333.92] that Ash was proven wrong on last year
[332.08 - 336.36] seven major falsities that were designed
[333.92 - 338.08] to tarnish Anthony's reputation and to
[336.36 - 340.88] scare people away from applying medical
[338.08 - 343.64] medium information to heal seven major
[340.88 - 346.40] falsities that harmed many people's real
[343.64 - 348.72] lives seven major falsities that Ashley
[346.40 - 350.68] needs to be held accountable for among
[348.72 - 353.40] all of the other falsities and lies that
[350.68 - 355.92] have been produced by her since this is
[353.40 - 358.20] the false story that Ashley took the
[355.92 - 360.36] Vanity Fair when the journalist Dan
[358.20 - 363.68] Adler reached out to me regarding the
[360.36 - 366.40] hit piece she had him working on I was
[363.68 - 368.84] sent a list of hundreds of questions the
[366.40 - 371.16] questions that were asked line up and
[368.84 - 373.92] coordinate exactly with Ashley's
[371.16 - 376.32] original false Stephanie story from
[373.92 - 378.80] 2020 we are going to be reading off
[376.32 - 382.28] those questions in an upcoming episode
[378.80 - 384.56] Vanity Fair manipulated material and got
[382.28 - 386.40] so many things wrong in the story they
[384.56 - 389.40] published and that is going to be
[386.40 - 392.20] thoroughly exposed in this series but
[389.40 - 394.32] there 's a reason why even Vanity Fair
[392.20 - 397.36] would not publish these falsities from
[394.32 - 399.64] Ashley that Ashley wanted them to the
[397.36 - 401.60] plots have since expressed dismay with
[399.64 - 404.60] Vanity Fair by stating that the article
[401.60 - 408.00] only quote skim the surface the article
[404.60 - 410.08] is a lie it just isn't as big of a lie
[408.00 - 412.64] as they wanted it to
[410.08 - 414.68] be we held back on a lot last time
[412.64 - 416.76] around with these podcast to give Ashley
[414.68 - 419.84] an opportunity to do the right thing and
[416.76 - 421.04] at the very least just stop lying and
[419.84 - 423.28] spreading
[421.04 - 425.24] misinformation not only has Ashley not
[423.28 - 427.88] taken any accountability for the major
[425.24 - 430.08] falsity she's been proven wrong on but
[427.88 - 432.68] rather she has since continued on with
[430.08 - 434.60] her deranged plot she's pivoted she's
[432.68 - 437.16] created new false narratives and she's
[434.60 - 440.24] manufactured and spread an unimaginable
[437.16 - 442.28] number of New Lies I suspect that
[440.24 - 444.56] another motive of Ashley's now is to try
[442.28 - 446.60] to cover her tracks because we exposed
[444.56 - 448.80] in a large scale that her original story
[446.60 - 452.00] about Stephanie was fabricated and that
[448.80 - 454.32] she was lying from the very beginning we
[452.00 - 456.12] have also only just begun to publicize
[454.32 - 458.56] the evidence of the true corruption that
[456.12 - 460.44] took place in the process of Ashley and
[458.56 - 462.96] the other plotters pushing their false
[460.44 - 464.68] storyline onto Vanity Fair having to
[462.96 - 467.72] hammer it into the head of the
[464.68 - 470.20] journalist and having to threaten him to
[467.72 - 471.76] get him to publish it yes you heard that
[470.20 - 474.20] right if you're new to the series it's
[471.76 - 477.20] all on recorded calls and there's a lot
[474.20 - 479.12] more that's coming Ashley probably feels
[477.20 - 481.60] like she has to keep going and trying to
[479.12 - 483.72] come up with more lies and stories and
[481.60 - 485.60] trying to drum up fake controversy to
[483.72 - 488.68] keep up the facade so that she doesn't
[485.60 - 491.08] look like the liar that she is but being
[488.68 - 493.80] dishonest and manipulative can only ever
[491.08 - 497.40] get you so far we are going to be
[493.80 - 499.88] exposing all of it it's all coming out
[497.40 - 502.04] now Ashley's pattern is that when she
[499.88 - 504.72] gets proven wrong she pivots to other
[502.04 - 506.08] topics and she deflects it's a tactic
[504.72 - 508.20] meant to distract everyone who's
[506.08 - 510.40] listening to her by throwing more
[508.20 - 512.80] seemingly inflammatory false information
[510.40 - 514.92] about Anthony at them to divert their
[512.80 - 518.44] attention away from the fact that their
[514.92 - 521.40] leader Ashley was proven wrong and is
[518.44 - 523.40] lying so I implore anyone who's left out
[521.40 - 526.88] there still taking Ashley seriously in
[523.40 - 529.56] any way to ask themselves this if Ashley
[526.88 - 532.12] is so principled about honesty and the
[529.56 - 534.64] truth as she so claims then why hasn't
[532.12 - 537.12] she addressed any one of these seven
[534.64 - 539.12] major things that she spread online that
[537.12 - 542.16] she brought to the media and that she
[539.12 - 543.68] got so blatantly and provably wrong I
[542.16 - 547.20] will let you sit with
[543.68 - 549.36] that one of Ashley's true obsessions is
[547.20 - 552.20] repeatedly declaring how perfectly
[549.36 - 554.08] honest and morally Superior she is at
[552.20 - 556.92] the same time as she incessantly calls
[554.08 - 560.20] Anthony a liar sometimes multiple times
[556.92 - 562.16] per day it seems like Ashley thinks if
[560.20 - 564.56] she just repeats the words and accuses
[562.16 - 566.88] him enough times that people will submit
[564.56 - 568.44] and believe her regardless of how much
[566.88 - 570.24] the substance of her arguments either
[568.44 - 573.20] makes no sense at all or is just
[570.24 - 575.72] verifiably wrong that is the definition
[573.20 - 577.88] of true brainwashing and
[575.72 - 579.72] indoctrination after our podcast came
[577.88 - 581.88] out that exposed her and the other
[579.72 - 584.20] individuals involved with this plot
[581.88 - 586.84] using their own words on recording
[584.20 - 590.56] Ashley really ramped up this behavior
[586.84 - 593.68] for example on April 20th of 2023 Ashley
[590.56 - 596.64] changed her Instagram bio to
[593.68 - 600.08] read in case anyone comes looking for
[596.64 - 602.76] information about mm/ Amber
[600.08 - 605.12] frauds and
[602.76 - 607.48] Liars of course she now attacks and
[605.12 - 609.96] targets me as well because I am the one
[607.48 - 613.24] who exposed her and her friends using
[609.96 - 615.16] their own words on recordings around the
[613.24 - 617.28] same time Ashley posted the following
[615.16 - 620.56] comment and then deleted it along with
[617.28 - 622.08] the post that was attached to it shortly
[620.56 - 625.92] after
[622.08 - 629.00] period I will die on this hill if
[625.92 - 631.28] someone literally pointed a gun at me
[629.00 - 636.00] and ask me to say something other than
[631.28 - 640.56] the truth I am telling I would not do it
[636.00 - 643.76] if I don't have my Integrity I have
[640.56 - 646.52] nothing when asked by a commenter do you
[643.76 - 648.00] seriously believe your own
[646.52 - 651.16] Ashley
[648.00 - 654.12] replied I believe fully in the truth of
[651.16 - 658.56] what I'm saying
[654.12 - 660.48] yes and on May 5th of 2023 Ashley posted
[658.56 - 663.20] this
[660.48 - 665.84] when Anthony started spewing more of his
[663.20 - 668.40] dark lies on his wacky and idiotic
[665.84 - 671.24] podcast because of the impending Vanity
[668.40 - 675.20] Fair article I realized just how
[671.24 - 678.80] confused and lost people would
[675.20 - 680.92] be Ashley has yet to produce a single
[678.80 - 683.88] piece of legitimate evidence that
[680.92 - 686.60] Anthony or I have lied about a single
[683.88 - 688.68] thing she's only just continued to spin
[686.60 - 691.56] ridiculous false stories get things
[688.68 - 692.96] wrong spread ridiculous rumors and other
[691.56 - 694.96] plotters who might think that they've
[692.96 - 696.92] got something with posts on social media
[694.96 - 700.24] they are very wrong and that will all be
[696.92 - 702.24] exposed in due time meanwhile Ashley and
[700.24 - 704.16] her hateful group continue to ignore the
[702.24 - 706.52] fact that Ashley was proven wrong on
[704.16 - 709.40] these seven major falsities and more
[706.52 - 711.60] with evidence after the podcast came out
[709.40 - 713.60] last year Ashley went on a whole Rampage
[711.60 - 716.88] about lying as she tried to deflect
[713.60 - 718.76] attention away from that in that Rampage
[716.88 - 720.72] Ashley used a well-known true story
[718.76 - 724.04] about the experiences of a family that
[720.72 - 727.20] saved the lives of an estimated 800 Jews
[724.04 - 728.96] and other refugees during the Holocaust
[727.20 - 731.40] Ashley used the story to try to make a
[728.96 - 733.64] ludicrous point about lying and in the
[731.40 - 737.44] process of doing so Ashley ironically
[733.64 - 739.56] got no less than 18 facts wrong she
[737.44 - 741.80] expressed extremely offensive viewpoints
[739.56 - 743.64] regarding the Holocaust she disgraced
[741.80 - 745.60] the names of honorary women who risked
[743.64 - 748.44] their lives to save others during World
[745.60 - 750.56] War II and Ashley provided a perfect
[748.44 - 752.92] example that every everyone can verify
[750.56 - 755.28] of just How Deeply she manipulates
[752.92 - 758.28] butchers and twists the story she tells
[755.28 - 760.32] to serve her own agenda we are going to
[758.28 - 762.40] read off what Ashley posted and then I'm
[760.32 - 765.52] going to unpack all of the 18 things
[762.40 - 768.80] that she got wrong one by one almost
[765.52 - 772.12] every single sentence of Ashley's entire
[768.80 - 774.32] series is wrong in some way the story of
[772.12 - 776.68] the ten booom family was recounted in a
[774.32 - 779.28] book called The Hiding Place written by
[776.68 - 781.16] Corey tboom I read it cover to cover my
[779.28 - 782.80] myself and anyone out there can use this
[781.16 - 784.60] book to independently fact check
[782.80 - 787.48] Ashley's false information for
[784.60 - 789.04] themselves I encourage you to do so for
[787.48 - 790.56] context here's some background on the
[789.04 - 792.80] ten booom family from the official
[790.56 - 796.20] website of the museum dedicated to
[792.80 - 798.16] preserving its historical Legacy it says
[796.20 - 800.80] during the second world war the tboom
[798.16 - 803.72] home became a refuge a hiding place for
[800.80 - 805.56] fugitives and those hunted by the Nazis
[803.72 - 808.20] by protecting these people Casper and
[805.56 - 810.84] his daughters Betsy and Corey risked
[808.20 - 813.20] their lives this non-violent resistance
[810.84 - 814.84] against the Nazi oppressors was the ten
[813.20 - 819.20] boom's way of living out their Christian
[814.84 - 820.92] faith during 1943 and into 1944 there
[819.20 - 823.56] were usually five to six people
[820.92 - 825.48] illegally living in the tboom home some
[823.56 - 827.68] of whom were Jews and other members of
[825.48 - 829.40] the Dutch underground additional
[827.68 - 831.56] refugees would stay with the ten Booms
[829.40 - 833.76] for a few hours or a few days until
[831.56 - 836.20] another safe house could be located for
[833.76 - 838.24] them through these activities the ten
[836.20 - 840.92] booom family and their many friends and
[838.24 - 845.12] co-workers of the B group saved the
[840.92 - 848.04] lives of an estimated 800 Jews and other
[845.12 - 851.16] refugees in July of last year Ashley
[848.04 - 854.92] posted the following
[851.16 - 857.48] series okay question do you believe that
[854.92 - 859.44] sometimes lying to them is in people's
[857.48 - 863.24] best
[859.44 - 867.32] interest I am a lying is never the right
[863.24 - 871.64] choice person no matter what I want to
[867.32 - 874.88] share the story that convicted me of
[871.64 - 878.00] this Betsy 10 boom was personally
[874.88 - 881.96] convicted about honesty she and her
[878.00 - 884.64] family including Corey T boom hid juice
[881.96 - 888.36] in their house throughout World War II
[884.64 - 892.44] and were eventually arrested Betsy died
[888.36 - 892.44] in vve Brook concentration
[892.48 - 898.16] camp okay already we have falsity number
[895.24 - 900.16] one it was Betsy's sister nollie and
[898.16 - 902.16] nollie's daughter cocky who were
[900.16 - 904.24] convicted about honesty and struggled
[902.16 - 907.44] with the concept of telling lies in
[904.24 - 909.40] order to save Jewish life not Betsy
[907.44 - 911.72] Betsy was clear in her stance that under
[909.40 - 913.40] the circumstances of the Nazi regime it
[911.72 - 915.16] was the right thing to do to lie when
[913.40 - 917.88] necessary for the purposes of saving
[915.16 - 920.08] innocent lives Ashley also got the name
[917.88 - 925.52] of the Concentration Camp wrong it's
[920.08 - 928.60] Raven's Brook not Rave Brook she
[925.52 - 931.88] continues her sister Corey recounted a
[928.60 - 931.88] story of Betsy's
[931.96 - 937.16] honesty falsity number two again it was
[935.36 - 939.48] not Betsy who was convicted about
[937.16 - 942.36] honesty it was nollie and nollie's
[939.48 - 944.36] daughter cocky and we've got falsity
[942.36 - 947.28] number three here what Ashley is
[944.36 - 949.12] referring to is not a singular story as
[947.28 - 950.64] we go through the next several posts
[949.12 - 955.00] you'll see that Ashley incorrectly
[950.64 - 955.00] conflated multiple stories of separate
[955.36 - 961.72] instances once when German soldiers came
[958.64 - 964.28] to search the house there was not time
[961.72 - 967.60] for the Jews staying with them at that
[964.28 - 970.04] time to fully hide so they hid onto the
[967.60 - 970.04] kitchen
[970.08 - 975.88] table we've got falsity number four the
[973.36 - 978.92] incident involving the kitchen table in
[975.88 - 981.04] fact occurred when there was a ria a ria
[978.92 - 983.12] was a hostile raid during which the
[981.04 - 985.28] Germans would come to forcibly enlist
[983.12 - 988.12] young males in Holland to work in
[985.28 - 989.92] Munitions factories the tboom family had
[988.12 - 992.24] the young men in in their household hide
[989.92 - 995.12] in a cellar with a trapo underneath the
[992.24 - 998.08] kitchen table we've got falsity number
[995.12 - 1000.76] five the target of this raid was not
[998.08 - 1003.36] Jews to be placed in concentration camps
[1000.76 - 1005.20] it was Dutch boys like Corey's nephews
[1003.36 - 1006.00] that the Nazis wanted to enlist to work
[1005.20 - 1009.28] in
[1006.00 - 1011.84] factories and falsity number six during
[1009.28 - 1013.52] the Razia Cory's nephews did not hide
[1011.84 - 1016.72] underneath the table because they didn't
[1013.52 - 1018.56] have enough time to quote fully hide
[1016.72 - 1020.04] there was actually a Cellar underneath
[1018.56 - 1022.24] the kitchen table that had been
[1020.04 - 1024.72] specifically designed for hiding from
[1022.24 - 1026.56] Nazi soldiers and other threats The
[1024.72 - 1028.96] Cellar under the table is exactly where
[1026.56 - 1033.00] the boys intended to
[1028.96 - 1036.56] go a German soldier asked Betsy directly
[1033.00 - 1040.16] are there any Jews hiding in this
[1036.56 - 1042.96] house falsity number seven this is not
[1040.16 - 1045.08] the question that was asked in fact the
[1042.96 - 1047.84] German Soldier asked where are your
[1045.08 - 1051.40] brothers do you have brothers how old
[1047.84 - 1053.08] are they where are they now again in
[1051.40 - 1057.12] this incident the soldiers were looking
[1053.08 - 1059.72] for Dutch boys not Jews and falsity
[1057.12 - 1063.72] number eight it was not Betsy who the
[1059.72 - 1067.36] soldiers questioned it was cocky Betsy's
[1063.72 - 1069.80] niece she said yes they are under the
[1067.36 - 1069.80] kitchen
[1069.84 - 1076.92] table falsity number nine this is not
[1073.60 - 1079.56] what happened cocky not Betsy at first
[1076.92 - 1081.52] tried to avoid the question next when
[1079.56 - 1083.76] pressured cocky tells the soldiers that
[1081.52 - 1086.08] two of her brothers were under the table
[1083.76 - 1088.36] but then cocky burst out laughing which
[1086.08 - 1091.04] tricked them the Nazis thought that she
[1088.36 - 1094.56] was joking they got upset and they left
[1091.04 - 1097.96] the soldiers did not capture any of the
[1094.56 - 1100.24] boys her sister Corey was horrified and
[1097.96 - 1103.84] crushed the couple was arrested and
[1100.24 - 1106.96] taken away to a concentration camp Betsy
[1103.84 - 1106.96] held fast to her
[1107.44 - 1114.80] conviction this post unbelievably has
[1110.64 - 1116.56] four falsities in one falsity number 10
[1114.80 - 1118.44] this is where Ashley began conflating
[1116.56 - 1119.76] different incidents there was a
[1118.44 - 1121.60] different event separate from the
[1119.76 - 1124.44] kitchen table story in which one
[1121.60 - 1126.64] individual woman not a couple was taken
[1124.44 - 1128.80] away to the old Jewish theater in
[1126.64 - 1130.36] Amsterdam the theater was a holding
[1128.80 - 1132.60] place from which Jews could be
[1130.36 - 1134.72] transported to concentration camps it
[1132.60 - 1138.04] was not a concentration camp
[1134.72 - 1139.64] itself falsity number 11 even in this
[1138.04 - 1141.48] other incident that occurred at a
[1139.64 - 1143.76] completely different time than the
[1141.48 - 1146.76] kitchen table Story the Jewish woman who
[1143.76 - 1150.80] was captured Analise was never taken to
[1146.76 - 1153.52] a concentration camp falsity number 12
[1150.80 - 1155.48] Corey was not horrified nor crushed by
[1153.52 - 1157.64] the kitchen table incident the kitchen
[1155.48 - 1159.80] table incident in fact made Corey start
[1157.64 - 1161.84] to question the logic of nollie and her
[1159.80 - 1164.48] daughter cocky who nearly gave her
[1161.84 - 1166.16] brothers up to the Nazis Corey was
[1164.48 - 1168.20] horrified and crushed by the theater
[1166.16 - 1170.28] incident that resulted in Analise being
[1168.20 - 1171.16] captured by by the Nazis which happened
[1170.28 - 1175.56] later
[1171.16 - 1177.60] on falsity number 13 it was not Betsy
[1175.56 - 1179.84] who held fast to her conviction it was
[1177.60 - 1182.20] nollie and it was in a completely
[1179.84 - 1185.08] different
[1182.20 - 1187.56] incident less than a week later the
[1185.08 - 1191.16] Concentration Camp those Jews were taken
[1187.56 - 1193.28] to was liberated by Allied Forces and
[1191.16 - 1196.00] everyone there was transported to
[1193.28 - 1199.44] Freedom including the couple that had
[1196.00 - 1203.32] been in hiding
[1199.44 - 1206.96] and this one post from Ashley shockingly
[1203.32 - 1209.40] has five falsities in it falsity number
[1206.96 - 1211.20] 14 the kitchen table incident was
[1209.40 - 1213.40] further than a week apart from this
[1211.20 - 1216.28] event Ashley conflated different
[1213.40 - 1219.16] incidents and got the timeline wrong
[1216.28 - 1220.88] falsity number 15 in the other story
[1219.16 - 1223.20] involving Analise it was not a
[1220.88 - 1225.32] concentration camp that got liberated an
[1223.20 - 1228.68] aisee was being held in the old Jewish
[1225.32 - 1231.12] theater and the theater was broken into
[1228.68 - 1233.12] falsity number 16 the book does not
[1231.12 - 1237.28] specify that the theater was broken into
[1233.12 - 1238.92] by Allied Forces falsity number 17 not
[1237.28 - 1242.16] everyone in the theater was transported
[1238.92 - 1244.08] to Freedom only 40 Jews were rescued and
[1242.16 - 1245.36] it was not a concentration camp that
[1244.08 - 1249.16] they were coming
[1245.36 - 1251.44] from and falsity number 18 Analise was
[1249.16 - 1254.44] part of those 40 rescued Jews but she
[1251.44 - 1257.64] was not part of a couple like Ashley
[1254.44 - 1260.48] said it is not our job to control the
[1257.64 - 1263.44] outcome of our action ctions it is not
[1260.48 - 1266.40] our job to decide how and when the truth
[1263.44 - 1272.40] should be known we either believe in the
[1266.40 - 1272.40] immutable importance of it or we don't
[1272.80 - 1277.44] period here Ashley concludes her
[1275.56 - 1279.84] mutilated version of this story by
[1277.44 - 1281.92] asserting her ridiculous Viewpoint that
[1279.84 - 1283.88] anyone who lied to the Nazis to protect
[1281.92 - 1287.80] and save the lives of Jews during the
[1283.88 - 1289.04] Holocaust was morally wrong following
[1287.80 - 1291.40] her as
[1289.04 - 1292.92] logic Ashley is saying that she believes
[1291.40 - 1295.40] everyone should have been honest with
[1292.92 - 1297.16] the Nazi soldiers even if it led to more
[1295.40 - 1299.68] Jews being Mass
[1297.16 - 1301.52] murdered Ashley declares that one should
[1299.68 - 1304.00] not be concerned with the consequences
[1301.52 - 1306.40] of their actions even in the context of
[1304.00 - 1307.76] the holocost and even if their actions
[1306.40 - 1311.32] Ena
[1307.76 - 1311.32] genocide truly
[1311.56 - 1317.52] unbelievable people who lie are liars if
[1315.36 - 1319.76] you're willing to lie about one thing
[1317.52 - 1322.92] you might be willing to lie about
[1319.76 - 1325.32] everything One Lie calls into question
[1322.92 - 1331.28] the entirety of someone's
[1325.32 - 1331.28] character what about 2 three 4 100
[1331.48 - 1339.28] lies I mean how much more ironic could
[1335.04 - 1342.20] this possibly be Ashley Foster told 18
[1339.28 - 1344.04] falsities 18 falsities in a story she
[1342.20 - 1347.00] tried to use to make an absurd point
[1344.04 - 1349.92] about lying this series was all about
[1347.00 - 1351.88] Ashley's Doctrine on always being honest
[1349.92 - 1354.60] which Ashley claims she aderes to
[1351.88 - 1356.88] perfectly and she's literally violating
[1354.60 - 1358.36] that in the very story she used to try
[1356.88 - 1361.20] to make that
[1358.36 - 1363.88] point and then here Ashley even went as
[1361.20 - 1366.00] far as to use derogatory terms to refer
[1363.88 - 1368.88] to what the tboom family heroically did
[1366.00 - 1371.96] to protect and save the lives of 800
[1368.88 - 1373.92] innocent people from being murdered if
[1371.96 - 1376.08] the members of the tboom family did not
[1373.92 - 1378.72] lie to the Nazi oppressors who were
[1376.08 - 1380.92] committing atrocities those 800 Jews
[1378.72 - 1383.20] would have died and Ashley has the
[1380.92 - 1385.60] audacity to call into question the
[1383.20 - 1388.20] entirety of the ten booom family's
[1385.60 - 1391.00] character who cares if people are being
[1388.20 - 1392.68] tortured abused and murdered it's not
[1391.00 - 1394.88] your job to worry at all about the
[1392.68 - 1397.04] consequences of your actions what's
[1394.88 - 1398.88] important according to Ashley is that
[1397.04 - 1400.64] you try to prove your own superiority
[1398.88 - 1402.28] like she's trying to do with this warped
[1400.64 - 1404.60] story that she
[1402.28 - 1408.16] invented this is not about promoting
[1404.60 - 1411.12] lying it's about having sanity Ashley
[1408.16 - 1413.52] could have used anything any other story
[1411.12 - 1415.92] or anecdote or something else to express
[1413.52 - 1419.04] herself and make the claim that she
[1415.92 - 1422.48] doesn't believe in lying but to use this
[1419.04 - 1426.04] story in this way let alone distorting
[1422.48 - 1428.96] it with 18 falsities in the process to
[1426.04 - 1430.52] say that when faced with Nazis asking
[1428.96 - 1432.64] about Jews hiding in your home during
[1430.52 - 1434.44] the Holocaust knowing that they are
[1432.64 - 1436.88] going to be taken to a concentration
[1434.44 - 1439.92] camp Ashley saying that she would give
[1436.88 - 1442.56] up the Jews it's a window into how
[1439.92 - 1445.72] Ashley thinks this is what we're dealing
[1442.56 - 1448.96] with who in their right mind thinks like
[1445.72 - 1451.84] this Ashley's entire false story about
[1448.96 - 1454.76] Stephanie was built on her original
[1451.84 - 1457.08] claim I never told Stephanie to see a
[1454.76 - 1459.40] doctor and not once did Ashley ever
[1457.08 - 1461.84] reach out to me or call me up and say
[1459.40 - 1464.80] hey what's up did you tell Stephanie to
[1461.84 - 1468.40] see a doctor but because she lied she
[1464.80 - 1470.60] had a save face and stay with the LIE
[1468.40 - 1472.88] and that takes a certain kind of person
[1470.60 - 1475.80] a person who doesn't want to admit a
[1472.88 - 1479.52] huge mistake a person who doesn't want
[1475.80 - 1483.08] to come clean and keeps going making
[1479.52 - 1485.60] more huge false claims lies and mistakes
[1483.08 - 1488.92] if anyone wants a window into Ashley's
[1485.60 - 1491.80] mind it's this Holocaust story tell
[1488.92 - 1494.84] dozens and dozens of lies and falsities
[1491.80 - 1497.84] and then say how one should never tell a
[1494.84 - 1499.80] lie so much so that it's best to just
[1497.84 - 1502.88] call out the Jews hiding underneath the
[1499.80 - 1505.64] table to the Nazis you have the daughter
[1502.88 - 1508.56] of a billionaire family that lies and
[1505.64 - 1511.64] tells falsities and she's using this
[1508.56 - 1514.40] false story about the Holocaust to try
[1511.64 - 1517.20] to give you permission to not care about
[1514.40 - 1520.04] the consequences of your actions this is
[1517.20 - 1522.40] the entitlement of Ashley who doesn't
[1520.04 - 1525.56] care about who gets harmed by a false
[1522.40 - 1529.12] story she just wants her documentary she
[1525.56 - 1530.96] doesn't care who's in the way
[1529.12 - 1533.04] when Ashley's business proposals got
[1530.96 - 1534.64] turned down by Anthony and her big
[1533.04 - 1537.04] career dreams didn't work out the way
[1534.64 - 1539.64] that she wanted them to Ashley set out
[1537.04 - 1542.00] on this mission to tear Anthony down to
[1539.64 - 1544.96] constantly take stabs at him to try to
[1542.00 - 1546.92] blast him in the media to attack him to
[1544.96 - 1549.64] put him and the entire medical medium
[1546.92 - 1552.44] Community down to be little and demean
[1549.64 - 1554.36] them to try to make them feel small and
[1552.44 - 1556.16] there is no low that she will not stoop
[1554.36 - 1558.56] to in her
[1556.16 - 1561.60] Pursuit what makes Ashley serious on
[1558.56 - 1563.48] lying even more of an absolute farce is
[1561.60 - 1565.88] the fact that Ashley Gravely missed the
[1563.48 - 1568.40] mark on what the actual ten booom story
[1565.88 - 1569.84] portrays about lying which is very
[1568.40 - 1573.08] different from the story that Ashley
[1569.84 - 1574.92] seems to have made up in her head Betsy
[1573.08 - 1577.52] and Cory ten booom took on the role of
[1574.92 - 1580.48] protecting and saving Jews they are the
[1577.52 - 1582.68] heroes of the story their sister nollie
[1580.48 - 1584.32] and nollie's daughter cocky are the ones
[1582.68 - 1587.20] who were struggling with the concept of
[1584.32 - 1589.68] lying not Betsy whom Ashley confused
[1587.20 - 1592.88] them with throughout the story nollie's
[1589.68 - 1595.88] family pointed out nollie's illogic
[1592.88 - 1598.08] nollie was still doing lies with her
[1595.88 - 1601.08] actions even if she wouldn't tell lies
[1598.08 - 1602.40] from her lips with words and nalo taught
[1601.08 - 1603.60] her daughter to think in the same
[1602.40 - 1606.76] illogical
[1603.60 - 1609.52] way for example to nollie as well as
[1606.76 - 1611.68] cocky it was okay to partake in creating
[1609.52 - 1614.28] the hiding place in the cellar under the
[1611.68 - 1617.04] kitchen table for her sons to deceive
[1614.28 - 1619.40] and hide from German soldiers in but
[1617.04 - 1621.00] when the soldiers asked cocky a question
[1619.40 - 1623.28] she felt that she must tell the truth
[1621.00 - 1626.24] from her lips even though it nearly
[1623.28 - 1628.00] harmed her own brothers and then cocky
[1626.24 - 1629.96] also burst out laughing during this
[1628.00 - 1631.76] incident which made it seem like she was
[1629.96 - 1634.88] joking about the boys being under the
[1631.76 - 1637.24] table and that was not truthful it was
[1634.88 - 1639.80] an inconsistency that was directly
[1637.24 - 1641.88] addressed in the book itself such as in
[1639.80 - 1645.36] the following excerpt written by Corey
[1641.88 - 1647.40] tboom it says it was a strange dinner
[1645.36 - 1649.00] party that evening veering as it did
[1647.40 - 1650.88] from heartfelt Thanksgiving to the
[1649.00 - 1653.72] nearest thing to a bitter argument our
[1650.88 - 1655.96] close-nit family has ever had nollie
[1653.72 - 1659.04] stuck by cocky insisting she would have
[1655.96 - 1661.88] answer the same way God honors truth
[1659.04 - 1664.28] telling with Perfect protection Peter
[1661.88 - 1667.40] and Bob from the Viewpoint of the trapo
[1664.28 - 1669.68] weren't so sure and neither was I I
[1667.40 - 1672.28] could spot the illogic and it isn't
[1669.68 - 1674.48] logical to say the truth and do a lie
[1672.28 - 1678.32] what about analise's false papers and
[1674.48 - 1680.76] that maid's uniform on Katrine
[1678.32 - 1684.24] nonetheless Ashley goes on to end her
[1680.76 - 1687.32] depraved series with the following
[1684.24 - 1688.16] quote choose your Leaders with wisdom
[1687.32 - 1691.12] and
[1688.16 - 1696.52] forethought to be led by a liar is to
[1691.12 - 1696.52] ask to be told lies Octavia E
[1696.76 - 1702.56] Butler 18 falsities later and on top of
[1700.36 - 1705.76] the repulsive spin she put on a
[1702.56 - 1708.68] holocaust story Ashley also disrespected
[1705.76 - 1712.40] the names of true heroes but ET and Cory
[1708.68 - 1715.04] tboom were incredible honorable
[1712.40 - 1717.36] leaders by demonizing the decisions
[1715.04 - 1719.72] these women made under entirely evil
[1717.36 - 1722.00] circumstances in order to save hundreds
[1719.72 - 1724.48] of people's lives Ashley utterly
[1722.00 - 1726.24] disgraces the ten booom Legacy and all
[1724.48 - 1728.96] of those who fought the absolutely
[1726.24 - 1730.76] reprehensible acts of the Nazi regime
[1728.96 - 1732.68] including the 6 million Jews who
[1730.76 - 1734.84] perished during the
[1732.68 - 1737.84] Holocaust and then of course what
[1734.84 - 1741.28] Ashley's inferring with all of this is
[1737.84 - 1743.76] that I'm a liar and that she's not she's
[1741.28 - 1745.72] saying that she's such an honest person
[1743.76 - 1747.76] she wouldn't even lie to protect a Jew
[1745.72 - 1752.12] during the Holocaust while she's telling
[1747.76 - 1756.20] a story herself with 18 falsities in
[1752.12 - 1759.68] it this is Ashley's pattern she accuses
[1756.20 - 1763.52] people of what she's actually doing
[1759.68 - 1765.48] Ashley lies Ashley tells false stories
[1763.52 - 1768.96] Ashley's version of The Hiding Place
[1765.48 - 1771.56] story had 18 falsities in it in Ashley's
[1768.96 - 1774.32] March 6th 2020 Instagram post about
[1771.56 - 1776.56] Stephanie there were more than 15
[1774.32 - 1779.08] falsities in the comment section of
[1776.56 - 1782.04] Ashley's March 6th 2020 Instagram post
[1779.08 - 1783.12] about Stephanie Ashley told more than 15
[1782.04 - 1786.04] additional
[1783.12 - 1787.80] falsities in Ashley's March 7th 2020
[1786.04 - 1789.48] blog post about Stephanie there were
[1787.80 - 1791.60] more than 20
[1789.48 - 1794.24] falsities in the comment section of
[1791.60 - 1796.68] Ashley's February 11th 2020 Instagram
[1794.24 - 1799.36] post about Stephanie Ashley told more
[1796.68 - 1802.56] than 10 falsities
[1799.36 - 1807.28] in just these few instances alone Ashley
[1802.56 - 1809.68] told a total of 78 verifiable lies and
[1807.28 - 1812.04] falsities for someone who supposedly
[1809.68 - 1814.00] feels so strongly about the truth that
[1812.04 - 1816.20] she believes it's not even right to lie
[1814.00 - 1818.56] to save a Jew's life during the
[1816.20 - 1820.52] Holocaust for someone who claimed that
[1818.56 - 1823.36] they are a lying is never the right
[1820.52 - 1825.52] choice person no matter what that's a
[1823.36 - 1828.96] lot of
[1825.52 - 1833.16] falsities I am a lying is never the
[1828.96 - 1836.84] right choice person no matter
[1833.16 - 1840.44] what a lying is never the right choice
[1836.84 - 1842.20] person no matter what H but wait a
[1840.44 - 1844.36] second in addition to the immeasurable
[1842.20 - 1846.88] number of falsities and flat out lies
[1844.36 - 1849.16] Ashley has continued to spew in the last
[1846.88 - 1851.44] year like saying that her family doesn't
[1849.16 - 1853.48] have a private jet or vacation homes
[1851.44 - 1856.48] when they do and that she's never made
[1853.48 - 1858.88] money off of Instagram when she has
[1856.48 - 1861.60] Ashley also has a document Ed record of
[1858.88 - 1865.16] instructing other people to lie and be
[1861.60 - 1867.64] dishonest for her in fact I am one of
[1865.16 - 1869.40] those people in my calls with the
[1867.64 - 1871.92] plotters last year after they had
[1869.40 - 1875.32] explained their plan to smear Anthony
[1871.92 - 1877.16] and try to create a postmed medium era
[1875.32 - 1878.92] Ashley said this to
[1877.16 - 1882.68] me
[1878.92 - 1886.56] so I'm just grateful that you that
[1882.68 - 1890.08] you're on that on that you're exploring
[1886.56 - 1894.56] that now and and I hope that you'll
[1890.08 - 1894.56] honor Robbie and Taylor's confidence
[1894.68 - 1903.16] by by um by not sharing
[1899.44 - 1905.88] with oh anything with Anthony until it's
[1903.16 - 1908.44] the right time it's a little bit of a
[1905.88 - 1912.00] it's a little bit of a d Dynamite like a
[1908.44 - 1912.00] loaded situation right
[1912.20 - 1917.96] now and Taylor said this to me as
[1915.72 - 1919.16] well yeah I want to make sure you would
[1917.96 - 1922.60] tell
[1919.16 - 1924.28] Anthony can we hear that again I want to
[1922.60 - 1926.68] make sure you would tell
[1924.28 - 1930.12] Anthony I wanted to make sure you
[1926.68 - 1932.28] wouldn't tell Anthony the plotters and
[1930.12 - 1934.20] Ashley specifically wanted me to keep
[1932.28 - 1936.68] everything they told me a secret from
[1934.20 - 1938.88] Anthony if Anthony had reached out and
[1936.68 - 1940.96] asked me what was going on Ashley's
[1938.88 - 1943.92] expectation was that I was supposed to
[1940.96 - 1945.96] lie to him Ashley apparently believes
[1943.92 - 1947.96] it's never the right choice to lie not
[1945.96 - 1950.28] under any circumstance no matter what
[1947.96 - 1951.64] but not even to save people's lives
[1950.28 - 1953.88] during the
[1951.64 - 1956.28] Holocaust except when Ashley wanted me
[1953.88 - 1958.64] to lie for the benefit of her and her
[1956.28 - 1962.48] friends that was somehow
[1958.64 - 1965.40] okay on July 16th of 2018 a friend
[1962.48 - 1967.24] texted Ashley and said by the way a pure
[1965.40 - 1969.28] encapsulations order I placed went
[1967.24 - 1970.84] missing and they are calling me but just
[1969.28 - 1975.00] in case they accidentally call your
[1970.84 - 1977.44] number that's why haha and Ashley
[1975.00 - 1980.00] replied okay just tell them I plac the
[1977.44 - 1984.56] order for you because I'm not supposed
[1980.00 - 1987.60] to let people use my account
[1984.56 - 1989.68] LOL so here Ashley is letting a friend
[1987.60 - 1991.32] use her supplement purchasing account
[1989.68 - 1994.12] and she's acknowledging that she's not
[1991.32 - 1996.24] supposed to this is what Corey and Betsy
[1994.12 - 2000.56] tboom from The Hiding Place story that
[1996.24 - 2002.48] Ashley referenced would call doing a lie
[2000.56 - 2004.44] then Ashley's also instructing her
[2002.48 - 2006.96] friend in this text to lie about who
[2004.44 - 2009.32] placed her supplement order as her
[2006.96 - 2011.48] actions make very clear Ashley said she
[2009.32 - 2013.76] is a lying is never the right choice
[2011.48 - 2015.44] type of person only because that suited
[2013.76 - 2017.60] her Narrative of the moment as that is
[2015.44 - 2019.44] obviously not something Ashley actually
[2017.60 - 2022.28] believes in or lives
[2019.44 - 2024.52] by again we're not arguing for or
[2022.28 - 2026.68] against the morality of lying here I'm
[2024.52 - 2029.80] simply pointing out the absolutely
[2026.68 - 2032.60] unhinged contradictions in Ashley's own
[2029.80 - 2035.04] thinking writing speech and
[2032.60 - 2037.28] behavior since the beginning of Ashley's
[2035.04 - 2039.44] mission to smear Anthony Ashley has
[2037.28 - 2041.08] attempted to shield and cover for her
[2039.44 - 2044.16] falsities by saying that she's just
[2041.08 - 2046.40] sharing her truth she's also tried to
[2044.16 - 2048.36] infer credibility based on her purported
[2046.40 - 2050.88] direct experience with Stephanie for a
[2048.36 - 2052.48] short period of time in the comment
[2050.88 - 2056.00] section of a post Ashley made on
[2052.48 - 2059.48] February 11th of 20120 she said
[2056.00 - 2062.36] this the reason I chose to share exactly
[2059.48 - 2064.24] what I did about her story is because I
[2062.36 - 2067.16] was there for that small part and
[2064.24 - 2070.68] physically present with her so I felt
[2067.16 - 2070.68] like something I could share
[2070.80 - 2075.32] truthfully in this comment Ashley is
[2073.32 - 2078.12] referring to the false timeline that she
[2075.32 - 2079.76] also repeated later on in 2020 in which
[2078.12 - 2081.32] Ashley stated that Stephanie had
[2079.76 - 2084.04] discovered her breast lump while
[2081.32 - 2087.12] Stephanie was staying with Ashley in
[2084.04 - 2089.40] 2016 as we've shared many times this is
[2087.12 - 2090.80] incorrect the evidence clearly shows
[2089.40 - 2094.68] that Stephanie discovered her breast
[2090.80 - 2096.64] lump on March 6th of 2017 a whole year
[2094.68 - 2099.40] after the timeline of Ashley's fake
[2096.64 - 2101.72] story Ashley was not with Stephanie when
[2099.40 - 2104.80] Stephanie discovered her breast lump in
[2101.72 - 2107.04] 2017 as we discussed previously Ashley
[2104.80 - 2109.60] admitted that she did not see Stephanie
[2107.04 - 2111.32] once during the entire two years that
[2109.60 - 2114.24] passed between the time that Stephanie
[2111.32 - 2116.64] stayed in Ashley's home in 2016 and the
[2114.24 - 2119.12] time that Stephanie passed away in
[2116.64 - 2120.80] 2018 Ashley did not visit Stephanie
[2119.12 - 2123.20] during the time of her injury nor when
[2120.80 - 2125.08] Stephanie was in the hospital Ashley's
[2123.20 - 2127.16] even admitted that she barely kept in
[2125.08 - 2129.68] communication with Stephanie at all
[2127.16 - 2132.96] during the time of her injury on March
[2129.68 - 2136.28] 6th of 2020 she wrote
[2132.96 - 2138.56] this stephani I didn't talk often during
[2136.28 - 2141.44] her back
[2138.56 - 2144.04] injury the truth is that Ashley was not
[2141.44 - 2145.88] physically present for any single part
[2144.04 - 2148.68] of Stephanie's entire Journey with her
[2145.88 - 2151.88] breast lump her back injury her cancer
[2148.68 - 2154.00] or her passing so not only is ashly
[2151.88 - 2155.80] devoid of facts but the single leg of
[2154.00 - 2157.60] credibility she tried to stand on by
[2155.80 - 2159.36] saying that she was physically present
[2157.60 - 2162.36] for a small portion of what Stephanie
[2159.36 - 2164.88] experienced with her breast lump is a
[2162.36 - 2166.64] lie after the release of our first four
[2164.88 - 2168.52] podcasts in which we presented a large
[2166.64 - 2170.92] amount of evidence that disproved
[2168.52 - 2172.88] Ashley's false storylines Ashley got a
[2170.92 - 2174.72] lot of push back for what she had done
[2172.88 - 2177.84] and the falsities she was continuing to
[2174.72 - 2180.48] try to spread in response to this push
[2177.84 - 2183.52] back Ashley continued to Pedal the I'm
[2180.48 - 2185.84] just sharing my truth narrative it's a
[2183.52 - 2188.24] tactic to try to evade being held to an
[2185.84 - 2190.68] objective standard of the
[2188.24 - 2193.40] truth rather than presenting legitimate
[2190.68 - 2197.24] facts or evidence Ashley constantly uses
[2193.40 - 2200.32] and relies upon someone told me I was
[2197.24 - 2202.80] there for it I experienced it personally
[2200.32 - 2205.32] or I heard a rumor statements which
[2202.80 - 2208.12] cannot be verified and of course can
[2205.32 - 2210.88] easily be fabricated and even if it were
[2208.12 - 2214.00] a valid pass that she's just sharing her
[2210.88 - 2216.68] truth Ashley can't even get her truth
[2214.00 - 2218.84] straight in all of Ashley's attempts to
[2216.68 - 2221.32] make Anthony medical medium information
[2218.84 - 2223.60] look bad she's told numerous stories
[2221.32 - 2225.88] multiple times in completely different
[2223.60 - 2228.44] contradictory versions that cannot all
[2225.88 - 2230.88] be true at the same time here is an
[2228.44 - 2234.04] example of a storyline Ashley told four
[2230.88 - 2236.44] different versions of on February 11th
[2234.04 - 2238.44] of 2020 when Ashley first started
[2236.44 - 2240.12] posting false information about what had
[2238.44 - 2243.00] happened to Stephanie she got a
[2240.12 - 2246.00] commenter who said I find this very hard
[2243.00 - 2249.52] to believe and Ashley
[2246.00 - 2251.96] replied that's okay okay I understand I
[2249.52 - 2254.16] worked really hard while writing this to
[2251.96 - 2257.60] make sure everything I wrote was
[2254.16 - 2260.36] absolutely true and not opinion the
[2257.60 - 2263.28] truth is she was a close friend of his
[2260.36 - 2266.28] for several years and had followed his
[2263.28 - 2270.16] protocol more exactly than anyone else
[2266.28 - 2273.36] I've ever met for that entire
[2270.16 - 2276.36] time in this version Ashley's saying
[2273.36 - 2277.88] that from her own perspective she
[2276.36 - 2280.64] observed that Stephanie followed
[2277.88 - 2283.00] Anthony's protocol more exactly than
[2280.64 - 2284.08] anyone else she's ever met for that
[2283.00 - 2286.72] entire
[2284.08 - 2288.56] time those who actually understand
[2286.72 - 2291.56] medical medium information know that
[2288.56 - 2293.24] there is no one medical medium protocol
[2291.56 - 2296.20] anyway so this is a problematic
[2293.24 - 2297.68] statement in and of itself but then in
[2296.20 - 2299.88] the second version of this same
[2297.68 - 2303.28] statement Ashley says something similar
[2299.88 - 2305.12] but adds to it on March 6th of 2020
[2303.28 - 2309.52] Ashley posted
[2305.12 - 2313.12] this and allow me to be clear I have
[2309.52 - 2315.92] never met to this day anyone who
[2313.12 - 2320.80] followed Anthony's advice more closely
[2315.92 - 2320.80] than Steph not even Anthony
[2321.36 - 2327.12] himself she told this version now with
[2324.44 - 2329.36] the addition of not even Anthony himself
[2327.12 - 2331.88] in at least two different places which
[2329.36 - 2334.24] is ridiculous because Ashley had no idea
[2331.88 - 2335.96] what Anthony was eating or not eating as
[2334.24 - 2338.72] they were not nearly as close as she
[2335.96 - 2341.04] constantly tries to portray it to be in
[2338.72 - 2344.16] the third version from May 5th of last
[2341.04 - 2348.12] year she says something
[2344.16 - 2351.44] different also I don't want to be rude
[2348.12 - 2353.56] but you're patently wrong some of us
[2351.44 - 2356.44] here have studied and applied his
[2353.56 - 2359.80] information more carefully than even
[2356.44 - 2362.32] Anthony himself that's something he told
[2359.80 - 2362.32] Steph
[2362.64 - 2367.96] once so now instead of Ashley making the
[2365.72 - 2370.00] statement about Stephanie like she did
[2367.96 - 2372.52] in the previous two versions she's
[2370.00 - 2374.88] changed the subject of the story to some
[2372.52 - 2376.40] of us here have applied the information
[2374.88 - 2379.60] better than Anthony
[2376.40 - 2381.64] himself Stephanie passed away in 2018
[2379.60 - 2382.92] and again Ashley posted this version
[2381.64 - 2385.96] last year
[2382.92 - 2387.84] 2023 does she mean by some of us here
[2385.96 - 2389.36] that her and her co- plotters have
[2387.84 - 2392.48] followed and applied medical medium
[2389.36 - 2395.04] information better than Anthony that's
[2392.48 - 2397.00] laughable and instead of this being an
[2395.04 - 2399.36] observation from her own perspective
[2397.00 - 2402.36] like it was in the previous two versions
[2399.36 - 2405.36] Ashley's changed it to this is something
[2402.36 - 2410.60] Anthony told Stephanie
[2405.36 - 2410.60] once in the fourth version Ashley says
[2410.68 - 2417.08] this remember when Anthony claimed Steph
[2413.96 - 2421.36] didn't follow his protocols well enough
[2417.08 - 2423.84] what a lie from the pit of Hell Anthony
[2421.36 - 2427.00] told me personally one time that Steph
[2423.84 - 2429.32] followed his protocols even better than
[2427.00 - 2429.32] he
[2429.48 - 2433.92] Dead first of all because Ashley
[2432.00 - 2436.88] literally gets everything wrong I have
[2433.92 - 2438.24] to clear this up Anthony has never said
[2436.88 - 2440.40] that Stephanie didn't follow his
[2438.24 - 2443.12] protocols well enough absolutely never
[2440.40 - 2445.88] said it in previous podcast episodes we
[2443.12 - 2447.40] simply debunked Ashley's falsity that
[2445.88 - 2449.96] Stephanie had followed medical medium
[2447.40 - 2451.40] information to a te we used multiple
[2449.96 - 2454.08] pieces of evidence to show that
[2451.40 - 2456.56] Stephanie factually did not follow it to
[2454.08 - 2459.20] a te there was no implication made that
[2456.56 - 2461.60] Stephanie should have done anything
[2459.20 - 2463.64] better or differently in fact we played
[2461.60 - 2465.92] an audio message from Stephanie in which
[2463.64 - 2468.96] she had said that she knew that Anthony
[2465.92 - 2471.52] wasn't a fan of the Dr Morse grape fast
[2468.96 - 2474.24] that Stephanie said she was quote hooked
[2471.52 - 2476.48] on doing but that she was doing them
[2474.24 - 2479.08] anyway and that Anthony was not pushing
[2476.48 - 2480.68] her to do medical medium instead anyone
[2479.08 - 2483.88] can go back and listen to our previous
[2480.68 - 2486.20] episodes to verify that Stephanie
[2483.88 - 2488.72] partook in lots of different modalities
[2486.20 - 2491.72] and health approaches at times I would
[2488.72 - 2494.64] say this is fine or that is fine because
[2491.72 - 2497.16] Stephanie was on her own path doing her
[2494.64 - 2499.40] own raw food thing and as she said in
[2497.16 - 2501.76] the audio she was already hooked on
[2499.40 - 2504.08] certain things so I was supportive of
[2501.76 - 2507.12] Stephanie doing what she wanted to do I
[2504.08 - 2510.32] did not control Stephanie's decisions or
[2507.12 - 2513.36] even try to instead I supported her in
[2510.32 - 2516.32] any decision she made with things that
[2513.36 - 2519.08] spoke to her even if it wasn't medical
[2516.32 - 2521.96] medium they're trying to punish me for
[2519.08 - 2524.12] not controlling Stephanie's wishes and
[2521.96 - 2526.96] health choices and then they're also
[2524.12 - 2529.68] trying to punish me and blame me for
[2526.96 - 2532.48] supposedly controlling them this is very
[2529.68 - 2535.16] abusive behavior on their
[2532.48 - 2538.16] part Ashley said that Anthony's claim
[2535.16 - 2541.16] was a lie from the pit of Hell when
[2538.16 - 2543.40] Ashley fully made up the claim he never
[2541.16 - 2545.80] said it what we did share on the podcast
[2543.40 - 2548.36] was hard evidence from Stephanie herself
[2545.80 - 2551.28] far from a lie and Ashley saying all of
[2548.36 - 2553.92] this at the same time as she herself is
[2551.28 - 2556.64] telling an actual lie as part of a story
[2553.92 - 2559.80] she told four different contradictory
[2556.64 - 2561.68] versions of in this fourth version of
[2559.80 - 2563.64] the same story from Ashley about what
[2561.68 - 2565.36] Stephanie was eating and doing instead
[2563.64 - 2567.84] of the statement being an observation
[2565.36 - 2570.60] from Ashley's own perspective or
[2567.84 - 2573.44] something Anthony told Stephanie once
[2570.60 - 2577.20] like Ashley said previously now she's
[2573.44 - 2579.24] changed it to Anthony told Ashley that
[2577.20 - 2582.76] Stephanie followed his protocols even
[2579.24 - 2584.72] better than he did so which is it all of
[2582.76 - 2586.56] these four story versions contradict
[2584.72 - 2589.64] themselves and they cannot all be true
[2586.56 - 2591.88] at the same time that is because Ashley
[2589.64 - 2593.08] is lying and she can't even keep her own
[2591.88 - 2596.56] madeup story
[2593.08 - 2599.16] straight Ashley did not know what I was
[2596.56 - 2601.80] eating I didn't speak to Ashley about
[2599.16 - 2604.48] how I ate I didn't tell Ashley that
[2601.80 - 2607.80] Stephanie ate better than me I never
[2604.48 - 2610.40] talked to Ashley about Stephanie at all
[2607.80 - 2612.20] so it's not even possible I never told
[2610.40 - 2614.48] Stephanie that Stephanie eats better
[2612.20 - 2616.64] than me Ashley's just fabricating
[2614.48 - 2619.72] stories
[2616.64 - 2621.36] again furthermore Ashley has admitted
[2619.72 - 2623.72] that she isn't really that versed in
[2621.36 - 2626.92] medical medium information in a live
[2623.72 - 2630.32] stream she did in 2020 she said
[2626.92 - 2632.72] this all right will I read his new book
[2630.32 - 2634.76] I honestly haven't read like the last
[2632.72 - 2637.44] three probably if I'm being really
[2634.76 - 2640.28] honest
[2637.44 - 2643.04] she honestly hasn't read like the last
[2640.28 - 2644.52] three books this was in 2020 in
[2643.04 - 2646.16] reference to when the cleanse to heal
[2644.52 - 2648.64] book was coming out so it was before
[2646.16 - 2651.32] medical medium revised and expanded and
[2648.64 - 2653.52] it was also before the brains saer books
[2651.32 - 2656.44] that means Ashley basically only
[2653.52 - 2659.56] supposedly read the first two out of
[2656.44 - 2661.80] what's now nine books Ashley didn't read
[2659.56 - 2663.96] thyroid healing Liver Rescue celery
[2661.80 - 2667.48] juice cleanse to heal medical medium
[2663.96 - 2669.48] revised brainsaver 1 or brain saver 2
[2667.48 - 2672.00] Ashley has hardly read any medical
[2669.48 - 2674.52] medium material and it shows which makes
[2672.00 - 2677.20] her far from an expert on medical medium
[2674.52 - 2678.68] information so how would Ashley know
[2677.20 - 2681.04] that Stephanie was following medical
[2678.68 - 2682.56] medium information to the letter or not
[2681.04 - 2683.96] if Ashley doesn't even know medical
[2682.56 - 2686.52] medium
[2683.96 - 2688.44] information what's even more insane is
[2686.52 - 2690.60] that there are more examples of Ashley
[2688.44 - 2693.52] telling multiple completely different
[2690.60 - 2695.92] contradictory versions of the same story
[2693.52 - 2698.48] the one I'm going to unpack now is one
[2695.92 - 2701.92] that Ashley has told nine different
[2698.48 - 2704.48] versions of would you trust someone who
[2701.92 - 2708.28] has nine different versions of the same
[2704.48 - 2710.64] story about something this one is jam
[2708.28 - 2712.52] packed with falsities and fiction so
[2710.64 - 2714.48] bear with us as we unload this pile of
[2712.52 - 2717.00] crap onto the public this is the
[2714.48 - 2720.24] infamous cat
[2717.00 - 2723.00] story Ashley's son was sick with a skin
[2720.24 - 2725.24] condition in 2018 he was a baby at the
[2723.00 - 2728.68] time and Ashley sought Anthony's help
[2725.24 - 2730.40] with it in 2019 a year later Ashley
[2728.68 - 2733.04] started publicly telling fake stories
[2730.40 - 2734.80] about this experience she's changed and
[2733.04 - 2737.96] adapted the story more and more with
[2734.80 - 2739.88] time in 2020 right after Ashley came out
[2737.96 - 2741.76] with her false story about Stephanie
[2739.88 - 2744.48] Ashley did a live stream and said that
[2741.76 - 2746.28] Anthony had gotten it wrong with her son
[2744.48 - 2748.84] because Anthony missed the fact that it
[2746.28 - 2750.24] was really a cat allergy that was behind
[2748.84 - 2752.56] his eczema
[2750.24 - 2755.40] outbreak this is a story that Ashley
[2752.56 - 2757.92] told me on my recorded calls with her as
[2755.40 - 2760.72] she was trying to convince me that is a
[2757.92 - 2763.20] liar it's a story that I later found out
[2760.72 - 2765.32] has been used many many times by Ashley
[2763.20 - 2767.40] to intentionally try to break people's
[2765.32 - 2768.76] trust and confidence in Anthony and in
[2767.40 - 2771.00] medical medium
[2768.76 - 2772.96] information most people who have turned
[2771.00 - 2775.36] against Anthony have heard it it's a
[2772.96 - 2780.52] story that Ashley is still telling to
[2775.36 - 2783.52] this day it's the cat story the cat
[2780.52 - 2786.60] story so as the real cat story was
[2783.52 - 2788.64] actually happening in real time in 2018
[2786.60 - 2790.68] there is is a documented record of
[2788.64 - 2793.80] Ashley telling the story correctly and
[2790.68 - 2795.76] consistently to four different people
[2793.80 - 2797.96] when Ashley's son was actively dealing
[2795.76 - 2800.48] with his eczema outbreak Ashley texted
[2797.96 - 2801.68] with Anthony Anthony's wife and two
[2800.48 - 2804.60] different friends about what was
[2801.68 - 2806.68] happening I have all the texts and these
[2804.60 - 2808.32] four truthful versions serve as a record
[2806.68 - 2811.24] for contrasting with all of the
[2808.32 - 2815.16] fabricated versions that Ashley has told
[2811.24 - 2817.64] since now since 2019 Ashley has told
[2815.16 - 2819.76] five false versions of the cat story
[2817.64 - 2821.28] that we are aware of and who knows how
[2819.76 - 2824.00] many other versions she's told that we
[2821.28 - 2826.12] haven't seen not only are these five
[2824.00 - 2827.64] versions false contradictory and
[2826.12 - 2829.68] different from the four truthful
[2827.64 - 2831.04] versions of the cat story from when it
[2829.68 - 2834.00] was happening in
[2831.04 - 2836.28] 2018 but they're also each different
[2834.00 - 2838.88] from each other and they contradict one
[2836.28 - 2840.80] another I'm going to first play one
[2838.88 - 2843.04] rendition of Ashley's fake version of
[2840.80 - 2845.96] the cat story which was told during her
[2843.04 - 2847.88] April 1st 2020 live stream we are
[2845.96 - 2849.92] redacting the name of Ashley's son for
[2847.88 - 2851.56] his privacy so every time you hear a
[2849.92 - 2854.28] bleep throughout the series it's someone
[2851.56 - 2856.52] saying Ashley's son's name or in one
[2854.28 - 2858.20] instance the name of another one of
[2856.52 - 2862.20] Ashley's
[2858.20 - 2864.08] children in regards to it's interesting
[2862.20 - 2867.08] I feel like it's another thing that just
[2864.08 - 2869.24] stood out to me as concerning um when
[2867.08 - 2872.36] got really bad eczema of course Anthony
[2869.24 - 2874.04] and I were really close and I had
[2872.36 - 2876.44] followed medical medium approach during
[2874.04 - 2879.08] pregnancy and so it was like holy cow
[2876.44 - 2883.44] what is going on of course I called
[2879.08 - 2886.52] Anthony about it and um we talked he
[2883.44 - 2889.20] changed my diet a lot uh well not a lot
[2886.52 - 2891.36] but he was very clear about like you
[2889.20 - 2893.36] need to cut out almost all fat except
[2891.36 - 2895.00] avocado from your diet I was doing like
[2893.36 - 2898.80] more of the cashews and the nuts and
[2895.00 - 2898.80] seeds and stuff
[2898.88 - 2905.20] um and so I did I I took that out of my
[2902.16 - 2908.40] diet and
[2905.20 - 2911.16] um and slowly started to get a little
[2908.40 - 2913.84] bit better over the course of the next 6
[2911.16 - 2916.28] months until he finally healed but the
[2913.84 - 2920.20] actual turning point in his healing came
[2916.28 - 2922.40] when we went to Hawaii and realized that
[2920.20 - 2924.36] he was severely allergic to cats cuz he
[2922.40 - 2926.56] was doing really well and then we
[2924.36 - 2930.76] changed airbnbs to an Airbnb where there
[2926.56 - 2932.72] was a cat and he started breaking out in
[2930.76 - 2935.20] eczema again like the following morning
[2932.72 - 2939.64] just like full body
[2935.20 - 2940.64] hives um and so we realized oh he has a
[2939.64 - 2943.20] cat
[2940.64 - 2945.52] allergy um and that was causing like the
[2943.20 - 2948.60] bulk of the problem and so I just find
[2945.52 - 2950.20] it curious that in talking to Anthony
[2948.60 - 2951.72] like why wouldn't he have mentioned like
[2950.20 - 2953.88] yes you can make all these dietary
[2951.72 - 2958.32] changes but also the fact that you got a
[2953.88 - 2960.88] cat four weeks ago is probably the real
[2958.32 - 2962.80] problem so Ashley was breastfeeding her
[2960.88 - 2964.84] baby during this time and what she was
[2962.80 - 2967.16] eating had the ability to impact her son
[2964.84 - 2969.36] through her breast milk Ashley is saying
[2967.16 - 2971.24] here that she was doing nuts and seeds
[2969.36 - 2974.16] and that Anthony had told her to cut out
[2971.24 - 2976.28] almost all fat except avocado she's
[2974.16 - 2978.40] saying that when she did that her son's
[2976.28 - 2981.56] eczema started to improve gradually
[2978.40 - 2984.00] until it healed completely but that she
[2981.56 - 2985.68] on her own realized that the actual
[2984.00 - 2988.28] turning point was when they were in an
[2985.68 - 2991.16] Airbnb in Hawaii with a cat in it and
[2988.28 - 2992.96] her baby broke out in eczema again
[2991.16 - 2995.52] Ashley is saying that she realized that
[2992.96 - 2997.16] he was reacting due to a cat allergy
[2995.52 - 3000.76] that Anthony had
[2997.16 - 3002.40] missed sounds convincing right if Ashley
[3000.76 - 3004.44] had reached out to you on Instagram like
[3002.40 - 3006.72] she's doing to many people tried to
[3004.44 - 3009.76] recruit you into her hateful group and
[3006.72 - 3011.52] told you the story what would you think
[3009.76 - 3013.76] why didn't Anthony catch that it was a
[3011.52 - 3015.72] cat allergy he's supposed to be able to
[3013.76 - 3018.28] do that he should have known that it was
[3015.72 - 3022.28] a cat allergy he's obviously not who he
[3018.28 - 3025.20] says he is well here's the real story of
[3022.28 - 3027.16] what actually happened from Anthony's
[3025.20 - 3029.12] text thread we know that Ashley baby
[3027.16 - 3031.48] started having an eczema Outbreak on
[3029.12 - 3033.60] June 19th of
[3031.48 - 3035.64] 2018 and then there's a text thread
[3033.60 - 3037.56] between Ashley and a friend from when
[3035.64 - 3041.44] her son was dealing with his eczema in
[3037.56 - 3044.36] real time on June 28th of 2018 the
[3041.44 - 3048.88] friend texted Ashley and said hey honey
[3044.36 - 3052.52] how are you how's the rash Ashley
[3048.88 - 3055.68] replied hey BB doing good here gearing
[3052.52 - 3058.44] up to head to Dallas tomorrow it's still
[3055.68 - 3061.96] pretty bad but but not getting worse I
[3058.44 - 3066.24] think it's actually starting to scab
[3061.96 - 3067.72] up the friend said a poor little Dallas
[3066.24 - 3070.44] will hopefully be
[3067.72 - 3072.92] nice Ashley sent a photo of her baby's
[3070.44 - 3075.88] eczema and said
[3072.92 - 3078.52] this I talked to Aunt and he said it's
[3075.88 - 3081.96] most likely the
[3078.52 - 3086.12] cat okay we have to pause here this is
[3081.96 - 3089.88] the Smoking Gun Ashley texted her friend
[3086.12 - 3092.96] saying Anthony told her it's most likely
[3089.88 - 3096.12] the cat whereas in the 2020 version of
[3092.96 - 3097.60] the story Ashley said she herself
[3096.12 - 3100.48] discovered that the cat was causing her
[3097.60 - 3104.40] baby skin problems and that Anthony had
[3100.48 - 3108.52] missed it here it is again the 2020
[3104.40 - 3109.76] version um and so we realized oh he has
[3108.52 - 3112.36] a cat
[3109.76 - 3114.64] allergy um and that was causing like the
[3112.36 - 3117.96] bulk of the problem and so I just find
[3114.64 - 3119.48] it curious that in talking Anthony like
[3117.96 - 3121.64] why wouldn't he have mentioned like yes
[3119.48 - 3123.20] you can make all these dietary changes
[3121.64 - 3127.64] but also the fact that you got a cat
[3123.20 - 3127.64] four weeks ago is probably the real
[3128.16 - 3134.56] problem versus what actually happened
[3131.24 - 3136.80] according to Ashley's own text messages
[3134.56 - 3139.76] from
[3136.80 - 3142.56] 2018 I talked to Aunt and he said it's
[3139.76 - 3147.48] most likely the
[3142.56 - 3149.20] cat Ashley Foster is a liar
[3147.48 - 3153.28] there you have it right out of the
[3149.20 - 3154.80] horse's mouth Ashley's own words proving
[3153.28 - 3157.64] that she
[3154.80 - 3160.68] lied now we can
[3157.64 - 3163.68] continue I talked to Aunt and he said
[3160.68 - 3166.64] it's most likely the cat cat has been
[3163.68 - 3169.36] gone 4 days but I'm sure there's still a
[3166.64 - 3171.88] lot here so Dallas might actually help
[3169.36 - 3176.40] it heal up further well I mean liver
[3171.88 - 3176.40] issues but the cat as you know
[3176.60 - 3181.36] the friend said a the poor baby so did
[3179.48 - 3184.88] you give the cat away or just having a
[3181.36 - 3187.32] break from it and Ashley
[3184.88 - 3190.36] replied we gave it to our friends who
[3187.32 - 3192.92] wanted it really badly I really love
[3190.36 - 3196.44] having a pet around but they create so
[3192.92 - 3198.88] much mess and our home just feels so
[3196.44 - 3202.44] clean
[3198.88 - 3204.96] now Ashley Sayang in these text messages
[3202.44 - 3207.64] that Anthony told her that her son's
[3204.96 - 3210.88] eczema outbreak was due to liver issues
[3207.64 - 3214.68] plus the cat Ashley also says that they
[3210.88 - 3217.00] gave the cat away on June 24th of 2018
[3214.68 - 3220.32] this is 4 months before the Hawaii
[3217.00 - 3223.00] Retreat remember that in the fake story
[3220.32 - 3225.56] she told in 2020 Ashley said it wasn't
[3223.00 - 3227.56] until the Hawaii Retreat that she
[3225.56 - 3230.64] realized that cats affected her son's
[3227.56 - 3233.24] skin condition but in reality Ashley had
[3230.64 - 3236.00] already given their pet cat away 4
[3233.24 - 3238.00] months before the Hawaii Retreat even
[3236.00 - 3241.44] took place
[3238.00 - 3245.68] again Ashley Foster is a
[3241.44 - 3247.92] liar then on July 14th of 2018 Ashley
[3245.68 - 3251.84] texted the same
[3247.92 - 3255.64] friend poor little is so bad it's
[3251.84 - 3259.12] breaking my heart anything I can do I'm
[3255.64 - 3262.88] drinking celery juice nettle tea off all
[3259.12 - 3266.40] green and oil and very low fat is
[3262.88 - 3270.96] getting little sips of celery juice too
[3266.40 - 3270.96] I'm taking zinc and vitamin C in high
[3271.72 - 3277.72] quantities the friend said poor baby is
[3275.20 - 3282.56] this worse than he was at the
[3277.72 - 3285.88] start h no it was worse at one
[3282.56 - 3288.04] point the friend asks it's been ebbing
[3285.88 - 3290.00] and flowing then or just gotten a little
[3288.04 - 3293.92] better and not gone up and
[3290.00 - 3296.64] down Ashley says that's sort of what
[3293.92 - 3298.92] it's done
[3296.64 - 3302.24] the friend replies well that's normal
[3298.92 - 3303.88] for a rash at least a bad one anyway it
[3302.24 - 3305.96] could still just be that his immune
[3303.88 - 3307.84] system is weakened still from the cat
[3305.96 - 3310.20] and the allergic reaction and it will
[3307.84 - 3312.16] get better soon if it's not worse right
[3310.20 - 3316.24] now that's a good sign are you drinking
[3312.16 - 3319.64] a lot of OJ and Ashley
[3316.24 - 3321.24] says no yeah it isn't continuing to get
[3319.64 - 3324.32] worse at
[3321.24 - 3327.32] least just slower to Cal down than I
[3324.32 - 3329.84] thought
[3327.32 - 3332.40] Anthony had told Ashley already that the
[3329.84 - 3334.44] cat was a trigger for her son and Ashley
[3332.40 - 3335.84] had gotten rid of the cat nearly a month
[3334.44 - 3338.28] prior to this
[3335.84 - 3340.40] conversation as you can see everyone
[3338.28 - 3342.88] Ashley spoke to was well aware that the
[3340.40 - 3345.16] cat was a trigger because as Ashley said
[3342.88 - 3347.44] in her own text messages that was
[3345.16 - 3351.04] something Anthony had told her from the
[3347.44 - 3356.92] beginning on August 15th of 2018 the
[3351.04 - 3359.60] same friend asked how and Ashley replied
[3356.92 - 3361.88] he's not great pal but I'm trying to be
[3359.60 - 3364.36] patient we're having our whole house
[3361.88 - 3367.20] cleaned top to bottom this weekend
[3364.36 - 3370.84] including all furniture in our HVAC
[3367.20 - 3373.12] system it still hasn't been as bad as at
[3370.84 - 3373.12] its
[3373.24 - 3379.96] worst the friend says a poor little
[3377.20 - 3382.60] guy keep the date that Ashley got her
[3379.96 - 3384.72] house and HVAC system cleaned in mind
[3382.60 - 3387.40] for later August
[3384.72 - 3391.20] 15th in Aver ation that took place a
[3387.40 - 3393.08] month later on September 19th of 2018
[3391.20 - 3396.44] Ashley says
[3393.08 - 3398.40] this still dealing with skin but I spoke
[3396.44 - 3401.04] with Aunt and he got us on the right
[3398.40 - 3404.16] track I think we'll be through it in the
[3401.04 - 3407.04] next few weeks I was having very little
[3404.16 - 3409.88] fat like maybe one tablespoon of cashews
[3407.04 - 3413.80] a day but it turns out it's not the fat
[3409.88 - 3415.68] itself it's the nuts he actually said
[3413.80 - 3419.32] like olive oil would be better than
[3415.68 - 3422.88] cashews in terms of helping heal so I
[3419.32 - 3426.20] got completely off and he not seeds he
[3422.88 - 3428.92] seems like he's starting to come through
[3426.20 - 3431.12] it so now we're getting into what was
[3428.92 - 3435.08] happening with the fats the friend
[3431.12 - 3437.52] responded I'm thrilled about yippe keep
[3435.08 - 3440.56] me posted on his continued healing been
[3437.52 - 3442.80] praying for him next we're going to read
[3440.56 - 3445.24] off a series of texts Ashley sent to a
[3442.80 - 3446.72] different friend also in mid-september
[3445.24 - 3448.92] of 2018
[3446.72 - 3451.48] telling the true story consistent with
[3448.92 - 3453.60] the last text thread we just read off of
[3451.48 - 3455.96] what Ashley had discussed with Anthony
[3453.60 - 3459.56] about her son
[3455.96 - 3463.92] skin nothing crazy but he set to give a
[3459.56 - 3465.92] little vitamin c 200 milligrams per day
[3463.92 - 3469.16] and that I shouldn't be eating any nuts
[3465.92 - 3472.88] or seeds he actually said olive oil is
[3469.16 - 3476.52] fine but no nuts or seeds because of the
[3472.88 - 3477.87] Arginine and then he said lots of squash
[3476.52 - 3479.84] and green juices for
[3477.87 - 3483.24] [Music]
[3479.84 - 3486.48] me if you remember in the fabricated cat
[3483.24 - 3488.24] story Ashley told in 2020 Ashley said
[3486.48 - 3490.72] the real turning point was when she
[3488.24 - 3493.56] realized her son had a cat allergy while
[3490.72 - 3496.12] they were in Hawaii with a cat in their
[3493.56 - 3498.48] Airbnb in the real story of what
[3496.12 - 3500.48] actually happened the true turning point
[3498.48 - 3503.68] was when Ashley listened to Anthony's
[3500.48 - 3506.48] guidance to cut out nuts and seeds when
[3503.68 - 3509.88] she realized it was not the fat that was
[3506.48 - 3512.20] the problem it was the nuts and seeds
[3509.88 - 3514.84] specifically when Ashley cut those out
[3512.20 - 3517.04] as she said in her own words her son
[3514.84 - 3520.04] started to turn the corner and get
[3517.04 - 3523.12] better and then from October 15th
[3520.04 - 3525.80] through October 21st of 2018 Ashley
[3523.12 - 3527.48] hosted a retreat in Hawaii this is the
[3525.80 - 3530.16] retreat that took place right before
[3527.48 - 3532.24] Stephanie passed away I've spoken to
[3530.16 - 3533.88] individuals who were at this Retreat one
[3532.24 - 3535.76] of them shared with me first of all that
[3533.88 - 3538.92] there was not a cat in any of Ashley's
[3535.76 - 3540.76] air bnbs only an outdoor cat around one
[3538.92 - 3543.20] of the airbnbs that was not allowed
[3540.76 - 3544.80] inside this person also shared with us
[3543.20 - 3547.20] that at the retreat Ashley started
[3544.80 - 3549.60] eating nuts again and that is the real
[3547.20 - 3552.64] reason why her son's skin flared up
[3549.60 - 3555.20] again I have a copy of the menu Ashley
[3552.64 - 3557.56] created for the retreat and it has nuts
[3555.20 - 3560.00] in at least one of the meals for almost
[3557.56 - 3562.24] every single day of the
[3560.00 - 3564.52] retreat here are some examples from the
[3562.24 - 3566.64] menu we've got a chopped salad with
[3564.52 - 3569.96] Branch dressing which included Vil and
[3566.64 - 3572.28] cashew nuts a taco bar with cashew cream
[3569.96 - 3574.80] which is basically all cashew there was
[3572.28 - 3578.40] a cashew curry sauce which is basically
[3574.80 - 3580.56] all cashew as well there was a pasta
[3578.40 - 3582.76] with cashew butter in the sauce There
[3580.56 - 3584.96] was a macadamia nut parmesan which is
[3582.76 - 3587.40] basically entirely made from macadamia
[3584.96 - 3589.48] nuts there were potato pancakes with a
[3587.40 - 3592.44] roasted garlic cream sauce which is
[3589.48 - 3594.48] basically all cashew again there was a
[3592.44 - 3596.04] pad tie with almond butter in it there
[3594.48 - 3598.60] were sweet potato fries with a Sal
[3596.04 - 3601.24] lantro lime Crea which is basically all
[3598.60 - 3603.56] cashew there was a horseradish sauce
[3601.24 - 3605.60] which included a lot of cashews there
[3603.56 - 3609.24] was also an option for almond butter
[3605.60 - 3612.56] sauce on Collard wraps this was a menu
[3609.24 - 3614.12] again that Ashley created herself and
[3612.56 - 3616.20] there are individuals who witnessed
[3614.12 - 3617.96] Ashley eating these dishes with nuts
[3616.20 - 3620.24] throughout the course of the
[3617.96 - 3622.60] retreat when Ashley returned from The
[3620.24 - 3625.00] Retreat she got off of nuts and seeds
[3622.60 - 3626.92] again and that is when her son's eczema
[3625.00 - 3628.24] cleared up for good
[3626.92 - 3631.04] again there are
[3628.24 - 3633.08] witnesses it is not possible that
[3631.04 - 3634.92] Ashley's son was still being affected by
[3633.08 - 3637.56] their household cat around the time of
[3634.92 - 3640.04] the October Retreat like Ashley said in
[3637.56 - 3642.20] her fabricated 2020 version of the cat
[3640.04 - 3644.72] story I'm going to walk through the
[3642.20 - 3646.40] facts of the timeline Ashley first
[3644.72 - 3648.24] texted Anthony's wife when she was
[3646.40 - 3652.32] thinking about getting the cat on June
[3648.24 - 3656.20] 7th of 2018 the text says
[3652.32 - 3659.04] this okay we're thinking of taking in
[3656.20 - 3661.00] our friends can possible to keep it on a
[3659.04 - 3663.40] vegan
[3661.00 - 3665.52] diet I have to put out a disclaimer
[3663.40 - 3667.32] first that Anthony has shared publicly
[3665.52 - 3669.48] that he does not recommend having cats
[3667.32 - 3671.68] on a vegan diet and Anthony's wife
[3669.48 - 3673.20] expressed this to Ashley at the time
[3671.68 - 3675.52] we're just reading this off to show that
[3673.20 - 3677.88] Ashley got the cat around this time in
[3675.52 - 3679.84] June and then the thread we read
[3677.88 - 3682.32] previously included Ashley confirming
[3679.84 - 3685.52] that she gave the cat away on June 24th
[3682.32 - 3687.36] of 2018 so between the time Ashley was
[3685.52 - 3689.88] cons considering taking the cat in on
[3687.36 - 3693.08] the 7th and the date she gave it away on
[3689.88 - 3698.32] the 24th Ashley only had the cat for a
[3693.08 - 3701.48] maximum of 18 days in June June 24th the
[3698.32 - 3704.56] day she gave the cat away is 4 months
[3701.48 - 3708.16] before Ashley was in Hawaii for her
[3704.56 - 3712.84] Retreat this alone makes Ashley's 2020
[3708.16 - 3715.32] fake version of the cat story entirely
[3712.84 - 3719.24] impossible but the actual turning point
[3715.32 - 3721.52] in his human came when we went to Hawaii
[3719.24 - 3723.60] and realized that he was severely
[3721.52 - 3726.20] allergic to cats cuz he was doing really
[3723.60 - 3730.16] well and then we changed airbnbs to an
[3726.20 - 3731.96] Airbnb where there was a cat and he
[3730.16 - 3733.60] started breaking out an eczema again
[3731.96 - 3736.52] like the following morning just like
[3733.60 - 3736.52] full body
[3736.72 - 3741.68] hives she claimed that she realized her
[3739.40 - 3743.40] son was allergic to cats because he was
[3741.68 - 3746.44] doing really well at first when they
[3743.40 - 3748.76] went to Hawaii in October of 2018
[3746.44 - 3751.48] and that it was because he got relief
[3748.76 - 3754.04] from the cat that they had at home but
[3751.48 - 3755.88] in reality the cat had already been gone
[3754.04 - 3758.80] for four
[3755.88 - 3761.72] months Ashley had sent this text on June
[3758.80 - 3766.00] 28th of
[3761.72 - 3768.24] 2018 CAD has been gone 4 days we gave it
[3766.00 - 3771.48] to our friends who wanted it really
[3768.24 - 3775.12] badly I really love having a pet around
[3771.48 - 3779.00] but they create so much mess and our
[3775.12 - 3779.00] home just feels feels so clean
[3779.04 - 3786.04] now I will say again that Ashley Foster
[3782.96 - 3788.48] is a liar the cat story she told
[3786.04 - 3790.92] publicly in 2020 was
[3788.48 - 3793.96] fabricated and she went on to tell more
[3790.92 - 3796.16] fabricated versions of it keep the facts
[3793.96 - 3799.12] and records of what really happened with
[3796.16 - 3801.60] Ashley's son his eczema and the cat in
[3799.12 - 3804.48] mind as I unpack several other
[3801.60 - 3806.84] fictitious cat story versions the facts
[3804.48 - 3809.32] are that Anthony did tell Ashley that
[3806.84 - 3811.80] the cat was a factor in her son's eczema
[3809.32 - 3814.52] he did not get it wrong or miss the cat
[3811.80 - 3818.32] allergy Ashley only had the cat for a
[3814.52 - 3820.92] maximum of 18 days and got rid of it 4
[3818.32 - 3823.16] months before the October Retreat
[3820.92 - 3826.16] Anthony only told Ashley to avoid nuts
[3823.16 - 3828.56] and seeds specifically her son's skin
[3826.16 - 3830.72] started improving when she implemented
[3828.56 - 3832.64] that and then his exzema flared up again
[3830.72 - 3835.76] in October because Ashley started eating
[3832.64 - 3837.88] nuts again at the retreat in Hawaii Ash
[3835.76 - 3840.24] as's son's eczema cleared up for good
[3837.88 - 3842.44] when Ashley got off of nuts and seeds
[3840.24 - 3844.00] again several months after she had
[3842.44 - 3845.96] already given the cat away and gotten
[3844.00 - 3848.16] her house deep
[3845.96 - 3850.64] cleaned when the plotters made their
[3848.16 - 3853.20] attempt to recruit me last year on a
[3850.64 - 3855.48] call that I legally recorded Ashley was
[3853.20 - 3858.76] trying really hard to convince me that
[3855.48 - 3860.76] Anthony is a liar and a fraud she told
[3858.76 - 3863.08] me a false version of the infamous cat
[3860.76 - 3865.16] story that was even more fabricated than
[3863.08 - 3867.92] the false version that we just played
[3865.16 - 3869.96] from her 2020 live stream I'm going to
[3867.92 - 3872.04] go through and actually count the number
[3869.96 - 3874.04] of falsities from the cat story she told
[3872.04 - 3875.92] me personally on the phone because there
[3874.04 - 3880.08] are so
[3875.92 - 3883.40] many um I then gave birth to my middle
[3880.08 - 3886.40] son and he got like full body eczema
[3883.40 - 3888.80] when he was born and I remember asking
[3886.40 - 3891.40] Anthony what to do what do I do about
[3888.80 - 3895.76] this I was a breastfeeding mom he put me
[3891.40 - 3898.16] on a fat-free raw diet um which I Stay
[3895.76 - 3898.16] gone for
[3898.24 - 3903.52] months we've got falsity number one in
[3901.72 - 3906.72] this version she says Anthony put her on
[3903.52 - 3909.04] a fat-free diet in previous version she
[3906.72 - 3912.56] had said Anthony told her avocado and
[3909.04 - 3915.36] olive oil were okay in reality he said
[3912.56 - 3918.76] nuts and seeds specifically were the
[3915.36 - 3921.32] problem not fats as a whole falsity
[3918.76 - 3924.08] number two Ashley added here that he
[3921.32 - 3926.64] told her to eat raw food only this is
[3924.08 - 3928.48] the only one of nine versions of the cat
[3926.64 - 3930.84] story in which she mentioned this and it
[3928.48 - 3933.16] is not true in one of the text threads
[3930.84 - 3934.96] we just read from Ashley told a friend
[3933.16 - 3937.24] while the outbreak was happening in real
[3934.96 - 3939.36] time that Anthony had suggested for her
[3937.24 - 3942.88] to eat lots of squashes and said that
[3939.36 - 3945.32] olive oil was okay I'm positive Anthony
[3942.88 - 3948.00] that you did not mean for Ashley to only
[3945.32 - 3950.56] consume all of those squashes raw and to
[3948.00 - 3953.92] only have olive oil
[3950.56 - 3956.64] raw I did not tell Ashley to eat raw or
[3953.92 - 3958.64] to eat fat-free for her son's xema
[3956.64 - 3962.08] Ashley's flying
[3958.64 - 3963.76] again right and we've also got falsity
[3962.08 - 3965.72] number three here with Ashley saying
[3963.76 - 3968.32] that she stayed raw and fat-free for
[3965.72 - 3970.04] months someone I've spoken to who knows
[3968.32 - 3972.56] Ashley witnessed her consuming both
[3970.04 - 3974.72] cooked food and fats during this time
[3972.56 - 3976.68] Ashley only cut out nuts and seeds for
[3974.72 - 3978.36] about one month and then at her Retreat
[3976.68 - 3981.12] she was eating nuts again as well as
[3978.36 - 3983.00] other fats and cooked food even during
[3981.12 - 3985.36] the one month that she cut out nuts and
[3983.00 - 3986.44] seeds Ashley was still eating other fats
[3985.36 - 3989.56] and cooked
[3986.44 - 3991.68] food there is a publicly available
[3989.56 - 3993.72] YouTube video that was submitted to us
[3991.68 - 3997.00] of a vegan get together that took place
[3993.72 - 4000.36] on August 14th of 2018 and the video
[3997.00 - 4002.52] stars Ashley this is just under two
[4000.36 - 4005.48] months after Ashley son broke out with
[4002.52 - 4008.84] eczema Ashley is shown in the video with
[4005.48 - 4011.36] a salad with avocado and cooked potato
[4008.84 - 4014.00] cakes with dollops of cashew aoli cream
[4011.36 - 4016.12] and avocado on top sitting next to her
[4014.00 - 4018.60] son and you can see his
[4016.12 - 4020.88] eczema a witness who was at the
[4018.60 - 4023.32] Gathering saw Ashley eating the salad
[4020.88 - 4025.88] with avocado and the cooked potato cakes
[4023.32 - 4028.76] with cashew aoli cream and avocado on
[4025.88 - 4031.08] top cashew aoli cream is very dense and
[4028.76 - 4032.84] takes a lot of cashews to make this is
[4031.08 - 4035.24] yet another piece of evidence to show
[4032.84 - 4038.56] that Ashley's claim of being on a raw
[4035.24 - 4041.36] fat-free diet is completely
[4038.56 - 4043.12] false during my call with Ashley she
[4041.36 - 4047.80] continued
[4043.12 - 4050.96] on um and he told me all this different
[4047.80 - 4053.88] stuff we had like a billion air
[4050.96 - 4056.52] purifiers this is falsity number four
[4053.88 - 4059.40] Ashley didn't have air purifiers until
[4056.52 - 4061.24] after her son's eczema had cleared up
[4059.40 - 4063.88] the air purifiers she got were four
[4061.24 - 4065.76] remediation from the Malibu fires they
[4063.88 - 4068.12] had nothing to do with the cat or her
[4065.76 - 4070.68] son's skin and it was during a different
[4068.12 - 4072.76] time period it's a whole other separate
[4070.68 - 4074.88] story which we're going to cover later
[4072.76 - 4076.52] that Ashley conflated with this false
[4074.88 - 4078.68] version of the cat story when she told
[4076.52 - 4082.68] it to
[4078.68 - 4084.92] me we I was not eating I mean I wasn't
[4082.68 - 4086.56] eating anything I was eating fruit and
[4084.92 - 4090.20] some
[4086.56 - 4092.48] greens falsity number five now Ashley's
[4090.20 - 4096.24] down to saying she wasn't even eating
[4092.48 - 4098.16] vegetables just fruit and greens that's
[4096.24 - 4101.00] how the number two plotter Ashley's
[4098.16 - 4103.24] friend Robbie Barbaro eats somehow it's
[4101.00 - 4106.24] not restrictive to her when he does
[4103.24 - 4108.00] it but there are witnesses who observed
[4106.24 - 4110.32] Ashley eating many foods other than
[4108.00 - 4113.04] fruit and greens during this time such
[4110.32 - 4114.88] as plenty of potatoes and beans in
[4113.04 - 4116.92] another version of this story Ashley
[4114.88 - 4119.56] said she was eating nuts and seeds up
[4116.92 - 4122.52] until a month before the retreat and as
[4119.56 - 4125.32] we covered she reintroduced nuts at The
[4122.52 - 4127.40] Retreat and at Ashley's Retreat there
[4125.32 - 4129.80] were plenty of vegetables on the menu
[4127.40 - 4133.68] that she created herself lots of
[4129.80 - 4136.48] potatoes radishes yams asparagus carrot
[4133.68 - 4138.84] red cabbage and more along with other
[4136.48 - 4142.52] foods like coconut ice cream kelp
[4138.84 - 4145.04] noodles raw honey maple syrup Wasabi
[4142.52 - 4146.52] aerrow root and much more than just
[4145.04 - 4148.84] fruit and
[4146.52 - 4150.36] greens furthermore in a different
[4148.84 - 4152.68] version of the cat story I'm going to
[4150.36 - 4154.96] share from Ashley later Ashley says in
[4152.68 - 4156.76] her own words that she was eating
[4154.96 - 4160.12] vegetables during this
[4156.76 - 4162.04] time obviously Ashley's purposely trying
[4160.12 - 4164.68] to make it look like Anthony put her on
[4162.04 - 4166.20] some kind of extremely restrictive diet
[4164.68 - 4167.96] which he did not
[4166.20 - 4169.96] by telling these falsities because she
[4167.96 - 4173.40] has to convince people somehow that
[4169.96 - 4176.40] Anthony's a bad guy or
[4173.40 - 4178.52] something and he kept saying like just
[4176.40 - 4180.88] keep going he's cleansing his liver is
[4178.52 - 4183.24] cleansing my hair was falling out my
[4180.88 - 4183.24] nails are
[4183.84 - 4189.12] breaking oh the drama there's so much
[4187.64 - 4191.76] that's wrong with this part of her fake
[4189.12 - 4194.36] story from the false he's just cleansing
[4191.76 - 4196.16] narrative to her false Health claims
[4194.36 - 4198.56] that we're going to be packing further
[4196.16 - 4201.12] in another episode for now I'm just
[4198.56 - 4204.00] going to stick to the main falsities
[4201.12 - 4206.20] falsity number six here Ashley's
[4204.00 - 4208.44] omitting the fact that her son's skin
[4206.20 - 4210.96] did clear up after she made the dietary
[4208.44 - 4212.76] changes Anthony suggested she's doing
[4210.96 - 4215.76] this to make it sound like what Anthony
[4212.76 - 4219.04] suggested wasn't working while it was so
[4215.76 - 4221.04] restrictive that it was harming her in
[4219.04 - 4223.20] reality Ashley took some time to
[4221.04 - 4226.04] implement what Anthony had suggested
[4223.20 - 4229.08] which was to Simply remove nuts and
[4226.04 - 4231.08] seeds and as you guys heard in her own
[4229.08 - 4233.40] text messages from the true version of
[4231.08 - 4236.28] the cat story Ashley said that once she
[4233.40 - 4239.76] did that her son's skin started clearing
[4236.28 - 4241.92] up and falsity number seven Ashley was
[4239.76 - 4243.56] dealing with pre-existing symptoms and
[4241.92 - 4245.40] conditions before she ever started
[4243.56 - 4248.44] applying medical medium information
[4245.40 - 4250.68] including hair loss and there is plenty
[4248.44 - 4253.80] of evidence of that that Ashley maybe
[4250.68 - 4255.56] doesn't remember I mean it's got to be a
[4253.80 - 4257.28] full-time job at this point for her to
[4255.56 - 4260.00] keep her lies straight when she's being
[4257.28 - 4262.64] so obscenely dishonest all over the
[4260.00 - 4264.84] place these pre-existing symptoms like
[4262.64 - 4266.64] hair loss however presented long before
[4264.84 - 4270.08] Ashley was recommended by Anthony to
[4266.64 - 4274.48] remove nuts and seeds for the one month
[4270.08 - 4276.36] or so that she actually did in total so
[4274.48 - 4279.08] restrictive I
[4276.36 - 4280.92] know in fact in one of the ebooks that
[4279.08 - 4283.76] Ashley had sold to the medical medium
[4280.92 - 4285.76] Community years ago Ashley wrote this
[4283.76 - 4287.64] about what was going on with her health
[4285.76 - 4289.96] during the time that she gave birth to
[4287.64 - 4293.12] her other child that she had before her
[4289.96 - 4293.12] son who had the eczema
[4293.40 - 4300.40] outbreak after was born my health
[4297.00 - 4305.16] crashed even more severely my depression
[4300.40 - 4308.28] became so intense magnified 100 times
[4305.16 - 4312.56] getting out of bed felt impossible and
[4308.28 - 4316.20] at times it was my hair fell out my skin
[4312.56 - 4319.88] grew dull and pale I felt horrible in my
[4316.20 - 4323.92] own body and for a brief period I even
[4319.88 - 4327.32] battle thoughts of suicide I weighed 185
[4323.92 - 4331.00] lbs and my entire body seemed to Sag in
[4327.32 - 4333.76] the aftermath of creating new life at 6
[4331.00 - 4335.88] months postpartum I found help from
[4333.76 - 4338.36] Anthony William who wrote the book
[4335.88 - 4338.36] medical
[4338.88 - 4344.52] Medium as you can see from Ashley's own
[4342.32 - 4346.00] testimony of her healing Journey from
[4344.52 - 4347.44] before she got mad at Anthony and
[4346.00 - 4350.16] started telling these fake stories and
[4347.44 - 4352.32] trying to rewrite history Ashley's hair
[4350.16 - 4355.68] loss was happening after she had her
[4352.32 - 4357.96] first baby which was six months before
[4355.68 - 4359.80] she ever interacted with Anthony or his
[4357.96 - 4362.96] information in the first
[4359.80 - 4365.48] place Ashley's using this falsity as a
[4362.96 - 4367.40] tactic to mess with other women's heads
[4365.48 - 4369.68] it's a great way to scare women who are
[4367.40 - 4372.52] applying medical medium information
[4369.68 - 4373.80] women do not want to lose their hair or
[4372.52 - 4375.68] the health of their
[4373.80 - 4377.44] nails yeah
[4375.68 - 4380.24] and that's real
[4377.44 - 4382.88] fear-mongering somebody who has to twist
[4380.24 - 4384.88] stories like this in order to try to
[4382.88 - 4387.04] scare and mess with the heads of women
[4384.88 - 4389.72] who are already struggling to serve
[4387.04 - 4392.08] their own agenda is clearly someone who
[4389.72 - 4393.52] is operating from a place of malice and
[4392.08 - 4396.28] not from a place of
[4393.52 - 4398.64] Sanity during our call Ashley continued
[4396.28 - 4402.36] to tell me this fake cat
[4398.64 - 4405.32] story um we went to Hawaii actually with
[4402.36 - 4406.84] Taylor to do a retreat with Taylor
[4405.32 - 4408.80] while we were there we were staying at
[4406.84 - 4410.60] an Airbnb with a cat and halfway through
[4408.80 - 4414.08] the retreat we moved to an Airbnb
[4410.60 - 4416.84] without a cat we also had a cat um when
[4414.08 - 4418.84] we moved to the Airbnb without a cat my
[4416.84 - 4421.88] son's exema went away within like the
[4418.84 - 4424.56] three days that we were there falsity
[4421.88 - 4426.88] number eight what's funny is that this
[4424.56 - 4429.68] is the opposite from other versions of
[4426.88 - 4431.84] the false story that Ashley's told in
[4429.68 - 4434.60] another false version Ashley said that
[4431.84 - 4437.24] the cat was in the second Airbnb and now
[4434.60 - 4440.36] she's say that the cat was in the first
[4437.24 - 4442.40] Airbnb as we stated previously a witness
[4440.36 - 4444.56] who was at the retreat said that there
[4442.40 - 4445.92] was actually not a cat in either of
[4444.56 - 4448.96] Ashley's
[4445.92 - 4450.72] airbnbs falsity number nine in this
[4448.96 - 4453.00] version Ashley's claiming that her son's
[4450.72 - 4456.24] eczema went away within 3 days while
[4453.00 - 4459.44] they were in Hawaii in the real story
[4456.24 - 4461.28] from Ashley's own text messages remember
[4459.44 - 4464.48] that her son's eczema actually started
[4461.28 - 4467.36] clearing up 1 month before the Hawaii
[4464.48 - 4468.88] retreat in October Ashley's son's eczema
[4467.36 - 4471.04] flared up again while they were in
[4468.88 - 4472.32] Hawaii because Ashley started eating
[4471.04 - 4475.24] nuts
[4472.32 - 4478.36] again so we got home we gave the cat to
[4475.24 - 4480.32] a friend we had our um air conditioning
[4478.36 - 4482.20] unit claimed his eczema went away and it
[4480.32 - 4485.84] never came
[4482.20 - 4487.64] back falsity number 10 if you remember
[4485.84 - 4489.64] back to one of the text threads we read
[4487.64 - 4492.80] from Ashley's real version of the cat
[4489.64 - 4496.40] story sent to a friend on August 15th of
[4492.80 - 4498.48] 2018 Ashley said this
[4496.40 - 4500.72] we're having our whole house cleaned top
[4498.48 - 4504.64] to bottom this weekend including all
[4500.72 - 4504.64] furniture and our HVAC
[4504.84 - 4510.28] system in fact Ashley had her air
[4508.32 - 4514.28] conditioning unit cleaned the weekend of
[4510.28 - 4517.56] August 17th which was 2 months before
[4514.28 - 4520.36] the Hawaii Retreat not after the Hawaii
[4517.56 - 4523.32] Retreat and that concludes this version
[4520.36 - 4525.92] of the cat story leaving us with 10
[4523.32 - 4528.12] total falsities in just one one of the
[4525.92 - 4531.64] multiple fictitious versions that Ashley
[4528.12 - 4534.00] has told of this cat story Ashley has
[4531.64 - 4536.80] adapted the infamous cat story more and
[4534.00 - 4539.04] more with time right after we released
[4536.80 - 4540.84] the first podcast about the plotters a
[4539.04 - 4542.68] lot of people were shocked to figure out
[4540.84 - 4544.72] that Ashley was behind this attack on
[4542.68 - 4546.76] Anthony and the community because they
[4544.72 - 4548.96] remembered how much Ashley has said in
[4546.76 - 4551.96] previous years about how Anthony has
[4548.96 - 4553.72] helped her and her family one woman
[4551.96 - 4555.32] recounted what she had seen in a
[4553.72 - 4557.00] Facebook group that she was in with
[4555.32 - 4559.84] Ashley during the time of her son's
[4557.00 - 4564.28] eczema problem in a comment thread from
[4559.84 - 4566.48] April 20th of 2023 the woman said aw
[4564.28 - 4568.76] helped Ash's baby recover from pretty
[4566.48 - 4571.32] severe eczema I don't know if Ash had
[4568.76 - 4573.36] issues herself or just her baby I
[4571.32 - 4576.28] remember seeing before and after
[4573.36 - 4578.76] piic Ashley replied with another version
[4576.28 - 4582.08] of her fake cat
[4578.76 - 4585.44] story respectfully can't let these
[4582.08 - 4588.88] inaccuracies go un addressed and Anthony
[4585.44 - 4591.24] did not cure my son's eczema he told me
[4588.88 - 4593.88] to go on a fat-free diet as a
[4591.24 - 4597.24] breastfeeding postpartum mom he
[4593.88 - 4600.36] recommended it for months and months and
[4597.24 - 4602.72] months he specifically told me that I
[4600.36 - 4606.00] just needed to keep going to detox to
[4602.72 - 4608.52] help my son we went on a trip and
[4606.00 - 4611.68] realized that my son was allergic to
[4608.52 - 4615.20] cats we came back and gave our cat to a
[4611.68 - 4618.48] dear friend my son's eczema went away
[4615.20 - 4620.64] within the week and has never come back
[4618.48 - 4623.28] I however have suffered incredible
[4620.64 - 4627.00] depletion from being on such restrictive
[4623.28 - 4629.44] diet for so long I went on to have two
[4627.00 - 4631.52] miscarriages while continuing to follow
[4629.44 - 4635.24] Anthony's
[4631.52 - 4638.44] advice wow this false version is even
[4635.24 - 4640.36] more extreme than the last Ashley has a
[4638.44 - 4642.92] pattern of escalating the severity of
[4640.36 - 4644.44] her fake stories over time presumably
[4642.92 - 4645.44] after not getting enough of a rise out
[4644.44 - 4647.96] of people
[4645.44 - 4650.08] initially here Ashley's telling the same
[4647.96 - 4652.48] falsities about Anthony missing the cat
[4650.08 - 4655.68] allergy and that Anthony had told her to
[4652.48 - 4658.40] go on a fat-free diet this time she says
[4655.68 - 4660.96] for months and months and
[4658.40 - 4663.36] months Ashley also told the same
[4660.96 - 4666.32] falsities about how Anthony told her to
[4663.36 - 4668.40] just keep going to detox her son that
[4666.32 - 4670.52] she herself discovered the cat allergy
[4668.40 - 4672.64] at The Retreat that they gave the cat
[4670.52 - 4675.52] away after the retreat and that her
[4672.64 - 4676.88] son's eczema cleared after the retreat
[4675.52 - 4679.60] none of which is
[4676.88 - 4681.88] accurate now she's added in outrageous
[4679.60 - 4683.80] Health claims to imply that not only
[4681.88 - 4685.92] Anthony got the cause of her son's skin
[4683.80 - 4687.92] problem wrong but also that his
[4685.92 - 4691.72] recommendations were restrictive and
[4687.92 - 4694.28] caused her harm she says that she quote
[4691.72 - 4697.56] suffered incredible depletion from being
[4694.28 - 4699.84] on such a restrictive diet for so long
[4697.56 - 4702.00] all of this is
[4699.84 - 4703.72] inaccurate again we're going to be
[4702.00 - 4705.60] thoroughly addressing Ashley's
[4703.72 - 4708.32] outrageous Health claims in other
[4705.60 - 4710.76] episodes for now I'm going to share the
[4708.32 - 4712.16] text message that Ashley sent to Anthony
[4710.76 - 4713.60] when she reached out to him for help
[4712.16 - 4717.20] with her baby's
[4713.60 - 4720.36] eczema sweet is pretty miserable still
[4717.20 - 4723.96] an I'm doing the basic things I can do
[4720.36 - 4728.12] while breastfeeding celery juice low fat
[4723.96 - 4731.28] green free zinc vitamin C he's getting a
[4728.12 - 4735.28] little celery juice too any other
[4731.28 - 4737.72] thoughts for me poor little bugs seem so
[4735.28 - 4740.00] miserable I'm willing to do something
[4737.72 - 4743.36] extreme like a melon juice and green
[4740.00 - 4745.76] juice fast or something but I don't want
[4743.36 - 4749.16] to detox and make him
[4745.76 - 4751.48] worse Ashley has made it clear over and
[4749.16 - 4754.32] over again that she's never understood
[4751.48 - 4756.92] medical medium information Anthony very
[4754.32 - 4760.04] much advises against things like melon
[4756.92 - 4762.28] juice and green juice fasts Ashley said
[4760.04 - 4765.16] herself here that she was willing to do
[4762.28 - 4769.04] something extreme to help her baby that
[4765.16 - 4771.44] was Ashley's input Ashley herself has a
[4769.04 - 4773.44] history of extreme dieting that existed
[4771.44 - 4776.76] long before she ever discovered medical
[4773.44 - 4779.08] medium information in a post Ashley made
[4776.76 - 4781.04] years ago to promote one of her ebooks
[4779.08 - 4783.52] Ashley shared a photo of herself in a
[4781.04 - 4785.00] wedding dress appearing very thin and
[4783.52 - 4787.96] she said
[4785.00 - 4790.84] this I was thin before my first
[4787.96 - 4794.12] pregnancy but it wasn't a healthy calm
[4790.84 - 4797.16] thin I used juice and water fasting to
[4794.12 - 4800.28] control my weight and it swung wildly
[4797.16 - 4802.92] all over the place even at times when I
[4800.28 - 4805.52] was thin I experienced a lot of mental
[4802.92 - 4808.96] chaos around
[4805.52 - 4811.84] food Ashley's first pregnancy as I went
[4808.96 - 4814.60] through previously was before she ever
[4811.84 - 4817.28] connected with Anthony or medical medium
[4814.60 - 4820.28] information for her son's eczema Anthony
[4817.28 - 4822.44] said no to Ashley's suggestion of melon
[4820.28 - 4824.88] juice and green juice fasting and
[4822.44 - 4827.68] literally recommended for her to Simply
[4824.88 - 4831.04] remove nuts and seeds from her diet to
[4827.68 - 4833.12] help him millions of people with nut and
[4831.04 - 4835.84] Seed allergies live without them every
[4833.12 - 4838.24] day it's far from restrictive and nobody
[4835.84 - 4840.28] made her do it she was pleading for help
[4838.24 - 4843.28] from Anthony and again according to
[4840.28 - 4845.28] Ashley's own text messages from the true
[4843.28 - 4847.08] version of this story what Anthony
[4845.28 - 4849.92] suggested started clearing up her son's
[4847.08 - 4852.60] skin right away in the same comment
[4849.92 - 4856.16] thread from last year Ashley
[4852.60 - 4859.28] added for clarity sake AK you need to
[4856.16 - 4861.72] know that during that entire time we had
[4859.28 - 4864.08] the cat in our house while Anthony was
[4861.72 - 4866.96] calling me and doing check-ins with
[4864.08 - 4869.28] spirit and telling me that the eczema
[4866.96 - 4873.12] was just cleansing and I needed to keep
[4869.28 - 4875.48] on my restrictive diet weird that Spirit
[4873.12 - 4878.16] never mentioned the cat to him 6 months
[4875.48 - 4878.16] earlier
[4878.56 - 4886.28] right I mean is this a joke this is how
[4882.20 - 4888.84] dangerous Ashley is every single line of
[4886.28 - 4891.00] that comment is wrong this is a perfect
[4888.84 - 4893.72] example of blatant falsi Ashley is
[4891.00 - 4895.76] pedaling to damage Anthony to plant fear
[4893.72 - 4897.48] and doubt to deliberately try to
[4895.76 - 4899.36] convince people that Anthony doesn't
[4897.48 - 4901.72] have accurate information and that he's
[4899.36 - 4904.44] harming people and she's trying to break
[4901.72 - 4906.92] people's Faith she's a faith
[4904.44 - 4909.08] Buster here she's saying the cat was in
[4906.92 - 4911.84] her house the entire time Anthony was
[4909.08 - 4915.56] talking to her but Ashley got rid of the
[4911.84 - 4917.84] cat on June 24th of 2018
[4915.56 - 4919.76] this was 4 months before she's now
[4917.84 - 4922.80] claiming that she gave the cat
[4919.76 - 4924.60] away she said weird that Spirit never
[4922.80 - 4928.68] mentioned the cat to him six months
[4924.60 - 4930.76] earlier right this is false ridiculously
[4928.68 - 4934.04] false Anthony mentioned the cat as a
[4930.76 - 4936.16] trigger from day one but this is exactly
[4934.04 - 4938.60] how Ashley deceives and manipulates
[4936.16 - 4941.24] people she's trying to rewrite history
[4938.60 - 4944.32] here to create an entirely false
[4941.24 - 4947.40] narrative I don't care if people believe
[4944.32 - 4950.12] in my gift or not that's okay that comes
[4947.40 - 4952.20] with a territory since I was 4 years old
[4950.12 - 4955.24] but people should be able to make that
[4952.20 - 4958.68] choice for themselves without a falsity
[4955.24 - 4961.92] persuading them I did know about the cat
[4958.68 - 4964.64] and I told Ashley plain and
[4961.92 - 4966.24] simple as the comment thread goes on the
[4964.64 - 4968.24] woman who remembered that Anthony had
[4966.24 - 4970.64] helped Ashley's baby with eczema
[4968.24 - 4973.56] continued to question Ashley's false
[4970.64 - 4976.08] story she said did you have two babies
[4973.56 - 4977.00] with skin issues I pulled up my notes I
[4976.08 - 4980.44] have
[4977.00 - 4982.76] 414 pages of notes from our group found
[4980.44 - 4985.88] a convo between you and Mana about you
[4982.76 - 4988.64] getting a kitten and had a whole body
[4985.88 - 4991.84] rash a week after you got the kitten
[4988.64 - 4994.28] Mana suggested zinc and C for you not
[4991.84 - 4996.60] him you asked about the cat and she said
[4994.28 - 4998.84] yes totally about the
[4996.60 - 5001.08] cat the group that this woman is
[4998.84 - 5002.96] referring to was a Facebook group she's
[5001.08 - 5005.44] saying that another woman had suggested
[5002.96 - 5008.76] for Ashley to do vitamin C and zinc for
[5005.44 - 5010.60] her son's eczema Ashley implemented that
[5008.76 - 5012.60] and then Ashley texted a friend about
[5010.60 - 5016.48] her taking these supplements on July
[5012.60 - 5017.88] 14th of 2018 months before the Hawaii
[5016.48 - 5020.60] retreat in
[5017.88 - 5022.76] October Anthony and people in the
[5020.60 - 5024.92] medical medium Community all knew that
[5022.76 - 5026.84] the pet cat was part of the problem way
[5024.92 - 5029.76] before Ashley and her son stayed in the
[5026.84 - 5032.56] Airbnb that Ashley's trying to claim had
[5029.76 - 5036.28] a cat in it a woman who wasn't even
[5032.56 - 5038.20] involved had 400 and 14 pages of notes
[5036.28 - 5040.24] from the time that this was happening
[5038.20 - 5042.44] and she knew that Ashley's fake cat
[5040.24 - 5044.40] story on this thread wasn't adding up
[5042.44 - 5045.24] and was contradictory to the notes she
[5044.40 - 5048.16] had
[5045.24 - 5050.24] taken in the same comment thread Ashley
[5048.16 - 5053.36] tried to convince yet another person of
[5050.24 - 5054.52] her false cat story to this person she
[5053.36 - 5058.40] said
[5054.52 - 5061.40] this here's my experience my son had
[5058.40 - 5064.44] whole body eczema from a few weeks after
[5061.40 - 5066.52] getting a kitten until a week after
[5064.44 - 5069.60] giving it
[5066.52 - 5072.12] away I'm going to pause to note that
[5069.60 - 5074.96] Ashley's saying here that her son got
[5072.12 - 5078.32] the rash a few weeks after they got the
[5074.96 - 5081.08] kitten in another comment on the very
[5078.32 - 5083.68] same thread Ashley said to a different
[5081.08 - 5086.40] person that he had gotten the rash one
[5083.68 - 5088.08] week after they got the kitten the
[5086.40 - 5091.64] comment one
[5088.08 - 5095.92] version my son had whole body eczema
[5091.64 - 5098.96] from a few weeks after getting a kitten
[5095.92 - 5101.96] versus the comment to
[5098.96 - 5104.36] version we had a cat for a week when he
[5101.96 - 5104.36] got the
[5104.84 - 5110.24] rash which is it Ashley a few weeks or
[5108.12 - 5113.48] one week after getting the cat it can't
[5110.24 - 5115.00] be both this is getting embarrassing for
[5113.48 - 5117.56] the woman who said that she would never
[5115.00 - 5120.72] tell a lie and calls herself a truth
[5117.56 - 5122.32] teller Ashley continued on with her fake
[5120.72 - 5125.00] cat
[5122.32 - 5127.92] story The Way We realiz realized what
[5125.00 - 5131.92] was causing it is that we stayed in an
[5127.92 - 5135.44] Airbnb without a cat and he began to
[5131.92 - 5138.60] improve then we moved to an Airbnb with
[5135.44 - 5141.24] a cat and he declined the difference was
[5138.60 - 5144.76] rapid enough that we noticed got rid of
[5141.24 - 5147.16] the cat his severe whole body eczema
[5144.76 - 5151.36] that he had for six months of his life
[5147.16 - 5154.64] went away and never came back so that's
[5151.36 - 5157.80] my experience I feel like a broken Rec
[5154.64 - 5157.80] but that's all I have to
[5158.00 - 5163.00] share here we have a lot of the same
[5160.24 - 5165.84] falsities from other fictitious versions
[5163.00 - 5168.32] and in this version Ashley also again
[5165.84 - 5171.56] flipped the order of the Airbnb with a
[5168.32 - 5173.44] cat and the Airbnb without a cat
[5171.56 - 5176.48] Ashley's saying here that they had the
[5173.44 - 5178.48] cat for six months before giving it away
[5176.48 - 5181.48] which is really funny because the woman
[5178.48 - 5183.36] with 414 pages of notes from the
[5181.48 - 5185.68] Facebook group Ashley originally asked
[5183.36 - 5189.24] for help in called her out on that lie
[5185.68 - 5192.32] by commenting PS no mention in my notes
[5189.24 - 5195.00] that you had a cat for months just a
[5192.32 - 5197.44] week this woman is correct that Ashley
[5195.00 - 5199.40] did not have the cat for months as a
[5197.44 - 5201.96] reminder for everyone of the receipts
[5199.40 - 5204.64] and the timeline Ashley texted this to a
[5201.96 - 5208.68] friend on June
[5204.64 - 5211.48] 28th cat has been gone 4
[5208.68 - 5214.72] days which means that Ashley only had
[5211.48 - 5216.64] the cat for a maximum of 18 days after
[5214.72 - 5219.64] she texted about considering taking the
[5216.64 - 5222.04] cat in on June 7th we don't have a
[5219.64 - 5224.68] record of the exact date Ashley took the
[5222.04 - 5226.44] cat in after the 7th it very well could
[5224.68 - 5228.88] have only been a week before she gave it
[5226.44 - 5231.16] away on the 24th but she did not have it
[5228.88 - 5234.92] for longer than 18 days and she most
[5231.16 - 5237.96] certainly did not have it for 6 months
[5234.92 - 5240.36] Ashley Foster's lies are
[5237.96 - 5242.48] pathological it's also worth mentioning
[5240.36 - 5244.48] that Ashley interestingly deleted that
[5242.48 - 5246.88] whole entire post along with all of
[5244.48 - 5250.20] these comments a few short days after
[5246.88 - 5252.24] she posted them that's the end of this
[5250.20 - 5254.32] version of the cat story I hope your
[5252.24 - 5256.52] head isn't spinning too much yet because
[5254.32 - 5259.44] believe it or not there are still two
[5256.52 - 5261.60] more the next false version is Ashley's
[5259.44 - 5263.51] first ever public post about the
[5261.60 - 5264.80] infamous cat story from
[5263.51 - 5267.76] [Music]
[5264.80 - 5271.44] 2019 when started struggling with his
[5267.76 - 5274.20] rash we had no idea what was causing it
[5271.44 - 5276.40] but about a week later I started feeling
[5274.20 - 5279.56] it was the kitten we adopted for our
[5276.40 - 5282.08] daughter thankfully some friends of ours
[5279.56 - 5285.68] fell in love with sweet Wendell Kitty
[5282.08 - 5289.04] and adopted him he's so loved in their
[5285.68 - 5291.88] home but even after the cat left the
[5289.04 - 5295.24] reactions continued they got a little
[5291.88 - 5298.48] better maybe but it was so hard to tell
[5295.24 - 5298.48] because it kind of came in
[5299.12 - 5304.56] waves okay right here she's admitting
[5302.08 - 5306.52] that they got rid of the cat early on
[5304.56 - 5309.16] not months later and that it still
[5306.52 - 5310.72] didn't fix the problem which is true
[5309.16 - 5312.76] she's leaving out the fact that Anthony
[5310.72 - 5314.04] told her the cat was part of the problem
[5312.76 - 5316.40] and that that's when she made the
[5314.04 - 5318.72] decision to give the cat away she's
[5316.40 - 5320.64] acting like it was her own Discovery in
[5318.72 - 5322.96] other versions that she claimed the cat
[5320.64 - 5324.76] allergy was her own Discovery in she
[5322.96 - 5327.60] claimed she didn't make the discovery
[5324.76 - 5328.92] until going to Hawaii later on here
[5327.60 - 5331.72] she's claiming that she made the
[5328.92 - 5334.72] discovery essentially right away Ashley
[5331.72 - 5334.72] continues
[5335.60 - 5341.36] on the advice of medical medium I
[5337.92 - 5344.92] completely overh my diet and took out
[5341.36 - 5348.00] nuts seeds oils anything that could
[5344.92 - 5351.36] potentially be an irritant my diet
[5348.00 - 5353.56] consisted and still does of fruits and
[5351.36 - 5355.52] vegetables if you want to know more
[5353.56 - 5358.28] about what I eat you can check out my
[5355.52 - 5362.72] story highlights the diet change US
[5358.28 - 5365.88] helped so much and were a critical
[5362.72 - 5368.08] component Ash is admitting here at least
[5365.88 - 5370.20] that the dietary changes did help and
[5368.08 - 5372.20] were a critical component she's
[5370.20 - 5374.12] misrepresenting the dietary changes as
[5372.20 - 5377.28] if Anthony had advised her to cut out
[5374.12 - 5379.64] oils and only eat fruits and vegetables
[5377.28 - 5382.48] when in fact he said that olive oil was
[5379.64 - 5385.64] fine and simply told her to cut out nuts
[5382.48 - 5387.44] and seeds in this story version Ashley
[5385.64 - 5390.24] wasn't clear about the timeline of the
[5387.44 - 5392.48] dietary changes Ashley only implemented
[5390.24 - 5396.04] getting off nuts and seeds after
[5392.48 - 5398.28] September 18th in 2018 and that's when
[5396.04 - 5400.56] she started seeing results in her son it
[5398.28 - 5402.80] was only less than a month before she
[5400.56 - 5406.20] went to Hawaii and started eating nuts
[5402.80 - 5410.40] again then Ashley said
[5406.20 - 5413.04] this but our guy kept on reacting we had
[5410.40 - 5416.32] our whole house cleaned top to bottom
[5413.04 - 5418.80] including our air ducts that helped some
[5416.32 - 5421.24] but it still
[5418.80 - 5423.56] persisted now she's saying that her son
[5421.24 - 5424.56] kept reacting even after the dietary
[5423.56 - 5426.28] changes
[5424.56 - 5428.00] which is not what she said in other
[5426.28 - 5430.96] versions and doesn't even make sense in
[5428.00 - 5433.12] the context of the rest of this version
[5430.96 - 5435.60] Ashley's also admitting here that her
[5433.12 - 5437.88] air ducts were cleaned early on before
[5435.60 - 5440.04] the retreat and that that still didn't
[5437.88 - 5441.60] fix the problem which is true and
[5440.04 - 5443.32] contradicts what she said in other
[5441.60 - 5445.56] versions about getting the house
[5443.32 - 5448.16] including the air duct cleaned after the
[5445.56 - 5451.32] retreat she goes
[5448.16 - 5453.16] on it wasn't until we went to Hawaii
[5451.32 - 5456.32] that we found the final piece of the
[5453.16 - 5459.64] puzzle we stayed in an airbeam be that
[5456.32 - 5463.68] had a cat in it before we arrived and
[5459.64 - 5465.56] within hours broke out in hives all over
[5463.68 - 5468.52] his
[5465.56 - 5470.76] body here's where it gets absurd because
[5468.52 - 5473.92] this part makes no sense after what you
[5470.76 - 5476.00] just heard her say Ashley's deliberately
[5473.92 - 5478.24] leaving out so many things from this
[5476.00 - 5480.04] story she's leaving out the fact that
[5478.24 - 5482.60] Anthony told her that the cat was a
[5480.04 - 5484.16] trigger for her son's eczema and that
[5482.60 - 5486.96] that's when she decided to get rid of
[5484.16 - 5488.72] the pet cat in the first place she's
[5486.96 - 5491.12] leaving out the fact that she was off of
[5488.72 - 5492.72] nuts and seeds for less than a month and
[5491.12 - 5493.48] then she started eating nuts again at
[5492.72 - 5495.64] The
[5493.48 - 5497.80] Retreat she's leaving out the fact that
[5495.64 - 5500.92] the menu she created for her Hawaii
[5497.80 - 5502.56] retreat was full of nuts she's leaving
[5500.92 - 5504.56] out the fact that the real reason why
[5502.56 - 5507.60] her son broke out in eczema again in
[5504.56 - 5509.80] Hawaii was because of the nuts she
[5507.60 - 5512.32] reintroduced now Ashley's saying that
[5509.80 - 5514.96] there was a cat in the Airbnb before
[5512.32 - 5516.64] they arrived whereas other versions she
[5514.96 - 5520.12] always said there was a cat in the
[5516.64 - 5522.00] Airbnb while they were there Ashley also
[5520.12 - 5523.76] contradicted herself with this one by
[5522.00 - 5526.08] saying that the retreat cat was the
[5523.76 - 5528.28] missing piece acting like it was such a
[5526.08 - 5531.04] surprise when she said in the beginning
[5528.28 - 5533.32] of this same story version that she
[5531.04 - 5534.92] already knew their pet cat was a trigger
[5533.32 - 5537.08] and that's why they had given it away
[5534.92 - 5539.88] four months prior to the
[5537.08 - 5542.16] retreat and now we have the ninth and
[5539.88 - 5544.56] final version of Ashley's cat story
[5542.16 - 5548.44] which she is still weaving and twisting
[5544.56 - 5551.44] to this day Ashley posted this one right
[5548.44 - 5553.32] at the end of last year 2023 As She was
[5551.44 - 5557.24] rattling off a ridiculous list of
[5553.32 - 5560.56] reasons why Anthony is supposedly a
[5557.24 - 5564.32] liar um I have another one with my son's
[5560.56 - 5566.12] eczema where he kept telling me it was
[5564.32 - 5568.68] because I was eating too much fat I was
[5566.12 - 5574.36] a postpartum nursing mom eating like
[5568.68 - 5576.48] less than half an avocado a day um and
[5574.36 - 5578.40] you know he had me testing our house for
[5576.48 - 5580.56] mold and doing all this stuff and my son
[5578.40 - 5582.52] was allergic to our cat and we figured
[5580.56 - 5585.28] that out ourselves
[5582.52 - 5589.32] and so that was another one where I was
[5585.28 - 5589.32] like wait why why was he so
[5589.84 - 5595.44] wrong why was he so wrong my son was
[5593.16 - 5597.24] allergic to our cat and we figured that
[5595.44 - 5600.76] out
[5597.24 - 5605.00] ourselves versus what actually happened
[5600.76 - 5607.32] according to her own text messages
[5605.00 - 5609.96] I talked to Aunt and he said it's most
[5607.32 - 5609.96] likely the
[5610.32 - 5615.76] cat and she also said that he kept
[5613.52 - 5617.32] telling me it was because I was eating
[5615.76 - 5621.88] too much
[5617.32 - 5624.92] fat versus what actually
[5621.88 - 5626.88] happened still dealing with skin but I
[5624.92 - 5629.52] spoke with Aunt and he got us on the
[5626.88 - 5632.56] right track I think we'll be through it
[5629.52 - 5635.36] in the next few weeks I was having very
[5632.56 - 5638.24] little fat like maybe one tablespoon of
[5635.36 - 5641.76] cashews a day but it turns out it's not
[5638.24 - 5644.52] the fat itself it's the nuts he actually
[5641.76 - 5647.28] said like olive oil would be better than
[5644.52 - 5650.48] cashews in terms of helping
[5647.28 - 5651.16] heal it turns out it's not the fat it's
[5650.48 - 5654.84] the
[5651.16 - 5657.76] nuts as you can see Ashley Foster is a
[5654.84 - 5660.20] liar who lies about lying while accusing
[5657.76 - 5662.24] Anthony of being a liar as she's lying
[5660.20 - 5665.24] and has told nine different
[5662.24 - 5667.88] contradictory versions of the the same
[5665.24 - 5670.08] story yet another contradiction is that
[5667.88 - 5672.12] in one of these virgins Ashley claimed
[5670.08 - 5674.36] that her only fat Source each day was
[5672.12 - 5676.08] avocado and in the other version she
[5674.36 - 5678.84] claimed that her only fat Source each
[5676.08 - 5681.88] day was cashews these two things cannot
[5678.84 - 5684.24] be true at the same time and in this
[5681.88 - 5686.00] most recent version Ashley also added in
[5684.24 - 5689.48] for the first time the claim that
[5686.00 - 5691.92] Anthony had her quote testing for mold
[5689.48 - 5695.04] and all this stuff which is just
[5691.92 - 5697.44] blatantly not true that is completely
[5695.04 - 5700.52] false and it's very telling that she's
[5697.44 - 5702.68] only adding that on now years and years
[5700.52 - 5705.00] after she started telling this story
[5702.68 - 5707.24] Ashley likes to try to play to people's
[5705.00 - 5710.56] emotions because many people are
[5707.24 - 5712.64] concerned about mold I never told Ashley
[5710.56 - 5714.72] to test for mold in her multi-million
[5712.64 - 5718.36] dollar Malibu
[5714.72 - 5720.36] mansion furthermore in only one of the
[5718.36 - 5722.16] previous false versions of the cat story
[5720.36 - 5724.84] we went through Ashley mentioned air
[5722.16 - 5728.52] purifiers
[5724.84 - 5732.08] um and he told me all this different
[5728.52 - 5734.36] stuff we had like a billion air
[5732.08 - 5736.68] purifiers Ashley was trying to make it
[5734.36 - 5738.88] look like she did everything right she
[5736.68 - 5740.80] followed all of Anthony's advice she
[5738.88 - 5744.16] spent a bunch of money on air purifiers
[5740.80 - 5747.56] for the cat dander and still Anthony was
[5744.16 - 5750.68] wrong but here is what actually happened
[5747.56 - 5752.60] with the air purifiers in late 2018
[5750.68 - 5754.96] there were massive fires devastating the
[5752.60 - 5757.88] area of Malibu California where Ashley
[5754.96 - 5760.48] was living at the time on November 9th
[5757.88 - 5762.44] Anthony texted her to check in anony is
[5760.48 - 5766.40] going to read the text he had sent to
[5762.44 - 5768.28] her please be safe hang in their Ash
[5766.40 - 5771.40] worried about you and your precious
[5768.28 - 5774.16] babies hope you are okay praying for
[5771.40 - 5776.76] your house to be safe too and putting
[5774.16 - 5779.40] light all around
[5776.76 - 5781.48] it so Anthony you told her that you were
[5779.40 - 5784.24] putting light around her house can you
[5781.48 - 5786.80] explain for everyone what that means
[5784.24 - 5789.68] I asked Spirit to Encompass the entire
[5786.80 - 5791.28] house with a force of light and I was
[5789.68 - 5793.24] envisioning this force of light
[5791.28 - 5795.84] inhibiting
[5793.24 - 5798.84] Flames okay so you did that and then
[5795.84 - 5800.36] Ashley texted you on November 21st to
[5798.84 - 5803.40] say
[5800.36 - 5806.84] this okay friend what are we talking
[5803.40 - 5809.88] about here the devastation is immense
[5806.84 - 5811.84] the house next to us burnt to the ground
[5809.88 - 5814.48] obviously we want to do the highest
[5811.84 - 5816.12] level of smoke remediation we can can
[5814.48 - 5818.88] but with all of the ash in the
[5816.12 - 5822.04] environment and the months it will take
[5818.88 - 5825.32] to remove the debris do we need to plan
[5822.04 - 5828.44] to be somewhere else for a few
[5825.32 - 5831.52] months next Ashley sends a video of her
[5828.44 - 5833.68] husband showing their house in perfect
[5831.52 - 5835.48] condition and then her husband pivots
[5833.68 - 5838.12] the camera so that it's looking through
[5835.48 - 5839.84] the burnt part of their Hedges out at
[5838.12 - 5842.64] the empty plot where the neighbor's
[5839.84 - 5846.52] house used to be in awe the video gets
[5842.64 - 5846.52] cut off a bit but he says
[5860.96 - 5867.64] unbelievable next Ashley sends this
[5864.76 - 5871.12] text that's our house versus the house
[5867.64 - 5875.08] next door supernaturally protected and
[5871.12 - 5875.08] surrounded by angels
[5875.20 - 5880.84] so Anthony and spirit protected Ashley's
[5878.12 - 5882.48] multi-million doll home with light and
[5880.84 - 5885.00] the video shows that her house was
[5882.48 - 5886.68] completely Untouched by the fires while
[5885.00 - 5889.92] her neighbor's house was completely
[5886.68 - 5892.04] disintegrated down to the ground it's
[5889.92 - 5894.36] literally right next to Ashley's home
[5892.04 - 5896.88] there's hardly any space in between it's
[5894.36 - 5899.40] just a very tall wall of Hedges and only
[5896.88 - 5900.96] a small part of the Hedge is burnt down
[5899.40 - 5902.64] that whole thing should have lit up in
[5900.96 - 5904.04] flames and taken Ashley's house along
[5902.64 - 5905.56] with it it makes no sense
[5904.04 - 5907.68] there's nothing left of the neighbor's
[5905.56 - 5910.24] house and it's truly a miracle that
[5907.68 - 5913.16] Ashley's home was left entirely
[5910.24 - 5917.52] intact then Anthony texted her
[5913.16 - 5919.88] back amazing your house was so protected
[5917.52 - 5922.44] if you stay there you just have to stay
[5919.88 - 5925.04] inside a lot because when the wind blows
[5922.44 - 5927.48] there's a lot of Ash in the air that
[5925.04 - 5929.68] will go into your lungs but if you're
[5927.48 - 5932.40] inside a lot and the inside isn't
[5929.68 - 5934.72] saturated with smoke smell then you can
[5932.40 - 5937.80] stay there and work with with it once
[5934.72 - 5939.56] the rain comes the outside will be so
[5937.80 - 5943.72] much
[5939.56 - 5943.72] better the conversation
[5944.12 - 5949.08] continues okay I think in general we're
[5946.84 - 5951.48] planning to stay away until beginning of
[5949.08 - 5954.00] the year and have the whole house
[5951.48 - 5957.56] treated with ozone and clean top to
[5954.00 - 5962.36] bottom you think by January is a good
[5957.56 - 5965.00] bet yes that's what I would do wait till
[5962.36 - 5967.96] then and we're going to buy some of the
[5965.00 - 5967.96] IQ air
[5968.16 - 5972.80] filters it's important to note here that
[5970.72 - 5975.64] in this conversation that takes place
[5972.80 - 5978.92] one month after Ashley's Hawaii Retreat
[5975.64 - 5982.08] and is about smoke remediation not about
[5978.92 - 5983.80] Eczema or a cat Ashley brings up air
[5982.08 - 5986.60] filters and says they're going to buy
[5983.80 - 5988.80] some for smoke remediation Anthony was
[5986.60 - 5990.16] not the one to bring it up the
[5988.80 - 5995.32] conversation goes
[5990.16 - 5995.32] on some rain could come in between too
[5996.20 - 6000.96] yep
[5997.92 - 6004.36] yes lots of rain
[6000.96 - 6006.52] predicted get the multi-gas one plus
[6004.36 - 6008.84] when the rain comes with no brush to
[6006.52 - 6012.96] hold it back there will be lots of
[6008.84 - 6015.16] landslides so best to be away
[6012.96 - 6017.60] yes got
[6015.16 - 6021.20] it thank
[6017.60 - 6024.92] God Amen so many prayers covering our
[6021.20 - 6028.48] home thank you
[6024.92 - 6031.72] okay so as I said this was one month
[6028.48 - 6033.48] after Ashley's Hawaii Retreat Ashley had
[6031.72 - 6037.60] gotten rid of their household cat on
[6033.48 - 6040.00] June 24th of this same year five months
[6037.60 - 6042.60] prior to this conversation the air
[6040.00 - 6045.60] purifiers were her idea and she got them
[6042.60 - 6047.52] for smoke remediation not for pet dander
[6045.60 - 6050.32] or her son's eczema like one of her
[6047.52 - 6052.64] false versions of the infamous cat story
[6050.32 - 6055.76] suggested it's also worth noting that
[6052.64 - 6059.56] this convers on November 21st about
[6055.76 - 6062.52] Ashley's home took place 8 days after
[6059.56 - 6064.96] Stephanie passed away Ashley made no
[6062.52 - 6067.04] mention of Stephanie or any problem she
[6064.96 - 6068.52] had with Anthony around it but she
[6067.04 - 6071.68] certainly wanted his help with her
[6068.52 - 6074.68] multi-million dollar home I know that
[6071.68 - 6076.36] this is a lot for everybody to take in
[6074.68 - 6079.08] thank you Amber for doing this for the
[6076.36 - 6081.44] community the evidence we presented
[6079.08 - 6084.88] today shows that Ashley can't get
[6081.44 - 6087.12] anything right even historical stories
[6084.88 - 6089.40] that can be easily fact checked and she
[6087.12 - 6091.92] has to fabricate and lie about her own
[6089.40 - 6094.56] personal experiences with me to try to
[6091.92 - 6097.52] convince people that I got it wrong to
[6094.56 - 6101.28] call me a liar and a fraud when as you
[6097.52 - 6103.44] can see here she's caught so many times
[6101.28 - 6105.76] in just what has been covered in this
[6103.44 - 6108.80] episode alone lying and telling
[6105.76 - 6111.56] fraudulent Stories the story about the
[6108.80 - 6114.40] 10 booms and the Holocaust is a litmus
[6111.56 - 6117.16] test to Ashley's inability to tell not
[6114.40 - 6119.56] only stories about Stephanie and me and
[6117.16 - 6122.32] the cat but clearly shows that she
[6119.56 - 6124.76] cannot even get a historic story even
[6122.32 - 6127.24] partially correct it's one thing when
[6124.76 - 6129.92] people hear all these versions of lies
[6127.24 - 6132.28] and falsehoods and her madeup stories
[6129.92 - 6134.76] but it's another when you have a
[6132.28 - 6137.88] landmark such as the 10 Booms to clearly
[6134.76 - 6139.60] see how Ashley can't get it right it's
[6137.88 - 6141.52] another reason why I wouldn't do
[6139.60 - 6144.24] business with Ashley when she proposed
[6141.52 - 6147.00] so many business deals she wanted to
[6144.24 - 6149.40] partner with me on painfully almost
[6147.00 - 6152.04] everything she said always had falsities
[6149.40 - 6154.60] or mistakes or misinformation saturated
[6152.04 - 6156.76] in it what Ashley's been doing with the
[6154.60 - 6159.84] cat story is what she's been doing with
[6156.76 - 6162.68] her entire smear campaign against me as
[6159.84 - 6165.96] a whole it's an endless stream of sloppy
[6162.68 - 6170.04] lies and psychological games how sad is
[6165.96 - 6172.36] it that I actually did help her son he
[6170.04 - 6175.96] recovered and I helped her out of the
[6172.36 - 6178.32] kindness of my heart for free I wasn't
[6175.96 - 6180.80] making any money from it I wasn't
[6178.32 - 6183.52] gaining anything from it and because she
[6180.80 - 6187.12] has nothing to show that I'm a bad guy
[6183.52 - 6189.72] or did anything wrong she has to lie and
[6187.12 - 6191.84] take something that was positive that I
[6189.72 - 6194.92] actually helped her with and was
[6191.84 - 6197.20] accurate about and perverted to make it
[6194.92 - 6199.84] look like the exact opposite of what
[6197.20 - 6201.76] really happened so that she can try to
[6199.84 - 6204.64] take me
[6201.76 - 6206.92] down there are people who have serious
[6204.64 - 6209.12] mental health problems there are people
[6206.92 - 6211.80] who are just inaccurate and get things
[6209.12 - 6213.68] wrong there are people who attack and
[6211.80 - 6216.28] intentionally set out to harm other
[6213.68 - 6219.08] people there are people who FIB there
[6216.28 - 6221.96] are people who are pathological liars
[6219.08 - 6224.72] and then there's Ashley Foster she's
[6221.96 - 6227.36] truly in a league of her own this is
[6224.72 - 6230.24] unprecedented as we've said and in my
[6227.36 - 6232.80] opinion it should be studied
[6230.24 - 6234.96] clinically what's even more disturbing
[6232.80 - 6237.40] is that this episode just barely
[6234.96 - 6240.04] scratches the surface this is what
[6237.40 - 6243.16] Ashley does with every story with every
[6240.04 - 6247.04] claim with every rumor she spreads it's
[6243.16 - 6248.52] all this distorted it's all this Twisted
[6247.04 - 6250.52] it's all this
[6248.52 - 6253.04] untrue and the other plotters have
[6250.52 - 6255.76] followed suit and have the same patterns
[6253.04 - 6257.96] we could do hundreds of podcast episodes
[6255.76 - 6260.92] on twisting the lies and falsities like
[6257.96 - 6263.68] this the evidence is all there and this
[6260.92 - 6265.92] is just the beginning
[6263.68 - 6268.04] with the Stephanie story Ashley and
[6265.92 - 6270.08] Stephanie's brother are abusing the fact
[6268.04 - 6272.32] that nobody else has access to the
[6270.08 - 6274.40] entirety of Stephanie's text threads
[6272.32 - 6276.84] with all of the people who were involved
[6274.40 - 6278.84] or any of the other evidence to see what
[6276.84 - 6281.56] Ashley and Stephanie's brother have
[6278.84 - 6283.88] hidden manipulated taken out of context
[6281.56 - 6285.72] and altered as they're making outrageous
[6283.88 - 6288.20] claims against Anthony and trying to
[6285.72 - 6290.84] rewrite history to push a fake story
[6288.20 - 6293.52] we'll get to more of that in due time
[6290.84 - 6295.88] the ten Boom story and the cat story are
[6293.52 - 6298.84] examples that everyone can use to verify
[6295.88 - 6301.56] for themselves exactly the level of
[6298.84 - 6304.08] unimaginable reality Distortion and
[6301.56 - 6306.44] perversion of the truth that Ashley and
[6304.08 - 6308.80] her hateful group have continued to
[6306.44 - 6310.56] employ with the Stephanie story and with
[6308.80 - 6313.20] the other stories that they
[6310.56 - 6315.52] tell one online commenter who has
[6313.20 - 6317.52] observed the behavior of Ashley and her
[6315.52 - 6320.20] hateful group said
[6317.52 - 6323.04] this everything they accuse Anthony and
[6320.20 - 6326.12] the mm community of being is what they
[6323.04 - 6328.44] elves are doing to the mm Community it's
[6326.12 - 6330.68] so frustrating and sad the amount of
[6328.44 - 6332.72] gaslighting belittling and just pure
[6330.68 - 6335.12] hostility from these people is hard to
[6332.72 - 6337.32] Bear especially after years of suffering
[6335.12 - 6339.52] chronic illness with no answers and all
[6337.32 - 6341.84] the trauma that comes with that it's
[6339.52 - 6343.52] painful and scary to witness how
[6341.84 - 6345.40] committed these people are to twisting
[6343.52 - 6347.28] reality and taking advantage of people
[6345.40 - 6348.36] who don't know any better how do they
[6347.28 - 6351.56] live with
[6348.36 - 6354.92] themselves another online commenter said
[6351.56 - 6356.72] this it's so despicable what are we in
[6354.92 - 6359.16] high school this is something high
[6356.72 - 6361.28] schoolers and middle schoolers do it's
[6359.16 - 6363.72] Petty and narcissistic behavior it's a
[6361.28 - 6366.52] narcissistic smear campaign it's got
[6363.72 - 6368.08] narcissists written all over it only
[6366.52 - 6371.00] people with hatred in their hearts would
[6368.08 - 6373.28] do this it's obvious but then comes the
[6371.00 - 6375.12] fakeness the lies the smearing of
[6373.28 - 6377.88] another person's name and reputation
[6375.12 - 6379.40] Without Regrets they are heartless
[6377.88 - 6381.60] you're supposed to take everyone into
[6379.40 - 6383.56] consideration before you act and speak
[6381.60 - 6385.40] that is what adults do
[6383.56 - 6387.20] they will die a slow and lonely death on
[6385.40 - 6389.72] their socials and they should regret
[6387.20 - 6391.52] this the rest of their lives but Ashley
[6389.72 - 6393.24] probably won't she's always seemed like
[6391.52 - 6394.32] she doesn't actually care about others
[6393.24 - 6396.96] which is
[6394.32 - 6400.12] depressing and a third online commenter
[6396.96 - 6402.16] said this it has become ridiculous now
[6400.12 - 6404.04] Amber I truly hope the plotters just
[6402.16 - 6406.88] fade into the background and leave this
[6404.04 - 6409.12] wonderful mm Community alone they are
[6406.88 - 6411.44] cruel very childish obsessed with
[6409.12 - 6413.40] revenge and embarrassing not forgetting
[6411.44 - 6415.68] the Carnage they leave behind that you
[6413.40 - 6417.92] mm and the community have to pick up and
[6415.68 - 6419.08] repair for those that sadly fell for
[6417.92 - 6422.40] their
[6419.08 - 6424.44] lies Ashley has formed her hateful Group
[6422.40 - 6426.52] by taking advantage of people who
[6424.44 - 6428.92] already have an ulterior reason why they
[6426.52 - 6431.04] don't like medical medium whether it's
[6428.92 - 6432.68] pure spiritual discrimination or
[6431.04 - 6434.88] somebody who sells ionizer water
[6432.68 - 6436.28] machines for example who got mad at
[6434.88 - 6439.24] Anthony when he started sharing about
[6436.28 - 6440.92] the downsides of ionizer water machines
[6439.24 - 6443.00] because of how much influence he has in
[6440.92 - 6444.56] the health industry
[6443.00 - 6445.92] they're also taking advantage of the
[6444.56 - 6448.24] fact that when people are dealing with
[6445.92 - 6449.36] chronic illness they often get confused
[6448.24 - 6452.04] about their
[6449.36 - 6453.92] symptoms when somebody's confused
[6452.04 - 6456.40] they're may be not reading the books or
[6453.92 - 6458.88] understanding trajectory or flare Cycles
[6456.40 - 6461.16] or new exposures they're may be having a
[6458.88 - 6463.08] hard time implementing the information
[6461.16 - 6465.36] they're frustrated with their symptoms
[6463.08 - 6467.12] they're emotional they're vulnerable and
[6465.36 - 6469.40] then they come across a post from Ashley
[6467.12 - 6471.68] Foster that says Anthony is a liar and a
[6469.40 - 6474.32] fraud he missed the fact that my son had
[6471.68 - 6476.28] a cat allergy he put me on a restrictive
[6474.32 - 6479.68] diet that made my nails break and my
[6476.28 - 6482.68] hair fall out it strikes a cord it
[6479.68 - 6485.68] instills doubt and fear and that is
[6482.68 - 6487.76] Ashley's goal when in reality the story
[6485.68 - 6491.32] she told is the opposite of what
[6487.76 - 6494.44] actually happened it's all lies designed
[6491.32 - 6496.32] to play on people's emotions it's sick
[6494.44 - 6498.84] it's manipulative and it's
[6496.32 - 6501.12] self-serving Ashley does not care about
[6498.84 - 6503.92] the chronically ill Ashley doesn't care
[6501.12 - 6506.36] about people healing Ashley has publicly
[6503.92 - 6509.52] attacked shamed and humiliated the
[6506.36 - 6511.52] chronically ill and women and children
[6509.52 - 6514.32] which is going to be exposed in this
[6511.52 - 6517.64] series this is all about Ashley getting
[6514.32 - 6520.52] what she wants and she will lie and use
[6517.64 - 6523.76] and harm anyone that she needs to in the
[6520.52 - 6526.36] process there's no other way to say it
[6523.76 - 6528.40] it is abusive behavior and Ashley needs
[6526.36 - 6531.04] to be held
[6528.40 - 6533.52] accountable as we are in the process of
[6531.04 - 6535.48] exposing Ashley and her organized
[6533.52 - 6537.92] hateful group for who and what they
[6535.48 - 6539.88] really are it's important to take note
[6537.92 - 6542.40] of their tactics and patterns that are
[6539.88 - 6544.80] likely to follow the plotters have a
[6542.40 - 6547.92] documented history of initiating attacks
[6544.80 - 6550.20] using lies and misinformation and then
[6547.92 - 6553.24] upon getting called out and corrected
[6550.20 - 6555.92] trying to flip it and play victim that
[6553.24 - 6558.48] is not going to work here all this group
[6555.92 - 6560.72] has done is spread verifiable lies and
[6558.48 - 6563.36] falsities they've carelessly attacked
[6560.72 - 6565.52] and harmed many innocent people they've
[6563.36 - 6567.28] used and exploited deceased individuals
[6565.52 - 6570.04] and others in the process of trying to
[6567.28 - 6572.52] get what they want they've repeatedly
[6570.04 - 6574.44] explicitly expressed the intent to harm
[6572.52 - 6576.16] medical medium and they've even
[6574.44 - 6578.36] deliberately tried to stop Anthony from
[6576.16 - 6581.08] doing a free event to support and raise
[6578.36 - 6583.20] money for the community we have every
[6581.08 - 6585.68] right to set the record straight and to
[6583.20 - 6587.60] defend the truth with facts and evidence
[6585.68 - 6589.16] and to defend the chronically ill
[6587.60 - 6591.64] against the malicious attacks of this
[6589.16 - 6595.40] group and we are going to continue to do
[6591.64 - 6598.12] so we expect the plotters to evade and
[6595.40 - 6600.00] ignore what they have done wrong we
[6598.12 - 6602.92] expect them to continue to lie and
[6600.00 - 6605.92] spread falsities we expect them to Pivot
[6602.92 - 6609.08] onto something new they'll make up and
[6605.92 - 6612.08] we expect them to skew and alter data
[6609.08 - 6614.80] and to hide critical pieces of evidence
[6612.08 - 6617.80] that undermines their entire campaign we
[6614.80 - 6620.12] also expect the plotters to fabricate
[6617.80 - 6622.04] explanations as they do everything they
[6620.12 - 6625.12] can to try to discredit what we're
[6622.04 - 6628.68] exposing them for having done and said
[6625.12 - 6631.52] in their own words but we are using
[6628.68 - 6635.24] their own text messages voice messages
[6631.52 - 6637.72] social media posts words that they spoke
[6635.24 - 6640.88] on recorded calls and other published
[6637.72 - 6644.28] materials there's no use of any AI in
[6640.88 - 6646.68] any of these episodes and never will be
