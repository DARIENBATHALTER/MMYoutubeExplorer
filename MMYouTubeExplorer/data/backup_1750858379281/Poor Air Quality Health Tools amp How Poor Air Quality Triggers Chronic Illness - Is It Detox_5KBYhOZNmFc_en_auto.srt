1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
matter if you don't have any symptoms or

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,980
conditions you have nothing wrong with

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,179
you at least in the moment maybe down

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,040
the road you'll have something wrong

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,000
with you because everybody's going to

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,179
have something wrong with them

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,920
regardless of what's going on but

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,300
it could be a trigger that you're

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,100
sensitive to because there's lots of

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,080
triggers out there all over the place

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,640
everywhere one of the triggers that's

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,140
happening right now for people that's

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,100
not good for their health because of

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,199
what they're struggling with and

15
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,019
everything else is environmental

16
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,200
disaster air quality stuff going on

17
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,040
fires

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
fires right

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,579
fires that have been saying for years

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,579
are not just naturally caused

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,340
so and that's a whole other story but

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,100
regardless

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,260
fires that are happening is a big

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,420
problem and it isn't just the smoke

25
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,120
itself

26
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,699
it's the Smoke Plus

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,579
so many other things burning within that

28
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:05,159
fire so it's not just the wood smoke of

29
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:10,020
the trees and the leaves and the woods

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,960
it's more than that it's much more it's

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,659
when junk in the woods gets lit up with

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,140
it it's when houses get lit up with it

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,280
with all that treated lumber

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,320
and then it's all of the fire flame

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,659
retardants that are dropped over and

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,939
over and over again from the sky onto

37
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,799
the fires and that stuff travels

38
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,799
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

39
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,560
miles and it's in the air and it's just

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,680
white powder that's floating in the air

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,259
and it floats endlessly endlessly

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,000
endlessly and then we breathe it in so

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,079
I'm talking about air quality tools but

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm going to talk about some other stuff

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
too because there's lots of triggers

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,439
that bring people down and bring their

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,020
health down and brings them to such you

48
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,360
know a susceptible place and we don't

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,240
want to be so susceptible

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,740
we want to be empowered no matter what

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,140
we're up against no matter what we're

52
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,360
breathing in no matter what we're seeing

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,039
no matter what's going on in our life we

54
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,560
want to be empowered and strengthened

55
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,000
and that's really a critical part of it

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,620
anyway you guys

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,599
I want to talk a little bit about all of

58
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,860
it I have a PDF

59
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:27,660
and it's not 99 and it's not 250 dollars

60
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:32,099
and it's not 39.99 the PDF is free

61
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,260
it costs money to make I had to have a

62
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,780
whole team working on it

63
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,580
it's an incredible PDF

64
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,920
and it's free

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,840
free free

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,760
because it's not always about the money

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,220
it's about making sure you can provide

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,280
whatever you can for people so they got

69
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,080
every fighting chance so I wanted to

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,599
make sure I do another free pdf

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,700
environmental disaster air quality tools

72
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,980
by Anthony William

73
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,980

74
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,700
it's a free download

75
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,040
medicalmedium.com

76
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,200
environmental disaster air quality tools

77
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,420
environmental disasters happen all the

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,099
time on this planet

79
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,140
purposely

80
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:18,659
or not on purpose

81
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,260
causing the air to become polluted and

82
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:24,599
toxic often from smoke burning and fires

83
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,760
it's not just the smoke itself that

84
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,800
causes harm to our health but also the

85
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,239
chemicals in other toxins that are in

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,879
the air

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
the link is in the profile and the link

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,360
is in the description you can download

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,420
it free right there right in the link in

90
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,280
the profile description how cool is that

91
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,440
it's not just the smoke itself that

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,239
causes harm to our health but also the

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,260
chemicals and other toxins that are in

94
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,580
the air

95
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:53,099
for example when a building Burns there

96
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,260
are countless chemicals that burn and

97
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,140
get into the air or when fire retardants

98
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,620
are sprayed dumped on the fires

99
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:05,099
endlessly their chemicals in that float

100
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,780
around forever toxic heavy metals are

101
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,940
one of the thing that's in those Flame

102
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,739
retardants

103
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,900
and they become a part of the dust and

104
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,079
smoke that people and animals are all

105
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,220
breathing in all the time you may be

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,419
somebody that's like well you know what

107
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,799
I don't need to watch this right now

108
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:21,120
because I'm not dealing with any kind of

109
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,500
fire stuff but I'm going to talk about

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,660
other triggers I'm going to talk about

111
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,400
sensitivities

112
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,960
things that break down our immune system

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,960
and make us susceptible

114
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,600
aside from causing a more obvious

115
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,100
breathing and lung issues poor air

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,320
quality can lower the immune system what

117
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,600
poor air quality can lower the immune

118
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,460
system and be a trigger to all kinds of

119
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,919
chronic illnesses symptoms and

120
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,960
conditions both in the short term and

121
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,520
long after the environmental disaster or

122
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,500
exposure has occurred so here's the

123
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,060
thing you might be out of the woods by

124
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,759
now maybe you don't smell anything

125
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,400
anymore but then something kind of

126
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,199
develops later

127
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,280
Aftershock it's kind of like that car

128
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,919
accident

129
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,500
that you were in

130
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,300
everything felt fine

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,560
you open your car door you got out

132
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,860
you're like wait a minute I think I'm

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,479
okay I think I'm all right okay let me

134
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,580
just go find out this person's insurance

135
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,460
information maybe we'll call the police

136
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,160
and have a you know traffic cop out here

137
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,479
and everything's good you go home you

138
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,699
don't need to go to a hospital you go

139
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,340
home and then it hits you as the night

140
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,520
goes on or the next day or two weeks

141
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,520
later

142
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:40,139
so our immune system can be lowered

143
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,880
triggering chronic illness symptoms

144
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,740
conditions both in the short term and

145
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,660
long after the environmental disaster or

146
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,699
exposure has occurred guys are wondering

147
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,400
what I'm reading reading the free pdf

148
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,860
you can download link is in a profile

149
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,320
link is in the description good to see

150
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,300
you guys by the way

151
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,220
One Way pollutants in the air can be

152
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,320
problematic is because they not only

153
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,660
lower the immune system

154
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,580
yeah

155
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,220
lower the immune system they also

156
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,100
provide food for viruses

157
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,000
that then release neurotoxins and

158
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,000
dermatoxins

159
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,539
mm info has been all about viruses for

160
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,520
years and years and years decades and

161
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,520
now everybody they're a virus genius now

162
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,259
symptoms and conditions such as

163
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,240
headaches and migraines fatigue eczema

164
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,160
psoriasis aches and pain sleep problems

165
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,680
autoimmune disorders brain fog and so

166
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,360
much more a flare-up and worsening of

167
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,979
symptoms and conditions you already have

168
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,259
struggled with or currently struggle

169
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,180
with or the onset of new symptoms and

170
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,180
conditions can occur especially after

171
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,100
heavier prolonged exposure to poor air

172
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,360
quality or if your immune system is

173
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,280
already struggling sounds like a drug

174
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,319
commercial almost like

175
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,319
right look out for side effects

176
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,440
your side effects may be bleeding your

177
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,180
side effects may be

178
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,319
what happens is that people don't

179
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,400
realize what they're dealing with

180
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,039
they're dealing with a lot of different

181
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,780
viruses inside their body low grade

182
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,360
viral issues

183
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,220
bacterial like streptococcus those

184
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,860
things amp up when your immune system

185
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,979
drops so we walk around with our immune

186
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,840
system hopefully intact and strong and

187
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,340
then as our immune system drops and it

188
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,120
gets triggered by chemicals and

189
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,880
pollutants in the air and all that then

190
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,280
viral issues rise up

191
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,680
Dr Fawn says it's true nowadays when you

192
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,240
Google autoimmune disease plus EBV there

193
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,280
are so many articles one to two years

194
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,660
ago it wasn't there four years ago

195
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,400
definitely wasn't there five years ago

196
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:47,060
no MM info putting it out there

197
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,060
yep

198
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,199
we don't need to be fearful of these

199
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,020
kinds of events out there that happen

200
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,539
and their impact on our health they're

201
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:01,319
outside of our control

202
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:03,419
we can't control we can think of fire to

203
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,220
not happen we can try to stop a fire

204
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,020
with our mind

205
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,900
we can stand there on the edge of the

206
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,240
woods and just say fire die down

207
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,979
and we can use every single thing we

208
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,680
have we can use our psychic of power

209
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,660
that powerful psychic abilities we can

210
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,039
try to stop that fire but it doesn't

211
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,400
mean you're going to be able to stop it

212
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,400
that way

213
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,900
some things are going to be out of our

214
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,900
control

215
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:33,240
and these fires that are started by

216
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,459
evildoers or just started because two

217
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,039
bunny rabbits in the woods

218
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,700
we're rubbing two sticks together and

219
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,700
started a fire

220
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,519
I think this

221
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,779
natural fire disaster that's taken over

222
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,480
thousands upon thousands of countless

223
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,600
Acres was started with two bunny rabbits

224
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,440
that were trying to start the fire by

225
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,899
whittling together two pieces of wood

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,120
because they were cold because you

227
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,860
believe everything right

228
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,240
just put it on the news two bunny

229
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,300
rabbits

230
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,920
were chilly that night and they were and

231
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,019
they were rubbing sticks together and

232
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,279
they started the fire that's what our

233
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,279
research has shown

234
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,279
we don't need to be fearful of these

235
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,440
kinds of events

236
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:31,200
and other events too that happened you

237
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,519
remember Fukushima

238
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,019
yeah what was it 2011 Fukushima all that

239
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,180
radiation heading to the West Coast

240
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:42,420
heading to California

241
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:46,160
oh all that radiation particle just

242
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,160
heading to California coast in Hawaii

243
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,580
people in Hawaii would glow in the dark

244
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,180
after that

245
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,160
I just it's unbelievable really when you

246
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,740
think about it

247
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,200
that's why it's critical to do some of

248
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,779
the medical medium tools because to work

249
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,080
on like radiation exposure

250
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:10,320
I have a friend that lives in Hawaii

251
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,760
and they're still doing my friend is

252
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,220
still in their family are still doing

253
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,339
medical medium tools for anti-radiation

254
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,500
and everything else

255
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,660
because of that whole Fukushima thing

256
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,580
there and it's not like anybody told

257
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,920
everybody in Hawaii like you might want

258
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,120
to leave Hawaii for a little while but

259
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,120
no that's not how it works

260
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,940
we're off the beaten path right now so

261
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,940
hang on we'll get back on the path

262
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,459
we need to be equipped and empowered for

263
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,040
those times when we do have to live with

264
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:46,019
poor air quality and toxic exposures and

265
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,820
give our bodies the extra care they need

266
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:51,060

not gonna tell you what happened there

300
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,620
but many of you know

301
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,940
I was the only one that was permanently

302
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,279
banned on there

303
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,700
for no reason

304
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,079
all right but I'm back on Tick Tock so

305
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,940
check me out when you get a chance

306
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,320
because I'm going to be putting some

307
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,320
exclusive content

308
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,399
somebody's gonna say he's not the only

309
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:41,459
one no no I was the only one

310
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,040
maybe one of the only ones

311
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,680
that

312
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,980
in health the only one in health about

313
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,980
that

314
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,040
all right so I'm chopping up a little

315
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,660
bit of ginger

316
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,860
supposed to grate it but I'm gonna

317
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,860
finely chop it

318
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,380
tells you when you're doing something

319
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,380
right

320
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,940
you just get so many people upset

321
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,620
everywhere

322
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,620
the more people that get healed

323
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,579
the more you get

324
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,760
all right

325
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,779
enough about me

326
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,700
so I got some chopped up Ginger right

327
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,660
there what I'm gonna do is put it in

328
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,240
here

329
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:40,459
I'm gonna put it on top of here so let

330
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,459
me just get it into my little strainer

331
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:50,279
don't use hot water just you know just

332
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:54,540
regular temperature water

333
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:57,420
and I will definitely not

334
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:02,240
and I repeat not

335
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,240
spill it on my PDF I just print it out

336
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,480
so I'm going to let that sleep for 15

337
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,519
minutes that's what you do this is so

338
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,320
simple

339
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,320
but it's powerful

340
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,480
don't underestimate ever

341
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,899
lemon ginger and honey

342
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,019
in water don't underestimate it it's

343
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:30,120
powerful makes a difference big

344
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,639
difference all right

345
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,260
I want to show you this little trick too

346
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,700
before we talk about that as well first

347
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,019
of all I got my celery juice right here

348
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,199
it's been sitting for a little while

349
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,820
made it earlier you know how it settled

350
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:44,040
sometimes right we can shake it up

351
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,920
before you drink it celery juice that's

352
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,800
another powerful tool for when you're

353
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,300
dealing with immune system antagonizers

354
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,300
because that's what I call it so not

355
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,320
just air quality issues or immune system

356
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,519
antagonizers but so many other things

357
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,820
are too

358
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,620
and um I love that celery juice for that

359
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,620
it's about keeping our immune system

360
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,839
strong why why even bother keeping our

361
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,480
immune system strong what's the what's

362
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,060
the reason who cares who cares if

363
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,639
everybody's immune system gets dropped

364
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,959
or gets tackled

365
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,060
or starts to break down who cares

366
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,339
we should all care so when our immune

367
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,339
system starts to break down

368
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,380
 hits the fan and we have to be

369
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,660
careful we want our immune system nice

370
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,839
and strong we want it to do its job

371
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,279
wanted to conquer Invaders so I'm

372
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,720
letting this steep for a little bit I

373
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,899
want to show you this little trick right

374
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,899
here

375
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,899
now I know there's a lot of people out

376
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,079
there just freaking out about masks

377
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:49,320
right there's a massive mask War out

378
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,940
there Mass need Master mask right don't

379
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,639
wear masks ever they're killing you

380
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,740
master good Master bad Master's doing

381
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,000
bad bad good bad bad everyone wants to

382
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,680
kill each other

383
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,180
over masks

384
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,560
this is not a freaking mask

385
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,959
so I just want to make that clear

386
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,040
because someone's going to think this is

387
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,959
a mask

388
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,779
and then they're going to want to cancel

389
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:17,820
aw over that

390
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:19,980
this is a wet cloth right

391
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,079
so

392
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,339
see doesn't even ring out oh it rings

393
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,260
out a little bit

394
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,240
so it's nice and

395
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,519
nice and good

396
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,860
so what am I doing with this

397
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,779
this is an incredible tool right here

398
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,880
when you're dealing with smoke and smoke

399
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,980
pollutants all that inhalants all that

400
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,680
stuff all the toxins that are in the air

401
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,920
from the fires

402
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,279
right here now somebody

403
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,660
who's really really smart

404
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,180
they believe they're really smart

405
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,160
they're going to say how is this going

406
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,940
to filter smoke

407
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,360
it's thin it's a dish cloth washed towel

408
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,360
whatever washcloth

409
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,339
how is it going to do it what happens is

410
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,699
when you wet it

411
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:11,280
it swells the cotton

412
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,980
it swells the fabric

413
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,660
and it swells it together like it

414
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,299
spreads it out

415
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,520
so this is important to know

416
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:24,720
and then when it's wet

417
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,839
the moisture is what captures the flame

418
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,700
retardants the dust the pollution the

419
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,480
sea trails

420
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,480
the whatever

421
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,940
now it's not perfect

422
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,340
by any means some will escape but it

423
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,299
brings it down greatly if you're in a

424
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,460
serious

425
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,740
situation especially if you're running

426
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,419
from the house to the car especially if

427
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,760
you're you know if you're out somewhere

428
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,980
whatever it is and you're stuck in it if

429
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,400
you have a bottle of water and you have

430
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:59,460
a piece of cloth even a t-shirt in your

431
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,860
car whatever and you wet that it's

432
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,140
really powerful

433
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,140
and so what you can do with this

434
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,400
is you can put it just like this

435
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,740
now what you're doing is you're giving

436
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,380
yourself lots of room in there so you're

437
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,580
making a pocket in there

438
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,220
and those pollutants that smoke that Ash

439
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,660
those flame retardants those chemicals

440
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,820
all of it

441
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,620
start getting trapped

442
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,860
in here

443
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,919
because the moisture is what does it

444
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,559
if this was dry it wouldn't do it

445
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,960
it just would not work the fabric

446
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,700
wouldn't swell

447
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,120
because that's what it does it like

448
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,980
swells itself shut when it's wet

449
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,620
and so as you're breathing you're

450
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,580
pulling in all that stuff through the

451
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,039
water

452
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:53,280
in the fabric the water is what captures

453
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,919
everything so it has to be moist like

454
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,520
that don't

455
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:02,280
run towards a fire in the smoke and be

456
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,679
like it doesn't matter I have I have my

457
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,960
wet towel I'm gonna go find some fire

458
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm gonna go find somebody's fire pit

459
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,720
then go look over the fire pit and just

460
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,360
like don't do that whatever you do

461
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,919
but

462
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,679
Death By A Thousand Cuts

463
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,660
quiet Roseman says

464
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,620
IG

465
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,940
Death By A Thousand Cuts medical medium

466
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,880
term

467
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,960
used in health regard regarding to our

468
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,820
health

469
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,559
breaking down our immune system breaking

470
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,380
down our body breaking down our organs

471
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,419
all the different cuts out there I can

472
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,360
name so many in a row really quick too

473
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,520
it's not even just stuff like that or

474
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,460
triggers but stuff that's out there that

475
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,500
people are using every day

476
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,880
there's so many triggers out there that

477
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,500
don't help us there's so many different

478
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,120
things that are not that are not helpful

479
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,940
right let's finish making this right

480
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,640
here if you guys don't mind

481
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,120
straining this

482
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,120
okay

483
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:10,340
210 15 minutes I like 15 minutes

484
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,340
that should be pretty good right there

485
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:18,200
get a lemon in here I'm gonna squeeze

486
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,200
some lemon in here it's like this

487
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,740
of course I got lemon juice on my PBF

488
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,320
all right and then we're gonna get some

489
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,320
honey in here too

490
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,220
I like doing things live

491
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,780
cut cut gotta edit that we got to do an

492
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,400
edit you guys we gotta edit this

493
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,780
I don't want that on there for everybody

494
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,860
to see

495
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,860
I want it to be perfect

496
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:03,059
lemon honey ginger water

497
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,220
honey is antimicrobial antibacterial

498
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,440
but it's more than that it's glucose

499
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,400
glucose protects the brain when you're

500
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,400
in fear

501
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,120
it's a glucose it's so easy to get to

502
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,059
the brain

503
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,860
honey goes right to the brain and then

504
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,140
you got all the trace minerals

505
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:25,140
phytochemical compounds

506
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,640
and the liver too mm info the glucose

507
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,640
that's preserved in the liver

508
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,080
all of that right

509
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,299
the liver helps flush out toxins too

510
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,039
that's what it does the liver helps to

511
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,620
flush out toxins

512
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,600
and then more glucose is used out of

513
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:47,299
your liver the body needs the glucose

514
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,299
the honey is a great source of glucose

515
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,000
regenerator

516
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,000
storm okay

517
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,740
I like trying to use some different

518
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,799
words right sometimes they're not so

519
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:04,440
great but they're good enough I think

520
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:07,580
all right so that's this can I sip this

521
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,580
if you guys don't mind

522
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:13,980
that's so good ah I love it

523
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,380
love that very much

524
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,059
all right

525
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,900
so I want to go through this PDF a

526
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,000
little bit for a couple of minutes

527
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,299
before I read a little bit more

528
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,159
so what I really like about this PDF is

529
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,780
you got the seven top supplements right

530
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,940
there

531
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:34,100
and you'll see them I have them out here

532
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:37,380
seven top supplements four air quality

533
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,880
problems immune system building all of

534
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,460
it you got the propolis right there you

535
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,260
got the B12 you got the zinc you got the

536
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,059
micro C you got the glutathione it's

537
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,620
incredible for detoxification right

538
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:50,760
there

539
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:52,500
helps the body to naturally detox bodies

540
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,240
that are sick and filled with garbage

541
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,919
and filled with junk livers that are

542
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,500
sick and filled with garbage and filled

543
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,380
with junk for years decades

544
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,760
and then on top of that we get problems

545
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,400
where all of a sudden we're breathing in

546
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,020
all the fire smoke or breathing in Sea

547
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,820
Trails that's another one all on its own

548
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,820
all the sea trails that were inhaling

549
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,760
and breathing in dumping on us we live

550
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,080
in it it's being you know dropped on us

551
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,299
every day

552
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,400
so I love things like the glutathione

553
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:22,200
that's the Imaging one you guys know I

554
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,220
endorse these guys the best stuff out

555
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,760
there

556
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,919
and that's the micro C doesn't burn a

557
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,900
hole in your stomach

558
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,440
when someone says vitamin C to me I'm

559
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,440
always just like

560
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:38,640
vitamin C really yeah yeah I'm on

561
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,159
vitamin C really I hope you're not

562
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,860
burning a hole in your gut

563
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,220
with that ascorbic acid and so I love

564
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,860
about the vermergy micro C it's not all

565
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,360
that ascorbic acid so hard on the

566
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,400
stomach so hard on the intestinal

567
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,960
Linings you know to worry about that

568
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,880
with people

569
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,559
when they're doing vitamin C out there

570
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,580
and they think they got a good vitamin C

571
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,559
and it's just like eek eek so we got the

572
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,659
zinc liquid zinc sulfate where we got

573
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,260
that one we got the B12 we got the

574
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:12,419
propolis so good all of those immune

575
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,919
system Builders keeping our immune

576
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,260
system strong

577
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,200
and it matters because what happens

578
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,480
after we breathe in toxins and poisons

579
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,240
and environmental junk and garbage and

580
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,919
everything else and sea trails and Flame

581
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,840
retardants and that's just some things

582
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,780
and pesticides herbicides whatever it is

583
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,820
that we're breathing in or taking in

584
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:35,640
especially if it's burning

585
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,620
whatever it is it drops the immune

586
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,600
system why because our immune cells have

587
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,460
to gobble it up

588
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,220
and that's something people don't

589
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:47,340
realize that our immune cells have to

590
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,740
eat all the garbage and junk so if

591
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,780
you're breathing in smoke all of the

592
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,000
immune cells in the body are now just

593
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,159
eating smoke that's all it's doing and

594
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,020
then the ball is dropped

595
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,780
that's how it goes wrong it's one thing

596
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,220
to say oh yeah immune system yeah I

597
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,580
learned something the other day you know

598
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,799
the immune system is uh it weakens when

599
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,500
you breathe in fire

600
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,360
I heard some guy talking

601
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,220
um when you breathe in bad stuff your

602
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,659
immune system has a problem right it's

603
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,400
one thing to look at it that way it's

604
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:21,539
another to know why it's because your

605
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:24,840
immune cells are eating all of that crap

606
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:28,820
that was in that smoke that smoke enters

607
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,820
into your body

608
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,600
it's like you know go to a barbecue or

609
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:37,260
go to a barbecue restaurant and they're

610
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,679
smoking or like yeah we use oak wood to

611
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,860
smoke our pigs and look let's open up

612
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,600
this big old thing

613
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,539
there it is right there we got a whole

614
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,059
half a pig here we got a whole brisket

615
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,039
here we got a whole another half a pig

616
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,440
we got two turkeys here we've got four

617
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,080
chickens down here and we're smoking

618
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,059
this stuff and we got the oak we're

619
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,120
doing the oak logs that's what we do in

620
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:05,659
our our you know bar at our Grill at our

621
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,659
barbecue

622
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:13,380
and that smoke enters into every pore

623
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,080
and every single cell in that Pig's body

624
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,480
and in that brisket

625
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,299
in that cow's body

626
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,460
and in those chickens body it enters in

627
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:26,580
it goes Cuts right through it like no

628
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,679
tomorrow that's what it does

629
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,900
and when we get it on our skin it cuts

630
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,820
through in in us and we get it in our

631
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,559
lungs it cuts through in US

632
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,779
it's like we're feet where it's like

633
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,659
we're smoked pigs you know ready for a

634
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:41,940
barbecue and

635
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,039
then our immune system has to gobble up

636
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,460
every single bit of it every little

637
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:49,260
particle it can possibly gobble up every

638
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,120
toxin it can gobble up and that's what

639
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,760
happens is our immune system has to

640
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,279
clean up the mess and then our immune

641
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,080
cells get filled up

642
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,360
and they die

643
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,559
it's not like

644
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:07,260
they can restore their

645
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,140
their actually ending their life cycle

646
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:13,620
because of this stuff

647
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:16,740
so when we get exposure our immune cells

648
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:20,039
have to eat it all up

649
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,360
and then our immune cells are spent

650
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,760
they're spent it's not like they

651
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,380
recharge many of them eat all that

652
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,419
garbage up

653
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,100
and they die with that stuff

654
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:32,580
and you can see it and then it leaves

655
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:35,279
your body inside those dead immune cells

656
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,360
which is really interesting

657
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,179
so

658
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,740
but then we're lowered immune system two

659
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,299
reasons why we have the lowered immune

660
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,460
system one is because our immune system

661
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:46,559
is working so hard eating all the junk

662
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,299
and garbage that we're breathing in or

663
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,919
getting exposed to

664
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:51,240
and the other

665
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,700
is

666
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,640
because it's just in the end takes time

667
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,799
to restore immune cells we stay low for

668
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,380
a while when that happens so when we're

669
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,299
exposed to something it could be a week

670
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,919
later two weeks later and we start

671
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,840
getting symptoms and then we're like

672
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,000
wondering why are we getting symptoms

673
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,640
like why am I getting symptoms what did

674
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,799
I do to two weeks ago what happened or

675
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,480
what did I do today is what it is so

676
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,460
people are like what did I do today what

677
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,200
did I do wrong

678
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,000
how come I'm kicked back a couple of

679
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,580
steps how come I don't feel good how

680
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,860
come I feel like I'm three steps back

681
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,020
four steps back what am I doing wrong

682
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,400
right now oh I had a celery juice this

683
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,679
morning maybe it was the celery juice

684
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,020
that did it no it was the fire and the

685
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,059
smoke and the stuff from a month ago

686
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,120
from three weeks ago it was an emotional

687
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,799
experience from a month ago it was from

688
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,480
that breakup from a month ago let's hit

689
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,559
other different let's triggers let's hit

690
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,679
a lot of different triggers let's go

691
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,679
there

692
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:53,880
here's some common triggers right here

693
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,980
lowers the immune system greatly mold is

694
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,500
one right there all on its own

695
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,419
you're exposed to mold extensive blood

696
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,820
draw I talk about that all the time you

697
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:05,220
guys right you have a blood test a month

698
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,279
ago and you're and you're literally

699
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,840
feeling that effect a month later talk

700
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,039
about that I'm not against blood tests

701
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,659
you guys know the whole blood draw

702
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,740
information for medical medium it's

703
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:16,740
really

704
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,740
comprehensive

705
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:23,220
hey W how important are supplements

706
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,260
while healing

707
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,840
well

708
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:31,320
let's cover that a little bit

709
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,080
I take supplements I'm under stress

710
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,600
I burn the Midnight Oil I've burned the

711
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,440
candle at both ends I mean that's what I

712
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,980
do

713
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,020
so I use supplements for sure if I was

714
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,000
somebody that was sick

715
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,440
if I had symptoms I would use

716
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,720
supplements

717
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,419
if somebody in my family was sick I

718
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,559
would have them doing supplements but it

719
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:54,600
depends on what supplements you're

720
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,820
talking about because there's a lot of

721
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,580
supplements out there that are not a

722
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,140
great thing not helpful they have all

723
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,820
those natural flavors in it all that

724
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,679
citric acid in it all the junk and

725
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,020
garbage into really low quality if

726
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,760
that's the case I mean I'm not thrilled

727
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,799
about taking stuff like that I don't

728
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,779
take stuff like that I'm very fortunate

729
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,700
lucky that there's a company out there

730
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:17,520
that puts the greatest stuff I've ever

731
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,159
seen out there for for people

732
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,440
but overall

733
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,940
if your suffering is struggling you've

734
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,860
got chronic fatigue syndrome you've got

735
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,419
aches and pains you've got brain fog you

736
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,000
got dizziness you've got ringing in the

737
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:31,679
ear you've got tinnitus you got vertigo

738
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
you got skin problems and everything

739
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,460
else

740
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,799
supplements are critical they are

741
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,620
and it all depends like when I say that

742
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:42,720
I'm not saying that just like hey you

743
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,700
know one size fits all out there just go

744
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,320
find supplements in the world I'm

745
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,880
talking about medical medium protocols

746
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,220
ask your doctor if the right for human

747
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,740
medical needing Protocols are critical

748
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,500
for people who are sick and struggling

749
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,240
for many years and that's why people use

750
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,679
medical meeting information they tried

751
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,120
everything they did that they tried

752
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,640
supplements out there they've tried

753
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,399
diets out there they've tried everything

754
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,679
and they still were sick so it's not

755
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:09,600
just about the loose term supplements

756
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,580
it's about the right tools The Details

757
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,080
Matter and that's critical supplements

758
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,179
that don't have alcohol in them

759
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,580
supplements that aren't toxic

760
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,380
supplements that aren't hiding

761
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,320
ingredients in them that you shouldn't

762
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:25,620
be consuming all of that matter so it's

763
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,080
a question that takes a lot of

764
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,100
information a lot of details to answer

765
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,840
it

766
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,640
but straightforward

767
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,799
if you're somebody who's really sick

768
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,320
you've been through hell and back

769
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,020
it's good to know where to start maybe

770
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,419
one or two supplements maybe something

771
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,980
that can be really helpful

772
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:46,860
and so yeah

773
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,919
The Details Matter David

774
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,760
so let's move through here a little bit

775
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,760
celery juice

776
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,299
that's a detail that matters

777
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,779
um something you know about celery juice

778
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,299
if you mix it with stuff if you're

779
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:05,100
putting lemon in it you're killing a

780
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:07,020
part of its power if you're adding water

781
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,880
to it ice you're killing a part of its

782
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,380
power don't add things to your celery

783
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,480
juice

784
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:18,539
celery juice is anti-viral antibacterial

786
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:24,600
Solid over time so you can digest those

787
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,000
proteins break them down kill off

788
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,340
pathogens that's mm info about HCL

789
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,679
killing off pathogens and bacteria and

790
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:34,860
all of that and

791
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,399
so celery juice if it's used right can

792
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:39,720
be so helpful for people

793
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:41,520

flush out toxins

817
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,240
because when we're breathing in poor air

818
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,980
quality like most of us on the planet

819
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,480
are breathing in poor air quality first

820
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,399
of all all of us on the planet breathe

821
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,179
in poor air quality

822
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,380
all of us I don't care where you are on

823
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:51,899
this planet

824
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,960
the air is circulating

825
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:57,899
you're not somewhere where the air

826
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,279
hasn't been somewhere else there's no

827
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,460
such thing

828
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,620
you're not in a dome or a bubble

829
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,440
somewhere where the only area breathing

830
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,480
is in that Dome or bubble

831
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,260
wherever you are on this planet you can

832
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,859
be on a crisp clean fresh Mountain Top

833
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,919
far away from civilization and you can

834
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:23,760
still be breathing in every single Sea

835
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,280
Trail and dust and garbage and junk and

836
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,500
everything else

837
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,080
easily and not realize it sure it's not

838
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,520
maybe cleaner than being up against that

839
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,859
junk in those pollutants and everything

840
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,580
but still there's nowhere on the planet

841
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:40,800
right now where you're you are free

842
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:43,020

843
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,179

00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,260

849
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,580

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,400
your quality is only bad here that would

853
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,619
be actually ridiculous it's bad

854
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,160
everywhere

855
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:10,440
heavy metal detox smoothie why heavy

856
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,980
metal detox movie because of the heavy

857
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,280
metals that are in the air sea trails

858
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:21,359
traveling pesticides DBT

859
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,300
right DBT also poor air quality from

860
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,900
fires remember the two bunny rabbits

861
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:31,380
that Lit the fire because they were cold

862
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:35,240
actually the real story is a deer was

863
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:35,240
playing with a pack of matches

864
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:39,300
so the deer had little deer hoofs and

865
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:41,579
was trying to

866
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,540
actually strike a match found a pack of

867
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:44,540
matches in the woods

868
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,520
you know and then it went up okay

869
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,260
extractor smoothie so back to the heavy

870
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,420
metal smoothie sorry about this it's

871
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,240
there to bring heavy metals out of the

872
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:01,020
body and other pollutants and toxins out

873
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,960
of the body so the scale gets tipped the

874
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,240
more goes in and doesn't leave us the

875
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,220
dirtier we get inside internally that's

876
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,540
liver included all of it our brain

877
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,599
included

878
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:15,180
and then the scale is tipped and then

879
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:18,680
something goes wrong and now we're like

880
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:22,020
visiting doctors visiting therapists

881
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,460
visiting psychiatrists because no one

882
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,980
really understands about our

883
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,839
neurological symptoms how we got Tremors

884
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,960

885
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,579
vibrating and our tongue Wiggles and our

886
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,079
eyeballs feel like they're vibrating and

887
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,720
we have a shooting pain in the back of

888
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,880
the head no matter how many MRIs and we

889
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,140
did all these things right you have all

890
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,000
the stuff next thing you know if you're

891
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,339

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,859
them that you got all the stuff

893
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:50,420
and they're like well

894
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:50,420
take all these drugs

895
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,700

896
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,140

PDF this free PDF

904
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,540
extractor smoothie

905
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,119
should never be underestimated it's very

906
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,579
powerful very potent

907
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,420
that's a great one there

908
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,640
um

909
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,560
so then there's the exposure shots also

910
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,820
in here too the toxic heavy metals

911
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,700
exposure shot

912
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,140
the Chemtrails exposure shot the

913
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,060
pesticide herbicide and fungicide

914
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,579
exposure shots

915
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,920
and so much more a couple of tips also I

916
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:40,740
want to say to you guys is extra leafy

917
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,180
greens that's a great one right there

918
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:47,400
so extra leafy greens is important

919
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,200
cilantro use it as a leafy green parsley

920
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,040
use it as a leafy green so those are

921
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,320
herbs that I love to use as leafy greens

922
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,540
spinach is a great one right there easy

923
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,940
one two you can do the medical medium

924
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,119
spinach soup you can use spinach in your

925
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,579
salads more spinach is better okay so

926
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,800
lettuces are great too but try to go

927
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:10,880
with those darker leafy greens and leafy

928
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,680
green herbs arugula parsley cilantro

929
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,440
incredible for detoxifying the body for

930
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,119
grabbing onto pollutants all kinds of

it's really incredible

945
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,579
so I want to make sure you guys have

946
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,560
these options empowerment is about

947
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,599
having information

948
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,780
and information that can help you heal

949
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,880
strengthen you help power you through

950
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,520
so it's not about fear or anything like

951
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,500
that we don't want to walk into

952
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,440
a storm

953
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:07,619
because we just don't fear it it's not

954
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,839
that if we have to walk into a storm we

955
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,780
want to know what we can do to support

956
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,520
our body and strengthen it as we're

957
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,680
walking into a storm and that's

958
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,720
important right there all of it

959
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,079
so here's a question right now how long

960
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,240
should we expect to feel detox symptoms

961
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,859
so keep in mind with a lot of people

962
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,160
okay

963
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:31,020
everybody's different in so many ways

964
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,420
somebody

965
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,220
could think they're having a detox

966
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:39,180
symptom

967
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:42,119
but they're dealing with a symptom

968
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:44,040
so that's important to know right there

969
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,260
somebody could be thinking they're doing

970
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,760
something that's making them detox but

971
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,460
they're not doing something that's

972
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,280
making them detox

973
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,680
keep that in mind too I've seen people

974
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,599
out there in the world right they've

975
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,099
seen people on social media saying

976
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,780
they're detoxing and then they talk

977
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:02,700
about what they're eating and doing in

978
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,220
them and looking at them like I don't

979
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,780
think you're doing some detoxing with

980
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,520
that right there

981
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,200
they're eating cheese or whatever it is

982
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,839
that they're eating

983
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,880
so there's so much misinformation about

984
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:17,160
detox I'm gonna do a podcast episode

985
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,820
just letting you know it's a word that's

986
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,640
way overused all the time by everybody

987
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,619
okay and it's way overused by people

988
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,140
outside of the medical medium

989
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:29,940
information so a lot of people be like

990
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,040
all medical medium does is talk about

991
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,380
detox that's kind of strange because

992
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,839
that's not what medical medium only

993
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,760
talks about so that's kind of a term

994
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,619
that's used out there in the world

995
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,780
throughout the years when someone

996
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,820
doesn't know why someone is sick and

997
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,339
what's happening to them medical name

998
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,300
info cleared the air with that by giving

999
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:51,780
people

1000
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,579
their information that allowed them to

1001
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,380
find out why they were sick and why they

1002
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,020
were struggling what these symptoms were

1003
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,180
and what was happening with their health

1004
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:03,000
that information was critical for people

1005
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:05,579
to heal but detox is thrown into

1006
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,160
everything now out there it's also a

1007
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,900
term that's used to sell products now so

1008
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,640
all you're going to do is hear the word

1009
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,400
detox out there

1010
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,859
because detox they're just they're

1011
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,339
basically aligning detox with products

1012
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:21,900
so everybody you know becomes like a

1013
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:24,900
sales pitch out there with the detox

1014
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:28,260
word so keep that in mind too

1015
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,660
but a lot of people don't realize it if

1016
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,200
they have a flare up with something or

1017
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:37,020
they were sick with something anyway

1018
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,480
they don't realize what's detox or not

1019
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,780
that's important to know I'm going to go

1020
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,720
into deep Hill on the whole process

1021
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,760
about detox a lot of people blame real

1022
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,400
symptoms on detox

1023
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,619
which is wrong it's not detox it's a

1024
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,720
symptom that was already there

1025
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:57,119
that's critical to know too so I'm just

1026
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,680
giving you little tidbits about detox

1027
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,780
but I see it all the time on social

1028
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,060
media I see people saying they're

1029
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,700
detoxing and then you're seeing what

1030
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:08,160
they're eating and

1031
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,859
then you're like okay

1032
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,920
um with what you're eating I don't know

1033
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:17,220
what kind of real detox you're doing

1034
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,280
because it's impossible to detox when

1035
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,680
you're on nuts and seeds it's impossible

1036
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,800
to detox when you're on nut Butters it's

1037
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,320
impossible to detox when you're on olive

1038
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,480
oil I'm not saying anything these things

1039
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,000
are good or bad so don't don't get

1040
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,099
scared I'm not saying that also people

1041
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,680
blame detox when really they are

1042
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:40,500
emotional because they are not drowning

1043
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,020
their emotions out

1044
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,640
so a lot of people have emotions that

1045
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,560
are surfacing

1046
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,780
because they're not suppressing those

1047
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,300
emotions with food

1048
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,160
so it's it's a tricky situation we can

1049
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,020
get into when we're doing Comfort Foods

1050
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,820
including vegan Comfort Foods out there

1051
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,900
I've seen a lot of intense vegan Comfort

1052
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,260
Foods

1053
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,560
we can suppress our emotions with eating

1054
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:07,680
no judgment It's Hard Out Here on planet

1055
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:11,040
Earth it's not an easy place to live

1056
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,960
and so we can easily suppress our

1057
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,540
emotions with food

1058
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,640
and that happens a lot with so many

1059
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:20,160
people so once you're taking some of

1060
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,200
those Foods away the emotions are just

1061
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,420
gonna pour out

1062
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,060
and it's like as they're starting to

1063
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,400
surface and pour out it's like we've got

1064
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,040
to get that food in us we gotta get that

1065
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,079
emotional food to suppress it that

1066
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,140
comfort food to suppress it

1067
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,119
program

1068
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,859
understandably so and rightfully so

1069
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,500
a lot of people have it really hard they

1070
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:46,800
lean on food completely understand I've

1071
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:49,920
seen this out there it's a normal human

1072
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,240
experience and a difficult one for so

1073
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,980
many people

1074
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:57,420
but

1075
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,760
that alone can create an emotional detox

1076
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,240
and that's really intense all on its own

1077
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,880
so detoxing is you can't patch it all in

1078
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,940
one word like it's detox it's detox it's

1079
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,819
detox there's a lot of there's a lot of

1080
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,140
people in health that don't know what's

1081
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:15,480
happening with there's a lot of people

1082
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,160
that work in the health space they have

1083
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,900
clients

1084
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,020
and there's a lot of health coaches that

1085
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,420
have clients and they don't know why no

1086
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:28,260
disrespect but they don't know why

1087
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,900
their client is having a symptom or

1088
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,140
their client is having something happen

1089
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,460
and so it's so easy just to say you're

1090
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,619
detoxing

1091
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,119
that's what it is you're detoxing that's

1092
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:40,260
what it is

1093
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,480
so

1094
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,180
it's kind of easy to do that

1095
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,400
I'm not and I'm not judging any health

1096
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:49,400
coach or anybody around that

1097
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:53,280
it's not what I'm doing I'm just saying

1098
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,020
it's an easy word

1099
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,940
to throw around

1100
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,300
and toss about

1101
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:02,819
one that's tossed about way too much in

1102
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,819
too many ways too many

1103
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:08,460
too many times so

1104
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:11,819
so is detoxification

1105
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,560
you know a real thing yes it is

1106
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:17,300
but it's such

1107
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:20,280
a mixed bag of nuts and there are people

1108
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:22,140
who don't know

1109
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,220
what's happening with their body or

1110
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,900
inside their body because they haven't

1111
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,180
been taught why they're sick and what

1112
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,680
their symptoms are and so they'll come

1113
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:34,260
across somebody that just tells them

1114
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:36,300
they're detoxing and it's like uh no

1115
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,940
I've seen this with friends I've seen

1116
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,420
this people I've known out there

1117
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,240
they did not know why they were sick and

1118
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,680
somebody told them it's detox it's like

1119
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,460
uh no

1120
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,400
um

1121
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,859
she's dealing with a viral infection

1122
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,599
so there's so many different levels of

1123
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:57,060
how it works so I'm just giving you a

1124
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,760
couple of tidbits but honestly it's it

1125
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,579
takes a podcast episode and we're just

1126
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,060
gonna have to jam pack that episode like

1127
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:08,520
to the Tilt because there's so many

1128
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:10,619
details around detox you're critical to

1129
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,140
know and critical to understand

1130
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:16,859
basically it's overused

1131
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:19,619
most of the time it's used for the wrong

1132
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:22,740
reasons most of the time it's just a

1133
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:26,099
word to paper over and blanket

1134
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:28,440
something someone doesn't understand

1135
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:33,240
and we have to be careful with that word

1136
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:35,280
detox and it's being used with selling

1137
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,619
products right now big time skin

1138
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,680
products facial products internal

1139
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:42,660
products body products

1140
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,780
hair products

1141
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,000
it's just a great term being thrown out

1142
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,099
it's being

1143
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,980
weaponized so it's another thing too is

1144
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:55,319
the word detox was being weaponized

1145
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,020
against kind of infiltrated into the

1146
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:59,940
medical meeting community

1147
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,740
it's not that I ever said detox isn't

1148
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,599
real or I never talked about detox

1149
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,760
before that's not true but it filtered

1150
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,859
into the medical mean community and

1151
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,220
became like a weapon

1152
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:13,680
and has confused a lot of people

1153
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,900
and so that's something that happens too

1154
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,280
A lot of times somebody might go through

1155
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:22,920
a serious emotional experience

1156
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,780
it lowered their immune system

1157
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,440
they had a flare-up

1158
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:30,540
and then someone said it's detox

1159
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,520
that's really common

1160
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,980
but really you went through an emotional

1161
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,720
experience a month ago

1162
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,099
and that emotional experience lowered

1163
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,720
your immune system now it's time to

1164
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:41,160
actually build that immune system up and

1165
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,079
do the right things but someone will say

1166
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,640
no it's detox stop everything you're

1167
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,980
doing

1168
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,440
that's something I've seen a lot and

1169
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:52,140
it's saddening I've seen people move

1170
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,359
forward move forward and then they get

1171
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,099
exposure to something or an emotional

1172
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:58,920
experience and exposure to something

1173
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:01,020
your immune system drops

1174
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,700
they get a little bit of a flare up and

1175
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,619
then someone who thinks it knows

1176
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,660
everything they'll say oh it's detox

1177
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,920
stuff everything and now they're getting

1178
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,420
worse because they stopped everything

1179
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,420
that was healing them to begin with

1180
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:15,240
because a lot of times when you're going

1181
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,880
through something you drown your

1182
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,980
people are drowning their feelings and

1183
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,020
body with adrenaline and comfort foods

1184
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,780
to override it so when we're up against

1185
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,640
stress and emotional abuse and emotional

1186
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,339
struggles

1187
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,859
all of that we drown our bodies with

1188
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:34,859
either adrenaline or adrenaline and food

1189
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:36,300
and we're pumped up with this and we get

1190
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:39,839
really toxic

1191
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:42,020
from all of that and so

1192
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:45,300
a lot of people don't realize and so

1193
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:47,400
detoxing yeah it's a real thing but like

1194
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,540
I said it's overused

1195
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,760
you know

1196
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,980
and you could feel good doing it too you

1197
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,440
can you can feel like whoa

1198
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,380
um I'm eating all this food and I feel

1199
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,940
good and everything else and we're we're

1200
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,220
suppressing everything that we're

1201
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,260
drowning ourselves with adrenaline from

1202
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,079
the comfort food so I just wanna

1203
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:10,740
let me put a little Clarity on that too

1204
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:12,420
when you eat a food that you've reframed

1205
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,880
from for a while

1206
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,319
because you know the food that food is

1207
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,000
probably not helping you you know that

1208
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,339
food is probably not that great but you

1209
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,500
refrain from that food for a while and

1210
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:24,060
then you eat that food you get an

1211
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,660
adrenaline rush

1212
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:30,599
an adrenaline Surge and you get euphoric

1213
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:32,040
from having that food

1214
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,380
and so

1215
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:37,200
then you think whoa I just stopped my

1216
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,240
detox but really

1217
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,819
you just got jacked up on a tremendous

1218
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,260
amount of adrenaline

1219
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:45,240
happens all the time I've seen people

1220
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,740
with chocolate the war of chocolate they

1221
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,540
have like a war with themselves the

1222
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,220
chocolate they have a chocolate drawer

1223
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,020
saying I like all their chocolate in

1224
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,579
here and they know not to have too much

1225
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,380
of it because they know they can get so

1226
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:56,640
jacked up from it but they stay away

1227
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,839
from that chocolate for a little while

1228
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,380
and then they go and they have that

1229
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,380
piece of chocolate

1230
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,260
they get euphoric and adrenaline floods

1231
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:07,079
them and they're like whoa I just broke

1232
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:10,079
a detox no you didn't break a detox

1233
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:13,140
you're saturated with adrenaline the

1234
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,660
cocoa butter the cacao butter any kind

1235
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,400
of fat can also saturate our bodies with

1236
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:21,240
adrenaline too that's another thing that

1237
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:24,180
happens chocolate will surge adrenaline

1238
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:26,760
and that gives you the feeling the

1239
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,680
euphoric a feeling right between the

1240
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,319
caffeine and the adrenaline both

1241
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,040
combined and you feel high and you're

1242
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,260
like

1243
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,079
I don't know why you know that feels so

1244
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:39,060
good I slowed down my detox I stopped my

1245
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,800
detox

1246
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,780
and then there's chemicals in food and

1247
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,180
natural flavors and food the MSG gives

1248
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,220
us a feeling too of like a euphoric

1249
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,020
addictive feeling that ends up surging

1250
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,579
or adrenaline too so when we stay away

1251
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,559
from those Foods

1252
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:54,780
we're really feeling

1253
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,880
how sick we really are and then when you

1254
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,380
bring some of these Foods back in you're

1255
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,119
like you get high for a moment you're

1256
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,980
like wait a minute I've seen people go

1257
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,200
on a massive

1258
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,540
a massive Indulgence

1259
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,760
where they're just they're just like oh

1260
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:12,300
my God I could eat everything I want now

1261
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:15,359
and I feel good but what you don't see a

1262
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:17,579
month later is they won't post on social

1263
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:20,220
media that they have tanked and they are

1264
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:22,020
feeling crappy again and their food took

1265
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,880
them down

1266
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,760
you won't see that

1267
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,559
coffee and matcha tea same thing a lot

1268
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,900
of times you'll see people where they're

1269
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,339
actually staying they're they're keeping

1270
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,440
to something they're keeping to a

1271
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,119
routine they're actually eating good

1272
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,880
they're keeping something maybe they're

1273
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,440
doing a medical medium 369 for a while

1274
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,119
maybe they're taking care of themselves

1275
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,859
and they're keeping out the garbage in

1276
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:45,540
the junk right they're keeping out the

1277
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:47,220
trigger foods they're keeping out the

1278
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,599
the brain rotting Foods the

1279
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,780
troublemakers and they're keeping all

1280
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:54,420
that out and then

1281
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,920
they start eating something they're back

1282
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,180
to eating a lot of cacao and they're

1283
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,680
back to eating something else they're

1284
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,599
back to eating pizza whatever it is and

1285
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,520
they feel you bork and high and they're

1286
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:04,980
on adrenaline and they feel amazing and

1287
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,480
they feel so good and they're like I

1288
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,819
should have been eating anything I ever

1289
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,500
wanted this is all I needed to do was

1290
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:12,660
just eat what I wanted and all my

1291
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,700
problems would be fine I don't know what

1292
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,300
I was doing I was detoxing all that time

1293
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:20,460
always detoxing I'm sick of detoxing and

1294
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,740
now I'm eating so good I'm eating sorry

1295
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,780
eating anything I want

1296
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,400
that medical medium was wrong or that

1297
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:30,059
medical medium person was wrong whatever

1298
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,400
it is and then like they're shooting out

1299
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:34,200
their posts like I feel good I just

1300
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,059
needed to do this I just needed this

1301
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,460
meditation and I could eat whatever I

1302
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:41,280
wanted I can just I just need this neuro

1303
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:42,839
realignment tool and I could just eat

1304
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,180
what I want

1305
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:46,800
and then what you don't see after you

1306
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,960
see all those posts you don't see a

1307
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:53,579
couple months later someone who's back

1308
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:55,200
on all of the medical medium stuff a

1309
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,420
morning cleanses the mono cleanses the

1310
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,040
heavy metal detox smoothies the 369s

1311
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,359
they're back on their celery juice

1312
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,260
they're back on all that but they're not

1313
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:02,460
going to go and correct everything

1314
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,780
because they're going to look like a

1315
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,220
so they're not going to go and and bite

1316
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,280
the bullet and go into a post saying you

1317
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:14,280
know what I actually had it wrong and

1318
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,020
now I'm back on MM stuff no one corrects

1319
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,339
it they never do it they just you never

1320
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,020
know what happens to them two months

1321
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:21,180
later

1322
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:23,280
and many people heal and then they go

1323
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,079
eat what they want and they get high on

1324
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,880
it

1325
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:29,099
and when you get high on it you think

1326
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,020
you're just like whoa

1327
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:33,420
and they end up just on what

1328
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:36,359
what they what got them better

1329
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:38,700
they end up on what got them

1330
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:40,740
better we're doing a little detox talk

1331
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:44,599

1332
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,599

about detox

1337
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,500
so many people heal with the medical

1338
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:58,520
medium information then go run around

1339
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,520
eat what they want

1340
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,900
and

1341
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,819
end up on everything that got

1342
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,140
them better in the first place I had to

1343
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:09,119

the medical medium podcast lately

1401
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,800
two

00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,700
will provide a light blast

1405
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,280
I'm actually really excited about that

1406
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,440
to be honest

1407
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,819
so get on the newsletter light blasts

1408
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,740
will be coming up go to

1409
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:39,720
medicalmedium.com so you can get on that

1410
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,880
light blast newsletter

1411
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,440
but you got me signed up she got to know

1412
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,119
when that light blast is happening and

1413
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:49,380
you got to get on there

1414
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:53,480
last time we had 20 plus thousand people

1415
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:57,540
is all our machine can handle technology

1416
00:56:53,480 --> 00:57:00,420
whatever can handle and we had to shut

1417
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:02,040
down the sign ups after one hour less

1418
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,660
than one hour

1419
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,640
um and we had twenty thousand signed

1420
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:08,760
twenty one thousand signups

1421
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,500
for um the weight loss medical medium

1422
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,300
white blast I think if we open we're

1423
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,819
trying to set up the technology so we

1424
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,559
can open The Floodgate and not just have

1425
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:18,780
to shut it down to one hour we can open

1426
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,880
up The Floodgate for the light Blast for

1427
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:23,160
multiple hours and we'll probably get 60

1428
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,380
or 80 000 people and so forth and that's

1429
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,720
what we want to be able to have the

1430
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,280
machine ready for a lot of people to get

1431
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:32,640
the light glass

1432
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,200
machine meaning technology so that

1433
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,940

1434
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:40,319
