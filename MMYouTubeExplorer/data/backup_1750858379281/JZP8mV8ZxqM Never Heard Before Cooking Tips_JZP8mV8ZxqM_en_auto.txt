[373.20 - 376.56] so here's a tip right here about
[374.40 - 378.88] mushrooms that you guys need to know i'd
[376.56 - 380.72] love to give you this tip okay
[378.88 - 382.64] so a couple of things about mushrooms
[380.72 - 385.68] that are really important okay the
[382.64 - 387.20] bottom of the stem if you see any green
[385.68 - 389.20] at the bottom of the stem
[387.20 - 391.84] you don't want that whole that whole box
[389.20 - 393.36] of mushrooms needs to be tossed out
[391.84 - 396.00] that's one thing right there here's a
[393.36 - 398.80] tip that's really good if the mushroom's
[396.00 - 400.88] pitted a little bit if it's pitted at
[398.80 - 402.64] all like you're starting to pit
[400.88 - 403.92] in different spots you see where it's
[402.64 - 406.16] pit pitting a little bit and you're
[403.92 - 408.64] getting too much color change
[406.16 - 410.88] it's oxidizing you don't want to use
[408.64 - 413.60] that mushroom pick another mushroom that
[410.88 - 416.32] mushroom's oxidizing that means
[413.60 - 420.64] that means the cells in the mushroom are
[416.32 - 422.48] dying rapidly and creating a toxin so
[420.64 - 424.00] with toxins being created so i'm just
[422.48 - 426.08] giving you a little bit more on that the
[424.00 - 427.76] pitted the whole pitted thing that's
[426.08 - 429.84] that's that's a tip all on its own right
[427.76 - 431.12] there that's really important two
[429.84 - 432.72] another thing you want to know how fresh
[431.12 - 434.88] your mushroom is you just look at the
[432.72 - 437.60] bottom of the stem and you see how beat
[434.88 - 439.92] up or shot at the very bottom the stem
[437.60 - 441.36] is right that's another tip too and some
[439.92 - 442.48] of these tips you know i have shown
[441.36 - 444.72] people throughout the year some of them
[442.48 - 446.00] i haven't shown it's important to know
[444.72 - 448.72] right
[446.00 - 450.24] so another tip too is people are just
[448.72 - 451.84] worried about if the mushroom's wet and
[450.24 - 453.36] slimy right what if the mushroom's wet
[451.84 - 455.68] so that's something people know about
[453.36 - 458.56] that don't have a slimy mushroom don't
[455.68 - 460.72] work with the slimy mushroom okay but
[458.56 - 464.40] keep in mind though that's not the big
[460.72 - 467.28] issue you can wash that slime off the
[464.40 - 469.04] big issue is if it's pitting
[467.28 - 471.52] that is the key
[469.04 - 473.84] it's not the mushroom being slimy on top
[471.52 - 475.92] that you can wash off with hot water
[473.84 - 478.80] another tip too wash your mushrooms off
[475.92 - 480.80] with hot water that's another tip wash
[478.80 - 482.48] them off with hot water
[480.80 - 484.08] that's a key that's that's an important
[482.48 - 485.20] key right there because here's here's
[484.08 - 487.68] why
[485.20 - 489.84] because if there's any bacteria on the
[487.68 - 491.92] mushroom at all
[489.84 - 493.84] cold water is not going to cover it it's
[491.92 - 495.20] not going to take care of it
[493.84 - 496.48] because people chop them up they throw
[495.20 - 498.24] them in their salads they throw their
[496.48 - 500.56] portabellas in their salads right you
[498.24 - 502.80] guys and if you just wash your mushrooms
[500.56 - 504.32] off with cool water
[502.80 - 506.56] that's not going to be enough you could
[504.32 - 508.80] easily get some bacteria that was in the
[506.56 - 511.12] manure like some e coli
[508.80 - 513.36] or anything that's on the mushroom so
[511.12 - 515.04] you want to wash with hot water coming
[513.36 - 516.64] out of the sink so you've got the hot
[515.04 - 518.64] water coming down in the sink and you're
[516.64 - 520.56] washing your mushrooms you wash them in
[518.64 - 522.72] hot water that's important doesn't have
[520.56 - 525.60] to be scolding hot lorraine elsa's great
[522.72 - 527.28] tips doesn't have to be scolding hot
[525.60 - 528.24] because you can get some bacteria i'm

[528.24 - 531.20] bunch of mushroom dips real quick and

[581.12 - 586.40] because the mushroom's oxidizing and
[583.20 - 589.52] when mushroom oxidizes it's more toxic

[636.72 - 639.52] watching somebody cooking or something
[638.24 - 640.56] cooking show or anything i always say
[639.52 - 642.24] hey wait a minute why don't you tell
[640.56 - 644.32] them about that tip i know and then i
[642.24 - 645.84] realized of course they don't know it
[644.32 - 647.20] the best chefs in the world don't know
[645.84 - 649.28] the tip that's why they don't tell
[647.20 - 650.80] anybody so it's important to know this
[649.28 - 653.52] stuff right so i just gave you a couple
[650.80 - 655.84] mushroom tips one is wash them in hot
[653.52 - 657.68] water that's how you can get the food
[655.84 - 660.64] poisoning if you don't wash them in hot
[657.68 - 662.16] water with mushrooms manure gets trapped
[660.64 - 664.40] in there and it doesn't come out so the
[662.16 - 666.56] hot water can really shock and kill e
[664.40 - 667.68] coli or anything like that that's
[666.56 - 669.76] important
[667.68 - 672.24] the other thing is the pitted the pits
[669.76 - 674.48] in the mushrooms means it's oxidizing
[672.24 - 676.56] and mushrooms are more toxic when they
[674.48 - 678.08] oxidize than other foods so that's just
[676.56 - 680.56] the mushroom tips off the running right
[678.08 - 682.72] there okay so we cover that boom you
[680.56 - 684.48] guys want to know i just made the potato
[682.72 - 685.92] mini pizzas and i want to show you right
[684.48 - 687.36] there on tick tock
[685.92 - 690.32] i want to show you here
[687.36 - 691.60] yes show you on telegram rumble potato
[690.32 - 692.88] mini pizzas
[691.60 - 694.56] awesome
[692.88 - 696.40] they're really good i eat two of them in
[694.56 - 698.00] between or during the whole thing so i
[696.40 - 699.92] want to give you some zucchini tips now
[698.00 - 701.52] some of the medical medium
[699.92 - 704.40] community
[701.52 - 706.72] people right some of you guys know i've
[704.40 - 709.20] always said this all the time
[706.72 - 712.16] why do i have missing pieces in my
[709.20 - 713.36] zucchini why's your missing pieces
[712.16 - 715.28] okay
[713.36 - 717.60] there's missing pieces
[715.28 - 720.56] because i cut them out
[717.60 - 722.80] the reason why i cut them out
[720.56 - 724.40] is because it happens to almost
[722.80 - 727.76] everybody out there
[724.40 - 728.84] very few people escape this
[727.76 - 730.40] there's
[728.84 - 732.40] bacteria
[730.40 - 735.44] in the spots people's nails have
[732.40 - 737.44] scratched the skin on zucchini is really
[735.44 - 738.96] thin when you're in the grocery store
[737.44 - 740.96] everybody touches zucchini and their
[738.96 - 742.40] nails go in there and that's it boom
[740.96 - 744.08] their nails go in there and they usually
[742.40 - 745.04] even take their nails take divots away
[744.08 - 746.64] like that
[745.04 - 748.16] you'll see it in the store all the
[746.64 - 751.12] zucchinis have these things going in
[748.16 - 753.84] them and the basically that's incubated
[751.12 - 755.28] bacteria and viruses from people's hands
[753.84 - 757.20] in the grocery store they're touching
[755.28 - 759.60] the shopping carts their hands are
[757.20 - 760.80] loaded with bad bacteria and viruses and
[759.60 - 762.56] what do they do
[760.80 - 764.48] they go and they grab the zucchinis and
[762.56 - 765.92] their nails just go into the zucchinis
[764.48 - 768.32] and they're pawing through them and all
[765.92 - 771.12] the zucchinis get all eaten up like that
[768.32 - 773.60] so what you do is you find those spots
[771.12 - 775.36] and you cut them out
[773.60 - 776.40] especially if you're going to eat those
[775.36 - 779.12] raw
[776.40 - 781.52] if you wash them really good to eat them
[779.12 - 782.88] raw it's not going to help
[781.52 - 784.16] you want to wash them good but it's not
[782.88 - 786.96] going to help
[784.16 - 789.52] because the fingernail went in through
[786.96 - 791.52] the skin and put it underneath so you
[789.52 - 793.76] can wash them all you want it's not
[791.52 - 795.68] going to help you got to cut those spots
[793.76 - 796.80] out that's a tip right there i talked
[795.68 - 798.24] about
[796.80 - 800.24] right there give you another tip let's
[798.24 - 801.84] talk about the onion a little bit let's
[800.24 - 804.48] do that
[801.84 - 806.00] all right so we have an onion here
[804.48 - 807.60] talk onion
[806.00 - 810.08] a little bit of the onions
[807.60 - 810.80] onion talk going on right
[810.08 - 812.56] so
[810.80 - 814.88] let's go here if you guys just came on
[812.56 - 818.08] here i'm talking about never before
[814.88 - 819.92] heard tips medical medium
[818.08 - 822.64] on the medical medium cooking show
[819.92 - 824.80] that's on amazon live i just did it an
[822.64 - 826.32] hour ago i'm doing it once a week
[824.80 - 828.32] somewhere around like once a week the
[826.32 - 831.12] cooking show on amazon i'm gonna be
[828.32 - 832.56] cooking and making food raw food cook
[831.12 - 834.40] food all of it
[832.56 - 837.52] but i'm gonna be sharing tips you've
[834.40 - 839.76] never heard anywhere anyhow private tips
[837.52 - 841.68] i haven't had even time to actually
[839.76 - 843.92] share with anybody because i'm so busy
[841.68 - 845.36] fighting all you know the disease the
[843.92 - 846.32] illness and the chronic illness out
[845.36 - 848.40] there
[846.32 - 850.40] and and writing the books for all that
[848.40 - 851.92] right so let's talk about the zucchini a
[850.40 - 853.36] little bit more
[851.92 - 854.24] so i have a zucchini in my hand right
[853.36 - 855.68] here
[854.24 - 856.48] okay
[855.68 - 859.04] now
[856.48 - 861.36] what you'll notice is the flower
[859.04 - 864.08] you have the stem part where the
[861.36 - 865.28] zucchini actually breaks off the plant
[864.08 - 867.20] okay you guys
[865.28 - 869.60] it breaks off the plant now i cut that
[867.20 - 871.84] stem part off because it's hard
[869.60 - 873.68] it was getting hard and i cut it off now
[871.84 - 875.92] if you have a zucchini that's young
[873.68 - 877.52] enough tender enough you can cook that
[875.92 - 879.04] stem to be nice and juicy and good but
[877.52 - 881.36] here's the thing
[879.04 - 882.40] it's the butt you want to cut off the
[881.36 - 884.08] butt
[882.40 - 886.40] because that little piece right there
[884.08 - 888.56] gets really hard
[886.40 - 889.84] and people with teeth problems even if
[888.56 - 891.60] they have strong teeth or think they
[889.84 - 893.36] have strong teeth people with teeth
[891.60 - 895.36] problems over
[893.36 - 897.68] actually bite into that
[895.36 - 898.88] and now they lose a filling they lose a
[897.68 - 901.20] cap
[898.88 - 903.28] they mess up a tooth they crack a tooth
[901.20 - 905.04] it's kind of like the olive pit syndrome
[903.28 - 906.64] i talk about you you know you you're
[905.04 - 908.40] biting in olive and boom there was a pit
[906.64 - 910.64] in there and now you're just totally
[908.40 - 913.28] you're totally bad off right
[910.64 - 915.20] so you want to cut that hard butt off
[913.28 - 917.36] because that's where the flower was and
[915.20 - 918.80] it hardens sometimes it hardens like a
[917.36 - 922.00] stone
[918.80 - 924.80] and people always mess up their teeth
[922.00 - 927.76] because of that little tiny button on
[924.80 - 929.12] the back of the zucchini right there so
[927.76 - 930.96] that's a cool tip right there that could
[929.12 - 932.16] actually save you a big hassle boom it
[930.96 - 934.16] came off
[932.16 - 936.16] that's it right there
[934.16 - 939.28] okay took that off
[936.16 - 941.04] so that's a zucchini tip that um but i
[939.28 - 942.24] did a lot more tips like i can't cover
[941.04 - 943.68] them all right now but let me let me

[1049.60 - 1054.56] the channels i'm doing this amazon live

[1059.36 - 1064.08] more tips more answers more everything
[1061.84 - 1066.48] with that so it's important so let's
[1064.08 - 1069.28] talk about the onion a little bit
[1066.48 - 1070.88] so you got the onion right here okay
[1069.28 - 1072.56] so
[1070.88 - 1074.40] sweetest part of the onion
[1072.56 - 1076.48] which nobody knows
[1074.40 - 1079.36] is closer to the top of the onion where
[1076.48 - 1082.16] the onion was growing meaning where the
[1079.36 - 1084.72] onion was sprouting out that's the
[1082.16 - 1086.64] sweetest spot so when you pull the onion
[1084.72 - 1090.08] out of the ground right when you pull it
[1086.64 - 1092.16] out by the green tops okay
[1090.08 - 1094.48] right and they cut the green tops off
[1092.16 - 1097.20] and then this seals right here that's
[1094.48 - 1099.68] the sweet part of the onion it's closer
[1097.20 - 1102.48] here so the worst part of the onion the
[1099.68 - 1105.28] most bitter part of the onion
[1102.48 - 1108.48] is the bottom where the roots were
[1105.28 - 1110.00] the bottom where the roots were
[1108.48 - 1114.00] that's the
[1110.00 - 1116.48] the more astringent not so sweet not so
[1114.00 - 1118.40] tasty part of the onion is
[1116.48 - 1120.32] keep that in mind you can use the whole
[1118.40 - 1123.04] onion without a doubt you can use the
[1120.32 - 1125.76] whole onion right so here i am
[1123.04 - 1127.68] i'm cutting this part off
[1125.76 - 1129.44] you can use the whole onion nothing
[1127.68 - 1131.92] wrong with that and here's the top of
[1129.44 - 1133.60] the onion right here
[1131.92 - 1134.48] that i'm cutting off
[1133.60 - 1135.92] okay
[1134.48 - 1137.04] so here's the next thing you know i mean
[1135.92 - 1139.12] first of all i was talking about right
[1137.04 - 1140.80] there now the best part of the onion to
[1139.12 - 1142.56] work off of
[1140.80 - 1145.20] the best heat because you you might be
[1142.56 - 1147.68] making food for family friends you might
[1145.20 - 1149.52] making food for people right
[1147.68 - 1153.04] and the best part of the onion to work
[1149.52 - 1155.28] off of in the meals is off the top side
[1153.04 - 1157.20] going all the way down in right that's
[1155.28 - 1159.20] the tastiest part because someone may be
[1157.20 - 1162.08] like yeah okay you made me a salad but
[1159.20 - 1164.72] it wasn't that tasty or it was okay or
[1162.08 - 1166.08] i'm sensitive with onions i like onions
[1164.72 - 1167.68] but i'm a little sensitive with onions
[1166.08 - 1169.36] sometimes and what's really happening
[1167.68 - 1171.36] too is you're they're getting the worst
[1169.36 - 1172.72] part of the onion in their food so
[1171.36 - 1175.84] that's important to know right there i'm
[1172.72 - 1177.20] peeling back the onion a little bit
[1175.84 - 1180.16] so the best part of the onion is that
[1177.20 - 1182.72] top part another little tip too
[1180.16 - 1184.00] anytime you see anything brown in the
[1182.72 - 1186.16] onion
[1184.00 - 1187.68] toss the whole onion
[1186.16 - 1190.24] don't risk it
[1187.68 - 1191.52] because the onions going bad
[1190.24 - 1192.96] going bad
[1191.52 - 1194.64] rotten onion
[1192.96 - 1196.08] is the worst it can destroy a whole meal
[1194.64 - 1198.00] and i talked about that tip all on its
[1196.08 - 1199.52] own but you don't know it's wrong it
[1198.00 - 1202.08] looks good it might but it has a little
[1199.52 - 1204.56] brown spot or it has one ring
[1202.08 - 1206.40] one ring is getting brown in there after
[1204.56 - 1208.00] you cut it one ring
[1206.40 - 1210.08] the other rings look good
[1208.00 - 1212.16] but one ring's getting bad toss the
[1210.08 - 1214.32] onion don't even save it can ruin an
[1212.16 - 1216.16] entire meal or an entire meal for a
[1214.32 - 1217.60] family you're making it for whatever a
[1216.16 - 1218.96] couple little tips on the onion right
