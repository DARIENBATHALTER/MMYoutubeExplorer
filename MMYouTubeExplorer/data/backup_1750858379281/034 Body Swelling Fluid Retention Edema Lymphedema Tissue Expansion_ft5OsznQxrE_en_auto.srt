later and right when they see each other

62
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,200
that's a conversation that has happened

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,560
a lot where one guy he don't care he'll

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,080
just say it because it's a buddy of his

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,480
he'll even laugh about it and then he'll

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,840
just get a drink but he'll say what

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,440
happened to you man like what's going on

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,680
are you seeing the right doctor are you

69
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,000
watching your weight and it doesn't even

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,560
mean they're

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,560
overweight what happens is when we swell

72
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,080
we change as the years go on and our

73
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,080
heads get bigger even our chest can get

74
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,840
bigger our frame can get bigger but it's

75
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,680
not supposed to get bigger but it does

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,040
so it's not just their head gets bigger

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,400
but their nose gets bigger did you ever

78
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,879

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,760
it's two times bigger than it was or

80
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,480
three times bigger than it was or it

81
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,879
gets really bulbous lots of veins on

82
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,319
there to or just red did you ever see a

83
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:03,319

it's all all swollen and big cheeks all

85
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,680
swollen and you also see it in people's

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,079
faces and heads where it's almost like

87
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,239
even above their eyes their foreheads

88
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,919
swell out their ears get bigger they

89
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:21,120
even get red it's like it happens over

90
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,040
time as the years go by two or three

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,680
years another two or three years 10

92
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,160
years later 15 years and it just

93
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,120
develops it's like some kind of

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,680
metamorphosis you know you might be

95
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,680
thinking well yeah sure when someone

96
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,840
gets overweight everything's just going

97
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,120
to get bigger but I'm not talking about

98
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,880
that I'm not talking about weight yes

99
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,800
you can have weight you can be

100
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,800
overweight and still have this

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,800
additional problem but this is a

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,400
separate

103
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,560
problem you could be thin and everything

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,680
just gets thick widens out and

105
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,000
everything just gets big including your

106
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,280
head everything and not be overweight

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,960
yes you can have EX excess weight and

108
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,639
this additional swelling problem of

109
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,440
things just kind of

110
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:12,560
enlarging because that's what it really

111
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,960
is everything's enlarging it's

112
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,240
swelling but it's not just in

113
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:23,319
intermittent or acute swelling that

114
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,639
happened at one time it's a slow slow

115
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:29,560
development and you can't see it you

116
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,520
just live your life and it happens every

117
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,240
every single day now there are people

118
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,759
that see any kind of

119
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,400
subtleties women see subtleties they see

120
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,319
if they're swelling a little bit or it

121
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,199
goes down but that could be bloating and

122
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:48,520
fluid retention see people can have flu

123
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,560
retention for years they expand with

124
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,199
fluid retention they feel like they have

125
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,880
fluid retention they feel the swelling

126
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,120
women feel that and then it goes down

127
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,880
then it goes up goes down but that's

128
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,800
separate that's sep separate than a

129
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,199
thickening an expansion of tissue that

130
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,960
happens over time as the years go on a

131
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,599
thickening is different than lymphatic

132
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,479
fluid buildup where you're swelling a

133
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:18,479
little bit you go to the lymphatic

134
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,759
massage therapist get some work done you

135
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,919
feel better for a couple days and then

136
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,039
it starts all over again and you're up

137
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,800
and down little bit of swelling fluid

138
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,960
retention and then it goes down little

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,479
bit of swelling

140
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,080
goes down you have a little too much

141
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,479
salt goes up you eat a little too much

142
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,199
party food goes up don't eat for a half

143
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,919
a day goes down go see the lymphatic

144
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,599
massage therapist goes down and then it

145
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,840
just does this thing and you play this

146
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,960
game this is different because you can

147
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,520
play that game live your life but

148
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,800
there's this other thing happening as

149
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,800
the years are going on it's this

150
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,160
thickening of connective

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,160
tissue this widening that happens

152
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,639
we just start expanding and still you

153
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,479
can have that fluid retention still you

154
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,039
can go to see your massage therapist and

155
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,840
lymphatic drainage massage can still do

156
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,759
all that but you're still getting wider

157
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,960
and it doesn't mean it's weight it

158
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,520
doesn't mean it's fat or anything like

159
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,440
you're gaining all this weight of course

160
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,400
you can have that too you can be

161
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,800
somebody that's gaining weight so you're

162
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,560
moving up on the weight and you have the

163
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,720
fluid retention and swelling

164
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,400
and your thickening which is a different

165
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,400
thing and we're talking about the body

166
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,599
widening and thickening the connective

167
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,080
tissue and the joints and everything

168
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,240
expanding there are people who get their

169
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,039
lymphatic

170
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,240
massage for years decades and as the

171
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,639
years go by they get it they're eating

172
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,879
pretty good they're eating pure enough

173
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,360
they don't eat a lot of processed foods

174
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,199
a lot of times they'll go on a healthy

175
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,800
keto diet or even a healthy vegetarian

176
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,199
diet or healthy vegan diet they care

177
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,400
about their health they exercise

178
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,680
regularly they take care of themselves

179
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,479
they sleep good they try to get 10 hours

180
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,840
of sleep every night and they're back to

181
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,080
the massage therapist and they're

182
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,560
getting wider as the years go on thicker

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,759
as the years go on you see a photograph

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,039
of them when they were 25 years old and

185
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,080
then you see them when they're 45 years

186
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:28,479
old something's changed and it's not

187
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,680
about aging has nothing to do with aging

188
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,800
just that by the time they got to 45

189
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,000
years old something

190
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,479
happened something happened within their

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,320
body some kind of transformation occurs

192
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,600
everything thickened up and widened and

193
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,720
it wasn't aging that did this and all

194
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,040
these years they did their fluid

195
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,240
retention Management program the fluid

196
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,600
retention Management program was

197
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,640
caffeine a diuretic always kind of

198
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,120
peeing out all their fluid not staying

199
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,920
that hydrated all those years so they

200
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,720
didn't have that much water because

201
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,920
they're kind of afraid of it they're at

202
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,200
their massage therapist they're at their

203
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,920
lymphatic massage therapist and they're

204
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,920
afraid to crank in all the water because

205
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,399
they feel like they're just going to

206
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,160
balloon up so they done all this

207
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,480
management over the years including

208
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,040
things like body wraps all kinds of

209
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,480
massages different diets different

210
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,440
exercise programs dry brushing INF red

211
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,920
sauna steam

212
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,440
saunas Steam Baths all these things but

213
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,279
as time goes on it was just management

214
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,680
as the years go by managing yes

215
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,519
sometimes their vices little alcohol

216
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,519
when they want to sometimes too salty or

217
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,240
greasy oily foods but they were managing

218
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,320
and taking care of themselves in between

219
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,600
it all and doing that lymphatic drainage

220
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,200
Mage constantly and as the years gone by

221
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,240
something still happened and it was

222
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Unstoppable for some reason they just

223
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,040
got thick and their head

224
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,680
enlarged not just their head thickened

225
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,120
up but their body thickened up even

226
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,320
their feet thickened up but why well

227
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,959
we're going to head there in a little

228
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,320
bit we still got a lot more to talk

229
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,760
about and what I notice right now is

230
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
that young people people in their 20s

231
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,720
that are into Health are doing the

232
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,240
lymphatic drainage they're going to see

233
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,000
the massage therapist they're getting

234
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,200
lymphatic drainage done and they think

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,560
they found the Holy Grail now I support

236
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,240
lymphatic drainage I support massage

237
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,639
therapy I think it's one of the greatest

238
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:46,279
things out there but it's been out there

239
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:49,800
it's already been out there it's not new

240
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:53,079
we already have Decades of women using

241
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:56,519
this management tool and still by the

242
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,760
time they turn 40 it could be subtle but

243
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,720
there is a thickening happening to the

244
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,279
tissue tissue connective tissue to the

245
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,120
joints sometimes it's more noticeable as

246
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,760
it's happening throughout the years and

247
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:13,800
it's not so subtle but it could be

248
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:16,160
passed off as excess weight gain so if

249
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,120
weight is gaining it's like well no it's

250
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,120
cuz I'm gaining too much weight so then

251
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,079
when you try to lose the weight you

252
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,680
obviously thin out a little bit and see

253
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:28,639
think that must be it but there's this

254
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,120
other thing happening within it all this

255
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,800
actual ual tissue expansion that's

256
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,800
occurring but when you're young and

257
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,880
you're just dealing with some bloating

258
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,440
and you want to look your best and feel

259
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,920
your best and you don't feel that great

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,880
and you're into Health it's easy to be

261
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,839
like oh my God my lymphatic drainage

262
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,600
massage it's the greatest I'm so happy

263
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,720
let me go on social media I'll do a post

264
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,040
about it now and talk about it and then

265
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,880
it Trends and today since swelling is

266
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,240
becoming so big so many people are

267
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,000
swelling out there by the millions

268
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,240
because it's becoming an actual symptom

269
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,760
and condition that's happening to

270
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,320
everybody that social media is blowing

271
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,040
up about lymphatic drainage and

272
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,639
lymphatic massage for your swelling but

273
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,040
no one's saying that we've had

274
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,519
Generations before all of them before

275
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,680
the young people that already did it

276
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,880
been there and done that years of

277
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,880
lymphatic drainage to try to manage and

278
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,720
as the years went by their tissue

279
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,360
expanded and these same Generations also

280
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,880
did the body wraps they did the dry

281
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,800
brushing they did different diet

282
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,639
programs they intermittent fasted they

283
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,880
waved back and forth vacillated from

284
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,320
eating to not eating but what's the real

285
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,880
reason we're swelling and need a

286
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,680
lymphatic massage what's the real reason

287
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,920
to begin with the lymphatic massage is

288
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,880
not the real reason you're swelling to

289
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,800
start with that's just a a Band-Aid

290
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,680
until you swell again a day later or 3

291
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,680
days later or a week later what caused

292
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,360
the swelling allowing you to have to go

293
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,959
get a lymphatic drainage massage you

294
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,160
know what's crazy is according to

295
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,800
alternative medicine and conventional

296
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,760
Medicine Science which they teach a lot

297
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,959
of professionals is that the body

298
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,240
cleanses itself so you don't need to

299
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,199
cleanse or to do a cleanse or to do an

300
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,160
actual juice or anything because your

301
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:33,399
body takes care of itself but those same

302
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,560
people same professionals say oh you

303
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,560
better go get a massage you better go

304
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,360
get a lymphatic massage so basically you

305
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,120
become a te on a cow where you have to

306
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,360
be milked every other day because your

307
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,920
body can't do it itself but I'm confused

308
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,519
here cuz they say your body cleanses

309
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,160
itself so why are they then telling you

310
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,920
to go get a lymphatic drainage massage

311
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,199
if your body cleanses perfectly

312
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,199
naturally all on its own and why do we

313
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,160
need a manual squeeze you lay there on a

314
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:11,160
table and somebody has to push and

315
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,079
squeeze and massage and rub anywhere

316
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,399
they can find that feels a little bit

317
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:18,600
more swollen especially anything

318
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,600
lymphatic that they can actually access

319
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,199
I've always been supportive of lymphatic

320
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,000
drainage massage and massage and but

321
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:30,240
I've also been mindful that it's a

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,320
luxury because not everybody has $100 a

323
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,920
week or $100 every 3 days or two days to

324
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,040
get it done or the time maybe they're

325
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,880
busy a lot of demands in life they're

326
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,040
working hard maybe they don't have the

327
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,120
excess cash maybe it's not a resource

328
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,800
that they have to do but yet on social

329
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,240
media of course I see a lot of people

330
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,120
like just had my drainage massage it was

331
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,519
incredible I'm going to get it again in

332
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,399
a couple days I'm going to get it next

333
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,680
week and and my massage therapist wants

334
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,399
me there five times a month six times a

335
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,040
month and I'm adding it up and I'm like

336
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,800
some massage therapy now it's like $150

337
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,519
some is like $60 if you're lucky but

338
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,120
lymphatic drainage somewhere Falls in

339
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,800
that area where okay well it's five

340
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,040
times a month or six times a month if

341
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,440
you have that resource to manage things

342
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,040
incredible but I'm always about getting

343
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,000
down to the actual problem fixing the

344
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,319
root the root cause of why this SW is

345
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,399
happening all the time and again we're

346
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:36,399
just managing so we're not fixing the

347
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:39,759
root problem because as each year goes

348
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,480
by the tissue expansion is developing

349
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,040
and that's not being stopped by a

350
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,720
lymphatic massage and that's not being

351
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,199
stopped by a regular massage that's

352
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,759
helping with managing fluid retention

353
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,839
but it's not stopping that thickening

354
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:57,680
that happens with everybody as they're

355
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,399
getting older each year goes by and each

356
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,560
decade goes by and everything just

357
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:05,360
starts to expand and get bigger I posted

358
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,880
a video about edema and swelling and

359
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,519
it's pretty interesting I would love to

360
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,399
read you some of the comments I thought

361
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,600
the head getting larger was part of

362
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,560
middle age it's so unattractive a person

363
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,920
responds I know someone who started

364
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,240
having this problem in their early 30s

365
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,920
age is not a factor in some cases here's

366

fasting and minimum eating of carbs and

running helps and then Barbie says

439
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,480
running genuinely does help even if it's

440
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:48,200
10 minutes a day and then I've always

441

442
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,880

459
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,400
something that has also been prevalent

460
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,320

my legs swell in the summer so what can

465
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,919
we conclude from these comments to begin

466
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,039
with everybody's swelling or has some

467
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,600
type of flute retention problem and

468
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:59,320
they're struggling but what was their

469
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,320
Solutions like all their Wise

470
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:07,400
information to help others one was just

471
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,360
don't eat that's one like go 20 3 hours

472
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,720
without eating well I don't know if

473
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,720
that's going to work for people who got

474
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,640
to work a job or if they have a

475
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,200
demanding schedule um let's see what was

476
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:22,080
another one okay eat lots of grass-fed

477
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,080
beef and ghee and olive oil oh that's a

478
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,320
stomach ache I'm already feeling when I

479
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,559
think about that because they were like

480
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,520
don't eat any vegetables

481
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,799
okay so so if I was needing help and I

482
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,440
went on that thread and I was like well

483
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,360
I need to find some help in here okay so

484
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,880
don't eat any vegetables but eat a lot

485
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,840
of ghee a lot of people just stopped

486
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,400
eating is is that the best way to go

487
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,640
just stop eating it's not sustainable

488
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,520
really because it's a roller coaster

489
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,240
ride as some of them stay they just had

490
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,320
no energy and it was really hard to do

491
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,880
and intermittent fasting may not not be

492
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,600
the best route there's a lot of

493
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,039
drawbacks and it's not easy to do check

494
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,480
out my podcast episode on intermittent

495
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,200
fasting it's almost 2 hours and it's

496
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,679
highly informative now when somebody's

497
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,679
swelling and they say they're swelling

498
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,120
is it the same swelling that someone

499
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,279
else is going through is it the same

500
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,360
swelling somebody else has or if

501
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,400
somebody's bloating and they feel kind

502
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,720
of swollen is it the same bloating and

503
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,840
swelling as someone else

504
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,039
or when someone says their hands are

505
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,600
swollen like their fingers are swollen

506
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,880
and their joints feel a little bit

507
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,200
swollen is that the same as somebody

508
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,919
else's

509
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,400
bloating or is it all the same or is it

510
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,799
really different well there isn't a

511
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,320
one-size fits-all here everybody does

512
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,440
have different nuances

513
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,120
subtleties different reasons for

514
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:59,120
bloating different types of swelling

515
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,559
some people bloat in their digestive

516
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,600
tract and they feel like they're

517
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,640
swelling but it's different than someone

518
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,320
else who's not bloating in their

519
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,480
digestive tract but yet they're swelling

520
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,960
underneath their skin and then there's

521
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,720
someone who has all of it they're

522
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,000
bloated and they're swelling and then

523
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,159
there's someone who has a weight gain

524
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,919
issue where they're gaining weight so

525
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,480
they're gaining excess fat and they're

526
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:33,720
swelling with retention fluid retention

527
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,600
and they can have digestive bloating

528
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,240
plus tissue

529
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,760
expansion and if they're a woman they

530
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,279
can have their period if they're a man

531
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,120
they're not going to have their period

532
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:46,880
so that part of the swelling may not be

533
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,960
in the mix and some women swell a lot

534
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,520
more during their period and some women

535
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,919
swell a lot less there's endless

536
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,799
combinations of swelling too and fluid

537
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,279
retention 100 people can have swollen

538
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,080
hands and and 100 people can have a 100

539
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,600
different reasons why they're swollen in

540
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,000
the hands because everything changes one

541
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,480
person ate this the other person ate

542
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,200
this one person has this problem inside

543
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,159
their body and the other person has this

544
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,840
problem inside their body their swelling

545
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,720
may look almost the same but it's not

546
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,039
the same even if it looked the same it's

547
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,240
not the same one person can have

548
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,880
endometriosis and it's contributing

549
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,360
adding into all their swelling in a

550
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,320
different way another person can have

551
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,360
IBS intestinal tract issues they're on

552
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,440
the toilet a lot they're aggravated

553
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,520
their intestinal tracts inflamed they

554
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,480
have diarrhea another person has fatty

555
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,039
liver liver is all congested stagnant

556
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,039
sluggish overworked overburdened another

557
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,960
person could have gout somebody else

558
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,440
could have an entirely different issue

559
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,840
around all of this they could have a

560
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,000
really bad chemical sensitivity it's

561
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,120
never going to be the same the exact

562
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,080
measurements the exact type of fluid or

563
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:06,720
amount of fluid or amount of tissue

564
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,919
expansion or the amount of gas inside

565
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,960
the intestinal tract either or how the

566
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,279
intestinal tract is built and how it

567
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,399
moves and the peristaltic action

568
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,000
combination of bloating with the

569
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:20,159
digestive system swelling with the liver

570
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,960
and lymphatic system and the

571
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,799
reproductive system and then the amounts

572
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,039
and the locations the locations of a

573
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:31,919
fluid locations of the swelling are

574
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,960
going to be different for everybody so

575
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,559
why is everybody swelling how come

576
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,159
everybody swelling everybody's got some

577
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,600
type of flute retention or some type of

578
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,159
layer on them or swelling so let's go

579
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,320
into the different causes we're talking

580
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,440
about mystery swelling mystery fluid

581
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,760
retention we're not talking about if

582
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:58,840
someone has a clearcut case where their

583
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:01,600
heart is having a problem or kidney

584
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,000
failure and they're swelling because of

585
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,440
kidneys and heart a big part stems from

586
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,679
the liver that's the place where a lot

587
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,480
of Calamity occurs our livers get toxic

588
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,279
as the years go on see your liver is a

589
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,960
filter like a fish filter in a fish tank

590
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,880
that's filtering the water your liver is

591
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,200
filtering your blood it's filtering

592
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,440
everything before the lymphatic system

593
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,480
even gets its chance your liver is doing

594
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,799
it at first your lymphatic system was

595
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,640
never designed to handle what the world

596
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,480
throws at us we're talking about

597
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,520
pesticides herbicides fungicides the air

598
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,080
freshener chemicals the fragrances the

599
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,080
Colones perfumes all the different

600
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,240
petrochemicals and the toxins that fall

601
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,440
out of the sky all the different

602
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,640
Pharmaceuticals all the carpet cleaning

603
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,520
solvents and chemicals that come out of

604
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,200
carpets all the secondhand smoke all the

605
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,600
vaping all the psychedelics in the brain

606
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,240
all the different recreational drugs and

607
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,399
all the chemicals that are used on them

608
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,919
when they're growing nanotechnology

609
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:07,480
falling out of the sky now

610
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,679
nanotechnology and the Pharmaceuticals

611
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,159
hair products chemicals and those body

612
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,720
products makeup and then tattoos the ink

613
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,880
itself all the toxic heavy metals I know

614
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,960
people say well that wasn't my tattoo

615
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,360
ink but all ink has toxic heavy metals

616
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,919
even the vegan ink or the cruelty-free

617
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,480
ink but either way all of this wasn't

618
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,919
for the lymphatic system but it became

619
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,279
the lymphatic system's problem but it

620
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,760
was never supposed to be our lymphatic

621
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,279
system was not our main filter it was

622
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,679
just there for our normal bodily

623
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,279
problems and functions our liver is

624
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,159
supposed to take the hit it's the Fall

625
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,679
Guy It's supposed to take on the toxins

626
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,640
first that are in this world see we're

627
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,640
not supposed to naturally be up against

628
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,120
the toxins we're up against but the the

629
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,640
industries create them and then we get

630
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,799
exposed to them and our liver it's a

631
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,440
first line of defense that's the big

632
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:11,120
filter all this blood is rushing through

633
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,120
the liver it's that big massive filter

634
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,760
it's grabbing onto toxins poisons

635
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,200
pathogens toxic heavy metals chemicals

636
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,159
and it's collecting them to keep the

637
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,720
blood clean enough to protect the heart

638
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,760
your lymphatic system is critical its

639
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,159
job is to clean and purify by to get the

640
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,399
bodily waste some of the bodily waste

641
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:35,960
out of the bloodstream and if some of

642
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:39,679
that bodily waste is a pathogen a

643
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,640
bacteria a microb a virus then the

644
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,279
lymphatic job is to suck it up and have

645
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,600
your lymphocytes try to kill it your

646
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,640
lymphatic system is dependent on the

647
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,919
liver to do the big cleanup because if

648
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,039
the liver doesn't do the big cleanup

649
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:58,240
including pathogens and all the

650
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,399
industrial toxins and exposures if the

651
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,640
liver doesn't do that well lymphatic

652
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:07,960
system pays the price the liver gets so

653
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,480
overloaded and so bogg down so fill the

654
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,399
toxins and poisons it starts to get

655
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,360
sluggish stagnant fats even get balled

656
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:21,080
up inside the liver the liver starts to

657
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,600
slow down and slow down it can't produce

658
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,600
its bio reserves it can't function as

659
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,120
good as it needs to be and then the

660
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,840
immune system inside the liver starts to

661
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,760
weaken and the lymphatic system relies

662
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,399
on the liver's immune system to handle

663
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,320
the big pathogens the pathogenic

664
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:44,960
infections the Epstein bars the shingles

665
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:48,799
viruses the hhv 6s the herpes simplexes

666
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,480
it's there to handle those pathogens so

667
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,399
that the lymphatic system lymphocytes

668
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,519
don't have to take on the whole storm

669
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,880
but it all goes wrong what starts to

670
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:03,399
happen is the liver starts to break down

671
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,039
it can't handle it itself because it's

672
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:09,679
so overburdened so stagnant and sluggish

673
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,960
it's not even just the chemicals and the

674
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,600
pathogens it's also the way we eat it's

675
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,960
also the things we use like the caffeine

676
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,480
and all the vinegars the liver's already

677
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,559
up against so much but we bombard it and

678
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,840
then throw the alcohol in the mix or

679
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,159
drinking and the liver has to suck up

680
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,760
the alcohol

681
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,240
it becomes a problem over time where

682
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,919
your liver the filter weakens starts to

683
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,360
break down yeah it might look good at

684
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:42,679
the doctor's office they might not see

685
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,960
anything wrong with your liver yet but

686
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,880
they don't see everything anybody who's

687
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,279
been sick long enough knows that they

688
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,279
don't see everything so the liver starts

689
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,880
to not work properly and then the

690
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,559
lymphatic system has to work harder but

691
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,039
here's the thing it's not equipped to

692
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:06,880
work harder and that's why everybody's

693
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,760
swelling and that leads us to tissue

694
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,679
expansion tissue expansion is not

695
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,000
lymphatic system expansion tissue

696
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:18,000
expansion is all the poisons and toxins

697
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,799
that got out of the liver and the

698
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,840
lymphatic system couldn't process or

699
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,840
handle them or clean them those toxins

700
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,639
and poisons and chemicals went into deep

701
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:33,519
connection itive tissue and deep into

702
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:34,200
the organs deep into the brain deep into

703
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,919
the

704
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,960
spleen deep into the intestinal tract

705
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:44,799
lining deep into the skin these tissues

706
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,760
got saturated overloaded with multitudes

707
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:52,880
of toxins and poisons and pathogenic

708
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:56,559
waste year after year after year decade

709
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:00,639
after decade even in the bones and then

710
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:04,360
everything started to widen out tissue

711
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:07,120
started to expand joints started to

712
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:10,519
expand this is beyond just fluid

713
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,559
retention this is beyond just lymphatic

714
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:17,000
fluid this is toxins and poisons and

715
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,039
pathogenic waste that found its way into

716
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,679
the guts of the person and I don't mean

717
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:24,840
intestinal tract I mean into the core of

718
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,840
their Essence into their bones and

719
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:31,880
connective tissue and tendons

720
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:35,679
right into their joints and organs and

721
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,240
it expands because cells expand because

722
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,919
cells themselves that are made in the

723
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,919
nerves and the connective tissue and the

724
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:48,360
joints they can't hold all the poisons

725
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,639
and toxins so they inflame and swell and

726
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,000
then there's the dead cells all the

727
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:55,840
cells that have died they didn't get

728
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,600
flushed out they didn't cleanse out

729
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,240
lymphatic system didn't cleanse them out

730
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,720
liver didn't cleanse them out all the

731
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,720
dead cells that gathered around the

732
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,480
joints tendons the connective tissue in

733
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,760
and around the organs create a swelling

734
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,760
all on their own so an expansion happens

735
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,080
with our organs and tissue and Bones

736
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,760
because we have all this dead tissue

737
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,519
intertwined in all of it that never

738
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,519
escaped while surrounded by living cells

739
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,679
that are also filled with toxin and

740
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,200
poisons and they're at their limit and

741
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:36,799
is everything's swelling we need more

742
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,080
blood so vessels develop varicose veins

743
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,760
are a prime example of excess veins that

744
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,960
are actually growing to feed areas that

745
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,039
were expanding because of a lot of

746
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:53,120
toxins and poisons either from pathogens

747
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:56,000
chemical exposure or even weight gain or

748
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,440
even scar tissue or injuries that

749
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
expansion called for more veins to be

750
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,159
produced but see this expansion is

751
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,519
subtle all through the body as well

752
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:08,280
where you don't need a varicose vein but

753
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,599
these tiny blood vessels are created all

754
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,040
around expanding tissue so a thickening

755
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,919
happens if the liver doesn't get what it

756
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,280
needs to toxification Cleansing the care

757
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,879
it really needs to carry us through life

758
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,560
it enlarges gets stagnant sluggish gets

759
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:27,760
filled with too much poison and Toxin

760
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,240
and then

761
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,679
those poisons and toxins fill every

762
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,560
organ they fill the brain they fill the

763
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,879
heart a heart can enlarge as the years

764
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,159
go on because it gets so toxic because

765
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:45,359
of the liver being a weakened filter

766
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,839
expansion of tissue can happen in an

767
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,040
obvious way too not just internally

768
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,200
where you can't see it or can't see the

769
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,440
blood vessels internally it can happen

770
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,599
externally in a way like when someone's

771
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,599
nose gets bulbous and big there's lots

772
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:04,640
of more new blood vessels in the nose

773
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,520
that have grown so the nose got large

774
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,240
because it has more blood vessels and

775
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:12,040
more tissue this expansion is obvious

776
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,359
when it comes down to a nose but it's

777
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,960
not obvious when it's inside all of our

778
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:19,119
other connective tissue and everywhere

779
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,560
else in our organs we can't notice it we

780
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,520
just notice the person is expanding over

781
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,520
the years so you take a look at a

782
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,599
picture when they were in college when

783
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,880
they were 20 years old and then you take

784
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,280
a look at them when they're 50 and you

785
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,839
see the difference when the liver is all

786
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,560
filled up there's no room anymore in it

787
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,599
to hold all those toxins so those toxins

788
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,079
end up leaving the liver escaping or

789
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,640
going straight through the filter

790
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,240
straight through the liver in the

791
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,000
bloodstream and then the lymphatic

792
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:54,000
system gets way overburdened it can't

793
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,160
handle that toxic load so the toxins

794
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,079
have nowhere to go there either but the

795
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,240
lymphatics system still draws the toxins

796
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:04,400
in problem is the toxins stay in the

797
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,400
lymphatic system they have nowhere else

798
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,240
to go and then you need more fluid in

799
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,240
the lymphatic system to dilute the

800
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,880
toxins so then the lymphatic system

801
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,920
keeps on receiving more fluid drawing

802
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,680
more fluid in to try to dilute the

803
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,040
toxins that are inside the lymphatic

804
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,760
system so a trap occurs a catch 22 in

805
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,800
the lymphatic system lymphatic system

806
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,920
needs to try to filter but it can't it's

807
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,160
too overloaded so the Vicious Cycle

808
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,880
keeps on carrying on and carrying on and

809
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,839
as that's happening more fluid is

810
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,880
building up accumulating in the

811
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:45,000
lymphatic system with more toxins what's

812
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,880
interesting though is this can happen

813
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,319
with the entire lymphatic system the

814
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,560
entire lymphatic system within the body

815
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:56,280
so you can't see it's more fluid based

816
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,880
in one area versus more fluid retention

817
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,640
based in another area it's the whole

818
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,040
body is retaining fluid because the

819
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,760
lymphatic system is overburdened within

820
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:10,160
the entire body this can be hard to see

821
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:13,119
on a person one person can have a very

822
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,839
thin layer of this what that means is

823
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,119
their whole lymphatic system is slightly

824
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,960
swollen so the retaining fluid the

825
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,560
retaining water but you can't quite see

826
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,880
it the person may be able to feel it

827
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,760
though and then there's the person that

828
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,720
can see it they can look in the mirror

829
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,800
in the morning they can see when it's

830
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,640
gone and they can look in the mirror at

831
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,680
the end of the day and they can see when

832
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,280
it appears cuz it can build up all day

833
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,160
long at night their liver is trying to

834
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,880
detox trying to cleanse trying to push

835
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,560
whatever it can out by morning

836
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,119
everything is down a bit this is why

837
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,400
people who are more swollen at the end

838
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,119
of the day des swell in the morning and

839
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,160
the cycle goes on every single day this

840
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:59,760
person though know has different times

841
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,119
and moments in their life where all of a

842
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,480
sudden they're like whoa they're in

843
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,560
front of the mirror and they're like

844
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,680
everything's down I'm looking good I'm

845
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,880
wearing the pants I want to wear I'm

846
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,000
wearing the shirt I want to wear I like

847
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,359
this look and then a week later they got

848
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,800
the layer building up again the fluid

849
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,880
retention is building in their system

850
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,680
their whole body is getting that extra

851
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,160
fluid retention they put their pants on

852
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,720
they put their shirt on and now they're

853
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,359
like oh I don't like this and then it

854
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,400
looks like they're gain gaining weight

855
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,520
they're getting fat when really they're

856
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,480
not gaining weight they're not gaining

857
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,760
extra fat they're gaining extra fluid

858
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,880
and that extra fluid is just pushing

859
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,200
everything outward and this is where a

860
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,720
lot of confusion lies you think you're

861
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,880
getting heavier and heavier but you're

862
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,720
not gaining lots of fat you're gaining

863
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,319
lots of fluid there's people who yes are

864
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:54,960
overweight they do have 10 lbs of extra

865
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:58,240
fat on their body or 20 lbs of extra fat

866
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,119
on their body but yet they're 50 lb

867
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,640
overweight they have 20 to 30 lb of

868
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:06,319
fluid retention and that's where a lot

869
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,040
of confusion lies that's why when

870
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:12,520
someone says I intermittent fasted I

871
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,680
didn't eat for 23 hours or I didn't eat

872
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:19,720
for 48 hours and I lost 27 lbs what

873
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:23,359
happens is they didn't lose 27 PBS of

874
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:26,839
fat they lost 27 pounds of fluid but

875
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,560
here's the problem you have to eat it's

876
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,000
the only way to sustain be functional

877
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,599
have your brain working you can't always

878
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,680
be on no food so then when you start

879
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:40,200
eating again living your life the fluid

880
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,920
builds all back up again and you're back

881
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,640
to square one there's so many different

882
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,960
variations somebody may be only up about

883
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,400
three or four pounds of fat on their

884
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,599
body with 10 pounds of fluid somebody

885
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,800
else might have five pounds of fat on

886
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,640
their body 12 pounds of fluid someone

887
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,440
may have 5 lbs of fat on their body and

888
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:07,359
5 lbs of fluid and someone else might

889
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,839
have 75 lbs of fat with an additional 40

890
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,560
lb of fluid there are endless

891
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,839
combinations no two are alike

892
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,880
everybody's different there are so many

893
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:20,760
variables within everyone they're not

894
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,760
exact they can be off the mark on ounces

895
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,880
they could be different in pounds but

896
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,000
none of them are the same but that's not

897
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,280
the only differences there's differences

898
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,839
everywhere for example what's causing

899
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,880
the person's lymphatic swelling what's

900
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,680
causing their flu retention is different

901
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,040
than somebody else with their flute

902
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,359
retention for example somebody could

903
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,440
have Epstein bar inside the liver and

904
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,200
that Epstein bar virus could be feeding

905
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,200
off of mercury inside the liver then

906
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,240
releasing a Mercury based neurotoxin

907
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,119
into the bloodstream because the liver

908
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,839
is so overburdened it can't contain it

909
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:59,000
all when that neurotoxin starts floating

910
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:01,400
around in the bloodstream it finds its

911
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,760
way into the lymphatic system so the

912
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,640
lymphatic system draws it in but our

913
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,079
lymphatic system isn't used to such an

914
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,640
unnatural Toxin and poison so it sits in

915
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,520
the lymphatic system and then requires

916
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,800
more fluid to build up into the

917
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,280
lymphatic system in order to control

918
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,560
that toxin how does the lymphatic system

919
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,040
control the toxin the immune cells have

920
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,200
to eat up the Toxin and that's where

921
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,760
your immune system gets overburdened

922
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,359
inside the lymphatic system you got an

923
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,960
army of lymphocytes inside your

924
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:37,880
lymphatic system they're there to clean

925
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,359
up the mess but they can die they can

926
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:44,040
expire especially if the toxins and

927
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:47,160
poisons are very strong the more toxins

928
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,960
that enter the lymphatic system then

929
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,280
more fluid has to be in the lymphatic

930
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,880
system your lymphocytes can't be in a

931
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,240
small amount of fluid while up against a

932
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,160
large amount of toxins and as the larger

933
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,920
amount of toxins build up inside your

934
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,800
lymphatic system you need more

935
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,440
lymphocytes but more lymphocytes can't

936
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,640
do their job cleaning up the toxins if

937
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,680
there's very little fluid because the

938
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:18,319
toxins are now turning the fluid into a

939
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:21,559
toxic sludge so then a requirement

940
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,319
occurs need more fluid more fluid goes

941
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:27,200
into the lymphatic system to give your

942
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,760
lymphocytes and immune cells a chance so

943
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,240
they could swim around the toxins and

944
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,119
gather them up this is why when somebody

945
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,040
gets a lymphatic massage at this point

946
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,480
it pushes the fluid out and a large

947
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,680
amount of toxins Escape into the

948
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,359
bloodstream and that person if they're

949
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,000
chronically ill and they're dealing with

950
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:50,599
any kind of condition or autoimmune tend

951
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,480
to get sicker after lymphatic massage if

952
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,760
someone isn't that sick and they don't

953
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,599
have a lot of fluid buildup inside their

954
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,280
lymphatic system and they get a

955
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:02,319
lymphatic massage they may not feel it

956
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,640
so much it may feel more of a relief so

957
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,720
they had that drainage occur and they're

958
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,760
happy but someone else could be really

959
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,920
sick and have a lot more fluid now

960
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,280
here's the difference too someone's

961
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,839
lymphatic fluid could be a lot more

962
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,599
toxic than someone else's lymphatic

963
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:21,640
fluid someone might have a different

964
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,559
Toxin and a different poison in their

965
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,200
fluid somebody else might have less of a

966
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:31,160
toxin less of a pathogen based toxin not

967
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,520
as toxic so when the the fluid escapes

968
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:37,240
into the bloodstream the person doesn't

969
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,280
get so sick but the person can get sick

970
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,400
if it's really toxic and it escapes into

971
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,920
the bloodstream but here's the next

972
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,520
problem we just think that this fluid

973
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,800
magically leaves us after we pushed it

974
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,040
out of our lymphatic system so if

975
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,240
someone had a lot of toxic fluid in

976
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,079
their lymphatic system and they had a

977
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,920
lymphatic massage they think oh good

978
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,079
will just pee it out and alls well it

979
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,280
doesn't always work that way a lot of

980
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,200
the toxins end up back into the liver a

981
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,760
stagnant sluggish toxic liver a

982
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,240
dysfunctional liver the toxins go right

983
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,559
back up into it but since the liver

984
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,359
can't hold on to any more toxins because

985
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:21,160
it's stagnant and sluggish it sends it

986
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:24,240
back out now it's recycling it ends up

987
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:27,599
back into the lymphatic system 3 days

988
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,160
later the person's blown up again 5 days

989
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,559
later the person's blown up again a week

990
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,880
later they're blown up again because it

991
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:38,200
just recycled you pushed it out it went

992
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,119
through the liver then it went back up

993
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,920
into the bloodstream back into the

994
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,920
lymphatic system it's a vicious cycle it

995
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,400
keeps on circulating and then the

996
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,040
person's like whoa I'm back in here

997
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,720
again I have to live here at my massage

998
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,240
therapists because each day it builds

999
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,040
back up sometimes it takes a day

1000
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,119
sometimes it's three days days sometimes

1001
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,079
it's 5 days our lymphatic systems are

1002
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,559
one of the most important body systems

1003
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,359
we have so everybody's focused on the

1004
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,599
lymphatic system while missing the liver

1005
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:13,160
what they're doing is they're

1006
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,880
overlooking the core of the problem the

1007
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,680
place where it all starts if we don't

1008
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,760
fix the liver we can't fix the lymphatic

1009
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,760
system but the liver is no fun to work

1010
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,960
with it's like okay I have a liver the

1011
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:30,839
liver is stagnant what do I do what do I

1012

1047
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,359
going back thousands of years when the

1048
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,000
first human being put their hand on the

1049
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:13,839
other human being there was a feeling it

1050
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,319
had touch is critical for a lot of

1051
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:19,319

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,800
people I love get a massage it's very

1063
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:48,240

really helpful one that cares has

1066
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,680
compassion even better if you're

1067
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,319
somebody that's really sick has a lot of

1068
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,960
flute retention

1069
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,359
you're living with a lot of that flute

1070
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,599
retention it's really hard and you have

1071
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:06,079
to get lymphatic massage a lot I

1072
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:08,119
recommend trying to fix the core issue

1073
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,680
get down to the liver start to do

1074
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:13,720
healing tools clean the liver up so that

1075
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,960
you don't have to get lymphatic massage

1076
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,200
every day or other day or three times a

1077
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:22,200
week so you don't have to constantly

1078
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:24,319
force the fluid out fix the liver clean

1079
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,480
the pathogens out and the toxins out

1080
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,559
kill the pathogens help support your

1081
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,800
lymphocytes and the rest of your immune

1082
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:34,040
system and eventually take yourself out

1083
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,319
of that vicious cycle and then there's

1084
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,480
people with severe lymphadema where

1085
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,640
they're swelling in their leg their

1086
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,319
whole leg swollen they're swelling in

1087
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,680
their arm swelling in their breast

1088
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:49,200
swelling in their feet their calves

1089
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,480
where it's severe and they have to use

1090
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,520
compression stockings and they're

1091
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,000
suffering from lymphadema because they

1092
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,040
had an injury or they had a surgery y or

1093
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,079
they had breast cancer something else

1094
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,920
happened or an obstruction is going on

1095
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,200
and they're dealing with some severe

1096
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,240
lymphadema in a certain section in their

1097
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,079
body and even then it's critical to fix

1098
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,839
the liver rebuild our immune system our

1099
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:15,119
immune system is not just our

1100
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:17,599
lymphocytes and our lymphatic system so

1101
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:21,119
if somebody has a damaged lymphatic

1102
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:24,040
system from an injury breast cancer or a

1103
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,280
surgery then that's okay because our

1104
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,319
immune system is in other places too we

1105
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,720
have an immune system in our bloodstream

1106
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,480
that's where a large amount of our

1107
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,480
immune system is we have an immune

1108
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,520
system in our liver we have an immune

1109
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:39,040
system in other organs so this immune

1110
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,599
system needs to get coddled it needs to

1111
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,960
be cared for it needs to be recovered

1112
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,720
and that's a Powerhouse for us so not

1113
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,440
only do we fix and heal the liver but we

1114
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,520
also heal the liver's immune system and

1115
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,799
our immune system throughout our body

1116
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,880
lymphatic problems aren't genetic now I

1117
00:49:54,799 --> 00:49:59,119
know there's misin information out there

1118
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,240
the gene blame game that's out there

1119
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,400
where anything anybody has they'll just

1120
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,680
be like whoa It's your genes it's your

1121
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,799
genes that's doing it you got bad genes

1122
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,359
faulty genes lympha is from your Gene

1123
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:13,680
problem genetic man and that's the

1124
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:16,240
people are told all the time it's not

1125
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:20,319
genetic There's real true causes it

1126
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,599
could seem genetic if our parents or our

1127
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,359
ancestors had it or somebody in our

1128
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:27,440
family has it and we're like whoo it is

1129
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:29,960
genetic but no no we still have the same

1130
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,200
Epstein bar virus passed down from our

1131
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,119
family pathogens are passed down from

1132
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:38,359
our family line it's not genetics it's

1133
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,599
bugs passed down toxins passed down too

1134
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:43,319
toxic heavy metals passed down from

1135
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:45,680
generation to generation to generation

1136
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:48,599
or the new generation of people got a

1137
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,200
new exposure all together so the whole

1138
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:54,720
family the whole family line in that

1139
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:57,240
generation got that recent exposure if

1140
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,240
someone's not that toxic they're just

1141
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,640
slightly toxic they don't have a lot of

1142
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,240
neurotoxins and dermato toxins they

1143
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,160
don't have a lot of pathogens and

1144
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:09,000
pathogen waste they haven't been exposed

1145
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:12,440
to a lot of different chemicals if that

1146
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,319
happens their lymphatic fluid will be

1147
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:19,240
clear it'll be a clear fluid now if

1148
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:21,559
someone's really toxic and they've been

1149
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,119
exposed to a lot of pathogens a lot of

1150
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:26,000
bugs they're fighting a lot of lowgrade

1151
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:27,520
infections they gotten a lot of

1152
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,359
diagnoses like

1153
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:33,160
autoimmune then that fluid isn't clear

1154
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:36,720
science of research says it's clear but

1155
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,839
it's not it's got a yellow tinge to it

1156
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,599
sometimes it could be very yellow

1157
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:44,280
sometimes it could be pus-like colored

1158
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:48,040
because if it gets too dirty and the

1159
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:51,839
lymphatic fluid is too gunked up it will

1160
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:54,040
be and if the fluid gets too

1161
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:56,520
then what happens more fluid has to go

1162
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,920
into the lymphatic system Sy to dilute

1163
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,240
all the toxins and poisons and then that

1164
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,640
person's lymphatic system is now blown

1165
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,040
up larger so now someone is retaining

1166
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,079
more fluid lymphatic wise they're

1167
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,880
swelling more and they're more

1168
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,319
uncomfortable and this leads to

1169
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,880
something that a lot of people go

1170
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:15,400
through all the time which is hot

1171
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,079
weather sensitivities to when it gets

1172
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,640
hot outside or really humid outside so

1173
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:24,280
summertime comes around it's really hot

1174
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:26,640
out really humid and the person's really

1175
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,760
uncomfortable they're sitting outside

1176
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,960
and they can't stand it any longer

1177
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,920
because it feels like the swelling is

1178
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,480
enlarging or they feel like they're

1179
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,359
swelling more than someone else and then

1180
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,799
somebody else that doesn't have that

1181
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:44,240
fluid retention is fine in the Heat and

1182
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:45,920
they look okay they look like they're

1183
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,960
dealing with it they look happy they're

1184
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,160
doing something maybe an activity and

1185
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,400
then somebody else they're actually

1186
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,440
suffering it's like I can't handle the

1187
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,040
Heat or the humidity I have to stay

1188
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:01,119
inside it's just just hard on my body I

1189
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:03,359
feel just like so bloated or swollen

1190
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,480
what determines the difference between

1191
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,280
someone with fluid retention not

1192
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,599
handling the humidity and Heat versus

1193
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:14,079
somebody else with fluid retention

1194
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:16,880
handling the humidity and heat is the

1195
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,400
toxic nature of the lymphatic fluid so

1196
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,920
if it has that yellow tinge to it if

1197
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,240
it's dirty fluid if it has a lot of

1198
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,799
toxins and poisons and the color of the

1199
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,440
fluid isn't clear inside the lymphatic

1200
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:31,319
system then they're going to struggle

1201
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,720
more because when you're in the heat and

1202
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:36,400
humidity in the Sun and you're highly

1203
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:39,200
toxic and the fluid retention is highly

1204
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,559
toxic the body reacts differently it

1205
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,720
weighs you down makes you feel more

1206
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:46,240
swollen makes you feel more

1207
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:49,079
uncomfortable toxins in the lymphatic

1208
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,839
fluid react to body heat so if you're

1209
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:53,359
somebody and you're out in the sun

1210
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:56,640
you're hanging out it's really a hot day

1211
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:59,599
it's 90° it's humid outside and your

1212
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,599
body temperature starts to raise your

1213
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:06,079
core temperature starts to raise if your

1214
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:10,200
lymphatic vessels are filled with toxic

1215
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:13,119
yellow fluid then as the core

1216
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,480
temperature raises in your body and it's

1217
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:19,480
hot outside the toxins and poisons

1218
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:22,440
create additional heat and then more

1219
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:25,880
expansion occurs from the heat CU it's

1220
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:28,440
not just the fluid that's Heating up

1221
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,599
it's the toxins inside the fluid that

1222
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,520
are heating up and those toxins start to

1223
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,319
expand and if someone is that toxic they

1224
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,680
usually have toxins everywhere else

1225
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,040
floating around they have toxins

1226
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:44,799
floating around in their bloodstream and

1227
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:48,680
in other organs so when the heat happens

1228
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:52,160
outside the humidity goes up they feel

1229
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,839
not good and then when they go inside

1230
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,960
the house and they're in air

1231
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:58,920
conditioning they're not feeling great

1232
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:01,319
that day because they're so toxic the

1233
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,359
heat expanded a lot of the toxins

1234
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:06,040
throughout the bloodstream and the

1235
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,240
organs and then they feel unwell and

1236
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,440
they feel like they got sun sickness but

1237
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:14,040
they weren't outside in the sun for a

1238
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,440
long time but yet they feel sick after

1239
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:19,440
being in the sun that means that if they

1240
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:21,319
were to go somewhere to a beach or sit

1241
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,200
outside for a long period of time in

1242
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:26,960
heat and Sun there's a good chance they

1243
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,440
are going to feel very sick a day later

1244
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,760
or that same day or the end of the day

1245
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,559
because they're so toxic and they have

1246
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,520
not only toxins in their lymphatic fluid

1247
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,280
and they have the fluid retention but

1248
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,359
they have toxins floating everywhere

1249
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,200
else inside the body if you're curious

1250
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:45,160
of what kind of toxins these are it

1251
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:47,720
could be neurotoxins from low-grade

1252
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:50,520
viral infections dermat toxins from

1253
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,240
lowgrade viral infections toxins from

1254
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,760
all kinds of different bacteria and

1255
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,000
viruses along with toxic heavy metals

1256
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:59,280
other chemical toxins all floating

1257
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,480
around so now let's talk about when

1258
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,480
people say I feel best when I don't eat

1259
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,400
hey I stopped eating I don't eat for 21

1260
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:11,720
hours and then I have a meal I try not

1261
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:15,480
to eat for 2 days it's kind of hard but

1262
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:18,079
I do it anyway hey I only eat meat I eat

1263
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,440
beef all day and then I top it off with

1264
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:24,319
some ghee I won't eat a vegetable hey I

1265
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,160
feel better ever since I quit sugar well

1266
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:28,680
they didn't quit sugar they quit

1267
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:32,920
everything not just sugar I feel better

1268
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:35,280
when I quit sugar um hey I feel better

1269
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,359
just drinking a little bit of water and

1270
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,119
then eating like every other day all

1271
00:56:38,359 --> 00:56:42,640
right so let's explore these when

1272
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:45,280
someone says I feel better now that I

1273
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,960
quit sugar now when they say that you

1274
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,039
think wait a minute what were they

1275
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,319
eating well they weren't eating sugar

1276
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,960
you know like a box of sugar or a bag of

1277
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,839
sugar in the grocery store where it's

1278
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,799
processed sugar and you're just doing

1279
00:56:55,839 --> 00:57:00,680
tablespoons or sugar cubes right when

1280
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,240
you're a kid and you have a sugar cube

1281
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,319
it wasn't like they were eating a whole

1282
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,520
bunch of sugar cubes all day long what

1283
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:10,720
they're talking about is processed foods

1284
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:14,680
like cookies cakes Donuts treats ice

1285
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:17,359
cream coffees with lots of sugar put in

1286
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:20,039
and cream or iced coffees with lots of

1287
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:22,480
sugar and cream baked goods uh

1288
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:24,920
croissants with powdered sugar on top

1289
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,760
candy bars like really bad candy bar

1290
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,680
bars and then those health food store

1291
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,400
candy bars that are supposedly good

1292
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,839
candy bars that have all that sugar in

1293
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,440
it too either way candy bars and then

1294
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:38,480
maybe like candies but like gummy bears

1295
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,200
with gelatin in it and all kinds of yes

1296
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,200
a little bit of sugar but natural

1297
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,599
flavors gelatin other additives

1298
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,359
preservatives and when you think about

1299
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:51,000
it is a candy bar all sugar is a

1300
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:54,119
croissant all sugar is a cookie all

1301
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,280

other junk or some type of grain that's

1306
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:11,839
not a good grain but yet when the person

1307
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:14,960
stopped eating all of these they say I

1308
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,680
feel better when I'm not eating sugar um

1309
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,400
you weren't eating sugar yeah you kind

1310
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,280

1311
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:25,880
in the mix no you are eating milk

1313
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,400
other grain like bad grain you were

1314
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:32,280
eating gluten you were having lots of

1315
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,680
fat you were eating butter you were

1316
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:37,160

things MSG additives red dye number one

1319
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:45,599
you were eating all of that and when you

1320
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,440
quit all those processed foods those

1321
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,480
cakes cookies donuts and all of that you

1322
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,280
started feeling better but what you tell

1323
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:54,359
everybody else is I quit sugar and that

1324
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,880
made me feel better so then somebody

1325
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:59,839
else hears that and they'll go oh I

1326
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,680
better quit fruit because fruit has

1327
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:04,760
sugar in it so that person said they

1328
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:07,359
quit sugar and they're feeling better I

1329
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,200
better stop eating my apples meanwhile

1330
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,480
there's all these health professionals

1331
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,680
that say that out there oh quit sugar

1332
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,039
look out for sugar and they just add to

1333
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,480
it they spread a bad message and then

1334
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:21,520
everybody's confused so what about when

1335
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,280
the person says I only eat meat try that

1336
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,599
that's the best way to do it grasp that

1337
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,000
beef only and then I give myself a treat

1338
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,520
and I have some ghee and then they say

1339
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
they're doing so much better well

1340
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:35,000
they're mono eating what happened was

1341
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,160
they were originally confused about what

1342
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,839
they were eating before all these years

1343
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,839
because they were eating cakes cookies

1344
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:42,960
donuts growing up they were eating

1345
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:44,640
cheeseburgers because they like their

1346
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,000
meat but they were eating the whole

1347
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,960
cheeseburger they got rid of the bun so

1348
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,720
now they're grainfree so now they're

1349
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,280
moving out all these other things they

1350
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,400
hear dairy's bad from someone so they

1351
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,920
get rid of the dairy but a lot of people

1352
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,079
who just eat meat do eat dairy too but

1353
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,720
if you get somebody that mono eats only

1354
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:05,440
meat they're doing the elimination deal

1355
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,640
where they're eliminating all these

1356
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,079
other Foods now when they eliminate

1357
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,599
those other Foods they're eliminating

1358
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:15,119
things that may have aggravated them and

1359
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:17,799
they didn't know they were eliminating

1360
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,880
some packaged food that has MSG in it

1361
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:22,640
but they didn't know the MSG was causing

1362
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:24,880
the problem or they're eliminating

1363
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:28,480
gluten right dairy products they're

1364
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:31,119
eliminating grains but some of those

1365
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,240
grains were actually okay but they never

1366
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:36,280
tried it where they only did Mill it

1367
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:38,960
only so they decided to stay with the

1368
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,319
fat which is the meat they were on a

1369
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,640
high-fat diet All These Years anyway and

1370
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:45,880
in the end when they decided to Mono eat

1371
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,839
to try to do the food elimination they

1372
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,480
kept with the fats and they kept with

1373
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:52,039
the thing that they've been taught the

1374
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,799
most as far as what the body needs high

1375
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:57,520
protein high fat so they kept with the

1376
01:00:54,799 --> 01:01:00,240
meat but they got some results for a

1377
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:02,920
little while mono eating can give you

1378
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,720
results even when it's something not

1379
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,000
great eventually all the fat from the

1380
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,520
meat catches up to them because now

1381
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,200
they're on just a meat diet meat diet

1382
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:16,079
only and that catches up because they

1383
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,480
need calories they need some type of

1384
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,960
fuel and you can't get that from a piece

1385
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,760
of meat because there's not enough

1386
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,880
glucose in that piece of meat there's

1387
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,559
only a little bit so then they start

1388
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,119
hitting the wall after about 3 months

1389
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,680
and they decide to bring in more meat so

1390
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,480
they're eating more of it now they're

1391
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,280
getting bloated they can't go to

1392
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,680
bathroom good they're feeling kind of

1393
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,720
sick they have no vegetables or leafy

1394
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:42,200
greens in their diet and now they hit a

1395
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,400
wall now they don't eat at all and

1396
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,039
they're doing this thing where they

1397
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,160
don't mono eat all day they take a day

1398
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:50,799
off the next day they fill themselves up

1399
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,319
with meat and they mono eat the meat

1400
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:55,680
next day they don't eat and now they're

1401
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:58,200
every other day and they're losing their

1402
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,880
strength and losing their energy then

1403
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,839
they find that they have to eat every

1404
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,640
day to some degree so they do the

1405
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:06,359
intermittent fasting but they only use

1406
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,599
their meat they don't eat all day and

1407
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:11,200
they have a whole bunch of meat at night

1408
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:13,400
one meal a day eventually that doesn't

1409
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,799
work anymore either that it's back to

1410
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:18,640
the old drawing board which means a

1411
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:20,319
binge eventually happens of other Foods

1412
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,960
they're with a friend somewhere they're

1413
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,440
out getting something to eat they're not

1414
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,279
sticking to their diet in that moment

1415
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,480
and they just lose it and they eat about

1416
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,920
five slices of pizza and on their way

1417
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,720
home they're like I'm going to get right

1418
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,599
back to the drawing board I'm going to

1419
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,440
get right back to eating my mono meat

1420
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:35,720
that's when I felt the best I remember

1421
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,359
and they're just stuck in the Vicious

1422
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,240
Cycle all over again this is just one

1423
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:42,279
example of trying to hack your bloating

1424
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,319
and your swelling and your digestive

1425
01:02:42,279 --> 01:02:47,039
discomfort there's hundreds and hundreds

1426
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:50,160
and hundreds examples and what they are

1427
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:52,960
it's about people coming from a high fat

1428
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,680
high protein diet right with some

1429
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,599
goodies thrown in the mix too that

1430
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,599
aren't good some processed foods and

1431
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:00,880
they're in that realm and they have to

1432
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:03,520
crawl out of that realm and so when they

1433
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,880
do they do different approaches one

1434
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,760
person might do a keto diet that works

1435
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,079
for a little while then they have to

1436
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,279
intermit and fast and do keto another

1437
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,760
person might just do the carnivore

1438
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:16,720
another person might do a vegan version

1439
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,480
or a plant-based version it's all nut

1440
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,039
Butters and nut Butters and stuff like

1441
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,680
that at the end of the day and then

1442
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:23,480
eventually they have to stop eating for

1443
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,640
a day because they just get so sick

1444
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,079
they're still doing the high fat diet

1445
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:30,279
high protein diet and they don't realize

1446
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,160
they're just stuck so everybody then

1447
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:34,079
plays these guessing games like well I'm

1448
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:36,079
not swelling that much today I better

1449
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,279
not eat again this is working for me for

1450
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,119
a minute let me do this green juice too

1451
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:42,359
oh let me try this and they're just all

1452
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:44,240
over the place each day is different

1453
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:46,000
each month is different there's hundreds

1454
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,559
of variations but they all have

1455
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,480
something in common they all come from a

1456
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:54,599
high fat high protein diet vegan or

1457
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:57,240
animal protein they also have something

1458
01:03:54,599 --> 01:04:00,799
else in common they all have something

1459
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:03,839
wrong with their health so why do they

1460
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:06,599
feel better when someone says well I

1461
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:08,279
just don't eat and I feel better that

1462
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:10,359
way another person will be like I'm best

1463
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:13,000
when I'm fasted another person is like

1464
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:15,039
I'm better at one meal a day my swelling

1465
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,839
goes down yeah when I don't eat that

1466
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:20,079
much my swelling goes down why is that

1467
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:23,119
happening how come their swelling goes

1468
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:26,039
down when they stop eating for a while

1469
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:29,400
because they stopped burdening they're

1470
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:32,520
already overburdened liver and they

1471
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:35,039
stopped burdening they're already over

1472
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:38,240
burdened lymphatic system they stopped

1473
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:40,559
eating they started cleansing they gave

1474
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:43,359
their liver a break from all the fat

1475
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,400
they eat and this is why the swelling

1476
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:49,079
starts to go down what's interesting is

1477
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,400
all these people stopping their eating

1478
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:54,720
and their swelling goes down they're all

1479
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:58,000
eating different diets all of them like

1480
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:01,240
some are vegans some are plant-based

1481
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,039
some are keto animal protein some are

1482
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,960
just

1483
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:05,839
carnivore it's a whole bunch of

1484
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,279
different people some are just processed

1485
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:11,599
foods just all they do is eat fast food

1486
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:13,200
and processed food but either way it's

1487
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,279
all these different diets no one's

1488
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:18,119
eating the same diet but when they all

1489
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:20,000
stop they're all like I feel better I'm

1490
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:22,000
getting the swelling down I feel a

1491
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,160
little better because they all got that

1492
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,319
other thing in common they're all eating

1493
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:32,160
all this fat so it's all this fat lard

1494
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:34,799
butter oil nut Butters avocado processed

1495
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,920
oils it's all that fat that's the thing

1496
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:38,359
that they got in common yeah they got

1497
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:40,240
different diets they all do it a

1498
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:42,319
different way one person eats eggs in

1499
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,480
the morning another person has eggs in

1500
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:46,839
their salad in the afternoon another

1501
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,880
person has eggs for dinner but they're

1502
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:51,000
all doing the eggs oh and if they don't

1503
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,720
do eggs then they're doing cheese if

1504
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,039
they don't do cheese then they're doing

1505
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,240
nuts either way they're all doing the

1506
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:59,079
fat and the high fat it's burdening the

1507
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,079
liver and that's what's in common on

1508
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:04,200
that part now someone could only be

1509
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:07,200
doing greasy fried fatty foods like

1510
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:09,760
processed foods right from a diner

1511
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:13,200
processed foods right from a fast food

1512
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,520
takeout and they'll get the same results

1513
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,039
when they stop eating as someone else

1514
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,680
does when they eat a vegan diet filled

1515
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:22,319
with nut Butters they all stop eating

1516
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,240
their swelling goes down they're all

1517
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:27,559
getting the same results even though

1518
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:30,279
diets are vastly apart if we never feel

1519
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:32,640
good when we're eating it can cause a

1520
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:34,960
lot of confusion let's just face it

1521
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,880
that's why when some Guru out there like

1522
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,240
somebody in health that seems like they

1523
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,880
got it all together they say well I

1524
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,640
don't eat food's not important I eat

1525
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,359
when I feel like it I can go days

1526
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:51,000
without eating everybody goes

1527
01:06:46,359 --> 01:06:53,640
ooh that's the answer that's the Panacea

1528
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,319
it's this Guru guy sits on a Mountaintop

1529
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:58,839
and he meditates and he goes to all the

1530
01:06:56,319 --> 01:07:00,839
Retreats and everybody knows who he is

1531
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:03,559
and he says he doesn't need to eat he's

1532
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:06,960
like a lizard you just need one meal a

1533
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:09,279
week and this guy's got it all down and

1534
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,799
I feel sick when I eat and I try every

1535
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:14,760
healthy diet there ever was every trendy

1536
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:17,000
diet and I just can't eat but this guy

1537
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,359
this guy here this Guru he's got it all

1538
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,720
down he just doesn't need to eat that's

1539
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:24,039
what I have to gravitate to like that's

1540
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:26,640
the mission and you'll see the

1541
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:29,720
consistencies out there people who are

1542
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:31,039
into Health they're doing a certain diet

1543
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:34,200
they get a whole bunch of people on

1544
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:36,880
board everybody's watching them 6 months

1545
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:39,440
later they alter their diet it's not

1546
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,359
working but who cares about the six

1547
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,920
months of people that watched them and

1548
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:46,760
tried it too like who cares about them

1549
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,799
all messing up or being in the dark or

1550
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,760
not knowing where to go and being lost

1551
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:54,160
switch gears so now that same influencer

1552
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,559
or health professional or Guru is is now

1553
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,720
doing a different take a different diet

1554
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:01,640
so now it's a whole 6 months more of all

1555
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,640
that watch me now watch me now here's my

1556
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:06,160
morning routine here's what I do during

1557
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:07,640
the day I'm on this new thing ofama jig

1558
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,799
I'm taking this and then everybody

1559
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,960
follows along and they're all following

1560
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:13,760
along and it gets all messed up again

1561
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,599
and then they shift gears again but it

1562
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,560
happens over and over again you could

1563
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,679
watch it sometimes it's just years and

1564
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,839
years if they've been in it long enough

1565
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,520
if somebody has been doing this for 5

1566
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:27,199
years it's 5 years of mistake akes and

1567
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,960
different directions and who pays for it

1568
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:32,239
the people that watched and got invested

1569
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,359
and they put their health at risk they

1570
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:36,799
invested into what the person was doing

1571
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:38,799
they lost 6 months or they lost another

1572
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:40,920
year another year of what they could

1573
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:42,880
have done for their health and the

1574
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,719
reason why it went downhill was because

1575
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,040
of the consistency what the health

1576
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:48,920
professional they were watching was

1577
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:52,520
doing was being inconsistent it's every

1578
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:56,199
change every 4 months 6 months or every

1579
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:58,839
year and that in consistency was proof

1580
01:08:56,199 --> 01:09:00,159
that the professional or the influencer

1581
01:08:58,839 --> 01:09:02,880
didn't know what they were doing to

1582
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:06,000
begin with it was all hacks and

1583
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,480
makeshift bait and switch it was all try

1584
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,520
this get quick results instant

1585
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:12,640
gratification oh doesn't work sorry guys

1586
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,000
didn't mean to put you through that in

1587
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,520
the last 6 months let's start again but

1588
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,279
yet they really don't say sorry to

1589
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,520
anybody they just go quiet for a while

1590
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:23,279
reinvent themselves or act like it never

1591
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,400
even happened and then you get new

1592
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:26,799
followers

1593
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,960
and the old ones just dissipate and fall

1594
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:32,159
away so if we're at the point in

1595
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:35,640
Everybody's Health and where we are

1596
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:38,560
today that we all have to just stop

1597
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:40,600
eating and that's the only way out and

1598
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,040
that's the only fix then something's

1599
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,400
terribly wrong because if we're not

1600
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:48,040
eating and we're just starving ourselves

1601
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:50,120
all day long or only eating one meal a

1602
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:53,279
day then we're not getting the things we

1603
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:55,719
need for our brain our liver our heart

1604
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,120
the rest of our body systems our nervous

1605
01:09:55,719 --> 01:10:00,440
system we're not giving all these

1606
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:04,400
different body systems what they need

1607
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:07,080
we're just skating by playing around we

1608
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:10,600
need to actually fix problems like

1609
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:13,719
really fix problems core problems we

1610
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:16,480
need to fix our sick livers we need to

1611
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:19,640
get them cleansed and healed we need to

1612
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:22,400
get them restored stagnant sluggish

1613
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:25,800
overburdened livers we need to protect

1614
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:28,360
our nervous system get it fed give our

1615
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,719
nervous system the feedings it actually

1616
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:33,440
needs we have to make sure that there's

1617
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:36,600
ample glucose in our bloodstream enough

1618
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:39,679
glucose to feed our organs our brain

1619
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:42,159
starts to die in 5 seconds if it doesn't

1620
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,520
get sugar so we have to make sure we

1621
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:47,000
have enough glucose so the brain can

1622
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:50,000
receive that Sugar our heart also needs

1623
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,239
glucose too our heart's a muscle our

1624
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,360
heart can thin out the walls can weaken

1625
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:57,560
in the heart the muscle walls can weaken

1626
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,080
we have to make sure there's enough

1627
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:02,360
glucose getting to the heart our brain

1628
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:05,239
also needs electrolytes Trace mineral

1629
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:07,440
salts phytochemical compounds

1630
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:10,000
antioxidants our immune system needs to

1631
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,239
be fed too it needs the zinc it needs

1632
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,480
the minerals it needs the trace minerals

1633
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:17,880
to keep it strong it needs glucose as

1634
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:20,239
well our liver needs glucose too it

1635
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,719
needs strength to actually cleanse and

1636
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:25,360
detox the liver has its own immune

1637
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:28,000
system the immune cells inside the liver

1638
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:30,640
also need to be fed too phytochemical

1639
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,840
compounds from Foods antiviral compounds

1640
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,560
from Foods getting into these immune

1641
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:39,239
cells making them stronger we can't just

1642
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:41,360
run on our own adrenaline all day long

1643
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:43,440

01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,600
caffeine as a diet diuretic to try to

1650
01:11:54,639 --> 01:11:58,239

sluggish inside our body doesn't feel

01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:14,800
that peace our confidence in ourselves

1700
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:18,440
minimizes as our swelling over time

1701
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:22,280
maximizes and we want to jump out of our

1702
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:26,679
skin as the pressure inside of us

1703
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:30,719
swells some have it so bad feels like a

1704
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:34,880

01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:47,960
eating at all has all the backing it's

1709
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:51,719
understandable to withhold the food we

1710
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:54,920
love when your stomach extends you wish

1711
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:58,520
the problem would end and the next day

1712
01:14:54,920 --> 01:15:02,159
begins the problem's not solved there's

1713
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:04,920
so much more to who we are there's no

1714
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:08,080
way we need to be under this long

1715
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:13,040
uncomfortable spell it doesn't have to

1716
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:17,360
be this way over time it can be resolved

1717
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:21,159
internally inside of us inside our veins

1718
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:24,159
we have fortitude we have a light we

1719
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:28,639
have a universal connection to up and

1720
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:32,000
Beyond we have a deep healing well what

1721
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:35,520
we truly go through only God really

1722
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,920
knows our heart is pumping our

1723
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:42,040
bloodstream is running the blood and

1724
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:44,679
fluid is living proof that our

1725
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:48,360
unrelenting spiritual and physical

1726
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:50,960

1727
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:54,520
don't have to fear our food we don't

1728
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:58,159
have to be scared of a food

1729
01:15:54,520 --> 01:16:02,320
run it's not our fault we should be

1730
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:05,880
allowed to eat what we want but

1731
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:09,679

1732
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:13,320
