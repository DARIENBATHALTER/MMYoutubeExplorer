187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,319

188
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,840

time I'm going just get some props out

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,320
here you guys and it's not about

205
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,959
punishment it's not about guilt it's not

206
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,519
about we shouldn't be eating something

207
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,800
and now we need to punish ourselves it's

208
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,880
not about that at all it's about the

209
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,440
reality that so many people still eat

210
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,399
things that are not healthy for them

211
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,320
still eat things that are not productive

212
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,560
for them they still eat things that

213
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,000
actually can even hold them back or set

214
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,800
them back it just happens every day it's

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,399
a hard world out there and we have

216
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,640
emotional attachments to food this is an

217
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
ice cream right here that I'm going to

218
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,720

221
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,519
high in caffeine I'm going to be

222
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,959
bouncing off the walls killing my

223
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,040
adrenals and killing my liver but I

224
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,600
don't care because I want to indulge and

225
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,440
have a cheat day so I'm definitely going

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,320
to have this right here you guys going

227
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,839
into the new year a lot of people don't

228
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,800
start doing good things for themselves

229
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,839
on the day one of the new year it

230
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,000
usually takes to be like January 15th

231
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,079
everybody's like I'm going to do it on

232
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,560
the 15th it's January 15th that's what

233
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm going to do it another person is

234
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,079
like I'm going to do it by the end of

235
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,560
January I'm going to start February 1st

236
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:41,200
and there's this thing that happens

237
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,800
where people are like know I'm going to

238
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,560
do it in 3 days 7 Days 10 days next

239
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,120
thing you know it it's like February 1st

240
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,040
it's February 15th and then they're just

241
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,360
like screw it I can't do it and a lot of

242
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,160
people end up like that but we can start

243
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,440
January 1st January 2nd we can do that a

244
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,800
lot of people are just getting over

245
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,640
their their hangovers and they don't

246
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,399
want to start anything because they're

247
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,519
still filled with alcohol and all kinds

248
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,000
of other stuff and fun Foods in their

249
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
blood streaming

250
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,600
system so the whole thing with the

251
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,480
morning cleanse is just so great because

252
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,240
if you do it every single day you're

253
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,240
protecting your liver even if you're

254
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,120
somebody that's just eating whatever

255
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,320
like if you're having chicken if you're

256
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,360
somebody that eats animal protein and

257
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
you have chicken every day if you do the

258
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,480
morning cleanse and then you have

259
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,760
chicken at the end of the day you're

260
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,600
still doing incredible powerful things

261
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,560
for your liver especially if the heavy

262
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,440
metal detox smoothie is in your morning

263
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,079
cleanse if that's in there you're really

264
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,800
working on getting the metals out

265
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,600
getting the junk out the garbage out

266
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,760
it's really powerful so so many people

267
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,000
they'll have like you know grassa beef

268
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,880
or some kind of animal product have it

269
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,639
at the end of the day do the morning

270
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,320
plans in the morning keep the fats out

271
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,360
in the morning the first half of the day

272
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,040
that's the key right there so how does

273
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,000
this work if you like salmon if you like

274
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,160
fish if you like chicken if you like

275
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,360
meat if you like avocados if you like

276
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:14,200
nuts and seeds whatever it is that's an

277
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,040
overt fat keep it out until after 12

278
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,320
then I actually prefer if you keep it

279
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:23,000
out even longer than that maybe till 3

280
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,399
keep overt fats out till 3 if you're

281
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,600
going to have the over fats you can even

282
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,920
go later keep them out till 6 if you'd

283
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,120
like but but I'm going to go into the

284
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,920
morning cleanse a little bit and what

285
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,440
that means to start with lemon water

286
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,680
that's one thing right there so let me

287
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,839
start getting some things out and then

288
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,040
we'll talk about what this morning

289
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:44,839
cleanse does for the liver what it does

290
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,839
for the body and we go into that so I'm

291
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,399
excited all right so I'm going to crack

292
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,959
open a lemon right here you

293
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,480
guys this is how easy it

294
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,040
is the morning cleanse is so hard I

295
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,959
can't do it it's just too hard I just

296
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,639
did it just did a piece of it right

297
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:13,279
there for you simple is that 16 to 32 oz

298
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:16,279
of water squeeze a half a lemon right in

299
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,279
it and you're

300
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,560
good

301
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,480
okay not hot

302
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,800
water don't do hot water so it's really

303
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,120
important to know all right cold water

304
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,720
is fine luk warm water water is fine

305
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:37,760
room temperature water is fine don't do

306
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,959
hot water you just destroyed the lemon's

307
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,120
ability to give you a liver flush in the

308
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,680
morning to flush out the toxins and the

309
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,000
poisons you took the lemon and you

310
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,440
cooked it once you cook the lemon it

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,120
does something different now you can

312
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,639
cook lemon you can put it in food you

313
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,040
can prepare food you can put it in

314
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,600
dishes and stir fries and cook it down

315
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,440
it's fine but when you put lemon

316
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,800
in hot water you destroyed the

317
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,480
mechanisms phytochemical compounds that

318
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
work in a specific way with the Living

319
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,519
Water built inside of that lemon and the

320
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,720
calcium that comes deep within the clay

321
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,360
of the earth that goes in the lemon

322
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,440
roots and up into the lemon tree and out

323
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,639
into that fruit you just annihilated all

324
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,440
of it basically you have yeah still some

325
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,720
nutrients and still some good stuff in

326
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,320
there but you destroyed the living Fresh

327
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,800
Fresh Living power that it has from the

328
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,560
traes minerals and phytochemical comp

329
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,680
compounds that have to stay floating in

330
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,600
this suspension of living water inside

331
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,800
of the lemon you destroyed it when you

332
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,760
do hot water keep that in mind so and CU

333
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
I see it every day I'm doing my my hot

334
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,959
lemon water I'm doing my hot lemon water

335
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,760
aw I'm like great that's good glad to

336
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,720
hear that it's not doing what it needs

337
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,000
to do it's doing something else it's

338
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,800
good for you it's great for you it might

339
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,720
help you go to the bathroom a little bit

340
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,000
that does happen right so if you do that

341
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,600
it might help you in a different way but

342
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,279
it's not going to help you with what

343
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,759
you're trying to do flush out the liver

344
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,040
flush out the toxins and poisons so the

345
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,720
first part of the morning cleanse is you

toxins it's working for you so that's

364
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,199
what the liver does

365
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,800
all night long while you're sleeping

366
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,800
your liver's awake a lot of times people

367
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,519
can't sleep good cuz the livers are

368
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,880
spasming because they're working hard

369
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,519
they're malfunctioning they're having

370
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,199
difficult difficult abilities to work

371
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,040
difficult difficult time functioning so

372
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,480
what happens is as your liver is working

373
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,199
all through the night cleaning out the

374
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,480
toxins and cleaning out the poisons and

375
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,040
getting them ready to be packaged up to

376
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,680
go out the door to get to the kidneys

377
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,880
and go out the door the lemon water

378
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,079
comes in first thing in the morning and

379
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,360
starts to grab onto the garbage and

380
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:38,759
flushes it out that's the key but once

381
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,839
again important information get a piece

382
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:48,120
of paper out get a pen okay no hot water

383
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,959
with the lemon it just doesn't work it

384
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,759
won't give you that flush it won't help

385
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,000
your skin it won't help your body detox

386
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,800
it won't help your bloodstream clean up

387
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,319
it won't help your lymphatic system so

388
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,480
you go into a spa and you go in there

389
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,880
you know what they give you now in the

390
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,920
spa besides cucumbers on the eyes you

391
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,040
know what they give you they give you a

392
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:14,040
cup of hot lemon water why thank you oh

393
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,440
fantastic I'm glad I'm spending $75,000

394
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,000
in this Spa right now can you give me a

395
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,560
hot glass of lemon water that sucks it's

396
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,759
not going to even flush or cleanse me on

397
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,319
any level that's how it works and that's

398
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:26,800
what they do they give out hot lemon

399
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,399
water you want it lukewarm room

400
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,759
temperature I just have to say I have to

401
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,920
say say a thousand times and guess what

402
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,800
5 years from now I'll be saying it again

403
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,160
because there going to be a whole bunch

404
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,519
of people that are putting it in hot

405
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,319
water it's like crazy okay so that's the

406
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,040
first part of it right

407
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,959
there let's go into the second part what

408
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,240
I like for the morning

409
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:49,920

418
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,600
stick that's still going on out there

419
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,760
there's also a bunch of rumors out there

420
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,000
celer is bad for your skin celery's you

421
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,799
know bad for this bad for that they're

422
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,559
still doing it out there the truth is

423
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,799
though they can't keep enough celery in

424
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,880
the world in stores they can't keep

425
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,439
enough in stock it is the biggest

426
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:31,000
produce crop herb crop there is on the

427
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,440
planet right now the largest there are

428
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,280
thousands upon thousands upon thousands

429
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,640
of celery Farms because of medical medum

430
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,840
information everywhere on the planet

431
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,440
growing celery there are trucks that

432
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,160
deliver it just filled with celery not

433
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,520
apples and celery not apples and

434
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,840
cucumbers and C celery that's how insane

435
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,480
it is it's in every health food store

436
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,600
worldwide you can go into every hotel

437
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,039
and order a celery juice right now

438
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,159
that's how serious it is

439
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,600
and so there's a reason for that because

440
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,880
it really does help people heal whether

441
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,240
they know it or not in in the sense

442
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,159
where they you know whether they feel it

443
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,080
or don't feel it it's changing their

444
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,840
lives it's why they keep on drinking it

445
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,919
because they know it's doing something

446
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,720
one way or the other it might not do

447
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,600
something within a minute but it might

448
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,120
do something within a day it might not

449
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,679
do something within a day for one person

450
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,440
but then it does something in a month

451
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,200
where it changes their life everybody's

452
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,400
different I see acid reflux go away in

453
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,520
one week for people I see skin problems

454
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,880
go away in one month for people celery

455
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,480
juice is one of these incredible

456
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,640
Miracles that we have an herbal medicine

457
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,320
Miracle that's at your fingertips it's

458
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,120
the second thing I would recommend for

459
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,000
the morning cleanse right here is celery

460
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,280
juice I got mine I'm excited here it is

461
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,480
so you got your lemon water you got your

462
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,760
celery juice the next is you can go

463
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,679
anywhere with this okay you can just do

464
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,480
plain fruit you can cut up some apples

465
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,280
you can do that you can do a lot of

466
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,760
different things you can do apples you

467
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,720

468
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,200
grapefruit I was doing some grapefruit

469
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,480
juice I have it right here I'm going to

470
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,799
have another sip right now if you don't

471
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,799
mind so

472
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,600
good you can do apples you can do a

473
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,080
fruit plate you can have pears I'm

474
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,799
cutting up a few right

475
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,400
now all

476
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,120
right you can just have plain fruit is

477
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,919
what I'm trying to say

478
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,360
just plain old

479
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,840
fruit you can make a nice fruit dish you

480
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,760
can put assortment of apples and berries

481
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,960
together I got blackberries right here I

482
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,880
got raspberries right there and

483
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,840
blueberries so what I love about the

484
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:51,640
morning cleanse is that you're not

485
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,440
fasting fasting taxes the

486
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,600
adrenals that's what taxes the adrenals

487
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,360
I hear out there a bunch of

488
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,880
different rumors that started by

489
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,799
naysayers and haters and critics and

490
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,520
they say oh cleansing too hard on

491
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:09,159
medical medium cleansing too hard it's

492
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,919
hard on my adrenals well that's funny

493
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,360
because it's not hard on your adrenals

494
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,200
it's impossible to be hard on your

495
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,640
adrenals unless you stop eating if you

496
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,559
stop eating for a complete day if you do

497
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,760
a water fast for seven days if you do a

498
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,000
water fast if you do intermittent

499
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:29,960
fasting if you don't eat all day but you

500
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,799
drink coffee that's hard on the adrenals

501
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,840
that is what hurts adrenals right there

502
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,919
another thing that's hard on the

503
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,039
adrenals if you're eating too much over

504
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:44,400
it fat over it fat takes adrenaline to

505
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,200
actually help disperse okay so what

506
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,240
happens is when we eat too much

507
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,919
overfat the overfat doesn't get broken

508
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,640
down too easy because the bile reserves

509
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,360
are low in the liver it's not dispersing

510
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,039
the fat well enough the fat ends up in

511
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,240
the bloodstream

512
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,880
too high in the bloodstream you end up

513
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,840
getting insulin

514
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,200
resistance the body then calls for

515
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,440
adrenaline and your adrenals are now

516
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,720
pumping out adrenaline the adrenaline is

517
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,880
to thin out the blood it's kind of like

518
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,039
gasoline turpentine it's a thinner a

519
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,640
blood thinner so that's what adrenaline

520
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,120
is for us it thins out the blood

521
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,320
adrenaline is used for all kinds of

522
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,440
things like if you're exercising what

523
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,240
happens if your blood is too thick and

524
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,919
you're exercising Ing and your heart

525
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,159
starts to struggle cuz your blood is so

526
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:33,440
thick cuz you're it's all filled your

527
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,120
bloodstreams filled with fat while

528
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,520
you're exercising while you're running

529
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,960
or doing something what happens is that

530
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,960
after your exercising your adrenals will

531
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,480
release more and more adrenaline to get

532
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,679
into your bloodstream to try to thin out

533
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,039
the blood so you don't die of a heart

534
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,200
attack while you're

535
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,960
exercising so our adrenals are always

536
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:55,200
that blood thinner for us keeping the

537
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,679
fats dispersed keeping the blood thinner

538
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,000
so we don't have a heart attack we don't

539
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,600
have a stroke and that's what our

540
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,400
adrenals do but what happens is when

541
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,000
we're eating over fats in the morning

542
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,960
now our adrenals are boom all on if you

543
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,919
have chocolate if you have cream in your

544
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,600
coffee if you have something like an

545
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,880
avocado in the morning your adrenals are

546
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,200
now releasing adrenaline to try to

547
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,799
disperse it and thin it out I'm not

548
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,679
saying avocado is bad that's not it

549
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,279
something you can eat later on in the

550
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,080
day but people are used to running on

551
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,520
their own adrenaline they're addicted to

552
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,559
their own adrenaline that's what people

553
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,559
are

554
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,360
they have

555
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,720
adrenal addiction epinephrine adrenaline

556
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,960
addiction that's what they have they run

557
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,159
an adrenaline all day long and they like

558
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,480
it it feels good gives them energy feels

559
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,120
like they got energy they're on caffeine

560
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,279
they're on chocolate they're on coffee

561
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,640
they're on espressos they're on Macha

562
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:53,159
tea they're on green tea and they got

563
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,799
that caffeine pumping and so their

564
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,720
adrenals are just constantly pumping so

565
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,799
they're on adrenaline then they hop on a

566
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,320
treadmill or their EX exercising they're

567
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,919
exercising trying to use up all that

568
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,000
adrenaline right and then they go and

569
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:05,400
they eat something where I'm going to

570
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,520
eat a whole bunch of high protein or a

571
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,039
whole bunch of protein they end up

572
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,919
eating a whole bunch of fat with that

573
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:13,520
protein because it's mixed in it's

574
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:16,080
naturally there and when they do that

575
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,520
their adrenals are now doing it again

576
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,600
they're just releasing adrenaline

577
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,520
adrenaline so we live on adrenaline

578
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,159
we're Adrenaline Junkies most of us walk

579
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,880

580
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:30,559

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,720
of a medical medium

585
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,600
369 you go off of a medical medium 28

586
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,640

releasing adrenaline and you're feeling

598
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,039
better because you did all the work you

599
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,360
re you basically refurbish them all

600
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,360
throughout the time you're doing the

601
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,080
medical medium cleanses you restored

602
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,480
them all throughout the time you're

603
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,400
doing medical medium cleanses and so

604
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,399
what people don't realize is that

605
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,799
medical me cleanses bring back the

606
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:29,799
adrenals now

607
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:36,200
intermittent fasting is not a medical

608
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,559
medium cleanse it destroys the

609
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,360
adrenals water

610
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,440
fasting long term for reasons that are

611
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,120
not

612
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,720
emergency is not a medical medium

613
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,279
thing it's not and that destroys the

614
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,520
adrenal

615
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,960
glands so there are lots of different

616
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,080
things that hurt

617
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,480
adrenals and medical medum information

618
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,000
doesn't do that it's not about

619
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,000
that it's about preserving the adrenals

620
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,559
keeping them strong keeping them healthy

621
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,520
I got some Millet in the pot right here

622
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,559

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:20,559

cleanse I'm excited it's all right

703
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,279
there's a reason why you're eating

704
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,159
chocolate for the last 10 days there is

705
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:50,760
a

706
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,600
reason it could be anything emotional

707
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:56,880
emotional reason you're having a tough

708
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,840
time maybe a difficult time maybe you're

709
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,880
under stress maybe you're going through

710
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,840
a lot maybe you're just addicted and

711
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,799
you're having that chocolate because you

712
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,480
feel like you need it that the addiction

713
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:09,320
maybe you're running on adrenaline

714
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,159
because of that chocolate it's it's

715
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,080
cranking your adrenaline it's keeping

716
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,640
you functioning for the moment maybe

717
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,760
it's helping your brain where you're

718
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,480
thinking a little better and clearer but

719
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,080
it's it's kind of a vicious cycle

720
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,360
because you're thinking a little clearer

721
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,480
and then all of a sudden you got to come

722
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,320
down from it it's like a roller coaster

723
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,919
ride the chocolate brings you

724
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,960
up tread every on the roller coaster is

725
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,880
going up you're going up and then

726
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,919

mess something up how big do you like

839
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,760
your cookies you like them small I like

840
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:51,760
them a little bigger popping that one in

841
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,200
there I don't really like tiny

842
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,639
cookies I know that like sometimes

843
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,160
people make them really small I like

844
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,040
making them bigger but you know what

845
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,480
that's a little too big right

846
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,280
there I'm going to make

847
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,720
these

848
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,320
nice you make a smaller cookie you can

849
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,240
eat more of them right people do that

850
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:16,839
they're like they feel like they are

851
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,040
less guilty if they eat a bunch of small

852
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:21,880
ones but you don't have to be guilty

853
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,079
about these I'm

854
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,640
excited all right make some different

855
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:31,400
sizes here so what happens is if you

856
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:34,480
keep the overt fats out of your diet out

857
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,680
of your way in the morning your liver

858
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,680
can actually clean this means that if

859
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,359
you've eaten fat in the morning most of

860
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,839
your life your liver never got a chance

861
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,480
to ever cleanse cleanse as far as things

862
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:51,440
that are deep deep inside your liver

863
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,599
never got a chance to cleanse out

864
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,560
poisons and toxins that were deep in

865
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,079
there maybe a few surface toxins escaped

866
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:03,000
a few surface

867
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:05,800
toxins but not the Deep stuff definitely

868
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,160
certainly not the metals for sure no

869
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,240
metals are coming out toxic heavy metals

870
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,040
sit inside the liver inside the organs

871
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:17,079
in the brain for a lifetime until you

872
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,079
wake up one morning you're like who Am I

873
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,400
who am I until you wake up in the

874
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,119
morning and you're walking down the

875
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,800
street in your

876
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,480
underpants and you're actually

877
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:33,079
jaywalking in your underpants

878
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,480
and there's a alert out on you because

879
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,880
you're

880
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,200
missing that's what

881
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,599
happens when the metals build up and the

882
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,720
metals build up and they build

883
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,839
up they build up until you're at your

884
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:52,319
psychiatrist's office on four

885
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:55,079
anti-depressants and then on four anti-

886
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:59,040
anxieties the metals build up and build

887
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:02,040
up until your OC CD is so bad that you

888
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,560
are just totally freaked out with

889
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,280
everything that's happening in your life

890
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,560
and you're suffering and this is not a

891
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,440
joke you're

892
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:14,040
suffering the metals can build up so

893
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,319
bad where you know your eczema and your

894
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,480
psoriasis and your skin problems are

895
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:22,440
really really out of

896
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,960
control metals can build up so bad that

897
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,960
your autoimmune and your chronic

898
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,800
fatigue can get just so bad because

899
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,800
viruses like the upsteam bar are feeding

900
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,720
off your metals and you're really

901
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:40,560
struggling and then people don't realize

902
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,000
they can get so bad that you can get to

903
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,599
the point where you don't you have like

904
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,079
delusions you actually don't even know

905
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,440
who you are or where you are anymore

906
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,680
dementia not just

907
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,800
Alzheimer's and so Metals create a lot

908
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,119
of trouble in so many people all right

909

1094
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,920
don't hear me talk about

1095
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,880
binders because the ultimate binder is

1096
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,200
actually in the drink that's why I I

1097
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,760
don't need to talk about binders but you

1098
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,200
guys need to talk about binders out

1099
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,119
there that are like naysayers are like

1100
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,119
he doesn't know about

1101
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,800
binders all

1102
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:13,599
right anyway there it is right there the

1103
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,119
pectin from the wild blueberry by far

1104
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,680
one of the greatest ultimate binders the

1105
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,200
wild blueberry and the anthocyans are

1106
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,559
the ultimate

1107
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,800
binder and so have you noticed something

1108
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,200
have you guys noticed something the wild

1109
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,680
blueberry what it does have you noticed

1110
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,680
something about what happens here it

1111
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,920
gels up have you noticed that it starts

1112
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,160
to gel take a look right here give it a

1113
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,599
little time how many of you guys made

1114
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,880
the heavy metal detox smoothie and it

1115
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,240
gelled up to the point where it was like

1116
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,640
jello where you're doing this like clunk

1117
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,800
clunk clun clunk clunk and it was like

1118
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:49,400
jell give it a couple of minutes it's

1119
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,359
congealing right now as we

1120
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,440
speak why is it

1121
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:57,720
congealing that's the

1122
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:01,200
binder that is is the wild the

1123
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:03,920
blueberry that is the ultimate binder

1124
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,839
right there that's what it's for nobody

1125
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,480
knew that the wild blueberry had

1126
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,160
anything to do with removing toxic heavy

1127
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:14,280
metals that's mm info right nobody knew

1128
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,480
that ever okay because a berry won't do

1129
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,680
it a just a plain old Berry won't do it

1130
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,359
a cultivated blueberry won't do it

1131
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,240
people don't know people didn't know it

1132
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:24,359
did it they had no idea what could even

1133
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,640
take out of metal and now worldwide

1134
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:29,880
right now people are talking about oh

1135
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:33,160
the wild blueberry and the other things

1136
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:36,200
that are in here and and the key is

1137
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,680
you'll see like it's starting to now gel

1138
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,440
right there it is it's starting to turn

1139
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:43,400
into Jello-O so it's now getting thicker

1140
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,880
and thicker right it's congealing right

1141
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,480
there in front of us that's what it's

1142
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,839
doing so it's getting less liquidy by

1143
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,640
the minute how many of you guys have

1144
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:53,319
left your heavy metal detox smoothie

1145
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,720
somewhere like on the counter or

1146
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:57,839
something in somewhere in the kitchen or

1147
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:02,000
maybe in your office or in your car and

1148
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:05,640
it basically turned into almost like

1149
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,559
jello where if you dump the glass over

1150
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,599
it would it would come out almost in one

1151
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,559
piece how many people have done that

1152
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,480
that's the

1153
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:19,599
binder it's why I've never talked about

1154
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,760
a binder because it is a

1155
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:26,079
binder that is one of the things that we

1156
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,720
need to understand

1157
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,319
but it's amazing any anywhere someone

1158
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,880
can get away with anything they can

1159
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,040
they'll be like okay let's throw that at

1160
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,760
him let's try to chop him down a little

1161
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,319
bit let's try to chip away at him a

1162
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,440
little bit more let's say he doesn't

1163
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,920
know anything about binders let's start

1164
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,200
talking about all the bonite clay and

1165
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,880
all the other stuff and all the other

1166
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:47,040
garbage that we're putting in the smooth

1167
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:50,920
let's talk about that dude you missed it

1168
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:53,359
you missed the boat it is a binder sorry

1169
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:56,079
anyway and there it is heavy metal detox

1170
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:58,240
smoothie it is the ultimate nature B

1171
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:02,000
says oh my God I think I have the wrong

1172
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,680
blueberries European ones they don't gel

1173
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,400
it's because they could be calling them

1174
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,280
the wild blueberry but they're not a

1175
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,920
wild blueberry I noticed in Europe they

1176
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,720
do that so there's a there's there's

1177
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,520
they use like bilberries and stuff like

1178
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,920
that and they call them a wild blueberry

1179
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,359
but they're not a wild blueberry and

1180
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,160
people just don't know this so all

1181
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,720
through Europe right now that's what's

1182
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,760
happening they're not using the wild

1183
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,400
blueberry they're not they're using a

1184
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,680
different Berry and that different Berry

1185
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,119
might have a different makeup of

1186
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,160
antioxidants it might even be higher

1187
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,640
than an antioxidant but that's not the

1188
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,319
key that's not how it works for removing

1189
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,920
Metals it takes the wild bluebery to

1190
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,520
remove metals because there's a

1191
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,240
difference because of its binding

1192
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,400
properties are unlike anything else and

1193
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:46,000
unmatched and you can't measure that

1194
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,960
good luck go ahead and try The Binding

1195
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,079
properties in the wild blueberry

1196
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,559
supersede anything in the European what

1197
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,440
they call a wild blueberry that's a

1198
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:56,119
billberry or whatever supersedes

1199
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,200
it

1200
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,920
and that's how it works it's not about

1201
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,760
how much antioxidant you have that

1202
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,799
doesn't determine how like if the metals

1203
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,680
leave or not that's only and there's

1204
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:10,319
different antioxidants you can't just BL

1205
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,720
do a blatant thing where you're saying

1206
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,839
antioxidant and there all every antiox

1207
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,640
there's antioxidants in coffee does that

1208
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:18,760
take out Metals no instead it kills your

1209
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,400
brain there's like you you have to

1210
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,359
understand you can have an antioxidant

1211
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:27,240
in something there's antioxidant in

1212
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:28,880
psilocybin

1213
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,480
but it doesn't mean it's good for you on

1214
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,880
any level there's antioxidants in every

1215
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,680
Berry but it doesn't mean it's going to

1216
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,319
be the one to remove the

1217
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:40,920
metals so what I noticed in Europe and

1218
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:42,880
it's just no no disrespect on any level

1219
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,480
but I'm noticing they're packaging up

1220
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,079
different berries out there and they're

1221
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,160
telling people that this is going to do

1222
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,640
it this is going to remove your Metals

1223
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,119
this is what you use in the hdms this

1224
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,760
here's what it is and what they don't

1225
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:56,119
realize is it may have a different

1226
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,680
composition of antioxidant it may maybe

1227
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,359
maybe even a higher composition of

1228
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,359
antioxidant doesn't mean that's the

1229
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,680
antioxidant that helps in guiding Metals

1230
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,440
out and it doesn't mean that's the one

1231
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,359
that has the high enough gelatinous

1232
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,520
binder that doesn't mean any of that and

1233
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:09,200
that's the difference and that's the

1234
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,160
difference with s so and why things work

1235
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,240
and what they don't they also haven't

1236
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,079
discovered all the antioxidants that

1237
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,839
they're able to even measure in the wild

1238
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,640
BL to be to begin with they haven't even

1239
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,040
measured them and looked at all of them

1240
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,960
and that's a whole another thing on its

1241
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,319
own it's what works it's not about

1242
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,640
waiting for science every second it's

1243
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:29,559
about what works and what the track

1244
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,839
record is the track record of people

1245
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:32,040
getting out of wheelchairs the track

1246
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,359
record of people getting rid of

1247
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:36,960
depression that's the track record I'm

1248
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:38,400
talking about not some article somewhere

1249
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,280
that's going to chop up a bunch of

1250
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,720
studies that never really happened it's

1251
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,040
about what is going to work because when

1252
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,440
you're Downing out and you're on your

1253
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,400
hands and knees and you're praying to

1254
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,400
God and you're like I'm going to die if

1255
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,839
I don't get better I am literally think

1256
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,680
I think I'm going to die my I have 50

1257
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,000
neurological symptoms no no one

1258
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,760
understands me no one gets what I've

1259
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,480
gone through and what I'm going through

1260
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,680
and I think I'm dying and I have no hope

1261
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,920
left it's about what works that's when

1262
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,520
it counts boom it's about what works and

1263
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,720
that's where it is and I'm noticing out

1264
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,559
there I get it there's a lot of people

1265
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,359
that are like just like no you can put

1266
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:14,760
this Berry inside of a canister you can

1267
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:16,359
put this Berry inside of a glass jar and

1268
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,079
look or whatever you want to do and

1269
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:21,079
Market it the way you want doesn't mean

1270
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,839
that's a wild blueberry they may call it

1271
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:24,839
a wild blueberry you can call anything

1272
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:26,319
yeah okay sure here's a wild blueberry

1273
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,440
everybody here it is this is a wild

1274
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,960
blueberry I'm going to put it in a

1275
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,000
package now that's a Blackberry but no

1276
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,000
I'll call it a wild blueberry that's

1277
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,200
what people can do and it's crazy point

1278
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,240
is is the wild blueberry what you see

1279
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,599
right here that's the one and it's

1280
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,559
getting actually starting to really

1281
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,720
congeal right now and get actually to a

1282
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:46,640
point all right you guys I'm just saying

1283
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,000
this because there's a lot of people

1284
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,920
that they don't

1285
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
know they may not know why they're

1286
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,520
healing as fast as they want to heal and

1287
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,400
that's that's part of it too so it all

1288
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,079
matters every little bit matters The

1289
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,960
Details Matter so we just made the heavy

1290
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,240

that in things in the morning this is

1367
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,559
the morning Cleanse This is a hearty

1368
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,480
option for a morning cleanse breakfast

1369
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:05,720
right there there it is

1370
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:08,359
millet with wild blueberries and a

1371
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,680
little bit of maple syrup incredible

1372
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,880
we're going to I can't wait to try a

1373
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,559
little later let's check out those

1374
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,799
cookies they're

1375
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:18,839
cooking cookies are just about done I'd

1376
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:21,880
say a few more minutes okay now we're

1377
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:25,640
going to make a hardboiled

1378
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:27,000
egg that's next now what I like about

1379
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:30,039
these hardboiled

1380
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,559
eggs is they're not like the other

1381
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:34,319
hard-boiled eggs that we're talking

1382
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:37,960
about these are much

1383
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:40,119
different and much more fun to make I

1384
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,839
think I think they're more fun to make

1385
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:43,720
so you can have somebody that like

1386
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:46,799
really wants that hearty flavor that

1387
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:49,200
hearty taste something hearty inside of

1388
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,559
them I recommend this so so let's start

1389
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,599
making these hard-boiled eggs so what

1390
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,839
you see is a rusted potato right there

1391
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,280
now it takes a little creativity

1392
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,880
so in the sense where you're going to

1393
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,720
make these I'm going to cut a piece

1394
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,319
right off that potato just like that

1395
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:07,319
take a look you guys okay all

1396
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:10,240
right and I'm going to peel this potato

1397
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:13,960
in the shape of an egg this is so simple

1398
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:16,160
and so easy it's ridiculous okay see

1399
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,920
peeling this and I'm even going slow

1400
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,920
instead of fast so I do like to do

1401
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:24,960
things quicker but I'm taking my time on

1402
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,079
this one there we go I'm going to make a

1403
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,079
few of these right here there's one

1404
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:32,799
hardboiled egg look at that I'm going to

1405
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,799
grab a little

1406
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,240
bowl what I'm going to

1407
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,960
do okay is I'm going to use that bowl in

1408
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,160
a

1409
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,880
minute it's one hardboiled egg right

1410
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,680
there I'm going to make another

1411
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,920
hardboiled egg out of the same potato

1412
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:54,720
check this out okay now you can save

1413
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,119

1414
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,359

00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:06,039
already right so there we go okay I'm

1417
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,839

01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,160
bowl

1448
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:30,440
what I like about what what I like about

1449
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,440
black

1450
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:36,480
salt is it's not as high in

1451
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,559
sodium well it depends on which black

1452
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,839
salt it is don't quote me on that

1453
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,200
because there's different black salts

1454
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,640
out there all right there we go put a

1455
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,559
little bit of that in

1456
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:49,559

that hardboiled egg and I'm going to dip

1460
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,680
it in the black salt just like

1461
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,160
this you can do less black salt you can

1462
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,119
do more of it you want to just do a

1463
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,119
little touch to sprinkle it on it like

1464
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:08,960
for example see these three that's the

1465
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:11,279
way I did it right there for guests for

1467
01:02:11,279 --> 01:02:15,079

1468
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,160
you might want to do it this way you

1469
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:18,520
take some black salt and you just

1470
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:22,000

01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,160
a little closeup here personally I like

1566
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,000
them when they got a little bit of that

1567
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,720
brown when they're browned a little bit

1568
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,359
that that look do you see that look you

1569
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:42,680
guys right there you guys see that look

1570
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:43,960
right right how amazing is that look at

1571
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:47,200
these

1572
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:49,200
cookies these are oatmeal banana cookies

1573
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,079
there's no ins the resistance going on

1574
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,720
with this there's no blood sugar spikes

1575
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:56,240
going on with this because there's no

1576
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,839
oil oil in here to battle the sugar so

1577
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,480
when you're eating this this isn't this

1578
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:01,799
isn't about having that oil or that fat

1579
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,960
in here there's no peanut butter in

1580
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:05,559
these cookies there's no almonds there's

1581
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,000
no chocolate chips in these cookies

1582
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:08,960
that's the fat right there that will

1583
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
stop your morning cleanse so if you make

1584
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,200
your oatmeal cookie with chocolate

1585
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,400
chocolate chips there's no cleansing

1586
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,760
your liver is not going to cleanse it's

1587
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,319
not going to happen because the overt

1588
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,520
fat is going to make your liver go into

1589
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:21,160
overdrive and it's going to produce a

1590
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,520
lot of bile and it's not going to be

1591
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,599
able to actually cleanse it's going to

1592
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,920
be busy producing B

1593
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:28,880
so the whole point of the medical

1594
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:32,039
meeting morning cleanse is to not have

1595
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,960
to have your liver go into production

1596
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:37,480
and start producing too much bile to

1597
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,200
break down fats and when you actually

1598
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,640
stop that process where you stop your

1599
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,760
liver from having to break down for

1600
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,119
having to worry about breaking down fats

1601
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,319
and producing too much bile once you

1602
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:49,880
stop your liver from having to do that

1603
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:52,480
you give your liver a break where it

1604
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,880
could its only focus from there on out

1605
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,400
is cleansing out the poisons the toxins

1606
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,039
and the junk you want your liver to only

1607
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,920
have one Focus every morning and that's

1608
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:05,559
to clean out the

1609
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:08,480
poisons that's the Focus right there you

1610
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:09,720
want your liver to have one job one huge

1611
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,160
job yeah it's got a bunch of other

1612
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,760
little jobs it's working on too but you

1613
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,920
want it to focus on that one big job and

1614
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,520
that job is to release poisons and

1615
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,279
toxins and get them out of the body and

1616
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,040
it won't do that if you bring in an over

1617
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,520
fat in the morning you have coffee with

1618
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,480

doing something else they're selling

1736
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:06,480

back into keto year seven they're vegans

1740
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:19,199
now all the health experts and authors

1741
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:22,000
to included right year eight they were

1742
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,840

staying away from fat for some reason

1744
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,239
cuz they heard about it from

1745
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:33,520
somewhere and I'm just saying year you

1746
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:35,159
know year one year two year three heck

1747
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,040
they do it every 6 months it's another

1748
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:38,880
change to change to something else let's

1749
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,880
take a look at this nice mango right

1750
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,679
here we'll see what we

1751
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:47,320
have I'm going to pop this on the

1752
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,560
plate okay you guys you ever see that

1753
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,440
you guys know what I'm talking about

1754
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,239
right but you know what's funny the

1755
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:54,199
medical medium information is consistent

1756
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:56,080
because guess what

1757
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:57,760
I'm not in charge of the medical medium

1758
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:00,320
information that's

1759
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,199
why if I was in charge I'd probably be

1760
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,040
doing the same old stuff everybody else

1761
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:05,120
does out there they're keto one minute

1762
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,440
then there's something else the next

1763
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,760
minute then they're like you could eat a

1764
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,000
little fish then they're like don't eat

1765
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,600
any fish they learn about heavy metals

1766
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,920
year two and they're like don't eat any

1767
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,360
fish but your first book said you could

1768
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,480
eat fish then year three they're doing

1769
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,880
something else then year four they're

1770
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,920
doing something else I would probably do

1771
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:23,560
the same thing the same stupid

1772
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:26,040
stuff if if the information was wasn't

1773
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:29,080
coming from above when it's coming from

1774
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:32,000
above it's it has to be what it has to

1775
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,000
be that's why there's no

1776
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:39,800
contradictions that's why you see

1777
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:42,840
consistency in the message for years and

1778
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:44,159
years and years 15 years 20 years going

1779
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:47,400
all the way back you see that

1780
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,400
consistency is there in the

1781
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,280
messaging it's just always there I'm

1782
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,800
going to pop in a few berries on this

1783
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:56,320
fruit plate

1784
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,320
it's like

1785
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:01,000
this I got some mangoes on here I got

1786
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:03,120
some

1787
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,199
watermelon and I'm going to pop in some

1788
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,920
orange some oranges if you guys don't

1789
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:09,960
mind what I'll do is some orange slices

1790
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:12,239
take a look at this just like

1791
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:15,239
this some orange

1792
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:15,239
slices

1793
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:22,120
okay get some orange slices on this

1794
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:25,080
which is going to be really

1795
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:27,440
nice

1796
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,960
okay get a couple more oranges and then

1797
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:31,639
we're going to make a nice we'll have

1798
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,639
this nice fruit

1799
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:38,280
plate and that's something you can do

1800
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,280
you can just just do that every single

1801
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:44,719
morning even if it's a small fruit plate

1802
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:46,920
and not a big one and you're cleansing

1803
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:48,360
your liver you're cleansing your brain

1804
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,560
cuz once your liver is cleansing your

1805
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:54,159
brain gets to release a little bit more

1806
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:56,679
