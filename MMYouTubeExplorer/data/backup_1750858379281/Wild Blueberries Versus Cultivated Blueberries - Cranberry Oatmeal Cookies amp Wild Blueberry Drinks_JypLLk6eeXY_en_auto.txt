[0.96 - 5.80] wild blueberry cultivated blueberry wild
[4.28 - 7.24] blueberry are you eating all the
[5.80 - 8.88] cultivated blueberries that's what you
[7.24 - 10.96] do I'm getting some blueberry for my
[8.88 - 13.24] smoothie I picked up some blueberries
[10.96 - 15.16] and they're cultivated blueberry meaning
[13.24 - 17.64] they're not as powerful they're not as
[15.16 - 19.36] good for you they're not a lot of things
[17.64 - 23.60] big difference between cultivated
[19.36 - 25.96] blueberry and wild blueberry thousands
[23.60 - 28.56] upon thousands of years of
[25.96 - 30.32] adaptation literally thousands of years
[28.56 - 32.32] Native Americans used to burn around
[30.32 - 34.12] fields of wild blueberry because what
[32.32 - 37.08] would happen is when they would burn it
[34.12 - 39.40] all down the blueberries would come back
[37.08 - 41.64] up everything else would be gone that's
[39.40 - 43.84] a way they used to manage the wild
[41.64 - 45.76] blueberry crops back th for thousands of
[43.84 - 47.40] years anyway you guys we're live right
[45.76 - 48.92] now and I'm making a whole bunch of
[47.40 - 50.96] different drinks which is going to be
[48.92 - 54.32] really fun I am also going to open up
[50.96 - 55.64] aw's bar and grill in a little while too
[54.32 - 57.40] that I'm going to do but I'm just going
[55.64 - 60.08] to pour a couple drinks as I need more
[57.40 - 62.60] drink myself I need a shot for myself
[60.08 - 64.84] really quick so I want to tell you guys
[62.60 - 66.80] okay that this talk about the wild
[64.84 - 69.60] blueberry is really important because
[66.80 - 71.40] don't you want the best of the best
[69.60 - 73.48] inside your body and I understand if you
[71.40 - 75.32] can't find a wild blueberry somewhere if
[73.48 - 77.96] you have no access to it but if you have
[75.32 - 79.64] access to it what an incredible support
[77.96 - 81.84] system for our body especially when the
[79.64 - 83.80] earth is getting crazy times are getting
[81.84 - 86.96] crazy people are so stressed out people
[83.80 - 89.36] are over the top stressed out and stress
[86.96 - 91.96] we need adaptogenic we need things that
[89.36 - 93.76] have anth sinins things that have powers
[91.96 - 96.32] in them and that's what we need when
[93.76 - 96.32] we're under
[96.64 - 100.72] stress our tender give me another that's
[98.68 - 103.88] just a start right there I just needed a
[100.72 - 105.04] shop right off the running but I'm going
[103.88 - 106.44] to make a lot of different drinks we're
[105.04 - 107.96] going to open up the medical medium
[106.44 - 110.44] cooking show today but we're also
[107.96 - 112.88] opening up aw's bar and grill and we got
[110.44 - 116.68] a lot to talk about let's get into it a
[112.88 - 119.00] little bit just let it hit let it h all
[116.68 - 121.12] right all right I'm just G to have
[119.00 - 122.48] myself quick little drink while we're
[121.12 - 124.40] talking about wild blueberries versus
[122.48 - 125.92] cultivated blueberries this is going to
[124.40 - 127.88] be an entertaining show meaning I'm
[125.92 - 129.28] going to be entertaining myself you guys
[127.88 - 133.04] might not be entertained but I'm going
[129.28 - 135.60] to be entertained here we go I love the
[133.04 - 138.52] sound of pouring drinks with the wild
[135.60 - 141.96] blue the big difference it's a different
[138.52 - 145.64] sound here's a goblet a
[141.96 - 147.48] goblet this is a great way to also you
[145.64 - 149.96] know when you're you don't have to have
[147.48 - 152.32] alcohol you don't have to poison your
[149.96 - 155.08] body with alcoholic beverages you don't
[152.32 - 158.04] need to you can do something better than
[155.08 - 159.72] that you can be better than that you can
[158.04 - 162.88] you can break the vices you can break
[159.72 - 165.04] the addictions if you get this stuff
[162.88 - 167.52] right here and you're pouring this for
[165.04 - 169.52] the holidays or with
[167.52 - 172.16] friends and we'll get a little close-up
[169.52 - 174.16] on this too cuz I love when the close-up
[172.16 - 175.32] camera is on this we got a goblet right
[174.16 - 178.44] here let's just see if we can get a
[175.32 - 181.80] little closeup of some wild blueberry
[178.44 - 185.32] juice going in there nice let's fill
[181.80 - 188.08] that up I'm going to drink that every
[185.32 - 191.52] bit of it I'm all of a sudden getting
[188.08 - 193.36] tipsy from all the wild blueberry juice
[191.52 - 195.08] I just want to pour a few drinks here I
[193.36 - 198.08] got this goblet here I got this what
[195.08 - 201.76] else do I have here's a nice little
[198.08 - 204.40] daquiri glass a daquiri I would have can
[201.76 - 206.00] I have a daquiri please is that okay can
[204.40 - 209.04] I have a
[206.00 - 211.12] daquiri how about that oh hold on guys
[209.04 - 214.56] all right got a lot to talk
[211.12 - 216.24] about um let's crack open another bottle
[214.56 - 217.84] that's all right here you guys I'm just
[216.24 - 219.56] waiting for you to come on too if that's
[217.84 - 221.88] okay we're going to be making a lot of
[219.56 - 223.80] different woo get that in there we're
[221.88 - 226.36] going to make a lot of different
[223.80 - 227.80] drinks I'm serious spiced apple cider
[226.36 - 229.28] wild blueberry we got all kinds of
[227.80 - 232.96] things we're going to do this is going
[229.28 - 235.08] to be a fun fun show so let's get into
[232.96 - 236.68] it let's get into the nitty-gritty and
[235.08 - 238.76] what we're talking about versus wild
[236.68 - 241.72] blueberry difference between wild
[238.76 - 243.28] blueberry and cultivated blueberry I
[241.72 - 245.52] didn't want to get any cultivated
[243.28 - 247.16] blueberries I just didn't want to I
[245.52 - 249.84] didn't want to go and get those because
[247.16 - 251.80] every time I see a cultivated
[249.84 - 254.84] blueberry every time I see it in the
[251.80 - 256.40] store or I see somebody using it I feel
[254.84 - 260.40] bad there's just something that comes
[256.40 - 262.48] over me because it's weak it's weak I
[260.40 - 265.16] support it I like blueberries of all
[262.48 - 268.20] kinds but it's not the same blueberry
[265.16 - 270.76] it's not that adaptogenic power it's not
[268.20 - 272.48] that high antiox oant rate it's not any
[270.76 - 274.44] of that the anthocyans are different
[272.48 - 277.52] it's not the same thing so I'll give you
[274.44 - 281.96] little differences here a wild
[277.52 - 285.20] food can survive on its own through
[281.96 - 288.64] drought through floods through freezing
[285.20 - 290.44] Tundra cold the cultivated blueberry was
[288.64 - 292.32] a blueberry that wasn't just growing in
[290.44 - 294.44] the wild so it's not like hey you know
[292.32 - 295.84] these blueberries have been around for
[294.44 - 299.60] thousands of years not true the
[295.84 - 302.80] cultivated blueberry was a spinoff a
[299.60 - 305.04] spin-off a cultivated spin-off from its
[302.80 - 306.20] cousins the wild blueberry big
[305.04 - 308.12] difference with the wild blueberry
[306.20 - 309.36] versus the cultivated blueberry so I
[308.12 - 310.92] want to give you one thing that's really
[309.36 - 315.12] interesting
[310.92 - 318.28] okay what happens if a disease hits a
[315.12 - 321.72] crop if a disease hits a
[318.28 - 323.52] crop the crop can get annihilated and
[321.72 - 325.52] we're going to have disease hitting
[323.52 - 329.60] crops in the future because of all the
[325.52 - 332.84] gming all the heavy heavy GMO right all
[329.60 - 334.48] of that just to begin with but crops are
[332.84 - 336.68] not going to be able to be strong enough
[334.48 - 339.64] they're not going to be able to sustain
[336.68 - 342.60] a massive blow and that will be coming
[339.64 - 344.44] in the future with crops so the
[342.60 - 346.20] difference with what I'm saying is like
[344.44 - 349.48] a cultivated crop like say the
[346.20 - 351.72] cultivated a blueberry if a fungus comes
[349.48 - 354.08] and eventually becomes strong enough and
[351.72 - 357.80] hits a sensitivity in the crop and takes
[354.08 - 360.36] out an entire cultivated blueberry crop
[357.80 - 363.24] worldwide which it can it can do that
[360.36 - 367.20] for virtually any crop by the way if it
[363.24 - 369.28] does this the whole crop goes that's how
[367.20 - 371.68] it works the difference with wild
[369.28 - 373.20] blueberries is there are hundreds and
[371.68 - 376.40] hundreds and hundreds of different
[373.20 - 379.52] strains of wild blueberry plants in the
[376.40 - 382.16] same crop in the same like if you look
[379.52 - 385.68] at a wild Blueberry Field this is
[382.16 - 387.84] important to know there are hundreds of
[385.68 - 389.96] different
[387.84 - 392.28] Geniuses oh I just saying say it that
[389.96 - 394.68] way there are hundreds of different
[392.28 - 396.80] varieties hundreds of different strains
[394.68 - 398.48] they all look the same almost it's all
[396.80 - 401.04] wild blueberries it's all sitting in the
[398.48 - 405.20] field the difference
[401.04 - 407.52] is that there are different plants even
[405.20 - 410.40] though it's the same plant all within
[407.52 - 413.96] that field that means that if disease
[410.40 - 418.20] comes to the wild blueberry crop it may
[413.96 - 420.56] only take out one or two species of
[418.20 - 423.68] plant amongst the the entire field of
[420.56 - 427.08] wild blueberries if a disease comes to a
[423.68 - 430.28] cultivated crop it'll wipe the entire
[427.08 - 432.40] cultivated crop out that's how it
[430.28 - 435.92] works so what I love about wild
[432.40 - 440.00] blueberries is because it's a
[435.92 - 442.92] spiritual fruit very spiritual a lot of
[440.00 - 445.60] reasons for that it's a survival
[442.92 - 447.36] mechanism it also feeds animals and
[445.60 - 451.00] keeps animals alive so here's another
[447.36 - 453.84] thing too the cultivated blueberry and
[451.00 - 456.28] done and gone it's not there for
[453.84 - 459.72] wildlife it's not there for the survival
[456.28 - 462.48] of wildlife too the wild blueberry is
[459.72 - 465.36] powerful if it stays there and the cold
[462.48 - 468.36] comes and it freezes on the vines they
[465.36 - 470.88] sit there Frozen and just available for
[468.36 - 474.36] the coyotes for the foxes for the Bears
[470.88 - 477.24] for the deer for for mice for all forms
[474.36 - 480.36] of wildlife so the the wild blueberry is
[477.24 - 482.36] actually feeding all all these different
[480.36 - 484.48] creatures and different animals
[482.36 - 487.88] something a cultivated blueberry won't
[484.48 - 490.52] do they pick the crop it's done that's
[487.88 - 492.00] it wild blueberries are growing wild
[490.52 - 493.40] they're all through the forests they're
[492.00 - 495.68] all on the plains they're all in
[493.40 - 498.44] different areas in this world and even
[495.68 - 501.44] if you harvest them there's always wild
[498.44 - 503.72] blueberries somewhere in those fields
[501.44 - 505.84] left over or somewhere on adjacent or
[503.72 - 507.88] somewhere on the outskirts of the fields
[505.84 - 512.72] feeding all kinds of different Wildlife
[507.88 - 514.60] Birds animals beer deer everything gets
[512.72 - 515.88] the Bears it gets everything fed and
[514.60 - 518.64] that's what's incredible about it all
[515.88 - 519.84] along so when I think about it I think
[518.64 - 521.76] about the W blueberry I always think
[519.84 - 524.16] about what it's doing for nature what
[521.76 - 526.92] it's doing for animal life what it's
[524.16 - 529.48] doing for that and that means a lot so
[526.92 - 531.64] what happens is when the winter sets in
[529.48 - 533.08] it's getting cold the snow starts
[531.64 - 534.32] falling these wild blueberries are
[533.08 - 535.68] floating around in all kinds of
[534.32 - 538.16] different places for all kinds of
[535.68 - 540.24] different animals to survive on deer
[538.16 - 541.48] push through the snow
[540.24 - 543.36] right they push their snoots through the
[541.48 - 545.28] snow and they actually get these wild
[543.36 - 547.72] blueberries and they use them for
[545.28 - 549.68] survival it means everything to keeping
[547.72 - 551.36] deer alive through a whole winter
[549.68 - 552.24] keeping any kind of animal alive through
[551.36 - 554.68] a whole
[552.24 - 556.36] winter so this is just one aspect of the
[554.68 - 558.04] wild bluebery now what it's doing for
[556.36 - 561.24] our bodies as far as like the
[558.04 - 563.96] anthocyanins and how it's the anti
[561.24 - 566.20] oxidizer is a whole another level of
[563.96 - 568.04] power all on its own so we're oxidizing
[566.20 - 570.76] that's what we're doing we actually
[568.04 - 574.48] oxidize so when we age we're oxidizing
[570.76 - 576.40] when we age that's how it works so every
[574.48 - 580.20] free radicals and toxins that are
[576.40 - 581.84] floating around our bodies oxidize us
[580.20 - 585.52] aets that are actually flowing through
[581.84 - 588.36] our body oxidizes us so everything's out
[585.52 - 590.24] to get us toxins and poisons and
[588.36 - 593.36] chemicals and toxic heavy metals that we
[590.24 - 596.04] get exposed to are all there to oxidize
[593.36 - 598.84] us right age us or age our organs or
[596.04 - 600.56] kill our organs or break our organs down
[598.84 - 602.88] so so that's what that's what it's like
[600.56 - 605.32] here on planet Earth the chems coming
[602.88 - 607.24] out of the sky the smoke and the fog all
[605.32 - 609.56] the burning the excess burning that
[607.24 - 611.96] happens all around the world right those
[609.56 - 614.12] massive fires all the fire [ __ ] and
[611.96 - 616.04] they're dropping off all all on you know
[614.12 - 617.80] onto those fires all this stuff blowing
[616.04 - 619.68] around the DDT that's floating around
[617.80 - 621.88] the planet because DDT is still used all
[619.68 - 623.92] around the world all the pesticides
[621.88 - 626.04] herbicides the fungicides it's on the
[623.92 - 628.32] the clothes that we're wearing brand new
[626.04 - 631.48] clothing items are dous with flame
[628.32 - 634.08] retardant DED with fungicides right so
[631.48 - 636.20] we're exposed every single day fabric
[634.08 - 639.08] softeners we're exposed to detergents
[636.20 - 640.80] we're exposed to plugin air fresheners
[639.08 - 643.20] we're exposed to fragrances perfumes
[640.80 - 646.40] colognes you name it all of this stuff
[643.20 - 649.56] is oxidizing us that's what it does and
[646.40 - 651.24] it increases that oxidation level and
[649.56 - 653.08] that oxidizing makes it so everybody's
[651.24 - 655.08] running out and getting plastic surgery
[653.08 - 656.64] that's how it works why are they getting
[655.08 - 657.92] plastic surgery some people are getting
[656.64 - 659.76] plastic surgery because they want their
[657.92 - 661.44] nose in a different spot some people are
[659.76 - 662.68] getting plastic surgery I'm not harping
[661.44 - 664.60] on that I'm just saying they're getting
[662.68 - 667.00] plastic surgery right because they want
[664.60 - 668.96] some changes but most people are getting
[667.00 - 671.92] plastic surgery because their skin is
[668.96 - 674.32] starting to fail them because it's
[671.92 - 676.32] oxidizing and that's part of the aging
[674.32 - 679.00] process somebody can age faster well
[676.32 - 681.12] they're oxidizing faster someone can age
[679.00 - 684.00] takes a little longer it's taking a
[681.12 - 685.88] little longer for them them to oxidize
[684.00 - 687.60] one way or another it still doesn't even
[685.88 - 689.00] mean they're not oxidizing internally
[687.60 - 690.04] with different organs in different parts
[689.00 - 692.64] parts of their
[690.04 - 695.64] body but the world and the stress and
[692.64 - 697.32] the pollutions and the pathogens and the
[695.64 - 700.20] toxins created by
[697.32 - 703.16] pathogens and the lawn treatments and
[700.20 - 705.52] the mosquito spray and the pesticides
[703.16 - 707.88] herbicides and the fungicides and all
[705.52 - 709.80] the junk that's sprayed on our food and
[707.88 - 711.36] everything puffing through the air from
[709.80 - 714.08] everything from gasoline at the gas
[711.36 - 715.72] station you inhaling from the fumes to
[714.08 - 718.08] exhaust fumes you breathe in and Diesel
[715.72 - 720.84] fumes you breathe in when you're out on
[718.08 - 724.12] the street whatever ever it is we are
[720.84 - 726.40] actually getting challenged to oxidize
[724.12 - 729.28] and age quicker both in every single
[726.40 - 731.80] aspect of our organs including our skin
[729.28 - 734.36] and everything else in our body and then
[731.80 - 736.20] we get degenerative we actually age
[734.36 - 739.52] faster in so many different
[736.20 - 741.36] ways now the whole thing about this is
[739.52 - 745.04] really important to understand is
[741.36 - 747.28] everybody everybody is trying to eat
[745.04 - 750.08] better the best they
[747.28 - 751.96] can everybody's trying to do something
[750.08 - 754.64] for themselves now you'll see it it
[751.96 - 756.52] maybe not everybody okay but almost
[754.64 - 759.12] everybody is trying to actually choose
[756.52 - 760.60] something differently that they consume
[759.12 - 762.52] eat something differently that they
[760.60 - 764.16] consume take something differently that
[762.52 - 767.16] they can consume put something on their
[764.16 - 768.84] skin put something on their body right
[767.16 - 770.60] because everybody cares about what's
[768.84 - 772.24] going inside their body now it's not
[770.60 - 774.08] like years and years and years ago where
[772.24 - 775.88] people really weren't caring about that
[774.08 - 777.56] and they just did whatever and they
[775.88 - 779.12] still do that now even people who take
[777.56 - 781.28] care of themselves are still poison
[779.12 - 783.88] themselves still drinking alcohol
[781.28 - 786.12] they're still doing that and other
[783.88 - 788.04] things too but regardless they're trying
[786.12 - 790.68] to counter it right you'll see somebody
[788.04 - 792.72] guzzling down caffeine drinking a bunch
[790.68 - 795.60] of alcohol in the holidays eating a
[792.72 - 797.44] bunch of rich chocolate and then in the
[795.60 - 799.12] end they have this green juice in their
[797.44 - 801.44] hand or they go to the health food store
[799.12 - 803.56] and they grab a green juice from the
[801.44 - 805.96] health food store a bottled one or
[803.56 - 807.80] something and they're after their yoga
[805.96 - 809.28] practice or their yoga class or whatever
[807.80 - 812.32] they're actually drinking
[809.28 - 813.80] their grain juice but at the same time
[812.32 - 815.60] they're doing a lot of other things that
[813.80 - 817.52] are actually harming them but they still
[815.60 - 820.16] do at the same time care about what
[817.52 - 822.36] their body is telling them caring about
[820.16 - 823.52] what they're putting inside their body
[822.36 - 825.88] and so what I like about the wild
[823.52 - 829.04] blueberry is it takes it to a whole
[825.88 - 831.00] another level a whole another level of
[829.04 - 833.20] taking care of yourself and that's what
[831.00 - 835.36] I love about it I remember being a child
[833.20 - 837.24] in laying in the wild blueberry Fields
[835.36 - 838.88] the fields filled with wild blueberries
[837.24 - 843.16] and I would just lay in I would I would
[838.88 - 846.20] turn purple and blue because my body
[843.16 - 848.48] would be laying on top of the crop just
[846.20 - 850.16] laying on top of those wild blueberries
[848.48 - 851.80] and I used to go into the wild blueberry
[850.16 - 853.44] Fields when I was younger and I used to
[851.80 - 856.16] sit there on my knees hands and knees
[853.44 - 859.08] and I would crawl through the field and
[856.16 - 862.24] I would eat and eat and eat and eat till
[859.08 - 866.24] I couldn't eat another one and then I
[862.24 - 868.84] would fall just flip over on my back and
[866.24 - 872.04] just lay there stuffed with wild blue BL
[868.84 - 873.72] berries and as I was doing it I was
[872.04 - 875.88] doing a lot of different things with
[873.72 - 879.68] that like for instance there would be
[875.88 - 881.64] like wild roses growing in and out of
[879.68 - 884.80] the wild blueberries so Spirit of
[881.64 - 886.92] compassion would say eat the wild rose
[884.80 - 888.76] petals while you're eating the wild
[886.92 - 892.20] blueberry so I'd make a mixture and I'd
[888.76 - 893.76] Crawl Through the field making mixtures
[892.20 - 895.56] I would take the wild blueberry and then
[893.76 - 898.16] I would take some rose petals with it
[895.56 - 901.16] put it there mix it up and I would eat
[898.16 - 903.16] that like that right and I would do this
[901.16 - 905.68] kind of thing and the whole time you
[903.16 - 908.32] know my face is turning blue my body's
[905.68 - 909.56] turning blue I'm squishing on them I'm
[908.32 - 912.32] rolling in
[909.56 - 915.00] them and it's really an
[912.32 - 917.64] incredible spiritual
[915.00 - 919.32] moment and I wish everybody could have
[917.64 - 922.16] that opportunity but I know that that's
[919.32 - 924.72] not easy it's not an easy opportunity to
[922.16 - 927.32] have but I remember when I was younger
[924.72 - 930.12] that I thought if this stuff could be
[927.32 - 933.52] bottled up and to make it clear I don't
[930.12 - 935.44] own Wyman's I don't have a percentage of
[933.52 - 937.44] the Wyman's blueberry company and I want
[935.44 - 938.92] to make this clear this is critical
[937.44 - 940.84] because I heard somebody out there might
[938.92 - 943.40] say like oh he's just trying to sell his
[940.84 - 946.00] blueberry juice and I need this to be
[943.40 - 948.92] absolutely clear with everyone I don't
[946.00 - 952.04] have a share in the Wyman's
[948.92 - 955.48] company I don't have a percentage of the
[952.04 - 956.56] Wyman's company I'm not an owner I'm not
[955.48 - 959.96] a
[956.56 - 963.28] partner and that needs to be understood
[959.96 - 965.32] I endorse Wyman's because it's the best
[963.28 - 970.04] stuff there is and these guys do things
[965.32 - 974.04] people don't do and this juice is insane
[970.04 - 975.84] it's just insane and so I want people to
[974.04 - 978.00] know that right CU it looks pretty
[975.84 - 980.24] intense I got I you know I actually
[978.00 - 982.12] purchased a bunch of cases I have all
[980.24 - 983.84] this stuff right here in the counter I'm
[982.12 - 984.92] going to make a bunch of drinks for you
[983.84 - 987.80] guys I think I'm going to make four
[984.92 - 990.24] different killer beverages out of this I
[987.80 - 992.72] hope hopefully I do it right I do it
[990.24 - 994.56] right but I want you to know that you
[992.72 - 996.80] know I'm not an owner of the Wyman's
[994.56 - 999.00] wild blueberry juice company or wild
[996.80 - 1002.72] blueberry company but I support these
[999.00 - 1005.88] guys I do I stand behind them and their
[1002.72 - 1007.52] product I endorse them and rightfully so
[1005.88 - 1010.68] because of what they do they got a heart
[1007.52 - 1012.88] of gold and their stuff is amazing if
[1010.68 - 1014.28] you can't watch this live on IG cuz I
[1012.88 - 1015.84] see that everybody's getting kicked off
[1014.28 - 1017.44] of IG and I see that right there go to
[1015.84 - 1018.72] medical.com and you probably won't be
[1017.44 - 1021.28] able to see me say that cuz cuz you've
[1018.72 - 1022.04] already been kicked off or go to YouTube
[1021.28 - 1024.80] or
[1022.04 - 1026.28] Rumble IG is just keeping it like
[1024.80 - 1027.88] kicking everybody off and just keeping
[1026.28 - 1031.16] it down to like whatever they're doing
[1027.88 - 1032.80] today all right so let's go into some
[1031.16 - 1034.72] wild blueberries a little deeper and
[1032.80 - 1036.92] stuff talk about something that's really
[1034.72 - 1040.16] incredible all
[1036.92 - 1042.40] right so you can burn down a wild
[1040.16 - 1044.68] Blueberry
[1042.40 - 1045.68] field and anything in that wild
[1044.68 - 1049.24] Blueberry
[1045.68 - 1052.40] Field anything won't come
[1049.24 - 1054.28] back so as spring comes what will come
[1052.40 - 1056.80] back instead are the wild
[1054.28 - 1059.68] blueberries that's the kind of power
[1056.80 - 1062.08] they have the adaptogenic power we're
[1059.68 - 1065.16] talking about a survival mechanism that
[1062.08 - 1068.40] if the Earth was
[1065.16 - 1072.20] blazed if the Earth was blazed the wild
[1068.40 - 1077.00] blueberry would come up and what really
[1072.20 - 1079.28] crazy really crazy that if some
[1077.00 - 1083.08] massive catastroph
[1079.28 - 1086.20] catastrophic event happened where some
[1083.08 - 1092.12] solar pulse solar
[1086.20 - 1095.48] flare a huge ball of fire just balls out
[1092.12 - 1099.48] of the Sun and barrels down towards
[1095.48 - 1101.64] us whatever happens or if the planet
[1099.48 - 1104.04] gets scorched for some
[1101.64 - 1107.32] reason the wild blueberry will come back
[1104.04 - 1111.00] up everything else will be
[1107.32 - 1114.60] gone all the oak trees will be gone all
[1111.00 - 1118.12] the acorns that grow oak trees would be
[1114.60 - 1122.12] gone it's important to know all the
[1118.12 - 1124.20] birch trees all the cherry trees all the
[1122.12 - 1127.72] cedar all the
[1124.20 - 1130.76] pine everything would be
[1127.72 - 1133.76] gone just
[1130.76 - 1136.24] annihilated and gone and what would
[1133.76 - 1140.00] happen would be the wild blueberry would
[1136.24 - 1142.44] just start coming up out of the earth
[1140.00 - 1145.44] and would just start to grow and come up
[1142.44 - 1148.04] out of the earth an oak tree won't
[1145.44 - 1150.28] that's gone for good if the planet gets
[1148.04 - 1154.16] scorched for some
[1150.28 - 1158.96] reason if there's a nuclear war and the
[1154.16 - 1161.36] planet just gets burned to the
[1158.96 - 1165.44] ground the wild blueberry will be the
[1161.36 - 1167.56] first to Peak its head it'll be the
[1165.44 - 1169.80] first to come up you have to realize
[1167.56 - 1172.64] what that is
[1169.80 - 1175.32] and so what I like to think about is
[1172.64 - 1177.60] that power it has and then I like to
[1175.32 - 1181.64] think about that power in me like I want
[1177.60 - 1185.08] that in me that's what I want I want
[1181.64 - 1188.12] something that if it gets nuked it comes
[1185.08 - 1191.36] up out of the ground I want something
[1188.12 - 1195.92] that if it literally gets burned because
[1191.36 - 1199.72] of some crazy event the moon crumbles
[1195.92 - 1201.20] and starts to fall apart some Earth gets
[1199.72 - 1203.56] thrown off its
[1201.20 - 1207.88] axis something
[1203.56 - 1211.40] happens or some alien race decides to
[1207.88 - 1214.76] blow up the moon which by all means they
[1211.40 - 1217.08] have power to do that and anything or
[1214.76 - 1219.60] anything and the Earth was destroyed
[1217.08 - 1221.92] over it the wild blueberry would still
[1219.60 - 1223.96] come up out of the
[1221.92 - 1225.80] ground that's what I'm talking about
[1223.96 - 1227.92] it's that kind of power so I think about
[1225.80 - 1230.00] that as I'm drinking and consuming the
[1227.92 - 1232.72] wild blue bries so when I was a kid I
[1230.00 - 1235.56] always thought about would it be amazing
[1232.72 - 1238.44] if for some way somehow that can be
[1235.56 - 1241.32] bottled those wild blueberries that are
[1238.44 - 1245.52] once a year on that field in those
[1241.32 - 1248.56] fields can get squeezed down and pressed
[1245.52 - 1251.48] you know like pressed like oldtime apple
[1248.56 - 1256.16] press style like
[1251.48 - 1259.68] pressed and get pressed down into a
[1256.16 - 1261.92] juice and gets put in here here like
[1259.68 - 1264.96] that would be the biggest dream come
[1261.92 - 1268.68] true for the health of people like to me
[1264.96 - 1271.60] that would be the alltime greatest
[1268.68 - 1273.28] dream to have that resource and have
[1271.60 - 1275.40] that so I want to make a bunch of stuff
[1273.28 - 1277.12] I to make a bunch of drinks I can talk
[1275.40 - 1278.64] about the wild blueberry forever and I'm
[1277.12 - 1281.36] going to continue as we're making drinks
[1278.64 - 1284.04] and doing things but I can talk about
[1281.36 - 1285.40] the wild blueberry forever now you know
[1284.04 - 1287.12] I talk about it in my books the whole
[1285.40 - 1288.72] bit now remember I just want to say

[1573.48 - 1578.08] right mixing this up you guys these are
[1576.32 - 1579.40] the dry ingredients and the reason why
[1578.08 - 1581.64] you want to mix that up I'm just going
[1579.40 - 1583.28] to be straight out about this cuz if you
[1581.64 - 1585.84] put the wet in with this and it's not
[1583.28 - 1588.20] mixed it's going to be a heck of a hard
[1585.84 - 1590.32] time getting this stuff mixed up been
[1588.20 - 1592.52] down that road before I've made these
[1590.32 - 1593.84] before do you guys have the ingredients
[1592.52 - 1596.16] on hand you guys want to make them with
[1593.84 - 1600.08] me this would be cool let's hit the wet
[1596.16 - 1603.52] stuff now let's get some maple syrup
[1600.08 - 1605.64] going on in here so this thing calls for
[1603.52 - 1609.84] um here we
[1605.64 - 1611.28] go this recipe calls for 1/4 cup of
[1609.84 - 1612.56] maple syrup I'm going to do a/2 cup of
[1611.28 - 1616.12] maple
[1612.56 - 1619.60] syrup let's do a/2 cup maple syrup there
[1616.12 - 1623.68] we go where are we here
[1619.60 - 1625.56] making a mess already
[1623.68 - 1626.80] unbelievable do you guys ever get
[1625.56 - 1628.96] irritate
[1626.80 - 1630.72] it like you know what I mean when you're
[1628.96 - 1633.16] like you make a
[1630.72 - 1635.52] mess just
[1633.16 - 1636.48] like I tell myself I'm not going to do
[1635.52 - 1638.92] that this time I'm going to do some
[1636.48 - 1640.32] applesauce now third of a cup of
[1638.92 - 1642.04] applesauce but I'm going to do a full
[1640.32 - 1644.00] cup of applesauce I'm going to put a
[1642.04 - 1646.52] little bit more in
[1644.00 - 1648.84] here all
[1646.52 - 1652.24] right
[1648.84 - 1654.40] H yeah let's do this I got some
[1652.24 - 1656.08] applesauce can you see that you guys I'm
[1654.40 - 1659.56] going to do a third I'm going get this
[1656.08 - 1661.80] 2/3 cuz it's double batch I'll do 2/3
[1659.56 - 1665.96] and then I'm going to put a little bit
[1661.80 - 1668.00] more yeah that's nice that's nice
[1665.96 - 1671.08] good
[1668.00 - 1674.12] okay all right and then we're going to
[1671.08 - 1678.84] put some orange zest in there
[1674.12 - 1681.60] zest is that what it is orange
[1678.84 - 1683.24] justest okay now I'm going to mix the
[1681.60 - 1686.28] wet ingredient in but I don't have to
[1683.24 - 1688.84] worry now cuz you can mix it up but you
[1686.28 - 1691.88] don't have to freak out because the dry
[1688.84 - 1693.24] ingredients were mixed up right I can't
[1691.88 - 1695.32] wait to talk about the wild blueberry a
[1693.24 - 1697.48] little bit more about the power it has
[1695.32 - 1699.32] why it's so important to healing and
[1697.48 - 1703.24] guess what that's right the wild
[1699.32 - 1706.44] blueberry is in the hmds for a
[1703.24 - 1708.24] reason do you know that it's a powerful
[1706.44 - 1710.32] powerful binder
[1708.24 - 1713.08] for the people that go he never talks
[1710.32 - 1715.24] about binders he never talks about yeah
[1713.08 - 1718.88] because the wild
[1715.24 - 1720.80] blueberry is the most powerful of the
[1718.88 - 1722.12] binders right all right so I'm mixing
[1720.80 - 1724.24] this up now I want to get a little bit
[1722.12 - 1726.68] of the
[1724.24 - 1728.24] orange zest in there so what I do is I
[1726.68 - 1730.92] take an orange I hope you guys are okay
[1728.24 - 1733.44] with this can I throw it around a little
[1730.92 - 1736.64] bit and what I do is I just peel it back
[1733.44 - 1739.32] with a knife if you're okay right now
[1736.64 - 1743.08] get a zest
[1739.32 - 1746.08] greater what is it a zest tool this is
[1743.08 - 1749.24] the way I do it now if you have somebody
[1746.08 - 1750.96] that doesn't really like you orange zest
[1749.24 - 1752.88] you don't have to do this if you don't
[1750.96 - 1755.24] want to I like it so I'm going to get
[1752.88 - 1758.08] some nice big pieces
[1755.24 - 1760.08] here now try to keep the don't get down
[1758.08 - 1762.52] to the pith too much take a look you
[1760.08 - 1764.96] guys don't get down to the pith you see
[1762.52 - 1766.84] this like try not see there's a little
[1764.96 - 1769.28] pith almost in that right there don't do
[1766.84 - 1772.20] that too much because the pith is a
[1769.28 - 1773.96] bitter you don't want a bitter cookie
[1772.20 - 1776.48] you just want to get the
[1773.96 - 1777.96] outside so see that right there that's
[1776.48 - 1780.60] actually a good one right there check it
[1777.96 - 1782.64] out okay that was good all right that's
[1780.60 - 1784.32] good that's good because you don't want
[1782.64 - 1786.76] to go too deep so I want to show you
[1784.32 - 1786.76] this right
[1788.28 - 1793.56] here every time someone's like I do a
[1791.64 - 1794.96] smoothie I do a smoothie I put um
[1793.56 - 1796.16] blueberries in my smoothie I'm like
[1794.96 - 1798.20] blueberries what kind of blueberries do
[1796.16 - 1800.32] you put in there I just blueberries you
[1798.20 - 1802.28] know I just bought them and it's
[1800.32 - 1804.68] cultivated blueberries and it's like
[1802.28 - 1806.48] okay well that's not going to help you
[1804.68 - 1808.24] know what happens a lot of people don't
[1806.48 - 1810.88] realize it and they do their
[1808.24 - 1815.08] hmds with the cultivated
[1810.88 - 1817.64] blueberry big big big big big problem if
[1815.08 - 1819.28] that's the case if that's all you have
[1817.64 - 1821.84] then what I recommend I'm going to cut
[1819.28 - 1823.36] that up right now what I recommend is
[1821.84 - 1826.44] when you do your
[1823.36 - 1828.60] hmds you use a Blackberry you use a
[1826.44 - 1832.32] cultivated black Blackberry a cultivated
[1828.60 - 1834.96] Blackberry is getting much closer to
[1832.32 - 1836.96] what say a wild blueberry could do it's
[1834.96 - 1840.12] not the same thing it doesn't do the
[1836.96 - 1842.16] same thing but the but the Blackberry if
[1840.12 - 1843.64] but is better than the cultivated
[1842.16 - 1845.92] blueberry I'm just going to tell you
[1843.64 - 1848.44] right now this is important to know so
[1845.92 - 1851.96] many people do their hmds and it's got
[1848.44 - 1853.76] the cultivated blueberry and I feel bad
[1851.96 - 1858.36] because it's not it it means that you're
[1853.76 - 1860.60] not getting that maximum maximum
[1858.36 - 1863.08] you know you're just not I want to just
[1860.60 - 1866.20] I want to cut this down a little bit
[1863.08 - 1868.96] more this is an important tip by the way
[1866.20 - 1870.64] for hmds I want everybody to know by the
[1868.96 - 1873.28] way the juice is coming to Europe soon

[3227.40 - 3232.28] emotional support for an evening with
[3229.44 - 3234.28] family because it's providing brain help
[3232.28 - 3235.96] for your neurons think about that for a
[3234.28 - 3238.84] minute right there so the wild blueberry
[3235.96 - 3241.16] juice is going into the brain it's
[3238.84 - 3243.28] mainlining into the brain and it's
[3241.16 - 3246.04] providing all this kind of anthocyan INF
[3243.28 - 3248.04] filled glucose phytochemical compounds
[3246.04 - 3250.24] for your neurons specifically when you
[3248.04 - 3252.56] hear people say why do you eat so
[3250.24 - 3255.20] healthy why are you actually eating so
[3252.56 - 3257.04] healthy like forget it it's Thanksgiving

[3257.04 - 3260.92] everybody's eating eat all the butter
[3258.64 - 3263.08] and eat everything else why are you
[3260.92 - 3265.16] sticking to your medical medium protocol

[3271.36 - 3276.84] pressure all that stress the wild
[3274.00 - 3278.60] blueberry juice kind of throws that all
[3276.84 - 3281.12] aside because people in the family they
[3278.60 - 3282.56] see that wild blueberry juice like this
[3281.12 - 3284.92] they'll see it like this and they'll be
[3282.56 - 3286.92] like what is that why is that are you
[3284.92 - 3288.76] drinking are you actually loosening up
[3286.92 - 3290.28] and you're drinking families actually
[3288.76 - 3292.12] feel like you're loosening up and you're
[3290.28 - 3295.76] actually like partying with them they
[3292.12 - 3298.76] won't be so like antagonistic to your
[3295.76 - 3300.56] lifestyle of healing and your lifestyle
[3298.76 - 3302.48] of eating the way you're eating and your
[3300.56 - 3304.52] celery juice drinking that they probably
[3302.48 - 3306.72] can't stand anymore or whatever it is
[3304.52 - 3308.00] that's happening with you know different
[3306.72 - 3309.80] people in your family and different
[3308.00 - 3312.40] people around your
[3309.80 - 3314.16] nucleus in your world and then what
[3312.40 - 3315.68] happens is you bring this out you break
[3314.16 - 3318.28] this out and something changes
[3315.68 - 3322.08] emotionally something actually just
[3318.28 - 3325.80] Alters their way of how they feel in the
[3322.08 - 3328.00] Moment by looking at this stuff I know

[4119.04 - 4125.92] apples what Incarnation was I doing what
[4122.56 - 4128.44] in creation am I
[4125.92 - 4130.96] doing I'm cutting these apples I'm
[4128.44 - 4130.96] making the
[4131.96 - 4137.56] sria okay let's get another app
[4134.88 - 4139.76] going see this right here I'm taking the
[4137.56 - 4142.48] pits out right the pits kind of usually
[4139.76 - 4144.92] fall out of
[4142.48 - 4147.68] here okay nice
[4144.92 - 4149.84] nice nice get the pits Little P I mean
[4147.68 - 4149.84] the
[4151.60 - 4158.00] seeds I stand correct
[4155.04 - 4160.12] it it's the one thing no one realizes I
[4158.00 - 4162.56] go through it's why the books don't
[4160.12 - 4164.44] contradict it's why eight gigantic
[4162.56 - 4165.96] medical Bibles can be put out and
[4164.44 - 4168.32] they're not
[4165.96 - 4171.60] contradictive that's why lives and
[4168.32 - 4173.88] lectures and and podcasts aren't
[4171.60 - 4175.56] contradictive like dicted like everybody
[4173.88 - 4178.36] else in the health scene it's because I
[4175.56 - 4181.20] get stand corrected by a voice I hear
[4178.36 - 4185.48] and it's the biggest pain in the butt
[4181.20 - 4189.92] ever if I call this a pit in here I get
[4185.48 - 4189.92] corrected by the voice that says it's a
[4190.04 - 4195.00] seed and that's why the books no one can
[4192.92 - 4196.44] touch the books
[4195.00 - 4197.88] there's no authors out there in the
[4196.44 - 4200.08] health realm that can actually do
[4197.88 - 4203.00] medical books like this with information
[4200.08 - 4204.36] that's detailed and not have some kind
[4203.00 - 4206.64] of problem they don't do it they just
[4204.36 - 4208.20] write eat better books and they
[4206.64 - 4210.60] contradict themselves in every sentence
[4208.20 - 4212.36] or every book if your screen is Frozen
[4210.60 - 4215.80] on Instagram please take screen
[4212.36 - 4218.28] recording of it if you got no sound same

[4265.44 - 4269.68] slices and I'm going to mix them up a
[4267.28 - 4269.68] little bit

[4282.44 - 4287.04] strawberries now
[4284.36 - 4287.04] you guys don't
[4287.56 - 4292.20] mind strawberries so here's what I'm
[4290.60 - 4294.28] doing with the strawberries I'm going to
[4292.20 - 4296.20] move this over I'm going to cut these
[4294.28 - 4297.64] tops off someone yelled at me that one
[4296.20 - 4301.12] time what if you remember a long time
[4297.64 - 4303.72] ago you can eat the strawberry leaves
[4301.12 - 4307.04] you think you're so smart with that one
[4303.72 - 4308.72] do you you can eat the strawberry leaves
[4307.04 - 4310.52] aw you don't know anything about plant
[4308.72 - 4312.68] Foods you're not really a plant food
[4310.52 - 4314.44] person you're not really a plant-based
[4312.68 - 4317.16] person because you didn't know the
[4314.44 - 4318.88] advanced raw plant-based knowledge of
[4317.16 - 4321.36] you can just eat the strawberry leaf
[4318.88 - 4324.80] with the strawberry it's so Advanced you
[4321.36 - 4327.96] guys think you're so
[4324.80 - 4330.36] smart think you're so smart but what you
[4327.96 - 4331.20] don't know is something Spirit taught me
[4330.36 - 4334.40] once
[4331.20 - 4336.72] again okay is you can eat the strawberry
[4334.40 - 4339.76] Leaf that's on top of the strawberry
[4336.72 - 4342.68] when it's out of your freaking
[4339.76 - 4345.52] Garden but you can't eat the strawberry
[4342.68 - 4348.80] Leaf when it's in the package that was
[4345.52 - 4351.56] in the store because
[4348.80 - 4354.52] bacteria gets trapped in between the
[4351.56 - 4355.32] strawberry Leaf even if you wash it and
[4354.52 - 4357.28] the
[4355.32 - 4358.96] strawberry and so you go there you're
[4357.28 - 4361.44] eating your strawberries you know from
[4358.96 - 4363.80] the store and all the bacteria is packed
[4361.44 - 4367.28] in between the leaf and the top of the
[4363.80 - 4369.96] strawberry everything from anything from
[4367.28 - 4371.96] traveling along with other like meats
[4369.96 - 4374.16] and chicken and God knows what and the
[4371.96 - 4377.04] big trucks and the big Carri
[4374.16 - 4379.20] in the 18 wheelers drippage everywhere
[4377.04 - 4381.28] and that salmonella can go right between
[4379.20 - 4383.60] the leaf of the strawberry and the
[4381.28 - 4385.24] strawberry so what I do is these aren't
[4383.60 - 4387.68] grown out of my garden I'm not going to
[4385.24 - 4389.96] eat the little strawberry top Leaf I'm
[4387.68 - 4392.60] going to cut the darn thing off even
[4389.96 - 4395.12] though I've washed

[4570.68 - 4576.96] Fist and a
[4573.32 - 4578.56] heart then if I don't have the answers

[4578.56 - 4582.40] that
[4579.32 - 4583.80] realize the blood draw crisis they're
[4582.40 - 4585.08] drawing all this blood out of people who
[4583.80 - 4588.84] are chronically ill and literally
[4585.08 - 4591.76] killing them they're not monitoring it
[4588.84 - 4593.44] 20 vials 10 vials 13 vials 7 vials

[4630.24 - 4634.76] keeping track we're keeping track and
