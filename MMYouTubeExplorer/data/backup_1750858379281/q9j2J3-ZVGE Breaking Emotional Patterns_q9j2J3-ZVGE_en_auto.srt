1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,600
we're live right now and we're on day

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,960
four of the medical medium collecting

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,340
Stones meditation journey and I am full

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,380
of joy

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,599
and I'm

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,420
giggling with excitement and happiness

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,119
because

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,460
the amount of people right now that are

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,760
having a life-changing experience is

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,760
just unimaginable

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,920
nearly a hundred thousand people right

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,920
now

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,739
are in the collecting Stone's meditation

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,300
Journey

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,219
and

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,860
I'm having an incredible experience with

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,540
my Stones I see everybody bringing

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,280
stones to their garden they're they're

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,559
putting their stones

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,539
near their plants near their garden beds

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,940
they're eating with their Stones they're

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,300
sleeping with their Stones they have

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,460
their stones with them on bicycles they

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,260
have their stones with them in the car

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,340
they have their stones with them and

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,220
their pockets this is just an absolute

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,439
dream come true for so many people

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,119
healing for me it's a dream come true

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,760
that so many people are going to be

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,260
doing so much deep healing and that

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,479
right there is what it's all about

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,640
that's what it's about

33
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,820
it's about

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,259
moving the needle forward in emotional

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,360
spiritual mental healing an incredible

36
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,000
process is taking place right now I'm so

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,320
proud of you guys seriously I am so so

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
proud of you

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,040
I can't say enough about it now I have

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,220
to give you

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,299
just a little

42
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,299
couple little words

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,280
it's not going to be easy letting go of

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
your stones

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,860
it's gonna be so hard and maybe not for

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,920
everyone but for

47
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,460
probably most everyone it's gonna be

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,540
incredibly hard to release and let go of

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,280
those stones and I'm going to talk about

50
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,899
why in a minute too so I'm going to go

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,939
into why

52
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,920
this collecting Stone's meditation

53
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:10,079
Journey

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,079
was released in 2015

55
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,860
in medical medium right here by the way

56
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,840
so collecting Stones meditation journey

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,680
is in medical medium this is the revised

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,140
and Expanded Edition right here

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,520
so I want everybody to know

60
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,520
where it originates from

61
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,660
I want to prepare us because releasing

62
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,420
the stones is going to be an experience

63
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,640
all on its own

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,120
these stones

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,180
have become my friends

66
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,340
truly like I am connected to the stones

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,000
you see right here

68
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,220
deeply connected to these stones

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,019
and I know that so many of you guys are

70
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,019
deeply connected to your Stones as well

of this video that's the help desk

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,120
hopefully you guys got that

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,260
it's a lot of words

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,940
all right

96
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,720
why is it going to be so difficult to

97
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,720
release our stones

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,400
we often get stuck in patterns

99
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:16,500
patterns that last a lifetime

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:19,199
emotional spiritual mental patterns

101
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,239
that seem like an impossibility to break

102
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,800
for so many

103
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,199
I think a lot of people who are

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,060
soul-searching

105
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,460
one of the reasons why they're

106
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,540
soul-searching is they're stuck in a

107
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,240
vicious cycle

108
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,860
they're stuck in a catch-20 too

109
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,860
they're stuck in a vicious cycle

110
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,680
so many people

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,080
are log jammed in that vicious cycle and

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,160
they can't swim out of it they can't get

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,259
out of it

114
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,540
and they go to therapists and they go to

115
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,180
psychiatrists and they go to healers and

116
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,560
they go to doctors and they go to

117
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,320
friends

118
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,500
and they look for words of wisdom they

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,840
look for advice to try to break the

120
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,620
patterns that are occurring these

121
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,020
patterns stem from PTSD they can stem

122
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,300
from experiences that started a long

123
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,460
time ago they can stem

124
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,520
from just about anything as we're going

125
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,919
through life on this journey

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,440
and then once a pattern has been created

127
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,600
and we're stuck in that pattern and

128
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,560
we're stuck in it it becomes a part of

129
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,139
us

130
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,199
doesn't Define us though

131
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:35,300
it can never Define us

132
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,300
even if it becomes a part of us

133
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,460
so I want to say

134
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,500
I want to say as these patterns become a

135
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,580
part of us it doesn't mean it's Who We

136
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,060
Are

137
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,979
it doesn't mean that's all we are

138
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,440
it's critical to understand very

139
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:00,780
important piece of it all

140
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,880
just because we go through life

141
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,100
and we have these patterns that we get

142
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,320
stuck in that we try everything to break

143
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,780
or we may not even know we have these

144
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,680
patterns we may not even know we have

145
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,180
any of these patterns at all

146
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,400
but we're stuck in him and someone else

147
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,220
may recognize them and be like what's

148
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,740
going on a loved one or a friend or a

149
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,840
relationship or a partner or anybody

150
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,639
they might be like what's going on what

151
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,259
are you going through what's happening

152
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,400
here and you're trying to describe it

153
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,900
and you're trying to figure it out and

154
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,240
you don't know why you got angry and you

155
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,319
don't know why really you're sad and you

156
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,460
don't know why you're struggling

157
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,680
emotionally mentally but you are

158
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,479
and so many people are in a pattern

159
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,919
without even knowing they're in a

160
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,539
pattern that they're stuck in because

161
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,880
something happened to him or is

162
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,460
happening to them in their life in that

163
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,960
moment that they are wrapped up into a

164
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,060
vicious cycle

165
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,120
a circle of confusion and they can't

166
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,180
break it and every time a trigger comes

167
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,580
along and triggers them and hits them

168
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,199
it's like boom they're back into it boom

169
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,419
they're back into that pattern and how

170
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,880
do we get out of it

171
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,940
Barbara from YouTube says thank you and

172
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,500
SOC I love this meditation

173
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,120
this

174
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,800
is going to be one of the most powerful

175
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
meditations you have ever done in your

176
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,780
life and you're never going to forget

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,780
this experience by the seventh day

178
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,419
you're never ever going to forget

179
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,220
he has been said on YouTube I love you

180
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,860
and spirit of compassion I take my

181
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:37,160
Stones everywhere and my pockets so do I

182
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,160
so do I I am so excited God bless you

183
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,680
so I want to go back to the patterns

184
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,680
that we get stuck in

185
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:52,080
it's a very real thing hard to break

186
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,020
and then we get tagged by others

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,819
as that's how we really are oh that

188
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,039
person's just really difficult that

189
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,840
person I think has OCD and Tourette's

190
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,419
that person seems like a really

191
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,400
difficult person that person just is so

192
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,139
sensitive and Hyper sensitive they can't

193
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,599
even like you can't even talk to them

194
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,440
that person gets triggered so easy I

195
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,440
can't talk to them

196
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,319
and then you get tagged and

197
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,319
misunderstood

198
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,319
misunderstood

199
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,879
for something

200
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:26,039
that you're going through that people

201
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,900
can't understand and you may not even be

202
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,520
able to understand yourself because it's

203
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,860
that difficult

204
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,680
but when we have emotional experiences

205
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:38,539
through life and we get into hardships

206
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,339
of any kind even if they seem small or

207
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,800
really small but they're actually big

208
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,420
and so many things affect us in so many

209
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,279
different ways and every single person

210
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,920
is different so every time something

211
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,540
happens in someone's life it's different

212
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,540
there's a different scale

213
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,040
people will go to like

214
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,420
therapists psychiatrists

215
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,380
they'll go through all kinds of

216
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,880
different courses and programs to try to

217
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,279
better themselves emotionally

218
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,140
spiritually

219
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,640
but the Stone's meditation the

220
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,080
collecting Stones meditation is unlike

221
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,140
anything you're ever going to experience

222
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,540
because this is going to absorb

223
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,880
something take something away that

224
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,620
shouldn't be there and that's the

225
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,540
difference with this entire experience

226
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,120
we're going through right now for anyone

227
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,399
who missed a day or wasn't able to watch

228
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,459
one of the videos at the end of the

229
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,320
seven days there will be a replay for 48

230
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,200
hours just so you know this is a big

231
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,660
deal that you can access

232
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,060
the videos you can still so still sign

233
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,660
ups to still sign up now and join us or

234
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,660

so you can access the videos

236
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,920
Anna Brothers on YouTube says I'm loving

237
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,540
this meditation I didn't realize how

238
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,160
attached I would get to my stones and

239
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:04,040
it's only day four

240
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,040
only day four Anna only day four

241
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,660
when we get to day five which is

242
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,339
tomorrow and we get to day six which is

243
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,800
the day after tomorrow it's going to be

244
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:20,300
even a way different story and it's

245
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:23,100
going to be something very very

246
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,980
life-changing that's developing right

247
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,019
now as we speak

248
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,060
as you're sitting there right now with

249
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,440
your Stones your Stone's got to know you

250
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,120
they're getting to know you you're

251
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,839
getting to know them and they are

252
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,839
absorbing information

253
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,700
because stones are minerals

254
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,060
minerals that can draw

255
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,560
and when they draw they absorb

256
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,079
by the way

257
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,000
sign up link is in the profile or

are here

262
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,060
so you can sign up

263
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,760
by the way I want to make an

264
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,399
announcement my YouTube channel

265
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,660
has advertisements running

266
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,760
not by my liking YouTube has done that

267
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,100
without my say

268
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,959
and so there are commercials on my

269
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,420
YouTube channel now

270
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,760
just letting everybody know I am not

271
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,920
being paid for it nor have I collected a

272
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,079
penny from YouTube

273
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,200
I've been avoiding those YouTube

274
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,940
advertisements for over 10 years

275
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,160
I think something like that I don't know

276
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,140
eight years whatever it's been and they

277
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,300
have now placed those advertisements in

278
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,820
front of my videos on YouTube

279
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,519
which is really annoying

280
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,200
and then some

281
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,700
and by the way I've been censored on

282
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,920
YouTube now for three and a half years

283
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,120
almost totally censored so it's really

284
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,180
annoying that they then throw

285
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,600
advertisements in front of my centered

286
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,600
YouTube channel

287
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,399
Disney over there on IG says I'm so

288
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,440
attached to my stones

289
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,620
incredible

290
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,880
yep May wow they did it without my

291
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,880
approval indeed they did

292
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
so Beauty cargo says where can you sign

293
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,060

294
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,399

so we are moving into

297
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,360
the fifth day tomorrow we're on our

298
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,720
fourth day now I want to forewarn

299
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,300
everybody about something

300
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,860
Ambrose live said on IG Anthony I can

301
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,320
tell this is absolutely the most

302
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,959
powerful meditation I've ever done

303
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,420
and that's on the fourth day

304
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,579
I can't express it enough I'm trying my

305
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,100
best to contain myself I don't know if

306
00:12:53,579 --> 00:13:01,279
you guys can tell or not but I'm trying

307
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:04,440
my best to contain myself because

308
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,200
this is gonna be unlike anything you've

309
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,300
ever experienced

310
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,000
someone can just take my word for that

311
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,220
take this clip and put it somewhere put

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,320

313
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,120
of this video and post it and be like

314
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,920
we'll see about that

315
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,920
yeah we'll see about that

316
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,160
sparkling nourishment on IG says I lost

317
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,800
all my three stones yesterday whoa can I

318
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,519
pick three new ones thank you for all

319
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,459
you do yes you can pick three new ones

320
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,440
but OMG you lost all three of your

321
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,160
Stones during this collecting Stone's

322
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,160
meditation Journey

323
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,839
what kind of meaning is in there

324
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,839
I'm positive there's tremendous meaning

325
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:55,079
you should pick your brain your

326
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,060
intuition connect and just find out what

327
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,579
happened right there wild blueberry

328
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,800
dreams on IG said yes aw I feel like the

329
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:04,620
stones are my little babies

330
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,860
I feel the same

331
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,139
RM javaro says it's giving me Comfort

332
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:14,180
after losing my father

333
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,180
so sorry you lost your your father

334
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,779
over there in IG Dell Hodgins said I

335
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,839
have taken my stones with me in my bag

336
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,760
today took them out when I got home and

337
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,820
sang to them

338
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,440
incredible have you guys did you sing to

339
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,399
your Stones yet that's what I wanted to

340
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,680
ask you have you picked chosen a song to

341
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,600
sing to your Stones I want to go over

342
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,880
that a little bit if everybody has a

343
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,480
minute or two

344
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,480
yeah

345
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:52,680
so when you're singing to your stones

346
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,779
it's not just an exercise

347
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,760
it's not just an exercise where you're

348
00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:00,959
like okay what's the next exercise let

349
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:06,199
me sing to my Stones it's more than that

350
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,199
songs that you choose have great meaning

351
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,360
emotional meanings

352
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:15,660
if you're choosing a song

353
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,680
to sing to your Stones it could be a

354
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,320
song

355
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,959
that you nostalgically remember from the

356
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,160
past it could be a song that you

357
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,279
remember

358
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,180
that happened it was out at around the

359
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,279
time when you were going through

360
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,980
something it could be a song that makes

361
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,139
you happy because you're sad a lot so

362
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,360
you like this song it could be any song

363
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,519
but there's a reason why you choose the

364
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,100
song and there's reason why you're

365
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:45,180
singing to your stones

366
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,339
when you sing emotion

367
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,339
is released

368
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,880
and your stones are reading that emotion

369
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:57,060
they're absorbing the frequency within

370
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,660
each word as you're humming or singing

371
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,660
to your stones

372
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,459
there's information in the frequency of

373
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,220
the sound of your voice

374
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:10,560
coming from your soul

375
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,300
so as you sing you're singing from your

376
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,699
soul to your stones

377
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,579
and then a channel opens up

378
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:19,620
that channel opens up between you and

379
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:21,180
your Stones as you're singing and in

380
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,760
that channel there's emotions and

381
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,339
information hidden in there that's deep

382
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,839
within that because of the song itself

383
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,540
that you're choosing and how you're

384
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,120
singing it to your stones

385
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,160
and so information is then channeled out

386
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,519
directly into the Stone's emotional

387
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,160
information because of the song the song

388
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,920
opens up a channel within our soul

389
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,440
it frees the pathway

390
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,060
so that information can travel with

391
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,940
emotional

392
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,639
baggage on it or hardship or hurt or any

393
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,040
kind of emotion going into your stones

394
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,019
and your stones are absorbing that very

395
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,959
information

396
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:04,020
Kim Miller on YouTube Anthony if we're

397
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,199
bed bound and can't discard our stones

398
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,480
on our own can someone else do it for us

399
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,319
yes Kim someone else can discard the

400
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,699
stones

401
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,880
for you

402
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,699
it's just as powerful

403
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,160
it's just this life-changing

404
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,799
it doesn't get hindered on any level

405
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,339
so yes you can definitely have someone

406
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,900
discard toss those stones

407
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,780
for you

408
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,040
without any hiccups in the process of

409
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,799
the seven day collecting Stone's

410
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,960
meditation Journey

411
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,360
shiatsu said I lost one should I collect

412
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,679
a new one I actually don't feel like I

413
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,140
should

414
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,880
you don't have to get a new one

415
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,840
but you're welcome to get a new one if

416
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,240
you like

417
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,400
but you can go either or with that you

418
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,160
don't have to get a new one if it feels

419
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,940
good that stone may have absorbed

420
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,940
already enough that stone might have

421
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,520
absorbed a full amount and it was lost

422
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,179
for a reason

423
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,460
mukto Freedom over there on YouTube

424
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,679
thanks beloved Anthony

425
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,860
I feel protected with my Stones not

426
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,860
alone

427
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,280
the incredible

428
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,100
Nancy Newman over there on YouTube can

429
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,620

you can now I didn't put that piece of

431
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,720
information out there in a PDF

432
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,620
but it doesn't mean you can't of course

433
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,440

436
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,460
Mildred over there on YouTube My Stones

437
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,760
put me to sleep as soon as I touched

438
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,799
them it's an amazing journey and as

439
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,780
you're falling asleep when you're

440
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,299
touching your stones

441
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,919
your stones are absorbing you become

442
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,100
clear

443
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:59,640
and hurt from the soul

444
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,620
from your spirit leave your body and are

445
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,600
entering your Stones they're entering

446
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,740
your Stones while you're falling asleep

447
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,740
is that you're falling asleep

448
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,860
your stones are taking the information

449
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,860
as you're falling asleep

450
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,720
they're taking in the information

451
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,860
Dawn says over there in Facebook I can't

452
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,740
discard my stones

453
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,700
I'm too attached it's going to be hard

454
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,100
Don

455
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,840
it's going to be so hard

456
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,520
in this seven day collecting Stones

457
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,260
meditation journey and we're all going

458
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,299
to be discarding our stones on the

459
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,340
seventh day

460
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:40,320
unless for some reason you can't get to

461
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,760
a place to discard them and if you can't

462
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,440
get to a place to discard them

463
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,600
completely understand it's going to have

464
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,760
to be the next day or soon as you can or

465
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,580
when you can if you can't discard them

466
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,100
on that day it's okay but we all

467
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,640
eventually have to let it go and let our

468
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,919
Stones go and let them do their job

469
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,500
Jennifer Cockrell says over there on

470
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,840
YouTube what could it mean by being

471
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,280
annoyed by the Stones

472
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:11,580
I feel like they are just something else

473
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,620
that I have to take care of along with

474
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,360
everything else I have to do haven't

475
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:20,039
felt like this the whole time Jennifer

476
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,660
it's an incredible emotional experience

477
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,280
right there there's a reason why you're

478
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,679
feeling that way

479
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,740
and your stones are absorbing some kind

480
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,240
of old hurt around that around having to

481
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,220
take care of something

482
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,900
so something that may have happened in

483
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,880
your life

484
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,039
is making that occur something that's

485
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,539
stored up inside of you from having to

486
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,700
take care of something and your stones

487
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,080
are going to be absorbing that because

488
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,940
remember I have to tell you guys

489
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,640
something really important a critical

490
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,120
piece of information right here so

491
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,120
important

492
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,260
is that as we're breaking patterns and

493
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,299
the stones are removing negative baggage

494
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,740
it's been inside of us old hurt that

495
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,260
we've been holding on to that's been

496
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,840
stuffed inside for years and years and

497
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,240
years as it's removing that empty spaces

498
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,080
are starting to

499
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,960
open inside of us empty spaces because

500
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,120
that's leaving you that stuff is leaving

501
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,179
you and then empty spaces open up those

502
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,100
empty spaces then can take on new

503
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,320
references new experiences and new

504
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,860
information so it doesn't get bumbled

505
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,960
together and confusing so we can have

506
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,960
more freedom and peace in our heart and

507
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,940
soul chatsu says bridged on YouTube

508
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,039
Bridge Over Troubled Water is my

509
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,280
favorite song I sang that one to my

510
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,080
Stones as well I guarantee you that you

511
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,080
did a better job than me

512
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,820
hmm I can promise you that you did a

513
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,820
better job singing Bridge Over Troubled

514
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:51,919
Water than I did Michelle said I have

515
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,919
slept so deep the last few nights

516
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,980
that's incredible

517
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:05,700
this is going to be one of the most

518
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,880
powerful probably the most powerful in

519
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:12,320
your lifetime to break patterns

520
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,320
patterns we didn't even know we had

521
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,280
I'm actually really thrilled Beyond

522
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,140
thrilled

523
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,480
foreign

524
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,280
can I read a couple of comments that are

525
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,260
on telegram if you guys are okay with

526
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,299
that

527
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,600
this is Rachel Haynes

528
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:33,299
the journey is profound palpable

529
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,100
I wasn't expecting what's happening

530
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:38,280
to be happening

531
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,700
when I found the first stone heartbreak

532
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,380
I knew it was the one it feels different

533
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,960
from the others

534
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,179
shaped like a heart with a white line

535
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,580
going through the center

536
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,980
I found that it has ended up in a

537
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,200
different pocket to the others by

538
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,780
accident

539
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,000
also noticed when I was connecting with

540
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,780
them the other day heartbreak Stone was

541
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,820
held between my thumb and forefinger the

542
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,919
others in my palm

543
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,919
it's just how they ended up

544
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,960
when I went to take

545
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,539
a photo of them my dog nudged them with

546
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,980
her nose and then took heartbreak in her

547
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:23,400
mouth

548
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:27,539
it was a cute moment I felt like it was

549
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:31,260
a sign she can Crush heartbreak easily

550
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,580
she was born to do that she's not afraid

551
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,460
of it

552
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:39,179
they are with me as I meditate

553
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,280
I place them on my body as I rest

554
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,260
it feels as though nothing is an

555
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,559
accident with the stones

556
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:49,799
every little thing is Meaningful I am

557
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,679
paying attention and so are they

558
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:55,740
and it's beautiful I feel supported by

559
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,960
them I took them to a visit to my

560
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,840
niece's grave yesterday who passed away

561
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,640
tragically a year ago tomorrow

562
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,020
they are

563
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,580
with me

564
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,980
not just by my side but they are with me

565
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,320
today they will be with me as I see my

566
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,020
daughter who is avoiding me and

567
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,640
distancing herself for years now it's

568
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,460
been so painful

569
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,620
I'm glad the stones will be there

570
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,740
and they will be absorbing

571
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:29,580
pain and any kind of Sorrow

572
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:32,220
so grateful aw and SOC thank you so much

573
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,100
I don't feel it will be the same after

574
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,740
this I know I will have received healing

575
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,400
for some painful hardships just what my

576
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,400
soul needed

577
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,039
Mary James says it felt natural I simply

578
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,039
knew

579
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,419
um nobody said

580
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:54,299
I did the Free as a bird meditation with

581
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,580
my Stones it was very special and I was

582
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:59,100
so relaxed afterwards I was laying on my

583
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,740
bed with them on my face while I

584
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,620
listened to the podcast and I could feel

585
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:10,200
a frequency admitting from my stones

586
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:14,580
Maria Velez says my Stone named annoyed

587
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,280
it's so annoying I was giving all three

588
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:21,860
a little kiss and it fell right out of

589
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,860
my hand kind of rejecting my love

590
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,179
nobody said day one of the journey was a

591
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,340
special day and I actually picked up

592
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:31,440
five stones but I knew the three that

593
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,760
were meant for me

594
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,640
one

595
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,220
was a ways away from where I started I

596
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,640
was drawn to it as it lay their waiting

597
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,640
for me

598
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,940
garden weed pixie said the day I

599
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,100
collected the stones I got up early in

600
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,620
the morning and got in my car and drove

601
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,320
to the beach it takes about two minutes

602
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,600
for me to get there it's cold at the

603
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,299
moment because it's winter where I am

604
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,980
but it was a beautiful that morning it

605
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:04,860
was beautiful that morning

606
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,980
and the sun was out

607
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:10,520
I chose my stones after carrying one for

608
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,320
a while and discarding it for another

609
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,460
one stone in my collection of the final

610
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,100
three feel so nice and soft to touch

611
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,860
so smooth but soft

612
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,620
I love it it's so comforting and

613
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:30,059
soothing I don't want to let it go it

614
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:32,400
took me ages to name my stones

615
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:35,100
it was so difficult to Define my

616
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,580
feelings to name them I spent the whole

617
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,640
day feeling basically high and happy for

618
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:44,820
no reason though I went and did things

619
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,400
for fun that I never go out and do it

620
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:50,940
was really strange to feel that way but

621
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,580
I definitely needed that day of joy

622
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,980
I only named the stones just before I

623
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,380
went to bed that night I never expected

624
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,659
to have had such a surreal experience

625
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,840
from doing something that I had

626
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:06,419
absolutely no expectations attached to

627
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,419
I thought I'd just be going through the

628
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:12,620
motions this experience has surprised me

629
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,620
in many ways

630
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,640
foreign

631
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,740
there

632
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,279
incredible

633
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,960
Elena says yesterday I felt annoyed by

634
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,919
them even though I love them and deeply

635
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,840
connected them they are there to try to

636
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:46,020
help us heal

637
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,200
so information from old hurt is leaving

638
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:52,380
us it's easy to be annoyed in any way

639
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,159
possible as information from wounds old

640
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,159
PTSD

641
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,640
scars

642
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:04,520
on our soul scars on our being

643
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:09,179
baggage we carry with us into every

644
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:11,700
relationship into every new experience

645
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,039
how many people

646
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,840
do something in their life

647
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,779
and they do it and they're like I need

648
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,240
to live this very second I need to

649
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:23,760
experience this Cliff I'm standing on

650
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,400
now over this beautiful view I need to

651
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,000
take it all in I have to take the sunset

652
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,860
in as much as I can they're desperate to

653
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,080
try to take in that new experience and

654
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,760
they want to be in the present moment

655
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,220
they want to have that mindfulness in

656
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,080
the very moment to experience that as

657
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,059
it's happening they want that connection

658
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,760
so bad

659
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,860
because they're struggling they have

660
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,539
hurt inside they have experiences that

661
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,640
are still clogged up inside they have

662
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:52,140
scars on the sole they're soul-searching

663
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,580
they're trying to find purpose they're

664
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,100
trying to

665
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,840
relieve any kind of internal mental

666
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,900
emotional spiritual suffering of any

667
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,179
kind possible and so they try their best

668
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,159
they're in it they're like I'm

669
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,799
experiencing this air right now I'm

670
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,640
experiencing this Breeze I'm watching

671
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,640
the sun rise

672
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,600
but yet

673
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,500
it's fleeting and I don't know if I'm

674
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,559
really experiencing it like I should and

675
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,299
I don't know am I numb I'm ha I'm

676
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,440
supposed to be having the best time I'm

677
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,360
supposed to be having the best

678
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,779
experience what is going wrong what is

679
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,779
going on

680
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,760
we battle a lot of deep-seated emotional

681
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,860
hurt that sits in percolates and festers

682
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,020
deep inside of us and the collecting

683
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:45,020
Stones meditation you guys is there to

684
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:45,020
suck it out of us to absorb it out of us

685
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:53,460
on IG tough as a mother says what does

686
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:56,640
it mean when your stones break or chip

687
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:00,659
it's very possible the stones

688
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,279
could be absorbing so much

689
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:05,399
so much

690
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:07,020
that they're chipping away

691
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:08,220
everybody's different and your

692
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,740
experiences are different than someone

693
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,539
else's experiences and what your stones

694
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,460
are absorbing is different than what

695
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,740
someone else is absorbing like we can't

696
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:20,100
you can't just take your stones

697
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,539
after they absorb so much and hand them

698
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,440
to somebody else and say okay let them

699
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,440
absorb from you now

700
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,120
now I can't take my Stones ew can't take

701
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,159
my Stones here

702
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,700
and say look I'm gonna give you my

703
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,020
stones after I've had them for a week

704
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,520
they've absorbed any kind of like

705
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,620
emotional pain with me like

706
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,480
discrimination that I've had for years

707
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,820
for hearing a voice

708
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,740
and putting out Advanced Medical

709
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,679
information that's been robbed from me

710
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,320
in spirit and use science uses it and

711
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,120
doesn't credit me and poachers and

712
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,679
influencers use it to try to get a leg

713
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,059
up so they sound like they know what

714
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,179
they're talking about and they steal it

715
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:01,799
and don't you know don't uh whatever

716
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:06,799
there's that and then discrimination for

717
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,799
hearing a voice right that's in my stone

718
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,179
and then broken trust from people I

719
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,940
trusted

720
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:17,279
who make up lies and try to like become

721
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,740
famous themselves because they're

722
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,480
desperate for fame so they try to like

723
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,220
say all kinds of terrible stuff that

724
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,320
isn't true about me right that's in here

725
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,880
broken trust

726
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,620
and there's people I've helped for

727
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,880
decades that don't even cite me or cite

728
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,740
my information people in the health

729
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,380
movement right that have helped that's

730
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,640
in there and the Betrayal

731
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,559
right

732
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,880
where you're doing nothing but like good

733
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,500
things in the world and you're doing

734
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,700
nothing but good things for people and

735
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,260
you're trying to help them and you're

736
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,179
trying to get people help and they just

737
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,640
stab you in the back because

738
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:51,659
they're sick

739
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:54,799
on that they just have a dark heart

740
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,799
so whatever it is

741
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:01,799
whatever it is it's in my Stones I can't

742
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,640
say hey look after seven days of what's

743
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,640
in my stones

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,120
I can't say let me give you these Stones

745
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,539
right here let me give you these Stones

746
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,539
sorry if I lost you guys on

747
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:17,820
up there I can't say here let me give

748
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,159
you my stones

749
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,720
and you let them absorb from you it's

750
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,760
not going to happen these were chosen

751
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,880
for me I chose them or the stones chose

752
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,799
them chose me themselves and the stones

753
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,260
absorbed all that pain or whatever

754
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,020
that's happening that's coming out of me

755
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,360
it's absorbing my baggage everybody has

756
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,940
it there's just the way it works in the

757
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,760
world it's human life it's you know The

758
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:45,059
Human Experience here on planet mess and

759
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,799
we uh we have that in us we've all been

760
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:50,159
hurt one way or another somewhere along

761
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,260
the way even someone that's never had a

762
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,360
bad day in their life because they're

763
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,039
say silver spoon fed and they're a trust

764
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,659
funder and I'm not saying anything's

765
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,520
wrong with that but I'm saying and

766
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:01,919
they've never had they've had full

767
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,840
support from all the love from every

768
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,700
single family member they're totally

769
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,679
protected and they never have to work a

770
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,419
day in their life and they could just go

771
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,760
and just do whatever they want all day

772
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,919
long they still get hurt

773
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,320
they still get hurt they still have pain

774
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,059
they still have sorrow they still have

775
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,059
emotional mental spiritual struggles

776
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,460
everybody does from people who come from

777
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:26,820
nothing to people who have something to

778
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,159
people who are in between we all have it

779
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,840
it's there and we can't exchange our

780
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:33,059
Stones I can't say all right give me

781
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,620
your three stones let me have your three

782
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,220
stones and I'll take those three stones

783
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:40,140
and I'll let me now absorb my pain and

784
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,000
struggles into these stones and then

785
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,620
I'll hand them to somebody else and then

786
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,120
they can have those right there and

787
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,159
that's something I've always been

788
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,919
concerned about

789
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,360
with lots of things because I've seen

790
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,200
people give crystals to other people

791
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,620
just like whoa unless that Crystal came

792
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,919
fresh out of the ground and was and was

793
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,659
um honed by a Craftsman just now and

794
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,880
then handed off to you it's different

795
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:07,799
when you know a lot of times we hand off

796
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,599
our favorite crystals of people what did

797
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,339
the crystal absorb and then we handed it

798
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,780
off to somebody else and someone else is

799
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:14,700
like trying to absorb their stuff into

800
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,399
that Crystal when it's already loaded

801
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,220
with other people's stuff these are

802
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:22,260
yours they're fresh they're brand new

803
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:24,599
from the earth they were chosen for you

804
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,419
you chose them and that's the difference

805
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,159
and your absorption of your pain and

806
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:32,480
struggles goes into these stones and

807
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,480
it's not meant for anybody else

808
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,159
Jasmine on YouTube says Anthony is it

809
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,960
normal to feel the three emotions more

810
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,339
intensely while having the stones with

811
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,320
us yes it is

812
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:46,440
I mean

813
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,940
yeah it does get more intense when you

814
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,899
have them with you and you're getting

815
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:54,960
close to your Stones me tube 787.

816
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:57,060
downhill athletic mountain biker in the

817
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,760
past man

818
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,099
um my 13 year old said last night that

819
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,859
he doesn't want to let go of his Stones

820
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:07,760
totally understand I don't want to let

821
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,760
go of my stones

822
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:15,180
at me on YouTube good to see you at me

823
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,920
what if someone else touches your stones

824
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,900
it's okay

825
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,839
it's fine

826
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,180
because you're not consciously or

827
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:28,020
intentionally or subconsciously

828
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,260
saying these are yours now

829
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:34,020
so say your child says well Daddy

830
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,880
Mommy I wanna like can I play with these

831
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,780
Stones it's fine

832
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,480
because it's not that Dad or Mom or

833
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,880
anyone else or friend isn't saying I am

834
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,339
I'm done using these I'm going to give

835
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,500
these to you these are yours now I'm

836
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:51,240
intentionally telling these Stones

837
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,520
they're not for me anymore I'm

838
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,220
intentionally saying no these are a gift

839
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,440
I'm giving these to you now that's

840
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,880
different and that's different than just

841
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,440
touching the stones or somebody else

842
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,440
touching the stones and that's fine

843
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,079
Sherry Weaver says if I wait a couple of

844
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,820
weeks can I do this again with three

845
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,579
more stones

846
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,720
can always do this exercise alone but I

847
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:17,880
will be telling you we're going to be

848
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,980
doing another one if you want to wait

849
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,380
then of course you can do one

850
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,780
through any time but we're going to do

851
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,940
another one pretty soon and I'll tell

852
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,540
you why

853
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,579
because I have three other names I have

854
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:36,300
to do three new stones with personally

855
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:37,140
in my own personally and I believe so do

856
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,640
you

857
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:44,940
I believe everybody has a few more names

858
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,000
and it was hard to choose

859
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,820
it was hard for me to choose I was like

860
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,339
I really want to use this name here and

861
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,680
I really want to use this name here but

862
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:59,000
I guess I'm gonna use this name this CNN

863
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,000
but I really want to use this name

864
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,680
Jane said over on Facebook one of my

865
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:06,420
Stones renamed itself

866
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,000
that's incredible

867
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,740
that's incredible

868
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,240
Marge over there on YouTube says I have

869
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,920
felt so good

870
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,599
oh and the comment one oh it felt so

871
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,000
good I hope I still release old feel

872
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,720
heavy feelings on IG

873
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,579
Alive by SOC aw can we make up our songs

874
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,220
yes you can you can make up your songs

875
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:28,859
you can do your own Originals you can do

876
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,619
I did Bridge Over Troubled Water

877
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:34,260
but you can definitely do an original

878
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:35,420
song of course and an original hymn and

879
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,099
everything

880
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,859
delhajan said on IG I think the more you

881
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:44,300
talk to the stones and sing

882
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:48,660
Etc they seem to answer you I agree

883
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:51,119
I agree allheartedly

884
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:54,119
flower jasmine on IG says I am releasing

885
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,920
a lot of emotional wounds that I have

886
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,920
been carrying for decades

887
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:06,359
see Lotus Helly says Healy says looking

888
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,300
forward to letting go of my Stones it's

889
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:10,200
going to be epic to let go of stuff big

890
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,140
stuff

891
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,300
it is going to be epic

892
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,859
on that note I know we covered a lot of

893
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,960
things already you guys but on that note

894
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:20,760
about the Epic nature of releasing the

895
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,500
stones

896
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,500
your words epic

897
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,000
which is mind-blowing

898
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,119
all of it

899
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,859
it's going to be intense

900
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,420
for some of us it may not be as intense

901
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,339
right that very second it's going to be

902
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,680
intense later on that day for some of us

903
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:40,200
it's going to be intense before we even

904
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,880
let go of the stone for many of us it's

905
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,220
going to be intense as we're heading to

906
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,680
the place to let go of the song

907
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,079
Serena over there on Facebook I bathed

908
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,540
with them and I cried memories came out

909
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,980
but I tried not to process it I think

910
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,200
that's brilliant I think that's

911
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,359
incredible because you don't have to

912
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,460
process it because the idea is to get it

913
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,380
out of you to the stones the stones need

914
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,540
to absorb it and it doesn't have to be

915
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,119
processed now if it's processed or

916
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,400
memories hit and come then so be it

917
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,420
that's okay but the job for the stones

918
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,420
is to take it on

919
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,400
oh

920
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:24,900
Charles says over there on YouTube what

921
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,119
does it mean when the stones go brighter

922
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:30,660
in color

923
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,900
anger looks like orange it used to be

924
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,000
reddish fear has

925
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,760
fear has

926
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,820
trying to find it

927
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,940
oh I think I lost you oh there you go

928
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:49,020
fear has a bright spot it seems to be

929
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,880
glowing growing it used to be black

930
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,599
that's incredible

931
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,780
as emotions like fear

932
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:00,119
is leaving you leaving your soul and

933
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,020
entering into the stone anything can

934
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,200
happen

935
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:07,400
anything can happen there's no rules

936
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,140
there is no rules here

937
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,140
metaphysically there are no rules Here

938
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,000
There Are No Boundaries Anything Can

939
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,160
Happen through this healing process

940
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,500
through the process of that information

941
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,880
leaving you and going into the stones

942
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,880
there are no rules

943
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,220
singing to your stones are humming to

944
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,760
your Stones is you know experience all

945
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,760
on its own

946
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,420
and one of the reasons why is because it

947
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,040
evokes emotion and then the stones are

948
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,460
going to pick up on that and read that

949
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,140
and pull that in and draw it in

950
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,820
Nancy and division over there on

951
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,740
Facebook says I want to do this but I

952
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,740
miss this cycle how can I do it

953
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,200
I would still sign up

954
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,240
I think there's a way to do it I was

955
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,560
talking about it earlier watch this

956
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,839
video again

957
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,859
and I say it in here already

958
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,859
I'm glad you asked

959
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,880
so you guys this was day four is day

960
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,500
four still going on is day four

961
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,060
checking on you see how you guys are

962
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,560
doing I know we're having interactions

963
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,099
with their Stones I've been holding my

964
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:26,400
Stones this whole time in my left hand

965
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:27,599
and they feel very warm very warm in my

966
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,359
hand

967
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,800
pretty interesting

968
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:33,800
there's my Stones right here

969
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,180
I'm proud of everybody you guys truly

970
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,880
so I want to get us ready for day five

971
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,619
and I think this talk helps because the

972
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,460
information that we're talking about is

973
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:52,040
really really powerful very helpful so I

974
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,119
believe it's

975
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,960
fortifying us

976
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:00,180
for day five which is tomorrow

977
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,920
D5 is going to be more intense day six

978
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,940
is going to be even more intense and day

979
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,320
seven is going to be extremely intense

980
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,000
vegan Allison over there on YouTube says

981
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,920
I feel like things are coming out that

982
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,900
aren't even the names that I gave the

983
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,359
stones and I had a profound experience

984
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:18,300
when I was meditating with them and

985
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,180
praying I felt they were

986
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,160
I felt they were the most supportive and

987
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,380
I have to say that vegan Allison you're

988
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,440
correct

989
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,900
very correct that even the names may not

990
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,119
the names Encompass more is what I'm

991
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,000
saying than what the name is

992
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,220
Buzzy Bee I see you I've been really

993
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,680
tired too I read your comment on YouTube

994
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:43,020
on the last YouTube video too Kim Miller

995
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,720
says every time I offer them a banana I

996
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,700
get chills and feel the connection

997
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,780
I get chills reading

998
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,780
your comments

999
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:57,300
Eliza on YouTube says we are not harming

1000
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,339
the stones are we not harming them at

1001
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,780
all truly not

1002
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:03,420
they're doing their job and here's

1003
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:06,480
what's incredible when we release the

1004
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:10,200
stones when we let go of the stones

1005
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,619
and they leave our hands and Go Back To

1006
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,619
Nature

1007
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,079
what's been in them and absorbed in them

1008
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,780
is going to be neutralized

1009
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:27,960
but not able to rush back into us

1010
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:30,240
not able to rush back into us

1011
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,060
it's uh look I'm I've always supported

1012
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,619
therapy and all kinds of emotional

1013
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,540
therapy for people of course I want

1014
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:39,180
people to have people to talk to and and

1015
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,680
get support emotional healing support in

1016
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,660
all ways

1017
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,099
but I noticed that a lot of people who

1018
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,200
are talking about what they're going

1019
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:47,880
through and they're talking about it and

1020
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,760
it's coming out of them I noticed that

1021
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,460
the minute they leave the office

1022
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,740
or they get off their appointment

1023
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:59,000
it doesn't take long before it kind of

1024
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,000
rushes back into them

1025
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:05,160
because there wasn't really a

1026
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:08,339
neutralizer or a separator there wasn't

1027
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,380
a bridge so what happens is that

1028
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:12,180
when you release these stones into

1029
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,280
nature and they've absorbed a lot of

1030
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,540
what's Happening inside of us a lot of

1031
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,119
our hurt

1032
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:21,240
when we release them

1033
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:24,240
what's inside of them

1034
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,220
it gets neutralized can't just rush back

1035
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,200
to you there's a distance there's an

1036
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,839
incredible distance it's part of how the

1037
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,119
healing works

1038
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:34,859
yeah

1039
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,900
Brandi says I name my Stones weak tired

1040
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:39,060
dismayed to help clear my emotions about

1041
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,920
being diagnosed with autoimmune diseases

1042
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,040
but those emotions started in my

1043
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,220
childhood and happened throughout my

1044
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,220
life

1045
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:52,680
Welby says my Stone's depression has

1046
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:55,980
gone from grayish

1047
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:58,380
to slight blue lines

1048
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:01,020
while blueberry dreams says aw I was sad

1049
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,420
I missed your live the other day with

1050
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:06,300
all of the smokers

1051
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:09,000
I used to smoke cigs in the past two

1052
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:12,480
especially while I drank alcohol

1053
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,920
I'm now smoke free for now one and a

1054
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,560
half years

1055
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,780
and I went out and couldn't have done it

1056
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,359
incredible

1057
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,359

frillis says on IG one stone I found

1062
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,900
actually several small stones held

1063
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,220
together by concrete it seemed so

1064
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,720
appropriate for me I think that's

1065
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,760
amazing

1066
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,859
Concrete in the end it's just a lot of

1067
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,240
sand so that's actually great your

1068
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:50,240
stones are held together with sand

1069
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:59,099
