[34.48 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.60 - 44.60] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 46.36] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[44.60 - 47.88] Williams we're talking about
[46.36 - 50.68] pharmaceuticals we're talking about
[47.88 - 52.56] medications drugs are you on a
[50.68 - 54.48] pharmaceutical have you been taking a
[52.56 - 56.80] drug or a pharmaceutical prescribed by
[54.48 - 59.52] your doctor maybe you're not on any
[56.80 - 60.56] pharmaceutical and you're proud of that
[59.52 - 62.92] maybe
[60.56 - 64.92] you're proud because you're clear and
[62.92 - 67.48] free from all Pharmaceuticals but what
[64.92 - 69.44] you don't know is you still have
[67.48 - 71.64] Pharmaceuticals running through your
[69.44 - 73.80] veins and inside your organs
[71.64 - 76.88] Pharmaceuticals and drugs that have been
[73.80 - 78.92] there for a very long time including
[76.88 - 81.88] drugs and pharmaceuticals that you're
[78.92 - 83.88] exposed to every day and don't even
[81.88 - 85.92] realize it get ready for this episode
[83.88 - 88.84] it's going to blow your mind and make
[85.92 - 91.00] you rethink your everyday
[88.84 - 94.16] life
[91.00 - 97.12] jeez this pole is
[94.16 - 99.60] packed God I should have got here
[97.12 - 103.20] earlier this is insane there's a LIF
[99.60 - 106.84] guard here who
[103.20 - 109.64] oh just got splashed in the
[106.84 - 112.16] face God you know I used to really like
[109.64 - 114.52] this hotel but this place is insane
[112.16 - 117.76] right now it's like everybody took a
[114.52 - 119.96] vacation all at the same time or
[117.76 - 122.40] something I think I just got a water
[119.96 - 127.88] Drop In My Mouth from the
[122.40 - 131.08] pool all right I'm I'm going to get in
[127.88 - 134.28] just what's that floating
[131.08 - 136.32] there what is that why is the Lifeguard
[134.28 - 141.04] like starting to round everybody
[136.32 - 143.20] up he's he's shutting down the pool he
[141.04 - 146.84] everybody's got to get out all
[143.20 - 151.56] right all right we're all we're getting
[146.84 - 153.40] out what what is that in the pool
[151.56 - 155.36] even if you're not taking a
[153.40 - 157.48] pharmaceutical even if you're not taking
[155.36 - 159.60] a drug that's prescribed by your doctor
[157.48 - 163.20] you're still taking them you're taking
[159.60 - 166.60] them in different forms pools and water
[163.20 - 168.48] parks great way to absorb
[166.60 - 171.52] Pharmaceuticals have you ever been into
[168.48 - 173.32] a public pool or maybe a private pool
[171.52 - 175.40] that many people have swam through the
[173.32 - 178.92] course of the years have you ever been
[175.40 - 182.36] to water park all of these places have
[178.92 - 183.68] Pharmaceuticals inside the water I know
[182.36 - 185.68] what you're thinking you're thinking
[183.68 - 188.00] they chlorinate the pole it's
[185.68 - 191.04] disinfected so there's nothing to worry
[188.00 - 193.16] about they shock it with chlorine for
[191.04 - 194.72] parasites bacteria and
[193.16 - 197.48] algae
[194.72 - 198.88] chlorine doesn't remove any of the
[197.48 - 201.84] pharmaceutical
[198.88 - 204.32] residues so how do Pharmaceuticals get
[201.84 - 207.20] into the water in the pool or the water
[204.32 - 210.56] park how does it get out of somebody's
[207.20 - 213.68] body and into the water when someone
[210.56 - 216.20] takes antibiotics anti-depressants
[213.68 - 218.00] anti-inflammatories sleeping pills
[216.20 - 219.88] biologics
[218.00 - 223.48] immunosupressants prescription
[219.88 - 225.84] amphetamines opioids statins blood
[223.48 - 227.80] pressure medications hormone medications
[225.84 - 231.76] thyroid medication
[227.80 - 234.60] steroids the pill pharmaceutical alcohol
[231.76 - 238.04] recreational drugs of any kind it comes
[234.60 - 240.44] out through the skin it's sticking to
[238.04 - 242.48] their skin in their sweat it's coming
[240.44 - 245.36] out of their bodies it's in their
[242.48 - 249.36] armpits it's in their breath it's in
[245.36 - 251.64] their spit it's in their urine it's
[249.36 - 255.36] everywhere so when someone's swimming in
[251.64 - 257.92] the pool there's pharmaceutical runoff
[255.36 - 260.68] that's Pharmaceuticals running off of
[257.92 - 263.20] their skin coming out of their armpits
[260.68 - 264.84] coming off their genitals coming out of
[263.20 - 268.72] their mouth when they get water in their
[264.84 - 270.72] mouth and even when they pee in the pool
[268.72 - 272.52] they don't have to urinate in the pole
[270.72 - 274.92] they can have a little few drops of
[272.52 - 278.64] urine in their shorts and they get into
[274.92 - 281.88] the pole or feces that hasn't been wiped
[278.64 - 284.00] good it gets in the pole water and when
[281.88 - 286.12] someone's taking Pharmaceuticals and
[284.00 - 288.72] they're prescribed drugs and medications
[286.12 - 291.56] or on recreational drugs it's inside
[288.72 - 295.12] their intestinal tract so when they have
[291.56 - 299.76] flatulence gas it's inside the
[295.12 - 303.16] gas so when one person farts in the pole
[299.76 - 305.72] that gas is filtered through the water
[303.16 - 309.32] so as the gas bubbles come out of their
[305.72 - 311.60] anus it's now circulating through the
[309.32 - 313.96] water and it rises to the top and then
[311.60 - 316.64] the gas appears people think that's
[313.96 - 319.96] funny a lot of times and there's a lot
[316.64 - 321.84] of jokes around it but either way that
[319.96 - 324.44] gas was filtered through the water the
[321.84 - 327.04] water acted as a filter grabbing onto
[324.44 - 328.12] everything in there including residues
[327.04 - 330.12] of
[328.12 - 333.16] pharmaceuticals and then there's
[330.12 - 335.88] pharmaceutical creams a lot of people
[333.16 - 340.52] are on ointments prescribed by their
[335.88 - 344.08] doctors ointments and creams acne creams
[340.52 - 347.20] dermatitis creams steroids for
[344.08 - 349.48] ecori creams for all kinds of different
[347.20 - 352.44] ringworm creams and ointments for the
[349.48 - 356.92] shingles creams and ointments for herpes
[352.44 - 359.88] simplex one Simplex 2 creams for rashes
[356.92 - 364.04] creams for hormones and cream and
[359.88 - 366.08] ointments for poison ivy and poison oak
[364.04 - 369.72] and then there's creams and sprays and
[366.08 - 372.44] ointments for feet problems foot fungus
[369.72 - 375.00] athletes foot toenail fungus and
[372.44 - 377.52] fingernail fungus and there's ointments
[375.00 - 380.16] and creams for warts warts on the feet
[377.52 - 381.76] warts on the hands and there's so many
[380.16 - 384.00] more creams and ointments from
[381.76 - 386.60] pharmaceutical companies prescribed for
[384.00 - 389.04] patients and over the counter at the
[386.60 - 392.72] drugstore and of course we can't forget
[389.04 - 395.76] Kim therapy drugs that are topical but
[392.72 - 398.20] you might be thinking maybe none of this
[395.76 - 400.56] matters you weren't swimming on the day
[398.20 - 403.68] they were swimming plus all that
[400.56 - 406.16] chlorine that shock to the water all
[403.68 - 408.64] that fungicide to the water takes care
[406.16 - 411.76] of it it's fresh and new the minute they
[408.64 - 415.88] do it and then the filtration pull
[411.76 - 418.44] filters that must get everything nope it
[415.88 - 419.92] doesn't doesn't get anything the filter
[418.44 - 421.92] doesn't filter any of the
[419.92 - 424.88] Pharmaceuticals the pharmaceutical
[421.92 - 427.60] runoff stays in the pole for the
[424.88 - 431.36] lifetime of the water that's staying in
[427.60 - 434.88] the pole a hotel pole could potentially
[431.36 - 438.24] have thousands and thousands of people
[434.88 - 440.72] inside that pole throughout the years
[438.24 - 444.68] and a hotel may not drain the water out
[440.72 - 447.16] of that pole for a decade or more the
[444.68 - 449.92] pharmaceutical soup inside the pole
[447.16 - 451.96] concentrates and concentrates and never
[449.92 - 455.56] dissipates but don't worry don't worry
[451.96 - 457.88] the pool guy will come in test the water
[455.56 - 460.96] make sure everything's okay throw some
[457.88 - 463.04] chlorine in there clean up a little bit
[460.96 - 466.52] and everything should be great but the
[463.04 - 469.52] pole guy isn't testing for
[466.52 - 471.04] pharmaceuticals there could be hundreds
[469.52 - 473.64] and hundreds of different
[471.04 - 475.92] Pharmaceuticals in the pool water for
[473.64 - 478.68] years many Pharmaceuticals that were
[475.92 - 480.96] even taken off the market because they
[478.68 - 483.04] were dangerous or cause
[480.96 - 485.72] problems and then what about the big
[483.04 - 488.36] concern that so many people have and so
[485.72 - 489.64] many doctors have and health authorities
[488.36 - 493.32] have which is
[489.64 - 495.60] mixing Pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical
[493.32 - 498.04] cocktails you can't take this drug with
[495.60 - 500.12] this drug can't take these two drugs and
[498.04 - 502.28] then take this drug you can't take these
[500.12 - 504.40] three drugs and bring this one in boom
[502.28 - 506.76] they all go bad you can't take this drug
[504.40 - 508.48] and that drug at the same time if you
[506.76 - 511.88] take this drug with this drug you could
[508.48 - 515.36] have a bad reaction could even be death
[511.88 - 517.76] meanwhile the pole is filled with a ton
[515.36 - 520.00] of different kinds of
[517.76 - 523.52] drugs all right so they open the pole
[520.00 - 527.16] back up yeah get your towel okay yep
[523.52 - 527.16] lifeguard says it's all clear
[529.48 - 535.24] okay it's actually warm in here pretty
[532.32 - 535.24] good
[535.60 - 541.04] okay I just swallowed a whole gulp of
[538.80 - 543.56] water
[541.04 - 546.00] did you ever swallow a gulp of water in
[543.56 - 548.44] a public pool did you ever swallow a
[546.00 - 551.36] gulp of water in a private pool either
[548.44 - 554.24] way it's easy to swallow a gulp of water
[551.36 - 556.12] in a pole or get water in your mouth or
[554.24 - 559.52] get water in your eyes nevertheless in
[556.12 - 562.68] your ears and once you swallow that gulp
[559.52 - 564.64] of water all that pharmaceutical residue
[562.68 - 566.68] Finds Its way inside the body gets into
[564.64 - 569.36] the liver gets into the organs the
[566.68 - 572.08] tissue gets to your brain and and all
[569.36 - 573.96] the pharmaceutical creams they actually
[572.08 - 576.32] enter into your body really easy too
[573.96 - 578.60] Through Your Skin other Pharmaceuticals
[576.32 - 580.72] enter your body through your skin too
[578.60 - 582.84] all of it could get through your skin
[580.72 - 585.56] does it even have to be in your ears
[582.84 - 587.52] eyes or mouth and then what about
[585.56 - 591.36] someone who's swimming that's on
[587.52 - 594.32] recreational drugs weed ecstasy Molly
[591.36 - 597.88] meth you don't think a meth head swims
[594.32 - 600.12] what about cocaine heroin crack or just
[597.88 - 602.48] anybody who's addicted icted to opioids
[600.12 - 604.32] one way or another through prescription
[602.48 - 607.52] Pharmaceuticals CU they were in a lot of
[604.32 - 609.68] pain or someone who's a drug addict who
[607.52 - 613.24] just has a connection and takes them
[609.68 - 615.96] anyway either way it ends up in the pole
[613.24 - 618.56] and it stays there and stays there and
[615.96 - 621.40] then concentrates over time and then
[618.56 - 623.72] more people come in and bring in more
[621.40 - 626.16] Pharmaceuticals and what about the water
[623.72 - 628.80] supply where did the water come from
[626.16 - 631.36] originally that entered the pole and
[628.80 - 634.60] then water filtration systems they don't
[631.36 - 636.60] grab on to pharmaceutical residue how do
[634.60 - 639.12] Pharmaceuticals get into the water
[636.60 - 640.72] supply people are eliminating the
[639.12 - 643.12] Pharmaceuticals out of their body when
[640.72 - 646.48] they go to the bathroom and it ends up
[643.12 - 649.00] back into the water system so that when
[646.48 - 651.00] we're filling our poles with water we're
[649.00 - 653.64] filling our poles with water that has
[651.00 - 655.80] pharmaceutical residue in it already and
[653.64 - 658.64] our water supplies in general have
[655.80 - 660.60] contamination in them this also means
[658.64 - 663.16] that Med medication leased water can end
[660.60 - 665.96] up anywhere it could become part of our
[663.16 - 669.00] food through reservoirs irrigation
[665.96 - 672.04] Public Water Supplies wellwater near
[669.00 - 675.00] septic tanks and fish swimming in lakes
[672.04 - 677.60] rivers and oceans all absorbing
[675.00 - 679.72] pharmaceutical residue and maybe you're
[677.60 - 683.60] thinking you haven't swam in a pole for
[679.72 - 685.52] a very very long time like years but
[683.60 - 688.60] guess what when you did swim in that
[685.52 - 690.88] pool a long time ago that pharmaceutical
[688.60 - 692.56] resident do got into your body and
[690.88 - 695.08] stayed there unless you're doing
[692.56 - 697.80] something actively trying to remove it
[695.08 - 700.36] or get it out or cleanse it or if you're
[697.80 - 702.40] brushing your teeth with the water or
[700.36 - 704.32] cooking with tap water or eating at at
[702.40 - 706.92] restaurants or getting coffee at
[704.32 - 708.28] restaurants drinking tea in restaurants
[706.92 - 711.04] you're getting that pharmaceutical
[708.28 - 714.24] treated water and restaurant water
[711.04 - 716.96] normally contains pharmaceutical run off
[714.24 - 718.76] this isn't about fear this isn't about
[716.96 - 721.28] not being able to live your life that's
[718.76 - 723.00] not not it it's being aware of what's
[721.28 - 724.56] happening out there so you can do
[723.00 - 726.24] something about it so you can be
[724.56 - 728.40] proactive
[726.24 - 731.16] empowered because it's Death By A
[728.40 - 733.36] Thousand Cuts it chips away at us over
[731.16 - 736.24] time and then when we get sick how do we
[733.36 - 737.88] get better fast how do we look out for
[736.24 - 740.48] the pitfalls the
[737.88 - 743.00] potholes and how do we get rid of the
[740.48 - 745.00] pharmaceutical exposure even if we're
[743.00 - 747.04] taking Pharmaceuticals prescribed by our
[745.00 - 749.76] doctors we still want to cleanse out the
[747.04 - 752.32] old stuff the residue
[749.76 - 754.60] our bodies are up against a lot we
[752.32 - 757.88] already have a difficult time naturally
[754.60 - 760.24] detoxing anything here on planet Earth
[757.88 - 763.08] our bodies have a difficult time enough
[760.24 - 765.56] getting rid of natural bodily toxins
[763.08 - 768.60] we're not designed to get rid of all
[765.56 - 771.00] these different chemicals and metals and
[768.60 - 772.56] man-made Industrial Waste not to mention
[771.00 - 775.44] things that were exposed to every day
[772.56 - 777.64] fragrances colognes perfumes cleaning
[775.44 - 780.36] products and then there's pesticides
[777.64 - 782.88] herbicides fungicides we get it on us
[780.36 - 785.64] all the time just buying brand new
[782.88 - 788.16] clothes our body gets exposed to so many
[785.64 - 790.48] different chemicals from that alone our
[788.16 - 792.96] bodies are not indestructible they're
[790.48 - 795.00] not meant to receive all these different
[792.96 - 797.52] toxins and poisons and get
[795.00 - 800.52] bombarded and at the same time our
[797.52 - 803.20] bodies are resilient and they're strong
[800.52 - 805.12] but they have a breaking point we take
[803.20 - 807.60] our bodies for granted here on planet
[805.12 - 810.48] Earth and then when our body starts to
[807.60 - 813.20] fail like we get symptoms and conditions
[810.48 - 815.16] we're not feeling good we listen to
[813.20 - 818.12] people telling us it's our fault our
[815.16 - 821.44] body's fault then we end up hating our
[818.12 - 823.32] bodies we start blaming our bodies
[821.44 - 825.24] thinking that they're faulty they're not
[823.32 - 828.60] working good how come we can't get out
[825.24 - 832.44] of the sickness or the symptom your body
[828.60 - 835.24] can't just tell you hey mister we got
[832.44 - 837.52] exposed something got into us when we
[835.24 - 840.88] were swimming all these Pharmaceuticals
[837.52 - 843.40] entered us our bodies can't say hey did
[840.88 - 846.72] you know that tap water that was used in
[843.40 - 850.32] the coffee at the fancy coffee shop was
[846.72 - 853.36] toxic and it got something into us and
[850.32 - 855.56] our bodies can't say Hey listen all that
[853.36 - 857.96] tap water we're using for the shower and
[855.56 - 860.36] the bathroom and for your coffee and for
[857.96 - 863.32] your food is all saturated with
[860.36 - 865.08] Pharmaceuticals and getting in us and I
[863.32 - 868.44] just need a little help getting it out
