[0.24 - 4.00] and that's important because a lot of
[1.60 - 6.16] people they don't know
[4.00 - 9.76] like the ebbs and flows of healing it's
[6.16 - 11.76] three steps up two steps down
[9.76 - 14.56] five steps up
[11.76 - 17.52] one step down
[14.56 - 21.52] seven steps up five steps back
[17.52 - 23.36] nine steps up one step back
[21.52 - 25.92] and now you're driving your car oh my
[23.36 - 27.60] god i'm feeling kind of energetic i'm
[25.92 - 30.88] driving my car i'm not having panic
[27.60 - 33.84] attacks anymore my fatigue is leaving me
[30.88 - 35.84] now i'm not feeling as dizzy
[33.84 - 38.48] so i'm actually doing a little better
[35.84 - 40.88] i'm not getting the heart racing today
[38.48 - 42.32] it's a little better and then it's like
[40.88 - 43.76] nine steps up
[42.32 - 45.84] another step up
[43.76 - 47.52] two steps back and what happens is as
[45.84 - 49.60] you're healing
[47.52 - 50.56] you over exert yourself so if you're
[49.60 - 52.48] somebody
[50.56 - 54.40] who is just on mattress island and you
[52.48 - 55.92] were stuck on mattress island and you
[54.40 - 58.08] were stuck there
[55.92 - 60.40] for a while where you're like 20 hours a
[58.08 - 62.56] day in bed 15 hours a day in bed couch
[60.40 - 64.40] island 10 hours a day on couch island
[62.56 - 66.24] right
[64.40 - 67.52] and now you're starting to get better
[66.24 - 69.44] because you're doing all this great
[67.52 - 72.16] stuff you're taking the the right kind
[69.44 - 74.64] of b12 you're taking the right kind of
[72.16 - 77.12] licorice you're doing your lemon balm
[74.64 - 79.12] tea you're doing some celery juice
[77.12 - 81.44] you're doing some other things you're
[79.12 - 83.44] reading some details on how to heal and
[81.44 - 84.96] learning and you're getting rid of a
[83.44 - 87.12] couple of foods that were causing
[84.96 - 89.04] trouble and then you start going up and
[87.12 - 89.84] then you start going up okay you guys
[89.04 - 92.96] right
[89.84 - 92.96] and as you're going up
[93.12 - 97.60] you're gonna
[94.40 - 99.28] do more than you have in a long time
[97.60 - 101.36] you're actually
[99.28 - 102.80] going to do more
[101.36 - 104.48] and when you do more and that could be
[102.80 - 105.92] just that you're in the kitchen so now
[104.48 - 107.28] you're in the kitchen and you're working
[105.92 - 109.52] more in the kitchen you're working in
[107.28 - 111.44] the kitchen sink and now you're washing
[109.52 - 113.12] more stuff and you're doing more and
[111.44 - 115.12] you're 10 minutes more in the kitchen
[113.12 - 116.32] sink and then you're doing some other
[115.12 - 118.00] things too
[116.32 - 119.92] maybe you're doing some other stuff and
[118.00 - 121.44] what happens is i'll go take a walk now
[119.92 - 122.80] i'm taking a walk now i'm taking a
[121.44 - 125.20] 20-minute walk
[122.80 - 127.84] and then we do more
[125.20 - 131.36] because we're getting better our nervous
[127.84 - 133.04] system is getting stronger we're healing
[131.36 - 135.44] and then we go back
[133.04 - 138.48] we get kicked back
[135.44 - 140.40] but we're still better than where we
[138.48 - 142.00] were before
[140.40 - 143.20] we're kicked back and then we panic oh
[142.00 - 145.20] my god am i getting sick again
[143.20 - 146.96] everything i'm doing is wrong everything
[145.20 - 149.60] i'm doing is wrong nothing i'm doing is

[154.72 - 159.28] symptoms getting a little bit better
[157.60 - 160.88] this other symptoms getting a little bit
[159.28 - 163.28] better

[256.40 - 261.12] bit we start doing more
[259.04 - 263.36] right you guys that's what happens to a
[261.12 - 265.92] lot of people when they start healing
[263.36 - 268.00] i've seen people that were bedridden
[265.92 - 270.56] and then got the b12 in them they're
[268.00 - 271.92] bedridden with chronic fatigue syndrome
[270.56 - 272.88] me
[271.92 - 275.20] right
[272.88 - 277.92] brain inflammation chronic fatigue
[275.20 - 280.84] syndrome they bend every doctor they're
[277.92 - 283.04] on mattress island their legs feel like
[280.84 - 285.12] sandbags they feel like they're they're
[283.04 - 287.28] holding cement
[285.12 - 290.32] can't even hold their body up they
[287.28 - 291.92] atrophy because they can't exercise and
[290.32 - 293.60] then boom they're they're in bed they're
[291.92 - 295.20] on mattress island a lot and i'm like
[293.60 - 297.20] well you've got to take your b12 and
[295.20 - 298.80] they've taken the b12 each day each day
[297.20 - 301.04] and all of a sudden
[298.80 - 302.32] they're not hurting so bad and they're
[301.04 - 303.68] elbow
[302.32 - 305.92] and they're getting a little bit more
[303.68 - 307.76] energy for about five minutes during the
[305.92 - 309.92] day and they're like oh my god this is
[307.76 - 311.68] amazing and then 10 days later they're
[309.92 - 313.92] getting more energy and then they push
[311.68 - 315.36] it too far and now they're often hurting
[313.92 - 316.80] again for a little bit and they're like
[315.36 - 318.96] what do i do what's going on i
[316.80 - 322.16] understand i said you do three steps up
[318.96 - 324.88] two steps back three steps up two steps
[322.16 - 327.12] back the healing process it's three
[324.88 - 329.20] steps up and then five steps up and then
[327.12 - 330.96] nine steps up two steps back and then
[329.20 - 333.20] you're further than where you were
[330.96 - 335.28] before
[333.20 - 337.12] further than where you were before when
[335.28 - 338.96] you're doing the right things and you
[337.12 - 340.24] know about the details to heal and
[338.96 - 341.60] you're bringing in your cellular juice
[340.24 - 343.76] in your heavy metal detox smoothie
[341.60 - 346.08] you're taking the right kind of b12 and
[343.76 - 347.84] you're doing these things a little bit
[346.08 - 349.60] at a time whether you're an animal
[347.84 - 350.96] protein person or a plant-based protein
[349.60 - 353.52] person but you're doing a little bit of
[350.96 - 355.84] time and you're bringing it in
[353.52 - 357.76] and then you can you start to recover
[355.84 - 360.40] and you start getting stronger it comes
[357.76 - 364.08] to a point where eventually
[360.40 - 364.96] you're living your life again
[364.08 - 367.12] and
[364.96 - 368.96] you're really pushing now the envelope
[367.12 - 371.92] you're living your life again so now you
[368.96 - 374.88] go to the beach take two hour walk
[371.92 - 376.24] now you you go to visit a friend now you
[374.88 - 377.92] make this whole you know you make a
[376.24 - 379.68] dinner party for a whole bunch of family
[377.92 - 380.96] coming over now you do this and then
[379.68 - 382.64] you're like oh my god i'm getting my
[380.96 - 384.16] life back i'm living my life and then
[382.64 - 386.48] the next day or two you're just you're
[384.16 - 388.24] zonked you ran on the treadmill and now
[386.48 - 390.16] you're zonked
[388.24 - 392.24] because you're doing the three steps up
[390.16 - 394.96] two steps back there's so many different
[392.24 - 396.64] scenarios it could be the most serious
[394.96 - 398.72] scenario where someone's been bedridden
[396.64 - 400.64] for a long time they had every diagnosis
[398.72 - 402.56] from neurological lyme to ms or anything
[400.64 - 404.24] else and they can't take a shower
[402.56 - 406.24] because when they get into the shower
[404.24 - 407.28] the water hits them on the back of the
[406.24 - 408.56] head
[407.28 - 410.72] the water hits them on the back of the
[408.56 - 413.28] head and they almost get knocked over by
[410.72 - 415.44] it and after the shower they have to go
[413.28 - 417.44] and just try to get like their robe on
[415.44 - 419.36] and lay in bed and they're in bed and
[417.44 - 421.52] they're literally shaking not because
[419.36 - 424.08] they're cold but they're shaking in bed
[421.52 - 426.88] because it was a lot for them even on
[424.08 - 428.96] that scale they're still three steps up
[426.88 - 431.20] two steps back and now you're taking a
[428.96 - 432.72] shower now you're able to wash your hair
[431.20 - 435.04] now you're able to do things like this
[432.72 - 436.48] and it's like you get it's just up and
[435.04 - 438.16] then you get kicked back a little it
[436.48 - 441.44] could be on that
[438.16 - 442.40] that kind of serious scenario
[441.44 - 444.80] to
[442.40 - 445.92] you're strong and you're exercising but
[444.80 - 447.20] you're not at the top of the game
[445.92 - 450.24] because you're rehabbing and getting
[447.20 - 454.08] stronger and stronger right it's in in
[450.24 - 455.68] the rehab process after an illness comes
[454.08 - 457.60] so even though you're getting your
[455.68 - 459.84] nervous system stronger and you've got
[457.60 - 461.92] your b12 right you guys and you're

[481.28 - 484.64] what you know right you're doing your
[482.56 - 486.72] spirulina even if you're doing a little
[484.64 - 488.64] bit of it you're doing your spinach soup
[486.72 - 491.68] so you're blending your spinach soup you
[488.64 - 494.00] guys and you're doing your spinach soup
[491.68 - 495.76] you're doing these tools and you start
[494.00 - 498.88] getting better
[495.76 - 500.00] on your rehab you still need to rehab a
[498.88 - 501.92] little bit
[500.00 - 504.24] and say you're doing a mono cleanse for
[501.92 - 505.68] your gastroparesis say you're doing the
[504.24 - 507.20] 369
[505.68 - 509.12] cleanse

[511.68 - 515.36] taking some of the supplements in here
[513.68 - 517.12] too so you're taking some of the
[515.36 - 519.76] supplements right
[517.12 - 521.84] knowing the cause and the protocol so
[519.76 - 524.08] now you're learning and you're like whoa
[521.84 - 527.04] i can take a little bit of licorice root
[524.08 - 529.12] anthony says inside here you can start
[527.04 - 532.24] really slow because it's not one size
[529.12 - 534.72] fits all it's customizable and you can
[532.24 - 537.44] do a little bit of licorice a little bit
[534.72 - 539.12] of b12 and then you start to move
[537.44 - 541.28] forward
[539.12 - 543.28] and as you're moving forward you're
[541.28 - 545.36] getting stronger and you're gonna use
[543.28 - 547.12] that energy you're gonna use it and
[545.36 - 549.28] you're gonna use it
[547.12 - 551.20] hard
[549.28 - 554.72] that's what you're gonna do you're gonna
[551.20 - 557.04] be like i'm gonna push it now because
[554.72 - 560.08] and i see this with everybody healing
[557.04 - 562.88] since i was age four i have watched
[560.08 - 565.44] every person who has ever you know come
[562.88 - 567.84] to me throughout since i was a child and
[565.44 - 570.72] their healing process is same like even
[567.84 - 572.24] sports people now like olympic athletes
[570.72 - 573.84] that talk to me right that i've known
[572.24 - 576.64] they've been friends with
[573.84 - 577.92] for years they're like well i injured my
[576.64 - 579.60] leg
[577.92 - 581.12] and i want to go right back to full
[579.60 - 583.12] throttle i'm like
[581.12 - 585.04] you go back to full throttle right now
[583.12 - 587.60] you're going to get kicked back so let's
[585.04 - 588.72] let's let's build up so your three steps
[587.60 - 590.08] up and you're going to kick back a
[588.72 - 592.08] little bit and then you get a lit it's a
[590.08 - 594.48] rehab process and a chronic illness if
[592.08 - 596.80] there's something similar to that
[594.48 - 598.96] and how long it takes for somebody to
[596.80 - 600.32] heal
[598.96 - 602.80] depends
[600.32 - 605.12] on a few things if you guys got a second
[602.80 - 608.24] to hear this for a second
[605.12 - 610.40] how long it takes to heal
[608.24 - 613.44] depends
[610.40 - 615.68] on what's wrong inside
[613.44 - 618.00] do you have just the shingles virus
[615.68 - 620.24] giving you some aches in your jaw do you
[618.00 - 621.76] have the epstein barr giving you fatigue
[620.24 - 624.56] and brain fog
[621.76 - 627.04] do you have streptococcus giving you
[624.56 - 629.44] chronic utis at the same time and
[627.04 - 631.44] chronic sinusitis or whatever do you
[629.44 - 633.28] have three varieties of strep because
[631.44 - 634.72] the doctors won't know do you have two
[633.28 - 636.72] varieties of shingles you have three
[634.72 - 639.44] varieties of epstein-barr or do you have
[636.72 - 641.28] just a lot of heavy metals right maybe
[639.44 - 643.52] you had a lot of dental work done and
[641.28 - 645.84] you had lots of metal through that how
[643.52 - 647.84] many fluoride treatments have you had
[645.84 - 649.36] what kind of obstacles have you been up
[647.84 - 651.52] against right
[649.36 - 654.56] all these things matter
[651.52 - 656.72] how many toxins are inside of us you
[654.56 - 658.48] guys right
[656.72 - 661.92] how many
[658.48 - 663.84] toxins how many combinations of toxic
[661.92 - 665.92] heavy metals do you have inside of you
[663.84 - 668.80] too so how many
[665.92 - 671.84] combinations of toxic heavy metals are
[668.80 - 674.24] inside your brain
[671.84 - 676.00] are is your epstein bar stronger than
[674.24 - 677.28] someone else's epstein-barr you know
[676.00 - 678.64] what happens in the medical medium
[677.28 - 681.60] community
[678.64 - 684.48] people come to the community
[681.60 - 686.08] years ago or whatever and they heal
[684.48 - 688.64] they heal
[686.08 - 691.76] they go on their merry way
[688.64 - 694.32] and then they get themselves sick again
[691.76 - 696.56] they either contract another
[694.32 - 700.08] new epstein bar
[696.56 - 700.08] they contract a new
[700.40 - 704.72] bacteria streptococcus maybe from a new
[703.20 - 707.12] relationship because that's life that's
[704.72 - 709.12] how we have to live we have to we meet
[707.12 - 711.20] people whatever and now we got a new
[709.12 - 713.60] book and all of a sudden now
[711.20 - 715.04] problems are coming back
[713.60 - 716.48] and that's the incredible thing about
[715.04 - 719.28] medical medium information then it's
[716.48 - 721.52] time to do it again and to get rid of
[719.28 - 723.52] these bugs a lot of people
[721.52 - 725.20] have a lot of different metals than them
[723.52 - 727.36] and different bugs and different
[725.20 - 729.52] combinations and different toxins and
[727.36 - 731.52] chemicals right all these different
[729.52 - 734.00] things they have inside of them
[731.52 - 736.48] so everybody's healing process is at a
[734.00 - 737.84] different time frame it's at a different
[736.48 - 740.40] time
[737.84 - 742.00] someone could heal one thing really
[740.40 - 744.32] quick
[742.00 - 747.12] jennifer pierce says my ibs was acting
[744.32 - 749.76] up so bad been doing lemon water celery
[747.12 - 753.04] juice and heavy metal detox today was a
[749.76 - 755.52] great day finally out of pain and not

[756.96 - 762.00] being here right
[759.68 - 764.08] so you guys healing process and the
[762.00 - 766.32] timely fashion of the healing process
[764.08 - 767.20] also depends on
[766.32 - 770.80] what
[767.20 - 773.12] traps have been set that are taken
[770.80 - 775.84] our butts down let's go into that a
[773.12 - 778.24] little bit next all right
[775.84 - 780.72] the traps rosemary says how do you know
[778.24 - 782.40] what you have do you need a medical
[780.72 - 784.48] diagnosis

[789.28 - 794.32] doctors specialists you guys know
[792.56 - 797.04] and they still couldn't figure out what
[794.32 - 799.44] was going on so the books here

[836.32 - 843.44] get it on sale there 51 off
[840.32 - 845.12] talk about traps and obstacles
[843.44 - 848.00] this is a big one
[845.12 - 850.96] this one's critical just so you know
[848.00 - 850.96] right and
[853.36 - 856.96] this charcoal right here
[855.44 - 858.40] i got this whole thing's filled with
[856.96 - 859.92] charcoal i've been
[858.40 - 861.44] drinking charcoal and you know i'm
[859.92 - 863.76] kidding
[861.44 - 865.04] prime example right there
[863.76 - 866.96] somebody
[865.04 - 869.04] wanting to get better and then them
[866.96 - 870.72] they're taking something like charcoal
[869.04 - 872.64] activated charcoal and they're
[870.72 - 874.32] swallowing it
[872.64 - 876.64] it's that kind of thing that could set
[874.32 - 878.08] people back terribly who are struggling
[876.64 - 880.08] and trying to move forward this is lemon
[878.08 - 882.00] balm tea
[880.08 - 884.96] there's lots of traps like that out
[882.00 - 887.84] there so healing depends on how many
[884.96 - 889.92] traps were set did you do all the coffee
[887.84 - 892.24] enemas that could set you back in
[889.92 - 894.72] healing for years
[892.24 - 898.00] if you're not doing the right stuff
[894.72 - 902.00] did you do the sodium bicarbonate game
[898.00 - 904.88] it can set you back for years
[902.00 - 906.96] guzzling all that sodium bicarbonate
[904.88 - 908.56] in your intestinal tract
[906.96 - 910.84] nightmare
[908.56 - 915.04] did you do the apple cider vinegar
[910.84 - 917.44] game could totally trash your stomach
[915.04 - 919.12] that's just a start right
[917.44 - 922.40] did you do the diatomaceous earth
[919.12 - 925.04] particles did you do the chlorella
[922.40 - 926.56] did you do the pearl powder
[925.04 - 928.88] this pearl powder will ruin your
[926.56 - 930.56] intestinal tract the problem is with the
[928.88 - 932.64] pearl powder
[930.56 - 937.12] is unfortunately there's going to be a
[932.64 - 938.64] whole bunch of young adults
[937.12 - 940.32] that are going to be hurting really bad
[938.64 - 942.40] down the road in their stomachs and
[940.32 - 944.72] intestinal tracts from getting sucked
[942.40 - 946.88] into the pearl powder game right
[944.72 - 949.20] did you do the alkaline ionizer water
[946.88 - 951.52] machines with all the medical met the
[949.20 - 952.64] metal particles that break free off of
[951.52 - 955.76] the
[952.64 - 957.68] right the metal plates all these things
[955.76 - 959.20] they add up so here you are you're
[957.68 - 961.60] trying to heal
[959.20 - 963.60] and it depends on what the person has
[961.60 - 966.00] done so it may take time to heal or at
[963.60 - 969.12] least learn how to stop these things the
[966.00 - 971.04] scale tips so someone's like well i'm
[969.12 - 972.88] trying to get better and i'm working on
[971.04 - 974.24] it why is it taking so long and you go
[972.88 - 976.40] through their stuff they got natural
[974.24 - 978.48] flavors msg and everything they got all
[976.40 - 981.84] this other stuff going on
[978.48 - 982.96] that i'm talking about so the traps are
[981.84 - 985.84] laid
[982.96 - 988.24] the bait and switches are laid
[985.84 - 990.08] they're all sitting there so someone
[988.24 - 992.00] who's chronically ill is just gonna walk
[990.08 - 993.68] along and that's what they're gonna do
[992.00 - 996.80] and they're gonna walk around because
[993.68 - 998.24] they're stuck in the woods
[996.80 - 999.92] when you're chronically sick you don't
[998.24 - 1001.44] have answers and you've been to doctor
[999.92 - 1003.28] the doctor and now you're trying every
[1001.44 - 1007.04] trendy trap you're in the woods you're
[1003.28 - 1009.70] walking in the woods and then you step
[1007.04 - 1011.68] oh my god
[1009.70 - 1014.72] [Music]
[1011.68 - 1016.00] you step on a bear trap and you now got
[1014.72 - 1018.24] a cage
[1016.00 - 1021.28] going like this on your ankle
[1018.24 - 1023.20] and you can see the light on the outside
[1021.28 - 1024.88] of the woods but you can't get to the
[1023.20 - 1026.00] other side of the woods you can't get
[1024.88 - 1029.28] there
[1026.00 - 1031.84] because the the bear trap
[1029.28 - 1034.80] is crushing your leg and keeping you in
[1031.84 - 1038.56] the woods for another two years
[1034.80 - 1040.00] another three years another four years
[1038.56 - 1042.32] right
[1040.00 - 1044.72] so the bear traps are laid out there
[1042.32 - 1047.04] some are harmless like chlorophyll drops
[1044.72 - 1048.96] which won't get you better but it won't
[1047.04 - 1050.40] hurt you that bad unless it's an alcohol
[1048.96 - 1052.40] or some other garbage and then it can
[1050.40 - 1054.48] hurt you but so just takes me to the
[1052.40 - 1056.40] next level here fear-mongering let's go
[1054.48 - 1058.64] into that right now
[1056.40 - 1062.00] so every now and then i'll see a comment
[1058.64 - 1063.36] from a hater or a naysayer right or
[1062.00 - 1064.80] somebody from the medical medium hate
[1063.36 - 1066.88] groups because there's a ton of them out
[1064.80 - 1067.84] there they just love to hate on somebody
[1066.88 - 1070.00] and
[1067.84 - 1072.00] the kick kick me sign on my back really
[1070.00 - 1073.92] you know is a great place to just you
[1072.00 - 1076.72] know kick
[1073.92 - 1079.04] but what people don't realize is that
[1076.72 - 1080.72] it's not about fear-mongering
[1079.04 - 1081.76] because i'll see somebody say that one
[1080.72 - 1084.72] time
[1081.76 - 1086.56] it's about saving lives if you're not
[1084.72 - 1089.04] sick
[1086.56 - 1091.44] you can play in that game for a while
[1089.04 - 1093.04] until you get really sick so you can do
[1091.44 - 1096.48] the chlorella
[1093.04 - 1098.96] and the fulvic acid and the shilajit
[1096.48 - 1100.32] doctor friend of mine calls it shallot
[1098.96 - 1102.72] and you can do
[1100.32 - 1104.72] all of these things and don't realize
[1102.72 - 1107.04] though right
[1104.72 - 1110.40] don't realize because you're not so sick
[1107.04 - 1113.92] you don't realize that the coffee enemas
[1110.40 - 1116.88] and the chocolate cacao 90 bars and 74
[1113.92 - 1118.40] bars and cacao powder in your smoothies
[1116.88 - 1119.92] you don't realize in the apple cider
[1118.40 - 1121.44] vinegar and the diatomaceous earth
[1119.92 - 1123.20] particles right
[1121.44 - 1125.68] and then you don't realize the pearl
[1123.20 - 1128.48] powder and
[1125.68 - 1131.76] right and dousing mct oil you don't
[1128.48 - 1134.16] realize that this is hurting more than
[1131.76 - 1136.16] helping because you're not that sick yet
[1134.16 - 1137.76] so the scale isn't really tipping you
[1136.16 - 1140.40] can't tell what the coffee animals are
[1137.76 - 1141.20] doing quite yet
[1140.40 - 1143.04] so
[1141.20 - 1145.36] those people might be like well fear
[1143.04 - 1146.72] mongering i do my coffee enemas and i'm
[1145.36 - 1148.08] fine yeah
[1146.72 - 1149.44] when someone's on mattress island
[1148.08 - 1151.60] they're really sick and they got real
[1149.44 - 1154.00] fatigue real problems serious brain fog
[1151.60 - 1155.52] they do coffee enema and they're trashed
[1154.00 - 1158.48] trashed so i don't call it
[1155.52 - 1160.00] fear-mongering i call it saving lives i
[1158.48 - 1161.60] call it critical information it's just
[1160.00 - 1162.84] that people who aren't sick enough yet
[1161.60 - 1165.76] or aren't sick at
[1162.84 - 1169.12] all they're just
[1165.76 - 1171.52] ignorant to the information right
[1169.12 - 1172.32] laura tong from youtube says michelle l
[1171.52 - 1174.96] i'm
[1172.32 - 1176.96] seizure free for many months now just
[1174.96 - 1178.48] bought a few bemorgy products i'm
[1176.96 - 1181.76] healing
[1178.48 - 1182.96] incredible incredible
[1181.76 - 1185.12] incredible
[1182.96 - 1185.12] so
[1186.40 - 1191.52] you know you want to know if you're
[1188.32 - 1194.00] going to fall into a tiger snare
[1191.52 - 1196.00] and there's jagged
[1194.00 - 1198.24] wooden sticks that have been carved to a
[1196.00 - 1200.00] point down at the bottom of the hole and
[1198.24 - 1202.08] you want to know if you're going to go
[1200.00 - 1205.12] down in that you call that fear monitor
[1202.08 - 1208.16] i call it like dude i just i'm trying to
[1205.12 - 1209.36] stop you from messing yourself up really
[1208.16 - 1213.12] bad
[1209.36 - 1213.12] so you have a shot to heal
[1213.44 - 1216.64] so you have a shot to heal
[1216.72 - 1221.04] if you're really sick you feel that
[1218.88 - 1222.80] scale tip really quick
[1221.04 - 1226.48] that coffee enema is one last coffee
[1222.80 - 1228.56] enema before you're really screwed up
[1226.48 - 1229.60] same thing with air fresheners
[1228.56 - 1231.28] people will be like oh he's
[1229.60 - 1233.28] fear-mongering about air fresheners
[1231.28 - 1235.04] they're wondering about it
[1233.28 - 1237.04] critical to make sure you pull those air
[1235.04 - 1239.68] fresheners out of those walls and you
[1237.04 - 1241.68] throw them out that's critical that you
[1239.68 - 1242.96] take those and you throw those babies
[1241.68 - 1244.32] out
[1242.96 - 1246.24] because those air fresheners are
[1244.32 - 1248.16] poisoning you and they will drop your
[1246.24 - 1251.28] immune system down and they will fill
[1248.16 - 1253.84] you with toxic heavy metals and
[1251.28 - 1256.16] it's about protection
[1253.84 - 1258.48] because guess what prime example if
[1256.16 - 1260.48] someone says oh classic aw fear
[1258.48 - 1262.24] mongering
[1260.48 - 1263.60] how about this you don't know what it's
[1262.24 - 1264.88] like to be sick you don't know what it's
[1263.60 - 1266.40] like to be kicked down you don't know
[1264.88 - 1267.84] what it's like to be really sick going
[1266.40 - 1269.28] to too many specialists you don't know
[1267.84 - 1270.80] what it's like to spend
[1269.28 - 1273.12] tens of thousands and thousands of
[1270.80 - 1274.80] dollars on all kinds of tests you don't
[1273.12 - 1276.96] know when it's real what it's like to
[1274.80 - 1278.96] get blood tests after a blood test after
[1276.96 - 1279.92] blood test after blood test after blood
[1278.96 - 1281.20] test
[1279.92 - 1284.40] and then
[1281.20 - 1286.80] over and over again oh sorry the blood
[1284.40 - 1288.80] work was another 1200 oh sorry blood
[1286.80 - 1292.80] work was another 700 oh you got your
[1288.80 - 1292.80] copay you got your health insurance
[1293.28 - 1296.96] what people don't realize is there's
[1295.36 - 1298.64] this tipping scale
[1296.96 - 1301.92] so healing
[1298.64 - 1304.32] isn't just doing things right it's
[1301.92 - 1306.08] making sure you don't do some of these
[1304.32 - 1309.04] things wrong i've always said to
[1306.08 - 1311.44] alkaline ionizer water machines
[1309.04 - 1313.60] will make you mental it will take you
[1311.44 - 1315.76] down a terrible path and it does to
[1313.60 - 1318.88] people they don't know for a while and
[1315.76 - 1321.12] then those metals get to the brain
[1318.88 - 1323.04] because the metal plates
[1321.12 - 1324.48] no one realizes it but the metal plates
[1323.04 - 1326.08] are corroding and that's highly
[1324.48 - 1328.00] corrosive material
[1326.08 - 1331.04] and then they end up where they can't
[1328.00 - 1333.12] even talk their tongues won't even work
[1331.04 - 1335.28] things go wrong with them
[1333.12 - 1336.96] and their tongue won't even work
[1335.28 - 1338.48] and they get these crazy neurological
[1336.96 - 1340.00] symptoms in vegas their problems and
[1338.48 - 1342.08] they go downhill and they never knew
[1340.00 - 1344.48] because no one ever said no one ever
[1342.08 - 1346.40] said stay away from the alkaline ionizer
[1344.48 - 1347.92] water machines where no one ever said

[1396.96 - 1401.12] protect each other
[1399.44 - 1402.72] and i think that's why the medical
[1401.12 - 1405.76] medium community
[1402.72 - 1407.84] gets picked on so much too
[1405.76 - 1409.52] because you guys are the salt of the
[1407.84 - 1411.44] earth

[1414.80 - 1420.48] you get the more crap you get

[1529.20 - 1532.72] a very very healing herb
[1531.36 - 1534.80] right
[1532.72 - 1538.24] so let's go into the healing process
[1534.80 - 1540.64] it's not just about doing things right
[1538.24 - 1542.80] it's about looking out for what we could
[1540.64 - 1545.28] be doing wrong
[1542.80 - 1546.24] no one's to blame meaning you're not to
[1545.28 - 1548.72] blame
[1546.24 - 1550.24] if you've been pulled into a coffee
[1548.72 - 1552.00] enema
[1550.24 - 1553.60] told you should be eating lots of cacao
[1552.00 - 1555.36] powder
[1553.60 - 1556.48] which blows out your adrenals and
[1555.36 - 1558.16] nervous system
[1556.48 - 1559.36] told to be doing apple cider vinegar
[1558.16 - 1561.28] shots
[1559.36 - 1563.76] told to be doing charcoal told to be
[1561.28 - 1564.80] doing fulvic acid totally doing fulvic
[1563.76 - 1567.84] minerals
[1564.80 - 1570.48] told to be doing shilajit
[1567.84 - 1572.88] now i'm not here to rip all those down
[1570.48 - 1574.40] i'm just saying been there done that
[1572.88 - 1576.48] most people who have been through the
[1574.40 - 1578.16] healing process they tried all that
[1576.48 - 1579.52] they've been sucked into each one and
[1578.16 - 1581.28] then they're sucked into the next one
[1579.52 - 1583.84] and the next one and don't get tricked
[1581.28 - 1585.60] by the pearl powder people now
[1583.84 - 1587.60] because the pearl powder people are
[1585.60 - 1589.12] drinking celery juice and then they're
[1587.60 - 1590.16] selling their pearl powder like as if
[1589.12 - 1591.44] that's helping but they're drinking
[1590.16 - 1592.72] their celery juice take their celery
[1591.44 - 1594.56] juice away
[1592.72 - 1596.88] and they're taking their zinc their b12
[1594.56 - 1598.16] medical medium tools zinc b12 they're
[1596.88 - 1599.76] drinking their celery juice and they're
[1598.16 - 1601.92] like oh by the way i'm not going to show
[1599.76 - 1604.48] you that but let me show you this pearl
[1601.92 - 1606.72] powder right here oh my god this pearl
[1604.48 - 1608.64] powder will make your skin so nice and
[1606.72 - 1610.48] so great you'll look incredible you lose
[1608.64 - 1613.04] all your weight even though i'm on the
[1610.48 - 1616.24] treadmill for two hours a day i'm on my
[1613.04 - 1618.64] peloton for two hours a day um yeah and
[1616.24 - 1620.72] uh never been sick i've never been sick
[1618.64 - 1622.24] but this is a great scam i'm gonna show
[1620.72 - 1624.48] you this is jogger by the way i'm gonna
[1622.24 - 1625.92] show you my pearl powder
[1624.48 - 1628.32] right meanwhile i'm going to drink my
[1625.92 - 1630.00] celery juice did not talk about that
[1628.32 - 1631.52] don't get sucked in by that pearl powder
[1630.00 - 1633.84] the stuff cakes on the inside of the
[1631.52 - 1635.92] linings and it does damage the ins
[1633.84 - 1640.16] inside the linings the testing track
[1635.92 - 1642.40] which scars the linings over time
[1640.16 - 1645.12] venom sweet says thank you for all you

[1652.48 - 1657.12] and you know it's incredible incredible
[1655.04 - 1658.32] community people that actually care
[1657.12 - 1659.92] about others
[1658.32 - 1661.92] and that's the thing and you know what
[1659.92 - 1664.00] happens it gets mistaken like i noticed
[1661.92 - 1666.32] that the medical meme community cares so
[1664.00 - 1670.00] much about other people that when you
[1666.32 - 1672.40] come on there and you say well i just
[1670.00 - 1674.40] you know i'm doing this uh ionizer and
[1672.40 - 1675.92] coffee enema and then somebody in the
[1674.40 - 1677.52] community be like that's not good you
[1675.92 - 1679.12] got to be careful to be like oh you're
[1677.52 - 1681.20] too me and you're too mean
[1679.12 - 1683.52] it's like what it's like no just trying
[1681.20 - 1685.20] to save you deborah says i love your
[1683.52 - 1687.28] newsletter yeah i'm doing these new
[1685.20 - 1688.80] videos on the newsletter you guys every
[1687.28 - 1692.40] sunday
[1688.80 - 1694.24] so it's really it's really fun
[1692.40 - 1697.68] it's medicalmedium.com you can find it
[1694.24 - 1699.12] on there too so let's talk about this
[1697.68 - 1701.84] let's talk about blood draw just for a
[1699.12 - 1701.84] couple of minutes
[1703.20 - 1705.52] okay
[1707.12 - 1711.04] all right so blood draw i want people to
[1709.76 - 1712.64] get their blood test if they want to get
[1711.04 - 1714.96] their blood test
[1712.64 - 1716.24] i like blood tests for people never was
[1714.96 - 1717.68] against it
[1716.24 - 1719.20] what happens is people get too much
[1717.68 - 1721.20] blood drawn
[1719.20 - 1723.52] this can make or break somebody's
[1721.20 - 1727.28] healing process big time
[1723.52 - 1728.24] getting too many vials of blood taken at
[1727.28 - 1731.68] once
[1728.24 - 1734.08] that is a big problem right there okay
[1731.68 - 1736.72] so and what happens is people don't
[1734.08 - 1738.72] realize it
[1736.72 - 1740.96] and these are the small vials people get
[1738.72 - 1742.00] the big tubes people are getting the big
[1740.96 - 1744.40] tubes
[1742.00 - 1747.04] right the doctor will will send some
[1744.40 - 1748.88] blood to the lab or the phlebotomist
[1747.04 - 1750.56] will you know will grab some blood from
[1748.88 - 1753.28] you right
[1750.56 - 1754.72] and it's like okay how many do we have
[1753.28 - 1756.88] right here right
[1754.72 - 1761.28] these are small ones these are like baby
[1756.88 - 1764.16] tubes right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.
[1761.28 - 1765.84] 12 vials of blood right there okay the
[1764.16 - 1768.08] small tubes and they don't take these
[1765.84 - 1770.88] small tubes really
[1768.08 - 1771.84] so what people don't realize is that's
[1770.88 - 1775.52] one
[1771.84 - 1779.12] of the ways we can't heal
[1775.52 - 1781.20] if we're doing the right stuff
[1779.12 - 1784.48] it gets countered
[1781.20 - 1786.00] by doing the wrong stuff
[1784.48 - 1788.40] blood tests are good
[1786.00 - 1790.16] i believe in it but what happens is when
[1788.40 - 1791.68] they keep on drawing too much blood and
[1790.16 - 1793.28] you don't know what to do you don't know
[1791.68 - 1794.56] how to tell the doctor can you please
[1793.28 - 1795.76] just take two
[1794.56 - 1797.52] vials
[1795.76 - 1800.24] and then i'll come back another time and
[1797.52 - 1803.12] you could take another two
[1800.24 - 1804.08] but take two or three vials max at a
[1803.12 - 1805.44] time
[1804.08 - 1807.68] but they'll take no we'll take five
[1805.44 - 1810.08] vials seven files 20 miles 30 vials
[1807.68 - 1811.52] right and they're removing your your
[1810.08 - 1813.28] immune cells
[1811.52 - 1817.04] out of your bloodstream is what happens
[1813.28 - 1819.60] so your immune cells are being sucked up
[1817.04 - 1821.52] and tossed out
[1819.60 - 1823.12] and that's what happens
[1821.52 - 1825.68] then
[1823.12 - 1828.24] the reason why you're at the doctors
[1825.68 - 1830.32] with all your pain and suffering and
[1828.24 - 1832.24] your diagnosis and your autoimmune
[1830.32 - 1835.44] diagnosis and everything else
[1832.24 - 1835.44] because of pathogens
[1835.60 - 1840.96] your immune system is trying to protect
[1838.08 - 1844.16] you from the pathogens
[1840.96 - 1846.24] so it's keeping the pathogens down
[1844.16 - 1848.08] you're still sick because you've got the
[1846.24 - 1849.76] pathogens and you're still sick because
[1848.08 - 1850.72] your immune system is weak
[1849.76 - 1853.04] but then
[1850.72 - 1854.96] we get all these
[1853.04 - 1857.52] orally says i only allow three to five
[1854.96 - 1859.12] vials at a time brilliant
[1857.52 - 1861.36] brilliant
[1859.12 - 1863.60] i tell my friends and family only allow
[1861.36 - 1865.44] two to three vials at a time
[1863.60 - 1868.08] or
[1865.44 - 1869.60] three to five half vials that's what i
[1868.08 - 1871.04] tell my friends and family to do but you
[1869.60 - 1872.72] do whatever you know you want to do and
[1871.04 - 1875.12] your doctor wants to
[1872.72 - 1876.88] so you end up drawing out
[1875.12 - 1878.56] from all the blood work
[1876.88 - 1879.92] the very thing that protects you from
[1878.56 - 1880.80] why you're sick
[1879.92 - 1883.36] and then
[1880.80 - 1885.20] you get sicker a month later could get
[1883.36 - 1886.32] sicker a week later two months later but
[1885.20 - 1887.76] then you've got to go to the doctor
[1886.32 - 1889.28] again
[1887.76 - 1892.88] and then he sends you to a specialist
[1889.28 - 1895.28] and now he's taking this plus way more
[1892.88 - 1897.28] and then the doctor's just gambling away
[1895.28 - 1899.12] your blood right here
[1897.28 - 1900.32] okay i think i got a deck of cards
[1899.12 - 1901.76] sitting over there i think i'm gonna
[1900.32 - 1903.76] grab in a second
[1901.76 - 1905.20] on the table and
[1903.76 - 1906.64] because i think we're gonna
[1905.20 - 1908.00] you know we'll do a little gambling real
[1906.64 - 1910.08] quick
[1908.00 - 1911.68] we'll do a little i don't know we'll get
[1910.08 - 1914.64] some cards out
[1911.68 - 1916.00] we'll have some fun okay
[1914.64 - 1917.44] because
[1916.00 - 1919.52] this is how it works and these cards are
[1917.44 - 1921.68] the cool cards because these are the
[1919.52 - 1923.44] wyman's wild blueberry cards
[1921.68 - 1925.92] you guys this is really cool

[1931.44 - 1935.84] right here right
[1933.04 - 1938.32] so what happens is
[1935.84 - 1940.88] everybody starts to gamble your blood
[1938.32 - 1942.56] away well
[1940.88 - 1944.08] i think we're going to do a couple of
[1942.56 - 1945.52] tests we don't really know what's wrong
[1944.08 - 1947.36] with you
[1945.52 - 1951.04] we don't know really why you're sick we
[1947.36 - 1953.04] just think you got autoimmune

[1970.96 - 1974.96] okay see you later
[1972.56 - 1977.52] lost those four vials come back in a
[1974.96 - 1978.96] couple of weeks i think i'm gonna gamble
[1977.52 - 1981.44] let's do
[1978.96 - 1984.16] do five vials this time right let's see
[1981.44 - 1984.16] what we got here
[1984.96 - 1989.12] that's funny that queen has a b on there
[1989.52 - 1993.52] yeah and that jack has a lumberjack on
[1992.40 - 1995.76] there
[1993.52 - 1997.76] anyway
[1995.76 - 2000.00] these are great cards
[1997.76 - 2002.96] the bottom line is we're gambling with
[2000.00 - 2005.84] our lives and the doctors right
[2002.96 - 2008.96] mistakenly in the blood labs gambling
[2005.84 - 2011.04] your blood away
[2008.96 - 2012.40] for inconclusive tests mostly now i
[2011.04 - 2013.76] believe in blood working you should get
[2012.40 - 2016.24] blood work but you got to be careful
[2013.76 - 2017.92] because they throw the blood away
[2016.24 - 2019.60] and then we go backwards and we go
[2017.92 - 2020.88] backwards right
[2019.60 - 2023.52] i talk about this the medical media
[2020.88 - 2026.32] podcast at apple podcast all the details
[2023.52 - 2028.88] but the bottom line is i'm noticing
[2026.32 - 2031.44] that people forget
[2028.88 - 2033.20] they forget about the blood work thing
[2031.44 - 2034.80] or they never learned it yet the medical
[2033.20 - 2036.80] meme information
[2034.80 - 2038.48] so they come into the community someone
[2036.80 - 2040.32] doesn't remind them about their blood
[2038.48 - 2044.16] work
[2040.32 - 2046.72] and they just got 20 vials pulled
[2044.16 - 2049.04] and now they're online and they're like
[2046.72 - 2050.88] i don't feel good today i'm gonna just
[2049.04 - 2053.04] try something else this celery juice
[2050.88 - 2055.36] made me sick
[2053.04 - 2058.00] not the 20 vials that was taken from a
[2055.36 - 2059.36] specialist eight days ago
[2058.00 - 2063.12] because people don't realize it so their
[2059.36 - 2065.36] immune system is being drawn out of them
[2063.12 - 2067.20] and that's the whole thing lorena says i
[2065.36 - 2068.72] like cards but i don't gamble either do
[2067.20 - 2070.32] i
[2068.72 - 2074.00] look out for thursday i will be
[2070.32 - 2076.32] announcing a special interview i did
[2074.00 - 2078.64] that i will be releasing that will be
[2076.32 - 2080.16] released on thursday
[2078.64 - 2081.84] i won't be releasing it but it did

[2095.76 - 2099.12] there it's not only doing the right
[2097.20 - 2102.08] things get the right b12 instead of the
[2099.12 - 2104.00] b12 that has something bad in it you
[2102.08 - 2106.08] know high quality it's not just doing
[2104.00 - 2108.72] like one b12 it's about methylcobalamin
[2106.08 - 2112.24] dinosaur balance it's about

[2120.40 - 2124.24] right
[2121.20 - 2125.04] vegan epa dha oil
[2124.24 - 2127.84] not
[2125.04 - 2130.24] fish oil these things add up right and
[2127.84 - 2133.04] they add up it's about not doing the
[2130.24 - 2135.12] wrong type of magnesium right
[2133.04 - 2137.36] and then it's about doing
[2135.12 - 2139.12] celery juice and other things and other
[2137.36 - 2141.52] tools and getting metals out that we all
[2139.12 - 2142.88] know that you talk about right and then
