[293.20 - 296.88] give you a little close-up right here
[294.48 - 298.56] when you freeze your bananas
[296.88 - 300.72] what i like to do just a little tip on
[298.56 - 303.20] this freezing banana thing i like to
[300.72 - 305.60] kind of keep them whole when i can so i
[303.20 - 307.28] like to keep them whole like this you
[305.60 - 309.12] know when you freeze them and not freeze
[307.28 - 310.56] them in tiny little pieces you freeze
[309.12 - 312.32] them in tiny little pieces they might
[310.56 - 314.72] brown a little quicker here we go there
[312.32 - 316.00] you if you if it's tiny little pieces
[314.72 - 317.12] but you can't help it that's just going
[316.00 - 318.40] to happen when you're peeling back
[317.12 - 320.40] bananas you're just going to throw
[318.40 - 322.08] whatever you got in there but i just try
[320.40 - 324.00] to like peel them you know the larger
[322.08 - 325.52] pieces you know and throw them in there
[324.00 - 327.44] freeze them you put of course you can
[325.52 - 329.60] use any piece of the banana it's great
[327.44 - 332.16] but that's just a little tip
[329.60 - 334.56] it keeps them from going
[332.16 - 335.68] so brown in the freezer long term when
[334.56 - 338.00] they're sitting in the freezer for a
[335.68 - 340.32] long time you know okay so let's start

[663.28 - 665.92] they're not doing that there's a whole
[664.40 - 667.68] bunch of people in the world that you
[665.92 - 669.36] know that aren't doing that and they're
[667.68 - 670.56] just getting their teeth yanked out left

[677.36 - 681.68] let's do it so
[679.12 - 683.60] here's the next thing we're going to do
[681.68 - 684.56] let's go i'm going to turn the machine
[683.60 - 685.84] on
[684.56 - 687.76] and
[685.84 - 689.20] we'll roll
[687.76 - 690.64] it's a little bit of ice cream left in
[689.20 - 692.48] there i mean you could always take that
[690.64 - 694.08] out if you want but i'm gonna leave it
[692.48 - 697.60] there

[910.72 - 916.08] off you've got to check it out
[913.36 - 919.28] maybe down the road grab one whatever on
[916.08 - 920.24] another sale some some day in the future
[919.28 - 924.00] so
[920.24 - 924.00] i'm gonna do some wheatgrass right now
[924.72 - 928.64] so i have right here
[927.68 - 931.20] the
[928.64 - 932.72] end cap for the wheatgrass
[931.20 - 935.44] which is incredible so let's start
[932.72 - 935.44] running some through
[939.52 - 944.00] now i like wheatgrass
[942.16 - 947.20] sat says can you talk a little bit about
[944.00 - 948.72] wheatgrass juice benefits
[947.20 - 951.28] absolutely you know how everybody's
[948.72 - 952.40] trying to get chlorophyll
[951.28 - 955.04] and they're taking chlorophyll
[952.40 - 957.92] supplements well that's a great mistake
[955.04 - 960.16] when you separate chlorophyll
[957.92 - 962.00] you can't gain anything from it it's
[960.16 - 964.00] destroyed did you guys know that so if
[962.00 - 966.24] you see people doing chlorophyll
[964.00 - 968.80] tinctures it's a sad thing
[966.24 - 972.48] they're being totally taken
[968.80 - 974.80] you cannot separate chlorophyll
[972.48 - 977.92] anything anybody ever said chlorophyll
[974.80 - 980.40] is good for you can't receive when you
[977.92 - 983.12] separate and extract chlorophyll from
[980.40 - 985.04] something and then put it in a tincture
[983.12 - 986.88] very important to know this or put it in
[985.04 - 988.16] a bottle
[986.88 - 989.68] so there's all these people out there
[988.16 - 991.44] that are getting ripped off with the
[989.68 - 992.64] chlorophyll
[991.44 - 994.40] they think it's like great they're
[992.64 - 996.72] making green water they're putting it in
[994.40 - 997.84] the water but it's so sad you you guys
[996.72 - 1000.96] because
[997.84 - 1002.64] you cannot separate and isolate
[1000.96 - 1004.96] chlorophyll because chlorophyll is
[1002.64 - 1006.48] useless when it's isolated because it
[1004.96 - 1007.36] has to have
[1006.48 - 1010.56] other
[1007.36 - 1013.44] chemical compounds in there so anything
[1010.56 - 1017.04] you hear chlorophyll is good for
[1013.44 - 1018.80] you can get it from wheatgrass
[1017.04 - 1020.48] that's how it works
[1018.80 - 1022.16] so
[1020.48 - 1025.04] now the mm
[1022.16 - 1027.28] 900 is known to save you money that's a
[1025.04 - 1029.28] different juicer right the 900 this is
[1027.28 - 1032.80] the 1500 it's known to save you money
[1029.28 - 1036.88] because it's got that celery end cap
[1032.80 - 1040.56] well i'm using that end cap right here
[1036.88 - 1043.44] on the 1500 so i'm juicing really
[1040.56 - 1045.68] extracting from this wheatgrass
[1043.44 - 1047.80] other juicers can't extract from the
[1045.68 - 1050.24] wheatgrass like this juicer can the
[1047.80 - 1051.52] mm-1500 so this is important to know
[1050.24 - 1054.24] like you can't
[1051.52 - 1056.40] you can't extract this kind of um
[1054.24 - 1059.20] wheatgrass juice from other juicers i
[1056.40 - 1063.12] know i've seen it out there
[1059.20 - 1063.12] and and so this is yeah
[1065.28 - 1069.76] so back to chlorophyll if you want to
[1067.20 - 1071.44] know benefits in wheatgrass
[1069.76 - 1074.24] it's everything
[1071.44 - 1076.08] they say chlorophyll is good for but you
[1074.24 - 1078.64] can't get any of the benefits when you
[1076.08 - 1082.24] take chlorophyll by itself you can't get
[1078.64 - 1082.24] the benefits it's not going to happen
[1082.56 - 1086.72] they destroy chlorophyll when they
[1084.32 - 1088.88] extract it
[1086.72 - 1091.20] and so everybody's taken for a ride i
[1088.88 - 1093.20] thought wheatgrass was bad for you kathy
[1091.20 - 1095.92] got together no i never said wheatgrass
[1093.20 - 1095.92] so bad for you
[1098.08 - 1102.00] i i said wheat's bad for you
[1104.08 - 1110.24] yeah wheat's bad for you
[1107.12 - 1111.68] so all right so i'm making a wheatgrass
[1110.24 - 1114.64] shot right now so i'm dropping some
[1111.68 - 1114.64] wheatgrass in here
[1115.86 - 1118.72] [Applause]
[1117.20 - 1120.16] so what i'll i'll show you how this
[1118.72 - 1121.76] works a little bit i probably have
[1120.16 - 1123.44] plenty
[1121.76 - 1126.88] for a shot right now but i'm just
[1123.44 - 1126.88] running a little bit more through
[1127.20 - 1133.48] so you guys just got on here i'm making
[1129.20 - 1133.48] some wheatgrass i'm using the mm-1500
[1135.52 - 1140.56] okay i'm using i'm doing the wheatgrass
[1138.72 - 1141.92] part of it this tractor wait till i show
[1140.56 - 1143.12] you what i have right here i can't wait
[1141.92 - 1147.20] to show you how this works this is
[1143.12 - 1147.20] what's incredible about the 1500
[1147.28 - 1149.20] okay
[1148.24 - 1152.88] so
[1149.20 - 1152.88] maybe i'll run a little bit more through
[1153.28 - 1161.80] now other machines won't extract as much
[1156.96 - 1161.80] juice in my opinion they just won't
[1164.48 - 1167.68] okay
[1166.56 - 1169.84] yep
[1167.68 - 1171.44] the pulp is dry
[1169.84 - 1174.48] now i just want to tell you guys the
[1171.44 - 1174.48] pulp is dry
[1176.88 - 1181.28] do a little bit more
[1179.68 - 1185.44] a little bit at a time i'm not trying to
[1181.28 - 1185.44] shove it all in in one shot so
[1185.84 - 1190.56] letting it take its time here we go
[1188.48 - 1193.04] does this model extract more celery
[1190.56 - 1195.04] juice it extracts just as much celery
[1193.04 - 1198.40] juice
[1195.04 - 1199.92] as the 900 so yeah so that's what's
[1198.40 - 1201.44] incredible
[1199.92 - 1204.16] all right so here i want to show you
[1201.44 - 1206.72] guys this all right this is really cool
[1204.16 - 1209.44] so we'll get a close-up on this
[1206.72 - 1212.48] you're looking at the pulp in here
[1209.44 - 1215.20] you're looking at how dry the pulp is
[1212.48 - 1218.16] the wheatgrass pulp right
[1215.20 - 1221.92] other juicers they don't do that
[1218.16 - 1223.68] from what i've i've looked for and tried
[1221.92 - 1227.52] and so when you're dealing with the mm
[1223.68 - 1229.28] 1500 or like the other mm-900 that's the
[1227.52 - 1231.12] whole thing because
[1229.28 - 1232.40] it would have taken so much more
[1231.12 - 1234.16] wheatgrass i'm showing you the
[1232.40 - 1237.28] wheatgrass in this bowl it would have
[1234.16 - 1238.72] taken all that plus way more to just
[1237.28 - 1240.72] make what's right there when you're
[1238.72 - 1242.32] using a lot of juicers out there so
[1240.72 - 1244.88] that's incredible so you're looking at
[1242.32 - 1246.56] dry pulp right here
[1244.88 - 1248.08] and and that's what's incredible about
[1246.56 - 1250.08] that right there so this is the wheat
[1248.08 - 1252.40] grass part of it if you guys just got on
[1250.08 - 1255.28] here i just did the ice cream part i

[1324.64 - 1327.92] strainer on top of it i'll show you this
[1326.48 - 1330.16] which is incredible about the juicer the
[1327.92 - 1332.24] mm-1500 it's got its own little strainer
[1330.16 - 1333.52] goes right over that which is really
[1332.24 - 1335.12] cool
[1333.52 - 1336.48] let's get a shot glass of wheatgrass
[1335.12 - 1338.64] going here
[1336.48 - 1339.68] this is going to be good
[1338.64 - 1342.80] okay
[1339.68 - 1342.80] so let's pour this in
[1343.60 - 1347.84] yeah
[1345.52 - 1351.44] can do we can make it a little higher
[1347.84 - 1352.64] that's some strong stuff right there
[1351.44 - 1355.52] uh-huh
[1352.64 - 1358.48] that's definitely some strong stuff
[1355.52 - 1358.48] got some wheatgrass
[1359.36 - 1363.12] i might have to take a little shot right
[1360.96 - 1363.12] here
[1364.64 - 1367.60] if you guys if you've ever done
[1366.00 - 1370.16] wheatgrass
[1367.60 - 1372.32] it's like it tastes salty and sweet and
[1370.16 - 1374.00] then it kicks you
[1372.32 - 1376.72] and then it kicks you at the same time
[1374.00 - 1380.48] right you're just like what
[1376.72 - 1380.48] oh yeah this is salty and sweet yeah
[1383.84 - 1387.60] mark james says do you cook the yams
[1385.52 - 1389.76] first yes you steam them
[1387.60 - 1392.40] i steam the yams first okay
[1389.76 - 1394.40] so that's my wheatgrass shot right there
[1392.40 - 1396.00] the machine squeezes
[1394.40 - 1399.20] the crap
[1396.00 - 1401.12] out of that grass okay you guys just got
[1399.20 - 1402.40] on here
[1401.12 - 1404.00] i'm talking about wheatgrass i'm not
[1402.40 - 1405.68] talking about the other grass think
[1404.00 - 1406.96] about wheatgrass
[1405.68 - 1409.52] right
[1406.96 - 1411.20] so that's it nice and dry the pulp
[1409.52 - 1413.36] i was just showing you that's what the
[1411.20 - 1415.44] mm-15 it's already drying up that fast
[1413.36 - 1417.68] right now that's what the mm 1500 that's
[1415.44 - 1420.40] what it does it's got the celery end cap
[1417.68 - 1421.68] it's got that killer end cap on it
[1420.40 - 1425.04] that's the end cap right here i'm
[1421.68 - 1425.92] showing you guys that's it
[1425.04 - 1427.84] and
[1425.92 - 1429.68] this look how dry that is
[1427.84 - 1431.84] it's just it's incredible really and
[1429.68 - 1433.36] then i'm squeezing every last bit out of
[1431.84 - 1435.28] that wheat grass right there you guys
[1433.36 - 1438.16] see on tic tac
[1435.28 - 1440.16] that's my wheatgrass shot right there
[1438.16 - 1442.80] wheatgrass is really powerful it's
[1440.16 - 1444.96] incredible now this is a bigger machine
[1442.80 - 1447.60] it's capable of doing a lot this is not
[1444.96 - 1449.12] like the 900 the 900 is a celery juicer
[1447.60 - 1450.80] you can put other stuff like some leafy
[1449.12 - 1451.84] greens through there and everything like
[1450.80 - 1454.88] i've showed you
[1451.84 - 1457.44] but the mm-900 which is incredible isn't
[1454.88 - 1459.28] a nutritional system of nut butters and
[1457.44 - 1461.84] nut milks and
[1459.28 - 1463.92] and baby food and ice cream
[1461.84 - 1466.56] that's an entirely different situation
[1463.92 - 1468.32] so this is the mm-1500 but the mm-1500
[1466.56 - 1470.48] does celery too
[1468.32 - 1472.40] it also does the celery too which is
[1470.48 - 1474.72] really incredible and then it does the
[1472.40 - 1477.12] wheatgrass the celery and it really
[1474.72 - 1478.88] squeezes it dry which is cool
[1477.12 - 1480.40] here's the thing
[1478.88 - 1482.96] a lot of people requested this this is
[1480.40 - 1484.80] what they requested so so yeah i want to
[1482.96 - 1489.36] deliver here's the thing to understand
[1484.80 - 1491.76] about why i like bmm 1500 and 900 right
[1489.36 - 1493.84] food costs are going up we know that
[1491.76 - 1495.28] we know food costs are going up
[1493.84 - 1497.92] so
[1495.28 - 1499.60] if you're going to use a weapon to heal
[1497.92 - 1501.60] like you know this is like a medical
[1499.60 - 1504.08] machine i've called i've called these
[1501.60 - 1505.20] juicers the mm1500 the mm-900 have
[1504.08 - 1506.72] called those
[1505.20 - 1508.96] that's what they are medical device
[1506.72 - 1510.80] right because that's what they are
[1508.96 - 1512.32] i'd rather be on this medical device
[1510.80 - 1514.16] here than hooked up at like in the
[1512.32 - 1515.36] hospital like feed
[1514.16 - 1516.72] me
[1515.36 - 1517.44] me nurse
[1516.72 - 1520.08] b
[1517.44 - 1521.44] nurse my medication
[1520.08 - 1524.32] i'd rather be
[1521.44 - 1526.40] on this machine right here so
[1524.32 - 1528.72] and so what i like about this machine it
[1526.40 - 1530.80] saves me money every time i run
[1528.72 - 1532.24] something through it because it squeezes
[1530.80 - 1534.08] the hell out of it when you're running
[1532.24 - 1535.44] stuff through it like for instance like
[1534.08 - 1537.12] the wheatgrass
[1535.44 - 1539.92] so you get more out of there and i like
[1537.12 - 1542.80] that i like knowing i'm saving when
[1539.92 - 1544.56] you know things are happening so
[1542.80 - 1548.96] sounds like we should have waited for
[1544.56 - 1551.92] the 1500 robin actually no the the 1500
[1548.96 - 1552.80] 1500 is for like all that other stuff
[1551.92 - 1555.68] right
[1552.80 - 1557.52] the 900 yeah i mean you got the 900 i
[1555.68 - 1559.36] got the 900 i use the knife i take the
[1557.52 - 1560.64] 900 out but then i'm like you know what
[1559.36 - 1562.32] i want to make a sorbet i want to make
[1560.64 - 1564.96] an ice cream
[1562.32 - 1568.32] so then boom i bring the 1500 out but
[1564.96 - 1570.08] yeah the 1500's got so much going on
[1568.32 - 1572.16] but you know it takes time for like
[1570.08 - 1573.76] developments like to to make things
[1572.16 - 1576.00] better and better it's not that it's
[1573.76 - 1578.32] better than the 900 it's not it just
[1576.00 - 1580.32] offers other things
[1578.32 - 1583.44] which is really cool offers other things
[1580.32 - 1585.12] it's a whole complete nutritional system
[1583.44 - 1586.72] which is great
[1585.12 - 1588.40] all right so
[1586.72 - 1591.68] what are we doing next we're going to
[1588.40 - 1595.20] make a restaurant style salsa that's
[1591.68 - 1595.20] coming up now so let's do it
[1597.12 - 1600.32] very excited about this
[1602.24 - 1606.88] you guys like salsa
[1604.48 - 1609.60] what i really love too is i'm going to
[1606.88 - 1611.84] tell you right now which is really cool
[1609.60 - 1613.84] about
[1611.84 - 1615.44] which is really cool is people eat salsa
[1613.84 - 1617.20] all the time right and when they eat
[1615.44 - 1619.20] salsa all the time
[1617.20 - 1621.12] they're eating the kind of salsa that
[1619.20 - 1622.24] has vinegar in it so that's the sauce
[1621.12 - 1624.96] that they're eating they're eating the
[1622.24 - 1628.08] vinegar salsa is what they're doing and
[1624.96 - 1629.92] the thing is with that is that
[1628.08 - 1631.52] how much vinegar can you eat it's really
[1629.92 - 1633.36] bad you lose your teeth down the road
[1631.52 - 1636.16] because of the vinegar that happens all
[1633.36 - 1638.32] the time so i'm not a big salsa out of a
[1636.16 - 1640.32] jar unless it's vinegar free you know
[1638.32 - 1642.32] what i mean so i'm not a big salsa out
[1640.32 - 1644.24] of the jar kind of person at all so i
[1642.32 - 1648.16] got my salsa
[1644.24 - 1648.16] little clip in here all right
[1648.24 - 1653.48] and that's next
[1650.08 - 1653.48] let's do it
[1658.00 - 1660.24] so
[1660.48 - 1664.08] a couple of ways you can do salsa which
[1662.24 - 1666.88] is really cool tara appleman he's not
[1664.08 - 1668.72] against animal protein correct just
[1666.88 - 1671.68] providing the information needed to heal
[1668.72 - 1674.32] whether you eat animal protein or not
[1671.68 - 1676.72] it's so true it's it's why a big part of
[1674.32 - 1679.04] the vegan community hates medical medium
[1676.72 - 1680.80] like hates on medical medium it doesn't
[1679.04 - 1682.16] matter how many people heal from medical
[1680.80 - 1683.76] medium doesn't matter how many people
[1682.16 - 1686.00] get their lives back does it matter if
[1683.76 - 1687.76] i'm a chronic illness for 35 years
[1686.00 - 1689.12] doesn't matter if i teach doctors in
[1687.76 - 1690.64] some of the biggest most prestigious
[1689.12 - 1692.72] clinics around the country and around
[1690.64 - 1694.64] the world about about things like what
[1692.72 - 1696.48] causes all these diseases and symptoms
[1694.64 - 1699.60] none of that matters to some of the
[1696.48 - 1700.88] vegans which you know i we have vegans
[1699.60 - 1702.72] here too in the medical meme community
[1700.88 - 1704.64] but there's a lot of vegans that hate on
[1702.72 - 1707.28] medical medium because
[1704.64 - 1709.84] i won't do this whole protest
[1707.28 - 1711.52] this big protest against animal
[1709.84 - 1713.44] people who eat animal protein like i
[1711.52 - 1715.12] won't hate on people who eat animal
[1713.44 - 1717.28] protein so i guess there's a big part of
[1715.12 - 1720.24] the vegan community that wants me
[1717.28 - 1722.64] to join in and start like throwing
[1720.24 - 1724.32] daggers at people who eat animal protein
[1722.64 - 1726.32] and hurt their feelings and tell them
[1724.32 - 1727.44] how they're doing terrible things and
[1726.32 - 1729.28] there's a big part of the vegan
[1727.44 - 1730.48] community that wants me to do that and
[1729.28 - 1733.28] because
[1730.48 - 1735.44] because i don't they'll say oh he's just
[1733.28 - 1737.04] a fruit and vegetable guy or he doesn't
[1735.44 - 1738.72] know anything meanwhile people are
[1737.04 - 1741.36] walking out of their wheelchairs because
[1738.72 - 1743.28] of medical medium information so yeah so
[1741.36 - 1746.40] absolutely i support people who eat
[1743.28 - 1748.00] animal protein 100 and animal protein
[1746.40 - 1749.84] isn't isn't necessarily the thing that
[1748.00 - 1751.60] holds people back from healing if you
[1749.84 - 1753.28] want to eat animal protein you can be
[1751.60 - 1755.36] vegan too and plant-based i love
[1753.28 - 1757.36] plant-based foods i love plant-based the
[1755.36 - 1759.44] plant-based
[1757.36 - 1761.68] angle and people on plant-based all of
[1759.44 - 1765.72] it everybody knows that okay so let's go
[1761.68 - 1765.72] we're going to make some salsa here
[1766.00 - 1770.40] let's go
[1768.16 - 1770.40] so
[1770.56 - 1774.32] we're going to do a little bit of salsa
[1772.08 - 1775.60] here
[1774.32 - 1777.36] there we go
[1775.60 - 1778.96] i think i just should get that all
[1777.36 - 1780.08] squared away
[1778.96 - 1782.96] so what i'm gonna do is drop some
[1780.08 - 1782.96] tomatoes in here
[1788.72 - 1792.88] so i'm making a salsa right now if you
[1791.12 - 1794.48] guys want to know now what's really cool
[1792.88 - 1796.88] about the salsa
[1794.48 - 1799.04] just so you know
[1796.88 - 1801.20] is this salsa
[1799.04 - 1803.76] is vinegar free
[1801.20 - 1805.76] this salsa is raw too
[1803.76 - 1808.16] so it's a raw salsa
[1805.76 - 1811.28] which is great
[1808.16 - 1815.52] so i'm dropping tomato in right now okay
[1811.28 - 1818.16] now this is a restaurant style salsa
[1815.52 - 1818.16] first of all
[1818.72 - 1823.84] if you taste this salsa
[1821.76 - 1826.32] without vinegar
[1823.84 - 1828.40] and all that heavy duty salt like
[1826.32 - 1830.88] basically they just throw a ton of road
[1828.40 - 1833.20] salt in salsa
[1830.88 - 1835.12] and they just vinegar it to death
[1833.20 - 1838.08] and
[1835.12 - 1841.20] that's not the kind of salsa that i like
[1838.08 - 1841.20] it just isn't you know
[1842.64 - 1846.96] so i'm doing is
[1844.48 - 1849.68] i'm dropping some onion in here the link
[1846.96 - 1851.36] is in the description this is the 1500
[1849.68 - 1852.96] i'm making a homemade salsa but a
[1851.36 - 1854.88] restaurant style
[1852.96 - 1856.56] is what i'm doing i'm dropping some
[1854.88 - 1858.40] onion in here i don't know if you guys
[1856.56 - 1859.92] like onion
[1858.40 - 1862.96] this is kind of like the sweet onion
[1859.92 - 1866.16] that's what i really like right
[1862.96 - 1867.68] okay so i'm dropping tomato in here i
[1866.16 - 1870.24] put
[1867.68 - 1872.08] a lime in here too you guys i just threw
[1870.24 - 1873.68] a lime in there you know without the
[1872.08 - 1876.48] peel so i just threw a lime in there
[1873.68 - 1876.48] without the peel
[1876.72 - 1880.32] right
[1877.60 - 1882.16] i got a little bit of cilantro i'm gonna
[1880.32 - 1886.08] throw in here too i'm gonna pop that in
[1882.16 - 1886.08] right now a little bit of cilantro
[1886.96 - 1889.68] putting that in
[1891.44 - 1895.28] so i'm just really excited about this
[1896.08 - 1900.16] i'm gonna drop in some more tomato
[1901.68 - 1906.36] and i'll show you how i do this this is
[1903.12 - 1906.36] so great
[1909.36 - 1912.88] there we go
[1911.68 - 1915.92] onion fan
[1912.88 - 1918.56] lorraine you're an onion fan
[1915.92 - 1918.56] who would have known
[1918.72 - 1921.84] who would have known
[1922.00 - 1925.20] there's a lot of people that don't like
[1923.36 - 1929.28] onion people like no i can't eat that
[1925.20 - 1929.28] like why it's got an onion in it
[1930.24 - 1934.72] so i'm dropping some jalapeno in there
[1932.56 - 1937.04] now that's what i'm doing so i just
[1934.72 - 1938.64] dropped a little bit of some jalapeno in
[1937.04 - 1940.48] there
[1938.64 - 1943.04] some more onion
[1940.48 - 1945.28] some more tomato
[1943.04 - 1945.28] right
[1945.84 - 1949.16] there we go
[1953.04 - 1956.64] so this is great what you do is you'll
[1954.96 - 1957.68] scoop off off the top a little bit
[1956.64 - 1960.40] because you'll
[1957.68 - 1961.84] the tomato juice is all on the top there
[1960.40 - 1964.40] so you gotta kind of give it a little
[1961.84 - 1967.04] chance to get down there moving right
[1964.40 - 1967.04] which is great
[1967.52 - 1970.00] there you go
[1970.24 - 1974.24] incredible

[2334.24 - 2341.84] this is what i love about the mm 1500
[2338.08 - 2341.84] because i'm making a walnut milk
[2342.96 - 2346.24] i'm not buying the walnut milk at the

[2346.24 - 2350.08] i'm not doing that where i'm all of a
[2347.92 - 2354.28] sudden buying you know the walnut milk

[2375.84 - 2382.28] like this i like to soak them overnight
[2379.28 - 2382.28] right
[2386.48 - 2392.24] and when you soak them overnight
[2389.36 - 2394.32] they almost start to sprout so you have
[2392.24 - 2395.36] to know that even if you don't see a
[2394.32 - 2396.48] sprout
[2395.36 - 2399.12] they're actually

[2825.68 - 2830.16] it's like sticks of butter
[2827.60 - 2832.00] but walnut butter which is incredible if
[2830.16 - 2833.28] you guys take a look on tik tok you guys
[2832.00 - 2835.12] can see this
[2833.28 - 2837.12] i know you guys don't have that probably
[2835.12 - 2838.16] that camera close up telegram you guys
[2837.12 - 2840.24] see this
[2838.16 - 2841.44] right so this is a walnut butter right
[2840.24 - 2844.56] there
[2841.44 - 2846.00] now i want to drop a bomb this is going
[2844.56 - 2847.12] to be good right here this is
[2846.00 - 2849.36] interesting
[2847.12 - 2849.36] okay
[2849.76 - 2852.80] here's what happens when you buy your
[2851.12 - 2854.56] nut butters out there here's what
[2852.80 - 2856.32] happens when you buy all the different
[2854.56 - 2859.12] nut butters the peanut butter the almond
[2856.32 - 2861.44] butter the cashew butter the tahini the
[2859.12 - 2863.52] pumpkin seed butter hemp seed butter
[2861.44 - 2866.08] they add oil
[2863.52 - 2867.52] they add oil
[2866.08 - 2869.76] that's what they do
[2867.52 - 2871.52] so what you're doing is you're getting a
[2869.76 - 2873.12] jar
[2871.52 - 2876.08] of oil
[2873.12 - 2877.92] they add it into it
[2876.08 - 2881.12] that's what they do
[2877.92 - 2883.04] so they add it into it so that's
[2881.12 - 2884.96] important to know now here's the
[2883.04 - 2887.52] difference right here
[2884.96 - 2890.40] this nut butter
[2887.52 - 2893.28] someone didn't remove
[2890.40 - 2894.72] half of the nut butter
[2893.28 - 2897.04] and then added
[2894.72 - 2898.56] a quart of oil
[2897.04 - 2899.44] even though it's not a quart of oil
[2898.56 - 2901.92] right
[2899.44 - 2904.32] in a jar obviously you know that
[2901.92 - 2905.76] but that's what they do you get less nut
[2904.32 - 2909.04] butter
[2905.76 - 2911.60] and then they add all this oil into it
[2909.04 - 2913.84] that's the game that's the nature of the
[2911.60 - 2915.36] game with all the nut butters still you
[2913.84 - 2916.80] can buy your nut butter of course you
[2915.36 - 2918.40] buy your almond butter and all these
[2916.80 - 2919.84] others definitely
[2918.40 - 2920.64] right
[2919.84 - 2922.88] now
[2920.64 - 2924.72] the walnuts were not soaked i didn't
[2922.88 - 2925.60] soak them overnight to make the nut
[2924.72 - 2926.88] butter
[2925.60 - 2928.96] you don't have to soak them overnight
[2926.88 - 2930.48] you can rinse them though so you can
[2928.96 - 2932.00] give them a rinse
[2930.48 - 2934.32] when you make your nut butter you could
[2932.00 - 2936.64] rinse your walnuts you can rinse your
[2934.32 - 2940.24] cashews you can rinse your almonds right
[2936.64 - 2943.12] you can rinse them okay
[2940.24 - 2945.44] but i i didn't soak them but you can
[2943.12 - 2947.52] give them a rinse to get like the dust
[2945.44 - 2950.16] off and stuff like that you can do that
[2947.52 - 2951.52] it's a great idea and but this is a nut
[2950.16 - 2954.84] butter right here so i'm gonna put it in
[2951.52 - 2954.84] a little jar
[2956.40 - 2960.64] so i'm putting these pieces in a jar
[2958.08 - 2960.64] right here
[2961.28 - 2966.96] now you can you can shape this in any
[2963.20 - 2968.48] way you want you can pack it down right
[2966.96 - 2970.64] you can do what you want with this nut
[2968.48 - 2972.88] butter but what's incredible about
[2970.64 - 2975.04] walnuts don't they're they're always
[2972.88 - 2976.64] just like this in the sense where you
[2975.04 - 2978.72] know when you cashews it'll be a little
[2976.64 - 2979.60] bit more creamier but cashew butter you
[2978.72 - 2982.48] buy
[2979.60 - 2985.04] they add a ton of oil like that's that's
[2982.48 - 2986.72] real like what they do it's crazy but no
[2985.04 - 2988.40] one talks about it yeah they'll add
[2986.72 - 2990.16] cashew oil they'll add walnut oil
[2988.40 - 2993.44] they'll add almond oil but they're
[2990.16 - 2994.96] adding all this oil is what they do
[2993.44 - 2998.16] right
[2994.96 - 2999.04] so that's how it's done
[2998.16 - 3000.72] okay
[2999.04 - 3004.80] so you can pack down your nut butter in
[3000.72 - 3004.80] here in a nice little jar if you want
[3006.56 - 3011.64] right and then get the rest of it in
[3008.64 - 3011.64] here
[3018.08 - 3021.60] so what happens is you get kind of
[3019.52 - 3023.04] ripped off they put all this oil in it's
[3021.60 - 3024.96] all oily
[3023.04 - 3027.28] it's not actually good for you that way
[3024.96 - 3028.72] when there's that much oil in it
[3027.28 - 3030.48] right
[3028.72 - 3032.56] if you soak the nuts they'll get a
[3030.48 - 3035.28] little softer but i'd say rinsing them
[3032.56 - 3035.28] is great too
[3037.92 - 3041.04] but you don't want it when you're making
[3039.36 - 3042.72] nut butters you don't want to soak the
[3041.04 - 3045.20] nuts long because it makes your nut
[3042.72 - 3046.96] butters go bad later you don't want them
[3045.20 - 3050.48] like that you just want to give them a
[3046.96 - 3052.56] quick rinse or you can go with them dry
[3050.48 - 3055.28] i like giving it one rinse but not
[3052.56 - 3056.80] soaking it so that's a jar of walnut
[3055.28 - 3059.12] butter right there and you can see where
[3056.80 - 3061.44] that moisture is there where like
[3059.12 - 3063.04] there is that oil there that's naturally
[3061.44 - 3065.28] in that walnut butter you see how it's
[3063.04 - 3067.36] starting to get that like creamy like
[3065.28 - 3070.00] see that creamy
[3067.36 - 3072.96] but but just so you know
[3070.00 - 3075.52] there wasn't four ounces of oil added
[3072.96 - 3078.00] into this and put into the big jar so
[3075.52 - 3080.64] you go to the store you buy the jar and
[3078.00 - 3082.88] you're buying a hunk of oil that was
[3080.64 - 3084.88] added after the fact which is actually
[3082.88 - 3086.96] kind of a little bit scary you know when
[3084.88 - 3089.60] i think about it so that's why i like
[3086.96 - 3092.64] making my own right there
[3089.60 - 3095.20] this is raw too this is not roasted nut
[3092.64 - 3097.92] butter and yes you can you can throw
[3095.20 - 3101.12] your almonds or walnuts or anything in
[3097.92 - 3103.04] the oven you can toast them and roast
[3101.12 - 3105.68] them and then throw them into the
[3103.04 - 3108.48] mm-1500 roasted after they've been
[3105.68 - 3110.24] cooled or something you can do that
[3108.48 - 3112.48] that's fine but that's your walnut
[3110.24 - 3114.24] butter right there
[3112.48 - 3118.00] and you can put a cap on it put it in
[3114.24 - 3120.24] the fridge and you're good you got your
[3118.00 - 3122.72] you got your walnut butter right there
[3120.24 - 3125.04] and you can put a nice little cap on it
[3122.72 - 3126.48] and then it goes right in the fridge
[3125.04 - 3127.84] incredible
[3126.48 - 3129.12] so you guys if you just came on here
[3127.84 - 3131.28] i'll give you a rundown on everything i
[3129.12 - 3133.84] just made which is really incredible
[3131.28 - 3136.00] it's fun it's exciting
[3133.84 - 3137.36] i made a salsa which is really awesome
[3136.00 - 3142.00] right there
[3137.36 - 3142.00] i'm going to try that salsa right now
[3143.04 - 3146.32] that's hot
[3144.40 - 3150.16] that jalapeno
[3146.32 - 3152.72] that was a hot pepper that's incredible
[3150.16 - 3154.64] that's amazing actually and then you got
[3152.72 - 3156.80] the puree you got the baby food right
[3154.64 - 3159.12] there
[3156.80 - 3160.80] right that's the yams
[3159.12 - 3162.48] that's a salsa you guys already see the
[3160.80 - 3163.52] walnut butter you guys already got that
[3162.48 - 3164.32] down
[3163.52 - 3166.00] right
[3164.32 - 3168.96] you guys on tick tock see that telegram
[3166.00 - 3172.00] and see the walnut butter
[3168.96 - 3174.40] i got the wheatgrass g shot
[3172.00 - 3174.40] right there
[3175.36 - 3178.56] that stuff is powerful
[3177.12 - 3180.72] right
[3178.56 - 3182.64] like i was saying before you don't want
[3180.72 - 3185.04] to separate the chlorophyll
[3182.64 - 3188.40] you want the wheatgrass chlorophyll in
[3185.04 - 3191.04] its complete chemical composition you
[3188.40 - 3192.56] isolate chlorophyll and it dies
[3191.04 - 3193.92] it can't do anything because your body
[3192.56 - 3195.28] will see it and be like i don't know who
[3193.92 - 3196.88] you are
[3195.28 - 3199.44] your body
[3196.88 - 3201.76] when when you isolate chlorophyll from
[3199.44 - 3205.20] any fruit vegetable not fruit any
[3201.76 - 3207.36] vegetable or leafy green or wheatgrass
[3205.20 - 3209.44] if you isolate chlorophyll or barley
[3207.36 - 3211.36] grass shoots power if you isolate it and
[3209.44 - 3213.44] it goes in the body isolated your body
[3211.36 - 3215.84] seems like i don't know what you are
[3213.44 - 3217.52] you're missing everything else to tell
[3215.84 - 3218.88] me what you are
[3217.52 - 3221.12] so that's why
[3218.88 - 3222.72] i don't like the chlorophyll drops they
[3221.12 - 3224.56] don't work they never did i've been
[3222.72 - 3225.92] saying that for 30 years
[3224.56 - 3227.44] okay
