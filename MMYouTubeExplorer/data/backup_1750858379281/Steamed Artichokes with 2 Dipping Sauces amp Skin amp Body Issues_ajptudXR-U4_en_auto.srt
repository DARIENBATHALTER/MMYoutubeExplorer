everything here

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,280
um so

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,959
to start with these things are finishing

111
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,120
up so we'll just give them a couple more

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,320
minutes i'm going to turn down the heat

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,600
get this to chill out turn it down

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,800
and then i'm going to get them out and

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,040
we're going to plate them up we're going

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,560
to make some dipping sauces

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,560
but let me show you what i did

118
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,320
see these got the long stems and i

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
noticed that sometimes in the grocery

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919
store

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,240
you'll see them with short stems so when

122
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,160
they

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,240
when they prepped them for the grocery

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,080
store they cut the stem off now

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,240
the the longer the stem

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,160
so if you after you steam it if you eat

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,360
it all the way down to the lower stem

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,560
it's really bitter

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,880
so down here about right here

130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,280
this inch inch and a half you guys is a

131
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,520
really better section

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,240
now i like to what i like to do

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,880
sometimes is even though it's bitter

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,320
okay even though it's better i do like

135
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,800
to

136
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,639
looking for my uh knife i do like to

137
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,919
peel this back a little bit like this

138
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,479
sometimes

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,400
and because i don't like to waste it i

140
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,840
still like to eat the stem

141
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
first of all artichokes are really

142
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,800
expensive

143
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,080
these are organic ones okay but you'll

144
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
see what i'll do i'll show you what i

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,440
just did right now

146
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,520
just so you know so i just peeled back

147
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,880
that stem here because that's the rough

148
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,520
part is

149
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,120
this the skin on the stem that's edible

150
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,600
all this right

151
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,280
just cut a little piece of this off but

152
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,759
it gets a little bitter down here at the

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,520
end

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,880
but still i just love it i mean i love

155
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,400
the artichoke heart

156
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,960
this attaches to the heart of the

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,639
artichoke so it's attached

158
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,240
which is you know and so you you know

159
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,440
but it's tastier up

160
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,199
higher up about here in the stem i mean

161
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,919
right about here sorry about that

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,000
so just want to show you so i'm just

163
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,600
prepping this artichoke

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,520
these are almost done if you just got on

165
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,280

166
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,800

175
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,880
little bit back so i'd like to cut the

176
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,960

177
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,400

send this knife through now these are

201
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,840
tough to cut sometimes

202
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,599
all right that's the inside okay

203
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,120

scoop that out

210
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,080

212
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,440

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,200
healing the skin

235
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,560

dermatitis stagnant sluggish

240
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:22,000
liver filled with lots of toxins and

241
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,480
this meal has no fat in it so this is a

242
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,279
no

243
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,880
fat meal there's no oils in this meal

244
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,160
and i'm saying this for a reason because

245
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,080
i'm talking about your liver and

246
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,120
dermatitis you want to get dermatitis

247
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
better

248
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,040
you got to get off the fats or lower the

249
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,640
fats or reduce them

250
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,839
so you don't see oils in this meal and

251
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
you're not gonna see nut butters you're

252
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,040
not gonna see

253
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,760
avocado you're not gonna see pork fat in

254
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
this meal

255
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,200
you're not gonna see chicken fat in this

256
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,760
meal you're not gonna see

257
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,600
corn oil vegetable oil you know you're

258
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,800
not gonna see anything canola oil you're

259
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
not going to see

260
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,560
grease you're just not going to see any

261
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,040
of that in this meal

262
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,080
and that right there is the key to

263
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,560
getting the liver

264
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
better is i want to show you guys always

265
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,000
show you guys these

266
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,640
low fat to no fat actually no fat meals

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,519
and because what happens is every time

268
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,000
you're eating fat

269
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,519
your liver has to spill out a lifetime

270
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,680
of bile reserves

271
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,519
to break down the fat to try to thin it

272
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,720
out to save your life

273
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,000
to save your life and i'll talk about

274
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
what that fat does

275
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,680
it builds up into your arteries it

276
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,680
becomes the plaque

277
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,120
in your arteries science research

278
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,279
doesn't know that

279
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,480
they just don't know that which is

280
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,880
interesting right

281
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,360
so the whole point about these meals is

282
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,040
about reducing that fat or eliminating

283
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,959
the fat at least a little bit

284
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,640
in your life like a moment in your life

285
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,640
like whether it's a cleanse

286
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,560
whether it's a 20-day cleanse i mean you

287
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,519
guys should check the book out

288
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,680
it's on amazon you know get it so you

289
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,399
got this information but like the 28 day

290
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,399
cleanse you'll see

291
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,839
there won't be any fats in there so

292
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,839
that's important i mean unless you want

293
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,320
to stick a little bit of avocado in

294
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,079
something or something but i recommend

295
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,079
trying to have a moment in your life to

296
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,399
have the fats out of there so

297
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,000
you can get rid of the dermatitis get

298
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,760
rid of your skin problems

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,399
help get rid of your acne help get rid

300
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,040
of your eczema psoriasis vitiligo

301
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,079
because your liver is killing itself

302
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,240
every time you dump

303
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,560
fat in there like a whole bunch of oil

304
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,079
and grease and too much animal protein

305
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,040
and i'm not against animal protein i'm

306
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,519
not against plant

307
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,800
plant fat either and plant protein

308
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,079
people but

309
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,600
the whole point is is that when you're

310
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,120
dumping in all that fat your liver is

311
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
killing itself

312
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
to actually thin out the blood that's

313
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,279
what

314
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,880
biles for bile is released to try to

315
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,200
always save your butt

316
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,880
and to break down that fat so it thins

317
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
it out to get it either out of your

318
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,760
system someday somehow some way right

319
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,800
and that's one thing and then the other

320
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,959
thing is adrenals

321
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,800
every time you're eating fat your

322
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,880
adrenals are pumping

323
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,399
because you're you need adrenaline to

324
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,040
thin out your blood

325
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,560
so oxygen can go to your brain so your

326
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,399
brain sends them it's the minute you eat

327
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
all this fat

328
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,079
and many eat all this avocado and

329
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,279
avocados a healthy fat i get it but if

330
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,200
you're eating it every day and then

331
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,480
you're having chicken for dinner and you

332
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,040
had avocado toast for

333
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,160
for breakfast you had something for

334
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,240
lunch oil

335
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,760
on your food for lunch oil on your salad

336
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
for lunch chicken salad or whatever

337
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,519
you're doing tuna fish

338
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,600
you get all this fat in there and then

339
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,440
your adrenals are running all day to try

340
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,760
to thin out the blood

341
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,800
to disperse the fat in your bloodstream

342
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,839
your brain

343
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,399
tells your adrenals i need adrenaline

344
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,920
fast you have to thin out the blood or

345
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,680
you're going to kill me the brain

346
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,880
and you're going to kill me the heart so

347
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,120
that's how it works so i'm trying to

348
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,120
give you guys a chance to heal and when

349
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,120

and then what happens your liver gets

362
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,600
stagnant your liver gets sluggish and

363
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,839
you end up getting

364
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,000
the sun spots so now it's sunspot time

365
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839

367
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,160

like really get them you know because

the liver is going into

371
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,760
overdrive trying to absorb all that

372
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,720
adrenaline all the time and that's

373
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,160
another thing too

374
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,000
we're eating all these fats your liver

375
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,600
is killing itself to break down the fats

376
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,519
your adrenals are killing themselves to

377
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,880
release adrenaline to break down the fat

378
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,639
to thin out your blood

379
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,639
and then your liver has to do this

380
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,600
massive cleanup it has to suck in all

381
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,720
the fat that it

382
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,399
that it can't disperse and and it has to

383
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,279
suck in all this fat so you get the

384
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,880
fatty liver

385
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,199
and then you get the dermatitis you get

386
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,079
all kinds of problems you get the gout

387
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,440
you get i mean everything goes wrong and

388
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,920
and your liver is killing itself to

389
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,519
absorb

390
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,040
all that adrenaline it's killing itself

391
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,199
to absorb all that fat and then we just

392
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:17,839
get in trouble right there

393
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:17,839
gail says liver rescue yeah

394
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,800
so i mean seriously i mean

395
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,800
it's important to know it really is

396
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,800
so um let's keep on working on this

397
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,320

about to get started

401
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
we're kind of moving through just just

402
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,760
covering a couple questions

403
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,880
um so that's important and let's talk

404
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,959
about what we're making steamed

405
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,880
artichokes which is a real healing food

406
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
and i want you guys to have the healing

407
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,720
foods right

408
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,519
everything you put in your body i just

409
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,720
saw geographical tongue that's liver

410
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,959
ella that's the liver right there so

411
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,040
just know i mean it's time to get the

412
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,360
liver healthier that's what geographical

413
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,079
that's what the geographical tongue is

414
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,639
that is

415
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,519
a liver that's heating up way too much

416
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,079
because it's

417
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,079
overloaded with toxins and poisons and

418
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,800
eventually what comes after geographical

419
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,959
tongue

420
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,120
comes after it is weight gain sometimes

421
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,079
during it sometimes before it but after

422
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,760
it can come out

423
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,680
you know so got to get that liver better

424
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,320
it's important gail you're reading

425
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,320
liverescue now so awesome awesome

426
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,399
um rebecca does the body need fat

427
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,680
the body gets fat from every single food

428
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,519
there is so

429
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:43,040
the body does need traces

430
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,959
of fat but that's traces and guess what

431
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,480
it's in all your food there's fat and

432
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,959
artichokes

433
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,079
there's fat and potatoes there's fat and

434
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,320
bananas

435
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,519
there's fat and butter leaf lettuce

436
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,600
there's fat in fruit

437
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,040
mangoes there's fat in every vegetable

438
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,120
broccoli has fat in it

439
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,560
broccoli green beans have fat in it um

440
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,639
so you know that's every single food you

441
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,279
eat an apple has fat in it

442
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,880
an apple has fat in it so we already got

443
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,600
the fats in those foods

444
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,959
so technically you're not fat free on

445
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,720
any of these meals because there's

446
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,480
traces of omega-3s

447
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,920
in these foods there's traces of

448
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,079
omega-3s

449
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,079
six and nines in these foods right here

450
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,639
so we get that there

451
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,800
and it's okay to do avocado it's okay to

452
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,680
do some nut butters it's okay to do

453
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,519
um hemp seeds and and sesame seeds and

454
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,320
have some of that but that's not what we

455
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,040
do

456
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,600
that's not what we do here's what we do

457
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,680
it's

458
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,199
we fat ourselves to death that's all we

459
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,040
do that's what we've been taught

460
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,759
you just fat yourself to death that's

461
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,399
what we're taught it's fats all day long

462
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,800
all day long tuna salad for lunch eggs

463
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
for

464
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,720
fat everywhere cheese milk cheese butter

465
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,320
oils

466
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,759
okay sure you're doing healthy fat

467
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,680
you're doing some avocado

468
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,519
for one minute you're doing avocado yeah

469
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,440
you got a healthy fat but your body's

470
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,360
already like whoa healthy or not just

471
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,919
slow that stuff down

472
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,600
because you do an avocado toasted you're

473
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,679
throwing peanut butter in your smoothie

474
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,959
then you're doing chocolate cacao

475
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,839
straight fat

476
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,039
then it's like it doesn't stop so okay

477
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,000
are fats good for me

478
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,079
are they good for my body well some but

479
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
there's no such thing as any moderation

480
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,679
and there's no such thing as anything

481
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,240
being balanced all it is is fat all day

482
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,480
long

483
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,839
no moderation no balance no nothing

484
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,840
everybody's choking

485
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,880
that fat down they're just sending it

486
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,400
down send it down

487
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,280
sucking it down and it's nonstop

488
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
so unless someone decides intermittent

489
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,919
fast and the only reason why they

490
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,400
intermittent fast

491
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,320
is because it's by hit and miss it's

492
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,039
because someone accidentally one day

493
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,440
discovered

494
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,400
that if they don't eat all this food in

495
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,880
the morning

496
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,640
they start to feel a little better but

497
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,640
what they don't know

498
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,840
is they're not eating fats in the

499
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,320
morning anymore they're

500
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,120
actually holding back the fats they

501
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,360
don't even know it

502
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,440
intermittent so-called intermittent

503
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,600
fasting experts don't even know why

504
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,880
anybody starts to even feel better

505
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,080
when they intermittent fast and it

506
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,799
doesn't even mean it's the right thing

507
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,400
to do

508
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,400
because you're really supposed to have

509
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,880
fuel no matter what during your morning

510
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
and day

511
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,280
so you don't burn out your adrenals but

512
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,799
in intermittent fasting experts or

513
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,880
whoever they are

514
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,240
they don't even know that they're just

515
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,679
all like

516
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,919
they're just all like oh you're burning

517
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,799
fat you're burning fat you're burning up

518
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,400
carbs

519
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,080
you're not eating in the morning your

520
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,280
digestion is getting a little stronger i

521
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
mean that's pretty much as far as it

522
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
goes with them they don't know anything

523
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,320
else

524
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,679
and but what's happening is when you

525
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,240
when you're holding off

526
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,280
all that fat in the morning your liver

527
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,360
starts to bounce back

528
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,880
nobody knows that but your liver starts

529
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,760
to bounce back

530
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,440
and that's what happens so are we

531
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,960
getting any fats yeah we're getting fat

532
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,799
so getting them in the artichokes that i

533
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,919
got right here i'm about to plate up

534
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,480
we get them we get them in every food we

535
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,480
eat

536
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,000
and yeah if you want to have some sesame

537
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,000
tahini yeah if you want to have a little

538
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,400
peanut butter a little almond butter

539
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,400
yeah if you want to have some hemp seeds

540
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,440
a little avocado or something

541
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,440
but we don't do that we don't have a

542
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,960
little bit of sesame tahini we don't

543
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,320
have a little bit of

544
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,200
peanut butter we have tablespoons of it

545
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,480
all week long on top of the fact we have

546
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,840
chicken for dinner

547
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,880
whether you're vegan plant-based if

548
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,080
you're vegan you're still going to do

549
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,039
all these oils

550
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,000
on top of drowning things with olive oil

551
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,360
eggs

552
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,640
eggs are filled with fat that's what

553
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
they are i mean that's the whole point

554
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,440
it's

555
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,960
it's like we don't do anything but fat

556
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,480
no one's like i'll just eat that piece

557
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,039
of fruit and some greens i'm good for

558
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,280
now

559
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,480
are you kidding no one's doing that

560
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,360
nobody's doing that

561
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,640
it doesn't exist so it's and if it does

562
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,240
it's from

563
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,160
from medical medium information teaching

564
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,559
people for 35 years if it does exist

565
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,640
so it's because they never did it before

566
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,640
i got into the health scene 35 years ago

567
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
it was fat fat fat fat and it's still

568
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,480
fat fat fat today

569
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,919
and the dairy products straight fat

570
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,320
kefir

571
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,360
milk goat's milk sheep's milk sheep's

572
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,799
cheese goat's cheese

573
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,559
oh i'm on goat's cheese i'm not eating

574
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,080
any fat what

575
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,760
that's a head scratcher to me right

576
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,840
there are you kidding

577
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,880
and so it's all about just fatting

578
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,799
ourselves to death

579
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,400
boom just that's we're killing ourselves

580
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,840
let's just kill ourselves

581
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,520
because pretty much that's what it is

582
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,919
but it's a slow death

583
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,600
that's what it is we fat ourselves to a

584
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,880
slow death and then eventually

585
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,320
and here's the thing here's the sad

586
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,320
thing that plaque in our arteries

587
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,400
you know what it's made out of it's not

588
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,440
made out of cholesterol that's that's

589
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
how that's how

590
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,200
science of research is so off the mark

591
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,039
they're off the mark on all chronic

592
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,520
illness they're off the market 90

593
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,640
99 of all chronic illness are off the

594
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,440
mark

595
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,159
and i'm not talking about the robots

596
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,840
they create

597
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,360
that science creates to to get an

598
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,000
aneurysm out of somebody's brain when i

599
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,320
talk to a

600
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,200
neurosurgeon that's amazing but that's

601
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
what i'm talking about i'm talking about

602
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,120
chronic illness i'm talking about

603
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,559
everybody else

604
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,080
everybody the whole world who's sick

605
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,440
with symptoms science research doesn't

606
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,000
know why anybody's sick

607
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,880
so and plaque in the arteries that's

608
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
from fat

609
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,120
and toxins combined congealed

610
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,720
that's from fat in your system running

611
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,760
through the pipes

612
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,799
you gotta you gotta see your system as

613
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,640
pipes right and what's running through

614
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,640
those pipes is fat let me just have this

615
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,400
avocado right here that's some fat let

616
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,960
me have some more nut butter in here

617
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,080
let me have chicken and put some olive

618
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,159
oil on that chicken

619
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,760
let me have some salmon and make sure i

620
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,679
cook it in olive oil

621
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:39,039
make sure i keep on doing all that and

622
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,960
what happens is and it would have

623
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,880
a look let's do more coconut oil let's

624
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,640
do more more coconut butter

625
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,919
let's do ghee let's do whatever we can

626
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,840
find and

627
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,480
what we're doing is we're running fat

628
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,640
through our pipeline

629
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,159
non-stop running pipe fat through our

630
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,159
pipeline

631
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,720
and it and because of that that fat is

632
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,080
also

633
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,000
toxin soluble so the more

634
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,840
fat that you got running through you the

635
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,400
more fat that's in our bodies

636
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,159
the more toxins absorb into those fat

637
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,559
cells fat cells absorb

638
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,600
pesticides herbicides fungicides

639
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,520
petrochemicals

640
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,600
colognes perfumes scented candles

641
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,200
because the list goes on pharmaceuticals

642
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,559
boom cold medicine antibiotics

643
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,320
benzodiazepines

644
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:25,679
anti-inflammatories just all day long

645
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,919
toxic heavy metals

646
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:33,039
and all that all that fat absorbs it all

647
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:36,799
right absorbs it all and then

648
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:40,480
the fat congeals and guess what

649
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:43,120
our defense mechanism is holy crap

650
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,240
what do we do and and it just starts to

651
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,400
line

652
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,280
it lines the sides of the river which is

653
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,600
your pipeline

654
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,280
your arteries your veins start to line

655
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
it and line it and line it so what

656
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,840
you're going to be told

657
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,520

it's unbelievable

683
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,200
and it's counter intuition it's

684
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,400
unintuition they

685
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,799
unintuit you everybody is unintuiting

686
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
you

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,960
and theft it you guys have no intuition

690
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,200
left

691
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,720
sounds like an insult but it's just a

692
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,799
fact what happens is

693
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,080
because every time i talk to people the

694
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,520
most intuitive people in the world they

695
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,200
tell me the most intuitive people in the

696
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,400
world do all their spiritual practices

697
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,960
they're sitting down they're doing all

698
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,480
their prayers

699
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
they're doing all their meditations and

700
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,279
then i hear they're like burning scented

701
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,520
candles

702
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,799
and they're pouring fat on their food

703
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,960
your intuition

704
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,360
your heart and your brain and your your

705
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,279
body's your body doesn't want all that

706
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,640
fat going in there to kill you

707
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,320
and your body doesn't want all that

708
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,440
caffeine going in there to kill you and

709
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,360
all those chemicals so

710
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,360
whose intuition are we talking about i

711
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,279
want to know like someone please tell me

712
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,400
whose intuition's working

713
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,640
because every day all day long all i see

714
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,240
is

715
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,520
doctors and practitioners and healers

716
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,000
and everybody else and their intuition

717
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,720
is

718
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,240
in the garbage it's in the garbage bin

719
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,840
because they're not using it i guess

720
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,000
everybody's born with it and then it's

721
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,440
stolen from us by the caffeine industry

722
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,960
and by the chemical industry and by

723
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,799
every other industry and it's stolen

724
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,640
by the health industry big pharma

725
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,760
soldiers did they steal

726
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,159
our intuition it's it's unbelievable

727
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,000
it's actually it's actually unbelievable

728
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,200
when you think about it

729
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,480
um jody says for me eaters what's the

730
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,080
healthiest meat to eat

731
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,200
lamb beef chicken seafood kangaroo

732
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,760
believe it or not fish is still

733
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,480
the healthiest okay so it'd be like

734
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,039
trout

735
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,799
be like salmon sardines right there so

736
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,279
if you're into animal proteins

737
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,400
you're better off having trout salmon

738
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,640
sardines

739
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
haddock that's another one right there

740
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,559
so haddock sardines

741
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,440
salmon you know get a hold of some

742
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,760
mackerel that could be a possibility

743
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,679
um i'll give you the most unhealthiest

744
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,159
okay and healthiest of all if you're an

745
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,360

760
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,880
surgery what do i need to do i got to

761
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,400

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,279
stint put in a shunt put in

763
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
wait a minute what do i got to do and

764
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,360
and then you're laying on the table and

765
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,600
they got to run them

766
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,760
they got to run a scope they got to run

767
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,600
a scope through your leg

768
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,799
up through your arteries and veins and

769
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,159
they gotta think and then they gotta

770
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,880
find out where your arteries are

771
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,799
collapsing

772
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,799
because of all that pork fat and then

773
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,799
they gotta shove a stint in there

774
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,480
it just is no fun but when you're 20 and

775
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,919
you're exercising and you're on this

776
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,600
this keto diet and you think you've

777
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,440
learned everything about health

778
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,279
i noticed is everybody's a health expert

779
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,960
now like every 25 year old's a health

780
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,480
expert it's just unbelievable because

781
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,720
they went keto

782
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,559
and lamb might be cautious about it's

783
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,240
really high in fat

784
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,000
if you're going to do animal proteins

785
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,679
you really like animal proteins and you

786
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,600
keep it to grass-fed beef but you don't

787
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,440
overdo it that's one option

788
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,520
grass of beef just don't don't overdo it

789
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,520
if you're into animal protein

790
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,720
i would do turkey over chicken even

791
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,440
though turkey's

792
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,159
high in fat too i would do turkey over

793
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,400
chicken

794
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,480

795
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,279

and so it'd be like you'd be like okay

807
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,919
well when i go through things

808
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,039
with people i'll give you the give you

809
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,440
the rundown you could do a little bit of

810
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,520
grass-fed beef if you like beef fine

811
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,960
i would stay away from chicken yeah you

812
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,919
can have it if you want but i would stay

813
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,760
away from chicken

814
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,440
it's way too high in fat um the turkey's

815
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,520
better than the chicken even though

816
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,840
turkey's high in fat's still better

817
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,120
than the chicken for you so that's

818
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,240
something to think about

819
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,520
fish like i said the salmon the trout

820
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,080
the haddock the sardines small fish

821
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,679
like sardines really good option really

822
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,720
good option if you're into animal

823
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,799
protein

824
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,640
and it's got lower metals in it don't

825
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,399
get fooled by the fish thing

826
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,320
hey he's talking about fish why is he

827
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,760
doing that when he's about getting toxic

828
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,039
heavy metals out

829
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,120
first of all we're getting metals

830
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,200
everywhere everywhere anyhow you're

831
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,399
in grass-fed beef it's in there it's in

832
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,159
every animal protein

833
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,000
it's on every vegetable it's in every

834
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,840
vegetable organic or not

835
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,080
toxic heavy metals are in every single

836
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,919
organic vegetable every single

837
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,600
organic food you've ever eaten toxic

838
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
heavy metals are in

839
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,679
so when it comes down to fish it go with

840
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,200
the smaller fish they do have less and

841
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,440
go with wild caught but yeah

842
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,320
i would stay away from tilapia stay the

843
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,880
heck away from it

844
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,840

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,600
help with getting books in libraries so

880
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,159
people can read the books for free

881
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,200
something i've done for years um and if

882
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,120
you don't have the 16

883
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,960
20 or whatever it's going to be the

884
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,559
other thing is

885
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,640
cleanse the heal has a lyme disease

886
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,960
section in cleanse to heal

887
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,799
with supplements and protocols just like

888
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,159
the new addition does with supplements

889
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,600
and protocols for lyme disease you can

890
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,080
take it to your doctor find out what's

891
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,440
you know

892
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,440
your doctor can see what's right for you

893
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,919
or not if you want talk to your doctor

894
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
about

895
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,360
what to do and all that if you want but

896
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,840
the protocols are here okay that's one

897
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,840
thing to know

898
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,919
and then it's about supplements the best

899
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,360
supplements and that's what matters too

900
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:48,399
so using a b12

901
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,279
that's not good won't get someone better

902
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,760
down the road

903
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,559
versus a b12 that is good so that's the

904
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,480
other thing

905
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,080
it's like like the vimergy products is

906
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,120
what i recommend doctors so i tell

907
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,559
doctors all the time

908
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,720
i go if you're giving your patients

909
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,559
another type of b12 then

910
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,320
the the effective rate of actually them

911
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,080
healing is going to be a lot less

912
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,000
that's why the vimorgy products i always

913
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,000
promote i promote other products too

914
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,840
that are actually really good

915
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,679
vimergi is the one i use that's why it's

916
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,480
always on my counter it's the one i use

917
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,039
so

918
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,240
um vimerges v is in victor i m

919
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,279
victorimergy.com vimrgy.com i'm not

920
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,200
sponsored

921
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,519
but the point is is that when it comes

922
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,760
down to lyme disease it's like

923
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,519
when you have neurological lyme it's you

924
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,679
got to have the right b12

925
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,760
and you ask your doctor if this is this

926
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,279
is fine fine to do or whatever

927
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,200
but this is what i would do if i had

928
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,840
lyme disease neurological lyme

929
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,480
that's the b12 i'd be using it's in and

930
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,120
that's

931
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,720
just the starting point of like okay

932
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,159
then i would learn about what foods not

933
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,320
to do

934
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,480
vitamin c is critical if i had lyme

935
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,559
disease i would be on microsee

936
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,880
the vimercy microc that's what i would

937
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,600
do personally me i'd be taking six

938
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,279
capsules

939
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,200
twice a day that's what i would do if i

940
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,600
had lyme disease that's the microc right

941
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,919
there

942
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,840
and this goes with this goes with

943
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,640
conditions and symptoms of all kinds too

944
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,640
i mean

945
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,480
this is all critical stuff um

946
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,159
so and and then there's a bunch of other

947
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,760
stuff too this is getting metals out

948
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,360
anybody with lyme disease has toxic

949
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,919
heavy metals off the charts

950
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,240
off the charts even if the blood test

951
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,240
doesn't show the toxic heavy metals

952
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,480
if you got neurological lyme disease you

953
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,880
got metals inside the brain nervous

954
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,799
system

955
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,799
liver all that's important to know so

956
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,960
that's where the vimrgy spirulina and

957
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,600
the heavy metal detox smoothie comes in

958
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
so these are just some things um so i'll

959
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,840
give you a couple tips about lyme

960
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,919
disease

961
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,440
lyme disease is viral not bacterial

962
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,600
science research actually now

963
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,679
are taking medical medium information

964
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,880
they dump the whole bacterial thing so

965
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,640
you know how you say you see the

966
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,080
co-infection thing you see

967
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,559
all right and there's a lyme disease

968
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,240
in the original book here but this is

969
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,919
the new edition with the lime protocol

970
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,279
all that stuff that's in this i showed

971
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,600
that to you earlier

972
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,039
um so you guys can show that to you

973
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,679
again see if that helps

974
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,360
but the co-infection thing just give you

975
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,320
a quick rundown about that

976
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,880
that is old school now so that's old

977
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,080
school

978
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,360
because science research jumped ahead of

979
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,360
all the lyme doctors

980
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,640
so you got these old lyme doctors now

981
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,880
going by old school

982
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,279
and the blood labs going by old school

983
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,120
right they think it's still bacteria

984
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,200
that's what they think it's not bacteria

985
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,679
it's it's viral it's viruses so

986
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,519
but but when you say cofactors that

987
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,679
means you got the old lyme doctors

988
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,880
that means you got the old you got the

989
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,000
old school

990
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,360
process that process already

991
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,799
hurt and hindered tens of thousands

992
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,559
hundreds of thousands of women in the

993
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,200
last 40 years

994
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,799
so more than 40 years because it's not

995
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,679
viral it's not bacterial it's viral

996
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,919
sorry about that

997
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,960
but so what happens is science research

998
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,440
they know now

999
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,399
it's not bacterial so that cofactor

1000
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,720
thing

1001
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,919
that thing is actually just old school

1002
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,440
it's almost like someone didn't get the

1003
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,600
memo at the blood lab

1004
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,960
but the blood lime labs they don't want

1005
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,559
to lose all their money and they don't

1006
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,240
want to lose everything they did

1007
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,000
so they're trying to save their skin so

1008
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,599
they keep on doing the same old thing

1009
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,560
even though science research

1010
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,320
already the boss the boss of all of them

1011
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,960
science research now

1012
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,919
has basically declared cleared it's not

1013
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,839
bacterial

1014
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,280
so here you've got like it's like a

1015
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,119
ghost ship you got the

1016
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,399
the lime labs still looking for

1017
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,919
co-factors you've got

1018
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,919
lyme doctors still looking for

1019
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,359
co-factors when that's not the problem

1020
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,720
that's how sad it is it's so sad mm-info

1021
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,000
has always talked about it being viral

1022
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,639
and now science research

1023
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,480
pulled it out of bacterial years after

1024
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,000
publication of the book and now they're

1025
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,679
looking for different things so it's

1026
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,639
important to know when you're healing

1027
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,280
okay so i'm gonna make the dipping sauce

1028
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,960
i have the

1029
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,280
artichoke right here i'm just gonna put

1030
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,320
it over

1031
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,960
got the artichokes there's a cooked

1032
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,359
artichoke

1033
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,879
cooked half i have that's a half of a

1034
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,320
cooked artichoke right there

1035
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,680
so the heart is right right in this area

1036
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,760
you've got to scoop out that little

1037
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,160
fiber that little fiber the

1038
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,040
seed fiber right there i could show you

1039
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,520
that too

1040
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,760
let me put these here so um

1041
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,839
let's make the uh first of all i gotta

1042
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,839
get a bowl

1043
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:25,119
and gonna whisk up a sauce

1044
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,920
so this is the mustard maple dipping

1045
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,240
sauce

1046
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,440
so i'm gonna have two tablespoons of

1047
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,960
maple syrup

1048
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,359
i'm going to drop some of this in here

1049
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,359
like that

1050
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,720
some maple syrup is good two and a half

1051
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,640
tablespoons of lemon

1052
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,640
juice now if you're worried about lemon

1053
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,160
you shouldn't be okay there's no signs

1054
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,839
of research that says lemon has done

1055
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,400
anything wrong to anybody but for some

1056
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,920
reason everybody believes it hurts them

1057
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,599
hurts their teeth really what happens is

1058
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,119
it's all the caffeine that's sucking

1059
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,960
life out of everybody's teeth

1060
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,119
sucking the calcium out of everybody's

1061
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,480
teeth it's on that apple cider vinegar

1062
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,440
it's all the vinegars i've been talking

1063
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,280
about right

1064
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,359
that's what's actually robbing from

1065
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,640
people's teeth it's lauren henry

1066
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,920
love cooked artichokes hey lauren good

1067
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,680
to see you

1068
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:25,119
lauren's a expert on mm info

1069
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,720
um good to see you here

1070
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,520
yeah i mean the real artichokes are so

1071
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,680
good

1072
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,440
what i'm doing is i'm making the mustard

1073
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,599
maple dipping sauce right now

1074
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,079
i'm adding some lemon and

1075
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,960
i need a little bit more lemon than that

1076
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,079
i want to get two

1077
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,599
two and a half tablespoons of lemon

1078
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:52,079
juice so i'm going to cut one more lemon

1079
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,440
lunell good to see you here

1080
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,119
so you know when it comes down to

1081
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,000
healing

1082
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,920
the supplements matter the foods matter

1083
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,119
like what foods to do what foods not to

1084
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,960
do

1085
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,240
anybody and everybody has a chance to

1086
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,599
heal it's how you play it

1087
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,560
right like it's about applying the

1088
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,160
information

1089
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,160
if you're somebody that doesn't want to

1090
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,079
apply all the information or they only

1091
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,680
want to apply one thing

1092
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,200
and then you get sidetracked and all

1093
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,960
this other information out there

1094
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,560
like throwing in collagen and

1095
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,720
doing you know doing something that

1096
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,680
maybe won't be the best for you

1097
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,440
downing the charcoal pills doing cruella

1098
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,880
whatever it is that's out there

1099
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,200
you're not going to go to the finish

1100
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,160
line doing too much fat when you're

1101
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,520
trying to heal

1102
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,960
you're not going to get down the finish

1103
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,839
line you're not going to get down there

1104
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,760
so

1105
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,160
if you want to heal it's about really

1106
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,599
applying as much as you can

1107
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,520
of what works that's a big deal to

1108
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,040
healing

1109
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,800
so i'm gonna need some mustard so let me

1110
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,560
do a little bit of that so

1111
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,520
about a half teaspoon of mustard powder

1112
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,520
let's get that going

1113
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,520
making the mustard maple dipping sauce

1114
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,839
a little mustard powder in there like

1115
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
that

1116
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,440
all right we got that so um

1117
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,640
what else do we need we need the cayenne

1118
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,680
a little bit of cayenne now you don't

1119
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,599
want it too hot

1120
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,800
i tend to spike everything and it gets a

1121
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,640
little too hot

1122
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,720
it's kind of like an accident i just end

1123
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,359
up throwing too much in there but

1124
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,880

salt vinegar

1171
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,680
fats natural flavoring nutritional yeast

1172
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,640
yeast you know you know the game is with

1173
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,400
nutritional yeast

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,400
they put the word nutritional before it

1175
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,240
yeah that's how they got you no it's

1176
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,240
yeast

1177
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,520
and east is filled with a lot of bad

1178
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,720

why do i want yeast

1186
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,079
i mean i'm confused about that one a

1187
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,560
little bit

1188
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,640
let me just throw yeast on my food like

1189
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,599
that's real smart let me just throw

1190
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,599
yeast in my food

1191
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,040
and then let's put the word nutritional

1192
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,240
in front of yeast like

1193
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,680
fancy that one okay

1194
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,880
that's one dipping sauce right there

1195
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,319
okay so i'm just one dipping sauce gonna

1196
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,000
make another dipping sauce

1197
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,480
i need some room over here i'm just

1198
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,440
gonna put that over there for now

1199
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,440
um so when you think about it

1200
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,960
so worst thing you can have is yeast in

1201
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,000
general

1202
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:35,839
and as far as nutritional yeast just

1203
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,839
don't put that word in front of it

1204
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,359
yeah you can find a nutrient in

1205
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,960
everything that's bad for you you can

1206
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,920
find a nutrient in every single thing

1207
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,319
that's bad for you

1208
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,839

singrit said haha my tcm doctor

1273
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,040
did give me snake venom in an herbal

1274
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,680
formula

1275
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:23,760
interesting and also a bad idea

1276
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:28,480
really bad idea

1277
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,720
that's a neurotoxin stuff scares me man

1278
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,640
chinero says is collagen healthy for the

1279
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,119
body

1280
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,760
no because you can't eat

1281
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,520
if you got an eye problem do you think

1282
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,520
eating a sheep's eyeball or a human

1283
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,440
eyeball is gonna fix your eye problem

1284
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,040
no if you got a kidney problem kidney

1285
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,160
disease do you think you should start

1286
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,200
eating kidneys

1287
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,480
you think it'll fix your kidney um you

1288
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,680
got a brain disease do you think

1289
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,960
desiccated brain

1290
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,520
in supplements is going to fix your

1291
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,880
brain i mean if none of that's going to

1292
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,400
work if you got collagen problems

1293
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,839
because your collagen is disintegrating

1294
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,280
because of caffeine damage

1295
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,200
because caffeine is what kills her

1296
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,560
collagen it's like

1297
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,400
you're losing your collagen and your

1298
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,839
skin's falling apart you know your

1299
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,960
skin's wrinkling and sagging and

1300
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,680
everything because your collagen is

1301
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,200
going away

1302
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,960
you're aging before your time that's

1303
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,480
because of caffeine it's from chocolate

1304
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,319
caffeine and from toxins and other

1305
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,040
things too it's not just caffeine

1306
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,480
but caffeine is a big one and you know

1307
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,599
you lose your collagen you can't just

1308
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,520
eat collagen to

1309
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,880
fix the collagen the body doesn't work

1310
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,400
like that the collagen will go in and

1311
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,920
you'll poop it out that's it

1312
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,319
go in and you'll poop it out it's just

1313
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,839
it doesn't find its way all of a sudden

1314
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,880
to where your collagen is supposed to be

1315
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,599
produced and then you

1316
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,040
produce collagen i mean this this this

1317
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,720
this shit's psycho out there

1318
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,319
it's actually psycho the stuff that

1319
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,040
they're doing like or the trends that

1320
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,560
are out there

1321
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,079
they just think you guys are all like

1322
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,920
suckers or something you know

1323
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,599
and i get it that's how the system's set

1324
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,040
up it's like the butter and the coffee

1325
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,000
thing how stupid is that you may as well

1326
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,800
have your eggs toast

1327
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,359
toast and bacon with it i mean how dumb

1328
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,920
is that

1329
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,720
like it's like it's psycho out there it

1330
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,800
really is

1331
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,760
and it's it's all there to just mess

1332
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,160
everybody up

1333
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,359
and make money while they're doing it

1334
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,750
it's crazy

1335
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:12,839
let's put some tablespoon of lemon in

1336
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:15,200
[Music]

1337
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:17,760
here

1338
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,760
get it going

1339
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,720
cmos anything good about it yeah it's

1340
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,319
fine

1341
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,240
it's not going to get the metals out

1342
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,400
like dolls and the heavy metal detox

1343
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,480
smoothie or spirulina

1344
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,960
but it it's fine you can do that

1345
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,240
see moss i'm not against it at all so

1346
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,520
i'm going to do one tablespoon of lemon

1347
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,720
juice i didn't get much out of that

1348
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,000
lemon for some of that lemon

1349
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,000
didn't have a lot of juice in it you

1350
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,760
know how that happens

1351
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,560
here we go here's a lemon that has a lot

1352
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,880
of juice in it there we go

1353
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,880
so

1354
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,880
are facial laser treatments harmful or

1355
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,880
beneficial

1356
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,880
micro needling harmful

1357
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:07,920
microneedling not good

1358
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,920
not good not good just letting you know

1359
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,760
not good at all body's trying to

1360
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,920
overcompensate for itself when you micro

1361
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,119
needle just like everything else and

1362
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,359
eventually you'll have more problems

1363
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,359
later on your skin than than than

1364
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:23,760
where you started from you get like

1365
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,839
micro needling leads to micro scar

1366
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,839
tissue

1367
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,720
that's what it leads to micro scar

1368
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,880
tissue is what it leads to

1369
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,720
and so i'm not a big fan of that right

1370
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,079
there

1371
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:42,319
just so you know

1372
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,319
um so that's one thing

1373
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,640
laser treatments of what happens is

1374
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,880
we get we get the sun spots from the

1375
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,640
toxins and the caffeine

1376
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,319
caffeine especially creates the sun

1377
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,680
spots so i mean

1378
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,559
that's one thing right there so the next

1379
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,079
thing you're doing lasers for that

1380
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,319

1476
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,839
not good

1477
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,880
it's not good especially when you're

1478
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:22,640
sick or you don't feel good

1479
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,240
i'm making the dipping sauce right here

1480
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,680
this happens to be a really incredible

1481
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,040
one

1482
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,440
this is the recipe out of the new

1483
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,440
edition

1484
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,280
it's taking a little bit to spin

1485
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,839
okay

1486
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,800
so when it comes down to skin cancer

1487
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,319
science research wants you afraid of the

1488
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,839
sun now huh

1489
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,839
he wants you afraid of the sun

1490
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,000
i'm not telling you to go out and get a

1491
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,000
sunburn

1492
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:08,240
all right there we go

1493
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,240
that's the dipping sauce i'm excited

1494
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,040
so there's two dipping sauces with these

1495
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,319
artichokes so science of research will

1496
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,559
say hey

1497
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,800
you know the sun is where your skin

1498
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,119
cancer is caused the sun is the problem

1499
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,160
the sun is a bad thing that's that's

1500
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,079
what's going on

1501
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,160
um it's all about the sun causing your

1502
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,720
skin cancer like i said it's it's

1503
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,640
but you know why did the sun just all of

1504
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,359
a sudden go bad or something like that

1505
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,240
like

1506
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:42,079
because skin cancer is is more people

1507
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,440
that don't go in the sun get skin cancer

1508
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,240
than people that go in the sun

1509
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,119
so why is the sun all of a sudden like a

1510
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,359
problem

1511
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,960
and the other thing is is what billions

1512
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,680
of years go by and the sun went bad all

1513
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,440
of a sudden

1514
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,680
so i'm scratching my head on that one in

1515
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,960
the last 20 years the sun went bad

1516
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,359
so now the sun's the problem you know

1517
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,160
in the last 20 30 50 years the sun went

1518
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:06,240
bad so billions of years go by

1519
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,319
and now all of a sudden the sun is bad

1520
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,839
like just like our jeans so just like

1521
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:13,119
our jeans went bad

1522
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:16,400
so our genes went bad millions of years

1523
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,480
our genes went bad okay um

1524
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,079
billions of years the sun went bad now

1525
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,520
so everything's just going bad but

1526
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,280
but it's not the petrochemicals and the

1527
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,800
pesticides and your air fresheners

1528
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,400
it's not the toxic heavy metals in your

1529
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,119
pharmaceuticals

1530
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,720
that everybody's playing with uh from

1531
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,240
big pharma it's toxic heavy metals and

1532
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,400
every pharmaceutical it's not that it's

1533
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,920
not the caffeine everybody's drugged on

1534
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,359
it's not the drug dealer selling all the

1535
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,800
caffeine right now like the mushroom

1536
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,640
coffees and every other caffeine and

1537
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,200
chocolate and everything else

1538
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,480
to get teaching influencers to just sell

1539
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,000
all their chocolate now and everything

1540
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,440
else put their name on some chocolate

1541
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,280
and just get more kids high and more

1542
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,720
people high and more people high

1543
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,559
it's not any of that no it's not the

1544
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,160
radiation going through the airport

1545
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,800
i mean jesus christ you go through the

1546
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,760
airport and you get radiated to death

1547
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,440
it's not that no it's not the msg and

1548
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,040
all the natural flavors and all your

1549
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,480
powders and all your supplements and

1550
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,920
liquid supplements and all your foods

1551
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,720
and packaged foods it's not the natural

1552
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,119
flavors

1553
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,480
that which is straight msg it's not the

1554
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,920
ddt you're breathing in it's not the

1555
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,440
asbestos you're breathing in driving

1556
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,960
down the highway with your window down

1557
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,000
and all the asbestos is coming in from

1558
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,400
the sides of the highway

1559
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,240
from asbestos breaks for 100 years it's

1560
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,160
not the fire retardant on your

1561
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,680
your bed sheets and your your bedding

1562
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,599
and your your mattresses

1563
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,119
no it's not the fire retardant on your

1564
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,920
clothing it's not the fungicides under

1565
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,160
clothing either

1566
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,480
it's not that no the sun went bad that's

1567
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:35,839
why you got skin cancer the sun went bad

1568
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,280
i mean it's ridiculous it's like science

1569
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,839
research fell asleep or something or

1570
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,880
they're just

1571
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,599
they're just so negligent so negligent

1572
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,920
it's

1573
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,520
it's almost it's almost too much at this

1574
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,000
point it's almost

1575
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,480
so ridiculous and too stupid that you

1576
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
can't even like

1577
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,760
you can't even i mean i don't even know

1578
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,240
what to say anymore it's

1579
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,079
oh man anyway okay so

1580
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,540

[Music]

1583
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,839
so this dipping sauce is really good

1584
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,000
it's a zucchini dipping sauce it's got

1585
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:15,520
the lemon

1586
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,520
and so i'm just getting it in here

1587
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,119
so i got this sauce it's really good so

1588
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,920
i got these artichokes here i got more

1589
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,760
in here

1590
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,240
right you guys see that just want to

1591
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,680
bring it over

1592
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,680
so so we're told it's not the suntan

1593
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,520
lotions right what about the toxic

1594
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,400
suntan lotions tell me those can't cause

1595
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,240
cancer

1596
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,520
i'm not saying burn yourself and sit in

1597
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,359
the sun and get and get them

1598
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,960
but what about the suntan lotions the

1599
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,359
sunscreen right

1600
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,160
toxic stuff you go to the beach and that

1601
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,640
stuff is so

1602
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,000
lethal like it's it's reeking off of

1603
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,000
people like you go to the beach

1604
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,319
and you don't sell you don't walk on the

1605
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,040
beach and be like oh

1606
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,640
clean ocean air let me breathe this in

1607
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,520
you know you do when you go to the beach

1608
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,160
oh my god i'm choking on cologne perfume

1609
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,319
and

1610
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,640
conventional laundry detergent and

1611
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:06,079
sunscreen filled toxic heavy metals and

1612
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,079
chemicals from companies

1613
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,760
let me just breathe in all that suntan

1614
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,799
lotion that's what happens when you go

1615
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,599
to the beach

1616
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,559
and you know skin cancer yeah the sun

1617
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,839
hand lotions

1618
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,680
talking about skin cancer so it's the

1619
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:22,880
chemicals in the suntan lotion

1620
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:26,000
the chemicals that are in there and um

1621
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,520
and then you know our own toxins you

1622
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,799
don't need to be in the sun

1623
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,400
that's a whole point you could be

1624
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,680
sitting at home and your liver is all

1625
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,040
stagnant and sluggish with all the

1626
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,880
toxins i talked about including the

1627
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,400
radiation the ddt the pesticides and

1628
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,319
chemicals and the gasoline

1629
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,680
you're pumping in your gas tank we can't

1630
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,079
run from all this stuff

1631
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,240
but that's what i mean it's like that's

1632
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,079
where the skin cancer comes from

1633
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,359
and then you need the viruses too

1634
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,680
because some

1635
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,119
some some skin cancers are not viral

1636
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,280
straight from toxins

1637
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,160
and chemicals but then some skin cancers

1638
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,240
they're viral

1639
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,160
so you need to feed the viruses all

1640
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,359
these toxins to create a skin cancer has

1641
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,359
nothing to do with the sun

1642
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,799
sun has not nothing to do with it same

1643
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,480
thing with sunspots

1644
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:06,640
the sun has nothing to do with sunspots

1645
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,160
it's like i love that one

1646
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,920
what does science research do do they

1647
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,359
just wake up one morning and say we're

1648
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,960
just going to the crap out of

1649
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,400
everybody we're gonna sit in the lab and

1650
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,400
not do anything we're gonna sit in the

1651
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,599
lab kick our feet up and not do nothing

1652
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,440
and then we're just gonna tell him it's

1653
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,960
the sun we're just gonna make it up

1654
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,680
there's no study that shows it we're

1655
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,760

1657
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,240

they don't want you to know about that

1664
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,599
about what's in the medications

1665

they don't want to know wants you to

1666
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,160
know anything they want you blind they

1667

information a

1673
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:55,359
thousand times i always felt that if i

1674
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,520
go and do one of the television shows

1675
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:59,440
been asked by every major network

1676
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,960
practically in the world to take on the

1677
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,720
medical medium and do the medical medium

1678
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,520
series the medical medium show

1679
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,799
i've been asked all every network you

1680
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,960
name the network

1681
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,799
they've asked me okay and they've asked

1682
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,480
me for 15

1683
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:18,160
years 15 plus years i've been asked

1684
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:21,920
long before social media i mean

1685
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,480
15 plus years before social media right

1686
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,040
and

1687
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,680
um and i've turned it down because i

1688
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,839
feel like

1689
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,440
once it gets you in that rat race once

1690
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,040
they get you in that

1691
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,559
then you're screwed because you're gonna

1692
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,040
be so wrapped up in that

1693
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,000
that like that rat race they put you in

1694
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,240
you're not going to be able to help

1695
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,520
people like really help people you're

1696
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,880
you're not going to be able to

1697
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,720
be personable you're not you're not

1698
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,000
going to be able to break bread with

1699
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,280
your people because that's what i like

1700
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,240
doing with you guys is breaking bread

1701
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,640
with you guys

1702
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,599
and those days ago they'll just be gone

1703
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,280
next thing you know you got to get a

1704
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,319
publicist see i don't have i don't do

1705
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,680
that

1706
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,760
i've been told a million times you need

1707
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,599
pr you need publicist because you're

1708
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,440
you're well known in the world you're

1709
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,359
blah blah celebrity or whatever the heck

1710
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,640
i'm told that all the time but the

1711
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,160
minute you do that and then they're

1712
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,599
going to force the publicist on your

1713
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,920
force and then the publicist is gonna

1714
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,000
say

1715
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,680
don't you go near those dirty people

1716
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,240
don't you go near those dirty little

1717
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,400
people

1718
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,160
don't you go near all those fans they're

1719
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,760
they're just fans that's what they are

1720
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,160
cause that's your publicist will do be

1721
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,160
like

1722
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,760
those are just fans you just stay away

1723
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,760
from them don't talk to them

1724
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,599
don't be transparent you're just you're

1725
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,280
in your big tv show now and that's what

1726
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,240
they'll do and i'm like i'm not going

1727
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,440
that's not

1728
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,359
my people are my people and meaning like

1729
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,880
you know what i mean it's like you guys

1730
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,799
are family so it's like

1731
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,400
no i don't want to go and do that and

1732
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,280
that's why i've turned it down because i

1733
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,040
remember

1734
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,359
many years ago been asked to do the

1735
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,040
major networks make ask do tv shows and

1736
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,240
there's a disconnect that happens once

1737
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,040
you start going there

1738
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,680
and that disconnect takes you away from

1739
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,520
you know

1740
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,799
the people who matter in the world and

1741
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,359
getting them better you

1742
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:55,119
you you know unless it's done right and

1743
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,599
i haven't found that

1744
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,280
that way to do it but that's how because

1745
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,799
what i've done is focused on the books

1746
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,280
so i was worried that the

1747
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,640
tv careers and those big careers and

1748
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,000
netflix careers and all the big

1749
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,440
you know which are hey they're great for

1750
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,480
somebody else maybe but i was always

1751
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,599
worried that

1752
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,200
though that career sector would take

1753
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,880
away from

1754
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,640
me sitting in my office at my desk

1755
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,720
and making sure you can save your life

1756
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,880
with these books i was afraid that

1757
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,960
once i start doing all that tv heavy tv

1758
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,400
stuff there's no getting these books out

1759
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,760
to you guys anymore to save your lives

1760
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,000
this book has saved millions of lives

1761
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,520
around

1762
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,200
the world right here the original book

1763
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,200
this is the new edition

1764
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,319
and and it's and i'm not going to get a

1765
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,079
chance to tell you about the best

1766
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,880
supplements you think if i do a tv show

1767
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,880
i can tell you

1768
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,000
what the best vitamin c is the vimergy

1769
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,799
the microc and the

1770
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,680
the curcumin there's no way like it

1771
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:48,960
won't be a chance to do that

1772
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,000
so anyway it was all about focusing on

1773
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,680
writing the books

1774
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,760
and that's why and you know and i was i

1775
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:59,359
in and i've been asked to write them

1776
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,640
from people who are in need and

1777
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,040
you know and i didn't want that

1778
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,839
disconnect the disconnect that happens

1779
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:07,040
when you

1780
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,839
go to tv land and now your fans are just

1781
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,480
you know it's

1782
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:11,839
it's i don't like that you know it's

1783
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,720
it's not it's not about that because
