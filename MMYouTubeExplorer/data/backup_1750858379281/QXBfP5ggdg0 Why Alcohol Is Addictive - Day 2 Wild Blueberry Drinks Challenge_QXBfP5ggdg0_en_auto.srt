wild blueberry drinks challenge we got a

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,420
lot of fun ahead of us here we're gonna

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,600
be making three drinks I want to read

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,800
about why alcohol is addictive you guys

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,239
you know I was talking about alcohol

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,680
yesterday

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,920
and it was really mind-blowing

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,780
information so I'm on page 160 right

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,640
here in brain saver so make sure you

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,979
have your book so you can read along

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,840
with me because that'll be fun so I'm

31
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,060
reading this part right here the

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,920
intoxication element so this is

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,979
mind-blowing information

34
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,040
the effect of alcohol on the brain isn't

35
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,439
solely from this trick sugar effect now

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,540
yesterday I was talking about how it's

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,759
the ghost of sugar it's the trick sugar

38
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,500
effect that the brain gets tricked with

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,600
and then you starve your brain of

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,220
glucose as you're drinking all of it you

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,720
guys know I covered it yesterday now

42
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,340
this is live right now this is not a

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,560
pre-recorded episode right here we're

44
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,299
live in the moment so the effect of

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,220
alcohol in the brain isn't solely from

46
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,560
this trick sugar effect where the brain

47
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,079
becomes starved a valuable glucose

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,619
because our brain runs on sugar glucose

49
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,259
alcohol is indeed a poison and as a

50
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,840
poison it does have an effect that can

51
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,360
be intoxicating and debilitating

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,700
yet the slurred speech when someone is

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,399
on their third drink is because the

54
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,560
brain is starting to starve from glucose

55
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,420
and therefore losing the ability to

56
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,219
function so when you're on your third

57
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,280
drink or your second drink depending on

58
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,739
the person your brain's already starting

59
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,160
to starve of glucose it's going into

60
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,440
glucose deprivation now we're going to

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,540
talk about why alcohol is so addictive

62
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,520
and it's important to know why that

63
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,739
happens because nobody knows they just

64
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,540
don't know that out there they just know

65
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,580
that people can get addicted to alcohol

66
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,920
and drinking and then they end up on a

67
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,080
park bench or their lives get destroyed

68
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,239
or their family's lives get destroyed or

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,040
something terrible happens or whatever

70
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,360
it is or they just get killed drunk

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,700
driving or kill somebody else drunk

72
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,140
driving whatever it is their lives can

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,400
change when they get addicted to the

74
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,280
alcohol right

75
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,000
and so but that's one aspect of it but

76
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,099
why are they so addicted to alcohol why

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,260
have you seen people out there so

78
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,599
addicted to alcohol right so that's the

79
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,660
whole thing too we're covering so when

80
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,239
inebriation becomes extreme and drastic

81
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,840
and someone drinks so much that they

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,000
collapse conk out and fall asleep that

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,640
drunken sleep is a game of Russian

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,440
Roulette this is mind-blowing as to why

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,420
I'm going to go into it right now

86
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,720
because if the brain doesn't get any

87
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,420
glucose at all due to the intensity of

88
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,180
intoxication the brain can actually

89
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,220
starve and that person can die in their

90
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,260
sleep you ever hear of those stories

91
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,300
right where it's like drank too much

92
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,760
drank too much and died in their sleep

93
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,280
because they literally were that

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,459
intoxicated so I'm talking about why

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,500
that happens it's because the brain

96
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:41,159
literally starved completely of glucose

97
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,900
and so the brain died that's it's

98
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,459
incredible information right here if you

99
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,560
guys just got on here where day two of

100
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,019
the wild blueberry drinks challenge I'm

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,819
reading about alcohol why alcohol is

102
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,019
addictive I'm breathing right out of

103
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,659
brain saver

104
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,720
on page 160 we're gonna also make some

105
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,459
drinks in a little while too some

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,260
non-alcoholic drinks so if you guys have

107
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,299
trouble viewing go to medicalmedium.com

having a problem on YouTube or

111
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,159
something's happening there or whatever

112
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,140
it is that you're seeing this

113
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,900
um live event right now go to

114
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:20,040
medicalmedium.com because I'm streaming

115
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,019
this live at medicalmedium.com right now

116
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,360
so

117
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,160
you here's another thing too or due to

118
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,500
alcohol poisoning one aspect of

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,120
inebriation that's not about lack of

120
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,580
glucose

121
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,919
they need they may need to vomit so I

122
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,300
want to go into that information too and

123
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,979
it's like hey well why are we talking

124
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,960
about this because this is the time of

125
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,759
year I'm seeing a lot more alcohol use

126
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,320
this time of year alcohol has destroyed

127
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,240
a lot of lives

128
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,340
I think a big part of why alcohol

129
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,259
destroys a lot of lives is the lack of

130
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,419
information about what it does to the

131
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,520
brain how it works because what happens

132
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,340
is when someone reads this information

133
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,280
and they know how alcohol poisons the

134
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,080
brain right and destroys the brain when

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
they learn why it's happening or how

136
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,639
it's happening it actually can stop

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,380
somebody from grabbing a drink so this

138
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,060
is powerful information for anybody

139
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,639
who's struggling and they're kind of on

140
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,860
the edge of drinking or not drinking

141
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,020
so we'll go into this a little bit more

142
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,639
so it's like a game of Russian Roulette

143
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,040
right because if the brain doesn't get

144
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,900
any glucose at all do you do to the

145
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,580
intensity of intoxication the brain can

146
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,580
actually starve and that person can die

147
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:31,940
in their sleep that's from being so

148
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:35,340
intoxicated that not a single like bit

149
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,820
of glucose gets to the brain anymore so

150
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,680
the person dies in their sleep

151
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,660
from glucose deprivation to the point

152
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,580
where their brain can't get glucose

153
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,780
anymore and then it dies

154
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,360
right

155
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,639
now you can die of alcohol poisoning too

156
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,340
if you're so overloaded with alcohol

157
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,100
because it is a poison so you can die

158
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,900
that way too but that essentially just

159
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,699
blocks out all glucose so you end up

160
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,539
dying of glucose deprivation no matter

161
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,300
what

162
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,400
so as the brain is dying from a lack of

163
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,919
glucose the nerves are not functioning

164
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,620
optimally the vagus nerves can become

165
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,199
paralyzed as the brain is losing

166
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,780
is the brain is is losing deeper glucose

167
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,460
reserves so as we lose those glucose

168
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,680
reserves to the brain because we're

169
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,319
inebriated because we're drunk because

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,240
we're drinking the vagus nerves get

171
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,840
affected so what you're seeing are

172
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,699
symptoms of the vagus nerves so if you

173
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,580
see somebody in there at a party

174
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,160
and they're Tipsy or they're partially

175
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,819
drunk really what you're saying is like

176
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,259
whoa your vagus nerves are actually

177
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,819
they're actually not functioning

178
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,860
properly that's what you're seeing which

179
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,139
is incredible information

180
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,539
you know whether anybody likes it or not

181
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,580
this is Advanced unique original medical

182
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,380
medium information it's there's no

183
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,900
studies out there there's nothing out

184
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,840
there about it it's the books are all

185
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,000
original info they're you know the

186
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,800
clinics don't know this medical research

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
and science doesn't know how it works

188
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,419
and how everything happens they just

189
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,979
don't know this about alcohol and that

190
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,720
information about the Vega service being

191
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,759
involved like being paralyzed that's

192
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,740
medical medium information and reading

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,380
right now so the vagus nerves can become

194
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,560
paralyzed as the brain is losing deeper

195
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:23,160
glucose reserves meaning that as someone

196
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,500
is vomiting in their sleep it's easier

197
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,039
to choke and die

198
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,020
so someone's vomiting in their sleep the

199
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,960
reason why they end up choking on their

200
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,639
vomit in their sleep and end up dying is

201
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,800
their vagus nerves

202
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,319
stopped working

203
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,780
that's how it works so if you're not at

204
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,580
that stage of vomiting if you're not at

205
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,740
that stage of being that drunk and

206
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,380
you're at a party or you're at at a

207
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,259
gathering so I'm on page 160 right now

208
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,020
if you're if you're somewhere

209
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,180
and you're drinking and someone's like

210
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,099
Tipsy or they're like a little bit

211
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,960
they're slurring their speech and

212
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,180
they're partially drunk

213
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,000
that's their vagus nerves so it's not

214
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,220
like hey man you're drunk dude dude man

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,440
you're drunk man it's more like choose

216
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,120
your Vegas nerves aren't working

217
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,800
because your various nerves are like

218
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,560
being paralyzed man because that's

219
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,599
really what it is it's like Yo dude

220
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,280
your vagus nerves you know like at a

221
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,840
college party it's like your vagus

222
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,160
nerves aren't working man they're

223
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
paralyzed

224
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,180
because that's what's really happening

225
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,879
it's not like dude you're drunk here's

226
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,300
your face it's more like it's like more

227
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,099
like yo man you're uh your vagus nerves

228
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,479
aren't working my Vegas nerves aren't

229
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,399
working anymore they're actually

230
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,860
stopping the work

231
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,140
exactly I don't know what this is I just

232
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,360
thought I was Tipsy you know but

233
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,260
but really what's happening is the vagus

234
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,600
nerves aren't working that's what's

235
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,620
happening

236
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,779
so as your as our brain is dying from

237
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,220
glucose deprivation because we're

238
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,760
drinking

239
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,760
right

240
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:10,200
the symptoms we're getting

241
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,120
is vagus nerve paralysis

242
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,980
so that's what's going on

243
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,140
so when you're at a party

244
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,019
or if you see like if you see a guy on a

245
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,660
park bench and they like drank all night

246
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,940
it's like and they're like rolling

247
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,760
around on the bench and they're barely

248
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,880
functional that's Vegas nerve paralysis

249
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,260
so paralysis of the vagus nerves and

250
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,300
that's what's going on

251
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,620
so when the cops pull somebody over and

252
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,260
they get them to walk in a straight line

253
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,600
and they can't walk in a straight line

254
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,240
right because they're intoxicated what's

255
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,580
happening is it's the Vegas nurse and so

256
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,160
really is it's not just in the future

257
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,839
they'll probably maybe if science

258
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,640
research understands that the vagus

259
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,880
nerves are actually a big part of this

260
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,360
maybe they'll have equipment meaning

261
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:01,080
like you know technology to also test

262
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,120
somebody's vagus nerves strength to know

263
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,440
if they're intoxicated too like a lot of

264
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,360
different things can happen down the

265
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,820
road

266
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,860
so here's what happens when you get so

267
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,620
inebriated so drunk

268
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,320
and you're it's so intoxicated the rush

269
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,839
of roulette occurs I saw somebody asking

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,300
about the book that's brain saver right

271
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,080
there just so you know there's a sale on

272
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,720

biggest sale I've ever seen yet on brain

278
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,800
saver and brain saver protocols I'm

279
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,300
letting you know but I want to give you

280
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,839
a forewarning

281
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,240
okay the books are heavy they're packed

282
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,240
they're like two massive Bibles the

283
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,740
information is really intense it's

284
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,740
eye-opening it's mind-blowing

285
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,480
information from above it's original you

286
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,040
won't be able to read that anywhere else

287
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,899
and I'm just giving you those kind of

288
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,220
like little disclaimers right there of

289
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,019
what you're up against when you get the

290
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,140
brain saver books

291
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,820
and the best part is they work the brain

292
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,120
shot therapies work they're life

293
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,220
changing they're like Miracles that's

294
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,260
just like and and the other information

295
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,019
and all the other stuff and the heavy

296
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,200
metal detox lenses of it it works

297
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,360
okay ready guys eating enough glucose

298
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
rich foods and keeping your fats low is

299
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,920
important before a shrinking night so

300
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,140
you have ample storage bins of glucose

301
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,140
freshly available

302
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,779
so eating ample amounts of glucose

303
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,040
before your drinking night and I know

304
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,200
like a lot of you guys aren't going to

305
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,700
be revved up for a drinking night

306
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
but yeah and you know what's funny

307
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,500
medical people say how medical medium is

308
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,959
common sense medical medium information

309
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,820
is not common sense because Common Sense

310
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,680
doesn't know this information because

311
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,839
it's not common

312
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,000
medical medium information just makes

313
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,459
sense that's really what is it actually

314
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,579
just makes sense because the information

315
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:08,459
is is far from common if nobody's ever

316
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:10,500
seen it before so it's incredible and

317
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:12,600
the truth hits you it speaks to you and

318
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,180
it just stands out

319
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,040
eating enough glucose rich foods because

320
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,440
that glucose deprivation that happens

321
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,959
when we drink eating enough glucose rich

322
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,399
foods is really helpful before a

323
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,019
drinking night so if you're gonna be

324
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,640
partying man if you're going to be out

325
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,620
there partying like yeah no I'm going to

326
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,060
drink a lot of wine I'm going to my

327
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,060
friend's house and drink a lot of wine

328
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,339
or whatever's going on make sure you're

329
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,500
eating enough glucose rich foods a lot

330
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,360
of people they don't even do that of

331
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,240
course they don't know

332
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,339
so and keeping your fats low is

333
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,899
important too before drinking night so

334
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,540
you have ample storage bins of glucose

335
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,120
freshly available for your Noggin for

336
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:54,240
your brain this is why when someone says

337
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,360
I'm drinking on an empty stomach

338
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,000
I haven't eaten today you'll see them

339
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,399
get buzzed faster

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,880
now medical research and science has no

341
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,399
idea why someone gets buzzed faster

342
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,380
they don't know

343
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,240
it's just

344
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:16,500
we all know

345
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,839
that we get buzzed faster on an empty

346
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,940
stomach look naturally we know that

347
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,160
didn't eat all day and then you just go

348
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:27,120
into some hard liquor you're gonna give

349
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,620
us real real fast okay so I'm drinking

350
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,079
on an empty stomach I haven't eaten

351
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,779
today you'll see them get buzzed faster

352
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,839
showing those first effects of drinking

353
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,880
early we think this Buzz

354
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,500
this tipsiness check this out you guys

355
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,639
it's because the brain becomes

356
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,639
intoxicated with alcohol

357
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,220
that's why we think we're getting a buzz

358
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,740
quicker really an alcohol Buzz is a

359
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,000
brain starving of glucose so here's

360
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,120
what's happening you're not eating all

361
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,519
day your brain is already low on glucose

362
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,380
or you're not eating hardly anything the

363
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,940
day before you drink the day the day

364
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,220
you're drinking

365
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,680
your brain is already in glucose

366
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,920
deprivation it's starving from glucose

367
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,560
it actually leaves glucose desperately

368
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,940
so we think this Buzz this tipsiness is

369
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,040
because the brain becomes intoxicated

370
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,440
with alcohol yeah well no I'm drinking

371
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,720
my brain's getting intoxicated really an

372
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,760
alcohol Buzz is a brain starving glucose

373
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,579
the liver is starting to mop up the

374
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,920
alcohol so as that party night starts to

375
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:31,620
happen our liver is actually starting to

376
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,200
mop up the alcohol so it's not releasing

377
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,779
glucose anymore that means even your own

378
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,639
liver loses all its ability to release

379
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,220
the glucose reserves you see how it

380
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,620
works you guys so here you don't eat all

381
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,019
day then you start drinking you get

382
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,899
buzzed faster that's because the liver

383
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:52,139
shuts down and starts to mop up all that

384
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:54,060
alcohol really fast and in an instant it

385
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,800
stops releasing glucose so now your

386
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,540
brain is really not getting glucose

387
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,180
there's no glucose in your bloodstream

388
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,459
your liver is not releasing anymore and

389
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,139
you start drinking and boom you get hit

390
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,880
with that buzz faster

391
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:09,000
and that's what science research does it

392
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,740
know they don't know how that works

393
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,779
it's incredible information

394
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,519
so really an alcohol Buzz is a brain

395
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,500
starving glucose the liver starting to

396
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,420
mop all the alcohol up so it's not

397
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,959
releasing glucose anymore and because

398
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,940
someone didn't eat they also don't have

399
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,480
freshly available glucose in the

400
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,820
bloodstream for someone who did eat that

401
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,339
day to someone who actually ate that day

402
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,019
it takes longer for the alcohol to

403
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,060
affect them as they start drinking

404
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,579
because they at least have that fresh

405
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,560
glucose for the brain so someone if you

406
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:42,839
take two people one person didn't eat

407
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,699
that day and they and the other person

408
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,459
ate that day and they went to the same

409
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,440
party and their livers were fairly in

410
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:51,600
the same amount of condition and they're

411
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,180
roughly around the same ages

412
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,160
one dude is going to get drunk way

413
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,920
faster than the other dude the other

414
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,199
dude that actually ate that day is gonna

415
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,199
get drunk not as fast right

416
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,000
it takes a larger volume of alcohol for

417
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,279
intoxication to come into it that is for

418
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,500
the poison aspect of alcohol to play a

419
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,860
role in someone's symptoms even then

420
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,620
drunkenness is part of intoxication

421
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,360
by alcohol and part brain starving of

422
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,740
glucose so I'm going to read this next

423
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,820
part it's pretty cool

424
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,800
a drunkenness we're only about

425
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:31,320
intoxication of alcohol

426
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,839
the symptoms would be limited someone

427
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,180
would be nauseous vomiting feel sick in

428
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,440
the head feel dizzy yet while greatly

429
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:42,360
sick they would still be coherent

430
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,420
see the difference

431
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,040
you would still be coherent

432
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,019
and that's something science research

433
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,040
missed

434
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:56,899
you can still get alcohol poisoning

435
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,899
but be completely coherent

436
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,079
that's an incredible piece of

437
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,079
information if drunkenness were only

438
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:06,900
about intoxication of alcohol

439
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,699
if it was only just about alcohol being

440
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,699
poisonous

441
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,040
if being drunk was only just about the

442
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,679
alcohol itself

443
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,079
the symptoms would be limited

444
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,839
someone would be nauseous because they

445
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,799
were poisoned from alcohol

446
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,360
vomiting because they were poisoned from

447
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,559
alcohol feel sick in the head because

448
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,679
they were poisoned from alcohol feel

449
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:31,080
dizzy yet while greatly sick they would

450
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,419
still be coherent

451
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,760
you see the difference

452
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,860
that's just incredible when I heard that

453
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,299
from SOC when I got that information was

454
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,380
writing it down this book because you

455
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,820
can't find that anywhere it doesn't

456
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,320
exist when I was getting that

457
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:48,919
information and putting I was just mind

458
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,919
blown I didn't know that I did not know

459
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,600
that if it was just the alcohol aspect

460
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,500
of alcohol you'd be completely coherent

461
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,500
you would just feel sick

462
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,919
that's an incredible piece of

463
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,240
information I mean maybe look maybe

464
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,580
someone doesn't think that's like

465
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,940
interesting but I find that really

466
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,880
interesting it's really unbelievable

467
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,580
okay so check this out it's the

468
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,140
starvation of the brain happening at the

469
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,059
same time that leads to the loss of

470
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,799
motor skill function slurred speech and

471
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:21,299
other difficulty speaking not

472
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,640
understanding what someone is saying

473
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,260
like when you're drunk say what what is

474
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,520
that what

475
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,620
I know

476
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,700
you know I've been like your best friend

477
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,320
forever

478
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,260
like we're like the greatest friends

479
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,000
ever like right like you know like we

480
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,440
just met an hour ago but I feel like

481
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,260
you're like the best friend I've ever

482
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,940
had I know we just met like an hour ago

483
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,240
in this bar

484
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,880
but honestly like I feel like knowing

485
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,380
you my whole lifetime

486
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,840
if it was

487
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:56,960
if it was just alcohol that would not

488
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,960
happen if you were just alcohol poisoned

489
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,480
you would be completely coherent like

490
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,280
this you would just be like hold on you

491
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,720
guys I have to vomit

492
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,039
hold on you guys I'm feeling really

493
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,960
nauseous

494
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,820
you guys I got alcohol poisoning but

495
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,520
yeah I could drive home I could drive

496
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,200
home with alcohol poisoning because I'm

497
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,880
totally coherent it's just that I might

498
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,679
have to puke so just hang on for a

499
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,660
minute in the car but you would be

500
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,500
completely coherent

501
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,480
but because it's not just about alcohol

502
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:27,059
intoxication it's not just about

503
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,919
being intoxicated with alcohol it's more

504
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,720
than that it's the starvation of the

505
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,880
brain getting glucose and that's

506
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,740
something nobody knows either that it's

507
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,140
a starvation factor of not getting

508
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,120
glucose to the brain that makes you get

509
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,880
into the place of symptoms showing

510
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,000
symptoms that are slurred speech

511
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,460
showing symptoms of not being coherent

512
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,020
not hearing and receiving information

513
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,720
properly

514
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,720
by having outbursts of anger or whatever

515
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,780
it is it's all involved right there

516
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,179
those are symptoms of the brain starving

517
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,660
to death and that's the symptoms of

518
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:06,600
glucose not getting to the brain

519
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,740
it's just incredible

520
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,080
so

521
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,059
you lose motor skill function without

522
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,679
the glucose you get the slurred speech

523
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,539
and other difficulty speaking and not

524
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,820
understanding what someone is saying and

525
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,400
at the same time saying things you don't

526
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,500
know you're saying as the brain is

527
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,299
getting very little glucose on the edge

528
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,120
of staying alive certain parts of the

529
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:29,400
brain start to shut down so here's what

530
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,559
you're witnessing because the brain is

531
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,000
starving to death of glucose which is

532
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,940
sugar

533
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,100
and you're drinking what you what you're

534
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,460
witnessing with symptoms is somebody's

535
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,740
brain dying and actually shutting down

536
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,299
different parts of their brain is

537
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,960
actually shutting down if you guys just

538
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:50,580
got on here we're on page 161

539
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,080
which is really cool we're in brain

540
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,039
saver right now we're talking about the

541
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,039
brain we're talking about alcohol

542
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,440
alcohol addiction how it's even possible

543
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:00,059
to be addicted to alcohol all of it like

544
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,360
we're cutting into it this is really

545
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:05,700
cool we're also making three drinks

546
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,160
we've got lots of bottles of vodka no we

547
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,260
don't that's a joke kidding but we're

548
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,059
making non-alcohol drinks right which is

549
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,980
really cool we got the Wild blueber and

550
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,020
today is day two of the wild blueberry

551
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,940
drinks challenge so we're gonna have

552
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,400
some fun I got the blender out I got the

553
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,020
juicer out I got the well even warmer

554
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,059
out right here there's a lot of cool

555
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,679
stuff going on I got the wild blueberry

00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,080
juice I don't know if you guys seen it's

557
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,159
10 off at Wyman's check out the link in

558
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,559
the description

559
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,539
and the link in the profile right that's

560
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,860
the wild blueberry juice the wild

561
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,780
blueberry juice you guys know I work

562
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,960
with these guys because I want to keep

563
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:42,480
this stuff around forever because it is

564
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,820
incredible I call this stuff medicine it

565
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,919
is unbelievable how they they get this

566
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,140
wild food out of the field and they

567
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,380
press it so we could actually have this

568
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:55,200
in our lives even a little bit of this a

569
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,720
day even just like a small amount every

570
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,059
day those anthocyanins going in is

571
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,400
critical because you're looking at

572
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:04,559
anthocyanins right there it's charged

573
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,240
man anyway

574
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,880
it's just so cool

575
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,799
so let's get into this part now

576
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,020
misguided hangover cures I like this

577
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,700
part this is fun

578
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,000
a hangover

579
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:21,360
like drunkenness itself is part from

580
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,679
starvation of glucose that hangover you

581
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,600
get

582
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,240
the next day

583
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,100
that's part of being starved of glucose

584
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,980
to the brain

585
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,900
apart from intoxication of alcohol too

586
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,659
meaning

587
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:40,380
your your alcohol sick right

588
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:42,900
the worst approach for Recovery is to

589
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,760
drink again the next day how many times

590
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,200
have you guys heard that before I just

591
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,780
want to ask you guys this question have

592
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,200
you heard that before where if you got a

593
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:55,380
hangover you party the night before that

594
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,120
drink the next morning it'll help have

595
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,520
you heard that one I'm just curious so

596
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,320
I'm hoping you guys get that I hope you

597
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,480
can respond to that one

598
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,400
have you like heard that one before like

599
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,860
just drink the next morning just drink

600
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,039
the next day like when you wake up just

601
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,840
crack open a beer you know by like noon

602
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,360
time if you still got that hangover just

603
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,159
get the Vodka out and just get something

604
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,679
out right have you guys heard that whole

605
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:23,340
little bit of information out there

606
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,559
so the worst but listen to this okay

607
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,360
coming from SLC because it's in the

608
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,120
books right here

609
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,340
the worst approach for Recovery is to

610
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,440
drink again the next day

611
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,600
so here's what's really cool about

612
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,440
getting the information above it's not

613
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,679
man-made so it's free of like all the

614
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,480
guessing games okay because some poor

615
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,240
sap is just gonna keep on drinking the

616
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,520
next day and that's not gonna be good

617
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,140
so when Spirit was giving me the

618
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,880
information right here about this I was

619
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,799
like this is so incredible

620
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,360
the worst approach for Recovery is to

621
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,980
drink again the next day even though

622
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,159
that's the advice given to many people

623
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:04,460
who drink that is the advice I've seen

624
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,220
professionals advise

625
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:11,580
their clients and their patients to

626
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,940
drink the next morning to try to avoid a

627
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,940
hangover

628
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,539
well I got news it doesn't shake a

629
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,460
hangover because once again you're

630
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:22,740
starving the brain of glucose so now

631
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,419
you're going into the next day and

632
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,520
you're now starving the brain of glucose

633
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:29,039
again so instead of helping you out of a

634
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,900
hangover you're actually killing your

635
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,840
brain the next morning and I've seen

636
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,720
professionals recommend drinking some a

637
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,280
little bit the next morning when really

638
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,480
those professionals have no idea and

639
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,760
this is how the guessing game World

640
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,740
works and you can take this in any

641
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,240
aspect of alternative medicine health or

642
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,039
whatever about guessing games in general

643
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,500
right you guys know the history of

644
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,500
guessing games out there so

645
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,539
that alone is starting now to Now kill

646
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,360
the brain because it's lacking glucose

647
00:24:54,539 --> 00:25:00,539
the brain starts to die again

648
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,120
the reason people tend to gorge on food

649
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:06,900
the day after drinking is because their

650
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,400
brain is asking for what it's asking for

651
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,580
glucose

652
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,860
that's why people Gorge it's another

653
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,380
reason why people Gorge at two three

654
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:19,980
o'clock in the morning at a diner

655
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:22,860
their brain is desperate for glucose

656
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:26,400
it was so deprived they were drunk a

657
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:28,080
little too long which is drunk at all

658
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,880
and they were depriving the brain of

659
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,559
glucose so it was starving so that

660
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,480
moment comes

661
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,520
so the reason people tend to gorge on

662
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,679
all that diner food were their pancakes

663
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,860
and everything else and eggs and hash

664
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,120
browns with oil and sausage and desserts

665
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,440
and everything else in chocolate cake

666
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,799
whatever they could find right inside

667
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,260
diners is because their brain is dying

668
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,299
and it's asking for glucose depending on

669
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,400
how much alcohol someone consumed the

670
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:57,320
brain narrowly missed starving to death

671
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:59,880
from a lack of glucose keep that in mind

672
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,700
people who are actually drunk

673
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,900
their brain almost completely starves to

674
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,960
death

675
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,659
so now the organ sends messaging

676
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,059
throughout the body that it needs large

677
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,039
amounts of glucose desperately and

678
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:16,380
immediately and that's why a lot of

679
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,360
people scoff down a lot of diner food in

680
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,279
the middle of the night two three in the

681
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,960
morning it's not because they're really

682
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,539
hungry

683
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:29,940
they may be hungry too but it's because

684
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:32,400
the brain is begging for glucose

685
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,440
this is really cool at the same time

686
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,659
someone could still be nauseous from the

687
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,360
alcohol feeling sick to the stomach and

688
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:42,480
they can't really hold down food yet

689
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,159
they'll still scoff down food I've seen

690
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,159
a lot of people where they're on that

691
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,200
they're not even past the drunken stage

692
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,260
and they're in a diner and they're just

693
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,539
scoffing it down sending it down that

694
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,000
queasy part of a hangover is from toxic

695
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:59,640
the toxic nature of alcohol

696
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,740
many people don't drink to the point of

697
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,260
nausea and vomiting they are still

698
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,299
looking to scarf down food to sober up

699
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,520
I've seen people just do a couple of

700
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:10,919
drinks at a party at dinner party where

701
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,840
they had a couple glasses of wine and

702
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,640
then when the party was over and they're

703
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,440
clean say they hosted the party and

704
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,539
they're cleaning up everything they're

705
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,679
now like scoffing at three o'clock in

706
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,240
the morning they're eating whatever

707
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,159
they're eating their leftover hors

708
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,700
d'oeuvres they're eating the appetizers

709
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:29,279
they're they're scoffing it down

710
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,140
the same night they drank they're

711
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,059
looking for a diner and there's people

712
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,919
that look for diners or drive-throughs

713
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:37,260
at two or five o'clock in the morning

714
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,840
ordering a whole stack of pancakes with

715
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,700
maple syrup toast eggs bacon waffles

716
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,020
hash browns burgers fries tacos or

717
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,460
burritos

718
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,860
a friend of mine's always like going for

719
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,539
the tacos and burritos you know always

720
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,940
tells me well yeah I know I got drunk

721
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,559
and yeah you know I'm like what are you

722
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,720
gonna get when are you gonna get free

723
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,059
from that stuff a lot of people they

724
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,400
just don't want to let it go

725
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,620
say this doctor friend some people yeah

726
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,299
doctors drink just so you know a lot of

727
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,340
doctors drink out there some people get

728
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,320
confused glucose is not the problem it's

729
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,460
what the brain needs so let's make sure

730
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,679
that's straight

731
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,539
glucose isn't causing any of the

732
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,679
problems it's the brain dying and having

733
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:18,000
a lack of glucose it needs glucose

734
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,919
and here's another thing or they're

735
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,659
turning to ample food the next day so if

736
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,520
they don't do it that night they got

737
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,400
drunk they went to sleep

738
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,440
the next day it's scoff City it's like

739
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,539
tank the Food City

740
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,820
you know and people are all on the high

741
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:34,559
fat diet so they have glucose issues

742
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,179
already they have glucose deficiencies

743
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,679
already so let's get into it a little

744
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,840
bit more

745
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,159
the common phrase is sopping up the

746
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,279
alcohol have you guys heard that before

747
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,799
like let's sop up the alcohol

748
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,600
let's sop it up

749
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,159
you know that's that's what happens out

750
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,740
there you better eat something man you

751
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,720
got to stop up the alcohol you gotta you

752
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,299
know you got to stop up that whiskey

753
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,880
it even happens when someone is actively

754
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,919
drinking out at a party or a bar when a

755
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,260
companion says you've got to eat

756
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,179
something to stop up that alcohol have

757
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,659
you heard that before

758
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:11,760
what no one realizes is that eating food

759
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:13,740
after drinking alcohol is actually about

760
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,539
getting glucose to the brain so it can

761
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,400
come out of its starving State and start

762
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:19,320
to function again

763
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,120
the brain wants to start to function

764
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,340
again and it has to get out of that

765
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,440
starvation stage

766
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,240
because we misunderstand what's going on

767
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,460
in the brain and body we're still not

768
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,919
getting what our brain really needs and

769
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,140
here's another incredible part of this

770
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,720
information right here because we're

771
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,279
adding fat

772
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,940
mistakenly we reach for a combination of

773
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,679
carbohydrates plus fat

774
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,779
pancakes and sausage

775
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,200
pancakes with butter

776
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:51,960
we're mixing fats with carbohydrates

777
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,700
that's how it works cheeseburger fats

778
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,580
with carbohydrates the bun on the

779
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,020
cheeseburger the cheese itself fats and

780
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,120
carbohydrates

781
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,059
macaroni and cheese see people eat that

782
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,860
in diners fats and carbohydrates you got

783
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,779
the pasta and then you've got the cheese

784
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,000
and the oil

785
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:10,320
everybody's going for the wrong

786
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,380
combination

787
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,320
here our brain is starving to death

788
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,360
because we were drinking and then when

789
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,460
we do reach for food because our brain

790
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,159
is desperate and asking us to get food

791
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,340
as fast as possible we end up picking a

792
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:29,760
food that doesn't help the brain

793
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,799
and that's where we go wrong too

794
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,460
see Mystic mango said this is truly

795
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,460
amazing information

796
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,559
um arto says this is so interesting

797
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,840
incredible

798
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,520
Michelle says this chapter is amazing is

799
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,340
it this chapter is really mind-blowing

800
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,559
every time I read this chapter it's like

801
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:53,120
I get the same reaction I'm like I can't

802
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:53,120
believe this information

803
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,919
so because we misunderstand what's going

804
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,899
on in the brain and body we're still not

805
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,419
getting what our brain really needs

806
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:05,399
because we're adding fat mistakenly we

807
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:07,620
reach for a combination of carbohydrates

808
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:09,360
plus fat like I was saying and that fat

809
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,980
inhibits

810
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,159
the glucose

811
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:17,100
from getting to the brain

812
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,399
so we don't recover ourselves properly

813
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,539
we don't know how to bring glucose back

814
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,159
to the brain

815
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,480
we drink

816
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,659
we party

817
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,240
right that's what people do and then we

818
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:32,880
eat because our brain is crying for

819
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,000
glucose to save it because we did the

820
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,380
Russian Roulette we gave it glucose

821
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,740
deprivation

822
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,000
and now we end up eating foods that are

823
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,500
not really giving the brain enough

824
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,220
glucose again

825
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,840
so the brain's still struggling

826
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,720
here's something that's interesting for

827
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,940
example frying hash browns in oil hash

828
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,700
browns are not bad

829
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,840
if they're hash browns with no oil and

830
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,659
no fat

831
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,539
so if we fry hash browns in oil butter

832
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:07,340
and grease it inhibits the potatoes

833
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:07,340
glucose from easily getting to the brain

834
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,279
and by the way that's medical medium

835
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,799
information

836
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,460
for years

837
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:19,380
it's inhibiting no one knew that part

838
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,860
they didn't know that part

839
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,240
that the fat thrown on the potato is

840
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,460
what's stopping

841
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,100
the carbohydrate from the potato

842
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,840
from helping the person

843
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,700
it's mm info

844
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,620
from above

845
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,179
now we're getting insulin resistance

846
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,419
which is more medical meme information

847
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:41,520
nobody knew it was the fat causing

848
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,159
insulin resistance

849
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,179
that is medical medium info published

850
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,840
info

851
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:50,820
lectured info podcasted info

852
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,640
it's not sugar that creates insulin

853
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,140
resistance it's fat that creates insulin

854
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,580
resistance and you'll see more of that

855
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,960
out there as people poach that that's

856
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,760
actually being poached right now out

857
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,440
there for medical medium books

858
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,600
and this is going back more than you

859
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,360
know decades now this information he

860
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,399
said check this out and her body has to

861
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,580
fight to divide the sugar and fat so the

862
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,039
sugar can get get too much needed places

863
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,899
so here's how it works when you dump the

864
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,200
wrong combination of food inside your

865
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:22,019
body after drinking alcohol

866
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,000
your brain has to fight

867
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:26,460
to get the glucose because the

868
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,820
combinations are always fat plus sugar

869
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,880
Cookies Cakes Donuts macaroni and cheese

870
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,720
pasta pizza pasta with oil and fat and

871
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,840
cheese

872
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,039
sauce with oil fat eggs and bacon eggs

873
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,080
with butter

874
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:42,720
like it's it's all this different

875
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,120
combinations so as we're trying to

876
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,279
recover our brain is trying to actually

877
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,019
find glucose and it's fighting its way

878
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,019
through all those different combinations

879
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:55,799
it's not like we're trying to recover

880
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,980
from a drunken stupor by consuming fruit

881
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,980
such as banana you guys know anybody who

882
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:05,399
got totally

883
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,899
crab-faced totally drunk and they just

884
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:09,119
knew better like

885
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:12,480
they knew better to just use bananas as

886
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,300
their recovery or a papayas

887
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,619
or mineral salts from leafy greens and

888
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,619
celery juice

889
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:21,720
papayas and bananas like you know like

890
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:24,659
all of it instead we go for a plate of

891
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,359
eggs which is fat or we go for toast

892
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,440
with avocado that might be something

893
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,060
right there

894
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,639
so

895
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,520
someone will just do avocado toast on

896
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,859
the next morning right but they're still

897
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,260
mixing a fat with the carbohydrate

898
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:41,940
therefore the brain still has to

899
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,200
struggle getting that glucose to the

900
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,139
brain right

901
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,080
or oatmeal with nut butter or nut milk

902
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,240
or almond milk and avocado and nut

903
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,980
butter are both fats getting in the way

904
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,419
of glucose from the carbohydrates from

905
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,980
the toaster oatmeal now I'm not ripping

906
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:58,500
apart avocado that's not what I'm doing

907
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,300
I'm not saying you can't eat oatmeal I'm

908
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,359
saying that the combinations aren't the

909
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,119
correct ways to recover after drinking

910
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,900
this is Page 162 right now of brain

911
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,300

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:43,380
this information is just mind-blowing

925
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:45,480
across the board Pizza people do that's

926
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,240
sugar and fat it's often the most

927
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,220
popular go-to after drinking is pizza

928
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,680
and that's your fat and your

929
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,079
carbohydrate but yet it's not recovering

930
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,820
the brain fast enough babe if you're

931
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,500
young and indestructible and you haven't

932
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,000
experienced chronic illness yet or

933
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,280
anything else

934
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,380
and you don't have like mental health

935
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,000
conditions you're not suffering with

936
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,280
high anxiety and all these other things

937
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,619
in depression depersonalization and OCD

938
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,540
and you get drunk

939
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,560
and you just go for pizza every time

940
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,359
sure

941
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,339
feels like it works it's another day you

942
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,260
recover and that's it but it breaks you

943
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,520
down slowly and if you do have problems

944
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,260
like mental health issues or anything

945
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,359
else like all the different things that

946
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,220
are in the brain books then yeah this is

947
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:28,440
really bad and I see people do that out

948
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,599
there they got OCD and depression and

949
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,579
anxiety and they're still drinking

950
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,900
so we gotta make some drinks you guys

951
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:35,900
let's get going on that

952
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,520
so that's the brain saver information a

953
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:44,359
little bit on alcohol let's get started

954
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,820
I got three drinks to make I'm excited

955
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:49,380
so uh we got a lot of stuff out here

956
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,780
which is really cool

957
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,760
first thing is the wild the blueberry

958
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,440
and lime juice so it's the sparkling

959
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,400
wild blueberry and lime juice so I want

960
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,400
to get started with that

961
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,400
so to start with

962
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:04,680
I'm going to drop a little bit of

963
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,359
sparkling water in here I'm going to do

964
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,359
a quarter cup of sparkling water

965
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:15,000
so I'm going to kind of gauge right

966
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,880
there there we go that's quarter cup

967
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,300
nice these are options for holidays and

968
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,180
Gatherings without the alcohol

969
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,339
it's a good way to do it all right now

970
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,700
I'm going to do a cup of wild blueberry

971
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:28,700
juice

972
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,320
so Wyman's wild blueberry juice

973
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,960
incredible product

974
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:39,180
amazing actually really incredible in so

975
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,740
many ways so I'm going to drop a cup in

976
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,520
here

977
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,520
there we go

978
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,720
then I'm going to put a half a

979
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,420
tablespoon

980
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,920
of lime juice now I got a really ripe

981
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,920
lime so I want to show you this lime

982
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,079
now ripe limes are a whole nother world

983
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:02,880
you can use

984
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,440
well this one's actually partially ripe

985
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,359
which is really great so that's got the

986
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,920
green but it's also got the lighter

987
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,480
color on there the yellow so these are

988
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,820
partially ripe anyway so these are

989
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,160
amazing too but the real real green

990
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,500
limes they're they're not as good as

991
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,800
when they're ripe this is a really ripe

992
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,020
lime which is great so you take a look

993
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,140
and you'll see the difference right

994
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:27,300
really juicy it's got a color inside and

995
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,980
then the less ripe they are like the

996
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,220
green one right there let me just cut

997
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,220
that

998
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,220
seemed less ripe it's still juicy

999
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,859
because these are partially ripe if you

1000
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,079
look see the yellow on them but man like

1001
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,820
when they're really green it's hard to

1002
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,380
even squeeze energies out of them plus

1003
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,599
they're not really ripe they're more

1004
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,640
bitey they got like a bite to them

1005
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,920
they're not as sweet because there is

1006
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,780
such thing as a sweet lime and so that's

1007
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,880
what these are right here these are just

1008
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,359
great ones do a half a tablespoon of

1009
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,359
lime juice

1010
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,920
so grab a little tablespoon really quick

1011
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,920
out of here

1012
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,400
pretty easy

1013
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,400
so

1014
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,859
got that in there you guys

1015
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,859
awesome

1016
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,920
all right so that's the that's the

1017
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,140
recipe right there I'm just going to

1018
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,300
kind of mix it and then I'm gonna pour

1019
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,800
it now I'm gonna pour it into a

1020
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,460
champagne glass

1021
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,460
right here

1022
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,340
okay so I'm gonna get some in here like

1023
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,839
this

1024
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,500
[Music]

1025
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,500
nice

1026
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,460
perfect and then I'm going to cut a

1027
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,720
piece of

1028
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,720
lime right here

1029
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,800
or

1030
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,300
maybe I'll use a green

1031
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,560
one right here

1032
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,560
it's got a better look to it

1033
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,900
that is

1034
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,180
the wild sparkling wild blueberry lime

1035
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,700
juice right there take a look give you a

1036
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,859
little close-up on that maybe it'll

1037
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,960
show up there

1038
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:23,520
okay there we are you guys see that I'll

1039
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,599
pull it back here I'll put it up closer

1040
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,760
there we go whoa nice

1041
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,320
that's it right there

1042
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,940
I will sip it in a little while but I

1043
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,380
got two more drinks to bake so I'm gonna

1044
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,820
move this over

1045
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,820
I'll bring you back in there

1046
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,820
all right

1047
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,780
next one you guys

1048
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,220
brain shot therapy have you been doing

1049
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,560
the brain shot therapies this is the

1050
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:52,020
adrenal fight or flight stabilizer so

1051
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,200
that's what I'm making next

1052
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,200
foreign

1053
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:01,380
everything out for that I got a juicer

1054
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,280
right here so I'm going to use this real

1055
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,940
quick

1056
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,940
now

1057
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,040
let's go find this one

1058
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,240
here's what we're making

1059
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,700
does anybody need an adrenal fight or

1060
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,560
flight stabilizer during the holidays

1061
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,420
or are they extra stressed during the

1062
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,520
holidays you know I was debating with

1063
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,619
this one I was like look

1064
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,900
I was like

1065
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,700
is anybody gonna want one during this

1066
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,980
time it's not doesn't sound that fun

1067
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,800
does it but I think a lot of people

1068
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,500
their stress is really cranked up it's

1069
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,180
really amped up and because your stress

1070
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,040
is so amped up because of the holidays

1071
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,079
and everything going on that is actually

1072
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,339
a pretty good thing for them to have in

1073
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,540
their life

1074
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:52,079
so I'm going to make one

1075
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:55,880
right here so a little piece of Ginger

1076
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,880
is first let me do that

1077
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:04,760
I love this one I mean I do all the

1078
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,760
brain shots I love them all but um

1079
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,260
but I'm always under stress for so many

1080
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,619
reasons so it's actually really helpful

1081
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:17,180
to do this one so I'm gonna do a

1082
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,180
get my Ginger ready right here

1083
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,680
so I'm gonna pop this in here so one

1084
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,780
inch piece of fresh ginger right there

1085
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,060
that's first

1086
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,099
so

1087
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:32,640
I said my sister said

1088
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:34,380
on IG those brain shots make a huge

1089
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,079
difference in my chemical sensitivities

1090
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,240
yeah I just I'm honestly what these

1091
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:41,280
brain shots do for people I mean I'm not

1092
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,680
today's the why blueberry drinks

1093
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,320
challenge day you know but all I can say

1094
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,020
is you guys know if you've done these

1095
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,940
the brain shot therapies I mean insane

1096
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:54,420
what they do they're miracles from above

1097
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,760
I can't wait to do more about them

1098
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,859
it's just I don't know it actually

1099
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,900
there's a loss for words for it of what

1100
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:02,520
I've seen it's just miraculous that's

1101
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,160
the bottom line I don't even know how to

1102
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,900
size it up okay so one inch piece of

1103
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,940
fresh ginger right there I'm gonna just

1104
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,819
turn this on

1105
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,440
I'm gonna pop that in boom so you put

1106
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:15,359
that in your juicer

1107
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,579
don't even need this

1108
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,980
you don't need it let's go with a clove

1109
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:22,859
of garlic now I got a cool garlic

1110
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,780
sitting around somewhere already done

1111
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:27,480
pop that in there

1112
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:29,220
you can use a small clove of garlic

1113
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,980
you could have a big clove of garlic

1114
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,839
right but you don't want to use like a

1115
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,640
really large clove of garlic you don't

1116
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,900
want to use like the biggest clove you

1117
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,079
can find

1118
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,420
it's not a medium to small is good that

1119
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,760
works

1120
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,040
and we're doing the wild blueberry juice

1121
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,020
in this adrenal

1122
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,640
fight or flight stabilizer that's what

1123
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,260
we're using instead of the wild

1124
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,000
blueberry you know the Frozen wall

1125
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,980
blueberry so I'm going to go with the

1126
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,579
lemon half peel

1127
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:02,040
it's a tickle lemon I peeled it

1128
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:05,780
all right there's there's the other half

1129
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,780
I'm gonna drop this in there right now

1130
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,960
okay and then I'm gonna use some parsley

1131
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:18,619
now it's a cup of tightly packed parsley

1132
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,619
so I'm going to gauge that

1133
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:28,160
parsley that I grew

1134
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:28,160
I'm using the garden parsley that I have

1135
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,900
I love the adrenal fighter plate

1136
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,020
stabilizer

1137
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:40,380
I love how it feels the minute you drink

1138
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,900
it how it feels when it goes down

1139
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,740
just it's incredible

1140
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,420
foreign

1141
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,599
you guys do you have experience with

1142
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,640
this adrenal fight or flight stabilizer

1143
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:53,460
because it's really something to

1144
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:57,319
experience if you haven't

1145
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,319
okay now I'm gonna do a half cup of kale

1146
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,300
and engage it so I need a little bit

1147
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,300
more than that

1148
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,859
a little more

1149
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,780
now the option you'll see there's an

1150
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,780
option for a watermelon rind

1151
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:26,760
I actually have a watermelon on me right

1152
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:31,520
now

1153
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,520
so being that I have one I am going to

1154
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,359
I'm going to cut a piece of the Rind off

1155
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,359
right now

1156
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:47,119
you guys can see that and I'm gonna

1157
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,119
throw down some

1158
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,240
okay

1159
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,240
foreign

1160
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,400
fight or fight stabilizer

1161
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:16,859
I get happy knowing I'm about to drink

1162
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,500
it

1163
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:22,260
because I know the effects I know what

1164
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:26,480

1165
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:30,180
going to mix two teaspoons of wild

1166
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:33,440

there's a different feel you get

1218
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,599
when you're giving your brain what it

1219
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:26,940
needs

1220
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,880
and you're feeding your body and giving

1221
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,800

00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,839
know to make a combination

1226
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,540

1290
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:17,640
blueberry juice is a wild food and what

1291
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,980
that does and how incredible that is

1292
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,720
like seriously like this is another

1293
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,940
level if you're somebody that believes

1294
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,559
in food or you believe in food helping

1295
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,880
you heal if you're somebody that just

1296
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,400
got here and you're like what is he

1297
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,559
doing but I do believe in food know the

1298
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,960
difference of a wild food know the

1299
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:36,900
difference of like wild blueberries what

1300
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,300
this means and then if the food actually

1301
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,700
is pressed in the nutrients that are

1302
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,440
pressed out of it that literally fall

1303
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,420
into what you're looking at right here

1304
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,520
it's a whole different game whole

1305
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,140
different part of the healing world so

1306
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,300

1307
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,920

Dr Nesmith said it's not good at all

1593
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,020
he thinks it tastes terrible he would

1594
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,520
rather have a glass of wine personally

1595
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,619
he said

1596
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,720
what about this

1597
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:26,640

can I have some

1601
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:36,780
Dr Nesbitt just removed somebody's brain

1602
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,400
the other day

1603
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:40,799
he said it was an accident he thought

1604
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,119
they were a cadaver he thought that the

1605
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,400
nurse brought a cadaver into the

1606
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:47,460
operation room so he removed the brain

1607
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,020
without thinking about it

1608
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:50,940
and then he realized the person was

1609
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:53,039
alive and they were only there to get

1610
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:55,619
their appendix out

1611
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,539
it was a mistake

1612
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:59,940
um insurance cover it

1613
01:07:57,539 --> 01:08:02,059
Dr Nesbitt said that insurance covered

1614
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,059
it

1615
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,839
so he removed the brain

1616
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:12,780
okay but I think he needed quit surgery

1617
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:15,059
he says no never he's going to work he's

1618
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:16,980

01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,819
all the time what their illnesses and

1657
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,699
everything have compassion for yourself

1658
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:46,440
pat yourself on the back Dr Nesbitt what

1659
01:09:44,699 --> 01:09:48,960
do you have to say

1660
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,400
he says pat yourself on the head

1661
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,020
why

1662
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,140
should be thankful you still have a

1663
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:58,020
brain because you remove the brain in

1664
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:59,219
the operation room this morning when he

1665
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,960

01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:03,420

1667
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,440

1668
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:07,080
um

1669
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,400
after Nesbitt has OCD

1670
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,560
but you don't have depression right just

1671
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,840
OCD he says

1672
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,640
he's depressed if he doesn't drink

1673
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,080
but he's not depressed when he drinks

1674
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,520
what does that mean

1675
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,560
all right you guys

1676
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,960

1680
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,400
the medical meeting podcast at Apple

1681
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:30,360
podcast I did a swelling episode it's

1682
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,480
really packed with information

1683
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:36,120
information nobody knows

1684
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:37,800
and you know what I know people want to

1685
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:40,260
shame me all the time for saying that

1686
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:43,380
that nobody knows but what am I supposed

1687
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:45,780
to do like lie and say oh I researched

1688
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,699
somewhere and found it uh no

1689
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:51,540
it's medical medium information it's

1690
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:54,239
Unique and original and from above and

1691
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:57,000
I'm kind of tired of being shamed

1692
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:59,760
at this point for saying it

1693
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,739
um kind of tired of being shamed for you

1694
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,780
know first for saying where the

1695
01:11:01,739 --> 01:11:05,820
information comes from above it's like

1696
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:08,880
I've been discriminated against for so

1697
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:11,880
many years that it gets really old after

1698
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,679
a while am I supposed to lie and say

1699
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,380
that all the information that's in eight

1700
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,239
the eight volumes of books here

1701
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:20,760
is from some other source when there's

1702
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:22,380
when it's not when research designs

1703
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,420
didn't know any of it and it's all

1704
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:26,159
original from these books am I supposed

1705
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:27,480
to lie and pretend it came from

1706
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,699
somewhere else

1707
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,980
it came from above you don't have to

1708
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:33,540
believe it believe I'm a genius then

1709
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:35,880
okay

1710
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,380

1711
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,060

right

1713
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:44,159
and that's fine too whatever you want to

1714
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,719
believe but it comes from above

1715
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,040
