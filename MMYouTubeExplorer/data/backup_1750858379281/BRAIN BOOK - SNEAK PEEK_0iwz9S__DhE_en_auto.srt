25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,480
of minutes because it's so comprehensive

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,160
there's so much information

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,680
it is unbelievable so that's what i want

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,239
to do i'm live right here on tick tock

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,000
live on youtube live on facebook live on

30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,920
you know the whole nine yards live on

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,720
rumble so you guys i'm excited live on

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
telegram i'm really pumped about this so

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,920
you guys ordered it you won't be

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,320
disappointed you will not be

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,200
disappointed your brain will be so happy

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,200
when you receive these when you receive

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
these and the reason why and it's gonna

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
take a little while right before you get

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,640
your copy but the point is the reason

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,680
why i'm doing this now too is because if

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,920
you don't secure a copy there may not be

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
a copy for a very long time or for

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
months and so that's the whole thing you

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,960
want to reserve a copy of each one so

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,439
each one the brain saver protocols and

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,840
brain saver they're two

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,240
different books and their companion

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,600
books but two different books it's the

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,439
first time

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,479
the publisher was telling me authors

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,600
don't release two books at once they do

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,600
not release two books at once publishers

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,840
won't let an author release two books at

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,479
once that's number one number two is

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,159
authors don't have two books in them to

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,799
be released at once right but we know

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,119
how soc is the information just comes

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,560
down and comes down and doesn't stop so

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,120
this was gonna be a mega mega size 10 15

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,319
pound book so the publisher wanted to

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
split it

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,080
and then

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,640
that's what we did we split into two

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,840
massive books which is incredible each

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,080

multiple sclerosis seven years ago i

157
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,520
published

158
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,039
right

159
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,479
the cause of multiple sclerosis was

160
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
epstein-barr virus

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,759
now

162
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,560

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,440
the medical medium information okay

164
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,520

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,240
they're kind of in trouble for doing but

166
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,080
they took the medical medium information

167
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,919
and then they acted like they discovered

168
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,360
that when it was already published in

169
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,080

173
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
guys how it works with the medical meal

174
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
books not a sign but that's that's

175
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,600
something that happened but they've done

176
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,720
that with lots of stuff including long

177
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
beep

178
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,639
you know long beak

179
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,840
long beak right that too they took that

180
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,080
and you know long haul beep right

181
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,000
that was medical medium information

182
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,560
published first and they took it and now

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,400
science is using that way too they get

184
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,919
their hands on this later on but you'll

185
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,080
have it in your hands you'll become

186
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,919
experts you'll be able to use it and

187
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,600
they'll just take little pieces from it

188

never done before

199
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,639
authors don't release two books at once

200
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,639
it doesn't happen no publisher will back

201
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,960

203
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,680
it authors don't have that kind of stuff

204
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,479
in them but here's how it works

205
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,479

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,600
because because

377
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,519
it not only has something to do with

378
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,240
heavy metals but it has something to do

379
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,040
with the soul and the combination

380
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,639
the combination

381
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,079
is just incredible right the combination

382
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,079
is incredible information to know

383
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,360

384
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,680
nerves there we go we walk around with

460
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,279
incre

461
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,759
inflamed cranial nerves

462
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,199
sophie said sophia viewer says can't

463
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,519
wait for the breast implant illness

464
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,279
chapter it's really comprehensive about

465
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,600
breast implant illness

466
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,839
really an important chapter because what

467
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,440
happens is with breast implant illness

468
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,639
it heads into all these neurological

469
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,160
problems so

470
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,800
that's the whole point it heads into

471
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,560
neurological issues and when you have

472
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,480
breast implant illness you get so many

473
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,000
different diagnoses could happens like

474
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,160
lupus or ms or neurological lyme or

475
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,399
something else it's just either way or

476
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,279
brain fog or fibromyalgia chronic

477
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,399
fatigue syndrome and all of those are

478
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,240
neurological so brain so it's all about

479
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,560
brain and nervous system when it's

480
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,440
breast implant illness so it's really a

481
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,079
critical chapter in the book

482
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,959
comprehensive

483
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,199

right

488
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,360
so

489
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,240
there's there's a chapter called

490
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,559
emotional brain in this book that will

491
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,799
just blow your mind right talking about

492
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,880
how it works with our emotions and how

493
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,240
it's connected inside the physical brain

494
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,160
and how our physical brain gets injured

495
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,400
and when our physical brain gets injured

496
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,559
in the emotional centers of the brain

497
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,640
it talks about exactly how

498
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,160
and why that affects emotions and why

499
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,880
we're all over the place and then how

500
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,200
that how that could even affect the soul

501
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,280
that chapter alone is just

502
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,400
off the charts right there's a chapter

503
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,360
about addictions like addictive brain

504
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
because

505
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,880
we get addicted to everything so

506
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
everybody's like well i'm not addicted

507
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,520

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
alcohol i'm not addicted to drugs but

509
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,640
you're yet you're addicted to these

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,360
other five things or you're addicted to

511
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,039
these other 10 things so the addiction

512
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,200
chapter is just crazy

513
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,360
lisa said is there anything in there

514
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,360
about schizophrenia i would never leave

515
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,600
schizophrenia out of these books for

516
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,400
sure there's over 300 symptoms and

517
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,720
conditions schizophrenia is one of them

518
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,120
it's in the books and

519
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,679
it's a mind-blowing you know the

520
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,520
protocol for schizophrenia is there

521
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,160
which is great here's one right here

522
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,679
that's critical to seizures

523
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,880
seizures

524
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,799
right

525
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,080
epic detail comprehensive

526
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,000
chapter

527
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,480
with with seizures

528
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,240
so people understand how it even happens

529
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,919
what goes wrong

530
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,000
protocol

531
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,120
to turn it around and that alone is just

532
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,679
so great

533
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,160
lesions too lesions on the spinal cord

534
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,120
brain nervous system lesions inside the

535
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,400
brain

536
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,640
a lot of people

537
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,760
they get their mris

538
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,440
right

539
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,000
and what shows up on their mris is a

540
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,080
little white spot what is that a little

541
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,320
white spot little gray spot gray matter

542
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,160
white spot you know black spot

543
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,000
all kinds of dots on their brain and

544
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,799
stuff so it goes into detail about all

545
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
the different spots that are developing

546
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,480
on everybody's brain and what's

547
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,200
happening in the future and as mris get

548
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,360
even more sensitive

549
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,520
they're going to pick up more spots and

550
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,360
that's going to be a major problem

551
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,799
because both medical research and

552
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,160
science and the patient is not going to

553
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,679
know why they have these spots on their

554
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
brain and it's going to lead to a lot of

555
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,520
bad problems

556
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,520
because they're they're uneducated as

557
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,880
far as why the spots are there and what

558
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
they are

559
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,520
so

560
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,200
this book with that alone is just

561
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,360
mind-blowing sarah said what about

562
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,120

comprehensive guides to why someone was

836
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,240

in the emotional centers of the brain

913
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,720
get damaged because of

914
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,480
the physical tissue being damaged and

915
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,559
then the emotions get twisted and people

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,000
don't even really know you never see

917
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,799

918
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,360

920
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,640
like i didn't mean to do that and it's

921
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,399
not even my fault because i don't know

922
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,000
how that happened because that's not who

923
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,080
i am as a person

924
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,320

advanced heavy metal detox cleanse

industries are getting real snakey

1062
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:56,240
really really snaky so the industries

1063
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,839
are vaporizing metals now

1064
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,720
so that's what's happening

1065
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,079
people are breathing in metals through

1066
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,720
vapors

1067
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:09,040
everywhere so the industry's put all

1068
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,040
these vaporized methyl metals

1069
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,320
inside all these different products now

1070
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,160
and everybody's just everybody's just

1071
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,000
vaping metals without realizing it i'm

1072
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,359
not talking about like vaping vaping

1073
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,520
where you're sitting in purposely i'm

1074
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,920
talking about without even knowing it or

1075
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,079
children or family members or pets

1076
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,000
they're they're vapor they're breathing

1077
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,119
in these vapors inhaling them absorbing

1078
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,359
them through their skin so the

1079
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:37,200
industries learn this new technique

1080
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,480
this new learn this new technique

1081
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,560
about

1082
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,400
you know how to get metals through

1083
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,320
chemical

1084
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,119
transformation basically getting them

1085
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,040
into us that way methylating them

1086
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,040
getting into a vapor form

1087
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,960
and so metals are different like never

1088
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,320
before so that's something that's

1089
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,240
