1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,120
PID all kinds of different conditions

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,440
urinary tract infections are on the rise

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,000
up up up up they're not going down down

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,799
down UTI are going up up and away the

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,480
problem is with UTI they're not just

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,480
going up they're going chronically crazy

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,720
where women are

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,240
suffering

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,279
incredible suffering we're talking about

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,480
devastating suffering because of UTI

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,120
chronic I that don't want to go anywhere

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,760
because guess what the bacteria became

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,000
super bacteria it is now a super bug

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
that's what's happening so so many

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,640
people are dealing dealing with chronic

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,199
UTI they can't get past them they can't

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,760
move forward it's just tormenting them

18
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:53,280
and it doesn't go away same thing with

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,840
pelvic inflammatory disease that too

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,920
just keeps on tormenting women in such

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,399
ways that is

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,920
undescribable because words don't match

23
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,960
the suffering they are suffering with so

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,720
we're going into that UTI bladder

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,479
infections kidney infections right

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,479
urinary tract infections yeast

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,280
infections yeast infections

28
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,759
interesting yeast yeast yeast so funny

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,520
thing about well it's nothing funny

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,920
about it but the funny thing about yeast

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,840
infections is it's not the yeast is not

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,320
the real problem it is bacteria area

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,960
that's Underneath It All the yeast just

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,280
the immune system is so challenged in

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,840
that area that the that yeast just grows

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,720
because it's growing because there's so

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,920
much of an immune suppressive um

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,000
situation happening in the bladder area

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,560
the vaginal area all of that that the

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,560
yeast just tends to explode but it's

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,079
exploding because the bacteria is

42
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,560
thriving and taking over we're talking

43
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,240
about strep we're talking about bacteria

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,039
we're talking about super bugs a little

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,039
bit we're going into that we're talking

46
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,680
about UTI we're going to talk about

47
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,000
solutions for UTI as well so that's

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,679
going to be really helpful for a lot of

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
people that are dealing with UTI you

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,840
don't want to miss this episode this is

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,280
an important one I'm even reading a

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,120
little bit out of Liver Rescue a little

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,840
bit out of cleanse to heal don't miss

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,160
this do you know anybody struggling or

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,640
suffering with UTI or have a history of

56
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,360
UTI and now they have acne now they got

57
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,000
sibo years later they get sibo now they

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,239
get PID now they got acne again then

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,879
they got an ear infection then they got

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,080
a sore throat and a strep throat problem

61
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:42,480
M yeah exactly strep strap strap strap

62
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,680
strap strap strap exactly sibo they

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,239
never talk about what bacteria it is

64
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,959
that creates small intestinal bacterial

65
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:54,519
overgrowth but it's strep our good old

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,879
friend strep hey strep how are you fine

67
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,760
doing okay living in everybody's

68
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,920
lymphatic vessels living in everybody's

69
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,360
pores living in everybody's throats

70
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,799
living in everybody's butts yep you got

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,599
it that's what happens strep is always

72
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,200
hanging around people's anuses it's

73
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,280
hanging around the rectums all the time

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,680
that's where strep loves to be it's

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,599
around everybody's throat it's in their

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,200
mouth every day people have more than

77
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,000
one variety two variety they'll have

78
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,799
three variety four variety five variety

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,319
six variety seven variety they'll have

80
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:35,280
10 varieties of strep some dormant some

81
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:40,040
lowkey some much more serious creating

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,879
everything from acne to sty yep sty

83
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,040
thrush all that thrush on their tongue

84
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,360
just causing problems so that's the

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,000
whole thing there we're going into strep

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,120
and we're going into UTI but let's hit

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,120
the UTI problem because that is critical

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,480
because I'm seeing it more and more

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,200
years ago I didn't see it like it was

90
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,519
today you'd have that antibiotic

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,879
resistant UTI you'd have that out there

92
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:12,879
I saw it out there okay but now it's

93
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,000
unlike it's ever been it's never been to

94
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,840
this degree I called it though and I saw

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,120
I've written about it that these bugs

96
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,800
would actually take off to such a degree

97
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:27,360
where they'd be antibiotic resistant but

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,280
not just Mera not talking about Mera I'm

99
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,400
talking about plain old Jan

100
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,840
strep not Mera this is important to know

101
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,639
this is a really good episode and we're

102
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,840
going to talk about Solutions too which

103
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,160
are critical um let's get into it a

104
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,720
little bit the antibiotic dilemma do you

105
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,759
guys uh love antibiotics antibiotics are

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,960
the leading treatment for

107
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,600
UTI antibiotics are the leading

108
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:01,080
treatments for UTI you know what that

109
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:04,240
means that means decade after decade of

110
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,199
bugs that are actually becoming

111
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,960
immune to the

112
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,240
antibiotic it's how it works and then

113
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,160
that bug spreads to another person and

114
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,319
so that person receives that bug and

115
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,240
then now they have an antibiotic

116
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,520
resistant bug they get sick and then

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,720
they go to the doctor the doctor gives

118
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:33,240
them an antibiotic again and now their

119
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,479
bug is in them that's already antibiotic

120
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,840
resistant is now even becoming more

121
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,039
antibiotic

122
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,880
resistant and

123
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,520
the and then it keeps on going on and on

124
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,319
and on and on so that's what's

125
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,360
happening it's not like the old

126
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:55,199
days and then the antibiotic kills the

127
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,240
weakest bacteria but the strong survives

128
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,720
so let's do this

129
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,880
okay I prepared for this one here we go

130
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,400
okay you got a bacterium right here you

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,440
got a bacterium right here got a

132
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,000
bacterium right here and a bacterium

133
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,720
right here and I'll even put another one

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,680
right here and one more right here so

135
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,319
these are

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,599
bacteria okay so here we are take a look

137
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:26,120
you guys these are inside the bladder or

138
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:31,240
the kidneys so let's make a bladder

139
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:34,000
here okay there we are we got a bladder

140
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,759
right and in that bladder is a whole

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,440
bunch of bacteria and strep bacteria is

142
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:43,479
what it is okay so antibiotics are used

143
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,000
all of a sudden boom we take an

144
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:48,919
antibiotic the antibiotic is coming

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
through right now here it goes there it

146
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,000
is the antibiotic coming

147
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,000
through there we go can't really see

148
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,800
this good but there it is Boom the

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,440
antibiotic came through then now we get

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,560
some dead

151
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,280
bacteria this one explodes Boom the

152
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,240
antibiotic killed

153
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,400
it boom Another One explodes boom

154
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,199
Another One

155
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,800
explodes interesting this one just gets

156
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,120
maed that bacterium gets maed this one

157
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,120
just gets

158
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,759
weakened am I yelling this one gets

159
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,039
weakened okay okay this one doesn't get

160
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,800
harmed at

161
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:41,599
all all right we got a weakened

162
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:45,879
bacterium we got a maed bacterium

163
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,680
damaged but they survive they survive

164
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,479
and they provide information now against

165
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,479
that

166
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:57,159
antibiotic they hold the key to survival

167
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,199
against the antibiotic that was given to

168
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:03,639
them think about that right now right

169
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,280
and then you got one that survived it

170
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:10,000
completely that also holds information

171
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,120
but it's completely unharmed in fact it

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,039
seemed to do good with the antibiotic

173
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,280
that one little bug right there drank

174
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,599
those

175
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,080
antibiotics consumed them it didn't hurt

176
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:25,919
them and now this one bug right here is

177
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,919
getting

178
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,879
stronger nice and strong now now it's a

179
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:34,880
nice strong bacterium you see this the

180
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,599
maed ones not as strong but they provide

181
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,719
information and they stay alive is what

182
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,320
they do they too survive it and they're

183
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,240
a they survive it in the aftermath

184
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,959
they're still hanging around okay and

185
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,240
then another one too at the same time

186
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,399
still survived it and it's it's there

187
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:58,839
right so now you got three bacterium but

188
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,920
three different bacterium same bacteria

189
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:05,720
but three different experiences three

190
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:10,120
different strengths and three different

191
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,279
injuries one not injured two one maed

192
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,079
one injured there's a problem with that

193
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:18,800
though because then as it's producing

194
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:21,640
more bacteria is being produced okay

195
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,920
which happens more and more

196
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,120
bacteria is being

197
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,040
produced right here's your bacteria

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,720
right

199
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,720
here and these bacteria are getting

200
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,640
stronger and producing the weak

201
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:40,160
ones okay want to be as strong as the

202
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:43,040
strong one so the weak ones become even

203
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,920
stronger than the original strong one

204
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,000
that wasn't even affected by the

205
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,279
original back antibiotic okay this is

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,160
important the weaker

207
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,760
ones gain strength the ones that were

208
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,959
maimed and injured by the an antibiotic

209
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,640
keep that in mind they were maimed and

210
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:05,399
injured at and they

211
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,680
now okay they strengthen they rise above

212
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,600
it they gather information from their

213
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,880
injuries they learn how to not get

214
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,240
injured again by the antibiotic they

215
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,279
become stronger than the one that

216
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,680
survived completely without injury at

217
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:27,519
all and that's a problem all on its own

218
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,760
okay so now you have very strong

219
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,920
bacteria here's the thing

220
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,839
they get stronger they get stronger and

221
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:42,959
then all

222
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:46,320
right and then a new infection

223
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,160
occurs they get stronger they override

224
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,920
the immune system of the person drops

225
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,279
exactly the immune system

226
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,040
drops there's another bladder right

227
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:01,320
there okay so white blood

228
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,680
cells for some reason aren't as strong

229
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,560
in that person their own white blood

230
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,920
cells aren't doing the jobs they need to

231
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,720
do they get triggered they get exposures

232
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,079
something happens there and then the

233
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,720
bacteria rise up and get stronger and

234
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:21,839
now we have a new infection they

235
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,600
reproduce I'm going to make a whole

236
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,720
bunch of them here if you guys with me

237
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,760
you're following me right now okay and

238
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,959
then the new antibiotic comes through

239
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,240
they're sick again and then a new wave

240
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,519
of antibiotic comes through they're at

241
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,720
the doctor's office they got a new

242
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,680
UTI and then boom here comes the

243
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,680
antibiotic it's rushing

244
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,680
through

245
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,639
okay and what happens is all these new

246
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,040
bacteria

247
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:01,639
right they don't budge everybody's happy

248
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,959
they're stronger they supersede the

249
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,480
antibiotic and then the doctor gets

250
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,760
pissed the patients gets the patient

251
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,839
gets pissed stays sick the doctor's

252
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,480
pissed and then they change up the

253
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:19,480
antibiotic get ready for this the new

254
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,240
antibiotic gets then prescribed so here

255
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,880
comes the new antibiotic coming through

256
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,880
and this is what sucks right here really

257
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,760
sucks it comes

258
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,480
through and then it mimes

259
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,040
and injures a whole bunch of them that's

260
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,399
right this one gets maimed this one gets

261
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,240
injured this one gets maimed this one

262
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,399
gets injured this one gets almost killed

263
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,240
completely this one just gets slightly

264
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,480
injured this one never gets touched okay

265
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,880
that's

266
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:56,000
fine here's the problem now we got a

267
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,399
whole bunch of brand new

268
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,360
streps and those brand new bacterium

269
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,680
strep

270
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,600
bacterium have

271
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,639
information and survived a new

272
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,440
antibiotic that is not good they

273
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,760
survived a new

274
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,440
antibiotic they're still alive now they

275
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,079
have information from the original

276
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,399
antibiotic how to survive survival

277
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,560
instincts in the bacteria and now they

278
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,079
got new information from the new

279
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,440
antibiotic survival mechanisms kick in

280
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:32,440
in that bacteria the

281
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,600
bacteria does not want to lose so it's

282
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,639
going to now

283
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:41,199
supersede and then boom the next phase

284
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,040
happens okay you got a patient that's

285
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,120
getting a little better again the

286
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,399
patient's getting a little bit

287
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,399
better I really can't stand this

288
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,759
whiteboard

289
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,279
yep all right new bacteria it's

290
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,519
reproducing

291
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,399
here we

292
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:08,360
go once again immune system drops in the

293
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:13,040
patient the patient was getting

294
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,600
better a month later two months later at

295
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,160
some point okay there's the bladder

296
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,959
again I'm just doing a bladder you do

297
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,120
kidneys you can do you know urethras

298
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,880
whatever

299
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,720
so all

300
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,600
right playing around markers here so we

301
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,199
got a new bacteria

302
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,759
this bacteria has information from two

303
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,240
antibiotics it has survived two

304
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:42,000
antibiotics yes it has indeed and it has

305
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,160
survived the person's immune

306
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,440
system that's the whole point it

307
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,360
survived their immune system and it

308
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,800
survived the antibiotic involved in

309
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,720
their immune system okay both with the

310
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,839
immune system working on that working

311
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,320
with that antibiotic and both with that

312
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,800
antibiotic okay so get ready for this

313
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,079
person get sick again they got another

314
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,160
UTI it's pretty darn serious they're in

315
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,759
pain they got a fever they don't know if

316
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,839
they got kidney infections bladder

317
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:15,839
infections and here we go there might be

318
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:19,000
some blood in the urine

319
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,440
right goes to the doctor doctor

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,560
prescribes an antibiotic the same one

321
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,880
that they used last time so you fill

322
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,800
your prescription now you're taking it

323
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,920
antibiotic runs through the body it's

324
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,319
triggering the immune system immune

325
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,639
cells you're trying to work with it it's

326
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:35,800
trying to work with everything it's

327
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,880
going

328
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,000
through okay and this time now with this

329
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,600
new

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,639
antibiotic it's only killing off this

331
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,040
one only killing off that one only

332
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,240
killing off that one that one that one

333
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,880
that one but this one right here is just

334
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,920
injured that one's injured that one's

335
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,399
injured that's one's injured injured

336
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,240
maed and we got the whole thing over

337
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,839
again all the maed and injured ones say

338
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,560
I'm not going to do this anymore I'm not

339
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,839
going to let this antibiotic this new

340
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,480
antibiotic rule the roost and clean us

341
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,199
out we have to Rise Above This and we

342
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,839
have to get stronger and then what

343
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:21,120
happens is the new reproduction of that

344
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:24,839
of that bacterium is even stronger so

345
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,680
that the next phase of the antibiotic on

346
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,839
the fourth round which happens all the

347
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,440
time and sometimes it's a sixth round

348
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:34,680
sometimes it's a seven another one's

349
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,920
prescribed here we

350
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:41,399
go and now none of the bacteria are

351
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,480
budging at all got a fever there's blood

352
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,639
in the

353
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,720
urine kidneys are inflamed they have to

354
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,600
give steroids out now so now it's

355
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,120
steroids plus the new antibiotics so

356
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,920
here we go doctors's got to play the

357
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:59,120
game again and here it

358
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,440
comes right now it's time

359
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
to

360
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,439
use now it's time to use the new

361
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,799
antibiotic all right so we got this

362
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,240
bacteria that bacteria that bacteria

363
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:14,559
that one right there that one right

364
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,559
there there we go here's all the

365
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,520
bacteria yep we got another bladder

366
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,640
we'll just do bladder here we go there's

367
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,000
the

368
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:29,240
bladder now the doctor has to bring in

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,840
the super antibiotic one with a lot of

370
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,799
side effects one that causes a lot of

371
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,960
problems one that also says a lot of

372
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:40,120
terrible thing things on the side effect

373
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,360
package the little roll out and here we

374
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,880
go here it

375
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,160
comes boom boom boom boom boom boom bo

376
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,160
boom I'm taking my

377
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,200
antibiotic

378
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:00,039
right the super

379
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,960
antibiotic the Super One a change

380
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:06,840
up

381
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:09,880
okay injures this guy kills off this guy

382
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,080
mes this guy injures this guy kills off

383
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,520
this guy doesn't even touch that guy

384
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,440
that guy and that guy now you got three

385
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,840
guys here not even being touched by the

386
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,679
super

387
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,679
antibiotic but you still got injured but

388
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,760
not dead

389
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,760
bacteria injured but not dead bacteria

390
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,320
you got some dead

391
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,480
bacteria but too many

392
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,280
injured too many

393
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,600
injured and too many maimed but still

394
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,880
survived and others that didn't even get

395
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,720
affected and then we got a big problem

396
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,559
so now they reproduce

397
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:55,840
again after the Super antibiotic went

398
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:58,799
through they reproduce this time we're

399
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,640
in trouble now big trouble here we we

400
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,720
are because they use the super

401
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,760
antibiotic again and then they have that

402
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,720
running through and now these

403
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:15,240
bacteria they have messaging they Cod it

404
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:19,240
they have information they're

405
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,520
superpowered they do not not give up at

406
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,600
this point they have information of four

407
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,600
to five different

408
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,400
antibiotics and they don't want to budge

409
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,720
anymore they put their foot down they're

410
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,720
done that means they don't budge so then

411
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,400
the doctor has to run another

412
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,840
antibiotic brings that one

413
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,039
through and now the patient is just

414
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,320
chronically sick chronically suffering

415
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,600
and chronically sick a super buug has

416
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,600
been

417
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:01,919
born the patient has the Super buug

418
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,520
whether it's a male

419
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,559
female the patient has a super buug and

420
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,760
then the patient has a

421
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,280
relationship or the patient is a chef

422
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,480
working in a restaurant who cuts their

423
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,840
finger and then bleeds on three

424
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
different meals that you can't really

425
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,840
tell because a lot of chefs they wear

426
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,320
the black gloves they put the black

427
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,679
gloves on they throw a bandage on put a

428
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,159
black glove on there's still blood

429
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,000
everywhere and they get working really

430
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,080
quick they wipe their hands and or it's

431
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,840
a relationship sexual interactions of

432
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,159
some kind and then that super bug now

433
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,799
gets transferred onto someone else with

434
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:41,440
all this information and all this

435
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,440
messaging and that information or the

436
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,039
shopping

437
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,039
cart shopping cart's a big one I've been

438
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,120
saying this for decades you guys heard

439
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:54,480
me say it years ago before c came around

440
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,559
the shopping cart is a big one okay lots

441
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,880
of different bacteria on there lots of

442
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,200
strep lots of Staff lots of C diffs L

443
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,880
lots of Mera lots of other stuff too but

444
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,960
the strep is just crazy on the shopping

445
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:10,320
cart handles crazy that's how much is on

446
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,200
there okay so with that if they swabbed

447
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,960
if they did a swab in a p tree dish if

448
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,919
they did that like off the shopping cart

449
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,559
handles you wouldn't believe what would

450
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,640
grow wouldn't believe it so you're

451
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,159
sitting there with a shopping cart

452
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,840
handle you're not using handy wipes

453
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,159
you're not doing an alcohol handy wipe

454
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,279
across the handle you're you don't

455
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:29,880
you're you're not thinking about

456
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,000
anything you don't care about anything

457
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,200
maybe you're just somebody that thinks

458
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,520
that your immune system will get

459
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,600
stronger because of it and you won't

460
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,400
have to worry because hey who cares I

461
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,200
can just eat bugs and have bugs all over

462
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,559
my skin it's just all that whole thing

463
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,279
that philosophy you know that philosophy

464
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:45,720
right it makes you stronger you become

465
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,640
immune to it or something like that

466
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,600
that's not true that's not how it works

467
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,400
the more exposure you get to these bugs

468
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,799
the more exposure you get the more bugs

469
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,760
you get the more problems than you have

470
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,600
and then that it doesn't work that way

471
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,159
where we're just all of a sudden hey I'm

472
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,000
immune to everything and that's what I

473
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,159
want all these bugs no it does not work

474
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,720
like that tell that to someone who got

475
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,400
you know Herpes Simplex 2 tell that to

476
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,400
someone who's got something else that

477
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,679
they caught from somebody it doesn't

478
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,279
make you stronger it's not how it works

479
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,919
it's a hassle it's all a hassle so then

480
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:21,080
that strep then that super bug gets into

481
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,200
somebody else through a shopping cart H

482
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,320
handle through a public bathroom off the

483
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,720
toilet seat off the dispenser whatever

484
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,240
it is

485
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,240
and they get it and they get the bug

486
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,120
that's superpowered it is a super

487
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,840
version of itself it already knows all

488
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,960
the

489
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,000
antibiotics it already knows about them

490
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,400
all that means when you come down with

491
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,799
something or you get sick or something

492
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,600
happens and now you got a UTI whatever

493
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,760
it may be you go to the doctor and the

494
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,200
process starts all over again but the

495
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,640
doctor starts giving you that first

496
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,919
round of antibiotics and it won't budge

497
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,240
so easy especially if you have a comprom

498
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,640
rised immune system and you're already

499
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,919
struggling with something it won't

500
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,240
budge and they're just like why do you

501
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,960
have these UTI all of a sudden or say

502
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,720
you know someone has someone has sex

503
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,600
with somebody else and you know is

504
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,000
unprotective even if it's even if it's

505
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,320
protected sex it's still easy to

506
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,720
transfer these like these um these

507
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,320
streps and this bacteria and all a

508
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,159
sudden now there's a new UTI somebody

509
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,960
has that never had before and now but

510
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,919
it's an anti-resistant it's a what is it

511
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,000
antibiotic resistant is what I mean

512
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,360
version of itself that has all this

513
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,240
information that's coded that's got all

514
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,400
this Intel that survived all these

515
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,279
antibiotics that knows them well so now

516
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,559
we have another person with a super bug

517
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,120
and just as Grim as it sounds it's not

518
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,600
Grim when you know how to heal and use

519
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,520
tools and that's the thing about medical

520
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,240
medium information it's the one place

521
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,760
where people that are the sickest come

522
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,960
to find answers and it's not all that

523
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,520
biohack [ __ ] out there that's going

524
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,760
on it's real it's the real deal it's

525
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,480
real answers real information on how to

526
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,360
heal what to do and that's medical

527
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,039
medium information and that's how it's

528
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,480
always been people can be jealous out

529
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,080
there and they can rip it apart or say

530
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,799
what they want about it it Stills the

531
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,520
most people healed in the world to the

532
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:22,440
most chronic conditions and this is why

533
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,039
knowing about this information not just

534
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,960
biohacking crap on social and just this

535
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,080
this this and try this it's for people

536
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,799
who have been there and done that

537
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,520
they're seasoned and they know so what

538
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,080
happens is there is hope so when these

539
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,480
super bugs the super strep gets to

540
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,080
somebody else and they're fighting these

541
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,000
these battling these UTI and it seems

542
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,799
hopeless there are women out there with

543
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,840
chronic UTI every day of their lives

544
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,799
going into overactive

545
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,600
bladder going into chronic UTI

546
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,799
overactive bladder pain in their kidneys

547
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,799
pain in their back PB and then it tack

548
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,919
on acne and sore throats and sibo

549
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,600
because they all get a sibo diagnosis

550
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,880
eventually tuck on to all all those in

551
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,559
there and they're living with these

552
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,000
Super Bug streps it's happening more and

553
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,120
more out there and there are more people

554
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,120
living with this than ever before now

555
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:19,000
there is an up surge that's getting out

556
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,399
of control a serious upsurge and that

557
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,039
upsurge is not going to stop it's going

558
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,600
to keep on going unless people know how

559
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,279
to arm themselves and take care of

560
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,360
themselves and know how to fight feed

561
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,760
their body what they need do the right

562
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,000
things giving their bodies what their

563
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,960
need so they can they can beat this

564
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,919
Super Bug stuff down because it's no

565
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,159
joke right now cuz people are passing

566
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,840
these along and it's out of control

567
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,520
people need the right information

568
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,200
there's cleanse the heel right here in

569
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,880
front of me and in cleanse the heel it

570
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,240
got pelvic inflammatory disease right

571
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,880
and even you know PID right and even

572
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,200
prostatitis got that there too and I'm

573
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,640
talking about bladder infections UTI all

574
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,760
of that in here so it's cleanse to heal

575
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,919
people need this book they need the

576
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,159
information I have Liver Rescue in front

577
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,240
of me right here I want to read a little

578
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,600
bit about this for a couple of minutes

579
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,240
if you guys don't

580
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,720
mind the story of

581
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,200
strep is what I was just telling you

582
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,200
guys that's the story of strep right now

583
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,000
in this modern day what people are

584
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,399
dealing with and how bad it is okay most

585
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,279
people strep starts in childhood they

586
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:30,559
get the ear infections to get the strep

587
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:33,200
throat the sore throats it starts

588
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,799
earlier on it strep passed down from the

589
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,919
parents a lot of times and it's strep

590
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:40,080
that's passed down to the parents and

591
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,200
then the children the B the children

592
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,480
have it and the children pass it to each

593
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,240
other in

594
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,559
school and so it's it's strep being

595
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,039
passed around everywhere that's what it

596
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,120
is but that could be fine in some ways

597
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,080
but in others it's antibiotic resistance

598
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,559
STP that's being passed around going to

599
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,159
each person then that takes us to the

600
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,679
next level of understanding which I want

601
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,559
to go to

602
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,840
now which is the immune system okay

603
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:11,080
that's the next thing every time SHP

604
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,919
enters into somebody and battles our

605
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,880
immune cells and it survives so anytime

606
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:22,399
SHP enters into each person and it goes

607
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:25,399
into war with our immune cells right

608
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:28,279
here goes into war every time that

609
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:31,480
happens and there's a battle and the

610
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:33,640
strep survives it has information so

611
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,360
when that strep is passed on to another

612
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,320
person it's not just

613
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,559
antibiotics it's also relationships with

614
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,240
the immune system of the person it was

615
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,720
in this whole time so then when that STP

616
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,200
gets passed on to somebody else it's

617
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,279
getting passed on to somebody else with

618
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,039
information on that person's immune

619
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:57,240
system information of how it survived

620
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,720
the battle with that person's white

621
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,559
count

622
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,679
and so when that strep is in the new

623
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,440
person the strep now has a way to beat

624
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,120
immune systems it goes into another

625
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,559
person another person's immune system

626
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,320
goes up against it there it goes it's in

627
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,240
battle the the bacteria survives why do

628
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,240
you think people keep on getting acne

629
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,200
all over again they still have some

630
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,840
strep surviving what do you think they

631
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,880
keep on getting the UTI over again the

632
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:29,000
bladder infections the overactive

633
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,799
bladder right that one to OAB they keep

634
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,080
on getting these things and then the

635
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,679
thigh and then the sore throats and then

636
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,320
the strep throat periodically and then

637
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,200
the earaches and ear infections or they

638
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,720
get exposed to new strains and that's

639
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,159
another story and we'll go into that too

640
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,559
the strep has information of the

641
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,000
person's immune system information of

642
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,240
the antibiotics the other person took

643
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,600
they take it to the next person the next

644
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,440
person's immune cells go against it they

645
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,600
go into battle what survives is Boom the

646
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,279
bacteria again some of it survives it

647
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,200
gets passed on to a new person with now

648
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:07,320
immune system information from two

649
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,240
others now here's where it gets really

650
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,360
intense that

651
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:17,600
bacteria can go through a 100 people and

652
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:21,039
gather information from their immune

653
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,399
systems of that 100

654
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:29,039
people that's how super bugs are made

655
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:31,919
it's not just the antibiotic over

656
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,279
usage and then the UN and then not being

657
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,559
taught how to heal and get rid of the

658
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,760
bacteria

659
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:42,840
naturally it's also information from

660
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:48,159
each person's immune cells to each

661
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:51,880
person and that bug becomes one

662
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,320
Unstoppable brutal bug and that's why

663
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,559
there are women out there young women in

664
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,120
their 20s and in their early 30s that

665
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,399
are in years on a daily basis and they

666
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:06,080
are so sick and they have so much

667
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:09,000
UTI chronic UTI going on they have so

668
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,039
much overactive badder UTI kidney

669
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,720
infection sore throats molay tired

670
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,120
fatigue everything else Under the Sun

671
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,840
with it and they're suffering and

672
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,200
they're bleeding they're on antibiotics

673
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,440
again their stomach's being ripped a

674
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,440
shreds from the

675
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,039
antibiotics then they get their sibo

676
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,080
diagnoses and it's all around the same

677
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:28,279
old thing more antibiotics for that and

678
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,720
they're suffering

679
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,240
and then

680
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,640
because they got a strep inside of them

681
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,440
that could have been through a hundred

682
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,600
people that was passed on to them one

683
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,159
way or another and that strep is smart

684
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,919
it's smart it knows the immune cell

685
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:46,480
information from dozens of people it

686
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,760
knows the antibiotic information from

687
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,840
dozens of people and it carries it with

688
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,760
it and we have to know how to destroy

689
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,360
that bacteria and how to kill it and

690
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,120
what to use that it is not immune to

691
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,919
because that's the key right medical

692
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,519
medum information is always about the

693
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:09,320
cause because guess what they didn't

694
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:12,320
know strep was a UTI problem they didn't

695
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,159
know strep was other problems they knew

696
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,600
about strep throat but they didn't know

697
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,919
strep created acne they didn't know it

698
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,840
created sty did they didn't know it

699
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,240
created UTI by the way that's medical

700
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,120
medium

701
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,519
information but it does it's just coming

702
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,559
out people are poaching it and it's

703
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,960
going out there and it's just getting

704
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,039
out there every day just like you guys

705
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,679
are probably seeing because I know you

706
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,120
guys are telling me you see it every day

707
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,480
we see it every

708
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,840
day but the point is is that bacteria we

709
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,399
have to learn how to kill it you have to

710
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,440
identify it and know there's a cause

711
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,399
behind your PID there's a cause behind

712
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,919
your

713
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,399
UTI there's a cause Behind these

714
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,159
things and there's a way to kill and

715
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:58,840
destroy kill and destroy the

716
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,399
bacteria even bacterium that is

717
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,760
antibiotic resistant and knows a crap

718
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:05,960
ton of people's immune systems that

719
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,760
understands all these people's immune

720
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,679
systems that that bacteria was in all

721
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,559
this

722
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,480
time understands it is an expert at

723
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:17,279
immune systems because that's what the

724
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,320
bacteria becomes it becomes an expert at

725
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,720
everybody's white count immune cells all

726
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,480
of it it knows it all it's been in too

727
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,000
many people it hasn't been destroyed and

728
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,559
it's gotten stronger and stronger now

729
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,840
it's a super bug and that's where it's

730
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,480
at and that's happening now every day

731
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,960
and we think these super bugs are bad

732
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,080
now wait till the next round of UTI 10

733
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,679
years from

734
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:44,519
now and all the young men and women it's

735
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:47,320
going to be like nobody's ever seen ever

736
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,159
seen it's going to be that bad it's

737
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,559
going to be bleeding is normal

738
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:55,120
constantly bleeding catheters constantly

739
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,480
on catheters that's another thing too so

740
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,559
the UTI are getting to a point where all

741
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,039
these young women are are literally

742
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,720
living with

743
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:08,279
catheters that's how bad it

744
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,600
is and so we have to be mindful and

745
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:11,000
understand that there is a way to beat

746
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,360
it and there is a way to do we're going

747
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,519
to talk about that in a little bit but I

748
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,760
want to read a little if I

749
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:21,679
can okay maybe most people strep starts

750
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,720
in childhood maybe even pass down from a

751
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,039
parent at conception yes a newborn can

752
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,639
enter the world at strep already in her

753
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,519
or his

754
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:34,440
system a child can also get strep from

755
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:38,200
daycare or school and it's easily passed

756
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,880
from child to child it really is as well

757
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:44,080
as adult to adult because strep is a

758
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,519
type of bacterium antibiotics do seem

759
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,960
like the obvious choice to treat it but

760
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:52,120
here's the crucial point that I talked

761
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,720
about to know about strep long ago

762
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,600
before antibiotic Revolution before

763
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,080
antibiotics long ago you guys this is

764
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,360
really interesting right here before the

765
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:05,799
antibiotic was born long

766
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:10,040
ago strep used to be one strain of

767
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:12,280
bacterium strep was one strain of

768
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,560
bacterium which takes us to this next

769
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,000
part right here and now this is really

770
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,159
important okay this is

771
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,159
important very

772
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,720
important I'm going to bring this around

773
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,800
for a second

774
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:32,040
okay all right so

775
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,760
five antibiotics ago 10 antibiotics ago

776
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,599
10 different people ago the bacteria

777
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,919
look like

778
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:45,359
this right but then it changes a new

779
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:49,599
strain is is is created along

780
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:53,240
with the superbug power it alters and

781
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,440
turns into a different bug now we have

782
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,879
the old

783
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,920
strain that's way in the past and it's

784
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,280
and other people we got the new

785
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,440
strain and there it

786
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,440
is right there that new

787
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,280
strain becomes another new strain

788
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,920
eventually another new strain another

789
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,760
new strain but here's the thing if you

790
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,520
pass on this strain that it became to

791
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,680
another person through sex or through

792
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,440
drinking from somebody's glass or from

793
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,160
being in a bar and eating something or

794
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,920
whatever you're doing in a restaurant or

795
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,839
on a shopping cart in a shopping cart or

796
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,160
in a public bathroom or so many other

797
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:35,280
ways you can do

798
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,640
this if you pass on that strep bacteria

799
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,720
to somebody in that in that strain to

800
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,920
them they'll have that

801
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:48,240
strain and they may keep that strain but

802
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:52,480
it'll be that strain okay these in this

803
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:56,480
person can still alter and become a new

804
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,599
strain in a few years that new strain

805
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,200
can be passed on to another person and

806
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,839
then they'll have that

807
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,359
strain

808
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,359
see that's how it

809
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:14,800
works men can get UTI too and they do

810
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,319
but they don't have a cycle men do not

811
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,760
have

812
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:21,240
menstruation they do not have a cycle so

813
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,079
they don't have the immune system

814
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,400
lowering thing that happens so what

815
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,000
happens is when a woman goes for

816
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,560
menstration and she has her cycle her

817
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,319
monthly cycle immune system drops and

818
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,920
80% of our immune system goes to the

819
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:33,960
reproductive system that's medical medum

820
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,640
information 20% stays around the body

821
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,359
for the rest of the body the

822
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,640
reproductive system is the number one

823
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,520
Focus that time a month where it's the

824
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,760
number one Focus for the immune system

825
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,560
think about that right so because of

826
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,319
that the immune system is so focused

827
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,839
around the reproductive

828
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:52,839
system okay that it's easy to catch

829
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,400
strap

830
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:58,040
orally very easy to catch it orally or

831
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,680
in the eyes where the immune system

832
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,680
isn't there to destroy it right off the

833
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,599
running so if there's some kind of

834
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,079
relationship or a shopping cart like I

835
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,599
said or a public bathroom and something

836
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:10,640
goes in the eye or something gets in the

837
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,640
mouth whatever it is during the cycle

838
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,319
80% of the immune system isn't around

839
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,280
the mouth it's not there so for a woman

840
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:21,680
it's not here it's down here so the

841
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,880
strep can easily start its it's

842
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,240
beginning in the mouth in the throat and

843
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,319
the so for so forth in that area so that

844
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,160
happens too all right let's go into just

845
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:32,800
a little

846
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:36,680
bit all right here's the crucial point

847
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,240
to know about strep long ago before the

848
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,880
antibiotic Revolution I'm reading out of

849
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,200
Liver Rescue if you guys never seen

850
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,240
these books you don't know about these

851
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,280
books you should get both of them go to

852
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,119
Amazon get both be the best thing you

853
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,880
ever did become an expert about your own

854
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:57,000
health learn how to

855
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,359
heal become a true expert a true expert

856
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,359
not a

857
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,200
biohacker SHP is not and never was a

858
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,359
super buug in the past so strep was

859
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:12,800
never a super buug it's not designed to

860
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:15,640
be a Super Bug originally it was never

861
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,599
meant to be one we are forcing it to

862
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:23,440
become a super buug

863
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:26,359
okay it's much more forgiving strep than

864
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,400
ever than anything else was okay and

865
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:30,920
it's original state going back many

866
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,400
years ago it was much more forgiving

867
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:37,240
it's a forgiving

868
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:40,480
bacterium it's not as unforgiving as

869
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:44,720
merca it's not as unforgiving as Mera so

870
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:48,040
that is something to understand cith and

871
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,920
Mera can be even much more brutal much

872
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:56,119
more brutal of a superbug stre still

873
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:59,400
even with its worst superbug mentality

874
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:03,480
whatever it's more superbug

875
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:06,800
creation it doesn't hold the power as

876
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,280
like Mera and what MCA can turn into

877
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,599
some kind of flesh eating bacterium that

878
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,599
just becomes a super super bug so I want

879
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,800
that clear so people

880
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,960
know so if they got strep and they're

881
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,880
living with strep they're living with

882
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,079
all these symptoms you can turn it in it

883
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,720
can turn naturally into a Super Bug over

884
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,079
time because it's force-fed the

885
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,200
antibiotics it's force fed

886
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:33,560
in the way I was saying all those things

887
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,800
but it won't get to like a Mera level at

888
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,960
merca's worst so the different varieties

889
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,359
of Mera there's all these different

890
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,240
varieties of Mera did you know there's

891
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:46,119
thousands of varieties of Mera and some

892
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:50,720
of the top tier varieties of Mera that

893
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:52,640
are just like God awful and they kill

894
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,480
people is what they do and they give

895
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,800
them sepsis and then they die they like

896
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,319
the top tier of the worst shp's not

897
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,960
there so I wanted that to be

898
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:06,599
clear but SHP is no longer one strain I

899
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,839
want to go back to that a little bit

900
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,720
it's no longer one

901
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,440
strain there are so many varieties of

902
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,079
strep at this point over the

903
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,599
decades strep being a victim of

904
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:22,040
antibiotics it found a way to survive to

905
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,119
adapt adaptation didn't just mean

906
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,480
getting stronger it meant mutating and

907
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,760
spawning different strains and varieties

908
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,160
and that's what strep does it's the

909
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,599
ultimate like spawner of new varieties

910
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,000
of bacteria all strep all the same

911
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,839
family but it's the ultimate see heal

912
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,640
with Mariana says over there on IG I

913
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:46,119
healed my UTI back in 2002 with the

914
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:49,680
herbs and supplements you recommend in

915
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:53,319
cleanse the heel book amazing is it

916
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,040
2020 let see what it is um healing with

917
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:57,960
Victoria I used to be on an antibiotic

918
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,800
once once a month for UTI I haven't

919
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,640
needed them in four years thanks to your

920
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,760
protocols thanks to you and so because

921
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,839
medical M information destroys UTI just

922
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,480
destroys them so one thing about mm info

923
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,119
if you know how to use it and you use it

924
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,480
right you can annihilate so many

925
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,040
different strep

926
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:20,280
conditions Shamrock over there in IG

927
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,520
this was me with IC whoa I see for 20

928
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,240
years of extreme bladder pain until I

929
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,880
found medical meum information thank you

930
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,480

00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:39,119
throat utti and kidney infections I now

935
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,560
have no pain and haven't had to run to

936
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,440
the doctor in many years this info Works

937
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,720
quote from you amazing and I will add to

938
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,520
that quote from you it does work it does

939
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,240
work it does it has a track record of

940

working that's the power of it you know

941
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,319
biohackers an informationist messing

942
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,880
around all these different things out

943
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:03,680
there on social can do that for people

944
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,560
this information does and that's why I'm

945
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,720
a messenger of s so's information

946
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,119
because it saves lives Maria over there

947
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,119
on YouTube great topic I used to get UTI

948
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,319
all the time and they are so painful

949
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:17,319
it's much better thanks to aw and S so

950
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:20,200
incredible let's go into a little bit of

951
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:21,800
protocol talk a little bit too let's

952
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,280
just double check we covered some stuff

953
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,720
right here let's talk about like the

954
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,920
different strains a little bit longer

955
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,559
the spa the different strains I want to

956
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,960
go into that over there on YouTube

957
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,240
wondering wishing good to see you

958
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,280
antibiotics used to be the go-to for our

959

family after medical meeting protocols

960
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:42,440

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,960
medium it's going to get me

967
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:02,319
emotional the because you know when you

968
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,880
heal it is everything Maria over there

969
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,880
on YouTube great topic I used to get UTI

970
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,720
oh I saw that one already great Chrissy

971
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,520
over there and I think um twitch Stitch

972
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:17,920
Chrissy I was in tears every time I had

973
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:20,400
a UTI I can't imagine the amount of

974
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,119
people that are going through it and

975
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,720
they go through it on levels that are

976
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:30,920
just devastating it's become like Super

977
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,880
Bug now level and it's brutal and so

978
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,520
many people suffer from it their guts

979
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,240
get ripped to shreds from all the

980
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,160
antibiotics they have to take they're on

981
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,920
steroids almost all the time and it's

982
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,200
brutal along the way strep got

983
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,079
classified as having a group a and a

984
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,440
group b yeah the medical world now

985
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:51,240
identifies strep all the way through

986
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,319
Group

987
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:58,160
H Group H though as you read about in

988
00:43:55,319 --> 00:44:01,240
the acne chapter cuz acne is Strep

989
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,160
caused by the way you guys it is it's

990
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,160
medical medum info but it's strep caused

991
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,480
that the population carries there are

992
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,280
also strains within the known groups

993
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,359
that are yet un that are yet

994
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,319
unidentified and undocumented so here's

995
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,800
how medicine

996
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:21,440
works medical research and science works

997
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:24,400
like this they've classified some of the

998
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,640
bacterium the strains but they haven't

999
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,040
classified all of them haven't even

1000
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,760
scratched the surface so the bacteria

1001
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,000
out there that they haven't even

1002
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,319
documented classified got their hands on

1003
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,680
or anything like that and that's the

1004
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:40,680
scary thing it's even

1005
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,359
scarier yep even a gifted and talented

1006
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:47,079
lab technician discovered that even if a

1007
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:48,480
gifted and talented lab technician

1008
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:50,000
discovered that there were more strains

1009
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,319
and groups of strep that weren't

1010
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,720
currently known the Breakthrough would

1011
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,720
go unrecognized the scientists would not

1012
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,559
be able to find funding for this area of

1013
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,480
critical medical importance because

1014
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:05,000
right now funding is too tied up in

1015
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,720
misled areas like how genes relate to

1016
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,400
disease so yeah you guys let's go into

1017
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,040
this a little bit now some protocol

1018
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,240
stuff I'm in cleans to heal if you don't

1019
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,240
have the book I feel bad for

1020
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:21,680
you get the book get the book get the

1021
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,920
book I mean you don't have to spend a

1022
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,960
$5,000 program on how to walk Barefoot

1023
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,400
on your on your lawn

1024
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,280
you can do that but it won't make your

1025
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,200
UTI go away keep that in mind you can do

1026
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,280
earth and you can do like you can would

1027
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,119
not wear shoes and you can watch the

1028
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,640
sunrise in the morning and you can angle

1029
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:43,079
your bed a certain way in your room the

1030
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,240
way the sunrises and sun sun sets but

1031
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:48,880
none of that's going to get rid of

1032
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:52,839
somebody's de debilitating acne sty UTI

1033
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:57,440
bladder infections kidney infections

1034
00:45:52,839 --> 00:46:00,839
P it's just not going to happen

1035
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,520
hardcore stuff that has to work then you

1036
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:07,000
can do all that stuff for fun the other

1037
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:09,839
stuff I was mentioning okay danan 144 on

1038
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,440
IG I was in so much pain for nine months

1039
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,680
with interstial cystis celery juice

1040
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,680
saved my

1041
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,599
life yeah and that's why when someone

1042
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,319
says celery juice sucks or celery juice

1043
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,680
isn't what it is or something out there

1044
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:26,040
that's it's actually such a disservice

1045
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,880
to the chronically ill it's so sad when

1046
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:32,040
celery juice literally has turned lives

1047
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,880
around saved lives yeah I know all right

1048
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,839
let's go into it pelvic inflammatory

1049
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:40,119
disease PID right here talks about UTI

1050
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:43,960
it's in here right here cleanse the

1051
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:47,640
heel all right the true cause bacterial

1052
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,680
infection of one or more strains from

1053
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,440
over 50 groups of

1054
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:56,680
strep there are different levels of

1055
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,520
PID it's like different levels of UTI

1056
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:02,280
different levels to all the different

1057
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,280
things different levels to

1058
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:07,599
sibo incredible okay so let's go into

1059
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,960

PID for overactive bladder too aloe vera

1077
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:13,040
two or more inches of fresh gel skin

1078
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,599
removed two or more inches of fresh gel

1079
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,240

powder another thing on the list cat's

1083
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:31,040
claw very interesting cat's claw

1084
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,359
critical for

1085
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:38,359
UTI critical for

1086
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:41,720
PID critical for men that are having

1087
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:43,319
prostatitis right there cat's claw it's

1088
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,119
a big one you'll hear more about cats

1089
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:46,640
claw every day out there and more about

1090
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,680
cats claw every day it's the medical

1091
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,280
medium information that got that out

1092
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:53,599
there catclaw was around it's been

1093
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,119
around obviously but using it for the

1094
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,839
things that it's being used for for

1095
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,480
protocol false is medical medium

1096
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:02,839
information originally for cat's claw

1097
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,839
curcumin and there you go that's another

1098
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:10,040
one de Manos yeah de Manos is

1099
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:12,160
great but you need more than deos if

1100
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,359
someone's dealing with UTI and pib and

1101
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,920
