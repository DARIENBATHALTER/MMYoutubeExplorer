i want to talk about mold the crazy

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,960
maker why did i name it the crazy maker

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
because

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,040
it could send you down a rabbit hole it

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,479
sent a lot of people down the rabbit

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,079
hole over the years

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,159
then you you know then there's a lot of

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,040
mold chasing doctors too

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
out there where they they chase mold so

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,439
they don't know what's going

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,280
on they don't know why someone has aches

56
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,520
and pains and tingles and numbness

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,479
and fatigue and brain fog and they don't

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,159
know why

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,680
someone has all that body pain and neck

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,360
pain and jaw pain

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,280
so they start they don't they weren't

62
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,640
taught that it's about viruses it's

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,560
about bacteria

64
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,840
and and toxic heavy metals and they

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
weren't taught about that so they don't

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,879
know that's why they

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,400
people have anxiety and you know medical

68
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,080
medium information so

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
what they do is there's some doctors out

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,879
there that are in the great pure

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
intentions and

72
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,160
they're loving doctors and are

73
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,319
compassionate and they look for mold

74
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,640
and they think that mold is the reason

75
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,000
why someone just can't get

76
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,400
better but when you get away from mold

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,400
so

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
say you actually were in a situation

79
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,720
where you were surrounded by mold or

80
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,160
mold was in your life and you get away

81
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,800
from mold

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,480
and you're still sick and still sick and

83
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,239
still sick there's a reason and it

84
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,599
wasn't the mold the mold was the trigger

85
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,239
and i talked all about this this is

86
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,920
really

87
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,280
incredible information and why why

88
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,040
would a family of five you know

89
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,680
not get sick from mold or a family of

90
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,519
four

91
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,519
or why would a family

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,360
you know be okay except for one member

93
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,400
in the family so why would like

94
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,200
say the mom be bedridden sick with

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
fatigue

96
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,640
and aches and pains and blurry vision

97
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,440
and dizziness

98
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,319
and and just stuck on mattress island

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,879
like many people

100
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,120
are and just be bedridden practically

101
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,000
and then the husband and the kids they

102
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,280
feel great

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,280
they're going out every day they're

104
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,239
going to the park they're going to the

105
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,280
beach

106
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,599
everything's great you know and and it's

107
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,799
because mold exposure

108
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,840
most mold exposure should make every

109
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,599
single person

110
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,760
sick if they were exposed but it doesn't

111
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,519
work that way there's office buildings

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,239
where you have like 50 people working in

113
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,120
one

114
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,200
and only three get sick and it's like

115
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,799
whoa they test for mold wait it's mold

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,159
it's mold it's mold if you're chasing

117
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,640
mold and molds bad

118
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,560
it's real bad but i talk about why it's

119
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,720
really really bad and why

120
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,720
people do get sick when they've been

121
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,000
around mold so

122
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,920

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,280

mold was in the faulty air ducts

it's all been replaced yeah what happens

210
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,160
is that

211

let's take a look that's it and

309
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,760
sabina says podcast is a life savior so

310
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,240
yeah the b-12 with dinosaur bomb methyl

311
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,399
volume

312
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
no preservatives none of that bad stuff

313
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,560
and then the alkyl no alcohol

314
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,000
no citric acid nothing like that in

315
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,279
there this is the cleanest stuff the

316
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,120
stuff i trust and everything so um

317
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,640
you guys the bottom line is when it

318
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,959
comes down to mold

319
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,160
you want to be easy on yourself okay you

320
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,440
want to pat yourself on the back

321
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,440
wherever you can you want to

322
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,040
be be compassionate towards yourself

323
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,480
because it's not your fault

324
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,360
mold sickness isn't your fault you

325
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,120
didn't do anything

326
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,279
wrong you didn't do anything to create

327
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,440
mold sickness it's not your fault there

328
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,560
so that's something that's really

329
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,160
important to know

330
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,640
and and um the bottom line is

331
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,200
it's a trigger a major trigger and

332
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,959
that's one thing no one really gets

333
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,040
and even the best mold doctors don't

334
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,440
know it's a trigger they think

335
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,360
the mold itself is totally the reason

336
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,800
why we get knocked down but really it

337
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,399
knocks down our immune system and then

338
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,360
we have more problems that talk about

339
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,440
that in there

340
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,880
so yeah um so so many people have mold

341
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,000
they have them in their walls they have

342
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,600
them everywhere

343
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,680
i think jenny fisher was just saying

344
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,480
that as the as her comment went up there

345
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,320
too

346
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560

352
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,200
so the medical medium heavy metal detox

353
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,560

354
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,640
people don't know and this is an

355
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,760
important one is that

356
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,320

i want to be helpful i wanted to make

394
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,480
sure i had this episode go out

395
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,320
i remember you requested it and i just

396
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
want you to have this information

397
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,920
so it's really important it is um

398
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,839
so jenny fisher says could my family

399
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,000
still be affected by the mold we were

400
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,399
exposed to for 10 years

401
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,399
well what happens is your your immune

402
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,320
system can get affected 10 years ago

403
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
when you're exposed to 10 years ago

404
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
or i'm not sure if the question was

405
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,360
you're exposed for it for 10 years

406
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,600
i mean through 10 years or it was 10

407
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
years ago but that what happens is your

408
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,920
immune system gets triggered

409
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,040
because it gets weakened and then other

410
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,880
things come out of

411
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,959
us like bacteria that we have in our

412
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,480
bodies and viruses we have in our bodies

413
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,519
and we just get sick so

414
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,199
it so the whole point of the episode too

415
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,800
is to say hey we could take control over

416
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,320
this whether we were affected by mold or

417
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,639
not and we could get better

418
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,839
we actually could get better and heal so

419
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,279
that's important too

420
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,760
got to check out the medical medium

421
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,839

so you guys the whole thing with mold is

458
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,920
like this it's there are some people

459
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,519
they don't get affected by it at all

460
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,600
like they could eat the stuff

461
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,800
they could breathe it in they could live

462
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,880
it they could just

463
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,639
it's all it just doesn't bother them

464
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,800
it's amazing how it works

465
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,079
and then there's someone that's all they

466
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,120
have to do is just live in it for a

467
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,000
little while

468
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,680
breathe it for a little while um be a

469
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,800
part of it for a little while and then

470
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,120
when they are

471
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,480

472
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,399

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,639
they just would be like no no no you're

490
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,519

essential oil and a diffuser that's what

605
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,240

like i wouldn't burn i personally

607
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,039

614
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,480
