[201.52 - 205.84] things that we've done it just years and
[204.72 - 209.04] decades
[205.84 - 212.24] nothing has moved the needle like
[209.04 - 214.24] celery juice has and you got to think
[212.24 - 215.36] about that for a little bit like what is
[214.24 - 218.24] up with that
[215.36 - 218.80] it's not just water because it's not
[218.24 - 220.00] water
[218.80 - 222.08] you know what you know what i hear all
[220.00 - 224.00] the time this is really funny
[222.08 - 226.48] i hear this all the time okay it's like
[224.00 - 229.60] when i just did that tick tock video
[226.48 - 230.64] and of of juicing celery and all that i
[229.60 - 233.36] hear this all the time
[230.64 - 234.48] it's just water you can get better just
[233.36 - 237.04] on water
[234.48 - 239.28] the the celery juices that's all it is
[237.04 - 242.32] that's funny because if you fill a fish
[239.28 - 244.00] tank with celery juice all the fish are
[242.32 - 246.08] gonna die
[244.00 - 247.52] you know why do you know why all the
[246.08 - 249.36] fish are gonna die in a fish tank when
[247.52 - 250.88] you just make it all celery juice and
[249.36 - 252.32] you have all your fish swimming in there
[250.88 - 252.88] and they're swimming in just celery
[252.32 - 255.52] juice
[252.88 - 256.64] do you know why because it's not water
[255.52 - 259.76] that's why
[256.64 - 264.00] celery juice is not water
[259.76 - 268.24] that's why okay and it's something more
[264.00 - 270.64] special something more powerful for that
[268.24 - 273.12] than that nancy says i feel much better
[270.64 - 275.36] when i drink celery juice incredible
[273.12 - 276.48] sharon says celery juice for sure moved
[275.36 - 280.40] my needle
[276.48 - 283.60] for the win right
[280.40 - 286.48] i mean and there's thousands and tens of
[283.60 - 289.76] thousands of testimonials
[286.48 - 292.56] and you got to think about that like
[289.76 - 293.60] you know i mean nothing has done that
[292.56 - 297.20] out there

[361.04 - 363.60] there's a little adapter on here which
[362.72 - 367.92] is incredible

[378.08 - 382.64] when it comes down
[379.28 - 383.12] to healing what are the tools we can use
[382.64 - 385.20] out there
[383.12 - 386.96] where are they you know what's going on
[385.20 - 389.20] and you got people out there that they
[386.96 - 391.28] don't know about celery juice yet
[389.20 - 392.80] and they're sitting there and they're
[391.28 - 394.88] the needle's not moving for them they
[392.80 - 396.40] can't get out of that rut
[394.88 - 397.76] they're trying all these different
[396.40 - 398.72] things they're seeing all these
[397.76 - 401.28] different people
[398.72 - 401.92] and they can't get to where they need to
[401.28 - 405.20] be
[401.92 - 408.40] and you know when it comes down to it
[405.20 - 410.80] it matters it matters when we
[408.40 - 412.32] find something that works it matters
[410.80 - 415.92] when we find something that
[412.32 - 416.64] changes our lives and celery juice has
[415.92 - 418.32] done that
[416.64 - 420.00] just for so many people you know my
[418.32 - 421.28] favorite thing is you guys
[420.00 - 422.80] and i'm going to juice some celery right
[421.28 - 424.96] now and talk about you know my favorite
[422.80 - 427.44] thing is which is really funny is
[424.96 - 428.08] people will be like oh that's just a
[427.44 - 430.08] crock
[428.08 - 431.52] celery juice is just where's the where's
[430.08 - 435.04] the data
[431.52 - 437.36] it's you know that that's it's placebo
[435.04 - 439.44] first of all i got to tell you something
[437.36 - 442.16] if placebo worked
[439.44 - 443.84] then no one would be sick not one of you
[442.16 - 445.12] no one no one you know would ever be
[443.84 - 445.92] sick in a million years all they would
[445.12 - 447.52] have to do
[445.92 - 449.12] is go see their doctor and their doctor
[447.52 - 451.28] give them a sugar pill
[449.12 - 453.68] and say this will fix you here's a sugar
[451.28 - 456.88] pill and all the problems will go away
[453.68 - 459.28] their ms their ra their autoimmune their
[456.88 - 459.92] hashimoto's direct some other psoriasis
[459.28 - 462.00] their vital
[459.92 - 464.56] vitiligo would all go away all you have
[462.00 - 465.92] to do is just give somebody a sugar pill
[464.56 - 468.88] and tell them it's gonna fix their
[465.92 - 471.84] vitiligo and it should all disappear
[468.88 - 473.52] so when you hear that that really silly
[471.84 - 475.44] placebo talk
[473.52 - 476.96] you gotta kind of like you gotta think
[475.44 - 480.16] about that one for a little bit
[476.96 - 483.28] okay placebo doesn't work it never did
[480.16 - 486.24] what works are things that work
[483.28 - 487.92] so the only thing that works are things
[486.24 - 491.20] that can actually work
[487.92 - 492.72] and look darcy lee um drinking celery
[491.20 - 496.48] juice for four years now
[492.72 - 499.68] ibs is gone so grateful well
[496.48 - 500.32] that's incredible sarah dredge my sister
[499.68 - 503.12] lorraine
[500.32 - 503.84] l put me on to you and celery juice i'm
[503.12 - 506.96] loving it
[503.84 - 507.92] and feeling a great boost i find i'm
[506.96 - 510.24] craving it now
[507.92 - 511.44] incredible you know it's so that's so
[510.24 - 513.60] amazing
[511.44 - 514.88] so incredible when i think about it and
[513.60 - 516.80] so
[514.88 - 517.92] it really has changed people's lives you
[516.80 - 521.20] guys know
[517.92 - 523.04] you're seeing it and so i mean so when
[521.20 - 524.32] you hear out there somebody say oh it's
[523.04 - 526.80] all water
[524.32 - 527.76] um that's funny because it's not all
[526.80 - 530.80] water
[527.76 - 532.56] or someone says it's just placebo that's
[530.80 - 534.96] another funny one too
[532.56 - 536.32] because placebo doesn't fix anybody it
[534.96 - 539.76] never did
[536.32 - 543.12] um so we know that right but
[539.76 - 545.28] what's amazing is people i've known
[543.12 - 546.56] 35 plus years they're stick when they
[545.28 - 549.28] get stuck
[546.56 - 550.48] and they need to move forward man i've
[549.28 - 552.40] seen people out there

[798.08 - 801.44] fixing all the time and i'm dumping
[800.96 - 803.04] money
[801.44 - 804.72] in all the time now i got to get a new
[803.04 - 808.00] set of tires
[804.72 - 808.96] now i got to get now i got to get a new
[808.00 - 811.92] set of brakes
[808.96 - 815.44] right off the running and all of a
[811.92 - 817.76] sudden you're spending all this money
[815.44 - 818.64] with this juicer it's like you're buying
[817.76 - 821.28] celery
[818.64 - 822.16] okay and celery gets pricey at certain
[821.28 - 823.68] times of the year
[822.16 - 825.44] it can get a little pricey right it
[823.68 - 827.12] could cost a little bit more
[825.44 - 828.48] and people say well it's expensive to
[827.12 - 831.20] juice that much celery
[828.48 - 832.00] it's actually not um because of what it
[831.20 - 833.60] does for you
[832.00 - 835.28] it's incredible on that level but here's
[833.60 - 838.16] the thing if you're one of those
[835.28 - 839.12] if you're concerned about it costing
[838.16 - 841.36] like more
[839.12 - 843.44] like you're saying well that's a head of
[841.36 - 844.96] celery is 99 cents or a head of celery
[843.44 - 846.88] is 1.99 or
[844.96 - 848.88] whatever it is in whatever grocery store
[846.88 - 850.80] or wherever you are in the world
[848.88 - 852.88] the point is is that when you're
[850.80 - 854.40] squeezing the juice out of it you're
[852.88 - 857.36] saving money
[854.40 - 858.64] and that's the key like for me i've used
[857.36 - 861.68] celery for
[858.64 - 864.08] 30 plus years right and
[861.68 - 865.36] what i noticed when i use this juicer so
[864.08 - 866.40] far because i'm doing a little
[865.36 - 869.36] experiment
[866.40 - 870.88] with that like how much money can i save
[869.36 - 872.48] and
[870.88 - 874.48] when i'm juicing celery with this
[872.48 - 877.76] machine every day because i juice a lot
[874.48 - 878.64] so i do 32 ounces minimum every single
[877.76 - 880.48] day
[878.64 - 881.84] i got a pile of celery right here you
[880.48 - 886.64] guys see that right there
[881.84 - 889.52] um but i do 32 ounces minimum each day
[886.64 - 890.00] that's what i do right so i want to know
[889.52 - 893.04] am i
[890.00 - 895.44] saving money and it turns out i am
[893.04 - 896.56] that's what's incredible i'm squeezing
[895.44 - 898.56] more juice
[896.56 - 899.92] out of the celery that goes through this
[898.56 - 902.16] machine
[899.92 - 903.68] that i've done in any machine i got a
[902.16 - 906.32] garage
[903.68 - 907.28] filled with machines like every company
[906.32 - 910.80] out there
[907.28 - 913.12] and this is the one i use
[910.80 - 914.40] so this is the one i back this is the
[913.12 - 917.84] one i back
[914.40 - 920.08] but the point is is when you're
[917.84 - 921.52] buying half the celery that you would
[920.08 - 923.68] normally buy
[921.52 - 924.56] or a fraction of what you would normally
[923.68 - 927.28] buy
[924.56 - 928.32] for your juice that alone pays for the
[927.28 - 930.16] juicer
[928.32 - 932.16] so by the end of the year you're like
[930.16 - 935.04] well i just saved all that money
[932.16 - 935.76] that could buy a whole bunch of juicers
[935.04 - 937.28] you know
[935.76 - 939.52] and it's kind of like that it's really
[937.28 - 939.52] cool
[939.76 - 944.48] can use this juicer for other veggies
[942.64 - 946.72] that question i answered earlier
[944.48 - 947.92] yeah you can and that's what's that's
[946.72 - 951.20] what's amazing
[947.92 - 952.96] um so let's talk about something really
[951.20 - 954.72] cool here if you see it
[952.96 - 958.08] this is what i wanted to show you guys
[954.72 - 962.48] about this juicer i really love
[958.08 - 962.48] okay i almost have a full container here
[963.52 - 971.36] and the amount of pulp is a lot less
[968.16 - 974.88] it's like dry too it's like
[971.36 - 976.24] it's it's it's compressed and it's dry
[974.88 - 982.32] so that's what's really cool and i'll
[976.24 - 984.56] show you how that works
[982.32 - 986.64] and look if you guys got a juicer at
[984.56 - 988.00] home i know people that got a blender
[986.64 - 990.48] they blend it and they strain it through
[988.00 - 993.12] a cheesecloth i'm all for that
[990.48 - 994.32] totally do that you don't have to get to
[993.12 - 999.20] get the shoe stretch not
[994.32 - 999.20] it use the juicer that you have totally
[1000.56 - 1004.00] you can totally do that so i'm going to
[1002.88 - 1005.28] give you a couple of tips that are
[1004.00 - 1006.72] really good i'm going to shut this off
[1005.28 - 1009.68] for a second
[1006.72 - 1009.68] and i'm going to grab
[1009.76 - 1017.20] a myself right here so when i look at
[1013.44 - 1020.32] how much pulp is in here okay
[1017.20 - 1023.68] this is this is unbelievable that's
[1020.32 - 1028.08] it a little string okay
[1023.68 - 1030.72] and i wanted to show you this it's dry
[1028.08 - 1031.12] i mean it's dry you can't find celery
[1030.72 - 1034.16] juice
[1031.12 - 1036.16] the bottom of this you can't look
[1034.16 - 1037.76] look how dry it's so dry it's like a
[1036.16 - 1040.96] little piece of rope
[1037.76 - 1043.36] and it's not like all this pulp
[1040.96 - 1044.88] and all this all this you know pulp and
[1043.36 - 1047.76] fiber and leftover
[1044.88 - 1048.96] it's a little stringy rope that's dry to
[1047.76 - 1052.16] the bone
[1048.96 - 1055.52] and where did all the juice go
[1052.16 - 1059.20] right i hardly used any celery
[1055.52 - 1061.76] and the money saved in my opinion
[1059.20 - 1062.96] it's insane so that's what i really love
[1061.76 - 1064.72] about this model
[1062.96 - 1066.00] but it's this model though you know it's
[1064.72 - 1067.68] not like another model
[1066.00 - 1070.88] though you know it's this model and
[1067.68 - 1074.08] omega says the mm-900 hds
[1070.88 - 1078.32] and but i want to show you guys because
[1074.08 - 1080.96] i feel kind of like guilty knowing
[1078.32 - 1081.68] knowing that i'm getting so much celery
[1080.96 - 1083.68] juice
[1081.68 - 1085.12] and a lot of you guys are and i feel bad
[1083.68 - 1087.20] so i have to at least let you know in
[1085.12 - 1090.00] case you ever do down the road
[1087.20 - 1090.88] maybe next year two years from now six
[1090.00 - 1093.76] months from now
[1090.88 - 1094.48] you actually you know get the juicer or
[1093.76 - 1096.40] something
[1094.48 - 1098.16] but you can use the juicer you have you
[1096.40 - 1098.88] can use it forever it's fine the juicer
[1098.16 - 1102.08] you have
[1098.88 - 1103.68] but i feel like if i don't tell you that
[1102.08 - 1106.00] you can have this experience where i
[1103.68 - 1108.48] just have this this is so dry
[1106.00 - 1109.36] it's it's unbelievable and this
[1108.48 - 1112.24] experience of
[1109.36 - 1114.88] only having this much in your container
[1112.24 - 1118.40] that's dry to the bone
[1114.88 - 1120.00] and then have all this juice it's like
[1118.40 - 1121.36] it's just something to think about you
[1120.00 - 1123.20] know what i mean it's like that kind of
[1121.36 - 1125.04] thing don't add water so let's talk
[1123.20 - 1128.32] about this a little bit
[1125.04 - 1131.20] if you juice your celery juice celery
[1128.32 - 1133.36] look i have this big container and that
[1131.20 - 1133.68] is all i have for pulp left over and
[1133.36 - 1137.76] it's
[1133.68 - 1140.08] dry to the bone it's in my fingertips
[1137.76 - 1141.36] it's like what the heck when you think
[1140.08 - 1143.04] about that
[1141.36 - 1144.64] you know and at the same time you can
[1143.04 - 1146.24] juice any vegetable and anything you
[1144.64 - 1146.72] want in this juicer that's just really
[1146.24 - 1149.36] cool
[1146.72 - 1150.00] so don't add water to your celery juice
[1149.36 - 1152.16] if you blend
[1150.00 - 1153.84] it in a blender if you if this is how
[1152.16 - 1155.60] you do it right if you juice your celery
[1153.84 - 1158.64] juice in a blender
[1155.60 - 1161.44] um don't add water okay
[1158.64 - 1163.36] just blend it and let it mush up there
[1161.44 - 1164.96] and blend and let it get shredded up in
[1163.36 - 1167.12] there and then until you're ready
[1164.96 - 1168.48] and then dump that into a cheesecloth
[1167.12 - 1171.04] and squeeze it out
[1168.48 - 1172.72] and do it that way but don't add water
[1171.04 - 1175.20] if you add water
[1172.72 - 1177.32] it doesn't work celery juice won't work
[1175.20 - 1179.04] you can't use it
[1177.32 - 1180.80] therapeutically it'll still give you
[1179.04 - 1182.40] some nutrition for sure
[1180.80 - 1184.48] like you'll see your celery juice if you
[1182.40 - 1186.00] add water to it or ice cubes or
[1184.48 - 1188.32] lemon to it will still give you
[1186.00 - 1192.48] nutrition but it won't
[1188.32 - 1194.40] do the magic that's changing the lives
[1192.48 - 1195.60] of millions around the world right now i
[1194.40 - 1198.80] mean i would
[1195.60 - 1200.24] i would estimate over 300 million people
[1198.80 - 1203.36] in the world right now and more
[1200.24 - 1205.36] are drinking it therapeutically but and
[1203.36 - 1207.76] i know a lot they kind of miss the boat
[1205.36 - 1210.08] on it they'll throw lemon in there
[1207.76 - 1211.36] they'll put water in there they'll put
[1210.08 - 1213.12] ice cubes in there
[1211.36 - 1214.96] they'll juice other things in there but
[1213.12 - 1216.64] they'll still call it their celery juice
[1214.96 - 1218.56] but it's not gonna work like
[1216.64 - 1220.40] really therapeutically like move the
[1218.56 - 1224.08] needle like it needs to move
[1220.40 - 1225.28] debra cole um is it on sale for black
[1224.08 - 1228.56] friday yes
[1225.28 - 1230.80] totally on or i think i originally used
[1228.56 - 1232.48] a different juicer for about four months
[1230.80 - 1235.84] but then bought this one
[1232.48 - 1236.64] when my old one broke in the end i saved
[1235.84 - 1239.52] money because
[1236.64 - 1241.68] one bag or 2.5 pounds of celery makes
[1239.52 - 1242.88] around 32 ounces but would have to use
[1241.68 - 1245.12] 1.5 bags
[1242.88 - 1246.96] which might with my old juicer to make
[1245.12 - 1250.48] 32
[1246.96 - 1252.88] 32 ounces so so you're saying you're
[1250.48 - 1255.12] doing less you're using less
[1252.88 - 1256.08] so that's amazing okay and that's
[1255.12 - 1259.84] incredible i mean
[1256.08 - 1264.80] i can tell you with the mm-900 it's less
[1259.84 - 1268.24] so i'm just making sure i got that right
[1264.80 - 1271.20] so you save money incredible
[1268.24 - 1271.20] with the new juicer
[1271.76 - 1274.88] amazing amazing that's the way and you
[1274.40 - 1276.80] know what
[1274.88 - 1278.64] it's happening for me it's just
[1276.80 - 1280.72] happening for me too
[1278.64 - 1281.92] but i like i said i feel like if i don't
[1280.72 - 1285.12] tell you guys
[1281.92 - 1286.88] especially when there's a sale it's like
[1285.12 - 1288.72] you know i want you to be able to take
[1286.88 - 1291.28] advantage of this down the road and
[1288.72 - 1294.16] and be able to or anytime be able to get
[1291.28 - 1297.68] that experience like this is dry
[1294.16 - 1299.52] so dry it's ridiculous like and that's
[1297.68 - 1300.72] that's what's incredible so i have all
[1299.52 - 1304.80] this juice
[1300.72 - 1307.44] right here so i'm gonna
[1304.80 - 1307.44] pour it in
[1313.68 - 1319.84] i still got leftover this is a
[1322.16 - 1327.04] i'm gonna put this over here still got
[1324.08 - 1328.80] left over in the container but
[1327.04 - 1331.12] i didn't have my celery juice yet today
[1328.80 - 1333.20] so i'm really excited about this
[1331.12 - 1334.32] but this is a cold pressed juicer too a
[1333.20 - 1336.08] lot of people be like
[1334.32 - 1337.92] okay there's a question nina what about
[1336.08 - 1340.72] celery powder um no
[1337.92 - 1342.08] terrible terrible that's that celery
[1340.72 - 1345.60] powder is a scam
[1342.08 - 1348.16] for sure and it just can't do anything
[1345.60 - 1350.08] and i talk about it in the celery juice
[1348.16 - 1351.92] book
[1350.08 - 1353.60] so the medical medium celery juice book
[1351.92 - 1354.96] i talk about it in here
[1353.60 - 1356.72] so just letting you know that's a
[1354.96 - 1357.76] medical medium celery juice book and the
[1356.72 - 1360.64] subtitle
[1357.76 - 1362.56] is incredible because it says the most
[1360.64 - 1366.40] powerful medicine of our time healing
[1362.56 - 1370.32] millions worldwide and guess what
[1366.40 - 1372.64] fact fact already happened
[1370.32 - 1374.16] all these years so it's a great thing to
[1372.64 - 1374.48] see when people are getting their lives
[1374.16 - 1378.00] back
[1374.48 - 1381.92] it's a beautiful thing um
[1378.00 - 1382.96] and celery powder it doesn't do anything
[1381.92 - 1386.48] so you're putting just
[1382.96 - 1388.96] dead powder you know right in
[1386.48 - 1389.68] some water which you're not supposed to
[1388.96 - 1392.32] do
[1389.68 - 1393.44] so you're not supposed to add water to
[1392.32 - 1397.04] celery
[1393.44 - 1400.24] juice well if you're going to rehydrate
[1397.04 - 1400.96] celery juice from a powder and you add
[1400.24 - 1402.40] water
[1400.96 - 1404.64] it's not going to be the same thing and
[1402.40 - 1407.92] i'll tell you why this is in its
[1404.64 - 1410.24] living fresh form and
[1407.92 - 1412.00] the water is connected to the sodium
[1410.24 - 1414.96] cluster salts
[1412.00 - 1417.12] right now in it alive and it's in here
[1414.96 - 1420.08] doing its thing it's all connected
[1417.12 - 1422.16] it's all attached to itself the sodium
[1420.08 - 1425.44] cluster salts are suspended
[1422.16 - 1426.48] in the living water but you can't kill
[1425.44 - 1428.08] it
[1426.48 - 1429.60] you can't just kill it like that and
[1428.08 - 1432.16] turn it into powder
[1429.60 - 1432.72] and then expect to add water to it and
[1432.16 - 1435.52] think
[1432.72 - 1436.00] the same thing is going to happen that's
[1435.52 - 1438.80] like
[1436.00 - 1440.24] throwing something in the blender that's
[1438.80 - 1441.20] like throwing something in a food
[1440.24 - 1443.84] processor
[1441.20 - 1446.32] and expecting to put it back together
[1443.84 - 1449.44] after it's been chopped up and diced up
[1446.32 - 1452.24] it's just it doesn't work um
[1449.44 - 1454.24] so i'm glad you guys are here yeah
[1452.24 - 1457.04] strain it so robert
[1454.24 - 1458.80] definitely strain it that's what i do
[1457.04 - 1459.84] you you want to strain it you want to
[1458.80 - 1461.84] take a strainer
[1459.84 - 1463.52] even though you're juicing it here it's
[1461.84 - 1465.20] already being juiced you still want to
[1463.52 - 1465.84] strain it so when i was pouring it in
[1465.20 - 1467.44] here
[1465.84 - 1470.00] i was straining it that's what i was
[1467.44 - 1472.16] doing right here
[1470.00 - 1474.88] of course i just spilled a little but
[1472.16 - 1474.88] yeah there you go
[1477.60 - 1479.92] um
[1481.52 - 1488.64] molina vimergi's celery force
[1485.12 - 1492.00] has no celery in it no that's actually
[1488.64 - 1493.68] that's actually for an incredible
[1492.00 - 1495.20] that's an incredible supplement for all
[1493.68 - 1496.96] kinds of stuff that's not
[1495.20 - 1498.48] it's called celery forest but there's no
[1496.96 - 1500.32] celery in there you can look you can
[1498.48 - 1502.56] actually look into it
[1500.32 - 1504.56] at vimrgy.com it's a wonderful
[1502.56 - 1506.88] supplement that's not celery powder
[1504.56 - 1509.84] that's not what that is
[1506.88 - 1512.24] anyway you guys so i'll talk a little
[1509.84 - 1514.80] bit more about this
[1512.24 - 1515.68] and let's talk about benefits celery
[1514.80 - 1518.88] juice benefits
[1515.68 - 1522.32] what happens when you're
[1518.88 - 1525.04] drinking this why does it even work
[1522.32 - 1526.88] why is it helping people what's going on
[1525.04 - 1527.20] with that that's that's the question
[1526.88 - 1530.48] there
[1527.20 - 1531.84] so here's what happens with celery juice
[1530.48 - 1535.20] there's something in here called
[1531.84 - 1538.24] sodium cluster salts that's not salt
[1535.20 - 1541.04] it's not the same thing salt can't do
[1538.24 - 1542.08] what this does this is a subgroup of
[1541.04 - 1545.04] sodium
[1542.08 - 1547.04] and it's suspended in living water but
[1545.04 - 1550.32] it's a subgroup of sodium
[1547.04 - 1553.44] that actually interferes
[1550.32 - 1557.12] with pathogens so if you have
[1553.44 - 1559.92] epstein-barr if you have
[1557.12 - 1561.28] streptococcus in your system if you have
[1559.92 - 1564.56] if you have anything if you have
[1561.28 - 1567.76] hashimoto's ms lupus
[1564.56 - 1569.12] ra chronic fatigue syndrome tingles
[1567.76 - 1570.08] numbness aches and pains that are all
[1569.12 - 1572.88] mysterious jaw
[1570.08 - 1575.12] pain neck pain back pain if you have
[1572.88 - 1579.12] restless leg syndrome insomnia
[1575.12 - 1580.16] depression anxiety eczema psoriasis skin
[1579.12 - 1583.84] problems
[1580.16 - 1584.88] ticks and spasms twitches dizziness
[1583.84 - 1587.92] ringing in the ears
[1584.88 - 1590.24] floaters in the eyes all these viral
[1587.92 - 1591.84] symptoms if you have all these different
[1590.24 - 1594.40] viral symptoms
[1591.84 - 1595.60] and toxic heavy metal symptoms the
[1594.40 - 1598.08] reason why
[1595.60 - 1599.28] people start to get their lives back
[1598.08 - 1601.84] when they're bringing this
[1599.28 - 1602.32] in as one of the tools as one of them
[1601.84 - 1605.60] and i
[1602.32 - 1607.84] never said this is the only thing to do
[1605.60 - 1609.92] this is just one of the powerful medical
[1607.84 - 1613.04] medium tools right
[1609.92 - 1615.76] but when this enters your body
[1613.04 - 1617.20] something magical happens to begin with
[1615.76 - 1619.44] inside of us
[1617.20 - 1621.04] we have a big mess going on inside of us
[1619.44 - 1623.60] okay we got
[1621.04 - 1624.08] rancid fats clinging to our intestinal
[1623.60 - 1626.56] tract
[1624.08 - 1629.04] we got putrified proteins clinging to
[1626.56 - 1631.36] the walls of our intestinal tract lining
[1629.04 - 1633.28] it's harboring all kinds of bacteria
[1631.36 - 1635.60] it's harboring all kinds of toxins
[1633.28 - 1636.80] and when the celery juice enters and
[1635.60 - 1640.24] goes in
[1636.80 - 1643.20] it goes into that first it
[1640.24 - 1644.80] starts to knock out bugs bugs that get
[1643.20 - 1647.28] behind sibo
[1644.80 - 1648.56] small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
[1647.28 - 1652.56] bugs that get behind
[1648.56 - 1655.92] acid reflux bugs that cause all kinds of
[1652.56 - 1657.36] stomach bloating stomach pain
[1655.92 - 1660.00] if you're somebody that's worried about
[1657.36 - 1662.48] worms of any kind in your gut
[1660.00 - 1664.80] it even goes after those and that's the
[1662.48 - 1668.00] thing when it's going down in
[1664.80 - 1671.36] it's starting to dismantle the bad
[1668.00 - 1672.56] things and it's starting to clean things
[1671.36 - 1674.32] up if you were told
[1672.56 - 1676.24] you got parasites in your gut and that's
[1674.32 - 1679.60] why you're sick whether it's right
[1676.24 - 1681.84] or wrong or whatever the celery juice
[1679.60 - 1683.60] starts to work on it if you were told
[1681.84 - 1685.36] you got bacteria in your gut and your
[1683.60 - 1688.40] microbiomes off
[1685.36 - 1690.96] and your guts all in balance
[1688.40 - 1692.00] and you got bad bacteria and mold and
[1690.96 - 1695.52] yeast
[1692.00 - 1699.20] and fungus in your gut the celery juice
[1695.52 - 1701.60] starts to work on that and
[1699.20 - 1702.88] one ounce of celery juice isn't going to
[1701.60 - 1706.24] do that much
[1702.88 - 1707.76] it's still good it's still good but it's
[1706.24 - 1709.76] not going to do as much
[1707.76 - 1712.48] like melody says what can i do for sibo
[1709.76 - 1715.44] i'm talking about sibo right here and
[1712.48 - 1717.20] the celery juice goes down in there and
[1715.44 - 1722.00] it starts to shock
[1717.20 - 1725.04] those bugs starts to basically electrify
[1722.00 - 1728.08] those bugs starts to move them
[1725.04 - 1728.96] out starts to weaken them starts to
[1728.08 - 1731.76] break
[1728.96 - 1732.72] down their membrane that keeps them
[1731.76 - 1735.60] strong
[1732.72 - 1736.96] and then the celery juice goes down in
[1735.60 - 1739.12] and it finds its way
[1736.96 - 1740.08] into the liver it goes into the hepatic
[1739.12 - 1742.08] portal vein
[1740.08 - 1743.84] it finds its way into the liver up into
[1742.08 - 1746.08] the liver and then
[1743.84 - 1748.00] it starts to go after little buggies in
[1746.08 - 1751.52] there and starts to
[1748.00 - 1755.04] dismantle toxins neutralize them
[1751.52 - 1755.92] so one of my favorite benefits of celery
[1755.04 - 1758.64] juice
[1755.92 - 1760.24] one of my favorite benefits is it
[1758.64 - 1763.60] neutralizes
[1760.24 - 1766.40] poisons that have energy to them
[1763.60 - 1768.08] meaning they're on a charge because
[1766.40 - 1770.24] poisons and toxins
[1768.08 - 1772.48] from toxic heavy metals and pesticides
[1770.24 - 1775.32] and herbicides and plastics
[1772.48 - 1778.08] and petroleum chemicals and
[1775.32 - 1781.68] nanotechnology that we breathe in
[1778.08 - 1784.96] everything that we get exposed to
[1781.68 - 1787.84] has a charge to it and the celery juice
[1784.96 - 1789.20] starts to neutralize that charge turn it
[1787.84 - 1790.96] around
[1789.20 - 1792.56] and that's what's amazing about it right
[1790.96 - 1795.36] there it's one of the things
[1792.56 - 1797.84] it it basically diffuses poisons and
[1795.36 - 1800.24] toxins and at the same time
[1797.84 - 1801.36] starts to break down the bugs the bugs
[1800.24 - 1803.20] that are behind acne
[1801.36 - 1804.48] so when you start drinking celery juice
[1803.20 - 1807.28] and your acne
[1804.48 - 1809.44] is starting to get better that's because
[1807.28 - 1811.92] the streptococcus the bacteria behind
[1809.44 - 1814.48] all the cystic acne that everybody has
[1811.92 - 1816.00] is getting cleaned up from the celery
[1814.48 - 1819.04] juice
[1816.00 - 1821.20] and so when celery juice
[1819.04 - 1822.64] gives somebody the runs or gives
[1821.20 - 1825.92] somebody a little bit of
[1822.64 - 1827.36] of diarrhea or give somebody
[1825.92 - 1830.40] something like that where it's loose
[1827.36 - 1833.68] stools when celery juice does that
[1830.40 - 1834.80] it's killing bacteria is what it's doing
[1833.68 - 1837.20] so i always recommend
[1834.80 - 1840.16] you can reduce the dosage you can do
[1837.20 - 1842.56] eight ounces you can do six ounces
[1840.16 - 1843.92] you can do a little less but eventually
[1842.56 - 1846.96] it goes away
[1843.92 - 1849.28] that the runs or diarrhea or anything
[1846.96 - 1852.48] like that goes away eventually
[1849.28 - 1856.00] and that's what happens because
[1852.48 - 1859.04] the celery juice ends up killing and
[1856.00 - 1860.96] cleaning up the very bacteria and any
[1859.04 - 1862.32] kind of yeast any kind of mold any kind
[1860.96 - 1864.32] of fungus that's in the way
[1862.32 - 1866.16] cleans it up shocks it out gets it out
[1864.32 - 1867.84] of the system so you can do a lower
[1866.16 - 1870.96] amount of celery juice if you guys just
[1867.84 - 1873.60] got on here this is the mm-900 hds

[2017.92 - 2021.92] book
[2018.80 - 2022.48] the distance i like is 20 minutes to 30
[2021.92 - 2025.44] minutes
[2022.48 - 2026.00] 15 minutes the minimum would be the
[2025.44 - 2027.84] minimum
[2026.00 - 2029.84] i would do like like what i do in the
[2027.84 - 2033.12] morning is i do lemon water
[2029.84 - 2036.64] in the morning and then lemon water
[2033.12 - 2038.72] i i did it first give it a little time

[2040.64 - 2043.84] right
[2041.52 - 2045.60] but i keep that separate from the celery
[2043.84 - 2048.08] juice the celery juice
[2045.60 - 2050.40] comes later i wait a half an hour so i
[2048.08 - 2053.36] wait 30 minutes but you could wait
[2050.40 - 2054.40] 15 to 30 minutes after you had your
[2053.36 - 2056.24] lemon water
[2054.40 - 2058.32] and then you can do your celery juice
