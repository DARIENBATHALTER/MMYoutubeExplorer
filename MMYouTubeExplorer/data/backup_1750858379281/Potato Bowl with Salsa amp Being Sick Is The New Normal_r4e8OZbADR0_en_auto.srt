one talks about it really

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,760
unless they heard it from medical medium

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,519
and then went out there and of course

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,440

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
works you guys it's it's it's

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,519

science

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200

are the sheep

611
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,799

612
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,400

all the industries got your number they

624
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,039
got your number

625
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,559
they use the media they use the

626
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,600
advertisements they use the advertisers

627
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:26,720

you guys are being trained to accept

630
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,720
being sick as the new normal and not

631
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
question it

632
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,159
and not question research in science

633
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,640
every time you hear research in science

634
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,159
you have to bow you have to bow it

635
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
doesn't matter if it's the stupidest

636
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,559
study you've ever heard

637
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,679
right it doesn't matter if it's the

638
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,880
stupidest study

639
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,880
you've ever heard listen

640
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,880
it doesn't matter

641
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,240
all right this is all set toasted up

642
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,360
nice

643
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,360
let's get this in here

644
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,640
i don't know if you guys can see this

645
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,640
sorry about this where's my etiquette

646
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,279
where's my not showing you guys

647
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,000
right here and i'm gonna

648
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,520
this bowl is a little bit trickier so

649
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,840
we're just gonna

650
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:37,600
there we go nice

651
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,600
i get a nice potato bowl right here

652
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,880
and i'm gonna make a salsa too so i got

653
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,880
the potato bowl

654
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,720
so this is a deep bowl so it's got a

655
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,679
different different vibe to it right

656
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,520
different look

657
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,600
here it is you got the onions you got

658
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,200
the mushrooms you guys see this on tik

659
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,960
tok you see this on youtube facebook

660
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,000
mushrooms onions you got the red bell

661
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,760
peppers

662
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,279
right you got the and then you have the

663
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,120
potatoes that are nice and brown they

664
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,520
were pre-steamed and then i threw them

665
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,000
in the

666
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,600
in the on the griddle there and started

667
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,120
moving them around getting them nice and

668
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,919
toasty right

669
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,760
okay no oil in this so no insulin

670
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,000
resistance

671
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,039
really important to know no insulin

672
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,039
resistance

673
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,880
think about that a little bit because

674
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,960
everybody they're living by insulin

675
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,399
resistance and they're living by chasing

676
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
a high which i'll talk about again a

677
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,039
little bit

678
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,399
that's what they live by and the oil

679
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,960
causes your adrenal

680
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,679
your adrenaline to surge and flood the

681
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,600
oil causes adrenaline to surge and flood

682
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,720
so you get addicted to fat that's how

683
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,039
it's done right

684
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,159
and then now you're on this roller

685
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,440
coaster ride

686
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,440
it's to thin out your blood your

687
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,799
adrenals release all this adrenaline to

688
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,399
thin out your blood right that's how

689
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,559
it's done

690
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,000
yeah smoky mountain paradise i think i

691
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,200
see you guys

692
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,320
and yeah so anyway that's but we still

693
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,120
got more to go

694
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,120
and more to do

695
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,120
yeah you guys the industries sit there

696
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,399
and they mastermind a way to keep you

697
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,399
guys tricked fold

698
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,640
and duped the wool being pulled over

699
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,559
your eyes it's constant all the time

700
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,320
and it's it's happening in alternative

701
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,200
medicine it's just not just conventional

702
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,919
medicine

703
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,520
and it's supposed to be the new normal

704
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,120
and you're never supposed to doubt it or

705
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,640
question it and you're never supposed to

706
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,559
think science of research

707
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,279
is missing a beat you're never supposed

708
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,520
to think that they failed

709
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,880
the heck out of everything that they

710
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,080
failed us

711
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,039
that their failures absolute

712
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,320
failures failures failures and chronic

713
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,640
illness right

714
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,399
when someone's literally laying in their

715
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,600
bed they've seen 10 neurologists and

716
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,360
they can't function

717
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,360
and nobody knows really what's wrong and

718
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,559
they have 10 theoretical

719
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,640
diagnoses they failed them

720
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,880
that's what that is it's not the doctor

721
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,279
that failed them it's science of

722
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,360
research that failed the doctors and

723
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,960
failed the patients right and i believe

724
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,679
in science and research i do

725
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,799
it's not that i don't it's not that i

726
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,919
don't

727
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,480
okay but in chronic illness they have

728
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,200
failed

729
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,880
miserably denial is a place where

730
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,559
science and research lives

731
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,120
then here's how it works at science

732
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,880
research the industry itself

733
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,559
spends billions to make sure they police

734
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,279
you your police so that everywhere you

735
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,480
go

736
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,480
you believe they have they have your

737
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,480
back and they have all the answers and

738
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,080
everything's perfect in science and

739
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,279
research world

740
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,519
that's how it's that's how it's staged

741
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,760
and the minute you get sick the blame is

742
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,000
on you it's your fault clubhouse it's

743
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,919
all

744
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,640

your fault totally your fault

750
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,600
science research they have all the

751
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,399
answers apparently they know everything

752
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,799
so you being sick it's your fault tick

753
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,080
tock

754
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,360

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,800
that's why on tick tock when all the

846
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,520
science research trolls

847
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,040
report you because they say that science

848
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,880
is everything

849
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,000

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,680
didn't have science in it

855
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,000
yeah that's why we love science so much

856
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,560
it's so nice

857
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,240

the new normal

860
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:08,079
but isn't science and research so cuddly

861
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,240

clubhouse you want a nutshell

870
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,720
i and i don't mean a nut in a nutshell

871
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,880
but you guys want a nutshell okay the

872
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,079
system's rigged

873
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,359
so that you guys are brainwashed by

874
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,480
the science and research cult

875
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,680
not only that there's a lot of cults out

876
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,359
there

877
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,640
it's not about freedom like here in the

878
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,920
medical mean community because you're

879
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,599
free to be

880
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,839
you're free to do whatever you want

881
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,119
right but

882
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,640
in the colts out there it's rigged

883
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,720
and they all do the same thing

884
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,320
they all parrot the same thing they all

885
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,680
mirror the same thing

886
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,359
they're all the smoke and mirrors right

887
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,000
right michelle miller right

888
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,680
and right chris you seem fine to me and

889
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,800
that's how it's done out there

890
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,359
okay and then they blanket it under the

891
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,160
nice science research blanket

892
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,720
that's how it's done and then every

893
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,480
single

894
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,599
person gets sicker and sicker and sicker

895
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,400
and sicker that's how it's done

896
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,440
and it's the new norm educating myself

897
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,320
good to see you today

898
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,320
that's the new norm all right yeah

899
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,720
tight werner says that's true exactly

900
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,000
exactly

901
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,040
and that's how it's done out there okay

902
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,720
um kathy says have an open mind yeah

903
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,960
have an open mind

904
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,040
it's a good one right there have an open

905
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,240
mind to what's happening out there

906
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,079
and you gotta understand something

907
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,520
here's how the colts work out there

908
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,040
they have think tanks like i was telling

909
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,440
you guys in clubhouse a little bit while

910
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,240
ago

911
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,040
right they got think tanks designed to

912
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,440
make sure

913
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:20,240
you never ever ever stop your addictions

914
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,400
you stay addicted you won't know you're

915
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,400
addicted until you get rid of it

916
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,760
you won't know you're addicted until you

917
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,800
get rid of it

918
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,720
okay you won't know you won't know that

919
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,560
every single bug in your body

920
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,960
wants to eat those eggs that you're

921
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,599
eating you won't know the egg addiction

922
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,800
until you

923
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,440
rid it until you rid the eggs

924
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,640
that feed every bug in your body that's

925
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,440
right

926
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,000
you won't know the addiction until you

927
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,200
knock out

928
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,480
that chocolate bar right

929
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,599
until you break that chocolate addiction

930
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,720
because the caffeine industry has

931
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,079
you brainwashed they need you addicted

932
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,520
for the rest of your

933
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,920
life until you're in your grave

934
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,960
until you're in there they the caffeine

935
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,359
industry

936
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,119
i wouldn't doubt it if they don't come

937
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,359
up with a drink

938
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,880
you give someone after they passed away

939
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,160
that's caffeine-based

940
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,079
like no no no just just pour it in their

941
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,079

and i'm just going into caffeine for a

985
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,800
second i'm not talking about all the

986
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,319
industries on a whole right including

987
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,000
much of the alternative medicine

988
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,480
industry it's about making sure you guys

989
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,359
stay brainwashed your whole life

990
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,400
and making sure you stay confused and

991
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,000
making sure you stay

992
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,880
sick you have to stay sick

993
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,920
you have to yeah now it's about coffee

994
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,680
and tumeric right

995
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,240
exactly take turmeric which is actually

996
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,319
a great a great healing tool right

997
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,359
and now mix it in with coffee right

998
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,280
exactly let's

999
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,720
let's see you know that's what i mean

1000
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,480
let's see how many people just

1001
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,000
buy into it because of the addiction of

1002
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,520
coffee right

1003
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,960
and it's it's actually evil when you

1004
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,000
think about it

1005
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,400
but you know who who might say anything

1006
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,640
i guess

1007
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,680
everybody just do what you want to do

1008
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,119
but

1009
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,480
the bottom line and still gonna i'm

1010
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,160
still gonna love you i'm never gonna

1011
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,599
it's not about shaming i'm never gonna

1012
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,839
judge you

1013
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,520

1014
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,359

so i'm never gonna judge you ever ever

1016
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,280
because it's not your fault you're

1017
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,599
addicted it's not your fault that the

1018
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,079

no one telling you you just did 35 40

1171
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,040

1176
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,920
that the industries just wanted you to

1177
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,079
destroy your bodies

1178
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,960

1182
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,800
one thing right there

1183
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,200

night

1186
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,160
you need that warm fuzzy science and

1187
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,680
research

1188
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:26,240
blanket making you feel safe at night

they got your back it's gonna be okay

1191
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,839
so bridgette says she craves vinegar

1192
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,920
yeah i mean i don't blame you for

1193
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,920
craving it just do you know what happens

1194
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:53,680
but you're not craving vinegar by itself

1195
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,599
right you're not craving it by itself

1196
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,680
wait so you're craving vinegar so much

1197
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,920
that you crack open that vinegar bottle

1198
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,760
and you're just drinking it is that is

1199
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,079
that how it works

1200
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,359
with vinegar you crack open the bottle

1201
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,640
and you're drinking it

1202
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:11,119
right i'm just curious or do you crave

1203
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,520
what you're putting it on

1204
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,800
are you craving what you put it on i'm

1205
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,359

00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:20,720
are you craving with the vinegar goes on

1208
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,040

1209
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:27,040
goes on fat

1210
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:30,079

1217
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,359

right telling you how you guys are

1286
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,400
tricked and duped to eat it

1287
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,160
telling you how science and research

1288
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,160

1291
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,559
i can do what am i gaining besides a

1292
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,520
headache

1293
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,800
from all the tick top trolls what am i

1294
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,040
gaining

1295
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:31,040
right exactly so i mean

1296
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,160
think about that one for just a few

1297
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,640
minutes

1298
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,160
think about that one lisa says is

1299
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,400
autoimmune real or just

1300
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,760
false label used when inflammation can't

1301
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,920
be explained

1302
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,040
but pretty much absolutely see

1303
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,839
autoimmune

1304
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,760
symptoms symptoms of what they demoted

1305
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:50,240
immune are real everybody's sick

1306
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,480
right but inflammation isn't just it

1307
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,920
right it's what causes that inflammation

1308
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,920
nobody knows

1309
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,440
right medical medium information about

1310
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,200
what causes inflammation

1311
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,359
is the only thing out there that's ever

1312
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,559
been sound in real answers for the first

1313
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,720
time in our history

1314
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,839
okay we talk about in the medical medium

1315
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,920
book spirit of

1316
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,599
compassion and i talk about how you've

1317
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,440
got the epstein-barr virus

1318
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,839
causing so much of that inflammation and

1319
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,079
then you end up with an autoimmune

1320
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,920
diagnosis

1321
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,640
okay but your body's not attacking

1322
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,200
itself so that's wrong out there that's

1323
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,760
misinformation that's a theory don't you

1324
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:27,119
love when science research

1325
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,000
gives you a theory and then for some

1326
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,680
reason we're supposed

1327
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,400
to believe that that's some kind of

1328
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,839
concrete fact

1329
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,920
you know and i talk about this in book

1330
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,520
one medical medium book one

1331
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,880
secrets behind chronic mystery illness

1332
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,400
and how to finally heal this is it the

1333
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,280
new edition you guys i'm holding it in

1334
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,040
my hands

1335
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:49,680
right holding it in my hands

1336
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:53,280
so science research is so smart

1337
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:55,559
and cause of autoimmune is unknown

1338
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,160
and all they can do is use a theory from

1339
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:02,079
1953 that your body is attacking

1340
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,920
itself which was a theory right

1341
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,520
because they've never proved it or found

1342
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,880
out that's even possible

1343
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:12,000
it was a it was a suggestion

1344
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,760
and so now what science research is just

1345
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,800
iron clad

1346
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:21,920
24 karat gold

1347
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:25,280
that was the 1950s the 1950s you guys

1348
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,440
this this rotary phone

1349
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,359
is technologically more advanced than

1350
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,559
the 1950s

1351
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:34,480
this rotary phone right here is far

1352
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,400
more advanced than the phones they were

1353
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,359
using in 1950

1354
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:43,119
when they came up with the theory that

1355
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,119
that your body was attacking itself

1356
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:53,200
so a 1950s theory

1357
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:57,920
right of your body attacking itself

1358
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,920
became 24 karat gold

1359
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:07,040
irony is it became 24 karat gold to the

1360
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:09,520
big pharma man

1361
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,839
because they're banking on you guys

1362
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,000
they're banking on you guys

1363
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:20,079

1367
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,599
they're banking on you guys

1368
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,559
they're driving around the range rovers

1369
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,920
baby

1370
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:35,280
they're range rovers yep

1371
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,240
big pharma they got their maserati in

1372
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,640

bentleys in there

1379
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:56,960
bmws are a joke to them

1380
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,079
range rovers a joke to the big pharma

1381
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,680
boys

1382
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,359
they laugh at somebody with a range

1383
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,400
rover

1384
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:05,680
spirit corrected me

1385
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,040
i was talking about range rover

1386
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,520
everything and spirit combat just like

1387
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,799

rolls that's what they got

1391

they got you thinking

1398
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:31,040
oh science research is going to catch me

1399
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,839
when i fall

1400
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,440
could catch me after the 50th

1401
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,319
neurologist

1402
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,960
right you guys on clubhouse jessica john

1403
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,000

catch you

1407
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,760
look i'm not insulting incredible er

1408
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,720
doctors that have to put your broken

1409
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,799
bones together

1410
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,000
i'm not insulting the surgeons i know

1411
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,359
personally

1412
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,280
that change heart valves i'm not

1413
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:06,640
those are mechanics those are mechanics

1414
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:10,240
those are nuts and bolts you cut

1415
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,720
out a part you keep the person half dead

1416
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,240
so they don't awaken when you cut them

1417
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,280
open

1418
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,240
they you anesthesia the person to the

1419
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,920
point where

1420
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:24,240
they're almost dead but not dead

1421
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,880
i talked to a lot of anesthesiologists

1422
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,160
and they're like here's how it works aw

1423
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:34,640
here's how it works we gas

1424
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:38,160
them enough so we can put the knife in

1425
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:40,240
replace the parts but yet not

1426
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,880
kill them with the anesthesia there's

1427
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:46,480
this borderline

1428
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,680
right yeah

1429
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,799
borderline michelle miller you're right

1430
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:56,000
you're right but and so and then

1431
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:59,760
but but science is good like that

1432
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,240
if your body's been hurt by their traps

1433
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,839
all through your lifetime the cacao and

1434
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,000
the vinegar and your teeth are falling

1435
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:08,079
out and all this other stuff happens

1436
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,599
your appendix blows up because you

1437
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,720
caught your third variety of

1438
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,760
streptococcus

1439
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,440
and in e coli caused your diverticulitis

1440
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,960
you didn't know how to take care of

1441
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,799
yourself all these years

1442
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,160
and you got to get a piece of colon cut

1443
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,440
out i talked to surgeons you got to get

1444
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,040
a piece of colon cut out

1445
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,799
you got to get your your appendix

1446
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,640
removed you got to get a gallbladder

1447
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:28,240
removed because it damaged from years

1448
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,760
ago right

1449
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,760
and you got to get that done okay

1450
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,280
and we got some good surgeons out there

1451
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,720
of course we got a lot of bad surgeons

1452
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,920
and they make mistakes too i talked to

1453
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,119
surgeon he's like well man there's a lot

1454
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,920
of bad surgeons out there

1455
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,280
yeah but science and research does the

1456
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,400
nuts and bolts

1457
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:50,079
pretty good nuts and bolts anything

1458
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,280
past that it is literally just russian

1459
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,000
roulette

1460
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,359
it's russian roulette but lots of bank

1461
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,559
lots of bank

1462
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,559
rolls royces and bentleys off the

1463
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,839
sheeple

1492
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:33,440
let's get a little red onion in this you

1493
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:35,359
don't need a lot of red onion in here

1494
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,000
lorraine did you see that you see the

1495
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,000
onion squirt

1496
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:46,960
that's one for the record books huh

1497
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,960
seaweed hero did you see that

1498
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:58,160
loon did you see that all right you guys

1499
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,119
i'm making a really simple salsa let's

1500
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,799
put some lime in there

1501
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,280
the reason why you guys don't see me use

1502
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:07,440
salt is because you guys have so many

1503
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,160
deposits of salt inside your body you

1504
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,280
don't know

1505
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,920
here's how salt works did you know you

1506
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,119
can have

1507
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,760
salt crystallizations crystallizations

1508
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,240
of salt

1509
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,520
inside your liver inside organs

1510
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,319
connective tissue

1511
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,000
salt deposits inside your brain that are

1512
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,280
not being productive they're not working

1513
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,079
you guys on clubhouse this is really

1514
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,160
important

1515
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,559
these salt deposits they become these

1516
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,880
crystallizations

1517
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,119
that eventually get seen on an mri as a

1518
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,400
mystery condition

1519
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:41,839
do you know that we salt ourselves to

1520
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:45,599
death we fat ourselves to death

1521
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:48,480
okay and then science and research

1522
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:50,480
throws studies that are useless at us to

1523
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,240
death

1524
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:56,559
it's it's it's insane we caffeine

1525
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:59,839
ourselves to death

1526
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:03,280
yeah we vinegar ourselves to

1527
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:08,319
death we alcohol ourselves to death

1528
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:08,319
that's what we do yeah we do

1529
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,160
salt deposits can sit inside you and not

1530
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,440
dissolve

1531
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:18,319
did you know that they can crystallize

1532
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,960
and trap cells and cells get all

1533
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:24,000
dehydrated in these clumps inside your

1534
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,000
body did you know that

1535
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,079
yeah that's how it is

1536
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:34,559
so we keep on dumping more salt we salt

1537
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,680
ourselves to death dump more salt dump

1538
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,200
more salt you know what

1539
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,760
you know what some idiotic trainer is

1540
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,760
going to tell you

1541
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:45,039
put a pinch of salt in your in your

1542
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:47,520
water grab a pinch of salt in your water

1543
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,480
you need salt grab a yeah you should be

1544
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,079
getting it from like

1545
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:55,760
celery and spinach and lemons

1546
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:56,799
lemon has sodium in it natural occurring

1547
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,079
sodium

1548
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:01,039
right the real kind and it's okay if you

1549
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,520
guys use a pinch

1550
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,160
of really high quality salt okay here

1551
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,480
and there

1552
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,440
it's just that the reason why i'm so hey

1553
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,359
no salt

1554
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,799
because so many of you guys have salt

1555
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:13,839
packed in your

1556
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:14,640
body it's packed in there it's packed

1557
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:18,079
away

1558
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:20,160
in there okay and restaurants and foods

1559
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,200
and vegan food and all that is loaded

1560
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,280
with salt

1561
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,359
that's that we've been trained to have

1562
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,280
that salt taste

1563
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:29,440
needing that salt lick like being

1564
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:31,359
addictive to sodium

1565
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,880
we can be addicted to the bad sodium

1566
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,160
because our body wants the good sodium

1567
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,599
but instead of drinking the celery juice

1568
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,599
we're going to pound all this bad salt

1569
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,760
i'm going to put a little cayenne in the

1570
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,359
salsa so get ready for that

1571
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,440
i got a couple different options right

1572
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:48,880
here i got this dried

1573
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,720
cayenne right and i still got to make a

1574
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,720
little bit of a salad real quick too

1575
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,160
so let me do that let me put a little

1576
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,280
let me put a little bit of the super

1577
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:59,440
chili in here

1578
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:02,160
okay a little bit of the super chili

1579
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,160
let's do that

1580
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,960
i'm not mincing this super chili really

1581
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,720
intensely

1582
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,839
because i know that if i mince it more

1583
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:15,440
and more that salsa is going to be real

1584
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:15,440
hot it's gonna be real hot

1585
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:22,640
it is it is all right so i got a nice

1586
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:26,960
salsa a real easy one vinegar free

1587
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:30,240
vinegar free one step to reversing a cut

1588
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:33,119
from a knife that's right

1589
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,400
thousand cuts death by a thousand cuts

1590
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,640
just reverse the cut

1591
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,240
boom didn't add vinegar in there boom

1592
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,839
didn't add a whole bunch of lump of salt

1593
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,760
in there

1594
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:45,920
boom just reverse two cuts

1595
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,880
see right let's go the opposite

1596
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,440
direction

1597
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,280
instead of instead of the direction that

1598
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,240
the alternative movement wants you going

1599
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,359
into 24

1600
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,960
7 just a slow direction to your death

1601
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,119
but yet they get they take away your

1602
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,400
processed foods right on clubhouse you

1603
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,200
guys heard that before

1604
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,359
keep away your processed foods keep away

1605
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,440
your fried foods your fast foods oh

1606
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:11,440
brilliant real smart

1607
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:14,079
real smart keep away those

1608
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,039
right and then and then you know have

1609
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,520
your balance of

1610
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,520
carbs have your balance of fats have

1611
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,200
your balance of proteins but not know

1612
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,200
why anybody's sick and not know how to

1613
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:27,200
fix anybody

1614
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:29,680
right let's uh throw together a little

1615
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,760
salad

1616
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,280
um one thing i like in my salad is this

1617
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,240
beautiful green leaf lettuce did you

01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,480
guys see this right here

1619
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,480
okay

1620
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,359

and cookies and donuts and all that

1624
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,640
of course you're gonna feel a little bit

1625
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:53,440
better yeah you're gonna that's one step

1626
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,559
that's a step drink more water another

1627
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,520
good step right there

1628
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,520
drink more water

1629
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:05,839
yeah right common sense stuff

1630
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,640
common sense stuff let's make a little

1631
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,079
side salad this is going to be good i'm

1632
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:18,000
putting some lettuce in here

1633
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:20,480
this is green leaf lettuce

1634
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
but that's not enough when you're sick

1635
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,680
that's not enough when you're getting

1636
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,760
sicker that's not enough if you've been

1637
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,760
injured by a new medical treatment

that's not enough

1639
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,000
a lot of keto people are gonna learn the

1640
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:34,400
hard way in the next one

1641
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,079
to five years man they're gonna learn

1642
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,799
that their exercises

1643
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:41,200
and their keto clean keto diet wasn't

1644
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,200
enough

1645
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,839

let's try another 14 vials of blood

1652
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,880
let's try

1653
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:02,720

extra cilantro is a leafy green right

1662
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,480
there this medical medium information

1663
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,880
i don't use other people's information

1664
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,240
never did you hear it here and you think

1665
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,039
you heard it somewhere else that means

1666
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,039

a pinch of it

1680
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,599

1681
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,480
like i was saying before if you wanted

1682
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,000

01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:40,319
um diet yeah

1708
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:42,159
not eating much anything else trying to

1709
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,239
keep my bloating down keep my weight

1710
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:46,560
right

1711
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:48,880
what what do you mean what do you mean

1712
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:53,279
that's the atkins diet

1713
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:54,920
no it's not it's a carnivore diet

1714
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,000
you mean it's just the atkins diet from

1715
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:02,000
1980 what

1716
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:05,199
and it never it didn't fix anybody

1717
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,400
i thought it was new i was watching a

1718
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:09,120
youtube i thought it was

1719
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:11,199
new i thought it was the carnivore diet

1720
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,880
keto diet carnivore diet all that kind

1721
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,960
of thing you know keep your carbs out

1722
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,480
the whole bet just do meat maybe some a

1723
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,239
little bit of like a hard cheese or

1724
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:21,440
something

1725
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:24,320
that's the atkins diet really

1726
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:27,040
it's already been there done that people

1727
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,040
lived and died

1728
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,159
really so i'm just a new fool trying it

1729
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,400
but i'm feeling better on the carnivore

1730
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,600
diet i'm just eating meat

1731
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,400
a few eggs and the hard cheese it's

1732
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,800
because

1733
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,640
i got rid of like so much of the other

1734
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,159
crap i was eating yeah true i was eating

1735
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,000
a lot of stuff i was having pizza on the

1736
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,840
weekends too

1737
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,760
all right so what do you suggest

1738
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,800
something better so you're saying it was

1739
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,480
already done

1740
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,320
it was done over and over again why do

1741
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,120
people keep on getting tripped then like

1742
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,600
me

1743
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,840
how am i why are people constantly

1744
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,000
getting tricked then

1745
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,440
because every five years no one knows

1746
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,080
history

1747
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,600
so we just don't know history we don't

1748
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,840
know any of our history then we don't

1749
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,239
know all the mistakes that have been

1750
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,840
made

1751
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,360
we don't know how many people died from

1752
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,199
antibiotic treatments with lyme disease

1753
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,440
they just they're all gone

1754
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:21,360
so there's no history like oh history

1755
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,840
repeats itself constantly because of all

1756
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,000
the screw-ups they're never really

1757
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,360
oh they're never really taught to

1758
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,960
anybody so what

1759
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:33,840
what do people learn in school though

1760
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,679
so no one's being taught the constant

1761
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,480
mistakes over and over again

1762
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,040
including in health all the disasters we

1763
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:45,040
just repeat it over and over again

1764
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:46,560
oh all right i gotta think about that

1765
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,239
gotta wash this cucumber for a second

1766
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,920
you guys

1767
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:53,440
yeah hey did you ever think about that

1768
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:57,040
one right there

1769
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:59,199
yeah it's kind of funny had a doctor

1770
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,159

01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:36,080
right all you guys there john right jess

1816
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,320
and all you guys out there right did you

1817
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,960
know that you know where tomato got the

1818
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:42,080
bad

1819
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:45,600
wrap right we used to have

1820
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,120
lead plates so everybody ate off of lead

1821
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,719
plates

1822
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:54,159
100 years ago or more right and

1823
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:55,360
so what happened was anything that had

1824
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:58,960
any kind of

1825
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:01,760
acid right like anything

1826
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,679
that was kind of slightly even anything

1827
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,960
moist or wet

1828
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:10,080
right so like cucumber cut

1829
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:12,560
open in pieces or tomato

1830
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,679
cut open in pieces okay this is

1831
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,960
important to know

1832
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:21,199
right anything wet or

1833
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:24,640
a soup in a lead bowl

1834
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:26,719
okay anything like that would bring the

1835
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,600
lead out

1836
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,320
you get more lead off the plate anything

1837
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,880
wet

1838
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:35,440
that had any kind of mineral composition

1839
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,120
tomatoes are high in minerals

1840
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,760
right anything with a mineral

1841
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:41,679
composition tomato

1842
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,120
any kind of soup any kind of fruit

1843
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:44,640
anything and

1844
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,320
what it would do is when you put

1845
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,840
anything like that in any kind of

1846
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,400
minerals any foods

1847
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,280
plant foods with minerals in them tomato

1848
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:55,040
being a real

1849
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:57,199
wet juicy mineral rich food

1850
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,600
with a little bit of that acid right you

1851
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:02,640
put that in that lead bowling lead plate

1852
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,880
and then you draw the lead out

1853
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,480
and that's why tomato and a whole bunch

1854
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,920
of other foods got a bad rap

1855
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:12,000
many years ago soup had a bad rap a

1856
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:14,719
hundred years ago from lead plates

1857
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,239
lead bowls people would be poisoned

1858
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,920
after eating their soup

1859
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,440
and then they'd be going through what in

1860
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,520
the soup just poisoned me

1861
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,080
because now you know my husband's laying

1862
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,239
down he can't even breathe or move

1863
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,159
we're all sick here at the table what

1864
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:30,400
was it so everybody's like somebody

1865
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:32,640
poisoned soup somebody poisoned the soup

1866
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,480
but what was happening is we started to

1867
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:38,320
learn that eating off of

1868
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:42,239
lead plates and bowls was really a bad

1869
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:45,679
idea and the tomato caused

1870
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:49,440
like caught a bad wrap because

1871
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:50,960
there used to be fried green tomatoes

1872
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,960
fried green tomatoes fried green

1873
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,480
tomatoes that was a big thing

1874
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,159
fried green tomatoes that was a big

1875
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,480
thing many many years ago

1876
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:59,199
that was a really big thing and it was

1877
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,600
fried in

1878
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:03,520
oil and juice and all that and they

1879
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,199
would go on the lead plate and

1880
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,400
it would just kind of that wetness would

1881
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:10,080
just bring out that lead

1882
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,760
okay it's one of the reasons why i took

1883
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,960
a bad rap

1884
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,960
not because of night shade

1885
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,440
everybody was eating off of lead plates

1886
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,000
a lot of things took the bad rap too

1887
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,440

tomatoes for no reason

1935
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,159

01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:03,360

alternative medicine and there's a whole

1939
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,360
bunch in conventional medicine

1940
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,560

1941
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,480
science of research cult

1942
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,080

the

1969
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:03,360
space for a little bit and remember

1970
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:04,640
you're you're a high chaser until you're

1971
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,719
taught

1972
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,239
that they wanted you to be a high chaser

1973
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,120
and then you learn

1974
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:12,960
how to back out of that high chasing

1975
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,080
sustain yourself

1976
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,159
and when i if i hear that word

1977
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,640
sustainability one more time i hear that

1978
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:21,440
word fair trade one more time

1979
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:24,000
all i do is i kind of line that up too

1980
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:26,719
how about if we sustain ourselves

1981
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,600
how do we learn how to sustain ourselves

1982
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,440
how do we learn

1983
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,520
how to be fair to ourselves and our

1984
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:34,239
bodies you know

1985
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,679
and we need to switch those words around

1986
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:37,760
really take care of us instead of

1987
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,800
downing a whole bunch of

1988
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,080
cacao or matcha tea because it's

1989
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,560
sustainable

1990
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:46,239
and i'm sorry there's nothing about

1991
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,960
cacao that's sustainable

1992
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:50,400

1993
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,640
