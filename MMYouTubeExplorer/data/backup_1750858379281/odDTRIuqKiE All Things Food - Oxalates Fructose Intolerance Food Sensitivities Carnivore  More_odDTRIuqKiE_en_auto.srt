they're eating

101
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,800
because they have a symptom or condition

102
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,720
so when you get a symptom

103
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,159
when you get diagnosed with a condition

104
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,959

105
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,319
told that

108
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,519
it must be your foods causing the

109
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,280
problem right

110
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,200
it's your food causing the problem of

111
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
your symptom it's the food causing the

112
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,480
problem of your

113
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,480
of your condition you know and because

114
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,680

they're you know they're worried about

116
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,239
that and then they get told hey

117
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,040
you know it's these foods then how come

118
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,519
so many people

119
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,360
are allowed to eat whatever they want

120
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,159
how come so many people are allowed to

121
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,560
eat

122
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,040
whatever they want to eat you know and

123
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,040
they can eat it for years and years and

124
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,760
years and years you know i hear about it

125
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,400
all the time

126
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,840
you know my parents can eat anything

127
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,439
they want at age 80.

128
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,439
my grandparents can eat whatever they

129
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,640
want in their 90s and they still are

130
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
eating whatever they want they could

131
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,920
have gluten they can have

132
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,560
anything dairy products all this stuff

133
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,760
they can eat junk they can have packaged

134
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,480
donuts

135
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,080
packaged donuts not even not even a

136
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,439
donut from a donut shop

137
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
and they can just eat what they want to

138
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,239
do and how come they can do it and

139
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,160
they're not worried

140
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,079
what about that whole thing they're not

141
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,360
worried about what they're eating what

142
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,520
they're not eating they're not

143
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,479
they're not even thinking about it okay

144
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
and then

145
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,080
what about people who like now like

146
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,520
everybody's worried they got a symptom

147
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
they got a condition

148
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,120
and now they're worried it's incredible

149
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,960
because there's a reason

150
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
and maybe look maybe you're one of the

151
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,960
people that you're thinking like well

152
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,800
you know the foods got me sick and

153
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
that's why i finally got a symptom

154
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,400
that's why i finally got a condition

155
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,800
well so for you

156
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,479
it took to your 20 to get a symptom and

157
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,560
the foods got you sick

158
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,600
why but why didn't they get like someone

159
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
who's 85

160
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
sick why can they eat all the gluten

161
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,240
they want to eat why can't they eat

162
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,320
everything they want to eat

163
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,960
look so um die you said my parents 96 94

164
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
so annoying they're uh they won't they

165
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,600
won't listen

166
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,919
oh my god you know and they're probably

167
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
eating what they want right 94 and 96

168
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,240
years old

169
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,360
and but yet you can be 40 years old and

170
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,039
we're worried about what we're eating

171
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,400
because we're dealing with symptoms

172
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,639
because that's the whole thing

173
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
everybody's getting symptoms now young

174
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
and younger and younger and getting

175
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,479
sicker with these symptoms and

176
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,479
conditions

177
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,240
and but the thing here there's a lot of

178
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,720
issues about this so

179
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,680
let's talk about that right now too okay

180
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,360
and

181
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,840
you know it's there's

182
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,400
how come how come someone doesn't get a

183
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,720
symptom

184
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,960
and how come somebody does get a symptom

185
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,240
all right science and research

186
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,199
both conventional and alternative don't

187
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,080
know why

188
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,000
someone gets tingles numbness mysterious

189
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,600
you know mysterious tingles numbness

190
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,520
aches and pains it's mysterious

191
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,759
dizziness vertigo okay

192
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,720
uh floaters in the eyes that are

193
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,199
mysterious

194
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,080
burning skin jaw pain that's mysterious

195
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
it won't go away

196
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,560
neck pain that's mysterious and won't go

197
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,759
away migraines

198
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,360
fibromyalgia all the different other

199
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,720
conditions oh my god you can list all

200
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,639
the autoimmune conditions science

201
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,280
research doesn't know it causes eczema

202
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,960
psoriasis all these different things so

203
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
it goes on and on and on

204
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,400
okay and but here's the deal

205
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,720
science and research both conventional

206
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,120
and alternative believe

207
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
that your body's attacking itself and in

208
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
the i'm telling you right now mark my

209
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,759
words on this

210
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,560
just mark them right here and right now

211
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,759
all right

212
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,479
that pretty soon coming up every single

213
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,319
symptom

214
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,840
every single condition somebody has

215
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,080
every single symptom every single

216
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,080
condition somebody has

217
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,720
it's gonna be called autoimmune no

218
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,479
matter what it's going to be rare few

219
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,919
symptoms or conditions they're not going

220
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,720
to call autoimmune they're going to

221
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,199
package up

222
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,199
everybody's mysterious symptom

223
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,319
everybody's mysterious condition

224
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,160
and they're going to lump it into

225
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,960
autoimmune because alternative

226
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,840
conventional

227
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,639
research in science medicine only

228
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
believe

229
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,560
that your body's destroying itself that

230
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,919
your body's creating this auto antibody

231
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,520
and it's going out to destroy your

232
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,880
glands like your thyroid condition is

233
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,479
because your body's attacking it

234
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,080
your eczema your psoriasis because your

235
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,360
body's attacking your skin it's

236
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,520
attacking your body

237
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,039
so that's how it's done right let's see

238
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,479
alternative medicine though and i'm

239
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,160
going to get into all the food stuff

240
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,280
it's so important we're on all things

241
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,479
food tonight

242
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:32,080
alternative medicine believes

243
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,800
that foods are triggering our autoimmune

244
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,599
foods are a trigger because alternative

245
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,560
medicine

246
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
science research doesn't know why we're

247
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
sick either

248
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,720
they don't know why we're sick either so

249
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,800
they're like well gluten is triggering

250
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,720
off your autoimmune gluten is triggering

251
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,720
off your body's problem well

252
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
interesting well how come all these

253
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
people that are older in the generation

254
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,080
they're 90 years old they're 85 years

255
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,000
old they're 80 years old you guys

256
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,280
and they're not getting triggered

257
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,759
by gluten they're not getting triggered

258
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,919
by dairy products they're not getting

259
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,560
triggered by something okay

260
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,800
it's because the younger generation now

261
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,280
has a lot of bugs and a lot more

262
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
toxins a lot more bugs and a lot more

263
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,280
toxins that's why

264
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,560
and so when you have a lot more bugs and

265
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,080
a lot more toxins

266
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
you end up getting symptoms and you end

267
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,520
up getting them early on

268
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,240
you know getting them at 19 years old 20

269
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,960
years old 22 years old 25 years old

270
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,639
you know getting at 35 40 however it is

271
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,520
you end up getting all these symptoms

272
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,959
all these conditions

273
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,560
you get diagnosed with the lyme you get

274
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,519
diagnosed with the fibro the multiple

275
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,519
sclerosis

276
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,880
uh you get diagnosed with fibromyalgia

277
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,560
all like i said that all these

278
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,880
rheumatoid arthritis you get all these

279
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,720
different diagnoses and

280
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,399
and that's what happens in the end okay

281
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
and so now

282
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,760
we're in this point where we have to

283
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,560
choose a belief system a diet belief

284
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,560
system

285
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,600
because we're being pushed into it we're

286
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,000
being pushed into having to choose

287
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,279
a diet belief system should i go vegan

288
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,040
should i go plant-based

289
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,959
should i start a keto diet should i

290
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,600
start a keto vegan diet should i start a

291
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,600
keto

292
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,160
animal protein diet should i do

293
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,760
carnivore what should i do and you know

294
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
and everybody's got their own tips

295
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,320
they're like try carnivore try keto

296
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,160
try this try that and there's all these

297
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,160
different belief systems we're getting

298
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,399
pushed into because we have no choice

299
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,480
because we want a quick fix we want an

300
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
answer because we're not getting an

301
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,880
answer from science or research to why

302
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,160
we're

303
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,720
really sick with all these different

304
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,240
symptoms and conditions so we get pushed

305
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,560
into this so now we're getting to where

306
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
now we gotta pick a diet belief system

307
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,279
we get pushed into

308
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,279
we end up getting totally brain screwed

309
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,480
in the end that's what happens and it's

310
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,640
really sad

311
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,920
because you know in the end it's not all

312
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,760
about food

313
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,760
it's not all about food in the end

314
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,880
it's about something else it's about the

315
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,000
bugs we have

316
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,160
inside of us is what it is

317
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
it's about the epstein bars it's about

318
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,680
this the shingles viruses it's about

319
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760
cytomegalovirus it's about if you got

320
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,079
the herpes simplex one

321
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
the cold sore a fever blister a fever

322
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,399
blister is simplex okay so that's herpes

323
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,560
right

324
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,320
so you got the fever blister okay well

325
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,200
when that fever blister heals up and

326
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,279
it's gone

327
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,720
the virus still creates symptoms it

328
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,160
still can give you headaches it still

329
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,760
can give you jaw pain it still can give

330
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,240
you neck pain it still can make you feel

331
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,680
weird

332
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,600
it can still give you some braid fog it

333
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,000
can give you all kinds of stuff

334
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,440
but the bottom line is we have all these

335
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,079
different pathogens in

336
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
all of us we have the epstein bars we

337
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,519
have

338
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,959
sediment virus we got the simplexes we

339
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,040
got the streptococcus

340
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,320
and because of that and because so many

341
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,240
people are dealing with so

342
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,360
many pathogens and pathogenic issues

343
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,800
where we're we end up like

344
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,160
looking in all kind of alternative

345
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
sources because eventual medicine

346
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,399
doesn't believe food has anything to do

347
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
with anything

348
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,519
alternative medicine believes that

349
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
food's important

350
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,640
food is medicine alternate medicine

351
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,800
believes food is medicine

352
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,680
alternative medicine though still though

353
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
doesn't know

354
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,519
why everybody's sick with autoimmune

355
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,959
conditions so they call it autoimmune

356
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,320
the body attacking stuff they still

357
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,279
don't know why they'll say maybe it's

358
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,959
leaky gut

359
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,880
maybe it's something else maybe it's

360
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,760
candida maybe it's this theory maybe

361
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,839
it's that

362
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,680
and they're still confused so what

363
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,320
happens it leads to people to start like

364
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,240
okay

365
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,079
what do we do we gotta we gotta think

366
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,880
about foods get off of processed foods

367
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,720
get off of

368
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,480
uh fried foods get off of greasy foods

369
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
get off of fast foods start with that

370
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
you start feeling better you know get

371
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,640
off of that thing but it squeezes us

372
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,399
and we end up squeezing down to now

373
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,920
we're afraid of all kinds of things to

374
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,120
eating and then we gotta pick a diet

375
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
belief system

376
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,279
think about it would anybody go vegan or

377
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,120
plant-based would how many people would

378
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,600
really go vegan or plant-based if they

379
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,839
weren't

380
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,160
pushed that direction because they were

381
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,560
having a symptom or a condition right

382
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,320
of course you get the crowd that the you

383
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,440
know the animal rights crowd of course

384
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,440
and the animal rights crowd

385
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,720
they'll go vegan or plant-based some of

386
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,279
them will go vegan or plant-based

387
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,399
because

388
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,160
you know the whole thing of killing

389
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
animals and all that okay for sure

390
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,560
they'll

391
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,920
be that crowd but the majority of the

392
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
plant-based movement which is still

393
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,959
small

394
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
the majority of the vegan movement which

395
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,760
is still small

396
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
they're they're all about their symptoms

397
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,279
end up pushing them

398
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,320
into more plant-based or into

399
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,079
plant-based

400
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
because why would they ever do that same

401
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,360
thing with like with the paleo crowd or

402
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,320
the keto crowd or the animal protein

403
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,160
crowd you think

404
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,600
they would actually eat really clean

405
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,040
like they do and and

406
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,880
and keep out the processed foods and

407
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,399
keep out all the bad stuff and keep the

408
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,480
gluten out for good

409
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,000
and you think they'd actually do that if

410
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,920
they didn't have to because they weren't

411
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
developing some kind of symptom of some

412
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,720
kind they weren't developing some kind

413
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
of issue of some kind

414
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,079
you think they wouldn't i mean people

415
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,440
would want to eat pizza every night they

416
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,720
would want to eat pizza a few times a

417
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
week they would want pizza on their

418
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,440
weekends

419
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,399
they would want they would want all

420
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,639
their different

421
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,480
foods their mac and cheese all these

422
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,880
other things that's what they want to do

423
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,200
but people are getting pushed into

424
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,279
eating healthier and healthier

425
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,040
because their symptoms are actually

426
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,079
driving them there

427
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,639
and then alternative medicine will tell

428
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,480
them well

429
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,079
gluten is causing your condition well

430
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,839
that's interesting because it didn't

431
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,320
cause your condition for the first 15

432
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,519
years

433
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,760
in your life and then you develop

434
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,600
symptoms years later it wasn't the

435
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,040
gluten that created

436
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,120
that symptom 20 years later it wasn't

437
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,200
it wasn't you know something else that

438
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,560
created that symptom 20 30 years of

439
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,120
years later

440
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,959
so what did it and it's these pathogens

441
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,040
i'm talking about in the whole bit

442
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,160
so you know if we got a lot to cover

443
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
we're going to talk about oxalates

444
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
oxalic acid we're going to talk about

445
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
like spinach

446
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,560
people are worried about spinach

447
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,079
cruciferous we're going to talk about

448
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,680
that the gorgogenic foods

449
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,120
going to talk about lectins we're going

450
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,480
to talk about histamines

451
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,240
you're going to want to hang on for this

452
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,600
ride because this is a big night

453
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,279
fructose intolerance we're going to

454
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,839
cover that too so if you're somebody

455
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,519
that

456
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,959
you want to know about the stuff and i'm

457
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,720
going to be answering questions as we go

458
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,720
along some watching the monitor too

459
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,240
right here with all the questions so

460
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,360
um okay uh minerva

461
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,519
is it true that eggs feed viruses yes

462
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,680
that's medical medium information that's

463
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,240
where that originates from and yes it's

464
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,079
true

465
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,120
because pathogens were were created

466
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,440
they were raised in eggs and eggs

467
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,160
feeding them in the labs over the last

468
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,120
80

469
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,079
90 years pathogens were used i mean

470
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,800
pathogens

471
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,279
were basically raised using eggs as a

472
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,040
food

473
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,639
so what happens is when we eat our eggs

474
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,079
you may not feel anything now but as

475
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,560
years go on your eggs are

476
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,519
feeding viruses so once again it's not

477
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,639
the egg's fault

478
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,160
eggs were an amazing survival food and a

479
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,480
tasty one at that

480
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,000
but what happened is they ruined our

481
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
eggs the industries ruined our eggs and

482
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,120
i talk about that a lot all the time and

483
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,839
i talk about that and cleanse the heal

484
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,839
if you guys

485
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,199
get a copy of this you'll learn so much

486
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,279
it's unbelievable really

487
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,399
uh pamela says that's me plant-based

488
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,680
because of symptoms

489
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,120
pamela exactly and because you really

490
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,639
wouldn't be plant-based right

491
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,160
you wouldn't be if it wasn't for the

492
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,440
symptoms pushing you into it

493
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,000
same thing with a lot of people eating

494
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,920
like clean paleo and no carbs or

495
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,079
no doughnuts no cakes no cookies you

496
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,440
know like what no bagels with cream

497
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,360
cheese or whatever it's like

498
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
okay well we would stop those bagels and

499
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,760
cream cheese we would stop bagels and

500
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,639
butter

501
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,839
we would really stop that i mean no

502
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,279
people wouldn't want to stop their

503
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,120
bagels and butter and all that kind of

504
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,880
stuff and all that you know we do we

505
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
we're being squeezed and pushed into it

506
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,680
so i'm glad you i'm totally glad you

507
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,920
understand and

508
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,120
um so i'm going to cover look there's so

509
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,040
much to cover i'm going to talk about

510
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,040
oxalates i saw an oxalate question zip

511
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,680
through and zip up right there

512
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,600
and i'm going to talk about that too so

513
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,440
so much information i'm so glad you guys

514
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,519
are here hang on for this ride because

515
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,199
there's so much to cover

516
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,959
and a lot of info you know

517
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,560
when it comes to information about food

518
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,800
there's so much misinformation out there

519
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
and that's where we get stuck that's

520
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
where the chase happens that's where the

521
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,839
guessing games happen

522
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,600
that's where it's like we're totally

523
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,519
guessing and we're looking around at

524
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,959
every corner for a new thing or a quick

525
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,959
fix and we're like

526
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,320
what's what's the histamine foods what

527
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,160
are the histamine foods

528
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,920
what are the oxalate foods what are the

529
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,920
nightshades what are the

530
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,120
lectins what are the oxalates

531
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,800
so much information okay um so when it

532
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,639
comes when it comes to information about

533
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,399
food there's so much misinformation out

534
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,880
there we can call it smog

535
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,600
we can call it you know uh just

536
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,720
basically

537
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,160
noise we can call it noise too but

538
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,120
there's there's um okay so cheryl hey

539
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,320
cheryl

540
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,519
exactly you did this i was vegan for

541
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,839
four years

542
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,839
before medical medium and doing it all

543
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,040
wrong because really what is medical

544
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,920
medium information sharing

545
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,600
medical medium information is not about

546
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,759
a diet belief system

547
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,519
and that's the confusion out there i

548
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,120
noticed that some of the naysayers they

549
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,839
just want to package it up like oh he's

550
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,440
just a

551
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,440
there's plant-based information better

552
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,079
than his because he's a bad plant-based

553
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,360
what are you talking about like medical

554
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,199
medium information

555
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,120
welcomes all diets all diet systems

556
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,800
in whatever diet belief systems because

557
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,160
it's not about

558
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,399
it's about if you're going to be

559
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,799
plant-based be plant-based

560
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,600

this too

613
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,840
so you know it's funny that the most

614
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,960
vocal people

615
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,760
that are on social media okay

616
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,960
are the people that feel the least sick

617
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,520
where it's as far as

618
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,080
vocal in the point where they're vocal

619
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,120
and they just want to cause like

620
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,000
shouting matches right like you know you

621
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,000
know the animal

622
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,520
protein people they're killing animals

623
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
the animal protein people are saying to

624
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,200
the vegans you're starving your kids

625
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,799
you're just feeding them lettuce and you

626
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,320
know it's terrible what's happening out

627
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,280
there you know meanwhile they don't know

628
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,960
what's going on with

629
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,559
why you have your tingles and numbness

630
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,520
your aches and pains your

631
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,160
your itchy skin your hives your chronic

632
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
acne

633
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,080
they just don't know what's causing all

634
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,080
this everybody plays these guessing

635
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,480
games with foods and it's locking us

636
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,080
down

637
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,480
to a total brainwashing situation

638
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,640
where now we're like where do i run from

639
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,679
now and and how it works so

640
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,400
um so the whole the whole point is here

641
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,360
is that

642
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,600
when you're dealing with multiple

643
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,160
sclerosis or eczema psoriasis acne lyme

644
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,880
disease endometriosis pcos

645
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,400
you know fibroids depression crippling

646
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,360
anxiety

647
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
crippling anxiety it's critical to know

648
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,400
why you're sick

649
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,840
and why you have a symptom and why we

650
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,320
have a condition

651
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,280
so okay you guys when we get our first

652
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,919
symptom

653
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,200
we don't like how it feels right you

654
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,320
don't like how it feels when you get

655
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,960
your first symptom

656
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,080
so naturally we want an answer to why we

657
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,080
have a symptom

658
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,120
like you want an answer like i want to

659
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,880
answer now why i'm

660
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,559
got this or i want to answer to why i

661
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,559
have that you want an answer

662
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,080
to why you have a symptom right both

663
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,039
conventional and altered medicine they

664
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,440
don't have the answers to why we're sick

665
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,960
but yet they still have help they still

666
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,320
can help they still can do all kinds of

667
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,679
great testing they still have

668
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,200
they still have band-aids they still

669
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,760
have all kinds of stuff and of course we

670
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
have

671
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,840
you know we have you know really really

672
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,039
powerful like neurosurgery surgery we

673
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
have all kinds of different things we

674
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,120
have great surgeons we have great

675
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
medical

676
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,480
you know science research in other areas

677
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,919
but when it comes down to autoimmune and

678
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,360
chronic illness and all these different

679
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
symptoms and conditions

680
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,000
we got the bloating and we got the

681
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,559
gastroparesis and the digestive problems

682
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,400
and we got constipation you know without

683
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,320
knowing why and we have crohn's we have

684
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,520
colitis we have ibs

685
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,039
we have all these conditions that

686
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,559
science research doesn't know about we

687
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,240
have eczema psoriasis vitiligo

688
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,159
scleroderma rosacea and science

689
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,080
researchers know about any of these

690
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,440
and so when we're uncomfortable and with

691
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,520
these migraines and

692
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,760
ocular migraines and floaters in the

693
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,600
eyes and we don't have answers

694
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,960
we we get to a point when we're looking

695
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,880
for answers

696
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,039
auto you know alternative science

697
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,720
alternative uh alternative medicine will

698
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,120
try to say well your foods are

699
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,159
triggering it they're triggering your

700
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,440
body

701
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,760
harming itself that's not correct that

702
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,799
is

703
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,520
incorrect information

704
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,520
incorrect information that's why someone

705
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,440
could be 60 years old eating what they

706
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,960
want all the gluten they want

707
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,200
and they are not getting all these

708
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,919
symptoms a 25 year old is getting when

709
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,880
she's getting

710
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,240
crippling anxiety horrible depression

711
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,400
itchy skin

712
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,840
hives everywhere you know all these

713
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,840
different things and

714
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,880
and then the 60 year old isn't getting

715
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,919
any of that

716
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,159
so basically what it is is people

717
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,360
they don't like being sick so it makes a

718
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,120
person miserable

719
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,799
so when you're in your 20s or in your

720
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,280
you know 30s whatever it is

721
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:01,600
you get trained that maybe it's oxalates

722
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
maybe it's lectins what foods are you

723
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,799
choosing

724
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,159
you start you you know you get trained

725
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,720
to run away

726
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,080
from the symptom you're experiencing to

727
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,799
try to find a quick

728
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,159
fix in some kind of category maybe it's

729
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,640
night shades

730
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,360
maybe it's the potato maybe it's

731
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,520
something else

732
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,480
and it can put us in a corner like trap

733
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,480
us like a rat

734
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,960
and stick us in the corner you guys

735
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,960
right and it and then it's no fruits

736
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,400
and you can't have a certain vegetable

737
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,760
then you can't have cruciferous you

738
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,480

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,760
you can't have kale

748
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,840
you can't have um lettuce for some

749
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,600
reason and so we're told you were even

750
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,919
told that herbs are problems

751
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,280
like herbs like chamomile it's part of

752
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,799
the ragweed family

753
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,480
so if you're you know a drag weed then

754
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,200
it's cameo is bad too and you get

755
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,840
squeezed

756
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,600
everywhere you go and that's a big

757
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,360
problem and when you get squeezed

758
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,039
and you get brain screwed and you get

759
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,760
squeezed and brain screwed

760
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,039
you're in less fruits no potatoes no

761
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,080
herbs no vegetables

762
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,720
no leafy greens no grains of any kind

763
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,080
no beans and then you can even get

764
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
squeezed as far and i've seen this

765
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,799
happen to

766
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,480
some people not a lot of people but you

767
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,799
get squeezed this far

768
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,960
down the rabbit hole into the carnivore

769
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,520
diet so now we're in just the carnivore

770
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,919
diet

771
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,440
okay where it's just meat and only meat

772
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,440
and only meat and only meat

773
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,120
and that carnivore diet can go with meat

774
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,400
turkey and chicken

775
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,320
and bacon or pork

776
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,520
but then it could minimize or it can go

777
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,200
to lamb and meat

778
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,880
and chicken and then all of a sudden you

779
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,559
lose your chicken and then because

780
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,240
you're just squeezing down you're like

781
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,039
confused as to your why you have

782
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,200
symptoms

783
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,799
and it's such it's such a brain problem

784
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,360
it's like it's not a brain problem it's

785
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,360
such

786
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,720
it's such a confusion and then you're

787
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,640
getting squeezed down

788
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,400
because the more you squeeze down and

789
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,440
you're not touching a fruit a vegetable

790
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,520
a leafy green

791
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,120
and because of somebody's theories or

792
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,799
because of how you're feeling

793
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,159
because you're feeling symptoms and you

794
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,760
don't know why you don't know what's

795
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,279
triggering it is something triggering it

796
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,120
is something activating it

797
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,320
and you get squeezed down right down to

798
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,960
the carnivore

799
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,360
and then things are coming down because

800
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,799
you're

801
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,720
minimizing it you're going so mono foods

802
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,080
and the reason why some people can do

803
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
this and they can go carnivore where

804
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,320
they're only on

805
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,720
meat only red meat is because

806
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,640
red meat won't feed the bugs and i

807
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,480
talked about this that's why people say

808
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,080
oh he's a plant-based guy only no i'm

809
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,919
not always

810
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,400
he's he's a whatever animal protein guy

811
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,600
no i'm not i'm neither of anything i'm

812
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,159
just about the answers

813
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,679
so you can get better so here's what it

814
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,320
is like the carnivore people get

815
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:50,880
squeezed right down to just meat

816
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,799
itself and by default and by accident

817
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,880
they're start they're feeling better for

818
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,559
the moment and they're feeling better

819
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,880
for the moment you guys

820
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,080
because they're not feeding the bugs

821
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,520
that are creating

822
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,200
all their symptoms that are creating

823
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,080
their fatigue their migraines their

824
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,520
aches and pains

825
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,440
their floaters in the eyes their tingles

826
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,760
are numbness their dizziness they're not

827
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,720
feeding the bugs and they're holding

828
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,600
back

829
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,200
leafy greens and fruits or certain

830
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,960
fruits and certain leafy greens and

831
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,840
vegetables and herbs

832
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,960
that would kill the bugs and guess what

833
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,679
when you kill the

834
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,919
bugs you feel them sometimes you feel

835
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,600
similar symptoms to what your symptoms

836
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,760
are you feel

837
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,159
the same symptoms to what your symptoms

838
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,159
are when you're killing the bugs

839
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,400
you know and this is when you're off

840
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,640
processed foods too and all this stuff

841
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:46,159
and what happens is people don't realize

842
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,000
that the reactions they're having

843
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,799
at any given time while they're eating

844
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,520
healthy foods or healthier foods

845
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,080
is because they're cleaning out years of

846
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,120
bug

847
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,679
toxins that are stored in their liver

848
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,039
they're cleaning out years of bug toxins

849
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,080
that are stored

850
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:07,120
inside inside their liver

851
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,000
you know inside inside their body inside

852
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,039
their spleen

853
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,880
inside their organs and that's what's

854
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,960
happening unless they're feeding

855
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,559
the bugs with foods that actually feed

856
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,039
the bugs and that's what i talk about

857
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,559
like in

858
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,400
cleanse the heel i talk about that's

859
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,600
what the information is know what foods

860
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,240
do feed things

861
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,679
tammy ross i thought the extra fruit

862
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,679
would make me gain weight

863
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,039
i'm losing weight just fine on your

864
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,360
program thank you so much

865
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,320
incredible tammy everybody gets thrown

866
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,520
into fruit fear

867
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,360
it's one of the things that they get

868
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,279
thrown into it's fruit fear

869
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,520
but it's it's theories about fruit

870
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,320
that create fruit fruit fear it's

871
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,080
theories

872
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,600
about all these things but what happens

873
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,720
tammy is fruit

874
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,679
helps to kill off your pathogens it

875
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,000
helps to get

876
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,960
rid of the pathogens it helps to clean

877
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,320
and cleanse

878
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,480
the liver it cleans up these things the

879
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,720
pathogen the bug toxins and you

880
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
end up in a better place when you're

881
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,840
doing the right stuff but what can

882
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,520
happen is so many people

883
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,520
they're so filled with all kinds of bugs

884
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,039
and toxins that the minute you start

885
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,880
cleaning that up a little bit

886
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,480
the minute you start bringing in those

887
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,000
frozen wild blueberries

888
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,679
and you start bringing in those bananas

889
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,679
you start bringing in that and that

890
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,360
leafy greens and more lettuce and you

891
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,039
start bringing in that cilantro and that

892
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,159
mosh and that kale or whatever it is

893
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,760
that spinach

894
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,279
and you start bringing all that in

895
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,600
you're going to be sweeping stuff

896
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,399
out of the intestinal tract lining

897
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,120
people have

898
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,000
rancid fats and rancid proteins for

899
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,159
years

900
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,840
sitting on the inside of the linings of

901
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,960
their intestinal tract

902
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,559
and in that in that mess that's inside

903
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,159
the lining of the intestinal tract it's

904
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,320
been there for years okay

905
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,520
there's a lot of different kinds of bugs

906
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,200
and it's sitting in there

907
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,039
and the minute you start you and it

908
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,880
gives you symptoms all these things give

909
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,640
you symptoms but then you start to clean

910
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,279
up and you start to heal and push that

911
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,279
stuff out

912
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,120
you start to wash all that stuff out of

913
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,440
you with the celery juice

914
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,480
you start to push all that stuff out of

915
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,240
you to get it out of your system and and

916
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,840
when you do that you might feel similar

917
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,039
symptoms the same symptom a little bit

918
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,640
you're like wait a minute

919
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,399
that was the dizziness i had the other

920
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,799
day i have it today is it because i just

921
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,279
had

922
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,080
a leafy green and you know we end up

923
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,120
running from

924
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,440
foods to avoid ex

925
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,120
experiencing something that might be

926
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,440
slightly uncomfortable

927
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,799
instead of solving the problem you see

928
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,080
how important this is

929
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,399
you know so it's a temporary band-aid

930
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,000
to keep on minimizing foods minimizing

931
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,200
foods minimizing foods because medical

932
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,159
medium information brought all these

933
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,559
foods back

934
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,320
this was going on for years stay away

935
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,919
from fruit stay away from oxalates

936
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,200
stay away from this stay away from that

937
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,640
stay away from night shades medical

938
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,120
medium information you guys

939
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,000
brought back nightshades brought back

940
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,399
the fruits

941
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,080
brought back the leafy greens brought

942
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,600
back all this stuff nobody even ate

943
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,640
leafy greens brought all this

944
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,720
in so you can have all these choices to

945
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,720
plug into your animal protein diet or

946
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,360
your plant-based diet

947
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,120
that's the difference and no one else is

948
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,320
doing that and that's the problem so you

949
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,919
got these food wars

950
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,600
everybody just takes a side of the aisle

951
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,120
nobody knows why anybody's sick

952
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,720
nobody knows why people are struggling

953
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,000
with a symptom condition and they're all

954
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,640
throwing pot shots

955
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,159
and theories and and and on those

956
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,279
theories it's back to fructose

957
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,799
intolerance

958
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,120
oxalates oxalic acid

959
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,720
salicylic acid i mean you can go on

960
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,240
there's so many of them i'm probably not

961
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,559
even mentioning right now

962
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,240
so that's how it works so ironically all

963
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
diet belief systems end up like

964
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,559
band-aids too

965
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,480
unless you know what to really avoid

966
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,480
because you know what's wrong

967
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,960
i've said this over and over again you

968
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,720
have to know what's causing your symptom

969
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,039
or you're just doing a band-aid all the

970
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,840
time you go plant-based that's not an

971
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,360
answer

972
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,279
unless you know what's causing your

973
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,799
symptom if you know what's causing your

974
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,559
symptom

975
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,000
then you can actually live on your

976
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,960
plant-based diet get

977
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
symptom-free and heal and if you if you

978
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,960
know your symptom

979
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,960
on an animal-based diet of any kind you

980
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,520
once you learn your scent with your

981
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,600
symptoms

982
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,840
causing your symptom you can work on

983
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,240
healing and then you can work with that

984
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,559
it's

985
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
using the right tools but here's what's

986
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,279
happening

987
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,120
everybody's picking the diet belief

988
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,080
system nobody knows why anybody's sick

989
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,240
out there

990
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,559
i mean come on and then the theories

991
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,039
start throwing around everywhere

992
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,320
but as the carnivore diet goes you get

993
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,559
so squeezed down

994
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,399
and you eliminate every single thing

995
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,840
possible because you're feeling an

996
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,640
uncomfortable experience

997
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,080
from eating a piece of fruit possibly or

998
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,320
eating a leafy green

999
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,320
because it's actually cleaning up the

1000
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,679
very crap in your system that's giving

1001
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,120
you the symptoms to begin with

1002
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,360
but what you're doing is you're doing a

1003
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,120
temporary band-aid by pushing all that

1004
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,960
stuff away

1005
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,559
so that you don't feel it and you get

1006
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,720
pushed and squeezed into a corner

1007
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,480
and now you're just eating meat alone

1008
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,720
but in the end that's just a temporary

1009
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,760
band-aid you have to remember that

1010
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,039
and and you know and and remember you

1011
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,679
had these symptoms

1012
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,320
to begin with so these symptoms begin

1013
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,799
with oh

1014
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,600
end up coming back one way or another

1015
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,120
and

1016
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,960
one way or another they'll find their

1017
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,559
way there temporarily the meat that

1018
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,640
you're just stuck on only mono eating

1019
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,799
won't feed the bugs in the moment

1020
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,799
but what happens over time you'll lead

1021
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,600
to deficiencies your immune system drops

1022
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,399
down because

1023
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,679
there's not enough stuff in meat by

1024
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,919
itself

1025
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,720
to keep you going there's just not

1026
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,640
enough and

1027
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,240
and i'm a pro meat guy i'm a pro

1028
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,840
plant-based guy there's not enough

1029
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,000
antioxidants to stop you from

1030
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,760
aging and just meet by itself so you can

1031
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,799
do it temporarily the carnivore thing

1032
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,399
temporarily

1033
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,399
but you'll end up getting deficient

1034
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,960
you'll end up you know weighing too much

1035
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,559
down on the liver the kidneys the heart

1036
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,519
because too much protein and fat

1037
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,919
constantly

1038
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,200
and it's not a balanced diet like

1039
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,399
everybody's always saying or you want a

1040
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,240
balanced diet or you want a balanced

1041
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,440
diet oh yeah this isn't a balanced diet

1042
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,559
but i get it i get it

1043
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,080
we get scared and we get pushed

1044
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,240
into elimination you might be like

1045
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,200
anthony i'm not on a carnivore diet what

1046
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,399
are you talking about

1047
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,760
well wait a minute are you on a

1048
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,320
plant-based diet of all kinds of

1049
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,679
different

1050
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
things well you must be avoiding

1051
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,600
something you already squeezed yourself

1052
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,120
back

1053
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,320
you had to get rid of gluten you're on

1054
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,760
plant-based diet you had to get rid of

1055
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,760
some of the grains probably

1056
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,200
maybe you're on a keto animal protein

1057
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,799
diet you got rid of something that

1058
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,320
you're not eating anymore right

1059
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,840
you clean up something no processed

1060
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,399
foods you're getting squeezed a little

1061
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,399
bit

1062
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,559
and a little bit but you got to learn

1063
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,559
what's causing you the problems which

1064
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,679
got you there in the first place to even

1065
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,679
want to eat right

1066
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,519
to even want to eat good to even want to

1067
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,320
care you have to know what's causing

1068
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,640
that

1069
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,000
so you can even get to that point so so

1070
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,159
let's go let's keep on talking because

1071
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,200
we've got a lot to cover

1072
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,760
you want to be free of symptoms and

1073
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,799
conditions that are making you

1074
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,799
suffer and you know it's so

1075
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,039
important to know and and so anyway

1076
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,679
let's let's keep on moving on

1077
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,279
for sure look everybody would love to

1078
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,559
have their buffalo chicken wings

1079
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,840
everybody would love to have their ice

1080
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,720
cream everybody would love to have their

1081
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,399
bread and butter

1082
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,760
their donuts everybody would love to

1083
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,880

1084
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,399

you know everybody would love that but

1088
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,720
reason why we get squeezed out of that

1089
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,080
because we got symptoms and we don't

1090
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,000
know what's causing them if you want to

1091
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,760

1119
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,399
millions of books around the world

1120
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,480
because of grassroots healing

1121
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,800
not because of pr and marketing nothing

1122
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,440
like that no money behind it

1123
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,159
and people healing and telling somebody

1124
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,200
else about

1125
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,599
these books okay and healing and it has

1126
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,639
nothing to do with concerns about

1127
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,960
lectins

1128
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,000
interesting you know it's helped

1129
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,560
countless

1130
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,919
lives before even the publications of

1131
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,320
these books because i worked with

1132
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,359
thousands of people before these books

1133
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,480
and i witnessed them heal before anybody

1134
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,040
knew of the word lectin okay very

1135
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,760
important

1136
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,839
but for some reason some reason the

1137
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,159
lectin

1138
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,280
leaders didn't know they missed that

1139
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,440
memo

1140
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,040
they missed the memo that countless

1141
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,679
people have healed from medical medium

1142
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,240
books

1143
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,200
tens of thousands of stories you can see

1144
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,880
out there

1145
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,400
thousands of people have seen over the

1146
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,160
years and

1147
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,680
the reports coming back of how many

1148
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,240
people are healing

1149
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,440
hmm without anything to do with lectins

1150
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,520
interesting right

1151
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,480
but electing leaders of lectin

1152
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,560
theory-based

1153
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,480
leaders seem to just miss that memo

1154
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,520
there because they think everything's a

1155
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,320
lectin problem

1156
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,160
oh that's interesting it's not you know

1157
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,920
lectins is one of those things that's so

1158
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,200
silly because lectins aren't responsible

1159
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,160
for digestive issues they're not

1160
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,920
responsible for

1161
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,720
digestion problems they're not

1162
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,880
responsible because it's not lectins

1163
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,160
that cause a problem it's not lectins

1164
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,839
and fruits it's not lectins and

1165
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,040
vegetables it's not lectins

1166
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,200
and all this stuff it's one of the

1167
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,440
stupider theories it's actually one of

1168
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,359
the

1169
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,599
it's actually one of the stupidest

1170
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,839
theories of all the theories

1171
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,079
that's the irony to it and i don't care

1172
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,520
who i get upset or not or what not it's

1173
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,200
tell you guys the truth

1174
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,880
or don't tell you the truth what is it

1175
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,680
gonna be you know what i mean that's why

1176
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,359
i've always

1177
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,000
always always been like i'll say it like

1178
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,599
it is and you know and it's it's funny

1179
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,680
on another note anything i've done in

1180
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,960
media or anything else they they edit

1181
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,200
every single thing

1182
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,040
i say practically because i say it like

1183
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,200
it is like this all the time

1184
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,280
but the bottom line is it's about the

1185
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,480
pathogens it's about certain toxins

1186
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,000
that's why we're sick

1187
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,800
it's not about the lectins critical

1188
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
to know and that's these theories are

1189
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,960
ridiculous and it'll

1190
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,079
that will squeeze you you'll get lectin

1191
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,960
screwed

1192
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,599
okay and then that will it will squeeze

1193
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,400
you

1194
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,240
and squeeze you off and then you're now

1195
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,400
now you're in that mindset

1196
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,079
it's unbelievable what can happen all

1197
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
right so let's go into oxalates a little

1198
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,200
bit

1199
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,200
okay so

1216
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,320

1217
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,480
up already

1218
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,000

incredible

1220
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,320
and that's so good to know let's talk

1221
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,079
about oxalates a little bit um

1222
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,839
had amazing results i missed that

1223
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,000
question too just the quest

1224
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,240
the questions are cranking up had

1225
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,520
amazing results on two weeks potato mono

1226
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,960
eating cleanse

1227
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,480
so joanna the mono eating cleanses

1228
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,440
incredible guess what if you got scared

1229
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,200
off about nightshades which is

1230
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,000
ridiculous that's actually a theory

1231
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,760
that's not

1232
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,160
accurate on any level with no evidence

1233
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,320
behind it if you ever get scared off

1234
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,079
about nightshades like potato being

1235
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,400
afraid of a potato

1236
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,200
you lose your chance to heal and that's

1237
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,280
what happens

1238
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,359
that's what i'm talking about the belief

1239
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,079
systems not just the diet belief systems

1240
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,040
but the bad

1241
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,720
theories they stop people from healing

1242
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,680
and that's the difference between the mm

1243
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,720
information and so i'm so proud of you

1244
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,079
i'm so proud of you

1245
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,079
um you you know with celery juice

1246
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,160
and and different in a different mono

1247
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,760
cleanse anybody can choose too they can

1248
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,359
choose a different model cleanses and

1249
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,200
the celery juice with it the amount

1250
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,640
you can just move forward so i'm proud

1251
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,560
of you proud of you

1252
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,839
so there's oxalates in everything let's

1253
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,680
talk about oxalates

1254
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,520
everybody's like spinach high in

1255
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,040
oxalates something else

1256
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:36,480
high in oxalates oxalates oxalates and

1257
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,200
you'll hear this okay another another

1258
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,680
like mental trick another mental trick

1259
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,240
from

1260
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,119
from the industries and alternative

1261
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,720
industry

1262
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,400
not knowing what's causing your symptom

1263
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,160
or condition it's so

1264
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,240
sad okay so let's go into this a little

1265
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,200
bit first of all

1266
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,520
oxalates are in everything every single

1267
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,359
thing

1268
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,720
they're in meat how come nobody's

1269
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,400
complaining about that

1270
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,960
how come nobody's talking about oxalates

1271
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,079
and meat right

1272
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,760
they're always picking on spinach

1273
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,000
they're always picking on a fruit a

1274
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,560
berry they're always picking on an

1275
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,960
apple they're always picking on a plum

1276
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,400
um they're always picking on a pear

1277
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,839
let's see what else they pick on oh

1278
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,200
vegetables pick on all of all the

1279
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,000
vegetables oxalates and all the

1280
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,119
vegetables

1281
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,040
but there's oxalate in meat cheese eggs

1282
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,599
dairy products there's oxalates in

1283
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,560
butter there's oxalates in every human

1284
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,760
being

1285
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,480
we're loaded with oxalates animals we

1286
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,079
eat

1287
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,680
are loaded with oxalates okay

1288
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,200
oxalates are in everything everywhere

1289
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,000
talk about a total total trick

1290
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,760
played on everybody it's unbelievable

1291
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,280
well wait a minute wait a minute i react

1292
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,839
to an oxalate how do you really know

1293
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,320
you're

1294
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,079
ever reacting to an oxalate the only way

1295
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,040
you could ever know or ever find out

1296
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,880
is if they separate the oxalate and make

1297
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,359
a pill out of it

1298
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,480
filled with oxalates and they give you

1299
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,760
that pill

1300
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,200
that's loaded with oxalates okay

1301
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,000
and they and you just or you drink a a

1302
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,040
glass of oxalates it's the only way

1303
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,480
you'll ever know

1304
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,319
so somebody be like well i react to

1305
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,079
oxalates you know i had

1306
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,680
this apple where i had this wait a

1307
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,119
minute how do you know you're not

1308
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,160
reacting from the food you ate the night

1309
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,560
before

1310
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,319
that wasn't that wasn't an apple how do

1311
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,520
you know you're not reacting to

1312
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,520
the body cleaning out some toxins bug

1313
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,280
toxins and toxins of different kinds

1314
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,119
how do you know you're not reacting to

1315
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,319
that how do you know you're not reacting

1316
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,119
to something else like

1317
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,599
what about plug-in air fresheners what

1318
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,960
about

1319
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,119
all kinds of other things that are

1320
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,960
happening what about scented candles

1321
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,480
what about somebody's cologne i've seen

1322
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,760
somebody's cologne

1323
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,839
make somebody sensitive sick in an hour

1324
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,200
where they're literally just on a couch

1325
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,200
with a splitting migraine because they

1326
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,520
were breathing in somebody's cologne

1327
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,440
you know maybe you're just reacting to

1328
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,400
the bug poisons that were flushing out

1329
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,160
of your liver

1330
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,160
when you eat a cleansing food for the

1331
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,680
first time in a long time

1332
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,760
you know you don't know and so what

1333
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,880
happens is the ultimate trick the ox

1334
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,720
lake game

1335
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,800
is one of the ultimate tricks of all

1336
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,280
time and it really

1337
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,880
just sucks it does you know you and and

1338
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,079
if you have symptoms already

1339
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,839
they're going to come and go no matter

1340
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,640
what until you actually go to the root

1341
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,000
cause

1342
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,760
so until you actually go to the root

1343
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,720
cause of your symptoms and conditions

1344
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,520
and you know what's causing them can you

1345
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,680
actually

1346
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,119
like even understand and that's the

1347
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,280
whole thing that's really hard for

1348
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,079
people look

1349
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,920
it's a guessing game saga over and over

1350
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,280
and oxalates are involved in that and

1351
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,960
let me tell you something interesting

1352
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,079
there's antioxidants in all fruits and

1353
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,400
vegetables

1354
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,520
that cancel out oxalates that's another

1355
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,480
thing too

1356
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,079
so what about that whole thing um lisa

1357
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,800
said maybe you're allergic to celery

1358
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,200
question mark

1359
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,920
all our bodies are different uh thus

1360
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,000
some

1361
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,520
allergic to one food herb item and

1362
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,839
others not just a thought

1363
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,640
well lisa is that how it works it's a

1364
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,480
good question though

1365
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,760
i mean no i'm really glad you brought

1366
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,800
that up it

1367
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,920
everybody is different 100 so different

1368
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,280
it's unbelievable

1369
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,480
someone else has more mercury in their

1370
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,599
brain causing their anxiety than

1371
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,040
somebody else does

1372
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,480
somebody else has more aluminum in their

1373
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,000
body causing their vitiligo than

1374
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,920
somebody else does

1375
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,960
somebody else has way more copper inside

1376
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,720
their liver that's causing their

1377
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,280
excellent psoriasis

1378
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,640
than than somebody else does somebody

1379
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,880
has more streptococcus

1380
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,079
causing their acne to keep on blowing up

1381
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,839
left and right

1382
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,760
so when they have a little bit of gluten

1383
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,599
their streptococcus feeds off the gluten

1384
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,880
and their acne is just exploding

1385
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,800
somebody else might have two different

1386
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,079
types of streptococcus somebody might

1387
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,520
have two varieties of epstein-barr

1388
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,319
causing chronic fatigue syndrome

1389
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,440
and something else and lupus somebody

1390
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,200
might have

1391
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,480
more metals on one side of the brain

1392
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,839
more metals on the other side of the

1393
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,400
brain less metals on the other side of

1394
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,680
the brain

1395
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,760
somebody might have shingles causing

1396
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,240
trigeminal neuralgia somebody might have

1397
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,839
epstein-barr causing their glaucoma

1398
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,599
and this is why we're all different

1399
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,640
every last bit of us

1400
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,400
and we're different with different

1401
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,000
varieties of bugs different mutations

1402
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,560
different strains how many different

1403
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,400
kinds

1404
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,000
different relationships different places

1405
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,280
we get them from public bathrooms

1406
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,760
different places we get from different

1407
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,200
restaurants everybody's different

1408
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,319
people have more battles in them people

1409
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,280
have more bugs in them people have

1410
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,200
different toxins

1411
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,800
i know somebody who's drenched in

1412
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,160
gasoline

1413
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,680
and they're going to be different from

1414
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,359
here on out because they were drenched

1415
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,800
in gasoline than everybody else

1416
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,119
because they have gasoline inside their

1417
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,839
liver and inside their bodies and organ

1418
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,000
organs in their body and organs and they

1419
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,000
have gasoline all through them

1420
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,599
and everybody's different for all these

1421
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,200
reasons and then

1422
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,640
we're different from how our nervous

1423
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,079
system is with it all with how many

1424
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,480
neurotoxins everything else

1425
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,079
so dale said how do you put how do you

1426
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,599
how do you figure out your root

1427
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,720
cause well okay go to the library

1428
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,720
okay get the book out for free

00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,480
get the book out for free and start

1430
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,240
learning what the root causes are

1431
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,000
so dale start learning what they are you

1432
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,480
can figure it out get get the book out

1433
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,720
for free

1434
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,079
don't even buy the book it's 16.99 right

1435
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,119
now on amazon but you don't have to buy

1436
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,079
it you can get it for free at the

1437
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,800
labyrinth

1438
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,760
and and and definitely um so oxidate

1439
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,319
okay kidney stones okay julie a theory

1440
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,160
a theory oxalates are in every single

1441
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,920
cell in your body

1442
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:17,520
they're in every single organ okay

1443
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,560
so so oxalates are everywhere we

1444
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:25,440
are an oxalate

1445
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:29,280
it's it's it's we are we are an oxalate

1446
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,839
okay kidney stones that's from the liver

1447
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,920
the liver getting stagnant and sluggish

1448
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,160
and that's from the intestinal tract

1449
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,960
getting getting caked on putrified

1450
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,720
proteins

1451
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,119
lining up the lines of the intestinal

1452
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,720
tract rancid fats lining up the linings

1453
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,040
of the intestinal tract all

1454
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,720
all running through okay it's from a

1455
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,400
burden of protein

1456
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:53,040
too over protein we are the society

1457
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,720
or the or the human race just kills

1458
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,640
itself with protein

1459
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
if you're thinking hey sounds like he's

1460
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,240
plant-based

1461
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,839
no plant-based people will kill

1462
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,920
themselves the protein

1463
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,839
they'll tank the nuts tank the seeds

1464
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,960
they'll tank the protein powders and the

1465
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,640
protein shakes

1466
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,480
they'll kill themselves of protein too

1467
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,920
and they'll create kidney stones

1468
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,079

where we end up with okay let's talk

1483
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,280
about fructose intolerance

1484
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,359
that's a whole other thing too let's go

1485
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,240
there first of all

1486
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,680
who ate that much fruit i know going

1487
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,920
through the years every single person i

1488
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,599
talked to that came to me who was sick

1489
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,680
every person i've ever talked to every

1490
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,560
person a doctor called me up and wanted

1491
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,880
to ask about wasn't eating fruit

1492
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,040
ever thousands of doctors have contacted

1493
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,800
me over the years and still do

1494
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,680
and they want advice about their

1495
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,240
patients so i spend a lot of time you

1496
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,480
guys

1497
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,359
talking to doctors every day that's what

1498
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,200
i do now

1499
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,640
in between writing the books in between

1500
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,319
trying to do all these this free

1501
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,240
information i'm dumping out on you just

1502
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,800
to free information all the time

1503
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,160
and i talk to doctors all the time every

1504
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,400
single day

1505
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,160
and they'll ask me about patience and

1506
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,000
you know and they'll say they'll say

1507
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,760
you know and what happens is they're not

1508
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,520
eating fruit

1509
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,040
and but they're sick and they come in

1510
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,079
sick who eats that much fruit

1511
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,240
so the fructose intolerance

1512
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,200
the the fructose intolerance thing is

1513
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,319
just really

1514
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,839
a whole it's a mistake all on its own

1515
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,079
in a lot of ways and i'll talk into a

1516
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,599
little bit let's talk about it first of

1517
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,520
all one of the reasons why people get

1518
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,000
the fructose intolerance tag is because

1519
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,920
they have

1520
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,319
insulin resistance but they have insulin

1521
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,160
resistance on all sugar

1522
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,240
they get insulin resistance on cane

1523
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,079
sugar insulin resistance on

1524
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:11,280
maple syrup insulin resistance on um

1525
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,880
starchy vegetables insulin resistance on

1526
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,520
raw honey or honey sugar cubes anything

1527
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,240
they have insulin resistance you know

1528
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,079
meanwhile

1529
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,359
they're not going to say that they're

1530
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,920
cane sugar

1531
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,400
intolerant they're not going to say

1532
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,640
they're

1533
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,640
you don't hear that too often cane sugar

1534
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,520
intolerant they're not maple syrup

1535
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,559
intolerant

1536
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,760
you don't hear that right they're not

1537
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,359
honey intolerant right

1538
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,960
so you don't hear that that they're not

1539
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,559
honey intolerant okay

1540
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,960
but they'll be picked on the fruit will

1541
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:46,760
be picked on because the makers

1542
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,839
of the fructose intolerance movement was

1543
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,520
anti-fruit haters

1544
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:55,760
upon fruit see where the bias comes in

1545
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,280
hmm that's where the bias comes in

1546
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,040
interesting meanwhile

1547
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,720
are you talking about the bloop the two

1548
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,920
blueberries you got in a blueberry

1549
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,520
muffin years ago

1550
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,280
are you talking about the strawberries

1551
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,319
in a strawberry shortcake you had

1552
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,119
were you talking about the fruit pie you

1553
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,680
ate

1554
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,960
out of a package when you were 10 years

1555
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,240
old are you talking about the apple in

1556
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,839
your lunch box

1557
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,359
you talking about the banana you had

1558
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,319
every other day

1559
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:22,000
like you know what's going on here see

1560
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:25,920
and and you know it's the whole thing so

1561
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,720
elizabeth um i get breathing problems

1562
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,040
thick air when i eat too much sweet

1563
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,200
fruit or when i eat too much

1564
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,480
okay so when you eat too much this is

1565
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,000
not just a sweet fruit

1566
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,760
or when you eat too much with other

1567
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,240
foods too so elizabeth if you eat too

1568
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,680
much

1569
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,839
you end up having the breathing problems

1570
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,880
okay i've seen that so many times

1571
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:47,280
no intestinal problems always breathing

1572
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,599
what is that it's better now after

1573
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,000
cleansing and changing the diet

1574
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,839
in celery juice nine months now see it's

1575
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,200
better right and i'll talk about that a

1576
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,160
little bit okay

1577
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,200
and but still have to be careful with

1578
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,640
some fruit

1579
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,359
um or do i just go for it it's not the

1580
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,680
fruit

1581
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,480
that's the problem with that okay it's

1582
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,880
it's what happens

1583
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,680
fruit is very very water rich

1584
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,160
it's very water rich okay and a lot of

1585
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,079
people

1586
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,520
their stomach shrink and they eat small

1587
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,760
amounts of chicken they'll eat

1588
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,359
small amounts of a vegetable a chicken

1589
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,839
or something to eat small amounts of

1590
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,599
food

1591
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,520
and then when you eat fruit it's really

1592
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,240
water rich too that's the one thing too

1593
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:31,280
so when you have sensitive nerves

1594
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,040
sensitive nerves because originally

1595
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,359
you're dealing with pathogens and you're

1596
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,119
dealing with pathogen toxins and

1597
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,119
inflamed nerves so what i've

1598
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,319
seen with people and i talked to doctors

1599
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,920
and you can talk to your doctor about

1600
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,599
this too this information what i've

1601
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,160
talked to doctors about helping doctors

1602
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,119
with

1603
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,119
is that nerves the vagus nerve gets

1604
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,559
sensitive it gets inflamed because of

1605
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,240
neurotoxins because

1606
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:56,960
we end up having symptoms these symptoms

1607
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,400
are caused by pathogens pathogens such

1608
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,920
as viruses such as ebv

1609
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,520
and such and those kinds of viruses they

1610
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,400
release neurotoxins in the shingles

1611
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,319
virus and such

1612
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,359
and these neurotoxins inflame the vagus

1613
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,079
and phrenic nerve guess where those

1614
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,040
nerves go

1615
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,640
down your neck dump through the phrenic

1616
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,079
nerve vagus nerve right down to your

1617
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,880
stomach through your chest

1618
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,760
and so what happens is if you fill up

1619
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,200
with too much

1620
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,880
food you can get that can't breathe too

1621
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,359
easy get that tightness of the chest you

1622
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,559
can get that all that because the nerves

1623
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:29,040
feeling pressure on the nerves so yeah

1624
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,319
you got if you down a whole melon

1625
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,000
you're going to feel that pressure on

1626
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,359
those sensitive nerves but the reason

1627
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,640
why the sensitive nerves are getting

1628
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,920
better and you feel less pressure and

1629
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,559
less pressure and now you're doing so

1630
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,839
much better

1631
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,440
is because you've been cleaning up those

1632
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,240
neurotoxins you can talk to your doctor

1633
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,240
you know say hey

1634
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,319
tell your doctor about this information

1635
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,359
um but it's really

1636
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:48,960
um yeah so so incredible um

1637
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,880
so i'm really happy about this you know

1638
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,480
so you guys i'm happy about you guys

1639
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,920
being here so much information to talk

1640
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,720
about i'm happy about all the comments

1641
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,319
i'm seeing

1642
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,160
this is so great so let's talk about the

1643
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:01,760
fructose intolerance a little bit

1644
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:04,319
so hereditary fructose intolerance hfi

1645
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,079
okay hereditary fructose intolerance

1646
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,599
another theory

1647
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,240
another theory because they don't know

1648
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:12,240
what's causing symptoms or conditions

1649
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,440
so what happens is when alternative

1650
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,880
science and research doesn't know what

1651
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,920
causes your symptoms and conditions you

1652
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,200
get all these

1653
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,640
bias approaches that develop and these

1654
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,599
bias approaches that don't know why

1655
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,200
we're sick

1656
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,960
and so they'll say well maybe it's the

1657
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,079
aldolase b

1658
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,680
iso enzyme so maybe it's all the lace b

1659
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,839
is enzyme maybe that's it

1660
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,839
maybe people are missing that and that

1661
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,160
needs to be there for fructose funny

1662
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,200
what that doesn't need to be there for

1663
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,960
um

1664
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,119
maple syrup that doesn't need to be

1665
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,359
there for honey that doesn't need to

1666
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,040
first of all no one loses that even if

1667
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,079
someone's low on it they can eat all the

1668
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,640
fruit they want

1669
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,319
how about testing people with who are

1670
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,760
eating all the fruit they want or low at

1671
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,319
i've seen that accidentally happen did

1672
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,359
you know i

1673
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,559
saw i saw that alternative doctors even

1674
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,920
told me but they said hey

1675
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,040
alternative functional medicine doctors

1676
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,400
reach out to me and they said you know

1677
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,680
what i'm into this fructose intolerance

1678
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,960
thing anthony i know you're not

1679
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,960
but let me just tell you something

1680
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:09,280
interesting that happened and

1681
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:12,400
they said they said i i tested a patient

1682
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,319
for fructose intolerance okay so i was

1683
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,599
looking at their all the lace b

1684
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:20,000
to see if it was low and and the patient

1685
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,040
wasn't having any problems with fruit at

1686
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,119
all in fact

1687
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,480
they felt better eating fruit they did

1688
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,160
better when they eat fruit

1689
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,440
in fact they healed while eating fruit

1690
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,800
through the recommendations i gave the

1691
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,960
functional medicine doctor

1692
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,240
for their patients and then the

1693
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,520
functional medicine doctor said

1694
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:38,640
i decided to run in all the lace b

1695
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,920
test i saw enzyme tests to see if it was

1696
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,480
low

1697
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,079
and it was low but how come they were

1698
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,119
able to eat fruit perfectly fine and it

1699
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,280
got them better

1700
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,119
so because all the latest be iceland's

1701
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,240
on has nothing to do with anything

1702
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,760
there's nothing to do with someone

1703
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,880
eating fruit or not but this is the

1704
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,680
accidents that happen

1705
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,760
these accidents end up cheating people

1706
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,200
so now you're afraid of a piece of fruit

1707
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,880
now you're afraid of a berry

1708
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,800
now you're now you're not getting the

1709
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,559
healing you need now you're not can i

1710
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,000
just tell you something

1711
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:12,000
you need you need

1712
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,319
to actually be you need to have glucose

1713
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,200
in your body to live

1714
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,680
you need to have sugar in your system we

1715
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,960
can't

1716
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:23,680
function without it we live

1717
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,640
and breathe because of sugar if you take

1718
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,240
out glucose

1719
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,440
we die okay remove glucose from

1720
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,920
us we lay there and we die did you know

1721
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,000
that

1722
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,000
glucose is critical to every cell in our

1723
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,680
body it's how we build muscles it's how

1724
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,119
we use our muscles that's how we wake up

1725
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,920
in the morning it's how we function it's

1726
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,040
how we think

1727
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:46,240
it's how we can do things all of it

1728
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,319
and so glucose is critical but what

1729
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,400
here but what the makers of the fructose

1730
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:53,040
intolerance theory don't know

1731
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,520
is that when your body's filled with all

1732
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,160
this

1733
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,920
fat fat in her liver fattener organs fat

1734
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,880
in our bloodstream fat in our intestinal

1735
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,559
tract lining

1736
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,760
we get a little insulin and insulin

1737
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,520
resistance so then they'll blame

1738
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,280
fructose intolerance on that

1739
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,200
but they'll say fruits doing the insulin

1740
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,119
resistance they won't say maple syrup is

1741
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,720
they won't say honey oh fruit fruits an

1742
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,640
attack on fruit

1743
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,559
but you yes you get a little bit of

1744
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,599
insulin resistance if you fill the fats

1745
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,520
that's the whole point

1746
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,359
when you learn how to get the fats out

1747
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,599
of the liver when you learn how to clean

1748
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:23,440
the fats out of the body the rancid ones

1749
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,280
when you learn how to lower your fat so

1750
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,319
you can get the glucose you need to

1751
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,559
thrive

1752
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:30,960
then you just there is no anything like

1753
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,880
the worry about that it's crazy

1754
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,720
and when we're loaded up with pathogens

1755
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,079
when we're loaded with bacteria when

1756
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,720
we're loaded up with

1757
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,960
bugs and bacterial toxins and when our

1758
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,079
liver stagnant and our liver is clogged

1759
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,799
you guys

1760
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,839
and we're loaded up with all that and

1761
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:48,319
then

1762
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,920
fruit ends up cleaning that out and you

1763
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,119
might get a little bit of reaction you

1764
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,000
might get a little bit of insulin

1765
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,920
resistance

1766
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,079
you might get a little bit of reaction

1767
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,480
because guess what the fruits cleaning

1768
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,640
that

1769
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,240
crap out the crap that's been building

1770
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,599
and you giving you symptoms to begin

1771
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,799
with that ended up at the doctor's

1772
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,280
office anyway

1773
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,240
it's about knowing what the problems are

1774
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,119
instead of getting

1775
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,000
trapped in the theories from hell you

1776
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,000
know i call them

1777
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,160
theories from hell for a reason over the

1778
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,119
years i said great another theory from

1779
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,839
hell

1780
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:21,760
to take people and make their lives

1781
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:24,480
miserable let's talk about histamines

1782
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,160
this is good tea by the way some

1783
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,920
peppermint tea

1784
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,920
so oh there's a lot of people they'll

1785
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,040
get told they're sensitive to peppermint

1786
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,520
are they allergic to peppermint they

1787
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,040
shouldn't

1788
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,119
have peppermint it's like are you

1789
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,520
kidding i'm not talking about peppermint

1790
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:40,079
candies here i'm talking about

1791
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,599
peppermint tea incredible for you so the

1792
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,960
but let's talk about histamines a little

1793
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,240
bit so histamines

1794
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,480
people think food creates

1795
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,640
they're the cause of histamines they're

1796
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,160
the cause of histamine reactions

1797
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,920
okay it's not foods causing histamine

1798
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,280
reactions what about the 90 year old

1799
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,799
what about the 70 year old what about

1800
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,240
the 80 year old who doesn't have any

1801
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,520
histamine reactions and they can eat

1802
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,680
everything under the sun

1803
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,640
danielle i eat loads of fruit and i have

1804
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,079
diabetes type one yet i'm on such a low

1805
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,839
dose of insulin

1806
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:14,640
danielle exactly and then if you

1807
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,040
if you bring in all these fats you'll

1808
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,640
you'll

1809
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,160
you'll need more insulin you'll get the

1810
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,559
insulin resistance

1811
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,440
incredible brilliant you're eating a lot

1812
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,960
of fruits

1813
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:28,000
exactly fruits get rid of

1814
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,240
diabetes over time they knock down those

1815
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,400
numbers for type 1 they get rid of type

1816
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:37,200
2 insulin resistance hypoglycemia

1817
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,520
donna stern hi please tell me how to

1818
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,480
find out why lectins cause my severe

1819
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,960
migraines

1820
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,520
no one seems to know what are you taking

1821
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,160
just

1822
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,559
is it lectins either you would never

1823
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,920
know

1824
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:52,319
really if lectins are causing a migraine

1825
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,720
unless you took a pill that was filled

1826
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,640
with all these leptins in it like elect

1827
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,400
you know which you never want to do but

1828
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,160
you mean the case because that would be

1829
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,480
just ridiculous in general

1830
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,839

00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,440
here

1850
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,000
headaches and migraines all right

1851
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:45,760
lectins don't cause

1852
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,079
migraines lectins don't cause headaches

1853
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,520
and that's the whole thing there's no

1854
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:52,079
science and research

1855
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,640
that lines up a leptin to a headache you

1856
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,839
can't

1857
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,520
relax into a migraine because what about

1858
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:00,000
all the people that can eat all the

1859
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,520
lectins of any kind they want

1860
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,520
all the leptins they want and they don't

1861
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,280
have a migraine all the lectins they

1862
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,720
want and they don't have a symptom

1863
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,480
because and what about all the people

1864
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,680
that healed from all their symptoms and

1865
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,480
conditions that i was talking about

1866
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,720
earlier

1867
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,680
that never even knew about lectins

1868
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,319
lectins are

1869
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,359
just noise is what they are so we have

1870
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,920
to be careful

1871
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:22,000
true cause of headaches and migraines

1872
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,400
i'm in here now and cleanse the heel

1873
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,240
okay when physical injury is not a

1874
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,280
factor and has been ruled out so

1875
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,280
physical injury

1876
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,720
has been ruled out for your migraine and

1877
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,599
headache okay

1878
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,599
commonly caused is over the 30 varieties

1879
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,799
of shingles the shingles virus you can

1880
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,720
talk to your doctor

1881
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,079
bring them bring this textbook medical

1882
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,280
textbook to your doctor

1883
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,200
can talk to your doctor about it but

1884
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,960
there's over 30 varieties of shingles

1885
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,400
and some of those varieties many of

1886
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,960
those varieties cause

1887
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,880
migraines they affect the nerves it's a

1888
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,799
nerve-based migraine

1889
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,319
when you look in here okay when you look

1890
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,079
in here but go to your doctor

1891
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,680
and and and talk to your doctor about

1892
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,200
this information so your doctor can

1893
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,839
actually help you find out what's going

1894
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,559
on

1895
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:06,960
so epstein-barr can actually produce

1896
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,440
neurotoxin giving people headaches

1897
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,760
i've seen bar giving people migraines

1898
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,520
and and what happens is the vagus nerve

1899
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,799
and the phrenic nerves play a role they

1900
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,760
get inflamed

1901
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,799
toxic heavy metals actually create

1902
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,720
migraines

1903
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:22,240
toxic heavy metals as well so it's

1904
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,040
really important to understand all these

1905
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,520
different things

1906
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,520
you know it's important to understand so

1907
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,920
um all these different things can do

1908
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,839
this and lectins are not why people have

1909
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,040
headaches and migraines let's talk about

1910
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,160
histamines right now

1911
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,240
i'm looking through kinds of heal

1912
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,839
there's over 200 symptoms of conditions

1913
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,760
and in the chapter in the back of the

1914
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,680
book you can see and you can find out

1915
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,200
your causes and go to your doctor

1916
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,040
and and and talked about that and you'll

1917
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,040
see supplements and protocols

1918
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,480
and how to use them and you can bring

1919
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,160
that to your doctor as well

1920
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,240
that's what i would do if i had a

1921
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,559
migraine i'd take this book

1922
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,000
i'd read it i take a look at it talk to

1923
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,599
your doctor if you want of course

1924
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,440
there's hundreds of customized

1925
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,960
protocols in medical medium information

1926
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,440
it's not one thing if you hear somebody

1927
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,400
say

1928
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,000
i tried medical medium you have did you

1929
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,960
do 32 ounces of celery juice every

1930
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,160
single morning

1931
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,839
did you do the heavy metal detox

1932
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,280
smoothie every day did you do the

1933
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,799
morning cleanse or wait did you do the

1934
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,319
369 advance cleanse

1935
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:16,160
did you do the um did you do the

1936
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,839
meditations in the medical medium books

1937
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,520
did you do all these things that you can

1938
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,599
customize

1939
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,119
thousands of protocols in here so

1940
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,680
somebody can get better because

1941
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,520
everybody has something different inside

1942
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,880
of them causing the problem

1943
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,720
so let's go into this a little bit about

1944
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,720
histamine people think food

1945
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:37,440
creates histamines but no

1946
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,880
yeah you can get elevated histamines

1947
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,240
when eating foods but

1948
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:45,760
why because certain foods

1949
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:49,280
feed bugs and other certain

1950
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:52,799
foods kill bugs

1951
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:57,200
that's how it works certain foods

1952
01:00:52,799 --> 01:01:00,480
feed bugs driving up histamines

1953
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:03,920
okay and certain foods

1954
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:06,000
kill bugs and clean up their mess

1955
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,520
out of the system which can drive up

1956
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,720
histamines

1957
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,920
it's a theory with nothing behind it of

1958
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,400
knowing what's going on

1959
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,359
the theory is histamines are created by

1960
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,880
your body

1961
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,319
your body's creating it it's kind of

1962
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,760
like similar to autoimmune it's a

1963
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:22,400
reaction occurring

1964
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,240
you know you really don't know why they

1965
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,240
have no idea but you know there's all

1966
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,319
these different theories to why

1967
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,319
but we end up lost and then we're stuck

1968
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:32,640
in the noise now about histamine food

1969
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:36,200
histamine creating foods

1970
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:39,359
and we run from our

1971
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,799
uncomfortable experiences with food we

1972
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,319
don't know what's triggering what's not

1973
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,640
triggering we don't know what's causing

1974
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,720
it

1975
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,720
we run we're running from our symptoms

1976
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,319
we're playing hide-and-go-seek

1977
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,160
we're now in a tree and then all of a

1978
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,839
sudden lectins are scaring us now we're

1979

a sudden histamines are scaring us now

1981

we're hiding we're playing high go seek

01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,640
your foods lots of fats

2033
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,160
whether they're bad fats whether they're

2034
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,880
healthier fats they still clog up the

2035
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,160
liver

2036
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,440
pathogens pathogens too um pathogens and

2037
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,079
their toxins the epstein bars the

2038
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,160
shingles the

2039
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,760
hhv sixes cytomegalovirus simplexes

2040
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,760
whatever the strep all

2041
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,000
that's all the stuff that clogs it up

2042
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,720
not fructose

2043
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,880
but it's a good question though

2044
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,480
catherine eating fresh fruit and greens

2045
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,720
gives me bloating

2046
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,680
ammonia permeability with heavy heart

2047
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,319
palpitations

2048
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,319
migraines heavy breathing and making me

2049
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:11,359
bed bound making it impossible for me to

2050
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,640
push through

2051
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:17,280
also getting fat free also getting fat

2052
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,400
free until the afternoon gives me such

2053
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,520
heavy symptoms

2054
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:24,799
i only eat coconut milk

2055
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:27,680
and nuts as fat but

2056
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:30,240
still can't go off of it how do i make

2057
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:33,760
the transfer to fresh fruit and greens

2058
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,960
and less fat in a way that's not so hard

2059
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,839
on my body

2060
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,480
been off the no foods and on celery

2061
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:40,720
juice for

2062
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,000
one and a half years and tried enzymes

2063
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:45,520
and aloe vera juice

2064
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:49,039
and so on how do i how do i get on

2065
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,720
um so you know ammonia

2066
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,240
ammonia permeability something really

2067
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,799
important to know okay so ammonia

2068
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:57,520
permeability is when your hydrochloric

2069
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,720
acid isn't strong enough to break down a

2070
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,880
lot of foods this is

2071
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,480
medical medium information only out

2072
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,359
there okay so with about ammonia

2073
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,640
permeability

2074
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:08,240
and and that's mm info and so no one

2075
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,799
knows about that so if you want if

2076
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,720
you're new

2077
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,720
this is medical medium information you

2078
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,000
guys is all unique and original

2079
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,240
i'm just saying that i'm not trying to

2080
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,839
toot my own horn it is all unique and

2081
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,119
original it's from above

2082
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,880
and so it's important to know that i

2083
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,240
don't say that enough so people think

2084
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,760
you could just google something and it's

2085
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,839
out there or something or you can just

2086
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,200
stop on the internet search or something

2087
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,960
no one knows about the ammonia

2088
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,359
permeability they only think there's

2089
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,119
such

2090
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,720
a leaky gut or something and that's not

2091
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,960
correct so

2092
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,640
first of all that building up that hcl

2093
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,760
which is the stomach gland so it's about

2094
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,760
recovering those

2095
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,039
over time it's not an easy thing and

2096
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,200
when you have pathogens

2097
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,200
in the system everything gets sensitive

2098
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,960
the nerves get sensitive the bloating

2099
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,359
can happen because of the

2100
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,720
the hcl being so low i've talked to a

2101
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,440
lot of doctors about this with their

2102
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,640
patients

2103
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,319
and um and so would would like

2104
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,079
this is what i would do i'd go to my

2105
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:01,599
practitioner and say i want to do

2106
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,319
i want to do um one of the mono eating

2107
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,480
cleanses

2108
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:06,160
like just potato only so the celery

2109
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,280
juice potato and some maybe some butter

2110
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,760
leaf lettuce

2111
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,520
and or some some romaine lettuce or red

2112
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,839
leaf lettuce or something and i would do

2113
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,039
i would go mono eating if i had this

2114
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:17,359
because what happens is

2115
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,359
with with any types of varieties of

2116
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,839
gastroparesis whatsoever because that's

2117
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,359
what

2118
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,960
what happens with any with people that

2119
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,720

of any kind of digestive problems and

2123
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,599
bloating and all these things that

2124
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,039
people have

2125
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,880
it's the mono eating cleanses are

2126
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,160
designed so read that whole section with

2127
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:40,160
your doctor your practitioner

2128
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:41,839
so you guys it so much information

2129
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,319
so much going on i don't want you

2130
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:47,359
blaming your body i don't want you

2131
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:50,240
lost in the ball of confusion

2132
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,960
with all the different theories they can

2133
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,000
really

2134
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,160
push you in to a corner

2135
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,319
and then but yet the makers of the

2136
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,280
theories don't know why you're sick to

2137
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:02,559
begin with

2138
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:06,160
so difficult so difficult

2139
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:07,200
um it really is so i wouldn't drink any

2140
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,799
water

2141
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,760
i wouldn't drink any water that's got

2142
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:13,920
the manipulated molecules man-made water

2143
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,640
and man-made water machines or man-made

2144
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,480
store-bought water or man-made mlm

2145
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:20,960
pyramid scheme multi-level marketing

2146
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:24,640
experiment scheme water businesses

2147
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,960
that mess around with molecules okay

2148
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,160
terrible idea terrible terrible term

2149
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,599
personally my opinion

2150
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,359
would never do it would never do the

2151
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:34,000
alkaline ionized water either

2152
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:35,280
so manipulated molecules manipulated

2153
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,240
water with ionizing

2154
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,359
i would not do it whatsoever in my

2155
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,680
personal

2156
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:44,079
opinion and what i've seen for years

2157
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,880
causes more problems and more problems

2158
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,799
and when you

2159
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,480
and the only reason why people get they

2160
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,880
think they get a benefit from one or the

2161
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,559
other

2162
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,920
is because they're already doing things

2163
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,000
to counter it

2164
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,599
they're countering it with doing good

2165
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,039
things for themselves like getting rid

2166
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,760
of processed foods getting rid of other

2167
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,400
things but

2168
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,400
in the end those waters will just those

2169
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,000
mutated waters will just send you down

2170
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,760
the wrong direction so be careful with

2171
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,119
those i always say that i'm

2172
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:12,799

01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,440
symptom you already have

2222
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,080
on

2223
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,960
about just how much could be going on

2224
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:49,839
there so just

2225
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,839
look at all that and see what's going on

2226
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,120
um kayla oh i always drink the alkaline

2227
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,000
water from trader joe's

2228
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,800
um listen the trader joe's by the way

2229
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,320
it's a great place

2230
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,480
great place to get food and so forth and

2231
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,440
everything but um but as far as out yeah

2232
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,480
the alkaline

2233
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:09,520
the alkaline ionized water um

2234
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,600
it in my opinion overall alkaline

2235
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,159
ionized water in my opinion

2236
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,320
is not is not a great it's not a great

2237
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:19,280
thing and i wouldn't do the bottled

2238
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,000
man-made manipulated alkaline water i

2239
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,400
wouldn't do that

2240
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,679
either so i wouldn't do either or it's

2241
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,600
not a good thing

2242
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,679
i i talked about that in past i'm going

2243
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,120
to do a big water talk again

2244
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,880
so i'm going to do a whole nother water

2245
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,520
talk and i'm going to go into it through

2246
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,400
water purifiers water purification water

2247
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,840
filtration

2248
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,679
ions this that i'm just going to talk

2249
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,000
about all of it eventually again

2250
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,840
so brenda why do fresh fruits and

2251
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,560
vegetables make my mouth itchy

2252
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,159
an esophagus swell fresh fruits and

2253
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:50,000
vegetables do

2254
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:50,400
um which fresh fruit or which vegetable

2255
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,199
too

2256
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,679
does one do it more than another um

2257
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,320
what's

2258
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,159
you know what you know what symptoms are

2259
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,560
you dealing with on a bait

2260
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:02,800
is anything else make it happen at all

2261
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,159
um that's not making it happen

2262
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,560
because i just went through this whole

2263
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:09,040
thing that what we do is when we

2264
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,400
when we push away more fresh fruits and

2265
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,320
more vegetables and all that

2266
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,679
and we get cornered and now we're eating

2267
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,280
very little things

2268
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,719
to the point where eating basically just

2269
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,800
meat or something it

2270
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,320
because we're not getting a reaction we

2271
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,800
what happens is the fresh fruits and

2272
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:24,800
vegetables they sweep out the neurotoxin

2273
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,480
so when you got neurotoxins we get in

2274
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,199
trouble with the neurotoxins

2275
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,800
and so neurotoxins are a big part of why

2276
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,760
so many people are dealing with those

2277
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,920
symptoms

2278
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,440
um but you can you know those

2279
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,440
neurotoxins can be trouble

2280
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,800
and they can make all that happen but

2281
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,080
what i would do is look

2282
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,120
here's what i would do if that was

2283
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:45,520
happening in me i i would get the book

2284
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,560
look at the mono eating cleanse so you

2285
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,280
can actually

2286
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,880
you can you can go in that direction the

2287
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,239
model eating cleanses that's what i've

2288
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,199
always told doctors

2289
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:56,480
to tell their patients and and and so

2290
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:58,560
many doctors right now

2291
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,159
that i have uh that i'm friends with

2292
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,520
that i know that contact me every day

2293
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,719
because the books are everywhere on the

2294
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,080
planet so doctors just

2295
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:07,840
they contact us non-stop um

2296
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,360
and they want information for patients

2297
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,480
and so forth and i've always told try

2298
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,120
the mono eating

2299
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,560
um and as you're healing you can end up

2300
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,560
eating more so what i've noticed

2301
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,920
that i've had doctors do this with their

2302
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,600
patients is

2303
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,719
when they do the mono eating long enough

2304
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,159
they start bringing in more and they

2305
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:23,440
don't get that swelling and they don't

2306
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,480
get that reaction then they don't get

2307
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,199
that swelling they don't get that

2308
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,080
reaction and

2309
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,080
therefore therefore

2310
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,840
looking at all the different questions

2311
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,719
spring water is amazing

2312
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,640
patricia said same here

2313
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,440
daisy when starting the heavy metal

2314
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,719
detox i started getting dizzy and

2315
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,400
lightheaded too

2316
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,480
then it went away after pushing out all

2317
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,440
the toxins exactly you pushed out all

2318
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,040
the toxins

2319
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,719
what happens is that disney

2320
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,920
enlightenment lightheadedness

2321
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,440
you know could have been one of your

2322
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,719
symptoms daisy from like that you've

2323
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,920
been dealing with on and off for years

2324
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,360
did you ever get dizziness

2325
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,199
at all before and then once you start

2326
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,320
pushing that out then that's the whole

2327
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,800
point you get that out and then you're

2328
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,400
you're

2329
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,320
you're you're free and you move forward

2330
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,400
with your life and you know and if

2331
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:21,600
you get more could be in there though

2332
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:25,360
that needs to be pushed out

2333
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,840
um so as far as different waters and

2334
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,199
stuff

2335
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,679
so andy andy you said which

2336
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:33,679
kind of water then spring water is great

2337
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:35,199
reverse osmosis is great

2338
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,280
distilled water is fine but make sure

2339
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:40,719
you squeeze lemon and put lemon in it

2340
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:44,159
purified uh purified water spring water

2341
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:45,840
um you know yeah a really good purifier

2342
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:47,760
could be great i like berkey that's one

2343
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,760
of the purifiers out there that i like

2344
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,040
near g you can do that get a whole house

2345
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,280
filtration that's

2346
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,120
you know you can get a purifier but but

2347
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,800
yeah i know the ionizers

2348
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,239
don't like alkaline ionizers water

2349
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,560
machines i don't like the also i don't

2350
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:03,760
like the other thing too the molecular

2351
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,280
like mutated water that's out there too

2352
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,719
man-made molecular it's just

2353
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,719
for the molecules it's straight it

2354
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,360
actually changes the molecule structures

2355
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:14,000
and all that just don't like that at all

2356
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:16,159
so yeah spring water ro water uh

2357
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
purified water sure whatever put lemon

2358
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:19,679
in it

2359
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
