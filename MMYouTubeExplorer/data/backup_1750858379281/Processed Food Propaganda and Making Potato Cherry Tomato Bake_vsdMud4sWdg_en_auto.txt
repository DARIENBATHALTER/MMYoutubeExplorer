[0.04 - 2.40] all right so we're talking about a
[1.00 - 4.96] couple things today we're talking about
[2.40 - 6.20] processed food propaganda processed food
[4.96 - 8.88] you're probably thinking oh he's going
[6.20 - 11.00] to just be all angry about processed
[8.88 - 13.20] food and fried greasy fast food
[11.00 - 14.88] restaurants and how bad it is in the
[13.20 - 17.56] United States and everywhere else or
[14.88 - 20.04] anywhere else and that's the reason for
[17.56 - 21.88] chronic illness and disease no we're not
[20.04 - 24.64] going to talk about that because that's
[21.88 - 27.00] [ __ ] that's [ __ ] I'm not for
[24.64 - 28.60] processed foods if you read medical
[27.00 - 30.88] medium books I don't know if you can
[28.60 - 33.20] even see them over there I talk about it
[30.88 - 34.80] not being a great idea obviously
[33.20 - 36.96] processed foods are not a great idea but
[34.80 - 40.08] what's happening right now it's a
[36.96 - 42.92] distraction it is a distraction that's
[40.08 - 44.24] happening and occurring and influencers
[42.92 - 46.12] and people in the health movement are
[44.24 - 48.60] falling for it they're kind of they're
[46.12 - 50.36] falling for that distraction forever
[48.60 - 51.60] chemicals processed foods food chemicals
[50.36 - 53.48] and they're they're falling for that
[51.60 - 55.80] right because that's what the evildoers
[53.48 - 57.76] want them to fall for that's the whole
[55.80 - 59.28] point so now it's going to be all about
[57.76 - 60.80] that right that's going to be the trend
[59.28 - 63.40] but people don't realize I'm going to go
[60.80 - 66.28] into great depth into
[63.40 - 69.44] this but people don't realize what the
[66.28 - 71.56] distraction is for is so nobody knows
[69.44 - 73.76] the real reasons no one learns the real
[71.56 - 76.76] reasons why people have chronic illness
[73.76 - 78.44] people are sick they are suffering the
[76.76 - 79.80] people that came to the medical medium
[78.44 - 81.16] information and medical medium books
[79.80 - 84.28] know this they've been there they've
[81.16 - 86.36] done that you don't eat processed foods
[84.28 - 89.28] right but I'm going to go into it a
[86.36 - 90.60] little bit more in a little bit we're
[89.28 - 92.92] going to get there so this is going to
[90.60 - 95.16] be a really interesting episode real
[92.92 - 97.40] interesting talk about processed foods
[95.16 - 99.76] you're going to want to stick around if
[97.40 - 101.16] you don't mind I would like to make
[99.76 - 103.48] something and I might even work on the
[101.16 - 106.56] board a little bit and do some other
[103.48 - 109.00] stuff too so I am here I got my oven on
[106.56 - 112.24] right there and let me just get started

[137.44 - 143.52] potatoes by the way that's a protocols a
[140.88 - 145.20] life saving protocols book right there

[145.20 - 152.20] blown away that's the Brain saer book so
[149.20 - 154.48] let's get started okay I got my tea over
[152.20 - 156.40] here if you don't mind Maria over there
[154.48 - 159.12] on YouTube says I'm having a hard day I
[156.40 - 161.76] hope this will make it better I hope so
[159.12 - 164.80] maybe I can make you laugh cuz you never
[161.76 - 168.88] know because if you've seen me in the
[164.80 - 171.60] kitchen before um anything can go wrong
[168.88 - 173.60] like something could hit the floor um
[171.60 - 176.00] the oven can stop working I mean
[173.60 - 178.88] anything can happen so maybe that'll
[176.00 - 180.52] cheer you up I will certainly not do it
[178.88 - 182.68] on purpose because I don't want to make
[180.52 - 184.92] a big mess but you never know so I'm
[182.68 - 186.96] going to get a bowl right
[184.92 - 189.44] here and I'm going to put this in the
[186.96 - 192.24] bowl so what I'm doing is peeling back
[189.44 - 194.56] these steamed potatoes right now okay so
[192.24 - 197.96] that is what I'm doing and I'm going to
[194.56 - 201.12] grab a dish towel as well going to
[197.96 - 203.04] moisten the dish towel right here okay
[201.12 - 204.92] so I'm going to peel these back a little
[203.04 - 206.36] bit is what I'm going to do and I'm
[204.92 - 209.16] going to stick this dish towel in my
[206.36 - 210.72] back pocket okay how's this tutorial
[209.16 - 212.64] going right now now right so I'm going
[210.72 - 215.00] to peel these a little bit
[212.64 - 216.12] better um they'll just look better
[215.00 - 218.20] they're better you don't want to keep
[216.12 - 220.44] the the peels in
[218.20 - 223.00] this cuz you get a different look you
[220.44 - 224.96] get a different vibe it's not the best
[223.00 - 226.32] most funnest thing so while I'm doing
[224.96 - 228.64] this I want to talk about processed
[226.32 - 232.00] foods for a little bit if you guys got a
[228.64 - 234.56] minute and so right now what's happening
[232.00 - 238.36] is we're taking a thousand steps back in
[234.56 - 241.16] the health world right so we're back to
[238.36 - 242.80] process foods again that's where we are
[241.16 - 244.40] that's where the health food is that's
[242.80 - 246.64] where the health world is going with
[244.40 - 250.12] their health food it's all about
[246.64 - 253.12] processed food so we're going back in
[250.12 - 255.64] the dark ages of the health movement I
[253.12 - 258.44] mean seriously that's where it's going
[255.64 - 262.44] and fine Let It Go that direction right
[258.44 - 263.92] I mean hey it happens it happens but
[262.44 - 267.00] that's not the reason for chronic
[263.92 - 270.36] illness I'm sorry but processed food is
[267.00 - 273.68] not the reason for chronic illness
[270.36 - 275.96] sure somebody can eat a processed food
[273.68 - 278.92] diet they can go to fast food
[275.96 - 281.48] restaurants they can eat a lot of these
[278.92 - 283.72] right here a lot of these right there
[281.48 - 285.72] double bacon cheeseburgers you know
[283.72 - 287.28] what's going to happen over time they
[285.72 - 288.60] arteries will slowly fill up with a
[287.28 - 291.04] whole bunch of plaque and junk and
[288.60 - 292.32] garbage over time depending everybody's
[291.04 - 294.28] a little different the livers are going
[292.32 - 296.36] to get a little bit of a fatty liver and
[294.28 - 298.36] clogged up over time they're going to
[296.36 - 299.96] get the pre-diabetes eventually to type
[298.36 - 301.44] two diabetes is what they're going to
[299.96 - 303.64] get and maybe some blood sugar
[301.44 - 306.56] inabilities in general outside of uh
[303.64 - 308.76] pre-diabetes and so forth and maybe some
[306.56 - 310.40] other things will happen and maybe
[308.76 - 312.04] eventually at some point if their
[310.40 - 313.56] arteries get filled enough with a bunch
[312.04 - 316.88] of junk and plaque they'll die of a
[313.56 - 318.08] heart attack that is not chronic illness
[316.88 - 320.80] that is
[318.08 - 323.84] not it's very important to
[320.80 - 326.36] know so Spence over there in IG says are
[323.84 - 329.88] those potatoes steamed or uncooked right
[326.36 - 330.88] now they are steamed potatoes I steam
[329.88 - 334.36] them
[330.88 - 336.44] prior and they are now going in here and
[334.36 - 339.08] I'm going to mash them I'm going to make
[336.44 - 340.40] this really fun dish right here and I'm
[339.08 - 343.96] going to try not to make a mess but I
[340.40 - 343.96] always do make a mess I just
[344.00 - 349.08] do okay so let's go back into processed
[346.80 - 354.32] foods if you guys are open to
[349.08 - 356.24] this so yeah processed foods are not a
[354.32 - 359.96] good thing I've talked about it in the
[356.24 - 361.76] medical medium books okay
[359.96 - 365.68] there's a lot of people unprocessed
[361.76 - 367.16] fried greasy fast foods a lot of people
[365.68 - 369.08] and they're not bedridden on couch
[367.16 - 373.12] Island and Mattress Island but a
[369.08 - 376.76] 20-year-old is a 19-year-old is a
[373.12 - 380.36] 25-year-old is a baby boomer will have a
[376.76 - 383.64] heart attack eventually at age 65 a baby
[380.36 - 386.12] boomer will have some other
[383.64 - 388.92] problem they'll have all these stints
[386.12 - 390.56] and shunts put in they'll have maybe a
[388.92 - 393.28] heart surgery
[390.56 - 395.00] maybe they'll they'll get eventually
[393.28 - 397.64] something going on with their pancreas
[395.00 - 400.04] and so forth they'll get obese their
[397.64 - 401.36] weight will go up baby boomer right
[400.04 - 402.96] they're eating processed foods and
[401.36 - 405.24] everything else but what about the
[402.96 - 407.28] 16-year-old that's in their bed dying
[405.24 - 409.32] and the 9-year-old that can't function
[407.28 - 411.60] and has fatigue and they don't know why
[409.32 - 413.88] and they think it's psychological and
[411.60 - 415.92] what about the 26-year-old that can't
[413.88 - 417.64] get out of bed and feed her children and
[415.92 - 419.60] take care of her children is she at
[417.64 - 422.12] McDonald's is she at Burger King every
[419.60 - 424.08] every single day no probably eating
[422.12 - 426.32] healthy food probably watching what
[424.08 - 429.08] she's eating probably seeing 20
[426.32 - 430.96] alternative doctors but she's sick
[429.08 - 433.44] because she's got this internal problem
[430.96 - 435.12] nobody knows about but once again we get
[433.44 - 437.04] these people that have loud mouths and
[435.12 - 439.08] they they end up you know going around
[437.04 - 440.48] they connect with other people in the
[439.08 - 442.72] industry and they're like processed
[440.48 - 444.80] foods processed foods let's save our
[442.72 - 446.80] children let's save the planet process
[444.80 - 448.40] foods let's make sure that that there's
[446.80 - 449.80] no forever chemicals in there make sure
[448.40 - 451.48] there's no food chemicals any anymore
[449.80 - 453.52] make sure there's no high fructose corn
[451.48 - 454.84] syrup in there anymore that's the real
[453.52 - 456.28] problem that's why the whole world's
[454.84 - 459.40] falling apart it's because of processed
[456.28 - 461.96] foods which is [ __ ] it's
[459.40 - 463.84] [ __ ] Jack Lynn over there Jackie
[461.96 - 465.80] says oh my God all over Tik Tok food
[463.84 - 468.36] vloggers yep it's all about processed
[465.80 - 471.72] foods and that is a setup that's a setup
[468.36 - 474.56] by a higher Archy in the industry making
[471.72 - 477.24] sure that everybody's talking processed
[474.56 - 478.60] food [ __ ] that is a cover up is
[477.24 - 480.72] what's happening in the industry I'm
[478.60 - 482.88] just letting you guys no it is you'll
[480.72 - 484.00] see It'll come out down the road just
[482.88 - 486.40] like all the other medical meme
[484.00 - 488.56] information comes out down the road just
[486.40 - 490.84] like the you know life expectancy was
[488.56 - 492.96] dropping all this time just like medical
[490.84 - 494.72] medium information published a long time
[492.96 - 497.24] ago now down the road they're talking
[494.72 - 499.36] about it it's going to happen just like
[497.24 - 501.92] this with processed foods it is a
[499.36 - 503.64] coverup for a bigger picture and people
[501.92 - 505.96] are falling for it
[503.64 - 507.92] everywhere and here's the funny thing
[505.96 - 510.32] you can take processed foods away from
[507.92 - 512.44] people and they'll still find them
[510.32 - 514.44] somewhere if someone wants to eat a
[512.44 - 518.84] processed food they're going to freaking
[514.44 - 521.64] eat the processed food it's like alcohol
[518.84 - 525.04] prohibition taking alcohol away taking
[521.64 - 528.68] liquor away only made the Moonshiners
[525.04 - 531.76] make liquor in the freaking woods and
[528.68 - 533.16] that's what happened you had hundreds of
[531.76 - 536.36] thousands of
[533.16 - 538.12] Moonshiners making alcohol in the woods
[536.36 - 541.20] is what you
[538.12 - 543.60] had every everybody still drank there
[541.20 - 545.24] were speak easys everywhere there were
[543.60 - 547.72] hidden joints where everybody was
[545.24 - 550.52] drinking themselves to death everybody
[547.72 - 552.88] had a hidden bottle under their pillow
[550.52 - 555.00] you can't take away alcohol they'll find
[552.88 - 556.88] a way to drink it you can't take away
[555.00 - 560.44] processed foods they'll find a way to
[556.88 - 560.44] make it and they'll find a way to eat
[561.48 - 567.56] it got a lot more to talk about with it

[599.68 - 604.60] truth they'll just they'll give me the
[602.12 - 607.12] warning so over there in IG which te are
[604.60 - 610.12] you drinking lemon balm with a dropper
[607.12 - 614.04] full of the vimergy lemon balm in the
[610.12 - 616.40] lemon balm tea because I feel like you
[614.04 - 621.24] know if you're going to do lemon bomb do
[616.40 - 621.24] it right so I put extra lemon bomb in
[622.00 - 626.24] there there's one thing on planet Earth
[624.68 - 627.92] is you're always going to get assistance
[626.24 - 630.84] to hurt yourself and self-sabotage
[627.92 - 633.48] yourself please understand that there's
[630.84 - 636.88] always going to be a lot of assistance
[633.48 - 640.20] the waiter is going to bring the tray of
[636.88 - 642.72] shots and alcohol there's always going
[640.20 - 645.44] to be assistance there's always going to
[642.72 - 647.52] be a fast food restaurant I don't care
[645.44 - 649.56] in Europe I don't care in the US I don't
[647.52 - 651.08] care there's always going to be
[649.56 - 652.44] somewhere where there's going to be
[651.08 - 654.16] someone's going to be able to eat
[652.44 - 655.68] something that they probably shouldn't
[654.16 - 658.16] be eating and it's always going to be
[655.68 - 659.76] here on planet Earth so we can talk the
[658.16 - 661.60] stupid [ __ ] game over over and over
[659.76 - 664.16] again process foods process foods we can
[661.60 - 665.80] do all that but we're missing the point
[664.16 - 668.20] of what really causes chronic illness
[665.80 - 670.28] and why people are really sick and why
[668.20 - 672.04] you're 25 years old and you're bedridden
[670.28 - 674.76] is it really from processed foods I'm
[672.04 - 677.20] curious is it is that why a 25-year old
[674.76 - 678.68] can't get out of bed and they're so sick
[677.20 - 680.24] they got vertigo and dizziness and they
[678.68 - 682.44] can't even function and put two words
[680.24 - 684.52] together and they got herpes breaking
[682.44 - 686.68] out everywhere and they're sick as a
[684.52 - 688.24] goat is it because of processed foods
[686.68 - 690.68] cuz I'm scratching my head here and I'm
[688.24 - 692.88] kind of confused a little bit there
[690.68 - 694.60] that's how ridiculous it really is all
[692.88 - 696.92] of
[694.60 - 698.44] it all right I'm going to get this dish
[696.92 - 702.04] going I'm just probably going to go with
[698.44 - 702.04] one more potato here I'm going to peel
[705.04 - 709.72] back what's the answer to remove
[707.24 - 713.36] processed food put everybody on clean
[709.72 - 716.36] keto put everybody on a clean keto diet
[713.36 - 718.88] put everybody on a a diet that's that's
[716.36 - 720.24] uh clear from of food chemicals is
[718.88 - 722.96] that's what what it is everybody's just
[720.24 - 725.36] going to get a steak stay away from
[722.96 - 727.32] potato is that what it is everybody's
[725.36 - 728.40] going to be a steak and salad person is
[727.32 - 729.76] that what they're doing that's the

[772.68 - 778.80] diet for 20 years and still had painful
[775.32 - 780.92] IC and MCAS thank you for Shining Light
[778.80 - 782.48] on this it's very important to know and
[780.92 - 784.96] you can have that for 20 years and you
[782.48 - 786.64] can be 18 years old and have that at 18
[784.96 - 788.00] years old is it processed foods that did
[786.64 - 790.80] it but no they're going to make it look
[788.00 - 793.20] like it is they're literally going to
[790.80 - 795.36] pollute the industry with the processed
[793.20 - 796.88] food propaganda to the point where even
[795.36 - 798.44] the influencers that are so-called in
[796.88 - 800.04] the health rub that are experts are
[798.44 - 801.36] going to be all over the TV channels
[800.04 - 803.04] talking about it everybody's going to be
[801.36 - 806.00] on Tik Tok talking about it and the
[803.04 - 810.68] whole things of Roose the whole things a
[806.00 - 810.68] setup whole things a setup
[812.72 - 818.00] yep the whole thing is the setup let's
[816.04 - 819.92] go into carnivore for a little bit if
[818.00 - 823.48] you just got here I'm making the uh
[819.92 - 824.80] potato and tomato cherry tomato bake
[823.48 - 826.40] okay so what I'm going to do is cut
[824.80 - 827.68] these cherry tomatoes right here I'm
[826.40 - 829.96] going to cut them in half I'm going to
[827.68 - 831.92] put them on top of this little kiche pie
[829.96 - 833.80] dish right right now I'm just kind of
[831.92 - 835.28] mashing these up you can roughly mash
[833.80 - 836.80] them I'm going to kind of give them a
[835.28 - 840.00] really good you know break them apart
[836.80 - 842.60] and give them a really good mash um
[840.00 - 844.32] um my cutting board sticks out a little
[842.60 - 846.48] F further than the the counter so I have
[844.32 - 848.76] to be careful if I put all my weight and
[846.48 - 850.20] all my strength down on this I might
[848.76 - 852.04] pull my cutting board down so I'm just
[850.20 - 854.16] going to break it up a little
[852.04 - 856.88] bit
[854.16 - 859.20] so there we go and I'm going to mash it
[856.88 - 863.08] up okay carnivore let's hit it well
[859.20 - 866.08] carnivore originally was a mono diet of
[863.08 - 868.40] meat I they didn't actually even eat
[866.08 - 869.92] eggs to start with right off the running
[868.40 - 872.00] those came late
[869.92 - 874.44] so it's really just carnivore diet was
[872.00 - 875.88] just people being like just eat meat and
[874.44 - 878.40] you'll be
[875.88 - 880.32] fine I called the shots many years ago
[878.40 - 882.08] that any carnivore expert is eventually
[880.32 - 883.68] not going to be a carnivore diet expert
[882.08 - 885.48] they're going to be a carnivore diet
[883.68 - 887.80] idiot and I'm not saying that in a dis
[885.48 - 889.40] you know a disrespectful way just in the
[887.80 - 890.72] mere fact that they're just
[889.40 - 892.76] experimenting on people who are
[890.72 - 894.84] following them just eat meat and beat
[892.76 - 897.16] only just eat chicken or chicken only or
[894.84 - 900.44] just eat meat maybe bring in eggs and
[897.16 - 905.72] that's it what happens is
[900.44 - 909.08] women don't do good on just meat chicken
[905.72 - 911.36] and Eggs only they don't they don't do
[909.08 - 913.88] good their body systems will start
[911.36 - 916.12] falling apart this isn't an anti- meat
[913.88 - 919.04] talk uh I'm not against people eating
[916.12 - 921.08] meat this isn't a vegan Channel but I'm
[919.04 - 924.04] going to tell you right now it was
[921.08 - 926.84] terrifying for women so it became more
[924.04 - 930.04] of a guys thing just eat meat and work
[926.84 - 931.64] out what happened where what happened
[930.04 - 932.76] was guys were hitting the walls I
[931.64 - 934.12] predicted it and there's a whole bunch
[932.76 - 935.44] of guys that used to be carnivore where
[934.12 - 938.36] they ate meat now they're not car now
[935.44 - 939.44] they're eating fruit meat and fruit and
[938.36 - 940.92] then they're talking stupid about
[939.44 - 942.08] vegetables how vegetables are all bad
[940.92 - 944.04] for you but then now they're eating
[942.08 - 945.60] vegetables so really what happened was
[944.04 - 947.40] all the carnivore people I don't know if
[945.60 - 948.88] you guys know unless it's a newbie
[947.40 - 952.00] that's starting on just meet all the
[948.88 - 953.44] carnivore people all left carnivore so I
[952.00 - 954.72] don't know what carnivore you're talking
[953.44 - 956.04] about that's another thing you asked
[954.72 - 957.80] what I thought about the carnivore diet
[956.04 - 960.00] what carnivore diet they all left
[957.80 - 961.92] carnivore they all brought honey in and
[960.00 - 964.20] lemons they didn't have honey and lemons
[961.92 - 966.28] in it before they all brought fruit in
[964.20 - 968.48] there they didn't have fruit in the
[966.28 - 970.36] carnivore Diet before they all brought
[968.48 - 972.68] berries in they didn't have berries they
[970.36 - 976.00] brought green apples in so now they're
[972.68 - 978.52] kind of on the low sugar low glycemic
[976.00 - 980.60] keto diet is what they're really on
[978.52 - 983.52] Paleo diet is what they're really on
[980.60 - 986.48] there are no carnivore diets anymore
[983.52 - 988.32] they shape shifted it they started out
[986.48 - 990.00] you know hey this is what you do you
[988.32 - 991.88] just eat meat and this is what you do
[990.00 - 993.80] women copycatted and just the
[991.88 - 995.60] reproductive systems just fell apart
[993.80 - 997.72] their brains fell apart they hit the
[995.60 - 1001.20] wall they were gone that was it onto
[997.72 - 1002.40] something else or half dead and then the
[1001.20 - 1003.68] guys that were actually doing the
[1002.40 - 1005.44] carnivore diet and they were up in the
[1003.68 - 1007.20] front running and social media making it
[1005.44 - 1008.88] look interesting great they were trying
[1007.20 - 1010.48] to stick with it stick with it finally
[1008.88 - 1012.16] they knew that they couldn't lie much
[1010.48 - 1013.88] longer to the crowd they were bringing
[1012.16 - 1015.20] in Honey because their brain wouldn't
[1013.88 - 1017.16] think they couldn't think at all they
[1015.20 - 1019.28] had no their intelligence level their IQ
[1017.16 - 1020.84] just dropped tremendously they were just
[1019.28 - 1022.56] literally bumping into walls cuz they
[1020.84 - 1024.68] had no gluc glucose to feed their
[1022.56 - 1026.28] neurons and feed their brain electrical
[1024.68 - 1027.88] activity went down because when you go
[1026.28 - 1029.84] carnivore where you're just mono eating
[1027.88 - 1031.88] meat your electrical activity just drops
[1029.84 - 1036.80] and goes down and falls apart and your
[1031.88 - 1039.80] short circuit so what happened was um so
[1036.80 - 1039.80] what happened was
[1042.60 - 1048.32] that the carnivore
[1045.32 - 1049.80] movement turned in basically to a
[1048.32 - 1051.80] bringing one thing at a time the
[1049.80 - 1054.80] carnivore movement turned in to bring in
[1051.80 - 1057.56] some honey the carnivore movement went
[1054.80 - 1059.40] okay bring in some fruit now bring in
[1057.56 - 1060.80] some lemons now and remember there's
[1059.40 - 1062.68] glucose and lemons so they were trying
[1060.80 - 1066.52] to get sugar they were dying for sugar
[1062.68 - 1069.52] you need glucose or you're just bad you
[1066.52 - 1072.32] have to have glucose or you can't
[1069.52 - 1073.92] function and so the carnivore diet is no
[1072.32 - 1075.72] more it doesn't even exist anymore
[1073.92 - 1077.12] unless a new person comes on social
[1075.72 - 1080.36] media and says this is what I'm doing
[1077.12 - 1082.12] meat only Eggs only chicken only good
[1080.36 - 1085.20] let's see what you do in 2 years you'll
[1082.12 - 1087.04] be eating honey berries lemons and then
[1085.20 - 1088.52] in newbie another guy will come into the
[1087.04 - 1090.04] mix and be like okay I'm on the cardiv
[1088.52 - 1092.64] war diet again doing it again be like
[1090.04 - 1095.12] dude that's been done over and over and
[1092.64 - 1096.76] over again and soon as you get popular
[1095.12 - 1098.76] enough getting enough people just to eat
[1096.76 - 1100.36] meat by itself you're screwed and you're
[1098.76 - 1102.12] going to be doing nothing but honey
[1100.36 - 1103.88] lemon and berries and you basically
[1102.12 - 1105.80] you're just experimenting on yourself
[1103.88 - 1107.88] and the people around you getting them
[1105.80 - 1110.76] to experiment and then that's where you
[1107.88 - 1110.76] are so that's the card of
[1116.00 - 1120.56] D so I'm just going to mash this up a
[1118.32 - 1120.56] little
[1121.76 - 1126.68] bit sure you eat a whole bunch of these
[1124.40 - 1128.72] every single day for years and you're a
[1126.68 - 1130.60] baby boomer and now you're 65 years old
[1128.72 - 1132.80] or whatever you are and you ate a ton of
[1130.60 - 1135.00] these and a ton of hot dogs and a ton of
[1132.80 - 1137.16] processed meat and a ton of garbage and
[1135.00 - 1138.48] a ton of everything else and yeah your
[1137.16 - 1139.76] your veins are going to be filled up
[1138.48 - 1141.12] your Aries are going to filled up your
[1139.76 - 1142.24] heart valves are going to be filled up
[1141.12 - 1143.92] probably going to need heart surgeries
[1142.24 - 1145.28] and all kinds of other things you're
[1143.92 - 1146.64] going to have the diabetes you're going
[1145.28 - 1147.96] to have the weight gain and obesity and
[1146.64 - 1149.24] you're going to be fighting it trying to
[1147.96 - 1150.76] exercise and that's going to be your
[1149.24 - 1153.16] life but that is not the reason for
[1150.76 - 1155.32] chronic illness and it isn't why people
[1153.16 - 1157.04] are sick and it's not why college
[1155.32 - 1160.36] students can't function anymore they
[1157.04 - 1162.64] have to be on Aderall how come right
[1160.36 - 1165.88] processed food that's the reason all
[1162.64 - 1168.16] right so I'm making um the potato and
[1165.88 - 1170.96] cherry tomato bake right now so I'm
[1168.16 - 1170.96] mashing this this
[1172.44 - 1179.56] up and giving it a good mash and it
[1175.60 - 1179.56] doesn't have to be perfectly mashed
[1180.28 - 1185.20] but forgetting that I have to make a
[1182.68 - 1185.20] recipe
[1186.56 - 1189.96] here there you
[1193.84 - 1199.60] go when you go carnivore you may get
[1197.24 - 1201.24] results off the bat reason why you get
[1199.60 - 1203.32] results is cu you're mono
[1201.24 - 1205.76] eating not just mono eating you're
[1203.32 - 1207.28] getting rid of the gluten doesn't mean
[1205.76 - 1210.44] it's a panace and it doesn't mean it's
[1207.28 - 1212.64] an answer to heal chronic illness you
[1210.44 - 1214.84] can take somebody they never had a
[1212.64 - 1216.60] problem yet they're 25 years old they're
[1214.84 - 1220.56] exercising and they go completely
[1216.60 - 1222.88] carnivore mono eating meat only and you
[1220.56 - 1224.40] give them a year you give them two years
[1222.88 - 1225.76] and they'll be off of it the reason why
[1224.40 - 1228.28] they be off of it is because their
[1225.76 - 1230.04] muscles won't build properly anymore
[1228.28 - 1231.80] they don't have any glucose to feed
[1230.04 - 1235.24] their
[1231.80 - 1238.44] muscles they'll start aging and look way
[1235.24 - 1238.44] older before their
[1239.08 - 1246.84] time they'll have the meat age the meat
[1244.28 - 1249.20] aging where your skin just starts to
[1246.84 - 1251.88] fall apart over time when you're young
[1249.20 - 1255.12] you look like you're 40 when you're
[1251.88 - 1257.04] 20 carnivore diets that's what it does
[1255.12 - 1259.56] you don't have any antioxidants in your
[1257.04 - 1260.92] diet
[1259.56 - 1262.24] another thing with people that have done
[1260.92 - 1263.80] carnivores they'll take a ton of
[1262.24 - 1266.00] supplements of all kinds they're just
[1263.80 - 1267.28] looking for anything whey protein powder
[1266.00 - 1269.28] creatine they're just looking for
[1267.28 - 1271.84] anything they can find lcarnitine
[1269.28 - 1275.32] they're taking everything under the sun
[1271.84 - 1277.76] because they're so so jonesen for
[1275.32 - 1279.44] anything because really they're starving
[1277.76 - 1281.00] themselves of like real nutrients and
[1279.44 - 1282.88] everything else I'm not saying meat's
[1281.00 - 1283.96] bad that's you want to eat meat fine but
[1282.88 - 1285.88] I'm just telling you what's going on
[1283.96 - 1288.04] with carnivore so many people lie on
[1285.88 - 1290.72] social media too they're telling you one
[1288.04 - 1292.08] thing but it's It's Not What It Seems
[1290.72 - 1294.92] they're telling you one thing but it's
[1292.08 - 1296.76] not what it seems they're actually doing
[1294.92 - 1299.44] something entirely different they they
[1296.76 - 1301.32] don't want to lose their like mojo on
[1299.44 - 1303.04] the set they're doing their social media
[1301.32 - 1304.12] and their reals and everything else and
[1303.04 - 1305.96] they're not going to tell you they
[1304.12 - 1308.08] cheated on this a little to survive they
[1305.96 - 1309.48] ate a little of this over here they were
[1308.08 - 1311.12] over here at their family's house they
[1309.48 - 1312.84] had a bite of this and then they're
[1311.12 - 1315.88] going back on saying I'm carnivore I'm
[1312.84 - 1315.88] carnivore this is how I
[1316.16 - 1320.36] eat rise with melum over there on

[1320.36 - 1324.68] diet and he had to fill up with honey
[1322.76 - 1326.64] during our session cuz he couldn't
[1324.68 - 1328.96] function anymore he told me how he feels
[1326.64 - 1331.20] more awake

[1396.44 - 1399.76] that's really great it's a fun one it's
[1398.12 - 1401.96] going to be so fun to eat so great to
[1399.76 - 1403.96] eat okay so I'm going to drop some lemon
[1401.96 - 1405.64] in here and then going to add some thyme
[1403.96 - 1408.80] and some oregano so that's the plan
[1405.64 - 1408.80] right here
[1419.52 - 1425.24] yep so I'll give you the Europe talk too
[1422.56 - 1427.08] about Europe right so everybody saying
[1425.24 - 1429.52] Europe food so much cleaner so much
[1427.08 - 1432.24] better but we got to keep in mind they
[1429.52 - 1434.88] are so sick over there they are so sick
[1432.24 - 1436.76] in Europe and I'm going to go into that
[1434.88 - 1439.72] a little bit
[1436.76 - 1441.12] too so what the take away from this is
[1439.72 - 1442.36] the setup that's happening the
[1441.12 - 1446.08] distraction
[1442.36 - 1449.24] purposely they're actually like you know
[1446.08 - 1451.92] acting like Europe is healthy because
[1449.24 - 1454.36] they have better food there and they
[1451.92 - 1458.08] don't do fast food like we do
[1454.36 - 1460.44] here really ignorant thing to say um and
[1458.08 - 1463.40] really what is it called freshman thing
[1460.44 - 1464.76] to say you know definitely somebody
[1463.40 - 1467.04] that's not seasoned in the health real
[1464.76 - 1469.12] but you'll see people out there
[1467.04 - 1470.84] talking and I guess it makes sense of
[1469.12 - 1472.44] somebody who's not seasoned either it's
[1470.84 - 1475.72] easy to fall into that all right so
[1472.44 - 1475.72] let's pop some fresh time in
[1476.24 - 1483.04] there people are sick all the same in
[1478.92 - 1486.04] Europe they're all the same in France
[1483.04 - 1486.04] Italy
[1486.16 - 1493.64] Netherlands they're sick everywhere
[1490.36 - 1493.64] Germany they're
[1495.12 - 1500.24] sick not even eating fast food and
[1498.56 - 1502.88] they're
[1500.24 - 1505.16] sick people growing their own food out
[1502.88 - 1507.76] of their garden and they're
[1505.16 - 1512.52] sick and they're growing their own food
[1507.76 - 1512.52] out of their garden and they're sick
[1513.92 - 1518.20] okay all right let me get some fresh
[1516.00 - 1520.36] time some fresh oregano in here that's
[1518.20 - 1523.48] going to get mixed up in here
[1520.36 - 1525.76] too so I'm kind of taking the Twigs out
[1523.48 - 1527.96] of the oregano for the most part any
[1525.76 - 1531.08] real hard twig but I'm going to leave
[1527.96 - 1533.92] some of of the softer Twigs in here so
[1531.08 - 1537.20] I'm get some oregano going right
[1533.92 - 1542.08] here but when you hear the rhetoric it's
[1537.20 - 1545.28] the same old [ __ ] it's like in Europe
[1542.08 - 1548.16] they're so much cleaner with their food
[1545.28 - 1550.36] that you don't have to worry in the US
[1548.16 - 1554.32] they're killing everybody with the fast
[1550.36 - 1558.72] food it's the same talk and now they
[1554.32 - 1558.72] just bring it back out again
[1562.84 - 1565.76] okay got some oregano here I'm going to
[1564.16 - 1568.00] chop up let me get some fresh time in
[1565.76 - 1570.40] here too got some right out of the
[1568.00 - 1573.76] garden right
[1570.40 - 1573.76] here there we
[1573.88 - 1579.76] go so I don't want it too Twiggy because
[1576.96 - 1582.40] this isn't a stew or a soup so what
[1579.76 - 1584.00] happens is with thyme thyme twigs and
[1582.40 - 1586.60] everything if you put it in something
[1584.00 - 1588.60] like this it it's going to be a little
[1586.60 - 1591.28] bit more Twiggy when you're baking it
[1588.60 - 1594.00] like that so let me get a little bit
[1591.28 - 1596.68] more here there we go getting a lot of
[1594.00 - 1598.88] little T little th leaves right there
[1596.68 - 1601.12] that's a big stem there get that out and
[1598.88 - 1604.40] a little bit more oregano too I want to
[1601.12 - 1604.40] make this taste
[1606.76 - 1613.60] great there we
[1609.88 - 1613.60] go give this a little
[1613.92 - 1619.00] chop guys don't mind that's a twig right
[1616.84 - 1621.28] there I got to get that out that's going
[1619.00 - 1623.84] to end up in there someone's going to
[1621.28 - 1627.48] have some be like what is this it's a
[1623.84 - 1629.92] big twig aw not good so right there
[1627.48 - 1632.92] rising out of the ashes over there on IG
[1629.92 - 1634.72] we are so sick especially in my country
[1632.92 - 1637.16] Norway
[1634.72 - 1638.96] yeah is everybody lined up at the fast
[1637.16 - 1641.20] food joint in nor Norway but I heard the
[1638.96 - 1642.84] fast food joint in in Norway is a lot
[1641.20 - 1646.04] healthier than ours but everybody's
[1642.84 - 1649.32] still sick people in Germany are so sick
[1646.04 - 1650.36] absolutely they always have been yes and
[1649.32 - 1655.28] they still
[1650.36 - 1658.44] are they're sick absolutely right but
[1655.28 - 1662.80] see the setup you guys the
[1658.44 - 1664.52] setup is tricking enough people to
[1662.80 - 1665.96] believe they're making a difference and
[1664.52 - 1667.96] they're doing something by attacking
[1665.96 - 1670.04] processed foods like I said you take
[1667.96 - 1672.16] away processed foods you take away fast
[1670.04 - 1674.04] food restaurants and how they do things
[1672.16 - 1675.60] people will find a way to still eat that
[1674.04 - 1677.32] they'll still eat it if they want to eat
[1675.60 - 1679.20] that that's just the bottom line you
[1677.32 - 1681.36] can't take it away you can't take their
[1679.20 - 1683.56] their weed away in the states that are
[1681.36 - 1686.20] you know that whatever it's legal you
[1683.56 - 1688.80] can't take their alcohol away you can't
[1686.20 - 1690.88] take their pills away you can't take
[1688.80 - 1692.68] their crap away they want to eat their
[1690.88 - 1694.16] fast greasy food fried food with
[1692.68 - 1696.56] chemicals in it you can't take it away
[1694.16 - 1699.76] they'll find it and eat it
[1696.56 - 1702.08] duh Emma over there in IG I'm in Europe
[1699.76 - 1704.60] and there are stricter regulations than
[1702.08 - 1707.72] us I know that on what is allowed to be
[1704.60 - 1709.96] added yes it's true in genetically
[1707.72 - 1714.68] modified IED food as well absolutely and
[1709.96 - 1717.56] that's true it still doesn't change
[1714.68 - 1719.84] anything it still doesn't change
[1717.56 - 1721.52] anything I know people in Europe and
[1719.84 - 1724.88] they're growing food out of their Garden
[1721.52 - 1727.76] they never even eat a processed food and
[1724.88 - 1731.12] they've suffered for 20 years with brain
[1727.76 - 1731.12] inflammation that no one can
[1733.04 - 1737.68] explain I get it in Europe they do have
[1735.64 - 1739.08] regulations absolutely fast food
[1737.68 - 1741.44] restaurants have to keep some of the
[1739.08 - 1743.40] food chemicals out absolutely is that
[1741.44 - 1745.60] the reason why everybody's sick in
[1743.40 - 1747.04] Europe is that the reason why every how
[1745.60 - 1748.32] come everybody's still sick in Europe is
[1747.04 - 1751.00] that the reason why everybody's sick in
[1748.32 - 1754.08] the US it's not the reason why yes it's
[1751.00 - 1756.28] not good it contributes to some degree
[1754.08 - 1760.72] if you eat enough of this you will have
[1756.28 - 1763.48] a hyper a hyper fatty liver also
[1760.72 - 1765.04] processed foods you know like like are
[1763.48 - 1766.76] stricter I the processed foods are
[1765.04 - 1769.36] stricter there too in regulations
[1766.76 - 1771.20] absolutely but people are just as sick
[1769.36 - 1773.92] they're just as sick getting just as
[1771.20 - 1777.12] much much cancer the heart disease the
[1773.92 - 1779.40] brain diseases the Parkinson's the ALS
[1777.12 - 1781.92] it's
[1779.40 - 1783.60] rampant so true just spoke to a woman
[1781.92 - 1787.44] over here on IG so so true just spoke to
[1783.60 - 1790.08] a woman who came back from Europe and
[1787.44 - 1792.64] said she started feeling neurological
[1790.08 - 1796.08] symptoms again and needed to get on the
[1792.64 - 1798.44] medical medum 369 cleans Europe is not
[1796.08 - 1799.72] the answer to heal as far as the s is
[1798.44 - 1801.64] meaning meaning like you can heal
[1799.72 - 1804.36] anywhere us Europe you can heal anywhere
[1801.64 - 1807.40] that's not what I mean Europe's not the
[1804.36 - 1809.12] answer just because the pizza in Italy
[1807.40 - 1811.92] is missing some of the chemicals that
[1809.12 - 1814.56] are in the dough here it's it's not the
[1811.92 - 1817.52] answer to stop chronic illness it just
[1814.56 - 1820.16] isn't you go to Italy you go to Sardinia
[1817.52 - 1822.72] you go to somewhere and you actually eat
[1820.16 - 1825.52] the freshest most delicious pizza you've
[1822.72 - 1827.72] ever had no process whatever the dough
[1825.52 - 1829.80] was made they ground up the wheat they
[1827.72 - 1832.44] did whatever right they you like you
[1829.80 - 1835.76] name it or forget Pizza you had the best
[1832.44 - 1837.76] salad mesculin mix ever grown you find
[1835.76 - 1840.08] it in Italy and they put the most
[1837.76 - 1842.92] beautiful extra virgin olive oil there
[1840.08 - 1845.36] was Millstone the olive oil is Millstone
[1842.92 - 1847.52] it's not the answer still someone will
[1845.36 - 1851.60] get sick someone will be
[1847.52 - 1853.92] sick and they'll be they'll just be
[1851.60 - 1856.32] suffering I'm not and I'm not dissing

[2035.36 - 2038.48] dive down a little bit meaning they
[2036.64 - 2040.08] start to calm down and skin even starts
[2038.48 - 2041.64] to calm down because they're on their
[2040.08 - 2043.36] vacation then they go back to Europe and

[2063.56 - 2065.84] really
[2066.72 - 2072.68] was herbal girl over there on YouTube
[2069.32 - 2072.68] that's so funny s see good
[2074.44 - 2078.76] point really it really was a good point
[2077.32 - 2080.68] I don't think I've ever said that point
[2078.76 - 2083.28] before I don't think I've ever said it
[2080.68 - 2086.00] in any live in any podcast and I don't
[2083.28 - 2088.84] think I've ever said it before so yeah
[2086.00 - 2090.52] that was a really good point chelini
[2088.84 - 2093.80] over there on Facebook I can't believe
[2090.52 - 2096.96] someone can even see me on
[2093.80 - 2098.92] Facebook Selen on Facebook but overall
[2096.96 - 2100.76] the quality of Foods is much better in
[2098.92 - 2103.64] Europe they have better standards
[2100.76 - 2106.36] absolutely will not argue that one bit
[2103.64 - 2108.16] but I can tell you right now you can
[2106.36 - 2111.16] even live above those standards in
[2108.16 - 2114.52] Europe and grow your own food only
[2111.16 - 2115.68] literally grow your own grapes only and
[2114.52 - 2119.12] still be
[2115.68 - 2121.20] chronically bedridden in Europe you have
[2119.12 - 2125.24] to understand what I'm trying to
[2121.20 - 2128.28] say yeah the standards are better
[2125.24 - 2130.48] good jaro Slava says over there on
[2128.28 - 2132.68] Facebook yes my symptoms got much better
[2130.48 - 2135.68] when I went to the US because I saw you
[2132.68 - 2138.08] in Culver City and got the light blast
[2135.68 - 2138.08] there we

[2157.92 - 2162.48] to see me in a park and so forth and I'm
[2160.48 - 2164.40] laughing because the whole fire
[2162.48 - 2166.28] department was there the entire police
[2164.40 - 2168.52] department was there the state police
[2166.28 - 2170.72] came from what I heard and like
[2168.52 - 2172.28] literally it was the craziest thing but
[2170.72 - 2174.40] everybody was calm and everybody was
[2172.28 - 2176.64] happy but what I'm saying is there were
[2174.40 - 2180.20] so many people in the city the line went
[2176.64 - 2182.28] four miles and and it was just it was
[2180.20 - 2187.12] unbelievable
[2182.28 - 2187.12] unbelievable from all over the world
[2189.56 - 2193.12] and I'll never forget it it was the most
[2191.52 - 2195.56] beautiful thing all right this is all
[2193.12 - 2197.32] good so I just wanted to mix this up
[2195.56 - 2199.60] just just a little bit better and then
[2197.32 - 2201.12] that's it I got the onion powder in here
[2199.60 - 2203.64] I got the lemon juice the garlic powder
[2201.12 - 2206.08] the thyme I got the oregano in here so
[2203.64 - 2208.68] what I'm going to do is pop this in this
[2206.08 - 2208.68] little dish
[2210.84 - 2215.80] here but even the recent expert
[2213.24 - 2218.48] carnivore guys are all eating fruit now
[2215.80 - 2220.52] and honey they're guzzling honey
[2218.48 - 2223.16] guzzling it it was off limits the
[2220.52 - 2224.64] original carnivore diet was off limits
[2223.16 - 2226.72] they were bumping into the walls I
[2224.64 - 2229.12] predicted it I predicted it 5 years ago
[2226.72 - 2231.04] I predicted it years before that and the
[2229.12 - 2232.68] guys I even predicted would be bumping
[2231.04 - 2236.00] against the walls and actually eating
[2232.68 - 2238.68] honey and fruit are eating honey and
[2236.00 - 2240.80] fruit all right so what I'm going to do
[2238.68 - 2247.24] is pop this in this dish right
[2240.80 - 2247.24] here just like we speak just like this
[2248.56 - 2251.60] there we

[2629.04 - 2634.20] right there it's in the brainsaver
[2630.92 - 2637.40] protocols books book right there it's in
[2634.20 - 2637.40] this book
[2640.68 - 2644.16] okay processed
[2651.80 - 2654.80] food
[2654.96 - 2658.40] ah processed
[2659.12 - 2664.36] food okay let's go all
[2664.64 - 2669.80] right guess what eating really really
[2667.36 - 2673.04] high fat diets that are also not
[2669.80 - 2674.48] processed to guess what it does it still
[2673.04 - 2676.92] clogs up the liver still gives you a
[2674.48 - 2679.84] fatty liver still kills your gallbladder
[2676.92 - 2683.72] in the end still gives you sluggish
[2679.84 - 2686.80] bloodstream dirty blood syndrome still
[2683.72 - 2690.04] clogs up your lymphatic system still
[2686.80 - 2694.24] starves your brain of oxygen and glucose
[2690.04 - 2698.12] and still brings you to pre-diabetic and
[2694.24 - 2700.12] diabetes type two
[2698.12 - 2703.52] that's what the keto diet can bring to
[2700.12 - 2706.08] you you ready processed food sluggish
[2703.52 - 2710.16] liver fatty liver
[2706.08 - 2712.76] right all the same like I was saying
[2710.16 - 2714.88] before so keep in mind that the keto
[2712.76 - 2717.48] diet can still do the same thing over
[2714.88 - 2719.04] time as a processed food diet the
[2717.48 - 2721.00] difference with the processed food diet
[2719.04 - 2723.24] you'll probably have some more chemicals
[2721.00 - 2725.00] in there obviously you'll have maybe
[2723.24 - 2727.40] you'll have uh you know a little bit of
[2725.00 - 2729.48] a fried grease every now and then you'll
[2727.40 - 2731.24] have some other things too maybe you'll
[2729.48 - 2733.28] be on more bacon than you were supposed
[2731.24 - 2734.80] to be on with nitrates and stuff so
[2733.28 - 2737.08] maybe you'll have nitrates and some
[2734.80 - 2738.72] extra chemicals and maybe overall if
[2737.08 - 2741.04] you're eating processed food too much
[2738.72 - 2742.56] fried food and fast food restaurant food
[2741.04 - 2744.44] you'll probably just get there a little
[2742.56 - 2746.24] quicker you'll get there a little
[2744.44 - 2747.76] quicker you'll still get the stuff in
[2746.24 - 2748.96] the arteries in the heart you'll still
[2747.76 - 2750.96] get everything else you'll just get
[2748.96 - 2752.40] there a little quicker maybe a little
[2750.96 - 2754.64] bit more than a little quicker but you
[2752.40 - 2756.96] still get there but keep in mind that an
[2754.64 - 2758.72] actual keto diet that's free from proc
[2756.96 - 2761.04] processed foods will still get you to
[2758.72 - 2763.36] pre-diabetic type 2 diabetes will still
[2761.04 - 2765.72] get you to brain function problems still
[2763.36 - 2768.80] get give you a fatty liver a sluggish
[2765.72 - 2771.08] liver still give you arteries that have
[2768.80 - 2773.56] plaque in them and all kinds of junk and
[2771.08 - 2775.84] fat in them and still get you to get a
[2773.56 - 2778.60] heart valve replacement or a heart
[2775.84 - 2782.40] attack by the time whatever 60 70 and so
[2778.60 - 2784.24] forth on a keto diet that's not
[2782.40 - 2785.48] processed so all they're doing is
[2784.24 - 2787.76] they're basically saying what they're
[2785.48 - 2789.52] fighting for is they're fighting for not
[2787.76 - 2791.56] getting you there as
[2789.52 - 2794.12] quick that's what they're basically
[2791.56 - 2796.64] doing but that has nothing to do with
[2794.12 - 2799.68] real chronic illness and why that
[2796.64 - 2801.92] 8-year-old died that 9-year-old died of
[2799.68 - 2804.80] some kind of terrible disease where they
[2801.92 - 2806.80] just said you know the child's you know
[2804.80 - 2809.40] life just didn't want to live
[2806.80 - 2810.80] anymore they have actually terms for it
[2809.40 - 2815.52] but that's what it
[2810.80 - 2817.48] means you know like a thriving problem
[2815.52 - 2819.20] the child can't thrive so all these
[2817.48 - 2820.80] children are dying every day at 99 years
[2819.20 - 2822.92] old 10 years old 11 years old of
[2820.80 - 2826.88] physical body pain and fatigue and
[2822.92 - 2829.12] they're calling it like the child can't
[2826.88 - 2830.52] Thrive that's what they're calling it
[2829.12 - 2832.48] I'm not talking about cancers I'm
[2830.52 - 2834.72] talking about like they're calling it
[2832.48 - 2838.48] like the child can't
[2834.72 - 2840.88] Thrive and they got 10 terms for it got
[2838.48 - 2843.04] look it up Susan says why are people
[2840.88 - 2844.80] saying they're healing chronic illnesses
[2843.04 - 2847.08] and cancer on
[2844.80 - 2848.96] Carnivore okay so here's how it works
[2847.08 - 2851.24] okay you take somebody that's been on a
[2848.96 - 2853.24] processed food diet right and they're
[2851.24 - 2855.64] really overweight you put them on a mono
[2853.24 - 2858.72] diet and you starve them of
[2855.64 - 2861.08] calories you starve them of calories and
[2858.72 - 2864.28] you put them on a mono diet like just
[2861.08 - 2867.04] meat only okay what's going to happen is
[2864.28 - 2869.76] at first they're going to get some
[2867.04 - 2873.28] results just like if somebody goes on a
[2869.76 - 2875.48] sardine diet where it's sardines only or
[2873.28 - 2877.92] they go on a tuna diet where it's just
[2875.48 - 2880.12] tuna only or they go on a salmon diet
[2877.92 - 2883.40] where it's just salmon only the same
[2880.12 - 2884.88] thing happens their obesity comes down
[2883.40 - 2887.60] they start losing their weight they
[2884.88 - 2889.28] start shedding some pounds their liver
[2887.60 - 2890.48] gets a little bit better things get a
[2889.28 - 2891.96] little bit better they're not eating
[2890.48 - 2893.60] chocolate cake all the time they're not
[2891.96 - 2896.04] eating all the different Donuts cakes
[2893.60 - 2898.52] and cookies filled with all that extra
[2896.04 - 2899.80] fat and they're not eating all of that
[2898.52 - 2901.84] and what's happening is their body
[2899.80 - 2904.92] saying you're giving me a breather but
[2901.84 - 2907.16] here's the problem okay here's the
[2904.92 - 2909.36] problem you're eventually going to have
[2907.16 - 2911.84] to leave that diet you can only do it
[2909.36 - 2914.68] for a short time short time only your
[2911.84 - 2916.64] brain stops working your body starts for
[2914.68 - 2920.12] starts to starve with you know glucose
[2916.64 - 2923.36] deficiency and you start binging over
[2920.12 - 2925.96] time eventually you get so severely
[2923.36 - 2927.40] nutrient deficient that you get problems
[2925.96 - 2930.16] that you never even thought you would
[2927.40 - 2932.40] get later on on the ladder and which
[2930.16 - 2935.04] just so you know those people are doing
[2932.40 - 2937.88] cancer therapies people just don't go on
[2935.04 - 2939.68] Carnivore and don't do cancer therapies
[2937.88 - 2941.20] So when you say how come people are just
[2939.68 - 2943.00] throwing that blatant statement out
[2941.20 - 2944.96] there like that scratch the surface
[2943.00 - 2946.52] they're doing cancer therapies they're
[2944.96 - 2947.88] getting surgeries and then they're going
[2946.52 - 2950.04] on Carnivore they're getting
[2947.88 - 2951.72] chemotherapy they're getting radiation
[2950.04 - 2954.16] they're getting all kinds of alternative
[2951.72 - 2956.72] therapies and conventional therapies
[2954.16 - 2959.04] both fused together like in bed together
[2956.72 - 2960.88] they're in clinics they're getting stem
[2959.04 - 2962.28] cell therapy they're getting all this
[2960.88 - 2963.72] crazy stuff right they're getting all
[2962.28 - 2965.08] this stuff and then they're eating
[2963.72 - 2967.16] carnivore and then they're telling you
[2965.08 - 2969.12] the carnivore got their cancer better or
[2967.16 - 2970.16] they cancer into remission or they
[2969.12 - 2972.40] cancer
[2970.16 - 2974.00] reduced you scratch the surface you got
[2972.40 - 2978.28] to understand what the details are the
[2974.00 - 2981.24] details are there they're there
[2978.28 - 2983.60] okay nobody gets this big old diagnosis
[2981.24 - 2985.28] of cancer and then now they're saying
[2983.60 - 2987.72] well I'll just go carnivore and just
[2985.28 - 2990.72] ignore everything the 20 oncologists are
[2987.72 - 2993.16] telling me every single day they don't
[2990.72 - 2994.56] do that they listen to their oncologist
[2993.16 - 2996.28] and they work with all their doctors on
[2994.56 - 2998.20] their cancer therapies on all their
[2996.28 - 3000.28] cancer therapies and meanwhile their
[2998.20 - 3001.96] doctors are helping them heal their
[3000.28 - 3003.88] cancer or putting it into remission
[3001.96 - 3005.52] whatever a blood cancer or some kind of
[3003.88 - 3007.84] lymphatic cancer that they did surgery
[3005.52 - 3009.08] on they're putting them into remission
[3007.84 - 3012.24] and then the person's saying it was
[3009.08 - 3012.24] carnivore that cured my
[3012.88 - 3017.40] cancer the people who were carnivore
[3015.28 - 3021.00] eventually at honey and fruit and fruit
[3017.40 - 3023.36] juice interesting
[3021.00 - 3025.48] interesting so I don't know who's going
[3023.36 - 3027.16] on straight carnivore any any anymore
[3025.48 - 3029.96] there is no carnivore anymore
[3027.16 - 3032.64] the carnivore experts are drinking fruit
[3029.96 - 3035.24] juice they're not carnivore anymore
[3032.64 - 3037.52] carnivore is just a slab of meat in
[3035.24 - 3038.68] front of you and that's what it was and
[3037.52 - 3041.16] that's what it
[3038.68 - 3043.28] is I don't know why they're calling now
[3041.16 - 3045.56] a keto diet
[3043.28 - 3047.04] carnivore because now they're doing a a
[3045.56 - 3049.44] low glycemic keto diet and they're
[3047.04 - 3052.88] calling it carnivore with a ton of Honey
[3049.44 - 3054.84] added to it and they might do a slab a
[3052.88 - 3056.32] bee for a little while for a long time
[3054.84 - 3058.16] like for a short time for a little while
[3056.32 - 3060.88] and they do that but if you do it long
[3058.16 - 3064.04] term or a long time you hit the wall and
[3060.88 - 3067.52] your brain bends and you fall the heck
[3064.04 - 3070.12] apart you actually fall apart just fact
[3067.52 - 3072.40] that's just a fact you fall apart you
[3070.12 - 3074.24] hit the wall you hit the pavement and
[3072.40 - 3076.32] you're done that's what happens when you
[3074.24 - 3078.00] just do carnivore like it was meant to
[3076.32 - 3079.56] be at the beginning when people first
[3078.00 - 3083.52] started doing it where there where it
[3079.56 - 3086.28] was dudes not women dudes you put women
[3083.52 - 3089.36] just on meat and meat alone their bodies
[3086.28 - 3090.64] will fall so apart so fast sure they
[3089.36 - 3091.96] might get a month where they're dropping
[3090.64 - 3093.32] weight cuz they're starving themselves
[3091.96 - 3094.56] with calories they're dropping weight
[3093.32 - 3096.08] dropping weight starving themselves with
[3094.56 - 3097.92] calories they're dropping weight oh my
[3096.08 - 3100.84] God this is like the answer and then
[3097.92 - 3103.04] everything goes to [ __ ] 6 months later a
[3100.84 - 3104.48] year later their health is disastrous
[3103.04 - 3106.92] from going carnivore where they're just
[3104.48 - 3109.16] eating a piece of meat they're done
[3106.92 - 3111.28] they're done they got nut their nails
[3109.16 - 3113.44] fall apart everything falls apart their
[3111.28 - 3115.48] skin looks like it's 100 years old and
[3113.44 - 3117.56] they start falling apart they got no
[3115.48 - 3121.80] antioxidants they get no vitamin C in
[3117.56 - 3124.16] them and they start falling apart that's
[3121.80 - 3126.64] carnivore and their breath smells like
[3124.16 - 3128.56] rotten meat and their bowels are filled
[3126.64 - 3130.68] with rotten meat because their their
[3128.56 - 3133.16] their digestive system and their HCL
[3130.68 - 3135.80] won't even break it down anymore they're
[3133.16 - 3137.96] filled with rotten putrifying meat in
[3135.80 - 3141.04] their guts and it stinks coming out of
[3137.96 - 3143.00] them and their skin gets old looking 6
[3141.04 - 3145.00] months into it they're screwed they got
[3143.00 - 3146.64] to go on honey like the like the dudes
[3145.00 - 3147.64] did when the dudes started this this
[3146.64 - 3150.16] whole bad
[3147.64 - 3153.08] idea maybe some people can get away with
[3150.16 - 3155.20] it for a couple of years dudes a couple
[3153.08 - 3157.24] of years but you don't know what they're

[3297.32 - 3300.24] couple of minutes too unless you guys
[3298.44 - 3303.84] still want to talk about the carnivore
[3300.24 - 3308.00] Madness but we can talk about um keto
[3303.84 - 3310.24] for a little bit right so let's go into
[3308.00 - 3311.68] that couple of key things to know about
[3310.24 - 3313.20] the keto diet I just want to fill
[3311.68 - 3315.00] everybody in let's just take a look at
[3313.20 - 3318.24] this comment right here on IG coming
[3315.00 - 3319.96] right up Debbie over there on IG high
[3318.24 - 3323.72] protein high fat
[3319.96 - 3326.48] caused me to need my gallbladder removed
[3323.72 - 3327.88] 6 years ago I'm so grateful now that I
[3326.48 - 3329.28] know the truth thank you aw and let's
[3327.88 - 3330.84] hit that let's hit that right now you
[3329.28 - 3333.08] see this right here see that little
[3330.84 - 3335.16] green thing right there see that green
[3333.08 - 3338.16] thing that little green thing right
[3335.16 - 3342.00] there right the
[3338.16 - 3345.20] gallbladder okay high protein high
[3342.00 - 3346.84] fat right kills the gallbladder it truly
[3345.20 - 3349.00] does it kills the gallbladder happens to
[3346.84 - 3350.64] keto people 24/7 out there they're
[3349.00 - 3353.92] getting their gallbladders out left and
[3350.64 - 3356.36] right I get it if you're a 24y old dude
[3353.92 - 3358.20] keto guy and you're working out in the
[3356.36 - 3361.24] gym and everything looks great and you
[3358.20 - 3362.60] look buff and you're 23 24 years old and
[3361.24 - 3365.08] you got nothing better to do than just
[3362.60 - 3367.28] to work out 4 hours a day and you want
[3365.08 - 3370.48] to be on your you know high fat diet and
[3367.28 - 3373.16] your high protein diet sure absolutely
[3370.48 - 3375.88] looks great you'll eventually hit the
[3373.16 - 3378.12] wall and be doing green juices down the
[3375.88 - 3380.48] road and you'll be backing down on your
[3378.12 - 3382.24] meat backing down on your eggs probably
[3380.48 - 3384.48] quitting your eggs eating more
[3382.24 - 3385.92] vegetables eating more fruit is what's
[3384.48 - 3387.08] going to happen to you because some
[3385.92 - 3391.24] things going to happen to where you're
[3387.08 - 3394.44] just going to get sick and you end up
[3391.24 - 3397.84] sicker as the years go
[3394.44 - 3400.04] by D over there on IG my mother did
[3397.84 - 3401.84] carnivore this year and her kidneys
[3400.04 - 3405.16] almost failed so I want to go into that
[3401.84 - 3408.52] so kidneys cannot handle
[3405.16 - 3411.24] carnivore it is a guaranteed kidney
[3408.52 - 3413.60] death for people with weak kidneys worst
[3411.24 - 3417.08] thing ever for a kidney patient to be
[3413.60 - 3418.84] told is to eat a lot of meat worst thing
[3417.08 - 3423.36] ever for a kidney patient to be told is
[3418.84 - 3425.04] to eat any meat worst thing ever kidney
[3423.36 - 3426.72] patients should never be told to eat
[3425.04 - 3429.20] meat they will destroy and kill their
[3426.72 - 3431.12] kidneys without even realizing it and
[3429.20 - 3434.04] they'll just be like off the pasture
[3431.12 - 3438.04] boom gone kidneys can't handle high
[3434.04 - 3440.88] protein they can't can't handle high fat
[3438.04 - 3442.84] either that is a case where I
[3440.88 - 3445.44] listen I have to tell you something a
[3442.84 - 3448.00] couple different things right so in a
[3445.44 - 3450.64] lot of cases out out there all right a
[3448.00 - 3452.40] lot of cases out there okay when someone
[3450.64 - 3454.16] has a kidney disease or kidney problem
[3452.40 - 3456.12] or something going on with their kidneys
[3454.16 - 3458.08] they're told to eat protein and they're
[3456.12 - 3459.64] told to stay away from all kinds of bad
[3458.08 - 3461.76] stuff right don't don't eat the
[3459.64 - 3463.88] processed food you got to but they don't
[3461.76 - 3466.56] realize too that eating nothing but
[3463.88 - 3469.24] chicken and meat and eggs with a kidney
[3466.56 - 3474.36] problem and oh my God it is a life
[3469.24 - 3474.36] shortener a life shortener really really
[3474.44 - 3478.44] sad it's going to the key diet for a
[3476.68 - 3481.52] little bit first of all there is no keto
[3478.44 - 3484.08] diet either anymore it's gone you cannot
[3481.52 - 3486.76] go into ketosis ever if you even ate a
[3484.08 - 3489.88] half of avocado and avocado has sugar in
[3486.76 - 3491.68] it naturally you cannot go into ketosis
[3489.88 - 3494.00] if you're doing avocado it's not going
[3491.68 - 3495.88] to happen if you do a nut or a seed if
[3494.00 - 3499.04] you do peanut butter if you do peanut
[3495.88 - 3500.92] Butter's sweet there's sugar in nuts you
[3499.04 - 3502.28] can't go into ketosis if you're eating
[3500.92 - 3504.52] peanut butters and nut Butters and
[3502.28 - 3507.16] almond butter Butters and almond milk
[3504.52 - 3509.76] and everything you can't actually go
[3507.16 - 3512.88] into ketosis right so there is no
[3509.76 - 3514.88] ketosis anymore the ketogenic diet has a
[3512.88 - 3519.92] false name it's
[3514.88 - 3522.92] fraud the ketogenic diet is fraud it's
[3519.92 - 3522.92] instantaneously
[3523.04 - 3528.56] fraudulent that's what it is anytime you
[3525.80 - 3532.20] see keto diet it's
[3528.56 - 3534.04] fraud it should be # fraud keto diet the
[3532.20 - 3536.36] reason why is you can't go into ketosis
[3534.04 - 3538.60] it's impossible because no one the only
[3536.36 - 3541.36] way to go in ketosis if you only eat
[3538.60 - 3543.92] meat and chicken itself and only do that
[3541.36 - 3546.32] when you do carnivore the way carnivore
[3543.92 - 3548.16] was meant to be which is terrifying
[3546.32 - 3550.32] where it was just chicken and meat and
[3548.16 - 3552.60] meat only or turkey and meat only or
[3550.32 - 3556.24] just meat only you end up going into
[3552.60 - 3559.64] ketosis in that form or shape that's the
[3556.24 - 3562.60] original ketogenic diet it's carnivore
[3559.64 - 3564.76] but then keto took on this whole
[3562.60 - 3567.08] different life and it took on eating
[3564.76 - 3570.64] some green apples and low glycemic
[3567.08 - 3573.28] fruits and berries um avocados you
[3570.64 - 3575.04] cannot go into ketosis if you eat even a
[3573.28 - 3576.88] tablespoon of avocado because it has
[3575.04 - 3580.24] sugar in it which will then stop your
[3576.88 - 3581.88] ketosis it'll stop it so then if you
[3580.24 - 3583.92] even have a nut you have a walnut you
[3581.88 - 3586.56] just shut down ketosis if you had some
[3583.92 - 3588.16] tahini you shut down ketosis you have to
[3586.56 - 3590.36] understand something this is really
[3588.16 - 3592.44] important to know there is no ketogenic
[3590.36 - 3595.24] diet anymore it's a false name it's a
[3592.44 - 3596.56] fraud name is what it is now because you
[3595.24 - 3599.04] can't go into
[3596.56 - 3602.08] you can't go into ketosis unless you
[3599.04 - 3604.04] avoid all sugars except for the very
[3602.08 - 3606.16] minute amount of sugar that's in beef
[3604.04 - 3608.80] which is the blood from the animal and
[3606.16 - 3613.32] that's your best bet that's the only
[3608.80 - 3615.76] way J Marsh over there kidneys kidneys
[3613.32 - 3620.16] handle carnivore just fine protein
[3615.76 - 3620.16] doesn't hurt kidneys
[3621.36 - 3626.92] lying yeah that's really kind of you to
[3624.56 - 3629.44] make sure you told some kidney patient
[3626.92 - 3631.96] out there that they can eat lots of
[3629.44 - 3635.16] protein and carnivore for their
[3631.96 - 3638.72] kidneys how about that you think I'm
[3635.16 - 3641.52] lying well those words are killing how
[3638.72 - 3643.68] about that those words are
[3641.52 - 3647.24] killing because that's how it works out
[3643.68 - 3650.08] there because you can kill your kidneys
[3647.24 - 3651.64] with high protein diets if you have a
[3650.08 - 3653.12] kidney problem and over time you can
[3651.64 - 3655.08] weaken your adrenals with high protein
[3653.12 - 3657.64] high fat diets anyway you can weaken
[3655.08 - 3661.36] your adrenals anyway over time
[3657.64 - 3663.12] regardless but keep in mind absolutely
[3661.36 - 3664.76] without a doubt you got to be very
[3663.12 - 3666.68] cautious with how much protein you eat
[3664.76 - 3669.92] how much fat you eat when you got kidney
[3666.68 - 3671.68] problems really important CU kidneys die
[3669.92 - 3674.04] easy with kidney problems when you
[3671.68 - 3677.40] proteine them to
[3674.04 - 3678.76] death anyway thank you for the comment
[3677.40 - 3680.12] though because we just helped more
[3678.76 - 3683.92] people with kidney problems along the
[3680.12 - 3686.40] way that might see this so they
[3683.92 - 3687.48] learn all right so back to to a couple
[3686.40 - 3689.12] different things we talked about
[3687.48 - 3691.08] carnivore a little bit about how it
[3689.12 - 3693.12] works we covered that a lot of details
[3691.08 - 3696.12] and ins and outs about it how you you
[3693.12 - 3697.80] hit the wall you you actually can't
[3696.12 - 3699.68] function anymore your brain doesn't work
[3697.80 - 3701.64] you don't have enough glucose to your
[3699.68 - 3703.28] brain and your nutrient deficiency is
[3701.64 - 3705.40] actually get out of control and
[3703.28 - 3707.24] Skyrocket with carnivore here's the
[3705.40 - 3709.00] other thing too you can get tested with
[3707.24 - 3710.32] your blood for nutrient deficiencies
[3709.00 - 3712.00] while you're on Carnivore and it might
[3710.32 - 3714.08] look pretty good because your body is
[3712.00 - 3715.56] scrambling to get nutrients out of every
[3714.08 - 3717.84] single organ you have in your body
[3715.56 - 3719.80] listen listen to this detail this is
[3717.84 - 3722.48] coming straight from s so right now in
[3719.80 - 3723.88] this very second you go on Carnivore
[3722.48 - 3726.08] like carnivore the way they meant it to
[3723.88 - 3728.60] be originally before now they're just
[3726.08 - 3730.36] now they're just eating a keto diet now
[3728.60 - 3732.24] they're just eating you know a keto diet
[3730.36 - 3733.28] that isn't even a keto diet either now
[3732.24 - 3734.76] that they're just bringing all these
[3733.28 - 3736.64] fruits and berries and all this honey
[3734.76 - 3738.08] and everything else but if you eat
[3736.64 - 3739.68] carnivore the way they meant it to be
[3738.08 - 3741.84] where you're only eating meat and meat
[3739.68 - 3744.44] alone
[3741.84 - 3746.64] only your blood work might show
[3744.44 - 3749.16] nutrients because nutrients are pouring
[3746.64 - 3751.08] out of your organs to sustain you you're
[3749.16 - 3753.16] going to plead it but you don't know it
[3751.08 - 3755.48] so so is telling me what's happening is
[3753.16 - 3757.76] now your body's like drawing from
[3755.48 - 3760.00] nutrients anywhere and anyhow they're
[3757.76 - 3761.92] pouring out of Bones they're pouring out
[3760.00 - 3764.16] of organs you're mineral you're getting
[3761.92 - 3765.92] mineral deficient you can't go carnivore
[3764.16 - 3767.36] without getting mineral deficient you're
[3765.92 - 3769.88] totally screwed with minerals trace
[3767.36 - 3771.56] minerals and macro minerals totally
[3769.88 - 3774.12] screwed if you're carnivore so what's
[3771.56 - 3776.28] happening is nutrients are pouring into
[3774.12 - 3778.12] your bloodstream from all all kinds of
[3776.28 - 3780.92] different organs and tissue but that's
[3778.12 - 3783.28] how your deficiencies go worse and worse
[3780.92 - 3784.64] and worse and worse and so when you get
[3783.28 - 3786.52] your blood examined while you're on
[3784.64 - 3788.00] Carnivore for a month or two you got
[3786.52 - 3789.48] some nutrients in there because those
[3788.00 - 3792.00] nutrients are coming out of every
[3789.48 - 3794.00] orifice of your body to keep you going
[3792.00 - 3795.88] because you're in a desperate mode but
[3794.00 - 3797.64] then eventually once you run out of
[3795.88 - 3799.92] every nutrient every Trace mineral and
[3797.64 - 3801.28] every mineral and every antioxidant now
[3799.92 - 3803.16] you're totally screwed you get your
[3801.28 - 3804.88] blood tested two years from then oh
[3803.16 - 3806.44] you're deficient like hell and then if
[3804.88 - 3808.12] you switch your diet you're on a diet
[3806.44 - 3810.12] that's actually helping you they'll see
[3808.12 - 3811.80] your old deficiencies and be like you're
[3810.12 - 3813.44] so deficient and be like what the heck
[3811.80 - 3816.48] now I'm deficient that's how much
[3813.44 - 3818.28] confusion it is out there it's one big
[3816.48 - 3819.80] experiment on everybody it's like I'll
[3818.28 - 3821.28] be an influencer be like well I'm
[3819.80 - 3822.76] experimenting on myself but I'm not
[3821.28 - 3824.00] really telling you I'm experimenting on
[3822.76 - 3825.84] myself but this is what I'm doing for
[3824.00 - 3828.12] myself hey this is working six months
[3825.84 - 3830.08] later well I changed it oh I screwed you
[3828.12 - 3832.56] over I [ __ ] you over oh sorry about
[3830.08 - 3834.40] that oop I changed it now now I'm doing
[3832.56 - 3835.36] this and this and this and this 6 months
[3834.40 - 3837.24] later a whole bunch of people are
[3835.36 - 3838.48] experimen ING with you they're getting
[3837.24 - 3840.40] sick they're having problems they're
[3838.48 - 3841.72] getting deficient and then 6 months
[3840.40 - 3844.12] later you're like oh I'm doing it
[3841.72 - 3847.32] different now hey guys I'm adding this
[3844.12 - 3849.24] now I'm adding honey in here now yep oh
[3847.32 - 3850.72] sorry about that I just screwed you over
[3849.24 - 3852.16] for another six months of people out
[3850.72 - 3854.08] there that won't touch honey ever
[3852.16 - 3855.60] they're afraid of sugar and and those
[3854.08 - 3857.36] people are like gone you don't even see
[3855.60 - 3860.04] them anymore the point is it's like an
[3857.36 - 3862.88] experiment where you're actually taking
[3860.04 - 3864.84] people for a ride and now it's like oh
[3862.88 - 3867.28] I'm doing food combining now you guys
[3864.84 - 3869.80] sorry I'm a food combiner now yeah I got
[3867.28 - 3871.48] into food combining okay A year later oh
[3869.80 - 3873.96] what was I doing a year ago oh don't
[3871.48 - 3876.00] know cuz nobody cares nobody knows now
[3873.96 - 3878.08] I'm food combining oh wait a minute now
[3876.00 - 3880.24] I'm on a keto diet okay now I'm
[3878.08 - 3882.56] macrobiotic oh wait nobody likes okay
[3880.24 - 3884.80] now I'm on this it's crazy so people
[3882.56 - 3887.04] just experiment along the way now I'm
[3884.80 - 3888.52] doing alkaline ionizer water which is
[3887.04 - 3890.44] dangerous because of all the metal
[3888.52 - 3893.40] plates they you know what they do they
[3890.44 - 3895.84] leech oh wait now I'm doing colostrum
[3893.40 - 3897.60] hey guys now I'm doing colostrum now now
[3895.84 - 3900.48] I'm doing diet Tous Earth particles
[3897.60 - 3902.00] don't ever do those that's really scary
[3900.48 - 3903.40] but the point is is like unless your
[3902.00 - 3905.44] doctor tells you to and that's up to you
[3903.40 - 3906.56] and your doctor but the point is is now
[3905.44 - 3909.52] that's what happens people are
[3906.56 - 3912.36] experimenting along the way so just one
[3909.52 - 3914.64] big just screw ball that's it you're
[3912.36 - 3916.48] just on that ride and it's like well I'm
[3914.64 - 3918.04] following this guy and a year later he's
[3916.48 - 3919.48] doing something different o I just
[3918.04 - 3922.88] screwed myself for the last year
[3919.48 - 3926.88] following that guy that's how it
[3922.88 - 3926.88] works um
[3931.64 - 3935.24] yeah okay another thing too so let's get
[3934.28 - 3937.92] into
[3935.24 - 3939.20] it see over there on YouTube just trying
[3937.92 - 3942.44] to read some of the comments you guys so
[3939.20 - 3944.28] bear with me Annie over there on YouTube
[3942.44 - 3947.24] two years ago I did the keto diet and
[3944.28 - 3949.04] ended up in the hospital and almost died
[3947.24 - 3951.48] when I got out of the hospital I heard
[3949.04 - 3956.32] of medical medium you saved my
[3951.48 - 3956.32] life going to get me choked up
[3956.40 - 3962.64] bless you bless you I mean exactly and
[3960.16 - 3964.28] that matters so you were on a keto diet
[3962.64 - 3966.88] it almost killed you yeah I mean years
[3964.28 - 3969.32] ago I watched the keto diet almost kill
[3966.88 - 3971.60] a lot of people out there I watched it
[3969.32 - 3974.12] happen it was terrible and then keto
[3971.60 - 3976.52] diet changed into the paleo diet the
[3974.12 - 3978.96] paleo diet was this other kind of stupid
[3976.52 - 3981.48] version of the keto diet it's just it's
[3978.96 - 3983.44] just here we go around and around and
[3981.48 - 3985.92] around Marcel over there on YouTube my
[3983.44 - 3988.60] parents were instructed by my
[3985.92 - 3990.92] pediatrician to feed me a lot of protein
[3988.60 - 3992.92] and calcium rich foods while I had
[3990.92 - 3995.56] kidney failure my health did not improve
[3992.92 - 3998.08] for years kept the kidneys sick most
[3995.56 - 4000.12] likely because that's what it does but
[3998.08 - 4002.24] see it's not anybody's fault in the end
[4000.12 - 4004.48] but I can tell you right now what is
[4002.24 - 4007.20] kind of somebody's fault right now is
[4004.48 - 4010.68] the stupidity around processed foods and
[4007.20 - 4013.48] and the campaigns raged and waged on
[4010.68 - 4015.08] processed foods and the amount of
[4013.48 - 4018.88] information that's going around about
[4015.08 - 4022.52] processed Foods what what a decoy man
[4018.88 - 4024.84] the darkness loves a decoy like that
[4022.52 - 4026.88] loves it cuz that's not why people are
[4024.84 - 4028.92] sick I'm sorry it's not good for you
[4026.88 - 4031.16] you'll get a heart attack in 50 years on
[4028.92 - 4034.00] processed food yes but I'm going to tell
[4031.16 - 4036.88] you right now it's not why people are
[4034.00 - 4039.36] sick it's not why people who go to you
[4036.88 - 4041.96] know University students are sick and
[4039.36 - 4044.96] can't function and need to be on adderal
[4041.96 - 4047.64] it need to be on amphetamines 24/7 it
[4044.96 - 4049.32] need to be on on you know um you know
[4047.64 - 4051.24] all the different stimulants and every
[4049.32 - 4053.08] stimulants and everything it's not
[4051.24 - 4055.48] that's not why it's not because of a
[4053.08 - 4058.44] burger down the street I'm sorry but
[4055.48 - 4060.56] it's not because guess what in the past
[4058.44 - 4062.84] it wasn't like that and the burgers were
[4060.56 - 4064.84] down the street all the same kids are
[4062.84 - 4066.16] getting sick everybody's getting sicker
[4064.84 - 4068.12] and it's not just because people are
[4066.16 - 4070.40] eating a freaking bacon double
[4068.12 - 4071.76] cheeseburger once in a while yeah you'll
[4070.40 - 4074.44] get a heart attack it'll clog up your
[4071.76 - 4078.32] liver down the road and you'll get
[4074.44 - 4082.52] obese not one carnivore and keto
[4078.32 - 4086.44] person out there isn't on a ton of
[4082.52 - 4090.40] caffeine not one carnivore or keto
[4086.44 - 4092.40] person out there caffeine free I could
[4090.40 - 4095.72] say that a h hundred times in a row
[4092.40 - 4096.76] there's that one carnivore person that's
[4095.72 - 4099.48] caffeine
[4096.76 - 4102.16] free they can't function without it they
[4099.48 - 4103.88] need their caffeine fix carnivore people
[4102.16 - 4105.04] that are actually doing carnivore really
[4103.88 - 4106.48] carnivore where they're eating some meat
[4105.04 - 4108.80] for a little while are addicted to
[4106.48 - 4110.12] caffeine they're literally circulating
[4108.80 - 4113.12] caffeine all through the bloodstream
[4110.12 - 4115.16] 24/7 they are people out there you will
[4113.12 - 4116.96] see claiming to have found the Panacea
[4115.16 - 4119.76] because they get some quick results on
[4116.96 - 4122.16] carnivore or keto or really just they
[4119.76 - 4125.16] really just want fame and money don't be
[4122.16 - 4126.44] fooled they're on caffeine and you don't
[4125.16 - 4127.92] even know what they're really eating
[4126.44 - 4130.20] when they go when they do their cheat
[4127.92 - 4133.96] day that they're not putting on YouTube
[4130.20 - 4133.96] or on IG
[4135.72 - 4140.28] Neil said my emotions went crazy on keto
[4138.80 - 4141.68] because you lost your glucose and you
[4140.28 - 4143.56] didn't have it going to the brain so
[4141.68 - 4145.76] let's talk about that a little bit keto
[4143.56 - 4148.56] in the carnivore diet starves your brain
[4145.76 - 4151.64] of glucose stares it starves it of
[4148.56 - 4153.76] glucose right there can't function
[4151.64 - 4156.44] without glucose it keeps your brain
[4153.76 - 4158.56] alive it does and so what carnivore
[4156.44 - 4161.16] people do now is they're bringing lemon
[4158.56 - 4162.48] and honey in oh lemon was off limits
[4161.16 - 4164.36] before but they're bringing lots of
[4162.48 - 4166.32] lemon now because you need that lemon
[4164.36 - 4168.12] juice for your brain so it can start to
[4166.32 - 4170.28] function again they're bringing in honey
[4168.12 - 4172.24] too limit in honey oh because they need
[4170.28 - 4173.76] that honey for their brain to keep it
[4172.24 - 4176.16] functioning that's what they're doing
[4173.76 - 4178.04] now they've changed the game I've
[4176.16 - 4181.12] watched it I've seen it out there I
[4178.04 - 4185.12] predicted it that's just the way it
[4181.12 - 4189.24] is let me check on that real
[4185.12 - 4192.52] quick all right turn this light
[4189.24 - 4194.80] on it's cooking up
[4192.52 - 4197.48] nice got something cook in the oven I
[4194.80 - 4200.32] can't wait to dig into it cannot
[4197.48 - 4201.80] wait so what happens when you go keto is
[4200.32 - 4203.56] the electricity in your brain starts to
[4201.80 - 4205.32] diminish and you start to slowly die
[4203.56 - 4208.52] without realizing it and you're just
[4205.32 - 4210.96] walking around W on the decline and
[4208.52 - 4214.24] don't realize that so that's how it
[4210.96 - 4215.80] works okay you're on the decline and so
[4214.24 - 4217.72] what happened was intermittent fasting
[4215.80 - 4219.64] kind of took over the carnivore and keto
[4217.72 - 4221.16] thing like the old carnivore thing just
[4219.64 - 4222.76] recently where someone was eating just
[4221.16 - 4224.92] meat or the keto thing where they were
[4222.76 - 4227.68] trying to eat mostly meat so what
[4224.92 - 4229.44] happened was it moved on to intermittent
[4227.68 - 4231.68] fasting right that was the next place it
[4229.44 - 4233.04] moved into intermittent fasting was
[4231.68 - 4235.00] don't eat in the morning but make sure
[4233.04 - 4236.48] you're jacked up on caffeine all day and
[4235.00 - 4237.96] then eat what you want at the end of the
[4236.48 - 4240.96] day and it could be
[4237.96 - 4242.92] anything eat a salad with avocado in it
[4240.96 - 4244.92] if you want eat a burger if you want
[4242.92 - 4246.96] have some cheese if you want do whatever
[4244.92 - 4248.92] you want the intermittent fasting diet
[4246.96 - 4250.68] okay so it's eat until later later at
[4248.92 - 4252.04] the end of the day and people were like
[4250.68 - 4253.52] I feel better because they weren't
[4252.04 - 4256.04] having ham and eggs first thing in the
[4253.52 - 4257.64] morning burdening burdening their liver
[4256.04 - 4259.80] and their digestive system improved on
[4257.64 - 4261.96] the intermittent fasting diet because
[4259.80 - 4263.56] their liver improved their digestion got
[4261.96 - 4265.12] a little stronger they W weren't
[4263.56 - 4266.92] bombarding their liver and their
[4265.12 - 4270.24] gallbladder with all that fat in the
[4266.92 - 4271.76] morning eggs and cheese and oils and
[4270.24 - 4273.36] whatever else and peanut butter
[4271.76 - 4274.80] smoothies they weren't doing doing their
[4273.36 - 4277.80] peanut butter smoothies anymore and
[4274.80 - 4279.68] their almond their almond butter
[4277.80 - 4281.68] smoothies they weren't doing that
[4279.68 - 4284.16] anymore and so they were on intermittent
[4281.68 - 4286.76] fasting where they were just on caffeine
[4284.16 - 4288.92] all day long and then in then later on
[4286.76 - 4290.20] 4:00 5:00 6 o'clock they started to eat
[4288.92 - 4291.92] something and maybe it was a little
[4290.20 - 4293.96] healthier than normal maybe it was just
[4291.92 - 4295.76] a sloppy cheat meal but that's what
[4293.96 - 4298.80] intermittent fasting
[4295.76 - 4300.88] was that was the level people went to
[4298.80 - 4302.32] when they tried to do keto properly
[4300.88 - 4304.88] which was starve yourself of all
[4302.32 - 4307.64] carbohydrates and they couldn't survive
[4304.88 - 4309.08] they couldn't make it and it wouldn't
[4307.64 - 4312.36] work so they had to go intermittent
[4309.08 - 4315.44] fasting it's all just round and around
[4312.36 - 4320.68] and here we go again that's all it is is
[4315.44 - 4323.16] is round and round and round that's it
[4320.68 - 4324.16] that's how it works and it's sad as hell
[4323.16 - 4326.36] it's
[4324.16 - 4328.04] sad because what happens is when you're
[4326.36 - 4329.80] chronically sick and you got real health
[4328.04 - 4332.08] problems it's not just try to lose some
[4329.80 - 4334.16] weight and get your blood sugar your A1C
[4332.08 - 4336.16] better if you're somebody that it's not
[4334.16 - 4337.68] about the A1C and it's not about like
[4336.16 - 4339.52] get a little plao r dece in your
[4337.68 - 4341.32] arteries it's not about a stress test at
[4339.52 - 4343.12] the doctor's office the cardiologist
[4341.32 - 4345.20] office it's not about like getting your
[4343.12 - 4346.96] obesity down if you're somebody and

[4630.28 - 4635.88] high true true and as an Italian I want
[4633.96 - 4637.60] to go check on the dish I'm making in
[4635.88 - 4640.56] the oven right
[4637.60 - 4642.08] now make sure it's cooking right along
[4640.56 - 4646.56] ooh
[4642.08 - 4647.76] nice oh so good so good
[4646.56 - 4649.20] all right so let's keep on going a
[4647.76 - 4652.08] little
[4649.20 - 4654.20] bit just so you know people living to
[4652.08 - 4656.68] 100 has reduced in every single country
[4654.20 - 4659.04] around the world and when they go to a
[4656.68 - 4661.28] village where the young people moved out
[4659.04 - 4662.76] they ratio it the wrong way by the way
[4661.28 - 4664.92] and I hate to say this you guys want to
[4662.76 - 4666.28] know a little you want to you want to
[4664.92 - 4667.64] know a little diddy you want to know a
[4666.28 - 4671.16] little
[4667.64 - 4673.28] tidbit you want one right now it's
[4671.16 - 4675.04] painful okay because I know a lot of
[4673.28 - 4676.36] people in Europe I know a lot of lot of
[4675.04 - 4678.12] people in Italy I know a lot of people
[4676.36 - 4681.04] in France I know a lot of people all
[4678.12 - 4683.36] through Europe Germany and so forth and
[4681.04 - 4685.04] I'm going to tell you right here okay
[4683.36 - 4686.84] they take little Villages where all the
[4685.04 - 4689.16] young people moved out and then they
[4686.84 - 4691.20] ratio the numbers and they say this
[4689.16 - 4692.96] Village is a higher amount of older
[4691.20 - 4694.76] people so something must be different
[4692.96 - 4697.60] here in this Village than somewhere else
[4694.76 - 4701.40] it's one of the biggest
[4697.60 - 4703.32] Roes yeah you know where I'm going right
[4701.40 - 4706.56] but what happened is there was no way to
[4703.32 - 4708.60] make money in the village anymore so all
[4706.56 - 4712.16] the young people almost all of them
[4708.60 - 4715.92] moved out so they couldn't do the ratio
[4712.16 - 4718.24] game to Young and older people to ratio
[4715.92 - 4720.44] if people are actually really older
[4718.24 - 4724.04] there for a reason and they keep that
[4720.44 - 4726.84] detail out what what a Roose that is
[4724.04 - 4729.44] they keep the detail
[4726.84 - 4732.68] out they keep the most important detail
[4729.44 - 4734.88] out possible they find a remote remote
[4732.68 - 4736.32] village where there hardly is a young
[4734.88 - 4737.48] person working there anymore living
[4736.32 - 4739.04] there because they can't sustain
[4737.48 - 4740.72] themselves they have to make a life they
[4739.04 - 4742.80] move their family out they start their
[4740.72 - 4744.76] families out after college and so forth
[4742.80 - 4746.88] they don't go home The Village just has
[4744.76 - 4748.36] mostly old people and then they say whoa
[4746.88 - 4750.64] there's a lot of older people in this
[4748.36 - 4753.12] Village Let's test the water let's see
[4750.64 - 4754.80] what they're eating oh they're eating
[4753.12 - 4756.40] this beautiful grape that came off this
[4754.80 - 4758.24] Vine they're eating something here
[4756.40 - 4760.08] they're eating there but no one wants to
[4758.24 - 4762.00] admit or tell you they don't want to
[4760.08 - 4764.84] tell you the secret they're doing the
[4762.00 - 4766.64] numbers and the ratio game and they're
[4764.84 - 4769.16] not telling you it's because all the
[4766.64 - 4770.60] young people moved out of the village
[4769.16 - 4772.68] there aren't young people in that
[4770.60 - 4774.52] Village there's very few you want to be
[4772.68 - 4776.40] a person that's 22 years old and go to
[4774.52 - 4777.80] that Village and find a mate and party
[4776.40 - 4779.76] and everything else you're going to be
[4777.80 - 4782.24] sitting there on the curb alone there's
[4779.76 - 4782.24] nobody
[4785.12 - 4790.48] there what I'm saying is we have 100y
[4788.12 - 4792.96] olds all over the land around the world
[4790.48 - 4795.20] but we have a decrease of it people are
[4792.96 - 4797.56] dying faster and more and not living to
[4795.20 - 4799.76] be older as much and we're on the last
[4797.56 - 4801.44] round of the dinosaurs you guys right
[4799.76 - 4803.72] now we're on the last round of the
[4801.44 - 4805.28] Dinosaurs the older people that are old
[4803.72 - 4807.96] now there isn't going to be a big
[4805.28 - 4810.36] succession a big succession of older
[4807.96 - 4812.96] people coming their way I hate to say it
[4810.36 - 4816.00] but there's not and processed food is
[4812.96 - 4818.68] not the answer either
[4816.00 - 4821.40] way I predicted life expectancy was
[4818.68 - 4822.96] dropping dramatically and it did and
[4821.40 - 4825.16] science proved it and proved medical
[4822.96 - 4827.04] medium right
[4825.16 - 4828.84] the one thing you can actually have
[4827.04 - 4830.44] confidence in is the medical medium
[4828.84 - 4832.12] books because guess what it's proved
[4830.44 - 4833.64] right constantly and never proved wrong
[4832.12 - 4835.00] sorry but none of the medical medium
[4833.64 - 4837.04] books or information have been proved
[4835.00 - 4838.88] wrong yet science hasn't proved a single
[4837.04 - 4842.32] thing wrong instead they keep on proving
[4838.88 - 4842.32] everything right out of the books and
[4843.08 - 4849.08] poaching so we got a we got a potato and
[4847.16 - 4851.24] cherry tomato bake in the oven we're

[4856.24 - 4859.96] died horrible deaths listen here's
[4858.00 - 4862.56] another thing to understand if you
[4859.96 - 4866.88] interview old people they're not it's
[4862.56 - 4869.08] rare rare that a 101y old lady is going
[4866.88 - 4871.96] to say her sister's still alive and if
[4869.08 - 4875.40] she is and she's 97 it is
[4871.96 - 4878.16] rare it is rare they all tell you for

[4967.16 - 4974.36] years all right so listen I'm going to
[4969.72 - 4974.36] move this right here
[4987.36 - 4991.96] so
[4989.56 - 4995.16] um so here's what happens when you eat a
[4991.96 - 4999.04] lot of processed food okay not all
[4995.16 - 5002.04] processed food just some processed
[4999.04 - 5005.40] food there's some processed food that
[5002.04 - 5008.72] doesn't hurt someone but there's some
[5005.40 - 5012.16] that causes something to happen
[5008.72 - 5014.40] right over the years you get a
[5012.16 - 5017.48] buildup I even know if you can even see
[5014.40 - 5017.48] that you get some
[5018.36 - 5021.84] plaque and then your
[5023.28 - 5028.04] liver right and then your
[5028.32 - 5035.28] liver over the years you get a fatty
[5032.32 - 5037.48] liver dysfunctional liver
[5035.28 - 5038.88] you can get that on the keto diet you
[5037.48 - 5042.00] can get that on the carnivore diet you
[5038.88 - 5043.72] can get that on a a high fat vegan diet
[5042.00 - 5046.56] you can get that on a high fat vegan
[5043.72 - 5051.48] diet your liver turn into a fatty liver
[5046.56 - 5051.48] because you can have pathogens in your
[5051.76 - 5056.68] liver so this is the next part and the
[5054.16 - 5059.00] last part of this little talk so I I
[5056.68 - 5061.40] want you guys if you get a chance to
[5059.00 - 5065.56] take a few notes
[5061.40 - 5065.56] okay all right
[5066.12 - 5069.96] okay that's an
[5067.36 - 5072.72] artery that's an
[5069.96 - 5074.56] artery that's a liver right
[5072.72 - 5079.76] here
[5074.56 - 5084.04] okay you can be someone that that's on a
[5079.76 - 5086.16] vegan diet a vegetarian diet a
[5084.04 - 5090.24] Mediterranean
[5086.16 - 5092.64] diet keto diet carnivore diet and your
[5090.24 - 5095.16] liver go to
[5092.64 - 5097.28] [ __ ] because you can have three
[5095.16 - 5100.00] varieties of Epstein bar one variety of
[5097.28 - 5101.96] hhb6 one variety of cegal virus two
[5100.00 - 5104.08] varieties of shingles sitting inside
[5101.96 - 5105.88] your liver with a whole bunch of metals
[5104.08 - 5107.24] that were passed down from generation to
[5105.88 - 5110.64] generation that have nothing to do with
[5107.24 - 5113.48] this lifetime and your liver be a
[5110.64 - 5116.24] problem and you can be drinking coffee
[5113.48 - 5118.04] and tea black tea and green tea
[5116.24 - 5121.36] supplements and you can be eating
[5118.04 - 5121.36] chocolate and your
[5121.72 - 5125.96] adrenals your adrenals
[5129.24 - 5135.04] fall apart they're throwing out
[5132.00 - 5136.92] adrenaline every day the adrenaline's
[5135.04 - 5140.32] getting stopped up by your
[5136.92 - 5142.92] liver it's not about processed foods
[5140.32 - 5145.80] it's not it's other
[5142.92 - 5148.28] things the same people right now telling
[5145.80 - 5150.64] people don't you processed foods or
[5148.28 - 5152.64] gobbling down the caffeine every single
[5150.64 - 5154.52] day they're acting like they're Health
[5152.64 - 5157.08] experts they're out there talking on the
[5154.52 - 5158.40] lecture scene they're going on TV and
[5157.08 - 5160.64] they're sitting there process foods
[5158.40 - 5162.92] process foods meanwhile their caffeine
[5160.64 - 5164.84] habit is off the charts they're teaching
[5162.92 - 5166.36] people still drink your caffeine make
[5164.84 - 5167.76] sure you still do that oh and don't
[5166.36 - 5169.68] worry about alcohol either it's
[5167.76 - 5171.60] processed foods the problem and what's
[5169.68 - 5174.32] happening is their adrenals are blowing
[5171.60 - 5176.52] out all this adrenaline it's saturating
[5174.32 - 5179.48] their liver and that adrenaline makes
[5176.52 - 5182.96] the liver tired and the liver goes fatty
[5179.48 - 5184.76] even on a plant-based diet a vegan diet
[5182.96 - 5188.64] a clean keto diet
[5184.76 - 5190.84] a clean carnivore diet whatever it is
[5188.64 - 5193.44] your liver can still get Mucky still
[5190.84 - 5196.04] problematic your gallbladder can still
[5193.44 - 5198.12] turn to crap filled with all kinds of
[5196.04 - 5199.56] junk and debris and that's what could
[5198.12 - 5202.44] happen right
[5199.56 - 5205.16] there and so the processed food people
[5202.44 - 5208.00] they're just they're just decoys trying
[5205.16 - 5209.84] to become famous at this point oo I got
[5208.00 - 5212.00] a buzz a lot of people are interested in
[5209.84 - 5213.96] this process food processed food thing
[5212.00 - 5216.04] yeah great maybe I'll make it my mission
[5213.96 - 5218.04] in life life to stop the processed food
[5216.04 - 5220.28] because it's killing the
[5218.04 - 5224.68] planet meanwhile there's so many there's
[5220.28 - 5227.68] a sea of chronically ill people all ages
[5224.68 - 5231.36] suffering horribly suffering terribly
[5227.68 - 5234.28] out there they're suffering for real
[5231.36 - 5236.52] reasons yeah a baby boomer is going to
[5234.28 - 5239.16] have a heart problem a baby boomer is
[5236.52 - 5241.20] their liver going to get all stinky and
[5239.16 - 5243.96] and sluggish yeah they're going to have
[5241.20 - 5246.68] putrifying junk in their their arteries
[5243.96 - 5249.00] that got into plaque on their walls fat
[5246.68 - 5250.24] deposits on the walls of their arteries
[5249.00 - 5252.16] yeah they're they're going to get
[5250.24 - 5254.60] pre-diabetes they're going to get type
[5252.16 - 5256.20] two diabetes Yep they're going to get
[5254.60 - 5258.20] all that and then they're going to gain
[5256.20 - 5261.80] weight lots of weight they're going to
[5258.20 - 5264.48] get that too absolutely of course they
[5261.80 - 5266.64] are and every cheeseburger they eat is
[5264.48 - 5269.00] going to bring them to more weight but
[5266.64 - 5271.24] guess what that person could still have
[5269.00 - 5273.16] energy that person could still feel
[5271.24 - 5275.08] strong that person can still be out in
[5273.16 - 5277.32] the garden working they can still be
[5275.08 - 5279.88] mowing the lawn and then a 19-year-old
[5277.32 - 5281.64] is bedridden and no one knows wiser
[5279.88 - 5283.80] nobody knows what's going on and the
[5281.64 - 5285.92] 19-year old is bedridden because they
[5283.80 - 5287.80] got Epstein bar to the brain to the
[5285.92 - 5289.48] nervous system and they've seen 20
[5287.80 - 5291.56] doctors and they've had all their blood

[5473.00 - 5475.64] thing so here's the thing what people
[5474.64 - 5477.52] don't understand when you're doing
[5475.64 - 5479.04] medical Medium you're customizing the
[5477.52 - 5480.36] protocols you're looking at your
[5479.04 - 5482.80] problems you're finding out what's wrong
[5480.36 - 5484.56] with you there there are hundreds and
[5482.80 - 5486.56] hundreds of different protocol calls
[5484.56 - 5488.56] because you're looking for what's going
[5486.56 - 5490.12] on with you and you can make it right
[5488.56 - 5492.24] for yourself you can still do medical
[5490.12 - 5494.80] medium and eat meat you can still do
[5492.24 - 5496.16] medical medium and eat chicken if you
[5494.80 - 5497.80] really wanted to you can still do
[5496.16 - 5499.48] medical medium and be plant-based you
[5497.80 - 5501.44] can be raw plant-based if you want and
[5499.48 - 5503.56] still do medical medium but that's the
[5501.44 - 5505.84] incredible part it's geared for women
[5503.56 - 5508.00] and Women's Health and men too and it's
[5505.84 - 5510.48] geared for customizing to what's going
[5508.00 - 5512.20] on with each individual and that's what
[5510.48 - 5513.96] the medical medium books have done and
[5512.20 - 5514.92] you see there's a little emblem on that
[5513.96 - 5517.44] book right
[5514.92 - 5520.08] there see that little emblem right there
[5517.44 - 5523.08] millions of copies sold in the medical
[5520.08 - 5525.40] medium series millions of people around
[5523.08 - 5527.24] the world had their lives changed they
[5525.40 - 5529.68] live by these they're their Bibles they
[5527.24 - 5531.36] sit in their kitchens with them these
[5529.68 - 5534.48] books are packed with
[5531.36 - 5536.60] information keep that in mind and then
[5534.48 - 5538.16] stuff gets poached out of here yep it
[5536.60 - 5540.12] has it's been poached out of all the
[5538.16 - 5541.88] medical medium books all right so I
[5540.12 - 5545.44] think my dish is just about ready I'm
[5541.88 - 5545.44] going to pull it out
[5550.52 - 5560.32] see here all right there we
[5555.44 - 5564.24] are I am going to be careful because
[5560.32 - 5567.44] this is hot and I'm using a hand towel
[5564.24 - 5570.00] instead of an oven mitt
[5567.44 - 5572.60] because some of the this is because it's
[5570.00 - 5574.28] a bad idea but I did it anyway I did not
[5572.60 - 5577.28] get burned
[5574.28 - 5580.20] no I didn't so here we
[5577.28 - 5582.68] go this thing is blazing hot and I don't
[5580.20 - 5585.68] want to get my finger caught in there
[5582.68 - 5589.00] whoa here it is you guys there it is
[5585.68 - 5589.00] potato and cherry tomato
[5589.52 - 5593.04] bake just showing
[5594.56 - 5599.60] you woo and it's a hot one too let it
[5598.04 - 5601.52] cool down a little
[5599.60 - 5603.44] bit we'll give it a minute and then
[5601.52 - 5605.40] we'll cut right into it see what's going
[5603.44 - 5608.00] on
[5605.40 - 5609.88] I love these cherry
[5608.00 - 5611.28] tomatoes people are eating cherry
[5609.88 - 5613.52] tomatoes again they're eating tomatoes
[5611.28 - 5616.76] Again Medical medium books talked about
[5613.52 - 5616.76] how The Nightshade thing was a
[5616.96 - 5623.00] theory and not accurate people are
[5619.76 - 5623.00] eating tomatoes
[5623.72 - 5626.92] again all
[5631.92 - 5636.72] right so back to
[5635.04 - 5639.84] processed food
[5636.72 - 5639.84] propaganda all
[5640.76 - 5645.64] right there's a reason why it's becoming
[5644.76 - 5648.08] like it
[5645.64 - 5650.60] is Talk of the Town it's becoming
[5648.08 - 5654.32] popular it's becoming the trend to hate
[5650.60 - 5656.76] on processed foods there's a reason it's
[5654.32 - 5658.60] to make people believe that their
[5656.76 - 5660.36] chronic illness and their symptoms and
[5658.60 - 5661.68] their conditions comes from those
[5660.36 - 5665.32] processed
[5661.68 - 5668.12] foods there's a reason why
[5665.32 - 5671.40] that correlation is being forced upon
[5668.12 - 5675.00] everybody and that influencers are being
[5671.40 - 5677.84] stupid enough to actually run with it
[5675.00 - 5680.40] and act like they're you know an expert
[5677.84 - 5683.28] at this you know processed food whole
[5680.40 - 5684.60] thing and that people should look out
[5683.28 - 5686.44] and they should know that the rules need
[5684.60 - 5688.64] to change out there and food needs to be
[5686.44 - 5691.44] cleaner I get that
[5688.64 - 5693.76] part but it's not responsible for your
[5691.44 - 5696.96] chronic illness
[5693.76 - 5701.28] you can be on a keto diet and feed your
[5696.96 - 5704.92] viruses you can be on a keto diet and
[5701.28 - 5708.40] feed your bacteria you can be
[5704.92 - 5711.12] on an animal protein diet that's you
[5708.40 - 5713.84] know the the animals are killed in your
[5711.12 - 5716.00] backyard the Butter's made you churned
[5713.84 - 5718.28] it yourself with your own cows and
[5716.00 - 5720.12] you're churning your butter you're
[5718.28 - 5722.64] milking your own cows and you're
[5720.12 - 5724.96] drinking raw milk from your own cow and
[5722.64 - 5727.28] you will feed your viruses and you will
[5724.96 - 5729.84] be bedridden
[5727.28 - 5732.28] sure if you weren't sick yet and you're
[5729.84 - 5734.80] doing that everything looks great but if
[5732.28 - 5736.72] you ever get sick one day or if a bug
[5734.80 - 5738.96] finally gets a little strength and it
[5736.72 - 5740.48] rises up it's going to feed on the foods
[5738.96 - 5742.48] that you're eating even though you're
[5740.48 - 5745.80] not doing processed food life you're
[5742.48 - 5750.04] doing everything made at
[5745.80 - 5752.44] home you're growing your all your own
[5750.04 - 5754.56] food you can still get sick you're
[5752.44 - 5756.16] raising your chickens you're you're
[5754.56 - 5758.24] collecting your chicken eggs every
[5756.16 - 5760.04] single day and you're eating them and
[5758.24 - 5761.60] you're feeding them to your family and
[5760.04 - 5763.40] then all of a sudden one of your
[5761.60 - 5766.04] children out of your five healthy
[5763.40 - 5767.40] children starts getting sick you don't
[5766.04 - 5770.08] know
[5767.40 - 5772.88] why because there's a virus that the
[5770.08 - 5776.28] child has that's starting to take off
[5772.88 - 5778.52] and grow and so now you got teenagers
[5776.28 - 5780.28] and your teenagers are now some of them
[5778.52 - 5782.24] are getting acne and they're getting
[5780.28 - 5784.68] different problems and getting sick or
[5782.24 - 5786.28] getting tired or getting some OCD and
[5784.68 - 5787.84] you're like I don't get it because I've
[5786.28 - 5789.52] been churning my own milk I've been
[5787.84 - 5792.84] churning my own butter I've been raising
[5789.52 - 5795.08] my own cows I got my like I'm raising my
[5792.84 - 5797.80] own chickens they get the best organic
[5795.08 - 5800.36] eggs possible I'm raising them myself
[5797.80 - 5805.20] why does my daughter have OCD why does
[5800.36 - 5807.08] my son have ADD what's going on and what
[5805.20 - 5809.24] happened what's going on and what
[5807.08 - 5811.48] happened and then you just start then
[5809.24 - 5812.92] you're like what have I done wrong is it
[5811.48 - 5816.04] what I'm doing what's going on it's
[5812.92 - 5818.80] because there's pathogens and metals and
[5816.04 - 5821.76] these Metals get into everybody they're
[5818.80 - 5824.28] everywhere and we get exposure and
[5821.76 - 5826.48] that's just how it works down
[5824.28 - 5828.64] here there are people out there that
[5826.48 - 5831.08] live by the L land right they're back to
[5828.64 - 5833.68] the Landers they live off the land they
[5831.08 - 5836.04] grow everything then they got sick
[5833.68 - 5838.24] children like they got sick children
[5836.04 - 5841.08] that got sick later after they've been
[5838.24 - 5842.96] living off the land it's not because
[5841.08 - 5844.24] they were living off the land that got
[5842.96 - 5845.96] them sick
[5844.24 - 5847.96] it's way better than processed food
[5845.96 - 5849.68] diets way better than rolling up to
[5847.96 - 5852.32] McDonald's every single day with your
[5849.68 - 5854.48] kids definitely doesn't mean your
[5852.32 - 5856.76] children are free from getting sick or
[5854.48 - 5858.68] OCD when they're in college or be on
[5856.76 - 5860.64] Aderall when they're you know 21 years
[5858.68 - 5862.08] old or whatever it is it doesn't mean
[5860.64 - 5865.44] they're not going to get exposed and
[5862.08 - 5867.32] pick up bugs and pick up a new strap
[5865.44 - 5868.88] from somebody else or something else and
[5867.32 - 5870.96] pick up a new virus and have three
[5868.88 - 5873.60] varieties of epsteam bar virus herpes
[5870.96 - 5876.76] simplex one going to their brain stem
[5873.60 - 5878.48] and then the 22-year-old 23-year-old is
[5876.76 - 5880.68] now looking around for answers and is
[5878.48 - 5883.52] mad at Mom and Dad now saying You Raised
[5880.68 - 5885.28] Me on cow milk grown in our yard and You
[5883.52 - 5886.96] Raised Me on chicken eggs but
[5885.28 - 5888.76] something's wrong cuz I'm sick I can't
[5886.96 - 5891.00] function I'm on
[5888.76 - 5892.52] Aderall I've seen it because I've I've
[5891.00 - 5894.04] known a lot of back to Landers over the
[5892.52 - 5896.52] years and they're like how did this
[5894.04 - 5898.96] happen and why is this
[5896.52 - 5900.92] happening it's because it's not just
[5898.96 - 5902.44] about staying away from processed foods
[5900.92 - 5904.48] you should stay away but it's not just
[5902.44 - 5906.00] about that there's so so much more there
[5904.48 - 5907.92] the details are in the medical medium
[5906.00 - 5909.36] books and yes in the medical medium
[5907.92 - 5911.16] books it says stay away from processed
[5909.36 - 5915.92] foods of course it
[5911.16 - 5918.52] does stay away from fried greasy fast
[5915.92 - 5920.60] food everywhere in
[5918.52 - 5924.40] Europe here in the
[5920.60 - 5926.92] states everywhere stay away from it but
[5924.40 - 5928.92] if you're eating it it's not the sole
[5926.92 - 5932.24] reason why you're sick sure your weight
[5928.92 - 5933.92] will go up you'll feel sick your
[5932.24 - 5936.36] lymphatic system will feel up with
[5933.92 - 5938.68] poison and toxins
[5936.36 - 5940.48] yes but there's people out there that
[5938.68 - 5942.28] aren't doing anything like they're not
[5940.48 - 5944.48] doing anything like that they're eating
[5942.28 - 5946.28] really pure really clean and they're
[5944.48 - 5947.56] suffering they can't even take a shower
[5946.28 - 5949.32] they can't function they can't walk they
[5947.56 - 5952.00] have brain inflammation they have
[5949.32 - 5954.88] pathogens so it's important to yeah keep
[5952.00 - 5957.08] them off the processed foods
[5954.88 - 5960.88] but the keto
[5957.08 - 5964.36] diets the other diets out there the high
[5960.88 - 5967.48] fat vegan diets they can keep people
[5964.36 - 5969.00] sick or or also get them sick as well

[6226.92 - 6234.44] this that's right here that's in this
[6230.04 - 6237.36] life- saving book right here here it is
[6234.44 - 6239.96] yum yum
[6237.36 - 6242.72] yep Chelle says over there on YouTube
[6239.96 - 6245.24] can you talk about opening up detox
[6242.72 - 6249.12] Pathways here's how it
[6245.24 - 6250.88] works when you're doing medical medium
[6249.12 - 6253.52] information if you're doing the heavy
[6250.88 - 6255.24] metal detox cleanse 369 cleanse you're
[6253.52 - 6257.60] already opening them
[6255.24 - 6260.48] up that's the whole
[6257.60 - 6262.72] point you're cleansing that's what
[6260.48 - 6264.80] you're doing but you can't open up
[6262.72 - 6266.16] detail detox Pathways I'm going to tell
[6264.80 - 6267.60] you something about detox Pathways first
[6266.16 - 6269.28] of all nobody knows what the detox
[6267.60 - 6270.60] pathways are out there there's no
[6269.28 - 6272.96] science that actually shows something
[6270.60 - 6275.32] detoxing down a pathway and so forth
[6272.96 - 6277.52] right it was a term that was made up for
[6275.32 - 6277.52] your
[6277.76 - 6280.76] detoxing
[6280.92 - 6287.16] but I mean the crap that's out there so
[6283.76 - 6290.44] detox Pathways works like this
[6287.16 - 6293.64] okay everybody's detox pathway is
[6290.44 - 6296.16] different everybody's detox pathway is
[6293.64 - 6298.68] different not all the
[6296.16 - 6302.56] same because everybody is clogged up in
[6298.68 - 6305.20] a different place
[6302.56 - 6308.00] everybody is in a different situation
[6305.20 - 6311.16] it's not one size fits all the whole
[6308.00 - 6314.00] detox pathway talk falls into one siiz
[6311.16 - 6315.96] fits all again medical medium
[6314.00 - 6321.68] information isn't one siiz fits-all so
[6315.96 - 6325.12] it doesn't adhere to the dogma of detox
[6321.68 - 6328.68] Pathways because everybody's different
[6325.12 - 6329.84] you may have a clogged up liver in a
[6328.68 - 6331.12] different part of the liver the bottom
[6329.84 - 6333.92] of the liver the center of the liver the
[6331.12 - 6336.96] top of the liver you may have extremely
[6333.92 - 6338.60] dehydrated dirty blood syndrome you may
[6336.96 - 6340.20] have different adrenal problems than
[6338.60 - 6342.76] somebody else it's releasing adrenaline
[6340.20 - 6346.28] getting in the way of
[6342.76 - 6349.24] detoxification everybody's detox pathway
[6346.28 - 6353.68] do you want to call it that is
[6349.24 - 6355.72] different one size fits all
[6353.68 - 6357.48] is not a great thing when it comes down
[6355.72 - 6359.04] to Healing that's why medical medium
[6357.48 - 6361.12] information has the most people healed
[6359.04 - 6362.84] worldwide than anything else there ever
[6361.12 - 6365.44] was or ever will
[6362.84 - 6367.88] be there's nothing out there there's no
[6365.44 - 6370.72] influencer that got more people better
[6367.88 - 6372.72] there's no you know there's no system
[6370.72 - 6374.36] out there health system with some kind
[6372.72 - 6376.80] of Dogma in the alternative medicine
[6374.36 - 6380.40] world that got more people
[6376.80 - 6382.32] better there's no place on this planet
[6380.40 - 6383.80] that got more people healed and better
[6382.32 - 6387.72] and recovered than medical medium
[6383.80 - 6390.52] information in books ever it does not
[6387.72 - 6393.24] exist so keep that in mind detox
[6390.52 - 6395.56] Pathways is a one- siiz
[6393.24 - 6397.88] fits-all bringing you to a place that
[6395.56 - 6399.92] that's how it's going to work for you
[6397.88 - 6402.64] it's like strong arming you to that's
[6399.92 - 6404.56] how it's going to work for you but you
[6402.64 - 6406.40] are different than this person this
[6404.56 - 6409.20] person's different than this person
[6406.40 - 6411.88] remember it's all about customizing
[6409.20 - 6413.40] somebody May detox quicker because they
[6411.88 - 6416.12] have a different pathway way than
[6413.40 - 6418.92] somebody else not all or everybody's
[6416.12 - 6421.60] organs sit in the same position not
[6418.92 - 6424.16] every single organ is the same size not
[6421.60 - 6427.08] everybody's bloodstream flows the same
[6424.16 - 6430.60] way detox Pathways is kind of just a
[6427.08 - 6433.92] [ __ ] term for just you know come to
[6430.60 - 6433.92] me and I'll teach you how to
[6434.04 - 6437.32] detox when you're doing when you're
[6435.92 - 6439.20] getting the metals out you're cleaning
[6437.32 - 6441.00] up the liver you are detoxing but you're
[6439.20 - 6443.92] detoxing on the rate that your body
[6441.00 - 6445.76] wants to detox on you're customizing it
[6443.92 - 6447.20] to what your body needs and wants to do
[6445.76 - 6449.48] you're different than somebody else keep
[6447.20 - 6449.48] that in
[6450.76 - 6458.44] mind yeah jeno over there on YouTube
[6455.44 - 6458.44] word
[6460.60 - 6465.32] word so keep in mind you guys that
[6462.88 - 6467.08] that's how it works your lymphatic
[6465.32 - 6469.32] system is a different size than somebody
[6467.08 - 6471.44] else's lymphatic system and your kidneys
[6469.32 - 6473.20] function and squeeze poisons out
[6471.44 - 6475.88] different than somebody else's kidneys
[6473.20 - 6477.48] do and your heart is smaller than
[6475.88 - 6479.36] somebody else's heart and your heart is
[6477.48 - 6480.84] bigger than somebody else's heart and
[6479.36 - 6482.60] keep in mind with this you have
[6480.84 - 6485.00] different toxins and poisons hanging up
[6482.60 - 6487.32] organs your detoxification process isn't
[6485.00 - 6488.92] the traditional madeup term of detox
[6487.32 - 6490.60] pathway yours is going to be different
[6488.92 - 6493.16] than somebody else but what so so has
[6490.60 - 6495.20] done Spirit of compassion has offered is
[6493.16 - 6497.48] it's not one siiz fits all offered
[6495.20 - 6500.04] customizing and allowing the body to
[6497.48 - 6502.88] choose its pathway the way it needs to
[6500.04 - 6504.84] go for you and not just for one size
[6502.88 - 6506.72] fits all and that's the difference so
[6504.84 - 6509.56] when you do like the 28 day cleanse or
[6506.72 - 6512.48] the 369 your body will decide how it's
[6509.56 - 6514.76] going to cleanse properly the way you
[6512.48 - 6516.24] need it done for customizing the way
