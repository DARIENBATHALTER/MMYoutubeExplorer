[92.07 - 95.31] when you're sick with chronic illness
[93.57 - 97.05] and you're trying to get better and you
[95.31 - 98.55] can't move that needle forward and you
[97.05 - 100.35] know and you're stuck in it and you're
[98.55 - 102.45] just in the trenches of it all and then
[100.35 - 104.43] something takes you further along and
[102.45 - 106.26] you finally start experiencing a benefit
[104.43 - 107.70] you start getting better let's say the
[106.26 - 109.83] celery juice is one of the most powerful
[107.70 - 111.45] healing tools out there and when you
[109.83 - 114.87] start moving forward it's life-changing
[111.45 - 116.88] like no other when people are stuck when
[114.87 - 119.13] they're actually really stuck in the
[116.88 - 122.07] trenches of what I call hell basically
[119.13 - 124.17] chronic illness and they finally see the
[122.07 - 125.94] light and that matters that's why I'm
[124.17 - 127.56] here absolutely and I love that energy
[125.94 - 129.81] man because I think you're so right that
[127.56 - 131.22] so many of us today are so stuck and a
[129.81 - 133.53] lot of the time we've tried everything
[131.22 - 135.42] or I hear that a lot with my lens I've
[133.53 - 137.94] tried everything let up into my doctor
[135.42 - 139.74] I've been to this person like I tried my
[137.94 - 140.94] weird thing that my aunt comes up with
[139.74 - 142.32] like you know I've tried all of these
[140.94 - 144.33] things and the thing is it's not like
[142.32 - 146.22] those are bad those are all good things
[144.33 - 148.23] because everybody's got a piece
[146.22 - 149.25] the puzzle you got the best doctors out
[148.23 - 151.02] there you got functional medicine
[149.25 - 152.91] doctors you got alternative guys you got
[151.02 - 154.32] conventional guys girls all of them
[152.91 - 155.70] they're all working hard on their
[154.32 - 157.29] patients and people people have
[155.70 - 159.63] compassion doctors are the most
[157.29 - 161.37] incredible people the compassion to wake
[159.63 - 163.17] up in the morning go to the office and
[161.37 - 165.54] work on person after person after person
[163.17 - 167.54] like they do and hear their stories and
[165.54 - 169.80] hear their cries doctors are
[167.54 - 171.99] unbelievable and the tool there's a lot
[169.80 - 174.30] of good tools out there right but what
[171.99 - 177.03] happens is there's some things people
[174.30 - 179.31] don't even know about yet that that plug
[177.03 - 181.35] into what they're doing say they're
[179.31 - 182.79] doing a keto diet say they're doing a
[181.35 - 184.02] paleo diet say they're doing a vegan
[182.79 - 185.91] diet say they're doing a plant-based
[184.02 - 187.38] diet and they're not getting all the
[185.91 - 189.33] results they need and they're all
[187.38 - 192.12] confused and everybody's flip-flopping
[189.33 - 193.77] from vegan to paleo to paleo to vegan
[192.12 - 195.69] and everybody is all upset but when you
[193.77 - 197.97] plug in something like the celery juice
[195.69 - 200.22] and you know how to use it you can move
[197.97 - 202.53] forward wherever you are you can plug
[200.22 - 204.78] this into what you're doing it's tools
[202.53 - 207.15] like that that literally move the needle
[204.78 - 208.65] and change the lives of millions and
[207.15 - 210.72] right now hundreds of millions are
[208.65 - 213.24] drinking celery juice it's the most
[210.72 - 216.18] powerful healing movement of our time
[213.24 - 218.52] and day and I want everybody to actually
[216.18 - 219.93] be part of it because why miss out what
[218.52 - 221.73] are you gonna do you're not gonna do it
[219.93 - 224.13] you're not gonna part taking something
[221.73 - 226.26] that could change your life so I want
[224.13 - 228.66] everybody to know this isn't one of
[226.26 - 230.64] those scams or forces this is that
[228.66 - 233.19] powerful when you use this herbal
[230.64 - 235.17] medicine something changes inside of us
[233.19 - 237.33] I love that I can't wait to uncover that
[235.17 - 238.68] with you in this podcast and in the life
[237.33 - 240.72] that we're about to do I can't wait to
[238.68 - 242.94] get into all the details but I want to
[240.72 - 244.29] take it backwards slightly short because
[242.94 - 246.06] I want people to understand where you're
[244.29 - 247.47] coming from absolutely and and I want
[246.06 - 249.96] people to understand your background
[247.47 - 252.48] your journey and just behind the mind
[249.96 - 254.07] you know inside the mind of Anthony so I
[252.48 - 256.58] want to go back to you being four years
[254.07 - 259.74] old yeah and you're four years old and
[256.58 - 261.51] you literally without any help any
[259.74 - 264.33] support whatever it is you literally let
[261.51 - 266.46] your grandmother know she's Chik lung
[264.33 - 267.87] cancer she had lung cancer yeah she was
[266.46 - 269.82] symptom free like no one knew it yeah
[267.87 - 270.90] not at all no and then they checked yeah
[269.82 - 272.82] and you were spot on
[270.90 - 274.62] yeah woke up one morning and heard a
[272.82 - 276.30] voice perfectly clear you know people
[274.62 - 279.02] say wait a minute how does he get this
[276.30 - 281.36] advanced medical information
[279.02 - 283.25] that's decades ahead of research in
[281.36 - 285.56] science you know I know scientists
[283.25 - 287.51] I know I know incredible doctors lab
[285.56 - 290.15] technicians and they say his information
[287.51 - 291.98] is advanced whether anybody likes it or
[290.15 - 294.29] not whether the source he hears it from
[291.98 - 297.08] you don't agree with or you're not happy
[294.29 - 299.21] about this voice he hears that he heard
[297.08 - 301.16] it four years old that diagnosed his
[299.21 - 303.77] grandmother a lung cancer and from there
[301.16 - 305.09] on this is all he's ever done and people
[303.77 - 307.34] are like hey you know what I don't know
[305.09 - 309.56] do I trust this and I totally understand
[307.34 - 311.93] I totally get it a guy that hears a
[309.56 - 314.27] voice when you really know the origin of
[311.93 - 316.46] it you know it's hard but when lab
[314.27 - 317.99] technicians and scientists and doctors
[316.46 - 320.45] that are elevated in the field of
[317.99 - 322.73] medicine say his advanced information
[320.45 - 324.23] like epstein-barr causing Hashimoto's
[322.73 - 326.69] thyroiditis he was the first to actually
[324.23 - 328.73] bring that out before they even knew
[326.69 - 330.20] that's what was happening and when they
[328.73 - 332.18] say hey he's advanced with this
[330.20 - 334.07] information and it's about getting
[332.18 - 336.17] people better we got to kick back a
[334.07 - 338.27] little bit we got to calm down and say
[336.17 - 340.25] okay let's listen to this because this
[338.27 - 342.62] is different this is actually really
[340.25 - 344.72] helping people and at four years old
[342.62 - 346.94] that's what happened it was information
[344.72 - 349.55] coming through perfectly clear I heard
[346.94 - 351.83] heard it straight in a voice write to me
[349.55 - 353.78] and it's I've been using that ever since
[351.83 - 357.83] not just my grandmother with that what
[353.78 - 359.90] happened was in 1975 in the fall of 1975
[357.83 - 361.94] had another family and member with a
[359.90 - 364.61] back problem a back problem that
[361.94 - 366.02] wouldn't it wouldn't ease off if the
[364.61 - 367.91] doctors didn't know what was really
[366.02 - 370.37] causing the back problem it wasn't an
[367.91 - 374.06] injury it was an inflammatory condition
[370.37 - 376.28] a mystery back injury or a mystery back
[374.06 - 380.18] inflamed problem where they're suffering
[376.28 - 382.37] they couldn't walk right in late 1975
[380.18 - 384.80] spirit which I call spirit the voice
[382.37 - 387.05] said celery juice this is when it
[384.80 - 389.30] started celery juice for this family
[387.05 - 391.55] member we didn't have really any kind of
[389.30 - 393.74] juicer look look what year it is look
[391.55 - 395.78] what's going on we weren't prepared they
[393.74 - 398.81] had the blender the beat-up old blender
[395.78 - 401.33] we ground up that celery right and we
[398.81 - 403.46] strained it with a cheesecloth and we
[401.33 - 405.62] just strained it out and and a family
[403.46 - 407.90] member was a skeptic about celery juice
[405.62 - 409.88] well what do you mean celery juice drank
[407.90 - 411.64] it and started recovering that night
[409.88 - 413.71] slowly recovering and then
[411.64 - 416.38] the end of the week out of the woods
[413.71 - 418.69] with his back from walking and it's that
[416.38 - 420.88] kind of thing right there and yes the
[418.69 - 421.72] voice tells me what to do so that's what
[420.88 - 423.70] I've done
[421.72 - 426.76] dedicated my life helping people but
[423.70 - 429.82] giving them information that even
[426.76 - 431.98] doctors want to know there are thousands
[429.82 - 433.75] of doctors in this country alone with
[431.98 - 436.66] the medical medium series books in their
[433.75 - 438.49] offices patients have brought them in
[436.66 - 440.53] and they and the doctors art they're
[438.49 - 442.27] smart they read it and say wait a minute
[440.53 - 444.52] this is different
[442.27 - 446.71] whoa wait he's talking about viruses
[444.52 - 447.91] he's talking about pathogens he's
[446.71 - 449.86] talking about things we don't know about
[447.91 - 453.25] viruses and pathogens that's not
[449.86 - 455.50] anywhere and also what to do which is
[453.25 - 457.54] one of the tools the celery juice I love
[455.50 - 459.55] selling stuff online but shipping out
[457.54 - 461.17] takes so much time and cost so much
[459.55 - 463.75] money that it can make the process
[461.17 - 466.30] extremely frustrating but then I found
[463.75 - 468.64] out about shipstation now I can save

[615.43 - 618.40] the studies and the research and the
[616.42 - 620.68] fact that it's worked for people how did
[618.40 - 622.72] you start to trust that voice because I
[620.68 - 624.52] almost feel like that's sometimes harder
[622.72 - 626.20] it's like trust you know oh yeah
[624.52 - 627.88] trusting a voice that's coming too how
[626.20 - 630.07] is that process for you you know what it
[627.88 - 632.50] is is when you when you see it working
[630.07 - 634.45] in front of your own results you know
[632.50 - 636.52] when I was 13 years old and a stock boy
[634.45 - 638.59] in a little grocery store and that voice
[636.52 - 640.48] is telling me you know why someone has
[638.59 - 642.37] diabetes or what's going on or what's
[640.48 - 644.05] happening with them or or the brain
[642.37 - 646.18] tumor that they have or something that's
[644.05 - 647.98] going on and the voice is telling me
[646.18 - 650.92] what's happening inside their bodies and
[647.98 - 653.65] what they need you just you just it you
[650.92 - 654.97] can't avoid it you can't ignore it it's
[653.65 - 656.14] not one of those things you should say
[654.97 - 656.89] well I don't I don't want to do this
[656.14 - 658.54] anymore
[656.89 - 660.94] you know it's not what you're you're in
[658.54 - 663.46] it and you just you go with it and you
[660.94 - 665.14] keep on working you know forward to help
[663.46 - 667.27] people and change and change your lives
[665.14 - 668.62] it's so critical absolutely so let's get
[667.27 - 671.62] on to the cellar do you start
[668.62 - 673.09] discovering the secret behind this like
[671.62 - 674.83] how did you start seeing that it had
[673.09 - 676.48] such a powerful effect how did you first
[674.83 - 678.01] uncover because I think there are just
[676.48 - 679.46] so many vegetables out there you can
[678.01 - 680.69] make so many Juice
[679.46 - 682.58] people have drank probably the wrong
[680.69 - 684.59] juices for such a long time yeah then
[682.58 - 686.03] where did it start all juices are great
[684.59 - 688.46] that's the thing all juicers are great
[686.03 - 689.78] they offer benefits and a lot of people
[688.46 - 692.15] they get confused they say well why
[689.78 - 694.25] would celery juice by itself do anything
[692.15 - 697.88] for you and one of the reasons is it's
[694.25 - 700.49] an herb it's not a vegetable it's an
[697.88 - 702.35] actual herb and herbal medicine is
[700.49 - 704.45] powerful I mean if anybody is listening
[702.35 - 706.91] out here do you like herbs on any level
[704.45 - 708.71] what herbs are your favorite there's so
[706.91 - 709.91] many people that are into any cut
[708.71 - 711.50] they're into herbs that's the whole
[709.91 - 713.18] thing you got Chinese medicine you got
[711.50 - 715.76] air Vedic you got all this herbs are
[713.18 - 717.20] powerful and there's herbalist out there
[715.76 - 719.36] there's doctors out there natural
[717.20 - 720.92] doctors you know and in herbs are a big
[719.36 - 722.78] part of our lives so well why do they do
[720.92 - 725.93] things for us they because they're very
[722.78 - 728.30] healing well celery has been its it no
[725.93 - 729.68] one knew and that's the thing I mean
[728.30 - 732.44] even when I heard it from the voice
[729.68 - 735.53] originally perfectly clear Sellars used
[732.44 - 737.87] the celery it's an herb I was even like
[735.53 - 740.23] wait a minute no it's a celery stick
[737.87 - 743.27] what do you mean this is this is a
[740.23 - 745.25] vegetable that no one cares about and
[743.27 - 747.05] never really cared about and spirits
[745.25 - 749.36] like it's not a vegetable it's an herb
[747.05 - 751.43] it's herbal medicine you extract it in a
[749.36 - 754.43] large quantity and when you do that
[751.43 - 756.14] that's when the miracles happen and then
[754.43 - 758.42] you know someone might say wait a minute
[756.14 - 760.46] you know you have to leave the fiber you
[758.42 - 762.86] have to leave the pulp the juice things
[760.46 - 765.29] not good you're leaving like nutrition
[762.86 - 767.96] behind the fiber and the pulp but what
[765.29 - 770.84] they don't understand is chamomile tea
[767.96 - 772.64] right do you eat the teabag after you've
[770.84 - 774.59] like had camp you go out with a friend
[772.64 - 775.70] right do you cut open that teabag and
[774.59 - 777.77] say wait a minute I got to get this
[775.70 - 779.03] fiber I got to get this pulp here cuz
[777.77 - 781.46] that's where the nutrition is no the
[779.03 - 782.96] medicine comes from the chamomile and
[781.46 - 785.33] that's what you're getting that medicine
[782.96 - 787.01] to relax you to calm you the things that
[785.33 - 788.78] people like same thing with other herbs
[787.01 - 791.12] in herbal teas and so forth of course
[788.78 - 793.55] you can eat some of the herbs but
[791.12 - 796.46] they're better extract at the medicine
[793.55 - 799.37] so it's the power of that this is an
[796.46 - 801.05] herbal tonic and herbal elixir and what
[799.37 - 802.43] you'll see out there's dietitians who
[801.05 - 803.93] are amazing people are nutritionist who
[802.43 - 805.52] are amazing people what they'll do is
[803.93 - 806.99] they'll be confused and be like no no no
[805.52 - 808.49] leave the pulp and fiber
[806.99 - 810.02] Anthony William doesn't know what he's
[808.49 - 810.97] talking about you don't you don't want
[810.02 - 813.49] to just have that
[810.97 - 815.86] they don't know this is herbal medicine
[813.49 - 818.95] you're extracting a large quantity of
[815.86 - 820.27] this incredible mysterious tonic why is
[818.95 - 823.36] it mysterious science the research
[820.27 - 826.42] hasn't looked into what is in celery yet
[823.36 - 828.49] barely any information out there another
[826.42 - 829.09] reason why people don't know but we're
[828.49 - 830.65] getting there
[829.09 - 832.42] we're actually getting there we are
[830.65 - 833.89] getting there and you're leading that
[832.42 - 835.06] movement which I absolutely love like
[833.89 - 837.07] it's incredible like you're really
[835.06 - 838.66] pushing that out there and I think it's
[837.07 - 842.50] so important that we do live in a time
[838.66 - 844.45] where we are allowing unique voices to
[842.50 - 847.18] come to the fore yeah you know maybe in
[844.45 - 849.16] 1975 and years after that people would
[847.18 - 850.74] have been close to these things but now
[849.16 - 853.27] people are seeing also the lack of
[850.74 - 854.77] certain research in certain studies and
[853.27 - 857.14] recognizing that there are alternatives
[854.77 - 859.00] tell me when you started uncoming celery
[857.14 - 860.89] juice what are the key issues that
[859.00 - 862.69] you're seeing celery juice benefit what
[860.89 - 864.40] are the key challenges the people
[862.69 - 866.74] experiencing ottowa mean I know there's
[864.40 - 869.14] a big leap oh my god big Liz big list
[866.74 - 871.12] people dealing with chronic illness what
[869.14 - 874.87] I call chronic illness symptoms that
[871.12 - 876.79] won't alleviate more come constantly or
[874.87 - 879.22] on and off intermittently but they don't
[876.79 - 880.90] go away technically what could that be
[879.22 - 882.88] chronic fatigue syndrome
[880.90 - 886.39] Emme chronic fatigue syndrome right lyme
[882.88 - 889.21] disease multiple sclerosis Hashimoto's
[886.39 - 892.30] thyroiditis lupus these are just some
[889.21 - 894.43] things eczema and psoriasis rosacea
[892.30 - 895.84] different conditions people suffer from
[894.43 - 898.45] and all this acne
[895.84 - 900.22] there's SIBO all of these things you
[898.45 - 902.74] could just keep on going on things that
[900.22 - 904.78] people are plagued with you know and the
[902.74 - 907.21] fatigue is one of them that's a big one
[904.78 - 909.25] when moms can't get out and they can't
[907.21 - 911.20] get out of the house and and run the
[909.25 - 912.43] house and run their careers and take
[911.20 - 914.35] care of their children because they
[912.43 - 916.87] become barely function because a severe
[914.35 - 919.26] brain fog chronic fatigue syndrome and
[916.87 - 921.25] and not have real answers in the
[919.26 - 922.96] fibromyalgia and the rheumatoid
[921.25 - 925.30] arthritis and all these things people
[922.96 - 927.40] suffer with these are the things celery
[925.30 - 929.65] juice starts to move the needle with
[927.40 - 931.54] it's these these things it's different
[929.65 - 933.31] when someone's exercising every day two
[931.54 - 934.90] hours day they feel good they're young
[933.31 - 937.21] they're strong in the moment they
[934.90 - 938.89] haven't gotten sick yet in their lives
[937.21 - 940.18] they haven't been there and they're
[938.89 - 941.32] trying celery juice for a week and
[940.18 - 942.91] they're like I'm not sure what I'm
[941.32 - 943.69] noticing I think there might have been
[942.91 - 946.15] energy I
[943.69 - 948.73] don't know but then you take someone
[946.15 - 951.49] who's been to 50 doctors okay
[948.73 - 953.32] been through hell and back struggled
[951.49 - 955.18] suffered been told they're crazy
[953.32 - 957.31] okay or given three four different
[955.18 - 958.99] diagnoses and then you take somebody
[957.31 - 960.22] like that and they tried everything
[958.99 - 961.57] they've been on every diet they've been
[960.22 - 962.50] to every functional medicine doctor
[961.57 - 964.21] they've been to every single
[962.50 - 967.30] conventional doctor everybody they can
[964.21 - 968.86] under the Sun and then they try celery
[967.30 - 971.08] juice for two weeks three weeks for two
[968.86 - 973.60] months for thirty days for anything for
[971.08 - 975.55] five days and they're like oh my god I'm
[973.60 - 976.96] getting relief for the first time and
[975.55 - 979.33] I've tried everything I have fifty
[976.96 - 981.43] supplements piled up in my house in my
[979.33 - 982.84] cupboards I got all this food I buy
[981.43 - 984.31] everyday from all these different diet
[982.84 - 986.05] plans I talked to all these different
[984.31 - 989.05] doctors I'm online looking for
[986.05 - 990.88] information and celery juice is moving
[989.05 - 993.85] the needle and it's getting me better
[990.88 - 995.56] and that's why it's here there's
[993.85 - 998.62] something really important to understand
[995.56 - 1001.02] here health trends are not propelled
[998.62 - 1003.48] like this this is propelled because
[1001.02 - 1006.17] people are actually healing that's the
[1003.48 - 1010.05] difference this is this is an organic
[1006.17 - 1013.14] movement this is a trend or something
[1010.05 - 1015.93] more powerful above a trend and people
[1013.14 - 1018.69] don't realize this yet they through they
[1015.93 - 1020.64] sayers are too late for the party they
[1018.69 - 1022.02] can complain and cry and say oh there's
[1020.64 - 1025.08] no science behind it
[1022.02 - 1026.61] they well what what else in there's so
[1025.08 - 1027.36] many things there's no someone said
[1026.61 - 1029.22] recently
[1027.36 - 1030.54] well forget celery juice you have to eat
[1029.22 - 1032.04] all the rainbow of the colors where's
[1030.54 - 1033.30] the science proving that if you eat
[1032.04 - 1034.77] every rainbow and the color that you're
[1033.30 - 1037.26] gonna be you're gonna fix your chronic
[1034.77 - 1039.06] illness where's that science there's no
[1037.26 - 1040.80] science on that about what someone
[1039.06 - 1042.33] actually healing a chronic illness
[1040.80 - 1043.65] moving forward because they're eating
[1042.33 - 1044.91] all the rainbows and the colors of
[1043.65 - 1046.38] course you want all the colors in the
[1044.91 - 1048.60] foods and you want all the different
[1046.38 - 1050.58] foods I never said you know that would
[1048.60 - 1053.13] be bad or good or not I said that's
[1050.58 - 1055.02] great but celery juice is a medicine
[1053.13 - 1057.36] that you can bring in to everything
[1055.02 - 1059.97] you're doing and it's really changing
[1057.36 - 1062.01] lives it's incredible I know I keep on
[1059.97 - 1064.50] saying it's only because it's only
[1062.01 - 1066.72] because it actually is working other
[1064.50 - 1069.45] health trends are propelled by other
[1066.72 - 1072.33] things there's tremendous monetary
[1069.45 - 1074.25] behind it like monetary involvement
[1072.33 - 1075.80] pushing that trend so you take all that
[1074.25 - 1078.02] college and of course you
[1075.80 - 1079.67] take all of that whatever it is so you
[1078.02 - 1081.50] take all that apple cider vinegar so you
[1079.67 - 1083.30] take it all there's there's money which
[1081.50 - 1085.13] hey that's just how the world works we
[1083.30 - 1086.51] know that and there's money propelling
[1085.13 - 1089.54] that well you're the only thing
[1086.51 - 1091.16] propelling celery juice is millions of
[1089.54 - 1093.23] people getting benefits and telling
[1091.16 - 1096.17] their story without being prompted or
[1093.23 - 1098.54] paid to do it it's never happened in
[1096.17 - 1100.67] history before and if you don't like
[1098.54 - 1102.92] that idea I don't know what to tell you
[1100.67 - 1105.32] if you don't like the idea of there's no
[1102.92 - 1107.84] science behind celery juice yet you know
[1105.32 - 1110.48] what tell people tell that to someone
[1107.84 - 1113.27] who suffered and struggled push through
[1110.48 - 1115.43] their day and they and they realize see
[1113.27 - 1116.69] when you get sick you realize science
[1115.43 - 1118.61] and research doesn't have the answers
[1116.69 - 1120.35] for chronic illness sure there's
[1118.61 - 1121.76] life-saving medicine out there sure if
[1120.35 - 1123.62] you get into a car accident there's
[1121.76 - 1126.08] life-saving medicine I know incredible
[1123.62 - 1128.30] ER doctors I know amazing surgeons
[1126.08 - 1130.46] actually that do procedures that save
[1128.30 - 1132.53] our lives in different do all kinds of
[1130.46 - 1134.66] different problems we have but let me
[1132.53 - 1136.85] tell you this right here Jay okay when
[1134.66 - 1138.47] you're sick and you're struggling and
[1136.85 - 1141.89] you're suffering and you've been to 20
[1138.47 - 1143.81] doctors okay you realize fast science
[1141.89 - 1146.24] and research dropped the ball somewhere
[1143.81 - 1148.19] where maybe people don't know but they
[1146.24 - 1150.17] dropped it and they dropped it hard
[1148.19 - 1151.70] because people have they people have
[1150.17 - 1153.89] been suffering and struggling there's
[1151.70 - 1155.86] over 250 million Americans in the u.s.
[1153.89 - 1158.33] that have a symptom that won't go away
[1155.86 - 1159.80] getting worse and that's where we're
[1158.33 - 1162.02] heading we're heading into the land of
[1159.80 - 1164.39] the lost getting worse with chronic
[1162.02 - 1166.85] illness and so you've quickly learn
[1164.39 - 1168.53] especially young you're 20 years old 22
[1166.85 - 1170.78] years old you get sick you're 25 years
[1168.53 - 1172.85] old you get sick you quickly learn right
[1170.78 - 1174.62] there science and research isn't what
[1172.85 - 1176.39] everybody was saying it is when it comes
[1174.62 - 1177.95] down to wait I got Lyme disease what do
[1176.39 - 1179.15] you mean is it getting better it's not
[1177.95 - 1180.77] I'm trying this I'm trying to

[1184.82 - 1188.21] you realize science the research doesn't
[1186.41 - 1190.85] know anything about these things so then
[1188.21 - 1192.08] where are we then someone said to me Jay
[1190.85 - 1193.64] they said there's no science and
[1192.08 - 1195.32] research to your information there's no
[1193.64 - 1197.84] science of research - celery juice and
[1195.32 - 1199.49] I'm like oh I didn't know science of
[1197.84 - 1200.96] research fixed every chronic healed
[1199.49 - 1202.88] person I didn't know we have nobody
[1200.96 - 1205.31] suffering I didn't know no one was sick
[1202.88 - 1208.07] and going to 50 doctors and that's the
[1205.31 - 1208.79] world today celery juice is this barrier
[1208.07 - 1209.33] breaker
[1208.79 - 1212.66] it's
[1209.33 - 1214.94] okay get ready because this is one of

[1309.83 - 1315.83] you don't truly know your business we're
[1313.49 - 1317.93] currently growing my business icon media
[1315.83 - 1319.58] but the problem growing businesses have
[1317.93 - 1322.19] that keep them from knowing their

[1374.20 - 1377.68] your profits yeah I loved Anna and I
[1376.30 - 1379.45] agree with you like I think everything
[1377.68 - 1381.34] you just stated there I I agree with the
[1379.45 - 1383.35] fact that science and research is
[1381.34 - 1385.12] measuring that which has happened yeah
[1383.35 - 1386.56] right it's rarely we call it
[1385.12 - 1387.97] breakthrough science but it's not
[1386.56 - 1390.01] breakthrough because it has to watch
[1387.97 - 1391.66] something for a significant amount of
[1390.01 - 1393.82] time or years you know what I mean like
[1391.66 - 1395.11] there is these ideas or these unique
[1393.82 - 1397.15] things that come out they get tested
[1395.11 - 1398.65] over time yeah it's never that you can't
[1397.15 - 1400.06] test something in two seconds and talk
[1398.65 - 1402.40] about it yeah and science the research
[1400.06 - 1404.17] is amazing we need it I'm Holly I'm all
[1402.40 - 1406.18] for it in fact some incredible things do
[1404.17 - 1409.06] happen from it but they're usually
[1406.18 - 1411.07] theories that have to be proven somehow
[1409.06 - 1413.80] correct right and then you have the
[1411.07 - 1415.81] investors behind it to prove it and then
[1413.80 - 1418.12] in the end you don't know we have
[1415.81 - 1420.58] because it changes 10 years later we're
[1418.12 - 1422.05] often wait we were wrong now we have a
[1420.58 - 1424.00] whole bunch of things we're saying now
[1422.05 - 1425.35] this it's this way and that's happened
[1424.00 - 1427.27] so many times really difficult for
[1425.35 - 1430.30] people you know it's incredible I mean
[1427.27 - 1432.79] at the same level I've seen people say
[1430.30 - 1434.71] why drink celery juice you're better off
[1432.79 - 1436.00] just putting a little bit of sea salt or
[1434.71 - 1437.80] a little bit of Himalayan rock salt
[1436.00 - 1440.20] right in your water and it'll do better
[1437.80 - 1441.67] because something because research in
[1440.20 - 1443.14] science doesn't know anything about
[1441.67 - 1444.28] celery juice research and science
[1443.14 - 1446.89] doesn't know anything about putting
[1444.28 - 1449.38] Himalayan sea salt in your water and
[1446.89 - 1450.94] then that's in the same breath they'll
[1449.38 - 1452.65] say something research and science
[1450.94 - 1454.03] hasn't even studied yet either and
[1452.65 - 1456.07] they'll say well make sure you do this
[1454.03 - 1457.45] put salt in your water it's gonna help
[1456.07 - 1459.16] you so much better than celery juice
[1457.45 - 1460.84] because there's no signs behind celery
[1459.16 - 1463.81] juice it's almost like do you know what
[1460.84 - 1465.22] you just said is incredible so oh I
[1463.81 - 1466.75] didn't know there like so much for
[1465.22 - 1468.61] celery juice well you know you know what
[1466.75 - 1469.61] it is is that you could put a lot of
[1468.61 - 1471.71] time on that
[1469.61 - 1473.18] hating on celery juice it doesn't sound
[1471.71 - 1475.34] like the Westing thing when you have
[1473.18 - 1478.19] something this powerful and moving
[1475.34 - 1479.99] forward to this degree and this fast you
[1478.19 - 1481.82] got all the stores selling out what's
[1479.99 - 1485.24] there celery it's all it's all going you
[1481.82 - 1487.58] got farm scrambling to actually grow it
[1485.24 - 1489.50] as fast as they can and then and get
[1487.58 - 1490.94] land up and grow it and grow it you know
[1489.50 - 1492.62] farms don't make any money I mean
[1490.94 - 1494.66] they're all subsidized most of them you
[1492.62 - 1496.52] know how they struggle as it is when you
[1494.66 - 1497.48] see all that people start getting this
[1496.52 - 1499.31] they're getting nervous
[1497.48 - 1501.50] and then when celery juice is helping
[1499.31 - 1504.89] millions of people really fast it I
[1501.50 - 1507.26] think it's a threat in many ways to so
[1504.89 - 1509.57] many industries so ya know there's love
[1507.26 - 1511.79] for celery juice tons of love out there
[1509.57 - 1512.51] but also you got the people saying hey
[1511.79 - 1514.97] wait a minute
[1512.51 - 1516.53] leave your fiber and pulp in there no
[1514.97 - 1518.48] leave your fiber and pulp and all the
[1516.53 - 1521.54] other vegetables and stuff use it but
[1518.48 - 1523.40] this extract it like a medicine right
[1521.54 - 1525.08] tell me about some of the stories that
[1523.40 - 1527.48] you've seen in your life of people
[1525.08 - 1529.01] transformations whether it was frantic
[1527.48 - 1531.29] illness just tell me a couple one or two
[1529.01 - 1533.75] stories or examples where you've really
[1531.29 - 1537.10] seen people who feel transformed through
[1533.75 - 1540.11] sellers use debilitating eczema
[1537.10 - 1542.30] debilitating psoriasis where people
[1540.11 - 1544.40] suffer they can't get it they can't wear
[1542.30 - 1546.53] clothes they can't leave the house
[1544.40 - 1548.93] because they can't preclude thing on
[1546.53 - 1550.61] their skin and they're just doing the
[1548.93 - 1552.14] steroids they've tried the steroids you
[1550.61 - 1554.27] try different things they've seen so
[1552.14 - 1556.31] many doctors they suffer their skin is
[1554.27 - 1559.58] cracking and bleeding everywhere
[1556.31 - 1562.34] and celery juice brought into their
[1559.58 - 1563.84] their lives and used correctly like I
[1562.34 - 1567.74] talked about in the celery juice book
[1563.84 - 1569.36] and it gets them to clear it up they
[1567.74 - 1572.09] start to see benefits
[1569.36 - 1573.77] I mean miraculous case is reversed it's
[1572.09 - 1575.93] it's incredible I'm not just talking
[1573.77 - 1578.66] about it got a little bit better I know
[1575.93 - 1581.93] many cases many of them over the years
[1578.66 - 1584.03] and now today where they get rid of that
[1581.93 - 1585.95] debilitating Aksum a-- where they were
[1584.03 - 1587.87] crying they cried they had to be on
[1585.95 - 1591.35] painkillers they couldn't even move
[1587.87 - 1593.81] their arms and legs and they got through
[1591.35 - 1596.14] it on the other side of it also
[1593.81 - 1598.64] debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome
[1596.14 - 1600.14] fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis getting
[1598.64 - 1601.79] people forward with that people with
[1600.14 - 1602.72] Lyme disease celery juices all of a
[1601.79 - 1604.79] sudden the very thing
[1602.72 - 1606.98] that's now changing everything with
[1604.79 - 1609.62] their diagnosis that they've got or no
[1606.98 - 1611.48] diagnosis where doctors are confused and
[1609.62 - 1613.22] they're just sick and their home and
[1611.48 - 1615.77] they got high anxiety and depression
[1613.22 - 1618.32] I've seen the celery juice do something
[1615.77 - 1621.71] for these people but for decades I've
[1618.32 - 1623.66] seen it before it exploded before the
[1621.71 - 1626.69] publication of the medical medium series
[1623.66 - 1630.05] books in 2015 you know it was already
[1626.69 - 1632.21] building it was a quiet storm I think it
[1630.05 - 1634.16] snuck up on everybody it snuck up on the
[1632.21 - 1636.26] world I think this health trend or
[1634.16 - 1639.02] whatever we want to call it now has
[1636.26 - 1641.51] snuck up in a way and became a tidal
[1639.02 - 1643.58] wave just last year it finally became
[1641.51 - 1645.98] this big tidal wave and I always say to
[1643.58 - 1648.53] people you know what if you learn about
[1645.98 - 1651.02] it now and you know it's it's important
[1648.53 - 1652.58] so yeah and I also think that it's a
[1651.02 - 1654.89] tidal wave for those who are really
[1652.58 - 1657.98] looking and then there is a lot of us
[1654.89 - 1660.41] who are interested but we don't find out
[1657.98 - 1661.73] until someone brings it to the front of
[1660.41 - 1662.84] our minds the front of eyes you know
[1661.73 - 1665.00] what I mean they're gonna do it's like
[1662.84 - 1666.14] until someone really breaks it down for
[1665.00 - 1667.37] you like you have in this book like
[1666.14 - 1670.01] until someone really explains you the
[1667.37 - 1671.24] process of why it works how to take yeah
[1670.01 - 1673.52] like you've done in this book like I
[1671.24 - 1675.47] feel like even then if that doesn't
[1673.52 - 1677.18] happen a lot of these trends just go
[1675.47 - 1678.77] over our heads absolutely right and for
[1677.18 - 1681.02] most people because these trends feel
[1678.77 - 1682.70] like such it's still too hard yeah oh
[1681.02 - 1684.08] it's like a short-term thing like oh I'm
[1682.70 - 1685.70] gonna watch some I watch the video I'm
[1684.08 - 1687.59] gonna try it for a week yeah but I don't
[1685.70 - 1688.76] have a process yeah tell us about the
[1687.59 - 1690.14] process that you outlined in this book
[1688.76 - 1691.25] and how you've made it so simple you
[1690.14 - 1693.23] know there's there's there's a there's
[1691.25 - 1695.21] over a hundred questions always asked
[1693.23 - 1697.13] how do I drink silver juice what do I do
[1695.21 - 1699.74] - I do I put my blender with my other
[1697.13 - 1701.66] food it's all that it has to be by
[1699.74 - 1704.48] itself it has to be by itself in a
[1701.66 - 1706.52] certain amount sixteen ounces is where
[1704.48 - 1709.79] you want to be to start with it's
[1706.52 - 1712.01] sixteen ounces of it jeast fresh very
[1709.79 - 1714.47] fresh very important so you could you
[1712.01 - 1718.16] sit at home fresh okay you can go to a
[1714.47 - 1720.47] juice place I do recommend don't do the
[1718.16 - 1722.09] HPP thing which is high pressure
[1720.47 - 1724.40] pasteurization I mean there's nothing
[1722.09 - 1726.32] wrong with HPP I mean you can do other
[1724.40 - 1728.36] juices that are HPP you go into health
[1726.32 - 1729.65] food stores grocery stores you see all
[1728.36 - 1731.09] those drinks they look like they're
[1729.65 - 1733.16] really fresh they look like they were
[1731.09 - 1734.39] just done yesterday but they got a date
[1733.16 - 1735.50] on them for a couple of weeks because
[1734.39 - 1737.99] it's it's high pressure
[1735.50 - 1739.64] pasteurization now I noticed that that's
[1737.99 - 1741.74] happening with celery juice don't get
[1739.64 - 1743.78] confused by that don't pick that one
[1741.74 - 1746.51] because if you pick that one it's gonna
[1743.78 - 1749.36] be hindered it's gonna lose its its its
[1746.51 - 1750.86] healing benefits his potency exactly you
[1749.36 - 1752.81] want it juice fresh go to your juice
[1750.86 - 1754.55] bars go to health food stores that will
[1752.81 - 1757.01] juice it right in front of you make sure
[1754.55 - 1759.23] it's done right there do it at home and
[1757.01 - 1760.79] that's where the magic happens so there
[1759.23 - 1762.65] is gonna be there there is a confusion
[1760.79 - 1764.21] developing where you may get you get the
[1762.65 - 1765.50] bottled celery juice now sitting on
[1764.21 - 1766.70] there people like well that must be as
[1765.50 - 1768.59] good as everything else and if they're
[1766.70 - 1770.51] not experiencing the benefits they they
[1768.59 - 1772.25] need from drinking it then they get they
[1770.51 - 1774.35] get forwarded by it they get pushed off
[1772.25 - 1776.54] by it yeah so yeah that's just one
[1774.35 - 1777.77] example I answer lots of questions can
[1776.54 - 1779.36] you do while you're pregnant yeah you
[1777.77 - 1781.22] can do celery juice can you do it while
[1779.36 - 1783.59] you're breastfeeding yes so there's just
[1781.22 - 1785.81] so many questions these are just a few
[1783.59 - 1788.15] yeah and asked me consume straight often
[1785.81 - 1789.62] it can't be that yeah you want you can
[1788.15 - 1792.08] wait a little bit you can wait hours
[1789.62 - 1794.42] later you can even wait a day later have
[1792.08 - 1796.10] it in the fridge have in the fridge but
[1794.42 - 1797.54] and that will still be better than say
[1796.10 - 1799.22] something like in the store at high
[1797.54 - 1800.51] pressure pass ratio you know when there
[1799.22 - 1802.85] were two shut with a long show and
[1800.51 - 1805.13] ideally straightaway yeah ideally that's
[1802.85 - 1807.05] gonna have the most fancy yeah and talk
[1805.13 - 1808.67] about what's in it that hasn't been
[1807.05 - 1811.28] discovered yet and if someone says well
[1808.67 - 1813.74] how would he know this voice he hears
[1811.28 - 1816.77] how would I know epstein-barr was the
[1813.74 - 1818.84] cause of thyroid problems and I was the
[1816.77 - 1820.37] guy long before talking about it
[1818.84 - 1821.99] everywhere talking about it the doctors
[1820.37 - 1824.51] talking about it then publishing and
[1821.99 - 1826.28] everything else and and and now they're
[1824.51 - 1828.38] saying hey science research just found
[1826.28 - 1831.65] there's a link to Epstein bar to thyroid
[1828.38 - 1834.47] disease thyroid disorders same thing
[1831.65 - 1836.69] with the celery juice yes I hear the
[1834.47 - 1838.67] information I know what's in it there's
[1836.69 - 1842.03] something called sodium cluster salts
[1838.67 - 1844.31] that's the antiviral that's the that's
[1842.03 - 1847.10] the pote that's the phytochemical
[1844.31 - 1848.66] compound it's this sodium cluster salt
[1847.10 - 1851.21] somebody might say well what is that
[1848.66 - 1853.43] it's a subgroup of sodium undiscovered
[1851.21 - 1855.68] by research in science you think that we
[1853.43 - 1857.81] only have one type of sodium that's it
[1855.68 - 1860.15] on the planet and that's it no there's
[1857.81 - 1861.71] more than that it's a subgroup it's a
[1860.15 - 1863.30] different thing going on in celery it's
[1861.71 - 1864.77] not in anything else they're gonna find
[1863.30 - 1866.69] it down the road they probably won't
[1864.77 - 1868.10] call it sodium cluster salts are not
[1866.69 - 1869.93] going to give me that credit
[1868.10 - 1871.34] not gonna Pat me on the back and be like
[1869.93 - 1873.89] yeah you're they're gonna name it
[1871.34 - 1874.16] something else obviously but that's what
[1873.89 - 1877.01] it is
[1874.16 - 1879.47] it kills bugs here's the deal I'll just
[1877.01 - 1882.59] simplify it people are sick
[1879.47 - 1884.99] because they got bugs that's it
[1882.59 - 1887.60] your your Hashimoto's thyroiditis your
[1884.99 - 1890.03] rheumatoid arthritis bugs cause this
[1887.60 - 1891.68] it's not your body attacking itself it's
[1890.03 - 1894.68] bugs it's pathogens
[1891.68 - 1896.90] that's viruses it's bacteria so when
[1894.68 - 1898.70] people have their fibro there's a bug
[1896.90 - 1900.98] involved that's what this is chronic
[1898.70 - 1903.23] fatigue syndrome there's a bug so what's
[1900.98 - 1904.76] going on is we're filled with bugs I
[1903.23 - 1906.71] know that's kind of annoying we got
[1904.76 - 1909.20] viruses like epstein-barr we got the
[1906.71 - 1911.90] simplex is in us wreaking havoc we got
[1909.20 - 1914.66] the hhv-6 is we have shingles viruses we
[1911.90 - 1916.82] have bacteria and people have these bugs
[1914.66 - 1920.36] in them we live with them they create
[1916.82 - 1921.92] inflammation meanwhile the food Wars
[1920.36 - 1923.93] that are going on the vegans against the
[1921.92 - 1924.92] Palio's and and the keto and everything
[1923.93 - 1926.96] else and everything fighting each other
[1924.92 - 1929.33] but nobody realizes you guys are all
[1926.96 - 1931.07] dealing with Epstein bars dealing with
[1929.33 - 1933.38] strep a caucus you're dealing with strep
[1931.07 - 1935.21] and button different viruses and the
[1933.38 - 1936.74] reason why celery juice is working is
[1935.21 - 1938.78] because the sodium cluster salts and
[1936.74 - 1940.52] celery juice is annihilating a lot of
[1938.78 - 1942.50] bugs and people it's breaking it down
[1940.52 - 1943.97] it's killing them it's cleaning up their
[1942.50 - 1945.20] livers it's getting the bugs out of the
[1943.97 - 1946.94] livers and that's why they're
[1945.20 - 1949.79] inflammation is actually getting better
[1946.94 - 1950.66] and better Wow amazing and I was looking
[1949.79 - 1952.34] at something you were saying about how
[1950.66 - 1954.35] it's blood it's also stopping the
[1952.34 - 1956.06] vicious cycle of addiction yeah yeah
[1954.35 - 1957.95] which is incredible how does that work
[1956.06 - 1959.51] well yeah that seems like a totally
[1957.95 - 1961.19] different challenge in in my head at
[1959.51 - 1962.72] least like from an uninformed point of
[1961.19 - 1964.07] view so how is celery juice even helping
[1962.72 - 1966.38] people with addiction well you know what
[1964.07 - 1967.91] it revives your liver it starts restore
[1966.38 - 1971.27] it your liver can actually hold more
[1967.91 - 1972.86] what's called glycogen glucose because
[1971.27 - 1975.17] that's what it needs to do it needs to
[1972.86 - 1977.45] store glucose and glycogen the very
[1975.17 - 1980.63] thing that we it's the very thing that
[1977.45 - 1982.70] runs our blood sugar throughout our body
[1980.63 - 1984.80] when our blood sugar is in unstable and
[1982.70 - 1988.61] it's imbalance we tend to fall prey to
[1984.80 - 1991.25] addiction really easy plus electrolytes
[1988.61 - 1992.93] we all lack electrolytes so when you eat
[1991.25 - 1994.61] a food of any kind of you drink water
[1992.93 - 1996.38] you get some electrolytes naturally
[1994.61 - 1998.66] occurring any kind of food you eat
[1996.38 - 1999.81] there's a natural occurring electrolyte
[1998.66 - 2002.63] going on there
[1999.81 - 2004.04] well those are pieces you're collecting
[2002.63 - 2005.90] all day long what did you have for
[2004.04 - 2007.31] breakfast there's some electrolytes in
[2005.90 - 2009.44] it what did you have for lunch there's a
[2007.31 - 2011.15] few more electrolytes in it and then
[2009.44 - 2012.95] dinner a few more or during the day
[2011.15 - 2015.68] there's electrolytes in things we're
[2012.95 - 2018.31] consuming but we're never getting enough
[2015.68 - 2020.57] at once we're never getting the whole
[2018.31 - 2023.18] electrolyte the whole lecture like
[2020.57 - 2025.04] family at once right on the neurons
[2023.18 - 2026.99] right with the neurotransmitter
[2025.04 - 2029.30] chemicals using them right all of this
[2026.99 - 2031.64] happening celery juice is like a
[2029.30 - 2033.02] complete electrolyte still undiscovered
[2031.64 - 2035.18] by research and science of course
[2033.02 - 2036.50] research knows that there's antioxidants
[2035.18 - 2038.87] in celery juice of course they know
[2036.50 - 2040.40] there's vitamin A and K in there it's
[2038.87 - 2042.08] funny and I've heard somebody say maybe
[2040.40 - 2044.24] people are getting better because the
[2042.08 - 2046.10] vitamin A and K and I'm like what about
[2044.24 - 2047.87] the vitamin A and K that's in every
[2046.10 - 2049.79] other fruit and vegetable what about all
[2047.87 - 2051.50] of that plus all the supplements people
[2049.79 - 2053.39] are you're still not moving forward why
[2051.50 - 2055.88] is this doing it does it have a
[2053.39 - 2058.01] different vitamin A and K what it does
[2055.88 - 2060.08] have those has a full complete
[2058.01 - 2062.21] electrolyte it goes to the brain fast
[2060.08 - 2064.37] and easy clings on to the neurons
[2062.21 - 2066.68] revives tired dehydrated
[2064.37 - 2068.93] neurotransmitter chemicals start to
[2066.68 - 2070.94] actually bring those back so your
[2068.93 - 2072.20] electrical impulses fire fast so you
[2070.94 - 2073.58] could be quick talking so you can
[2072.20 - 2075.38] actually hear when you can actually
[2073.58 - 2076.91] think what you're saying it all comes
[2075.38 - 2078.92] the brain fog goes away everything
[2076.91 - 2082.28] starts clearing up and those when those
[2078.92 - 2084.11] electrolytes hit those neurons and spark
[2082.28 - 2085.64] that fire and those electrical impulses
[2084.11 - 2089.93] are cruising through those neurons and
[2085.64 - 2091.76] that is precious that is like gold right
[2089.93 - 2093.29] there and that's another reason why
[2091.76 - 2094.58] addiction could stop so you want to
[2093.29 - 2096.20] bring it back to addiction when those
[2094.58 - 2097.97] electrolytes are hitting all those
[2096.20 - 2099.41] neurons your electrical impulses are
[2097.97 - 2101.93] firing and running through those neurons
[2099.41 - 2103.25] and all that's happening and you're
[2101.93 - 2105.35] starting to think clearer and your brain
[2103.25 - 2107.96] fogs back and down you you don't fall
[2105.35 - 2109.91] prey to addiction right there that alone
[2107.96 - 2111.23] there's the blood sugar starts to
[2109.91 - 2113.21] balance out because your liver is
[2111.23 - 2115.19] healing getting better your glucose
[2113.21 - 2117.68] reserves in your in your and your liver
[2115.19 - 2119.24] are storing back up so it can control
[2117.68 - 2120.86] part of the blood sugar problem that we
[2119.24 - 2122.90] deal with because it's not just the
[2120.86 - 2125.15] pancreas and when all that's happening
[2122.90 - 2127.70] you get stronger your mind gets stronger
[2125.15 - 2129.68] your control gets stronger you get you
[2127.70 - 2131.84] know what you take control over your
[2129.68 - 2132.79] life and that's what celery juice if you
[2131.84 - 2134.92] want one
[2132.79 - 2136.87] simple thing for me right there you know
[2134.92 - 2138.64] what use celery juice to help take
[2136.87 - 2140.44] control over your life absolutely
[2138.64 - 2142.39] because it can it can be one of those
[2140.44 - 2145.78] tools I'm not saying it fixes everything
[2142.39 - 2148.48] in anything in one shot I'm not saying
[2145.78 - 2149.38] this is literally the miracle that will
[2148.48 - 2151.69] fix it all
[2149.38 - 2154.03] no because everybody else is doing good
[2151.69 - 2156.88] things this is that thing that pushes it
[2154.03 - 2158.41] over the edge absolutely where you need
[2156.88 - 2161.11] to go and that's why I mean your energy
[2158.41 - 2162.58] and your your love for celery juice is
[2161.11 - 2164.44] infectious and contagious I don't know
[2162.58 - 2167.98] anyone in this room right now who is not
[2164.44 - 2170.26] dedicated at least testing it but but
[2167.98 - 2174.19] tell me about some of the lifestyle and
[2170.26 - 2176.50] diet habits that can cause a conflict or
[2174.19 - 2178.27] negate the amazing benefits of celery
[2176.50 - 2181.66] juice what is it that we're doing in our
[2178.27 - 2183.55] lifestyle or a diet that could slow down
[2181.66 - 2184.63] or go against the benefits of celery all
[2183.55 - 2186.61] right I'll tell you right now
[2184.63 - 2189.16] look I know this is gonna get everybody
[2186.61 - 2192.37] upset okay in the audience but probably
[2189.16 - 2194.17] not everybody but most everybody if you
[2192.37 - 2196.63] if there's something to take out of your
[2194.17 - 2198.97] diet or wherever you stand whatever I'll
[2196.63 - 2201.10] ER on whatever diet belief system you
[2198.97 - 2202.93] are that you're that you're involved
[2201.10 - 2205.33] with subscribe to whatever it is you
[2202.93 - 2207.19] take you need to take eggs out so
[2205.33 - 2209.89] chicken eggs have to come out of your
[2207.19 - 2211.60] diet now I hate to be the breaker of
[2209.89 - 2213.76] this news or the person that has to
[2211.60 - 2215.65] break this news to everybody but what I
[2213.76 - 2217.90] want to tell you is the most important
[2215.65 - 2220.30] part the most important part of this
[2217.90 - 2223.09] podcast probably for anybody to take in
[2220.30 - 2225.40] is we live with these bugs inside of us
[2223.09 - 2227.44] that create all of our illnesses whether
[2225.40 - 2228.94] it's not happening now say we're younger
[2227.44 - 2230.89] but it'll happen later when we're
[2228.94 - 2233.95] turning 40 it'll happen later when we're
[2230.89 - 2235.87] 45 it'll have whatever it is we have
[2233.95 - 2237.85] these bugs and it's like the viruses and
[2235.87 - 2241.45] the bacteria the pathogens that are in
[2237.85 - 2243.67] us eggs feed the pathogens bottom line
[2241.45 - 2245.32] no matter what you believe in out there
[2243.67 - 2247.15] whatever diet system whatever you
[2245.32 - 2248.71] believe in protein and macros whatever
[2247.15 - 2250.12] you're talking about in your life that
[2248.71 - 2251.50] you believe in whether your trainers
[2250.12 - 2254.32] whether your nutritionist whether your
[2251.50 - 2256.12] doctors whatever it is just know that
[2254.32 - 2257.89] when you eat the eggs it feeds the
[2256.12 - 2259.75] pathogens and I hate to break it to
[2257.89 - 2261.79] everybody but pathogens come from
[2259.75 - 2263.86] sources they come from places they come
[2261.79 - 2266.47] from petri dishes they come from labs a
[2263.86 - 2268.75] long time ago and you know how they were
[2266.47 - 2270.82] they were raised by being fed food one
[2268.75 - 2273.37] of the foods that fed them was chicken
[2270.82 - 2276.07] eggs we eat the eggs we feed our viruses
[2273.37 - 2278.17] and we get sicker slowly over time
[2276.07 - 2279.85] celery juice is getting you better
[2278.17 - 2282.52] it's killing pathogens but if you keep
[2279.85 - 2284.41] on feeding your pathogens then it's kind
[2282.52 - 2286.42] of working against you right so that's
[2284.41 - 2288.52] powerful tool right that's it yeah I
[2286.42 - 2291.49] mean I've been in exit 16 years but I
[2288.52 - 2292.99] had no idea that I've never heard anyone
[2291.49 - 2294.94] raise doubt about eggs before yeah well
[2292.99 - 2296.77] you're it's information you're not gonna
[2294.94 - 2298.15] hear anywhere else and that's that's why
[2296.77 - 2300.40] people heal with medical medium
[2298.15 - 2302.98] information is because it's finally new
[2300.40 - 2305.38] information information that is
[2302.98 - 2307.99] different that no one even knew or
[2305.38 - 2309.58] thought about or understood that's and
[2307.99 - 2311.59] that's one of them right there same
[2309.58 - 2313.42] thing with the gluten the gluten or the
[2311.59 - 2316.42] gluten everybody thought gluten was just
[2313.42 - 2318.25] inflammatory nobody knew gluten actually
[2316.42 - 2321.61] is inflammatory because it feeds the
[2318.25 - 2323.59] bugs too I brought that to town was what
[2321.61 - 2325.21] anybody likes that or not I brought that
[2323.59 - 2326.55] and they may say hey well he hears a
[2325.21 - 2329.68] voice oh I don't want that information
[2326.55 - 2331.66] but no guess what they'll find that out
[2329.68 - 2333.01] pretty soon I think even more people are
[2331.66 - 2334.30] talking about it I think doctors are
[2333.01 - 2336.22] talking about it now because I've been
[2334.30 - 2339.04] putting it out there for so many years
[2336.22 - 2340.51] the reason why people get sick on gluten
[2339.04 - 2342.70] and then someone else doesn't get sick
[2340.51 - 2344.08] on gluten because you realize you can be
[2342.70 - 2346.15] 90 years old eating gluten they're all
[2344.08 - 2347.71] your whole life you could be like 50
[2346.15 - 2349.09] years old you've you've eaten it your
[2347.71 - 2351.25] whole life you never had a problem with
[2349.09 - 2355.12] gluten and then someone can't even eat
[2351.25 - 2356.77] it at 16 18 25 and they have to take it
[2355.12 - 2358.78] out because they have certain pathogens
[2356.77 - 2360.22] inside their body they're feeding off of
[2358.78 - 2361.72] gluten itself and then creating
[2360.22 - 2364.03] inflammation it's not the gluten
[2361.72 - 2364.81] creating it so that's why that should be
[2364.03 - 2366.37] out too
[2364.81 - 2368.14] you know you should get that out too but
[2366.37 - 2369.55] there's a reason you should get gluten
[2368.14 - 2371.38] now it's not like oh well he's just
[2369.55 - 2374.44] saying no gluten cuz everybody says that
[2371.38 - 2377.56] no there's a reason I know that reason
[2374.44 - 2378.37] learn about it it'll help you absolutely
[2377.56 - 2381.40] amazing and are there any other
[2378.37 - 2383.62] lifestyle habits that could work against
[2381.40 - 2384.70] this it could work against where people
[2383.62 - 2386.32] are not absolutely what I mean
[2384.70 - 2387.97] absolutely I'm not seeing the benefits
[2386.32 - 2389.56] absolutely it could be you could be toad
[2387.97 - 2391.30] eating something incredible incredible
[2389.56 - 2393.58] no an amazing question thank you for
[2391.30 - 2395.71] asking so here's what you got to be
[2393.58 - 2399.25] concerned about when you're using celery
[2395.71 - 2400.00] juice to not bombard your celery juice
[2399.25 - 2402.25] with food
[2400.00 - 2404.23] too close to it if you're drinking your
[2402.25 - 2406.06] celery juice and it's not an empty
[2404.23 - 2408.52] stomach you're not getting the benefits
[2406.06 - 2410.44] it has to be on an empty stomach 16
[2408.52 - 2412.75] ounces on an empty stomach is critical
[2410.44 - 2414.49] that's what morning is best if you got
[2412.75 - 2416.38] to do the afternoon fine and try to keep
[2414.49 - 2418.39] food away from it so if you any
[2416.38 - 2420.19] lifestyle of eating whatever you have
[2418.39 - 2421.99] dotted with any kind of food lifestyle
[2420.19 - 2423.85] whatsoever you just need that celery
[2421.99 - 2425.92] juice on an empty stomach away from
[2423.85 - 2427.51] those other foods that that right there
[2425.92 - 2428.14] is critical the morning or evening makes
[2427.51 - 2429.91] a difference
[2428.14 - 2431.59] any mornings always best more than that
[2429.91 - 2433.15] empty stomach in the morning that
[2431.59 - 2434.86] hydrochloric acid gets built up
[2433.15 - 2436.63] everything you know and that's another
[2434.86 - 2438.88] part I want to talk about that digestion
[2436.63 - 2440.77] and how the HCL builds up when you're
[2438.88 - 2444.06] drinking celery juice why it builds up
[2440.77 - 2446.59] how the stomach glands receive the the
[2444.06 - 2449.77] celery juice and how they actually
[2446.59 - 2451.36] recharge and give you hot you strong HCl
[2449.77 - 2453.25] hydrochloric acid and then you break
[2451.36 - 2454.96] down your food and your food doesn't rot
[2453.25 - 2456.28] inside of you and you actually get
[2454.96 - 2458.29] strong what your digestion and your
[2456.28 - 2460.36] bloating goes down that's another thing
[2458.29 - 2461.80] too that's really powerful wow that's
[2460.36 - 2464.92] that's super powerful I didn't had no
[2461.80 - 2466.48] idea yeah so with with the with having
[2464.92 - 2468.49] in the morning how long often do you eat
[2466.48 - 2470.92] breakfast okay you know try to give 20
[2468.49 - 2472.87] minutes 20 minutes 20 minutes after the
[2470.92 - 2475.12] celery juice is great okay half an hour
[2472.87 - 2476.65] probably even better you know somewhere
[2475.12 - 2478.57] around 20 minutes to a half an hour I
[2476.65 - 2480.61] like a half an hour really being solid
[2478.57 - 2482.02] like that but if someone needs fuel and
[2480.61 - 2483.46] they're doing something or they're
[2482.02 - 2485.47] running out of the house or whatever I
[2483.46 - 2487.33] totally understand it but try to do
[2485.47 - 2489.43] empty stomach try not to do coffee with
[2487.33 - 2491.08] it try not to put anything in that
[2489.43 - 2493.00] celery juice if you throw apple cider
[2491.08 - 2494.98] vinegar in it you just killed it just
[2493.00 - 2496.66] killed it you know how could you throw
[2494.98 - 2497.95] something else in it I saw somebody out
[2496.66 - 2499.09] there saying I'm gonna put my collagen
[2497.95 - 2500.56] powder in here I'm like you just
[2499.09 - 2502.57] destroyed your celery juice you're not
[2500.56 - 2503.80] gonna see the benefits so you can't yet
[2502.57 - 2505.54] you have to keep it clean
[2503.80 - 2507.55] I'm not multiple times per day just once
[2505.54 - 2509.32] a day no you do the celery juice once a
[2507.55 - 2510.61] day but I like a lot of people that have
[2509.32 - 2513.61] chronic illness do it twice a day
[2510.61 - 2515.56] okay 32 ounces do you know at the
[2513.61 - 2515.94] beginning 16 ounces do 16 ounces the end
[2515.56 - 2518.14] of the day
[2515.94 - 2521.26] absolutely and try not to have it with
[2518.14 - 2523.57] food that's the goal but the truth is
[2521.26 - 2525.67] you get the celery juice in you any way
[2523.57 - 2527.98] you possibly can you're gonna get some
[2525.67 - 2529.81] benefits but these are maximizing it
[2527.98 - 2532.63] this is why the books critical the book
[2529.81 - 2533.38] gives you all the information to how to
[2532.63 - 2534.82] really do
[2533.38 - 2536.38] this right if you think there isn't a
[2534.82 - 2538.12] lot of information to it wait till you
[2536.38 - 2539.98] read the book and then your mind is
[2538.12 - 2542.14] blown and you're just like oh my god I
[2539.98 - 2544.12] can't believe what can be done with
[2542.14 - 2545.83] celery juice including like oral
[2544.12 - 2547.63] therapies and stuff for problems that
[2545.83 - 2549.55] people have like they have you know
[2547.63 - 2552.46] ulcers and all this stuff in their mouth
[2549.55 - 2554.23] and this book is actually explained so
[2552.46 - 2556.60] much and here's the most important part
[2554.23 - 2559.00] I loved about this book is that there's
[2556.60 - 2561.55] almost 200 symptoms and conditions I
[2559.00 - 2563.26] talked about inside this book and what
[2561.55 - 2565.18] southern urges can do for it and why
[2563.26 - 2567.13] it's working so if you have something
[2565.18 - 2569.02] you're suffering with I talked about how
[2567.13 - 2570.28] the celery juice is helping you hmm
[2569.02 - 2572.14] and I loved one of the things I do love
[2570.28 - 2574.75] about the book seeing is I don't think
[2572.14 - 2576.19] there's ever been an audio file that has
[2574.75 - 2577.84] the word celery mentioned more than this
[2576.19 - 2580.03] right now which is awesome which I love
[2577.84 - 2582.04] but what I love about the book is you
[2580.03 - 2584.16] also have a whole chapter dedicated to
[2582.04 - 2586.18] if people can't access celery and
[2584.16 - 2587.59] alternatives that they can take yeah
[2586.18 - 2589.33] which I thought was really refreshing
[2587.59 - 2590.86] yes this is you know it's a book about
[2589.33 - 2592.84] center would you be like hey if you
[2590.86 - 2593.95] can't get it I mean yeah and I don't
[2592.84 - 2595.30] know why people can't get it but maybe
[2593.95 - 2596.68] you can tell me that but if there are
[2595.30 - 2598.54] places people can't access it you
[2596.68 - 2599.92] suggest some alternatives yes share
[2598.54 - 2602.44] those with it yeah absolutely there's no
[2599.92 - 2604.06] way to get celery juice you cannot you
[2602.44 - 2606.82] can't get it it's not even possible or
[2604.06 - 2608.44] just it's just not around and there's
[2606.82 - 2609.85] nothing you can do you know there's
[2608.44 - 2611.92] other things you can do I like the
[2609.85 - 2613.60] cucumber juice it won't do what celery
[2611.92 - 2615.25] juice does I don't want anybody confused
[2613.60 - 2617.08] but it does some different things it
[2615.25 - 2619.15] hydrates the body in a different way
[2617.08 - 2621.40] than anything else could out there you
[2619.15 - 2622.99] know it does hydrate the body it does it
[2621.40 - 2625.21] does things that are really good for us
[2622.99 - 2627.58] it's very cleansing very purifying it
[2625.21 - 2629.23] won't it won't do what celery juice does
[2627.58 - 2630.88] but it could be something you do for a
[2629.23 - 2632.92] week before you can find the celery
[2630.88 - 2634.87] juice again so you know juicing
[2632.92 - 2636.37] cucumbers is actually helpful and so
[2634.87 - 2638.29] when someone said to me recently I said
[2636.37 - 2640.12] okay so what so let's just start juicing
[2638.29 - 2641.95] different things and that's good no no
[2640.12 - 2644.20] no those cucumber juice doesn't kind of
[2641.95 - 2646.72] do it it just isn't but it's it's one of
[2644.20 - 2649.00] those backups to get you by for a little
[2646.72 - 2651.22] bit like a week or a few days and and
[2649.00 - 2653.17] and but that's about it I mean honestly
[2651.22 - 2655.36] it's it's gonna have to be the celery
[2653.17 - 2657.19] juice or it's really in the end no-go
[2655.36 - 2658.84] for what you're really yeah what you're
[2657.19 - 2660.76] really and I know you cover in here but
[2658.84 - 2662.95] I wanted to raise this because I know so
[2660.76 - 2664.03] much not just of my audience but just so
[2662.95 - 2665.02] many people in the world today we're
[2664.03 - 2665.80] reading studies about it all the time
[2665.02 - 2668.56] mental health
[2665.80 - 2671.38] depression anxiety stress what celery
[2668.56 - 2673.48] juice doing on a deeper level for stress
[2671.38 - 2675.64] anxiety and depression well it's the
[2673.48 - 2677.86] ultimate adrenal you know stabilizer
[2675.64 - 2678.88] that's the that's the other thing with
[2677.86 - 2680.65] this celery juice
[2678.88 - 2682.45] I mean it's so helpful yeah you got the
[2680.65 - 2684.22] letter lights got the sodium cluster
[2682.45 - 2686.47] salts you got the heavy electrolytes in
[2684.22 - 2688.39] there and in adrenals need that that's
[2686.47 - 2690.46] so important the other thing is brain
[2688.39 - 2692.17] that that's the other thing when you're
[2690.46 - 2693.79] dealing with electrolytes and and
[2692.17 - 2697.24] neurotransmitter chemicals electrical
[2693.79 - 2699.82] impulses and that's in neurons you're
[2697.24 - 2700.39] talking about distressing because here's
[2699.82 - 2703.39] the deal
[2700.39 - 2707.89] we our brains get dirty toxins in them
[2703.39 - 2710.92] heavy metals mercury aluminum cadmium
[2707.89 - 2712.72] lead nickel copper they get into her
[2710.92 - 2715.36] brain you know someone said to me they
[2712.72 - 2716.65] were like hey I don't have any metal in
[2715.36 - 2717.94] my head what are you talking about he
[2716.65 - 2720.31] said you ever have a fluoride treatment
[2717.94 - 2723.40] did you ever have allergy I had tons of
[2720.31 - 2724.93] those all through my life I go that's a
[2723.40 - 2727.44] byproduct of aluminum right they're
[2724.93 - 2730.78] byproduct of aluminum means it's still
[2727.44 - 2733.09] aluminum it is part aluminum in a
[2730.78 - 2735.34] different form it goes to the brain
[2733.09 - 2736.96] directly so when you have that fluoride
[2735.34 - 2739.12] treatment you're getting aluminum in
[2736.96 - 2740.86] there it's in there has it left no
[2739.12 - 2743.59] there's nothing you're doing in your
[2740.86 - 2745.69] life to remove it we also get mercury in
[2743.59 - 2747.97] the brain really easy we come into this
[2745.69 - 2750.07] world with mercury in us from our
[2747.97 - 2751.87] forefathers and foremothers well that's
[2750.07 - 2754.45] the whole thing our ancestors give us
[2751.87 - 2756.73] mercury it's passed down it doesn't just
[2754.45 - 2758.77] it doesn't leave it gets constantly
[2756.73 - 2761.17] passed down generation to generation to
[2758.77 - 2762.91] generation and it's it's in US and it's
[2761.17 - 2764.53] it's in our brain sits in other places
[2762.91 - 2766.06] and it even could trigger off higher
[2764.53 - 2767.98] anxiety and people it can trigger off
[2766.06 - 2769.63] depression having that mercury having
[2767.98 - 2771.94] those other metals inside of us and we
[2769.63 - 2774.61] collect them here their inner water
[2771.94 - 2777.28] there in other sources we just get it in
[2774.61 - 2780.07] us celery juice helps loosen up those
[2777.28 - 2782.32] metals stop stops them from oxidizing so
[2780.07 - 2784.48] they don't rust in our brain so they
[2782.32 - 2786.49] don't break down our brain tissue or
[2784.48 - 2788.44] glial cells and other parts of our brain
[2786.49 - 2789.97] it's critical it's it's just such a
[2788.44 - 2792.37] critical part of anxiety and depression
[2789.97 - 2794.32] celery just does help with it and I love
[2792.37 - 2797.14] that because we're talking about this
[2794.32 - 2798.55] simple antidote in one sense yeah which
[2797.14 - 2799.48] is actually impact mental and physical
[2798.55 - 2801.67] health you
[2799.48 - 2803.23] which is actually quite rare usually we
[2801.67 - 2804.58] look at them as separate usually it's
[2803.23 - 2806.35] true okay I do this for my body and I'll
[2804.58 - 2807.82] do this for my mind yeah but here you've
[2806.35 - 2809.74] got one thing that's actually helping
[2807.82 - 2811.36] both yeah I've run across so many people
[2809.74 - 2813.13] and seen it throughout the years and you
[2811.36 - 2815.56] see it on the internet now my depression
[2813.13 - 2817.30] is alleviating you know my anxiety is
[2815.56 - 2818.83] getting better things are getting better
[2817.30 - 2821.83] just from doing the celery juice
[2818.83 - 2823.93] crippling anxiety is so debilitating
[2821.83 - 2825.97] people can't leave their houses I've
[2823.93 - 2827.23] seen people suffer so greatly over the
[2825.97 - 2829.63] years you know and when you don't have
[2827.23 - 2831.37] anxiety you may not realize what they're
[2829.63 - 2832.39] going through you may not know what
[2831.37 - 2834.64] they're going through when you don't
[2832.39 - 2836.47] have anxiety because it's hard to like
[2834.64 - 2839.32] get into that person's shoes when you
[2836.47 - 2840.97] don't have it yourself it doesn't really
[2839.32 - 2842.41] make sense what do you mean you have
[2840.97 - 2844.18] anxiety what do you mean you can't
[2842.41 - 2845.62] function like what do you mean you can't
[2844.18 - 2847.54] get out of the house and get in the car
[2845.62 - 2849.82] and you got to take anxiety medications
[2847.54 - 2851.53] because here's a deal when you're when
[2849.82 - 2853.21] you haven't been to a lot of doctors and
[2851.53 - 2855.70] you haven't struggled with your health
[2853.21 - 2857.47] it's hard to get in touch with the ones
[2855.70 - 2858.97] that are struggling it's an entirely
[2857.47 - 2861.49] different crew you know when I get
[2858.97 - 2863.59] interviewed a lot when media interviews
[2861.49 - 2864.94] me and I tell them chronic illness
[2863.59 - 2866.65] people are suffering they're struggling
[2864.94 - 2868.90] they never put that in there ever that's
[2866.65 - 2870.58] why I have tremendous respect for your
[2868.90 - 2872.59] podcast for what we're doing right here
[2870.58 - 2874.63] because I'm able to talk about the ones
[2872.59 - 2876.49] that I fight for every single day so
[2874.63 - 2877.90] that's what I do that's what I do I
[2876.49 - 2880.18] fight for the people who are chronically
[2877.90 - 2881.92] ill and they don't get heard that's the
[2880.18 - 2884.05] thing I've been a messenger for them
[2881.92 - 2885.76] I've been a voice for them all these
[2884.05 - 2887.14] years to the people that are smart
[2885.76 - 2888.85] enough to know science and research
[2887.14 - 2890.71] hasn't had the answers for them and
[2888.85 - 2893.08] doctors know that they haven't had the
[2890.71 - 2894.94] answers that they needed to move forward
[2893.08 - 2896.44] and they suffered it struggled anxiety
[2894.94 - 2899.02] is one of those pieces of it it's
[2896.44 - 2900.76] crippling it can really stop someone
[2899.02 - 2903.79] from enjoying their life not enjoying
[2900.76 - 2906.16] working you know functioning taking care
[2903.79 - 2907.87] of things going to school and you know
[2906.16 - 2909.25] I've seen people hey my anxieties
[2907.87 - 2911.59] starting to alleviate a little bit more
[2909.25 - 2913.63] and it's worth everything it is worth
[2911.59 - 2917.80] even if you knock down that anxiety down
[2913.63 - 2920.03] 50% 25% the difference is someone being
[2917.80 - 2922.28] able to stay out all day or so
[2920.03 - 2924.47] good day in their career or start
[2922.28 - 2926.42] writing or do something with their life
[2924.47 - 2928.40] think about how empowering that is and
[2926.42 - 2930.56] celery juice when that does that for
[2928.40 - 2932.09] somebody with anxiety and you see that
[2930.56 - 2933.53] happen you're like oh my god I'm gonna
[2932.09 - 2935.09] fight for this I'm gonna fight for the
[2933.53 - 2936.71] celery juice I don't care what it takes
[2935.09 - 2938.99] I'm gonna put myself on the firing line
[2936.71 - 2940.94] let's get this stuff out there more and
[2938.99 - 2942.50] more for people absolutely and I love
[2940.94 - 2945.29] what you said that it's really been this
[2942.50 - 2946.37] organic emerging thing like it's
[2945.29 - 2949.07] happening organically it hasn't been
[2946.37 - 2951.05] funded it hasn't had any money put into
[2949.07 - 2953.30] it an investment it's been organic it's
[2951.05 - 2954.83] very first of people which is amazing
[2953.30 - 2956.39] but you've also had organically a lot of
[2954.83 - 2958.04] celebrities and influences reach out to
[2956.39 - 2960.05] you yeah yeah who've become fans of your
[2958.04 - 2961.79] work and supporters of you yeah and you
[2960.05 - 2963.11] know I was I was asked recently too
[2961.79 - 2964.64] about this and he said well what are
[2963.11 - 2968.00] they be what are they being paid to do
[2964.64 - 2969.77] it said there's not one celebrity I know
[2968.00 - 2971.45] I know but it's a really good point
[2969.77 - 2972.98] because people think it they're like
[2971.45 - 2975.05] what are they getting out of this what
[2972.98 - 2976.37] do you mean what are they getting us let
[2975.05 - 2978.35] me tell you something about celebrities
[2976.37 - 2980.30] that I know anyway okay I'm gonna be
[2978.35 - 2982.70] straight out okay they actually care
[2980.30 - 2985.34] about people suffering they actually
[2982.70 - 2987.59] have tremendous compassion they actually
[2985.34 - 2989.48] care about their fans their followers
[2987.59 - 2992.69] they care about people on the planet and
[2989.48 - 2994.40] they really really do it matters them
[2992.69 - 2996.05] they're drinking celery juice it makes
[2994.40 - 2997.82] them feel better and it gets them
[2996.05 - 2998.99] healthier right so they could be a more
[2997.82 - 3001.42] powerful voice in what they're doing
[2998.99 - 3003.94] changing the world but it's it's even
[3001.42 - 3006.25] more than that the celebrities i know
[3003.94 - 3008.50] james van der beek and you know and and
[3006.25 - 3010.45] Jenna Dewan and so many others you know
[3008.50 - 3012.58] and Sly Stallone and so many others they
[3010.45 - 3015.37] care about people they want people to
[3012.58 - 3017.32] feel better it matters to them and if
[3015.37 - 3018.82] they've been through pain - absolutely
[3017.32 - 3020.92] they've been through a lot in their own
[3018.82 - 3023.32] lives all and so when they see people
[3020.92 - 3024.34] you know that are struggling that are
[3023.32 - 3026.14] getting better because they know they're
[3024.34 - 3028.21] spreading that that that information
[3026.14 - 3030.13] about celery juice it matters it matters

[3050.92 - 3053.68] and this podcast has been such an
[3052.48 - 3054.76] education for me
[3053.68 - 3056.41] I hope that everyone listening and
[3054.76 - 3057.43] watching I've been able to ask some of
[3056.41 - 3059.65] those questions that you will be
[3057.43 - 3061.78] thinking about too because I'm coming at
[3059.65 - 3063.55] a point of just learning being a student
[3061.78 - 3065.41] and someone who wants to experiment with
[3063.55 - 3067.78] this so all of my questions have been
[3065.41 - 3069.91] from my own desire to be an experimental
[3067.78 - 3071.47] with this I'm excited to see its impact
[3069.91 - 3073.33] on my life and I'm hoping everyone
[3071.47 - 3074.50] listening and watching today has got
[3073.33 - 3075.49] some of the information to get you going
[3074.50 - 3076.96] but I really really hope that you're
[3075.49 - 3078.40] gonna go and get the book because the
[3076.96 - 3080.02] books gonna break it down for you
[3078.40 - 3083.08] yeah the books gonna stop you from doing
[3080.02 - 3085.30] a one-week test which is a fad to
[3083.08 - 3086.50] actually making it sustainable and one
[3085.30 - 3088.18] of the biggest reasons I see the
[3086.50 - 3089.50] difference between us having a habit
[3088.18 - 3091.45] that we do for one week versus
[3089.50 - 3093.67] sustainable is one we're deeply
[3091.45 - 3094.93] convinced of the reasons when you've sat
[3093.67 - 3096.28] here and you've read this book and after
[3094.93 - 3098.83] you've read this book if you haven't got
[3096.28 - 3101.05] every reason you need to go and drink
[3098.83 - 3102.64] celery juice the rest of your life then
[3101.05 - 3103.75] that will be harder to give up yeah
[3102.64 - 3105.16] whereas if you just think oh yeah I'm
[3103.75 - 3107.02] gonna try this this is cool juice
[3105.16 - 3107.83] podcast I loved it and you can try
[3107.02 - 3109.30] you're gonna try it for a week and
[3107.83 - 3110.76] you're gonna start yeah so take my
[3109.30 - 3113.32] recommendation go get the book get the
[3110.76 - 3116.11] deeper reasons and insights on how to
[3113.32 - 3117.88] take it why to take it and and what to
[3116.11 - 3119.32] do with your life around it to support
[3117.88 - 3121.48] it and that will start making the
[3119.32 - 3123.88] biggest difference is I feel I feel so
[3121.48 - 3125.38] we're gonna end this episode with the
[3123.88 - 3127.66] final five these are final five
[3125.38 - 3130.84] questions usually answers are either one
[3127.66 - 3133.24] word or one sentence maximum so this is
[3130.84 - 3135.04] gonna be a big challenge for Anthony
[3133.24 - 3137.05] because he's sorry what I love about you
[3135.04 - 3139.75] just have so much to say but it's all
[3137.05 - 3142.06] like it's it's all in depth like it's
[3139.75 - 3145.17] real your insights are awesome so I'm
[3142.06 - 3147.97] gonna try and get you to one word or one
[3145.17 - 3150.12] so question number one is what's the
[3147.97 - 3152.29] biggest health myth you've ever heard
[3150.12 - 3157.63] there's so many of them tell us your
[3152.29 - 3161.01] favorite one alright metabolism okay god
[3157.63 - 3161.01] yeah I'm gonna let you tell me
[3162.00 - 3166.36] metabolism just means that were alive
[3164.47 - 3168.31] the discovery of metabolism just means
[3166.36 - 3170.68] that we're alive we're living we have
[3168.31 - 3174.12] blood throwing flowing through us okay
[3170.68 - 3176.44] and that no one really knew that really
[3174.12 - 3179.17] metabolism was just the discovery of hey
[3176.44 - 3181.72] you're you're eating you're burning fuel
[3179.17 - 3185.26] you're a living organism you're a living
[3181.72 - 3187.54] being right but it's not why people gain
[3185.26 - 3189.85] weight slow metabolism
[3187.54 - 3192.52] and that's one of the greatest myths out
[3189.85 - 3194.86] there they're gaining weight from livers
[3192.52 - 3197.17] that are stagnant and sluggish
[3194.86 - 3199.15] everybody's livers are bombarded they're
[3197.17 - 3201.34] toxic that's why I came out with liver
[3199.15 - 3203.38] rescue the book because their livers are
[3201.34 - 3205.75] challenged and they're filled with
[3203.38 - 3208.12] toxins and that's what puts the weight
[3205.75 - 3210.10] on that's what makes things get the
[3208.12 - 3212.65] lymphatic system gets swollen with water
[3210.10 - 3215.71] the weight comes on the belly fat it's
[3212.65 - 3217.81] from a liver of weak liver sick liver
[3215.71 - 3219.85] stagnant sluggish liver it's not from
[3217.81 - 3221.53] metabolism still to this day I'm sure
[3219.85 - 3223.54] everybody in the audience right now my
[3221.53 - 3225.55] god who's been totally just fed met
[3223.54 - 3227.17] metabolism metabolism for the last 30 40
[3225.55 - 3229.09] 50 whatever it is they're just gonna be
[3227.17 - 3230.62] all upset but I just trying to drop the
[3229.09 - 3232.15] truth on you on that one it's a liver
[3230.62 - 3234.10] you take care of your liver and that's
[3232.15 - 3236.05] that you take care of that and then
[3234.10 - 3238.03] everything starts getting better with
[3236.05 - 3239.56] whey and what we think is metabolism
[3238.03 - 3240.94] problems amazing yeah you're going to
[3239.56 - 3243.01] the root I like you okay question number
[3240.94 - 3243.58] two if you could give everyone in the
[3243.01 - 3246.16] world
[3243.58 - 3247.63] I have it to do for 30 days apart from
[3246.16 - 3249.49] drinking celery juice every day what
[3247.63 - 3251.74] would it be that the heavy-metal detox
[3249.49 - 3254.77] movie I offer okay get the nettles out
[3251.74 - 3257.02] get them out of the body that's the key
[3254.77 - 3258.82] I mean okay there's so many different
[3257.02 - 3260.35] habits you can do I get it there's so
[3258.82 - 3263.08] many for your consciousness so much for
[3260.35 - 3265.06] your just mental so much different
[3263.08 - 3267.61] physical ones you can do but getting
[3265.06 - 3269.95] metals out that's the habit right there
[3267.61 - 3272.35] get some cilantro in you you know get
[3269.95 - 3274.48] some get some spirulina in you know the
[3272.35 - 3276.19] right ones the ones I care about because
[3274.48 - 3278.35] those are the ones that actually work
[3276.19 - 3280.45] you know get some things in you pull
[3278.35 - 3282.91] them metals out I talked about it the
[3280.45 - 3283.69] heavy metal detox smoothie that's the
[3282.91 - 3286.36] one right there
[3283.69 - 3288.28] you pull metals out things change too
[3286.36 - 3290.29] it's like it's like the celery juice the
[3288.28 - 3292.24] heavy-metal detox smoothie get into that
[3290.29 - 3294.34] habit get into the hey look get into the
[3292.24 - 3295.63] celery juice happen there you go awesome
[3294.34 - 3299.40] question number three what are the top
[3295.63 - 3299.40] three things on your grocery list
[3300.00 - 3304.81] celery's okay that's a given right yeah
[3302.26 - 3306.79] that's a given okay another one wild
[3304.81 - 3309.31] blueberries okay that's the second one
[3306.79 - 3311.50] right there because wild blueberries the
[3309.31 - 3314.26] antioxidants that's a whole nother food
[3311.50 - 3316.21] wild versus cultivated blueberry that
[3314.26 - 3318.76] the one in the clam shell the pint-sized
[3316.21 - 3320.22] clam shell that is the cultivated
[3318.76 - 3322.71] blueberries the big blueberry
[3320.22 - 3325.14] it doesn't do a fraction of what the
[3322.71 - 3327.45] frozen while the blueberry you go into
[3325.14 - 3329.19] the freezer section and you go in there
[3327.45 - 3330.90] you'll see different brands I mean I use
[3329.19 - 3332.49] the Wyman's one there's another brand
[3330.90 - 3334.08] that's there use that there's different
[3332.49 - 3336.30] brands but you get the frozen wild
[3334.08 - 3339.09] blueberries that's the my god.that food
[3336.30 - 3341.34] so celery that and I love apples okay
[3339.09 - 3342.87] got to be a must yeah yeah yeah give me
[3341.34 - 3345.69] another one let's have one more thing is
[3342.87 - 3349.70] it alright papaya
[3345.69 - 3352.68] okay that's another one and then wash
[3349.70 - 3355.50] okay people call it ma che but Maj it's
[3352.68 - 3357.12] a green it's an amazing green there's
[3355.50 - 3358.89] not enough of it out there but you can
[3357.12 - 3361.29] find it go to the health food store that
[3358.89 - 3363.45] green is great leafy greens are good
[3361.29 - 3365.31] awesome okay question four tell us about
[3363.45 - 3366.75] the top three herbs that you couldn't
[3365.31 - 3368.82] live with that lemon balm can't live
[3366.75 - 3370.77] without it helps the neurological system
[3368.82 - 3372.84] I've used it to actually help people
[3370.77 - 3375.54] with anxiety depression of course but
[3372.84 - 3380.40] also with neurological problems tics
[3375.54 - 3382.62] spasms tingles numbness its antiviral
[3380.40 - 3384.75] too like celery juice when you bring
[3382.62 - 3387.33] that lemon balm in there it's a big deal
[3384.75 - 3388.59] that one nettle leaf another incredible
[3387.33 - 3389.94] herb without a doubt I've been
[3388.59 - 3391.68] recommending it since I was a kid
[3389.94 - 3394.20] because of spirits it's literally is
[3391.68 - 3396.45] right off the start recommending it so
[3394.20 - 3399.09] nettle leaf that's anti-inflammatory of
[3396.45 - 3401.61] course why it also is antiviral in its
[3399.09 - 3404.22] own right great medicine and of course
[3401.61 - 3406.47] cook immuno to tumeric you know which is
[3404.22 - 3408.24] spice wouldn't arise them but tumeric
[3406.47 - 3410.04] it's in it's amazing so I like that
[3408.24 - 3411.96] won't even know it's you know but you
[3410.04 - 3413.85] got the yeah lemon balm nettle leaf and
[3411.96 - 3416.70] then licorice roots another one amazing
[3413.85 - 3419.31] and the final five question five what's
[3416.70 - 3421.65] the best way we can all start listening
[3419.31 - 3424.29] to our body more because I think for so
[3421.65 - 3426.30] many of us we are constant radical but
[3424.29 - 3429.00] changes right we're constantly just like
[3426.30 - 3430.98] you could be going through pain and deal
[3429.00 - 3432.54] and just having it there and sit there
[3430.98 - 3433.98] for so long without listening how do how
[3432.54 - 3435.93] do people people we may not all be able
[3433.98 - 3437.25] to listen to spirits or channel or learn
[3435.93 - 3439.26] but how can we listen to our bodies
[3437.25 - 3441.33] better there's one thing that people
[3439.26 - 3443.58] have to realize it's one of the most
[3441.33 - 3446.61] incredible ones that when we get sick
[3443.58 - 3449.01] it's not our body letting us down it's
[3446.61 - 3451.18] not our bodies being faulty it's not our
[3449.01 - 3454.22] body being a bad
[3451.18 - 3457.19] physical you know aspect of us it's not
[3454.22 - 3459.91] it's it's not our body giving up on us
[3457.19 - 3462.80] and most importantly it's not our body
[3459.91 - 3464.75] destroying us or going after immune
[3462.80 - 3466.73] system or going after our organs or
[3464.75 - 3469.31] going after anything what I'm trying to
[3466.73 - 3471.44] say is your body doesn't hurt you it
[3469.31 - 3474.92] doesn't destroy you it doesn't go after
[3471.44 - 3477.32] anything and we need to know that our
[3474.92 - 3479.30] body never attacks itself and it's the
[3477.32 - 3481.94] first thing everybody thinks they think
[3479.30 - 3482.57] their body's failing so no matter what
[3481.94 - 3485.03] okay
[3482.57 - 3487.37] there's one of the greatest tools is if
[3485.03 - 3490.67] you start experiencing anything mental
[3487.37 - 3493.52] emotional physical your body is not
[3490.67 - 3495.71] going after you are hurting you or
[3493.52 - 3497.90] attacking you that's the most important
[3495.71 - 3499.43] that can protect you because we can't
[3497.90 - 3501.29] there's there's people out there you can
[3499.43 - 3503.21] tell them what what to do on how to
[3501.29 - 3505.37] listen to their body or anything but
[3503.21 - 3506.87] they might they might not be able to do
[3505.37 - 3508.91] it or they might be too busy or forget
[3506.87 - 3510.92] it but what they will do is their body's
[3508.91 - 3512.72] letting them down the minute as an
[3510.92 - 3515.60] athlete you think your body's failing
[3512.72 - 3518.00] you anything it's just in life when
[3515.60 - 3520.46] we're sick we think our body has now
[3518.00 - 3522.50] said hey we're not helping you I'm not
[3520.46 - 3524.06] helping you and that's it if you could
[3522.50 - 3526.19] if you know your body loves you
[3524.06 - 3528.29] unconditionally it's there for you it's
[3526.19 - 3531.26] fighting for you in ways you cannot even
[3528.29 - 3533.69] imagine that can bring you peace and get
[3531.26 - 3535.34] you to where you need to be faster and
[3533.69 - 3537.20] better well I was not expecting that
[3535.34 - 3538.97] once but I love Don so that that
[3537.20 - 3540.80] judgment that we place on our body
[3538.97 - 3542.57] immediately is actually one of the most
[3540.80 - 3545.15] negative things it is like that Lang the
[3542.57 - 3546.89] most that language around am i he's
[3545.15 - 3548.90] attacking me my body's letting me down
[3546.89 - 3549.59] my body's failing yes my body's not
[3548.90 - 3551.15] strong enough
[3549.59 - 3553.55] yes that language is actually
[3551.15 - 3555.29] programming us to lead to not doing
[3553.55 - 3558.05] anything about see it's an evil seed
[3555.29 - 3559.31] that sits inside every human being so no
[3558.05 - 3560.60] matter what you're doing whether you're
[3559.31 - 3562.10] meditating on top of the mountain
[3560.60 - 3565.01] wherever you are it doesn't matter the
[3562.10 - 3567.89] minute something's going wrong you go
[3565.01 - 3569.69] right to my body is now wait a minute
[3567.89 - 3571.16] turning against me in the moment and
[3569.69 - 3573.83] what do I need to do to fix it no it's
[3571.16 - 3575.51] not turning against you that's how it
[3573.83 - 3577.13] works that is such an awesome once man I
[3575.51 - 3579.11] absolutely love that I hope that message
[3577.13 - 3580.88] is resonating very very clear the way we
[3579.11 - 3584.24] think about a body talk about our body
[3580.88 - 3584.91] talk to our body itself is gonna have a
[3584.24 - 3586.62] huge impact

[3634.38 - 3639.21] through pain and that's how it was for
[3636.39 - 3640.98] me too I think because I'd I felt like
[3639.21 - 3644.13] I'd mastered my mind and neglected my
[3640.98 - 3646.74] body yeah and so when my body started to
[3644.13 - 3648.90] give me signs that it needed more love
[3646.74 - 3650.16] and care that's when I started to
[3648.90 - 3652.08] realize because while you're young you
