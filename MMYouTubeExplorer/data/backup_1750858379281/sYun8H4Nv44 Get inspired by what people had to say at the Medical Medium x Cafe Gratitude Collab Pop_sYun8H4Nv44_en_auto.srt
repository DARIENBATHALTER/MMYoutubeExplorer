1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,879
I wanted the opportunity to meet people

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,359
who were going through their own healing

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,080
Journeys in the four years I've been

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,920
doing this I have seen so much healing

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,599
for the people who actually apply it and

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,000
keep going with it at the beginning of

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,320
my journey I can only drink a little

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,680
shot gloss of celery juice and now I'm

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,439
up to 32 o a day really just keep going

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,519
you know if you started and you're

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,640
doubting uh that's you know negativity

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,160
trying to pull you off your healing path

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,359
try it your body will start to thve and

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,360
you'll see a difference that gives you

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,280
the hope to keep going don't give up

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,280

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,280
