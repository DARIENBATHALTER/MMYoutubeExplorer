good stuff we got to celery juice right

53
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,259
here we're doing I think the bottom line

54
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,479
is is that you and I feel the same we

55
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,880
feel the same way chronic illness is

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,030
growing at an all-time high

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,700
okay all-time high science and research

58
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,730
can't keep up with it it just can't they

59
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,750
can't keep up with it and more than not

60
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,730
keeping up with it

61
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,300
it is

62
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,930
chronic diseases as if they were acute

63
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,080
problems

64
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,049
Yesi for acute problems like a broken

65
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,819
bone a burst appendix a heart attack an

66
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:28,040
ongoing heart attack there's nothing

67
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:29,989
better than modern science yeah I agree

68
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,440
but the problems that humanity is

69
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,730
suffering from are not mostly acute 90%

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,280
of the problems of humanity suffering

71
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:40,099
from a chronic product yeah and they do

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,349
not respond to surgery and medications

73
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,840
the way that acute problems yeah so we

74
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,459
are not really treating the the chronic

75
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,590
problems we were just killing the

76
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,410
symptoms yeah you know that's we you

77
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,180
know what's amazing about that is is

78
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:56,329
until somebody gets sick with a chronic

79
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,519
condition with symptoms they have and

80
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:00,260
they're not getting better and they're

81
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,269
going to neurologist right you've seen

82
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,859
this I mean come on how many times I've

83
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:07,430
something arrives I mean you're a doctor

84
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:08,660
I've seen myself yeah I got seven

85
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,599
prescription medications for health

86
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,190
issues that I was suffering from and it

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,170
didn't make sense for me so I've looked

88
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,030
for a different solution yeah and that

89
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:25,609
took me to discover the power of what we

90
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:27,650
eat and the power of herbs yeah and so

91
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:29,030
the whole thing is it's like you know

92
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,590
when people are dealing with exactly

93
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,239
there's chronic symptoms are going to

94
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,950
neurologist and they're going to another

95
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,239
doctor then go another doctor and then

96
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,220
they're going in all these different

97
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,769
places and the whole life is based on

98
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,590
doctor appointments and science and

99
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,630
research it's great for nuts and bolts

100
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,430
right I call it nuts and bolts you got a

101
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,139
gallbladder because we don't take care

102
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,269
of herself and we got an infection in

103
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,430
the gallbladder and it's got to come out

104
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,470
you want a good surgeon you want a good

105
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,120
doctor you get heart problems you want a

106
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,889
good heart doctor I mean that's what you

107
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,079
are a heart doctor and you know and in

108
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:02,450
an internist internal medicine doctor to

109
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,730
all of that and you know you want that

110
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,440
but but then what about all the other

111
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,940
people because that's why you became an

112
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,590
expert about chronic illness because

113
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,599
what about all the other people that

114
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,540
they can't get answers for all the

115
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,329
problems they have with modern medicine

116
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,049
is with chronic diseases in approaching

117
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:23,330
chronic diseases is that we do not look

118
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:26,320
for the root cause of the problem yeah

119
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,200
we just very concentrated in

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,120
cutting and and and pieces off and

121
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,490
giving medications just to calm the

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,100
symptoms right but the root problem

123
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,100
cause of the problems is not what modern

124
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,710
Western medicine is the best at yeah or

125
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,140
gives any attention to the reason there

126
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,210
is a big growing movement which is

127
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,550
called functional medicine that that

128
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,990
yeah that is what happens to modern

129
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,940
medicine doctors when they start

130
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,100
thinking like Ayurvedic or Chinese

131
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,230
medicine doctors right and these are the

132
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,910
doctors that are more interested in

133
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,890
growth then they're more open to what

134
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,260
could be wrong yeah what's happening

135
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,720
inside the body how deep is the problem

136
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,690
you know and that matters I mean back in

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,430
the day you know back in the day like

138
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,130
you know you've been a doctor for a long

139
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,890
time okay so you mean you got experience

140
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,500
and new doctors that come out of school

141
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,740
fresh out of school and they just don't

142
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,880
know a fraction of what you know because

143
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,020
it takes that history sick people

144
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,850
science and research doesn't have the

145
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,710
answers for aches and pains tangles and

146
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,380
numbness vertigo yeah eight you know

147
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,240

149
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,070
of this and all these different things

150
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,590
in the foggy head the brain fog right

151
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,690
and the floaters in the eyes and then

152
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,820
the fatigue and all that fatigue you

153
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,190
come out of school and then all that

154
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,380
what is what the hell is all that like

155
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,600
what is all that right I mean the doctor

156
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,340
said well you got the history you know

157
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,380
you got that long-standing history that

158
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,690
there needs to be more figured out to

159
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,880
help people you know and it's doctors

160
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,740
like you that you know they're rare

161
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,930
there's not a lot of doctors like you

162
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,210
out there that says you know what I'm

163
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,980
gonna you know what I'm an expert at

164
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,170
cardiology I'm an expert at these things

165
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,810
in the field but you know what people

166
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,310
are suffering you know he has compassion

167
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,960
you know when I met you you could tell

168
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,760
the story when I met you but he's a

169
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,920
compassionate man he's a compassionate

170
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,900
man about people suffering I don't see

171
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,420
that too often I know doctors are

172
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,610
compassionate they have to be but but it

173
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,800
takes it to a new level with him because

174
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,360
he actually really cares he said you

175
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,580
know he said I remember when I first met

176
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,200
you you said that science the research

177
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,180
doesn't have all the answers okay

178
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,169
because people are they're sick out

179
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,719
there

180
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,729
and we need to do something about it you

181
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:45,219
were just looking on this remember you

182
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:47,949
said I'm gonna dedicate my life that I

183
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:51,490
met Anthony at a party for one of my

184
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,439
book launch what in like 2009 2009 yeah

185
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,509
it doesn't not longer than eight or nine

186
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,029
okay and somebody brought in to me

187
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:00,699
because people that are that I that I

188
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:03,099
know intimately know that I am a healer

189
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:04,599
Ruby some people are rock star groupies

190
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:06,969
in there for a rock star I follow

191
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,199
either's true healers right so they

192
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:12,789
introduced me to him and they told me

193
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:14,469
his story and I you know always even

194
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,020
though I believe and I know that

195
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:20,129
miracles exist and the spirit exists and

196
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,629
and that it communicates with us I am

197
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,050
initially a skeptic until proven

198
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:25,870
otherwise

199
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:29,050
ya know you're you're a hard man but I

200
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,210
like this come from science that's the

201
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:36,129
whole point so if it's gotta convince

202
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:38,110
you it better be good because I like to

203
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:41,469
look in your eyes and I knew that at

204
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,020
least you believed what you told me you

205
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:47,050
were not faking stuff right now it was

206
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:51,279
then up to me to see if what you believe

207
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:54,219
had something to do with a few months

208
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:58,029
later I got a really big scare right I

209
00:07:54,219 --> 00:08:00,639
was having labor pains like really

210
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:03,189
intense labor pains and I decided to

211
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,889
give the medical medium a try so I

212
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:08,020
called you and you said to me and I was

213
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,960
already scheduled for the next day for a

214
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,620
biopsy of my liver and I called you and

215
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,779
you said first of all your liver has no

216
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,509
problem you have an old cyst that you

217
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:21,789
were born with and the reason and the

218
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,710
reason that you are having pains has

219
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,490
nothing to do the cysts so when they

220
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:32,709
find the cyst

221
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:35,199
don't worry about it so so and he put me

222
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:37,539
on cats go if the cat's a cloth for the

223
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:38,860
liver powerful what else need live

224
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,050
around spirulina

225
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,969
abundance of spirulina I put you on Mull

226
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,890
and leaf because more than that wasn't

227
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,110
the immune system of your liver to get

228
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,160
stronger yeah and and and to be

229
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,170
protective because your livers have

230
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,330
immediately I ordered everything he put

231
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,860
me on and the next day I went to have a

232
00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:01,380
biopsy and the results of the biopsy

233
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,810
were not a biopsy yeah yeah sonogram I

234
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,910
had about two of my lymph nodes and in a

235
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,010
sonogram and a cat scan of my liver and

236
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,500
basically they told me exactly that that

237
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,209
I had a cyst they didn't want to touch

238
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,830
it because they didn't think that was

239
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:15,660
part of the problem yeah and then I

240
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,940
received the next day all the things

241
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,870
that you ordered and then four days

242
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:25,350
later I had no more pain and then I

243
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,390
started sending my well I consulted you

244
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,279
about my kids I consulted you about my

245
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,580
family I love how many members and then

246
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:37,910
I started sending patients to you and

247
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:40,560
like everybody had some benefit if not

248
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,630
incredible benefit by seeing you want to

249
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,850
follow your advice one more you know and

250
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,010
and the thing is is is with you though

251
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,070
when you when you know when I tell you

252
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,110
hey Doc you gotta do this you gotta keep

253
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,910
that you just you just do it you just do

254
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,770
it you just said I'll go get what what

255
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,740
do you need me to do immediately

256
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:02,910
immediately you know and and because you

257
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:06,630
believe that herbs you believe that food

258
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,310
does heal and it does heal certain parts

259
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,900
of her body survive it because you have

260
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,060
that belief doctors didn't have that

261
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,580
years ago you know when I you know it's

262
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,610
a new thing now the doctors think food

263
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,070
helps yeah I mean I mean I'm thirty

264
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,020
years into this or more helping people

265
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,790
out all these years and I tooked a lot

266
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,320
of doctors over the years I've talked to

267
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,180
angry doctors because they didn't

268
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,130
believe no no garlic can't help with

269
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,529
anything you can't you know you can't

270
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,180
use garlic for the flu you can't use God

271
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:36,360
you can't use this and now they just

272
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,790
don't have any any faith my father was

273
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,180
from Hungary

274
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:45,420
used to tell me that garlic kept away

275
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:49,040
the bad spirits right ya know I always

276
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,040
knew that garlic was really it was

277
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,240
really believe that nature did not

278
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,520
design human body to get sick just like

279
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,350
it didn't design anybody to get sick any

280
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,390
animal animals in the wild don't get

281
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,180
sick I love animals that live in the way

282
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,100
that nature designed them to it in in

283
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,320
the places in which nature designed them

284
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,810
to live and eat what nature designed

285
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,760
them to eat do not get sick okay we are

286
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,730
the animals and and the cats and dogs

287
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,000
that live close to us yes we get sick no

288
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,640
yes no nature did not design humans or

289
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,060
anything to get sick the sicknesses are

290
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,480
just adaptation and survival mechanisms

291
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,340
right and when we discover what the

292
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,770
obstacles are and we remove the

293
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,990
obstacles and then we add whatever is

294
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,630
lacking everything corrects by itself

295
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,820
you know it falls into exactly what I've

296
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,850
been teaching from my information my

297
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,430
source that you got to get rid of toxins

298
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,790
you gotta get rid of toxins you got to

299
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:52,150
get rid of bugs bugs toxins I always say

300
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:54,250
that and and bugs feed off of toxins

301
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,380
like heavy metals we're going to talk

302
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,180
about heavy metals I got a little bit of

303
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,680
a heavy metal detox movie right here so

304
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,170
the medical medium heavy metal defense

305
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,210
movie right there and you know bugs like

306
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,090
the feed off of mercury they like the

307
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:10,540
feed off of aluminum land arsenic copper

308
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:13,180
and even more these heavy metals they

309
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,820
depress you a new system so bugs can

310
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,530
take over right otherwise sometimes we

311
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,050
have the ability to kill all this and

312
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,640
keep them away on these bugs by

313
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,800
ourselves with our immune system now

314
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,710
these heavy metals they tip the balance

315
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,150
and they allow give bugs an advantage

316
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,550
yeah and you know you know what's

317
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,560
amazing is that we're made out of trace

318
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,570
minerals you know we're making out of

319
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,130
minerals it's in their bones it's

320
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,530
everywhere trace minerals in our tissue

321
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,330
connective tissue or organs we've got

322
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,920
all these trace minerals you know we got

323
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,060
the zinc with selenium we've got all

324
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,530
these other trace minerals it's

325
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,410
unbelievable what we have what we're

326
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:51,070
made out of and metals toxic heavy

327
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:55,470
metals they're a metal they're a metal

328
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,470
out of the earth a toxic one

329
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,170
manufacturer metals trace minerals are

330
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,199
types of

331
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,899
in a way minerals have that connection

332
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:11,209
you have the metals they're reacting the

333
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:14,029
minerals and then they in a they would

334
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:16,040
they destroy our trace minerals metals

335
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:18,679
destroy the weaken our immune system

336
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,959
they break this down and then and they

337
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,949
and they also work energetically in a

338
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:27,489
negative for example don't talk about

339
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:29,660
astrology and in Mercury's in retrograde

340
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:32,899
so what has happened there's an

341
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:36,709
energetic influence cool of mercury yeah

342
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:41,569
that really puts your body in a pickle

343
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:43,399
yeah yeah no totally agreed 100% exactly

344
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:45,529
and and when you got the toxic heavy

345
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,839
metals you can have some brain fog can

346
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:49,189
have some anxiety could have migraines

347
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,959
aches and pains

348
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:52,639
well the main mechanism called mercury

349
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,279
is called the great mimicry because it

350
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,499
can mimic any disease it can mimic as a

351
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,199
psychiatric problem as a skin disease as

352
00:13:57,499 --> 00:14:02,779
a gastroenterology problem as a heart

353
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:05,059
problem it can mimic any disease so it

354
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,850
is called a great mimicker and we need

355
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:09,470
to find out because now everybody's

356
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,869
exposed too much well you know we all

357
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,959
have mercury in us from year from from

358
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:17,480
generations past we tended earth yeah

359
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,919
it's in the foods that we eat it's in

360
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,480
the water that was showering with the

361
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,160
industries the industry's been using

362
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,850
mercury going all the way back hundreds

363
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,040
in hundreds of years

364
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,839
no no boys and it's oh it's innocent we

365
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,029
passed it on down the family line if we

366
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,769
don't get it out of us and the program

367
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:33,230
then we're gonna keep on passing it

368
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:37,419
around the process the problem is this I

369
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:40,970
am now a true believer that

370
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:45,199
detoxification is something that can

371
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:47,299
save the the big picture and really

372
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,059
bring chronic disease now well

373
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:52,699
detoxification is used in a weird way

374
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:54,559
too many people are using detox and this

375
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:56,929
and detox that that's why functional

376
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,789
medicine now changed the word and talks

377
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,470
about it as biotransformation

378
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:03,049
so basically is what the body already

379
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,600
knows what to do getting toxic chemicals

380
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:09,279
which 90% are lipophilic only dissolving

381
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,480
fat and then throwing it through certain

382
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,039
reactions in the liver first phase one

383
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,289
detoxification phase phase two

384
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,950
detoxification and turning them into a

385
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,340
non

386
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,840
toxic and water-soluble compound so that

387
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,930
it can be excludable it's like having

388
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,030
metals cannot yeah yes so so you can you

389
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,540
can create the conditions for your body

390
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:32,120
to detoxify by themselves by supporting

391
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,040
the liver nutritionally by by doing

392
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,030
certain things to reduce the workload of

393
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:40,700
the digestive system and and and heavy

394
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,500
metals with not so we can go might not

395
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,450
get clean we we can cleanse other

396
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,070
poisons and toxins out of us easy and

397
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,930
most of them yeah most of them all right

398
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,670
we can cleanse them out we do the right

399
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,190
things with foods we do the right things

400
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,750
with all the stuff but heavy metals

401
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:59,270
rolling heavy metals they're stubborn

402
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:02,720
they're really ineffective ways that we

403
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,850
do get rid of anybody anybody who just

404
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,310
came on dr. Alejandro younger right here

405
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,040

medications in order to be able to

426
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,340
function for the rest of my life this is

427
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,200
what medicine was telling me and the

428
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,690

because you care about your patients I

431

just saw what you always did I went to

432
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,589
India to live in a monastery where I

433
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,930
learned a little bit about herbal

434
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,910
medicine Ayurvedic medicine and I

435
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,970
started getting better you know yeah it

00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,110
was no processed foods yeah this thing

437
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,640

processed foods all the time I bet all

440
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,100
that in and we take it for granted we

441
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,319
think that information

442
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,299
always been out there it was never out

443
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,890
there it was never really out there

444
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,960
doctors are talking about stay away from

445
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,390
processed foods now it kind of stems

446
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,830
from basically sources like dr.

447
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,419
Alejandro younger that's what's

448
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,980
interesting I mean I'm going to talk

449
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:43,429
about no processed foods for a long time

450
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,830
I don't know processed foods yeah I call

451
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:48,200
them food like products yeah food like

452
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,240
products but we take that for everybody

453
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,400
everybody including on YouTube and other

454
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,200
places and then influence and stuff they

455
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,429
they automatically if you they hear

456
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,320
processed foods or they hear anything

457
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:59,150
like that that's it's a no-brainer stay

458
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,600
away from them it wasn't a no-brainer

459
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:05,059
years ago it's men like dr. nada under

460
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,130
younger that had a fight for it because

461
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:09,169
when you know when when you had a pavé

462
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,210
away its front earring and I had to pave

463
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:13,730
the way in frontier I mean that the

464
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,600
smack I got for trying to get people

465
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:20,360
gluten-free 35 years ago was

466
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:34,190
unbelievable untold agony I had to deal

467
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:36,740
with that really caught my attention

468
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:39,830
about you but still as a doctor though

469
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,510
it was this is new ground you you you as

470
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,610
a medical doctor you said you know what

471
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,409
and this is early on for medical doctors

472
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,179
with no processed food and no and none

473
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:48,679
of those no no you know bad foods and

474
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:51,500
all that I teach I teach my patients

475
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,480
live longer than the life shelf of any

476
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,880
product that you buy the shorter your

477
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,830
life yeah I mean and then you know look

478
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,510
and then you know you hear about doctors

479
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,429
out there and they they just they

480
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,020
graduated a few years ago they're in

481
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:05,000
gastroenterology they're in something

482
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,460
else they're doing something and they

483
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,840
don't like all the natural information

484
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,159
that's being spread out there about the

485
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,760
medical medium and other stuff they

486
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,470
don't like it

487
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,900
because they they haven't had the

488
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,880
experience of being like there's there

489
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,220
isn't answers out there there just isn't

490
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,960
answers there is but there is with a lot

491
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,659
of procedures there is with a lot of

492
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,539
medicine a good heart doctor priceless

493
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:28,730
all this but but but when it comes down

494
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,530
to broken bones and all kinds of

495
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,210
injuries you get into this you get into

496
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,440
there's all kinds of things but when it

497
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,160
comes down to what people are

498
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,380
the Crohn's colitis IBS got a

499
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,500
gastrointestinal disorders that are that

500
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:45,350
are not fixable by just cotton snip or a

501
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,720
medication that's when we get in trouble

502
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,870
it's all those things the chronic

503
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,020
diseases of the modern world cannot be

504
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,880
treated like the acute diseases surgery

505
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,420
and medications are great for the acute

506
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,300
diseases but humanity problems are only

507
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,560
ten percent are cubes ninety percent of

508
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,800
the problems you're suffering from are

509
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,290
the chronic problems in which you got to

510
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,660
go back to the where the root cause of

511
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,300
proteins and for most of them is in the

512
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,040
gut yeah exactly I want to ask for heavy

513
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,540
metals or bugs yeah and we're gonna talk

514
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,700
about heavy metals we know how to get

515
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,050
them out a little bit in all that to

516
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,120
we'll go into that a little bit but I

517
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,470
wanted to ask you about the science and

518
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,330
research part that's really interesting

519
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:29,930
like it's all interesting but the part

520
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,400
where you know what science thinks it

521
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,130
has it right for a little while and then

522
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,710
it changes its tune new years later it

523
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,300
changes it soon and then it's these are

524
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,640
people that are people that are

525
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,590
gravitating to studies here and then the

526
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,050
studies here but they they keep on

527
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,000
changing so no matter what scientific

528
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,250
study you got I'm even in heart

529
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,800
procedures heart surgeries they were

530
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,570
different back then they would cut the

531
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,730
whole chest wide open they would snip

532
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,200
all the ribs right down here I mean they

533
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,570
would cut them open at your spread your

534
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,700
whole ribcage out now they're doing

535
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,170
they're doing Valerie play some us an

536
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,270
under some of them still someone who's

537
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,880
still happy but but um for example look

538
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,580
at what happened with the war on food in

539
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,910
America yeah when I came to America in

540
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:17,030
the 90s early nineties there was a war

541
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:19,340
on fat everything was fat free from in

542
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,610
the supermarkets so they had to replace

543
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,980
the calories with carrots yeah right now

544
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,640
at carbide a few years later made

545
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:30,110
mistakes with that whole later

546
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,480
carbohydrates became the enemy yeah and

547
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,790
so we waged a war on carbohydrates and

548
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,680
then now we're in the honeymoon with fat

549
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,860
everybody who's loaded for any changes

550
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,049
and then it

551
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:45,000
and in so many studies that show

552
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:47,500
definitely results for certain

553
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,570
approaches that medic modern medicine

554
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:53,590
takes a few years later or 10 years

555
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:55,330
later shown to be wrong yeah cuz you

556
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,580
tell me the but they could find

557
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,040
something they're looking for yeah and

558
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,440
stay with that but then look and then

559
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,630
the rest falls apart a researcher and we

560
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,429
actually end up finding what they're

561
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,840
looking for yeah but they only look for

562
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:09,790
what they already know they already

563
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,980
exact so we don't know what they're

564
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,630
looking for it's like okay so celery

565
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,309
juice helping out a lot you've seen

566
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,790
celery juice help out a lot of people I

567
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:22,330
saw you prescribing to patients in front

568
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:24,730
of me that improved later by taking the

569
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,080
celery juice but science research they

570
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,010
don't know anything about celery juice

571
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,870
because they don't even know what

572
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,490
they're looking for yet they don't look

573
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,929
for so people be out there oh it's got

574
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,730
this vitamin and it's got this mineral

575
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:34,960
it's got a little bit of this set but

576
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,520
that's not why people are getting better

577
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,140
because all the fruits and vegetables

578
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,580
and other foods and even animal products

579
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,730
have vitamins and minerals in it and

580
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,260
that's not this gets people better the

581
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,390
thing is this you can you cannot argue

582
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,150
with success and you can see and you see

583
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,950
the results all over the world in how

584
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,900
many thousand hundreds of thousands of

585
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,780
people that are because of you taking

586
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,480
celery juice right yeah so now senator

587
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:01,210
juice doesn't need a study well maybe

588
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,400
yes but but what are the downsides of

589
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,010
taking Saturday juice there's a downside

590
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,960
in taking medications there's a risk but

591
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,870
there's no risk in taking senator so why

592
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,720
not try exactly why not try and the

593
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,510
thing is is I always find the organic

594
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,910
studies organic studies are lots of

595
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,770
people drinking celery juice their skin

596
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,360
is clearing up their eczema psoriasis is

597
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,340
clearing up the brain fog is going away

598
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,650
their their anxieties dropping down

599
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,840
there's third there bloating goes down

600
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,520
their digestive system gets strong you

601
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,740
kind of argue would success all these

602
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,780
things are happening neurological

603
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,010
disorders are reversing celery juice

604
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,690
when you're drinking it right at the

605
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:41,049
right dosages and you're doing all that

606
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,270
all the stuffs happening and that's the

607
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:46,000
study see that's the study that's not

608
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,620
paid for that's what I love about that

609
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,870
that's the study that's not paid for

610
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,210
that's the organic study that

611
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,309
those truth and that who's gonna waste

612
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,380
money for research

613
00:23:54,309 --> 00:24:04,630
instead you know because there's mainly

614
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:06,730
money maybe it's innate maybe the so

615
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:09,700
many juices a nice or because basically

616
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,450
what it does it hurts the pockets of the

617
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,820
industries

618
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,980
you can't bankroll off of it you can't

619
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,620
bet you can't make like billions of

620
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,630
dollars off it unless every fun acting

621
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,720
Center is so yeah but they get like one

622
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:25,990
penny one penny I talked to a couple

623
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,000
selling farmers and they said listen

624
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,730
there's no money in this you're making

625
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,620
us do all this work we have to feed this

626
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,720
so we have to get the all the natural

627
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,070
organic fertilizers we got to get all

628
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,450
these things and when you have the

629
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,040
equipment you're making us

630
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,660
that's what you know a farmer said to me

631
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:48,179
you're making us lease 20 more tractors

632
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:50,710
and and we're not making any money off I

633
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,900
think it's the middleman I think it's

634
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,410
not the farmers a new supermarket that

635
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,490
are delivering it to probably to a

636
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,100
supermarket it's good you know it's

637
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:02,350
funny because they remember you know you

638
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,420
know and by the way it's going for

639
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,190
somebody to make money yeah on something

640
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,260
that's good yeah yeah that's you know

641
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,030
that's a reward from from the universe

642
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,740
you know I mean people would say hey

643
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,870
what's your history where do you come

644
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,520
from a little bit like with me and stuff

645
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,020
I don't talk about myself ever it's

646
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,400
always about people it's about people

647
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,270
making sure they get the right things

648
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,880
yeah but spending a lifetime in Maine

649
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,559
and in that state and then the fisherman

650
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,140
out there with the lobstering and all

651
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,150
that stuff and I got that history in my

652
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,550
family and everything that family my

653
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,220
family line and and what happens is that

654
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,140
you don't make the money

655
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,150
catching the lobster of the fish the guy

656
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,770
that takes it to wherever he thinks it

657
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,300
next to he picks it up and he takes a

658
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,070
store he's a guy making money so I think

659
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,080
in the celery world's probably some

660
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,790
other place that's the same thing you

661
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,040
actually you're making the money

662
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,840
actually you know transporting it and

663
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,550
then the supermarket probably make some

664
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,140
money to the farmers they're not making

665
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,810
money I've had farmers tell me we're

666
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,910
killing ourselves to keep up with the

667
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,540
celery juice at that you know but they

668
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,280
know it's healing people

669
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,290
because they're drinking it too farmers

670
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,820
are like I'm gonna drink this and it's

671
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,530
healing people and everything and that's

672
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,660
the results you know the results are

673
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,240
what that is it's about this the organic

674
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,470
study in that organic study I mean you

675
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,000
have to remember that so if you're doing

676
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,120
something that's helping you in your

677
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,310
life that's that's what where it counts

678
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,630
that's where it counts I remember you

679
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,010
know visiting a doctor friend of mine

680
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,810
years and years years ago he said we'll

681
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,610
come to my office for I have lunch right

682
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,560
it's a long time it I think was like the

683
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,970
mid 90s or early nineties that come to

684
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,080
my office we'll have some lunch you just

685
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,820
gotta wait for a little while I have to

686
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,230
finish up with a couple patients so I

687
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,790
was waiting around out there and he had

688
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,250
a television inside his waiting room

689
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:44,270
area in a television in there and it was

690
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:48,140
saying garlic was bad for you bad for

691
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:51,680
you meanwhile there was a there was a

692
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:54,200
report on mainstream media I think a

693
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,230
couple of years before that in like 1989

694
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,500
1990 that garlic was good for you and

695
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:02,120
then but garlic's bad for you so

696
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,710
something was found out in science of

697
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,870
garlic's bad for you and then garlic

698
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,330
became good for you again and now it

699
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:12,410
then became bad for you it's just this

700
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:14,420
is is it on purpose why is this done you

701
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,820
know what I mean it's like I mean you

702
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,530
you know better than I as a physician

703
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,060
you know but I mean you're an expert

704
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,520
cardiologists you're an expert doctor

705
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,500
you you know why why is it like that

706
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,970
because because first of all first of

707
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,310
all there's in there's economic

708
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,840
interests in many of the studies but

709
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,420
also there's there's mistakes there's

710
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,550
the way that you design a study and then

711
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,610
the way that you interpret a study will

712
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:40,610
have a huge difference between the you

713
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:44,090
know one result or or another okay so so

714
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:46,250
you know research it's very important

715
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,170
but you gotta be careful when when you

716
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,330
interpret it yeah so that's that's what

717
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:53,330
happens you know it's incredible I mean

718
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:56,420
I know there's a lot of people and they

719
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:58,550
stand behind science and research but I

720
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,310
think that I noticed that when they

721
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:03,920
haven't seen twenty doctors and I

722
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,900
haven't seen five neurologists and I

723
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,120
haven't seen all these other people

724
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,490
right and they haven't been through what

725
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,100
all you guys have been through because I

726
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:15,770
mean you know dr. Junger I mean the

727
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,870
people in the audience here I mean they

728

735
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,740
notice too haven't gotten sick yet but

736
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:39,140
just by chance by chance in a lot of

737
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,390
ways it just weren't the toxins didn't

738
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,370
overflow yet or something didn't go

739
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,409
wrong yet and by chance or they didn't

740
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,330
pick up a new pathogen or a new bug or

741
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:49,220
something or or an old bug in their

742
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,980
system didn't flourish and take over

743
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,750
something something you know Medes made

744
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,149
it so they're just still okay enough

745
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,620
they'll get sick later but they're still

746
00:28:56,149 --> 00:29:00,350
okay enough those are the people I

747
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:02,899
notice that are like Oh hogwash rubbish

748
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,820
hogwash on this hogwash on that they're

749
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:06,919
not critics they become haters instead

750
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,720
because they believed so strongly the

751
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,480
science has figured everything out you

752
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,970
know and everything else the body is the

753
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,940
house we've been given right but it's

754
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,770
not their body we're renting it and and

755
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,409
it's not until people get the eviction

756
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:23,779
notice right the diagnosis then they

757
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:26,059
start looking for different solutions so

758
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:28,010
yeah I know I know the people that are

759
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:32,809

760
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:35,419

who are you are kind of the embodiment

787
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,009
of compassion yourself but what I what I

788
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:36,440
what I am saying is that we we cannot

789
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:38,089
forget that there is a space for science

790
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,669
right yeah yeah and there is a huge

791
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:42,919
space also for what science doesn't know

792
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:43,940
yeah and and and we have to take the

793
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,459
best out of everything

794
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,709
yeah and sure we're gonna deny one way

795
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:50,570
or not exactly and that I love because

796
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:52,339
there's things in science that offers is

797
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,589
amazing I talk about that all the time I

798
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:56,719
talk about my books you talk about it in

799
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:58,849
your books and you know there's there

800
00:30:56,719 --> 00:31:00,949
it's a powerful nugget science does have

801
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:03,499
so much to offer and but but

802
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:05,359
compassionate doctors like dr. Junger

803
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:06,979
that no there's you guys have suffered

804
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,629
and struggled you know that's the whole

805
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:10,879
thing that you guys have really been

806
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:11,959
through a lot that's what counts because

807
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:13,849
that's the only way we're ever gonna

808
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:15,409
move forward that's the only way we're

809
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:17,690
ever gonna move forward is if if

810
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:19,369

811
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,869
the degrees like you do and have the

812
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:23,179
training that you do and then the

experience and expertise know that you

814
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:26,659
guys are really struggling and that all

815
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,549
the answers are on out there and then

816
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:29,809
that our bodies the temple we got to get

817
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:31,190

820
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,589
that's what's incredible I want to talk

821
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:39,289

822
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:42,909

823
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:45,139
they're sent in such a toxic a toxic

824
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:46,489
element that's in the way of people's

825
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:49,309
healings and I want to talk about that

826
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:51,049
to get them out but before we before we

827
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:52,849
tell them how to make take them out tell

828
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:54,379

831
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,799
everything and we use them in so many

832
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,469
things I mean do you remember or write

833
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,319
about my Hatter's disease these to use

834
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:08,629
mercury in shaping hats so when you put

835
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,909
the hat on and you absorb mercury into

836
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:13,099
your system yeah and here's the thing I

837
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:14,599
put it on cosmetics okay the Mad

838
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,229
Hatter's disease I want to talk about

839
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,879
that a little bit

840
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:19,999
you guys don't wear a hat laced in

841
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:22,639
mercury you know but your forefathers

842
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:24,589
did and it's passed on through utero and

843
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:27,229
you know from sperm and egg it's passed

844
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:29,869
on that's how it's done

845
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:33,229
mercury gets passed on down the line

846
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:35,570
every generation until you get it out so

847
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:39,010
yeah yeah someone wore a hat back

848
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:43,160
19:20 with mercury and oh you know but

849
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:46,490
even if you were from your environment

850
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:49,400
the furniture that we buy is treated

851
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:53,300
with having met with LED and sure yeah

852
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:57,080
then the lacquer lacquer metals in it so

853
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:59,630
yes recently lipstick had mercury and

854
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,460
lead and so some some the cosmetics we

855
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:04,400
use the air we breathe the water we

856
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,040
drink and showered with but mostly the

857
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,320
the foods that we are loaded with

858
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,250
chemicals that a loner in communication

859
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,230
would cause some kind of learning

860
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,510
problem exam and the heavy metals are a

861
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,280
big part of it and the thing is this if

862
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,560
you don't help the body get rid of the

863
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,330
heavy metals it won't catch up with it

864
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:25,970
so that's why I love that you came up

865
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:28,250
with with the ingredients here I used to

866
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,750
recommend them separately but what

867
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,250
better than get them all together yeah

868
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,720
you get them all together you guys you

869
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,940

if you got a thing that I detox movie

900
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:37,520
the thing that I teach my patients is to

901
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,900
eat all the different colors as I

902
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,360
learned from a colleague of mine called

903
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,940
you're gonna get something good in you

904
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,470
that way

905
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,659
no matter what is it what's been

906
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:48,569
happening this is the variability of

907
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:51,060
colors in your diet the bigger the

908
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:54,030
variability of your gut flora which is

909
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:57,599
now known to be really important part of

910
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,970
your body system so especially for

911
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,460
detoxification yeah the good intestinal

912
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,650
flora will detoxify half of the toxins

913
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,020
that you're exposed to if it's if it's a

914
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,849
healthy yeah bio yeah and it gets beaten

915
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,920
down by the toxins too so it gets beaten

916
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:12,390
down and that's a whole other thing and

917
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,550
we get inflamed the thing is with the

918
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,260
gut and she's got the pathogens in there

919
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,089
you got the streptococcus which will end

920
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,950
up giving you a SIBO diagnosis you got

921
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:22,290
bacteria in there that could you know

922
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,000
it's hiding behind rancid proteins that

923
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,010
are up on the linings of the intestinal

924
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,319
tract you know you got those things and

925
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:30,060
you end up feeding it with gluten and

926
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:31,589
you end up feeding it with eggs you

927
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,880
gotta be careful you guys don't do and

928
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:34,740
you do chicken eggs you'll feed

929
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,530
everything you know I always tell

930
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:40,920
everybody all the bugs were raised in

931
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:43,560
labs a long time ago and eggs were used

932
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,780
as the food eggs are a food for these

933
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,550
bugs and if they have eggs and you know

chair I fall off my chair

961
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,730
I'm just glad we're here this is

962
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,130
incredible and I just want to talk about

963
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,869
his folks for a quick second and he did

964
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,790
a book called clean gut you guys could

965
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:50,100
always check that out incredible clean

966
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,570
the original that's the original book

967
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,430
that's when you were like you know what

968
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,810
I'm gonna just I'm gonna do this I'm

969
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,330
gonna get the word out to the world

970
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:00,690
right there the thing is that that I was

971
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,940
discovering you have when you support

972
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,770
the detoxification systems that we

973
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,630
already have yeah and are trying to do

974
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,340
their work but they can't because our

975
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,050
foods are devoid of nutrients and

976
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,120
because our digestive systems are

977
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,610
working all the time therefore stealing

978
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,340
energy from the detoxification systems

979
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,050
then then when you create the conditions

980
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,490
and you support the liver and the other

981
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,920
organs to do the work of detoxification

982
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:25,890
it was just incredible what people who

983
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,590
are getting better off from right and I

984
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,690
got still called because the book he's

985
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,790
known as many languages as yours but

986
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:34,740
it's in a 20-something language you know

987
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,630

988
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,210
messages from all over the world ten

program and I got better from this and

991
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,410

hear about how many different chronic

993
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:54,120

people because they're hearing about the

1051
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,829
gun that you Haley they're hearing about

1052
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,989
their body being this temple and we rent

1053
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:16,239
it we rent out this body we can get an

1054
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:20,710
eviction notice if we're not you know

1055
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:22,630
that's how I know this is an eviction

1056
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,880
notice that's the only time when people

1057
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,859
get serious and start making changes

1058
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,009
right that's true but the problem is

1059
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:32,319
this we know now that the chronic

1060
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:35,920
diseases that we're suffering from all

1061
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:39,009
over the world start years before in a

1062
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,650
silent mode and they start by turning on

1063
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:44,440
the inflammatory system by the way which

1064
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:46,720
80% is around the gut within and around

1065
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:50,259
the guys so your inflammation can be

1066
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,739
turned on for 15 years before the real

1067
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:56,319
disease is diagnosed absolutely so start

1068
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:58,660
don't don't wait for symptoms even even

1069
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,299
if even if they're minor symptoms don't

1070
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,549
wait for them to get worse or other

1071
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:06,870
symptoms to appear or chronic diseases

1072
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:09,490
to be diagnosed start now

1073
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,290
powerful powerful exactly it's what

1074
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,670
happens with Hashimoto's thyroiditis it

1075
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,830
started out with Epstein Barr in your

1076
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,380
system and then percolated in their

1077
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,660
proliferated over the years and also now

1078
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,640
you're 32 you're 35 you're 42 you get

1079
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,110
your you gave your hypothyroid diagnosis

1080
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,060
the doctors worried about your thyroid

1081
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:27,190
and that's because he had the viral

1082
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,680
infection the Epstein Barr deep down in

1083
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:32,350
there in your system a long time ago and

1084
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,360
if we knew if we just know that we can

1085
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,890
we can really avoid things and of course

1086
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,810
if we get a problem we could work on

1087
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,700
healing it reversing it make sure you

1088
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,610
drink your celery juice make sure you do

1089
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:46,330
all the good stuff we're talking about

1090
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:48,580
and remember and remember your body has

1091
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:50,410
the ability to heal each I love that

1092
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,820
that gets me kind of choked up right now

1093
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,770
well that's right that's what that's how

1094
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,650
nature design nature did not design

1095
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:59,560
diseases right disease is what we known

1096
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:01,630
as diseases are just adaptation and

1097
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,630
survival mechanisms that your body put

1098
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:06,970
on in order to defend itself in and

1099
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,570
survive right and they've been there for

1100
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,670
too long

1101
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:11,110
for example heart disease which affects

1102
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:14,110
everybody what is it

1103
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:16,390
it's the blockage of arteries right by

1104
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,950
cholesterol yeah but at the beginning in

1105
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,510
the beginning it starts because there's

1106
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:22,120
a little fissure in the artery in the

1107
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:25,360
body it patches it up good cholesterol

1108
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,790
now if if the fissure is healed and you

1109
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,990
know the smoking and the bad fats and

1110
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:31,750
then the stress and the high blood

1111
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:34,440
pressure are taken away from the from

1112
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:36,670
the picture the the the body we

1113
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,840
reabsorbed that lack of cholesterol and

1114
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,510
then everything will be fine

1115
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,490
but because the irritating factors the

1116
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:45,250
toxins the heavy metals them let's just

1117
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,080
keep on there the body keeps on patching

1118
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,070
keeps on patching keeps on patching as a

1119
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,350
survival mechanism

1120
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:53,140
eventually the patching will block the

1121
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:57,490
flow of blood and that's when heart

1122
00:42:53,140 --> 00:43:01,060
disease is diagnosed right so so this is

1123
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:03,720
our survival mechanism and if you get to

1124
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:08,020
understand how to remove the obstacles

1125
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:10,750
bugs heavy metals stress bad thoughts

1126
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,150
bad company you remove the obstacles and

1127
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:16,480
you add what is lacking which is usually

1128
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:18,250
a nutrient yeah

1129
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,369
good nutrients

1130
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:25,090
then everything results by itself and

1131
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:27,910
the body is able to regain its ability

1132
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:29,710
its natural ability to heal itself you

1133
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:33,070
know in remember and that's coming from

1134
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:34,930
you know an expert cardiologist right

1135
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,940
here an expert cardiologists right here

1136
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:39,280
means powerful piece of information and

1137
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,410
it's just it's it's you know they have

1138
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,300
that right here is amazing you know just

1139
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,590
remember it's like exactly the doctor

1140
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,060
your eyes are saying is your body can

1141
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:48,460
heal there's so many of you that have

1142
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:51,520
been sick for a long time and you forget

1143
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,530
what it's like to feel good and some of

1144
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,390
you have never felt good and it breaks

1145
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,460
my heart you never had that moment in

1146
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:59,710
your life where you felt good and then

1147
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,510
and because you've started out sick you

1148
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,700
started out with symptoms you know there

1149
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:06,280
weren't it's or it's rare times you

1150
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,770
remember you felt good and and and and

1151
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,800
don't get lost in that I know it's it's

1152
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:13,960
it's easy for me to say and when you're

1153
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,310
going through it it's hard it's hard but

1154
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,320
they hear it from me it probably easy

1155
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,880
it's easy for me to say hey just hang in

1156
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,490
there but no it's more than that know

1157
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,650
that I care and I really want you to

1158
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:26,140
hang in there because I want you to know

1159
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:27,760
that you can heal and you will it's just

1160
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,290
you're gonna you're gonna learn from the

1161
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,760
medical medium serious books you learn

1162
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:32,530
from dr. younger suppose you just learn

1163
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,980
and we're gonna make sure we help you in

1164
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:39,550
any way we can I mean I would go even

1165
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:42,369
further and it's this I see the planet

1166
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:44,290
as a living organism as an animal as it

1167
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:46,390
were right and the rivers are like the

1168
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:49,390
arteries and the forests are like the

1169
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:52,960
lungs and and and the cells that are

1170
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:55,450
running around right are you and me

1171
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,070
so people are the cells of this organism

1172
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:00,089
right and and if you look at this

1173
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:03,849
organism this the planet it has a fever

1174
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:06,700
global warming is not anything else but

1175
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:09,339
a symptom it's you know so so where is

1176
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:11,650
this symptom coming from and in in my

1177
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:13,839
opinion the majority of the problem is

1178
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:16,089
the toxicity of our breath yeah it's

1179
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,580
excessively not only the toxins the air

1180
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:19,990
we breathe the water we drink and shower

1181
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,180
with the cosmetics we use the

1182
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,710
medications we take right but most of

1183
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,630
the foods that way that food a lot of

1184
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,420
yeah you know I didn't have to worry

1185
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,119
about you coming

1186
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:31,730
with clone on cuz cologne cologne just

1187
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,200
it's just it's so strong you know when

1188
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:36,349
people work alone it's they stay away

1189
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,910
from it's toxic and and and if you know

1190
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:39,470
and some people don't like the smell I

1191
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,210
don't think too many people like the

1192
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,099
smell Cologne I didn't even have to say

1193
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:46,339
anything because you're not gonna come

1194
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:48,170
here to doused with Cologne you're not

1195
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:50,540
gonna come here not gonna come here

1196
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:52,520
doubts with all that and because it's

1197
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,799
you know it's toxic and so it it's an

1198
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,230
example you know you know where I was

1199
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:59,809
when I was going at is that when when

1200
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:01,819
healing ourselves we have to be healing

1201
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:04,700
the planet yeah because yeah eyes above

1202
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:08,000
so below right everything goes together

1203
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:10,339
the more the more we learn how to create

1204
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,319
the conditions for our bodies to you the

1205
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:14,059
more we're heating the planet you know

1206
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,099
it's incredible and it's true I mean

1207
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:18,200
there's a tremendous amount of toxicity

1208
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:20,299
here it's falling out of the sky I talk

1209
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,000
about it all the time we breathe it in

1210
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:25,280
or it's any we can't we can't hide from

1211
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,900
it we can't run from it we can protect

1212
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,280
ourselves the best we can but we got to

1213
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,569
do it for the food so we got to protect

1214
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,970
your stuff some way we're doing it I

1215
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:34,160
just love this and it's incredible time
