[264.78 - 267.96] is the burnout stabilizer and the thing
[266.70 - 270.60] I want to talk to you about that is
[267.96 - 273.12] first of all people get diagnosed now
[270.60 - 275.70] with burnout but it's totally
[273.12 - 279.24] misunderstood yes you could get burnt
[275.70 - 281.94] out but why how how does it work
[279.24 - 283.44] and then it's it's a scapegoat too it's
[281.94 - 285.30] like oh you're just burnt out you're
[283.44 - 286.56] just weak you're not as strong as
[285.30 - 289.02] somebody else
[286.56 - 291.54] somebody else can handle everything
[289.02 - 293.82] somebody else can do more you're just
[291.54 - 296.64] weak something's wrong with you you're
[293.82 - 299.76] burnt out you need a vacation you need a
[296.64 - 302.10] a sabbatical you need a year off right
[299.76 - 304.14] people say but it's more than that it's
[302.10 - 306.66] way more than that the burnout
[304.14 - 309.30] stabilizer is incredible though because
[306.66 - 311.58] if you feel like you've been pushing
[309.30 - 314.04] right pushing too much pushing the
[311.58 - 315.72] envelope you got a lot going on or

[566.94 - 570.84] because of all these reasons think about
[569.10 - 573.36] that
[570.84 - 575.60] all that matters so let's go into it a

[695.88 - 700.68] how many times has the man-made stuff in
[697.68 - 703.08] conventional Health not helped us
[700.68 - 706.26] I read a comment recently
[703.08 - 708.06] and you might even be here okay who the
[706.26 - 710.46] person who left this comment but I read
[708.06 - 713.76] a comment recently about charcoal
[710.46 - 716.52] they took charcoal years ago
[713.76 - 717.90] I think it was like 20 years ago
[716.52 - 719.64] because the doctor wanted them on
[717.90 - 721.38] charcoal
[719.64 - 723.98] and then they stopped it and then three
[721.38 - 723.98] years later
[724.20 - 728.18] they were getting a colonic for the
[725.82 - 728.18] first time
[729.60 - 735.96] and the therapist there
[733.32 - 738.18] was seeing black ink coming out of their
[735.96 - 740.28] colon
[738.18 - 742.62] because the charcoal
[740.28 - 743.46] did what I've been telling everybody it
[742.62 - 747.78] does
[743.46 - 750.12] it clings to the intestinal tract walls
[747.78 - 752.64] not allowing nutrients to get in to the
[750.12 - 754.92] bloodstream making somebody deficient
[752.64 - 756.54] and it could stay there forever
[754.92 - 758.40] and so they're getting clonic and it was
[756.54 - 762.00] getting it out black ink was coming out
[758.40 - 764.46] Courtney M.A you saw this comment too

[903.36 - 905.76] you guys we're gonna we're gonna have a
[904.86 - 907.32] great time and I'm gonna read about
[905.76 - 909.48] burnout a little bit so you guys can be
[907.32 - 911.10] blown away by the information but I had
[909.48 - 912.06] something that was kind of needling my
[911.10 - 913.56] brain
[912.06 - 915.42] this morning
[913.56 - 917.16] I woke up this morning it was like five
[915.42 - 919.08] o'clock in the morning or something
[917.16 - 920.46] and I woke up and I thought about it and
[919.08 - 922.92] I thought about like all the podcast
[920.46 - 925.38] doctor guys
[922.92 - 927.84] and all the other like guys and they all
[925.38 - 930.48] have their big websites right
[927.84 - 931.86] but they charge for everything but I
[930.48 - 933.84] thought they were in it for people being
[931.86 - 936.18] sick but it turns out really not because
[933.84 - 937.56] if you're in it for the chronically ill
[936.18 - 940.20] and if you're in it for The Chronic
[937.56 - 941.70] allele to get answers and to heal why
[940.20 - 943.80] are you charging them everything
[941.70 - 946.20] everywhere why are you putting pay walls
[943.80 - 947.88] up why are you charging for every course
[946.20 - 949.76] in class why are you charging everything
[947.88 - 954.60] if you're in it for the chronically ill
[949.76 - 956.46] this was needling my brain at 5am
[954.60 - 958.32] and
[956.46 - 960.60] it's insane really when you think about
[958.32 - 962.40] it and then when you actually pay for
[960.60 - 964.26] one of their things their courses or you
[962.40 - 966.06] pay for one of their things or you
[964.26 - 967.50] subscribe to their website the
[966.06 - 969.12] information Falls flat and you don't
[967.50 - 972.18] heal from it
[969.12 - 973.38] what what is that like I was really was
[972.18 - 975.12] really starting to bother me this
[973.38 - 977.34] morning anyway go to Medical medium.com

[977.34 - 982.68] so pay firewalls or something
[980.58 - 984.78] Deborah says the brain shots relax me
[982.68 - 986.76] and I don't realize how tense I am until
[984.78 - 988.86] after I take the shots that's how it
[986.76 - 990.90] works so incredible the shots are and
[988.86 - 993.42] that's how it works
[990.90 - 996.00] Krishna says I had the plague and after
[993.42 - 997.86] was coughing for weeks I had your brain
[996.00 - 999.96] shot after the first shot I got better

[999.96 - 1005.18] second all gone thank you your amazing

[1012.32 - 1015.14] messenger Spirit of compassion brings
[1013.94 - 1018.68] the information down in the medical
[1015.14 - 1020.60] medium books and they are here for us
[1018.68 - 1023.06] and for the new people here you may not
[1020.60 - 1026.66] like me some reason or what or the way I
[1023.06 - 1028.58] look or the way I talk or what
[1026.66 - 1030.14] a billionaire friend friend was telling
[1028.58 - 1031.40] me or a friend was telling me I forgot I
[1030.14 - 1033.62] was the billionaire friend or the doctor
[1031.40 - 1036.26] actually a lot of people talk to me and
[1033.62 - 1038.18] I forgot who's saying that
[1036.26 - 1039.50] the problem is with me is that a lot of
[1038.18 - 1042.56] people don't like me because I'm not
[1039.50 - 1044.96] like Ivy League school I'm not
[1042.56 - 1046.66] they smell working class on me
[1044.96 - 1050.36] and it really pisses off a lot of people
[1046.66 - 1052.64] right I don't have that error about me
[1050.36 - 1054.32] I don't have that and it and it kind of
[1052.64 - 1056.72] gets people upset
[1054.32 - 1059.18] you got these incredible books
[1056.72 - 1060.56] they're telling me right around the
[1059.18 - 1062.78] planet healing people getting them
[1060.56 - 1065.66] better but you're working class
[1062.78 - 1066.86] and people can smell it on you they can
[1065.66 - 1069.56] actually smell it they could smell
[1066.86 - 1072.20] you're not from private schools ivy
[1069.56 - 1073.64] league whatever that you're not whatever
[1072.20 - 1075.62] you know all that stuff you know you're
[1073.64 - 1077.54] not a trust funder I was never a trust
[1075.62 - 1078.92] funder and you see all the trust funders
[1077.54 - 1080.18] put their books out and their podcast
[1078.92 - 1082.58] out and they're actually all trust
[1080.18 - 1084.38] funders but nobody knows it
[1082.58 - 1086.36] it's like okay fine but the thing is
[1084.38 - 1087.80] people don't like me because they can
[1086.36 - 1089.90] tell I'm not part of that club that
[1087.80 - 1091.70] elite club that trust funder and that
[1089.90 - 1093.80] that whatever that elite club that
[1091.70 - 1095.18] nobody realized exists
[1093.80 - 1098.12] that's the reason why people don't like
[1095.18 - 1100.94] me I think of working class see
[1098.12 - 1103.04] wondering uh wishing it says my kids
[1100.94 - 1105.38] don't like the taste but they want to
[1103.04 - 1107.54] keep doing them incredible
[1105.38 - 1110.24] I love the way the brain shots make me
[1107.54 - 1112.58] feel we did not like the mold exposure
[1110.24 - 1113.78] but felt great afterwards I gotta tell
[1112.58 - 1116.72] you something
[1113.78 - 1118.46] three mold exposure shots I did right
[1116.72 - 1120.14] throughout the day
[1118.46 - 1122.06] I don't like the taste of the mold
[1120.14 - 1124.58] exposure shot at all
[1122.06 - 1127.76] but it does something and the feeling
[1124.58 - 1129.14] you get from it it's like it's it's like
[1127.76 - 1132.26] a
[1129.14 - 1134.12] it's a spiritual cleanse is what it is
[1132.26 - 1136.40] it's a physical and spiritual cleanse
[1134.12 - 1140.42] when you do the mold exposure shot like
[1136.40 - 1143.90] incredible it's really unbelievable okay

[1247.22 - 1251.30] of you seriously you guys
[1249.92 - 1252.56] so let's get into it a little bit more
[1251.30 - 1254.06] we're just talking about different
[1252.56 - 1257.42] things but
[1254.06 - 1261.14] we gotta get back to where we're going
[1257.42 - 1263.30] okay so we are
[1261.14 - 1265.40] at burnout the fish's brain so let's get
[1263.30 - 1267.98] rolling let's talk about this let's burn
[1265.40 - 1270.44] out what the hell is burnout man what is
[1267.98 - 1272.42] it I know I talk silly but the
[1270.44 - 1274.94] information in the books are not me
[1272.42 - 1278.30] talking silly it's all the words from
[1274.94 - 1280.48] above I write them down
[1278.30 - 1280.48] foreign
[1281.44 - 1286.30] books really smart from above
[1286.58 - 1292.22] me not smart books really smart from
[1290.12 - 1294.50] above
[1292.22 - 1298.18] know that
[1294.50 - 1298.18] me just good messenger
[1298.34 - 1304.22] from this incredible information
[1300.92 - 1305.96] from above to save lives
[1304.22 - 1308.24] picture a swimming pool with the water
[1305.96 - 1309.44] draining out you guys picture a swimming
[1308.24 - 1313.64] pool
[1309.44 - 1317.08] with the water draining out
[1313.64 - 1317.08] or picture an ocean
[1318.08 - 1321.86] that's draining because there's a big
[1320.18 - 1324.08] hole in the middle of the ocean and it's
[1321.86 - 1327.04] raining back into the Earth
[1324.08 - 1327.04] that's pretty cool
[1327.98 - 1332.12] at the same time you have water going
[1330.26 - 1334.10] back into the swimming pool or water
[1332.12 - 1336.14] going back into the ocean at the same
[1334.10 - 1339.44] time but here's the problem
[1336.14 - 1343.04] not as much water is flowing in than is
[1339.44 - 1344.72] Flowing out you have more water flowing
[1343.04 - 1346.54] out
[1344.72 - 1349.52] foreign
[1346.54 - 1351.86] flowing in so there's a problem here
[1349.52 - 1354.26] more water's flowing out less water is
[1351.86 - 1356.48] flowing in do you know what I'm saying I
[1354.26 - 1359.00] am figuring this out with you guys right
[1356.48 - 1360.68] we're figuring it all out less water is
[1359.00 - 1363.50] flowing into the pool
[1360.68 - 1364.82] or lake erosion more water is Flowing
[1363.50 - 1368.30] out
[1364.82 - 1370.88] so what happens the level goes down and
[1368.30 - 1372.38] the level goes down and the level goes
[1370.88 - 1373.58] down
[1372.38 - 1375.98] see
[1373.58 - 1378.98] right
[1375.98 - 1380.96] you got water coming in but more water
[1378.98 - 1382.46] leaving than what's water coming in and
[1380.96 - 1384.08] the level's dropping now but you're
[1382.46 - 1386.36] looking and you see the water coming in
[1384.08 - 1388.34] well I got water coming into that pole
[1386.36 - 1390.14] but for some reason that level is going
[1388.34 - 1392.24] down because more water is leaving the
[1390.14 - 1394.22] pool right
[1392.24 - 1396.20] that's how it works when supplies can't
[1394.22 - 1397.34] reach the brain faster than our brain is
[1396.20 - 1399.82] using them up
[1397.34 - 1402.80] our brain uses those supplies faster
[1399.82 - 1405.14] faster than we're putting them back in
[1402.80 - 1408.50] that's what happens
[1405.14 - 1411.26] our brain is using those supplies faster
[1408.50 - 1413.66] than what's going back into our brain
[1411.26 - 1415.06] that's what's going wrong with so many
[1413.66 - 1419.30] people what's going wrong with everybody
[1415.06 - 1422.12] everybody has that problem right now
[1419.30 - 1424.64] out there in the world
[1422.12 - 1427.22] if nutrients and phytochemical compounds
[1424.64 - 1429.74] and antiviral compounds
[1427.22 - 1431.72] very important antibacterial compounds
[1429.74 - 1433.40] macro minerals trace minerals Trace
[1431.72 - 1435.98] mineral salts vitamins glucose
[1433.40 - 1437.96] electrolytes coenzymes alkaloids get
[1435.98 - 1439.88] this antioxidants anthocyanins
[1437.96 - 1442.64] polyphenols and neurotransmitter
[1439.88 - 1445.58] chemicals leave the brain faster than we
[1442.64 - 1447.98] put them back into the brain how can our
[1445.58 - 1449.72] brain function optimally
[1447.98 - 1451.16] when you just think about that right
[1449.72 - 1453.44] there it's mind-blowing when you look at
[1451.16 - 1455.00] these these books these brand saver
[1453.44 - 1457.36] books and you just look at that and it's
[1455.00 - 1457.36] just like
[1458.84 - 1464.51] hold on you guys
[1461.43 - 1464.51] [Music]
[1464.84 - 1469.22] can I grow up
[1467.08 - 1473.12] should a family member said to me very
[1469.22 - 1475.72] recently said are you ever gonna grow up
[1473.12 - 1475.72] like what
[1476.36 - 1481.10] this is the foundation of burnout supply
[1479.48 - 1483.38] and demand
[1481.10 - 1485.24] supply and demand that's the foundation
[1483.38 - 1487.76] of burnout that's what's happening to
[1485.24 - 1489.38] everybody they're walking around and the
[1487.76 - 1491.48] water is leaving the swimming pool
[1489.38 - 1493.34] faster than the good Waters coming in so
[1491.48 - 1494.96] the water's leaving
[1493.34 - 1496.64] and the good water is coming in but it's
[1494.96 - 1498.44] not enough water coming in you see how
[1496.64 - 1500.42] it works and then boom we're starting to
[1498.44 - 1501.86] get lower lower and this is what's cool
[1500.42 - 1503.78] there's so much good information in this
[1501.86 - 1506.06] chapter alone it's mind-blowing and then
[1503.78 - 1508.22] what happens is
[1506.06 - 1509.84] deficiencies and burnout have more to do
[1508.22 - 1511.16] with each other than anybody knows get
[1509.84 - 1513.08] ready for this
[1511.16 - 1514.34] the conventional medical industry just
[1513.08 - 1516.56] wants to say oh you're burnt out you
[1514.34 - 1518.30] need a vacation
[1516.56 - 1520.70] that's what's wrong
[1518.30 - 1523.22] that's what they like to do
[1520.70 - 1525.50] but burnout is very much real what is
[1523.22 - 1527.18] true what it truly is and how it works
[1525.50 - 1528.62] that's what the missing pieces are out
[1527.18 - 1530.00] there in the industry they have no idea
[1528.62 - 1532.10] what it is there's no medical
[1530.00 - 1534.20] explanation
[1532.10 - 1536.00] alternative medicine still believes that
[1534.20 - 1537.86] autoimmune disease is the body attacking
[1536.00 - 1539.06] itself how unbelievable is that you go
[1537.86 - 1540.08] to your best functional medicine doctor
[1539.06 - 1541.70] and I want you guys to go to your
[1540.08 - 1543.26] doctors that's not the problem but you
[1541.70 - 1544.40] go to your best guy your best functional

[1567.50 - 1572.42] let's talk about what a journey of
[1569.60 - 1574.88] burnout kind of is right

[1585.86 - 1588.80] not have experienced this tell me if you
[1587.36 - 1592.12] have experienced this though you might
[1588.80 - 1592.12] you might not have checked this out
[1592.34 - 1595.36] why am I sick
[1595.58 - 1599.00] what's wrong with me
[1597.50 - 1602.42] were you ever here before
[1599.00 - 1604.58] where do I need to go
[1602.42 - 1606.20] okay phew
[1604.58 - 1608.74] it's all in my gut
[1606.20 - 1611.30] I found out for my doctor or online
[1608.74 - 1612.98] problem's just all in my gut
[1611.30 - 1614.84] but I'm not better yet
[1612.98 - 1616.34] I tried everything that doctor or
[1614.84 - 1617.54] whatever they recommended those five
[1616.34 - 1619.40] tips
[1617.54 - 1622.40] so what's wrong with me
[1619.40 - 1625.58] I tried all your gut stuff doctor I did
[1622.40 - 1628.10] the brain scans I did the MRIs I'm on my
[1625.58 - 1629.90] fifth doctor now this probiotic and this
[1628.10 - 1630.86] parasite cleanser not helping me get
[1629.90 - 1633.86] better
[1630.86 - 1637.58] so what's really wrong with me oh it's
[1633.86 - 1640.16] burnout okay I finally got my answer
[1637.58 - 1641.96] but she didn't get your answer
[1640.16 - 1642.68] that's the term but you didn't get your
[1641.96 - 1645.08] answer
[1642.68 - 1646.82] Jenny Jenn says I had an MRI with
[1645.08 - 1649.10] contrast last week that horribly
[1646.82 - 1650.60] impacted my short-term memory I did both
[1649.10 - 1652.70] the radiation and pharmaceutical
[1650.60 - 1654.68] exposure shots and I have my memory back
[1652.70 - 1657.26] brain shots are a blessing that's
[1654.68 - 1659.42] incredible that's that's that's actually
[1657.26 - 1662.00] investment to exactly them that's a
[1659.42 - 1664.22] testament to how they work that's the
[1662.00 - 1667.48] kind of power they have because that's a
[1664.22 - 1667.48] serious impact you had
[1669.08 - 1673.16] Julie says hi I'm doing these shots on
[1671.06 - 1675.80] my nephew who is addicted to gambling
[1673.16 - 1678.32] whoa and he's feeling loads better
[1675.80 - 1681.20] sleeping and looking better incredible
[1678.32 - 1682.82] keep them coming okay bartender give me
[1681.20 - 1685.78] another one bartender give me another
[1682.82 - 1685.78] one keep them coming
[1687.62 - 1691.64] burnout is an answer that makes sense
[1689.54 - 1693.32] for about 10 seconds you guys
[1691.64 - 1695.18] because it's more than that see these
[1693.32 - 1696.98] burnout stabilizers are addressing that
[1695.18 - 1698.60] burnout term but there's way deeper than
[1696.98 - 1700.46] that these burnout stabilizers are
[1698.60 - 1702.44] incredible because they address the real
[1700.46 - 1704.00] problems inside that's what I'm trying
[1702.44 - 1705.86] to tell you guys that's what I'm trying
[1704.00 - 1707.30] to say
[1705.86 - 1709.58] the word burnout in the medical
[1707.30 - 1711.98] establishment is an answer that lasts
[1709.58 - 1713.60] for 10 seconds an hour or a day or two
[1711.98 - 1715.34] that after that you're like what the
[1713.60 - 1717.62] heck is wrong with me a burnout
[1715.34 - 1719.24] diagnosis doesn't feel satisfying it's
[1717.62 - 1721.58] not satiating
[1719.24 - 1724.22] why am I burnt out you'll find yourself
[1721.58 - 1726.56] asking why am I burnt out you get ready
[1724.22 - 1727.94] how come I can't handle what someone
[1726.56 - 1730.52] else can handle
[1727.94 - 1732.44] see the questioning that happens think
[1730.52 - 1733.82] about that one right there how come I
[1732.44 - 1735.74] can't handle what everybody else can
[1733.82 - 1738.26] handle if I'm burnt out and that's my
[1735.74 - 1741.14] diagnosis after all those doctors what
[1738.26 - 1743.12] am I doing wrong what am I weak
[1741.14 - 1745.28] if you're fortunate enough to have the
[1743.12 - 1748.04] resources to take a sabbatical or a week
[1745.28 - 1750.70] I love that one take a year off are you
[1748.04 - 1750.70] kidding me
[1751.04 - 1757.06] uh sir ma'am
[1753.86 - 1760.18] take a year off you got burnout are you
[1757.06 - 1760.18] kidding me
[1762.38 - 1767.30] sorry
[1764.48 - 1769.34] I'm not a billionaire can't take a year
[1767.30 - 1771.02] off got a family to feed got everything
[1769.34 - 1773.00] else I mean I love when they throw that
[1771.02 - 1775.70] at people it's like insane
[1773.00 - 1777.86] Julie Greenwood says I could cry now
[1775.70 - 1781.12] this is God's scent
[1777.86 - 1781.12] God bless you by the way
[1781.88 - 1785.90] Emily says
[1783.68 - 1788.54] had a huge breakthrough with a friend
[1785.90 - 1791.06] who I recommended to take the stabilizer
[1788.54 - 1792.38] massive reduction in long-standing
[1791.06 - 1793.82] anxiety what you guys are gonna find
[1792.38 - 1795.62] that's incredible what you guys are
[1793.82 - 1798.02] gonna find is that these brain shot
[1795.62 - 1800.12] therapies are truly a miracle
[1798.02 - 1803.90] but you're also going to find this
[1800.12 - 1805.52] where there is light darkness comes
[1803.90 - 1808.10] where there is light
[1805.52 - 1810.56] a miracle a true Miracle Darkness
[1808.10 - 1811.88] doesn't like that
[1810.56 - 1813.68] you're going to get those incredible
[1811.88 - 1814.88] healing results but then the trolls are
[1813.68 - 1816.62] going to come in
[1814.88 - 1819.26] and then darkness is going to come in
[1816.62 - 1820.70] and try to like cancel it oh those shots
[1819.26 - 1823.28] don't work
[1820.70 - 1825.02] oh medical medium doesn't work oh those
[1823.28 - 1826.94] shots don't work get ready for all that
[1825.02 - 1829.34] crap because the power of the light and
[1826.94 - 1830.78] the power of what's in these books is
[1829.34 - 1832.70] gonna just it's it's unlike anything
[1830.78 - 1834.56] anybody's ever going to see No One's
[1832.70 - 1836.12] Gonna See brain shots work like these
[1834.56 - 1837.44] brain shots it does it's not going to
[1836.12 - 1839.60] exist
[1837.44 - 1841.82] Ellison said I did the dream shot last
[1839.60 - 1844.76] night and it's hard to explain how much
[1841.82 - 1846.50] it actually affected and felt
[1844.76 - 1848.18] you know I had an experience like that
[1846.50 - 1850.00] with my dream shot that I took it was
[1848.18 - 1853.28] great however
[1850.00 - 1854.78] what was most ironic was Anthony was in
[1853.28 - 1858.44] my dream
[1854.78 - 1860.60] it was very random but super ironic the
[1858.44 - 1863.02] first time I do that shot I appear in
[1860.60 - 1863.02] your dream
[1863.06 - 1866.96] Jenny Jan says through the trolls
[1864.74 - 1868.34] nothing beats results and results are
[1866.96 - 1870.08] going to be there people are going to
[1868.34 - 1871.64] have these miraculous results and then
[1870.08 - 1873.14] the darkness is going to want to step it
[1871.64 - 1875.36] up they're going to want to step up
[1873.14 - 1877.04] their game
[1875.36 - 1878.48] so there you know you guys already know
[1877.04 - 1881.12] there's paid campaigns against medical
[1878.48 - 1884.06] medium right
[1881.12 - 1887.00] it was talked about out there publicly
[1884.06 - 1889.76] by accident by people in an organization
[1887.00 - 1891.92] that we're building a campaign fit with
[1889.76 - 1893.90] lots of money fed by an organization to
[1891.92 - 1897.44] try to like dumb down all of this
[1893.90 - 1899.60] constantly with a lot of imposters too
[1897.44 - 1902.12] putting out a lot of Impostors so
[1899.60 - 1903.86] medical meeting Community is one badass
[1902.12 - 1906.26] community and I'll tell you why because
[1903.86 - 1908.42] you guys you know the crap you've gotten
[1906.26 - 1910.22] when you said oh medical media I mean he
[1908.42 - 1911.60] hears it from above and he hears it you
[1910.22 - 1913.04] guys know what you had to fight through
[1911.60 - 1914.90] and you know what your healing results
[1913.04 - 1916.22] are you know what's out there in the
[1914.90 - 1918.14] junk in the garbage out there in the
[1916.22 - 1921.02] health movement you guys are heroes to
[1918.14 - 1924.14] me Heroes to me
[1921.02 - 1926.30] by the way imposters look out for them
[1924.14 - 1927.74] they're out there
[1926.30 - 1931.04] they say they're Anthony William
[1927.74 - 1932.78] whatever they used my profile
[1931.04 - 1934.64] they act like they're me they want to
[1932.78 - 1935.66] constantly give you a consultation and
[1934.64 - 1938.18] they ask
[1935.66 - 1939.62] money and or not or they just do stupid
[1938.18 - 1942.34] terrible things and they DM people
[1939.62 - 1942.34] they're everywhere
[1942.56 - 1947.38] okay
[1944.24 - 1947.38] let's get back to work
[1948.32 - 1952.46] burnout should not be a sole diagnosis
[1950.78 - 1955.10] we should be diagnosed with the deeper
[1952.46 - 1957.02] issues at hand viral inflammation toxic
[1955.10 - 1959.78] heavy metals other poisons and solvents
[1957.02 - 1962.00] MSG deposits lack of glucose lack of
[1959.78 - 1963.74] mineral salts neuron problems injuries
[1962.00 - 1966.20] to neurons neurotransmitter deficiencies
[1963.74 - 1967.76] adrenal complications and vices that
[1966.20 - 1969.32] were brought Upon Us by the drug pushers
[1967.76 - 1971.78] such as the caffeine industry machine
[1969.32 - 1974.72] burnout should be seen as a complex
[1971.78 - 1977.30] interplay of factors leading us to run
[1974.72 - 1979.16] low on what our brains physically need
[1977.30 - 1981.76] to sustain and keep us
[1979.16 - 1981.76] safe
[1981.80 - 1987.14] so burnout stabilizer is addressing that
[1984.20 - 1989.98] but hitting it hard addressing that the
[1987.14 - 1989.98] powerful impact
[1991.70 - 1995.48] you guys I'm reading out a brand saver
[1993.32 - 1997.64] and brand saver protocols two books that
[1995.48 - 2000.10] were one book had to be split up into
[1997.64 - 2002.80] their two 600 page books

[2028.84 - 2033.28] greatest books of all time if you could
[2030.94 - 2036.54] just say that that would be incredible
[2033.28 - 2036.54] because it's the truth

[2128.44 - 2132.34] with me right now I get a lot of
[2130.96 - 2134.74] information
[2132.34 - 2136.36] so and that information shows me the
[2134.74 - 2137.62] struggle she went through

[2148.72 - 2152.02] everything that you went through like
[2150.16 - 2153.22] this from Spirit of compassion like all
[2152.02 - 2154.72] kinds of stuff and how many symptoms
[2153.22 - 2155.86] you've had and what you've struggled
[2154.72 - 2157.60] against
[2155.86 - 2160.08] just know that my heart pours out to you
[2157.60 - 2160.08] kiddo

[2164.80 - 2168.88] all right you guys
[2166.72 - 2171.10] we are once again in the burnout
[2168.88 - 2173.44] deficient brain section here supply and
[2171.10 - 2175.24] demand the brain is complex electrical
[2173.44 - 2177.28] grid that you know well by now by
[2175.24 - 2179.20] reading the brain saver books everything
[2177.28 - 2180.76] doesn't need to be perfect on that
[2179.20 - 2182.92] electrical grid that we have right here
[2180.76 - 2185.32] it doesn't have to be perfect we have
[2182.92 - 2187.78] room to play but if the supplies we need
[2185.32 - 2190.42] are dissipating it starts to tip the
[2187.78 - 2193.12] scale starts at tip to scale is what it
[2190.42 - 2194.92] does when we get in trouble once we see
[2193.12 - 2196.90] the sides okay here's here's here's the
[2194.92 - 2198.58] part that here's the part that bothered
[2196.90 - 2201.10] me that Spirit of compassion put in the
[2198.58 - 2203.08] book because it's truth but it just was
[2201.10 - 2205.90] like oh bummer
[2203.08 - 2208.24] once we see the signs we're already deep
[2205.90 - 2209.68] in it that's why we have to do some
[2208.24 - 2211.66] serious healing we need the burnout
[2209.68 - 2213.70] stabilizer we need all of this we need
[2211.66 - 2216.34] the brain shots we need the heavy metal
[2213.70 - 2217.66] detox cleanses we need all of this we
[2216.34 - 2219.10] need the celery juice we need the
[2217.66 - 2222.28] medical medium tools that are saving
[2219.10 - 2223.90] lives once we see the signs we're
[2222.28 - 2225.52] already deep in it you know when Spirit
[2223.90 - 2227.44] of compassion told me that and I was in
[2225.52 - 2229.96] my office burning a hole in the chair
[2227.44 - 2231.88] you guys know
[2229.96 - 2232.56] sure it was like probably three in the
[2231.88 - 2235.30] morning
[2232.56 - 2236.98] once I heard that once we see the signs
[2235.30 - 2239.68] he said you have to put this in it he
[2236.98 - 2241.54] goes once we see the signs we're already
[2239.68 - 2243.46] deep in it and that made me think about
[2241.54 - 2245.08] oh my God that's how much work we have
[2243.46 - 2246.46] to do and that's why sometimes it takes
[2245.08 - 2248.92] a little longer for people to heal
[2246.46 - 2251.44] because they're so deep in it but the
[2248.92 - 2253.90] brain shots help us get there faster now
[2251.44 - 2255.82] boom like lightning it's like that
[2253.90 - 2258.24] instant relief even pick it up quicker
[2255.82 - 2258.24] and faster
[2258.40 - 2263.62] okay what our brains are missing let's
[2260.74 - 2265.60] go into that for a couple minutes too
[2263.62 - 2267.16] but I feel an intermission coming along

[2359.56 - 2363.88] then he told me the news about eggs
[2361.90 - 2365.92] I told her to compassion I wanted to
[2363.88 - 2366.94] have an egg Shack cook eggs for

[2397.90 - 2402.34] up and put them in a
[2400.36 - 2405.76] sausage skit and

[2405.76 - 2408.36] all right
[2409.48 - 2413.68] because I'm human too you know

[3193.56 - 3197.94] it are you guys do you have your juicers
[3194.94 - 3199.62] out by the way the mm-1500
[3197.94 - 3201.54] just letting you guys know and I forgot
[3199.62 - 3204.12] to tell you the other day not only is it

[3213.48 - 3219.78] almost it's incredible it makes sorbets
[3217.38 - 3221.70] this isn't this just a juicer but what's
[3219.78 - 3222.66] incredible about it is when you juice
[3221.70 - 3224.46] through it
[3222.66 - 3226.26] it's got that high compression and you
[3224.46 - 3228.84] squeeze all that juice out and you save
[3226.26 - 3230.28] money it's incredible
[3228.84 - 3232.26] there's a lot of tricky juicers out
[3230.28 - 3234.36] there you know the sharks are coming in
[3232.26 - 3235.50] trying to sell people to juicers now and
[3234.36 - 3237.12] they're all getting ripped off because
[3235.50 - 3238.68] they're spying all this produce and
[3237.12 - 3240.66] they're only getting so much juice it's
[3238.68 - 3242.94] terrible how much I see I've seen it too
[3240.66 - 3245.28] on social media I see people using those
[3242.94 - 3246.96] juicers the bad ones and I see them
[3245.28 - 3249.00] putting in a ton of produce to make a
[3246.96 - 3250.50] big vat of juice but the amount of
[3249.00 - 3251.88] produce they put in they have no idea
[3250.50 - 3253.80] they would have had to only use a
[3251.88 - 3255.42] fraction of that half of that or
[3253.80 - 3258.48] whatever to actually do what they got to
[3255.42 - 3262.26] do this is the Omega mm-1500
[3258.48 - 3263.76] right and mm-900 both these I work I
[3262.26 - 3265.32] endorse both these I worked with the
[3263.76 - 3266.64] company and endorsed both these models
[3265.32 - 3269.36] they're incredibly safe people money
[3266.64 - 3269.36] just want to tell you
[3270.12 - 3277.02] Gohan says Anthony and SOC 10 years ago
[3274.14 - 3281.10] I was diagnosed with brain illness

[3299.88 - 3304.32] first place
[3301.56 - 3305.94] it's just incredible the doctors were
[3304.32 - 3308.58] baffled by this
[3305.94 - 3311.52] two years symptom-free and this was
[3308.58 - 3314.16] before I purchased seven
[3311.52 - 3316.08] and eight books

[3761.46 - 3765.18] ago this morning routines and cleansea
[3763.08 - 3767.16] heel are sick those are insane they help
[3765.18 - 3770.22] so many people I love your brain shots
[3767.16 - 3772.86] the piece I get is priceless
[3770.22 - 3775.74] thanks Anthony and SSC God bless you
[3772.86 - 3776.82] it takes a certain person
[3775.74 - 3779.58] right
[3776.82 - 3781.14] to really like to trust and it takes a
[3779.58 - 3783.48] certain person
[3781.14 - 3785.10] to know what they're seeing and to
[3783.48 - 3786.90] understand and it takes a certain person
[3785.10 - 3788.22] who's been through hell and back like
[3786.90 - 3790.20] you guys have been through hell and back
[3788.22 - 3792.12] to know what you have in your hands and
[3790.20 - 3793.98] understand this information and
[3792.12 - 3795.90] understand what's going on
[3793.98 - 3797.64] it was a diet there's a registered
[3795.90 - 3799.44] dietitian or whatever
[3797.64 - 3801.36] spouting out all kinds of crappy stuff
[3799.44 - 3802.32] about me the other day like saying
[3801.36 - 3806.10] things like
[3802.32 - 3807.78] science can't prove this works
[3806.10 - 3808.86] saying like science can't prove this
[3807.78 - 3810.18] worse what are you talking about first
[3808.86 - 3811.68] of all science takes medical meme
[3810.18 - 3814.08] information all the time
[3811.68 - 3816.84] but she's also saying something like
[3814.08 - 3818.88] science can't prove how it works just
[3816.84 - 3821.52] because a
[3818.88 - 3823.26] Spirit of sun sort is giving him the
[3821.52 - 3825.24] information doesn't mean it works I mean
[3823.26 - 3827.46] this person was saying this
[3825.24 - 3829.26] so does that make any sense like science
[3827.46 - 3831.30] can't prove that medical medium
[3829.26 - 3833.46] information doesn't work
[3831.30 - 3835.38] okay Millions healing with all the
[3833.46 - 3836.64] information and science can't prove it
[3835.38 - 3838.56] doesn't work but they're not trying to
[3836.64 - 3840.90] prove anything anyway
[3838.56 - 3843.06] but this person was like if medical
[3840.90 - 3844.20] medium information worked science would
[3843.06 - 3846.48] say so
[3844.20 - 3848.46] really like does that make any sense
[3846.48 - 3850.20] like Signs would say so
[3848.46 - 3852.24] but the point is she wasn't making any
[3850.20 - 3855.30] sense she was like over and over again
[3852.24 - 3857.16] it was ridiculous anyway guys
[3855.30 - 3858.78] medical research in science doesn't know
[3857.16 - 3860.70] medical meme information because it's
[3858.78 - 3864.12] Advanced it's far ahead of its time by
[3860.70 - 3865.50] light years 50 100 years long after I'm
[3864.12 - 3867.48] gone
[3865.50 - 3869.76] this information will still be the
[3867.48 - 3871.86] Forefront of the healing movement people
[3869.76 - 3873.36] will find their way to the books and
[3871.86 - 3875.64] research in science will still be in the
[3873.36 - 3879.30] Dark Ages with mystery chronic illness
[3875.64 - 3882.36] and the funny thing is remember
[3879.30 - 3884.40] the cause of multiple sclerosis
[3882.36 - 3886.56] was taught by me for decades and
[3884.40 - 3888.00] published years ago and Harvard took
[3886.56 - 3889.20] that information and they published it
[3888.00 - 3891.30] just recently
[3889.20 - 3893.40] saying that Epstein-Barr causes Ms I
[3891.30 - 3895.26] already beat him to it many years and I
[3893.40 - 3897.66] also showed everybody the details of how
[3895.26 - 3899.76] it happens far Advanced information from
[3897.66 - 3902.10] Spirit and compassion
[3899.76 - 3903.72] about what's wrong with this and how we
[3902.10 - 3905.34] Heal The credibility is there the street
[3903.72 - 3907.38] cred is there
[3905.34 - 3909.00] so when a dietitian says celery doesn't
[3907.38 - 3910.92] work
[3909.00 - 3912.60] or you should eat a celery stick instead
[3910.92 - 3914.82] of Juiced it it's just actually insane

[4030.62 - 4035.06] can you believe it that's from the high
[4032.90 - 4037.58] compression over here that's from making
[4035.06 - 4040.06] sure you're squeezing all the juice out
[4037.58 - 4040.06] of your
[4040.16 - 4043.22] your resources so you're not wasting
[4042.38 - 4045.14] money
[4043.22 - 4046.64] and you're actually putting money back
[4045.14 - 4048.68] into the machine the machine pays for
[4046.64 - 4051.02] itself and then pays for itself over and
[4048.68 - 4052.64] over again saving money while juicing in
[4051.02 - 4054.98] a in an environment today where food
[4052.64 - 4056.96] costs are up you're juicing your herbs
[4054.98 - 4058.76] and your leafy greens
[4056.96 - 4060.32] and all of that you're making your brain
[4058.76 - 4062.18] shots and you're saving money at the
[4060.32 - 4065.72] same time that can only be done with the
[4062.18 - 4067.76] mm 1500 and mm-900 so the juicer sharks
[4065.72 - 4069.68] out there are ripping people off
[4067.76 - 4072.20] and they're spending so much more money

[4091.58 - 4096.14] bunch of imposters
