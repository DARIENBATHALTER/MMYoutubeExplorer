well let me tell you something because

28
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,399
what happens is people don't realize it

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,239
but they're dumping all kinds of stuff

30
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,879
in their trash can every single day

31
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,520
right and it's like nah nah nah i'll eat

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,680

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,159
maybe i'll eat better i'll eat better

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,400
i'll start january 1st

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,600
guys when's january 1st

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,240
when is it like 11 months from now i'll

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,400
start then i'll start january 1st i

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,479
missed this january 1st

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,080
so i don't want to start now i think

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,479
i'll just go for the rest of the year

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,520
and then maybe i'll start working on my

43
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,799
diet

44
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,799
january 1st 2023

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,360
but anyway

46
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,560
talking about the gut we're talking

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,079
about what's going on with the gut

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,520
everybody's got why there's problems why

49
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,520
there's not problems and everything talk

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,479
about autoimmune

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,200
because autoimmune

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:52,240
isn't related to your gut so much

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,119
but yet autoimmune tends to get worse

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,040
right

55
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,040
as we're dumping all kinds of stuff and

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,719
garbage in our guts but there's the

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,920
relations are not what people think

58
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,840
we're going to cover that for a little

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,600
bit too you guys

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,719
the mm-900 hds is on sale not for much

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,160

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,599

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,680
automatically come up 71

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,239
98 cents savings

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,920
and food food is going up food prices

71
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,200
i'm hearing every day people i know

72
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,959
they're like oh my god you know what the

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,239
food cost me the other day

74
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,879
you know what all that you know what all

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,239
that meat cost me the other day you know

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,280
you know what everything cost me the

77
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,080
other day food's going up up up

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,319
but

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,319
when food goes up prices go right food

80
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,840
food prices go up food shortages happen

81
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,440
food prices go up whatever is happening

82
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,640
right now inflation's happening right

83
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,480
all of that

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
and so what i like about the mm-900 you

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,400
squeeze more juice out people swear by

86
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,879
it i swear by it you squeeze more juice

87
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
out you save a lot of money as the year

88
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
goes on you save more money you save

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,319
more money i'm gonna juice some celery

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
because celery juice is critical for the

91
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,280
trash can

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,080
because what that's what's happening

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,000
with everybody we're dumping crap in our

94
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
trash can all the time

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,040
how many of these have you had maybe it

96
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,720
doesn't look like this maybe it was

97
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,400
different maybe it was homemade maybe it

98
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,120
was some other kind of way you did it

99
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,280
but we we really filled that can

100
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,680
how many diners have you how many people

101
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,599
were shit-faced during college and maybe

102
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
maybe even after college whatever and

103
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,799
they're in the diner and they're tanking

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,319
a whole bunch of bacon a whole bunch of

105
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,000
stuff and everything else how many

106
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,200
people are doing that right all this

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,200
time

108
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,120
and so and it's not even just that it's

109
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,599
pizza every day it's everything else

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,080
kelly beeton says love my juicer

doing you think anybody really gives a

197
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,080
 about anybody's chronically ill

198
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080
that could be like wait a minute celery

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,039
juice i heard about it does it really

200
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,440
work

201
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,919
yeah it really works right

202
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,560
but hey that's how it works out there

203
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,160
the sales on a couple more days on the

204
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,599
mm-900

205
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,319
71.98 i told you guys i would never talk

206
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,360
about that juicer unless it was on sale

207
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,639
because

208
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,919
that's the bottom line i want you to be

209
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,680
able to afford it i want you to be able

210
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,199
to be able to get it if you need to get

211
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,120
if you're using some other juicer use it

212
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,560
if you've got a juicer that you're using

213
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
keep it and use it i'm going to talk

214
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,319
about how that saves us money

215
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,599
what that does what celery juice does

216
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
and how critical that is i'm talking

217
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,680
about the trash can right now too

218
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,240
because what we do is we dump all kinds

219
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,199
of stuff inside this trash can

220
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,440
and

221
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,240
this trash can is important to us right

222
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,720
here this is not the normal trash can

223
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,360
this one's important to us

224
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
we beat down and kill our livers is what

225
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,639
we do

226
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,479
we blow up our stomachs and destroy our

227
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,000
stomachs and stomach glands is what we

228
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,599
do okay

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,479
we injure and and annihilate our colons

230
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,720
too is what we do boom right we kill our

231
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,879
small intestinal tracts we don't even

232
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,599
know it boom right

233
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,160
and we become a mess is what happens

234
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,720
everything ferments in here everything

235
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,879
starts to fall apart in here we got

236
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,560
resilience your body's got resilience

237
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,120
right we can

238
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,479
our bodies are tough our bodies want to

239
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,960
recover they want to do the right thing

240
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,479
but we tend to

241
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,800
through just the course of life because

242
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,800
life is hard life is not easy we tend to

243
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,080
do things that we're not supposed to hey

244
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,919
we're not taught

245
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
no one's being taught to do things that

246
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,560
can be really helpful instead they're

247
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,080
being taught to do something that's

248
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,680
actually harmful that happens all the

249
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,440
time you guys know i talk about that all

250
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,840
the time out there

251
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,599
so let's go into it a little bit right

252
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,800
your stomach

253
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,839
critical

254
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,000
organ

255
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,320
right there your stomach is critical so

256
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,039
let's go into that a little bit so when

257
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,640
it comes down to your stomach right

258
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,600
one thing that's really important to

259
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,440
know

260
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
is we can destroy the stump the stomach

261
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,680
glands inside your stomach these little

262
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,360
glands that produce your gastric acid

263
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,480
your gastric acid is your defense

264
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,880
mechanism

265
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,360
to stop the bugs

266
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
if your hydrochloric acid is really

267
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,000
strong

268
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,519
really strong

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,680
it will kill

270
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,279
a case of mono

271
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,320
before the mono can even start

272
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,519
so if you kiss somebody with

273
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,279
mononucleosis which is epstein-barr

274
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,120
fresh infection

275
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,360
and you kiss them

276
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
and they pass that epstein-barr virus

277
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,120
into your mouth

278
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,560
as you're kissing them

279
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,760
you're making out with them that

280
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,720
epstein-barr virus goes into your mouth

281
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
say you're just drinking off of

282
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
somebody's glass yeah i'll share that

283
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,560
glass with you

284
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,399
sure

285
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:42,720
right and boom now you got mononucleosis

286
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:45,120
if your hcl is strong really strong

287
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,120
it will kill and destroy that

288
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,519
epstein-barr virus before it can take

289
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,600
hold or take root

290
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,800
so as that epstein-barr virus

291
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,720
goes into the mouth into your spit

292
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,839
and then you swallow that epstein-barr

293
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,920
virus with your spit down your esophagus

294
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,640
down your throat down your esophagus and

295
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,880
that spit ends up inside your stomach

296
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,279
with an epstein-barr virus

297
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,040
your hcl will kill the epstein-barr

298
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,040
virus so you don't catch mono

299
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,680
but no one's stomach acid is that strong

300
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,200
no one's gastric glands are that strong

301
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,839
it's rare really rare the world beats us

302
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,079
down the bad food beats us down

303
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,399
life beats us down

304
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,480
all kinds of things beat us down vinegar

305
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,959
can kill that uh that opportunity for

306
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
anybody if you're tank and vinegar

307
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,120
apple cider vinegar is so good for you

308
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,519
meanwhile boom you destroy your stomach

309
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,720
lands and then the toxic fragrances beat

310
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,800
our own

311
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,000
body systems down the chemical warfare

312
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,720
the sea trails beat us down not allowed

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,360
to say that word you know there's

314
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,760
so much that breaks us down the mosquito

315
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,640
spray they spray on every state in the

316
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,880
united states every town every village

317
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,480
in the united states they dump mosquito

318
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,360
spray on it all year long out of

319
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,440
helicopters on your children on your

320
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,959
babies on you

321
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,320
purposely

322
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,079
it's nothing to do with mosquitoes

323
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,440
because mosquitoes never die

324
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,440
mosquitoes are there for eternity

325
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,880
the point is we're up against so much

326
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,399
and it beats down our systems this is

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,640
not our fault

328
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,839
it's not our fault celery juice is

329
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,480
critical to bringing us back you have to

330
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,120
get the hcl strong you guys

331
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,000
it's not a joke it's not you know what's

332
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,160
sad

333
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,560
it's a lot of people partaking in celery

334
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,360

335
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,800
selfishly

336
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,839
right

337
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,279
because

338
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,120
and there's a lot of people that are

339
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,959

celery juice

466
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,440
helps to bring that back if you're

467
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,480
somebody that had two blood tests two

468
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,360

470
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
from blood leading

471
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,240
they take the blood from you it can take

472
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,240
six months to recover your white blood

473
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,959
cells just so you know we're where the

474
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,880

blood cells that's why celery juice is

477
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,440
critical all on its own

478
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,440
green juice isn't gonna do that

479
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,959
celery juice does that the trace mineral

480
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,720
salts the sodium cluster salts it's one

481
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,920
aspect of celery juice really important

482
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,759
to know most people already have a

483
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,440
weakened broken down immune system and

484
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,199
they're getting blood work over and over

485
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,040
again and it's weakening more weakening

486
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,120
them more and they're not getting any

487
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,920
celery juice in you the one way to

488
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,320
escape that torturous situation of being

489
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,320
in a vicious cycle of getting your life

490
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,839
robbed from you from blood taken from

491
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,320
you is making sure you're putting

492
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,079
something back in to save your life and

493
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,480
that's why celery juice is critical you

494
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,640
had a blood test once every year

495
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,120
you still need the celery juice

496
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,199
georgiana says you had it in september

497
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,039

they pull the blood out of you you get

500
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,720
weakened from it and we don't put

501
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,679
anything back to try to curve that

502
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,600
balance to try to shape that balance is

503
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,760
what happens it's very important to know

504
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,280

505
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,120
critical but one really important reason

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,400
to put back in the tank that's critical

540
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,080
well the well the doctor said at the

541
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,640
doctor's office the nurse practitioner

542
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,559
said to just eat a lot when i got home

543
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,799
just eat whatever just make sure i eat a

544
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,559

critically needed your doctor and your

550
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,120
practitioner and the nurse practitioner

551
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,200
didn't tell you to go start celery juice

552
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,520

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,760
my family a lot of money that's what i

577
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,720
love right that's why i endorse the

578
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,640
machine

579
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,240
so

580
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,160
let's see if we got it plugged in right

581
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,520
here we do what i love about it it's

582
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,910
quiet

583
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,080
it's quiet it's not going

584
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,559
[Music]

585
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,720
it's not doing something like that

586
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,120
it's not making these crazy noises so

587
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,760
what what happens is i'm up usually

588
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,559
really late at night right i'm working

589
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,840
working working or i get up really early

590
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,600
in the morning or i never went to bed

591
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,280
because i was working all night and i

592
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,120
want to get the juicer going and i want

593
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,200
to get the celery going so i'll start

594
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,400
juicing at five in the morning six in

595
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,400
the morning and i don't want to wake up

596
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,240
the house this machine doesn't wake up

597
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,240
the house and that's what's really

598
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,760
important too it doesn't leak up

599
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,440
everybody and that's that's a big deal

600
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,919
so

601
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,000
slow masticating juicer it's a cold

602
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
pressed juicer that's what it is

603
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:55,280
71.98 off

604
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:59,520
it's this is a medical device

605
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,520
it's a medical device is what it is

606
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,080
medical devices

607
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,080
don't have to be

608
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,240
a pacemaker

609
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,280
they can be

610
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,880
an herbal extractor

611
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,640
because before you get to that pacemaker

612
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,480
in your life

613
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,200
before you end up

614
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,679
having to get a pacemaker

615
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
if you use an herbal extractor medical

616
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,600
device

617
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,080
earlier in your life

618
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,960
taking care of your heart with celery

619
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,280
juice

620
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,280
so that you don't have to end up with a

621
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,039
pacemaker i mean that's the last thing

622
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,360
you want to do i'll have to get a

623
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,559
pacemaker prop

624
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,960
you don't want to end up with a

625
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,080
pacemaker jennifer king says i can't

626
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,919
believe

627
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,559
to tell you how celery juice has helped

628
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,720
me and it's been two weeks jennifer

so

633
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,120
i'm so proud of you so what i like about

634
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,520
medical devices herbal extractors

635
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,000
it's a device you want to use before you

636
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,000
get real sick you know what i mean oh

637
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,679

638
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,520

639
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,000
symptoms i got tingles and numbness

640
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,640
aches and pains i got eye floaters my

641
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,120
skin's getting really bad and chewed up

642
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,200
i got acne i think it's acne the doctor

643
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,280
doesn't know what it is that's bumping

644
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,559
up on my face i got all these different

645
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,480
problems

646
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,480
maybe it's time to get

647
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
a medical device

648
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,840
in

649
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,880
maybe i can get a medical device before

650
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:46,000
someday i have to get a medical device

651
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,840
the bummer kind of medical devices right

652
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,440
something like that

653
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,280
so

654
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,120
one of the things i love about celery

655
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,039
juice

656
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,559
trace mineral salts

657
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,559
get absorbed into your heart muscle

658
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,000
muscles

659
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,440
i know everybody's worried about muscles

660
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,799
they're trying to build up their muscles

661
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,799
dudes are always trying to build up

662
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,559
their muscles right dudes are in the gym

663
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,000
like if they can if they got the luxury

664
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,760
and they don't have to work like a

665
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,480
billion hours a week

666
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,000
if

667
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,600
if there are some dudes that got the

668
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,360
luxury and they can work out in the gym

669
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,120
every single day and they can go and do

670
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,400
an hour or two in the gym they want to

671
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,480
build up their muscles right

672
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,640
well

673
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,799
what happens is that trace mineral salts

674
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,640
are critical for muscles to sustain

675
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,720
themselves and build up your heart is a

676
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,080
muscle so trace mineral salts from

677
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,400
celery juice goes into the heart

678
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,360
what i love about

679
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,520
what i love about celery juice right

680
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,559
it's the cleaner

681
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,760
that goes into the heart valves and

682
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,520
cleans the edges of the valves it cleans

683
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,520
the edges

684
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,200
so what it does is it cleans the edges

685
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,919
of the valves

686
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,679
the edges of the valves get gunked up

687
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,240
like your drain you know what i mean so

688
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,480
i got the sink right here okay

689
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,640
i'm running it right now okay

690
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
that water is going down the drain right

691
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,760
now so on my in my sink right now the

692
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,320
water's going down the drain okay

693
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,480
what happens our bloodstream is our

694
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,880
water right that's our bloodstream

695
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,039
that's our water and it gets gunked up

696
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,960
with toxins and garbage

697
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,279
and as it gets gunked up with toxins and

698
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,400
garbage it ends up in here ends up into

699
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,840
the ventricles it ends up into the heart

700
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,279
valves

701
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,640
all that gunk ends up in there

702
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,400
celery juice

703
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,320
is that cleaner

704
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,000
to the heart valves

705
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,559
yeah you know if you're not that bad

706
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,559
often you just get a better diet

707
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,559
your blood pressure will go down you get

708
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,480
rid of your processed food you should do

709
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,559
all right but if you got bigger problems

710
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,640
than that

711
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,880
celery juice is critical for it or if

712
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,919
you want to prevent bigger

713
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,279
problems celery juice

714
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,600
is there for you so that's something

715
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,320
right there so i was going into

716
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,080
going into the heart a little bit too so

717
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,960
let's head into

718
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,960
adrenals

719
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,919
but you know what if we're going to go

720
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,120
into the heart we're going to talk about

721
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,840
veins and we're going to talk about

722
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,360
arteries varicose veins

723
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,679
all those veins

724
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,840
right that nobody likes to get nobody

725
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,159
likes to get those varicose veins nobody

726
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,120
likes to get spider veins that's from

727
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,799
the liver not being cleaned up

728
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,720
for years and years everybody's on the

729
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,440
high fat diets

730
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,200
and the liver gets stagnant sluggish the

731
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,760
liver gets toxic it's filled with

732
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,679
pathogens and garbage and metals and

733
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,200
what happens is your veins just start

734
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,600
blowing up

735
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,080
everybody's veins start blowing up they

736
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,240
get the varicose veins they grow veins

737
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,320
the veins start to expand the veins

738
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,720
start to weaken the veins start to

739
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,960
collapse as well that happens to people

740
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,960
too

741
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,480
elias says how much celery juice a day

742
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,799
do you recommend 16 ounces on an empty

743
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,600
stomach every single morning if you can

744
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,640
i would go up to 32 ounces

745
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,240
if you got some other stuff going on if

746
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,240
you got some things happening in your

747
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,679
life you want to push it up to 32 ounces

748
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,080
now for years and years and years i said

749
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,880
16 ounces i've also told people they go

750
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,039
to 32 to get 64 ounces you can do you do

751
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,039
64 ounces right

752
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,159
and i told people to do that for years

753
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,960
but i'm going to tell you right now the

754
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,480
world is changing this world is becoming

755
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,120
a very

756
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
disturbing place for a lot of reasons

757
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,760
right

758
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,400
i won't go into a lot of those reasons

759
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,880
because you can't you actually can't

760
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,720
i'll lose all contact with your boss but

761
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,640
what happens is the world is a really

762
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,120
disturbing place

763
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,039
and so our bodies are taking that heat

764
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,559
for taking the stress they're taking the

765
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,559
garbage and clothing around and taking

766
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,919
the fragrances they're taking you know

767
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,480
the chemicals are taking the

768
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,159
insecticides right they're taking all

769
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,440
this bad stuff all the time and that's

770
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,320
what's happening they're taking

771
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,080
everything out of the sun and so we also

772
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,559
it's not even just about eating bad

773
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,559
foods or eating good foods it eats more

774
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,919
than that right truly disturbing i know

775
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:14,880
the ring it's truly disturbing really

776
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,440
what you'll notice about the mm-900

777
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,080
it's quiet i can talk to you guys while

779
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,080
like i'm screaming over you guys either

780
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,080
right so we're live right now on tick

781
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,080
tock live on rumble facebook youtube

782
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,559
telegram

783
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,080
debbie gale says no you want just celery

784
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,360
juice with nothing at it don't add

785
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,880
anything to your celery just do a

786
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,799
separate juice

787
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,200
do a separate juice now what i do with

788
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,120
the mm-900 is i like to run greens

789
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,679
through the mm-9002 so what i'll do is

790
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,240
i'll do my celery juice now right i'll

791
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,320
have my celery juice with nothing mixed

792
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,840
into it no apples no greens no nothing

793
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,960
mixed into it you want it to have the

794
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,279
power it's an herb that has to be alone

795
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,200
by itself to turn your life around to

796
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,559
turn your life around you guys but what

797
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,279
happens is

798
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,360
i'll make another juice later with the

799
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,279
mm 900

800
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,279
i'll throw a couple of kale leaves in

801
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,200
there and then throw some celery in

802
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,960
there i'll throw some spinach in here

803
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,640
some celery

804
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,799
i'll throw i'll throw i'll throw some

805
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,159
parsley in here and some celery

806
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,600
it's incredible the machine is

807
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,760
incredible so i like doing some leafy

808
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,360
greens mixed with stuff but that is

809
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,559
different medicine

810
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,880
this is

811
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,960
the medicine that changes lives and

812
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,399
moves the needle when celery juice it's

813
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,120
by itself

814
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,559
nothing else compares

815
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,679
and that's what's incredible about it

816
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,200
that's why people are getting their

817
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,200
lives back which is so nice

818
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,480
so i just did some juicing right there

819
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,640
i got a nice thing of juice

820
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,080
it's not the most fibrous celery which

821
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,000
is really great because you know you get

822
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,039
less the fiber is not like filling up

823
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,840
but the irony is

824
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,200
that's my pulp

825
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,080
do you guys see that

826
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,600
that wasn't a camera trick

827
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,200
it's not always like this there's just

828
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,720
sometimes there's more pulp than this i

829
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,399
mean you guys know with the mm-900 you

830
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,840
get more pulp because the celery might

831
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,679
have more fiber

832
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,679
right but the point is is that's how

833
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,520
insane that is

834
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,480
i think about this

835
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,880
right germ theory i know you always i

836
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,480
know you're always talking smack about

837
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,840
a medical medium all the time so it's

838
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,600
still great to have you on here by the

839
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,520
way but i know on youtube you always

840
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,039
leave messages like

841
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,960
the medical medium doesn't know what

842
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,919
he's talking about

843
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,399
medical medium has no idea how anything

844
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,399
works the medical term theory it's good

845
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,880
to have you here but your gym theory

846
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,799
just so you know i'm holding

847
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,600
pulp that's dry

848
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,919
that's dry pulp okay it's not soaking

849
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,840
wet like where you're squeezing

850
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,120
constantly squeezing out juice or you're

851
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,640
trying to run the pulp back in the

852
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,559
machine right

853
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,640
but that's dry pulp

854
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,840
that's how you're saving money right

855
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,760
there

856
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,000

poor lobsters

943
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,919
this poor lobsters

944
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,000
sitting there

945
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,399
they're all in there they were ripped

946
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,640
out of the ocean

947
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,640
they were pulled up by a lobster trap

948
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,039
ripped out of the ocean and now they're

949
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,559
in a store tank they're all sitting down

950
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,480
there like this and they're all just

951
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,120
depressed they got rubber bands on their

952
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,840
claws right okay

953
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,000
those lobsters are non-stop

954
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,320
so they just go in a bathroom

955
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and that everything and all their all

956
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,519
the stuff the excrement that's coming

957
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,320
out of those lobsters

958
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,960
right

959
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,880
you know that you know that but you know

960
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,279
that trail that's in the tail if

961
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,360
you've ever had lobster right so all

962
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,960
that's coming out of the lobster and it

963
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,000
has to go somewhere so it goes into a

964
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,919
filter

965
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,919
so those big tanks in the supermarkets

966
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,080
have this filter the filter's sucking

967
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,919
all that up

968
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,080
that's your liver

969
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,480
your liver sitting there

970
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,559
inside your body right now sucking all

971
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,399
that garbage up so what is it sucking up

972
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,600
it's sucking up the gas fumes at the gas

973
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,559
station

974
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,399
you like the smell of that gasoline

975
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,480
smells good

976
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,600
okay i got the pump in

977
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,799
yeah smells like gasoline

978
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,000
hey man

979
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,120
this gasoline is knocking me out

980
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,960
hey

981
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,720
give me a couch

982
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,919
i think you'll roll a doobie now right

983
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,359
like that's what it is it's like

984
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,040
literally can knock you out it can get

985
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,679
you stuck so that's what gasoline fumes

986
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,240
can do you smell gasoline too long it

987
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,000
can really hurt you it can set you in a

988
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,159
bad direction

989
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,480
that goes into your liver all the gas

990
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,200
fumes you've ever breathed in sit inside

991
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,960
the liver for a lifetime and then become

992
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,200
a cancer because they end up feeding

993
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,119
a virus eventually inside your body now

994
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,320
you've got liver cancer now you've got

995
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,159
another cancer now you got whatever so

996
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,280
it's important to know that whatever

997
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,720
we're actually getting so many toxins

998
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,399
inside of us all the time but what do we

999
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,320
do to clear them out what are we doing

1000
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,520
to get that stuff out of us how are we

1001
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,679
blowing that out of us

1002
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,879
celery juice is one of the ways it's one

1003
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,839
of the tools

1004
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,079
so

1005
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,880

1006
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,000

juice is so important why i'm always

1030
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,000
like celery juice or juice because

1031
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,359
because it's so easy on the system for

1032
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,880
everybody's

1033
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,079

they did everything wrong with their

1042
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,640
guts

1043
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,400
they got e coli c diff

1044
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,599
they got old salmonella just floating

1045
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,160
around in there they got everything

1046
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,079
under the sun in there and it's time to

1047
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,119
kind of get that cleaned up start to

1048
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,880
restore that garbage jump that we have

1049
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,359
inside of us right

1050
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,520
it's incredible how it works

1051
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,560
people are worried about food costs

1052
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,240
they're worried about it okay and and so

1053
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,599
that's one thing right there and that's

1054
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,720
the thing about especially with the

1055
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,720
tough times people are worried about

1056
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,359
tough times worried about food costs

1057
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,079
i'd like to save money

1058
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,480
basically with another juicer that

1059
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,480
probably would have been that much juice

1060
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,400
some juicers that much juice

1061
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,920
there's a lot of juicers with the

1062
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,599
centrifuge

1063
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,040
that centrifuge right the metal

1064
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,800
centrifuge

1065
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,640
i probably would say it would get this

1066
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,920
much juice out of what i just ran

1067
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,599
through there you see what i'm showing

1068
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,839
you guys right now so i'm showing you

1069
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,280
like one inch here of juice right one

1070
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,160
inch here of juice is two inches of

1071
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,359
juice right here how many ounces that is

1072
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,800
okay

1073
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,800
so and then there's some juicers you'd

1074
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
probably get that much out of

1075
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,560
there's some juicers you might get that

1076
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,839
much out of look i'm not saying every

1077
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,960
juicer out there you're gonna get this

1078
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,320
much juice where you're only getting

1079
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,920
like two inches juice which is only

1080
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,520
getting like three four ounces of juice

1081
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,839
to how much celery i just ran through

1082
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,560
here i'm not saying that

1083
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,160
but

1084
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,720
someone else could have run that much

1085
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,880
celery through in a juicer and maybe got

1086
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,880
that much right maybe they got that much

1087
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,160
but they're not going to get this much

1088
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,320
some juicers this much some juicers this

1089
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,160
much some juicers this much some juicers

1090
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,839
may be here

1091
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,280
but every bit counts because it's a

1092
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,880
whole other half a head of salt a

1093
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,320
quarter head of celery or three more

1094
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,000
sticks and then three more sticks adds

1095
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,480
up three more six adds up three more

1096
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,640
sticks adds up and since we're on evil

1097
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,560
planet earth

1098
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,760
eventually

1099
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,359
they're probably getting you know down

1100
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,520
the road 20 years from now they're going

1101
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,720
to be messing with celery give it like

1102
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,680
they're gonna be like you know it's

1103
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,040
always going to be like

1104
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,560
i don't know

1105
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,880
cars would be driving down the street

1106
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,400
with a little thing on top somebody be

1107
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,280
in there like you're only allowed two

1108
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,119
sticks of celery per day

1109
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,880

1141
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,839
liver wants to live it wants to stay

1142
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,839
alive it doesn't want to be transplanted

1143
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,200
your liver doesn't want to be removed it

1144
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,560
doesn't want to be taken out of the body

1145
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,240
it doesn't want to die it doesn't want

1146
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,400
to be transplanted it wants wants to

1147
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,000
stay alive and it loves you and so what

1148
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,920
it does is it just needs a little help

1149
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,160
and a little love back that's what

1150
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,520
celery juice does for it

1151
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,240
i'm going to talk about the adrenals for

1152
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,760
a couple of seconds too you guys

1153
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,040

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,160
in this world

1155
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,079
you will get that's a guarantee

1156
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,839
let's talk into a doctor friend of mine

1157
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,160
who likes to he's like a philosopher

1158
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,000
he's like

1159
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,400
i've heard this a billion times out

1160
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,280
there but he but he said it anyway

1161
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,240
right

1162
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,560
he said

1163
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,319
there's only one certainty in life and

1164
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,680
i'm like what is it like i didn't know

1165
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,880
what he's gonna say

1166
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,960
what is it

1167
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,240
he's an old surgeon and he's like

1168
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,200
death

1169
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,240
that's the only certainty in life

1170
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,760
i said well

1171
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,440
i'll tell you one certainty in life he's

1172
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,280
like what is it

1173
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,440
what is it

1174
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,280
that this world is gonna

1175
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,280
f up your adrenals really bad

1176
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,200
that's a certainty in life here

1177
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,119
whether we're taught to play excessively

1178
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,440
whether we're taught to do a whole bunch

1179
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,200
of drugs and destroy ourselves whether

1180
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,960
we have no choice but to go on a whole

1181
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,480
bunch of medicational drugs because we

1182
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,000
get too sick

1183
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,319
whether we're up against a whole bunch

1184
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,240
of emotional stress whether we're up

1185
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,880
against a whole another problem in our

1186
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,480
life whatever it is one thing's certain

1187
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,800
in life there's one thing certain on

1188
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,920
this planet is your adrenals are going

1189
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,480
to take a hit throughout the life

1190
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,400
yeah planet stress exactly

1191
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,000
whether it's broken relationships broken

1192
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,000
trust whether it's

1193
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
whether it's a boyfriend breaking up

1194
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,960
whether it's a girlfriend breaking up

1195
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,560
whether it's a divorce whether it's

1196
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,079
something else whether it's a tragic

1197
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,079
loss whether it's something that we've

1198
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,359
gone through that's unimaginable whether

1199
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,119
it's something that you think no one

1200
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,200
understands whether it's being

1201
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,280
misunderstood whether it's being hard

1202
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,680
hurt whether it's our heartache whether

1203
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,599
our heart is hurting emotionally whether

1204
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,280
we take an emotional hit whether we feel

1205
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,599
the personalization because we've had it

1206
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,119
beaten out of us or our soul feels like

1207
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,560
it's been beaten out of us whatever it

1208
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,119
is our adrenals are going to take a hit

1209
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,480
the reason why people start to bounce

1210
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,640
back

1211
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,800
they start to get what feels like some

1212
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,200
soul back

1213
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
celery juice restores those adrenal

1214
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,680
glands it's one of those things that

1215
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,839
feeds them they're thirsty buggers these

1216
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,520
are thirsty critters these are thirsty

1217
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,880
critters

1218
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,319
and that reminds me since we're talking

1219
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,760
about critters so are these these are

1220
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,359
really thirsty critters too but they

1221
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,640
don't like celery juice

1222
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,119
these critters

1223
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,359
hate celery juice these critters like to

1224
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,400
drink and eat other things

1225
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,160
they do

1226
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,839
they like to drink all kinds of stuff

1227
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,000
and eat all kinds of stuff inside the

1228
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,319
body and they like to they like to

1229
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
thrive and colonize and then make you

1230
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,319
sick and then you get your lupus and

1231
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,599
your neurological lime and then you get

1232
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,920
everything else in the sun your

1233
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,440
hashimoto's your eczema your psoriasis

1234
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,839
you get all your other problems right

1235
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,960
here and so what celery juice does is

1236
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,240
celery juice likes to

1237
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,079
break down

1238
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,200
and destroy these little buggers

1239
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,760
shingles epstein bars hhv-6s hhv-7s

1240
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,119
hhv-8

1241
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,319
10 through 16 that's undiscovered

1242
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,319
all of them herpes simplex one two

1243
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,000
you know a friend of mine reached out i

1244
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,359
haven't talked to in a long time the

1245
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,480
practitioner

1246
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,960
you know i've been doing a lot of

1247
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,160
medical medium stuff for all my patients

1248
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,480
and i see all the time aw

1249
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,680
i see all the time people coming in with

1250
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,520
cold sores

1251
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,119
everybody's got a cold sore everybody's

1252
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,119
got herpes everybody's got herpes

1253
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,880
simplex one

1254
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,560
everybody's got a fever blister and

1255
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,319
they're all coming in it's like kids

1256
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,920
have fever blisters adults have fever

1257
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,680
blisters everybody's got these fever

1258
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,440
blisters and i say yeah and there's so

1259
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,599
many different varieties of fever

1260
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,359
blisters it's like what do you think

1261
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,200
i'm like well medical medium protocols

1262
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,880
about how to break down fever blisters

1263
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,800
how to break down the virus and all that

1264
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,640
so medical medium protocols are critical

1265
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,240
it's like no i know because i'm just

1266
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,160
starting to get into those now because

1267
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,680
nothing else i'm doing is working so i'm

1268
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,640
starting to use the medical medium

1269
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,560
protocols and celery juice i noticed aw

1270
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,079
celery juice is one of the top pro on

1271
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,920
the top of the protocols it's always

1272
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:05,280
like 32 ounces of celery juice

1273
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,319
16 ounces of celery juice

1274
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,400
children's dosages of celery juice like

1275
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,200
all these things it's about dosages it's

1276
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,720
about all that stuff right here and so

1277
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,319
that's important all its own to break

1278
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,160
down the different viruses that people

1279
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,119
have cold sores fever blisters and all

1280
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,680
that it's like aw tell me what the cold

1281
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,000
sore virus even does i'm like trigeminal

1282
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,480
neuralgia shingles does that too but

1283
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,760
trigeminal neuralgia pain in the gums

1284
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,720
burning tongue

1285
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,000
burning mouth back of the neck pain ear

1286
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,680
pain all kinds of problems like that you

1287
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,359
know and and that was just some of the

1288
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,119
things and

1289
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,480

don't add water

1326

and then you squeeze the crap out of it

1327
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,680
with a cheesecloth or a nut milk bag and

1328
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,359
you you squeeze it out

1329
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,599

1345
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,640
there's just some things there's other

1346
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,920
stuff about it i don't even talk about

1347
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,280
it it's great

1348
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,440
so

1349
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,839
it's important so carlita says why am i

1350
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,160
still having some acne breakouts even if

1351
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,760
i removed eggs and dairy from my diet

1352
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,760
how long did you remove eggs and dairy

1353
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,200
from your diet number one because if you

1354
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,640
remove eggs and dairy from your diet you

1355
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,319
still have eggs and dairy inside your

1356
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,160
liver for quite a little bit of a while

1357
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,359
could could be in there for a good few

1358
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,880
months or more

1359
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,400
and then whatever's feeding on it will

1360
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,720
keep on feeding on it that's one thing

1361
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,400
the other thing is that's one level

1362
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,200
there's different varieties of bacteria

1363
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,440
i mean strengths of bacteria that cause

1364
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,800
acne so if you read cleanse the heal and

1365
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,560
you check into it and check with your

1366
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,480
doctor if you want but if you if you

1367
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,440
re-cleanse the heal you read about

1368
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,400
streptococcus causing acne right

1369
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,640
some people streptococcus is strong some

1370
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,880
of it is even antibiotic resistance

1371
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,520
right resistant so

1372
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,599
there's an acne protocol so removing

1373
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,839
eggs doesn't mean it's going to fix your

1374
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,440
acne but it's going to help so the acne

1375
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,960
doesn't get worse and worse and worse

1376
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,960
removing eggs stops it from getting

1377
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,880
worse and worse and worse but that's

1378
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,359
just one aspect of the protocol is

1379
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,079
removing eggs right that's one aspect

1380
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,240
removing dairy then

1381
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,000
the other aspect is did you remove

1382
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,920
gluten because that's another thing that

1383
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,040
feeds streptococcus bacteria that causes

1384
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,280
acne then are you using something to

1385
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,680
kill the acne

1386
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,079
are you juicing something to kill the

1387
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,160
acne herbal medicine how much celery

1388
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,800
juice are you doing to kill off the

1389
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,720
streptococcus that's causing the acne

1390
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,319
that's another edge of the protocol see

1391
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,359
medical meaning protocols aren't just

1392
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,800
this one little thing where it's like

1393
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,319
hey i'll take get rid of some eggs and i

1394
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,680
did the medical medium protocol you

1395
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,200
there's a thousand protocols you can

1396
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,480
customize and go as far as you need to

1397
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,760
go to get better and heal and that's

1398
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,760
what people do

1399
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,359
julia says i needed to remove all fats

1400
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,440
before my acne went away that means the

1401
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,400
streptococcus that you had julie was

1402
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,480
hiding behind all that fat that was in

1403
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,160
the foods right so that was critical to

1404
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,079
do too so it was really smart and then

1405
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,640
when you apply celery juice or any

1406
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,400
protocols you annihilate that strep

1407
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,000
bacteria because you don't have so much

1408
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,520
fat in the blood and that's another

1409
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,599
thing right there see there's so much

1410
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,800
information to use so you can heal and

1411
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:51,040
get better so yeah

1412
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,000
yeah medical medium information knocks

1413
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,400
out

1414
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,040
