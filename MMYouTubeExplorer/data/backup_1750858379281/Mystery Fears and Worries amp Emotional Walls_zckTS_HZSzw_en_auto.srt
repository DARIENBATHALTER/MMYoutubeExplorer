1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,040
I'm reading about mystery fears and

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,740
worries do you know somebody who has

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,219
mysterious fears mysterious worries

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,139
comes and goes sometimes you get a kind

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,719
of a grip on it and you got it in

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,760
control you're managing it and then

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,380
three months later it's like the fears

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,720
come back and then it's triggering some

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,340
anxiety and the worries are there too so

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,199
I'm reading in the brain saver books

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,359
this is an interesting topic so many

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,580
people are dealing with this by the way

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,380
this is just scratching the surface of

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,099
what's in the brain saver books both of

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,440
them

16
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,180
sometimes we know exactly why we're

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,760
afraid or worried

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,219
sometimes we do we like know why we're

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,320
afraid we know why we're scared of

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,899
something sometimes it feels like it

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,840
comes out of the blue though like why

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,000
did it happen those unexplained cases of

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,879
fear and worry are often due to a past

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,820
experience that's been triggered without

25
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,219
us knowing so here's the thing there's

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,199
people that know about their triggers so

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,140
something they hear something they learn

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,880
about or something they experience

29
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,820
they'll know it's triggering they'll

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,799
have experience with that but there's a

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,200
lot of people that get this mysterious

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,240
fear and worry that creeps up they were

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,479
triggered but they actually don't know

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,180
they were triggered that's an important

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,700
detail people don't know out there

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,920
because in times of pain our brains put

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,320
up healthy productive emotional walls to

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,960
help us cope our brains are putting up

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,119
emotional walls these emotional walls

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,520
are there so we can cope with life so we

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,100
can push through these are boundaries

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,240
that were not meant to be knocked down

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,180
so our coping boundary was never meant

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,159
to be knocked down these walls allow us

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,020
to get through our days without being

46
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,540
constantly reminded of what's happened

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,340
to us because if we're constantly being

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,659
reminded of the bad thing that's

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,880
happened to us

50
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,100
or something that wasn't good that

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,280
happened to us if we're being being

52
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,500
reminded every single minute we can then

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,160
be in a state of being that's not good

54
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,020
so there's healthy emotional walls built

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,420
inside our brain which I talk about in

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,920
brain saver and those healthy emotional

57
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,780
laws are there to protect you so you're

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,540
not thinking about that thing that

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,700
happened to you every second and if that

60
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,980
wall comes down and we're thinking about

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,660
that bad thing every single second then

62
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,760
we're kind of in in another form of

63
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,440
trouble

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,020
unresolved experiences remain recorded

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,060
in our brains so when we have an

66
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,520
encounter in our present

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,739
that invokes the past it can trigger

68
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,900
emotions we felt before even if we don't

69
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,300
understand why so we can get the trigger

70
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,120
without realizing it by receiving

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,459
something some kind of information or

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,459
running into someone and not realize

73
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,680
that that person's triggering them

74
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,200
and then it happens we have the

75
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,300
mysterious fear worry anxiety feeling

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,640
lost feeling sad everything else around

77
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,920
it much of the time those unresolved

78
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,019
episodes involved other people who

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,400
didn't Rectify or recognize their

80
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,519
wrongdoings

81
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,040
sometimes what happened was terrifying

82
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,340
extreme or Unthinkable sometimes it

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,800
didn't seem upsetting to outside

84
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,319
observers and yet we had our reasons for

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,459
finding it deeply hurtful isn't it

86
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,099
interesting

87
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,959
when someone new appears in Our Lives

88
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:30,300
who reminds us even subconsciously of a

89
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,700
person from the past

90
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,780
we can get in trouble so somebody brand

91
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,480
new

92
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,959
somebody we don't even know we end up

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,360
talking to or running into

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,420
subconsciously reminds us of something

95
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,700
or somebody hurtful in the past we can

96
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,040
be triggered and not realize it and then

97
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,040
we go down into that rabbit hole

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,019
even subconsciously this happens of a

99
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,319
person from the past mystery fears and

100
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,840
worries can Surface a Gateway in an

101
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,700
emotional wall opens because that new

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,200
person awakened a memory in the

103
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,459
emotional centers of the brain behind

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,319
the wall so here's how it works in the

105
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,739
emotional centers of the brain

106
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,380
a Gateway opens up so you run into this

107
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,079
new person the new person is triggering

108
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,579
because they're knocking down a wall we

109
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,139
don't realize so something we're

110
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,660
experiencing in that moment from that

111
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,479
new person is starting to bring down the

112
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,100
wall that's there to Shield us from what

113
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,740
happened a long time ago in the past

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,720
from an experience of another person and

115
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,639
as that wall starts to come down we

116
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,900
don't realize it and then we're in a

117
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,000
rabbit hole we're in a difficult

118
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,740
situation we're in mysterious fears and

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,960
worries and other things too like

120
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,080
anything can Surface after that point

121
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,940
bad memories experiences that happen in

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,620
the past you know anything that happened

123
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,840
with relationships with other people

124
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,400
whatever it was it can all surface as

125
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,800
that emotional wall crumbles down

126
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,500
triggered by somebody new who didn't

127
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,600
even have an experience with you in your

128
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,300
past someone that didn't even know you

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,960
up until that moment and they triggered

130
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,180
you into a bad situation

131
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,460
another source of pagan that can come

132
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,100
back to visit is the trauma of once

133
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,960
being sick or injured

134
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,540
if you've been sick

135
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,160
and you struggled with chronic illness

136
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,259
and you know what it's like to be in

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
that place and you're on mattress Island

138
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,580
for a long time and you lost friends and

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,259
you lost family and you lost things in

140
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,940
your life quality of life and you

141
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,280
struggled and you fought your way back

142
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,560
you got the medical meme information and

143
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,660
you fought your way back to healing and

144
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,660
moved forward

145
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,039
and you can still become triggered

146
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,500
because you can remember like oh my God

147
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,900
I remember how bad it was I remember

148
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,280
I was having a hard time and anybody

149
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,900
who's having a hard time now and you're

150
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,160
struggling it's okay because you're

151
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,620
going to move forward and do your

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,240
healing but when you're healed and

153
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,280
you're better you still may get

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,220
triggered once in a while kind of taking

155
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,800
you back down memory lane of wow so much

156
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,259
was going on back then after we heal

157
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,180
feeling a hint of a symptom or any sort

158
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,919
of twinge pain can put us back into fear

159
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,600
and worry and I see that all the time I

160
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,940
see people heal a hundred symptoms and

161
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,259
conditions from the medical by using the

162
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,419
medical medium books by the way the

163
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,940
brand saver books

164
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,740
wait you guys have these I can't even

165
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,380
tell you how much is in here

166
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,380
what happens is we heal we get rid of 50

167
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,240
60 symptoms even four or five symptoms

168
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,580
but you can get rid of a lot of symptoms

169
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,479
right with medical meme information and

170
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:36,960
then if you get one symptom because you

171
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:40,080
healed 99 of them you're like on top of

172
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,100
the world and then you push yourself so

173
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,740
hard

174
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,720
you get into a new relationship you get

175
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,860
into a new job you get into whatever it

176
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,300
is and you're pushing yourself and

177
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,880
you're burning the candle and all of a

178
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,740
sudden an old reminder of one of the

179
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,479
hundred symptoms start to creep up a

180
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,220
little because you're getting a little

181
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,039
deficient or you're not keeping to what

182
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,139
you need to do or you put aside the

183
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,819
information for months and months and

184
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,800
you start feeling that one symptom

185
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,180
concrete back up as a reminder hey you

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,880
got to take care of yourself from what

187
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,160
you learned it can trigger that

188
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,120
experience of being like Oh my God I

189
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,280
remember

190
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,479
or maybe you picked up a new pathogen

191
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,979
and that's what happens to so many

192
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,080
people they heal a hundred symptoms

193
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:21,960
conditions they heal 50 symptoms

194
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,599
conditions and then they're out on the

195
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,639
dating scene and then they're drinking

196
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,680
off somebody else's glass and then

197
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,780
they're doing whatever and they're in a

198
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,580
public bathroom but they end up getting

199
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,259
exposure from a sink in a public

200
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,419
bathroom whatever it is they pick up a

201
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,479
knee streptococcus a new Epstein bar a

202
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:41,819
new shingles virus and then they're

203
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,979
triggered into like oh my God am I sick

204
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,740
again of course it means just get back

205
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,599
on get back on the wagon and you know

206
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,639
start working on it do apply what you

207
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,639
need to do the tools but it can trigger

208
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,800
that feeling inside of us

209
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,840
finally if someone has been busy all

210
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,460
their life pushing through every day in

211
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,340
survival mode from a young age without

212
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,139
help or support and some of the stress

213
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,599
finally dissipates and circumstances

214
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,699
improve because of a windfall new job

215
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,740
new career opportunity to take time off

216
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,599
they're nourishing their friendships

217
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,580
their relationships it will take some

218
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,319
time the process past experiences

219
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,360

220
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,979

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,880

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,560
into two large books filled with

245
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,080
