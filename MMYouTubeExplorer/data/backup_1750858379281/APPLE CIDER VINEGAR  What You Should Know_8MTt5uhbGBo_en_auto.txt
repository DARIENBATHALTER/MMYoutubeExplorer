[92.16 - 98.40] um michelle l says acv kills me yeah i
[95.60 - 99.28] mean uh hi deanna hi back to everybody
[98.40 - 101.76] and
[99.28 - 104.48] whoa watching from egypt whoa incredible
[101.76 - 106.24] i'm so glad you're here um and the
[104.48 - 108.40] bottom line is when it comes down to
[106.24 - 110.64] apple cider vinegar i want you guys to
[108.40 - 112.48] know that i've always told people if you
[110.64 - 113.44] can't let go of your vinegar if you
[112.48 - 115.44] can't
[113.44 - 117.36] yes use the apple cider vinegar and if
[115.44 - 119.76] you can't let go of the grape vinegar if
[117.36 - 122.16] you can't let go of the you know the red
[119.76 - 124.72] the the you know the red grape vinegar
[122.16 - 126.64] if you can't let go of that or balsamic
[124.72 - 128.24] vinegar if you can't let go of that then
[126.64 - 130.56] use the apple cider vinegar but
[128.24 - 133.20] something has happened that's changed
[130.56 - 135.52] over the last 10 years now and people
[133.20 - 137.68] are using apple cider vinegar they're
[135.52 - 139.36] using it in large quantities like one to
[137.68 - 141.12] two teaspoons i mean one to two
[139.36 - 143.04] tablespoons really one to three
[141.12 - 144.72] tablespoons one to four tablespoons
[143.04 - 146.24] they'll take it in the morning they'll
[144.72 - 148.08] put it in water they'll put it in
[146.24 - 150.72] smoothies they'll put it in something
[148.08 - 152.80] but what happens is they don't know
[150.72 - 155.44] what goes on internally with apple cider
[152.80 - 158.64] vinegar it's acetic acid
[155.44 - 162.00] and you have to listen to this episode
[158.64 - 164.56] about acetic acid and what happens in
[162.00 - 165.52] the body when that acetic acid enters
[164.56 - 166.72] and
[165.52 - 167.84] and i want to tell you something if
[166.72 - 170.24] you're somebody where it helped your
[167.84 - 171.92] acid reflux if you're somebody where
[170.24 - 174.56] apple cider vinegar helped your acid
[171.92 - 177.28] reflux or apple cider vinegar helped
[174.56 - 178.40] your bloating there's a reason why it
[177.28 - 179.20] helped
[178.40 - 183.20] but
[179.20 - 185.84] there's also backlash that occurs later
[183.20 - 188.64] when the teeth start to actually fall
[185.84 - 190.80] apart or the the enamel starts to wear
[188.64 - 192.80] off later and i want to forewarn people
[190.80 - 194.48] because when you're chronically sick
[192.80 - 196.32] the last thing you need now is teeth
[194.48 - 198.80] problems later on when you're already
[196.32 - 200.88] dealing with fatigue and other issues
[198.80 - 202.40] and everything so that's one thing right
[200.88 - 205.04] there um
[202.40 - 206.16] kate dillon delorenzo says i used acv
[205.04 - 209.04] for months
[206.16 - 210.24] morning night one teaspoon morning one
[209.04 - 211.92] at night
[210.24 - 213.44] but it killed me i ended up with
[211.92 - 215.12] digestive problems and lots more and i
[213.44 - 218.00] want kate i want to talk about that for
[215.12 - 220.24] a second because what that means is
[218.00 - 222.80] exactly what i talked about in the apple
[220.24 - 224.48] cider vinegar episode so you have to
[222.80 - 227.20] listen to this episode you guys now
[224.48 - 229.20] here's how it works your stomach glands
[227.20 - 231.04] if they're strong enough
[229.20 - 233.44] what happens is you can take the apple
[231.04 - 235.36] cider vinegar and then see some benefits
[233.44 - 237.84] if your stomach lands are strong enough
[235.36 - 239.52] but a lot of people their stomach lands
[237.84 - 241.20] aren't strong enough the stomach glands
[239.52 - 243.92] that produce gastric acid that's your
[241.20 - 246.40] hcl hydrochloric acid and then when you
[243.92 - 249.36] take acetic acid which is apple cider
[246.40 - 251.28] vinegar when you take that vinegar and
[249.36 - 253.20] it what it does is it puts stress on
[251.28 - 254.64] those stomach glands and if they're not
[253.20 - 256.40] strong enough those stomach lands
[254.64 - 258.32] because your hcl is weak your stomach
[256.40 - 260.88] glands are weakened and and they're
[258.32 - 262.64] depleted then they just blow out and
[260.88 - 264.00] when they blow out you get real sick
[262.64 - 265.44] from acv
[264.00 - 267.44] and you might be somebody that's not
[265.44 - 269.68] there yet your stomach glands haven't
[267.44 - 272.32] been that compromised yet but here's the
[269.68 - 273.60] problem they will get compromised so if
[272.32 - 275.12] you're doing your apple cider vinegar
[273.60 - 276.96] for five years then you do it every
[275.12 - 279.36] night or you do it every morning
[276.96 - 281.84] eventually those stomach glands will get
[279.36 - 283.04] burned out and when they burn out boom
[281.84 - 284.96] you don't know what's causing your
[283.04 - 287.52] problem you'll still do your apple cider
[284.96 - 289.76] vinegar not knowing it's the apple cider
[287.52 - 292.08] vinegar that made the stomach lands
[289.76 - 294.08] really bad to begin with or really made
[292.08 - 296.08] them worse actually because our stomach
[294.08 - 298.24] lands get depleted anyway but this
[296.08 - 299.68] pushes it over the edge so when you hear
[298.24 - 301.52] this episode
[299.68 - 304.88] you're going to be blown away because i
[301.52 - 307.36] cover in detail i talk all about it so
[304.88 - 310.48] episode 11 all right apple cider vinegar
[307.36 - 313.04] teeth dissolver episode episode 11
[310.48 - 314.80] medical meeting podcast at apple podcast
[313.04 - 316.56] link is in the description
[314.80 - 318.24] do not miss it you guys are going to
[316.56 - 320.48] love this episode it's packed with
[318.24 - 322.96] information now before before you make a
[320.48 - 325.20] judgment call and you throw shade at me
[322.96 - 327.28] you throw hate at me and whatever it is
[325.20 - 329.44] because here it is anthony william the
[327.28 - 331.12] medical medium is talking about apple
[329.44 - 332.32] cider vinegar now because he you know
[331.12 - 333.84] he's always getting in trouble for
[332.32 - 335.60] talking about something or another
[333.84 - 338.32] because i'm always going to step on
[335.60 - 340.00] somebody's toes by accident well you
[338.32 - 342.24] know not by accident but just
[340.00 - 344.16] automatically is what i mean it just
[342.24 - 345.28] happens when you have information about
[344.16 - 347.04] things so
[345.28 - 349.44] and it just so happens though it gets
[347.04 - 352.32] people upset um good to see everybody on
[349.44 - 354.32] here right now so here's the thing about
[352.32 - 356.16] apple cider vinegar if your stomach
[354.32 - 358.00] glands are really strong and they
[356.16 - 359.84] haven't been weakened yet and you want
[358.00 - 361.76] to take apple cider vinegar internally
[359.84 - 364.08] on a daily basis you're not going to
[361.76 - 366.72] notice a problem yet you'll even see
[364.08 - 368.16] that your acid reflux could back down
[366.72 - 369.84] you can see which you could have fixed
[368.16 - 371.68] it other ways but you'll see your acid
[369.84 - 373.36] reflux back down you'll see you're
[371.68 - 374.96] bloating back down
[373.36 - 376.40] you might see what seems to be some
[374.96 - 379.44] weight loss too because there's an
[376.40 - 383.20] appetite suppressant but as the stomach
[379.44 - 385.36] lands get tired from the acetic acid
[383.20 - 387.04] and they start to blow out they start to
[385.36 - 388.40] pickle so you have to know how this
[387.04 - 390.88] works i'm going to talk about the pickle
[388.40 - 394.24] process with this too when your stomach
[390.88 - 396.40] lands start to pickle in there okay what
[394.24 - 399.44] happens is they blow out they also get
[396.40 - 401.20] depleted and they they get way far gone
[399.44 - 403.60] then when you take your apple cider
[401.20 - 405.36] vinegar it kills you it feels like oh my
[403.60 - 407.76] god this stuff is killing me why am i
[405.36 - 409.20] bloating more why am i feeling horrible
[407.76 - 411.44] why why do i have all these other
[409.20 - 413.12] problems now but if you're really convi
[411.44 - 414.96] if you have real conviction towards your
[413.12 - 417.04] apple cider vinegar where nothing can
[414.96 - 419.28] tell you different that this this stuff
[417.04 - 421.20] works so good for you and it's the best
[419.28 - 423.04] thing ever for you when you're convinced
[421.20 - 425.20] while your health is having problems
[423.04 - 427.68] you'll never know apple cider vinegar is
[425.20 - 429.60] making it worse or even created some of
[427.68 - 431.52] your problems you won't know so you'll
[429.60 - 433.20] sit there being like oh wait apple cider
[431.52 - 435.68] vinegar i better take some more every
[433.20 - 437.60] day i better take some more and oh
[435.68 - 439.36] wow i'm getting sicker here but i better
[437.60 - 441.60] take some more and you won't know unless
[439.36 - 444.16] someone becomes the messenger
[441.60 - 447.04] to actually give you that option because
[444.16 - 449.20] i want you to have a choice a choice to
[447.04 - 452.16] be like wait a minute you mean to tell
[449.20 - 454.80] me uh that could be contributing to my
[452.16 - 456.48] problems so it's so important to know it
[454.80 - 458.24] really is and
[456.48 - 460.56] it's great to see you guys on here
[458.24 - 461.84] everybody on here so um
[460.56 - 463.60] here's the thing
[461.84 - 466.08] it's like
[463.60 - 468.08] that that episode apple cider vinegar
[466.08 - 470.72] teeth dissolver episode
[468.08 - 473.04] it has all the do's and don'ts i talk
[470.72 - 475.60] about what i like about apple cider
[473.04 - 478.48] vinegar what i love about it
[475.60 - 481.04] how it's mineral rich so it does at
[478.48 - 483.60] least have that it's the best
[481.04 - 486.08] vinegar there is and i talk about why
[483.60 - 488.56] apple cider vinegar is the best vinegar
[486.08 - 491.36] there is outside of all the vinegars but
[488.56 - 493.60] even with that said i talk about why we
[491.36 - 495.12] have to look out and be very cautious
[493.60 - 497.44] with it and i know that gets people
[495.12 - 499.60] upset but there's reasons now here's one
[497.44 - 502.48] reason right here okay and you'll hear
[499.60 - 505.04] more in detail in the episode but
[502.48 - 508.40] what happens with acetic acid it has a
[505.04 - 510.40] chemical reaction with calcium calcium
[508.40 - 514.40] calcium is in your teeth calcium is in
[510.40 - 516.24] your bones acetic acid depletes calcium
[514.40 - 518.80] there's a chemical reaction that occurs
[516.24 - 520.64] when acetic acid hits calcium now i'm
[518.80 - 523.68] just going to say this okay
[520.64 - 525.84] there's vinegar in cleaning products
[523.68 - 528.64] so remember that there's a reason why
[525.84 - 529.60] vinegar is in cleaning products
[528.64 - 534.96] and
[529.60 - 537.92] vinegar can clean hard water stains yes
[534.96 - 539.76] calcium stains hmm
[537.92 - 542.16] think about that one for a little bit
[539.76 - 544.16] okay now i know that gets apple cider
[542.16 - 546.80] vinegar people upset by even you know
[544.16 - 548.56] talking anything bad about it but i just
[546.80 - 551.12] want you to have a chance to protect
[548.56 - 553.76] yourself in case you got sucked into the
[551.12 - 555.84] apple cider vinegar trend you know and
[553.76 - 557.60] so this is how it works
[555.84 - 560.56] why does vinegar
[557.60 - 564.32] clean water stains
[560.56 - 567.20] why does it do that hard water stains
[564.32 - 570.24] it cleans them because
[567.20 - 573.04] it can decalcify it can actually have a
[570.24 - 574.88] reaction to calcium and start wearing
[573.04 - 577.28] calcium away
[574.88 - 579.20] so you have to hear this podcast episode
[577.28 - 581.52] medical medium podcast that apple

[600.72 - 605.28] you guys here so important so
[603.44 - 607.20] so let's talk about this a little bit
[605.28 - 609.28] a lot of people actually everybody is
[607.20 - 611.60] concerned about enamel
[609.28 - 613.76] concerned about cavities concerned about
[611.60 - 615.92] their teeth and i will do a teeth

[619.36 - 623.28] all kinds of things regarding teeth well
[621.28 - 625.68] apple cider vinegar okay so we have to
[623.28 - 628.40] keep this in mind where is the enamel
[625.68 - 630.08] down i discussed this all in the episode
[628.40 - 632.56] podcast now listen
[630.08 - 634.32] i know guys i get it so many of you just
[632.56 - 636.56] love your apple cider vinegar you don't
[634.32 - 638.72] want to you don't want to give it up you
[636.56 - 640.40] want to even get mad at me possibly i
[638.72 - 642.16] get it i know i've already seen some
[640.40 - 643.36] comments where some people are like
[642.16 - 645.28] apple cider vinegar is the greatest
[643.36 - 648.08] thing ever and you're wrong you're wrong
[645.28 - 650.88] but i want you to get a chance to listen
[648.08 - 653.76] to the episode if you can and hear the
[650.88 - 656.48] information and i'm actually not totally
[653.76 - 660.16] against it i talk about what uses i like
[656.48 - 661.84] it for one use is for acne surfacely by
[660.16 - 663.60] putting it on a wall making a warm
[661.84 - 665.36] compress with a towel putting a little
[663.60 - 668.00] apple cider vinegar on the towel and the
[665.36 - 670.48] hot water and the towel and putting it
[668.00 - 672.56] on acne okay so and putting it on spots
[670.48 - 674.88] hot spots that you have and that's with
[672.56 - 677.36] apple cider vinegar i talk about that i
[674.88 - 680.24] talk about some other uses too so you'll
[677.36 - 683.92] see that i actually do believe in it and
[680.24 - 686.40] going back 35 years you guys i have
[683.92 - 688.48] always said if you're gonna do vinegar
[686.40 - 691.12] and you're not to let it go it has to be
[688.48 - 693.60] apple cider vinegar and this and and
[691.12 - 696.00] that's that's the one to use
[693.60 - 698.96] so it's not like i'm sitting here trying
[696.00 - 702.00] to say oh this is bad oh don't do this
[698.96 - 704.00] ever and whatnot i'm just saying what
[702.00 - 706.24] happened is over the last couple of
[704.00 - 707.12] decades actually the last decade last 10
[706.24 - 709.76] years
[707.12 - 712.16] a a surge was happening about taking it
[709.76 - 714.32] internally and it's really sad because

[912.40 - 916.24] little bit more i think we should it's
[914.56 - 918.80] an important one
[916.24 - 921.52] um samantha says you're so right i got
[918.80 - 923.04] so sick after a month on acv
[921.52 - 924.64] absolutely
[923.04 - 926.48] it really does and there's people who
[924.64 - 927.52] don't get sick yet but they do get sick
[926.48 - 928.72] and don't know it's the apple cider
[927.52 - 931.52] vinegar
[928.72 - 933.84] messaging with angels what a cool name i
[931.52 - 936.64] dropped vinegar and oils and it helped
[933.84 - 938.80] my acid reflux if i do eat it i get the
[936.64 - 940.64] acid reflux that's because
[938.80 - 942.24] stomach lands when they're already
[940.64 - 943.04] overloaded and you're trying to heal
[942.24 - 945.04] them
[943.04 - 947.60] and and when you when you throw that
[945.04 - 949.84] acetic acid in that apple cider vinegar
[947.60 - 952.80] oh forget it what it does is it
[949.84 - 955.20] completely blows them out it squeezes
[952.80 - 957.52] every last drop of hcl out of your
[955.20 - 959.68] stomach lands these tiny little stomach
[957.52 - 962.08] glands sitting in your stomach that's
[959.68 - 964.40] what produces your gastric acid when you
[962.08 - 967.04] drop those tablespoons of apple cider
[964.40 - 969.60] vinegar down in there and you just it
[967.04 - 972.48] pickles them and squeezes them out uh
[969.60 - 974.32] ashley alexandra i knew a girl that
[972.48 - 976.00] loved to faithfully drink regular white
[974.32 - 978.48] distilled vinegar every day for many
[976.00 - 980.64] months about a cup a day and it pickled
[978.48 - 984.40] her insides and she went through major
[980.64 - 987.20] stomach surgery it does so what happens
[984.40 - 989.76] is that that acetic acid causes that
[987.20 - 992.16] much trouble so look look look i get it
[989.76 - 994.40] you guys if you really love your acv
[992.16 - 996.72] if you really if you're really really

[1145.36 - 1148.88] they're not matching the thoughts in
[1146.80 - 1150.64] your head the words that you're speaking
[1148.88 - 1151.76] or you can't really understand people
[1150.64 - 1153.28] that are talking to you because you're
[1151.76 - 1155.44] forgetting what they're saying or that
[1153.28 - 1157.44] you can't compute it and you can't
[1155.44 - 1159.68] register it or something meanwhile

[1168.16 - 1171.68] it's like you know
[1169.44 - 1173.92] that told me that they feel like people
[1171.68 - 1176.40] think she's like she doesn't she's not

[1219.12 - 1223.76] that's what i talk about in the episode
[1221.44 - 1226.40] is it could work well for a bit for a
[1223.76 - 1227.92] little bit and then you get problems
[1226.40 - 1230.00] from it and i'll tell you why it was
[1227.92 - 1232.64] what i was saying those gastric glands
[1230.00 - 1235.28] of yours those little glands or stomach
[1232.64 - 1237.12] glands what happens is when you dump
[1235.28 - 1238.88] that acetic acid down in you so i'll
[1237.12 - 1240.32] take a couple tablespoons okay let me
[1238.88 - 1242.64] have my apple cider vinegar here i'll
[1240.32 - 1244.96] take a couple tablespoons here and and
[1242.64 - 1246.48] put it down and and send it down whoa
[1244.96 - 1248.96] it's helping a little bit it's helping
[1246.48 - 1250.64] what it's doing is it's blowing out
[1248.96 - 1253.44] those glands what that means is it's
[1250.64 - 1256.64] making them squeeze every last drop of
[1253.44 - 1259.28] all that hcl out and then you get a max
[1256.64 - 1260.96] out point so you get a max out point and
[1259.28 - 1262.88] a leveling point where your stomach
[1260.96 - 1265.12] glands go can't take this anymore i
[1262.88 - 1266.80] can't do it anymore and then all the
[1265.12 - 1268.96] digestive problems start coming back and
[1266.80 - 1270.40] coming back coming back plus the acetic
[1268.96 - 1272.32] acid is so hard on the lining of the

[1364.64 - 1370.24] janice ellison says if you ingest acv
[1367.60 - 1371.20] use a straw to protect your teeth smart
[1370.24 - 1372.16] idea
[1371.20 - 1374.64] but
[1372.16 - 1377.52] you'll still get other problems too
[1374.64 - 1379.52] though janice listen to the episode it's
[1377.52 - 1382.08] really good to do and by the way janice
[1379.52 - 1382.88] that's really that's really a good idea
[1382.08 - 1384.80] but
[1382.88 - 1386.24] that's not how you protect your teeth
[1384.80 - 1388.88] entirely
[1386.24 - 1391.52] because the apple cider vinegar it gets
[1388.88 - 1393.52] in your bloodstream it gets everywhere
[1391.52 - 1396.64] so it has a chemical reaction with
[1393.52 - 1398.48] calcium altogether bones included so
[1396.64 - 1400.00] even though you're bypassing the apple
[1398.48 - 1402.24] cider vinegar and you're not letting it
[1400.00 - 1405.04] touch your teeth it's bypassing your
[1402.24 - 1407.76] teeth it still finds its way to your
[1405.04 - 1410.00] teeth because it sucks calcium out it
[1407.76 - 1412.00] vampires the calcium out it leeches it
[1410.00 - 1414.08] out of the body so even though you're
[1412.00 - 1415.52] kind of bypassing it with a straw which
[1414.08 - 1417.52] is a great idea because at least you're
[1415.52 - 1419.28] not getting direct contact to your teeth
[1417.52 - 1421.36] so it was really smart
[1419.28 - 1424.40] at the same time your teeth will still
[1421.36 - 1425.68] be affected by it uh just just happening
[1424.40 - 1427.20] because it's in your body and you're
[1425.68 - 1428.96] drinking it and consuming it and it
[1427.20 - 1430.96] still finds its way because
[1428.96 - 1432.96] your teeth will still get hit with it it
[1430.96 - 1434.96] will still touch your teeth so unless
[1432.96 - 1436.32] you take the straw and kind of stick it
[1434.96 - 1438.48] down further
[1436.32 - 1440.16] and just try to suck that way so it goes
[1438.48 - 1443.36] down your throat it's not really an easy
[1440.16 - 1446.88] option it's not a great one um
[1443.36 - 1448.56] yeah and so the thing is with with the
[1446.88 - 1451.20] whole thing with apple cider vinegar and
[1448.56 - 1452.56] any vinegar is it pickles organs too
[1451.20 - 1454.88] because there's this chemical reaction
[1452.56 - 1457.20] that happens inside the body with salt
[1454.88 - 1460.00] so how do you pickle something well you
[1457.20 - 1462.24] need vinegar and you need salt and we
[1460.00 - 1464.24] have salt in our bloodstream naturally
[1462.24 - 1466.16] occurring wait to hear about that and

[1672.08 - 1675.36] we'll do a quick we'll do a quick
[1673.60 - 1677.44] rundown on this a little bit
[1675.36 - 1678.80] why was this episode named teeth
[1677.44 - 1680.08] dissolver
[1678.80 - 1683.04] because
[1680.08 - 1685.04] unfortunately apple cider vinegar will
[1683.04 - 1686.96] wear down the enamel on your teeth i
[1685.04 - 1689.12] talk about why and how that happens
[1686.96 - 1690.80] check that out and unless your teeth are
[1689.12 - 1692.64] important and the apple cider vinegar is
[1690.80 - 1694.16] more important than your teeth if it's
[1692.64 - 1696.40] more important than your teeth then just
[1694.16 - 1699.12] you can use it if you know
[1696.40 - 1702.32] jeff says that's the problem it can make
[1699.12 - 1703.84] you feel better at first yes exactly
[1702.32 - 1705.60] jeff that's what i was saying in the
[1703.84 - 1707.92] episode it can make you feel better at
[1705.60 - 1710.48] first but then down the road symptoms
[1707.92 - 1712.88] reoccur and you think nothing of it in
[1710.48 - 1715.52] fact you may believe it is time to
[1712.88 - 1717.68] increase acv but it is the acv causing
[1715.52 - 1719.84] damage that's what happens you think you
[1717.68 - 1721.44] have to increase acv meanwhile it's
[1719.84 - 1723.92] causing the problem
[1721.44 - 1726.48] oh my god you know you know jennifer
