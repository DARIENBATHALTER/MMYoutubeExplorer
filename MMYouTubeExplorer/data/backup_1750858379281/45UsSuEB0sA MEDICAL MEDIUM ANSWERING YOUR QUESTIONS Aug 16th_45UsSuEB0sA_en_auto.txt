[6.48 - 10.48] we're live
[8.48 - 13.12] pretty sure we're live we're definitely
[10.48 - 14.64] live if you're new here anthony william
[13.12 - 16.32] the medical medium number one new york
[14.64 - 17.84] times best-selling author got cleansed
[16.32 - 18.96] to heal right here too i'm gonna answer
[17.84 - 20.56] questions
[18.96 - 23.36] but you know what's funny is the health
[20.56 - 26.40] scene is like the wild wild west
[23.36 - 28.40] it always was like that in the past and
[26.40 - 30.64] it's still like that now
[28.40 - 32.56] and it's like the blind leading the
[30.64 - 34.24] blind when it comes down to so much
[32.56 - 36.08] going on i see my monitor to the right
[34.24 - 37.44] i'm looking at all the
[36.08 - 38.96] the comments coming up so i'm gonna
[37.44 - 40.80] answer questions it's what i'm gonna do
[38.96 - 42.40] so it's like the blind leading the blind
[40.80 - 45.36] you guys you get sick
[42.40 - 46.16] okay and then you're on your own all
[45.36 - 47.68] right
[46.16 - 49.20] you get sick and you're on your own and
[47.68 - 51.28] you might be somebody that's like
[49.20 - 53.12] that's not true you know i had a symptom
[51.28 - 54.96] i went to my doctor
[53.12 - 56.56] my doctor's giving me some information
[54.96 - 58.00] you know i have support and that's good
[56.56 - 61.20] but what happens if you're
[58.00 - 63.28] on your fourth doctor and your fifth
[61.20 - 65.04] doctor and then your specialist and now
[63.28 - 66.48] your neurologist
[65.04 - 68.32] and you're now you know at another
[66.48 - 68.72] doctor and so forth and it goes on like
[68.32 - 71.36] that
[68.72 - 73.44] and it ends up like oh my god i really
[71.36 - 74.80] am on my own research in science doesn't
[73.44 - 77.52] know why i'm sick
[74.80 - 79.12] and how come i'm still sick yeah i go to
[77.52 - 79.84] my doctor and i'm getting help but why
[79.12 - 83.20] am i still
[79.84 - 86.48] sick and it's because you know the
[83.20 - 89.44] health and wellness uh health scene
[86.48 - 90.24] all of it's always been the wild wild
[89.44 - 93.28] west
[90.24 - 95.76] and don't get fooled by flash and
[93.28 - 97.28] trends that are like you know the
[95.76 - 98.96] recyclable
[97.28 - 101.60] they're like recycled and they're in the
[98.96 - 102.72] out of the old trend recycle bin from
[101.60 - 105.52] the past
[102.72 - 107.20] you know and they can those trends can
[105.52 - 108.24] actually be really deceiving they can
[107.20 - 111.12] appear like
[108.24 - 112.80] they work or they're good or you know
[111.12 - 116.08] hey apple cider vinegar
[112.80 - 117.68] can fix your lupus no it can't um
[116.08 - 119.84] activated charcoal can fix your
[117.68 - 122.32] gastroparesis no it can't
[119.84 - 124.16] um you know it's like you know it's like
[122.32 - 125.84] it's always been like that
[124.16 - 128.24] and research in science doesn't know why
[125.84 - 130.88] people are sick and it's really sad
[128.24 - 132.40] and if you're not sick and you're not so
[130.88 - 133.44] sick and you only got a little bit of a
[132.40 - 136.00] symptom
[133.44 - 137.36] you can play around in that land and
[136.00 - 139.60] those mirages seem
[137.36 - 141.20] real you know it's kind of fun hey do
[139.60 - 142.72] some fermented foods
[141.20 - 144.72] hey do a little apple cider vinegar
[142.72 - 147.12] whatever and you can do that but the
[144.72 - 149.44] bottom line is when you're really sick
[147.12 - 151.52] and you're really looking for answers it
[149.44 - 153.52] really has been the wild wild west and
[151.52 - 156.00] you know what i think about in the past
[153.52 - 156.88] all like 35 years of being in here and
[156.00 - 160.00] doing this
[156.88 - 161.12] 35 years of this and i think about it so
[160.00 - 163.60] many people
[161.12 - 164.80] their stories what they've gone through
[163.60 - 167.60] being really sick and they
[164.80 - 168.24] tried all the things you see out there
[167.60 - 170.40] now
[168.24 - 172.80] they've tried it all they've tried the
[170.40 - 174.96] food combining they tried the
[172.80 - 176.88] they tried to you know they tried to
[174.96 - 178.48] know wheat and the food combining and
[176.88 - 180.16] the apple cider vinegar and activated
[178.48 - 181.60] charcoal and the fish oil and the
[180.16 - 184.64] probiotics and
[181.60 - 187.04] you know in the candida cleanses and
[184.64 - 189.36] did all of that and they've tried that
[187.04 - 191.92] and the parasitical cleanses and
[189.36 - 192.56] and their stories haven't been heard
[191.92 - 196.16] because it's
[192.56 - 197.84] long before social media and now
[196.16 - 199.44] everybody's swimming in the same stuff
[197.84 - 202.56] the same recycled stuff
[199.44 - 203.44] that old stuff that's come back people
[202.56 - 205.20] are playing in it
[203.44 - 206.80] people are you know doing stuff but when
[205.20 - 207.84] you're really sick we need more than
[206.80 - 209.92] that
[207.84 - 211.52] and it's important so what kind of
[209.92 - 213.60] symptom do you have
[211.52 - 215.60] you know what's the symptom do you have
[213.60 - 215.92] what's the condition do you have like
[215.60 - 217.36] you
[215.92 - 219.28] have let's talk about it because i want
[217.36 - 221.76] to answer some questions and everything
[219.28 - 222.40] so um so that's let's do that so let's
[221.76 - 225.36] do that
[222.40 - 226.32] and the bottom line is for so many
[225.36 - 228.72] people out there
[226.32 - 230.48] when you really get sick and you're
[228.72 - 232.48] really bogged down and you lose that
[230.48 - 233.92] quality of life with your symptom
[232.48 - 235.92] and then your condition and you're
[233.92 - 237.28] getting a diagnosis after diagnosis
[235.92 - 240.64] after diagnosis
[237.28 - 243.60] and you know it's really difficult and
[240.64 - 244.64] what i like is i like to know where's
[243.60 - 247.04] the answers
[244.64 - 248.32] where are they like are there answers
[247.04 - 249.68] because reasons research and science
[248.32 - 251.12] doesn't have the answers since that's
[249.68 - 253.04] what medical medium information has
[251.12 - 255.44] always been about if you're new here
[253.04 - 257.12] you're you're in a land of let's get
[255.44 - 258.16] down to the truth let's get down to the
[257.12 - 261.04] answers let's down to
[258.16 - 262.88] get down to the root causes and you know
[261.04 - 263.76] let's not get lost and have the blind
[262.88 - 266.24] leading the blind
[263.76 - 267.52] so let's answer some questions i'm here
[266.24 - 269.04] so i'm going to look over here to the
[267.52 - 271.84] monitors and
[269.04 - 274.08] i want to look at questions and some um
[271.84 - 275.52] lost 20 pounds so linda says i lost 20
[274.08 - 277.28] pounds feeling healthier
[275.52 - 278.56] thank you so much for opening my eyes to
[277.28 - 281.12] a lot of misinformation
[278.56 - 282.00] okay that's an incredible that's an
[281.12 - 284.16] incredible comment
[282.00 - 285.20] right there there linda in you know i
[284.16 - 287.52] hope everybody
[285.20 - 288.88] like sees or hears that comment and
[287.52 - 290.16] what's that about it's like
[288.88 - 292.00] there's tremendous amounts of
[290.16 - 293.36] misinformation out there and
[292.00 - 295.52] but it seems like all that
[293.36 - 296.64] misinformation is good because when not
[295.52 - 299.44] so sick people
[296.64 - 301.04] use it it's deceiving so linda must have
[299.44 - 302.32] really been through something she must
[301.04 - 303.76] have been really going through some
[302.32 - 305.84] things like the weight
[303.76 - 307.36] and and you weren't feeling good and you
[305.84 - 308.64] must have tried some things right linda
[307.36 - 310.16] because that's the whole thing and
[308.64 - 312.24] but what you'll find right now with
[310.16 - 314.80] social media and everything is that
[312.24 - 316.08] you know the same old recycled stuff all
[314.80 - 317.60] swimming around out there and when
[316.08 - 318.96] you're not so sick and you're a person
[317.60 - 320.00] with a symptom and you're trying this
[318.96 - 322.24] and this and you're
[320.00 - 323.36] selling this or doing that what happens
[322.24 - 325.20] is it looks like hey
[323.36 - 327.04] maybe that person's got the answer maybe
[325.20 - 329.36] that's it but when in the end
[327.04 - 331.52] it's all back to the same old recycled
[329.36 - 333.52] bin of old health information
[331.52 - 335.76] and never got people who really were
[333.52 - 338.00] struggling better and that's that's
[335.76 - 339.04] it makes all the difference it just does
[338.00 - 342.24] you guys
[339.04 - 344.08] is there anything you would so um surrey
[342.24 - 346.48] tuck says is there anything you would
[344.08 - 350.16] recommend for a seven-year-old boy
[346.48 - 353.52] who has just started developing ticks so
[350.16 - 356.72] okay so what i would do okay if my child
[353.52 - 358.16] was developing ticks okay um you know i
[356.72 - 359.68] would i would bring this
[358.16 - 360.80] information to the doctor first of all i
[359.68 - 362.72] would bring the information to the
[360.80 - 366.72] doctor with ticks and spasms because
[362.72 - 369.20] ticks and spasms and twitches
[366.72 - 370.64] all that's neurological so what i would
[369.20 - 372.88] do is i would bring
[370.64 - 375.12] the medical medium information to my
[372.88 - 376.64] doctor but i would look into the book
[375.12 - 380.16] and you start seeing that
[376.64 - 382.64] toxic heavy metals play a role they're
[380.16 - 384.16] the cause of so much of that and i get
[382.64 - 386.96] asked by doctors all the time
[384.16 - 388.24] and what happens is people don't realize
[386.96 - 390.48] half of my day
[388.24 - 392.00] like a big part of my day is answering
[390.48 - 393.76] doctor's questions
[392.00 - 396.00] so that's what happens so doctors
[393.76 - 397.76] contact you know they contact
[396.00 - 399.68] us i get on the phone with them and
[397.76 - 401.28] they're saying what do i do when i have
[399.68 - 402.72] children with ticks what do i do and i
[401.28 - 403.68] have children with spasms and i'll tell
[402.72 - 405.76] the doctors look
[403.68 - 407.20] you're looking at toxic heavy metals
[405.76 - 408.16] you're looking at mercury you're looking
[407.20 - 410.48] at aluminum
[408.16 - 412.08] so what i tell the doctor is look here's
[410.48 - 413.12] the stuff here's the different protocols
[412.08 - 416.08] you can work with
[413.12 - 417.76] and so they learn about this and and and
[416.08 - 419.36] so a big part of my day is answering
[417.76 - 420.80] doctor questions and that's one of the
[419.36 - 421.68] questions that i answer for doctors all
[420.80 - 424.32] the time
[421.68 - 425.36] and it's really important so and i tell
[424.32 - 427.36] doctors hey
[425.36 - 429.20] heavy metal detox smoothie heavy metal
[427.36 - 430.96] detox cleanse in here
[429.20 - 433.76] um you know and that's what i tell
[430.96 - 437.76] doctors to help their patients with so
[433.76 - 440.40] it's a really good question
[437.76 - 443.44] why do i keep getting sinus and ear
[440.40 - 446.16] infections that's from tina thomas
[443.44 - 447.92] um so you obviously been to your doctor
[446.16 - 449.52] you've been to your practitioners and
[447.92 - 451.28] you know you've been to your ears nose
[449.52 - 451.92] and throat doctor and you're still
[451.28 - 453.20] getting these
[451.92 - 454.64] you're still getting these sinus
[453.20 - 455.84] infections still getting these ear
[454.64 - 458.56] infections
[455.84 - 460.08] and i mean once again though i would i
[458.56 - 461.76] mean if i was dealing with that dealing
[460.08 - 462.80] with ear infections dealing with sinus
[461.76 - 466.16] infections
[462.80 - 469.52] um and i had an ent that that uh
[466.16 - 472.88] contacted me last week i usually get
[469.52 - 474.00] one or two ents um a month that that
[472.88 - 477.36] contact me
[474.00 - 479.60] contact me and and so what ents are
[477.36 - 480.96] always what they're always um
[479.60 - 482.32] ears nose and throat doctors are always
[480.96 - 484.08] concerned about is look i don't want to
[482.32 - 485.12] use too many antibiotics on my patients
[484.08 - 487.76] that's what i hear
[485.12 - 489.76] you know and they'll ask me like how do
[487.76 - 492.16] you do this how do you avoid the
[489.76 - 494.48] antibiotics because doctors don't
[492.16 - 496.08] want to keep on prescribing antibiotics
[494.48 - 497.36] every 10 seconds i mean i talked to so
[496.08 - 499.28] many doctors they're like look
[497.36 - 500.40] i've been prescribing antibiotics for 20
[499.28 - 502.16] years in my practice
[500.40 - 504.24] all the time for all these different
[502.16 - 505.04] things what do i do and i said well
[504.24 - 506.80] first of all
[505.04 - 508.56] it's about getting down to the true
[506.80 - 510.80] cause of the root cause like if it's
[508.56 - 513.36] bacteria you're concerned about
[510.80 - 514.96] what bacteria is and so the doctors
[513.36 - 516.40] think and i had me and he talked to me
[514.96 - 517.20] last week and he said what do you think
[516.40 - 518.96] and i said well
[517.20 - 521.36] would i would the information i got from
[518.96 - 523.36] spirit of compassion is it streptococcus
[521.36 - 524.96] and and the cnt was like you know that
[523.36 - 527.68] makes a lot of sense
[524.96 - 529.20] because um in in his wheelhouse it just
[527.68 - 530.80] made tremendous amount of sense
[529.20 - 532.48] and there's over 50 groups of
[530.80 - 533.12] streptococcus and there's hundreds of
[532.48 - 534.96] strains
[533.12 - 536.72] hundreds of strains but there's over 50
[534.96 - 537.92] groups many of them unidentified by
[536.72 - 541.20] research and science
[537.92 - 542.96] and and they get antibiotic resistance
[541.20 - 544.40] so at this time i talked to the cnt
[542.96 - 545.68] about it and everything i was talking to
[544.40 - 547.68] them and i told them what happens is
[545.68 - 549.44] they get more antibiotic resistant
[547.68 - 550.64] and then you take antibiotics again and
[549.44 - 552.24] you got the years nose and throat
[550.64 - 553.68] infections take the antibiotics again
[552.24 - 554.48] and the sinus infections chronic
[553.68 - 555.92] sinusitis
[554.48 - 558.24] but i talked about in cleanse the heal
[555.92 - 560.16] when i was telling him i talked about it
[558.24 - 562.16] that it's down to figuring out
[560.16 - 564.08] streptococcus what to do to support it
[562.16 - 565.92] i'm not against antibiotics you know i
[564.08 - 566.96] never were because what happens is when
[565.92 - 569.36] people
[566.96 - 570.96] they haven't learned how to take care of
[569.36 - 572.72] themselves and they haven't learned how
[570.96 - 573.92] to heal and they haven't learned what to
[572.72 - 576.08] do
[573.92 - 578.00] and they get into a jam and it's whoa
[576.08 - 578.64] what do i do i gotta get to my doctor i
[578.00 - 580.96] gotta get the
[578.64 - 582.16] antibiotic for my uti i gotta get the
[580.96 - 583.84] antibiotic for my
[582.16 - 586.08] my sinus infection i have to get the
[583.84 - 588.24] antibiotic for the sty i have
[586.08 - 589.60] and this all streptococcus you know and
[588.24 - 591.36] so um
[589.60 - 592.64] so it's good to learn in everything if
[591.36 - 594.08] you don't have cleanser he'll go to the

[691.60 - 694.64] demand you have four children and you're
[693.44 - 697.28] working hard
[694.64 - 698.72] and um and you don't have a luxury in
[697.28 - 700.08] the moment to be like okay let me just
[698.72 - 701.92] spend the next six months
[700.08 - 704.56] just making peanut butter smoothie bowls
[701.92 - 705.52] and taking instagram pics and i get it i
[704.56 - 707.12] get it so just
[705.52 - 709.04] what i would do what i would do though
[707.12 - 710.88] with with with that is
[709.04 - 712.08] morning cleanse is something you can do
[710.88 - 715.12] it's easier
[712.08 - 716.48] that's something right there so uh
[715.12 - 718.48] you know when you're that busy and you
[716.48 - 720.48] got that much going on maybe just start
[718.48 - 721.04] with the celery juice you want to lose
[720.48 - 722.48] weight
[721.04 - 725.20] start with the celery juice to get the
[722.48 - 728.40] liver less stagnant less sluggish
[725.20 - 729.44] and you know just do that and that's one
[728.40 - 730.80] thing you can start
[729.44 - 733.04] i'm not saying that's going to get the
[730.80 - 735.92] weight off it's a place to start so you
[733.04 - 737.92] can get improvements wherever you can
[735.92 - 739.84] and then maybe move into the morning
[737.92 - 740.88] cleanse where it's just the morning
[739.84 - 742.80] cleanse
[740.88 - 744.72] because i know you have to work hard i
[742.80 - 746.64] know you have kids i know you're you're
[744.72 - 747.92] in you have 10 jobs
[746.64 - 750.40] so that's what it sounds like you have
[747.92 - 752.96] 10 jobs going on and so
[750.40 - 754.64] with that just maybe maybe look into the
[752.96 - 755.92] morning cleanse go straight to that
[754.64 - 757.68] in cleanse the heel that's what i
[755.92 - 759.52] recommend and just say what can i do in
[757.68 - 761.76] here whoa i could do the lemon water
[759.52 - 763.36] how about that that could at least flush
[761.76 - 765.20] your system in the morning
[763.36 - 766.56] so the liver starts waking up so you can
[765.20 - 768.56] start losing a little bit of weight
[766.56 - 770.24] that's one way of doing it you do lemon
[768.56 - 771.52] water maybe try to get a celery juice if
[770.24 - 774.08] you can't do the celery juice
[771.52 - 775.28] do the lemon water and then and then do
[774.08 - 777.04] the rest of the morning cleanse where
[775.28 - 778.96] you just eat some fruit in the morning
[777.04 - 780.88] to get you through the morning so you're
[778.96 - 782.56] not doing any fats in the morning
[780.88 - 783.84] so this way your liver gets a chance and
[782.56 - 785.20] you can start losing a little bit of
[783.84 - 787.52] weight that could really help
[785.20 - 788.56] and maybe it you know in the lemon water
[787.52 - 791.52] is not eight ounces
[788.56 - 792.80] it's 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water kind
[791.52 - 794.48] of keep that in mind like
[792.80 - 795.76] that's a really big orange juice right
[794.48 - 797.20] here fresh squeezed orange juice from a
[795.76 - 798.64] dinner tonight
[797.20 - 801.04] and that's really big one i still have
[798.64 - 804.40] some celery juice left right here but
[801.04 - 806.40] okay angela hi i've been drinking celery
[804.40 - 808.56] juice for two years
[806.40 - 810.56] finally some relief from migraines thank
[808.56 - 812.80] you so grateful okay angela
[810.56 - 813.76] first of all you're my hero remember
[812.80 - 815.44] this right here
[813.76 - 817.44] you're drinking celery juice for two
[815.44 - 820.24] years you didn't
[817.44 - 820.80] let any kind of stupid talk out there
[820.24 - 822.88] about
[820.80 - 824.16] someone saying i tried it for seven days
[822.88 - 826.16] it didn't work for me oh
[824.16 - 827.60] okay great you know i love when people
[826.16 - 828.08] do that out there when they're not so
[827.60 - 830.48] sick
[828.08 - 831.12] when you suffer from migraines that
[830.48 - 833.04] means
[831.12 - 834.24] you're really struggling you got a lot
[833.04 - 836.08] going on there and
[834.24 - 837.44] what i've noticed is the people who pick
[836.08 - 839.52] on celery juice
[837.44 - 840.96] the people who pick on celery juice are
[839.52 - 842.32] people who
[840.96 - 844.00] they don't know what it's like to suffer
[842.32 - 846.00] from migraines you see
[844.00 - 847.60] you see what i'm saying right they'll
[846.00 - 848.56] just be like they got a little bit of
[847.60 - 850.00] this or a little bit of that and they're
[848.56 - 851.52] trying all these fun things and they're
[850.00 - 853.28] doing their social media thing but
[851.52 - 854.72] then they'll say i tried celery juice it
[853.28 - 855.84] didn't work or
[854.72 - 857.04] they won't talk about seller juice
[855.84 - 858.16] because there's no money to be made off
[857.04 - 860.24] of it you know you can't get a
[858.16 - 861.84] sponsorship for celery juice on social
[860.24 - 862.32] media you know so there's no money to be
[861.84 - 864.96] made
[862.32 - 867.12] so people keep it quiet you know and but
[864.96 - 868.40] the point is is you stayed with it
[867.12 - 870.40] you know what it's like to have
[868.40 - 872.24] migraines you know what it's like out
[870.40 - 873.20] there how the blinds leading the blind
[872.24 - 874.64] you know what it's like when the
[873.20 - 875.68] research in science what does research
[874.64 - 876.48] and science have the answers for
[875.68 - 878.56] migraines
[876.48 - 880.32] they don't and that's the sad part
[878.56 - 882.00] celery just for two years and
[880.32 - 883.60] are you doing some other things too so
[882.00 - 885.04] are you still are you getting into the
[883.60 - 886.48] medical media information are you doing
[885.04 - 887.44] other stuff too are you working with it
[886.48 - 888.64] you look into the headaches and
[887.44 - 891.44] migraines section
[888.64 - 893.84] um and i'm proud of you i just want you
[891.44 - 897.12] to know that just blown away
[893.84 - 899.84] fibroids um okay
[897.12 - 900.72] so jacob jackie so if i so the thing is
[899.84 - 903.04] with
[900.72 - 904.08] fibroids is i talk about what causes
[903.04 - 906.24] fibroids
[904.08 - 908.32] and so when you go in here you'll see
[906.24 - 910.88] what causes them and then
[908.32 - 911.76] you'll learn what foods to avoid for
[910.88 - 915.76] fibroids
[911.76 - 917.28] fibroids are hungry they are hungry
[915.76 - 918.88] they actually have these little blood
[917.28 - 922.40] vessels that come out of them
[918.88 - 924.88] and they they draw in nutrients
[922.40 - 926.00] and nutrients that they like that
[924.88 - 928.64] fibroids like and
[926.00 - 929.84] in order to stop growing fibroids what
[928.64 - 932.08] happens with a lot of women that gets
[929.84 - 934.40] fibroid surgeries
[932.08 - 935.52] um and and that's really difficult to go
[934.40 - 938.32] through that
[935.52 - 939.92] and what i like to do okay and i have a
[938.32 - 941.28] friend that came to me recently with
[939.92 - 943.20] fibroids and i said
[941.28 - 944.48] you know um how are they doing my friend
[943.20 - 945.68] said well my doctor says you're getting
[944.48 - 946.80] better and better from
[945.68 - 949.12] from all the stuff that you're
[946.80 - 949.68] recommending and so they're avoiding
[949.12 - 952.48] surgery
[949.68 - 954.40] because her fibroids are getting better
[952.48 - 956.00] and so she did a check-in recently an
[954.40 - 957.36] old friend of mine she says look my
[956.00 - 959.36] doctor's amazed
[957.36 - 961.28] my you know i'm doing the celery juice
[959.36 - 962.96] i'm staying off of eggs
[961.28 - 965.04] i'm staying off of eggs my doctor was
[962.96 - 966.48] very worried about that thought i needed
[965.04 - 969.68] the egg protein
[966.48 - 971.44] and then um i let my doctor know that
[969.68 - 973.52] the anthony you said that eggs feed
[971.44 - 974.56] fibroids the doctor learned something
[973.52 - 977.60] and learned that
[974.56 - 978.24] fibroids actually eat um eat by products
[977.60 - 979.92] from eggs
[978.24 - 981.28] and draw them up their draw them up
[979.92 - 982.48] their blood vessels and they grow grow
[981.28 - 984.32] grow
[982.48 - 986.00] so that was just one example there so i
[984.32 - 987.92] would just learn i would learn what
[986.00 - 988.88] causes the fibroids go into the section
[987.92 - 990.72] here you'll see the different
[988.88 - 992.08] supplementation and protocols
[990.72 - 996.00] you can take it to your doctor too
[992.08 - 998.08] whatever works
[996.00 - 999.04] so and there's there's thousands of
[998.08 - 1000.96] combinations
[999.04 - 1002.48] in here in cleanse the heel and medical
[1000.96 - 1003.92] medium information medical medium books
[1002.48 - 1005.84] it's not one protocol
[1003.92 - 1007.60] customize it to yourself whether you're
[1005.84 - 1009.60] plant-based whether you're you know
[1007.60 - 1011.28] vegetarian whether you're animal protein
[1009.60 - 1012.72] based whether you like animal proteins
[1011.28 - 1015.84] whatever whether you're keto
[1012.72 - 1017.52] keto animal keto plant whatever you like
[1015.84 - 1019.44] the whole point is it's about answers
[1017.52 - 1019.92] and what to do and the protocols that
[1019.44 - 1022.00] you can
[1019.92 - 1023.28] go into your diet belief system with
[1022.00 - 1024.32] because everybody gets sick
[1023.28 - 1026.40] that's the whole thing you guys
[1024.32 - 1027.28] everybody gets sick whether anybody
[1026.40 - 1029.60] likes it or not
[1027.28 - 1031.20] or knows about that or not everybody
[1029.60 - 1033.36] gets sick so that's what happens out
[1031.20 - 1033.36] there
[1037.68 - 1040.88] so i'm just looking through the
[1038.88 - 1042.64] questions right now on the monitor and
[1040.88 - 1045.12] there's there's there's so so much to
[1042.64 - 1046.64] answer jamie says fibroid issues too i
[1045.12 - 1047.44] hope you catch that what i just talked
[1046.64 - 1053.76] about
[1047.44 - 1056.88] um i hope you caught that
[1053.76 - 1058.48] see um so mary's
[1056.88 - 1061.44] mary c you see fatty liver and
[1058.48 - 1062.72] hashimoto's remember with fatty liver
[1061.44 - 1065.04] and you'll read in the medical meaning
[1062.72 - 1067.44] books like fatty liver
[1065.04 - 1068.80] that's a stagnant sluggish liver and
[1067.44 - 1071.60] high fat diets
[1068.80 - 1073.60] years of high fat diets will lead to a
[1071.60 - 1075.92] fatty liver and
[1073.60 - 1077.28] hashimoto's is viral so you go in here
[1075.92 - 1079.36] into the back of the book and you'll see
[1077.28 - 1081.44] hashimoto's thyroiditis
[1079.36 - 1082.72] thyroid nodules hypothyroidism
[1081.44 - 1084.00] hyperthyroidism
[1082.72 - 1086.00] and you're learning here that
[1084.00 - 1087.60] epstein-barr virus creates all those
[1086.00 - 1088.96] thyroid problems and you learn about
[1087.60 - 1089.52] that and you'll learn about well what do
[1088.96 - 1091.36] i do
[1089.52 - 1092.84] and the book talks about that it walks
[1091.36 - 1096.48] you through
[1092.84 - 1098.24] um and so much information about that
[1096.48 - 1099.84] of how it works epstein-barr isn't just
[1098.24 - 1102.08] this one virus so
[1099.84 - 1104.00] medical medium information is very
[1102.08 - 1106.48] advanced extremely advanced and far
[1104.00 - 1107.92] ahead of research and science by decades
[1106.48 - 1108.40] and what research and science doesn't
[1107.92 - 1110.64] know
[1108.40 - 1112.16] is that there's over 60 varieties now of
[1110.64 - 1115.36] epstein-barr virus
[1112.16 - 1116.56] and in those 60 varieties there's
[1115.36 - 1119.36] different kinds
[1116.56 - 1120.88] and they're not easy detectable they get
[1119.36 - 1122.48] into the thyroid
[1120.88 - 1125.44] science research doesn't know this or
[1122.48 - 1127.20] how it works um it creates hashimoto's
[1125.44 - 1128.72] it sits in the liver first makes the
[1127.20 - 1130.56] liver all stagnant and sluggish then
[1128.72 - 1133.36] when you're doing the high fat diets
[1130.56 - 1135.20] you get you know it gets problematic if
[1133.36 - 1138.80] i had a fatty liver
[1135.20 - 1141.20] um i would be like no eggs no butter
[1138.80 - 1143.20] no milk no cheese that's what i would do
[1141.20 - 1145.44] no eggs milk butter cheese
[1143.20 - 1146.72] gone right and if i was an animal
[1145.44 - 1148.80] protein person
[1146.72 - 1150.56] i would i would minimize my animal
[1148.80 - 1152.32] protein i'll just drop them down
[1150.56 - 1153.92] and make sure i'm getting more of other
[1152.32 - 1155.68] things i talk about in the books
[1153.92 - 1157.68] go to library get the book for free so
[1155.68 - 1159.12] you can learn that's what i recommend
[1157.68 - 1161.28] don't even buy the book go to the
[1159.12 - 1162.00] library get the book out so you didn't
[1161.28 - 1163.84] pay for it
[1162.00 - 1165.68] and start learning you know go do that
[1163.84 - 1166.48] too you'd also get it on amazon if you
[1165.68 - 1168.00] don't want to
[1166.48 - 1169.04] try to get the book out of the library
[1168.00 - 1171.44] and you really want the book or
[1169.04 - 1175.68] something say amazon it's a sale 51
[1171.44 - 1178.40] off um so lena says body swelling and
[1175.68 - 1180.16] chronic bloating so you know it comes
[1178.40 - 1182.16] down to chronic bloating which is really
[1180.16 - 1183.36] hard for so many people i talked about
[1182.16 - 1184.72] bloating because
[1183.36 - 1186.56] bloating can make it so you can't
[1184.72 - 1188.08] breathe you feel like you can't breathe
[1186.56 - 1189.28] good you can't feel like you can't take
[1188.08 - 1191.44] a deep breath
[1189.28 - 1192.64] you can't get air in it gets in the way
[1191.44 - 1194.08] when you're walking
[1192.64 - 1195.84] it gets in the way when you're just
[1194.08 - 1197.60] driving when you're driving the car
[1195.84 - 1199.68] i know people that when they're driving
[1197.60 - 1202.48] driving their car and they're bloated it
[1199.68 - 1204.16] just makes it so difficult and so hard
[1202.48 - 1205.52] carrying things makes it so hard so i'm
[1204.16 - 1207.52] so sorry you're going with you know the
[1205.52 - 1210.40] chronic bloating and the swelling
[1207.52 - 1211.60] um and you know and i've talked about
[1210.40 - 1214.16] this for years and what i
[1211.60 - 1215.68] i this is a question that i always get
[1214.16 - 1218.88] asked by doctors
[1215.68 - 1220.32] um that's another thing too so and
[1218.88 - 1222.72] doctors would be like well i got this
[1220.32 - 1225.92] patient you know and what do i do
[1222.72 - 1227.52] and chronic bloating and and you know
[1225.92 - 1229.44] and so i'm like okay first of all
[1227.52 - 1230.96] we we got a liver issue and that's what
[1229.44 - 1232.16] i would tell you know a doctor and they
[1230.96 - 1233.44] would also send me looking they're
[1232.16 - 1235.20] looking for liver enzymes they're
[1233.44 - 1236.48] looking for liver problems
[1235.20 - 1238.48] and that's one thing that's really
[1236.48 - 1240.40] helpful um the other thing with
[1238.48 - 1241.76] with that kind of bloating and that kind
[1240.40 - 1243.68] of uh everything
[1241.76 - 1246.00] is just know that your hydrochloric acid
[1243.68 - 1248.48] is low and i've taught doctors that how
[1246.00 - 1250.96] hydrochloric acid becomes really low
[1248.48 - 1252.24] um and learn the true cause of bloating
[1250.96 - 1253.84] so what i would do is
[1252.24 - 1255.20] once again cleanse the heal learn the
[1253.84 - 1256.32] true cause of bloating you can bring it
[1255.20 - 1258.00] to your practitioner
[1256.32 - 1260.16] but there's so so much you can do with
[1258.00 - 1262.48] that there's so much you can do
[1260.16 - 1263.36] um but bloating is one of those things
[1262.48 - 1265.68] where if
[1263.36 - 1267.12] i had bloating i'd get rid of milk
[1265.68 - 1270.48] cheese butter
[1267.12 - 1271.68] eggs gone i'd get rid of gluten gone
[1270.48 - 1274.40] because those are gonna feed
[1271.68 - 1275.92] any kind of bugs so with a lot of
[1274.40 - 1277.92] different bloating cases you'll have
[1275.92 - 1279.04] streptococcus in the intestinal tract
[1277.92 - 1280.40] that's causing the bloating your
[1279.04 - 1282.16] hydrochloric acid is low
[1280.40 - 1284.24] so i get rid of those foods is what i
[1282.16 - 1285.92] would do and then i would get the celery
[1284.24 - 1287.44] juice going every single morning lemon
[1285.92 - 1287.84] water going every single morning and i
[1287.44 - 1290.72] would
[1287.84 - 1292.56] start to rebuild my hydrochloric acid
[1290.72 - 1295.20] because i start getting my liver bile
[1292.56 - 1297.36] reserves back up getting my liver back
[1295.20 - 1298.32] i mean that's already the start right
[1297.36 - 1301.60] there which is so
[1298.32 - 1303.36] important um karen says
[1301.60 - 1304.72] inflammation i've tried your celery
[1303.36 - 1306.72] juice it's helping
[1304.72 - 1308.24] so okay karen so that's awesome because
[1306.72 - 1311.28] inflammation is a mystery
[1308.24 - 1312.48] to science research so so alternative
[1311.28 - 1313.84] medicine doesn't know what causes
[1312.48 - 1316.16] inflammation they think a
[1313.84 - 1317.92] food causes inflammation so they're not
[1316.16 - 1319.36] really advanced yet i know that's going
[1317.92 - 1320.64] to get someone upset right now you're
[1319.36 - 1322.56] like how's he saying that
[1320.64 - 1324.48] well it's true it's true alternate
[1322.56 - 1326.08] medicine they don't know what causes
[1324.48 - 1327.12] inflammation it's mysterious to
[1326.08 - 1328.72] alternative medicine
[1327.12 - 1330.16] it's mysterious to conventional medicine
[1328.72 - 1331.52] unless you've been injured that's
[1330.16 - 1333.68] different
[1331.52 - 1335.32] so with alternative medicine they'll say
[1333.68 - 1338.56] well gluten causes
[1335.32 - 1340.08] inflammation not true how come there's
[1338.56 - 1342.80] all these people that could eat
[1340.08 - 1343.60] all the gluten they want all the cheese
[1342.80 - 1345.44] pizza
[1343.60 - 1346.96] and they can eat dairy and they can eat
[1345.44 - 1349.28] whatever they want and they can have
[1346.96 - 1350.48] they can eat and you probably people you
[1349.28 - 1351.44] guys probably know some friends that can
[1350.48 - 1352.96] eat whatever they want they're not
[1351.44 - 1353.76] talking about inflammation are you
[1352.96 - 1355.92] kidding
[1353.76 - 1356.80] and because what it is it's not the
[1355.92 - 1359.04] gluten
[1356.80 - 1360.00] that causes inflammation it's like
[1359.04 - 1362.88] gluten and things like
[1360.00 - 1364.72] that that help feed a buggy in us that
[1362.88 - 1367.60] causes inflammation so it's
[1364.72 - 1369.28] bugs inside of us pathogens that create
[1367.60 - 1372.24] the inflammation
[1369.28 - 1373.76] not our body and not the foods and
[1372.24 - 1375.44] that's why i don't have a food diet
[1373.76 - 1376.80] belief system because i think someone
[1375.44 - 1378.16] can eat it whatever they want they got
[1376.80 - 1379.76] nothing going wrong with them
[1378.16 - 1381.28] i also you know and i also think they
[1379.76 - 1383.28] need to be eating really clean
[1381.28 - 1384.80] in the right way information in here if
[1383.28 - 1386.64] they got something wrong with them
[1384.80 - 1388.56] so um but that's amazing i'm glad it's
[1386.64 - 1389.28] helping incredible celery juices helping
[1388.56 - 1391.52] wonderful
[1389.28 - 1391.52] so
[1392.32 - 1397.76] so we got um some mallory
[1396.08 - 1399.36] okay got a question here chronic lyme
[1397.76 - 1403.20] disease fatigue
[1399.36 - 1405.36] chronic headaches neck pain daily
[1403.20 - 1406.96] so do you know the cause of lyme disease
[1405.36 - 1407.68] have you learned about that yet and just
[1406.96 - 1409.52] wondering
[1407.68 - 1411.36] because the cause of lyme disease is in
[1409.52 - 1412.00] the cleanse of heel book whole section
[1411.36 - 1413.60] on it
[1412.00 - 1415.20] just wondering if you learned that yet
[1413.60 - 1416.64] about what's going on so
[1415.20 - 1418.88] go to the library get the book out for
[1416.64 - 1419.92] free okay um people say i'm always
[1418.88 - 1421.20] trying to show the book because i'm
[1419.92 - 1423.12] trying to sell the book or something
[1421.20 - 1424.96] like that well can i tell you something
[1423.12 - 1426.72] i could break this book up in pieces and
[1424.96 - 1427.76] sell ten thousand dollar programs and
[1426.72 - 1430.16] have people come
[1427.76 - 1431.52] i mean i'm worldwide known we know that
[1430.16 - 1432.56] millions of books are out there around
[1431.52 - 1434.24] the world
[1432.56 - 1435.84] i can turn this into two thousand dollar
[1434.24 - 1438.80] programs tomorrow and
[1435.84 - 1440.56] forget selling a book i can sell massive
[1438.80 - 1443.68] amounts of programs and have paid
[1440.56 - 1445.12] people pay tons of money i don't i try
[1443.68 - 1447.28] to make this a free resource
[1445.12 - 1448.80] it's a medical textbook i killed myself
[1447.28 - 1450.64] basically to write it with spirit of
[1448.80 - 1454.40] compassion because
[1450.64 - 1457.44] to put this together in just a year is
[1454.40 - 1458.96] is unheard of and so when
[1457.44 - 1460.64] when you get this book though i mean
[1458.96 - 1462.56] just look go to the library get it for
[1460.64 - 1463.36] free or amazon.com or something so i'm
[1462.56 - 1465.36] not trying to
[1463.36 - 1467.44] push a book on you but what i do want
[1465.36 - 1468.32] you to have is the answers and with lyme
[1467.44 - 1470.40] disease
[1468.32 - 1472.24] so we've got chronic lyme disease you're
[1470.40 - 1473.60] dealing with fatigue chronic headaches
[1472.24 - 1476.40] and neck pain
[1473.60 - 1478.00] and what happens is that science
[1476.40 - 1479.60] research doesn't know what causes lyme
[1478.00 - 1481.60] disease anymore so they moved it out of
[1479.60 - 1484.64] the category of bacteria
[1481.60 - 1486.32] and they moved it into autoimmune now
[1484.64 - 1488.40] that's partly because of medical media
[1486.32 - 1490.00] information all the books
[1488.40 - 1493.36] that went out talking about the truth
[1490.00 - 1495.60] about lyme pushed it out of the bacteria
[1493.36 - 1497.28] category so now it's in the autoimmune
[1495.60 - 1498.72] category right where
[1497.28 - 1500.00] it belongs for science and research
[1498.72 - 1501.12] because they don't know the cause of it
[1500.00 - 1503.28] so learn the cause
[1501.12 - 1505.60] it's viral so lyme disease is viral so
[1503.28 - 1507.60] when you look at the symptoms fatigue
[1505.60 - 1509.60] that's viral so you can actually find
[1507.60 - 1510.96] that information in here you'll see
[1509.60 - 1513.36] you'll see in the lyme section you'll
[1510.96 - 1515.12] see protocols you'll see dosages of
[1513.36 - 1516.40] protocols take it to your doctor
[1515.12 - 1517.76] take it to your doctor and you can take
[1516.40 - 1518.72] a look at it if i was diagnosed with
[1517.76 - 1520.48] lyme disease
[1518.72 - 1522.24] i'd be going through here in the
[1520.48 - 1522.64] protocol supplements and dosages and
[1522.24 - 1524.64] learn
[1522.64 - 1526.16] how to do it you can read all about it
[1524.64 - 1527.68] you know talk to your practitioner about
[1526.16 - 1530.48] if you've got a practitioner you love
[1527.68 - 1531.36] dr you love but um and that's the
[1530.48 - 1533.36] biggest
[1531.36 - 1535.36] that's the biggest question i get with
[1533.36 - 1536.96] doctors doctors contacting me
[1535.36 - 1538.16] like every single day i have to donate a
[1536.96 - 1538.96] certain part of my day and talk to
[1538.16 - 1541.12] doctors
[1538.96 - 1542.08] um because they reach out and when the
[1541.12 - 1545.12] biggest question is
[1542.08 - 1547.44] lyme disease anthony you you basically
[1545.12 - 1548.40] pushed lyme out of the bacteria category
[1547.44 - 1549.52] because now
[1548.40 - 1551.92] science research doesn't know what
[1549.52 - 1553.20] causes lyme the lyme labs still don't
[1551.92 - 1554.32] want to lose their business
[1553.20 - 1555.60] they don't want to lose their business
[1554.32 - 1556.88] so they're still testing for they're
[1555.60 - 1558.24] still saying they're testing for
[1556.88 - 1560.16] bacteria
[1558.24 - 1562.40] what a scam that whole thing is and then
[1560.16 - 1564.08] with with all that but it's really viral
[1562.40 - 1565.76] and it's really sad how it works i want
[1564.08 - 1566.72] you to have the answers you know it's
[1565.76 - 1568.96] not about
[1566.72 - 1570.40] i don't care who i get upset out there
[1568.96 - 1572.32] you know in the industries
[1570.40 - 1574.16] it's i just want you to have the answer
[1572.32 - 1576.72] because when you're sick
[1574.16 - 1578.80] and your body hurts and you get fatigue
[1576.72 - 1581.84] and you have all these diagnoses and
[1578.80 - 1583.28] you're still sick and still sick and you
[1581.84 - 1585.04] probably are smart enough to know at
[1583.28 - 1587.12] that point that
[1585.04 - 1588.80] the health trends aren't what's fix it
[1587.12 - 1590.00] going to fix it no apple cider vinegar
[1588.80 - 1592.40] is going to fix that
[1590.00 - 1594.48] i mean what a joke that is right i mean
[1592.40 - 1596.00] what happens is when you're not so sick
[1594.48 - 1598.00] and you can play around with all these
[1596.00 - 1599.60] fun things on a circuit and spread
[1598.00 - 1601.04] it around and everybody thinks it's an
[1599.60 - 1601.92] answer to have apple cider vinegar as an
[1601.04 - 1603.92] answer
[1601.92 - 1605.04] it's amazing but the bottom line is i
[1603.92 - 1606.56] know you've been through hell and back
[1605.04 - 1607.12] if you're that sick and you dealt with
[1606.56 - 1613.84] lyme
[1607.12 - 1613.84] i want you to have the answers
[1620.88 - 1624.72] so linda says i'm trying to figure out
[1622.72 - 1625.44] what causes my husband's ulcerative
[1624.72 - 1628.08] colitis
[1625.44 - 1629.04] ulcerative colitis is brutal i here's an
[1628.08 - 1631.36] example here
[1629.04 - 1632.64] is that people don't really get it
[1631.36 - 1633.28] unless they've gone through something
[1632.64 - 1634.88] like that
[1633.28 - 1636.56] it's like same thing with like the lyme
[1634.88 - 1638.96] disease before they like
[1636.56 - 1640.64] you don't know what it's like to be sick
[1638.96 - 1641.52] unless you've been there you know i've
[1640.64 - 1645.04] really been there
[1641.52 - 1648.40] ulcerative colitis just awful and
[1645.04 - 1650.08] um it's women get ulcerative clients men
[1648.40 - 1651.20] get ulcerative colitis it's really a
[1650.08 - 1653.28] tough one and
[1651.20 - 1654.96] um and that's a question i also get
[1653.28 - 1656.08] asked by doctors too is colitis and
[1654.96 - 1658.00] different things like that and there's
[1656.08 - 1660.64] different levels of colitis there's
[1658.00 - 1661.60] there's mild bleeding with ulcerative
[1660.64 - 1662.80] colitis there's
[1661.60 - 1665.28] heavy and extreme bleeding with
[1662.80 - 1668.32] ulcerative colitis there's cramping
[1665.28 - 1669.20] brutal pain and there's also there's
[1668.32 - 1670.80] also
[1669.20 - 1672.48] forms of colitis that you don't
[1670.80 - 1672.88] hemorrhage and you're not bleeding at
[1672.48 - 1676.08] all
[1672.88 - 1677.60] but you but you got colitis and when you
[1676.08 - 1679.60] look and cleanse the heel
[1677.60 - 1681.52] you'll see the shingles section so
[1679.60 - 1683.76] that's where i would go in the shingle
[1681.52 - 1686.64] section you'll find colitis
[1683.76 - 1687.68] and what i've always recommended with
[1686.64 - 1689.84] anybody
[1687.68 - 1691.36] like any any doctors that have sent
[1689.84 - 1693.36] their people to me
[1691.36 - 1695.52] years ago when i used to help people out
[1693.36 - 1697.76] and you know years and years ago
[1695.52 - 1699.76] what what i would always do is is do the
[1697.76 - 1701.60] mono eating cleanses when it comes down
[1699.76 - 1702.56] to colitis it'd be the mono eating
[1701.60 - 1704.96] cleanses
[1702.56 - 1706.24] and that that i found was always the
[1704.96 - 1708.72] best options
[1706.24 - 1710.16] and and i get asked it all the time by
[1708.72 - 1711.92] doctors now they're always like well
[1710.16 - 1713.12] what do we do for colitis
[1711.92 - 1714.48] what do we do with our patients for
[1713.12 - 1716.64] clients and i'm like look the mono
[1714.48 - 1719.20] eating cleanse is for colitis and
[1716.64 - 1720.16] take a look at that and so it's just but
[1719.20 - 1722.80] yeah it
[1720.16 - 1724.00] the shingles virus is behind the whole
[1722.80 - 1726.08] colitis thing it's
[1724.00 - 1728.00] it's it's in the lining of the in the
[1726.08 - 1729.68] intestinal tract so shingles sits in the
[1728.00 - 1731.04] lining of the intestinal tract
[1729.68 - 1735.04] you can talk to your doctor bring the
[1731.04 - 1735.04] information i recommend that all the
[1736.84 - 1739.84] time
[1741.20 - 1745.04] so rebecca you got neurological stuff
[1743.04 - 1746.40] going on so your question is involuntary
[1745.04 - 1749.44] movements
[1746.40 - 1751.12] yeah that's the jerking um the whole
[1749.44 - 1752.72] jerking thing is really
[1751.12 - 1754.40] really hard for people when they have
[1752.72 - 1756.16] that so right sometimes it happens when
[1754.40 - 1757.84] you're right before you even fall asleep
[1756.16 - 1759.20] but it's like crazy where the jerks keep
[1757.84 - 1760.88] on waking you up you're falling asleep
[1759.20 - 1762.16] and then you're jerking waking you up
[1760.88 - 1763.44] you're falling asleep and then you're
[1762.16 - 1764.48] it's just unbelievable what happens and
[1763.44 - 1766.24] you're probably having them during the
[1764.48 - 1768.16] daytime too from what it looks like
[1766.24 - 1769.36] voluntary movements vibrations
[1768.16 - 1770.80] vibrations when you feel like your
[1769.36 - 1772.72] body's humming and buzzing and your
[1770.80 - 1774.56] body's like vibrating and you're
[1772.72 - 1776.56] you're doing this hummingbuzzy vibrating
[1774.56 - 1776.96] thing that's really difficult too those
[1776.56 - 1778.80] are
[1776.96 - 1780.00] mysterious neurological symptoms to
[1778.80 - 1783.28] research in science they
[1780.00 - 1785.52] don't know what that stuff is and back
[1783.28 - 1786.56] like oh my god like and that's the
[1785.52 - 1788.32] difference right there where you're
[1786.56 - 1790.56] dealing with all that rebecca and
[1788.32 - 1792.16] so you're no fool you know the wool's
[1790.56 - 1793.52] not pulled over your eyes as far as
[1792.16 - 1794.80] research and science having all the
[1793.52 - 1796.16] answers you know
[1794.80 - 1797.84] you know that you've probably been to
[1796.16 - 1799.36] god knows how many doctors with that how
[1797.84 - 1801.44] many neurologists is worth
[1799.36 - 1802.48] like with that so just know my heart
[1801.44 - 1804.72] pours out to you
[1802.48 - 1806.56] rebecca for going through that and you
[1804.72 - 1809.36] understand not the person who's
[1806.56 - 1809.84] a troll or not so sick or not sick and
[1809.36 - 1812.00] they just
[1809.84 - 1814.32] don't even understand just throw like
[1812.00 - 1816.08] fish oil out and do probiotics it's all
[1814.32 - 1816.72] in your gut like all the stupid stuff
[1816.08 - 1818.96] non-stop
[1816.72 - 1820.56] meanwhile it's candida or something
[1818.96 - 1821.68] meanwhile you're suffering and there's
[1820.56 - 1823.20] real issues so
[1821.68 - 1825.20] come down the involuntary movements
[1823.20 - 1825.76] vibrations hair loss tingling hands and
[1825.20 - 1828.40] feet
[1825.76 - 1829.28] neurologists said anxiety that right
[1828.40 - 1831.60] there
[1829.28 - 1833.68] is tough for me tough tough tough to
[1831.60 - 1836.96] hear that to hear that because
[1833.68 - 1840.64] i heard that for over 35 years
[1836.96 - 1842.56] from patients right that you know where
[1840.64 - 1843.84] the doctor will send somebody to try to
[1842.56 - 1845.36] find me for help
[1843.84 - 1846.32] that somebody you know that somebody
[1845.36 - 1847.76] would tell me all the different
[1846.32 - 1849.60] neurologists they've been to and how
[1847.76 - 1852.56] certain neurologists would be like
[1849.60 - 1853.60] it's anxiety it's all in your head
[1852.56 - 1855.20] you're making it up
[1853.60 - 1856.88] you know what the new thing is right now
[1855.20 - 1859.84] rebecca is that
[1856.88 - 1860.48] what you know young women are being told
[1859.84 - 1862.40] now
[1860.48 - 1864.08] is that they're creating it with their
[1862.40 - 1866.56] thoughts you know and they're not
[1864.08 - 1868.00] good enough they're creating it they're
[1866.56 - 1869.44] not thinking positive and that's why
[1868.00 - 1870.80] they have tingles and numbness and
[1869.44 - 1872.48] that's why they have all these symptoms
[1870.80 - 1874.48] of vibrations it's so sad what's
[1872.48 - 1876.48] happening that's the new crazy
[1874.48 - 1877.76] you just you tell young women that
[1876.48 - 1878.40] they're just creating it with their
[1877.76 - 1879.60] thoughts
[1878.40 - 1881.04] and they're they're with their they're
[1879.60 - 1882.64] not positive thoughts and they need to
[1881.04 - 1883.84] better themselves that's a new way of
[1882.64 - 1885.76] saying it's all in your head and you're
[1883.84 - 1886.88] crazy to a new generation it's just it's
[1885.76 - 1890.72] actually sick
[1886.88 - 1892.40] um and but yeah so just know that
[1890.72 - 1893.84] i feel for you so what i would do
[1892.40 - 1895.52] there's a neurological section here
[1893.84 - 1897.84] you'll see with body vibration
[1895.52 - 1898.88] with body vibrations you'll hear tingles
[1897.84 - 1901.12] hands and feet
[1898.88 - 1902.64] so what i would do is get the book out
[1901.12 - 1905.20] library for free if you want
[1902.64 - 1906.72] and take a look at the different the
[1905.20 - 1908.80] your symptoms and line them up to
[1906.72 - 1910.00] symptoms inside the back of the book and
[1908.80 - 1911.60] if you're new here and you're wondering
[1910.00 - 1912.88] what is he even talking about well in
[1911.60 - 1915.36] the back of the book
[1912.88 - 1916.48] you'll see look i just opened it to just
[1915.36 - 1921.12] whatever and it says
[1916.48 - 1922.64] glaucoma gout um guilt and sadness hair
[1921.12 - 1924.16] thinning and loss i actually just opened
[1922.64 - 1926.32] it up to hair thinning and loss and it
[1924.16 - 1929.12] tells you what's causing that
[1926.32 - 1930.64] and i just turn the page fibromyalgia
[1929.12 - 1932.64] and so forth and it keeps them going but
[1930.64 - 1935.28] there's neurological
[1932.64 - 1936.72] section in here so and you can learn
[1935.28 - 1938.64] what's causing it so you can get a
[1936.72 - 1943.12] chance to get better and all that
[1938.64 - 1943.12] and it's just not easy okay so
[1944.72 - 1949.04] so angela you're doing lemon water proud
[1947.36 - 1951.44] of you incredible
[1949.04 - 1953.84] celery juice per your instructions still
[1951.44 - 1956.40] seem to be having some congestion
[1953.84 - 1958.64] breathing issues asthmatic like symptoms
[1956.40 - 1961.12] and coughing mucous inflammation doctors
[1958.64 - 1964.40] can't find anything any suggestions
[1961.12 - 1965.68] angela um what are you what are you
[1964.40 - 1967.36] eating that's one thing
[1965.68 - 1969.60] think about that i ask everybody this so
[1967.36 - 1971.44] i'm asking everybody this right now okay
[1969.60 - 1972.80] you got some symptoms going on you're
[1971.44 - 1974.16] doing some good stuff though
[1972.80 - 1975.68] so you're doing the lemon water you're
[1974.16 - 1976.40] doing the celery juice that's a part of
[1975.68 - 1979.20] it there
[1976.40 - 1980.64] are you eating any eggs um because
[1979.20 - 1983.04] that's not that's gonna
[1980.64 - 1984.08] are you doing one one or two eggs a
[1983.04 - 1987.36] month
[1984.08 - 1988.48] will keep those symptoms there is what
[1987.36 - 1989.92] they'll do because
[1988.48 - 1991.44] because with the doctor so no these are
[1989.92 - 1993.04] pathogens because they talk to doctors
[1991.44 - 1994.88] all the time and i teach doctors about
[1993.04 - 1995.68] this what your very question have been
[1994.88 - 1998.08] asked
[1995.68 - 1999.04] i have to talk to about five ten doctors
[1998.08 - 2001.36] every single day
[1999.04 - 2002.16] so every morning so i have a like that's
[2001.36 - 2004.32] what i do
[2002.16 - 2006.32] and it's to teach them so they can help
[2004.32 - 2008.16] heal more patients and more patients and
[2006.32 - 2009.52] and you know many of them don't set it
[2008.16 - 2010.96] back to the medical medium information
[2009.52 - 2012.88] it just spreads out and spreads out so
[2010.96 - 2013.60] then when i say metal somebody says oh
[2012.88 - 2015.12] he didn't
[2013.60 - 2017.20] he didn't start out the metal talk
[2015.12 - 2019.92] metals are around you know it's crazy
[2017.20 - 2020.72] so but the bottom line is um with what
[2019.92 - 2022.80] you're dealing with
[2020.72 - 2024.48] are you doing eggs are you doing butter
[2022.80 - 2026.32] are you doing dairy products
[2024.48 - 2028.32] is gluten in there once in a while these
[2026.32 - 2030.24] will all feed pathogens to keep these
[2028.32 - 2032.56] symptoms there
[2030.24 - 2034.24] and so keep that in mind there are you
[2032.56 - 2035.68] doing nutritional yeast are you doing
[2034.24 - 2039.04] natural flavors are you doing
[2035.68 - 2041.28] corn are you doing soy those will
[2039.04 - 2042.96] make or break when you're in this
[2041.28 - 2044.40] condition where you're dealing with all
[2042.96 - 2047.12] this stuff going on
[2044.40 - 2049.20] those will make our break so how clean
[2047.12 - 2050.24] is it are you plant based have you done
[2049.20 - 2053.36] the 369
[2050.24 - 2055.20] cleanse yet the 369 advanced cleanse
[2053.36 - 2057.20] so how far have you gone have you done
[2055.20 - 2058.64] the mono eating cleanse
[2057.20 - 2060.00] you talk to your doctor and say look i
[2058.64 - 2060.80] want to do mono-eating cleanse but your
[2060.00 - 2062.24] doctor doesn't know
[2060.80 - 2063.84] they can't find anything but you can
[2062.24 - 2064.80] still talk to them about doing any of
[2063.84 - 2066.88] this and
[2064.80 - 2069.60] mono-eating cleanse and then see where
[2066.88 - 2071.52] that goes after a while you know
[2069.60 - 2073.04] you don't have to be plant-based you can
[2071.52 - 2075.84] be doing animal products
[2073.04 - 2077.36] but but try not to do certain ones like
[2075.84 - 2080.48] eggs and dairy products
[2077.36 - 2081.44] but there is a way out there is a way
[2080.48 - 2084.00] out and
[2081.44 - 2085.60] so you've got to customize the protocol
[2084.00 - 2087.12] try to get some guidance if you can
[2085.60 - 2089.52] from a practitioner of course if you
[2087.12 - 2091.28] want or do it on your own but i
[2089.52 - 2095.92] completely understand
[2091.28 - 2095.92] what you're going through so
[2096.96 - 2103.76] guinea hernia please discuss protocols
[2100.32 - 2107.52] sand chad one one protocol
[2103.76 - 2109.84] don't overeat don't overeat small meals
[2107.52 - 2111.04] small meals every two hours i get asked
[2109.84 - 2114.08] this all the time
[2111.04 - 2114.72] all the time um doctors ask this all the
[2114.08 - 2116.32] time
[2114.72 - 2117.76] and i'm saying that a lot because
[2116.32 - 2120.00] basically
[2117.76 - 2121.28] people say well be transparent anthony
[2120.00 - 2123.20] what do you do in a day
[2121.28 - 2125.20] you want to know what my day is my day
[2123.20 - 2126.72] stinks
[2125.20 - 2129.44] so my day is waking up really early in
[2126.72 - 2131.92] the morning hearing spirit of compassion
[2129.44 - 2133.52] writing down information from for the
[2131.92 - 2134.80] next book so i can work on getting
[2133.52 - 2137.04] people better
[2134.80 - 2138.24] and then i gotta go okay who's lined up
[2137.04 - 2139.28] all the doctors that need to talk to me
[2138.24 - 2140.00] and ask questions because they're
[2139.28 - 2141.68] they're they're
[2140.00 - 2143.52] trying to contact me that's a part of
[2141.68 - 2145.36] the day it's exhausting
[2143.52 - 2146.64] and then and then the next part of the
[2145.36 - 2148.80] day is just
[2146.64 - 2149.92] all the other projects and things to do
[2148.80 - 2151.60] and it's it's just
[2149.92 - 2153.28] it's just and how to get disseminate
[2151.60 - 2153.60] free information out constantly it's
[2153.28 - 2156.16] just
[2153.60 - 2157.12] it's just endless but um first of all
[2156.16 - 2160.08] with the hernias
[2157.12 - 2160.64] don't overeat small meals that that's
[2160.08 - 2163.44] critical
[2160.64 - 2164.88] small meals and um and be cautious
[2163.44 - 2167.44] you're not eating foods
[2164.88 - 2168.24] that will bloat you up because you don't
[2167.44 - 2171.28] want that
[2168.24 - 2173.52] one like moment where you get
[2171.28 - 2174.96] extra bloated and you pop the cork and
[2173.52 - 2176.72] now you're getting surgery
[2174.96 - 2178.32] emergent emergency surgery or something
[2176.72 - 2180.00] like that you know and i always tell
[2178.32 - 2181.84] tell you that i got a friend who's got a
[2180.00 - 2183.68] hernia and it's like
[2181.84 - 2186.32] any guinea hernia and i'm just like look
[2183.68 - 2189.04] just of course don't lift anything heavy
[2186.32 - 2190.96] but if you're bloated or you're stuffed
[2189.04 - 2192.80] that's when it could go wrong you know
[2190.96 - 2194.16] when you're really stuffed so you just
[2192.80 - 2195.28] want to you know you want to eat light
[2194.16 - 2197.52] but consistently
[2195.28 - 2198.88] so it's not like all in one moment
[2197.52 - 2202.16] that's just one thing i can
[2198.88 - 2202.16] give you anyway that's helpful
[2202.80 - 2209.28] candida so alan so candida
[2206.08 - 2212.48] okay well candida was a bad idea
[2209.28 - 2215.68] and a bad theory back in the 80s and 90s
[2212.48 - 2217.68] and it led
[2215.68 - 2219.60] thousands and thousands of people astray
[2217.68 - 2222.48] into never never land of
[2219.60 - 2224.16] never getting better so if we're still
[2222.48 - 2228.56] playing around in candida land
[2224.16 - 2231.92] it's amazing how these dead theories
[2228.56 - 2234.00] are just they just recirculate and they
[2231.92 - 2235.28] they're still out there it's beyond me
[2234.00 - 2236.64] that they're still out there because
[2235.28 - 2237.76] candida is not the problem of why
[2236.64 - 2240.64] somebody's sick
[2237.76 - 2242.08] and so when when you still see that out
[2240.64 - 2245.36] there candida cleanses i'm like
[2242.08 - 2248.16] dear god dear god i mean it's the land
[2245.36 - 2249.12] of just stupidness out there it's it's
[2248.16 - 2251.28] amazing not you
[2249.12 - 2252.24] but the information and all the the you
[2251.28 - 2253.52] know going out there all the
[2252.24 - 2255.28] misinformation
[2253.52 - 2256.64] and so it's easy to get trapped in it
[2255.28 - 2258.64] it's easy to get trapped into the
[2256.64 - 2259.36] candida thought and candida what they
[2258.64 - 2260.80] did was
[2259.36 - 2263.20] no one got better with the candida
[2260.80 - 2264.40] thought so now they call it microbiome
[2263.20 - 2266.16] and they're going to call it sibo like
[2264.40 - 2267.60] they call sibo and then microbiome and
[2266.16 - 2269.84] it's like okay and then
[2267.60 - 2271.52] you know and that's but that's not why
[2269.84 - 2273.44] people are sick it's really sad
[2271.52 - 2275.04] and but what they will offer is they'll
[2273.44 - 2276.88] say stay off of gluten stay off of this
[2275.04 - 2277.68] they'll stay off of medical medium no
[2276.88 - 2279.44] foods
[2277.68 - 2281.20] that i've been teaching about for 35
[2279.44 - 2282.80] years they'll say stay off of this stay
[2281.20 - 2284.16] off of the stay off of this
[2282.80 - 2286.80] and then the person's getting a little
[2284.16 - 2288.40] better and then they think hey that's my
[2286.80 - 2289.84] candida is getting better my
[2288.40 - 2291.52] my microbiome is getting better and
[2289.84 - 2293.28] that's not how it works it's just that
[2291.52 - 2294.16] when you're staying off those no foods
[2293.28 - 2296.64] by default
[2294.16 - 2298.00] you're not feeding streptococcus that's
[2296.64 - 2300.64] creating your intestinal
[2298.00 - 2302.32] tract problem so they don't know it but
[2300.64 - 2302.88] you're starving your streptococcus so
[2302.32 - 2304.88] it's just
[2302.88 - 2306.08] it it's incredible how it works out
[2304.88 - 2307.76] there but um
[2306.08 - 2309.20] just really i mean if you're into
[2307.76 - 2311.04] candida you're into anything you just
[2309.20 - 2313.68] got to read clensic your mind will be
[2311.04 - 2315.52] blown you go to amazon it's 51
[2313.68 - 2316.72] off 16.99 if you want go to the library
[2315.52 - 2319.20] get it for free
[2316.72 - 2320.72] but it's yeah your mind will be blown
[2319.20 - 2321.60] when you actually read this this is the
[2320.72 - 2324.84] most advanced
[2321.60 - 2327.84] gut book there is to date hands down out
[2324.84 - 2327.84] there

[2338.32 - 2342.00] well you know what what happens with
[2339.76 - 2343.20] anemia is iron feeds the epstein-barr
[2342.00 - 2344.72] virus so
[2343.20 - 2346.40] and this is something i've talked about
[2344.72 - 2348.00] forever i talked about this in books
[2346.40 - 2350.40] i've talked about this in other
[2348.00 - 2352.88] other places and i've lectured about it
[2350.40 - 2356.08] in many places and have lectured that
[2352.88 - 2359.52] that with anemia that's what happens is
[2356.08 - 2362.16] iron feeds pathogens if you have
[2359.52 - 2364.16] pathogens so once again it's like wait a
[2362.16 - 2366.08] minute here you know like what can i do

[2373.76 - 2377.44] okay melissa high blood sugar not
[2376.24 - 2379.60] genetic
[2377.44 - 2380.96] high blood sugar is not genetic that's
[2379.60 - 2382.24] an example of
[2380.96 - 2384.72] they don't know why someone has a
[2382.24 - 2386.88] problem so research in science will
[2384.72 - 2388.56] peg everything genetic it's body shaming
[2386.88 - 2390.32] it's like your genes are bad so
[2388.56 - 2391.68] you got crappy genes how about that
[2390.32 - 2392.40] that's what they that's what they want
[2391.68 - 2394.24] you to think
[2392.40 - 2395.76] i mean think about that isn't that sick
[2394.24 - 2397.44] it's like you
[2395.76 - 2398.96] this is what they do if you get sick
[2397.44 - 2400.08] they say your body's attacking itself
[2398.96 - 2402.64] you have autoimmune
[2400.08 - 2404.48] okay now i'm not saying people don't
[2402.64 - 2406.80] have symptoms and they're not suffering
[2404.48 - 2409.12] but autoimmune theory is actually
[2406.80 - 2410.96] a botched job total body shop it's not
[2409.12 - 2412.40] even real their theory about the body
[2410.96 - 2413.36] attacking itself because it doesn't so
[2412.40 - 2415.68] they'll just say
[2413.36 - 2416.48] your body's attacking itself body
[2415.68 - 2418.24] shaming
[2416.48 - 2420.08] they'll make you feel like crap that
[2418.24 - 2422.24] your body's bad and it's attacking
[2420.08 - 2423.28] itself they'll say it's genetic
[2422.24 - 2425.36] right they'll say your condition's
[2423.28 - 2426.72] genetic make body shaming again make you
[2425.36 - 2428.40] feel like
[2426.72 - 2430.48] a piece of crap because that's what they
[2428.40 - 2431.52] want you to feel like not the doctors
[2430.48 - 2433.28] but the industry
[2431.52 - 2435.28] and then they'll say you they'll also
[2433.28 - 2436.88] say um it's your hormones
[2435.28 - 2438.64] come on i mean you know what i mean like
[2436.88 - 2440.08] unbelievable it's your hormones
[2438.64 - 2441.92] that's what they'll say they'll pull
[2440.08 - 2442.24] that card because it's blaming the woman
[2441.92 - 2443.84] now
[2442.24 - 2445.52] she has bad hormones or she's just i
[2443.84 - 2447.12] mean they're they're great hormone
[2445.52 - 2448.08] doctors don't get me wrong incredible
[2447.12 - 2450.88] ones that actually
[2448.08 - 2451.28] naturally work with hormones to to to
[2450.88 - 2453.20] help
[2451.28 - 2454.64] actually band-aid everything but the
[2453.20 - 2455.76] point is the industry loves to think
[2454.64 - 2456.96] it's all hormones
[2455.76 - 2458.08] then the industry loves to think it's
[2456.96 - 2460.16] all in your head so they just want to
[2458.08 - 2461.92] body shame body shame body shame but not
[2460.16 - 2464.64] give you answers and diabetes
[2461.92 - 2465.44] is not um genetic it's not that's not
[2464.64 - 2467.20] genetic
[2465.44 - 2469.28] you know um blood sugar problems high
[2467.20 - 2471.12] a1c not genetic and all that
[2469.28 - 2472.72] but you got to get your liver in a
[2471.12 - 2474.56] better place
[2472.72 - 2476.16] you got to drop the fats in the diet
[2474.56 - 2477.20] down got to learn how to maybe eat a
[2476.16 - 2479.20] little differently
[2477.20 - 2482.32] and then you'll see all that stabilize
[2479.20 - 2482.32] you'll see it stabilized
[2484.08 - 2487.68] floaters just so you know i got a whole
[2485.92 - 2489.68] floaters thing in the back here there's
[2487.68 - 2490.88] there's floaters in cleanse the heel
[2489.68 - 2493.20] what to do all
[2490.88 - 2494.00] the different stuff what's the cause
[2493.20 - 2496.56] what i don't
[2494.00 - 2498.16] what i don't like out there okay there's
[2496.56 - 2500.24] all this advice out there
[2498.16 - 2501.20] all of it in the health scene okay and
[2500.24 - 2502.56] it's interesting
[2501.20 - 2505.44] but yet nobody knows what causes
[2502.56 - 2507.52] anything so why is
[2505.44 - 2508.96] why is someone really an expert when
[2507.52 - 2510.16] they don't know the true cause of why
[2508.96 - 2511.60] you're sick
[2510.16 - 2513.84] if they don't know the true cause of why
[2511.60 - 2516.00] you have floaters why are they an expert
[2513.84 - 2517.20] oh here's apple cider vinegar here's
[2516.00 - 2519.20] activated charcoal
[2517.20 - 2520.24] here's corella here's fish oil here's
[2519.20 - 2522.80] probiotic
[2520.24 - 2524.88] here's whatever here's collagen i mean
[2522.80 - 2525.36] it's it's insane really here's bentonite
[2524.88 - 2528.08] clay
[2525.36 - 2529.36] all that stuff's bad but the bottom line
[2528.08 - 2531.52] is it's it's
[2529.36 - 2532.80] it's really amazing you know oh here's
[2531.52 - 2535.04] food combining but yet you don't know
[2532.80 - 2536.96] why somebody's sick
[2535.04 - 2538.96] not like you know ranking on everything
[2536.96 - 2540.96] totally i'm just saying that
[2538.96 - 2542.64] it everybody's a health expert is that
[2540.96 - 2543.68] what it is now when nobody knows why
[2542.64 - 2545.36] anybody's sick
[2543.68 - 2546.72] no one knows why you have tinnitus
[2545.36 - 2547.60] ringing in the air nobody knows why you
[2546.72 - 2548.88] have vertigo or
[2547.60 - 2550.24] clothes in the eyes the tickles and
[2548.88 - 2551.60] numbness and that's the difference
[2550.24 - 2553.12] between medical medium information
[2551.60 - 2555.60] whether anybody likes it or not it's
[2553.12 - 2558.56] just the truth
[2555.60 - 2560.56] it's tammy white i have heard you say at
[2558.56 - 2562.64] one time or in your books
[2560.56 - 2565.04] that some people who do celery juice
[2562.64 - 2567.12] might get diarrhea
[2565.04 - 2569.20] i get it so bad and this is all i can
[2567.12 - 2571.04] figure out that might be causing all the
[2569.20 - 2573.84] intestinal distress
[2571.04 - 2575.44] um options that will do similar to
[2573.84 - 2576.00] celery juice first of all so you never
[2575.44 - 2577.68] had
[2576.00 - 2579.44] tim you never had intestinal distress
[2577.68 - 2580.40] before and you never had diarrhea at all
[2579.44 - 2583.36] before
[2580.40 - 2584.16] um or is this like your intestinal tract
[2583.36 - 2586.56] and gut problems
[2584.16 - 2588.16] all perfect like your gut's great you
[2586.56 - 2590.72] had nothing wrong with your gut
[2588.16 - 2592.08] everything's stable with it no bloating
[2590.72 - 2593.36] no anything and then you did celery
[2592.08 - 2593.92] juice and then you have the diarrhea i'm
[2593.36 - 2595.44] just
[2593.92 - 2598.00] just asking questions so you can think
[2595.44 - 2600.64] about it and the other thing is
[2598.00 - 2602.32] do small amount do a really small amount
[2600.64 - 2603.84] so what i would recommend
[2602.32 - 2605.28] because what happens is if you're
[2603.84 - 2606.40] getting diarrhea first of all i'm really
[2605.28 - 2606.96] glad that you got the books and you're
[2606.40 - 2608.16] reading them
[2606.96 - 2610.00] when you're when you're getting the
[2608.16 - 2611.28] diarrhea from celery juice lower the
[2610.00 - 2611.68] amount of celery juice because that
[2611.28 - 2614.16] means
[2611.68 - 2616.16] that celery juice is killing something
[2614.16 - 2617.92] so it's it's killing something it's
[2616.16 - 2619.28] killing a die off so what happens is
[2617.92 - 2621.28] what everybody walks around with they
[2619.28 - 2623.04] walk around chances are if you're
[2621.28 - 2624.40] taking care of yourself and you're
[2623.04 - 2626.00] getting these books that means you do
[2624.40 - 2627.52] have something going on in your body
[2626.00 - 2628.88] that you're concerned about you're not
[2627.52 - 2631.44] just feeling perfect and then you
[2628.88 - 2632.80] decided to do medical medium information
[2631.44 - 2634.24] most everybody does medical mean
[2632.80 - 2635.60] information they get sick so they need
[2634.24 - 2636.96] to do mental health information so
[2635.60 - 2639.84] what's happening is
[2636.96 - 2641.44] is realize that is that you got
[2639.84 - 2642.16] something that the celery juice is
[2641.44 - 2645.28] actually
[2642.16 - 2648.72] destroying pathogens and when one
[2645.28 - 2651.68] little bug dies like one little bug
[2648.72 - 2652.72] dies we can have a reaction to that bug
[2651.68 - 2655.44] dying
[2652.72 - 2657.12] so when you kill off one little tiny bug
[2655.44 - 2658.48] kill off a little bit of streptococcus a
[2657.12 - 2660.32] little bit of staph
[2658.48 - 2661.60] a little bit of c-diff you kill a little
[2660.32 - 2663.52] bit of you know all this
[2661.60 - 2665.04] and then that's that's something right
[2663.52 - 2667.04] there you kill a little bit of
[2665.04 - 2668.72] um shingles a little bit of epstein bar
[2667.04 - 2671.12] but bacteria especially any of it when
[2668.72 - 2672.88] that celery juice is going through
[2671.12 - 2674.24] your intestinal tract it's it's a
[2672.88 - 2675.76] cleanser it
[2674.24 - 2677.04] people underestimate the amount of power
[2675.76 - 2678.48] it has it's different than a celery
[2677.04 - 2680.80] stick a celery stick
[2678.48 - 2682.16] that's not going to do anything but when
[2680.80 - 2684.08] you do the celery juice so what i would
[2682.16 - 2686.48] recommend is
[2684.08 - 2688.72] first of all are you don't do any eggs
[2686.48 - 2690.88] don't do any dairy don't do any gluten
[2688.72 - 2691.68] no corn no soy make sure that stuff's
[2690.88 - 2694.16] out
[2691.68 - 2695.36] and be cautious with all that stuff do
[2694.16 - 2697.60] small amounts
[2695.36 - 2698.64] of celery juice if you want to try that
[2697.60 - 2700.40] that's what i would recommend to
[2698.64 - 2702.24] somebody asking me this if this was me
[2700.40 - 2704.08] happening i'd be like okay four ounces
[2702.24 - 2706.40] so i'd be like well what's this is this
[2704.08 - 2709.92] four ounce six ounces what is this so
[2706.40 - 2712.00] i would do a small amount each day
[2709.92 - 2713.36] and see where that line is drawn because
[2712.00 - 2713.84] it's going to go in there it's going to
[2713.36 - 2715.76] start
[2713.84 - 2718.08] breaking down pathogens killing off
[2715.76 - 2721.68] bacteria and all that is what it's going
[2718.08 - 2721.68] to start to do so that's what i would do
[2723.36 - 2730.48] so um
[2727.28 - 2731.68] yeah anyway so but i'm proud of you for
[2730.48 - 2733.44] even drinking it
[2731.68 - 2735.52] start really little if you need to
[2733.44 - 2738.88] graduate go right to
[2735.52 - 2742.16] um you know i don't recommend
[2738.88 - 2743.28] ever having something mixed with your
[2742.16 - 2745.20] celery juice okay
[2743.28 - 2746.40] but if you really have to i mean i have
[2745.20 - 2747.36] mentioned if you really have to
[2746.40 - 2749.12] acclimate
[2747.36 - 2750.80] do some apple in there do a little bit
[2749.12 - 2752.32] of apple a little bit of celery juice
[2750.80 - 2754.48] and see if you still get the same thing
[2752.32 - 2756.08] and you just work your way up back to
[2754.48 - 2761.12] where your straight celery again or just
[2756.08 - 2764.24] a little bit of celery
[2761.12 - 2766.00] so there's a couple questions um
[2764.24 - 2768.00] i'm looking at my monitors for questions
[2766.00 - 2770.00] you guys so erica
[2768.00 - 2771.04] i bought cleanse the heel and reading it
[2770.00 - 2773.92] now
[2771.04 - 2777.28] amazing incredible i can't really find
[2773.92 - 2780.56] any info on balancing hormones
[2777.28 - 2782.40] i'm i am going through early menopause
[2780.56 - 2785.12] and all the doctors keep telling me to
[2782.40 - 2788.00] do keto can you give me any advice
[2785.12 - 2789.84] so if you go into the protocols you'll
[2788.00 - 2793.28] see in the back of the book
[2789.84 - 2793.28] menopause symptoms
[2793.36 - 2803.84] and i'm just looking hormonal hormonal
[2796.00 - 2803.84] problems and i'm just looking for it now
[2806.56 - 2810.00] so they're both in this same section but
[2808.48 - 2810.56] i'm just trying to find it as we speak
[2810.00 - 2813.76] because
[2810.56 - 2815.52] i'm wondering if i wonder why that's not
[2813.76 - 2817.60] there for you
[2815.52 - 2818.96] so i have two things going on here so i
[2817.60 - 2821.28] want to show you one
[2818.96 - 2821.28] here
[2823.76 - 2827.60] so you'll see hormonal problems right
[2825.36 - 2827.60] there
[2828.08 - 2831.84] and then
[2835.44 - 2840.16] sorry about it's taking so long isn't
[2837.52 - 2840.16] then you'll see
[2841.12 - 2845.59] and then you'll see menopause symptoms
[2844.40 - 2847.28] right there
[2845.59 - 2849.36] [Music]
[2847.28 - 2850.88] but um so we can do is you can talk to
[2849.36 - 2852.00] your practitioner doctor you can take
[2850.88 - 2854.72] this to them
[2852.00 - 2856.56] and you can look you can you can but if
[2854.72 - 2857.76] you read the whole chapter
[2856.56 - 2860.32] you can learn how to take the
[2857.76 - 2862.64] supplements as far as how to do it
[2860.32 - 2864.48] but learning the true cause is the key
[2862.64 - 2866.40] so when you see this
[2864.48 - 2867.76] you'll see menopause symptoms but you'll
[2866.40 - 2868.96] you'll read it you'll learn what the
[2867.76 - 2871.20] true cause because
[2868.96 - 2872.00] menopause is supposed to be like it used
[2871.20 - 2875.28] to be
[2872.00 - 2877.84] before the 1940s which was women
[2875.28 - 2879.12] just their period stopped and they felt
[2877.84 - 2881.28] better than ever
[2879.12 - 2882.88] that's what menopause used to be so that
[2881.28 - 2885.52] was the change back then
[2882.88 - 2886.32] it was called the change you just felt
[2885.52 - 2889.20] better
[2886.32 - 2891.04] so but then because of pathogens and
[2889.20 - 2893.76] viruses like epstein-barr
[2891.04 - 2894.40] stagnant livers causing hot flashes and
[2893.76 - 2896.72] all this
[2894.40 - 2898.08] we've gotten to the age of menopause
[2896.72 - 2900.48] symptoms
[2898.08 - 2901.92] and it's being blamed on menopause but
[2900.48 - 2903.12] menopause isn't why
[2901.92 - 2904.96] you have the symptoms you have to
[2903.12 - 2906.16] realize wait a minute what's going on
[2904.96 - 2907.68] here so you'll look at all the different
[2906.16 - 2908.64] supplement protocols you'll see what
[2907.68 - 2909.92] angle to take
[2908.64 - 2911.60] you can talk to your practitioner about
[2909.92 - 2913.20] it if you wanted to too that's what i
[2911.60 - 2915.76] would do if i was going through it
[2913.20 - 2917.68] um keto keto will make it worse so keto
[2915.76 - 2920.96] makes menopause symptoms worse
[2917.68 - 2922.88] because because the keto is high fat
[2920.96 - 2925.60] so what you'll find is the higher fat
[2922.88 - 2927.36] you go because that's part of how the
[2925.60 - 2929.04] the menopause symptoms are even here
[2927.36 - 2930.48] it's because your whole diet your diet
[2929.04 - 2932.40] throughout your life was probably just
[2930.48 - 2934.16] high in fat because everybody says it's
[2932.40 - 2937.92] just everybody says
[2934.16 - 2941.12] whether it's milk cheese butter eggs
[2937.92 - 2943.52] meat chicken avocado nut butters
[2941.12 - 2945.12] oils olive oil whatever you know
[2943.52 - 2945.44] whatever it is coconut oil whatever it
[2945.12 - 2947.52] is
[2945.44 - 2949.60] peanut butter all of that is high fat
[2947.52 - 2952.48] and we we tuna fish
[2949.60 - 2954.40] tuna fish salmon whatever right we tend
[2952.48 - 2956.00] to be all high fat and that's what we do
[2954.40 - 2958.32] so keto is just
[2956.00 - 2959.92] yeah you're removing gluten but you
[2958.32 - 2962.40] should be removing that anyway
[2959.92 - 2962.96] so what i would do is is anybody dealing
[2962.40 - 2964.96] with like
[2962.96 - 2966.48] the hormonal issues menopause symptoms
[2964.96 - 2968.16] try something like
[2966.48 - 2970.00] try just the mono eating cleanse for a
[2968.16 - 2971.28] little bit or try maybe the anti-bug
[2970.00 - 2974.80] cleanse or
[2971.28 - 2976.16] do 369 original the original 369 cleanse
[2974.80 - 2977.12] if you want or advanced and you'll
[2976.16 - 2978.64] notice that
[2977.12 - 2979.84] as you're doing that and then you look
[2978.64 - 2981.28] at some of the supplementation and
[2979.84 - 2982.24] menopause symptoms and hormonal
[2981.28 - 2983.84] imbalances
[2982.24 - 2985.44] you'll notice once you bring some of the
[2983.84 - 2987.84] subs in the supplements in
[2985.44 - 2988.64] with doing the foods and not having to
[2987.84 - 2990.08] do keto
[2988.64 - 2991.92] you'll notice some of these menopause
[2990.08 - 2993.28] symptoms going away
[2991.92 - 2995.76] and you'll be like oh my god why are
[2993.28 - 2998.24] they going away because it
[2995.76 - 2999.20] menopause is different than the symptoms
[2998.24 - 3001.20] menopause is
[2999.20 - 3002.64] the change of life the period stops
[3001.20 - 3003.84] you're getting older that kind of thing
[3002.64 - 3004.80] it's normal you're really getting
[3003.84 - 3006.40] younger and
[3004.80 - 3008.72] your period stops and then what happens
[3006.40 - 3010.72] is you're not supposed to have symptoms
[3008.72 - 3012.24] if you have symptoms that's other things
[3010.72 - 3014.40] really being the problem
[3012.24 - 3016.00] and that's advanced information and
[3014.40 - 3018.32] teaching a lot of doctors that now a lot
[3016.00 - 3020.08] of hormone doctors that too
[3018.32 - 3022.72] reggie says anthony what's the problem
[3020.08 - 3026.00] with ionized water
[3022.72 - 3028.40] i've had a machine for years the problem
[3026.00 - 3029.04] is reggie that um there's a bunch of
[3028.40 - 3031.12] problems
[3029.04 - 3032.80] a bunch of them one is the filters on
[3031.12 - 3034.48] them are terrible so you're just getting
[3032.80 - 3035.92] sink water and so
[3034.48 - 3037.44] and you're getting you can get toxic
[3035.92 - 3038.88] heavy metals from your sink water you
[3037.44 - 3040.40] can get other things that it won't it's
[3038.88 - 3043.36] not a purifier
[3040.40 - 3045.28] so the alkaline ionizer water machines
[3043.36 - 3046.72] aren't pure fire so i recommend a
[3045.28 - 3048.72] purifier so you're not
[3046.72 - 3050.40] drinking water that has stuff in it that
[3048.72 - 3052.56] shouldn't be in there so that's one
[3050.40 - 3054.08] and i know the ionizer sales people the
[3052.56 - 3055.44] pyramid scheme and all that that's
[3054.08 - 3057.60] happening they'll just tell you that
[3055.44 - 3060.00] yeah it's clean water it's clean water
[3057.60 - 3061.92] it's just not true um and you can even
[3060.00 - 3063.76] look into it it's not true but
[3061.92 - 3064.96] the thing is the other problem is it's
[3063.76 - 3066.72] ionized so
[3064.96 - 3068.48] what happens is their metal plates are
[3066.72 - 3070.24] in the machine and those metal plates
[3068.48 - 3072.88] they get corroded over the years
[3070.24 - 3075.04] so if i took apart your ionizer i would
[3072.88 - 3077.04] find these two corroded plates and where
[3075.04 - 3080.24] did all those metal particles
[3077.04 - 3081.92] go and off those titanium plates and you
[3080.24 - 3083.68] know platinum titanium whatever you
[3081.92 - 3085.68] where did all the metal go they turn
[3083.68 - 3086.96] they turn black they get all pitted and
[3085.68 - 3090.32] decayed
[3086.96 - 3091.12] and and um and so that has to go
[3090.32 - 3094.40] somewhere
[3091.12 - 3095.52] and it it goes in us so what i would do
[3094.40 - 3097.60] is i would
[3095.52 - 3099.44] i would you know consider like you know
[3097.60 - 3101.04] the heavy metal detox cleanse may be
[3099.44 - 3102.40] bringing into your life pulling out some
[3101.04 - 3104.56] metals that might have been in there
[3102.40 - 3105.84] the other thing is charge so you got the
[3104.56 - 3107.12] metal plates in the machine
[3105.84 - 3108.88] and then there's electricity going to
[3107.12 - 3110.80] the metal plates and it's
[3108.88 - 3111.92] it's it's charging it's changing those
[3110.80 - 3114.24] structure of the water
[3111.92 - 3115.92] through experimentation it's like and so
[3114.24 - 3118.00] that ionization
[3115.92 - 3119.28] is means it changes the water it kills
[3118.00 - 3122.24] the water so
[3119.28 - 3122.80] you know and i get it i mean we get sold
[3122.24 - 3124.96] these
[3122.80 - 3126.64] and but we never get taught taught
[3124.96 - 3128.00] what's happening or how it works or
[3126.64 - 3131.36] what's going on
[3128.00 - 3133.20] so and there's actual research on this
[3131.36 - 3135.68] there's actual this isn't just me
[3133.20 - 3137.12] i mean there's actual research and now
[3135.68 - 3139.60] science
[3137.12 - 3140.40] looking into this and figuring it out
[3139.60 - 3143.36] and there's
[3140.40 - 3143.84] researchers out there there's a there's
[3143.36 - 3145.28] a lot of
[3143.84 - 3146.88] water researchers out there that
[3145.28 - 3148.64] actually check the wall they test the
[3146.88 - 3149.84] water what happens when you ionize it
[3148.64 - 3151.92] how the water dies
[3149.84 - 3153.76] versus water that wasn't and then it's
[3151.92 - 3154.96] also like i said you got those plates
[3153.76 - 3156.40] and those metal plates
[3154.96 - 3158.16] are conduct you know electricity going
[3156.40 - 3158.96] to the metal plates look i know it gets
[3158.16 - 3160.64] people upset
[3158.96 - 3162.96] i hope you're not upset i'm just looking
[3160.64 - 3164.64] out for people i you know i would get a
[3162.96 - 3166.32] water purifier
[3164.64 - 3167.84] any other water options are better than
[3166.32 - 3170.40] that i'm just you know
[3167.84 - 3172.08] but um but i mean i hope this helps i'm
[3170.40 - 3172.40] just looking out for everybody you know
[3172.08 - 3173.84] it's
[3172.40 - 3176.64] it's the whole point is i have to have

[3238.16 - 3240.88] course it is it's so gentle it doesn't
[3239.84 - 3244.88] do anything
[3240.88 - 3244.88] wrong it just only does the right things
[3245.20 - 3250.24] shelley says thank you so much for

[3257.04 - 3261.52] thick skin
[3258.24 - 3262.64] so and it's kind of hilarious because
[3261.52 - 3264.00] you know when you're discriminated
[3262.64 - 3266.08] against your whole life for hearing
[3264.00 - 3267.76] a voice think about that okay if you
[3266.08 - 3270.80] really think about that
[3267.76 - 3272.00] okay at age four spirit of compassion
[3270.80 - 3274.08] started speaking to me
[3272.00 - 3276.00] okay from the outside of the ear

[3276.00 - 3279.20] head
[3276.56 - 3281.68] and when i was six seven years old i was
[3279.20 - 3284.40] sitting there reciting information
[3281.68 - 3285.36] okay reciting information to my family
[3284.40 - 3287.12] to my parents
[3285.36 - 3288.88] that was advanced medical information
[3287.12 - 3290.40] about viruses and how they mutate about
[3288.88 - 3291.44] toxic heavy metals how they oxidize in
[3290.40 - 3293.44] her brain
[3291.44 - 3294.72] this is when i'm 60 years old because
[3293.44 - 3296.40] it's coming from up here
[3294.72 - 3299.28] my life has never been easy because of
[3296.40 - 3301.12] it and what happens is i found out that
[3299.28 - 3302.48] when you get more and more people better
[3301.12 - 3303.92] and they recover and heal
[3302.48 - 3306.00] there's an opposition that builds
[3303.92 - 3307.84] against you and they make up lies
[3306.00 - 3309.68] and they'll say i tried zarya juice it
[3307.84 - 3311.36] doesn't work or whatever or they'll say
[3309.68 - 3313.28] anthony's a bad person and they'll make
[3311.36 - 3315.20] up a story but what happens is you you
[3313.28 - 3316.56] learn quickly that you're not allowed to
[3315.20 - 3317.84] get millions of people better because
[3316.56 - 3318.32] that's what medical media books have
[3317.84 - 3320.72] done
[3318.32 - 3322.16] you learn that you get a lot of jealous
[3320.72 - 3323.20] people in the health field and held
[3322.16 - 3325.44] scene that don't
[3323.20 - 3327.04] understand the gift or they're jealous
[3325.44 - 3328.88] because
[3327.04 - 3331.20] why is he allowed to get all this
[3328.88 - 3332.16] advanced medical information so the crap
[3331.20 - 3334.48] i get
[3332.16 - 3335.92] for breaking all the rules and letting
[3334.48 - 3337.36] you guys know the true causes of

[3385.36 - 3391.84] so um one of the things is that what you
[3391.92 - 3394.56] one of the things that i've talked about
[3393.20 - 3395.28] and i've talked about the medical medium
[3394.56 - 3396.88] books for
[3395.28 - 3398.32] for any of this that's happening like
[3396.88 - 3400.16] that is um
[3398.32 - 3401.36] toxic heavy metals they and i've been
[3400.16 - 3404.48] talking about this for years
[3401.36 - 3408.00] i actually a pediatrician uh
[3404.48 - 3408.56] friend of mine it runs into this all the
[3408.00 - 3412.08] time
[3408.56 - 3414.72] okay runs into this all the time and um
[3412.08 - 3416.00] and this pediatrician friend of mine
[3414.72 - 3417.92] which i'm gonna have on
[3416.00 - 3419.84] so what i'm gonna start doing you guys
[3417.92 - 3422.64] and i had dr alana
[3419.84 - 3423.84] um zabloski i had her on i don't know if
[3422.64 - 3424.56] you guys remember but i had her on
[3423.84 - 3426.80] instagram
[3424.56 - 3427.60] but i'm gonna start bringing with dr
[3426.80 - 3429.44] friends on
[3427.60 - 3431.04] and in all that i'm gonna be doing that
[3429.44 - 3432.40] soon so i'm gonna start having doctors
[3431.04 - 3433.76] on here and
[3432.40 - 3435.52] and they can help you know with because
[3433.76 - 3437.28] they know the medical medium information
[3435.52 - 3439.12] and so toxic heavy metals is something
[3437.28 - 3441.28] that i talk to pediatricians about all
[3439.12 - 3442.80] the times friend of mine's patrician and
[3441.28 - 3444.88] and it's about getting toxic heavy
[3442.80 - 3447.68] metals out that's part of
[3444.88 - 3448.72] of what can be really helpful so you can
[3447.68 - 3450.00] go and talk to your doctor a
[3448.72 - 3451.92] pediatrician
[3450.00 - 3453.60] and and ask them about that and show
[3451.92 - 3454.56] them the medical medium information if
[3453.60 - 3457.20] you'd like
[3454.56 - 3458.88] and um and and maybe look at some of the
[3457.20 - 3460.00] no foods and then some of the foods you
[3458.88 - 3462.40] could bring in
[3460.00 - 3463.36] but talk to your practitioner for sure
[3462.40 - 3464.40] bring the information to your
[3463.36 - 3466.08] practitioner
[3464.40 - 3468.24] and i'm gonna i'm gonna have a
[3466.08 - 3470.48] pediatrician on eventually
[3468.24 - 3472.08] and i'm gonna ask that pediatrician
[3470.48 - 3474.40] these very questions so you can hear it
[3472.08 - 3476.88] straight from a doctor
[3474.40 - 3476.88] so yeah
[3479.84 - 3482.96] blanca can celery juice help with
[3481.60 - 3485.60] glaucoma
[3482.96 - 3486.84] i am tired of using so many drops and
[3485.60 - 3490.40] having my eye
[3486.84 - 3491.84] lasered glaucoma what if you go inside
[3490.40 - 3494.24] the book cleanse the heel if i had
[3491.84 - 3497.04] glaucoma i'd go inside the book here
[3494.24 - 3498.56] and i just opened it just now right here
[3497.04 - 3500.48] so what you'll see is
[3498.56 - 3502.96] you'll see is glaucoma i don't know if
[3500.48 - 3504.40] you can see that right to the left
[3502.96 - 3507.12] or to the right if that's what that is
[3504.40 - 3509.04] on your on your side your guys's side
[3507.12 - 3510.64] but yeah so glaucoma and it looks and
[3509.04 - 3511.92] you'll see the true causes of it see
[3510.64 - 3512.80] then you learn well what are the true
[3511.92 - 3516.48] causes
[3512.80 - 3517.04] um with with eye problems i tend to love
[3516.48 - 3518.96] to do
[3517.04 - 3520.72] food stuff too of course the different
[3518.96 - 3521.92] food stuff you might want to pick out a
[3520.72 - 3523.20] cleanse that maybe your doctor
[3521.92 - 3525.92] recommends out of here or
[3523.20 - 3527.60] likes or feels is is adequate for you
[3525.92 - 3531.20] you can go into the food sections
[3527.60 - 3531.76] i would avoid eggs dairy milk cheese
[3531.20 - 3533.76] butter
[3531.76 - 3535.04] which is dairy i would avoid that on a
[3533.76 - 3536.32] diet keep the gluten out of the diet
[3535.04 - 3536.96] that's the first step i would do
[3536.32 - 3538.40] personally
[3536.96 - 3540.96] whether your animal protein or your
[3538.40 - 3542.72] plant-based just obviously plant-based
[3540.96 - 3544.00] you're not going to be doing
[3542.72 - 3545.20] those foods but gluten you would be
[3544.00 - 3546.32] doing so i would avoid that if you're
[3545.20 - 3548.64] plant-based but
[3546.32 - 3550.72] and um i would clean some of that up
[3548.64 - 3552.56] just to start with and over time you
[3550.72 - 3553.04] might see just with that alone because
[3552.56 - 3554.88] it's not
[3553.04 - 3556.96] feeding the very true cause which i have
[3554.88 - 3558.64] listed in here is a virus
[3556.96 - 3560.16] once that virus isn't getting the food
[3558.64 - 3562.08] it likes the
[3560.16 - 3563.76] the eye pressure tends to come down so
[3562.08 - 3565.76] i've watched this for years where
[3563.76 - 3567.44] then the eye pressure tends to come down
[3565.76 - 3568.72] in the eyes and the reason why is
[3567.44 - 3570.80] because the virus isn't
[3568.72 - 3573.84] taking advantage of all of the foods and
[3570.80 - 3573.84] other stuff
[3574.96 - 3578.96] okay admiral hi anthony how long does it
[3578.16 - 3581.60] take to get
[3578.96 - 3582.72] the body's trust back the body's
[3581.60 - 3584.64] trespass is a really good
[3582.72 - 3586.08] question i have a history of eating
[3584.64 - 3590.32] disorder sometimes
[3586.08 - 3592.64] i'm afraid i'm not gonna get it back um
[3590.32 - 3594.72] your your body loves you unconditionally
[3592.64 - 3596.32] okay your body loves you unconditionally
[3594.72 - 3598.40] you always need to remember this
[3596.32 - 3599.52] you're a good person too you didn't do
[3598.40 - 3601.20] anything wrong
[3599.52 - 3602.64] none of this is your fault really
[3601.20 - 3605.12] important to know okay
[3602.64 - 3606.24] so keep that in mind have compassion for
[3605.12 - 3608.72] yourself all right and
[3606.24 - 3610.56] and be light-hearted like it is not your
[3608.72 - 3613.12] fault there's reasons why
[3610.56 - 3614.96] we get we get eating disorders there's
[3613.12 - 3616.40] re real reasons why
[3614.96 - 3618.16] and i talk about that in the medical
[3616.40 - 3621.52] medium books right here and
[3618.16 - 3622.96] and you know and so there's
[3621.52 - 3624.56] sometimes we get really sensitive
[3622.96 - 3626.32] hypersensitive nervous systems and our
[3624.56 - 3627.44] vagus nerve gets sensitive and we get
[3626.32 - 3629.12] anxiety
[3627.44 - 3631.12] because we're either low grade viral or
[3629.12 - 3633.28] we got some toxic heavy metals and then
[3631.12 - 3634.64] it triggers off an eating disorder or
[3633.28 - 3636.16] you know we've been through hell
[3634.64 - 3638.16] you know and back we had a really
[3636.16 - 3640.16] difficult experience
[3638.16 - 3641.76] an emotional experience or a really big
[3640.16 - 3644.24] upset in our life or a loss
[3641.76 - 3645.44] and that can trigger it off and when i
[3644.24 - 3647.52] talk about how
[3645.44 - 3649.28] you know your your your body loves you
[3647.52 - 3650.48] and it's working with you on this so
