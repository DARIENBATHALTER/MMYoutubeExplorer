[145.60 - 149.56] spices you guys know about herbs and
[147.68 - 152.12] spices you're using them I'm sure you
[149.56 - 154.16] are they in your life one way or another
[152.12 - 155.88] um and sometimes people they're not
[154.16 - 158.48] familiar with it and they like they like
[155.88 - 160.16] their food plain or they don't like
[158.48 - 163.56] something spicy well maybe there's ways
[160.16 - 167.00] of getting some of this medicine into

[180.40 - 185.68] our body why they're important there's a
[183.80 - 188.96] lot of confusion around herbs and spices
[185.68 - 191.28] even to today but we're going to you
[188.96 - 192.72] know air that out now lot lot of the
[191.28 - 194.72] information all the information I'm
[192.72 - 198.04] pulling out is out of my lifechanging
[194.72 - 200.60] Foods book and you guys are going to be
[198.04 - 202.64] so happy when you get this book and so

[202.64 - 208.00] book and it's information from Spirit
[205.48 - 211.84] and so what's exciting about this is
[208.00 - 214.00] that it's not just um the same old stuff
[211.84 - 217.60] it's not stuff that's been circulating
[214.00 - 219.80] over and over and over again because
[217.60 - 222.48] what happens in the health field is that
[219.80 - 225.20] when information just gets repackaged
[222.48 - 226.96] and then repackaged with a new bow and
[225.20 - 230.44] then repackaged with a new you know with
[226.96 - 233.20] new paper and new bow and but it's old
[230.44 - 235.64] information and we can't do that anymore
[233.20 - 237.76] we can't I can't do that I'm never going
[235.64 - 240.68] to do that I never did I have to give
[237.76 - 243.40] you guys the information that's real
[240.68 - 245.40] that's accurate that's uh that's on the
[243.40 - 247.48] Forefront that's leading the way that's
[245.40 - 249.52] pioneering the way because it's the only
[247.48 - 250.92] way to get you better it's the only only
[249.52 - 253.80] way to get you better it can't mess
[250.92 - 256.28] around here at all cannot mess around
[253.80 - 258.92] your life your health everything is so
[256.28 - 262.12] important to you to your family to your
[258.92 - 263.68] loved ones to me it's important too for

[263.68 - 267.56] your family I want your friends healthy
[265.28 - 269.48] you healthy I want you getting what you
[267.56 - 271.08] need and so we're going to cover that
[269.48 - 273.60] with the herbs and spices this isn't
[271.08 - 277.64] repackaged information over and over
[273.60 - 279.16] again okay so this is brand new and it's
[277.64 - 281.72] important to know this never before
[279.16 - 283.44] released so um it all started for me if
[281.72 - 286.20] you just logged on it started for me at
[283.44 - 287.96] age four heard a voice perfectly clear
[286.20 - 290.32] uh The Voice told me my grandmother had
[287.96 - 292.36] lung cancer um and that's where it
[290.32 - 296.04] started I had to diagnose my grandmother
[292.36 - 298.96] lung cancer at age 4 uh and um you know
[296.04 - 301.84] it it Stir It created quite a stir up
[298.96 - 303.76] with my family family and my life
[301.84 - 306.00] because it never went away this gift it
[303.76 - 308.08] stayed there you know part when I was

[351.08 - 354.48] younger you know I suffered with it and
[353.00 - 356.72] I know you guys know that I've talked
[354.48 - 358.88] about it before but I remember
[356.72 - 361.64] specifically just waking up every
[358.88 - 364.64] morning with with Dread because I knew

[383.28 - 387.64] problems and it and it was just you know
[385.76 - 389.76] happening and happening one of the
[387.64 - 392.60] things that helped me through it one of
[389.76 - 396.44] the things that helped me through it was
[392.60 - 399.32] knowing information about like herbs and
[396.44 - 401.60] spices knowing information that didn't
[399.32 - 402.56] even ex I mean I mean really the the
[401.60 - 404.08] information that comes out of
[402.56 - 406.20] life-changing Foods doesn't even exist
[404.08 - 409.00] out there in any books now but
[406.20 - 411.64] especially especially back then you know
[409.00 - 414.36] to know what these things were good for
[411.64 - 416.44] you know to know why people you know
[414.36 - 418.44] they they didn't just know why people
[416.44 - 420.88] were getting help without realizing it
[418.44 - 422.76] as they were taking or ingesting or
[420.88 - 425.40] using it in cooking or using herbs and
[422.76 - 427.28] spices in some kind of food that was the
[425.40 - 430.08] that was the fun Parts there were fun
[427.28 - 432.24] Parts um it was like being over a
[430.08 - 435.52] friend's house and they were putting
[432.24 - 437.88] oregano on you know Food and Spirit
[435.52 - 441.08] downloading information immediately on
[437.88 - 444.20] what oregano was doing at age 9 years
[441.08 - 446.16] old and it just coming through of all
[444.20 - 448.32] the information of what it kills in the
[446.16 - 450.48] body all the bad bugs and what it does
[448.32 - 453.60] to help the immune system system all
[450.48 - 457.20] just coming straight through at 9 years
[453.60 - 458.84] of age and so it was really exciting it
[457.20 - 460.56] mean meaning those that part those were
[458.84 - 462.56] the parts that were exciting so I
[460.56 - 464.52] dedicated my life to helping tens of
[462.56 - 466.68] thousands of people recover and I'm here
[464.52 - 469.64] now I'm excited so we'll talk about a
[466.68 - 471.64] little bit oh don't forget about the LA
[469.64 - 473.84] event coming up try not to forget about
[471.64 - 476.28] that I mean if if you're interested um

[476.28 - 480.72] you know keep keep keep on that um
[478.76 - 484.08] meaning like check your schedule if you
[480.72 - 487.48] want to come and um and don't forget cuz
[484.08 - 489.00] what happens to every event is I we hear
[487.48 - 491.20] it all the time this is why everybody
[489.00 - 495.04] forgets tickets are sold out and then we
[491.20 - 497.36] get we get everybody gets very angry and
[495.04 - 500.24] very upset and very frustrated and very
[497.36 - 503.52] sad and they're bombarding us with calls
[500.24 - 505.64] and emails and everything possible about
[503.52 - 508.48] how come they can't get a ticket and
[505.64 - 510.36] it's last minute so if if you're one of
[508.48 - 511.80] those people I do the same thing I do
[510.36 - 513.08] the same thing it's the last second
[511.80 - 515.60] thing last minute if you're one of those
[513.08 - 517.72] people just try to make a note and and
[515.60 - 519.56] just you know consider consider maybe
[517.72 - 522.92] getting a ticket a little bit
[519.56 - 524.36] earlier um if you can I know life has
[522.92 - 526.32] got you know a lot of crazy stuff going
[524.36 - 528.48] on we're going to do the light blast
[526.32 - 531.08] spirit's going to send light down up
[528.48 - 532.92] down from heaven and send it down okay
[531.08 - 534.48] and right on top of everybody's head at
[532.92 - 537.04] the event it's going to rush through
[534.48 - 540.28] everybody's body it is a rush it is a
[537.04 - 542.64] rush I will say that and um and um as
[540.28 - 544.64] I've always said after that happens
[542.64 - 547.68] don't operate heavy machinery no
[544.64 - 550.20] bulldozers you know no backos don't hop
[547.68 - 553.72] in any big you know don't navigate a
[550.20 - 555.84] ship right after right after that event
[553.72 - 557.92] and um you know at least for half an
[555.84 - 559.20] hour at least after the event because
[557.92 - 561.40] it's intense when that light goes
[559.20 - 564.24] through us so um that's happening at the
[561.40 - 567.80] events and uh so I'm I'm looking forward
[564.24 - 569.68] to that so let's get into health and
[567.80 - 572.20] everything you know I'm to tell you
[569.68 - 574.24] right now when we wake up in the morning
[572.20 - 576.00] right when you wake up in the morning we
[574.24 - 578.68] got I mean the first thing on my mind is
[576.00 - 582.00] what does it look like outside you know
[578.68 - 584.64] weather that's kind of on my mind a lot
[582.00 - 586.72] um you know I maybe maybe younger people
[584.64 - 588.44] don't think that I I don't know you know
[586.72 - 590.00] I I felt like when I was younger and
[588.44 - 592.84] know when I was in my teens and when I
[590.00 - 594.28] was now 10 11 12 13 years old I always
[592.84 - 595.60] wanted to know what the weather was like
[594.28 - 598.92] out there so maybe I'm wrong about that
[595.60 - 601.04] maybe young people um do the same thing
[598.92 - 604.12] but we we you know I I always think
[601.04 - 607.12] what's going on outside when I wake up
[604.12 - 608.88] and that's one thing you know the next
[607.12 - 611.00] thing is you know so like is it is it a
[608.88 - 614.00] blue sky today what's the weather like
[611.00 - 617.48] is it going to rain is it cloudy um you
[614.00 - 619.52] know what's going on there uh another
[617.48 - 622.12] thing I think about is is is the if I
[619.52 - 624.24] have to go somewhere is the car okay is
[622.12 - 626.16] the car okay you know is the is the car
[624.24 - 629.32] running okay is it safe does there air
[626.16 - 631.44] in the tires um that kind of gets my
[629.32 - 634.00] mind a little bit another thing too is
[631.44 - 636.08] did I sleep okay you know did I sleep
[634.00 - 638.00] okay um that's something I mean I know
[636.08 - 640.00] you know we we worry about as sleep a
[638.00 - 642.96] lot of people don't sleep good you know
[640.00 - 645.08] insomnia everything else we don't sleep
[642.96 - 646.24] good uh people deal with Epstein bar
[645.08 - 647.48] issues so they don't sleep good
[646.24 - 649.44] neurological problems if they don't
[647.48 - 650.80] sleep good sleep apnea which is by the
[649.44 - 653.20] way like
[650.80 - 655.16] neurological uh most sleep apneas are
[653.20 - 656.88] neurological not just blockages and all
[655.16 - 659.48] that and inflammation but actually
[656.88 - 661.64] neurological um so you know we deal with
[659.48 - 665.04] all these different things with
[661.64 - 667.36] sleep and around sleep so that's
[665.04 - 669.84] something I I think about too okay did I
[667.36 - 672.92] did I sleep okay I mean with me a lot of
[669.84 - 674.24] times I'll do readings uh on people in
[672.92 - 678.68] the middle of the night that I haven't
[674.24 - 681.08] met yet um which uh has been that's been
[678.68 - 683.48] a difficult thing for years I'll sit up
[681.08 - 685.60] and I'll actually be doing a reading uh
[683.48 - 687.44] on somebody um in the middle of the
[685.60 - 689.52] night and then you know I'll meet them
[687.44 - 692.00] and I'll meet them later on so I'll
[689.52 - 695.92] actually meet them either that week or a
[692.00 - 697.16] year later and um and I you know it's
[695.92 - 698.52] amazing because spirit's giving the
[697.16 - 700.72] information and I'm talking to the
[698.52 - 702.84] person and I'm giving them information
[700.72 - 704.64] to heal and helping them heal I have no
[702.84 - 706.52] control over it or when it happens or
[704.64 - 708.60] who it's chosen who is chosen but that's
[706.52 - 712.12] what spirit's been been having me do
[708.60 - 713.80] since I was a child um so I don't always
[712.12 - 715.56] sleep that great when those those nights
[713.80 - 717.12] are happening but the point is is these
[715.56 - 719.36] are some of the things that I think
[717.12 - 722.48] about what's going on with the weather
[719.36 - 724.84] outside what's going on with the car I
[722.48 - 726.04] slept okay great I slept good or you
[724.84 - 729.32] know I had one of those nights where I
[726.04 - 730.64] was doing a reading or you know you know
[729.32 - 733.80] that kind of thing how's my family
[730.64 - 735.28] members you know how are my pets these
[733.80 - 736.76] are kind of things that I think about
[735.28 - 739.04] are they things things you guys think
[736.76 - 741.84] about at all right when you you get up
[739.04 - 743.32] you start your day and then you know
[741.84 - 745.60] regardless of our busy lives and
[743.32 - 747.00] everything going out around it and work
[745.60 - 749.52] and everything else and going around it
[747.00 - 752.44] these are kind of like those concrete
[749.52 - 755.96] those etched and stone things we kind of
[752.44 - 757.64] think about you know right away or you
[755.96 - 761.32] know they're part of our lives and then
[757.64 - 763.76] what's the next on the list is food
[761.32 - 767.12] which is probably you know the biggest
[763.76 - 770.72] of all you know what food am I going to
[767.12 - 772.36] eat okay where you know like you know
[770.72 - 774.12] open up the refrigerator do I have any
[772.36 - 776.16] fruits and vegetables what am I going to
[774.12 - 778.36] eat this morning you know what do I feel
[776.16 - 781.04] like eating can I get a smoothie going
[778.36 - 785.52] you know it's it's like that's all
[781.04 - 788.04] there and but what we don't think about
[785.52 - 790.68] a lot and look some people just grab
[788.04 - 792.72] coffee and piece of toast you know
[790.68 - 796.08] whatever you know some people don't eat
[792.72 - 799.20] anything they just run off and which I
[796.08 - 801.48] don't think is a great idea but the
[799.20 - 805.56] bottom line is what we don't really
[801.48 - 809.68] think about though is the power the
[805.56 - 812.64] power hidden power in our food the
[809.68 - 814.28] hidden Powers the real hidden Powers now
[812.64 - 816.92] first of all we don't really know about
[814.28 - 820.60] the true hidden Powers the hidden Powers
[816.92 - 822.60] until life-changing Foods is is released
[820.60 - 825.56] and I say that because when you look at
[822.60 - 829.12] it you'll be like oh my God I didn't
[825.56 - 831.68] know that this existed so we're about to
[829.12 - 834.64] learn the true hidden hidden healing
[831.68 - 836.92] powers of our food coming up pretty soon
[834.64 - 839.36] when when when when you know when we get
[836.92 - 841.32] a Cofe in our hands
[839.36 - 843.00] but other than that we do know food is
[841.32 - 844.72] medicine it's been told it's medicine
[843.00 - 846.76] you hypocrates all that it's Med you
[844.72 - 851.96] know the quote you know food is I
[846.76 - 854.04] medicine and we know that and and but we
[851.96 - 856.20] don't concentrate it on it that much we
[854.04 - 858.72] don't concentrate on it that much we
[856.20 - 859.84] just eat get fuel in you move on with
[858.72 - 863.32] your busy
[859.84 - 866.60] day and you know do what we have to do
[863.32 - 869.32] do our chores do our work do our careers
[866.60 - 872.16] and but when you
[869.32 - 873.48] connect to what your food's doing and
[872.16 - 876.08] what it's really
[873.48 - 879.36] doing and you connect to
[876.08 - 881.64] that it ignites the healing process
[879.36 - 883.96] because your immune system your
[881.64 - 886.44] emotional state mental state your
[883.96 - 888.40] physical state attaches itself it it's
[886.44 - 892.72] connected to your soul it connects even
[888.40 - 896.00] more when your soul in your brain and
[892.72 - 898.76] your soul connects to your physical body
[896.00 - 901.88] and you know what food is doing for you
[898.76 - 904.28] it's like it makes it even more powerful
[901.88 - 907.16] even more powerful
[904.28 - 908.88] so if you're eating a you know something
[907.16 - 910.80] that's healthy if you eat a carrot or
[908.88 - 913.00] you eat a yam or you eat an apple or you
[910.80 - 914.72] eat you know whatever it is that you're
[913.00 - 917.72] eating and you're eating something
[914.72 - 919.12] healthy it's going to help you it is
[917.72 - 921.32] going to help you whether you connect
[919.12 - 925.68] with it or not it has medicine it is
[921.32 - 929.96] medicine but when you know what it's
[925.68 - 934.12] doing when you connect that dot
[929.96 - 936.96] that's when even more healing occurs
[934.12 - 940.60] more healing when you know you're eating
[936.96 - 943.64] something and it's knocking down an
[940.60 - 948.28] illness knocking down a condition
[943.64 - 950.88] killing off a virus killing off a bug
[948.28 - 954.16] lowering your
[950.88 - 957.60] inflammation actually making your label
[954.16 - 959.24] for your illness or disease
[957.60 - 963.08] obsolete
[959.24 - 965.40] changes everything it changes everything
[963.08 - 969.16] so when you're eating something and you
[965.40 - 970.32] know that that food is getting rid of
[969.16 - 972.88] your
[970.32 - 973.80] label getting rid of the label you've
[972.88 - 976.64] been
[973.80 - 981.76] handed
[976.64 - 983.76] okay then it changes it it changes
[981.76 - 986.24] incredibly I mean this is critical
[983.76 - 989.28] information that you're about to learn
[986.24 - 991.56] and so this is the power of healing is
[989.28 - 993.12] someone you know a lot more than someone
[991.56 - 994.76] I've had so many people over the years
[993.12 - 996.44] well how do you heal what does it take
[994.76 - 998.92] well first of all you have to know
[996.44 - 1000.56] what's wrong with you and that's number
[998.92 - 1002.40] one and that's what we're always
[1000.56 - 1004.72] bringing to the table here at the show
[1002.40 - 1006.12] is finally for the first time connecting
[1004.72 - 1008.36] the dots to the symptoms to what's
[1006.12 - 1010.92] really causing it and that's only been
[1008.36 - 1013.20] happening here only been happening here
[1010.92 - 1016.04] I say that once again just so you don't
[1013.20 - 1017.72] end up somewhere else getting you know
[1016.04 - 1019.28] misinformation and because it's not
[1017.72 - 1020.84] going to help you want you want
[1019.28 - 1023.48] information that's that's actually going
[1020.84 - 1025.16] to help you heal and what happens is
[1023.48 - 1028.32] that when you know what's wrong that's
[1025.16 - 1030.24] half the battle knowing what to do is
[1028.32 - 1032.88] the other half and part of knowing what
[1030.24 - 1035.76] to do is knowing what your food's doing
[1032.88 - 1039.28] for you knowing what your food is doing
[1035.76 - 1043.32] for you for the first time in your life
[1039.28 - 1045.08] for the first time it changes
[1043.32 - 1047.52] everything
[1045.08 - 1050.72] so let's talk about that a little bit
[1047.52 - 1053.40] let's talk about herb and spices and the
[1050.72 - 1058.16] power they have for
[1053.40 - 1060.80] healing so lemon bomb you guys lemon
[1058.16 - 1062.52] bomb lemon bomb Melissa that's you know
[1060.80 - 1065.60] the herb some people have it growing in
[1062.52 - 1067.72] the garden you can get lemon bomb tea
[1065.60 - 1069.72] you can get fresh lemon bomb out of the
[1067.72 - 1072.56] garden if you have lemon bomb growing in
[1069.72 - 1074.92] your garden a lot of people don't that's
[1072.56 - 1077.48] not something everybody has or growing
[1074.92 - 1080.88] in a pot on the back patio or or
[1077.48 - 1085.36] somewhere but you can get dried lemon
[1080.88 - 1087.84] bomb and lemon bomb is really powerful
[1085.36 - 1091.00] for healing because one of the problems
[1087.84 - 1095.00] that we have is neurotoxins
[1091.00 - 1099.28] neurotoxins you know mold causes a Mot
[1095.00 - 1100.84] toxin that's not as bad as a neurotoxin
[1099.28 - 1102.36] neurotoxins you know what happens
[1100.84 - 1105.96] there's this debate out there right now
[1102.36 - 1108.84] they think they think mot toxin is a is
[1105.96 - 1111.28] neurotoxic um actually no it just it
[1108.84 - 1113.28] just it's immunotoxic so it it drops
[1111.28 - 1115.20] your immune system down it lowers your
[1113.28 - 1118.68] immune system down so mot toxin comes
[1115.20 - 1122.16] from mold mold knocks your immune system
[1118.68 - 1126.16] down so that another problem can take
[1122.16 - 1128.24] over which is viruses that create
[1126.16 - 1129.48] neurotoxins okay if I'm going too fast
[1128.24 - 1131.40] because I'm talking fast today because
[1129.48 - 1133.92] we got a lot to cover then just you got
[1131.40 - 1135.72] to go back to the archive and and take
[1133.92 - 1138.56] more notes because we're going to talk
[1135.72 - 1141.80] about a lot of stuff here and you know
[1138.56 - 1144.24] and uh get you know sit back relax at
[1141.80 - 1146.52] the same time put your seat belt on too
[1144.24 - 1148.48] and so you know here's here's the deal
[1146.52 - 1151.52] so the neurotoxins that are produced by
[1148.48 - 1154.36] viruses such as Epstein bar or the
[1151.52 - 1158.92] shingles or you know
[1154.36 - 1161.76] simplexes or hhv 6s hhv 7s and
[1158.92 - 1162.96] undiscovered hhv 10s and 11s and 12s
[1161.76 - 1165.24] that science doesn't even have their
[1162.96 - 1166.60] finger on that cause kidney damage and
[1165.24 - 1168.56] all kinds of other things we're we're
[1166.60 - 1172.04] light years from that information coming
[1168.56 - 1174.60] out and um so all these neurotoxins that
[1172.04 - 1177.48] we deal with they give us Tangles and
[1174.60 - 1180.68] numbness that gives us you know feelings
[1177.48 - 1183.04] of of of brain fog light-headedness
[1180.68 - 1185.36] balance issues vertigo
[1183.04 - 1188.76] issues okay all these neurotoxins that
[1185.36 - 1189.96] cause tentis neurological symptoms Lyme
[1188.76 - 1192.40] disease symptoms these are all
[1189.96 - 1194.72] neurotoxins they're not bacteria they're
[1192.40 - 1197.48] all from the viral
[1194.72 - 1199.72] Family well these neurotoxins inflame
[1197.48 - 1202.84] nerves like the frenic nerves nerves
[1199.72 - 1204.04] that run through the chest frenic you
[1202.84 - 1206.68] know that's that goes you know it's
[1204.04 - 1207.96] connected to the word frantic anxiety
[1206.68 - 1209.52] nerves the ones that run through the
[1207.96 - 1211.52] chest anxiety when you have anxiety you
[1209.52 - 1212.96] have tightness of the chest like you
[1211.52 - 1215.56] need get the tightness of the chest and
[1212.96 - 1219.28] tightness in there tightness of the
[1215.56 - 1220.92] throat and you feel funny in the head
[1219.28 - 1223.04] then that's the anxiety those are the
[1220.92 - 1225.52] anxiety nerves the frenic nerves
[1223.04 - 1228.40] neurotoxins tend to tighten those up get
[1225.52 - 1230.96] them inflamed same thing with the Vagas
[1228.40 - 1233.00] nerve and these neurotoxins from Epstein
[1230.96 - 1235.28] bar and shingles cause the Vegas nerve
[1233.00 - 1238.80] to get inflamed
[1235.28 - 1240.24] and we first of all the information is
[1238.80 - 1242.64] doesn't even exist out there about what
[1240.24 - 1245.92] I just told you except uh in the medical
[1242.64 - 1247.56] medium book um and in the podcast that
[1245.92 - 1249.16] when I talk about this stuff in the end
[1247.56 - 1252.68] of the neurological episode and
[1249.16 - 1254.84] everything else so um first of all
[1252.68 - 1257.80] that's you know that's what's happening
[1254.84 - 1261.56] there but second of all knowing what to
[1257.80 - 1263.64] do for it is another thing meaning
[1261.56 - 1266.64] knowing foods that help and herbs and
[1263.64 - 1269.64] spices lemon balm helps with this
[1266.64 - 1273.08] condition it helps when you have this
[1269.64 - 1274.84] lemon balb is antiviral it's
[1273.08 - 1277.40] antibacterial too and we're going to
[1274.84 - 1280.88] talk about that but it's antiviral
[1277.40 - 1283.24] against the viruses like hhv6 and
[1280.88 - 1284.88] Epstein bar against the viruses and and
[1283.24 - 1287.76] different kinds of herpes viruses that
[1284.88 - 1289.04] we have that cause neurotoxins that
[1287.76 - 1290.56] cause all these symptoms that are
[1289.04 - 1292.32] mysterious that are Unknown by even the
[1290.56 - 1293.56] lime doctors by even all everybody else
[1292.32 - 1295.80] that doesn't know what connects these
[1293.56 - 1298.64] dots to these symptoms so lemon bomb is
[1295.80 - 1302.04] that powerful now if you're someone with
[1298.64 - 1304.64] UTI and you get UTI bladder infections
[1302.04 - 1308.12] kidney infections
[1304.64 - 1309.36] tonsilitis um those are all from strep

[1535.48 - 1539.84] last time you had Ginger I haven't had
[1537.56 - 1542.80] ginger in a while so I'm going to make
[1539.84 - 1544.96] sure after this show that I'm like
[1542.80 - 1547.64] looking for ginger you know you can do
[1544.96 - 1549.80] some ginger spice ginger tea you can do
[1547.64 - 1551.52] fresh ginger I like the fresh ginger I
[1549.80 - 1555.72] like getting big hunk of the fresh
[1551.52 - 1558.44] ginger chopping it up throwing it in a
[1555.72 - 1560.32] jug of water putting it in the
[1558.44 - 1562.00] refrigerator and just letting it sit
[1560.32 - 1563.40] there for a day or two days or just
[1562.00 - 1565.72] leaving it on the counter for a day or
[1563.40 - 1566.92] two and let letting that Ginger like
[1565.72 - 1570.52] really
[1566.92 - 1574.36] arrogate that water or or Infuse I mean
[1570.52 - 1576.12] Infuse the water and because Ginger is
[1574.36 - 1580.24] really important when's the last time
[1576.12 - 1583.04] you've had Ginger it's very helpful um
[1580.24 - 1584.84] what I like about Ginger is that it
[1583.04 - 1588.44] stops us from that
[1584.84 - 1590.88] hyperreactive state because we react
[1588.44 - 1593.48] we're a society that reacts you know we
[1590.88 - 1595.56] just do it's easy to react like what
[1593.48 - 1597.72] what what do what do you mean what
[1595.56 - 1599.80] happened it's easy to react it's like
[1597.72 - 1602.12] reacting every minute as emails that
[1599.80 - 1605.48] workflow in and we hear something or
[1602.12 - 1607.40] some news or something comes in and it's
[1605.48 - 1609.88] hard in this day and age to stay
[1607.40 - 1612.84] completely calm completely calm and
[1609.88 - 1614.72] unreactive in that unreactive state and
[1612.84 - 1617.08] I'm not talking about emotional L you
[1614.72 - 1618.68] know emotion you L I'm not talking about
[1617.08 - 1620.32] that

[1622.64 - 1627.68] we're supposed to we're supposed to feel
[1624.92 - 1630.68] and we're supposed to feel things but
[1627.68 - 1632.52] I'm talking about hyper reacting do you

[1632.52 - 1637.36] you guys know anybody Ginger is critical
[1634.52 - 1640.00] for him and it doesn't stop it on the
[1637.36 - 1643.64] first day it's when it's brought into
[1640.00 - 1646.64] your life and it stays in your life it
[1643.64 - 1648.96] could knock that hyper reacting down 50%
[1646.64 - 1651.88] and change your life
[1648.96 - 1653.12] life it really can so these are some of
[1651.88 - 1654.32] the things to think about so let's go

[1822.60 - 1830.24] ryal syndrome but what's causing it ryal
[1826.00 - 1832.92] syndrome is a reaction from having blood
[1830.24 - 1837.08] toxicity from having a lot of Epstein
[1832.92 - 1839.84] bar virus in the liver itself producing
[1837.08 - 1841.56] byproduct lots of toxins and it filling

[1869.84 - 1874.76] the time right thyroid cancer Ginger's
[1873.12 - 1876.12] incredible for thyroid cancer for the

[1877.48 - 1879.88] that
[1878.28 - 1883.72] here
[1879.88 - 1886.40] and yeah the spirit taught me a long
[1883.72 - 1887.68] time ago and I've been helping people
[1886.40 - 1889.24] and telling them well that it's caused
[1887.68 - 1890.48] by your Epstein bar so let's do
[1889.24 - 1892.92] something about the Epstein bar and
[1890.48 - 1897.08] that's what creates thyroid cancer
[1892.92 - 1902.32] pancreatic cancer celiac disease celiac
[1897.08 - 1904.84] disease Celiac is is a pathogen feeding
[1902.32 - 1906.56] off of a food creating inflammation it's
[1904.84 - 1908.72] not your body attacking itself once
[1906.56 - 1912.24] again the autoimmune tag that we address
[1908.72 - 1914.68] all the time and and try to you know get
[1912.24 - 1918.48] you to understand and get everybody to
[1914.68 - 1921.24] understand and and and I I self think
[1918.48 - 1923.68] about it all the time because it blows
[1921.24 - 1925.56] my mind that we've been told our body's
[1923.68 - 1928.20] attacking itself when it's not that just
[1925.56 - 1930.04] blows my mind that we're told that so
[1928.20 - 1932.04] all of us have to get on board with with
[1930.04 - 1933.56] with that you know that misleading
[1932.04 - 1935.36] information and get that right it's

[2030.16 - 2034.72] couldn't tell everyone the information
[2032.20 - 2036.32] that Spirit had but we all get a touch
[2034.72 - 2038.52] of that right that we just can't feel
[2036.32 - 2040.72] like we can't use also our intu of
[2038.52 - 2043.04] abilities and we can't you know say it
[2040.72 - 2046.00] like it is sometimes I mean of course

[2191.88 - 2198.00] on these are there's an actual
[2194.40 - 2201.00] frequency garlic runs on the same
[2198.00 - 2203.00] frequency it does now you think that
[2201.00 - 2205.36] would be bad well does that mean garlic
[2203.00 - 2209.80] is a bacteria does that mean garlic is
[2205.36 - 2211.88] bad no no no no no no garlic runs on the
[2209.80 - 2215.04] same frequency which makes it even more
[2211.88 - 2217.84] powerful the phytochemicals that are in
[2215.04 - 2221.32] garlic are Act extra antiviral
[2217.84 - 2224.76] antibacterial antifungal antimold anti-
[2221.32 - 2228.04] parasitical anti-worm they're extra
[2224.76 - 2231.32] powerful because they trick out the
[2228.04 - 2234.20] bugs they trick out the bugs the bugs
[2231.32 - 2237.80] are protected in our bodies they have
[2234.20 - 2240.48] little walls around them they Harbor in
[2237.80 - 2244.04] places that are toxic in our body they
[2240.48 - 2246.32] have they have protection methods you've
[2244.04 - 2248.24] heard of bofilm well there's a part of
[2246.32 - 2249.44] the bofilm information is correct most
[2248.24 - 2252.04] of it's just wrong and needs to be
[2249.44 - 2255.00] thrown away but bofilm is basically
[2252.04 - 2256.60] byproduct byproduct produced by bugs and
[2255.00 - 2259.04] these bugs hide in that the
[2256.60 - 2262.28] phytochemical and garlic breaks in there
[2259.04 - 2264.32] because they think it's one of them the
[2262.28 - 2266.56] phytochemical runs on the same frequency
[2264.32 - 2269.00] as the bugs the bugs let it through the
[2266.56 - 2271.76] door they let it in the
[2269.00 - 2275.56] door that's what
[2271.76 - 2279.04] happens it's basically like a whole gang
[2275.56 - 2282.00] a whole gang of B bad guys sitting in a
[2279.04 - 2283.12] little private Hideway and a knock on
[2282.00 - 2286.72] the door
[2283.12 - 2288.56] occurs and they're like who is this and
[2286.72 - 2291.40] the garlic phytochemicals are like I'm
[2288.56 - 2293.48] one of you let me in so the bad guys
[2291.40 - 2295.72] look at each other and don't think it's
[2293.48 - 2297.20] the police at all they don't think it's
[2295.72 - 2299.44] the police at all they look at each
[2297.20 - 2302.00] other and they say because they feel the
[2299.44 - 2304.76] frequency the frequency of garlic
[2302.00 - 2306.60] phytochemicals it's their frequency said
[2304.76 - 2308.68] like you know what this is one of us
[2306.60 - 2311.20] they open the door and they let it in
[2308.68 - 2313.12] and the garlic rips them apart the
[2311.20 - 2315.84] phytochemicals rip them apart and that's
[2313.12 - 2319.92] the power of garlic okay just in a
[2315.84 - 2321.96] nutshell this is some of what it does um
[2319.92 - 2323.80] so as far as conditions and everything
[2321.96 - 2325.76] else around it with garlic I mean you
[2323.80 - 2328.28] can you can you can go to town with this
[2325.76 - 2330.76] it's crazy um you know it helps the
[2328.28 - 2333.28] lymphatic system it kills harmful
[2330.76 - 2336.32] bacteria everywhere staff you know
[2333.28 - 2339.28] hpylori annihilates H pylori now here's
[2336.32 - 2343.56] the thing to understand about garlic
[2339.28 - 2346.60] garlic does not kill good bacteria this
[2343.56 - 2348.48] is a mistake in alternative medicine and
[2346.60 - 2350.92] conventional medicine right now out
[2348.48 - 2352.32] there don't fall for that mistake if you
[2350.92 - 2355.08] eat garlic it's going to kill all your
[2352.32 - 2357.88] bad bacteria I mean all your good
[2355.08 - 2360.08] bacteria sorry about that if you eat
[2357.88 - 2362.32] garlic it's going to kill all your good
[2360.08 - 2364.76] bacteria that's a mistake that's not
[2362.32 - 2368.08] right that's misleading garlic kills all
[2364.76 - 2369.64] the bad bacteria that's what it does so
[2368.08 - 2373.08] this is really important to understand
[2369.64 - 2375.80] don't forget this one um so it it it
[2373.08 - 2378.08] rips apart H by Lori it does things like
[2375.80 - 2380.44] protects us from esophageal cancer so
[2378.08 - 2381.76] esophagus cancer of esophagus prostate
[2380.44 - 2384.12] cancer so if you're worried about
[2381.76 - 2386.12] prostate cancer and your you know your
[2384.12 - 2388.00] uncle your husband your friend whatever
[2386.12 - 2389.68] and you're worried about you that
[2388.00 - 2392.52] happening make sure there's garlic in
[2389.68 - 2394.56] the diet in any way you can possibly do
[2392.52 - 2397.20] it people with Lyme disease that have
[2394.56 - 2399.64] neurological symptoms from V viruses not
[2397.20 - 2402.32] from bacteria you want to use garlic it
[2399.64 - 2403.80] kills off all the different viral
[2402.32 - 2405.92] properties all the different viral
[2403.80 - 2407.76] bodies of Epstein bar and shingles and
[2405.92 - 2410.04] all these different hhv6 all these
[2407.76 - 2412.16] different viruses and CMV that stand in
[2410.04 - 2414.40] the way of lime that are in there in
[2412.16 - 2415.60] Lime so we want to make sure we knock
[2414.40 - 2417.68] those out and if you're one of those
[2415.60 - 2421.00] that believes in Bartonella being the
[2417.68 - 2422.96] problem of lime or babesia or bellia
[2421.00 - 2425.56] then garlic kills off those no problem
[2422.96 - 2428.12] in fact it really kills those off easy
[2425.56 - 2429.48] at one shot a few meals of garlic and
[2428.12 - 2433.12] and right through the bloodstream those
[2429.48 - 2435.32] bugs just die so that's the power garlic
[2433.12 - 2436.40] has so we have to start using it like
[2435.32 - 2440.12] that it's a
[2436.40 - 2443.04] medicine and emotional support let's
[2440.12 - 2445.20] talk about the emotional support I mean
[2443.04 - 2447.40] were you ever at a fragile Point are you
[2445.20 - 2449.56] at a fragile point now I've been at a
[2447.40 - 2453.20] fragile point in in many times in my
[2449.56 - 2457.08] life you know I'm I'm I've been there
[2453.20 - 2460.32] you know I know and spirit told me
[2457.08 - 2461.72] to bring garlic into my life it made me
[2460.32 - 2465.00] less
[2461.72 - 2467.16] fragile and it made me feel stronger at
[2465.00 - 2469.00] times in my life when I was younger and
[2467.16 - 2470.84] different times you know in our being
[2469.00 - 2474.60] when we feel a little bit of little bit
[2470.84 - 2477.28] of that fra fragileness you know
[2474.60 - 2478.80] and so you know when we feel like we
[2477.28 - 2480.96] just need a little extra shelter a
[2478.80 - 2483.48] little extra protection lot going on in
[2480.96 - 2485.44] life I mean if you're ever feeling this
[2483.48 - 2488.88] way make sure you have some garlic in
[2485.44 - 2492.88] here because it helps change that it
[2488.88 - 2494.76] does help change that so let's knock
[2492.88 - 2497.28] these out we got to keep on going
[2494.76 - 2500.40] cilantro you guys using any cilantro at
[2497.28 - 2505.52] all yep you're not in your head oh you
[2500.40 - 2508.64] are cool cool great I'm glad about that
[2505.52 - 2511.36] because I want you using cilantro every
[2508.64 - 2514.60] day it pulls out the the heavy metals
[2511.36 - 2516.24] detoxifies the heavy metals but I'm
[2514.60 - 2518.56] going to give you some information
[2516.24 - 2521.72] that's mind-blowing about that because
[2518.56 - 2524.76] we know that out there I actually I I'm
[2521.72 - 2527.12] not responsible for cilantro being you
[2524.76 - 2530.24] know the heavy metal
[2527.12 - 2533.24] detoxifier that part isn't mine I knew
[2530.24 - 2535.04] about it from Spirit since day one but
[2533.24 - 2537.04] um but I didn't spread that information
[2535.04 - 2538.92] out there in time you know so that that
[2537.04 - 2540.76] was out there and it's incredible
[2538.92 - 2543.28] information that's that's when we have
[2540.76 - 2544.72] to pick our gems and jewels in the
[2543.28 - 2546.76] information that's out there flying
[2544.72 - 2548.88] amongst misinformation and
[2546.76 - 2550.88] misconceptions and fads and Trends we
[2548.88 - 2553.32] have to grab our jewels and we have to
[2550.88 - 2555.88] pick those out and leave the rest take
[2553.32 - 2558.32] what you can and leave the rest and
[2555.88 - 2562.32] cilantro being heavy metal detoxifier
[2558.32 - 2564.64] yes take that one in from the outside
[2562.32 - 2567.68] but let me give you some of the inside
[2564.64 - 2569.84] that's not out there it's the living
[2567.68 - 2573.12] water in fresh
[2569.84 - 2574.40] cilantro the living water in its stems
[2573.12 - 2579.04] and
[2574.40 - 2582.88] leaves that have the ability to take
[2579.04 - 2586.00] phytochemicals through the blood brain
[2582.88 - 2588.00] barrier and to take the phytochemicals
[2586.00 - 2591.04] through the bloodstream because the
[2588.00 - 2593.72] living water in cilantro is comprised of
[2591.04 - 2600.12] sodium pottassium and
[2593.72 - 2600.12] chloride okay these Bond onto potent
[2600.60 - 2606.48] phytochemicals okay and they travel in
[2604.00 - 2609.16] our Highway in our body in our
[2606.48 - 2612.04] bloodstream are precious mineral salt
[2609.16 - 2614.64] highway so they combine themselves they
[2612.04 - 2616.32] get into the stream into the stream of
[2614.64 - 2620.36] the precious mineral salt Highway that
[2616.32 - 2622.16] keeps us alive that gets up to our brain
[2620.36 - 2625.32] this precious mineral salt Highway that
[2622.16 - 2627.72] gets up through our spinal cord it gets
[2625.32 - 2631.48] into that blood brain
[2627.72 - 2634.40] barrier and cilantro Living
[2631.48 - 2636.16] Water okay with with which is comprised
[2634.40 - 2639.36] of these minerals of chloride potassium
[2636.16 - 2642.72] sodium bind on to the
[2639.36 - 2645.08] phytochemicals in cilantro take it into
[2642.72 - 2647.16] the stream in the highway of our
[2645.08 - 2649.84] precious mineral salt Highway that goes
[2647.16 - 2651.56] up to our bloodstream lymph fluid and
[2649.84 - 2652.72] then finally spinal flute and then up
[2651.56 - 2654.88] into the
[2652.72 - 2657.76] brain and
[2654.88 - 2661.12] then they combine with Glycine and
[2657.76 - 2664.32] glutamine amino acids that help make
[2661.12 - 2666.72] them even more powerful for extracting
[2664.32 - 2668.56] toxic heavy metals out of the body
[2666.72 - 2670.88] hopefully I didn't run that by so quick
[2668.56 - 2672.36] because I'm like you know I'm talking
[2670.88 - 2674.92] like like really quick right now because
[2672.36 - 2678.48] I know we're running closer to our time
[2674.92 - 2681.68] um so the our brains you guys our brain
[2678.48 - 2685.04] is a magnet for mineral
[2681.68 - 2687.40] salts so it's like drawing from
[2685.04 - 2689.68] whereever it can and and the
[2687.40 - 2693.00] phytochemicals and the mineral salts in
[2689.68 - 2696.60] the Living Water of cilantro literally
[2693.00 - 2699.72] get drawn up into our brain and this is
[2696.60 - 2701.60] the power of cilantro so okay let's put
[2699.72 - 2703.68] it in a nutshell something you know
[2701.60 - 2706.08] something just you know easy to just you
[2703.68 - 2708.68] know on the Fly understand real quick
[2706.08 - 2710.88] when you eat cilantro it has special
[2708.68 - 2713.88] powers magic powers to get to the brain
[2710.88 - 2716.16] like nothing else and to extract poisons
[2713.88 - 2718.24] out of her brain like nothing else
[2716.16 - 2721.96] bottom line and that's what I love about
[2718.24 - 2725.28] it um so that's one thing about cilantro
[2721.96 - 2728.72] conditions it helps OCD anybody you know
[2725.28 - 2730.08] with OCD at all um obsessive compulsive
[2728.72 - 2731.56] disorder on any level do you know
[2730.08 - 2733.08] anybody with that I mean do you are you
[2731.56 - 2735.16] dealing with that at all because it can
[2733.08 - 2737.08] hit us in so many different levels in so
[2735.16 - 2739.60] many different ways it's not even funny
[2737.08 - 2742.04] it just really OCD is a tough one for
[2739.60 - 2744.12] people I've seen people suffer from it
[2742.04 - 2745.84] I've seen people go through hell with it
[2744.12 - 2747.56] I mean I've seen people lock them lock
[2745.84 - 2748.56] themselves in their house and then in
[2747.56 - 2750.92] when they're in their house they're
[2748.56 - 2754.92] tortured I've seen everything under the
[2750.92 - 2756.60] sun cilantro every single day just it
[2754.92 - 2759.56] has to be in there it has to be
[2756.60 - 2760.92] Alzheimer's disease dementia cilantro
