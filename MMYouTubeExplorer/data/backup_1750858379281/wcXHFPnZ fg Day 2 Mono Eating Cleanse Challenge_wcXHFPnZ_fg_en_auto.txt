[327.84 - 332.96] celiac crohn's colitis gastroparesis
[330.72 - 336.64] this information is really valuable

[352.48 - 354.40] that
[352.80 - 356.24] hemorrhoids is a big deal a lot of
[354.40 - 359.68] people got the hemorrhoids
[356.24 - 361.84] and mono eating is a great way to
[359.68 - 363.28] bring things back and balance and do
[361.84 - 367.28] some healing
[363.28 - 369.20] but not just any mono eating
[367.28 - 370.80] you don't want to just do well i'm just

[392.16 - 396.08] it helps it helps with neurological
[394.72 - 399.20] issues too
[396.08 - 399.52] it's once again those minerals right
[399.20 - 401.44] that
[399.52 - 403.76] those mineral salts that's why celery
[401.44 - 405.44] juice is so incredible
[403.76 - 407.20] because of that reason the powerful
[405.44 - 408.16] mineral salts right so you don't want a

[429.44 - 436.80] you want to do it right if you do it and
[432.64 - 439.20] it takes a a special blend
[436.80 - 441.60] information that i've been providing
[439.20 - 444.08] people for over 35 years from
[441.60 - 445.84] above so cleanse the heal is where that
[444.08 - 447.44] information is the details are there
[445.84 - 448.72] we're going to run across a couple a
[447.44 - 449.52] couple of those details we're going to
[448.72 - 451.20] talk about it
[449.52 - 453.76] so everybody's worried about protein so
[451.20 - 456.08] i want to hit that right off the running
[453.76 - 457.36] because i see that a lot it's like
[456.08 - 458.40] where's your protein where's your
[457.36 - 460.72] protein
[458.40 - 462.64] and you have to understand one thing
[460.72 - 464.24] right everybody's getting a ton of
[462.64 - 466.40] protein out there they're living off of
[464.24 - 467.68] protein they got protein coming in every
[466.40 - 469.68] which way
[467.68 - 471.84] everybody's on a high protein diet did
[469.68 - 473.44] you know that everybody's on a high
[471.84 - 475.68] protein diet out there
[473.44 - 477.68] even the vegans they're on high protein
[475.68 - 478.00] diets everybody's on that you're on your
[477.68 - 479.44] nuts
[478.00 - 481.52] and your nut butters if you're vegan or
[479.44 - 482.56] plant-based you're on your beans if
[481.52 - 484.56] you're vegan
[482.56 - 486.40] you're just you're on all these intense
[484.56 - 488.88] proteins right you're on your chickpea
[486.40 - 490.96] hummus your black bean hummus
[488.88 - 492.40] okay you're eating your tofu you're
[490.96 - 495.44] eating your soy
[492.40 - 496.96] right you know and then
[495.44 - 498.24] if you're somebody that's animal protein
[496.96 - 499.36] you're eating your chicken you're eating
[498.24 - 500.72] your fish
[499.36 - 502.96] you're eating all the and you're still
[500.72 - 504.32] having beans and nuts and nut butters
[502.96 - 506.32] everybody's having their peanut butter
[504.32 - 508.32] everybody's having their cheese you're
[506.32 - 510.48] you're eating your protein everybody's
[508.32 - 511.36] eating their protein and everybody gets
[510.48 - 513.76] sick
[511.36 - 516.16] protein has nothing to do whether if
[513.76 - 518.72] you're gonna get sick or not
[516.16 - 520.48] protein has nothing to do with you
[518.72 - 521.28] getting sick with lupus multiple
[520.48 - 523.68] sclerosis
[521.28 - 525.44] ra hashimoto's eczema psoriasis
[523.68 - 526.40] psoriatic arthritis or any other
[525.44 - 528.40] condition
[526.40 - 530.16] there is that has nothing to do with
[528.40 - 532.56] protein at all
[530.16 - 534.00] very important to know okay you get
[532.56 - 535.44] neurological symptoms and you get
[534.00 - 538.08] diagnosed with neurological
[535.44 - 540.16] neurological lyme protein has nothing to
[538.08 - 541.60] do with any of it if you get acne
[540.16 - 543.60] protein has nothing to do with acne
[541.60 - 544.64] rosacea protein has nothing to do with
[543.60 - 547.76] rosacea
[544.64 - 548.64] it's imperative you understand how that
[547.76 - 551.44] works
[548.64 - 552.96] where you get sick and if someone says
[551.44 - 555.60] oh are you getting protein
[552.96 - 557.68] as if that's some kind of answer or some
[555.60 - 559.68] kind of solution
[557.68 - 561.52] to why you're sick like it's a head
[559.68 - 564.00] scratcher right there
[561.52 - 564.80] that's a head scratcher uh so is a
[564.00 - 567.84] protein
[564.80 - 571.84] bar gonna save me from my
[567.84 - 574.84] lupus from my heart palpitations from my
[571.84 - 576.64] weak limbs from my tingles and numbness
[574.84 - 578.48] and and so
[576.64 - 581.52] how does that work so that's really
[578.48 - 584.00] important you know it really is
[581.52 - 584.80] literally everyone is complaining about
[584.00 - 587.92] a symptom
[584.80 - 590.56] a pain an ache a condition out there
[587.92 - 591.52] everybody now is the new normal is to be
[590.56 - 594.16] sick
[591.52 - 595.76] that's the new normal is to be sick so
[594.16 - 597.92] everybody's got a symptom that's a new
[595.76 - 599.20] normal out there and protein has nothing
[597.92 - 601.36] to do with it now if you're going to do
[599.20 - 602.48] the mono cleanse you got to get the
[601.36 - 606.16] calories in
[602.48 - 608.48] you can't under feed yourself you're not

[761.12 - 765.92] and when you go off the fat
[764.16 - 767.44] there's this you know panic button that
[765.92 - 770.16] hits too it's like
[767.44 - 770.64] it's also a combination of being spoiled
[770.16 - 772.72] too

[784.64 - 788.64] okay so let's go into the coins let's
[786.48 - 791.44] talk about it a little bit
[788.64 - 791.44] let's do that
[793.60 - 797.12] people always worry about like getting
[796.56 - 800.08] enough
[797.12 - 801.60] of the food rainbow right getting enough
[800.08 - 803.36] of food rainbow
[801.60 - 805.60] on the mono eating cleanse the larger
[803.36 - 808.24] amounts you're eating of healing foods
[805.60 - 808.88] remember this you're eating a larger
[808.24 - 812.48] amount
[808.88 - 815.20] of healing foods okay
[812.48 - 816.40] such as papaya in the way your body
[815.20 - 819.68] benefits from that
[816.40 - 823.28] supersedes the need for variety
[819.68 - 826.72] keep that in mind i'm a big believer in
[823.28 - 828.96] variety for sure but when we're healing
[826.72 - 831.56] certain problems and cleansing certain
[828.96 - 834.56] things going on in the body
[831.56 - 837.68] simplicity helps us heal
[834.56 - 839.60] and when we're doing larger amounts of a
[837.68 - 843.44] medicinal food
[839.60 - 847.36] that heals us in special ways
[843.44 - 848.96] we're changing our body's environment
[847.36 - 851.12] for the positive we're getting rid of
[848.96 - 852.56] the poisons we're easing up the liver
[851.12 - 854.80] the liver doesn't have to produce all
[852.56 - 858.00] this bile your stomach doesn't blow out
[854.80 - 860.32] all its hydrochloric acid and your
[858.00 - 862.40] adrenals
[860.32 - 863.68] have a chance to heal right your
[862.40 - 867.04] adrenals have a chance
[863.68 - 868.96] all these things matter okay so
[867.04 - 871.12] the larger amounts you're eating you
[868.96 - 872.32] guys of these healing foods such as

[885.84 - 890.24] colors in right
[887.60 - 891.92] if you're only getting this much color
[890.24 - 894.32] of one thing
[891.92 - 896.08] you're really not getting much anything
[894.32 - 897.52] see how it works
[896.08 - 898.88] keep that in mind this is really
[897.52 - 900.56] important this is such an important
[898.88 - 901.84] piece of information you guys i hope you
[900.56 - 902.80] have your school book with you if you
[901.84 - 906.32] don't have it
[902.80 - 908.08] amazon.com us 51 off make sure that
[906.32 - 910.72] books in your hands someday

[910.72 - 915.20] you can for free
[913.20 - 916.64] you're trying to get that entire rainbow
[915.20 - 917.12] on your plate right you guys heard of
[916.64 - 919.60] that
[917.12 - 921.52] you're only getting tiny amounts of each
[919.60 - 922.88] food when people are trying to get that
[921.52 - 924.64] rainbow going
[922.88 - 927.12] you're only getting tiny amounts one
[924.64 - 929.52] little piece of tomato in your salad
[927.12 - 931.68] oh i got a little red in there there's a
[929.52 - 932.08] little tomato in my salad i got a little
[931.68 - 934.32] red
[932.08 - 936.16] it's not enough you have to eat a few
[934.32 - 937.92] tomatoes like in this medical medium
[936.16 - 939.04] spinach soup right when you're not doing
[937.92 - 940.08] the mono cleanse
[939.04 - 942.32] and you're doing the medical medium
[940.08 - 944.88] spinach soup you're getting like
[942.32 - 946.40] two three bigger sized tomatoes in there
[944.88 - 947.84] but you eat a little salad and you got a
[946.40 - 949.28] little piece of tomato you think you're
[947.84 - 950.88] doing yourself good
[949.28 - 952.64] that's the trick out of that whole
[950.88 - 955.52] rainbow thing right
[952.64 - 958.16] a couple of cucumber pieces versus
[955.52 - 960.08] actually making cucumber noodles
[958.16 - 962.64] or juicing some cucumbers and making
[960.08 - 965.20] some cucumber juice right
[962.64 - 966.64] see the difference the power the power
[965.20 - 968.40] difference right there
[966.64 - 970.24] so people are like well no i had some
[968.40 - 972.40] cucumber i had a salad with a little
[970.24 - 975.04] tomato i got a check
[972.40 - 975.84] check covered got a little piece of
[975.04 - 978.88] tomato
[975.84 - 982.00] check covered uh no check
[978.88 - 983.68] no check me you got screwed over by
[982.00 - 985.20] information out there
[983.68 - 986.96] because it takes more than a little
[985.20 - 989.28] piece of tomato and a little couple
[986.96 - 992.32] little slices of cucumber
[989.28 - 993.92] it does so when we span out the rainbow
[992.32 - 995.12] too much and we're all trying to
[993.92 - 996.88] you know a little bit of this little bit
[995.12 - 999.36] of that little bit little bit of this
[996.88 - 1000.88] it's not enough to do anything keep that
[999.36 - 1003.92] in mind right
[1000.88 - 1008.00] so a few leaves of mixed greens
[1003.92 - 1010.16] isn't enough is it enough
[1008.00 - 1012.24] well it may give you the full spectrum
[1010.16 - 1012.96] it's not like eating the whole bowl of
[1012.24 - 1016.08] heirloom
[1012.96 - 1018.64] tomatoes you guys it's not like
[1016.08 - 1019.68] having a whole head of cauliflower in
[1018.64 - 1021.28] one sitting
[1019.68 - 1024.32] instead you're spreading out your
[1021.28 - 1026.32] nutrients in these little pieces of food
[1024.32 - 1028.32] in some cases that can work in the end
[1026.32 - 1029.76] if your digestion isn't troubled either
[1028.32 - 1031.92] too a lot of people
[1029.76 - 1033.60] their digestion isn't tanked yet right
[1031.92 - 1035.52] and they can just like throw any
[1033.60 - 1037.44] abomination they want in there fried
[1035.52 - 1039.84] this fry that or just whatever
[1037.44 - 1041.28] you know bake this oils and all this
[1039.84 - 1044.08] stuff
[1041.28 - 1045.44] but you know it's important to know so
[1044.08 - 1047.92] um
[1045.44 - 1049.52] look ten i gotta tell you something too
[1047.92 - 1052.48] we're gonna go into quantities in a
[1049.52 - 1056.56] second i just wanna finish this up
[1052.48 - 1057.92] all right now the bottom line is
[1056.56 - 1059.36] another thing too when people when they
[1057.92 - 1061.36] eat avocado they might have in their
[1059.36 - 1064.24] salad a sliver of avocado
[1061.36 - 1066.08] and orange slice right and you know in
[1064.24 - 1067.84] their food somewhere and it you know or
[1066.08 - 1069.28] they have something that's made with
[1067.84 - 1071.20] all the stuff and thrown on chicken
[1069.28 - 1074.64] breasts right the bottom line
[1071.20 - 1076.56] bottom line is how do you get better
[1074.64 - 1077.84] if you're not using enough of a
[1076.56 - 1080.00] medicinal food
[1077.84 - 1082.08] if someone only eats a couple of bites
[1080.00 - 1083.92] of banana every three days
[1082.08 - 1086.88] or a couple of bites of banana every
[1083.92 - 1089.68] week you're not getting enough there's
[1086.88 - 1090.88] you can't get enough to do what you need
[1089.68 - 1093.04] to do to heal
[1090.88 - 1095.76] and this is one of the traps right now
[1093.04 - 1097.92] in alternative medicine by the way
[1095.76 - 1099.76] really important information right there
[1097.92 - 1103.20] that alone is so critical
[1099.76 - 1105.12] um quantities let's go into that a
[1103.20 - 1108.72] little bit
[1105.12 - 1110.48] while we can
[1108.72 - 1112.24] eight bananas might not be enough for
[1110.48 - 1113.92] somebody definitely not ten bananas
[1112.24 - 1115.04] might not be enough for somebody on this
[1113.92 - 1118.24] mono cleanse
[1115.04 - 1118.96] okay the bananas could be small these
[1118.24 - 1122.88] bananas
[1118.96 - 1124.96] are bigger all right these bananas are
[1122.88 - 1126.80] these are big bananas right here someone
[1124.96 - 1129.12] could have smaller bananas
[1126.80 - 1130.24] medium-sized bananas you don't want to
[1129.12 - 1133.76] starve yourself you
[1130.24 - 1135.20] want to eat enough so important lunell
[1133.76 - 1138.48] says quantity matters
[1135.20 - 1139.44] as much as quality exactly let's talk
[1138.48 - 1142.40] about how to do it
[1139.44 - 1144.80] let's go let's get working we got work
[1142.40 - 1144.80] to do
[1145.12 - 1152.24] we do we do let's get on it so
[1150.80 - 1154.64] first things first let me run a little
[1152.24 - 1155.68] celery juice let's get that going right
[1154.64 - 1161.12] now
[1155.68 - 1162.96] you guys don't mind first and foremost
[1161.12 - 1164.56] did you guys get your celery juice you
[1162.96 - 1166.32] need the mineral salts
[1164.56 - 1169.20] that's a big deal all in its own you
[1166.32 - 1171.92] have to have the mineral salts
[1169.20 - 1171.92] very important
[1172.24 - 1176.40] so i got some fresh washed celery right
[1176.84 - 1179.84] here
[1185.68 - 1190.16] one of the reasons why people heal with
[1188.48 - 1193.84] celery juice is because
[1190.16 - 1193.84] of the mineral salts
[1195.28 - 1201.12] it's a complete electrolyte
[1198.80 - 1202.48] you can be somebody with a whole rainbow
[1201.12 - 1207.44] of foods
[1202.48 - 1207.44] you you know you got a a wide palette
[1207.60 - 1213.12] you're eccentric can i have this
[1211.60 - 1215.28] you're in a you know you're in a juice
[1213.12 - 1216.72] bar you're in a restaurant a vegan
[1215.28 - 1220.24] restaurant and you're like
[1216.72 - 1221.68] yeah can i have that i say
[1220.24 - 1224.08] a little bit of this and a little juice
[1221.68 - 1226.00] on the side and you're not getting a
[1224.08 - 1229.20] complete electrolyte
[1226.00 - 1230.64] the reason why people heal is one of the
[1229.20 - 1232.84] reasons is that complete electrolyte
[1230.64 - 1234.64] which juicer do i use mary this is the
[1232.84 - 1237.76] mm-900 hds
[1234.64 - 1238.64] it has to be that model if you want the
[1237.76 - 1241.76] results
[1238.64 - 1244.16] as far as saving money
[1241.76 - 1245.60] 20 off i think coming up i don't know
[1244.16 - 1246.96] when the sale is i think it's now
[1245.60 - 1250.40] actually
[1246.96 - 1252.24] i knew it was on its way but it's the
[1250.40 - 1254.32] mm-900 hds not
[1252.24 - 1255.28] another omega juicer it's that one
[1254.32 - 1257.04] specifically and
[1255.28 - 1259.52] it's the celery juicer and it does other
[1257.04 - 1259.52] stuff too
[1260.08 - 1263.84] you won't be disappointed i'm telling
[1262.24 - 1267.04] it's my favorite juicer i've ever
[1263.84 - 1268.96] i'm working with these guys on it and um
[1267.04 - 1270.16] with them on this and it's my favorite
[1268.96 - 1276.16] juicer i've ever
[1270.16 - 1278.32] used so
[1276.16 - 1279.44] what this does is it gives you a chance
[1278.32 - 1283.36] to cleanse
[1279.44 - 1286.88] and heal it gives your body a rest
[1283.36 - 1287.68] like no other that's what the mono
[1286.88 - 1291.84] cleanse does
[1287.68 - 1291.84] it gives your body a rest
[1292.56 - 1296.24] when you're healing and cleansing you
[1295.76 - 1299.12] may
[1296.24 - 1299.52] rest more you may feel like you need to
[1299.12 - 1303.44] rest
[1299.52 - 1306.56] more your adrenals aren't on fire
[1303.44 - 1310.24] when you're doing this keep that in mind
[1306.56 - 1313.92] your adrenals aren't on fire every day
[1310.24 - 1316.32] we stress our adrenals out it's not just
[1313.92 - 1317.20] the world stressing them out we eat in a
[1316.32 - 1320.08] way
[1317.20 - 1321.76] that trashes our adrenals you guys this
[1320.08 - 1324.80] is so important
[1321.76 - 1328.56] when you're mono cleansing right
[1324.80 - 1328.56] doing the mono cleanse
[1328.64 - 1332.24] medical medium mono cleanse i have to
[1330.64 - 1333.04] say medical medium because someone's
[1332.24 - 1334.64] gonna be like
[1333.04 - 1338.48] yeah i'm eating nothing but grapes for a
[1334.64 - 1338.48] month and they just rip their guts apart
[1338.96 - 1341.85] and they actually hurt themselves versus
[1340.88 - 1343.36] help themselves
[1341.85 - 1346.96] [Music]
[1343.36 - 1348.64] the medical medium mono cleanse allows
[1346.96 - 1351.52] for your adrenals to not
[1348.64 - 1353.52] have to get overworked so you might get
[1351.52 - 1356.96] tired
[1353.52 - 1358.80] because you're healing that's how it
[1356.96 - 1361.92] works
[1358.80 - 1362.88] your body's getting a break you may need
[1361.92 - 1366.00] to rest
[1362.88 - 1368.80] or take a nap
[1366.00 - 1370.00] all of this is important to know so that
[1368.80 - 1372.84] in the future
[1370.00 - 1374.00] you'll have more energy and more
[1372.84 - 1377.04] strength
[1374.00 - 1377.52] see how that works you're giving your
[1377.04 - 1381.12] body
[1377.52 - 1382.80] a chance to heal so that in the future
[1381.12 - 1386.32] you're going to have more strength and
[1382.80 - 1386.32] more adrenal power
[1386.84 - 1391.68] right every bit everybody every day is
[1390.16 - 1392.88] trashing their adrenals they don't know
[1391.68 - 1395.12] it but they are
[1392.88 - 1396.88] they're tanking fats every day because
[1395.12 - 1401.12] everybody's on a high fat diet
[1396.88 - 1405.52] which tires out the adrenals
[1401.12 - 1408.88] they're on caffeine they're on coffee
[1405.52 - 1410.32] green tea matcha tea whatever chocolate
[1408.88 - 1413.28] and they've got their adrenals
[1410.32 - 1415.84] overworked every single day
[1413.28 - 1418.08] and then they're intermittent fasting
[1415.84 - 1420.48] when things get so out of control
[1418.08 - 1422.56] they intermittent fast and then they're
[1420.48 - 1423.84] on adrenaline once again because now
[1422.56 - 1427.03] they're not eating
[1423.84 - 1428.40] so their adrenals are pumping right
[1427.03 - 1431.60] [Music]
[1428.40 - 1434.40] what this does is it it tells your body
[1431.60 - 1436.56] we're healing it tells your body we're
[1434.40 - 1439.12] taking a break
[1436.56 - 1441.20] see how important that is you may get a
[1439.12 - 1444.48] little tired you may need to rest
[1441.20 - 1446.96] you have poisons and toxins coming out
[1444.48 - 1449.04] into the bloodstream to be urinated out
[1446.96 - 1451.44] and eliminated out
[1449.04 - 1453.84] your blood is thinning you're getting
[1451.44 - 1456.64] rid of all the fat in your blood
[1453.84 - 1457.20] your heart's getting a break and so what
[1456.64 - 1459.36] happens
[1457.20 - 1460.96] is when your heart's getting a break and
[1459.36 - 1463.20] your adrenals are getting a break your
[1460.96 - 1466.08] heart doesn't have to pump so hard
[1463.20 - 1470.08] all these things allow for you to heal
[1466.08 - 1470.08] hold on how are adrenals pumping
[1471.04 - 1474.88] something's blocking that word oh during
[1473.20 - 1475.52] an intermittent fast so hold this on
[1474.88 - 1477.28] tick tock
[1475.52 - 1479.68] hold on how are adrenals pumping during
[1477.28 - 1481.44] intermittent fast
[1479.68 - 1483.04] intermittent fast doesn't doesn't give
[1481.44 - 1484.80] you glucose so you're not running on any
[1483.04 - 1486.48] glucose adrenaline has to replace the
[1484.80 - 1489.92] glucose that's why
[1486.48 - 1491.68] so here's how it works right
[1489.92 - 1493.52] you're intermittent fasting the wrong
[1491.68 - 1495.28] way that's what everybody does
[1493.52 - 1497.28] okay because they're not getting their
[1495.28 - 1498.72] celery juice keeping those mineral salts
[1497.28 - 1500.08] going in there they're not getting their
[1498.72 - 1502.56] lemon water they're not having
[1500.08 - 1503.92] some fruit they're not doing that so
[1502.56 - 1504.40] intermittent fasting means they're
[1503.92 - 1506.96] holding
[1504.40 - 1508.80] withholding from food right when you
[1506.96 - 1511.36] withhold for fruit from food
[1508.80 - 1512.96] past a couple of hours you start running
[1511.36 - 1515.20] on adrenaline because you ran out of
[1512.96 - 1516.80] glucose your glucose is gone
[1515.20 - 1518.24] your glucose just disappears out of the
[1516.80 - 1520.08] bloodstream because you're now
[1518.24 - 1521.52] you're not giving yourself any glucose
[1520.08 - 1523.44] right you're not giving yourself any
[1521.52 - 1524.24] carbohydrates or blood sugar your blood
[1523.44 - 1526.16] sugar is just
[1524.24 - 1527.68] relying now on adrenaline so when you
[1526.16 - 1529.28] intermittent fast you're just off of
[1527.68 - 1530.80] adrenaline so you're on a high you're
[1529.28 - 1531.92] like wow this intermittent fasting
[1530.80 - 1534.16] thing's working for me
[1531.92 - 1536.08] and all that does is take you to a place
[1534.16 - 1537.52] of trashing your adrenals later on
[1536.08 - 1539.36] that's how it works you don't think no
[1537.52 - 1541.28] one intermittent fasted before and just
[1539.36 - 1542.32] i mean yeah it's been around and it
[1541.28 - 1544.32] crashes people
[1542.32 - 1545.92] right now it's popular because people
[1544.32 - 1547.28] are used to bombarding themselves with
[1545.92 - 1549.12] so much food in the morning
[1547.28 - 1551.28] that when they take a digestive break
[1549.12 - 1554.00] for a little while they pick up
[1551.28 - 1554.88] but you trash your adrenals at the same
[1554.00 - 1556.88] time
[1554.88 - 1558.64] so intermittent fasting totally wipes
[1556.88 - 1559.36] the adrenals out okay and that's how it
[1558.64 - 1561.44] works
[1559.36 - 1563.28] believe it or not that's just the way
[1561.44 - 1565.52] the body the body runs
[1563.28 - 1566.72] if you don't have glucose you run on
[1565.52 - 1568.40] adrenaline
[1566.72 - 1570.40] it's one or the other glucose or
[1568.40 - 1571.76] adrenaline you run out of glucose
[1570.40 - 1572.72] because you're intermittent fasting and
[1571.76 - 1574.48] you stop eating
[1572.72 - 1576.32] then you better be running on something
[1574.48 - 1576.72] and guess what it is it's adrenaline it
[1576.32 - 1578.56] takes
[1576.72 - 1580.00] place of glucose that's how the body
[1578.56 - 1582.56] works the more you
[1580.00 - 1583.20] run out of glucose the more adrenaline
[1582.56 - 1585.20] rises
[1583.20 - 1586.88] the more adrenaline epinephrine is
[1585.20 - 1588.40] released more epinephrine's released and
[1586.88 - 1591.36] more epinephrine is released and it
[1588.40 - 1593.44] happens like that every day for people
[1591.36 - 1594.72] and that's how thanks for asking that
[1593.44 - 1597.36] questions really good
[1594.72 - 1598.00] question by the way the sale is on 20
[1597.36 - 1602.32] off for
[1598.00 - 1605.04] the mm-900 hds that's bone dry
[1602.32 - 1606.48] there's nothing wet in the in the bowl
[1605.04 - 1608.64] that's dry
[1606.48 - 1610.24] there's no fluid in the bowl there's no
[1608.64 - 1613.68] moisture on the bottom of the bowl
[1610.24 - 1616.56] this is the hds what this does is it

[1616.56 - 1622.40] you how many juicers

[1624.00 - 1626.16] itself over and over and over again i
[1625.36 - 1628.48] could have bought
[1626.16 - 1629.84] 50 juicers already with the money saved
[1628.48 - 1631.36] that's how incredible that is it's the
[1629.84 - 1632.32] only juicer that pays for itself by the
[1631.36 - 1637.36] way
[1632.32 - 1637.36] incredible so all right

[1707.76 - 1710.24] lot

[1710.24 - 1713.92] mineral salts right
[1711.68 - 1715.36] there's a difference between salt itself
[1713.92 - 1716.96] and then what's in celery

[1716.96 - 1720.16] minerals and celery juice do a whole

[1954.96 - 1959.76] options right here
[1957.68 - 1961.60] and then winter squash is an additional
[1959.76 - 1962.96] option if you guys are just kind of
[1961.60 - 1964.72] losing it you're like well i want
[1962.96 - 1967.36] something fun and different
[1964.72 - 1968.96] you can do the winter squash right here
[1967.36 - 1970.80] any type of lettuce in particular
[1968.96 - 1972.56] butter leaf lettuce is best red leaf
[1970.80 - 1974.08] lettuce is your second best and if you
[1972.56 - 1975.60] have to use any kind of lettuce past
[1974.08 - 1978.24] that i'm fine with it
[1975.60 - 1981.04] totally cool you can do that let's crack
[1978.24 - 1981.04] open this papaya
[1981.28 - 1986.48] so this is a large papaya you may buy
[1983.52 - 1988.80] some papayas and they're like this big
[1986.48 - 1990.00] right you may buy some papayas and
[1988.80 - 1993.68] they're just a little bigger than
[1990.00 - 1995.60] this lemon there's papayas that
[1993.68 - 1997.36] are small right you're gonna need a lot
[1995.60 - 1998.08] of them keep that in mind you might need
[1997.36 - 2001.52] to eat
[1998.08 - 2005.20] 15 tiny papayas in a day
[2001.52 - 2007.84] all right okay if you read the book
[2005.20 - 2008.80] you'll know like so many details of this
[2007.84 - 2011.36] you don't mess up
[2008.80 - 2013.28] so you end up eating enough of a portion
[2011.36 - 2015.20] or getting enough food so you're not
[2013.28 - 2016.24] missing out and you buy two tiny little
[2015.20 - 2017.68] papayas
[2016.24 - 2019.52] and now you're just home and you're like
[2017.68 - 2021.76] how am i going to do this let's start
[2019.52 - 2025.04] with the
[2021.76 - 2025.04] pie here so
[2025.60 - 2033.20] just going to open up this washer and
[2027.52 - 2036.80] grab some balls
[2033.20 - 2039.92] right so i'm going to scoop the seeds
[2036.80 - 2042.80] out of this papaya as you guys can see
[2039.92 - 2044.00] right now you can eat papaya seeds but
[2042.80 - 2046.32] they're very spicy
[2044.00 - 2047.12] and they're very strong right and when
[2046.32 - 2048.64] you're mono
[2047.12 - 2050.48] eating it might not be something you
[2048.64 - 2051.20] want to do you might not want to eat
[2050.48 - 2054.88] them they're very
[2051.20 - 2058.96] peppery very very bitey
[2054.88 - 2064.32] okay very spicy
[2058.96 - 2064.32] removing the um seeds right there
[2064.40 - 2068.00] so you got a couple of different options
[2066.32 - 2069.68] you could just do this
[2068.00 - 2073.20] you're doing the mono cleanse just take
[2069.68 - 2073.20] a spoon right
[2073.44 - 2077.36] and you can eat it so like that another
[2076.32 - 2080.48] way here
[2077.36 - 2080.48] is i'm going to cut it in pieces
[2084.64 - 2088.00] all right little squares and stuff i'm
[2087.60 - 2092.40] gonna make
[2088.00 - 2096.08] a papaya bowl do that now
[2092.40 - 2098.72] now this isn't a lot of food
[2096.08 - 2101.12] right so because it's not a lot of
[2098.72 - 2102.64] calories
[2101.12 - 2104.32] believe it or not people are afraid of
[2102.64 - 2106.24] bananas they think it's so much sugar
[2104.32 - 2108.40] there's so many calories in there
[2106.24 - 2111.28] peanut butter's got the calories people
[2108.40 - 2111.28] don't realize that
[2112.80 - 2116.72] it's under a different name it's under
[2115.68 - 2118.40] fat
[2116.72 - 2120.32] so somebody's gonna be like that's not a
[2118.40 - 2124.24] calorie fat's not a calorie
[2120.32 - 2126.88] fat's fat yeah the system is rigged
[2124.24 - 2128.16] so we think that the fat is just really
[2126.88 - 2130.00] doesn't really
[2128.16 - 2131.84] offer anything like that but what it
[2130.00 - 2134.24] does is the fat makes you fat
[2131.84 - 2136.48] there's a reason for that fat makes you
[2134.24 - 2136.48] fat
[2136.64 - 2140.56] why is watermelon making me super
[2138.40 - 2143.68] bloated does that mean i have
[2140.56 - 2145.44] sibo or candida so
[2143.68 - 2147.28] a couple of things with watermelon is i
[2145.44 - 2148.96] love a look i love watermelon it's a
[2147.28 - 2152.72] cleansing healing food i love
[2148.96 - 2153.92] melons in the 369 cleanse the 369
[2152.72 - 2156.96] advanced cleanse you'll see
[2153.92 - 2159.68] melons on the ninth day right
[2156.96 - 2161.92] but what happens is a lot of people have
[2159.68 - 2164.08] digestive problems of all kinds
[2161.92 - 2166.08] they'll have things going on with their
[2164.08 - 2166.88] digestion you know that that anything
[2166.08 - 2168.80] they'll have
[2166.88 - 2170.40] um they'll have sibo they'll have h
[2168.80 - 2173.20] pylori they'll have
[2170.40 - 2174.08] uh pockets in their colon they'll have
[2173.20 - 2176.48] narrowing
[2174.08 - 2178.48] in their intestinal tract so they'll
[2176.48 - 2180.80] have all these different issues
[2178.48 - 2182.96] they'll have low low hydrochloric acid
[2180.80 - 2184.88] because their stomach glands are burnt
[2182.96 - 2186.08] big thing about bloating and you should
[2184.88 - 2188.72] learn about it in here
[2186.08 - 2190.16] honestly if you're bloating for any
[2188.72 - 2191.36] reason you should have this book so you
[2190.16 - 2192.24] can look in the bloating section and
[2191.36 - 2195.12] work on
[2192.24 - 2196.32] fixing what's going on inside of there
[2195.12 - 2198.32] you don't have that book you
[2196.32 - 2199.44] i mean you really should people got the
[2198.32 - 2201.52] blown out
[2199.44 - 2203.12] gastric lands inside the stomach so the
[2201.52 - 2204.00] gastric lamps inside the stomach are
[2203.12 - 2207.36] blown out
[2204.00 - 2211.44] right watermelon is very healing
[2207.36 - 2214.00] very very cleansing right
[2211.44 - 2214.80] but what happens is because it's so
[2214.00 - 2218.64] cleansing
[2214.80 - 2222.56] in its own way it's gonna start flushing
[2218.64 - 2226.80] all kinds of crap you got on that lining
[2222.56 - 2229.84] see so inside here
[2226.80 - 2229.84] you're gonna have
[2230.56 - 2237.52] inside your colon right in there okay
[2234.24 - 2240.48] okay right inside your colon
[2237.52 - 2241.52] you're gonna have all this debris and so
[2240.48 - 2243.28] now you're like well i'm gonna do a
[2241.52 - 2245.36] whole bunch of watermelon let me do that
[2243.28 - 2248.56] let me do a whole bunch of watermelon
[2245.36 - 2251.68] and as you're doing that
[2248.56 - 2254.96] you're gonna be like flushing
[2251.68 - 2256.72] flushing and flush it and then you're
[2254.96 - 2259.76] not going to be used to
[2256.72 - 2260.56] uprooting all that that protein that's
[2259.76 - 2262.72] rancid
[2260.56 - 2264.08] that's sticking all on the linings
[2262.72 - 2268.08] you're not going to be used to
[2264.08 - 2270.00] all that putrified fat that's stuck
[2268.08 - 2271.28] in the linings from years and years and
[2270.00 - 2273.12] years of eating that
[2271.28 - 2276.00] so then you you're gonna you're gonna
[2273.12 - 2277.92] get kind of upset about watermelon
[2276.00 - 2280.32] we get upset there's other cleansing
[2277.92 - 2283.28] foods we might get upset at right
[2280.32 - 2284.56] so we'll punish these foods during that
[2283.28 - 2286.32] watermelon
[2284.56 - 2288.88] making me bloated i'm not saying you're
[2286.32 - 2291.52] like you know freaking out but
[2288.88 - 2294.24] you know darn that cleansing food it's
[2291.52 - 2297.36] you know darn that celery juice
[2294.24 - 2300.88] but really it's from years and years
[2297.36 - 2303.36] of being fed garbage that's what it is
[2300.88 - 2304.00] and and the whole thing is you must
[2303.36 - 2306.48] already
[2304.00 - 2308.96] had uploading issues somewhere this
[2306.48 - 2310.32] isn't the first time you blowed it
[2308.96 - 2312.08] and if you're dealing with sibo or
[2310.32 - 2313.04] anything else you already have a
[2312.08 - 2314.48] bloating issue
[2313.04 - 2316.88] right so it's not like you've never
[2314.48 - 2318.48] bloated before you're eating your pizzas
[2316.88 - 2320.32] and never bloated you're eating your
[2318.48 - 2321.68] nachos and never bloated you're eating
[2320.32 - 2322.96] your bean burgers never bloated you're
[2321.68 - 2324.48] eating your chicken and
[2322.96 - 2325.92] rice and never bloated your bread and
[2324.48 - 2328.00] never bloated your muffins and never
[2325.92 - 2330.64] bloated your bagels had never bloated
[2328.00 - 2331.92] so you you're obviously bloating it's
[2330.64 - 2333.60] not like you had watermelon for the
[2331.92 - 2336.72] first time in your bloating
[2333.60 - 2339.60] but watermelon watermelon is a
[2336.72 - 2342.32] powerful cleanser too though once you
[2339.60 - 2344.16] start uprooting all that crap
[2342.32 - 2345.84] you'll have a storm in there you'll
[2344.16 - 2348.80] have a shitstorm in there
[2345.84 - 2351.04] so in the medical medium mono cleanse
[2348.80 - 2353.12] watermelon isn't recommended
[2351.04 - 2355.76] okay it doesn't mean you can't use
[2353.12 - 2358.16] watermelon it's a very healing food
[2355.76 - 2359.36] it's on the cover of the book right here
[2358.16 - 2362.40] right
[2359.36 - 2364.24] because it's an extremely healing food
[2362.40 - 2365.76] i've gotten a lot of people recovered
[2364.24 - 2368.80] using melons
[2365.76 - 2371.36] so let's let's minus the watermelon
[2368.80 - 2374.56] let's move into honeydew melons
[2371.36 - 2376.40] cantaloupes right so
[2374.56 - 2378.80] for sensitive people i've had them on
[2376.40 - 2382.24] melons i've had them on cantaloupes
[2378.80 - 2384.64] all right and i've used it but
[2382.24 - 2386.08] i'm saying in general when you want to
[2384.64 - 2387.52] do something when if you have anything
[2386.08 - 2389.12] going on with your intestinal tract when
[2387.52 - 2390.00] you've got crohn's colitis and you've
[2389.12 - 2392.00] got
[2390.00 - 2393.92] ibs and you've got sibo and you've got
[2392.00 - 2396.48] all these other problems i like
[2393.92 - 2397.84] what's in the book for mono eating which
[2396.48 - 2400.56] is your papaya
[2397.84 - 2401.84] and your banana your lettuces your
[2400.56 - 2404.32] gentle lettuces
[2401.84 - 2405.20] your celery juice your lemon water
[2404.32 - 2406.64] that's what i
[2405.20 - 2408.56] like right there and there's some people
[2406.64 - 2410.64] that got pretty strong guts still
[2408.56 - 2411.84] you know they're their hydrochloric acid
[2410.64 - 2413.52] is still strong
[2411.84 - 2415.52] their guts aren't filled with too much
[2413.52 - 2417.28] putrefied stuff and they're taking the
[2415.52 - 2418.80] watermelon every day it's a great tool
[2417.28 - 2421.20] it's a great tool but i'm saying
[2418.80 - 2423.04] it's not highly recommended for the mono
[2421.20 - 2425.76] eating cleanse
[2423.04 - 2427.44] but yet i love melons and i love the
[2425.76 - 2429.12] honeydews and the cantaloupes and the
[2427.44 - 2432.96] crenshaws and all those
[2429.12 - 2436.16] and i love those for the 369 last day
[2432.96 - 2439.52] anyway but if you're gonna go
[2436.16 - 2441.12] long term on the melon long term
[2439.52 - 2442.72] like if you ever choose to do something
[2441.12 - 2444.72] like that you go watermelon
[2442.72 - 2446.40] you're doing a watermelon every day long
[2444.72 - 2448.08] term i recommend you make sure you get
[2446.40 - 2449.68] that celery juice in every single day
[2448.08 - 2452.00] because you need those mineral salts
[2449.68 - 2453.52] that's what i recommend okay i also
[2452.00 - 2456.16] recommend
[2453.52 - 2457.44] that you should if you are doing it you
[2456.16 - 2459.92] should be pretty
[2457.44 - 2461.68] hardy when you do it because you might
[2459.92 - 2462.64] bump into walls eventually because
[2461.68 - 2464.88] there's not
[2462.64 - 2466.00] there's not enough calories in most of
[2464.88 - 2468.48] the watermelons that are
[2466.00 - 2469.20] out there some watermelons around the
[2468.48 - 2471.68] world
[2469.20 - 2473.60] have the caloric they have that caloric
[2471.68 - 2475.52] nature to it they got the calories
[2473.60 - 2477.28] most watermelons that we walk in and
[2475.52 - 2478.00] just stumble into a store and we grab
[2477.28 - 2479.84] one
[2478.00 - 2481.04] not a lot of calories in those some of
[2479.84 - 2483.04] those aren't like that you'll see
[2481.04 - 2485.44] they're kind of whitish inside
[2483.04 - 2486.72] they're a little pale inside they're not
[2485.44 - 2489.60] deep red with
[2486.72 - 2491.60] all that sugar and glucose so that's
[2489.60 - 2493.04] another mistake too you just go okay i'm
[2491.60 - 2494.16] gonna do watermelon cleanse you grab a
[2493.04 - 2495.36] watermelon from the store and that
[2494.16 - 2496.72] watermelon doesn't have a lot of
[2495.36 - 2498.32] calories because it's not like somebody
[2496.72 - 2498.80] else's watermelon somewhere else in the
[2498.32 - 2501.04] world
[2498.80 - 2502.96] where it's deep rich red all the seeds
[2501.04 - 2505.36] in there just keep in mind that that
[2502.96 - 2508.00] that's just some of the some of the
[2505.36 - 2509.52] things that just to look out for
[2508.00 - 2511.92] but you notice the medical medium
[2509.52 - 2515.52] cleanse is
[2511.92 - 2516.24] mono cleanse is based with based out of
[2515.52 - 2518.24] a
[2516.24 - 2519.28] papaya so we're doing the papaya right
[2518.24 - 2520.96] here okay
[2519.28 - 2523.04] and what we do is you can do you take
[2520.96 - 2524.64] the banana
[2523.04 - 2527.12] chop it up throw it on top of the papaya
[2524.64 - 2528.64] if you're gonna do the papaya banana one
[2527.12 - 2530.16] so if you're gonna mix them and do i
[2528.64 - 2532.48] like the papaya banana
[2530.16 - 2534.24] together that's one i really like but i
[2532.48 - 2536.00] also like when you know
[2534.24 - 2537.76] many times i've had to recommend for
[2536.00 - 2539.92] people to do the banana one
[2537.76 - 2541.52] just the banana and lettuce to recover
[2539.92 - 2542.80] them and get them better and stronger
[2541.52 - 2544.96] and healthier
[2542.80 - 2547.12] um so you can just literally go this
[2544.96 - 2549.68] route right here
[2547.12 - 2552.40] grab a fork and now you're having your
[2549.68 - 2557.36] banana pieces
[2552.40 - 2557.36] so good having your papaya piece
[2559.36 - 2562.96] blending papaya is actually one of my
[2561.12 - 2566.32] favorite too here's another thing
[2562.96 - 2568.96] take your lettuce leaf right
[2566.32 - 2570.32] put your banana pieces here put some
[2568.96 - 2573.20] papaya pieces in your
[2570.32 - 2578.88] your lettuce leaf right and then you got
[2573.20 - 2582.00] your lettuce papaya banana
[2578.88 - 2582.00] that's not a lot of food
[2582.88 - 2585.92] it's one banana and a half of a large
[2585.04 - 2588.72] papaya
[2585.92 - 2589.20] it's not a lot of food keep that in mind
[2588.72 - 2592.48] so
[2589.20 - 2595.52] you may need a whole bunch of these from
[2592.48 - 2596.96] morning till night okay if you're really
[2595.52 - 2598.08] really hungry like you're hitting the
[2596.96 - 2600.08] wall you're hungry
[2598.08 - 2601.84] you're craving you're hungry if you're
[2600.08 - 2603.60] only three bananas in
[2601.84 - 2605.12] half a papaya in and it's four o'clock
[2603.60 - 2606.80] in the afternoon and you're like hitting
[2605.12 - 2609.92] you're just like
[2606.80 - 2611.44] you want to scream then you know
[2609.92 - 2613.36] you need some more so keep that in mind
[2611.44 - 2614.08] how it works very important information
[2613.36 - 2618.32] right here
[2614.08 - 2620.16] all right all right we got that
[2618.32 - 2621.52] that was fun let's go into the next part
[2620.16 - 2625.28] so we need to do
[2621.52 - 2627.04] i want to blend up papaya real quick
[2625.28 - 2628.72] i know i did that yesterday but it's
[2627.04 - 2630.24] important to do it again and show
[2628.72 - 2633.36] everybody because
[2630.24 - 2636.40] it's it's such a great tool
[2633.36 - 2649.84] so let's get some papaya in here do a
[2636.40 - 2649.84] little blend up real quick
[2652.96 - 2656.00] so we're getting some papaya in here
[2654.64 - 2658.32] right here
[2656.00 - 2660.72] and we're gonna do just a quick papaya
[2658.32 - 2660.72] blend
[2660.96 - 2666.88] right now you can you can scoop right
[2664.40 - 2670.24] down to the skins of your papayas like
[2666.88 - 2672.00] right to this you know inner rind
[2670.24 - 2677.84] okay keep that in mind you can totally
[2672.00 - 2677.84] do that
[2678.88 - 2681.84] do a quick little blend
[2681.92 - 2690.96] this is probably one of my favorite ways
[2683.84 - 2693.92] of doing it
[2690.96 - 2698.40] and i'll give you a recap you guys 16 to
[2693.92 - 2701.20] 32 ounces of lemon water upon waking
[2698.40 - 2704.08] okay i i think 32 ounces of lemon water
[2701.20 - 2707.76] is smart even if you use a half a lemon
[2704.08 - 2710.16] right then you move on 15-30 minutes
[2707.76 - 2714.00] later you're on your celery juice
[2710.16 - 2716.96] right you got that
[2714.00 - 2718.56] and then you're moving on to whatever
[2716.96 - 2719.60] food choice you have you don't have to
[2718.56 - 2721.28] have your lettuce
[2719.60 - 2723.20] in the morning you could save that for
[2721.28 - 2725.52] lunch your lunch version
[2723.20 - 2727.92] you can save it for the end of the day
[2725.52 - 2730.16] version right
[2727.92 - 2730.16] and
[2730.96 - 2734.88] so i got some papaya that's blended
[2737.20 - 2740.08] fun fun fun
[2741.12 - 2745.12] all right and what i like to do i'm just
[2743.84 - 2747.84] going to move this out of the way real
[2745.12 - 2747.84] quick
[2748.64 - 2755.36] what i like to do is peel back a banana
[2752.88 - 2755.36] like this
[2756.40 - 2764.55] i like to cut in pieces
[2761.37 - 2764.55] [Music]
[2768.16 - 2774.72] and anyway
[2771.84 - 2775.52] i got it right there in the in the the
[2774.72 - 2778.48] cut pieces
[2775.52 - 2779.20] in the bowl of papaya so what i like to
[2778.48 - 2781.28] do is dip
[2779.20 - 2783.44] it so i take the piece of banana and dip
[2781.28 - 2783.44] it
[2783.76 - 2788.24] don't knock it till you try it it's that
[2786.96 - 2791.04] good
[2788.24 - 2791.76] like if you were here right now and i
[2791.04 - 2796.16] was like
[2791.76 - 2796.16] dude just dip it in there
[2796.32 - 2800.08] don't knock it to your stripe that's
[2797.52 - 2800.08] incredible
[2800.24 - 2803.52] but then again you could be somebody
[2801.60 - 2805.60] that's so addicted
[2803.52 - 2807.12] to all the bad stuff you don't know what
[2805.60 - 2808.64] you're tasting
[2807.12 - 2810.64] and that's what i love about the mono
[2808.64 - 2813.92] cleanse it brings you
[2810.64 - 2814.84] back around so that you might be able to
[2813.92 - 2818.24] detect
[2814.84 - 2820.16] poison in all your food
[2818.24 - 2821.76] because that's what happens everybody's
[2820.16 - 2823.20] poisoning themselves
[2821.76 - 2825.68] they're poisoning themselves a cow's
[2823.20 - 2827.68] milk poisoning themselves with
[2825.68 - 2829.36] with soy they're poisoning themselves
[2827.68 - 2830.48] with caffeine they're poisoning
[2829.36 - 2832.08] themselves with all kinds of different
[2830.48 - 2833.44] things apple cider vinegar all kinds of
[2832.08 - 2834.96] stuff vinegar and all their food they're
[2833.44 - 2838.48] just poisoning themselves
[2834.96 - 2842.24] and what happens is when you remove
[2838.48 - 2844.96] all the poison right and you keep it
[2842.24 - 2847.92] plain and simple you guys
[2844.96 - 2850.56] and you get used to that simplicity and
[2847.92 - 2853.12] then your body reorganizes
[2850.56 - 2853.92] okay your taste buds reorganize your
[2853.12 - 2856.40] your central
[2853.92 - 2857.44] nervous system connects to the taste
[2856.40 - 2860.32] buds right
[2857.44 - 2862.72] your cranial nerves go to the taste buds
[2860.32 - 2865.92] your cranial nerves
[2862.72 - 2867.04] go to all those nerves that that are
[2865.92 - 2869.52] there for your senses
[2867.04 - 2870.64] and all of a sudden everything starts
[2869.52 - 2871.84] changing
[2870.64 - 2873.44] because you're getting away from the
[2871.84 - 2874.88] poisons for a little bit because
[2873.44 - 2876.32] everybody's they're just poisoning
[2874.88 - 2876.64] themselves that's what they're taught to
[2876.32 - 2879.12] do
[2876.64 - 2879.92] right and once you're doing this you get
[2879.12 - 2883.28] used to it
[2879.92 - 2883.92] and you do this long enough and then you
[2883.28 - 2885.76] go to
[2883.92 - 2886.96] back to all that poison you're used to
[2885.76 - 2889.04] eating
[2886.96 - 2890.24] right you go back to all the poison now
[2889.04 - 2891.84] you're on the caffeine
[2890.24 - 2894.00] now you're on the butter and your cheese
[2891.84 - 2896.40] and everything else you go back to it
[2894.00 - 2897.84] and the vinegar and everything and the
[2896.40 - 2900.48] kombucha tea
[2897.84 - 2902.16] straight poison once you go back to all
[2900.48 - 2903.92] that you'll be like what
[2902.16 - 2905.60] and that's why this is critical to
[2903.92 - 2908.56] realign things to get
[2905.60 - 2909.76] you back to where you're supposed to be
[2908.56 - 2914.48] to be able to heal
[2909.76 - 2916.48] too all right so let's keep it moving
[2914.48 - 2918.16] if you guys just got here talking about

[2920.96 - 2925.36] couple different ways of doing it
[2922.48 - 2928.32] let's move on to some mashed potatoes

[2993.36 - 2999.84] potatoes like this if you want
[2994.96 - 2999.84] pretty easy so you could use this
[3002.64 - 3008.16] so let's recap a little bit we got 16 to
[3006.16 - 3010.08] 32 ounces of lemon water is an inside
[3008.16 - 3010.56] thing going on here's inside jokes going
[3010.08 - 3014.80] on
[3010.56 - 3018.56] we got 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water
[3014.80 - 3021.60] we got 16 to 32 ounces of celery juice
[3018.56 - 3023.60] right okay you're moving on to some of
[3021.60 - 3024.88] your options you could do banana papaya
[3023.60 - 3026.80] you can do papaya
[3024.88 - 3028.80] all right we're doing a potato and
[3026.80 - 3031.36] lettuce option let's head there now
[3028.80 - 3031.84] okay pick the one you want you can drink
[3031.36 - 3034.00] pure
[3031.84 - 3035.92] cucumber juice at the end of the day you
[3034.00 - 3038.16] can drink celery juice twice
[3035.92 - 3039.76] morning and end of the day keep the salt
[3038.16 - 3040.00] keep the seasonings like i'm saying keep
[3039.76 - 3043.04] all
[3040.00 - 3045.12] that out and drink approximately
[3043.04 - 3048.00] a liter of water throughout the day you
[3045.12 - 3051.12] can add lemon to that water too
[3048.00 - 3054.32] all right back on track okay let's mash
[3051.12 - 3056.24] some potatoes
[3054.32 - 3057.68] now you can put the potatoes in a food
[3056.24 - 3059.92] processor right
[3057.68 - 3061.12] i wouldn't put them in a blender i
[3059.92 - 3063.12] wouldn't
[3061.12 - 3064.48] i wouldn't put a potato in a blender i
[3063.12 - 3066.72] don't know i don't think that i don't
[3064.48 - 3068.72] think that would be a smart thing to do
[3066.72 - 3070.56] right so i'm just mashing up these
[3068.72 - 3072.88] potatoes
[3070.56 - 3074.72] so i'm doing some mashed potatoes now i
[3072.88 - 3075.52] get it everybody wants salt they want
[3074.72 - 3078.40] butter
[3075.52 - 3080.84] they want cheese in here right that's
[3078.40 - 3084.08] that's what everybody wants
[3080.84 - 3087.84] and remember this is plain
[3084.08 - 3090.16] this is plain for reason
[3087.84 - 3093.28] this is about sacrificing a little
[3090.16 - 3097.68] without having a sacrifice
[3093.28 - 3100.80] this is just as healing
[3097.68 - 3104.00] as the other medical medium cleanses
[3100.80 - 3106.00] it does different things okay
[3104.00 - 3107.12] most importantly really gives your
[3106.00 - 3110.40] digestive system
[3107.12 - 3112.24] a total break which is key
[3110.40 - 3115.36] you give your digestive system a break
[3112.24 - 3117.20] right i left the skins on this potato
[3115.36 - 3119.44] you can take the skins off if you really
[3117.20 - 3122.00] wanted to you don't have to
[3119.44 - 3122.56] you're getting rid of addictions you
[3122.00 - 3126.80] guys
[3122.56 - 3129.84] you're restarting your taste buds you're
[3126.80 - 3133.60] healing your stomach glands
[3129.84 - 3137.12] you're rebuilding your hcl
[3133.60 - 3138.88] you're rebuilding your hcl
[3137.12 - 3141.76] what i like to do is put lemon in these
[3138.88 - 3141.76] mashed potatoes
[3142.08 - 3149.28] so dropping some lemon in
[3145.44 - 3150.84] here we go we're day two the medical
[3149.28 - 3154.40] medium mono cleanse
[3150.84 - 3156.24] challenge are you guys doing it
[3154.40 - 3157.68] would love to know i know you guys are
[3156.24 - 3159.84] many of you guys are
[3157.68 - 3159.84] right
[3164.16 - 3168.56] so let's just mash these up a little bit
[3178.84 - 3181.84] more
[3201.84 - 3205.68] all right we got mashed potatoes right
[3203.44 - 3205.68] here
[3206.40 - 3211.68] now i'm gonna put these in a small bowl
[3209.04 - 3211.68] let's do that
[3218.48 - 3222.00] now you don't have to have four potatoes
[3220.56 - 3225.12] worth at once
[3222.00 - 3227.28] you can span those out okay some people
[3225.12 - 3229.04] are gonna want four potatoes
[3227.28 - 3231.20] some people are gonna want more
[3229.04 - 3233.68] throughout the day some people less
[3231.20 - 3235.36] you might have a small stomach and
[3233.68 - 3236.32] you're not used to stretching your
[3235.36 - 3238.72] stomach
[3236.32 - 3240.24] because you're used to eating dense fats
[3238.72 - 3242.48] small portions of dense
[3240.24 - 3243.60] fat right a lot of people do that
[3242.48 - 3245.92] they're used to eating
[3243.60 - 3247.84] pieces of meat little pieces of chicken
[3245.92 - 3251.12] and they get all their calories
[3247.84 - 3253.28] from all dense fats so their stomach
[3251.12 - 3256.56] isn't stretched
[3253.28 - 3258.80] our stomach isn't um it's it's
[3256.56 - 3260.72] shrunk right a lot of people have so
[3258.80 - 3261.12] they'll eat like a part of a banana and
[3260.72 - 3263.76] feel
[3261.12 - 3265.76] full they'll eat like half a banana and
[3263.76 - 3267.92] feel like well that was too much food
[3265.76 - 3269.92] but you can eat more when it comes down
[3267.92 - 3271.68] to the mono cleanse okay
[3269.92 - 3273.76] you can eat more so that's important so
[3271.68 - 3275.60] this is a mashed potato right here
[3273.76 - 3277.44] what i like about the mashed potato you
[3275.60 - 3279.36] could add more lemon to it too i added
[3277.44 - 3282.64] some lemon
[3279.36 - 3285.76] okay and
[3282.64 - 3287.92] put a little bit more lemon in there
[3285.76 - 3290.16] there's no butter in here there's no fat
[3287.92 - 3292.32] in these mashed potatoes
[3290.16 - 3293.76] there's a reason for that to save your
[3292.32 - 3296.16] liver you guys
[3293.76 - 3298.00] to save your liver to save your pancreas
[3296.16 - 3300.80] so you don't blow out your pancreas so
[3298.00 - 3302.96] you don't blow out your liver
[3300.80 - 3304.48] okay so you can put a lid over those
[3302.96 - 3306.00] mashed potatoes right there in your
[3304.48 - 3308.48] lettuce just like that
[3306.00 - 3308.48] and there you go
[3309.76 - 3316.00] really good that's another option
[3314.88 - 3317.92] and i don't want you guys getting
[3316.00 - 3320.40] confused about something
[3317.92 - 3321.92] yesterday you saw me eating different
[3320.40 - 3323.68] things you saw me eating the pea hummus
[3321.92 - 3326.16] and you saw me eating the bananas
[3323.68 - 3326.80] then you saw me eating the papaya and
[3326.16 - 3328.40] then
[3326.80 - 3329.84] i think there's some comments out there
[3328.40 - 3331.52] there's some people that were like oh my
[3329.84 - 3333.52] god i could do the mono cleanse and have
[3331.52 - 3337.28] peas and bananas together
[3333.52 - 3340.00] no no i'm just i'm just demonstrating
[3337.28 - 3341.28] so that's why i'm i'm kind of breaking
[3340.00 - 3343.84] the mono cleanse
[3341.28 - 3345.60] challenge around a little bit not
[3343.84 - 3346.64] supposed to be doing mashed potatoes and
[3345.60 - 3347.92] peas
[3346.64 - 3350.32] i'm not supposed to be doing mashed
[3347.92 - 3351.20] potatoes and banana mashed potatoes and
[3350.32 - 3353.12] papaya
[3351.20 - 3354.88] so you're not supposed to just pick one
[3353.12 - 3355.44] of the options the papaya option in
[3354.88 - 3358.72] lettuce
[3355.44 - 3359.92] banana option and lettuce the pea option
[3358.72 - 3362.08] in lettuce
[3359.92 - 3364.40] no potato same potato pops in the
[3362.08 - 3364.40] lettuce
[3370.16 - 3373.76] so good so good
[3374.80 - 3377.84] all right
[3377.92 - 3380.56] so you guys
[3382.72 - 3386.08] are you guys eating enough that's a
[3384.64 - 3391.84] question i have for you guys are you
[3386.08 - 3391.84] guys eating enough
[3396.40 - 3405.84] so i got the pan on what i'm going to do
[3398.00 - 3405.84] is cook some peas
[3409.92 - 3418.32] the pan on here no cheese no butter
[3414.40 - 3422.16] no milk
[3418.32 - 3423.20] all right i know we like the sour cream
[3422.16 - 3425.28] in our potatoes i know
[3423.20 - 3426.64] we like the cheese we know we like the
[3425.28 - 3428.16] butter on our potatoes but you want to
[3426.64 - 3429.76] do this i know we like the oil in there
[3428.16 - 3433.52] but you don't want to do that
[3429.76 - 3435.52] you don't
[3433.52 - 3437.36] i got my pan on i'm gonna drop some peas
[3435.52 - 3440.24] in a little bit
[3437.36 - 3440.24] get my pan hot
[3440.96 - 3448.32] so all right so now there is
[3444.08 - 3451.12] an option with the mono cleanse
[3448.32 - 3454.08] right here that's the winter squash so
[3451.12 - 3456.72] the steamed winter squash right
[3454.08 - 3458.16] okay you can do that option and you can
[3456.72 - 3459.44] combine that
[3458.16 - 3460.72] if you're somebody especially if you're
[3459.44 - 3461.92] somebody that's like totally freaking
[3460.72 - 3463.92] out you're like there's not in
[3461.92 - 3464.96] there's not enough options i'm bored or
[3463.92 - 3467.68] i can't do this because
[3464.96 - 3469.84] i've been too spoiled for too many years
[3467.68 - 3472.00] eating whatever i want and i just
[3469.84 - 3473.60] i can't do this so you can do the
[3472.00 - 3476.32] steamed winter squash
[3473.60 - 3478.40] with steamed green beans brussels
[3476.32 - 3481.36] sprouts or asparagus
[3478.40 - 3483.04] isn't that great isn't that great it is
[3481.36 - 3484.96] really i mean when you think about it to
[3483.04 - 3486.32] do all the healing you need to do
[3484.96 - 3488.08] it's good to know you look you can
[3486.32 - 3490.32] branch out with another
[3488.08 - 3491.68] option like that and that's pretty cool
[3490.32 - 3494.48] this is so good by the way
[3491.68 - 3496.08] i know this is so simplistic but when
[3494.48 - 3497.28] you're on the mono cleanse and your
[3496.08 - 3499.68] taste buds
[3497.28 - 3501.84] are going back to where they should be
[3499.68 - 3504.08] and you're recalibrating the senses and
[3501.84 - 3505.36] you're recalibrating the cranial nerves
[3504.08 - 3507.52] right
[3505.36 - 3510.00] so you're recalibrating the cranial
[3507.52 - 3513.44] nerves to your taste buds
[3510.00 - 3515.92] right so all those cranial nerves
[3513.44 - 3516.80] stemming out of your brain stem and then
[3515.92 - 3519.60] going to
[3516.80 - 3521.60] your tongue to your mouth to your
[3519.60 - 3522.32] salivary glands right those cranial
[3521.60 - 3524.32] nerves
[3522.32 - 3526.24] they're getting rewired they're getting
[3524.32 - 3528.56] recalibrated and rewired
[3526.24 - 3530.40] that's why it's important right there
[3528.56 - 3532.24] that alone is really
[3530.40 - 3533.76] really really an important reason for
[3532.24 - 3537.36] doing this
[3533.76 - 3538.32] okay so i'm letting that pan heat up a
[3537.36 - 3539.68] little bit and i'm going to have a
[3538.32 - 3541.68] little bit more of this because this is
[3539.68 - 3544.40] so good

[3736.96 - 3741.12] all that egg
[3738.72 - 3744.24] and all that cheese and all that dairy
[3741.12 - 3746.56] pretend this is an organic pie

[3825.92 - 3828.72] go
[3826.24 - 3829.76] and get their food so those bugs are

[3880.00 - 3884.40] yeah i don't know what's telling me
[3882.08 - 3884.88] inside but something inside is telling
[3884.40 - 3887.12] me
[3884.88 - 3888.72] since i've been on this mono cleanse
[3887.12 - 3890.40] something inside of me is telling me i
[3888.72 - 3892.64] need a pizza so i think i'm gonna go
[3890.40 - 3894.24] with that intuitive feeling
[3892.64 - 3896.16] yeah i'm gonna use my intuitive eating
[3894.24 - 3900.24] ability that i had
[3896.16 - 3900.96] all along yeah i'm gonna eat intuitively
[3900.24 - 3902.64] and i and i
[3900.96 - 3905.44] and i feel there's a craving and it must
[3902.64 - 3906.88] be justified and i i want a pizza with
[3905.44 - 3908.96] some
[3906.88 - 3910.24] with some sausage on it no i'll just go
[3908.96 - 3913.52] with pepperoni
[3910.24 - 3916.00] okay all right i'll wait for that pizza
[3913.52 - 3918.48] are you gonna bring it okay i'll wait
[3916.00 - 3918.48] okay good
[3919.04 - 3923.36] i'm waiting for that pizza you guys so
[3921.68 - 3926.56] hopefully we get that pizza
[3923.36 - 3927.92] you know and the bugs inside of us they
[3926.56 - 3931.12] want
[3927.92 - 3934.08] they want those foods and so they can
[3931.12 - 3935.84] tell us to get those foods that's what's
[3934.08 - 3936.80] happening they can tell us to get those
[3935.84 - 3938.40] foods
[3936.80 - 3940.16] because once those bugs are starving
[3938.40 - 3942.80] inside of us
[3940.16 - 3944.72] we think it's our intuitive everyday
[3942.80 - 3945.92]  intuitive thing that people are
[3944.72 - 3947.28] saying out there
[3945.92 - 3948.80] i'm not saying people aren't intuitive
[3947.28 - 3950.56] they are intuitive but when it comes
[3948.80 - 3952.72] down to what they eat they're not
[3950.56 - 3954.08] i'm sorry we've been poisoned so much
[3952.72 - 3955.60] with all our caffeine and everything
[3954.08 - 3956.32] else we don't know what we intuitively
[3955.60 - 3957.92] like or not
[3956.32 - 3959.68] we've been trained to like vinegar we
[3957.92 - 3961.20] don't know vinegar destroys the body but
[3959.68 - 3962.88] we intuitively eat it
[3961.20 - 3964.24] are you kidding me like we're
[3962.88 - 3966.88] intuitively eating
[3964.24 - 3968.40] no sorry we're addicted to all these
[3966.88 - 3969.76] poisons and we're used to eating all
[3968.40 - 3971.84] these poisons and flavors and that's
[3969.76 - 3974.56] what we do right
[3971.84 - 3975.68] but what people completely oh the pizza

[4043.84 - 4051.04] i'm going to tank all that pizza later
[4047.36 - 4051.04] this is actually really good by the way
[4051.28 - 4055.92] really good all right cooking some peas
[4053.52 - 4055.92] right now
[4058.56 - 4065.36] guys keep in mind
[4062.88 - 4067.52] keeping that keep keep in mind that when
[4065.36 - 4070.80] you get hungry enough
[4067.52 - 4070.80] and you clean things up
[4070.88 - 4077.52] okay and those toxins start coming out
[4074.88 - 4080.80] and those bugs start dying you're gonna
[4077.52 - 4082.64] want something bad
[4080.80 - 4083.84] keep that in mind you're gonna want
[4082.64 - 4086.08] something bad
[4083.84 - 4086.08] okay
[4087.68 - 4091.84] really important to know okay you're
[4089.44 - 4093.12] going to want something bad
[4091.84 - 4095.92] and then you're going to have old
[4093.12 - 4098.08] adrenaline come out of your liver
[4095.92 - 4100.24] toxins that are inside your liver the
[4098.08 - 4102.08] old adrenaline
[4100.24 - 4103.60] and that adrenaline has information from
[4102.08 - 4105.28] any hard times you might have had
[4103.60 - 4107.44] you had a breakup with the relationship
[4105.28 - 4108.16] many years ago all that adrenaline that
[4107.44 - 4110.00] was surging
[4108.16 - 4112.08] surging through you when you had that
[4110.00 - 4114.24] breakup
[4112.08 - 4116.72] that adrenaline stored itself in your
[4114.24 - 4119.12] cells so when you start mono eating
[4116.72 - 4120.80] and that adrenaline comes out pockets of
[4119.12 - 4122.80] that garbage come out
[4120.80 - 4124.32] it might have information in there and
[4122.80 - 4125.84] you might feel a little sad you might
[4124.32 - 4127.68] feel a little emotional you might want
[4125.84 - 4129.44] to go and then eat a bunch of
[4127.68 - 4130.88] peanut butter and you want them
[4129.44 - 4133.92] chocolate you might want to
[4130.88 - 4136.24] stick a chocolate bar in a peanut butter
[4133.92 - 4136.24] jar
[4139.11 - 4143.68] [Music]
[4141.04 - 4145.36] so this is really incredible by the way
[4143.68 - 4148.88] especially when you
[4145.36 - 4150.64] get rid of all that crazy food
[4148.88 - 4152.72] and you give your body a chance to heal
[4150.64 - 4156.88] and you start getting hungry
[4152.72 - 4156.88] this this literally is so good for you
[4157.20 - 4164.40] i'm steaming some peas
[4161.44 - 4164.40] i'm going to move this over
[4173.52 - 4176.96] what you're doing is you're stopping
[4174.96 - 4178.16] from chasing the high you're not running
[4176.96 - 4180.56] on adrenaline anymore
[4178.16 - 4181.84] and you're not chasing the high anymore
[4180.56 - 4182.48] what you're doing is you're working on
[4181.84 - 4184.08] healing
[4182.48 - 4185.68] and that's what's happening now in your
[4184.08 - 4186.32] life when you're doing this you're
[4185.68 - 4189.52] working
[4186.32 - 4192.16] on healing that's where you're going now
[4189.52 - 4194.96] you're going to that place and that
[4192.16 - 4197.36] place is a very special place
[4194.96 - 4200.84] one that you have to respect because
[4197.36 - 4202.16] you're healing now and that's what's so
[4200.84 - 4205.36] important
