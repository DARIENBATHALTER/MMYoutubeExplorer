hypoglycemia hyperglycemia to my insulin

47
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,640
resistance Let's uh what else can we

talk about all about that blood sugar

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,600
then we're just gonna say it straight

50
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,960
off the bat right now in order to have a

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,939
blood sugar issue whatsoever like a

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,979
blood sugar issue outside of the fact

53
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,920
that someone isn't eating say

54
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,739
a blood sugar issue you have to have

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,120
three things one out of three things

56
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,459
wrong you could have all three things

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,200
wrong you could have your liver be a

58
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,780
problem your pancreas could be a problem

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,120
or your adrenals be a problem you can

60
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,459
have adrenals and pancreas and your

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,379
liver is fine you can have pancreas in

62
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,080
your liver your adrenals are fine you

63
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,780
can have liver adrenals and pancreas

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,599
having a problem all three of them but

65
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,160
these are the three things right there

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,739
that determine if you're going to be

67
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,680
having a blood sugar problem so that one

68
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,140
day one day down the road

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,599
after eating a little too much of this

70
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,060
or one day down the road after eating a

71
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,720
little too much of this right here

72
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,099
right or one day down the road having a

73
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,300
little too much of this right here

74
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,280

ice cream right here whoa let me

77
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,239
see sorry sorry sorry I gotta check my

78
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,599
oxygen levels one more time

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,900
okay oxygen at 100 feeling good about

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,819
that because on hold on uh one

81
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,920
Mississippi she must be doing this

82
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,540
before

83
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,420
okay I'm just trying to figure out my

84
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,640
heart per per minute I don't think I

85
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,620
have this one down yet but I will

86
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,360
the point I'm trying to say right here

87
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,440
what we're talking about we're talking

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,599
about blood sugar we're talking about

89
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,159
new trends that happen all the time A

90
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,200
lot of people are checking their blood

91
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,640
sugar every hour they're monitoring

92
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,260
their blood sugar and then they think

93
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,300
they got it down with what they're

94
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,680
eating they're eating healthier they're

95
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,599
eating whether it's plant-based or

96
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,700
they're keto or a healthy what's

97
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,739
so-called healthy animal protein based

98
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,260
diet they think they got it all in check

99
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,239
I'm not talking about diabetics okay I'm

100
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,159
not talking about type 1 diabetes I'm

101
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,620
not talking about

102
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,940
um type 2 diabetes I'm not talking about

103
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,000
all the different types of medical

104
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,220
medium coined a long time ago in the

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,620
terms of how many types there really are

106
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,540
I'm not going into that I'm going into

107
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,239
like every day whether you're in Fitness

108
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,980
every day whether you're concerned about

109
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,560
your blood sugar

110
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,979
I'm talking about that aspect of it

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,680
right now people think that they're in

112
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:21,900
control of their health because they're

113
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,820
looking at their their blood sugar

114
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,400
they're monitoring their blood sugar and

115
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,620
they think they have total control over

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,060
their health and then as they're eating

117
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,120
and doing things and taking care of

118
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,340
themselves but what can happen is it can

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,639
create an eating disorder it can create

120
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:42,060
OCD it can actually add to somebody's

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,699
OCD it can become overwhelming it can

122
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,320
create anxiety it can be something that

123
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,540
it's more important than what you're

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,340
doing in that moment is more important

125
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,820
than what's happening in that moment or

126
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,080
that day it can confuse people a whole

127
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,460
bunch of things that are happening with

128
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,620
that so I want to go into blood sugar

129
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,479
issues also monitoring blood sugar and

130
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,860
so forth so let's go let's roll into it

131
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,500
a little bit

132
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,120
first and foremost

133
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,979
somebody

134
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,500
living their life

135
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,600
perfectly fine

136
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,979
they don't have a problem

137
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,320
and then suddenly their A1C is rising

138
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,540
they're at the doctor's office

139
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,060
they get some blood work

140
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,340
their A1C is up

141
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,620
and something's wrong and they're like

142
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,320
what's wrong right

143
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,740
and what people don't realize is that

144
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,620
it's a process over the years of three

145
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,100
things breaking down the liver is the

146
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,960
most popular one the most important one

147
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,639
as far as with blood sugar to start with

148
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,160
because the liver starts to get stagnant

149
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,320
and sluggish and when it gets stagnant

150
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,960
and sluggish and starts to break down it

151
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,199
puts a burden on so many different

152
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,460
levels on the body so the liver starts

153
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,280
breaking down

154
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,979
the ability to break down fats to

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,080
disperse it with bile reserves that

156
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,419
starts to break down and wear down

157
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,520
so fats stay in the bloodstream even

158
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,860
longer they stay in the liver even

159
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,460
longer and that gets people in trouble

160
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,460
so

161
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,600
I want to bring this guy in here we're

162
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,419
making uh

163
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,160
stovetop macaroni and cheese

164
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,600
and a little bit hang around for that

165
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,900
because I would love to make that for

166
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,900
you guys

167
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,039
macaroni and cheese

168
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,240
all right

169
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,340
so people get stagnant sluggish livers

170
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,860
they do

171
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,500
most people who get the stagnosticish

172
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,539
livers are getting it because they're on

173
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,880
the high fat diets their whole life

174
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,699
because everybody is eating a certain

175
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,860
amount of fat every single day whether

176
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,840
it's for breakfast lunch or dinner if

177
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,699
you're intermittent fasting you're still

178
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,979
going to eat fat at the end of the day

179
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,960
you're going to have it either six

180
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,580
o'clock eight o'clock at night nine

181
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,139
o'clock at night four o'clock in the

182
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,360
afternoon but you're going to end up

183
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,979
eating fat at some point even when

184
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,919
you're intermittent fasting

185
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:12,240
but the fats over time burden and break

186
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,160
down the liver

187
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,199
and when it burns and breaks down the

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,580
liver we end up getting blood sugar

189
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,560
problems

190
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,780
that's why type 2 diabetes when people

191
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,720
start eating better and better

192
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:28,440
suddenly they either need less insulin

193
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,699
or the numbers appear better their A1C

194
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,400
is better

195
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,440
because their liver is not burdened down

196
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,900
by Fats as much anymore so people be

197
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,759
like well I don't do fast food anymore I

198
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,340
don't do restaurant food anymore I don't

199
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:45,419
do junk food you know greasy food fried

200
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,220
food I'm doing lean animal protein I'm

201
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:50,580
eating more salads

202
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,840
I'm eating healthier and my A1C is

203
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,060
dropping

204
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
because their insulin resistance is

205
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,479
reducing

206
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,840
because what they were doing before

207
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,520
though over the years LED them to a

208
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,560
stagnant sluggish liver

209
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,759
eventually putting a burden on their

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,919
pancreas

211
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,020
eventually creating a problem where it

212
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,720
even weakened their adrenals and then

213
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,840
their A1C started to climb

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,180
so that's one way we get problems with

215
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,300
blood sugar issues another is

216
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,400
if pathogens get into the liver

217
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,139
and someone has the Epstein-Barr virus

218
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,120
the Epstein-Barr virus has been in the

219
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,639
liver for a long time

220
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,319
it's causing wear and tear it's

221
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,820
producing a tremendous amount of

222
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,000
byproduct

223
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,399
that byproduct builds up in the liver it

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,560
starts to get dysfunctional coupled with

225
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,240
the high fat diet along the way

226
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,940
and then the liver starts to break down

227
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,160
and get sluggish and stagnant any kind

228
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,779
of viruses the liver is like the virus

229
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,420
home hhv six hhv7 said a regular virus

230
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,580
shingles virus herpes simplex 1 Herpes

231
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,120
Simplex 2 all the different Epstein-Barr

232
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,640
viruses plus bacteria too all Harbor and

233
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,540
hide inside people's livers and over

234
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,459
time

235
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,860
if we're not taking care of our liver

236
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:10,620
and we're eating all these high fat

237
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,660
dishes and high fat meals and all these

238
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,240
Foods we're not supposed to be eating

239
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,760
every every single day we're burdening

240
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,380
the liver plus we're feeding most likely

241
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,720
what the choices we're making we're

242
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:25,019
feeding the bugs that reside inside the

243
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,839
liver and then that grows oh more and

244
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,420
more creating a a breakdown of the liver

245
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,360
stagnant sluggish fatty liver usually

246
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,000
too all around and then the blood sugar

247
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,740
becomes unstable and people have

248
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,779
problems and sure people can be like

249
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,880
well I can go and start exercising I

250
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:44,580
could get my life back if you're not

251
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,500
chronically ill and you can exercise I'm

252
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,480
gonna go and watch my diet I'm going to

253
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,220
watch my calories I'm going to eat

254
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,480
better maybe I'll do maybe I'll do a

255
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,220
little intermittent fasting maybe I'll

256
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,440
eat a healthier diet maybe I'll eat more

257
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,779
salads whatever it is if they start

258
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,180
noticing improvements their blood sugar

259
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,399
comes down a little bit and they start

260
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,339
to kind of recoup and they seem to get

261
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,380
their bearings seem to get ahead of it

262
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,720
but in the end it's not fixing the

263
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,180
problem completely and they end up

264
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,640
eating way too much fat no one fixes

265
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,140
what's wrong as far as the viral issues

266
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,100
that happen inside the liver and inside

267
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:22,440
the body the breakdown of the the liver

268
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:25,200
when it's actually infested with

269
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,600
um pathogens and people don't get ahead

270
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,700
of that so over time people just get

271
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,640
sick and one thing that I think people

272
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,160
have to understand that no matter what

273
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,620
everybody is going to be sick with

274
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:42,300
something no matter what you can see the

275
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:44,300
best trainer on social you can see the

276
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,440
um healthiest weight lifters

277
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,420
bodybuilders on social they're still

278
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,000
going to be sick with something

279
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,300
eventually it doesn't make anybody

280
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,399
indestructible nobody's indestructible

281
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,959
people get sick no matter what and in

282
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,060
the end they're gonna get sick if they

283
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,100
get sick later on in life they get sick

284
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,680
later on in life if they get sick in

285
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,440
their 60s they get sick in their 60s

286
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,620
they get sick in their 70s whichever it

287
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,420
is it hits them one way or another

288
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,519
so it's important to know really what's

289
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,579
going inside in the body so you can

290
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,160
avoid as many pitfalls as possible and

291
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:23,459
get yourself to a place where you can at

292
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,100
least avoid some of the worst conditions

293
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:28,440
or some of the most Troublesome or

294
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,320
mysterious conditions as you're living

295
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,480
your life but either way when people say

296
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,940
oh I'm gonna live forever well we can't

297
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,440
live forever we can't live for hundreds

298
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,899
and hundreds of years

299
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,300
it's just not going to happen we're not

300
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,040
going to live to be 500 years old we're

301
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,760
not going to be lived to be 600 years

302
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,500
old it's not going to happen so with

303
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,540
that in mind we have to protect

304
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,899
ourselves as good as we can and notice

305
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,339
that people see young people and they

306
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,660
think whoa I'm going to listen to that

307
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:01,079
young person because that young person

308
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:04,019
has it all down that 25 year old who's

309
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,300
you know doing the bodybuilding

310
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,880
who's eating all the right things it

311
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,640
seems that's where I want to be that's

312
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,399
who I want to be and don't realize that

313
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,620
that's a far cry from chronic illness

314
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,940
it's a far cry from mysterious chronic

315
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,459
illness because you can get mysterious

316
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,339
chronic illness at 19 years old 15 years

317
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:25,860
old 10 years old 25 years old in

318
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,680
whatever age and there's a big confusion

319
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,440
to someone who actually is an athlete or

320
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,660
someone who is young and strong

321
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,940
to somebody who's chronically sick and

322
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,279
actually has problems with their health

323
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,200
that's mysterious like an autoimmune

324
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,360
condition that they still don't

325
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,100
understand or anything about what they

326
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,579
about that autoimmune condition do they

327
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,440
understand blood sugar is kind of this

328
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:52,139
thing where it's a little bit taking

329
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,940
over because you got all these people in

330
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,440
the world right now that don't know why

331
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,060
they're struggling they don't know why

332
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,339
they have anxiety they don't know why

333
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,079
they have depression or eczema and

334
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,600
psoriasis they don't know why they have

335
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:06,060
chronic fatigue syndrome and autoimmune

336
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,680
diagnosis lupus they don't know why they

337
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,019
have tingles and numbness and aches and

338
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,940
pains and back pain body pain head pain

339
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,779
they don't know why they have blurry

340
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,459
eyes

341
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,560
and they don't know why they have

342
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,420
burning skin and Tinkles and numbness

343
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,060
like I said before in Vertigo and

344
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,079
dizziness and there's this group of

345
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,480
people

346
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,220
that doesn't know why so when they

347
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,779
search around on social and they look

348
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,399
around the internet they run across home

349
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,899
maybe your blood sugar is it your blood

350
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,720
sugars your blood sugar is your blood

351
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,279
maybe it's that and then it feels like

352
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,100
you can gain some kind of control

353
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,680
monitoring your blood sugar not even if

354
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,720
you're not a diabetic so then it's easy

355
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,459
to fall into let me see my blood sugar

356
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,139
and let me see what I'm eating and let

357
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,180
me see what my blood sugar is doing but

358
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,399
really that's a trap

359
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,959
because it takes us away from really

360
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,000
what's wrong

361
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,399
the real things that are wrong and the

362
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,360
real problems people have and why

363
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,880
they're sick it pulls us away from that

364
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,300
so we miss the ball we don't have our

365
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,060
eyes on the right ball instead we end up

366
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:12,360
falling into traps where we're checking

367
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,639
our oxygen levels every hour we're

368
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,839
checking our heart rate we're checking

369
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,839
our blood sugar every hour or two hours

370
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,579
and then it becomes this Obsession where

371
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,560
our whole life is about our blood sugar

372
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:27,600
and we're watching it and we're

373
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,240
monitoring it and we're looking at our

374
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,320
monitors and it's a different there's a

375
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,540
big difference when you're a type 1

376
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,579
diabetic or type 2 diabetic right and

377
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,620
you want to keep an eye on it people

378
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:40,860
shouldn't otherwise people shouldn't

379
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,300
live their life worried about it

380
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,519
athletes shouldn't live their life

381
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,740
worrying about it just people who aren't

382
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,260
athletic shouldn't worry about living

383
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,579
their life worrying about it and in

384
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,260
general in people who are chronically

385
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,180
sick shouldn't worry about it either

386
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,680
there's more important things to worry

387
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,079
about

388
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,699
um Melissa on IG says I haven't had any

389
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,579
blood sugar issues since starting

390
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,860
medical medium foods and that takes me

391
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,480
to the next place is medical medium

392
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,740
information

393
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,139
medical medium Protocols are already

394
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,360
blood sugar supporting

395
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:17,220
they always were like medical medium

396
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,820
Protocols are never like intermittent

397
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:24,180
fast on coffee all day long make sure

398
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,500
you stay on coffee you know make sure

399
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,540
you're

400
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,800
you know just drinking your coffee every

401
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,959
single morning and throughout the

402
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,959
afternoon intermittent fast

403
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,300
and that's it until you eat sometime at

404
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:39,240
some later point of the day there's ways

405
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,540
to do it where you're not eating

406
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,380
a whole bunch of intense heavy food in

407
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,420
the morning

408
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,399
where you can actually keep that away

409
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,139
and you can still take care of yourself

410
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,779
which leads to fats I want to talk about

411
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:55,019
fats if you guys are open to that it

412
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:57,779
plays a an enormous part of the blood

413
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,660
sugar roll is how much fat intake we

414
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:04,199
have how many fats we're consuming that

415
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,180
plays a massive role into in blood sugar

416
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,740
stability so I want to go into that a

417
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:12,440
little bit too so I'm just going to move

418
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,440
this guy over if you guys are okay

419
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,380
and here's the other thing too

420
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,899
intermittent fasting leads to blood

421
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:22,100
sugar crashing that's something to

422
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,100
understand all on its own

423
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,160
foreign

424
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,040
so what you see in front of me right

425
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,560
here are adrenals

426
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,000
and kidneys but you're looking at these

427
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,560
adrenal glands right on top of the

428
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,839
kidneys

429
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,120
now adrenal glands are a critical part

430
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,320
of how we keep blood sugar stable so

431
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,420
when you're doing medical medium

432
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,199
information

433
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:54,600
you're restoring adrenal glands

434
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,120
that includes if you're doing any of the

435
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,480
medical medium cleanses if you're doing

436
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,120
the 369 if you're doing the 369 Advance

437
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,839
if you're doing the monocleens heavy

438
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,839
metal detox whichever it is it's

439
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:12,179
supporting of the adrenals it's why

440
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,240
people are here it's a big part of why

441
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:17,040
people heal and get stronger when

442
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,319
they're doing medical medium protocols

443
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,199
such as the medical medium cleanses the

444
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,720
28 day cleanse is supportive of the

445
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,100
adrenals and there's something that I

446
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,860
hear out there every now and then it's

447
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:32,220
like I'm cleansing too hard

448
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,559
it it's going to be hard on my adrenals

449
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,900
I'm cleansing too hard it's too tough on

450
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,120
my adrenals that's not true

451
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,280
unless you're doing something that's not

452
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,320
a medical medium cleanse maybe you're

453
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,780
doing some other cleanse out there and

454
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,580
then I can't speak for that I can't say

455
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,799
well I don't know if that's hard on your

456
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,960
journals I do know that just

457
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,280
intermittent fasting alone is hard on

458
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,580
the adrenals and this isn't an

459
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,380
intermittent fasting show but I'm saying

460
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,600
that because a lot of people are doing

461
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,299
it and they're burning out their

462
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,700
adrenals while they're doing it and

463
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,500
that's really important to know so when

464
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,360
you're doing like a medical medium 369

465
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,940
or a mono cleanser heavy metal detox

466
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,760
cleanser a 28 day cleanse

467
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,640
a medical Medium you're supporting your

468
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,400
adrenals even while you're cleansing

469
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,940
even why poisons and toxins are leaving

470
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,480
the body it's still supporting your

471
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,880
adrenals not only supporting them

472
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,039
restoring them and bringing them back

473
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,320
but I think what happens there are other

474
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,660
cleanses out there in the world in the

475
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,360
industry Health industry that do hurt

476
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,980
the adrenals and there are other cleanse

477
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,860
cleanses out there and people do them

478
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,320
that actually say oh my adrenals my

479
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,600
adrenaline it's from too much cleansing

480
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,120
but that's not MediCal medium

481
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,400
information or medical medium cleanses

482
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,200
that's a critical piece of information

483
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,140
to understand

484
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,480
now in order to protect the adrenals you

485
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,640
have to have enough mineral salts enough

486
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,280
Trace mineral salts

487
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,260
so that's critical what you'll find on

488
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,419
medical medium cleanses is you'll find

489
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,840
this right here

490
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,940
which is really important to see and you

491
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,400
guys know what this is right here this

492
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,840
is the celery juice

493
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,080
celery juice

494
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,880
is one of the most supportive for the

495
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,320
adrenal glands because of the trace

496
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,960
mineral salts

497
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,700
critical for adrenals

498
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,860
so somebody else's cleansed out there is

499
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,880
not going to have celery juice in it I

500
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,960
don't know what it's going to have in

501
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,260
there maybe it's going to have some

502
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,539
weird Paris parasitical blending send

503
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,039
down and mix with water maybe it's going

504
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,299
to have something else maybe they're

505
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,580
going to say you can still do your

506
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:47,100
coffee maybe they're going to say you

507
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,780
can still do cacao nibs and your you

508
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,220
know your cacao maybe it's going to be

509
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,780
any of that maybe it's they're going to

510
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,740
say you can still do your apple cider

511
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,240
vinegar

512
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,440
and they're going to tell you that's

513
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,140
fine hey do your apple cider vinegar

514
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,320
some cacao nibs right there

515
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,840
some cocoa powder right there

516
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,539
some apple cider vinegar right here

517
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,700
all of those are destructive to the

518
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,260
adrenal glands

519
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,720
highly

520
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,000
injurious to adrenal glands over time

521
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,820
why am I saying this

522
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,620
what does it matter because people are

523
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,120
worried about blood sugar well if you're

524
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,940
really worried about blood sugar then

525
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,700
you might want to know what affects your

526
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,520
blood sugar when adrenal glands weaken

527
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,179
and start to break down when they start

528
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:40,200
to go downhill your adrenals your blood

529
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:44,280
sugar gets crazy unstable it just starts

530
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,700
to go wacko important to know and so

531
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,880
people with their high on their caffeine

532
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:52,020
are high on their drugs right all these

533
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,299
different things they're high on

534
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,940
stimulants they're high on their coffee

535
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,559
all the time

536
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,059
they're high in their chocolate ice

537
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,100
cream let's see if I have chocolate in

538
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,660
here today I got chocolate ice cream

539
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,940
they're high in their chocolate ice

540
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:09,660
cream and their adrenals are taking a

541
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,760
hit boom boom boom boom they're taking a

542
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,080
hit every time you're having that cacao

543
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,520
every time you're having that chocolate

544
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,100
every time you're having your chocolate

545
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,440
this is chocolate coconut ice cream that

546
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:23,160
should be fine I'm just gonna have some

547
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,100

00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,059
milk in it totally different aw you

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,120
don't know what you're talking about

550
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:31,919
that one's safe and really good both

551
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,799
people don't realize it's still gonna

552
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,100
Hammer your adrenals and break them down

553
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,020
over time very important enough

554
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,700
so everybody's being trained to be on

555
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,679
stimulants all the time

556
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,659
it's like I'm on stimulants I'm on a

557
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,059
high I'm trying to chase a high

558
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:52,200
caffeine and stimulants

559
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:54,419
add it to a high fat diet

560
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,940
both of that is really hard because a

561
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,740
high fat diet is stimulating all on its

562
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,940
own so here's what happens when you go

563
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,940
and you eat something like this

564
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,960
when you eat a nice greasy cheeseburger

565
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,900
tastes so good bite into it so yummy

566
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,400
you're biting into that flesh with that

567
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,000
cheese

568
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,820
and it's greasy and delicious and juicy

569
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,400
you get an adrenal High

570
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,600
that's when it hits

571
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,600
when you get your pizza

572
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,320
and it could be a vegan pizza vegan

573
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,200
pizza can be really high in fat totally

574
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,240
jacked up with fat

575
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,120
and when you get all that fat in your

576
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,400
system your adrenals have to thin out

577
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,919
your blood so your adrenals are pumping

578
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,720
to thin out the blood and that's hard on

579
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,419
the adrenals too

580
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,400
so what you'll find is that when you're

581
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,760
doing like a medical medium cleanse and

582
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,539
369 Advanced or the 28 day cleanse

583
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,840
you see that the fats aren't there for a

584
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,919
reason to finally restore your adrenal

585
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,419
glands

586
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,700
but giving you enough calories glucose

587
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:11,520
to help keep you going to keep your

588
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,679
brain going to make you strong keeping

589
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,659
the fats out so you can cleanse poisons

590
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,020
and toxins

591
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:20,940
without getting sicker

592
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,940
and that's really important right there

593
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:27,000
on it so let's go into that a bit

594
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,280
when people are eating too much high fat

595
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,980
your pancreas takes a hip with that

596
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,100
constantly

597
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,620
so not only does your liver take a hit

598
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,740
but your pancreas takes a hit

599
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:43,320
so a lot of people are on high fat diets

600
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,000
and it's hitting their pancreas hard

601
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,620
it's hitting their adrenals hard because

602
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,679
their adrenals are releasing all this

603
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,320
adrenaline to thin out the blood

604
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,500
because you need that adrenaline to move

605
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,539
that fat around and help disperse it

606
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,740
and then the liver's got to release all

607
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:01,559
this bile

608
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,720
and that takes us to like another level

609
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,960
what happens is that

610
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,900
everybody's on the high fat diets

611
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,480
the liver's doing double time their

612
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,320
adrenals are doing double time they're

613
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,700
pancreas is doing double time

614
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,460
all three

615
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,380
and then something's got to give

616
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,440
the A1c

617
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,179
blood sugar instability

618
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,179
hypoglycemia when it's uncalled for

619
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:37,380
hyperglycemia when it's uncalled for

620
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:39,780
blood sugar instability up and down

621
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,820
goes down real fast

622
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,360
goes up real fast

623
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,640
isn't stabilized well you know I saw

624
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,840
this new practitioner and they said you

625
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:54,000
better eat some nuts with your cheese

626
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,460
I saw this other new doctor and this

627
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,520
other new doctor said I better eat like

628
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:03,000
some salmon with berries

629
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,460
I saw this other practitioner

630
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,260
and that practitioner told me that I

631
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,640
should have an apple with peanut butter

632
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,860
on it

633
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,780
it helped to keep the blood sugar stable

634
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,059
another practitioners said I should have

635
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,039
some tofu

636
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:19,200
with some vegetables and that'll keep

637
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,640
the blood sugar going it's like all this

638
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,700
stuff you hear out there and there's a

639
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,320
lot of confusion to food combining with

640
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,279
blood sugar

641
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:33,179
and that's where we run into a mess

642
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:36,240
because if someone sells somebody the

643
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,679
idea that you can monitor your blood

644
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,419
sugar

645
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,580
and food combined around it and watch it

646
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:47,600
and as as if that is going to be a

647
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,600
control for you

648
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,720
then

649
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,700
that's trouble trouble in Paradise all

650
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,000
on its own so I want to cut into that a

651
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,000
little bit

652
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,080
 my husband's doctor just told him

653
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,539
he's headed for diabetes now he is

654
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,760
listening to me about eating better and

655
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:11,700
applying some medical medium tools

656
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,200
incredible congratulations to him I'm

657
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,299
proud of him

658
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,860
and I'm proud of you too see guys I'm

659
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,840
just boiling a little water right here

660
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,340
because I'm going to be cooking pasta in

661
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,260
a little bit I'm going to make make some

662
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,880
stovetop macaroni and cheese which

663
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,880
sounds like not a good thing to eat at

664
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,059
all sounds bad

665
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,640
stovetop macaroni and cheese

666
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,799
Elevate evolve says I'm not perfect with

667
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,080
this information yet but I keep trying

668
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,240
and don't give up I'm continuing to make

669
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,700
progress even though I still struggle

670
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,500
with food addiction I cannot express how

671
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,980
grateful I am proud of you thank you for

672
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,980
being here

673
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,480
one of the three things starts to go

674
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,279
bonkers

675
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,020
whether it's the adrenal glands the

676
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,700
liver or the pancreas

677
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,100
you might be somebody where it's too

678
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,080
adrenal glands and liver another person

679
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,659
it's pancreas and liver another person

680
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,299
it's adrenal glands and pancreas another

681
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:09,799
person it's just the adrenal glands but

682
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:14,820
when they start to go south blood sugar

683
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:17,159
becomes unstable it drops too fast

684
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,559
you get the shakes

685
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,720
it goes up too fast

686
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,620
you get the dizziness

687
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,020
it goes down too fast you get both it

688
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,460
goes all over the place and you go to

689
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,840
this doctor and this doctor and this

690
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,720
doctor see you're not diabetic you're

691
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,820
not a diabetic but

692
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,980
what I recommend is we monitor your

693
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,559
blood sugar all the time and you make

694
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,179
sure that you're doing your cheese

695
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,539
sticks

696
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,340
with some peanut butter an apple

697
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:50,760
we got to make sure that you're doing

698
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,260
just the right Blends or you're eating

699
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,820
one thing here and then one thing here

700
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,559
and a half an hour later one thing here

701
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,940
one thing here it's a guessing game and

702
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,179
that's the confusion but here's what's

703
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,500
amazing about it all

704
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:03,600
what you're going to see now and where

705
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,480
we're heading to in Alternative Health

706
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,100
and Wellness is you're going to see

707
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,539
science

708
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,520
you're going to see

709
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:14,039
science

710
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,620
like check this out

711
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,539
here's how many people did this here's

712
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,640
how many people tried that and it worked

713
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,980
here's how many people did this there

714
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,360
was a study that says this and you're

715
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,279
going to see a lot of that and it's

716
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,320
gonna you're gonna buy into it and in

717
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,900
the end you're just going to be playing

718
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,820
the same old guessing game with your

719
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,980
health and chronic illness

720
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,620
and all that's fine is if you're a

721
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,419
healthy person everything seems okay

722
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,279
and you're doing your exercising you're

723
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,659
working out you're a trainer you're an

724
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,419
athlete or you're somebody that just

725
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:47,279
works out you eat good

726
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:49,440
and you can just play with that you can

727
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,659
play in that land where wow all these

728
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,520
people good results at blood sugar if

729
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:55,799
they try this let's do this monitor here

730
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,299
let's try and all that's great but when

731
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,580
you're chronically sick you're really

732
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,200
sick and you've spent a lot of time on

733
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,720
mattress island or in bed which is

734
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,580
mattress island or couch Island it's an

735
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,140
entirely different story it's back to

736
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,179
the same old drawing board

737
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,820
Lindsay on IG says I used to wear a

738
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:14,820
glucose monitor and had crazy lows and

739
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:17,220
highs of blood sugar and now it's all

740
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,779
normalized and no need to wear a monitor

741
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,779
thanks to Medical medium lifestyle which

742
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:24,960
takes me to the next point

743
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:28,140
mm info allows people

744
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,380

00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,880
it can help protect people and protect

750
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,559
them from falling prey into going

751
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,240
backwards I noticed something right now

752
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,360
in the health movement

753
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,480
is people can come out with a convincing

754
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,460
approach suck a whole people a bunch of

755
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,580
people in through advertisements and ads

756
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,620
and money suck them down a funnel

757
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,539
get them sold on something and now

758
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,779
they're checking the blood sugar every

759
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:13,500
half a freaking hour

760
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:16,380
and you can lose your mind doing it

761
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,480
you can lose your mind you get sold that

762
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,240
it's control

763
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,039
you're going to be achieving for

764
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,520
yourself you're going to be sold that it

765
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:30,480
means that you're in self-control now

766
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:32,640
you are in control of your destiny of

767
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,520
your life of your health you just wear

768
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,679
that blood sugar monitor sign into this

769
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,539
program make sure you look at all the

770
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,020
stats and Things fill out all the stuff

771
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:46,500
they want you to fill out pay a little

772
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:48,720
1999 or 39.99 here uh-huh

773
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,380
and in the end

774
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,240
you're chasing a unicorn

775
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,799
is what you're doing

776
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:02,039
and me I'd rather chase a unicorn

777
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,720
than Chase an apparition

778
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:06,480
of a unicorn

779
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,240
and then find myself in the end just

780
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,799
stuck back into the same old hell they

781
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,539
don't know why I'm sick they don't know

782
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,580
why I'm fatigued they don't know why I

783
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,980
have eczema or psoriasis they don't know

784
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,740
why I'm dizzy blurry eyes aches and

785
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,539
pains my legs feel like sandbags my arms

786
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,059
feel like sandbags I got tingles and

787
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,740
numbness I got vertigo tinnitus all

788
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:28,080
kinds of popping sounds in my ears

789
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,899
infections lung infections I don't feel

790
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,520
good I catch the flu or the sea every

791
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:35,399
single month

792
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:39,179
and most of my time is spent

793
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:42,539
on the couch or in bed and I got sucked

794
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:46,100
into a whole nother scam and

795
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:46,100
that's what happens to people every day

796
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,720
so Michelle says people didn't know how

797
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,100
to get enough calories without fat they

798
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,700
did not

799
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:59,940
mean info put that out there to get

800
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,520
calories enough without all of the fats

801
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,399
yeah so people don't know how to get

802
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,080
enough calories it's true

803
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,880
and if you know medical meme information

804
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,980
you can learn that you can get enough

805
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,440
calories and do it right

806
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,960
so you can sustain yourself and protect

807
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,059
your adrenals but going back to this

808
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,700
very important point one thing I hear

809
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:25,380
every now and then that was kind of

810
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,940
chanted into the medical medium

811
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,240
community

812
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,919
was I'm detoxing too fast it's hard on

813
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,299
my adrenals

814
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,159
no

815
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:38,460
it's not

816
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,260
unless you're doing something

817
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:45,120
that isn't

818
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:49,140
what you should be or could be doing

819
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,559
unless you're doing something that isn't

820
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,020
what you're supposed to be doing

821
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,380
very important to know

822
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,580
it's like it's like literally a zombie

823
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,120
bite

824
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:07,200
a zombie bite I'm detoxing too much it

825
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:10,220
must be hard on my adrenals no

826
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,260
nothing is hard on the adrenals

827
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,059
unless you're doing something to be hard

828
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,260
on your adrenals

829
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,659
that's all

830
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,340
that's all what's hard on your adrenals

831
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:22,440
caffeine are you doing chocolate just

832
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,740
want to know do I have to do fly on the

833
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,740
wall again

834
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:30,360
and usually people are feeling real

835
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,620
symptoms and it's not detox it's real

836
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,500
symptoms

837
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:37,080
I'm sure some people do feel the malaise

838
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,260
of an intense detox if they were really

839
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:44,039
toxic and really sick to begin with but

840
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,779
even then it's not what people think

841
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:49,500
meanwhile so many people are going

842
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:51,840
through fat withdrawal MSC MSG

843
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,760
withdrawal chocolate withdrawal how much

844
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,500
chocolate are you on how much coffee are

845
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,480
you on

846
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,039
how much MSG are you on or you want

847
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,799
nutritional yeast because that stuff

848
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,080
makes you high do you know why people

849
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:06,840
need to pound that stuff

850
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,619
like they need to pound it like I know

851
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,720
people where it's not a teaspoon of

852
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:14,280
nutritional yeast

853
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,060
it's

854
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,040
a court of it like they have to pound it

855
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:23,399
in the recipes it tastes like cheese

856
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,260
it's so good it's it's like the Brewer

857
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,700
Yeast was it's just yummy the

858
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,000
nutritional yeast of Brewer Yeast

859
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:32,820
because of that MSG we get high on it

860
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,280
and boom our neurons are going off and

861
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,440
firing off

862
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,740
and people are so used to being high all

863
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,139
day when you come off of it you feel

864
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:45,359
you really feel it

865
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,580
you aren't High Enough

866
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,980
then you come off

867
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,899
and you feel it you go through a

868
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,080
withdrawal if you were up here all the

869
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,080
time

870
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:56,960
so

871
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,800
we're talking about blood sugar if you

872
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,900
guys just got here we're gonna make a

873
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,760
stovetop macaroni and cheese we're gonna

874
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,160
do that in a few minutes just covering

875
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,260
some blood sugar information let's go

876
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,359
into vinegar and apple cider vinegar so

877
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,220
people believe

878
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:16,320
in the health field that apple cider

879
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,940
vinegar stabilizes blood sugar

880
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,079
and

881
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:26,720
no it doesn't but what

882
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,720
vinegar does apple cider vinegar does

883
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,880
is it destroys the bones

884
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:35,880
it destroys the teeth

885
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,900
it ruins teeth

886
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,780
you do 10 years of apple cider vinegar

887
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:45,480
eventually your teeth will dissolve from

888
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:48,780
the inside out

889
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:54,900
from the inside out

890
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:57,660
I don't know how or in what way or

891
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,180
I don't know if it takes an angel

892
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:03,540
coming out of the sky

893
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:06,740
I don't know if it takes

894
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:09,780
a gigantic squid coming out of the ocean

895
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,040
I don't know and devours a ship I don't

896
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,079
know what it's going to take for people

897
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,420
to stop their vinegar or to learn what

898
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,960
their vinegar does to them I'm doing

899
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:21,960
medical medium and it's hurting me

900
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,740
I'm doing medical medium and I it ruined

901
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:29,160
my health I did medical medium

902
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,020
no what you did was vinegar

903
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,460
you couldn't stay away from it it was

904
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,500
impossible it was in every single

905
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,300
condiment in your refrigerator

906
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,839
it was your apple cider vinegar shots

907
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:43,140
you did lots of chocolate don't say you

908
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,720
didn't do lots of chocolate you ate in

909
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:49,640
restaurants which was loaded with canola

910
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,640
oil and vinegar and MSG

911
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,660
you did your popcorn

912
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,099
you did your high fats because you were

913
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:03,240

914
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:05,160
three weeks in your life if at best if

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,220
at best

916
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,680
and with all that probably ups and downs

917
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:14,460
and challenges and deficiencies you had

918
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,560
long before medical medium information

919
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:22,140
came your way

920
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:25,380
severe severe deficiencies in your life

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,599
old I'm 34

924
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:35,820
now happy to implement

925
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,920
mm protocols

926
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,099
which leads me to this topic I wanted to

927
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,099
say

928
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,839
people can heal

929
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,180
they actually can

930
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,420
it really can

931
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,380
and I don't judge people I don't judge

932
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,680
them for what their

933
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,680
intercepted by

934
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,500
what's happening in health and wellness

935
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:05,400
is not like it was six years ago four

936
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:09,000
years ago eight years ago 15 years ago

937
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,980
it is a smorgasbord of

938
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,060
I'm not saying it because I'm like Mr

939
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,500
Big Man the medical medium's the best

940
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,960
I'm the best

941
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,320
has nothing to do with it

942
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,240
this information comes from above

943
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,579
is where it comes from I'm just a

944
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,079
messenger but it's important for people

945
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,460
to know

946
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,280
that yeah

947
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,680
the environment has changed people get

948
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,780
lost easy out there and they're trying

949
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,119
so many different things it took all

950
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,339
these years

951
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,440
with the fight I had to fight to try to

952
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:45,240
get alcohol out of herbal tinctures did

953
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,060
you guys know this

954
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,339
there's more glycerin tinctures out

955
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,320
there in the world now without alcohol

956
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,160
because of medical movement from the

957
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,060
fight

958
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,060
the fight

959
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,220
even people I won't mention their name

960
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,780
popular so-called popular in the genre

961
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,180
of health and healing

962
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,700
different doctors and stuff like that

963
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,900
pounded people to death with alcoholic

964
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,020
tinctures

965
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,660
just grain alcohol pounded them to death

966
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:18,240
with corn grain alcohol

967
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,920
it took years to get alcohol out of

968
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,079
supplements and it's still in there and

969
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,000
it's still out there but but it's less

970
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,800
than it ever was

971
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,740
but then social happens and

972
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,480
the amount of advertisements and

973
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,240
products that have junk and garbage in

974
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,700
them food products that have junk and

975
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,220
garbage in them it's just no way to keep

976
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,500
things clean out there and I don't judge

977
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,880
people if they turn around and they

978
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,440
leave medical medium for five seconds

979
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,540
they take their attention off and now

980
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,060
they hear some dude say no you actually

981
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,560

982
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,119
it's helpful it's helpful for your

983
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,820
adrenals it's helpful for your heart

984
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,800
it's got antioxidants in it it's so easy

985
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,380
to be brain

986
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,720
so easy and then you're like whoa I love

987
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,280
chocolate I'm gonna be on chocolate

988
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,780
you should do apple cider vinegar

989
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,040
because apple cider vinegar is the real

990
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,540
thing and make sure you do it with

991
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,920
Mother you shouldn't do the other

992
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,599
vinegars but wait a minute medical

993
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,920
medium once told me and I'm forgetting

994
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,140
right now somehow I'm forgetting

995
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,820
something's taking over my brain

996
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,859
I thought medical meme says that apple

997
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,560
cider vinegar actually dissolves your

998
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:24,960
teeth and can actually damage your liver

999
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,640
and actually hurt your health in your

1000
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,260
connective tissue wait I'm forgetting it

1006
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:42,540
sugar

1007
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:45,000
it's easy to get derailed by the amount

1008
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,280
the amount of propaganda that's out

1009
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,440
there both in the vegan land and the

1010
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,820
animal protein land all of it I see

1011
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,980

on plant-based you can do it vegetarian

1019
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,420

1020
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,079
so you can heal people are putting some

1021
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:18,060

[Music]

1053
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:55,460
it's really hard watching people

1054
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,460
become slaves

1055
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:03,480
slaves

1056
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:07,579
the blood sugar scam

1057
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,579
that's happening out there in the world

1058
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,780
I know we want control and we want to

1059
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,599
feel like

1060
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,460
we have full control over our health and

1061
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,780
wellness

1062
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,880
but

1063
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,160
every prediction

1064
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,900
if that's what you want to call it

1065
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,700
every prediction

1066
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,520
that I put out there

1067
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:33,020
comes through over the years comes truth

1068
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,020
one way or another

1069
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:39,359
every

1070
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:42,480
time I say something like carnivore

1071
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,500
people are going to be on honey

1072
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,500
and apples

1073
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,339
they end up on honey and apples

1074
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,339
the plant-based people all go back to

1075
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,200
eggs right when they leave plant-based

1076
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,760
they go back to eggs set it for years

1077
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,400
long before

1078
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:02,400
whatever it is

1079
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:06,180
long C is Epstein-Barr and then it comes

1080
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:09,599
out later that long C is Epstein-Barr

1081
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,040
multiple sclerosis is caused by obscene

1082
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,339
bar infections

1083
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,500
published it first and then years later

1084
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:19,740
science puts it out

1085
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,560
that's the cause of multiple sclerosis

1086
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,540
and these are just a few things

1087
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,800
and I'm telling you now the whole blood

1088
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:28,500
sugar game

1089
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,819
where you got a monitor stuck to you and

1090
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,220
you're playing around with graphs and

1091
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:34,200
charts and you're signing up to stuff

1092
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,280
and you're eating this food in this in

1093
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,599
combination and eating this in

1094
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,640
combination you're looking at your butts

1095
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,280
you're completely getting smoking

1096
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,180
mirrors bait and switch

1097
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,180
is what's happening

1098
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,900
so I'm making the stovetop mac and

1099
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,940
cheese

1100
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,680
and even with me saying all of that I'm

1101
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,359
making macaroni and cheese and you might

1102
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,220
be like that guy's crazy

1103
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:59,060
everything he just told me and he's

1104
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,060
making mac and cheese

1105
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,140
but it's mac and cheese without the bad

1106
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,880
stuff Michelle says my family won't

listen even though I've helped them

1108
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,400
before

1109
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,400
I understand

1110
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,240
so I'm about to

1111
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:18,619

1115
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:38,339
I'm making a fat free

1116
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:40,920
cheese for the macaroni so it's stovetop

1117
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:42,720
macaroni and cheese cheese it's not

1118
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,859
vegan cheese in the sense where you know

1119
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,420
the vegan cheese you can buy in the

1120
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:46,800
store which is loaded with natural

1121
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,440
flavors

1122
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,579
it could be loaded with soy to be loaded

1123
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,560
with all kinds of different things maybe

1124
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,819
it's an almond cheese maybe it's

1125
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,260
something like that but there's always

1126
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:57,839
something in there

1127
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,400
that shouldn't be in there

1128
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,619
and there's always a percentage of

1129
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,060
something bad in there that shouldn't be

1130
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,470
in there either

1131
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,579
now

[Music]

1133
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,599
how do we stabilize our blood sugar like

1134
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:12,300
the true way of stabilizing our blood

1135
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,099
sugar we minimize the fat intake in our

1136
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,260
diet

1137
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:19,740
we lower it

1138
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:22,500
and it all depends on where you're at

1139
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,460
is it your pancreas your adrenals and

1140
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,880
your liver

1141
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:29,220
that are struggling is it just your

1142
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,900
liver is it just your adrenals whatever

1143
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,060
it is that's happening out of those

1144
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,800
three

1145
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:38,099
and most people

1146
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,480
it's liver and adrenals whichever it is

1147
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,940
though

1148
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,619
once you start removing some of the fats

1149
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,079
out of your diet

1150
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,599
eating

1151
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,480
enough calories

1152
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:54,960
that are in the safe Zone

1153
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,420
making sure you're hydrated just enough

1154
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,880
blood sugar problems start to dwindle

1155
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,099
and start to disappear

1156
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,020
it's something that you don't want to

1157
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,700
have to worry about I don't worry about

this little square piece of chocolate

1201
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,800
but to tell myself there's countless

1202
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,300
studies out there I know it there's

1203
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,339
countless studies out there it doesn't

1204
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,079
matter if it makes me feel crazy or if

1205
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:02,940
it makes me start yelling at somebody or

1206
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,740

1207
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,780
I'm crying in a corner or I need another

1208
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:08,099
Square it doesn't matter if I'm addicted

1209
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,160
and I gotta have the chocolate bar

1210
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:12,480
there's countless studies that says this

1211
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,140
chocolate's so good for me I'm just

1212
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,140
gonna have a square

1213
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,800
why the hell are you eating just a

1214
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,300
little square

1215
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,400
why

1216
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,960
you're keeping it back like I'm just

1217
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,180
going to have a square because that

1218
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,520
shit's crazy that's why because you know

1219
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:31,079
it ain't good for you and that's why

1220
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,579
you're eating a square if it was good

1221
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,160
for you you'd be eating two or three

1222
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:40,440
chocolate bars every single day boom

1223
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:43,800
ninety percent cacao 70 cacao whatever

1224
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:46,020
because the stimulant gets you high

1225
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:49,200
and you don't like the way it feels but

1226
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:51,540
there's payback baby there's cause and

1227
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,880
effect when you eat that chocolate what

1228
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,920
goes up must come down and guess what

1229
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:00,000
comes down and guess what gets shot and

1230
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:03,800
guess what gets beat up is your adrenals

1231
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,800
your adrenals

1232
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,099
Trio glands

1233
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:13,200

1234
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,660

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,060

eat that that feels good I feel high I

1242
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,040
remember adrenal glands the studies say

1243
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,319
that there's really good stuff in

1244
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,599
chocolate I know what the study said

1245
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:41,700
about that thing everybody took and I

1246
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,740

1247
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,260
about those drugs they know I know about

1248
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:48,420
that bad study they said where asbestos

1249
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,640
was really good for us and that millions

1250
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,160
of people are dead because asbestos

1251
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,319
cancer I know the studies were they

1252
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:59,359
always say they're right but they say

1253
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:59,359
the cacao study is right

1293
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:38,280
I'm not judging anybody because guess

1294
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,599
what life is hard and it pushes us to do

1295
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,559
things

1296
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:46,140
but don't throw the scientific BS at me

1297
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,819
about what a study is on cacao because

1298
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,339
women know

1299
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:51,300

stuff

1301
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:58,440
for a lot of reasons they know that

1302
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:03,000
stuff will make them sick

1303
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:05,460

1307
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,440

00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,960
ran into me in the street or something

1314
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,880
like that it's like aw

1315
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,819

thing I stopped following you and I

1317
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:38,880

1318
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:42,180
books

1319
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,099
I just didn't like the chocolate talk

00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:54,059
because of it that's not it life's hard

1324
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,980
if chocolate's all you're on and you're

1325
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:58,859
not on something far worse

1326
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,480
that's a miracle all in its own that's

1327
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:02,040
how screwed up this world is if you're

1328
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,880
not drinking a pint of whiskey every

1329
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,940
night

1330
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,559
then you know what exactly

1331
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:10,200
if you're not doing a ton of

1332
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:12,660
cocaine like every night this is amazing

1333
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,099
that's how crazy this world is and

1334
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,180
that's how messed up this world is I'm

1335
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:17,180
gonna pop some pasta in here

1336
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:23,839
but

1337
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,839
I'm just saying

1338
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:29,059
I'm just saying

1339
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,319
the pasta I'm using is on the medical

1340
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:42,800
medium directory

1341
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,800
foreign

1342
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,540
pasta is on the medical medium directory

1343
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:50,220
you know when you're watching Youtube

1344
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,559
and stuff and you see all the ads come

1345
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,119
in and now people are doing is they're

1346
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,319
actually doing their own like ads right

1347
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:56,819
in the middle they're like telling a

1348
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:58,559
story and then all of a sudden it leaves

1349
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:59,700
there and it gets edited and now they're

1350
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,440
like

1351
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:06,180
if you sign up for our 39.99 blah blah

1352
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,859
blah blah and you gotta wait for him to

1353
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:10,040
stop and it's like okay back to the

1354
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:10,040
story

1355
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:21,420
cheese in a little bit too but I just

1356
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:24,359
want to wait just a little bit

1357
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:27,180
before I make that but I am gonna peel

1358
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:29,579
the potatoes you want this to be like

1359
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:31,680
a cheese where you don't want the skins

1360
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:34,020
on the potatoes

1361
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,000
so I'm taking a fork and just taking

1362
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:38,220
this you don't want to like a brown

1363
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,140
cheese this is going to be

1364
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,599
a beautiful

1365
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:48,020
delicious cheese without the nutritional

1366
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:48,020
yeast the MSG without the additives

1367
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:54,920
this beats any vegan cheese out there I

1368
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,920
don't care what anybody says hands down

1369
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:02,400
I mean some of the vegan cheeses are so

1370
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:04,140
bad out there I'm like unless you have

1371
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,000
an issue you're probably better off with

1372
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:09,500
the Cow Cheese

1373
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,500
that's pure

1374
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,800
I mean that's how bad the vegan cheeses

1375
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,619
are I'm just kidding like when someone

1376
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,359
says hey come over aw I'm gonna make a

1377
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:21,240

1441
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:52,380

1446
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:06,000
this is a wheat pasta with high in

1447
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,440
gluten I'm kidding I'm kidding someone's

1448
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,940
gonna take that and they're gonna edit

1449
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,520
it

1450
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:13,619
I'm kidding this is actually a

1451
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,059
gluten-free pasta

1452
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:18,380
so it's really good

1453
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:18,380
so let's go into it a little bit

1454
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,339
Lauren says what if your nutritional

1455
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:28,619
yeast doesn't have MSG

1456
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:31,799
that's the problem

1457
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:35,160
I'm really glad you said that

1458
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:37,799
really glad listen to my podcast about

1459
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:41,940
nutritional yeast

1460
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:44,579
there is no nutritional yeast that

1461
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,799
doesn't have MSG

1462
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:51,240
there is no

1463
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:54,119
nutritional yeast that doesn't have MSG

1464
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:57,559
there's no apple cider vinegar

1465
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:57,559
that doesn't kill your liver

1466
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:03,119
burnout

1467
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:05,579
your stomach lands in your stomach and

1468
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:08,160
kill your HCL

1469
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:10,680
and dissolve your bones and teeth there

1470
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:13,460
is no apple cider vinegar that does not

1471
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,460
do that

1472
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,099
you guys know what happened

1473
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:23,520
do you remember

1474
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:26,700
when conventional wisdom

1475
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,200
and conventional Medical Science said it

1476
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:32,579
is safe

1477
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:36,000
to breathe in asbestos it is safe

1478
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:37,619
to have lead in gasoline it is safe to

1479
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,819
smoke

1480
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:45,240
it is safe to have lead in paint chips

1481
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:47,280
it is safe to take a thousand drugs that

1482
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,079
they took off the market

1483
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,940
because they had to pull them from the

1484
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:53,640
market because they weren't safe

1485
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:56,940
are you forgetting that whole thing that

1486
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,220
happened because in alternative medicine

1487
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:02,160
they're doing the same thing

1488
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,660
chocolate's good for you

1489
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,040
and maybe if you're not chronically sick

1490
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,380
and you want to play with a little bit

1491
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,760
of chocolate so be it

1492
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,260
but if you're somebody that's really

1493
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,700
struggling with a chronic illness that's

1494
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,319
what I'm talking about I'm talking about

1495
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:16,079
like death by a Thousand Cuts remember

1496
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:18,119
I'm talking about like what chips away

1497
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,599
at you when you're already struggling

1498
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:20,599
and sick

1499
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:29,280
alternative medicine in Wellness Health

1500
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:32,700
and Wellness has made it

1501
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:35,359
that's good that's dumb has made it

1502
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:38,040
so that

1503
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:40,339
they tell you everything is good and it

1504
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,339
isn't

1505
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,200
I've never been the food police

1506
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,460
I need a place to put this pot

1507
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,359

1508
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:06,720

1509
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:09,500
I am just getting some macaroni here

1510
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,500
in a bowl

1511
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,660
and I'm gonna actually make some cheese

1512
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:17,640
now

1513
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:20,579
I'm not the food police when my friends

1514
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:23,220
or family come over I will make them

1515
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:26,040
anything they want

1516
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:29,099
if that means I have to go to the store

1517
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:33,359
and pick up something

1518
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:37,020
that's on the medical medium warning

1519
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:38,940
warning don't eat if you're sick

1520
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,460
even if it's something like that I'll go

1521
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:43,980
pick it up if I got company over and

1522
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,480

1527
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,359
find it

1528
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,299

1529
01:02:55,799 --> 01:02:59,700
medical medium house and it's like no

you only eat with the medical medium

1531
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,540
actually you'll need this celery juice

1532
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:07,220
you're just gonna drink celery juice

1533
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,220
here and that's all you're gonna have

1534
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,500
[Music]

1535
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,500
right

1536
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:15,660
okay

1537
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:19,339
so what I'm gonna do is pop these

1538
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,339
potatoes in the food processor

1539
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,260
I'm not the food police one of my

1540
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:28,500
friends or family come over I don't tell

1541
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,880
them what they should eat I'll prepare

1542
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,700
them something

1543
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:34,079
anything they want

1544
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:36,119
and

1545
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,859
I'll tell them about options and stuff

1546
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:39,720
to heal or

1547
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:41,760
tell them about some good stuff they can

1548
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,359
have

1549
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,359
all right

1550
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:49,520
I'm gonna get these potatoes in here I'm

1551
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:49,520
gonna cut them in pieces

1552
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:56,359
so I'm just gonna actually break them

1553
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,359
down a little bit

1554
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:10,760
foreign

1555
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:16,740
but if you're really sick

1556
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:18,960
and you want to go as far as you can

1557
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:22,160
with your healing process you want to go

1558
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,160
as far as it needs to take

1559
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,579
but if you're a guest in my house

1560
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:31,079
and you

1561
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:34,079
are there

1562
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:34,079
yeah

1563
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:39,059
I want to make sure I'm a good Hoster

1564
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,619
all right so I got some potatoes in here

1565
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:42,420
for my cheese

1566
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:43,500
and I'm gonna put some carrots in here

1567
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,380
as well

1568
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:49,920
steamed carrots

1569
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:53,040
I'm going to add some water to this

1570
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,599
I'm going to do some

1571
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:58,099
um onion powder I'm going to do about

1572
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:58,099
two tablespoons of onion powder

1573
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:04,460
you want a decent amount of onion powder

1574
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,460
in here

1575
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,099
okay

1576
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:10,880
I'm gonna put a little bit of garlic

1577
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:10,880
powder in here too

1578
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:16,700
there we go a little bit of purple

1579
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,119
yeah and we're gonna put a little bit of

1580
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,119
dried oregano in here too

1581
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,760
it's gonna be really good

1582
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,760
a little bit of turmeric

1583
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:38,880
which will probably add to obviously the

1584
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,559
cheese color there's no soy in here just

1585
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,520
so you know there's no soy in here at

1586
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,200
all

1587
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,740
I'm gonna add some lemon juice fresh

1588
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,740
lemon juice

1589
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,599
a little strainer here

1590
01:05:55,619 --> 01:06:01,440
what about I got a just a large amount

1591
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:04,500
of pasta I made and made basically two

1592
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,540
boxes of pasta

1593
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:09,559
so it's gonna take

1594
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:09,559
more than really

1595
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,640
a small amount of lemon but

1596
01:06:14,339 --> 01:06:17,599
I put a little bit more in here

1597
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:22,980
a little strainer here

1598
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,599
add a little bit of water to

1599
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,319
two thirds of a cup

1600
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:27,319
should do it

1601
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:34,400
the lemon helps to give it this zesty

1602
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:34,400
good flavor

1603
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:38,180
you can add salt

1604
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:43,500
if you like

1605
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:45,539
I have some some family coming over and

1606
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,460
I think they're gonna have this dish

1607
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:50,180
so I might have to put a little bit of

1608
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,180
salt in here

1609
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,299
there's people that can't live without

1610
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,940
salt they can't live without the flavor

1611
01:07:00,299 --> 01:07:05,520
the taste of salt like they won't eat

1612
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:07,140
their food they just won't if it's

1613
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,400
missing

1614
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:11,280
okay

1615
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,760
put the lemon juice in here

1616
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,760
okay

1617
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:23,160
let me try this you guys okay with this

1618
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:24,720
see what happens

1619
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,039
all right

1620
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,119
let's get a lid on it and put a little

1621
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:29,579
water

1622
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,079
in there as well

1623
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:34,380
start with that I'm going to add some

1624
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:37,799
more if I need to kind of like add

1625
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:40,740
and I'm gonna need a wire

1626
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:43,520
it's my favorite thing to do

1627
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,520
boom

1628
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:59,000
a little bit more

1629
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,020
and there we go

1630
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:25,020
you can do this in a blender

1631
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,359
but you usually in blenders you've got

1632
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:28,560
to add a little bit more water and I

1633
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,420
don't want

1634
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,900
a really

1635
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,900
like

1636
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,699
it's coming out really good

1637
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:57,980

and I get my nails done but so I can't

1655
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:55,880
be bothered with cleaning I do the

1656
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,880
cleaning I do the cleaning

1657
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:05,179
I break my butt and clean up the mess

1658
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:05,179
I made the mess I will clean it

1659
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:11,160
so that's the cheese right there now

1660
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:15,080
this is the creamy cheese

1661
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:15,080
putting some on just like that

1662
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:21,600
amazing amazing so I'm just gonna get

1663
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:25,760
the cheese to get in here a little bit

1664
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,760
I'm gonna add some more I like it creamy

1665
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:30,260
there we go

1666
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:43,940
now I'm just mixing it in a little bit

1667
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:43,940
here

1668
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:57,560
laughs

1669
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,560
it's piping hot so it's actually

1670
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,900
and I might even with the rest of this I

1671
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:07,159
might even add a bunch more

1672
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,159
into this one

1673
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:20,760
the rest of it

1674
01:11:16,219 --> 01:11:24,239
no Dairy no fat no butter no oil

1675
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:27,679
there's no oil in here this is non-dairy

1676
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:27,679
no soy

1677
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,100
no vegan cheese that's filled with

1678
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:34,360
natural flavors and everything else

1679
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:37,520
that's terrible none of that either

1680
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,520
[Music]

1681
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,060
this cheese is the good part I don't

1682
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:50,820
want to waste it I want every bit of it

1683
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:54,380
in here because this is really how this

1684
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:54,380
becomes so good

1685
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,440
amazing

1686
01:11:59,179 --> 01:12:03,140
gotta give it some mix time

1687
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:11,940
now you gotta think this is a dairy-free

1688
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:14,900
mac and cheese

1689
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,900
is what it is

1690
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,699
now you can go one step past this if you

1691
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:24,420
would like

1692
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:26,580
you can put this in a baking dish

1693
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:29,100
set the oven for

1694
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:32,219
um 350.

1695
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:33,960
set the oven for 375 and you can put

1696
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:35,940
this in a baking dish and you can make

1697
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,219
baked mac and cheese you know how you do

1698
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:40,640
that work and then you actually put it

1699
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:40,640
right in

1700
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,159
foreign

1701
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,980
cheese right there

1702
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,679
I mean

1703
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,300
you can definitely do an oven where

1704
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:13,159
you've just toast the top if you really

1705
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:13,159
wanted to which is incredible

1706
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:23,659
but there it is

1707
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,420
incredible that's the stovetop macaroni

1708
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:29,580
and cheese you guys we talked about

1709
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:31,500
blood sugar

1710
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:33,120
talked about stabilizing blood sugar now

1711
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,500
one of the things that happens a big

1712
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,120
mistake that people make with blood

1713
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,520
sugar

1714
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,719
is they're in a vicious cycle and I

1715
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,640
wanted to cover this because this is the

1716
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:45,000
part I actually didn't cover yet so it's

1717
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,739
important they're in a vicious cycle of

1718
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,719
insulin resistance

1719
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:51,120
where they have to eat the thing that

1720
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,800
doesn't help them but it yet it feels

1721
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:56,280
like it helps them

1722
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:58,380
in order to stabilize their blood sugar

1723
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,640
so if someone gets the shakes or they

1724
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,739
get the low blood sugar or the

1725
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,480
hypoglycemia whatever it is that they're

1726
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:05,940
you know that they're dealing with or

1727
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:09,540
they're monitoring their blood sugar

1728
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:11,940
but they're told to eat things to

1729
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:13,440
stabilize their blood sugar when in turn

1730
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:16,320
it doesn't stabilize their blood sugar

1731
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,760
but yet it feels like it does

1732
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,260
so it's like whoa I have to eat

1733
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,580
something right now I'm having a blood

1734
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:22,440
sugar low I'm having a blood sugar

1735
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:24,480
problem and then they go and eat some

1736
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,560
hummus and I'm saying hummus is terrible

1737
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:28,080
or anything

1738
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,699
but because of all the tahini or the oil

1739
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,980
in the hummus

1740
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:33,600
they feel like whoa that just stabilized

1741
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:35,940
me and they just had a bunch of fat and

1742
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,820
that just stabilized me

1743
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:41,340
and but yet that's not the answer to

1744
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:43,080
fixing a blood sugar problem

1745
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:45,000
regardless

1746
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,380
I need some chips a lot of people do

1747
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,940
this thing like just need a few chips

1748
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:50,219
they open up a bag of chips it could be

1749
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,480
like a healthier bag of chips in the

1750
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:53,100
natural food store

1751
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,540
and they go and they open a healthy bag

1752
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:57,060
of chips and they eat like three or four

1753
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:58,679
chips and they get stabilized right and

1754
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,300
they think whoa I'm stabilizing my blood

1755
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:02,280
sugar or they eat a handful of nuts or

1756
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:04,140
half a bag of nuts and they're like I'm

1757
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,120
stabilizing my blood sugar

1758
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,860
or they have some bacon

1759
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,540
and they're like whoa I'm stabilizing my

1760
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:11,460
blood sugar but it's a catch-22 because

1761
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:13,380
here you're having blood sugar problems

1762
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:15,060
and then you're using things that put

1763
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:17,219
you into a vicious cycle where the

1764
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:18,540
problem will never be fixed and it'll

1765
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:20,580
just keep going and going and going

1766
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:23,400
because you don't fix the actual root

1767
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:27,060
problem Rose Jackson said the absolute

1768
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:29,940
disrespect and slander we receive from

1769
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:33,000
everyone when we speak about your info

1770
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:35,820
as though we are in the wrong because

1771
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:40,199
it's not science

1772
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:43,020
yeah I know I know you guys bear it you

1773
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:45,360
bear it well man and I'm honored to be

1774
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:48,600
in this with you truly

1775
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:50,460
takes a special soul to see through the

1776
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,159
smoke

1777
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:54,840
to understand what this is and what the

1778
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:56,280
information is in the medical medium

1779
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,140
book series

1780
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,300
to understand what's in in the podcast

1781
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:02,100
the medical Ian podcast

1782
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:04,199
it takes a special soul to understand

1783
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:08,960
that

1784
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:08,960
and to see it and see through everything

1785
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:14,520
and then you know to hear crap from

1786
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:16,640
people out there in a world that's sick

1787
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,380
right like they got all the answers

1788
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:21,960
stovetop mac and cheese right here

1789
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:25,260
that's the recipe

1790
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:27,360
it's in the brain saver protocols

1791
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:30,179
check the book out if you'd like

1792
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,040
all right you guys

1793
01:16:30,179 --> 01:16:35,219
covered some blood sugar information

1794
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:37,260
blood sugar talk quick rundown right now

1795
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:39,000
that just keep in mind that any of the

1796
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:42,600
cleanses in the medical medium books is

1797
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,120
supportive of blood sugar problems

1798
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:47,520
critical to know anybody who's actually

1799
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,659
worried about their blood sugar numbers

1800
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,420
if you're dealing with blood sugar

1801
01:16:48,659 --> 01:16:53,219
issues it's good to know why

1802

we have problems with our blood sugar

1803
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:58,380
and it's good to know how to address it

1804
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:59,820
and to beat it over time

1805
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,980
and

1806
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:05,340

1807
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:09,120
time and restore and cleanse your liver
