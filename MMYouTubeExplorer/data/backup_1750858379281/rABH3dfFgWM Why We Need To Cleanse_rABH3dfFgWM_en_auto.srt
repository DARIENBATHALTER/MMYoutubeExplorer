it's free

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,520
good to see you guys coming on here i'm

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,559
excited about this i'm gonna talk about

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,000
why

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,039
you have to cleanse why it's important

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,440
if you hear someone say the body

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,039
cleanses itself

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,719
they're wrong

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
they're wrong

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,760
i mean

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,559
the body does not cleanse itself

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,359
we

31
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,480
get

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,239
sick

33
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,920
and we die

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,840
that's how it works on planet earth

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,119
that's how it works okay

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,240
do you want to get sick early

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,240
and die early

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,439
or do you want to get

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,320
sick

40
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,799
way at the end

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,479
and die later that's a better option

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,320
right because everybody dies and

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,320
everybody dies and they get sick right

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,479
everybody gets sick sometime and

45
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,400
whatever that's the way the world works

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,840
right now okay because the world is too

47
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,560
polluted

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,600
it's too problematic

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,280
there's too many traps there's too much

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,680
junk in the way

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,399
and it's rigged like that so we die

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
early that's how the world is rigged

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,720
right

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,040
the

55
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,799
evil doers

56
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,479
on the planet

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,320
want people

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,399
gone

59
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,040
that's what they want right

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,960
so there's all these ways they do it

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
there's all these traps set for

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,479
everybody so if you hear some dietitian

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
some nutritionist some functional

64
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,840
medicine doctors some health some health

65
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,680
food advocate somebody whatever some

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
health coach whatever some nutritionists

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
whatever it is if you hear them say in

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,440
an article or you hear them saying

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
social media somewhere else the body

70
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,080
cleanses itself you don't need to drink

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
celery juice medical medium's wrong you

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,280
just eat the stick oh you just have

73
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,879
fruits and vegetables and that's the

74
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
good thing to do

75
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,080
if they're saying that

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,920
they're oblivious to how the world works

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,959
they're oblivious to what's really

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,360
happening

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,280
they're oblivious to any of it they're

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,959
ignorant to all of it

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
they don't know what's happening they

82
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,599
don't know what's being dumped on us

83
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,720
they don't know what's happening they

84
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,920
don't know what's in our water they

85
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
don't know what's in our food they don't

86
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,120
know anything

87
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,680
and then what's worse they don't know

88
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,760
anything about the human body because

89
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,480
your liver is this filter and it

90
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,040
contains all that junk and it holds on

91
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,040
to it and then it gets sick

92
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,959
and then it gets sick and our body gets

93
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,319
sick so if you guys just came on here

car windows cracked and all that

275
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,399
vaping's coming out the window like this

276
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,399
and it's getting sucked into your car

277
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,440
yeah you're breathing in little bits of

278
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,959
it everywhere so basically you're just

279
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,680
this filter bringing in all the toxins

280
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,519
and the poisons every single day it's

281
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,120
coming out of the walls in our houses

282
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,720
it's coming out of the sofas it's coming

283
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,200

297
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,000
it's a slam on medical medium or slam on

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,839

we got some options on planet earth

405
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,199
we could cleanse

406
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
try to control it detox

407
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,079
right

408
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,120
keep the real true balance going

409
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,000
where we're getting more out of us

410
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,000
than what toxic crap is coming in us

411
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,800
more toxic stuff coming out of us

412
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,959
than what's coming in it's like the boat

413
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,639
man it's like the boat you're sitting in

414
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,160
that little boat

415
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
and the water's coming in because

416
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
there's a hole in that boat and you got

417
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,079
a bucket and that water's coming in

418
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,000
quick and you're scooping the water out

419
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,360
as the water is coming in right that's

420
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,760
what you're doing

421
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,000
okay you gotta scoop the water out

422
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,920
faster than the water coming into the

423
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
boat that's going to sink your ass

424
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,839
that's the whole point so you don't get

425
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,199
sunk and go down

426
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,880
and drown

427
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,959
and so what we got to do is when we're

428
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,920
cleansing is we're getting the toxins

429
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,199
out faster than they are coming in

430
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,399

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,480
your lymphatic system

560
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,360
only becomes a problem because of your

561
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,679
liver has already gotten there first

562
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,080
your liver has already gotten sick first

563
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,480
for the lymphatic system to get sick

564
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,480
later

565
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,400
if you're working on the lymphatic

566
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,840
system but not working on the liver then

567
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,360
you're not working on the root cause of

568
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,160
the root problem that's what's happening

569
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,559
your liver gets stagnant and sluggish

570
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,559
first

571
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,320
and

572
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,480
your lymphatic system is the dump ground

573
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,720
it's like the dumping ground for a liver

574
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,480
that's already pushed over the edge it's

575
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,799
already so polluted it's already sick

576
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,480
and so the lymphatic system if we got

577
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,840
the we got our eyes on the lymphatic

578
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,200
system all the time but we don't have

579
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,960
our eyes on everything else we don't

580
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,799
have our eyes on all the bugs that are

581
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,400
inside our liver we don't have the our

582
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,799
eyes on the epstein bar that's inside

583
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,480
our liver we don't have our eyes on any

584
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,000
of that we don't have our eyes on all

585
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,840
the toxic heavy metals and the

586
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
pollutants and the chemicals if we don't

587
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,600
have our eyes on all that you know

588
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,720
aluminum and everything else and mercury

589
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,880
and copper if we don't have our eyes on

590
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,960
everything that's saturating inside your

591
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,559
liver and making it sick and stagnant

592
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,480
and sluggish and instead we're just

593
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,120
doing topical stuff

594
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,280
like oh my lymphatic system that's

595
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,280
that's where the problem is really okay

596
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,640
oh i took this lymphatic system tonic

597
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,320
here to help me that somebody

598
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,799
recommended it's like oh my god you're

599
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,600
so far off and guess what 20 30 years

600
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,760
from now you're gonna be so sick

601
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,000
and so lost

602
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,000
and like i said on here on planet earth

603
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,440
that's how it rolls everybody has a

604
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,159
symptom i don't know if you guys know

605
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,760
this yet kids included all have symptoms

606
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,840
all have problems it's only getting

607
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,760
worse out there because the world's

608
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,400
getting more polluted and more shady

609
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,240
than ever in all kind of sinister ways

610
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,159
and if we don't do something about it

611
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
and empower ourselves and stay strong

612
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,880
then how are we going to battle it and

613
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,880
how we're going to recover and heal

614
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,679
how are we going to do it

615
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,159
so if you hear right

616
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,919
do you hear you don't need to cleanse

617
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,840
somebody that just doesn't understand

618
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,360
health

619
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,720
now i know that there's some bad

620
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,280
cleanses throughout the years that have

621
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,200
given people about the given people a

622
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,400
bad ride and have given

623
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,320
cleansing a bad name

624
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,480
i've never supported any of those

625
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,440
cleanses ever

626
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,840
i've never supported just shoving water

627
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,400
and cayenne pepper and oil in a drink

628
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,679
and then sent it down all day and all

629
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,080
night i've never never supported any

630
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,240
ridiculous

631
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,559
problematic cleanse that was ever

632
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,720
offered out there the medical medium

633
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,559
information's different it's about the

634
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
chronically ill and recovering it's

635
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,240
about recovering sensitive people you

636
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,400
guys it's about

637
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,400
people who are sensitive because they've

638
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,240
been injured with their health along the

639
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,880
way they've been chronically sick for

640
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,120
many many years the cleansing that we're

641
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,120
talking about is an entirely different

642
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,200
ballpark and it gets people better and

643
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,600
it's so important jennifer said i've

644
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,240
been doing the morning cleanse and or

645
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,640
doing mono cleanses awesomes right from

646
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,200
this book here and pretty much cured my

647
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,200
fibromyalgia in six months

648
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,760
incredible i'm amazed anthony you've

649
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,760
definitely got the right information and

650
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,200
fibromyalgia if you read and cleanse the

651
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,799
heal and jennifer you probably know this

652
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
right is the epstein bar so that's

653
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,000
that's the epstein bar causing that

654
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,600
nerve inflammation causing all that

655
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,679
fibromyalgia and what you did was you

656
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,000
did these cleanses you did the mono

657
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,080
cleanse and you starved out the epstein

658
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,640
bar so what you did is you starved out

659
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,919
and killed off the epstein-barr that's

660
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,240
amazing and

661
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,640
that's actually really incredible i'm

662
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,080
really proud of you seriously

663
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,880

from hashimoto's you destroyed your

691
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,360
epstein-barr that causes hashimoto's

692
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,640
thyroiditis which is

693
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,240
medical meme information now that

694
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,400
science is trying to steal all the mm

695
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,799
info about epstein-barr from me years

696
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,880
later that's on facebook katie fantastic

697
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,840
but you killed off your epstein bar you

698
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,120
knocked it back you restored your

699
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,880
thyroid mm info i'm really really proud

700
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,559

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,640
so proud of you

702
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,000
big time big time

703
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
you guys i'm a little more pumped up

704
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,320
today if you notice

705
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,080
um

706
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,320
one reason is because we're going into a

707
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,000
cleanse tomorrow okay we're going to do

708
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,159
a cleanse i've been excited about this

709
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,400
because i've been wanting to get to this

710
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,000
point with everything to get you know to

711
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,840
get to where we need to and i think

712
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,279
right now it's winter in a lot of places

713
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,640
right we're in the united states it's

714
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,799
winter

715
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,919
in the us right now okay

716
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,279
you know on the other side of the world

717
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,200
it's not winter but it's winter right

718
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,159
now in the u.s and

719
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,240
um

720
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,480
and also in other places too around the

721
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,799
world too it's winter so it's kind of a

722
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,840
great place to get some of these toxins

723
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,679
and poison so they don't incubate

724
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,080
they don't incubate

725
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,159
and that's what happens when we go into

726
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,320
this like kind of like hibernation we

727
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,480
end up not eating so good either and we

728
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,880
end up really compacting the poisons and

729
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,679
toxins into our

730
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,640
liver we end up compacting it into our

731
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,880
cells right and those toxins and poisons

732
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
get they just get stuck in there is what

733
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,640
they do they get stuck in the cells of

734
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,640
the organs that's what happens right

735
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,559
there and so

736
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,360
cleansing

737
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,480
right

738
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,480
cleansing

739
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,919
gets those poisons out so we're not

740
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,360
stagnant

741
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,520
so if you're looking at that snow

not tomorrow morning

870
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,279
by the way eggs aren't a healthy fat

871
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,159
they are not a healthy fat

872
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,960
almond butter's a healthy fat

873
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,520
right

874
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,520
cacao is not a healthy fat because it

875
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,760
destroys your adrenals and it ages you

876
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,679
quick and then boom you get aged much

877
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,440
quicker than you should because the

878
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,520
stuff just destroys your adrenals but

879
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,039
that's another story don't get mad about

880
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,799
the cacao if you guys like chocolate

881
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,000
fine i'm you can have chocolate if

882
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,000
that's what you like whatever what i'm

883
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,080
just saying

884
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,679
this is not a healthy fat eggs aren't a

885
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,600
healthy fat but almond butter is a

886
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,640
healthy fat tahini is a healthy fat

887
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,640
right almonds cashews are a healthy fat

888
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,600
coconut oil is a healthy fat olive oil

889
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,640

890
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,120
so hemp seeds are a healthy fat pumpkin

891
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,799
seeds are a healthy fat even sunflower

892
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,159
seeds are a healthy fat because i know

893
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,919

sunflower oil

897
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,559
sunflower seeds are a healthy fat

898
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,320
compared to pork fat

899
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,039

they look healthy

1018
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,119
they're young

1019
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,119
but it's a snapshot in time

1020
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,280
do you ever see those old photos of like

1021
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,680
people in black and white

1022
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,280
in the 1930s they all look like they're

1023
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,880
all standing together and they all look

1024
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,280
miserable and it's kind of spooky and

1025
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,280
it's just a bunch of people like

1026
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,160
like you know it's a husband and a wife

1027
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,599
a couple of kids and aunt and uncle

1028
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,680
couple nephews whatever and they're all

1029
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,599
grouped together and it's 1932 or it's

1030
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,839
1928 or it's 1919

1031
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,400
and you see that photo

1032
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,359
it's a snapshot in time

1033
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,280
but what you don't see is what happened

1034
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,640
to them all along the way

1035
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,119
you don't see

1036
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,880
what tumor grew in one of them

1037
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,960

1038
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,440
okay would chronic illness are

1039
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,359
neurological disorder overcame one of

1040
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,560
them you don't see what stroke happened

1041
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,839
in them

1042
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,800
as the years went by you don't see the

1043
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,280
struggle and the suffering

1044
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,920
okay as

1045
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,599
they battled whatever it was that came

1046
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,720
their way

1047
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,720
or a snapshot in time when a dietitian

1049
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,720

don't need to cleanse and they're

1051
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,200
sitting there they're just a snapshot in

1052
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,040
time because what's going to happen is

1053
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,040
10 years from now i'd like to see that

1054

go by it happens and people all get sick

1065
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,240

it's what it is

1067
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,320
charlenski says for the lemon water do

1068
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,480
you just cut lemons and put it in the

1069
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,599
water you could do that

1070
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,599
that's okay

1071
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,880
i'll show you how i do it too but you

1072
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,800
can definitely do that so i'm going to

1073
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,400
take this cup right here

1074
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,400
and i'll give you a quick run down this

1075
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,240
is just so you're ready for tomorrow so

1076
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,920
i'm going to cut this lemon in half and

1077
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,119
the details are in the cleanse the heel

1078
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,200
book so you're going to want i want to

1079
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,200
get the cleanse the heel book one way of

1080
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,280
doing it is just squeezing that half

1081
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,599
right in here like that

1082
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,079
and adding water that's one way to do it

1083
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,320
take a half squeeze it in and add water

1084
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,000
you want 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water

1085
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,720
on an empty stomach first thing in the

1086
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,400
morning because you want to flush

1087
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,079
you want to flush

1088
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,720
that liver

1089
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,240
you flush the liver and the lymphatic

1090
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,839
system starts to clean up

1091
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,280
you want to go after the lymphatic

1092
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,880
system with different things then you're

1093
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,640
going to miss out on the liver you want

1094
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,079
to get the liver that's where it's at

1095
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,920
right

1096
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,599
so you want to flush that liver in the

1097
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,280
morning so that's the lemon water right

1098
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,280
there

1099
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,839
so that's so i just want you prepared i

1100
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,680
want you ready for this

1101
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,280
someone says you don't need to cleanse

1102
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,960
they're a snapshot in time you don't

1103
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,079
know what's going to happen to them 10

1104
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,440
years from now you don't know what's

1105
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,640
going to happen to them 20 years from

1106
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,480
now

1107
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,960
and guess what they won't be held

1108
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,040
accountable for what they said 10 years

1109
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,839
or 20 years before and deterred a bunch

1110
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,520
of people into healing

1111
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,920
so

1112
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,680
they won't be held accountable doesn't

1113
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,040
matter if they stroke out 15 years from

1114
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,560
now does it matter if they take a

1115
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,000
medical treatment that finishes their

1116
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,079
life it doesn't matter if something else

1117
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,640
happens to them doesn't matter if

1118
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,720
whatever that does it

1119
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,520
they won't be held accountable for what

1120
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,480
they said 15 years before when they told

1121
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,800
5000 people or 100 000 people you don't

1122
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,760
need a cleanse

1123
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,640
michaela says my teeth became sensitive

1124
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,520
to lemons and acid fruit in them

1125
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,599
in the month why can be

1126
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,160
so it's not the lemons it's not the acid

1127
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,960
fruit those are just letting you know

1128
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,560
something else is happening so so that's

1129
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,200
what that is

1130
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,359
so lemons and things like that that make

1131
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,000
you feel sensitive one thing is is it

1132
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,760
cold anything cold another thing too is

1133
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,720
nothing else makes you sensitive be your

1134
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,720
own detective so kind of like chart

1135
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,200
everything like what else kind of sets

1136
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,960
you off a little bit too right but what

1137
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,560
that means is it's not the lemon that

1138
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,920
causes the problem it's the lemon

1139
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,599
showcasing that you already have a

1140
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,240
sensitive nerve developing from

1141
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,720
something else from some other situation

1142
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,400
and so sensitive nerves trigeminal

1143
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,160
nerves facial nerves all these nerves

1144
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,720
that are actually all intertwined to our

1145
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,040
mouth or draw everything right cranial

1146
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,359
nerves that go through our mouth and jaw

1147
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,359
something's already happening there

1148
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,280
and lemon water is helpful for that

1149
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,800
situation even though it's setting off

1150
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,119
an alarm bell so that's how that works

1151
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,560
did you if you want to know

1152
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,480
what's going on with your health i mean

all these things that causes all the

1155
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,640
problems right and that's important to

1156
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,240
know sandra says lemon tastes like eggs

1157
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,160
to me

1158
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:57,200
i hope you like the taste of eggs

1159
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,359
because lemon's so good for you

1160
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,760
tomorrow morning

1161
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,880
we're going to be doing lemon water

1162
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,800
we're going to be doing the celery juice

1163
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,319
okay

1164
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,680
we're going to talk about what foods you

1165
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,520
can eat

1166
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,720
right

1167
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,599
i'm going to juice some celery right now

1168
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,599
so i'm going to do that

1169
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,200
and

1170
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,599
you're going to do the celery juice

1171
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:29,119
16 to 32 ounces try to get 32 ounces in

1172
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,440
if you can if you can't get 32 ounces in

1173
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,680
you can't get 32 ounces in

1174
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:38,160
try to get 16 ounces in if you can't get

1175
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,160
32 ounces in so that's important to know

1176
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,040
if you guys just came on here this is

1177
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,880
the mm-900 hds it's on sale right now

1178
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,760
for two more days

1179
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,760
it's not just the juicer

1180
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,800
the reason why i endorse this model is

1181
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,640
because it saves you money

1182
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,960
and it doesn't have the metal gears

1183
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,359
grinding against each other

1184
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,440
so you get metal particles with all the

1185
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,040
other juicers

1186
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,200
so that's important

1187
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,599
the pulp comes out dry

1188
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,760
it comes out drier than other machines

1189
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,000
so you save that much more money when

1190
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,680
you're buying your celery

1191
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,839
okay

1192
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,839
that's important to know right there

1193
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,800
if you have a chronic condition

1194
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,440
this is one of the powerful tools to

1195
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,560
reversing it over time

1196
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:37,040
juicing celery is one of the powerful

1197
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,760
tools this is a medical device

1304
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,920
people are asking me all the time what

1305
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,839
juicer is the best this one's the best

1306
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,079
because it's squeezing out all the juice

1307
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,560
and it's saving you money and right now

1308
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,400
food costs going up

1309
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,920
because the world is definitely a dark

1310
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,480
place so they're gonna make sure they

1311
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,000
jack up the food costs and the food

1312
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,480
costs are going to go up people have a

1313
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,160
hard time getting healthy

1314
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,240
they're going to try to buy cheaper food

1315
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,319
that makes them unhealthy

1316
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,119
that's just how the system is rigged

1317
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,880
it's rigged like that purposely

1318
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,359
and so

1319
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,119
that means you need to kind of supersede

1320
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,880
that so what i like about this juicer is

1321
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,960
it helps me supersede that because it's

1322
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,440
battling that saving you money and

1323
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,680
that's what i love right

1324
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,760
so yeah

1325
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,839
so

1326
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,720
celery juice is

1327
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:33,359

and you're in your juice which is

1399
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,359

1400
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,280
so what you'll notice here

1401
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:25,040
is that is the pulp right there

1402
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,280

00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,520
the mm 900 hds or you're not going to

1406
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,720
have this juicer

1407
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,720
it's that specific model right and what

1408
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,480
you're looking at right here is pulp in

1409
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:44,880
my fingertips

1410
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,839
and it's dry it's just slightly damp

1411
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,079
right

1412
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,079
in here

1413
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,000
there you go

1414
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,000
and it dries out quick too because it's

1415
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,400
just damp so what happens it just dries

1416
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,920
up and it starts to fall apart quick

1417
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,880
that's where you're saving your money

1418
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,480
with the mm-900 hds right there

1419
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,240
that's where you're saving it so when

1420
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,400
you run green i like to run greens

1421
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,240
through what i do is i take

1422
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,520
i take greens and i run that through

1423
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,960
sometimes too

1424
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,319
right

1425
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,079
but there you go

1426
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,800
that's the pulp it's dry that's the

1427
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,720
mm-900 so let's strain the cylinder

1428
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,480
juice you always want to strain it keep

1429
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:24,000
that in mind that's important

1430
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,000
because it's herbal medicine you're

1431
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,599
doing an extraction you don't want

1432
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,160
anything in there

1433
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,599
but the extraction itself so that's

1434
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,480
important to know right there so i'm

1435
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,480
going to move this over

1436
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,880
so let's get some celery juice going

1437
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,800
i got a friend saves all his cardboard

1438
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:53,040
boxes

1439
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,040
right

1440
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,400
because at home why don't you recycle

1441
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,839
them that's what i said i said why don't

1442
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,680
you recycle your cardboard boxes

1443
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:05,040
and my friend said

1444
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:07,119
no i save every last one of them okay

1445
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,000
so i save every last one of those

1446
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:12,559
cardboard boxes

1447
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,559
and go why

1448
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,040
you never know when you're gonna need

1449
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,920
one

1450
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,319
right

1451
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,319
you never know

1452
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,440
because i like to save things

1453
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,119
it's kind of like you aw you like to

1454
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,880
save lives

1455
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,880
because i like to save cardboard boxes

1456
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,680
you like to save lives that's what you

1457
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,280
do you know and

1458
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,880
so what i think about that when i even

1459
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,720
think about what he said

1460
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,400
it blows me away because it's not just

1461
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,960
about wanting to save lives and

1462
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,119
obviously that's why we're in this

1463
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:50,400
i mean right that's why we're in it but

1464
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,760
it's about saving organs

1465
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,280
it's about

1466
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,920
saving

1467
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,760
time with loved ones too you know so

1468
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,359
when you stick around longer on this

1469
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,400
planet because you cleanse and you

1470
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:04,160
restore and you bank minerals

1471
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,760
back into your organs and you bring

1472
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,880
yourself back

1473
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,640
you get more precious moments

1474
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,720
with maybe someone you meet that you

1475
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,960
would have never met because you lived

1476
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,440
long enough to meet them or precious

1477
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,000
moments with family members you actually

1478
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,839
get those precious moments saved because

1479
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,599
guess what you get more of them and you

1480
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,680
get more memories because your brain

1481
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,520
comes back and you get rid of all that

1482
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,040
alzheimer's that's starting up from your

1483
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,559
celery juice and you're cleansing and

1484
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,960
you're getting the poisons and toxins

1485
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,800
out right and so what happens is you get

1486
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,359
these precious moments

1487
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,920
and that's what you end up

1488
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:42,319
getting in the end is all those extra

1489
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,960
precious critical moments that your soul

1490
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,599
holds on to you so when you do die and

1491
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,280
leave this place your soul leaves and it

1492
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,040
leaves with all of these precious

1493
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,680
moments more precious moments and

1494
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,440
memories are in that soul of yours as

1495
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:59,200
it's floating out and leaving and

1496
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:02,160
propelling out of the solar system

1497
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,839
more time here on earth and more

1498
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,280
precious moments and if you're going

1499
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,280
through a struggle and a hardship right

1500
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,359
now what you're doing is you're working

1501
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,280
on healing yourself so that you stay

1502
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,040
here longer and so you can then meet

1503
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,119
somebody and because that's what happens

1504
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,119
our life changes all the time we end up

1505
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:22,839
seeing we meet new people in our life

1506
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:25,920
the journey changes to a whole different

1507
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:27,680
place and what happens is we've been

1508
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,920
able to kind of be a part of that

1509
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,280
transition making that happen by taking

1510
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,040
care of ourselves by cleansing and

1511
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,839
everything else

1512
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,520
staying here longer because of it

1513
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,680
and that's what matters right there so
