[87.21 - 92.22] yeah every day we've been trying to

[92.22 - 97.83] maybe four years yeah maybe a little bit
[95.28 - 99.54] more I don't miss a plant-based for five
[97.83 - 102.24] and a half years so your plant-based
[99.54 - 104.73] yeah oh cool and I'm four and a half I'm
[102.24 - 107.13] a year behind thank you got sick and she
[104.73 - 107.79] started and then we all we all followed
[107.13 - 110.70] her yeah
[107.79 - 113.28] Anthony basically saved my life a number
[110.70 - 116.55] of times but specifically one time when
[113.28 - 117.96] I had a foodborne illness and then it
[116.55 - 120.00] went into appendicitis and I had an
[117.96 - 121.14] appendectomy and it was rough recovery
[120.00 - 124.13] but I got through it
[121.14 - 126.50] thanks Anthony and all of his advice and
[124.13 - 128.99] reading his book which I think only the
[126.50 - 131.45] first one was out then it's a long time
[128.99 - 134.60] ago yeah yeah I mean it's five years ago
[131.45 - 139.19] I think yeah it'll be six years in March
[134.60 - 141.77] when everything changed for me so yeah
[139.19 - 143.78] it's been great and we do celery juice I
[141.77 - 145.10] do I'm up to about 20 ounces every
[143.78 - 147.14] morning me too
[145.10 - 149.90] okay that's amazing after the lemon
[147.14 - 152.15] water yeah first we can come in water 16
[149.90 - 154.10] to 20 ounces in lemon water and then we
[152.15 - 156.32] wait about half an hour yeah and then we
[154.10 - 158.54] do the celery juice and we got a new
[156.32 - 161.57] juicer we have a we have a green star
[158.54 - 164.12] here in LA and he has the Omega in New
[161.57 - 166.43] Orleans Meghan yeah and once we went
[164.12 - 168.41] from the centrifuge to the masticating
[166.43 - 170.54] it made a big difference because it just
[168.41 - 172.25] you do a whole thing of a whole bunch of
[170.54 - 174.29] celery and you get more than 16 ounces
[172.25 - 176.21] so we just kept doing it yeah the mega
[174.29 - 179.30] juicer the Omega juicer is my favorite
[176.21 - 181.61] it's just it's so easy to use it's easy
[179.30 - 183.29] to think we're always asking me like
[181.61 - 184.85] what do we do for juicers what do we do
[183.29 - 187.10] for juicers and and I always tell people
[184.85 - 190.61] look use the one I use it's a mega
[187.10 - 192.05] juicer so when om EGA go to go to their
[190.61 - 194.18] website thank you because people will
[192.05 - 196.88] buy the wrong juicer and get frustrated
[194.18 - 199.28] if it's too hard to clean it's too hard
[196.88 - 201.80] to clean they give up in that it this is
[199.28 - 204.95] like a medical device a juicer is a
[201.80 - 207.02] medical device it's not it's it isn't
[204.95 - 208.67] just some kind of like thing or holistic
[207.02 - 210.62] thing to do or I mean natural thing oh
[208.67 - 213.35] hey have this have this your salad
[210.62 - 215.21] spinner you got that you got your mixer
[213.35 - 217.19] you got your thing know that that's all
[215.21 - 220.22] great but the juicer is an actual
[217.19 - 222.59] medical device when you run like
[220.22 - 223.28] something like this which is an herbal
[222.59 - 225.59] tonic
[223.28 - 227.36] herbal medicine so you're doing herbal
[225.59 - 229.70] medicine you that's what it is it's
[227.36 - 232.22] extracting or medicine yeah yes I like
[229.70 - 233.81] the Omega but but but it's incredible so
[232.22 - 237.11] you guys are juicing you've been teasing
[233.81 - 239.21] for a while yeah I was thinking that we
[237.11 - 246.07] know you going back to working with her
[239.21 - 248.99] mom and that's no no no I want to say
[246.07 - 251.57] six or seven years so I think it's
[248.99 - 252.03] longer I think longer eight years yeah I
[251.57 - 253.44] agree
[252.03 - 255.48] I think it's somewhere about a year's
[253.44 - 257.97] and well you know the thing is with you
[255.48 - 259.35] guys is what I've always noticed is when
[257.97 - 260.91] you and when you find something that
[259.35 - 263.22] works you find something that's good you
[260.91 - 266.31] guys stay with it and you become like I
[263.22 - 268.32] mean it's basically your do you dedicate
[266.31 - 270.60] yourself to it I've never heard you guys
[268.32 - 273.86] ever say well you know what I'm trying
[270.60 - 278.52] this now or I'm trying you guys just
[273.86 - 281.34] tried everything and it didn't work and
[278.52 - 283.26] it didn't stick so this is yeah and I
[281.34 - 285.03] think also were super discipline we're
[283.26 - 287.91] both you know I was a dancer he's an
[285.03 - 290.10] athlete so that discipline is already
[287.91 - 292.05] built in and that does help but also
[290.10 - 294.51] when when you have tried a lot of other
[292.05 - 297.03] things and problem still arose and
[294.51 - 298.86] disease is still were happening then and
[297.03 - 300.87] this when you when we started doing this
[298.86 - 303.33] there we didn't have that issue there
[300.87 - 305.76] was no reoccurrence of illnesses I mean
[303.33 - 307.56] I I don't know the last time I got sick
[305.76 - 310.26] it's been a while no it hasn't and I
[307.56 - 312.75] think that's relevant is that we've seen
[310.26 - 314.94] we've seen results not just for
[312.75 - 317.19] ourselves but for so many people in our
[314.94 - 320.40] lives that we've either that have come
[317.19 - 322.26] on to Anthony on their own or we you
[320.40 - 323.97] know talked him up and they've joined or
[322.26 - 326.70] somebody's called and said I've got this
[323.97 - 335.52] problem going on she's like she's read
[326.70 - 337.74] every book every but she's she's like I
[335.52 - 340.59] haven't read as nearly as much as her
[337.74 - 342.48] but so many people have used the
[340.59 - 343.59] protocol and different or you know
[342.48 - 348.03] relatives of ours
[343.59 - 350.79] her mom cousins nephews our own children
[348.03 - 353.22] ourselves and they've had amazing
[350.79 - 355.02] results so it's not it's not like I
[353.22 - 357.84] think you change when things aren't
[355.02 - 360.06] working yeah it's like well okay and
[357.84 - 363.39] it's also not something that you can as
[360.06 - 367.32] we always say we ate a certain way me
[363.39 - 369.90] for sixty years of my life and then you
[367.32 - 371.58] cannot expect I mean this is the hardest
[369.90 - 374.37] thing for people understand you can't
[371.58 - 375.99] expect to do celery juice for a week and
[374.37 - 378.15] then everything is everything is there
[375.99 - 379.39] life is great now when I switched over
[378.15 - 381.85] to not eating
[379.39 - 384.64] anymore I would say it was at least a
[381.85 - 390.28] two-year process of kind of getting
[384.64 - 393.16] through just not quite feeling right and
[390.28 - 394.99] not and I haven't the idea of going back
[393.16 - 396.79] to me isn't doesn't easily I mean that
[394.99 - 399.22] exists for me at this point in time but
[396.79 - 401.47] it took time and the celery juice and
[399.22 - 402.94] and then the the smoothies and all the
[401.47 - 407.20] other protocols that we follow
[402.94 - 411.60] throughout the day they all they take
[407.20 - 414.40] they take time to settle in and but yes
[411.60 - 416.68] it's worth it yeah I mean I think that
[414.40 - 419.44] some people get results right away I I
[416.68 - 421.48] see on Anthony's Instagram which is so
[419.44 - 425.86] inspiring for me all of you out there
[421.48 - 429.34] you guys inspire me because people from
[425.86 - 435.04] Instagram here today either share
[429.34 - 437.41] incredible pictures you share your
[435.04 - 440.68] stories I read them all and they truly
[437.41 - 441.94] are inspiring to me and keep me going
[440.68 - 445.72] because sometimes when I talk to people
[441.94 - 447.73] I'll be affronted with doubt and a lot
[445.72 - 448.99] of questions and well you know how do
[447.73 - 450.61] you know this and a lot of times I'll
[448.99 - 452.50] say here's the book read the book and
[450.61 - 454.45] they want me to do their research and
[452.50 - 455.95] and and try to defend what they're
[454.45 - 457.48] saying and it's like you all the
[455.95 - 459.34] information is there you can read it if
[457.48 - 461.38] you want to so then when I go on
[459.34 - 464.17] Instagram and I see the positivity and
[461.38 - 466.12] so many stories of healing and
[464.17 - 468.49] especially the pictures which you can't
[466.12 - 471.04] argue that I mean I tell people that are
[468.49 - 473.20] doubting I like go to Instagram and see
[471.04 - 475.00] the results you cannot argue with those
[473.20 - 476.59] pictures ya know it happens that's what
[475.00 - 478.21] that's what you know journalists and
[476.59 - 479.83] media they don't go to that and they
[478.21 - 481.27] don't look at that and then they all of
[479.83 - 483.25] a sudden say oh celery juice doesn't
[481.27 - 485.29] work yeah I can't tell you how many are
[483.25 - 486.82] they do it for a week just doesn't work
[485.29 - 488.35] really yeah I can't say how many
[486.82 - 489.97] articles I talk about the people with
[488.35 - 491.89] chronic illness they're suffering their
[489.97 - 493.84] skin problems everything they cut all
[491.89 - 495.52] that out yeah and they don't look into
[493.84 - 497.11] that sometimes you know when it's at
[495.52 - 498.31] because when you look at that's what's
[497.11 - 501.61] powerful about Instagram because
[498.31 - 503.50] Instagram tells the real story the real
[501.61 - 504.82] story and you guys are fighting for it
[503.50 - 506.56] out there you're cleaning up everything
[504.82 - 508.03] you're healing you're working on it
[506.56 - 510.70] you're staying strong on it you know
[508.03 - 513.16] with Scott and Chelsea exactly they're
[510.70 - 515.32] they know you can't drink celery juice
[513.16 - 517.48] for just one week and so many people
[515.32 - 519.40] they hear about it out there and they
[517.48 - 521.55] don't look into the stories and they
[519.40 - 523.54] don't look into the powerful healing
[521.55 - 525.91] information that's happened and they
[523.54 - 528.07] don't read the books and they'll just do
[525.91 - 530.05] summary for five days and they'll say
[528.07 - 531.88] hey this is my story of doing celery
[530.05 - 533.71] juice for five to seven days really
[531.88 - 535.60] doesn't work really doesn't air you
[533.71 - 536.68] think you guys know you guys know just
[535.60 - 538.78] like so many people in the medical
[536.68 - 541.18] medium community once you do that celery
[538.78 - 543.97] juice and you really stay within each
[541.18 - 546.31] month at a time how it's a lifesaver and
[543.97 - 554.43] organized I've seen it out of the
[546.31 - 554.43] picture walking from over there okay
[558.66 - 562.63] seen so many people healed so many
[560.92 - 564.52] things from it when they stay with the
[562.63 - 566.86] long term and you guys you guys know
[564.52 - 569.11] that you guys read the books you were
[566.86 - 571.42] you doing even if Scott says well I
[569.11 - 573.37] haven't read as much but look that what
[571.42 - 575.62] happens is you guys really do read more
[573.37 - 577.21] than I've seen a lot of people do out
[575.62 - 579.82] there because people don't get the book
[577.21 - 580.81] and they'll rush to the recipes or
[579.82 - 584.56] they'll go right to the chat
[580.81 - 586.84] specifically their data that books tell
[584.56 - 588.79] a story all through it where they have
[586.84 - 592.27] to read the books all the way through
[588.79 - 594.16] and it's about understanding the big
[592.27 - 596.47] picture because I I've had friends call
[594.16 - 599.14] and say I have a this specific issue
[596.47 - 600.85] whatever whatever it was and there's
[599.14 - 603.49] nothing in the book about it and I'm
[600.85 - 605.50] thinking to myself yeah there is but you
[603.49 - 607.90] have to read the whole book because it's
[605.50 - 610.48] it's the overview and the understanding
[607.90 - 612.58] of the whole picture of what happens for
[610.48 - 615.01] you to understand oh this little thing
[612.58 - 616.84] that I'm dealing with pretty much I can
[615.01 - 618.07] understand this is what I need to do
[616.84 - 622.09] because it's going to help the whole
[618.07 - 623.86] body function better so I encourage
[622.09 - 626.62] everybody to read it and some of it is
[623.86 - 628.75] like for me I reread all the time I have
[626.62 - 629.95] two or three books by my bedside out if
[628.75 - 631.36] I wake up in the middle of the night and
[629.95 - 632.53] I can't go back to sleep I start reading
[631.36 - 634.48] and then I'm the next day and I'm like
[632.53 - 635.87] oh no it's six o'clock in the morning I
[634.48 - 637.82] gotta go
[635.87 - 639.35] Anthony we go to the grocery store
[637.82 - 645.17] there's no celery in the grocery store
[639.35 - 648.14] like dang those don'ts anywhere dolls
[645.17 - 649.34] you know it's funny the sour notes play
[648.14 - 651.41] now they're going to eat what I care
[649.34 - 652.64] people say well you know I'm gonna stop
[651.41 - 654.23] drinking celery juice or I'm not gonna
[652.64 - 657.53] show you my good actually that's good
[654.23 - 658.85] that's good in fact you know when you
[657.53 - 660.50] see when you see something out in the
[658.85 - 662.24] world of like science and research
[660.50 - 663.89] hasn't discovered celery juice you know
[662.24 - 665.51] being anything good for people even
[663.89 - 667.88] though millions are healing globally
[665.51 - 669.80] right so am I good keep on doing that
[667.88 - 672.26] because I can't find it anymore
[669.80 - 674.57] and I needed to calm down I got people
[672.26 - 676.70] to stop drinking it a little bit if you
[674.57 - 677.93] look you know I'm gonna get selfish for
[676.70 - 680.09] a second and say well everybody stop
[677.93 - 683.00] drinking it I'll always be there for me
[680.09 - 684.71] i buy lots and lots of cases and make
[683.00 - 686.27] sure my friends have lots of cases but
[684.71 - 689.75] you know that I'm owning I want you guys
[686.27 - 692.12] to have last year we were in Colorado
[689.75 - 692.51] and in the mountains and we were trying
[692.12 - 696.55] to get
[692.51 - 699.89] celery organic celery juice celery and
[696.55 - 702.95] in the middle of winter time and the
[699.89 - 704.48] person at the store said it's weird you
[702.95 - 706.40] know so people are coming in and they're
[704.48 - 707.96] buying celery and and some people are
[706.40 - 711.98] coming in they're just buying cases of
[707.96 - 717.83] celery and like hey but now we're
[711.98 - 719.51] screwed we can't get it will do cucumber
[717.83 - 721.37] juice yeah which is power double up on
[719.51 - 723.02] our lemon water and there's always
[721.37 - 725.36] there's always substitutes and that's
[723.02 - 727.34] usually not for very long when the store
[725.36 - 729.62] is out we have a couple secret stores we
[727.34 - 731.75] go to the camera so it helps to have the
[729.62 - 734.15] lemon waters a backup because it's its
[731.75 - 736.70] flushes out the liver washes out the
[734.15 - 741.05] kidneys if that's what it does you know
[736.70 - 743.12] and so that's really important concept
[741.05 - 745.28] that's in the in the liver rescue book
[743.12 - 747.32] you have that whole idea of the liver
[745.28 - 751.61] waking up in the middle of the night and
[747.32 - 753.89] trying to let it just work quietly by
[751.61 - 756.20] itself until noon or whatever without
[753.89 - 758.75] having introducing anything that's going
[756.20 - 760.70] to you know fats or any any breakfast
[758.75 - 764.15] stuff that's going to make it take it
[760.70 - 765.89] out of its kind of like cleansing it is
[764.15 - 767.96] is fascinating to me it's something I
[765.89 - 768.89] never knew but it kind of makes so much
[767.96 - 770.90] sense and when you
[768.89 - 774.29] acknowledge how important the liver is
[770.90 - 776.96] and how much liver related illnesses
[774.29 - 778.67] there are out there is everything it
[776.96 - 780.47] feels like it does it jam feels like
[778.67 - 783.71] it's everything although I know I have
[780.47 - 786.62] to under I'm diverting what am i doing
[783.71 - 788.48] yes I'm diverting for a moment but of
[786.62 - 790.67] late I've been keep bumping into people
[788.48 - 792.65] that are having brain stuff yeah going
[790.67 - 797.84] on and I'm like okay when's Anthony's
[792.65 - 799.13] I'm sorry no no I know I'm just worried
[797.84 - 805.88] about you but you shouldn't be here you
[799.13 - 807.14] should be working on last night writing
[805.88 - 810.02] trying to finish up this book I'm
[807.14 - 818.96] working on now exactly and and now
[810.02 - 820.43] you're so quiet in your life well you
[818.96 - 822.56] know the thing is with the brain the
[820.43 - 824.84] brain gets clogged up when the livers
[822.56 - 827.69] clogged up so that's what goes wrong
[824.84 - 829.37] when the livers all like all congested
[827.69 - 830.99] stagnant sluggish it's got all the
[829.37 - 833.39] poisons petrochemicals in there
[830.99 - 834.29] no one pump their own gas years ago you
[833.39 - 836.33] guys know that right
[834.29 - 838.25] no one pump their own gas there's 60
[836.33 - 840.32] year old daughters six year old sons are
[838.25 - 842.57] now pumping gas they're breathing it in
[840.32 - 844.61] like it was nothing it didn't exist in
[842.57 - 845.96] the past we have all that Patrick
[844.61 - 848.06] chemical going on in people's brains
[845.96 - 849.53] like never before the livers getting
[848.06 - 851.84] filled of toxic heavy metals mercury
[849.53 - 854.36] cadmium lead arsenic all of it
[851.84 - 856.58] mercury especially luminol right and all
[854.36 - 858.05] of this and then it gets overloaded and
[856.58 - 859.79] then pathogens people got the
[858.05 - 861.62] epstein-barr out there they got all the
[859.79 - 864.23] cytomegalovirus they got all that kind
[861.62 - 866.42] of stuff and with all of that adding up
[864.23 - 867.86] inside the liver it just it goes to the
[866.42 - 870.35] brain after the liver just kind of
[867.86 - 872.69] coughs it out like Oh overflow and boom
[870.35 - 876.14] it all comes out anymore yeah anxiety
[872.69 - 878.45] stars yep depression all of it that's
[876.14 - 879.68] why the liver so incredibly important
[878.45 - 881.09] that's why I had to do that big old
[879.68 - 882.74] liver rescue but but the brain had
[881.09 - 886.73] orange juice so that brain book is gonna
[882.74 - 888.92] come on its way to working on the liver
[886.73 - 890.39] and cleaning it well well he's writing
[888.92 - 891.86] the book about the brain and we just
[890.39 - 892.85] need to keep working on the plan of
[891.86 - 895.70] cleansing the liver
[892.85 - 897.11] it's a big job yeah no it is it's always
[895.70 - 900.41] got to be there it's like you have to
[897.11 - 903.08] have that Plus exactly but I mean the
[900.41 - 905.51] thing is though is is with you guys is
[903.08 - 908.39] what I've always noticed is that you
[905.51 - 910.97] know you you learn the information and
[908.39 - 912.65] then when you're telling other people or
[910.97 - 915.26] you're telling me you tell me the
[912.65 - 917.12] information no you know what I mean and
[915.26 - 919.58] I like that no I get on the phone with
[917.12 - 921.08] you it's just a nosy you're just like
[919.58 - 922.58] you're just you're just like you know
[921.08 - 924.11] what the thing is with this and this and
[922.58 - 926.18] this is what you needed your your
[924.11 - 927.71] digestive system your hydrochloric acid
[926.18 - 929.93] and I'm doing the celery juice because
[927.71 - 932.09] of this and and like you guys like
[929.93 - 933.44] really learn it and I know I know
[932.09 - 935.69] there's a lot of medical medium
[933.44 - 937.13] followers and they read the books and
[935.69 - 939.11] stuff and they know what to and they're
[937.13 - 941.33] sewing on it yeah right but you know
[939.11 - 942.95] it's it's also a lot of people where you
[941.33 - 944.99] you know it's like no that's your
[942.95 - 947.51] hydrochloric acid don't sorry just
[944.99 - 949.10] builds it up it written it and it takes
[947.51 - 952.10] time to get them to kind of learn about
[949.10 - 953.54] but what happens is they get diverted
[952.10 - 955.42] out there because the Internet's filled
[953.54 - 957.89] with all this other information that
[955.42 - 960.02] doesn't work yeah that is filled with
[957.89 - 962.21] all these other theories and concepts
[960.02 - 964.34] and then it gets all mixed up in
[962.21 - 966.05] Kabbalah then joggled out there so now
[964.34 - 968.78] awesome something somebody's putting
[966.05 - 971.66] lemon in their celery yeah the stores
[968.78 - 973.67] are lined now with like with lemon in
[971.66 - 975.35] celery juice while it's HPP high
[973.67 - 977.57] pressure pasteurization that means it
[975.35 - 978.98] was pasteurized so you think it's fresh
[977.57 - 980.90] it's got lemon in there it's not gonna
[978.98 - 982.61] help you then someone says I drank what
[980.90 - 983.15] I trans celery juice for 30 days and it
[982.61 - 986.09] didn't help
[983.15 - 987.98] and so it's so it really pays off to
[986.09 - 989.54] actually know the information to get
[987.98 - 991.34] help others so you can actually change
[989.54 - 993.65] the planet change the world and the
[991.34 - 995.33] healing cuz you know do you guys see it
[993.65 - 997.55] are people getting sick out there or is
[995.33 - 999.20] that online a bubble now I'm just so
[997.55 - 1003.19] weird kind of bubble and I don't know
[999.20 - 1004.96] what the hell's going on you can just
[1003.19 - 1006.94] look around and go what we're doing
[1004.96 - 1009.22] something wrong so we've done something
[1006.94 - 1010.90] wrong for many many many years you can
[1009.22 - 1012.31] look at our society even look at the
[1010.90 - 1013.84] amount of disease that's out there you
[1012.31 - 1015.37] know when you want to know something
[1013.84 - 1017.11] about a culture and a society you look
[1015.37 - 1018.64] at what's at the intersections when I
[1017.11 - 1021.73] was in the South shooting some films
[1018.64 - 1023.47] like 20 years ago every intersection had
[1021.73 - 1024.13] churches literally there before churches
[1023.47 - 1026.02] on an inner
[1024.13 - 1027.57] in the Bible Belt and you look at our
[1026.02 - 1031.12] intersections now they're either
[1027.57 - 1034.06] restaurants or drug stores or banks
[1031.12 - 1038.38] that's it that we have created a Sikh
[1034.06 - 1040.42] culture a sikh society and you know not
[1038.38 - 1041.38] specifically anyone's fault a lot of
[1040.42 - 1043.60] good people out there trying to help
[1041.38 - 1048.13] like like you say all the time but
[1043.60 - 1050.41] misguided for sure and you know for me
[1048.13 - 1053.35] and for our family or most of our family
[1050.41 - 1056.02] this is you know been incredibly healing
[1053.35 - 1058.09] and I know I'll never I'll never eat
[1056.02 - 1060.52] animal products again I know I'll never
[1058.09 - 1062.11] know that work for you guys I got a lot
[1060.52 - 1063.70] of people that are living that are doing
[1062.11 - 1065.35] the animal products but they're keeping
[1063.70 - 1067.06] away from the right ones I always tell
[1065.35 - 1070.03] them to stay away from the bacon keep
[1067.06 - 1072.10] the big we're in the eggs the cheese the
[1070.03 - 1073.48] milk stay away from those and yeah if
[1072.10 - 1074.80] you want some other animal products that
[1073.48 - 1076.42] works for you make sure you're doing all
[1074.80 - 1078.01] the other medical medium information
[1076.42 - 1079.45] well for you guys what works for you is
[1078.01 - 1082.03] the plant-based and I always say the
[1079.45 - 1085.06] plant place is great absolutely the yeah
[1082.03 - 1087.43] definitely I mean for a medium if we try
[1085.06 - 1089.20] to get in by the time we wake up and you
[1087.43 - 1091.12] have lemon water and then we have our
[1089.20 - 1093.04] celery and then usually either it
[1091.12 - 1095.80] depends if I'm going to like if I have
[1093.04 - 1098.16] work or something or a class I'll do an
[1095.80 - 1100.84] apple on the way or I'll take my
[1098.16 - 1104.77] heavy-metal detox smoothie in a in a
[1100.84 - 1107.11] thermos or my one of the liver liver
[1104.77 - 1108.82] rescue smoothie so I'll do one of those
[1107.11 - 1111.16] so I do one of those smoothies every
[1108.82 - 1112.72] single day and then by the time that and
[1111.16 - 1115.54] then I'll usually have a second Apple I
[1112.72 - 1117.10] mean it's like after lunch you know it's
[1115.54 - 1119.83] almost dinner time and then a couple of
[1117.10 - 1121.99] snacks and there isn't time really to
[1119.83 - 1125.14] have a turkey sandwich or something
[1121.99 - 1127.18] there's I'm trying to fill my day and my
[1125.14 - 1128.80] diet with so much and a lot of we're
[1127.18 - 1129.94] leaning more and more into raw so we're
[1128.80 - 1131.29] trying to get as many fruits and
[1129.94 - 1133.60] vegetables in and by the time you
[1131.29 - 1135.82] actually do that for me there isn't time
[1133.60 - 1138.22] or room in my stomach to put something
[1135.82 - 1140.32] else in whoa so an apple is medicine
[1138.22 - 1141.52] that's a thing in people people don't
[1140.32 - 1143.41] know that out there they're afraid of
[1141.52 - 1144.61] fruit it got the fruit fear because of
[1143.41 - 1146.44] all the misinformation out there
[1144.61 - 1149.17] floating around that's something that's
[1146.44 - 1151.65] really hurting people bad so Apple
[1149.17 - 1153.78] that's Madison right an egg is
[1151.65 - 1155.79] medicine there's nothing medicinal in an
[1153.78 - 1157.74] egg instead the egg will feed every
[1155.79 - 1159.54] pathogen people haven't they have acne
[1157.74 - 1161.55] that means they have streptococcus in
[1159.54 - 1162.75] their system if they have eczema that
[1161.55 - 1164.97] means they have that scene bar in their
[1162.75 - 1166.98] liver with copper so it's like and if
[1164.97 - 1168.81] you get if you eat the eggs you're gonna
[1166.98 - 1170.58] feed those pathogens and you're gonna
[1168.81 - 1172.32] get sicker but you know what's sad is
[1170.58 - 1174.12] there's a lot of people out there
[1172.32 - 1175.86] whether it's you know dietitians and I
[1174.12 - 1177.18] love dieticians and I love nutritionists
[1175.86 - 1178.95] and I love doctors you guys know that I
[1177.18 - 1180.87] mean that's all right all I'm about I've
[1178.95 - 1182.70] worked with doctors my whole life but
[1180.87 - 1184.56] there's a lot of different people in the
[1182.70 - 1186.90] field though don't know any of the good
[1184.56 - 1189.21] stuff and they tell all women just eggs
[1186.90 - 1190.53] eggs do eggs and protein and eggs and
[1189.21 - 1192.24] eggs and they tell them eggs just get
[1190.53 - 1194.04] sicker down the road and you know what
[1192.24 - 1195.96] it's all fun and games until you're
[1194.04 - 1197.73] suffering until you got like really bad
[1195.96 - 1199.35] fibroids and you're really suffering
[1197.73 - 1200.94] until you got PCOS and so you got
[1199.35 - 1203.19] endometriosis and it's out of control
[1200.94 - 1204.99] and your whole life becomes doctor
[1203.19 - 1206.94] visits yeah because you're getting
[1204.99 - 1208.47] information out there about how oh it's
[1206.94 - 1210.60] protein you should be eating egg oh you
[1208.47 - 1212.46] should be eating this or that and and
[1210.60 - 1214.50] you know what gets people in trouble so
[1212.46 - 1215.61] and what happens is when you say you're
[1214.50 - 1216.90] gonna be doing the apples and you're
[1215.61 - 1218.67] doing the different snacks you do all
[1216.90 - 1220.80] that that's medicine you're talking
[1218.67 - 1223.02] about that's what that is and we need
[1220.80 - 1225.12] that because the world has changed it's
[1223.02 - 1228.00] really polluted like never before
[1225.12 - 1230.82] yeah and and we were the ones actually
[1228.00 - 1232.23] just absorb any now plants absorb you
[1230.82 - 1234.60] know how plants are if they keep the air
[1232.23 - 1238.14] healthier right yeah thing right that
[1234.60 - 1239.85] that whole thing well we keep also the
[1238.14 - 1241.83] planet healthier because we're sucking
[1239.85 - 1244.14] up all that garbage that's floating in
[1241.83 - 1246.21] the air we're taking in all that plastic
[1244.14 - 1248.70] and petrochemicals we're taking in all
[1246.21 - 1251.01] everything else we're like the sponges
[1248.70 - 1253.02] now our livers like the sponges and
[1251.01 - 1255.00] we're keeping the planet cleaner in a
[1253.02 - 1257.13] way by becoming the ones that are filled
[1255.00 - 1259.11] with all the garbage and just like the
[1257.13 - 1261.87] plants are and people don't realize this
[1259.11 - 1263.16] so hey we're you know guys and we're the
[1261.87 - 1265.71] most vulnerable we're not walking around
[1263.16 - 1270.36] with armor and fur and that other
[1265.71 - 1272.70] animals have where where our skin it
[1270.36 - 1274.47] absorbs things and we're breathing in
[1272.70 - 1276.41] stuff every day so exactly I think the
[1274.47 - 1280.62] hardest thing for most people that I
[1276.41 - 1283.77] talk to about all this is just finding
[1280.62 - 1284.50] the time and also accepting a certain
[1283.77 - 1286.96] amount of respond
[1284.50 - 1289.21] ability for your health because we live
[1286.96 - 1291.28] in this tough in this era and I was
[1289.21 - 1293.05] thinking about this last night it's hard
[1291.28 - 1295.18] I know people say we don't have time we
[1293.05 - 1296.26] don't have time to get up in juice we
[1295.18 - 1298.09] don't have time we've got two little
[1296.26 - 1299.83] kids we don't we don't have time to do
[1298.09 - 1304.72] that we can't afford a juicer all those
[1299.83 - 1306.55] kinds of things and it's easier to have
[1304.72 - 1308.56] somebody to go to the doctor one time
[1306.55 - 1309.58] and get the pill and say this is what's
[1308.56 - 1312.88] wrong with your stomach
[1309.58 - 1315.19] take this pill it seems easier but in
[1312.88 - 1317.65] the long run all the pills go to your
[1315.19 - 1320.08] liver and they're not you're not solving
[1317.65 - 1322.21] a problem you're you're putting a lid on
[1320.08 - 1323.86] it you're covering it up and it's it's
[1322.21 - 1326.10] in Fester's and that's what I think
[1323.86 - 1328.42] we're seeing in in the pandemic of
[1326.10 - 1331.63] health issues that are going on around
[1328.42 - 1333.55] us now chronic illnesses and and mystery
[1331.63 - 1334.84] illnesses which was kind of one of the
[1333.55 - 1336.64] big things that I hooked into in the
[1334.84 - 1338.83] beginning when Anton I first met Anthony
[1336.64 - 1340.54] was talking to he's like yeah what are
[1338.83 - 1343.72] people doing for that I always go back
[1340.54 - 1346.60] to oh there is no cure for the common
[1343.72 - 1349.54] cold but there we spend billions of
[1346.60 - 1352.84] dollars on this planet with on products
[1349.54 - 1354.64] that are on a shelf every month or two
[1352.84 - 1356.17] months in the wintertime for all of our
[1354.64 - 1357.82] kids and all ourselves in the cough
[1356.17 - 1360.28] medicine all these things and in the end
[1357.82 - 1362.29] they're just kind of getting you through
[1360.28 - 1364.90] something masking and making it last
[1362.29 - 1367.78] longer but there is no cure but we have
[1364.90 - 1369.73] all this products that don't fix it they
[1367.78 - 1371.68] don't they don't prevent it they just
[1369.73 - 1373.63] kind of hear it makes you feel better
[1371.68 - 1375.76] because you think you're taking
[1373.63 - 1377.47] something to help you and instead of
[1375.76 - 1379.99] saying what is there something I can
[1377.47 - 1382.00] take before I get sick that I can do and
[1379.99 - 1383.77] make it habit and carve out that get up
[1382.00 - 1386.17] an extra half an hour earlier a day or
[1383.77 - 1387.49] in my case I get up an hour and ten
[1386.17 - 1389.59] minutes before I have to leave to go to
[1387.49 - 1391.90] work to make all the food and drinks
[1389.59 - 1394.51] that I need to take to go with me in the
[1391.90 - 1395.89] corner but it's become part of my like
[1394.51 - 1398.77] therapy it's almost like a meditation
[1395.89 - 1401.50] and it's and I say it's something that
[1398.77 - 1403.15] I'm doing for myself and then a trend
[1401.50 - 1405.49] you know then I pass that on to my
[1403.15 - 1406.93] family and to other friends so I'm
[1405.49 - 1408.46] getting I'm sharing something and the
[1406.93 - 1411.97] beauty of Anthony is that he's sharing
[1408.46 - 1413.32] this with everybody and you know he
[1411.97 - 1414.98] always says you can go to a library and
[1413.32 - 1416.30] pick up his books if you need to
[1414.98 - 1418.25] and if you can't get him in your local
[1416.30 - 1420.32] library send us a letter we'll send the
[1418.25 - 1421.58] book here we'll buy the books I'm send
[1420.32 - 1423.11] them to your library I don't care where
[1421.58 - 1425.60] you are we'll get you all the books and
[1423.11 - 1427.61] put them in your library and then you're
[1425.60 - 1429.50] you're taking there's something healing
[1427.61 - 1430.16] and just saying I'm doing this for
[1429.50 - 1433.94] myself
[1430.16 - 1435.83] and taking this time for my own health
[1433.94 - 1438.20] and well-being every day and it
[1435.83 - 1440.57] translates through your whole body not
[1438.20 - 1442.82] just whatever you whatever your ailment
[1440.57 - 1446.69] specific ailment is and it becomes a
[1442.82 - 1452.54] life kind of a life a habit and it's and
[1446.69 - 1459.14] it's life fulfilling and and anyway it's
[1452.54 - 1465.62] I rambled a little bit but well I never
[1459.14 - 1467.99] stop talking about how people are sick
[1465.62 - 1469.25] of us talking about family and they're
[1467.99 - 1471.80] just like oh here we go again
[1469.25 - 1473.12] sorry um what I was gonna say is one of
[1471.80 - 1476.09] the simple things that I like to say
[1473.12 - 1479.18] never fear if you think about our all of
[1476.09 - 1481.52] our bodies as a machine okay or like a
[1479.18 - 1483.35] car right you would never take a car if
[1481.52 - 1484.88] you had a gas part electric car you
[1483.35 - 1488.21] would never take a card of gas station
[1484.88 - 1491.66] and you choose choose the gas you can
[1488.21 - 1494.75] choose gas or you could choose part gas
[1491.66 - 1498.41] parts and or all stand you wouldn't pick
[1494.75 - 1501.56] the sand pump to put in your car or the
[1498.41 - 1502.97] part gas parts and pump because your car
[1501.56 - 1504.68] wouldn't function I don't know how far
[1502.97 - 1506.75] you would get on sand and gas but
[1504.68 - 1508.16] probably not very far you're gonna pick
[1506.75 - 1509.63] the gaps right to put in your car
[1508.16 - 1512.21] because that's how your car is gonna
[1509.63 - 1514.73] function not its optimum well our bodies
[1512.21 - 1516.50] are the same you can we can be eating
[1514.73 - 1518.63] you know a lot of the common stuff
[1516.50 - 1520.10] that's out there eating and your your
[1518.63 - 1522.05] machine is going to break down at some
[1520.10 - 1524.78] point and it may not be now but it will
[1522.05 - 1526.82] be later and you know little things
[1524.78 - 1529.16] start to creep up as you get a little
[1526.82 - 1531.44] bit older and or you can put stuff in
[1529.16 - 1533.69] your body that can actually use 100
[1531.44 - 1536.24] percent of which is the celery juice and
[1533.69 - 1538.40] that's why it was soupy I always tell
[1536.24 - 1539.96] everybody that no one's immune to
[1538.40 - 1540.95] getting a symptom there's a lot of
[1539.96 - 1542.54] people who think they're indestructible
[1540.95 - 1544.76] now they're young they're working out
[1542.54 - 1546.86] there doing their thing but they will
[1544.76 - 1547.78] end up with symptoms because everybody
[1546.86 - 1549.67] is
[1547.78 - 1551.11] that's the problem right now yeah and
[1549.67 - 1552.52] you know when you said Scott you said
[1551.11 - 1554.11] mystery illness that's how can you like
[1552.52 - 1555.79] locked on to send the medical medium
[1554.11 - 1557.92] information begin with the first book I
[1555.79 - 1559.48] talked about you know that's when she a
[1557.92 - 1561.64] spirit of compassion coined the whole
[1559.48 - 1563.92] mystery chronic illness thing yeah and I
[1561.64 - 1565.78] say that because nobody knew did all
[1563.92 - 1567.70] these illnesses like eczema psoriasis is
[1565.78 - 1571.78] a mystery they didn't know they thought
[1567.70 - 1572.47] because it had a name the research you
[1571.78 - 1575.08] know what it was about
[1572.47 - 1576.82] yeah multiple sclerosis yeah I wrote my
[1575.08 - 1578.98] ology they're all mysteries right so
[1576.82 - 1581.08] it's not just this random case of
[1578.98 - 1583.09] mystery illness where someone gets sick
[1581.08 - 1585.82] somewhere in some part of the country
[1583.09 - 1588.28] and doctors are good you know perplexed
[1585.82 - 1590.47] every single condition that has a
[1588.28 - 1592.42] symptom that has a symptom or a
[1590.47 - 1594.31] condition that's mean that you know
[1592.42 - 1595.93] anything that has a label as a mystery
[1594.31 - 1597.55] to research in science the medical
[1595.93 - 1599.56] science of research now all of it
[1597.55 - 1600.94] autoimmune complete mystery to research
[1599.56 - 1601.78] in science they don't know that's why
[1600.94 - 1603.28] they're telling everybody they're
[1601.78 - 1606.10] blaming it on them now they're saying
[1603.28 - 1608.17] it's your body being faulty your bad
[1606.10 - 1610.63] genes okay we all got bad genes just in
[1608.17 - 1612.13] the last 20 years that's centuries and
[1610.63 - 1614.74] centuries centuries our big genes just
[1612.13 - 1616.42] went complete just dinner down the tubes
[1614.74 - 1618.73] in just the last 100 years and you know
[1616.42 - 1620.44] so every so the young people that you
[1618.73 - 1622.99] know older people and people in their
[1620.44 - 1625.45] 40s and 50s whatever and they all know
[1622.99 - 1627.49] they're learning now that there isn't
[1625.45 - 1628.81] answers out there hello and you're
[1627.49 - 1630.34] younger you're brought to think oh wait
[1628.81 - 1632.26] a minute no the doctors got all the
[1630.34 - 1634.00] answers well when you start getting that
[1632.26 - 1635.38] AXA money you're going to doctor doctor
[1634.00 - 1637.06] and then you start getting neurological
[1635.38 - 1638.08] symptoms and now you're got the anxiety
[1637.06 - 1640.72] and other stuff you going to a
[1638.08 - 1643.15] neurologist and then in your 32 now
[1640.72 - 1644.71] you're 34 you're 38 what I'm saying is
[1643.15 - 1647.29] you want to learn the truth about
[1644.71 - 1649.27] chronic illness you guys did you want to
[1647.29 - 1650.53] learn the information so you can protect
[1649.27 - 1652.99] yourself and you can print because
[1650.53 - 1654.76] everybody's getting symptoms you know
[1652.99 - 1656.59] what people look at me sometimes when I
[1654.76 - 1659.05] say that I mean some they go glassy-eyed
[1656.59 - 1661.00] all right they don't see I really I
[1659.05 - 1662.68] don't know about that because I'm eating
[1661.00 - 1664.72] healthy I'm eating a healthy keto diet
[1662.68 - 1666.97] or I'm eating a healthy whatever and I'm
[1664.72 - 1668.56] working out I'm doing my my weight
[1666.97 - 1670.15] training whatever it is and they're
[1668.56 - 1671.95] young and they kind of get glassy-eyed
[1670.15 - 1674.02] over that they're like he does he's out
[1671.95 - 1675.73] of touch but I'm not out of touch
[1674.02 - 1678.07] because you'll remember this you'll
[1675.73 - 1680.14] remember that no everybody's getting
[1678.07 - 1680.64] something on whether it's UTIs that
[1680.14 - 1682.89] become
[1680.64 - 1684.33] whether it's ringing the ears whether
[1682.89 - 1685.83] it's tingles numbness whether it's
[1684.33 - 1688.59] anxiety depression aches and pains
[1685.83 - 1691.08] spasms twitches back pain leg pain
[1688.59 - 1692.82] plantar fasciitis on the feet whatever
[1691.08 - 1694.62] it is you know you can just keep on
[1692.82 - 1696.24] going and a diagnosis and everything
[1694.62 - 1698.16] else about it everybody is coming down
[1696.24 - 1700.17] with something yeah and that's why this
[1698.16 - 1701.73] information so critical but you got you
[1700.17 - 1703.41] guys see it out there you see people
[1701.73 - 1705.18] getting sick you see it all over the
[1703.41 - 1707.52] place it's heartbreaking it really is
[1705.18 - 1709.83] it's heartbreaking and I feel like we
[1707.52 - 1712.47] have this little gem of information
[1709.83 - 1713.85] medical medium and I want to share it
[1712.47 - 1715.47] with everybody and I want everybody to
[1713.85 - 1717.30] at least try it and I know it's hard and
[1715.47 - 1719.37] one thing I want to say about Scott is
[1717.30 - 1723.56] you know he works really long hours I
[1719.37 - 1723.56] mean like nobody like me seriously yeah
[1725.30 - 1729.42] and you know I'm sure people are
[1727.92 - 1730.65] thinking oh but he's an actor and he's
[1729.42 - 1731.97] probably got all these people doing this
[1730.65 - 1733.74] stuff for him he does have an assistant
[1731.97 - 1735.42] that will sometimes go to the grocery
[1733.74 - 1737.07] store for him but I think you prefer to
[1735.42 - 1740.67] pick out your own stuff usually he does
[1737.07 - 1742.92] everything but he does give up even
[1740.67 - 1744.96] after a 16-hour day he'll he will go to
[1742.92 - 1746.43] the gym and then he comes back and in
[1744.96 - 1748.59] the morning he gets up an hour to an
[1746.43 - 1751.17] hour and a half early to prepare all of
[1748.59 - 1753.36] this because he because he then can do a
[1751.17 - 1755.49] 16-hour day and go to the gym literally
[1753.36 - 1757.38] that the reason he's able to really do
[1755.49 - 1760.08] that is yes he's got discipline but
[1757.38 - 1762.18] mostly because of the celery and the
[1760.08 - 1764.19] heavy-metal detox smoothie and the food
[1762.18 - 1766.17] that he eats during the day and not very
[1764.19 - 1768.24] much fat and all the stuff that he's
[1766.17 - 1771.54] doing to keep his machine running yeah
[1768.24 - 1773.40] and look it's not I by I'm not perfect
[1771.54 - 1775.77] and I sometimes eat things that I wish I
[1773.40 - 1778.56] hadn't eaten and I sometimes don't have
[1775.77 - 1780.96] time to prepare the things that I wished
[1778.56 - 1785.25] I had time to prepare for but I can tell
[1780.96 - 1791.88] you this that I can my energy through my
[1785.25 - 1795.63] days has changed also a year ago was it
[1791.88 - 1799.71] a year two years ago no that I stopped
[1795.63 - 1801.90] drinking coffee and I think I know ring
[1799.71 - 1804.66] is closer and so because I think it's
[1801.90 - 1808.41] two years in March and so my my energy
[1804.66 - 1810.60] level and you know I'll arrive I'll work
[1808.41 - 1811.32] on over 16 hours on three and a half
[1810.60 - 1813.03] hours sleep
[1811.32 - 1814.29] night before because I flew in I didn't
[1813.03 - 1816.72] have time and I gotta get up at 4:00 in
[1814.29 - 1818.61] the morning but I'll go 16 hours and I
[1816.72 - 1826.20] will go to the gym afterwards can do and
[1818.61 - 1829.20] I am using but I'm by using and eating
[1826.20 - 1831.78] this way I have solid consistent energy
[1829.20 - 1835.38] throughout the day and I'm not a young
[1831.78 - 1837.57] person anymore but I think most of the
[1835.38 - 1840.66] young people's ass on earth all day long
[1837.57 - 1842.55] because I'm I'm just eating better than
[1840.66 - 1846.75] they are and I'm putting better fuel in
[1842.55 - 1848.37] my body and and I and I also had carry
[1846.75 - 1850.68] that positive attitude through the day
[1848.37 - 1852.96] with me and that comes from just feeling
[1850.68 - 1854.97] what I what I'm using and what I what my
[1852.96 - 1859.05] energy level is coming from it's all
[1854.97 - 1862.29] good and positive so I feel you know I
[1859.05 - 1864.75] just I'm incredibly grateful that we've
[1862.29 - 1866.76] had this big change really huge change
[1864.75 - 1869.64] in our life and it's and it's like it
[1866.76 - 1871.89] literally is life saving life extending
[1869.64 - 1873.96] and more importantly quality of life
[1871.89 - 1875.73] when you're looking at you know it's
[1873.96 - 1877.68] easy when you're 18 it's like don't
[1875.73 - 1879.93] worry about it so our 18 year old
[1877.68 - 1882.63] friends and members of our family that
[1879.93 - 1884.94] are young they whether they choose to
[1882.63 - 1887.40] use this protocol now they've been
[1884.94 - 1890.07] exposed to it they understand it when
[1887.40 - 1891.42] they use it they see in me they do see
[1890.07 - 1894.18] immediate results because when you're
[1891.42 - 1895.83] young your body is is cleaner and for
[1894.18 - 1897.54] the most part you hope and can process
[1895.83 - 1900.66] things quicker and get to the truth of
[1897.54 - 1904.82] stuff faster but one of one of my
[1900.66 - 1908.70] relatives who was diagnosed with
[1904.82 - 1910.32] borderline celiac he and he's in college
[1908.70 - 1912.87] so what do you want to do in college you
[1910.32 - 1915.09] want to drink beer and eat pizza beer
[1912.87 - 1919.29] out of aluminum cans all of those things
[1915.09 - 1921.84] and he was in trouble and his stomach
[1919.29 - 1924.75] was giving him a lot of trouble and he
[1921.84 - 1927.18] switched he made a switch to sell reduce
[1924.75 - 1928.98] he committed to doing that in college
[1927.18 - 1930.96] which is horrible Anthony always calls
[1928.98 - 1934.83] him his hero which makes him feel really
[1930.96 - 1936.24] good and and he had he's amazing stuff
[1934.83 - 1938.60] he's slowly changed but he would
[1936.24 - 1941.16] have amazing immediate results and then
[1938.60 - 1942.36] periodically as a young person he'd go
[1941.16 - 1943.74] out and have the feet set with the guys
[1942.36 - 1945.69] and and he couldn't always get
[1943.74 - 1948.00] gluten-free pizza and you know and he
[1945.69 - 1950.37] couldn't always find a wheat free beer
[1948.00 - 1953.04] and those kinds of things and so he
[1950.37 - 1955.05] would slip and then immediately if his
[1953.04 - 1956.58] stomach would go again so he knows he
[1955.05 - 1959.22] has the information that's my point
[1956.58 - 1961.89] he has the information and he knows if
[1959.22 - 1963.36] he wants to take care of himself or he
[1961.89 - 1965.28] wants to make it change he has all the
[1963.36 - 1968.16] information it's in the book he calls
[1965.28 - 1969.90] her all the time we talked about it and
[1968.16 - 1972.81] so that's the good news
[1969.90 - 1974.52] the information is there it's it's it's
[1972.81 - 1976.83] out there and millions of people are
[1974.52 - 1979.44] picking it up and and we feel we feel
[1976.83 - 1981.23] tremendously grateful for that and we
[1979.44 - 1983.34] want more people to do it because
[1981.23 - 1985.29] there's no reason that we can't take
[1983.34 - 1986.91] charge of our own health that's that's
[1985.29 - 1989.64] the other thing that's the that's the
[1986.91 - 1992.13] blessing within books is it really that
[1989.64 - 1994.08] all the information is in the books you
[1992.13 - 1995.40] know so you you I know everybody would
[1994.08 - 1997.53] love to be able to sit here with Anthony
[1995.40 - 1999.47] and tell them your everybody talked to
[1997.53 - 2001.85] Anthony all the time we're like it's in
[1999.47 - 2004.07] the book doesn't it ease please just
[2001.85 - 2005.51] talk to us though because we're do know
[2004.07 - 2008.33] you can't he doesn't talk to us anymore
[2005.51 - 2015.44] he's too busy and we're okay with that
