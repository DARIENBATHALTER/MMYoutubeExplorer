life-changing things that move the

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,569
needle and that's what matters you know

37
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,310
when you're sick with chronic illness

38
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,050
and you're trying to get better and you

39
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,550
can't move that needle forward and you

40
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,349
know and you're stuck in it and you're

41
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,450
just in the trenches of it all and then

42
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,429
something takes you further along and

43
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,259
you finally start experiencing a benefit

44
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:47,700
you start getting better let's say the

45
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,830
celery juice is one of the most powerful

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,450
healing tools out there and when you

47
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,869
start moving forward it's life-changing

48
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,880
like no other when people are stuck when

49
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,130
they're actually really stuck in the

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,069
trenches of what I call hell basically

51
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,170
chronic illness and they finally see the

52
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,940
light and that matters that's why I'm

53
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,560
here absolutely and I love that energy

54
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,810
man because I think you're so right that

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,220
so many of us today are so stuck and a

56
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,530
lot of the time we've tried everything

57
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,420
or I hear that a lot with my lens I've

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,940
tried everything let up into my doctor

59
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,739
I've been to this person like I tried my

60
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,939
weird thing that my aunt comes up with

61
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,319
like you know I've tried all of these

62
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,329
things and the thing is it's not like

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,220
those are bad those are all good things

64
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:28,230
because everybody's got a piece

65
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,250
the puzzle you got the best doctors out

66
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,020
there you got functional medicine

67
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,910
doctors you got alternative guys you got

68
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,320
conventional guys girls all of them

69
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,700
they're all working hard on their

70
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,290
patients and people people have

71
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,630
compassion doctors are the most

72
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,370
incredible people the compassion to wake

73
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,170
up in the morning go to the office and

74
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,540
work on person after person after person

75
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,540
like they do and hear their stories and

76
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,800
hear their cries doctors are

77
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,990
unbelievable and the tool there's a lot

78
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,300
of good tools out there right but what

79
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,030
happens is there's some things people

80
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,310
don't even know about yet that that plug

81
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,350

82
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,790

83
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,020

84
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,910
diet say they're doing a plant-based

85
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,380
diet and they're not getting all the

86
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,330
results they need and they're all

87
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,120
confused and everybody's flip-flopping

88
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,770
from vegan to paleo to paleo to vegan

89
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,690
and everybody is all upset but when you

90
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,970
plug in something like the celery juice

91
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,220

92
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,530

you don't agree with or you're not happy

138
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,210

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,990
technicians and scientists and doctors

148
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,450

bring that out before they even knew

153
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,200

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,180
say hey he's advanced with this

155
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,070

157
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,270
little bit we got to calm down and say

158
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,250

helping people and at four years old

161

that's what happened it was information

162
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,550
coming through perfectly clear I heard

163
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,830
heard it straight in a voice write to me

164
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,780

166
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,900

wouldn't it wouldn't ease off if the

170
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,910
doctors didn't know what was really

171
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,370
causing the back problem it wasn't an

172
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:14,060
injury it was an inflammatory condition

173
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,280
a mystery back injury or a mystery back

174
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,180

strained it with a cheesecloth and we

185
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,620
just strained it out and and a family

186
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,900
member was a skeptic about celery juice

187
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,880
well what do you mean celery juice drank

188
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,639
it and started recovering that night

189
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,710
slowly recovering and then

190
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,379
the end of the week out of the woods

191
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,689
with his back from walking and it's that

192
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,879
kind of thing right there and yes the

193
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,719
voice tells me what to do so that's what

194
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,699
I've done

195
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:06,759
dedicated my life helping people but

196
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:09,819
giving them information that even

197
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,979
doctors want to know there are thousands

198
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:13,750
of doctors in this country alone with

199
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,659
the medical medium series books in their

200
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,490
offices patients have brought them in

201
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:20,530
and they and the doctors art they're

202
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,270
smart they read it and say wait a minute

203
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,520
this is different

204
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,710
whoa wait he's talking about viruses

205
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,909
he's talking about pathogens he's

206
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,860
talking about things we don't know about

207
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:33,250
viruses and pathogens that's not

208
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,500
anywhere and also what to do which is

209
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,539
one of the tools the celery juice I love

210
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,550
selling stuff online but shipping out

211
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:41,169
takes so much time and cost so much

212
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,750
money that it can make the process

213
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,300
extremely frustrating but then I found

is that process for you you know what it

286
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,500
is is when you when you see it working

287
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,450
in front of your own results you know

288
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,520
when I was 13 years old and a stock boy

289
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,589
in a little grocery store and that voice

290
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,480
is telling me you know why someone has

291
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:42,370
diabetes or what's going on or what's

292
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,050
happening with them or or the brain

293
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,180
tumor that they have or something that's

294
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,980
going on and the voice is telling me

295
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,920
what's happening inside their bodies and

296
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,650
what they need you just you just it you

297
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,970
can't avoid it you can't ignore it it's

298
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,140
not one of those things you should say

299
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,890
well I don't I don't want to do this

300
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,540
anymore

301
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,940
you know it's not what you're you're in

302
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,459
it and you just you go with it and you

303
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,140
keep on working you know forward to help

304
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,270
people and change and change your lives

305
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,620
it's so critical absolutely so let's get

306
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,620
on to the cellar do you start

307
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,089
discovering the secret behind this like

308
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,829
how did you start seeing that it had

309
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,480
such a powerful effect how did you first

310
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:18,010
uncover because I think there are just

311
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,460
so many vegetables out there you can

312
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,690
make so many Juice

313
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,580
people have drank probably the wrong

314
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,589
juices for such a long time yeah then

315
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,029
where did it start all juices are great

316
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,460
that's the thing all juicers are great

317
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:29,779
they offer benefits and a lot of people

318
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,149
they get confused they say well why

319
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,250
would celery juice by itself do anything

320
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,880
for you and one of the reasons is it's

321
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:40,490
an herb it's not a vegetable it's an

322
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,350
actual herb and herbal medicine is

323
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,450
powerful I mean if anybody is listening

324
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,910
out here do you like herbs on any level

325
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,709
what herbs are your favorite there's so

326
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,910
many people that are into any cut

327
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,500
they're into herbs that's the whole

328
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,180
thing you got Chinese medicine you got

329
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,760
air Vedic you got all this herbs are

330
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,200
powerful and there's herbalist out there

331
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,360
there's doctors out there natural

332
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,920
doctors you know and in herbs are a big

333
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,779
part of our lives so well why do they do

334
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,930
things for us they because they're very

335
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:08,300
healing well celery has been its it no

336
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,680
one knew and that's the thing I mean

337
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,440
even when I heard it from the voice

338
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,529
originally perfectly clear Sellars used

339
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,870
the celery it's an herb I was even like

340
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,230
wait a minute no it's a celery stick

341
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,270
what do you mean this is this is a

342
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,250
vegetable that no one cares about and

343
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,050
never really cared about and spirits

344
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,360
like it's not a vegetable it's an herb

345
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,430
it's herbal medicine you extract it in a

346
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,430
large quantity and when you do that

347
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,140
that's when the miracles happen and then

348
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,420
you know someone might say wait a minute

349
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,459
you know you have to leave the fiber you

350
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,860
have to leave the pulp the juice things

351
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:45,290
not good you're leaving like nutrition

352
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,959
behind the fiber and the pulp but what

353
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,839
they don't understand is chamomile tea

354
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,640
right do you eat the teabag after you've

355
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,589
like had camp you go out with a friend

356
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,700
right do you cut open that teabag and

357
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:57,770
say wait a minute I got to get this

358
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,029
fiber I got to get this pulp here cuz

359
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,459
that's where the nutrition is no the

360
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,959
medicine comes from the chamomile and

361
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:05,329
that's what you're getting that medicine

362
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,010
to relax you to calm you the things that

363
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:08,779
people like same thing with other herbs

364
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,120
in herbal teas and so forth of course

365
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:13,550
you can eat some of the herbs but

366
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,459
they're better extract at the medicine

367
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:19,370
so it's the power of that this is an

368
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:21,050
herbal tonic and herbal elixir and what

369
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,430
you'll see out there's dietitians who

370
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,930
are amazing people are nutritionist who

371
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,520
are amazing people what they'll do is

372
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,990
they'll be confused and be like no no no

373
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,490
leave the pulp and fiber

374
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,020
Anthony William doesn't know what he's

375
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,970
talking about you don't you don't want

376
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,490
to just have that

377
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,860
they don't know this is herbal medicine

378
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,949
you're extracting a large quantity of

379
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,269
this incredible mysterious tonic why is

380
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:43,360
it mysterious science the research

381
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:46,420
hasn't looked into what is in celery yet

382
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,490
barely any information out there another

383
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,089
reason why people don't know but we're

384
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,649
getting there

385
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,420
we're actually getting there we are

386
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,889
getting there and you're leading that

387
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,060
movement which I absolutely love like

388
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:57,069
it's incredible like you're really

389
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,660
pushing that out there and I think it's

390
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:02,500
so important that we do live in a time

391
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,449
where we are allowing unique voices to

392
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,180
come to the fore yeah you know maybe in

393
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:09,160
1975 and years after that people would

394
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,740
have been close to these things but now

395
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,269
people are seeing also the lack of

396
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,769
certain research in certain studies and

397
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,139
recognizing that there are alternatives

398
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,000
tell me when you started uncoming celery

399
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,889
juice what are the key issues that

400
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,689
you're seeing celery juice benefit what

401
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:24,399
are the key challenges the people

402
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:26,740
experiencing ottowa mean I know there's

403
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,139
a big leap oh my god big Liz big list

404
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,120
people dealing with chronic illness what

405
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:34,870
I call chronic illness symptoms that

406
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,790
won't alleviate more come constantly or

407
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,220
on and off intermittently but they don't

408
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,899
go away technically what could that be

409
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,879
chronic fatigue syndrome

410
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:46,389
Emme chronic fatigue syndrome right lyme

411
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:49,209
disease multiple sclerosis Hashimoto's

412
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:52,300
thyroiditis lupus these are just some

413
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:54,430
things eczema and psoriasis rosacea

414
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,839
different conditions people suffer from

415
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,449
and all this acne

416
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,220
there's SIBO all of these things you

417
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:02,740
could just keep on going on things that

418
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,779
people are plagued with you know and the

419
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,209
fatigue is one of them that's a big one

420
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,250
when moms can't get out and they can't

421
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:11,199
get out of the house and and run the

422
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,430
house and run their careers and take

423
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,350
care of their children because they

424
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,870
become barely function because a severe

425
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,259
brain fog chronic fatigue syndrome and

426
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,250
and not have real answers in the

427
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:22,959
fibromyalgia and the rheumatoid

428
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,300
arthritis and all these things people

429
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,399
suffer with these are the things celery

430
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,649
juice starts to move the needle with

431
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,540
it's these these things it's different

432
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,309
when someone's exercising every day two

433
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,899
hours day they feel good they're young

434
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:37,209
they're strong in the moment they

435
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:38,889
haven't gotten sick yet in their lives

436
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,179
they haven't been there and they're

437
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:41,319
trying celery juice for a week and

438
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,910
they're like I'm not sure what I'm

439
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,690
noticing I think there might have been

440
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,150
energy I

441
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,730
don't know but then you take someone

442
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,490
who's been to 50 doctors okay

443
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,320
been through hell and back struggled

444
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,180
suffered been told they're crazy

445
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,310
okay or given three four different

446
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,990
diagnoses and then you take somebody

447
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,220
like that and they tried everything

448
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,570
they've been on every diet they've been

449
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,500
to every functional medicine doctor

450
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,210
they've been to every single

451
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,300
conventional doctor everybody they can

452
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,860
under the Sun and then they try celery

453
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,080
juice for two weeks three weeks for two

454
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,600
months for thirty days for anything for

455
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,550
five days and they're like oh my god I'm

456
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,960
getting relief for the first time and

457
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,330
I've tried everything I have fifty

458
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,430
supplements piled up in my house in my

459
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,840
cupboards I got all this food I buy

460
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,310
everyday from all these different diet

461
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,050
plans I talked to all these different

462
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,050
doctors I'm online looking for

463
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,880
information and celery juice is moving

464
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,850
the needle and it's getting me better

465
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,560
and that's why it's here there's

466
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,620
something really important to understand

467
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,020
here health trends are not propelled

468
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,480
like this this is propelled because

469
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,170
people are actually healing that's the

470
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,050
difference this is this is an organic

471
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:53,140
movement this is a trend or something

472
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,930
more powerful above a trend and people

473
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,690
don't realize this yet they through they

474
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,640
sayers are too late for the party they

475
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,020
can complain and cry and say oh there's

476
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,079
no science behind it

477
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,610
they well what what else in there's so

478
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,360
many things there's no someone said

479
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,220
recently

480
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,540
well forget celery juice you have to eat

481
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,040
all the rainbow of the colors where's

482
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,300
the science proving that if you eat

483
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,770
every rainbow and the color that you're

484
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,260
gonna be you're gonna fix your chronic

485
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,060
illness where's that science there's no

486
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,800
science on that about what someone

487
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,329
actually healing a chronic illness

488
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,650
moving forward because they're eating

489
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,910
all the rainbows and the colors of

490
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,380
course you want all the colors in the

491
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,600
foods and you want all the different

492
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,580
foods I never said you know that would

493
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,130
be bad or good or not I said that's

494
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,020
great but celery juice is a medicine

495
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,360
that you can bring in to everything

496
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,970
you're doing and it's really changing

497
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,010
lives it's incredible I know I keep on

498
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,500
saying it's only because it's only

499
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,720
because it actually is working other

500
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,450
health trends are propelled by other

501
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,330
things there's tremendous monetary

502
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,250
behind it like monetary involvement

503
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,800
pushing that trend so you take all that

504
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,020
college and of course you

505
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,670
take all of that whatever it is so you

506
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,500
take all that apple cider vinegar so you

507
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,300
take it all there's there's money which

508
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,130
hey that's just how the world works we

509
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,510
know that and there's money propelling

510
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,540
that well you're the only thing

511
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,160
propelling celery juice is millions of

512
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,230
people getting benefits and telling

513
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,170
their story without being prompted or

514
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,540
paid to do it it's never happened in

515
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,670
history before and if you don't like

516
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,920
that idea I don't know what to tell you

517
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,320
if you don't like the idea of there's no

518
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,840
science behind celery juice yet you know

519
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,480
what tell people tell that to someone

520
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,270
who suffered and struggled push through

521
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,430
their day and they and they realize see

522
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,690
when you get sick you realize science

523
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,610
and research doesn't have the answers

524
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,350
for chronic illness sure there's

525
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,760
life-saving medicine out there sure if

526
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,620
you get into a car accident there's

527
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,080
life-saving medicine I know incredible

528
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,300
ER doctors I know amazing surgeons

529
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,460
actually that do procedures that save

530
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,530
our lives in different do all kinds of

531
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,660
different problems we have but let me

532
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,850

you're suffering and you've been to 20

535
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,810
doctors okay you realize fast science

536
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,240
and research dropped the ball somewhere

537
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,190
where maybe people don't know but they

538
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,170
dropped it and they dropped it hard

539
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,700
because people have they people have

540
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,890
been suffering and struggling there's

541
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,860
over 250 million Americans in the u.s.

542
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,330
that have a symptom that won't go away

543
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,800
getting worse and that's where we're

544
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,020
heading we're heading into the land of

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,530
especially young you're 20 years old 22

548
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,780
years old you get sick you're 25 years

549
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,850
old you get sick you quickly learn right

550
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,620
there science and research isn't what

551
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,390
everybody was saying it is when it comes

552
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,950

anxiety it's crippling depression and

558
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,210
you realize science the research doesn't

559
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,850
know anything about these things so then

560
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,080
where are we then someone said to me Jay

561
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,640
they said there's no science and

562
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,320
research to your information there's no

563
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,840

streams that I run apart from making

613
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,830
videos and throughout the years I've

614
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:53,489
learned if you don't know your numbers

615
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,830
you don't truly know your business we're

616
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:57,929
currently growing my business icon media

617
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,580
but the problem growing businesses have

618
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:02,190
that keep them from knowing their

619
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,230
numbers is their mix of business systems

620
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,909
they have one system for accounting and

621
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,999
other for sales and other for inventory

622
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:11,159
and so on it's just this big inefficient

623
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:13,440
mess that takes up too much time and

624
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,690

your profits yeah I loved Anna and I

643
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:59,450
agree with you like I think everything

644
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,340
you just stated there I I agree with the

645
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,350
fact that science and research is

646
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,119
measuring that which has happened yeah

647
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,559
right it's rarely we call it

648
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,970
breakthrough science but it's not

649
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,009
breakthrough because it has to watch

650
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,659
something for a significant amount of

651
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:13,820
time or years you know what I mean like

652
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:15,109
there is these ideas or these unique

653
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,149
things that come out they get tested

654
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:18,649
over time yeah it's never that you can't

655
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:20,059
test something in two seconds and talk

656
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:22,399
about it yeah and science the research

657
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:24,169
is amazing we need it I'm Holly I'm all

658
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:26,179
for it in fact some incredible things do

659
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:29,059
happen from it but they're usually

660
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:31,070
theories that have to be proven somehow

661
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:33,799
correct right and then you have the

662
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,809
investors behind it to prove it and then

663
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:38,119
in the end you don't know we have

664
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:40,580
because it changes 10 years later we're

665
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,049
often wait we were wrong now we have a

666
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,999
whole bunch of things we're saying now

667
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:45,350
this it's this way and that's happened

668
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,269
so many times really difficult for

669
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,299
people you know it's incredible I mean

670
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:52,789
at the same level I've seen people say

671
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:54,710
why drink celery juice you're better off

672
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:55,999
just putting a little bit of sea salt or

673
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,799
a little bit of Himalayan rock salt

674
00:23:55,999 --> 00:24:00,200
right in your water and it'll do better

675
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,669
because something because research in

676
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,139
science doesn't know anything about

677
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:04,279
celery juice research and science

678
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:06,889
doesn't know anything about putting

679
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:09,379
Himalayan sea salt in your water and

680
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:10,940
then that's in the same breath they'll

681
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:12,649
say something research and science

682
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,029
hasn't even studied yet either and

683
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:16,070
they'll say well make sure you do this

684
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,450
put salt in your water it's gonna help

685
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,159
you so much better than celery juice

686
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,840
because there's no signs behind celery

687
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,809
juice it's almost like do you know what

688
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,220
you just said is incredible so oh I

689
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,749
didn't know there like so much for

690
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,609
celery juice well you know you know what

691
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:29,610
it is is that you could put a lot of

692
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,710
time on that

693
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,180
hating on celery juice it doesn't sound

694
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,340
like the Westing thing when you have

695
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,190
something this powerful and moving

696
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,990
forward to this degree and this fast you

697
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,820
got all the stores selling out what's

698
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,240
there celery it's all it's all going you

699
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,580
got farm scrambling to actually grow it

700
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,500
as fast as they can and then and get

701
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,940
land up and grow it and grow it you know

702
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,620
farms don't make any money I mean

703
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,660
they're all subsidized most of them you

704
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,520
know how they struggle as it is when you

705
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,480
see all that people start getting this

706
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,310
they're getting nervous

707
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,500
and then when celery juice is helping

708
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:04,890
millions of people really fast it I

709
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,260
think it's a threat in many ways to so

710
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,570
many industries so ya know there's love

711
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,790
for celery juice tons of love out there

712
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,510
but also you got the people saying hey

713
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,970
wait a minute

714
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,530
leave your fiber and pulp in there no

715
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,480
leave your fiber and pulp and all the

716
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:21,540
other vegetables and stuff use it but

717
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,400
this extract it like a medicine right

718
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,080
tell me about some of the stories that

719
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,480
you've seen in your life of people

720
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,010
transformations whether it was frantic

721
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,290
illness just tell me a couple one or two

722
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,750
stories or examples where you've really

723
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:37,100
seen people who feel transformed through

724
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:40,110
sellers use debilitating eczema

725
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,300
debilitating psoriasis where people

726
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,400
suffer they can't get it they can't wear

727
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,530
clothes they can't leave the house

728
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,930
because they can't preclude thing on

729
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,610
their skin and they're just doing the

730
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,140
steroids they've tried the steroids you

731
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,270
try different things they've seen so

732
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,310
many doctors they suffer their skin is

733
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:59,580
cracking and bleeding everywhere

734
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:02,340
and celery juice brought into their

735
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,840
their lives and used correctly like I

736
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,740
talked about in the celery juice book

737
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,360
and it gets them to clear it up they

738
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,090
start to see benefits

739
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,770
I mean miraculous case is reversed it's

740
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:15,930
it's incredible I'm not just talking

741
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,660
about it got a little bit better I know

742
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:21,930
many cases many of them over the years

743
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:24,030
and now today where they get rid of that

744
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,950
debilitating Aksum a-- where they were

745
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,870
crying they cried they had to be on

746
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:31,350
painkillers they couldn't even move

747
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,810
their arms and legs and they got through

748
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,140
it on the other side of it also

749
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:38,640
debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome

750
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,140
fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis getting

751
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,790
people forward with that people with

752
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,720
Lyme disease celery juices all of a

753
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,789
sudden the very thing

754
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,980
that's now changing everything with

755
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:49,620
their diagnosis that they've got or no

756
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,480
diagnosis where doctors are confused and

757
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,220
they're just sick and their home and

758
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,770
they got high anxiety and depression

759
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,320
I've seen the celery juice do something

760
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:01,710
for these people but for decades I've

761
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,659
seen it before it exploded before the

762
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,690
publication of the medical medium series

763
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:10,049
books in 2015 you know it was already

764
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:12,210
building it was a quiet storm I think it

765
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:14,159
snuck up on everybody it snuck up on the

766
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,260
world I think this health trend or

767
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,020
whatever we want to call it now has

768
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,510
snuck up in a way and became a tidal

769
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,580
wave just last year it finally became

770
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,980
this big tidal wave and I always say to

771
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,530
people you know what if you learn about

772
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,020
it now and you know it's it's important

773
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,580
so yeah and I also think that it's a

774
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,890
tidal wave for those who are really

775
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,980
looking and then there is a lot of us

776
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,409
who are interested but we don't find out

777
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,730
until someone brings it to the front of

778
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,840
our minds the front of eyes you know

779
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,000
what I mean they're gonna do it's like

780
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,140
until someone really breaks it down for

781
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,370
you like you have in this book like

782
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,010
until someone really explains you the

783
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,240
process of why it works how to take yeah

784
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,520
like you've done in this book like I

785
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,470
feel like even then if that doesn't

786
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,179
happen a lot of these trends just go

787
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,770
over our heads absolutely right and for

788
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,020
most people because these trends feel

789
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,700
like such it's still too hard yeah oh

790
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,080
it's like a short-term thing like oh I'm

791
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,700
gonna watch some I watch the video I'm

792
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,590
gonna try it for a week yeah but I don't

793
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,760
have a process yeah tell us about the

794
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,140
process that you outlined in this book

795
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,250
and how you've made it so simple you

796
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,230
know there's there's there's a there's

797
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,210
over a hundred questions always asked

798
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,130
how do I drink silver juice what do I do

799
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,740
- I do I put my blender with my other

800
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,659
food it's all that it has to be by

801
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,480
itself it has to be by itself in a

802
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,520
certain amount sixteen ounces is where

803
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,789
you want to be to start with it's

804
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,010
sixteen ounces of it jeast fresh very

805
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:34,470
fresh very important so you could you

806
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:38,159
sit at home fresh okay you can go to a

807
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:40,470
juice place I do recommend don't do the

808
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,090
HPP thing which is high pressure

809
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,400
pasteurization I mean there's nothing

810
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,320
wrong with HPP I mean you can do other

811
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,360
juices that are HPP you go into health

812
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,650
food stores grocery stores you see all

813
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,090
those drinks they look like they're

814
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,159
really fresh they look like they were

815
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,390
just done yesterday but they got a date

816
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,500
on them for a couple of weeks because

817
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,990
it's it's high pressure

818
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,640
pasteurization now I noticed that that's

819
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,740
happening with celery juice don't get

820
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,780
confused by that don't pick that one

821
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,510
because if you pick that one it's gonna

822
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:09,360
be hindered it's gonna lose its its its

823
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,860
healing benefits his potency exactly you

824
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,810
want it juice fresh go to your juice

825
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,550
bars go to health food stores that will

826
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:17,010
juice it right in front of you make sure

827
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:19,230
it's done right there do it at home and

828
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,790
that's where the magic happens so there

829
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,650
is gonna be there there is a confusion

830
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,210
developing where you may get you get the

831
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,500
bottled celery juice now sitting on

832
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,700
there people like well that must be as

833
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,590
good as everything else and if they're

834
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,510
not experiencing the benefits they they

835
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:32,250
need from drinking it then they get they

836
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,350
get forwarded by it they get pushed off

837
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,540
by it yeah so yeah that's just one

838
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,770
example I answer lots of questions can

839
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,360
you do while you're pregnant yeah you

840
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,220
can do celery juice can you do it while

841
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,590
you're breastfeeding yes so there's just

842
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,810
so many questions these are just a few

843
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:48,150
yeah and asked me consume straight often

844
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,620
it can't be that yeah you want you can

845
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,080
wait a little bit you can wait hours

846
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,420
later you can even wait a day later have

847
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,100
it in the fridge have in the fridge but

848
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,540
and that will still be better than say

849
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,220
something like in the store at high

850
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,510
pressure pass ratio you know when there

851
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,850
were two shut with a long show and

852
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:05,130
ideally straightaway yeah ideally that's

853
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,050
gonna have the most fancy yeah and talk

854
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,670
about what's in it that hasn't been

855
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,280
discovered yet and if someone says well

856
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,740
how would he know this voice he hears

857
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,770
how would I know epstein-barr was the

858
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,840
cause of thyroid problems and I was the

859
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,370
guy long before talking about it

860
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,990
everywhere talking about it the doctors

861
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,510
talking about it then publishing and

862
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,280
everything else and and and now they're

863
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,380
saying hey science research just found

864
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,650
there's a link to Epstein bar to thyroid

865
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:34,470
disease thyroid disorders same thing

866
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:36,690
with the celery juice yes I hear the

867
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,670
information I know what's in it there's

868
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:42,030
something called sodium cluster salts

869
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:44,310
that's the antiviral that's the that's

870
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:47,100
the pote that's the phytochemical

871
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,660
compound it's this sodium cluster salt

872
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,210
somebody might say well what is that

873
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,430
it's a subgroup of sodium undiscovered

874
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,680
by research in science you think that we

875
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,810
only have one type of sodium that's it

876
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,150
on the planet and that's it no there's

877
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,710
more than that it's a subgroup it's a

878
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,300
different thing going on in celery it's

879
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,770
not in anything else they're gonna find

880
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,690
it down the road they probably won't

881
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,100
call it sodium cluster salts are not

882
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,929
going to give me that credit

883
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,340
not gonna Pat me on the back and be like

884
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:13,890
yeah you're they're gonna name it

885
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,160
something else obviously but that's what

886
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,010
it is

887
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,470
it kills bugs here's the deal I'll just

888
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:22,590
simplify it people are sick

889
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,990
because they got bugs that's it

890
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:27,600
your your Hashimoto's thyroiditis your

891
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:30,030
rheumatoid arthritis bugs cause this

892
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,679
it's not your body attacking itself it's

893
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:34,679
bugs it's pathogens

894
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,900
that's viruses it's bacteria so when

895
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,700
people have their fibro there's a bug

896
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,980
involved that's what this is chronic

897
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,230
fatigue syndrome there's a bug so what's

898
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,760
going on is we're filled with bugs I

899
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,710
know that's kind of annoying we got

900
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,200
viruses like epstein-barr we got the

901
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,900
simplex is in us wreaking havoc we got

902
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,659
the hhv-6 is we have shingles viruses we

903
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,820
have bacteria and people have these bugs

904
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:00,360
in them we live with them they create

905
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,919
inflammation meanwhile the food Wars

906
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,929
that are going on the vegans against the

907
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,919
Palio's and and the keto and everything

908
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:06,960
else and everything fighting each other

909
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,330
but nobody realizes you guys are all

910
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,070
dealing with Epstein bars dealing with

911
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,380
strep a caucus you're dealing with strep

912
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:15,210
and button different viruses and the

913
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,740
reason why celery juice is working is

914
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,780
because the sodium cluster salts and

915
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,520
celery juice is annihilating a lot of

916
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,500
bugs and people it's breaking it down

917
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,970
it's killing them it's cleaning up their

918
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,200
livers it's getting the bugs out of the

919
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,940
livers and that's why they're

920
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,789
inflammation is actually getting better

921
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,659
and better Wow amazing and I was looking

922
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:32,340
at something you were saying about how

923
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:34,350
it's blood it's also stopping the

924
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,059
vicious cycle of addiction yeah yeah

925
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,950
which is incredible how does that work

926
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:39,510
well yeah that seems like a totally

927
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,190
different challenge in in my head at

928
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,720
least like from an uninformed point of

929
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,070
view so how is celery juice even helping

930
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,380
people with addiction well you know what

931
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,909
it revives your liver it starts restore

932
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,270
it your liver can actually hold more

933
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:52,860
what's called glycogen glucose because

934
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:55,169
that's what it needs to do it needs to

935
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,450
store glucose and glycogen the very

936
00:32:55,169 --> 00:33:00,630
thing that we it's the very thing that

937
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,700
runs our blood sugar throughout our body

938
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,799
when our blood sugar is in unstable and

939
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:08,610
it's imbalance we tend to fall prey to

940
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,250
addiction really easy plus electrolytes

941
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,929
we all lack electrolytes so when you eat

942
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,610
a food of any kind of you drink water

943
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:16,380
you get some electrolytes naturally

944
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,659
occurring any kind of food you eat

945
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,809
there's a natural occurring electrolyte

946
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:22,629
going on there

947
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:24,039
well those are pieces you're collecting

948
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:25,899
all day long what did you have for

949
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:27,309
breakfast there's some electrolytes in

950
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:29,440
it what did you have for lunch there's a

951
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:31,149
few more electrolytes in it and then

952
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,950
dinner a few more or during the day

953
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:35,679
there's electrolytes in things we're

954
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:38,309
consuming but we're never getting enough

955
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,570
at once we're never getting the whole

956
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:43,179
electrolyte the whole lecture like

957
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:45,039
family at once right on the neurons

958
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:46,989
right with the neurotransmitter

959
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,299
chemicals using them right all of this

960
00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:51,639
happening celery juice is like a

961
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:53,019
complete electrolyte still undiscovered

962
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:55,179
by research and science of course

963
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:56,499
research knows that there's antioxidants

964
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:58,869
in celery juice of course they know

965
00:33:56,499 --> 00:34:00,399
there's vitamin A and K in there it's

966
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:02,080
funny and I've heard somebody say maybe

967
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,239
people are getting better because the

968
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,099
vitamin A and K and I'm like what about

969
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:07,869
the vitamin A and K that's in every

970
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:09,789
other fruit and vegetable what about all

971
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:11,500
of that plus all the supplements people

972
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:13,389
are you're still not moving forward why

973
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,879
is this doing it does it have a

974
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:18,010
different vitamin A and K what it does

975
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,079
have those has a full complete

976
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,210
electrolyte it goes to the brain fast

977
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,369
and easy clings on to the neurons

978
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,679
revives tired dehydrated

979
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:28,929
neurotransmitter chemicals start to

980
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,940
actually bring those back so your

981
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,200
electrical impulses fire fast so you

982
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,579
could be quick talking so you can

983
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,379
actually hear when you can actually

984
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,909
think what you're saying it all comes

985
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:38,919
the brain fog goes away everything

986
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:42,279
starts clearing up and those when those

987
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:44,109
electrolytes hit those neurons and spark

988
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:45,639
that fire and those electrical impulses

989
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:49,929
are cruising through those neurons and

990
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:51,760
that is precious that is like gold right

991
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,289
there and that's another reason why

992
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,579
addiction could stop so you want to

993
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:56,200
bring it back to addiction when those

994
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:57,970
electrolytes are hitting all those

995
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,410
neurons your electrical impulses are

996
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,930
firing and running through those neurons

997
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,250
and all that's happening and you're

998
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,349
starting to think clearer and your brain

999
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,960
fogs back and down you you don't fall

1000
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:09,910
prey to addiction right there that alone

1001
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,230
there's the blood sugar starts to

1002
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,210
balance out because your liver is

1003
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,190
healing getting better your glucose

1004
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,680
reserves in your in your and your liver

1005
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,240
are storing back up so it can control

1006
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,859
part of the blood sugar problem that we

1007
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,900
deal with because it's not just the

1008
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:25,150
pancreas and when all that's happening

1009
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,700
you get stronger your mind gets stronger

1010
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:29,680
your control gets stronger you get you

1011
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,839
know what you take control over your

1012
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,790
life and that's what celery juice if you

1013
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,920
want one

1014
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,870
simple thing for me right there you know

1015
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,640
what use celery juice to help take

1016
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,440
control over your life absolutely

1017
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,390
because it can it can be one of those

1018
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,780
tools I'm not saying it fixes everything

1019
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:48,480
in anything in one shot I'm not saying

1020
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,380
this is literally the miracle that will

1021
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,690
fix it all

1022
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,030
no because everybody else is doing good

1023
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,880
things this is that thing that pushes it

1024
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,410
over the edge absolutely where you need

1025
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,110
to go and that's why I mean your energy

1026
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,580
and your your love for celery juice is

1027
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,440
infectious and contagious I don't know

1028
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,980
anyone in this room right now who is not

1029
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,260
dedicated at least testing it but but

1030
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,190
tell me about some of the lifestyle and

1031
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,500
diet habits that can cause a conflict or

1032
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,270
negate the amazing benefits of celery

1033
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,660
juice what is it that we're doing in our

1034
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:23,550
lifestyle or a diet that could slow down

1035
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,630
or go against the benefits of celery all

1036
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,610
right I'll tell you right now

1037
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,160
look I know this is gonna get everybody

1038
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:32,370
upset okay in the audience but probably

1039
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,170
not everybody but most everybody if you

1040
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:36,630
if there's something to take out of your

1041
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:38,970
diet or wherever you stand whatever I'll

1042
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:41,100
ER on whatever diet belief system you

1043
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,930
are that you're that you're involved

1044
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,330
with subscribe to whatever it is you

1045
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:47,190
take you need to take eggs out so

1046
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,890
chicken eggs have to come out of your

1047
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,600
diet now I hate to be the breaker of

1048
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:53,760
this news or the person that has to

1049
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,650
break this news to everybody but what I

1050
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,900
want to tell you is the most important

1051
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:00,300
part the most important part of this

1052
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,090
podcast probably for anybody to take in

1053
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,400
is we live with these bugs inside of us

1054
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:07,440
that create all of our illnesses whether

1055
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,940
it's not happening now say we're younger

1056
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,890
but it'll happen later when we're

1057
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,950
turning 40 it'll happen later when we're

1058
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,870
45 it'll have whatever it is we have

1059
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,850
these bugs and it's like the viruses and

1060
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:21,450
the bacteria the pathogens that are in

1061
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:23,670
us eggs feed the pathogens bottom line

1062
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,320
no matter what you believe in out there

1063
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,150
whatever diet system whatever you

1064
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,710
believe in protein and macros whatever

1065
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,120
you're talking about in your life that

1066
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,500
you believe in whether your trainers

1067
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,320
whether your nutritionist whether your

1068
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,120
doctors whatever it is just know that

1069
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,890
when you eat the eggs it feeds the

1070
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,750
pathogens and I hate to break it to

1071
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,790
everybody but pathogens come from

1072
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,860
sources they come from places they come

1073
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,470
from petri dishes they come from labs a

1074
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,750
long time ago and you know how they were

1075
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,820
they were raised by being fed food one

1076
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,369
of the foods that fed them was chicken

1077
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,070
eggs we eat the eggs we feed our viruses

1078
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:58,170
and we get sicker slowly over time

1079
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,849
celery juice is getting you better

1080
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,520
it's killing pathogens but if you keep

1081
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:04,410
on feeding your pathogens then it's kind

1082
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,420
of working against you right so that's

1083
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,520
powerful tool right that's it yeah I

1084
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,490
mean I've been in exit 16 years but I

1085
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,990
had no idea that I've never heard anyone

1086
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,940
raise doubt about eggs before yeah well

1087
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,770
you're it's information you're not gonna

1088
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,150
hear anywhere else and that's that's why

1089
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,400
people heal with medical medium

1090
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,980
information is because it's finally new

1091
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,380
information information that is

1092
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,990
different that no one even knew or

1093
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,580
thought about or understood that's and

1094
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,590
that's one of them right there same

1095
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,420
thing with the gluten the gluten or the

1096
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:36,420
gluten everybody thought gluten was just

1097
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,250
inflammatory nobody knew gluten actually

1098
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,609
is inflammatory because it feeds the

1099
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:43,590
bugs too I brought that to town was what

1100
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:45,210
anybody likes that or not I brought that

1101
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:46,550
and they may say hey well he hears a

1102
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,680
voice oh I don't want that information

1103
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:51,660
but no guess what they'll find that out

1104
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,010
pretty soon I think even more people are

1105
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,300
talking about it I think doctors are

1106
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,220
talking about it now because I've been

1107
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,040
putting it out there for so many years

1108
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,510
the reason why people get sick on gluten

1109
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,700
and then someone else doesn't get sick

1110
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:04,080
on gluten because you realize you can be

1111
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,150
90 years old eating gluten they're all

1112
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,710
your whole life you could be like 50

1113
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,089
years old you've you've eaten it your

1114
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,250
whole life you never had a problem with

1115
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:15,119
gluten and then someone can't even eat

1116
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:16,770
it at 16 18 25 and they have to take it

1117
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,780
out because they have certain pathogens

1118
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:20,220
inside their body they're feeding off of

1119
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,720
gluten itself and then creating

1120
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,030
inflammation it's not the gluten

1121
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,810
creating it so that's why that should be

1122
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,369
out too

1123
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,140
you know you should get that out too but

1124
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:29,550
there's a reason you should get gluten

1125
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,380
now it's not like oh well he's just

1126
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:34,440
saying no gluten cuz everybody says that

1127
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,560
no there's a reason I know that reason

1128
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,369
learn about it it'll help you absolutely

1129
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,400
amazing and are there any other

1130
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:43,619
lifestyle habits that could work against

1131
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,700
this it could work against where people

1132
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,320
are not absolutely what I mean

1133
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,970
absolutely I'm not seeing the benefits

1134
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,560
absolutely it could be you could be toad

1135
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,300
eating something incredible incredible

1136
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,580
no an amazing question thank you for

1137
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,710
asking so here's what you got to be

1138
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:59,250
concerned about when you're using celery

1139
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:00,000
juice to not bombard your celery juice

1140
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,250
with food

1141
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,230
too close to it if you're drinking your

1142
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,060
celery juice and it's not an empty

1143
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,520
stomach you're not getting the benefits

1144
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,440
it has to be on an empty stomach 16

1145
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,750
ounces on an empty stomach is critical

1146
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,490
that's what morning is best if you got

1147
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,380
to do the afternoon fine and try to keep

1148
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,390
food away from it so if you any

1149
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,190
lifestyle of eating whatever you have

1150
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,990
dotted with any kind of food lifestyle

1151
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,850
whatsoever you just need that celery

1152
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,920
juice on an empty stomach away from

1153
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,510
those other foods that that right there

1154
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,140
is critical the morning or evening makes

1155
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,910
a difference

1156
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,590
any mornings always best more than that

1157
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,150
empty stomach in the morning that

1158
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,860
hydrochloric acid gets built up

1159
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,630
everything you know and that's another

1160
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,880
part I want to talk about that digestion

1161
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,770
and how the HCL builds up when you're

1162
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,060
drinking celery juice why it builds up

1163
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:46,590
how the stomach glands receive the the

1164
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:49,770
celery juice and how they actually

1165
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,360
recharge and give you hot you strong HCl

1166
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:53,250
hydrochloric acid and then you break

1167
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,960
down your food and your food doesn't rot

1168
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,280
inside of you and you actually get

1169
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,290
strong what your digestion and your

1170
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,360
bloating goes down that's another thing

1171
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,800
too that's really powerful wow that's

1172
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,920
that's super powerful I didn't had no

1173
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,480
idea yeah so with with the with having

1174
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,490
in the morning how long often do you eat

1175
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,920
breakfast okay you know try to give 20

1176
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,870
minutes 20 minutes 20 minutes after the

1177
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,120
celery juice is great okay half an hour

1178
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,650
probably even better you know somewhere

1179
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,570
around 20 minutes to a half an hour I

1180
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,610
like a half an hour really being solid

1181
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,020
like that but if someone needs fuel and

1182
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,460
they're doing something or they're

1183
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,470
running out of the house or whatever I

1184
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,330
totally understand it but try to do

1185
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,430
empty stomach try not to do coffee with

1186
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:31,080
it try not to put anything in that

1187
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:33,000
celery juice if you throw apple cider

1188
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,980
vinegar in it you just killed it just

1189
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,660
killed it you know how could you throw

1190
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,950
something else in it I saw somebody out

1191
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,090
there saying I'm gonna put my collagen

1192
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,560
powder in here I'm like you just

1193
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,570
destroyed your celery juice you're not

1194
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,800
gonna see the benefits so you can't yet

1195
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,540
you have to keep it clean

1196
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,550
I'm not multiple times per day just once

1197
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,320
a day no you do the celery juice once a

1198
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,610
day but I like a lot of people that have

1199
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,610
chronic illness do it twice a day

1200
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:55,560
okay 32 ounces do you know at the

1201
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,940
beginning 16 ounces do 16 ounces the end

1202
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,140
of the day

1203
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:01,260
absolutely and try not to have it with

1204
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:03,570
food that's the goal but the truth is

1205
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,670
you get the celery juice in you any way

1206
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:07,980
you possibly can you're gonna get some

1207
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,810
benefits but these are maximizing it

1208
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,630
this is why the books critical the book

1209
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:13,380
gives you all the information to how to

1210
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,820
really do

1211
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,380
this right if you think there isn't a

1212
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,120
lot of information to it wait till you

1213
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,980
read the book and then your mind is

1214
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,140
blown and you're just like oh my god I

1215
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,120
can't believe what can be done with

1216
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,830
celery juice including like oral

1217
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,630
therapies and stuff for problems that

1218
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,550
people have like they have you know

1219
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:32,460
ulcers and all this stuff in their mouth

1220
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:34,230
and this book is actually explained so

1221
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,600
much and here's the most important part

1222
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:39,000
I loved about this book is that there's

1223
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,550
almost 200 symptoms and conditions I

1224
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,260
talked about inside this book and what

1225
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,180
southern urges can do for it and why

1226
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,130
it's working so if you have something

1227
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,020
you're suffering with I talked about how

1228
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,280
the celery juice is helping you hmm

1229
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,140
and I loved one of the things I do love

1230
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,750
about the book seeing is I don't think

1231
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,190
there's ever been an audio file that has

1232
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,840
the word celery mentioned more than this

1233
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,030
right now which is awesome which I love

1234
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,040
but what I love about the book is you

1235
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,160
also have a whole chapter dedicated to

1236
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,180
if people can't access celery and

1237
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,590
alternatives that they can take yeah

1238
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,330
which I thought was really refreshing

1239
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,860
yes this is you know it's a book about

1240
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,840
center would you be like hey if you

1241
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,950
can't get it I mean yeah and I don't

1242
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,300
know why people can't get it but maybe

1243
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,680
you can tell me that but if there are

1244
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,540
places people can't access it you

1245
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,920
suggest some alternatives yes share

1246
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,440
those with it yeah absolutely there's no

1247
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,060
way to get celery juice you cannot you

1248
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,820
can't get it it's not even possible or

1249
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,440
just it's just not around and there's

1250
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,850
nothing you can do you know there's

1251
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,920
other things you can do I like the

1252
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,600
cucumber juice it won't do what celery

1253
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,250
juice does I don't want anybody confused

1254
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,080
but it does some different things it

1255
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,150
hydrates the body in a different way

1256
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,400
than anything else could out there you

1257
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,990
know it does hydrate the body it does it

1258
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,210
does things that are really good for us

1259
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:47,580
it's very cleansing very purifying it

1260
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:49,230
won't it won't do what celery juice does

1261
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,880
but it could be something you do for a

1262
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,920
week before you can find the celery

1263
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,870
juice again so you know juicing

1264
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,370
cucumbers is actually helpful and so

1265
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,290
when someone said to me recently I said

1266
00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:00,120
okay so what so let's just start juicing

1267
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,950
different things and that's good no no

1268
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,200
no those cucumber juice doesn't kind of

1269
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:06,720
do it it just isn't but it's it's one of

1270
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,000
those backups to get you by for a little

1271
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,220
bit like a week or a few days and and

1272
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,170
and but that's about it I mean honestly

1273
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,360
it's it's gonna have to be the celery

1274
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:17,190
juice or it's really in the end no-go

1275
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,840
for what you're really yeah what you're

1276
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,760
really and I know you cover in here but

1277
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,950
I wanted to raise this because I know so

1278
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,030
much not just of my audience but just so

1279
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,020
many people in the world today we're

1280
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,800
reading studies about it all the time

1281
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,560
mental health

1282
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,380
depression anxiety stress what celery

1283
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,480
juice doing on a deeper level for stress

1284
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,640
anxiety and depression well it's the

1285
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,860
ultimate adrenal you know stabilizer

1286
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,880
that's the that's the other thing with

1287
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,650
this celery juice

1288
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,450
I mean it's so helpful yeah you got the

1289
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,220
letter lights got the sodium cluster

1290
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:46,470
salts you got the heavy electrolytes in

1291
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,390
there and in adrenals need that that's

1292
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,460
so important the other thing is brain

1293
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:52,170
that that's the other thing when you're

1294
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,790
dealing with electrolytes and and

1295
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:57,240
neurotransmitter chemicals electrical

1296
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:59,820
impulses and that's in neurons you're

1297
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,390
talking about distressing because here's

1298
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,390
the deal

1299
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:07,890
we our brains get dirty toxins in them

1300
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:10,920
heavy metals mercury aluminum cadmium

1301
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:12,720
lead nickel copper they get into her

1302
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,360
brain you know someone said to me they

1303
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,650
were like hey I don't have any metal in

1304
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,940
my head what are you talking about he

1305
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,310
said you ever have a fluoride treatment

1306
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,400
did you ever have allergy I had tons of

1307
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:24,930
those all through my life I go that's a

1308
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,440
byproduct of aluminum right they're

1309
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:30,780
byproduct of aluminum means it's still

1310
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,090
aluminum it is part aluminum in a

1311
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,340
different form it goes to the brain

1312
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:36,960
directly so when you have that fluoride

1313
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,120
treatment you're getting aluminum in

1314
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,860
there it's in there has it left no

1315
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,590
there's nothing you're doing in your

1316
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:45,690
life to remove it we also get mercury in

1317
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:47,970
the brain really easy we come into this

1318
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:50,070
world with mercury in us from our

1319
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,870
forefathers and foremothers well that's

1320
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,450
the whole thing our ancestors give us

1321
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:56,730
mercury it's passed down it doesn't just

1322
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,770
it doesn't leave it gets constantly

1323
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,170
passed down generation to generation to

1324
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,910
generation and it's it's in US and it's

1325
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,530
it's in our brain sits in other places

1326
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,060
and it even could trigger off higher

1327
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,980
anxiety and people it can trigger off

1328
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,630
depression having that mercury having

1329
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,940
those other metals inside of us and we

1330
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,610
collect them here their inner water

1331
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:17,280
there in other sources we just get it in

1332
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:20,070
us celery juice helps loosen up those

1333
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,320
metals stop stops them from oxidizing so

1334
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:24,480
they don't rust in our brain so they

1335
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,490
don't break down our brain tissue or

1336
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,440
glial cells and other parts of our brain

1337
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,970
it's critical it's it's just such a

1338
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,370
critical part of anxiety and depression

1339
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:34,320
celery just does help with it and I love

1340
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:37,140
that because we're talking about this

1341
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,550
simple antidote in one sense yeah which

1342
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,480
is actually impact mental and physical

1343
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,670
health you

1344
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,230
which is actually quite rare usually we

1345
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,580
look at them as separate usually it's

1346
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:46,350
true okay I do this for my body and I'll

1347
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,820
do this for my mind yeah but here you've

1348
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,740
got one thing that's actually helping

1349
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:51,360
both yeah I've run across so many people

1350
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,130
and seen it throughout the years and you

1351
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,560
see it on the internet now my depression

1352
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:57,300
is alleviating you know my anxiety is

1353
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,830
getting better things are getting better

1354
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,830
just from doing the celery juice

1355
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:03,930
crippling anxiety is so debilitating

1356
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:05,970
people can't leave their houses I've

1357
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,230
seen people suffer so greatly over the

1358
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,630
years you know and when you don't have

1359
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:11,370
anxiety you may not realize what they're

1360
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,390
going through you may not know what

1361
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,640
they're going through when you don't

1362
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,470
have anxiety because it's hard to like

1363
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,320
get into that person's shoes when you

1364
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,970
don't have it yourself it doesn't really

1365
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,410
make sense what do you mean you have

1366
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,180
anxiety what do you mean you can't

1367
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,620
function like what do you mean you can't

1368
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,540
get out of the house and get in the car

1369
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,820
and you got to take anxiety medications

1370
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:31,530
because here's a deal when you're when

1371
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,210
you haven't been to a lot of doctors and

1372
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:35,700
you haven't struggled with your health

1373
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:37,470
it's hard to get in touch with the ones

1374
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,970
that are struggling it's an entirely

1375
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,490
different crew you know when I get

1376
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,590
interviewed a lot when media interviews

1377
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,940
me and I tell them chronic illness

1378
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:46,650
people are suffering they're struggling

1379
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,900
they never put that in there ever that's

1380
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:50,580
why I have tremendous respect for your

1381
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,590
podcast for what we're doing right here

1382
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:54,630
because I'm able to talk about the ones

1383
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,490
that I fight for every single day so

1384
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,900
that's what I do that's what I do I

1385
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:00,180
fight for the people who are chronically

1386
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,920
ill and they don't get heard that's the

1387
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:04,050
thing I've been a messenger for them

1388
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,760
I've been a voice for them all these

1389
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,140
years to the people that are smart

1390
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,850
enough to know science and research

1391
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,710
hasn't had the answers for them and

1392
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:13,080
doctors know that they haven't had the

1393
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,940
answers that they needed to move forward

1394
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,440
and they suffered it struggled anxiety

1395
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,020
is one of those pieces of it it's

1396
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,760
crippling it can really stop someone

1397
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,790
from enjoying their life not enjoying

1398
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:26,160
working you know functioning taking care

1399
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,870
of things going to school and you know

1400
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,250
I've seen people hey my anxieties

1401
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:31,590
starting to alleviate a little bit more

1402
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:33,630
and it's worth everything it is worth

1403
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:37,800
even if you knock down that anxiety down

1404
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:40,030
50% 25% the difference is someone being

1405
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,280
able to stay out all day or so

1406
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:44,470
good day in their career or start

1407
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,420
writing or do something with their life

1408
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,400
think about how empowering that is and

1409
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,560
celery juice when that does that for

1410
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,090
somebody with anxiety and you see that

1411
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,530
happen you're like oh my god I'm gonna

1412
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,090
fight for this I'm gonna fight for the

1413
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,710
celery juice I don't care what it takes

1414
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,990
I'm gonna put myself on the firing line

1415
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:00,940
let's get this stuff out there more and

1416
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:02,500
more for people absolutely and I love

1417
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,290
what you said that it's really been this

1418
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,370
organic emerging thing like it's

1419
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:09,070
happening organically it hasn't been

1420
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:11,050
funded it hasn't had any money put into

1421
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:13,300
it an investment it's been organic it's

1422
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:14,830
very first of people which is amazing

1423
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,390
but you've also had organically a lot of

1424
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:18,040
celebrities and influences reach out to

1425
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:20,050
you yeah yeah who've become fans of your

1426
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,790
work and supporters of you yeah and you

1427
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,110
know I was I was asked recently too

1428
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,640
about this and he said well what are

1429
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:28,000
they be what are they being paid to do

1430
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,770
it said there's not one celebrity I know

1431
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,450
I know but it's a really good point

1432
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,980
because people think it they're like

1433
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:35,050
what are they getting out of this what

1434
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,370
do you mean what are they getting us let

1435
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:38,350
me tell you something about celebrities

1436
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,300
that I know anyway okay I'm gonna be

1437
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,700
straight out okay they actually care

1438
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:45,340
about people suffering they actually

1439
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,590
have tremendous compassion they actually

1440
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,480
care about their fans their followers

1441
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:52,690
they care about people on the planet and

and this podcast has been such an

1474
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,760
education for me

1475
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,410
I hope that everyone listening and

1476
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,430
watching I've been able to ask some of

1477
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,650
those questions that you will be

1478
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,780
thinking about too because I'm coming at

1479
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:03,550
a point of just learning being a student

1480
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,410
and someone who wants to experiment with

1481
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:07,780
this so all of my questions have been

1482
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:09,910
from my own desire to be an experimental

1483
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,470
with this I'm excited to see its impact

1484
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,330
on my life and I'm hoping everyone

1485
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,500
listening and watching today has got

1486
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,490
some of the information to get you going

1487
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,960
but I really really hope that you're

1488
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,400
gonna go and get the book because the

1489
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,020
books gonna break it down for you

1490
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,080
yeah the books gonna stop you from doing

1491
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:25,300
a one-week test which is a fad to

1492
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,500
actually making it sustainable and one

1493
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,180
of the biggest reasons I see the

1494
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,500
difference between us having a habit

1495
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,450
that we do for one week versus

1496
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,670
sustainable is one we're deeply

1497
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:34,930
convinced of the reasons when you've sat

1498
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,280
here and you've read this book and after

1499
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:38,830
you've read this book if you haven't got

1500
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,050
every reason you need to go and drink

1501
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,640
celery juice the rest of your life then

1502
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:43,750
that will be harder to give up yeah

1503
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,160

1504
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,020

1515
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,660
final five these are final five

1516
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:10,840
questions usually answers are either one

1517
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:13,240
word or one sentence maximum so this is

1518
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,040

1520
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,750

real your insights are awesome so I'm

1523
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:27,970
gonna try and get you to one word or one

1524
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:30,120
so question number one is what's the

1525
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:32,290
biggest health myth you've ever heard

1526
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:37,630
there's so many of them tell us your

1527
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:41,010
favorite one alright metabolism okay god

1528
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:41,010
yeah I'm gonna let you tell me

1529
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,360
metabolism just means that were alive

1530
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:48,310
the discovery of metabolism just means

1531
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,680
that we're alive we're living we have

1532
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:54,120
blood throwing flowing through us okay

1533
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:56,440
and that no one really knew that really

1534
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:59,170
metabolism was just the discovery of hey

1535
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,720
you're you're eating you're burning fuel

1536
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:05,260
you're a living organism you're a living

1537
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:07,540
being right but it's not why people gain

1538
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,850
weight slow metabolism

1539
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,520
and that's one of the greatest myths out

1540
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:14,860
there they're gaining weight from livers

1541
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:17,170
that are stagnant and sluggish

1542
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:19,150
everybody's livers are bombarded they're

1543
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,340
toxic that's why I came out with liver

1544
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,380
rescue the book because their livers are

1545
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,750
challenged and they're filled with

1546
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:28,120
toxins and that's what puts the weight

1547
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:30,100
on that's what makes things get the

1548
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,650
lymphatic system gets swollen with water

1549
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,710
the weight comes on the belly fat it's

1550
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:37,810
from a liver of weak liver sick liver

1551
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,850
stagnant sluggish liver it's not from

1552
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:41,530
metabolism still to this day I'm sure

1553
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,540
everybody in the audience right now my

1554
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:45,550
god who's been totally just fed met

1555
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,170
metabolism metabolism for the last 30 40

1556
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:49,090
50 whatever it is they're just gonna be

1557
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,620
all upset but I just trying to drop the

1558
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:52,150
truth on you on that one it's a liver

1559
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,100
you take care of your liver and that's

1560
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:56,050
that you take care of that and then

1561
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,030
everything starts getting better with

1562
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:59,560
whey and what we think is metabolism

00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,940

00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:03,450
green is great leafy greens are good

1620
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:05,310
awesome okay question four tell us about

1621
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:06,750
the top three herbs that you couldn't

1622
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,819
live with that lemon balm can't live

1623
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,770
without it helps the neurological system

1624
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:12,839
I've used it to actually help people

1625
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:15,540
with anxiety depression of course but

1626
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:20,400
also with neurological problems tics

1627
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:22,619
spasms tingles numbness its antiviral

1628
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,750
too like celery juice when you bring

1629
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:27,329
that lemon balm in there it's a big deal

1630
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:28,589
that one nettle leaf another incredible

1631
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:29,940
herb without a doubt I've been

1632
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:31,680
recommending it since I was a kid

1633
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,200
because of spirits it's literally is

1634
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,450
right off the start recommending it so

1635
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,089
nettle leaf that's anti-inflammatory of

1636
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:41,609
course why it also is antiviral in its

1637
00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:44,220
own right great medicine and of course

1638
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:46,470
cook immuno to tumeric you know which is

1639
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,240
spice wouldn't arise them but tumeric

1640
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:50,040
it's in it's amazing so I like that

1641
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,960
won't even know it's you know but you

1642
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,849
got the yeah lemon balm nettle leaf and

1643
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,700
then licorice roots another one amazing

1644
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:59,310
and the final five question five what's

1645
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,650
the best way we can all start listening

1646
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:04,290
to our body more because I think for so

1647
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:06,300
many of us we are constant radical but

1648
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:09,000
changes right we're constantly just like

1649
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,980
you could be going through pain and deal

1650
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,540
and just having it there and sit there

1651
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,980
for so long without listening how do how

1652
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,930
do people people we may not all be able

1653
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,250
to listen to spirits or channel or learn

1654
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:19,260
but how can we listen to our bodies

1655
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:21,329
better there's one thing that people

1656
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,579
have to realize it's one of the most

1657
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:26,609
incredible ones that when we get sick

1658
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:29,010
it's not our body letting us down it's

1659
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:31,180
not our bodies being faulty it's not our

1660
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:34,220
body being a bad

1661
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:37,190
physical you know aspect of us it's not

1662
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:39,910
it's it's not our body giving up on us

1663
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:42,799
and most importantly it's not our body

1664
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:44,749
destroying us or going after immune

1665
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:46,729
system or going after our organs or

1666
00:57:44,749 --> 00:57:49,309
going after anything what I'm trying to

1667
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:51,440
say is your body doesn't hurt you it

1668
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:54,920
doesn't destroy you it doesn't go after

1669
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,319
anything and we need to know that our

1670
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,299
body never attacks itself and it's the

1671
00:57:57,319 --> 00:58:01,940
first thing everybody thinks they think

1672
00:57:59,299 --> 00:58:02,569
their body's failing so no matter what

1673
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,029
okay

1674
00:58:02,569 --> 00:58:07,369
there's one of the greatest tools is if

1675
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:10,670
you start experiencing anything mental

1676
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:13,519
emotional physical your body is not

1677
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:15,710
going after you are hurting you or

1678
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,900
attacking you that's the most important

1679
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:19,430
that can protect you because we can't

1680
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,289
there's there's people out there you can

1681
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:23,210
tell them what what to do on how to

1682
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:25,369
listen to their body or anything but

1683
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,869
they might they might not be able to do

1684
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:28,910
it or they might be too busy or forget

1685
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:30,920
it but what they will do is their body's

1686
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:32,720
letting them down the minute as an

1687
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:35,599
athlete you think your body's failing

1688
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,999
you anything it's just in life when

1689
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:40,460
we're sick we think our body has now

1690
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:42,499
said hey we're not helping you I'm not

1691
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,059
helping you and that's it if you could

1692
00:58:42,499 --> 00:58:46,190
if you know your body loves you

1693
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:48,289
unconditionally it's there for you it's

1694
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:51,259
fighting for you in ways you cannot even

1695
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:53,690
imagine that can bring you peace and get

1696
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:55,339
you to where you need to be faster and

1697
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:57,200
better well I was not expecting that

1698
00:58:55,339 --> 00:58:58,969
once but I love Don so that that

1699
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,799
judgment that we place on our body

1700
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:02,569
immediately is actually one of the most

1701
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,150
negative things it is like that Lang the

1702
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:06,890
most that language around am i he's

1703
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,900
attacking me my body's letting me down

1704
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,589
my body's failing yes my body's not

1705
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,150
strong enough

1706
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:13,549
yes that language is actually

1707
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:15,289
programming us to lead to not doing

1708
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:18,049
anything about see it's an evil seed

1709
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:19,309
that sits inside every human being so no

1710
00:59:18,049 --> 00:59:20,599
matter what you're doing whether you're

1711
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:22,099
meditating on top of the mountain

1712
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:25,009
wherever you are it doesn't matter the

1713
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:27,890
minute something's going wrong you go

1714
00:59:25,009 --> 00:59:29,690
right to my body is now wait a minute

1715
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:31,160
turning against me in the moment and

1716
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:33,829
what do I need to do to fix it no it's

1717
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,509
not turning against you that's how it

1718
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:37,130
works that is such an awesome once man I

1719
00:59:35,509 --> 00:59:39,109
absolutely love that I hope that message

1720
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:40,880
is resonating very very clear the way we

1721
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:44,239
think about a body talk about our body

1722
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,910
talk to our body itself is gonna have a

1723
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:46,620
huge impact

01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,530
do a reading with yet some advice I

1745
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:29,910
genuinely am i I want to do that can't

1746
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:31,500
wait here we're gonna do it yeah

1747
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:34,380
absolutely I think I think what you said

1748
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:36,390
is so true that until we've really go

1749
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:39,210
through pain and that's how it was for

1750
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:40,980
me too I think because I'd I felt like

1751
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:44,130
I'd mastered my mind and neglected my

1752
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:46,740
body yeah and so when my body started to

1753
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:48,900
give me signs that it needed more love

1754
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,160
and care that's when I started to

1755
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,080
realize because while you're young you

1756
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,210
just feel like Superman yeah and you

1757
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:56,190
feel like nothing's gonna happen and so

1758
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,480
I totally get you and so if anyone is

1759
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:59,430
