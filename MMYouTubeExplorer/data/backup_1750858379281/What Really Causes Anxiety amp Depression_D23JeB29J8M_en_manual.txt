Depression.
[3.76 - 6.72] two things so many people are going
through these days i'm going to be
[6.72 - 9.84] covering the true
causes of anxiety and depression because
[9.84 - 14.24] it's a mystery
a mystery for so many people millions
[14.24 - 18.48] upon millions of people
have mysterious anxiety and depression
[18.48 - 22.96] it's really hard on people so
to talk about what people experience
[22.96 - 25.52] when they're
living with anxiety when they're living
[25.52 - 30.80] with depression and how debilitating
these symptoms can be how it affects
[30.80 - 33.28] your life
you guys probably know somebody with
[33.28 - 35.92] anxiety you probably know somebody with
depression
[35.92 - 40.08] so let's get down to it that's what we
have to do nobody's depression
[40.08 - 45.76] nobody's anxiety is the same there's
they're all unique your anxiety is
[45.76 - 48.72] unique
to you and what's happening inside your
[48.72 - 51.36] body
they're not the same you just can't
[51.36 - 54.96] classify it you can't tag it like that
you got anxiety okay
[54.96 - 58.40] well you got anxiety too well you're
seeing all your symptoms are identical
[58.40 - 61.04] that's
really really impossible it's always

[218.96 - 222.56] have you seen 10 doctors have you seen
three are you a lucky person where
[222.56 - 225.04] you're not so
sick and you just got your first symptom
[225.04 - 228.16] or two and you saw an alternative doctor
or
[228.16 - 232.16] you saw a naturopath or maybe you saw
you know your regular doctor and they
[232.16 - 235.12] did a little blood work and you got a
little symptom here and there and you're
[235.12 - 237.92] just
starting to embark on your journey of
[237.92 - 241.20] cleaning up your foods and
looking on the internet for answers and
[241.20 - 243.68] stuff if you're in that great position
that's great
[243.68 - 246.72] but there's a lot of people that are
really sick really struggling the
[246.72 - 250.96] medical medium information
was for those people and has been and
[250.96 - 254.32] got people
off of mattress island if you guys want
[254.32 - 257.20] to know what mattress island is many of
you guys know
[257.20 - 261.28] mattress island is when you're when
you're in bed and you're in bed too long
[261.28 - 264.88] you're in bed a lot you spend a lot of
time on the mattress you spend a lot of
[264.88 - 268.00] time
on the couch couch island mattress
[268.00 - 271.12] island
it's not a fun place and so many people
[271.12 - 274.08] have been there and had to find the
medical medium information
[274.08 - 277.12] so you know here's a point right here
before we go on with anxiety we're going
[277.12 - 279.92] to cover we're going to cover all the
details about anxiety
[279.92 - 283.76] what kind of different versions of
anxiety what kind of different versions
[283.76 - 285.92] of depression and what the true causes
are
[285.92 - 289.76] before we go into that listen i want to
tell you guys whether you're plant-based
[289.76 - 294.72] whether you're vegan whether you're
paleo whether you're vegetarian whether
[294.72 - 299.12] you're animal protein whether you're
keto animal protein right whether you're
[299.12 - 302.80] keto plant-based
whether you're keto vegan whether you're
[302.80 - 305.84] carnivore
whether you're balanced diet whether
[305.84 - 309.44] you're intuitive eating
whether you're food combining or any
[309.44 - 313.68] other diet belief system there is and
there's a lot of them out there
[313.68 - 317.76] everyone has something in common
remember this
[317.76 - 322.16] they all get sick remember this they all
get sick
[322.16 - 325.36] that's how it's been and that's what
happened so
[325.36 - 328.48] sure you might have things under control
you cleaned up your diet
[328.48 - 331.60] maybe you're on a plant-based diet but
plant-based people
[331.60 - 334.96] they quit eating plant-based they run to
eating animal protein they go
[334.96 - 338.32] start bringing in salmon they start
bringing in eggs oh should i be eating
[338.32 - 341.04] eggs
should i be eating salmon should i be
[341.04 - 345.28] eating turkey maybe i need my protein
maybe that's why i'm getting symptoms
[345.28 - 348.56] same thing with the vegans it's like
well wait a minute maybe
[348.56 - 352.08] maybe beans aren't cutting it maybe
beans got too much of something
[352.08 - 355.44] bad in them and maybe i need to start
eating animal protein and
[355.44 - 358.48] that's how it works same thing with
paleo people same thing with animal
[358.48 - 360.88] protein people they're like should i go
plant-based
[360.88 - 365.92] what am i doing wrong why am i getting
sick and the whole thing is this is that
[365.92 - 368.16] what we have to understand something is
that
[368.16 - 371.76] with the food wars and with the
different diet belief systems
[371.76 - 376.88] everybody eventually gets sick either
they've been sick in the past they get
[376.88 - 380.32] sick again in the present
or they get sick in the future that's
[380.32 - 383.52] what everybody has in common whether
anybody likes it or not
[383.52 - 386.08] and if you're young and you feel
indestructible and you haven't got there
[386.08 - 389.20] yet you're going to get sick later on
down the road you know because
[389.20 - 392.80] everybody does i talk to doctors all the
time and
[392.80 - 395.60] when i talk to doctors they're like
they'll they'll say it too you're like
[395.60 - 398.16] you're right
everybody's gonna have a thyroid problem
[398.16 - 402.08] later on ever
you're right aw because you nailed it
[402.08 - 405.36] you're right everybody you told me that
20 years ago and yes
[405.36 - 409.28] everybody's getting thyroid problems
they get them before they turn 30 now
[409.28 - 411.76] instead they used to get them before
they turned 50
[411.76 - 415.04] and that's how it is so if they get sick
it's
[415.04 - 418.80] that's what it is everybody has
something in common regardless of the
[418.80 - 422.48] diet belief system
and that's why there's one thing that's
[422.48 - 425.36] really important about the medical
medium information there's no
[425.36 - 430.64] diet belief system here so that's one
thing to know so if you're new here
[430.64 - 434.56] there's no diet belief system because
diet belief systems
[434.56 - 439.04] get you trapped and then you don't heal
because there has to be something more
[439.04 - 442.80] to that
because plant-based people get sick
[442.80 - 445.68] vegans get sick
vegetarians get sick animal protein
[445.68 - 449.60] people get sick keto people get sick
everybody gets sick whatever diet
[449.60 - 452.56] beliefs and belief system that they're
subscribed to
[452.56 - 456.80] or they're attached to so really
important to know
[456.80 - 460.32] that there's not that here that's the
last
[460.32 - 464.48] thing we have going on instead what we
have is tools
[464.48 - 470.40] that you can apply and plug into your
diet belief system and that's the whole
[470.40 - 473.12] thing
actual tools and answers for instance
[473.12 - 476.40] like the heavy metal detox smoothie
right there so
[476.40 - 480.16] that's the medical medium heavy metal
detox movie i made it for dinner tonight
[480.16 - 484.32] you guys which i'm really excited about
and talking about the heavy metal detox
[484.32 - 489.20] smoothie because why
hmm anxiety why uh depression
[489.20 - 493.68] well nobody knew what causes those until
the medical media books were published
[493.68 - 497.20] until all that stuff happened what
causes anxiety
[497.20 - 500.72] what causes mystery depression yeah you
got it toxic
[500.72 - 508.00] heavy metals mercury aluminum
copper in the brain toxic heavy metals
[508.00 - 511.44] are responsible
for anxiety that's one of the main
[511.44 - 515.36] causes of anxiety and depression
so then and that leads to a lot of
[515.36 - 520.72] different conditions you guys bipolar
asperger's focus in concentration adhd
[520.72 - 524.88] ocd
all of that it leads to lots of that
[524.88 - 528.72] even schizophrenia
all of it so i mean you know and you
[528.72 - 531.20] know what's funny about science and
research you just want to say this
[531.20 - 534.88] before we go into this
science and research science and
[534.88 - 537.76] research believes you know your bipolar
is just
[537.76 - 542.16] a mystery and they believe that it's
just you being up or down
[542.16 - 545.52] you know you're just you're just that
kind of person where
[545.52 - 548.40] there's no reason why you're doing this
you're just all over the place you're
[548.40 - 551.04] either north or south how about that for
a diagnosis
[551.04 - 554.16] incredible all the money in science and
research
[554.16 - 558.32] all the incredible you know like doctors
and technology that we have today and
[558.32 - 562.96] the best they have for bipolar
is we don't know why you're all over the
[562.96 - 566.48] place
um sir uh we
[566.48 - 572.80] ma'am we don't know why you're up manic
boom down crashed and depressed um
[572.80 - 576.08] we're just scratching our heads with all
the science and technology we
[576.08 - 579.20] have that's what science research has
we're either going to say
[579.20 - 582.72] maybe it's genetic or maybe we'll just
say um
[582.72 - 586.00] let's see maybe you need a psychiatrist
try that
[586.00 - 589.36] and then um maybe we're just going to
label this
[589.36 - 593.68] this illness and label it bipolar what a
brilliant label
[593.68 - 597.04] right meaning north and south isn't that
brilliant
[597.04 - 600.64] oh my god it's unbelievable it's an
insult it's really disgusting it's
[600.64 - 603.92] negligence at its best with science and
research that's just one
[603.92 - 609.84] example of what's happening and
you know the whole thing is it's
[609.84 - 614.32] critical to know why
you have a problem and it's in your way
[614.32 - 619.04] and it's impeding your quality of life
and it's like in the way of things you
[619.04 - 621.52] want to do
and and we're going to cover that about
[621.52 - 624.64] anxiety we're going to talk about that
in the whole bit and
[624.64 - 627.52] the whole thing with the diet belief
systems is the reason why you won't find
[627.52 - 630.56] that here is because this is about
answers and tools
[630.56 - 634.80] and that's what's critical it's about
how to use things therapeutically
[634.80 - 638.72] that's what it's about medical medium is
not a plant-based diet medical medium is
[638.72 - 641.84] not an animal-based diet medical
medium is not any of those in any way
[641.84 - 646.00] which way possible
it's all these answers that can be
[646.00 - 651.84] plugged into someone's belief system
to help them recover and heal because
[651.84 - 655.76] what i've noticed and many other people
have over the decades
[655.76 - 659.04] is whatever you try you're still going
to end up with a problem and get sick in
[659.04 - 660.96] the whole
the whole thing there's people out there
[660.96 - 663.04] i thought they were on the best
plant-based
[663.04 - 667.44] diet possible and they got sick and then
they're flip-flopping and the same thing
[667.44 - 670.80] with people with the animal protein
diets the best animal product protein
[670.80 - 673.28] diets possible
and they're flip-flopping they're going
[673.28 - 677.68] to the other side so it's
it's been like that all along but here's
[677.68 - 682.00] the difference now
it's getting worse and worse and worse
[682.00 - 685.76] 30 years ago the amount of anxiety cases
that i used to see
[685.76 - 690.64] 30 years ago were a fraction of what
they are today and that's with organic
[690.64 - 692.64] food here
that's what people are switching up
[692.64 - 695.92] their diets getting rid of fast food
that's what people do in their peanut
[695.92 - 698.16] butter
their peanut butter smoothie bowls
[698.16 - 702.08] that's what people do in their protein
shakes and anxiety is skyrocketing
[702.08 - 705.68] even with all the good things we're
talking about we're bringing in
[705.68 - 708.72] that's what's happening here it's
unbelievable so
[708.72 - 712.96] um you guys you know these things are so
important feel free
[712.96 - 716.56] to bring what information that you learn
here to your doctor
[716.56 - 721.04] and to your health care provider to your
health care practitioner to whoever that
[721.04 - 724.08] takes care of your health feel feel free
i'm going to breed how to cleanse the
[724.08 - 727.84] heal a little bit right here okay
and we're going to talk about anxiety
[727.84 - 732.00] the true cost and then we're going to
cover through all the different levels
[732.00 - 734.72] of anxiety
and you might know somebody that's
[734.72 - 738.72] dealing with some type of anxiety so
we're going to cover
[738.72 - 742.24] the first type of anxiety in a minute
we're going to go into emotional anxiety

emotional anxiety so we're going to
[745.28 - 748.56] cover in that too

[900.24 - 903.68] let me go and hop on the internet um
toxic heavy metals
[903.68 - 907.36] causing anxiety first of all if it even
is on the internet and says that it came
[907.36 - 911.60] from here but
most importantly when you go you might
[911.60 - 915.84] see a whole bunch of things like um
corella can get my metals out let me go
[915.84 - 919.12] and do that um
activated charcoal can get my metals out
[919.12 - 924.00] no
no bad no corella can't get
[924.00 - 928.48] metals out you know worth the life of it
it can't get metals out of somebody
[928.48 - 932.80] activated charcoal terrible to take
terrible to take
[932.80 - 937.68] internally a terrible thing to do and
activate the charcoal internally with
[937.68 - 940.00] anybody who has bloating gut problems
gut
[940.00 - 943.84] issues sensitivities in the gut inflamed
intestinal linings
[943.84 - 947.28] gallbladder trouble liver issues
stagnant sluggish liver
[947.28 - 951.76] lymphatic issues taking activated
charcoal epic disaster
[951.76 - 955.04] just so you know and it won't remove
toxic heavy metals because it doesn't
[955.04 - 958.16] there's no proof it never had there's no
study that can
[958.16 - 961.68] show it actually grabbing metals it's
one of those those
[961.68 - 966.16] bad ideas that's number one corella so
your other oh anthony says toxic heavy
[966.16 - 969.04] metals
is behind my anxiety let me go on here
[969.04 - 973.28] online oh wait
corella yeah nice try corella this is
[973.28 - 976.56] terrible bacteria in almost every one of
those different
[976.56 - 980.40] batches that are out there i've seen
corella barrel people like
[980.40 - 983.84] get them so sick where they're in the
hospital
[983.84 - 987.92] vomiting and diarrhea for days at a time
and the doctor's like i don't know maybe
[987.92 - 992.56] you got food poisoning i don't know
no corella bad bad and you'll still see
[992.56 - 995.76] influencers today with all the work i've
done try to let people know that it
[995.76 - 999.44] doesn't get
it doesn't get metals out and all the
[999.44 - 1002.24] work i've done all these years
still see a new influencer that's
[1002.24 - 1004.80] remember because no one knows what's
going on
[1004.80 - 1007.76] another five years later there's all
these influencers that are being told
[1007.76 - 1010.00] corella
and they're just out there saying i'm
[1010.00 - 1013.68] taking my corella got it mixed up here
in my drink in my smoothie
[1013.68 - 1016.80] it's like first of all no metals are
going to come out second of all
[1016.80 - 1020.32] terrible for you and i know listen i
know it's got nutrients in it don't get
[1020.32 - 1024.08] me wrong but i'm just saying
that's where it goes wrong these other
[1024.08 - 1027.52] avenues
and activated charcoal awful so that's a
[1027.52 - 1031.52] couple things too so
toxic heavy metals such as mercury
[1031.52 - 1036.56] aluminum and copper
okay and viral issues
[1036.56 - 1040.72] when it comes down to anxiety depression
a lot of times there's a viral issue
[1040.72 - 1043.12] involved
so we have to know that the the
[1043.12 - 1047.68] epstein-barr is one of the most
infamous viruses i talk about i mean
[1047.68 - 1050.24] that's the one
that actually is behind a lot of
[1050.24 - 1054.72] depression a lot of anxiety now
you don't even have to have any any ebv
[1054.72 - 1058.64] you don't even have to have
ebv symptoms which nobody knew existed
[1058.64 - 1062.08] as far as the symptoms go until the
publications of medical media book one
[1062.08 - 1066.00] but and how that works but the point is
it's it's a combination
[1066.00 - 1069.92] of both epstein-barr for a lot of people
and toxic heavy metals because here's
[1069.92 - 1073.28] how it works
if you're viral and you have it in your
[1073.28 - 1076.72] liver and it's low grade it's been there
for decades
[1076.72 - 1080.08] it ends up feeding on foods and what its
favorite
[1080.08 - 1087.04] food is is mercury mercury
aluminum copper so when the viruses
[1087.04 - 1093.28] feed off of mercury they go to bathroom
yes viruses eat that's advanced medical
[1093.28 - 1095.76] information
ahead of science and research and when
[1095.76 - 1100.88] viruses eat they release
a toxic heavy metal byproduct
[1100.88 - 1103.92] so it's called the neurotoxin that
neurotoxin
[1103.92 - 1107.32] floats around and goes to the brain it's
short circuits
[1107.32 - 1112.08] neurotransmitter chemicals it lands on
neurons it saturates neurons
[1112.08 - 1115.28] causing varieties of anxiety and
depression
[1115.28 - 1118.48] you can have that going but you don't
even have to have the viral issue
[1118.48 - 1122.24] you can be without the viral issue and
be straight toxic heavy metals
[1122.24 - 1125.92] straight mercury in your system straight
aluminum in your system oh i don't have
[1125.92 - 1128.32] mercury in my system there's no way i
don't have
[1128.32 - 1132.08] oh i gotta had a mercury test i don't
have mercury in my system yeah you do
[1132.08 - 1136.96] everybody does it gets passed on from
generation to generation
[1136.96 - 1143.04] and it settles in our organs deep
in our organs so it's really important
[1143.04 - 1145.92] to know like our brain
settles in our brain and i'm going to
[1145.92 - 1150.40] talk about what it does there tonight
like why do we get the anxiety
[1150.40 - 1157.28] and you know the whole thing no one knew
viruses and toxic heavy metals
[1157.28 - 1160.64] are behind anxiety depression that never
existed
[1160.64 - 1164.96] anywhere except for medical medium
information so if you know it
[1164.96 - 1168.32] never existed anywhere else but you're
going to hear about it more because of
[1168.32 - 1172.08] millions and millions of books
from the medical medium series have been
[1172.08 - 1175.60] circulating around the world
and so people get a little tidbit here
[1175.60 - 1178.96] and they're like oh yeah medals
somebody might say metals might behind
[1178.96 - 1183.36] that metals might be behind adhd metals
might behind brain brain fog
[1183.36 - 1186.96] comes from the medical medium literature
medical medium information
[1186.96 - 1193.44] um and it's behind mystery depression
toxic heavy metals are behind anxiety
[1193.44 - 1197.44] you have to have the
metals there so i'm going to talk about
[1197.44 - 1201.12] also the best stuff to use like i got
that medical medium heavy metal detox
[1201.12 - 1204.24] smoothie right here so if you want to
get metals out
[1204.24 - 1207.44] this is what you got to do and i'm going
to talk about talk about how and
[1207.44 - 1211.04] and everything and what we what you know
i put in here with spirit compassion and
[1211.04 - 1214.40] i put in here
the whole bit how it works and in the
[1214.40 - 1218.64] book the heavy metal detox cleanse so
then you can learn how to get metals out
[1218.64 - 1222.64] that way
i saw comments recently on some of the
[1222.64 - 1224.96] lives
i saw comments in some other places
[1224.96 - 1228.80] people leave on the youtube if you you
know check out my youtube right
[1228.80 - 1234.72] and people say their anxiety
has dissipated has just disappeared when
[1234.72 - 1237.92] they did the heavy metal detox cleanse
when they did the heavy metal detox
[1237.92 - 1240.00] smoothies when they do the medical
medium
[1240.00 - 1243.04] information that they got rid of
horrific
[1243.04 - 1246.40] horrendous anxiety that was crippling
but
[1246.40 - 1250.96] there's thousands of people that have
gotten themselves recovered and got
[1250.96 - 1256.16] their lives back with anxiety
and depression over the years really
[1256.16 - 1259.28] over the years i hope i'm not running
this by you guys too fast i'm talking a
[1259.28 - 1261.44] little quicker because you wouldn't
believe how much i have to
[1261.44 - 1267.44] be covered tonight so so um we have
we have in almost an hour so let's do it
[1267.44 - 1270.64] and
you know the whole thing is it's not
[1270.64 - 1274.88] just removing the toxic heavy metals
it's repairing
[1274.88 - 1279.68] the damage here's something to
digest right here here's something to
[1279.68 - 1282.40] take in you guys when a toxic heavy
metal
[1282.40 - 1290.32] sits on a neuron in your brain or sits
on organ tissue it saturates that organ
[1290.32 - 1294.56] tissue
okay it ends up burning a hole
[1294.56 - 1297.92] and that's what it does a microscopic
hole
[1297.92 - 1304.64] because it by it has byproduct
metal oxidizes inside our brain and body
[1304.64 - 1308.48] it's advanced medical information from
um from the medical medium information
[1308.48 - 1313.12] so and what it does is
when toxic heavy metals oxidize in our
[1313.12 - 1315.84] organs
whether it's in our liver whether it's
[1315.84 - 1321.52] in our brain whether it's inner spleen
anywhere in our bodies when it oxidizes
[1321.52 - 1326.32] it leaves residue that's toxic behind it
and it starts to rust
[1326.32 - 1332.48] out holes in tissue it damages cells
tissue is what it does when toxic heavy
[1332.48 - 1338.24] metals sit on a neurotransmitter
meaning it destroys it weakens it
[1338.24 - 1341.60] dehydrates it
when a toxic heavy metal sits on a
[1341.60 - 1345.36] neuron
it weakens it it short-circuits it so
[1345.36 - 1348.64] when you have when you have electrical
impulses firing all around through the
[1348.64 - 1351.84] brain
that are supposed to keep us focused on
[1351.84 - 1355.12] spot on with our
everything you know able to articulate
[1355.12 - 1359.68] able able to communicate
able to talk able to have fun able to
[1359.68 - 1363.12] kind of feel excitement
able to actually all these things and
[1363.12 - 1366.40] multitask and to be on our game and to
be down on
[1366.40 - 1369.84] like totally going everything going
great and how we feel
[1369.84 - 1375.44] focus concentration like boom all of it
with all of that when our neurons are
[1375.44 - 1379.44] saturated with toxic heavy metals
and those electrical impulses that are
[1379.44 - 1383.76] firing in our brain hit those
neurons that are that are saturated with
[1383.76 - 1387.36] the metals and it hits the metal
it short circuits it weakens the
[1387.36 - 1392.32] electrical impulse and then we're like
i got i don't know i got some brain fog
[1392.32 - 1396.96] i'm a little more tired i really
and i'm just i got some anxiety i can't
[1396.96 - 1400.24] sit still i
i feel like i don't know i'm kind of
[1400.24 - 1403.28] clammy palms i don't want to really talk
to this person
[1403.28 - 1406.72] i feel like i can't get my words out
right um
[1406.72 - 1410.32] i'm just i feel like my skin's crawling
i want to jump out of my skin
[1410.32 - 1415.12] um i can't focus i just need to do
something i like to do i can't do this
[1415.12 - 1418.48] stuff i don't like to do because what i
do i just get totally out of it
[1418.48 - 1422.88] like all these different things you know
and when someone asks anything of me i
[1422.88 - 1425.84] just
i'm not responsive i can't come up with
[1425.84 - 1429.76] an answer in time
i can't really you know focus on what
[1429.76 - 1432.72] i'm saying when i stand there and
somebody's talking to me i'm trying to
[1432.72 - 1435.36] think about the next thing i'm going to
say but i don't know what i'm going to
[1435.36 - 1437.60] say
and all of these things happen these are
[1437.60 - 1440.80] just i'm just going over a couple little
things so we're going to cut into it
[1440.80 - 1445.28] let's go in just a little bit more so in
this book cleanse the heel
[1445.28 - 1450.32] i talk about supplements and dosages
right here for helping to repair
[1450.32 - 1456.24] injuries caused by these toxic heavy
metals causing depression and anxiety
[1456.96 - 1461.04] so um kale says what if you have anxiety
depression
[1461.04 - 1465.52] acne fatigue all of the above okay what
you do is you take
[1465.52 - 1470.80] the symptom that's bugging you the most
this is what i would do this is just
[1470.80 - 1473.60] what i would do i would go to cleanse to
heal
[1473.60 - 1476.80] or you can bring it to your practitioner
doctor and i would
[1476.80 - 1479.84] go and i would take the symptoms that's
bothering you the most
[1479.84 - 1483.84] is fatigue bothering you the most and
then i would go in there
[1483.84 - 1486.80] and i would do the fatigue thing like i
would look at the protocol i would take
[1486.80 - 1490.16] a look and look at everything in the
back of the book okay
[1490.16 - 1493.84] and that's what i would do and i would
learn what the true cause of your
[1493.84 - 1496.16] fatigue is
and that's what i would do i'd be like
[1496.16 - 1499.84] what's the true cause of my fatigue
because i want to know i want to know
[1499.84 - 1503.44] the true cause of my fatigue
and once you do that and you start
[1503.44 - 1506.88] applying what's in cleanse to heal for
your fatigue
[1506.88 - 1510.16] or having your practitioner or your
doctor friend or anybody that you have
[1510.16 - 1513.60] helping you apply it you notice other
things
[1513.60 - 1517.20] start to go away like the acne will
start going away
[1517.20 - 1520.40] anxiety starts getting a little better
depression starts getting a little
[1520.40 - 1522.56] better
that's one way to go at it and you could
[1522.56 - 1525.36] also go at it individually you can go
with anxiety you can go with the
[1525.36 - 1529.76] depression
so let's talk about emotional anxiety
[1529.76 - 1534.16] so let's go in there next you guys i'm
gonna read comments too
[1534.16 - 1537.28] um does high dosage of vitamin c really
good
[1537.28 - 1543.76] high dosages of vitamin c kill viruses
that's really a great a great question
[1543.76 - 1545.84] here
you'll see in the supplements in the
[1545.84 - 1548.88] protocols and the dosages you'll see the
vitamin c
[1548.88 - 1552.00] and you'll see there's vit the medical
medium vitamin c shock
[1552.00 - 1560.56] therapy that's there for a reason
so it's really important to know so um
[1560.56 - 1564.48] and and the micro c is the one that i
like the best
[1564.48 - 1566.88] just looking at your comments i don't
want to try i don't want to miss too
[1566.88 - 1570.56] many i want to catch what i can
the micro microc is actually the one i
[1570.56 - 1572.88] use right here so there's different
vitamin c
[1572.88 - 1576.96] so yeah we can use the term vitamin c
but if it's not a really good one
[1576.96 - 1580.80] how much is it doing is it knocking down
viruses vitamin c does a couple of
[1580.80 - 1585.36] things okay
high dosages does help kill off viruses
[1585.36 - 1589.44] and that's why i've been recommending it
for years and years and years and years
[1589.44 - 1593.12] the medical medium vitamin c shock
therapy is there for a reason
[1593.12 - 1597.52] but what vitamin c is somebody using
what kind of vitamin c is somebody using
[1597.52 - 1600.80] that's a whole other game so the micro c
is the one i use
[1600.80 - 1604.32] that's my favorite i'm not sponsored by
this company okay there's a lot of
[1604.32 - 1606.88] companies like
you know wyman blueberries is the one i
[1606.88 - 1610.16] use for my heavy metal detox movies it's
the wyman
[1610.16 - 1613.44] wild blueberries i'm not sponsored by
the company i don't own wyman's
[1613.44 - 1616.88] people asset all the time they think i
own wyman's i get questioned on that
[1616.88 - 1620.00] there's even articles out there about
does he own wyman's
[1620.00 - 1624.00] you know what i mean i don't own vimergy
um but yeah best vitamin c
[1624.00 - 1627.44] right there it's amazing how many
stories go around but people just buy
[1627.44 - 1631.36] the bs they just meaning they
they believe in any story going around
[1631.36 - 1635.76] it's unbelievable anything
you put out on me it's just anybody will
[1635.76 - 1638.64] just bite it and be like oh it must be
true when it's not
[1638.64 - 1643.12] it's unbelievable and i stand behind
that so
[1643.12 - 1648.00] lemon balm is a big deal so lemon balm
the vimergy lemon balm is important too
[1648.00 - 1650.72] i'm going over some of these i'm looking
here
[1650.72 - 1656.64] so just bear with me a second you guys
one of the one of the most like
[1656.64 - 1660.72] incredible things that
i've like recommended over the years and
[1660.72 - 1664.08] so forth and i talk about in cleansing
heal is the lemon balm all right
[1664.08 - 1667.28] the lemon balm for anxiety is really
helpful but you know and
[1667.28 - 1671.12] and i love like if you go into the
anxiety section in the back of cleanse
[1671.12 - 1674.08] of heel you'll see
the dosages of lemon balm this is the
[1674.08 - 1676.80] vimergy lemon balm it's the cleanest
it's the greatest
[1676.80 - 1680.48] and you know people say to me they're
like oh why do you like vimergy
[1680.48 - 1685.28] right okay well how about this they're
the only company or the only company
[1685.28 - 1688.32] i've known
or no out of all the companies i know
[1688.32 - 1691.04] out there because i'm always wanting the
best for people out there
[1691.04 - 1696.80] the only company that independently
gets every single product tested for
[1696.80 - 1701.04] toxic heavy metals
it costs a fortune that's why companies
[1701.04 - 1703.76] won't do it
that's why companies won't do it and
[1703.76 - 1708.40] every single product they get
independently tested that's the
[1708.40 - 1711.36] difference right there
you might hear some company like that
[1711.36 - 1715.60] there's a lot of people you guys
that troll medical medium channels
[1715.60 - 1717.84] listening to me because they're
competitors
[1717.84 - 1721.12] in weird ways like authors that do
medical
[1721.12 - 1724.64] stuff and all that they just get upset
and jealous about all the advanced
[1724.64 - 1727.52] information from the
from medical media books and so forth
[1727.52 - 1732.08] but there's people out there
that are like um well and then they'll
[1732.08 - 1735.20] they'll hear me say this company's
independently tested by metal so then
[1735.20 - 1737.52] they'll tell people
they'll get they won't do it
[1737.52 - 1740.96] independently but oh we test for heavy
metals in one of our products we test
[1740.96 - 1743.92] for heavy metals it's just a scam out
there 24 7.
[1743.92 - 1747.44] but this company independently checks
tech gets
[1747.44 - 1750.88] sends it out and gets it tested for
toxic heavy metals
[1750.88 - 1754.80] costs a fortune that's just one example
you know and i'm saying that because
[1754.80 - 1758.40] a lot of people say supplements have
metals in them you know i mean
[1758.40 - 1761.52] you know that whole thing yeah bad
supplements do anyway
[1761.52 - 1765.76] that's incredible for anxiety that i've
you know that that's what i would do so
[1765.76 - 1769.68] panic attacks
that's what i'm talking about and i like
[1769.68 - 1773.68] the lemon bomb for panic attacks
i don't have panic attacks but if i had
[1773.68 - 1777.20] a panic attack
that's what i would do i would be doing
[1777.20 - 1780.88] the lemon bum and i would be doing the
dosages personally that's what i would
[1780.88 - 1783.36] do
in cleanse the heel on that that's a
[1783.36 - 1787.04] takeaway right here that's important
because it's one thing to talk about the
[1787.04 - 1789.52] causes of anxiety which i'm going to go
into
[1789.52 - 1794.40] it's another to actually have a takeaway
of what can i do what kind of what
[1794.40 - 1799.44] tool can i use and so that's important
so in the supplements
[1799.44 - 1802.72] in a protocol section in the back of
cleanse the heel
[1802.72 - 1806.80] you look up anxiety you'll see there's
lemon balm like as one of the listed
[1806.80 - 1810.88] supplements
so that's what i would do and um
[1810.88 - 1814.80] nerves get inflamed with anxiety so
here's the other thing
[1814.80 - 1821.44] the most critical nerve that gets
inflamed with your anxiety is your vagus
[1821.44 - 1825.60] nerve
that is the big one the other nerves
[1825.60 - 1829.68] that get inflamed with you that are
inflamed and are behind
[1829.68 - 1833.52] anxiety are your phrenic nerves your
phrenic nerves run
[1833.52 - 1836.96] down in through down through your neck
and down here like this they run like
[1836.96 - 1839.68] that
your phrenic nerves what they do is they
[1839.68 - 1842.72] light up
they get they just light up they get
[1842.72 - 1846.40] inflamed from both neurotoxins from
viruses
[1846.40 - 1850.32] and toxic heavy metals that are feeding
the viruses
[1850.32 - 1855.52] so these nerves these phrenic nerves get
inflamed and when they get inflamed
[1855.52 - 1859.92] you're you light up you're
hypersensitive you can be triggered easy
[1859.92 - 1863.60] you can be like you can you can get
emotional easy
[1863.60 - 1867.44] you can all these things it can throw
you in a panic attack
[1867.44 - 1871.60] your vagus nerve can tighten up your
throat and make you feel like you're
[1871.60 - 1874.80] you're choking
your your vagus nerve can tighten up
[1874.80 - 1877.84] your chest
make it hard for you to breathe and you
[1877.84 - 1881.36] feel like you got anxiety and you feel
like you're hyperventilating
[1881.36 - 1884.88] or even not even just that you feel like
you have tightness of the chest
[1884.88 - 1888.64] and it's it's hard and if you even focus
on your breath it's why
[1888.64 - 1891.20] it's why there's two kind of sides to
the story when it comes down to
[1891.20 - 1895.52] meditation this is an important point
so you guys hear this okay if you can
[1895.52 - 1898.08] all right um
if you got the patience for a second
[1898.08 - 1902.80] meditation okay
does help some people with small bouts
[1902.80 - 1906.56] of anxiety like
small bouts of of of anxiousness or
[1906.56 - 1909.36] anxiety okay
and it does and that's why i love
[1909.36 - 1913.44] meditations but for the most
majority of people suffering from
[1913.44 - 1917.20] anxiety
they can't meditate they if they sit
[1917.20 - 1920.56] there
and they focus on their breathing they
[1920.56 - 1924.56] go into panic attack
because their nerves are inflamed and
[1924.56 - 1927.12] nobody knows so then somebody be like oh
you're just
[1927.12 - 1930.64] you're just too you can't do it you
can't you can't focus
[1930.64 - 1935.60] you can't do that you know um there's
miranda kerr right there
[1935.60 - 1939.36] flynn says hi tell flynn i said hey
miranda kurds
[1939.36 - 1942.72] awesome friend of mine she's the best
she's uh on there great to see you
[1942.72 - 1946.40] tonight
incredible um definitely i said hi and i
[1946.40 - 1950.64] love him
and um so you know it's amazing how it
[1950.64 - 1954.48] works and our phrenic nerve
our vagus nerve all three of those
[1954.48 - 1957.04] nerves they
light up so when you're trying to do
[1957.04 - 1963.12] your meditations it's difficult
90 of people with anxiety
[1963.12 - 1967.44] like real anxiety issues not just
calling it anxiety
[1967.44 - 1971.68] and it's not but real anxiety issues
can't meditate
[1971.68 - 1975.76] they can't do breath work because it'll
throw them into a panic
[1975.76 - 1979.84] it'll increase their anxiety they're
really struggling and i'm going to go
[1979.84 - 1984.40] over the different levels of it
that's why band-aids like meditation and
[1984.40 - 1987.60] band-aids like breath work
are great and they're great and i and i
[1987.60 - 1991.12] always for years
40 years have been saying definitely do
[1991.12 - 1995.20] those and i even have meditations i talk
about in the books and and i'm going to
[1995.20 - 1999.68] put out more too
in the future but the point is is we got
[1999.68 - 2002.64] to get down to the
bottom of why somebody's crippling
[2002.64 - 2006.08] anxiety their throat tightens their
chest tightens they can't breathe
[2006.08 - 2009.20] they go into you know spasms they go
into panic
[2009.20 - 2012.64] they can't sleep their mind is racing
their thoughts are racing
[2012.64 - 2016.48] they're you know really struggling all
of that so
[2016.48 - 2020.08] you know it just it it matters to know
this information
[2020.08 - 2023.76] this is about taking control over your
life samantha says thank you for all
[2023.76 - 2026.80] your information i'm very grateful i'm
grateful you're here thank you for being
[2026.80 - 2028.96] here

[2028.96 - 2032.00] doing and applying anything i'm so proud
of you
[2032.00 - 2037.60] and um okay look so
so lending the height the light says
[2037.60 - 2040.48] definitely can't meditate and i can't
breathe
[2040.48 - 2045.84] so you totally get it right well 90 plus
percent of people suffering with any
[2045.84 - 2048.96] kind of anxiety and depression but
here's the thing
[2048.96 - 2052.16] that you know meditation gurus don't
know this they don't know this they
[2052.16 - 2055.60] think you're just not
maybe thinking positive enough or
[2055.60 - 2058.64] there's some other emotional
thing happening in you that makes it so
[2058.64 - 2061.92] you can't meditate what
people don't realize in the spiritual
[2061.92 - 2065.36] movement is why i got so popular back
you got to remember you guys
[2065.36 - 2069.20] meditation has been around forever okay
and
[2069.20 - 2073.68] and it's a helpful band-aid but it's
been around for a long time when my
[2073.68 - 2076.08] office
was filled in with thousands upon
[2076.08 - 2078.96] thousands of people traveling around the
world to my offices
[2078.96 - 2084.24] years and years ago they tried all that
they tried retreats and meditations and
[2084.24 - 2088.08] and all the different levels and unless
you know what's wrong
[2088.08 - 2093.28] and how to fix it and get the right
foods in you the right tools
[2093.28 - 2097.76] get the metals out get the viruses down
rebuild the neurotransmitters
[2097.76 - 2100.96] rebuild the neurons unless you know how
to do that
[2100.96 - 2104.96] it you know and then you don't have to
manage and manage
[2104.96 - 2109.44] and you know and i'm not talking about
light anxiousness because of emotional
[2109.44 - 2112.80] stress i'm not talking about that like
when somebody goes through an emotional
[2112.80 - 2115.44] hard time
and they got that anxiousness and they
[2115.44 - 2119.20] got that mild anxiety because they've
been through a lot and they have anxiety
[2119.20 - 2123.04] you can meditate
pretty easy for the most part with that
[2123.04 - 2127.92] i'm talking about
viral anxiety i'm talking about swollen
[2127.92 - 2131.60] vagus nerve anxiety i'm talking about
phrenic nerve anxiety i'm talking about
[2131.60 - 2137.04] neurotransmitter burnout anxiety
i'm talking about neuron burnout anxiety
[2137.04 - 2140.88] it's these things and and that's why i
was so known
[2140.88 - 2144.00] too was like oh my god i tried
everything but what can i do
[2144.00 - 2148.72] and there's real answers that's what we
need to talk about
[2156.84 - 2162.00] um
yeah okay so uh 777 trickster the
[2162.00 - 2165.60] nervous system
feels unsafe which is what causes
[2165.60 - 2168.48] anxiety nope that's not what causes
anxiety and
[2168.48 - 2173.20] i don't think that's going to get
anybody anywhere
[2173.20 - 2176.96] i mean i'm not making fun of you at all
i mean it's totally cool to feel that
[2176.96 - 2178.72] way
and be like well maybe the nervous
[2178.72 - 2184.00] system feels unsafe but
that doesn't make any sense you know um
[2184.00 - 2189.04] but listen stay on trickster stay on and
watch the rest of this live because
[2189.04 - 2193.92] we're going to cut into everything okay
and it's important to know um so you
[2193.92 - 2196.16] guys
[2196.80 - 2202.16] all right so let's go
somebody said this makes so much sense i
[2202.16 - 2205.04] just saw that everything lemon balm is a
journey x
[2205.04 - 2208.16] x oh lemon balm is a lifesaver it really
is
[2208.16 - 2211.52] so let's go into this let's head into
here you guys
[2211.52 - 2214.96] um so i'm ready when you guys are so
there's
[2214.96 - 2219.92] emotional anxiety emotional anxiety is
is kind of like is what i call emotional
[2219.92 - 2223.76] anxiety so check this out right
it's like you can't put your finger on
[2223.76 - 2229.20] why you really feel this way
right you're not sure if you're happy
[2229.20 - 2233.28] you're not sure if you're upset
you're not sure if you're sad you're
[2233.28 - 2235.92] kind of like not sure if you get mad
you're not sure if you're really
[2235.92 - 2240.80] frustrated and you get
lonely really easy like you're like
[2240.80 - 2244.88] on the street walking and you feel like
lonely already and you see other people
[2244.88 - 2248.56] vibing out there and you're like you
know feeling like you're missing out on
[2248.56 - 2250.48] something
maybe you feel like you're missing out
[2250.48 - 2254.40] on something on life maybe
you want to go do something and maybe
[2254.40 - 2257.36] you want to go somewhere and you feel
like you wish you could but maybe you
[2257.36 - 2260.24] can't in that moment
maybe you need to maybe you feel like
[2260.24 - 2263.28] you need to be someplace else like
you're not in the right place in your
[2263.28 - 2265.84] life and you need to be someplace else
right
[2265.84 - 2269.20] maybe you feel all that at the same time
but yet
[2269.20 - 2272.40] you also feel like you want to stay home
and you want to curl up in bed
[2272.40 - 2276.64] and you want to just curl up in bed and
be in your comfy sweats and just
[2276.64 - 2280.48] kind of hide away and watch your
favorite movie eat your favorite comfort
[2280.48 - 2282.88] food
but yet that doesn't make you happy
[2282.88 - 2286.40] either and then you feel kind of anxiety
over it you just ate your comfort food
[2286.40 - 2290.08] you watched your favorite movie you got
some peace but yet you can't really find
[2290.08 - 2291.92] peace
you feel like you're missing out you
[2291.92 - 2294.72] want to connect with some friends you
used to know
[2294.72 - 2299.04] and you're kind of all over the place
and when you do talk to a friend about
[2299.04 - 2301.52] it
and they ask you what's wrong with you
[2301.52 - 2305.52] you tell them that you have anxiety
you know and or they or they tell you
[2305.52 - 2308.48] you have anxiety where they talk to you
and you're like talking to your friend
[2308.48 - 2311.04] and your friends like i think you have
anxiety or
[2311.04 - 2314.88] and you know and this is really mild and
the funny thing about this it's not
[2314.88 - 2318.48] funny but
you end up it ends up leading into like
[2318.48 - 2321.28] going
full force into something this type of
[2321.28 - 2325.44] anxiety ends up pushing you into full
force to take care of yourself like
[2325.44 - 2328.88] i'm gonna take care of myself i'm gonna
it's like i'm gonna exercise exercise
[2328.88 - 2332.32] exercise exercise i'm gonna make my
smoothie bowls make my smoothie bowls
[2332.32 - 2336.56] and you feel like full force into it and
you're like going full throttle and then
[2336.56 - 2339.52] all of a sudden it could flip to that to
no self-care at all
[2339.52 - 2343.12] where you're just all self-care because
you're feeling these feelings and you
[2343.12 - 2345.20] don't know why you're feeling them and
you're
[2345.20 - 2347.68] trying to get into some meditations
because you don't know why you're
[2347.68 - 2349.84] feeling them
and you're trying to like explore
[2349.84 - 2352.40] spiritual stuff because you don't know
why you're feeling them and then you're
[2352.40 - 2356.08] pushing it full throttle and you're
exercising you're eating better
[2356.08 - 2359.76] and then it flip-flops and it goes boom
into no no self-care
[2359.76 - 2362.72] and you're doing nothing at all like
you're back in your sweats you're in
[2362.72 - 2365.92] you're in your bed
you're depressed a little bit you're sad
[2365.92 - 2368.00] you're not sure you're frustrated you
feel like you're missing
[2368.00 - 2372.56] out on something and that's one very
mild version of anxiety but people have
[2372.56 - 2375.36] it i totally you know
here's another mild version you can't
[2375.36 - 2379.28] sit still you feel like there's just
something creeping
[2379.28 - 2382.40] you know like in your body you feel like
you're you know there's something
[2382.40 - 2385.04] creeping up your spine and you you can't
sit still
[2385.04 - 2388.64] and you know you're just you have to
keep moving you have to keep moving and
[2388.64 - 2391.68] there's that kind of anxiety where you
feel like if you slow down
[2391.68 - 2395.44] and you slow down it's just you know and
it's it's all of a sudden it picks up a
[2395.44 - 2397.52] little bit more
here's another version right here of
[2397.52 - 2401.04] anxiety a mild one thoughts are
racing did you ever have that do you
[2401.04 - 2404.16] know somebody that has the racing
thoughts anxiety
[2404.16 - 2407.36] where it's like you can't control the
thoughts
[2407.36 - 2410.16] they're racing it happens either when
you wake up first thing in the morning
[2410.16 - 2413.44] really early
it happens right before you go to bed it
[2413.44 - 2416.48] happens during the day when you're even
trying to focus you're trying to
[2416.48 - 2420.72] concentrate on something
and you're just your your thoughts are
[2420.72 - 2423.20] just racing
you know that's a whole other thing too
[2423.20 - 2427.44] and it makes you feel upset
and uneasy inside and you can't focus on
[2427.44 - 2430.80] anything else
here's another mild version of anxiety i
[2430.80 - 2433.92] talk about all the time you feel like
screaming
[2433.92 - 2438.16] you just you feel like screaming i know
it sounds like not a mild one
[2438.16 - 2443.36] but it could be a serious version too um
but it's a mild one too when it's not
[2443.36 - 2447.76] really serious where you don't scream
but you just feel like screaming you
[2447.76 - 2450.88] feel like going outside and doing that
that's a mild one too
[2450.88 - 2455.44] um here's a mild one too here you feel
trapped where
[2455.44 - 2458.80] when someone is talking to you so you
feel
[2458.80 - 2462.72] trapped when you're like someone
confronts you
[2462.72 - 2466.08] someone talks to you and you start
getting a headache and you start to
[2466.08 - 2468.40] sweat
and you you feel like your mouth gets
[2468.40 - 2471.44] too dry and you feel like your legs are
a little bit weak
[2471.44 - 2475.12] and you can't you feel like you almost
turn into like a jellyfish
[2475.12 - 2478.64] or a ball of jelly why somebody's
talking to you and you're standing there
[2478.64 - 2481.84] and they're talking to you and they're
draining your energy
[2481.84 - 2486.80] and you feel trapped that's another form
of anxiety that happens to you out there
[2486.80 - 2489.28] too you guys
let's talk about another one here's one
[2489.28 - 2492.00] that you feel like jumping out of your
skin
[2492.00 - 2495.60] you feel like a strange tickle inside
your body and you just want to shake it
[2495.60 - 2498.32] out you know what i mean like i was just
doing this now
[2498.32 - 2502.48] and you feel like you want to jump out
of your skin and at the same time
[2502.48 - 2506.16] you're frustrated and you're getting
angry and you want to cry all at once i
[2506.16 - 2508.88] don't know if you guys ever experienced
that so many people where
[2508.88 - 2512.32] they want to cry they feel angry they
want to jump out of their skin
[2512.32 - 2515.60] here's another one right here and i'm
going pretty quick you guys because
[2515.60 - 2518.16] there's so much to cover so you might
want to watch this from the beginning
[2518.16 - 2522.08] again
you can't sleep at night so how about
[2522.08 - 2525.36] that version
you can't sleep at night where it's hard
[2525.36 - 2529.12] to fall asleep because
you don't feel safe you know like when
[2529.12 - 2531.44] you go to bed at night you don't feel
safe you're not
[2531.44 - 2537.36] excited about tomorrow you're not
inspired about life you're not inspired
[2537.36 - 2540.16] about the next day you're stressed out
about
[2540.16 - 2545.60] tomorrow and you're dreaming a lot when
you're sleeping and your dreams aren't
[2545.60 - 2549.04] happy ones and your dreams aren't really
that peaceful
[2549.04 - 2552.96] so you're frustrated as you're dreaming
at night and you wake up but you're not
[2552.96 - 2556.00] looking forward to the morning and when
you get up in the morning you kind of
[2556.00 - 2558.88] wake up scared or a little spooked and
you feel
[2558.88 - 2562.40] insecure about your day and you feel
insecure about what you're
[2562.40 - 2567.28] what you're going through in your life
so that happens too
[2567.28 - 2570.40] and just so you know a lot of people
have mixed versions of this that's what
[2570.40 - 2574.72] i mean
there's no definitive one
[2574.72 - 2579.20] version only anxiety and that's what it
is and everybody has the same thing
[2579.20 - 2584.16] no way it is so many different varieties
you can have it mixed
[2584.16 - 2587.12] all these different things so let's go
to another one the one where you can't
[2587.12 - 2592.00] communicate in your numb
where your hands get sweaty your armpits
[2592.00 - 2596.16] get drenched and you get kind of numb
your arms and hands get slightly numb
[2596.16 - 2599.12] your temperature fluctuates where you
feel kind of a little bit of chills but
[2599.12 - 2603.52] you're not too hot you're too cold
and it's that where you get cold easy
[2603.52 - 2606.56] and you kind of shake
here's a moderate form of anxiety here
[2606.56 - 2611.52] that i've always seen all these years
and and uh check this one out too hard
[2611.52 - 2615.12] to drive in the car
you can't sit in the passenger seat you
[2615.12 - 2619.20] feel like jumping kind of out of the car
you feel trapped in the car you want to
[2619.20 - 2623.04] get out and the person who's driving you
is somebody that you care about or you
[2623.04 - 2624.88] love
or maybe it's somebody that's annoying
[2624.88 - 2628.88] you and you carpooled with somebody
but and you just feel trapped and
[2628.88 - 2632.24] suffocated in a car
and every time you're like in the car
[2632.24 - 2636.16] you're it becomes this phobia
where you feel claustrophobic in the car
[2636.16 - 2639.28] you feel like it
gets you get confused you can't handle
[2639.28 - 2642.80] over stimulation
if someone turns the radio on in the car
[2642.80 - 2645.44] and they're blasting music if it's not a
song you like
[2645.44 - 2649.68] it makes it worse and you get over
stimulated and you get just like oh my
[2649.68 - 2654.40] god i can't handle this
somebody said yep all the above
[2654.40 - 2657.76] so hammer monique says all the above
yeah totally i
[2657.76 - 2663.20] i i believe you 100 and um here's
another moderate version tightness of
[2663.20 - 2666.08] the chest
do you get that one too is that the one
[2666.08 - 2669.52] you get to the tightness in the chest
right you get tightness in the throat
[2669.52 - 2673.20] tightness in the chest um
locked up in the stomach you can get
[2673.20 - 2676.24] locked up in the stomach so that's a
whole other one too
[2676.24 - 2680.00] and that kind of chest tightness um that
kind of like
[2680.00 - 2685.84] throat tightness tightness in the back
tightness in the shoulders a back of the
[2685.84 - 2688.40] head where you get tightness in the back
of the head
[2688.40 - 2691.60] that one right there you know you guys
so there's that
[2691.60 - 2695.04] and so the reason why there's so many
different versions it's because you get
[2695.04 - 2699.76] the viral issues the shingles the
epstein bars that nobody knows about i
[2699.76 - 2702.88] talk about and cleanse the heel
and then you get the toxic heavy metals
[2702.88 - 2706.16] by the way i have the heavy metal detox
smoothie right here
[2706.16 - 2710.24] and you know miranda kerr who is who's
who's on watching tonight she does the
[2710.24 - 2715.28] medical medium heavy metal detox movie
that's what she does and um you know i
[2715.28 - 2718.48] like putting more orange juice in mine
right there is fresh squeezed orange
[2718.48 - 2721.84] juice and
it's so funny because miranda puts his
[2721.84 - 2727.60] fresh squeezed orange juice in there too
so anyway um this is on sale by the way
[2727.60 - 2730.32] here's another version is you feel
scared
[2730.32 - 2734.72] you're feeling scared but you don't know
why and your mind is trying to find out
[2734.72 - 2738.80] like why am i so scared about everything
like why am i scared about life
[2738.80 - 2743.92] why am i scared about anything like i i
can't handle news i can't handle someone
[2743.92 - 2747.44] delivering
bad news to me which isn't even that bad
[2747.44 - 2751.68] i can't handle somebody delivering
good news to me either i can't handle
[2751.68 - 2754.72] someone delivering
like any kind of news and there's that
[2754.72 - 2758.96] whole thing too and
um that's a hard one for a lot of people
[2758.96 - 2762.56] where you just get
spooked easy your heart race is easy
[2762.56 - 2765.20] every time
you think of thought and your heart
[2765.20 - 2768.88] starts picking up you know and
every time someone's about to deliver
[2768.88 - 2773.04] news even if it's good news
you got some like ptsd with your anxiety
[2773.04 - 2776.32] all combined
and your your heart races when someone
[2776.32 - 2780.56] even gives you good news and you get
scared and you get spooked easy and the
[2780.56 - 2784.48] whole bit it's critical to know
what's going on it's why people who have
[2784.48 - 2788.72] lyme disease have all these anxiety
symptoms because it's viruses and metals
[2788.72 - 2792.96] that's what lyme disease is i've said
this all along and it's why um
[2792.96 - 2796.32] that's why it's that that's a reason all
on its own so
[2796.32 - 2800.40] plantar fasciitis you guys that's that's
viral and i talk you know i talk about
[2800.40 - 2805.52] that in cleanse of heal too
and that's a viral issue that's that's
[2805.52 - 2809.60] plantar fasciitis is mostly
epstein-barr i've seen shingles pop in a
[2809.60 - 2813.60] little bit too with that one too
so tightness in the stomach that's a
[2813.60 - 2816.16] different kind of anxiety i talk about
where it
[2816.16 - 2819.36] locks up in your stomach it's
gut-wrenching it feels like your
[2819.36 - 2822.08] stomach's flipping
where you feel like your stomach's
[2822.08 - 2824.72] flipping there's that kind right there
and that's the whole
[2824.72 - 2827.84] tummy problem where i can't eat i can't
eat
[2827.84 - 2832.64] there's no way i can get food in here
there's no way i could put food in there
[2832.64 - 2838.40] and it's all of that too look that's a
really good question right there
[2838.40 - 2842.96] i love questions like this um sherry
lane
[2842.96 - 2849.04] cherylin sorry how how can i
tell heavy metals are coming out with
[2849.04 - 2853.76] heavy metal detox
the heavy metal detox um smoothie
[2853.76 - 2857.12] right here that there's like this one
right here and the heavy metal detox
[2857.12 - 2860.64] cleanse
is you improve and you improve and you
[2860.64 - 2863.52] improve over time
a lot of times it's three steps up two
[2863.52 - 2866.80] steps back three steps up two steps back
three steps and then you're stronger and
[2866.80 - 2869.20] then you're stronger now you're doing a
whole bunch of things you didn't expect
[2869.20 - 2871.76] you're even doing
and now you're pushing it hard did you
[2871.76 - 2874.56] like what happens with a lot of people
you guys i'm going to lift this right
[2874.56 - 2878.56] here for some reason
um
[2879.76 - 2883.92] sorry some reason i'm adjusting the
whole thing there and
[2883.92 - 2887.44] there so what happens is that it's three
steps up two steps back
[2887.44 - 2891.28] three steps up two steps back and you
you improve
[2891.28 - 2895.60] and you improve but it all depends are
you doing the heavy metal detox cleanse
[2895.60 - 2899.04] where you're getting the fats low in the
morning are you doing other tools with
[2899.04 - 2902.32] it
and and are you doing supplements for
[2902.32 - 2906.08] your condition so do you have anxiety
what condition do you have
[2906.08 - 2911.20] um um sierra lane with that's the whole
thing so it all depends are you working
[2911.20 - 2913.12] with some of the supplement protocols
there's
[2913.12 - 2916.56] hundreds and hundreds of different
protocols in the medical medium cleanse
[2916.56 - 2919.60] the heel book
and in medical medium information so
[2919.60 - 2922.96] what avenue are you customizing for
yourself
[2922.96 - 2927.52] to get better and so that your heavy
metal detox smoothie works for you more
[2927.52 - 2930.56] and more
and more and each person has metals in
[2930.56 - 2933.28] different parts of their body they'll
have metals in different parts
[2933.28 - 2936.44] of their brain and in their liver and
there's thousands of different
[2936.44 - 2940.40] combinations to think about so really
important to know and
[2940.40 - 2944.08] you can customize your own protocol to
get better but how you know
[2944.08 - 2947.84] well you know what the same way so many
other people thousands of people know
[2947.84 - 2950.48] is they get better and they're doing
their heavy metal detox movie and
[2950.48 - 2952.88] they're getting their lives back
so let's talk about another moderate
[2952.88 - 2955.76] version right here tightness of the
stomach i talked about before
[2955.76 - 2959.52] which makes it hard to breathe shortness
of breath you feel like you can't get a
[2959.52 - 2961.76] breath
in you feel like you can't breathe
[2961.76 - 2965.52] there's that version
um another moderate version is short
[2965.52 - 2969.92] circuit of the brain
brain fog can't think clearly you go
[2969.92 - 2973.36] blank
just boom blank and you can't think
[2973.36 - 2975.84] clearly
and you got the brain fog you can't
[2975.84 - 2978.00] remember what you're you're talking
about
[2978.00 - 2981.12] or you're trying to remember and you're
trying to bring it back and you
[2981.12 - 2984.32] then you get frustrated and you just
start breaking down
[2984.32 - 2988.00] there's that variety where the neurons
are short-circuiting and that that's why
[2988.00 - 2991.60] i like the celery juice i don't have a
celery juice with me right now
[2991.60 - 2994.72] i think someone said he doesn't even
drink celery juice even though he
[2994.72 - 2998.08] what are you kidding how many times have
i showed you guys a glass of celery
[2998.08 - 3003.12] juice
and or sipping celery juice um
[3003.12 - 3006.16] so and then you know tongue turning
black by the way
[3006.16 - 3010.96] that's metals coming out that and you
can have the tongue turning black
[3010.96 - 3014.32] when metals are coming out and you can
have the tongue turning black
[3014.32 - 3017.60] when you're overloaded with metals
oxidizing
[3017.60 - 3020.80] without them coming out it can be both
ways
[3020.80 - 3024.64] you can have met you can have the black
tongue which means you're high in heavy
[3024.64 - 3027.60] metals
which means your metals are oxidizing
[3027.60 - 3030.48] that's the black tongue is
okay and you can also get the black
[3030.48 - 3035.92] tongue when you're pulling that stuff
out um i think somebody just asked for
[3035.92 - 3040.40] how much the book is 16.99
it's a medical textbook really packed
[3040.40 - 3044.40] with information
amazon.com um get it you know overseas
[3044.40 - 3046.80] and stuff get it free at the library
whatever
[3046.80 - 3051.36] as well too so um all right let's let's
keep on going you guys we've got more to
[3051.36 - 3055.28] cover
uh let's roll
[3055.28 - 3059.52] um a moderate version you wake up scared
your heart rate your heart is racing
[3059.52 - 3061.84] so i don't know if you guys have that
where you wake up in the middle of the
[3061.84 - 3065.12] night your heart's racing
so you wake up the middle of night your
[3065.12 - 3068.80] heart's racing and you're frustrated and
you get up and now you're pacing
[3068.80 - 3071.92] um that's a version right there i talk
about and you feel like you're wired
[3071.92 - 3074.32] then you can't fall back to sleep
because you're spooked
[3074.32 - 3077.28] and then you're spooked about everything
in the middle of the night so there's
[3077.28 - 3079.92] that version right there
and there's a version you feel like you
[3079.92 - 3083.20] can't be in your own skin i talked about
but a serious version of that where you
[3083.20 - 3087.20] feel like you can't be in your own skin
you don't feel safe you don't want to be
[3087.20 - 3090.80] alone but yet when somebody's around you
don't want to be with them either and
[3090.80 - 3094.00] you're all over the place
that's a version that's really hard to
[3094.00 - 3097.60] you guys are so many different
of these so i'm trying to get as much as
[3097.60 - 3101.84] i can um
the panic attack the severe versions
[3101.84 - 3105.60] where you get the panic attack
your chest gets so tight you feel like
[3105.60 - 3109.44] you're dying
you can't walk you can't move sometimes
[3109.44 - 3112.32] it puts you right on the floor
where you're laying on the floor and
[3112.32 - 3115.36] you're just doubled over and you're
really struggling and suffering
[3115.36 - 3119.12] and you're having that massive panic
attack right there that's a
[3119.12 - 3122.48] tricky one where you feel like your
lungs don't work you feel like you can't
[3122.48 - 3127.60] get a breath in or get a breath out you
feel like your chest is expanding
[3127.60 - 3131.04] you feel numb in your extremities where
you're completely numb
[3131.04 - 3134.08] everywhere in your body you feel like
your legs are weak
[3134.08 - 3137.60] you feel like if you wanted to get up
you couldn't even get up and run
[3137.60 - 3142.40] um that's inflamed nerves that's
pathogens and inflamed nerves that's
[3142.40 - 3147.68] viruses and inflamed nerves right there
so that's a whole version all on its own
[3147.68 - 3150.48] so i'm covering all the things i know i
didn't cover depression some
[3150.48 - 3156.16] so the silly siberian said yes yes
it's not in your head by the way and
[3156.16 - 3160.00] that's something to know
anxiety is not in your head even if your
[3160.00 - 3164.40] thoughts are triggering it
it just means your nerves are so
[3164.40 - 3169.28] hypersensitive and inflamed
from the metals and the viral issues
[3169.28 - 3172.96] that yes your own thoughts can trigger
it so that's why i love positive
[3172.96 - 3176.96] thoughts i love all that
of course god we need that but the point
[3176.96 - 3180.00] is
is i've seen anxiety so bad positive
[3180.00 - 3183.36] thoughts trigger it
that's how inflamed your nerves can get
[3183.36 - 3187.12] this is all medical medium information
can't get this information anywhere else
[3187.12 - 3190.40] it's why the medical medium community
grew so big over the last 35
[3190.40 - 3194.64] plus years um for the chronically ill
for the chronically ill it's the largest
[3194.64 - 3197.36] community and safe space for the
chronically ill if you're new here
[3197.36 - 3200.64] so there's all kinds of different things
where that was the one i was talking
[3200.64 - 3203.68] about where stressful thoughts can
actually make it worse
[3203.68 - 3207.28] anything stressful because your nerves
are already inflamed
[3207.28 - 3210.40] they're already lit up your phrenic
nerves your
[3210.40 - 3215.04] your vagus nerve is already a hot spot
because it's inflamed from toxic heavy
[3215.04 - 3218.32] metals
it's inflamed from pathogens and viruses
[3218.32 - 3220.96] like the
like how i described earlier so when
[3220.96 - 3223.84] those nerves are inflamed like that all
you gotta do is get jarred
[3223.84 - 3227.20] all you need is some bad news all you
need is to think bad thoughts all you
[3227.20 - 3229.84] need is to think good thoughts and
you're just now you're just feeling
[3229.84 - 3232.64] anxiety you can't
and then you're trying to tell yourself
[3232.64 - 3236.40] i'm okay i'm okay um or
i don't know if i'm dying and and now
[3236.40 - 3238.88] you're at like different doctor's
offices looking for different
[3238.88 - 3242.08] medications it's really difficult for so
many people
[3242.08 - 3246.16] another version of of anxiety is you're
nauseous and you can't eat you just
[3246.16 - 3250.08] can't get food down you're so nauseous
you can't get food down your family
[3250.08 - 3254.32] members don't understand
nobody gets it where you know they you
[3254.32 - 3257.12] got an eating disorder you got an eating
disorder
[3257.12 - 3261.60] you know what's wrong with you you can't
eat meanwhile anxiety is what it is
[3261.60 - 3267.36] um trisha marie 75 oh my god
you are explaining this perfectly that
[3267.36 - 3271.68] is what happened to me
with the numbness afterwards um i'm
[3271.68 - 3275.28] sorry you're going through that
i'm sorry you went through that it's it
[3275.28 - 3280.16] breaks my heart to know that
like i care about people you know and
[3280.16 - 3283.28] that's the whole thing and the more and
more i care about people and the more
[3283.28 - 3286.08] and more
i want you guys better the more flack i
[3286.08 - 3289.04] get out there you guys wouldn't believe
how it goes the more and more people
[3289.04 - 3292.00] want to stomp me out and silence me it's
crazy
[3292.00 - 3294.64] because you're really not allowed to get
people better you're just supposed to
[3294.64 - 3297.60] play this game maybe some food science
game or write some
[3297.60 - 3301.04] books that don't get anybody anywhere in
health and regurgitated
[3301.04 - 3303.92] information you pass around over and
over again you're not allowed to get
[3303.92 - 3306.00] people better and medical medium
information actually
[3306.00 - 3309.36] gets people better and let me tell you
something
[3309.36 - 3312.64] there's some bad people in the world
that don't want people healing
[3312.64 - 3315.76] you know in the industries and medical
media information has saved
[3315.76 - 3321.04] countless lives already and it pains me
to know that you actually went through
[3321.04 - 3324.80] that that you're go you you went through
those symptoms and you suffered like
[3324.80 - 3326.96] that
and the more and more i care and the
[3326.96 - 3329.92] more and more i fight for you guys and
fight for the underdog and
[3329.92 - 3333.52] in all that the more and more bs gets
put out there
[3333.52 - 3337.36] stories aren't real this and that
happens paid trolls go on
[3337.36 - 3341.52] oh my god the pay trolls the industries
but you know amp up those paid trolls 24
[3341.52 - 3343.68] 7. it's incredible
and they got every trick in the book
[3343.68 - 3346.72] like oh i tried medical medium and it
didn't work oh sure
[3346.72 - 3349.44] you tried it you tried the hundreds of
protocols you locked down your
[3349.44 - 3352.88] customized protocol
sure you read the book but by the way
[3352.88 - 3356.00] you guys over 200 symptoms and
conditions in here
[3356.00 - 3360.00] and um you guys i love fighting for you
guys and i'll tell you why
[3360.00 - 3365.28] okay because when i'm when i
wake up in the morning and i know so
[3365.28 - 3369.44] many of you guys are suffering out there
and you've been through hell and back
[3369.44 - 3372.48] and i know you can rise out of those
ashes
[3372.48 - 3376.48] i know you can rise out of the ashes and
heal and move forward
[3376.48 - 3379.84] and you know and i'm never gonna stop
fighting for you guys
[3379.84 - 3382.64] because i know that you've been
struggling and suffering and people with
[3382.64 - 3386.24] anxiety
man they're not treated good they're not
[3386.24 - 3389.04] treated good
and i've seen that over and over and
[3389.04 - 3392.32] over again
and you guys i'm going to cover more in
[3392.32 - 3394.88] depression
one thing about depression i'll cover a
[3394.88 - 3399.12] couple of minutes of depression though
with depression is the toxic heavy
[3399.12 - 3402.08] metals play a really large role in
depression
[3402.08 - 3406.80] and you got to get the metals out
because when the neurons are saturated
[3406.80 - 3411.60] with toxic heavy metals
it weighs down the electrical impulse to
[3411.60 - 3415.52] the point where your neurotransmitters
start to dehydrate they start to not get
[3415.52 - 3419.04] used properly they don't ignite the
neurons
