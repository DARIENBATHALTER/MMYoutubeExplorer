00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,560
conventional medicine

12

and no one knew what was wrong with them

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,800
nobody knew

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,920
anything aches and pains and the vertigo

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,800
and the dizziness and the eczema

we're wrong about as being bacteria

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
but the point is is people walking

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,119

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,799

108
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,959
i really try to push it 32 ounces

109
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,080
that's what i do try to get you know

110
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,400
what you can in you

111
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,159

glad you guys are coming on

113
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,560
it makes a difference it really does and

114
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,599
celery juice also keeps people out of

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,519
trouble too

116
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,720
unless they're doing death by a thousand

117
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
cuts too much

118
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,239
and then they're doing like everything

119
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,480
wrong

120
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
and anything wrong they're reading

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,319
really bad

122
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,519
they're picking up new bugs left and

123
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,400
right

124
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
they're doing new medical treatments all

125
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,759
kinds they're getting blood draws

126
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,120
extensive blood draws the blood testing

127
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,800
all the time so they're removing their

128
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,680
immune system out of the person all the

129
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
time

130
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,919
and then and then the celery juice might

131
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
not be enough because it's death by a

132
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,400
thousand cuts

133
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,400
so your celery juice is trying to

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
sustain you it's trying to keep you okay

135
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,520
it's trying to keep you hanging in there

136
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
while you keep on doing all the wrong

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,880
and all of a sudden you're doing now

138
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,160
another blood draw because your doctor

139
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,400
wants 20 more

140
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,919
vials taken out of you and 10 more vials

141
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,160
taken out of you

142
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,120
and then you're doing now you're doing

143
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,880
the wrong foods

144
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
now you got the wrong supplements and

145
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
there's citric acid and alcohol in them

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,160
and natural flavors and msg

147
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,600
and you're doing all these things and

148
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,960
celery juice is trying to keep you

149
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
hanging in there i've seen that with

150
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
people where they're doing celery juice

151
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,120
and it's the only thing they're doing

152
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,880
right

153
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,320
they're doing their sandwiches and it's

154
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,199
the only thing they're doing right

155
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,199
and they're doing so many things wrong

156
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,440
that that the seller juice is like hey

157
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280

158
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,280

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,520
helping people and having people fly all

204
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,720
around the world to my office and they

205
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,039
went and saw

206
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,400
lots of doctors and the doctors didn't

207
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,160
know why someone's sick

208
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,680
just my friend told me the other day

209
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,120
that he was watching some conference

210
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,800
he's a doctor and he was watching a

211
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,360
conference with a bunch of doctors on

212
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
there

213
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,479
talking about like that they thought

214
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,199
they were on this breakthrough with

215
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,599
microbiome

216
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,599
it's like what you're on some

217
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,840
breakthrough microbiome

218
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,720
um that's fun and all and that's cute

219
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
and all but

220
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,160
why aren't you talking about what the

221
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,440
real problems are why people are sick

222
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
it's a shingles virus in the

223
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,400
epstein-barr virus they got their

224
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,759
hashimoto's because of it's not they

225
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,120
don't have their hashimoto's

226
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,479
and hyperthyroidism because of

227
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,000
microbiome they don't have their ra

228
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,680
rheumatoid arthritis because they're

229
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
microbiome they don't have neurological

230
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,160
lyme because of microbiome i mean why

231
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,280
are you do they don't have adhd because

232
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,599
of that

233
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,360
so it's doctors just don't know and you

234
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,800
you know doctors they play in a lot of

235
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,720
doctors they play in a land of

236
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,240
if it's make-believe they don't know

237
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000

help

260
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,120
and it's really sad it kills me really

261
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
and then make sure you

262
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,240
blood draw the person to death make sure

263
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,719
you take another eight vials and another

264
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,839
10 vials and another 12 vials and

265
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,080
knock their immune system down more and

266
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,279
more

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,120
you know and that's what happened so

268
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,880
look the reason we'll expect that with

269
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
the fiber okay what happens is the

270
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,839
doctors don't know when other people

271
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
don't know and health professionals

272
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,920

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,640
you're doing

290
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,000
so lydius has been juicing for the past

291
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,200
three years

292
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,040

295
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,680

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,160
and it pays for itself and it pays for

301
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,959
itself

302
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,880
and it just does like the amount of

303
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,920
money it has saved me with celery okay

304
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,320
you guys

305
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,040
has paid for the juicer over a dozen

306
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
times

307
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,160
it's like getting 12 new juicers for

308
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,160
free over time

309
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,279
that's what this does as far as how much

310
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,720
it saves right

311
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,000
so let's go back to this though i got to

312
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,720
tell you guys this is a medical device

313
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,600

320
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,160

324
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,200

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,200

that's what happens doctors don't know

331
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
and so

332
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,760
a lot of doctors do know now i mean they

333
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,040

334
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,640
medium information

335
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,480

340
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,839
they'll say

347
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,040

349
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,839
when you leave the fiber and you're just

350
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,200
throwing in a couple of sticks

351
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,720
and you're putting a couple sticks in

352
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
your smoothie and you leave the fiber in

353
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
there

354
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,079
it's not enough you have to extract it

355
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,399
they don't know this is an herb

356
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,320

359
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,839
professional doctor or alternate

360
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,200
medicine doctor or now conventional

361
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,440
medicine doctor and they give you a

362
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,639
bottle of pills and there's some herbs

363
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,600
in there

364
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,920
right you know some kind of multi

365
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,519
vitamin powder or any powder or anything

368
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,200
and what happens is your doctor doesn't

know this is an herb

370
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,160
they think this is a vegetable for

371
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,240
crudite or for a little hummus

372
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,360
that's what they think and that's how

373
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,800
sad that is

374
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,880
truly so sad it is

375
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,079
you got the juicer a few months ago and

376

404
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,160

chopped up in little pieces and put into

406
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,160
your tuna salad

way in healing those two incredible

414
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
sarah

415
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,000
amazing amazing amazing there are

416
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,800
doctors out there that have a practice

417
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,399
for years like a decade they get one

418
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,610
patient better with one

419
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,680
symptom and they get heralded as god

420
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,480
[Music]

421
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,000
one patient better in a year just a

422
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,600
little better they put him on a keto

423
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,399
diet they weren't that sick to begin

424
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
with

425
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,760
they had a couple of symptoms they get

426
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,800
one symptom better now they're god

427
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,880
because of a keto diet it's like

428
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,560
there's the difference between like the

429
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
not so sick and people who have 50

430
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,680
symptoms

431
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,440
sarah so you get 50 symptoms it's so so

432
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,160
much to bear right

433
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,279
that you've been through and there's a

434
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,079
difference there

435
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,040
between having a lot of symptoms and not

436
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,240
being sick

437
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,120
and then cleaning up your diet and

438
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,639
exercising big difference

439
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,800
big difference and that's when the

440
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,560
celery juice matters so you'll see the

441
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
people who rank on celery juice and

442
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,480
stuff you guys

443
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,680
they're people that have never been sick

444
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,360
they don't know what it's like when that

445
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,279
needle won't move no matter what powder

446
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,959
or what probiotic you're trying or what

447
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,760
fish oil you're trying or what charcoal

448
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,000
powder

449
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,839
or what whatever whey protein powder

450
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,279
when you when the needle won't move they

451
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,040
don't understand that because they've

452
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,839
never been sick yet they haven't gotten

453
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,440
there yet

454
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,800
they haven't gotten the pathogens yet

455
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,000
and they haven't got enough toxic heavy

456
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,199
metals so when they do they go

457
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,560
more down and then

458
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,040
that's what moves the needle

459
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,720
mary fox says so focused on my digestive

460
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,800

and so i'm gonna juice some celery now

483
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,880
so hey i got this under here

484
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,160
one time i did it wasn't even there and

485
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,160
it was just pouring out

486
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:33,759
that's why we're live so

487
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,399
this is a medical device

488
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,680
helping to prevent you from being on

489
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,040
medical

490
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:45,920
equipment in a hospital

491
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:49,360
or somewhere else what you'll notice

492
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,680
is there aren't metal gears here

493
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
there aren't metal gears in here there's

494
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,120
not metal gears

495
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,399
okay i

496
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,000
don't like juicers with metal

497
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,880
gears bump grinding and rubbing

498
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,280
against each other that is a nightmare

499
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,280
for me

500
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,919
because metal on metal wears

501
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,919
you don't see it wear

502
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,360
but it does and that metal wears out and

503
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,919
and so here you are juicing your celery

504
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,760
and you got

505
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,120
metal on metal in here and you're just

506
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,959
getting little tiny bits of metal you

507
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,080
can't see

508
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,240
so i don't like it's really

509
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,679
annoying when someone's like hey there's

510
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,799
this other brand of juicer

511
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:40,640
it's so great top of the line

512
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,000
oh really yeah yeah it's masticating the

513
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,480
whole bit oh really

514
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,080
it's got the metal gears huh okay great

515
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,080
not great terribly

516
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,160
[Music]

517
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,120

give us a little reminder about the

535
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,760
celery juicer is because

537
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,200
medical medium

538
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,000
heavy metal detox cleanse because it's

539
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,520

540
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,840
the the smoothie it's also the the

541
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,840
celery juice is part of that cleanse

542
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,640

your celery juice

550
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,240
the medicine has to be by itself

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,840

565
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,640
do not do hpp celery juice

the parking lot buy it

568
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,760
pour it out in the street in the parking

569
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
lot that's how useless it is because of

570
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,240
high pressure pasteurization

571
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,200
keep that in mind they'll say it's raw

572
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,600
on the bottle

573
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,679
it looks like raw green juice it looks

574
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,760
like raw celery juice

575
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,660
but it's not it's been cooked in a

576
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,980
different way

577
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,559
[Applause]

578
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,720
[Music]

579
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,840
cell brook says how much celery juice

580
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,400
medicine

581
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,240
when i'm on mattress island with cfs if

582
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,840
i was on mattress island with cfs

583
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,840
if i was there okay

584
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,880
i'd be doing what i can to start with

585
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,840
like what can i do

586
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,559
can i get up to 32 ounces i would do a

587
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,440
minimum

588
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,240
of 16 ounces on an empty stomach in the

589
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,240
morning

590
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,640
if you're really sensitive start with

591
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,159
four ounces six ounces

592
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,520
if i had cfs i would work myself up to

593
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,919
32 ounces

594
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,200
or at least 28 ounces eventually all

595
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,919
right there's plenty of celery juice in

596
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,919
here right now so

597
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,720
that's what i would do all right

598
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,799
so i want to show you guys and i think

599
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,159
you guys know this right this is light

600
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,159
and fluffy

601
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,280
so this is light and fluffy so this is

602
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,240
dry

603
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,960
it's dry there's no juice in the bottom

604
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,200
of this

605
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,000
this is dry the pulp see that see the

606
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,880
pulp pieces

607
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
it's not sticking to the bottom it's

608
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,640
actually dry

609
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,200
right there's a reason for that the

610
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,320
mm-900

611
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,679
squeezes out so much juice

612
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,200
that your pulp is dry

613
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,880
let me just tell you what this equate

614
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,480
equates for for me

615
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,120
i've already saved i mean

616
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,600
thousands at this point where it's paid

617
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,840
for

618
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,520
free juicers meaning i could have gotten

619
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,919
12 new free juicers

620
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,280
with the money i saved because i buy so

621
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,280
much celery

622
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,880
that's the difference right there it's

623
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,880
it's incredible blows me away still

624
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,480
trying to read a comment because there's

625
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,039
a movement the only use organic celery

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,919
i wash out the stalks conventional

630
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,320
celery

631
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,080
i take my thumb i take a little bit of

632
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,840
natural dish dish soap right

633
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,440
i have a big bowl of water i put a

634
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,480
little bit of natural dish soap in there

635
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,080
it's a little bit right

636
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,679
i stick the celery in there meaning

637
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
actually i get i get it ready for where

638
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,960

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,000
it stalks like this i put it in the bowl

640
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,320

641
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,360
i rub it with my hands really good in

642
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,200
that water

643
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,600
and i take my thumb and i go down the

644
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,880

646
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,360
yeah i use conventional celery

647
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,080
absolutely i mean i use organic when i

648
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,480

organic herb at the moment but that's

655
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,200

656
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:59,159

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,840
whatever is happening in trend world

750
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,200
kombucha tea all of it

751
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,480
is backed by money investors

752
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,640
and shareholders just so you know

753
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,320
and that's why the stuff is out there

754
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,000
it's not out there because it

755
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,240
moved the needle when someone was on

756
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,120
mattress island

757
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,559
do you know how this survived because it

758
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,320
moved the needle when someone was on

759
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,559
mattress island

760
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,400
that's why this survived whey protein

761
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,080
powder is only surviving

762
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,840
because it's got money behind it apple

763
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,919
cider vinegar is only surviving

764
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,000
because it's a billion dollar industry

765
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,440
these are only surviving

766
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,120
because they have investors and

767
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,679
shareholders

768
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,159
and there's money propelling it into

769
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,840
millions and millions of dollars of ads

770
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,279
celery juice stays alive on its own out

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,600

772
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,320

alive with the naysayers that

775
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,320
the attacks on it because you can't make

776
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,039

conventional medicine hate it

797
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,640
they hate this because it's not making

798
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,320
the podcast doctors money

799
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,600

800
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,360

money

803
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,880
but yet it's in the way there's no

804
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,799
shareholders

805
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,480

806
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,000
millions of dollars in advertisements

807
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,559
for for this

808
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
this isn't being advertised all over the

809
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,120
place but know all

810
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,120
your tricked out supplements

811
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,640
that won't move the needle like your

812
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,440
charcoals and

813
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,080
your zeolites and your bentonite clay

814
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,679
and

815
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,279
you know your whey protein powder and

816
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,279
your charcoal and your acv

817
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,960
gummies and all that stuff propelled my

818
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,720
money your kombucha tea propelled my

819
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,799
money money money money

820
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,159
this isn't do you guys know what that

821
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,000
means

822
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,520
that means that this is the only trend

823
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
in existence in alternative and

824
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,080
conventional

825
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,760
medicine that literally survives because

826
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,240
it actually heals people not because it

827
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,919
has

828
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,679
billions of dollars being dumped into it

829
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,919
and advertisements non-stop left and

830
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,919
right

831
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,960
right god when you think about it

832
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,200
when you think about it that's a big

833
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,200
deal

834
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,080
survives with all the hate and the

835
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
negativity to it and how many

836
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,679
nutritionists say you you shouldn't

837
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,600
juice celery you should make sure you

838
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,720
just have it in a smoothie with

839
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,520
other things yeah you can do that too

840
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,279
celery is good for you but it becomes a

841
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,880
medicine when you juice it this is

842
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,000
herbal medicine

843
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,320
and it's one of the medical medium tools

844
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,200
and many people don't use this tool

845
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,120
correctly

846
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,799
has to be on an empty stomach if you can

847
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,360
that's usually its best ticket right

848
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,600
there

849
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,399
16 ounces on an empty stomach right

850
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,919
that's that

851
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,600
right there is really important check

852
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,279
this out right that one

853
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,000
don't add ice no lemon no water

854
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,600
don't add that into your juice keep that

855
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,559
in mind

856
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,919

857
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,120
in my throat monday

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,600
zinc and c shock therapy plus fat free

859
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,399

860
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,559

and zinc shock therapy incredible

863
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,840
but vimergy products though

864
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,760
vimergy i'm not sponsored by vimergy but

865
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,559
it's got to be vimrgy to really do what

866
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,159
it's got to do

867
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,760
because i heard someone tried it with a

868
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,760
whole bunch of other different stuff

869
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,840
crappy stuff from other companies and it

870
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,039
didn't work because it was bad zinc

871
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,799
wasn't stabilized terrible vitamin c

872
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,960

961
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,240

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,799
an empty stomach that's a that's

963
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,360
no no offense right because i know

964
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,039
you're just

965
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,559
talking about this new trend out there

966
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,960
right but it's

967
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,679
it's the dumbest trend that's so dumb so

968
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,760
let's just

969
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,240
let's add okay okay instead of putting

970
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,600
table sugar in our coffee or raw sugar

971
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,000
in our coffee let's put honey in our

972
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,399
coffee

973
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,200
now we just we we stepped up a little

974
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,639
bit i mean

975
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,440
how crazy is that right

976
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,040
why did you promote conventional celery

977
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,320
because there's people out there

978
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,760
that can't always get organic and the

979
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,000
but yet okay if you can't get organic

980
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,240
celery

981
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,599
and it means not juicing celery at all

982
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,679
because you don't want to use

983
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,079
conventional celery you just wronged

984
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,119
yourself

985
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,839
bad there's times i can't get organic

986
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,879
celery

987
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,000
you better believe i grabbed

988
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,280
conventional celery dang right

989
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,040
and i'm juicing it so

990
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,800
that's why i promoted conventional

991
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,359
celery 100

992
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,720
hands down hands down you're somebody

993
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,240
that you're not going to juice celery at

994
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,000
all because you can only get a hold of

995
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,839
conventional celery so hey i won't juice

996
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,760
it at all oh my god

997
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,640
that's crazy you know why because you're

998
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,680
going to get pesticides somewhere else

999
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,119
your butt's going to be getting

1000
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,800
pesticides somewhere else you're going

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,920
to be getting pesticides from all kinds

1002
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,359
of stuff you don't even know about

1003
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,480
including your neighbor spraying it on

1004
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,000

1005
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,680

1160
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,599
overnight

1161
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,960
sometimes it takes time plenty of time

1162
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,400
you might have more than one thing

1163
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,440
causing your bloating

1164
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,640
some people will have the bacteria

1165
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,319
right or even the viruses

1166
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,480
they'll have the bacteria and viruses

1167
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,000
inside their liver

1168
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,240
their liver gets stagnant and sluggish

1169
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,040
from all their high fat diets

1170
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,400
all their vinegar all their other stuff

1171
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,560
their caffeine

1172
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,119
and their liver gets burnt out chalked

1173
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,359
out choked out

1174
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,960
so pathogens tend to thrive in the liver

1175
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,040
even more then your liver doesn't

1176
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,040
produce as much bile

1177
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,960
so it doesn't produce as much bile as it

1178
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,359
needs to produce

1179
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,560
and so because of that now your fats

1180
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,200

hydrochloric

1204

in back i used to have intense

1247

bloating but thanks to your info no

1248
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,520
longer get it incredible

1249
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,680
gianna incredible i think that

1250
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,640
i think dr nesbitt just got out of

1251
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,920
surgery and dr nesbit says gianna

1252
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,760
uh amazing dr nesbit is

1253
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,440
isn't she doing incredible no more

1254
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,880
bloating is that worth it

1255
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,640
dr nez but what do you do when someone

1256
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,079
has bloating you remove their stomach

1257
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,480
what dr nesbitt says he removes the

1258
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,200
patient's stomach if they get bloating

1259
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,520
he cuts the entire stomach out worse

1260
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,359
than you know the

1261
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,680
the this you know where you stitch the

1262
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,520
stomach so people can't eat as much

1263
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,520
so worse than that he removes the entire

1264
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,800
stomach out do you remove the entire

1265
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,560
stomach out

1266
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,440
he says he removes not only the entire

1267
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,960
stomach he even considers it recommends

1268
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,520
removing the person's brain

1269
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,359
so they choose not to eat and get

1270
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,520
themselves bloated

1271
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,599
he says yeah does that make any sense dr

1272
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,119
nesbitt is drunk right now

1273
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,800
he actually had a shot of whiskey in

1274
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,599
between surgery

1275
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,760
i trust dr nesbit sometimes but lately

1276
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,870
he's been off the mark

1277
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,960

1278
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:14,079

1307
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,520

1313
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,480

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,760
on the liver but that wasn't an answer

1316
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,400

tens of thousands of women suffering

1403
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,599

late 70s early 80s

1409
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,319
were blood drawn to death

1410
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,520

1420
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:31,119

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,240
poor donkeys all right

1495
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,319
so when someone when someone the whole

1496
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,720
lyme disease movement i can't tell you

1497
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,160
how many people rolled into my office

1498
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,240
with lyme disease

1499
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,599
barely alive and they've been to

1500
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,280
everybody and anything

1501
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,800
especially the people that had money

1502
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,480
that rolled into my office

1503
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,400
even when i wasn't charging anything in

1504
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,839
my office well i worked for free at my

1505
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,040
office and there were lines out the door

1506
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,880
out my shack

1507
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,559
literally out of my shack lines of

1508
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,800
people and they were do you know how

1509
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,800
they were paying me an apple

1510
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,319
they're paying me an apple they'd leave

1511
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,599
two apples

1512
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:00,880
they'd leave a banana they leave

1513
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,559
dried lavender okay even when i wasn't

1514
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,079
charging for years right until i

1515
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,040
couldn't keep the lights on so then i

1516
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,839
had to

1517
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,319
so the bottom line is it got to it you

1518
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,079
know it

1519
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:11,680
it the amount of people that rolled into

1520
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,480
my office from around the world

1521
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,000
with lyme disease and they went to all

1522
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,440
the different people they went to all

1523
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,440
the different chinese medicine doctors

1524
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,480
the acupuncturists the nutritionists the

1525
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,200
dietitians

1526
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,319
the functional doctors they were called

1527
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,160
something different back then the

1528
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,440
alternative doctors the holistic doctors

1529
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,040
so functional doctors functional

1530
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,400
medicine doctors were called holistic

1531
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,319
medical doctors back then they weren't

1532
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,359
called functional medicine doctors

1533
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,599
and so with all that

1534
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,359
they had to learn that this isn't why

1535
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,960
they were sick

1536
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,119
they had to learn that that wasn't why

1537
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,119
they were sick

1538
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,040
they had to learn that's why they were

1539
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:49,040
sick

1540
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,079
that's what they had to learn they had

1541
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,880
to learn they were sick

1542
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,520
because of this not because of this and

1543
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,680
that's what saved their lives

1544
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,200
in in no disrespect to the person that

1545
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,200
said third generation

1546
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,280
uh chinese medicine doctor there was no

1547
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,200
third generation chinese medicine doctor

1548
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,640
back in that time period that can tell

1549
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,240
somebody they were sick

1550
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,040
with a virus that was making them

1551
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:14,720
neurologically inflamed

1552
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,720
and they weren't sick because of that

1553
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:22,319
and so medical mean information really

1554
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:24,319
blew up with healing people with lyme

1555
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,720
disease that's what it was known for for

1556
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:29,280
years

1557
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,480
two decades known for that recovering

1558
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,440
people with lyme disease and even

1559
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,200
earlier

1560
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,280
laurie starr your information has helped

1561
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,000
me so much more than anything else i

1562
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,680
have tried

1563
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,520
you're an answer to my prayers honored

1564
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,280
you're here truly

1565
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,000
because lyme disease wasn't caused by a

1566
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,839
tick that's why people who got

1567
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,440
aj good to see you that's why there are

1568
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,040
so many people

1569
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,119
that weren't even around a tick in their

1570
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,480
lifetime in areas of the world there

1571
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,319
were no ticks

1572
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,799
never even seen a tick in their the

1573
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,640
region but had lyme disease

1574
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:00,319
because lyme disease is caused by the

1575
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,240
epstein-barr virus the shingles virus

1576
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,760
the simplex one the cytomegalovirus all

1577
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,760
combined or just the ebv

1578
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,680
can do it too sus sue says can we push

1579
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,160
to grow more celery so the world can

1580
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,599
heal

1581
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,280
they try to stop it they're trying to

1582
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,839
stop it right now just so you know

1583
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,280
and i predicted in the celery juice book

1584
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,319
they tried it they're trying to you know

1585
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,720
they're trying to make it

1586
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,400
they're gonna eventually put a ban on

1587
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,960
celery growing down the road

1588
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,119

and the media next to the caffeine crops

1593
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,319
and the media won't as far as vegetable

1594
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,480
meaning they list it

1595
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,839

00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,119

1672
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,280

1675
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,200
um

1676
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:59,599
so you guys let's do a quick rundown on

1677
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:02,880
how celery just works real quick

1678
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,640
and how important it is why one of the

1679
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,119
reasons why it's so helpful and

1680
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,720
it clears up brain fog too is because

1681
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,960
it's a complete electrolyte

1682
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,640
i want to cover that nina says i feel so

1683
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,599
much better i drink 20 ounces in the

1684
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,040
morning

1685
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:18,160
no food or drink for 30 minutes i feel

1686
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,599
great

1687
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:23,920
awesome it's a complete electrolyte

1688
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,920
please know that a complete electrolyte

1689
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,880
we don't have one herb

1690
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,680
one food one vegetable one fruit one

1691
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,440
piece of meat

1692
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,040
we don't have anything that has a

1693
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,160
complete electrolyte

1694
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,640
we don't we don't this is the only thing

1695
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:41,520
that has a complete electrolyte

1696
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,559
okay sodium cluster salts are a complete

1697
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,640
electrolyte

1698
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:48,000
so when this goes to the brain it helps

1699
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:51,040
to revive your neurotransmitters

1700
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,880
your neurotransmitters start to revive

1701
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,960
so that's another very important part of

1702
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,400
why celery juice is so incredible

1703
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:02,000

1736
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:17,039
been consuming lemon water and cj for

1737
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:19,760
almost three years daily

1738
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,440
and making great progress healing my

1739
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,000
psoriatic arthritis

1740
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,280
wondering should we soak celery in water

1741
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,119
prior to juicing or not you don't have

1742
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,480
to soak it in water to juice it

1743
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,920
just give it a good wash you put it in a

1744
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,799
bowl and you can give it a good wash

1745
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,280
that's what i do

1746
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:35,039
i wash out any dirt in in here in the

1747
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,119
stock right here

1748
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,920
and i'm so proud of you incredibly proud

1749
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:42,319
of you psoriatic arthritis

1750
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,359
is a combination of both ebv and the

1751
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:45,760
liver with

1752
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,880
copper and mercury and so what happens

1753
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,079
is you get a little bit of that

1754
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,880
dermatoxin

1755
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,200
and that dermatoxin goes to the joints

1756
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,200
or

1757
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,720
it causes some flare-ups to you and

1758
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,359
everything i talk about that in the

1759
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,400
