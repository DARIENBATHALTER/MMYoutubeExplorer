many people out there and they struggle

193
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,680
and they struggle they do they don't

194
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720
have any foundational tools they don't

195
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,080
know where to start they've lost their

196
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,120
Foundation along the way they're in this

197
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,159
spare they're

198
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,159
struggling and they're living with their

199
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:54,400
symptoms and conditions and then in the

200
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,960
end their family might not even

201
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,360
understand them their friends might not

202
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,560
even understand them and they might look

203
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,919
just fine and look look just standy the

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,680
person can look good look okay but

205
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,639
they're dying inside they feel like they

206
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,240
might look okay from the outside but in

207
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,240
the inside they feel Doom and Gloom and

208
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,919
am I ever going to get out of this and

209
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,240
I've been to so many doctors and I've

210
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,960
seen so many opinions and I've seen so

211
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680
many things in social media and I've

212
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,240
bought in this person's program and I

213
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,159
tried it and I've bought this person's

214
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,599
program in course I've taken this

215
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:27,919

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,800
another $1,000 Less in my pocket and

218
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,320
then the blood work thing all on its own

219
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,839
you go to this specialist they want

220
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,479
seven vials and you go to this

221
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,399
specialist and they want 12 vials and I

222
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,880
saw somebody leave a comment saying I'm

223
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,240
a blah blah blah nurse or I'm a blah

224
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,880

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,480
such thing as taking more than a couple

226
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,040
of vials I've never heard of such a

227
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,440

40 vials somebody said 60 vials of blood

230
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,360
and then we just get knocked down from

231
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,640
there and then you find this other

232
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,160
doctor and he's like nutritional

233
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,160
deficiencies look at all this stuff in

234
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,600

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,200
turn into it's worth a swear I'll say

239
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:19,800
that you know why it's worth a swear

240
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,440
because I've watched it go on for so

241
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,399
long and it's about the person who's

242
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,200
suffering and struggling it's about

243
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,560
making sure that that person is heard

244
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,040
because it's there's never any time for

245
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,560
The Chronic wheel there's never any time

246
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,440
for the person struggling and swept

247
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,440
under the carpet so yeah I can deserve a

248
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,480
swear gets me emotional really

249
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,040
emotional I've seen it every day for

250
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,600
years and I've seen

251
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,519
people just get kicked down so low get

252
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,720
kicked down so low down down down down

253
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,000
down down down to the point where

254
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:01,120
they're rock bottom and they're just a

255
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,120
puddle of water a puddle of fluid on the

256
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,519
floor they got the bladder infections

257
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,000

261
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,640
ear

262
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,200
infections and the list goes on and then

263
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,959
the flues come rolling into town you see

264
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,720
I got immune system stuff in front of me

265
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:30,079
right now because guess what I'm so sick

266
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:33,360
of it I am so darn sick of it the flu

267
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,160
and the Sea coming into town RSB coming

268
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,639

269
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,800
town rolling in the holidays are coming

270
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,079

Thanksgiving getting together for

272
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,279
Christmas and everybody's coughing and

273
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,480
choking their brains out and they're

274
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,800
sick and they're sick and then what

275
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,680
happens is when you get the flu like

276
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,760
medical meme information you get the flu

277
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,399
or you get the SE it knocks you down and

278
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,079
then the bugs rise up knocks you down

279
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,279
and then the bugs rise up

280
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,160
exposures knock us down then the bug

281
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,160
bugs rise up and then we have that

282
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,440
happen

283
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,200
too like right now I'm under a lot of

284
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,639
stress not sleeping that much doing a

285
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,240

289
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,560
the way I'm cranking up my antivirals

290
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,480

291
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,440
you know I don't want a flu com in my

292
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,920
way while I have two hours of sleep and

293
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm run down I don't need the SE come in

294
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,720
my way when I have 1 hour of sleep one

295
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,600
night cuz I'm working on a bunch of

296
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,440
deadlines and I'm under a lot of stress

297
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120

298
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,680
don't need something Sweeping in like a

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,600
sea or a flu coming in and knocking me

300
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,560
on my ass I don't need that right

301
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,200

302
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,079
got some friends and I know some other

303
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,440

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:08,639
weeks and I don't want that to be

308
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,760
me but I know that inevitably so many

309
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,760
people are going to be affected by it

310
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,959
and they're already affected by The

311
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,320

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,399
sensitivities so let's go into it a

320
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,920
little bit right now there are a lot of

321
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,680
people out there that are struggling

322
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,360
with neurological symptoms whether

323
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,120
they've been diagnosed with neurological

324
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,720
symptoms or seen as if they have a

325
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,680
neurological

326
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,320
symptom and they get just whacked

327
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,240
whacked some kind of exposure a lawn

328
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,440
treatment at a neighbor's

329
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,480
house pesticide spray drift coming from

330
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,199
mosquito spray wherever they don't even

331
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,639
know what it is diesel exhaust coming

332
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,720
from a truck that was running for a half

333
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,320
an hour near their

334
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,600
house any kind of exposure any kind of

335
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,440
exposure there's so many different kinds

336
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,079
and then all of a sudden something flips

337
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,560
them upside down maybe they got a food

338
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,760
poisoning and they don't realize it but

339
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,880
they got a food poisoning so easy

340
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,800
there's so many food born pathogens on

341
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,720
food every day out there in restaurants

342
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,959
and everywhere else it's easy to get a

343
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,120
food born pathogen and then it knocks

344
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:30,880
you on your butt and now you're

everything and the last thing you want

354
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,160
to do is try to take a supplement cuz

366
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,199
everybody knows that but you go see

367
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,720
another person and you're just like what

368
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,839
do I do and they're just like well you

369
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,000
can try this or do this and then you try

370
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,800
something and you react your body reacts

371
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,079
you feel like something is off

372
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,440
something's wrong and your body reacts

373
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,600
and now you're afraid of everything and

374
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,360
then the OCD kicks it up a notch and

375
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,839
you're afraid of everything the OCD

376
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,440
kicks it up a notch then you're afraid

377
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,079
of

378
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,680
everything then the anxiety Rises and

379
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,560
then the depression hits and then the

380
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,399
anger goes up and then the anger comes

381
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,720
down then your anxiety Rises and the

382
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,680
anger hits the anger goes up anger goes

383
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,320
down then the sadness comes and sweeps

384
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,839
in then the depression comes and takes

385
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,160
over then you're depersonalized then

386
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,639
you're doubting Your Existence and

387
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,040
doubting your purpose then it's back to

388
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,120
square one over and over and over again

389
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,600
what I want to tell you guys there's

390
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,800
light at the end of the

391
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,639
tunnel there's light at theend end of

392
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,560
the tunnel people who have committed

393
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,600
really committed to wanting to learn the

394
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,880
information I get it there's so many

395
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,199
things out there and so much noise and

396
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,279
confusion it's easy to get lost but if

397
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,360
someone cracks into the information then

398
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,959
they learn

399
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,959
it the light is in this book the light

400
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,959
is in these books so they can learn how

401
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,600
they got sick why they got sick and you

402
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,920
may see tits and T tidbits and things

403
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,759
like that and tidbits out

404
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,040
there you may see

405
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,440
that and what happens is that when you

406
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,079
see that out there you'll be confused be

407
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,680
like oh he talks about epine bar here oh

408
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,639
this person talks about this or mentions

409
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,519
this but you got to learn the truth and

410
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,000
where it comes from because tits and

411
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,519
tats and tads and things and all that of

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,199
information out there don't compile to

413
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,600
what's in here and becoming an experts

414
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,199
critical let's go into supplement

415
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,519
sensitivities a little

416
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,680
bit there may come a time in your life

417
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,360
where you're hyp sensitive and you've

418
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,680
been burned by supplements and you don't

419
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,279
like it because you're super sensitive

420
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,600
you can't take anything you can't do

421
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,040
anything then that happens out there one

422
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,880
of the reasons why there's supplements

423
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
out there that have citric acid in it

424
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,360
they have all these different

425
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,279
undisclosed things like C citric acid

426
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,800
and they cause problems with so many

427
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,560
people Terra over there on YouTube

428
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,360
please talk more about sensitivities to

429
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,639
to stimulation sound motion mental

430
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,240
stimulation reading talking ET

431
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,920
absolutely what what happens is those

432
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,600
are all neurological

433
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,920
symptoms a sensitive nervous system can

434
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,000
make it so you're actually sensitive to

435
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,880
noise you're sensitive to the front door

436
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,440
opening if you have if you're living

437
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,959
with family and someone opens the front

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,639
door you're going to feel it you're just

439
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,639
going to feel it and you're going to be

440
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,319
really sensitive you're going to be

441
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,639
sensitive to a Full Moon you're going to

442
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,519
be sensitive to a storm a wind wind

443
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,519
storm you're going to be sensitive to

444
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,240
when the cold weather sweeps

445
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,720
in and you can be sensitive to when the

446
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,079
hot weather comes in you could be

447
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,600
sensitive when the humidity Rises

448
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,160
sensitive when the air gets too dry

449
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,160
sensitive when the heat's on in the

450
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,679
house when it's cooled out sensitive to

451
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,039
when the air conditioner's on in the

452
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,720
house when it's hot out you can be fine

453
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:26,400
for years and then suddenly you're

454
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,400
sensitive to everything and

455
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,840
anything fine for years

456
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,840
what happens is with a lot of Sensi

457
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,559
sensitive people it's the sensitive

458
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:41,200
nervous system syndrome is what it is

459
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:43,720
the sensitive nervous system

460
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,520
syndrome basically what that means is

461
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,600
anything and everything can just rattle

462
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,919
your vegus nerves rattle your trial

463
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,960
nerves rattle your frenic nerves rattle

464
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,600
all the nerves in your body and bring

465
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,880
you to a place where you're just you're

466
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,320
just you can't you want to jump out of

467
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,200
your skin

468
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,559
and you feel like you might even seizure

469
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,760
kind of feeling where you almost feel

470
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,400
like it's pushing you over the edge

471
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,400
where you almost can't stand it anymore

472
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,120
and you

473
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,840
just you just feel like you're losing it

474
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,320
sensitivities from sensitive nerves can

475
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,720
make us feel inadequate make us feel

476
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,320
like something's wrong make us feel

477
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,280
like we're not doing good at all and

478
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,919
it's a hard place to be a hard place to

479
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,640
feel I feel for anybody who's going

480
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,240
through any of that

481
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,600
I really do truly truly

482
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,080
truly

483
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,840
and when it comes down to sensitivities

484
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,039
when we get exposed to something and

485
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,960
we're really hyp sensitive something

486
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,400
triggers triggers us in our life and

487
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,320
we're sick now whether it's pathogens

488
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,320
creating neurotoxins medical M

489
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,400
information got to say

490
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:59,320
it with there pathogens triggering off

491
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,640
you know things with neurotox toxins

492
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,679
whether it's strep bacteria whether it's

493
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,280
toxic heavy metals whether it's

494
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,320
pesticides herbicide sprays

495
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,200
somewhere whatever it is we get

496
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,440
sensitive and these things trigger us

497
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,840
our our nervous system can get inflamed

498
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,480
from it and our nervous system can get

499
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,520
allergic to it so then now it's time to

500
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,320
heal so we go we try a supplement and we

501
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,120
feel like we

502
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,000
react we try to eat something different

503
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,919
and we feel like we can't handle it and

504
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,799
we react sensitivities that occur and

505
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,600
now we're stuck because then it becomes

506
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,039
this thing where we get wrapped up all

507
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,280
in it and rightfully so because it's

508
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,480
real the feelings we're having are real

509
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,600
they're not fake they're

510
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,840
real they're real true symptoms we're

511
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,400
actually experiencing even though

512
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,760
someone else hearing it might be like

513
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,960
what do you mean you can't handle some

514
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:59,080
noise what do you mean you can't handle

515
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,320
some hot some cold you you can't handle

516
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,120
the heater on here you can't handle this

517
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,000
you can't handle the blanket being too

518
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,360
warm you can't handle whatever it is you

519
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,679
can't handle something stimulating on

520
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,200
television you can't see a movie or

521
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,600
watch an action-packed movie you can't

522
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,159
do things that you want to do cuz the

523
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,400
nervous system got really hypers

524
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,520
sensitive and then it becomes this

525
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,159
vicious

526
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,400
cycle it's vicious

527
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,000
cycle and then it's like I want to heal

528
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,120
I want to try

529
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,039
something and then a lot of people end

530
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,440
up trying something that's toxic or

531
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:42,559
aggressive or not great for you they'll

532
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,159
try some Alkaline ionizer Water they'll

533
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,400
feel worse but don't know why they'll

534
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,480
try some bentonite clay they'll try some

535
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,960
kind of scratchy microbiome probiotic

536
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,960
powder they'll try some kind of greens

537
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,240
powder that has all kinds of stuff in it

538
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,720
nobody knew about like scratchy scratchy

539
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,960
stuff and their intestinal tract gets

540
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,799
irritated everything gets irritated and

541
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,480
the nerves get irritated because when we

542
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,960
eat things that aren't easy on our

543
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,080
system while we're hyper sensitive or we

544
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,200
take supplements that aren't easy on our

545
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,320
system while we're hypers sensitive we

546
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,919
react and then all of our nerves

547
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,679
everywhere fire up and they go on fire

548
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:22,200
all of our

549
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:25,520
nerves the Vegas nerves light up and

550
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,400
then where anxiety attacks panic attacks

551
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,480
itchy scratchy um all kinds of different

552
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,919
involuntary functions and jerks and

553
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,200
things like that weakness in the limbs

554
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,600
weird

555
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,679
vibrations itchiness you can't scratch

556
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,559
pinches on the body ticks and spasms and

557
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:49,360
I'm just naming a

558
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:51,080
few and we become very very sensitive

559
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,159
but we have to

560
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,720
heal we have to move forward and we have

561
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,919
to

562
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,799
heal we need a chance toal heal what do

563
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,120
we do the key is finding the right

564
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:07,200
supplements it don't have things in it

565
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,200
that aggravate the whole thing that

566
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,320
aggravate the whole

567
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,679
condition so I talk about taking

568
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,960
supplements a lot I do I talk about food

569
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:20,840
a lot I talk about supplementation a lot

570
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,760
I talk about meditations a lot I talk

571
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,799
about a lot of

572
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,720
things but when it comes down to

573
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,720
supplementation people who are sensitive

574
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,720
I

575
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,520
tell you start with one thing that's it

576
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,559
you start with one

577
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,120
thing and you can do something with it I

578
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,559
know people out there like I can't take

579
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,720
one thing I just can't take one

580
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,799
thing and then people need to understand

581
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,200
that you can take one thing you

582
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,080
can but it it takes just a little bit of

583
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,520
confidence A Little Bit of Faith a

584
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,480
little bit of understanding and an

585
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,000
acclamation process so so what happens

586
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,799
when people are on Rock Bottom with

587
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,039
their sensitivities they on Rock Bottom

588
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,799
with their nervous system conditions it

589
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,400
takes some

590
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,520
acclamation teaching the body that it's

591
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,480
going to be okay it's going to be all

592
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,400
right because we got receptors in the

593
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,720
neurons that are basically saying I've

594
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,520
been burned before I've been I've tried

595
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,520
this tried

596
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:26,320
that I've done this everything

597
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,960
hurts and so what you can do and here's

598
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,480
an example right here I got some beach

599
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,720
12 right here right that's the vimer G

600
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,320
B12 so I want to show

601
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,720
you okay what you can do is you take a

602
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:43,279
tiny drop right

603
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,360
here right tiny drop and you put it on

604
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,279
your

605
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,880
hand just like

606
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,679
this tiny drop right on your hand okay

607
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,400
just like that so I'm showing you guys

608
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,520
okay tiny drop just on the hand just

609
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,039
like this you could even go smaller than

610
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,799
that

611
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,480
okay and you'll let it sit there if

612
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,000
you're somebody with

613
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,799
sensitivities supplement

614
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,400
sensitivities someone who's been through

615
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:14,279
a lot nervous system

616
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,919
sensitivities that's one thing you can

617
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:20,039
start with right there you got your B12

618
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:24,279
you put a little bit right on your hand

619
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:29,360
and you can just dab it on there like

620
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:33,559
this you can do this once a day once a

621
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,720
day just like this your body starts to

622
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:39,840
acclimate it starts to prepare and get

623
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,120
ready for something that's going to help

624
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,799
change your

625
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,679
life change your body

626
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:51,360
systems change the

627
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:54,039
balance so it goes into a better place

628
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,240
and you do this once a day if you're

629
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:58,559
somebody hyper sensitive you do this

630
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,120
once a day

631
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,120
day you can leave it on there just for a

632
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,640
couple of minutes once a day when those

633
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,760
couple of minutes are up you do this can

634
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:13,399
wipe it right off that's

635
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,520
it what happens is your body's now

636
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:18,480
recalibrating rewiring your brain your

637
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,960
nervous system your entire body is

638
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,679
rewiring to that

639
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,720
B12 to that supplement now I like doing

640
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:31,080
this with B12 because B12 is fundament

641
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,520
Fally how we exist keep that in

642
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:39,480
mind it is fundamentally how we exist on

643
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,480
this planet we need B12 or we

644
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,600
die we have to either be producing some

645
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,399
of the B12 on our own in our

646
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,880
alium we have to be getting B12 from

647
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:54,159
some Source something out there or we

648
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,640
cease to live eventually our whole body

649
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,399
falls

650
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:02,720
apart Rob over there on Stitch is that

651
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:04,720
it twitch I was sensitive to liquid B12

652
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,440
last year I've since been able to

653
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,679
tolerate it more there's a light at the

654
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,880
UN end of the tunnel there is a light

655
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:17,039
there the end of the tunnel important to

656
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,640
know Michelle you said your B12 is your

657
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,080
favorite because what happens is that we

658
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,240
our bodies

659
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,679
naturally want B12 our bodies no matter

660
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,919
what our condition is no matter what

661
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,840
what our condition is whether we got

662
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,760
fibro whether we got lime whether we got

663
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:41,080
ra whether we got some other symptom and

664
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:44,880
condition no matter what it is our body

665
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:47,440
wants B12 it does Cara says I've been so

666
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,159
sensitive to all supplements in the past

667
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,279
especially b12 with years of applying

668
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,760
medical medium healing tools and lots of

669
00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:00,039
patience though it's now one of my

670
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,039
favorite supplements vimergy all the

671
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,279
way so on this test what happens is I

672
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,440
like doing it on the hand okay I do it

673
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,240
again I like doing it on the hand so

674
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,760
it's this once a

675
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,960
day what this does It prepares your

676
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,799
Vegas nerves that are inflamed It

677
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,520
prepares your central nervous system

678
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:21,840
your brain your

679
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,039
liver which is the

680
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,840
converter of supplements and what I love

681
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,120
about B12 I'm not speaking for all B12

682
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,520
out there I'm not because I don't know

683
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,600
the crap that's in beach2 bottles all

684
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,080
across the land I don't care who says

685
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,200
what and they got the best stuff going

686
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,840
on they buy the lower quality they buy

687
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,640
the lower

688
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,039
tier I've seen it all out there that's

689
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,240
why I support vinm that's why I work

690
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,039
with them because of this fact that

691
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,240
that's what companies do out there and I

692
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:54,640
become friends with so many different

693
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,519
companies and Company owners out there

694
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,799
and all through the land all these years

695
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,960
in the last 20 plus plus 30 plus years

696
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:04,200
and it's been the same story we can't do

697
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,320
that aw we can't make it good enough

698
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,600
like you wanted we can't do the quality

699
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,600
you want we can't make it so sensitive

700
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,799
people can take it sorry it's all about

701
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,720
the Dollar Bottom Dollar the bottom line

702
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,760
and themy doesn't do that they don't do

703
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,640
that to me that's why I actually support

704
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,320
them like I do because they don't do

705
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,960
that I become friends with them too over

706
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,919
the years and they don't do that they

707
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,039
said I'm not they said they said aw

708
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,200
we're not going to do that we wanted so

709
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,080
good we want to take it for ourselves we

710
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,120
want people to have

711
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,760
this and so I can't speak for all other

712
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,559
like like b12's out there but what I'm

713
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,840
trying to say is the methab balamin the

714
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,320
stos silab balamin right this these

715
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,080
co-enzymes right here in this bottle so

716
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,000
what I like to do is put it on the hand

717
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,159
for people who are

718
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,840
sensitive and you put it on their hand

719
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,440
you do a little rub like that you'll

720
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,760
leave it there for a good couple of

721
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,200
minutes you could leave it there longer

722
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,720
for 3 or 4 minutes it's fine

723
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,640
and you leave it there and you do that

724
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,159
once a day and then this acclamation

725
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,799
process happens now if you're somebody

726
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,600
you're not you're not even sensitive to

727
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,200
anything you take all your supplements

728
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,120
you do all your stuff you eat what you

729
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,279
want you go out you party whatever it is

730
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,679
you can still do this because you're

731
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,960
sending a message to your neurons you're

732
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,480
sending a message to your liver your

733
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,360
liver is already picking up on this this

734
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,600
goes to the skin it's heading into the

735
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,159
liver already drawing it in from this

736
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,360
process but in such a minute

737
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:36,760
amount on a level that is actually

738
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:39,679
Awakening your natural ability to absorb

739
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,320
assimilate and methylate supplementation

740
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,679
because if you've been that sensitive

741
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,919
where you're in that place where you're

742
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:49,000
super sensitive you've been through a

743
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:52,279

there So eventually what happens is

770
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:00,240
you're going to get to to a point where

771
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,639
you're like okay you're going to get to

772
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,519
a point where you're like okay that's

773
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:06,240
that's another bottle I use this one and

774
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,159
you're going to be able to

775
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,480
do one drop internally take a look at

776
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,799
that right so I want to show you a

777
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,760
close-up on that I'll just give you a

778
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:16,039
close-up on the one drop eventually

779
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,480
you'll do one drop

780
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:22,960
internally it's like this you guys see

781
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,960
that okay right and you add a little bit

782
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,279
water and you take one drop just like

783
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,000
that so I'm going to go and grab a

784
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,000
little bit of water

785
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,679
now and here we

786
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,760
go this isn't hot like super hot just a

787
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,519
little

788
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:45,240
warm one drop and you do this once a

789
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,200
day not only are you doing the

790
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,399
hand the hand

791
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,960
technique you're doing the one drop a

792
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:56,159
day if you're some sensitive that's how

793
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,240
you start each

794
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,559
day that's how you do it the nervous

795
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,840
system rewires everything rewires your

796
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:07,399
body takes it in your liver takes it in

797
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,399
you're methylating all of

798
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,919
it so that's

799
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,320
important to know that's one way to do

800
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:15,880
it eventually you move on and you're

801
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,880
like whoa you can take more you can take

802
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,279
a drop or full a day and you get to this

803
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,360
point and now things are happening in

804
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:25,399
your body you're getting stronger you're

805
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,600
getting past

806
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:30,760
sensitivities and you're now taking

807
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,679
one

808
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,240
dropper every day I mean it could be a

809
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,880
quarter dropper and that's where you go

810
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,360
and now you're taking one dropper every

811
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,919
day there it is Courtney ma says the

812
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,919
sale helps me so much that's

813
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,000
incredible and there we

814
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,919
go and we got one

815
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,639
dropper now what happens with

816
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,080
sensitivities this is an important

817
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:00,120
understanding right here because you're

818
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,399
so

819
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,279
hotwired your nervous system's so

820
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,399
hotwired you're so

821
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,919
sensitive you can react to something

822
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:11,000
else but you won't know what it is and

823
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,240
then you'll actually blame something

824
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,960
else do you know what I'm

825
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,200
saying you can react to this you eat

826
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,679
this you don't know if it's that you

827
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,880
don't know if it was the food you had an

828
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:21,799
hour ago you don't know if it was

829
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,320
something you ate yesterday you don't

830
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,519
know if it's a supplement you just took

831
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,200
you don't know if it's a supplement you

832
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,799
took the other day you don't know if

833
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,760
it's somebody who came over to visit you

834
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,440
you don't know if it was because you

835
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,679
were in a store and breathe in all this

836
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,159
fragrance you don't know if it was

837
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,840
because you were in the grocery store

838
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,760
and the protest manager was spraying

839
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,440
down some stuff and cleaning all the

840
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,480
racks and rails you don't know what it

841
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,200
is you don't know if it was The Toxic

842
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,159
conventional flowers at the supermarket

843
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,600
that are just blasting out the pesticide

844
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,960
as you walk by you don't know if it's

845
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,559
somebody's cologne you were standing in

846
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,080
line with but either way you actually

847
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:56,360
are having a reaction but you don't know

848
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,399
what it is and the first thing you might

849
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,840
do is just be like oh it was that one

850
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:05,080
drop of B12 I had oh it was that orange

851
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,760
I had you know oh ho maybe it was that

852
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,119
avocado I had or maybe it was something

853
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,760
else and that's where it gets really

854
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:15,200
difficult that's why

855
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,839
I beg of people to make sure they're

856
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,839
actually learning and understanding

857
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:21,000
what's actually in these

858
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,960
books how much you can learn and

859
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,119
knowledge you can take in so you can you

860
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,839
can protect yourself through all this

861
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:32,320
process you can climb out of this and

862
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:34,240
he so it's usually a really tough tough

863
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,079
ride up when you got all these

864
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,720
sensitivities it's a tough tough ride up

865
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:43,520
the ladder the healing ladder because

866
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:48,040
it's like I always said this is never

867
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:51,399
ever gets old this never

868
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,679
ever gets old three steps up two steps

869
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:54,639
back three steps up two steps back five

870
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,400
steps

871
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,440
up couple steps back six steps up one

872
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,400
step back back to three steps up two

873
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,440
steps back boom four steps back boom

874
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,520
seven steps up two more steps back

875
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,040
that's how healing

876
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,160
works and you're going up the ladder

877
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,599
that's how it works this never gets old

878
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,400
it's one of the most

879
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,800
profound powerful pieces of scripture

880
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:27,560
that are in the medical medium books all

881
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:30,359
these years three steps up two steps

882
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,000
back learning this is critical to

883
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:33,240
Healing you got sensitivities you got

884
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
supplement sensitivities food

885
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,960
sensitivities air sensitivities water

886
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,880
sensitivities you don't know if you're

887
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,560
coming or going and you're working on

888
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,119
your healing process you go three steps

889
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,560
up two steps back and that's how it

890
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,560
works as you're climbing

891
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:55,440
up yes and you're rising out of the

892
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,640
ashes this is all hogwash to someone

893
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,480
who's not sick

894
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,880
someone's not sick they're about what is

895
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,880
this unless there's some like a podcast

896
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,960
doctor that wants to steal the

897
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,359
information and then they'll there

898
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,839
another story they'll just listen

899
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,400
they'll get it and then they'll tell

900
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,800
their people and their people like oh my

901
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,480
God oh my God never heard anything like

902
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,760
it never knew we have low-grade viral

903
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,079
infections never heard of anything like

904
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,520
that never knew the flu can knock our

905
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,760
immune system down and something else

906
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,960
could

907
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,200
happen never knew heavy metals are

908
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,680
behind anxiety wow Dr blah blah blah

909
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,680
you're so

910
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:36,040
smart but the three steps up two steps

911
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,200
down Mac critical to know because it's

912
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,599
one of the most profound aspects of the

well so important all right now I'm

1028
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,359
going to put a little bit of water in

1029
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,319
here and I'm going to put some some

1030
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:00,800
orange in here right now almost lost

1031
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,640
that orange I threw it in an entirely

1032
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,680
different wrong

1033
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:09,720
direction and now we got it

1034
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,720
right let's get an orange

1035
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:18,560
cut yep I got my two dropper fulls of

1036
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,440
cat's claw in here two dropper fulls of

1037
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,559
zinc in here I'm putting a little bit of

1038
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,559
orange why am I putting a little bit of

1039
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,000
orange in in this one let's go into that

1040
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,280
a little bit

1041
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,280
I'm increasing the chances of making

1042
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,839
sure that all the phytochemical

1043
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,480
compounds and nutrients and cortin

1044
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,680
that's naturally like in the propolis

1045
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,960
and all the different all the different

1046
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,400
incredible incredible nutrients that are

1047
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,680
in these medicinals right what I'm doing

1048
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,240
is put a little orange in there because

1049
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,839
that orange is glucose you know what

1050
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:55,160
that means glucose

1051
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:58,520
delivers the nutrient to the

1052
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,160
cell and that's the whole thing I love

1053
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,640
about vimer to begin with they got the

1054
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,079
flax

1055
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,119
glycerin it's a whole another game it

1056
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:10,839
helps to deliver nutrients to the cell

1057
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,880
right and then I step it up I crank it

1058
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,720
up I put a little bit of orange in

1059
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,440
there so that the constituents so that

1060
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,240
the phytochemical compound so that the

1061
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,800
anthocyan so that the the polyphenols

1062
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,920
everything in here and the enzymes and

1063
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,880
everything else that's in there and the

1064
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,880
co-enzymes all get delivered easily into

1065
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,800
the cells into the organs they get

1066
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,680
pulled into the cells and organs because

1067
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,880
you're driving it in with the glucose

1068
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,400
you have to have sugar in order to take

1069
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,960
a nutrient into a cell you can take all

1070
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,880
the supplements you want out there in

1071
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,599
the world all the different things you

1072
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,200
want in the world and if you don't have

1073
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:52,079
enough glucose in your bloodstream you

1074
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,880
won't get all of it in your cells that's

1075
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,079
an important piece of information vital

1076
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,760
to Healing all on its own

1077
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,800
Bobby over there on Facebook it's a

1078
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,359
whole party in that

1079
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,319
cup it

1080
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,839
is mixing it up right now just Naturally

1081
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,839
by doing

1082
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,880
this back to this piece of information

1083
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,319
on how critical critical this is it

1084
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,160
takes sugar glucose in your bloodstream

1085
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:23,359
to drive a nutrient into your organ and

1086
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,160
cells big reason why a lot of people

1087
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,119
take all their supplements and they're

1088
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,280
doing the intermittent fasting and they

1089
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,720
got their glucose is really low and they

1090
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,839
just did a workout they did a workout

1091
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,880
they were on the treadmill they were

1092
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,960
doing weights in the gym they were doing

1093
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,240
their you know their resistance

1094
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,760
training and they're taking all these

1095
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,400

00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,520
into the cells and what happens is when

1113
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,760
you're sick and you got neurological

1114
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,680
problems if you don't have some glucose

1115
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,760

1116
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,200

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,520
liver carry them into your

1118
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,880
organs they're not going to go as deep

00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,000
they're not going to go as far and

1120
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,160

with my immune system I think about my

1128
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:14,400
immune

1129
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,200
cells that's what I think about I sit

1130
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,319
down for a couple of minutes after I've

1131
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,119

00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,680
my white blood cells I know I've told

1135
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,480

therapies this is the pro this is the

1210
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,119
pro um protocols book that has all of

1211
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,520
them in there Kelly Burke over there on

1212
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,720
YouTube aw can you please talk about

1213
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,240
taking supplements like B12 zinc D3 and

1214
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,480
iodine on an empty stomach this has been

1215
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,160
something recommended by some

1216
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,359
practitioners in the

1217
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,200
community you can take them any way you

1218
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:09,599
like and you can take them any way your

1219
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,799
doctor prescribes

1220
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,799
it but if you don't have enough glucose

1221
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:17,119
in your

1222
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:21,920
system then the supplements aren't going

1223
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:24,640
to actually get deep enough into your

1224
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,000
system it's partly why you see the

1225
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,359
vitamin C sh

1226
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,119
therapy there was orange put into the

1227
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,119
vitamin C shock

1228
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,079
therapy it's also partly why I was

1229
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:36,839
talking about before I put a little

1230
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:40,480
orange in the

1231
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:44,200
immune little immune tonic that I made

1232
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:47,000
cocktail but the good news with the viy

1233
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:50,040
supplements because they're not in

1234
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,319
alcohol they're alcohol-free they're in

1235
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:57,160
the flax glycerin you do get some

1236
00:50:53,319 --> 00:51:00,280
glucose which is why they work work so

1237
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,119
good it's why they work so good so if

1238
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,520
you have to empty stomach them because

1239
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:05,119
your doctor or your practitioner saids

1240
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,040
so then that's that's fine perfectly

1241
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:11,680
fine but if you add just a little bit

1242
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,440
more of glucose in there you don't have

1243
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,520
to do it this way maybe you had some

1244
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,280
celery juice a half an hour ago you got

1245
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,000
some glucose from the celery

1246
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,640
juice maybe you had some lemon water an

1247
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,160
hour before you got some glucose from

1248
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,240
the lemon water so you're still in the

1249
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:28,559
ballpark you're still okay

1250
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,839
Don't Panic or anything you'll they

1251
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,359
you'll still work it's just there's

1252
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:34,440
people out there that just drink coffee

1253
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:36,079
with no sugar in the coffee and then

1254
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,400
they go take their supplements and it

1255
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,000
never gets anywhere unless it's the

1256
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,599
vimergy supplements and there's that

1257
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,160
flax there's that flax glycerin and that

1258
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:49,000
does help that that gets it in there too

1259
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:51,359
so Frederick go says why does zinc cause

1260
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,319
nausea for so many on an empty stomach

1261
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:56,119
so first of all let's go into

1262
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:57,440
that so

1263
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,799
there's zincs out there they'll just

1264
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,839
make you throw right up they'll just

1265
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:05,119
make you throw right

1266
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:06,559
up and that's why like vimergy changed

1267
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,079
the rules with

1268
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,359
zinc you go into the store you go into

1269
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:11,720
whatever the health food store and you

1270
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:13,720
look on the rack and you see the

1271
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,400
different zincs and stuff like that you

1272
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,760
take one it's got all that citric acid

1273
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,960
in there and all this other stuff in

1274
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,480
there you take it boom nauseous boom you

1275
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,400
throw up so many people have just

1276
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:27,000
vomited and vomited because of that the

1277
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,400
liquid zinc sulfate the way it's done

1278
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,920
with the flax glycerin and everything

1279
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,680
else the way it's done with fmer is a

1280
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,920
whole different ballpark but ask your

1281
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,200
doctor what's right for you your doctor

1282
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,200
knows

1283
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,839
best and if you're really really hyper

1284
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:43,440
sensitive yeah zinc just like selenium

1285
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:46,079
can make you feel a little nauseous if

1286
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,160
you're really really hyper sensitive but

1287
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,920
the problem is a lot of other things are

1288
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:54,200
getting you nauseous too keep that in

1289
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,680
mind if you're somebody where zinc a

1290
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,160
really good zinc like you're somebody

1291
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,359
wear a really good zinc like this right

1292
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,559
here gets you slightly nauseous then

1293
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,680
that means you're getting nauseous when

1294
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,200
you eat different things you're getting

1295
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,839
nauseous when you take a different thing

1296
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,799
you're getting nauseous when you do this

1297
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:10,680
it means you got the Vagas nerve nause

1298
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:12,960
nausea always

1299
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,280
happening and someone who's sensitive

1300
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,599
and they get the nausea then take it

1301
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,000
with food take your supplements with

1302
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,559
food is what I tell friends and family

1303
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,359
