00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,760
already i've heard i got some comments

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,720
here some people have tried it i'm blown

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,000
away i'm so happy about it because

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,320
light has been a big deal in my life for

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,279
decades since age four with spirit of

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,960
compassion communicating with me and so

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,079
it's very dear to my heart and i wanted

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,600
to

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,399
i wanted to give you guys this

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,840
meditation because i know there's

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,200
other light workers out there i know

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,920
there's other light stuff out there i

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,320
know that but in this meditation though

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,239
it's a little different because you're

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
learning how to control the light use

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,680
the light and then pinpoint it and

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,360
that's the key right there is

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,120
pinpointing that light

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,079
and the only way you truly can pinpoint

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,320
light

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,920
is if you actually move

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,439
your nose

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,720
and your mouth

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,240
away from your face so you have to check

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,920
out this meditation i'll talk about a

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,759
little bit i want to read some comments

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
read some points too

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
i want to answer some questions if we

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
can along the way too if you guys just

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,439
got here we're live right now i'm

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,479
talking about the breathing light

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,840
meditation right for the emotional

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,159
spiritual physical parts of our lives

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,040
for the mental emotional physical all of

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,320
it spiritual part of our lives so

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,119
i know and when we use the light

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,520
and we actually take our consciousness

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,000
and we connect to the light right

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,479
and we use our consciousness to do so

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,360
we can then control the light

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:53,520
and guide it into areas of the body that

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,040
you need any assistance or you need aid

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,880

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
much power to it because

in it

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,440

medical books okay most popular health

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,159
books in the world right the medical

108
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,319
medium series and i've been teaching

109
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,400
about what goes wrong inside of us so we

110
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,159
can heal so that's what i'm known for

111
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,159
but i'm also known

112
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,599
for the spiritual aspect too right and

113
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,959
and then but

114
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,599
what this is this meditation

115
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,680
it's a powerful tool that you can

116
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,760
control

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,360
you have control and empowerment here

118
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,920
that's the difference

119
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,919
i want this to be a surprise it's a very

120
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,799
special meditation

121
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,359
and

122
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,120
it's dear to my heart this meditation

123
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,360
i'm getting choked up i'm actually

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,560
getting choked up you guys

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600
i'm getting emotional here

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,600
because

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,840
i know that when you have something like

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,400
this in your hands

129
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,160
you can make changes that are

130
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,960
unmeasurable

131
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
like

132
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,720
i taught you guys how to heal your

133
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,320
bodies right physically how to heal your

134
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,280
bodies with all the different tools that

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,040
i taught you guys to use right

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,280
and then

137
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,720
but this tool

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,040
right

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,919
takes it to another level because this

140
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,360
is a tool that you have full control

141
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,440
over

142
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,039
and then anything's possible because

143
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,039
you're using the light so anything's

144
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,919
possible anything

145
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,840
right

146
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,600
who am i to say anything's not possible

147
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,400
because i've seen

148
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,919
what it has done for people in my life

149
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,560
throughout my

150
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,720
years i wanted you guys to have this in

151
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,400
your hand but i needed to be

152
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,280
in a space

153
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,199
able to do it right now you guys know

154
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,720
that i worked on the brainsaver books

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,600
and i finished the brainsaver books

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,600
right

157
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,280
it took a toll on me

158
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,680
and i could not

159
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,240
i could not just give you this breathing

160
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,560
light meditation just like i'll just

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,199
throw it out i'll throw it out there and

162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,240
i'll just blab it out and

163
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,680
i had to make sure i was connected

164
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,320
to soc i had to make sure that i was in

165
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,919
that light when i did this meditation

166
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,240
and recorded this meditation for you

167
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,160
guys and i knew i had to get past the

168
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
brain book because that was a different

169
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,880
place i was in that was about taking

170
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,960
tremendous amounts of information from

171
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,479
above right

172
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,160
ahead of science information that

173
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,319
science will then fuse and take or

174
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,080
whatever right and i had to make sure

175
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,360
that the brain books were done and soon

176
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,360
as they're done

177
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360

the breathing light meditation it builds

231
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,360
on itself

232
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,919
and there's a spot in that meditation

233
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,080
where you can choose

234
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,960
the place on your body that you feel

235
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,680
like was injured that you feel like that

236
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,240
maybe something happened in your life

237
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,039
and you can choose that moment to direct

238
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,840
the light to that spot that you want to

239
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
direct that light to now in the

240
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,199
meditation all right there's different

241
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,599
areas i talk about where you direct the

242
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,680
light into so you'll know like where you

243
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,560
can direct the light into

244
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,479
and

245
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,560
what you what you can do in this

246
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,800
meditation is then right when it comes

247
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,599
to the point where i say now choose a

248
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,720
spot that you want to bring that light

249
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,480
in

250
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,480
right you can even think about it before

251
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,040
you do the meditation what spot would i

252
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,519
like to bring the light in so when you

253
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,120
do the meditation you can then drive

254
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,279
that light into that place that's very

255
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,920
important to you like something that's

256
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,519
ailing you something that's

257
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,519
something that you feel like you've been

258
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,200
harmed or hurt throughout your life any

259
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,720
kind of place

260
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,640
maybe you had an accident maybe

261
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
something happened in your life maybe

262
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,320
you've been wounded in a different way

263
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,640
emotionally physically you can take that

264
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
light and direct that light into that

265
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,839
place

266
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,000
inside your body

267
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,399
and inside your soul if you need to

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
inside your heart your soul your mind

269
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,680
your body all of it so it's really

270
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,880
important

271
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,560
to know you have that control so

272
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,160
i want to read a couple of comments here

273
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,800
too is well first of all let's let's

274
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,640
just go into this here so what i like

275
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,560
about this here's one thing right here

276
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,080
discover the power of the light as it

277
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,640
moves through your body and destroys

278
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,040
disease darkness toxic emotions guilt

279
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,760
shame fear doubts and worry now a lot of

280
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,640
us

281
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,880
we we put boundaries up

282
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,959
because we've been hurt so we have to

283
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,800
put boundaries up that's how we protect

284
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,320
ourselves right but when we put

285
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,560
boundaries up

286
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,480
because we've been hurt

287
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,000
right we also

288
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,839
don't know how to heal we can't heal so

289
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,279
easily we need the boundaries up

290
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,720
sometimes

291
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,880
because we need them to protect

292
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,720
ourselves but at the same time once that

293
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,399
boundary is built

294
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,399
and it's there it's there in our

295
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,480
consciousness it's there in our memory

296
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,720
banks it's there in our brain and mind

297
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
right and that boundaries there

298
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,519
then it's hard to do some healing that

299
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,560
needs to be done behind those boundaries

300
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,480
and people

301
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,000
they don't know how this works a little

302
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,160
bit where whoa they're like they got

303
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,480
their boundaries up but yet there's a

304
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,720
wound down in behind that boundary

305
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,720
there's a wound in there and how do we

306
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,839
reach that wound and have access to

307
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,680
healing it

308
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,240
this meditation

309
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,680
allows you to take light go through the

310
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
boundary

311
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,360
and into that place that you've been

312
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,600
hurt physically emotionally spiritually

313
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,720
mentally in that place where you've been

314
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,000
hurt and harmed in some way

315
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,519
so that you can still keep the

316
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
boundaries up that you've had to

317
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,200
throughout life because you've been hurt

318
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,959
throughout your life but at the same

319
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
time you can bring light through the

320
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,079
boundary

321
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,240
into a place where you want to heal

322
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,399
can bring that light into the heart you

323
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,399
can bring that light

324
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,839
into the places you want to bring that

325
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,120
light into

326
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,399
you can bring it into that consciousness

327
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,399
right bring that into the

328
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
subconsciousness which is incredible

329
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,320
michelle stinnett says i'm finally able

330
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
to focus on meditation since healing my

331
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
physical symptoms with your life-saving

332
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,200
healing meditation that's a really good

333
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,800
point right there medical media

334
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,600
meditations

335
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,600
very gentle powerful but gentle it's a

336
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,760
different form of meditation than what's

337
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,680
out there in the meditation world

338
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,279
it's there for the chronically ill and

339
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,720
the chronically sick who have a lot of

340
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,760
sensitivities

341
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,440
and so these meditations are geared for

342
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,720
someone who's been through a lot

343
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,639
physically

344
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,880
with symptoms and conditions they've

345
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,880
been through so much

346
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,120
right so that's the kind of meditations

347
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,880
these are it's like the moon meditation

348
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,800
is powerful in all the medical medium

349
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,079
meditations the fruit picking meditation

350
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,720

self-sabotage behavior

359
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,560
absolutely because what happens is that

360
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,519
when we get light into places

361
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,839

right and what's inside our brain we

368
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,200
don't know where our injuries are

369
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,000
when they're emotional and spiritual

370
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,079
right

371
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,320
and mental so we don't know where those

372
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,360

373
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,079

now what's amazing about this meditation

378
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,040
is you'll feel it

379
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,720
as time goes on after you've done the

380
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,560
meditation so once you do it the

381
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,959
breathing light meditation

382
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,079
you then can

383
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,000
feel the results as you go along you'll

384
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,560
start being like whoa

385
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,200
wait a minute that's starting to feel

386
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,880
like i feel lighter now and emily

387
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
marshall said i did the meditation and

388
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,800
it was amazing i need to keep practicing

389
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,079
the visualization so here's what's

390
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,079
incredible about the breathing light

391
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,240
meditation you'll notice it has the word

392
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,959
breathing in front of it right

393
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,800
now but yet it's not a breathing

394
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,800
meditation

395
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,639
where it's just all breathing

396
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,600
that's not it

397
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,000
this is

398
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,560
very powerful very gentle

399
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,399
this is about the light so when you do

400
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,480
this breathing like meditation you'll

401
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,360
notice in the title breathing

402
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,600
light

403
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,760
meditation

404
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,160
there's a big difference right there

405
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,040
dr fon md hey aw can you direct the

406
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,880
light into a loved one yes you can you

407
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,880
can right in that meditation where it

408
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
says where would you like the light to

409
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,519
go

410
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,560
you choose

411
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,800
an option to where you want to drive

412
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,800
that light

413
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,120
inside that meditation right when you're

414
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,440
doing the meditation if it's a loved one

415
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,600
that's where you send that light so when

416
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,680
you're doing the visual visualization

417
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,360
when you're in that meditation and your

418
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,199
consciousness is all connected to the

419
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,399
light and you're in there

420
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,360
then you can say i want to direct this

421
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,839
light to a loved one

422
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,440
and that's where you send it and imagine

423
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,720
and visualize and see and connect to

424
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,079
that loved one when you're in the

425
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,399
meditation

426
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,560
and then have the light drive into now

427
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,399
the difference with this meditation

428
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,600
is something that's spirit of compassion

429
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,480
taught me

430
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,680
like more than 30 years ago okay when i

431
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,279
was young when i was a child and it's

432
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,120
taking your nose

433
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,600
taking your mouth

434
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,000
and actually moving it

435
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,040
moving it to a different place on the

436
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
body

437
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,959
to a place you want that light to be

438
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,040
pinpointed divine light says can we

439
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,639
choose the whole body instead of just

440
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,399
one spot

441
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,000
you can on that one time right and one

442
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,760
powerful time because you're building up

443
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
in that meditation and when that one

444
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,199
powerful time comes

445
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,800
and

446
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,880
where do you want that light to go

447
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,560
if you want it your whole body then

448
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,639
that's where the light goes your whole

449
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,480
body in that place

450
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,279
and that's where you can do it

451
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,360
which is just amazing stephanie chu says

452
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,360
hi anthony i did the meditation last

453
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,959
night pain in my gallbladder was not

454
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,240
there when i woke up

455
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,560
i focused on that area extra that's the

456
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,120
whole point that's what you can do with

457
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,600
this incredible tool i had the pain for

458
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,040
three days straight and now it's gone

459
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,360
thank you so much i am working on

460
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,800
healing every day even when i fail

461
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,959
sometimes

462
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,680
there's no failing there's no feeling at

463
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,759
all

464
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,320
right which is the learning experience

465
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,279
as we heal and we grow and we do the

466
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,399
things we need to do and then sometimes

467
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,399
everybody doesn't have it easy and

468
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,320
it's not our fault if we get kicked back

469
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,839
a little bit or we try or we go back to

470
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,279
some kind of an old habit or whatever it

471
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,399
is so you never fail you're always

472
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,160
moving forward

473
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,160
each time you try something new and you

474
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,240
you know put forward your head

475
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,000

me and the healing light

504
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,559
that happens within this breathing light

505
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,280
meditation is profound you're

506
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,280
controlling it you're a part of it and

507
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,960
they don't want you missing out if you

508
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,720
get a chance i know you guys are busy

509
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,120
you've got a lot going on but if you get

510
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,280
a chance right

511
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,880
it would be incredible

512
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,960
and you get a chance and you try the

513
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,679
meditation

514
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
joanne says how often can you do these

515
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,120
meditations you could do them every day

516
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,360
you could do them twice a day you could

517
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,400
do them every day you can do them every

518
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,760
other day

519
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,520
right

520
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,080
so medical medium podcast at apple

521
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,760
podcast or or spotify if you want to go

522
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,240
you know those are two two platforms

523
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,120
right there breathing light meditation

524
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,400
okay

525
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,720
and so

526
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,880
look i explained in this meditation how

527
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,919
limitations taught by others block

528
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,160
profound information from entering our

529
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,039
being now so here's what happens

530
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,440
we can have boundaries bestowed upon us

531
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,520
from others and not even realize it

532
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,520
because we've been conditioned so what

533
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,280
happens is we go through life and we end

534
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,960
up getting conditioned we can have

535
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,799
boundaries bestowed upon us by

536
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,200
institutions we can have boundaries

537
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,360
bestowed upon us by organizations we can

538
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,520
have boundaries bestowed upon us

539
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,360
blocking our ability to heal

540
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,720
right heal emotionally

541
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,559
by others

542
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,039
and these boundaries can be set up not

543
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,320
even by yourself or who you are these

544
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,960
boundaries can be set up by others

545
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,039
and so and institutions and other

546
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,799
organizations can literally set these

547
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,160
boundaries for you so then you're

548
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,640
blocked

549
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,640
you end up getting blocked and it

550
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,120
interferes with your decision making so

551
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,039
when you want to make the right decision

552
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,000
there's this boundary blockage that

553
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,840
stops you from making the right decision

554
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,600
it's really painful it can happen to a

555
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,760
lot of people so

556
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,000
this meditation is there to just be like

557
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,840
you know what you know what

558
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,840
no organization

559
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,400
no

560
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,640
institution

561
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,080
nobody of some type of institution

562
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,559
organization

563
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,320
right no something else and what their

564
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,480
belief system is

565
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,080
that created a boundary whatever it is

566
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,000
these boundaries that could be in me

567
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,080
that were created by so much that we're

568
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,559
brainwashed about here

569
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,840
this is like the on

570
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,160
brainwashing meditation the breathing

571
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,919
light meditation because what it does is

572
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,960
it puts everything aside

573
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,240
everything aside that we've been

574
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,360
messed with or entrapped with in this

575
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,720
lifetime because of so much darkness and

576
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,039
so much evil that's happening in the

577
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,960
world right we don't know it but we get

578
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,120
thrown into that spider web this

579
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,039
meditation is about moving all of that

580
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,440
away you become this free spirit

581
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,159
and then you're using the light to

582
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,559
pinpoint and direct in places of the

583
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,559
body that you want like you can do that

584
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,360
and put it in a place that counts that

585
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,200
you feel that's where i want that light

586
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,640
and so the goal of the meditation of

587
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,159
what happens the reason why it's so

588
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,840
profound is because once you're in that

589
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,080
meditation you're now connecting to the

590
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,559
light

591
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,120
and if you if you want this is important

592
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,080
too okay whatever you like whatever you

593
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,720
like about the light meaning if it's

594
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,799
god's light then that's what you connect

595
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,760
to if you believe i just talked to

596
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,000
someone the other day like well i

597
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,679
believe in a creator i don't i don't use

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,360
the term god i just believe there's a

599
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,679
creature okay well that's the light you

600
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
use i talked to another person and

601
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,360
they're like well i believe in the

602
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,200
universe you know universal light this

603
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,200
is the light from the okay well then the

604
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,120
universal light that's what you use

605
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,799
inside this meditation then it's the

606
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,480
universal way

607
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,760
you know another person i believe it's

608
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,080
the light of jesus christ well then

609
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,200
that's that's what you actually channel

610
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,240
you make sure it's that light

611
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,159
so

612
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,159
you know so what you can do with the

613
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,039
power of this light is you can just make

614
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,440
sure

615
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,919
you use this light in the way that works

616
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,200
for you but it's there it's at your

617
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,799
fingertips

618
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,640
it's in this meditation it's this is a

619
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,200
way look we all have access to light but

620
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,000
this is a great tool to really connect

621
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
with it because we get so busy we get so

622
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,960
stuck

623
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,440
we get so stagnant

624
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,080
we get trapped in so many things and so

625
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,679
this is a way to move all that aside and

626
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,559
bring that light in

627
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,360
joanna gristo says can you direct this

628
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,760
to a pet absolutely a hundred percent

629
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,919
you can direct that light to a pet when

630
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,679
you do this incredible meditation this

631
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,000

633
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,720
over there and to talk to you guys

634
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,880
rachel says do you just visualize moving

635
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,120
your nose and mouth to a point on your

636
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
body yes we're moving her nose and her

637
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,200
mouth both

638
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,799
we're taking him

639
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,159
and we're moving them

640
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,240
so here's what we're doing we're taking

641
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,840
our nose and mouth right and we're

642
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,960
moving them

643
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,559
removing them all of a sudden here

644
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,320
so now when you're doing that breathing

645
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,240
light meditation

646
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,760
you're actually breathing here because

647
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,720
your nose and your mouth are now here

648
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,880
and then

649
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,480
we're taking our nose and our mouth

650
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,320
we're removing it from here we're

651
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,200
putting it here

652
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,120
right

653
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,520
right in that belly button we're putting

654
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,960
it there and then we're bringing that

655
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,120
light in

656
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,039
it's a technique spirit taught me back

657
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,440
when i was a child

658
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,400
i've used it in my life

659
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,799
right

660
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,240
but there's so many tools i look

661
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,440

662
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,559

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,840
right

733
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,799

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,320
thing is here's something to know about

752
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,840
the medical media meditations

753
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,880
i just have to be clear about this

754
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,400
because i know there's a lot of new

755
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,760
people and they just don't know and i

756
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,240
understand

757
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,840
it's not man-made

758
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,440
this meditation

759
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
the breathing light meditation is not

760
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,240
man-made

761
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,840
so it's not like someone like kind of

762
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,679
knew about another meditation that was

763
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,520
made by another man by another

764
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,440
meditation made by another man another

765
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,200
meditation made by another man and then

766
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,760
well i'll add a little thing to it too

767
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,000
because i'm i'm a guy in the spiritual

768
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,559
movement let me just create a meditation

769
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,320
here look let me man-made it

770
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,559
let me man make it

771
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,400
it's not man-made

772
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,120
and that's why

773
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,080
the meditations do what they do

774
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,279
because they're not actually made by a

775
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,440
guy

776
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,279
who decided to start

777
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,600
you know getting into the spiritual

778
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,520
movement at a certain time in his life

779
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,200
went to some retreats

780
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,360
and decided to make a meditation so

781
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,400
a whole bunch of women can try

782
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,200
because

783
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,159
women make meditations too but really it

784
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,320
started out with guys making meditations

785
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,840
this is not a guy's meditation it's not

786
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,080
a woman's meditation either it's not a

787
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,600
man's meditation it's not a woman's made

788
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,720
meditation

789
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,480
so

790
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,720
and this is important to know

791
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,720
it's from above so this meditation is

792
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,880
made from above

793
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,600
so it comes from above

794
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,679
and so that's the difference with this

795
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,000
there's nothing wrong when a guy makes a

796
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,279
meditation

797
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,799

798
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,399

hands like this

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,279
and here's what you're doing you're

809
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,919
you're trying to knock out all the all

810
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,919
the voices in your head you're trying to

811
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,360
knock out all the noise in your head

812
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,360
you're getting rid of all the noise in

813
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,200
your mind you're clearing your mind

814
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,120
you're breathing in and then you know

815
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,120
you see the sun and you clear your mind

816
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,600
and i'm like okay been done a billion

817
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,440

818
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,200
okay that's fine

819
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,440

meditation for sure when you get a

822
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,919
chance

823
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,760
try this meditation that wasn't created

824
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,960
by a guy

825
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,760
so

826
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,840
it's really a special tool is what i'm

827
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,240
saying and that's what i want you guys

828
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,520
to know and have in your hands it's

829
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,200
important to me

830
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,279
because

831
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,840
it this is got a

832
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,760
personal connection to me it really does

833
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,880
and these meditations aren't just thrown

834
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,720
out there

835
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,640
like lightly you know like meditation

836
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,080
apps and stuff like that meditation

837
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,240
podcast what happens is they're just

838
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,880
literally they're there so people can

839
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,000
get into them but the personal

840
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,440
connection

841
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,880
and it comes from above that's

842
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,880
what helps me with the meditation

843
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,000
it's not sterile

844
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,840
so

845
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,200
the thing is is what you'll learn and

846
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,679
what you'll know when you do this

847
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,840
meditation it's not sterile

848
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,840
it's not sterile

849
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,799
this meditation

850
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,039
right

851
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,520
it becomes a part of you

852
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,080
because guess what

853
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,159
you're the person who's in control and

854
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,080
empowered you're the person that's

855
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,200
gaining that control over the light and

856
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,720
using it to place into a part of your

857
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,320
body or your soul

858
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,559
or wherever

859
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,000
you feel you want to bring that light in

860
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,720
and

861
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,080
yeah be prepared to feel some changes

862
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,000
christina

863
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,760
do we move our nose and mouth to the

864
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,520
other person when we want to direct it

865
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,159
to them yes you do you have to you do

866
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,159
that or how do we direct it you have to

867
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,520
take your nose and mouth

868
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,520
and your nose and mouth is going to go

869
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,799
on to that other person

870
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,279
so you're going to place your nose and

871
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,520
mouth onto the other person

872
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,520
wherever you want

873
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,679
wherever you want wherever you want that

874
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,120
light to enter into the other person do

875
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,120
you want it to enter into their heart

876
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,360
do you want that light to enter into

877
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,159
their brain their heart to their third

878
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,559
eye do you want it to enter

879
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,039
right into their abdomen

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,279
into their leg do where do you want that

881
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,039
light to enter into their body you want

882
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,480
it to hit their whole body so you put

883
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,840
your mouth and nose on your body and you

884
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,760
want to hit the whole body if you want

885
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,000
but having the nose amount that's where

886
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,279
it has to go in though

887
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,440
um

888
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,919

894
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,840
betrayal that's a big one

895
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,919
chelsea floyd i love that your

896
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,399

really does

901
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,240
so what i was saying before allow

902
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,000
yourself to break boundaries in

903
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,720
unproductive belief systems because what

904
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,840
happens is we fall into all these belief

905
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,760
systems that end up controlling us

906
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,519
because there's money tons of money

907
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,200
behind those belief systems out there

908
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,039
and they end up just controlling us and

909
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,000
brainwashing us and this is about

910
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,159
clearing that which is incredible

911
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,679
right

912
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,600
and

913
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,200
see how the supernatural powerful light

914
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,640
source that's what i call powerful light

915
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320

something changes

919
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,919

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,880
