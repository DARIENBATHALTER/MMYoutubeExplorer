[599.04 - 602.76] notes everywhere
[600.78 - 604.92] right
[602.76 - 608.58] the Heat of the Moment as we go through
[604.92 - 611.90] life we come across difficult situations
[608.58 - 615.60] betrayal loss heartbreak loneliness
[611.90 - 618.06] confrontation all of us experience these
[615.60 - 621.00] one way or another somehow or some way
[618.06 - 622.98] we do even if things are going okay for
[621.00 - 625.74] a while they're going good for a while
[622.98 - 627.00] and then boom we experience that like
[625.74 - 630.62] they're going okay for a while going
[627.00 - 630.62] okay and then we experience it
[630.96 - 635.70] all of us experience these one way or
[633.36 - 637.80] another we get emotionally hurt and the
[635.70 - 639.78] physical aspect of this goes wholly
[637.80 - 644.10] ignored
[639.78 - 646.32] no one gives a crap about stuff
[644.10 - 650.46] happening in our lives and it affecting
[646.32 - 652.32] us physically people don't care
[650.46 - 653.64] you can get in a confrontation with
[652.32 - 657.30] somebody or something or something
[653.64 - 659.34] happens and just no one cares if it
[657.30 - 661.74] affected anyone physically I've seen
[659.34 - 663.92] this over and over again
[661.74 - 663.92] foreign
[666.30 - 671.04] when we get emotionally hurt a physical
[668.94 - 673.50] aspect occurs inside our body but
[671.04 - 675.36] nobody's like saying oh
[673.50 - 678.24] sorry about that I hope you physically
[675.36 - 681.90] aren't sicker because of that really bad
[678.24 - 683.58] argument we had that we started or I
[681.90 - 686.28] started or whatever it is no one's
[683.58 - 689.34] saying hey you know I'm so sorry you're
[686.28 - 691.98] probably you know physically sick from
[689.34 - 693.02] this for days
[691.98 - 695.40] foreign
[693.02 - 697.38] s to so many people to get physically
[695.40 - 699.84] sick from all kinds of confrontations
[697.38 - 703.46] and other kinds of emotional things that
[699.84 - 703.46] happen it's really sad
[703.80 - 709.94] we need to address the physical core
[706.38 - 709.94] strength of the brain
[711.06 - 714.78] we need to address that so that no
[713.40 - 716.94] matter what we're experiencing
[714.78 - 718.86] emotionally or what we're thinking that
[716.94 - 721.98] inner core strength of the brain can
[718.86 - 724.56] survive emotional injuries we want to
[721.98 - 727.08] strengthen the core of the brain so that
[724.56 - 728.94] we don't get these emotional injuries so
[727.08 - 731.04] they're not hurting us or not hitting us
[728.94 - 732.78] hard and the adrenal fight or flight
[731.04 - 735.12] stabilizer is one of these incredible
[732.78 - 739.14] ways to protect ourselves
[735.12 - 741.48] which is a big deal it's really big deal
[739.14 - 743.64] incredible
[741.48 - 746.34] when we have a loss or betrayal our
[743.64 - 748.14] physical brain can become injured people
[746.34 - 750.18] don't realize that when we're betrayed
[748.14 - 752.34] we can get these little tiny micro
[750.18 - 754.68] injuries inside our brain and talk about
[752.34 - 757.10] that all through these incredible books
[754.68 - 757.10] right here
[759.72 - 762.90] especially if our brain doesn't have
[761.40 - 764.52] what it needs and that's another problem
[762.90 - 766.98] a lot of times our brain doesn't have
[764.52 - 769.14] always what it needs and it said part of
[766.98 - 772.32] what injures the brain is not the broken
[769.14 - 775.20] trust itself like the broken trust
[772.32 - 777.24] that causes us to just be like oh that
[775.20 - 779.76] broken trust
[777.24 - 782.70] it's the fire that occurs when an event
[779.76 - 786.00] like that happens so that's what goes on
[782.70 - 788.46] it's the fire that blows up in our head
[786.00 - 791.70] when we've been let down and broken
[788.46 - 794.10] trust has happened it's the fire that
[791.70 - 796.68] lights up inside the brain that's why
[794.10 - 798.60] the adrenal fight-or-flight stabilizer
[796.68 - 801.72] is so critical for people it's why it's
[798.60 - 803.28] in here it's why it's so powerful
[801.72 - 806.46] laughs
[803.28 - 810.50] that fire is the heating up of the brain
[806.46 - 810.50] in intense electrical Heat
[812.52 - 817.80] stress loss trauma and betrayal burn hot
[815.52 - 821.34] as well so if we're under stress it
[817.80 - 823.62] burns the brain hot
[821.34 - 825.90] if we had any kind of loss it burns the
[823.62 - 828.72] brain hot trauma burns the brain up
[825.90 - 830.46] betrayal burns the brain hot that's what
[828.72 - 833.04] happens that's why we need this
[830.46 - 836.16] stabilizer and we're not just talking
[833.04 - 838.38] about one angry spell of the Year we're
[836.16 - 840.60] talking about every day frustrations too
[838.38 - 842.64] everyday frustrations lights the brain
[840.60 - 846.36] up on fire
[842.64 - 849.78] every day frustrations heats up the
[846.36 - 853.56] brain it's being human fine it's what
[849.78 - 856.74] it's like to be here on Earth human our
[853.56 - 858.30] brain heats up it lights up
[856.74 - 861.54] that's
[858.30 - 863.88] Perfectly Natural but we have to protect
[861.54 - 868.16] ourselves though along the way too and
[863.88 - 868.16] that's something humans don't get taught
[868.92 - 872.58] we're talking about everyday
[869.94 - 874.74] frustrations for example driving to work
[872.58 - 877.44] in traffic when you're late slowed down
[874.74 - 879.96] or stuck in lights causes the brain to
[877.44 - 882.12] heat up you start getting a heating of
[879.96 - 883.50] the brain as simple as that you're late
[882.12 - 885.72] for an appointment you're trying to get
[883.50 - 887.46] there and your brain heats up if you
[885.72 - 889.08] can't get there on time these are small
[887.46 - 891.36] little things but that's how much
[889.08 - 892.98] heating happens instead of rain having a
[891.36 - 896.10] difficult conversation can cause the
[892.98 - 898.74] brain to heat up oh yeah having a
[896.10 - 900.66] difficult conversation can cause the
[898.74 - 904.04] brain heat up that's why we have to give
[900.66 - 904.04] our brains what it needs
[904.92 - 908.22] if you are having trouble on social
[906.66 - 909.36] media watching these lives and you're
[908.22 - 911.28] getting kicked off and all kinds of
[909.36 - 913.44] other stuff go to medicalmedium.com I'm
[911.28 - 916.20] streaming live there right now we are
[913.44 - 917.76] live at medicalmedium.com and I saw some
[916.20 - 920.10] of you guys say how you love the medical
[917.76 - 921.96] medium.com website it's free everything
[920.10 - 923.70] on there everything's free on there by
[921.96 - 926.04] the way but I love what I'm seeing
[923.70 - 928.14] because you guys actually are noticing
[926.04 - 931.44] what we're doing to the website
[928.14 - 932.76] doing all kinds of great stuff
[931.44 - 934.50] so if you're having a difficult
[932.76 - 936.66] conversation it can cause the brain to
[934.50 - 938.34] heat up participating in a virtual
[936.66 - 940.14] meeting can cause the brain to heat up
[938.34 - 942.06] do you know that
[940.14 - 943.86] if you're doing a zoom or something else
[942.06 - 946.26] or any kind of virtual meeting that
[943.86 - 948.84] causes the brain to heat up as well
[946.26 - 951.12] it's incredible because video calls
[948.84 - 952.80] often involve an additional form of
[951.12 - 956.42] stress there's an additional form of
[952.80 - 956.42] stress when you're doing video calls
[956.52 - 960.48] that's incredible
[958.38 - 963.30] whether from spotty internet connections
[960.48 - 966.30] that cause delays participants talking
[963.30 - 968.04] over one another or because we tend to
[966.30 - 971.10] raise our voice increase facial
[968.04 - 973.86] expressions or emphasize body language
[971.10 - 975.66] when we feel the format isn't allowing
[973.86 - 978.30] us to project our message it's just
[975.66 - 980.88] meetings just family meetings with
[978.30 - 981.90] family virtually can also heat up the
[980.88 - 985.08] brain I don't know if that's ever
[981.90 - 986.94] happened to you guys the brain heat of
[985.08 - 988.68] life's challenges is harder on the
[986.94 - 990.30] chronically ill because they're often
[988.68 - 992.88] stuck in bed and that's another thing if
[990.30 - 995.10] you are on mattress island or if you had
[992.88 - 998.52] a sickness or an illness or any kind of
[995.10 - 1002.38] symptoms or conditions brain heat tends
[998.52 - 1002.38] to get hotter
[1004.04 - 1007.46] I mean who knows this stuff I mean when
[1006.26 - 1009.02] I was getting this information from
[1007.46 - 1011.06] Spirit of compassion it's just it's all
[1009.02 - 1012.50] like who no one talks about this
[1011.06 - 1015.26] anywhere
[1012.50 - 1017.24] so uh people asking about seizures and
[1015.26 - 1021.46] other conditions there are true answers
[1017.24 - 1021.46] in these books the brain protocol book
[1021.68 - 1026.68] you gotta have both critical to have
[1023.90 - 1026.68] both books
[1029.24 - 1033.38] so let's keep on going a little bit so
[1031.22 - 1034.70] the brain heat of life's challenges is
[1033.38 - 1036.14] harder on The Chronic Leo because
[1034.70 - 1038.06] they're stuck in bed they're too
[1036.14 - 1040.10] fatigued to walk it off or go exercise
[1038.06 - 1041.78] and that's another thing too
[1040.10 - 1043.10] what happens is when you're stuck on
[1041.78 - 1044.90] mattress Islander you're dealing with
[1043.10 - 1047.72] any kind of chronic illness or you feel
[1044.90 - 1050.42] compromised because of a symptom
[1047.72 - 1053.06] it's not easy to just walk off any
[1050.42 - 1056.30] frustration
[1053.06 - 1058.64] that makes it so hard on people
[1056.30 - 1060.50] that's why I wanted to make sure that in
[1058.64 - 1062.66] these books there's over 300 symptoms
[1060.50 - 1064.40] conditions and protocols I want people
[1062.66 - 1068.66] better faster and the brain shot
[1064.40 - 1070.64] therapies are just miraculous
[1068.66 - 1072.50] all of it is
[1070.64 - 1074.78] so when you're too fatigued to walk it
[1072.50 - 1077.24] off go exercise or distract yourself or
[1074.78 - 1079.22] shake it off a lot of people
[1077.24 - 1081.02] have a problem where they're like oh my
[1079.22 - 1083.90] God I'm like I'm stuck in bed I don't
[1081.02 - 1085.46] feel good a lot going on it's hard to
[1083.90 - 1088.10] just walk this stuff off so the
[1085.46 - 1089.60] frustration can grow
[1088.10 - 1091.70] you won't know unless you're in
[1089.60 - 1093.74] somebody's shoes that has struggled or
[1091.70 - 1095.48] you know suffered or been through a lot
[1093.74 - 1097.46] you won't know until you're in their
[1095.48 - 1100.46] shoes that's another thing too
[1097.46 - 1101.78] a lot of people run from their stress do
[1100.46 - 1103.82] you ever see that out there they run
[1101.78 - 1106.22] from their stress they burn off the
[1103.82 - 1108.74] adrenaline also called epinephrine
[1106.22 - 1110.54] created by a mild Stress and Anxiety by
[1108.74 - 1112.64] keeping busy with the activities they
[1110.54 - 1114.32] like wearing themselves out so that the
[1112.64 - 1116.32] thoughts don't keep cycling a lot of
[1114.32 - 1119.06] people run a lot of people
[1116.32 - 1121.46] they're lucky in the moment
[1119.06 - 1123.56] we're fortunate in the moment to not
[1121.46 - 1125.60] have symptoms or conditions drag them
[1123.56 - 1127.58] all the way down yet
[1125.60 - 1130.76] they may be young they may be strong so
[1127.58 - 1133.16] what they do is they keep moving
[1130.76 - 1135.62] that's what they do
[1133.16 - 1137.72] self-care appointments exercising
[1135.62 - 1138.56] running around hitting coffee shops
[1137.72 - 1139.88] right
[1138.56 - 1141.68] staying out late with friends whatever
[1139.88 - 1143.36] it is you just keep moving and you keep
[1141.68 - 1145.76] running from the stress that's how you
[1143.36 - 1147.98] do it right you're young
[1145.76 - 1149.78] but then if you get really sick and all
[1147.98 - 1152.06] of a sudden you're like whoa now it's
[1149.78 - 1153.68] just a doctor's appointments now I got
[1152.06 - 1155.18] to spend a lot of time at home now I got
[1153.68 - 1156.86] to spend a lot of time on the couch I
[1155.18 - 1158.54] don't really feel good I can't really go
[1156.86 - 1162.46] everywhere I want to go that's a whole
[1158.54 - 1162.46] nother game and then that heat rises
[1166.34 - 1170.78] people who are chronically ill don't
[1168.26 - 1173.54] have that luxury or option when you're
[1170.78 - 1176.00] stuck on the mattress Island
[1173.54 - 1178.04] you you can get caught up in your
[1176.00 - 1179.24] headspace with the brain fire burning
[1178.04 - 1180.68] hotter and I want to tell everybody
[1179.24 - 1182.96] who's stuck on mattress Island who's
[1180.68 - 1184.82] been sick who's you know got some kind
[1182.96 - 1187.52] of chronic symptom who's struggling all
[1184.82 - 1190.40] of it I want to tell you guys
[1187.52 - 1191.42] that I understand and that you know it's
[1190.40 - 1193.76] okay
[1191.42 - 1195.74] because we can do things about it
[1193.76 - 1197.12] we can protect our brain while we're
[1195.74 - 1199.76] dealing with that while we're on
[1197.12 - 1201.86] mattress Island while we're like slowed
[1199.76 - 1204.10] down in our life in the moment before we
[1201.86 - 1204.10] heal
[1204.56 - 1208.16] so when you're stuck on mattress Island
[1206.18 - 1210.62] you can get caught up in your headspace
[1208.16 - 1212.18] and I see that happen because the people
[1210.62 - 1216.40] who aren't stuck on mattress Island
[1212.18 - 1216.40] they're able to run from their headspace
[1217.10 - 1220.88] they're able to run and just couldn't do
[1219.50 - 1222.38] this gonna go see this friend gonna go
[1220.88 - 1224.30] back gonna go here and if you're able to
[1222.38 - 1226.22] run from it constantly until they get
[1224.30 - 1228.88] sick and then doom boom they're stuck
[1226.22 - 1228.88] with it all right
[1229.88 - 1235.16] Lauren oh my God I just saw saw that
[1233.12 - 1237.86] incredible
[1235.16 - 1239.96] Lauren hashian's so incredible uh to see
[1237.86 - 1241.40] you here right here by the way it's an
[1239.96 - 1245.12] honor
[1241.40 - 1248.18] um to have you here dear friend of mine
[1245.12 - 1250.76] so that's what happens to people if you
[1248.18 - 1254.24] get too sick
[1250.76 - 1256.34] then you're stuck and then the Mind
[1254.24 - 1258.56] races
[1256.34 - 1260.48] all that comes out and you can't run
[1258.56 - 1263.12] from all that
[1260.48 - 1265.34] stress it's harder that's why it's
[1263.12 - 1267.02] critical to get healthy too and you can
[1265.34 - 1268.46] do that with this information even when
[1267.02 - 1270.02] you're stuck on mattress Island and you
[1268.46 - 1271.70] don't feel good it's about being
[1270.02 - 1274.76] empowered and having the information to
[1271.70 - 1275.96] heal brain heat can even burn on a
[1274.76 - 1278.24] different level
[1275.96 - 1280.76] with a different kind of heat
[1278.24 - 1282.26] when everything is good and happy so
[1280.76 - 1284.36] even when things are really happy and
[1282.26 - 1286.16] joyful and great we can burn a lot of
[1284.36 - 1289.88] brain heat that's why it's critical to
[1286.16 - 1291.56] get what we need inside our brain
[1289.88 - 1293.84] so what I love about the adrenal
[1291.56 - 1295.82] fight-or-flight stabilizer it's giving
[1293.84 - 1301.64] your brain
[1295.82 - 1301.64] this incredible instant fast infusion
[1301.82 - 1307.04] that ignites the brain
[1304.22 - 1311.06] in the right direction giving it the
[1307.04 - 1313.88] fuel it needs so so many of us
[1311.06 - 1315.32] we're just so stressed out we got a lot
[1313.88 - 1317.66] going on and we end up burning
[1315.32 - 1319.58] everything good up in the brain and we
[1317.66 - 1322.70] need to restore it we need to refuel it
[1319.58 - 1324.80] like I talked about the other day
[1322.70 - 1327.08] she conscious says I did two burnout
[1324.80 - 1330.98] stabilizer shots yesterday in mid
[1327.08 - 1333.20] sentence I stopped without trying it did
[1330.98 - 1337.64] not make a sentence blunder
[1333.20 - 1340.52] it was almost automated incredible
[1337.64 - 1342.92] the branch out therapies are miracles
[1340.52 - 1344.96] you will feel it they're changing lives
[1342.92 - 1347.78] it's nothing that's ever been released
[1344.96 - 1349.04] in this world of health and healing
[1347.78 - 1351.80] and I'm so glad you guys are
[1349.04 - 1355.52] experiencing that
[1351.80 - 1357.02] the brain heat of Happiness can also be
[1355.52 - 1360.56] exhausting
[1357.02 - 1362.78] so even it's like if you play hard
[1360.56 - 1366.02] or you have a lot of happiness you still
[1362.78 - 1367.82] have to refill the brain it's not just
[1366.02 - 1369.08] if you don't play hard and you're sick
[1367.82 - 1373.06] or you don't feel good and you got to
[1369.08 - 1373.06] refill the brain it's both sides
[1373.52 - 1378.44] boots McGee said Anthony I had your
[1375.56 - 1380.30] burnout shot today and I cannot describe
[1378.44 - 1382.04] it I'm starting to feel hope and
[1380.30 - 1384.08] brightness for the first time in a long
[1382.04 - 1385.52] time you are a true miracle and
[1384.08 - 1389.68] inspiration I'm honored you're here
[1385.52 - 1389.68] incredible I'm so happy to hear that
[1392.12 - 1396.50] person who's feeling pretty good in the
[1393.80 - 1399.26] moment doesn't get
[1396.50 - 1401.36] an immunity card when it comes to brain
[1399.26 - 1402.98] heat and burning up all of our reserves
[1401.36 - 1405.32] we still need the adrenal
[1402.98 - 1407.72] fight-or-flight stabilizer even when
[1405.32 - 1410.72] we're feeling great or when we're
[1407.72 - 1413.30] feeling sick the brain heat still occurs
[1410.72 - 1415.40] and burns up everything inside the brain
[1413.30 - 1417.74] that's good
[1415.40 - 1419.72] but we have to refill remember you guys
[1417.74 - 1421.94] I was telling you guys a swimming pool
[1419.72 - 1423.98] water's leaving a swimming pool and not
[1421.94 - 1425.42] enough Waters coming in so the level of
[1423.98 - 1427.70] the swimming pool is going down and
[1425.42 - 1429.32] dropping and dropping and as the water's
[1427.70 - 1431.12] going out you got water coming in but
[1429.32 - 1432.68] more water is going out less water is
[1431.12 - 1436.24] coming in and the swimming pool's
[1432.68 - 1436.24] dropping dropping dropping dropping
[1437.36 - 1441.56] the solution here isn't to stop yourself
[1439.46 - 1443.36] from having emotions we all have
[1441.56 - 1445.58] emotions we're all human and emotions
[1443.36 - 1448.72] are going to create that
[1445.58 - 1448.72] that brain Heat
[1448.82 - 1454.58] we don't have total control over that
[1451.70 - 1456.02] anyway we can make what feels to be a
[1454.58 - 1458.36] lot of progress emotionally with
[1456.02 - 1459.98] conquering demons we can move mountains
[1458.36 - 1462.14] in our emotional state
[1459.98 - 1465.26] and that does not mean we will stop
[1462.14 - 1467.96] having emotions life is not definitive
[1465.26 - 1471.38] mapped out journey we know that our life
[1467.96 - 1473.42] is not somebody else's life
[1471.38 - 1476.30] yet if we look at the lives of others
[1473.42 - 1478.46] they can seem to have a good run for it
[1476.30 - 1481.04] for a little while and we think they
[1478.46 - 1482.90] must have figured everything out they're
[1481.04 - 1485.30] showing their best life's moments in
[1482.90 - 1487.40] public behind the scenes though they're
[1485.30 - 1490.04] running into emotional quicksand more
[1487.40 - 1493.58] than we know and they need help too
[1490.04 - 1495.68] everybody needs the right stuff going
[1493.58 - 1497.78] back into the brain
[1495.68 - 1500.06] hope for healing says this adrenal
[1497.78 - 1502.58] stabilizer shot is magical helping me
[1500.06 - 1504.14] sleep again I hear that a lot it helps
[1502.58 - 1506.18] with sleep and I want to say this really
[1504.14 - 1507.56] quick you guys
[1506.18 - 1509.72] when you're doing the brain shot
[1507.56 - 1511.70] therapies keep in mind
[1509.72 - 1514.64] healing is happening on all kinds of
[1511.70 - 1516.86] different levels healing that doesn't
[1514.64 - 1518.60] necessarily always match up to what the
[1516.86 - 1520.40] shot says it's doing for because what
[1518.60 - 1522.80] it's doing is it's healing one thing
[1520.40 - 1524.42] other things start to heal because
[1522.80 - 1526.70] you're healing this one thing it's
[1524.42 - 1528.80] incredible what it could do
[1526.70 - 1530.36] Arena says since I've been I've been
[1528.80 - 1532.82] since
[1530.36 - 1534.80] I've been drinking those shots I sleep
[1532.82 - 1536.90] so well can't believe it
[1534.80 - 1539.60] I'm hearing that all the time
[1536.90 - 1541.64] their powerhouses of healing the brain
[1539.60 - 1543.14] so when you're doing the shots and you
[1541.64 - 1545.48] do them more often and you pick
[1543.14 - 1548.78] different ones or whichever one you like
[1545.48 - 1550.10] really you start to see that power that
[1548.78 - 1552.74] healing
[1550.10 - 1555.20] loving healing says anxiety is a beast
[1552.74 - 1557.60] this adrenal shot is a legit Game
[1555.20 - 1559.22] Changer this is one of my favorites but
[1557.60 - 1560.54] you know at the same time I say that and
[1559.22 - 1562.22] then all of a sudden there's another one
[1560.54 - 1564.98] that's one of my favorites to be honest
[1562.22 - 1568.04] all 30 of the brain shot therapies from
[1564.98 - 1570.08] Spirit of compassion are my favorites so
[1568.04 - 1574.00] it's a tough one but this one right here
[1570.08 - 1576.32] this one hits me right smack instantly
[1574.00 - 1578.84] and you know I heard you know a friend
[1576.32 - 1580.70] of mine took this shot this brain shot
[1578.84 - 1582.80] therapy the adrenal fight or flight

[1738.92 - 1743.24] incredible but why does it work it works
[1741.08 - 1745.76] because of the synergistic combinations

[1748.22 - 1751.76] what it's saying it does like adrenal

[1855.52 - 1861.20] but you got to get air in there
[1858.80 - 1862.46] by the end of it
[1861.20 - 1864.14] all right
[1862.46 - 1865.64] talking about brain heat we're talking
[1864.14 - 1867.26] about the adrenal finer flight
[1865.64 - 1870.62] stabilizer
[1867.26 - 1872.00] we're doing it this is incredible
[1870.62 - 1875.18] so
[1872.00 - 1876.92] all right we could get worn down
[1875.18 - 1879.38] by the little ups and downs and
[1876.92 - 1881.42] challenges thrown out our way
[1879.38 - 1883.46] we can get worn down by the larger
[1881.42 - 1885.68] challenges that come our way
[1883.46 - 1890.12] whatever life brings
[1885.68 - 1892.58] we can heal the brain critical to know
[1890.12 - 1896.12] our brains can burn hot
[1892.58 - 1898.10] but we can cool them down by feeding our
[1896.12 - 1900.26] brains what it needs think about that
[1898.10 - 1902.72] how incredible it is
[1900.26 - 1905.00] being prepared ahead of time is the
[1902.72 - 1906.86] ultimate defense and protection for our
[1905.00 - 1908.66] brain and that's what we're doing we're
[1906.86 - 1911.24] preparing ourselves with this knowledge
[1908.66 - 1913.34] and information so
[1911.24 - 1915.68] if I know I can do an adrenal
[1913.34 - 1918.98] fight-or-flight stabilizer
[1915.68 - 1922.64] and I can do that one before I go into
[1918.98 - 1924.32] the fire the Heat of the Moment
[1922.64 - 1926.06] like I got a big day ahead of me on
[1924.32 - 1928.58] meetings I got people I got to talk to
[1926.06 - 1930.80] you never know what's gonna happen
[1928.58 - 1933.56] you want it all to work out
[1930.80 - 1935.90] you want everything to be smooth
[1933.56 - 1937.52] but life doesn't really work that way we
[1935.90 - 1940.28] don't have control over everything
[1937.52 - 1943.16] everybody's got their own free will
[1940.28 - 1944.72] just like you have your own free will so
[1943.16 - 1947.00] life is always going to just throw
[1944.72 - 1950.24] something at you somewhere along the way
[1947.00 - 1951.98] but if you can be prepared
[1950.24 - 1954.74] and do you like a fight or flight
[1951.98 - 1956.66] stabilizer that morning before you go
[1954.74 - 1959.42] off
[1956.66 - 1960.74] or you can be prepared by having the
[1959.42 - 1963.98] ingredients of the fight-or-flight
[1960.74 - 1965.66] stabilizer at home in your refrigerator
[1963.98 - 1966.92] so that when you're having your day and
[1965.66 - 1971.44] you come home and you're like you know
[1966.92 - 1971.44] what I need a fight or flight stabilizer
[1971.54 - 1974.84] maybe you're on the phone with the phone
[1972.98 - 1977.12] company maybe you're on the phone with
[1974.84 - 1979.28] some other you know company and they got
[1977.12 - 1981.14] you on hold for an hour and you're
[1979.28 - 1982.40] trying to fix something and you're like
[1981.14 - 1984.62] you know what I need that fight or
[1982.40 - 1986.48] flight stabilizer maybe you're going to
[1984.62 - 1989.06] be an old friend maybe you got to meet
[1986.48 - 1990.44] family maybe somebody's in a really bad
[1989.06 - 1992.78] mood that you're spending time with
[1990.44 - 1994.58] whatever it is that fight or flight
[1992.78 - 1999.56] stabilizer is so powerful because the
[1994.58 - 2002.56] brain heat rises but we can be prepared
[1999.56 - 2004.42] cut it off at the pass we can have our
[2002.56 - 2006.52] stuff in hand
[2004.42 - 2008.02] but one thing I'll tell you right now is
[2006.52 - 2009.64] the instant relief that these
[2008.02 - 2012.52] stabilizers bring
[2009.64 - 2015.70] is like a true Miracle so you'll feel it
[2012.52 - 2017.92] I feel it on the first sip with the
[2015.70 - 2021.00] adrenal fight or flight stabilizer
[2017.92 - 2021.00] really incredible
[2023.32 - 2029.02] little did we know these steps
[2026.08 - 2031.54] might not have been appropriate
[2029.02 - 2033.76] in our life where we take these steps in
[2031.54 - 2036.58] life but we didn't know we were going to
[2033.76 - 2037.84] have a pitfall but we can pick ourselves
[2036.58 - 2041.08] back up
[2037.84 - 2043.12] and we could not only Rectify what went
[2041.08 - 2044.80] wrong inside our bodies because of any
[2043.12 - 2046.06] kind of stress but we can move ourselves
[2044.80 - 2047.44] forward and that's another thing with
[2046.06 - 2049.54] the brain shot therapies the adrenal
[2047.44 - 2051.76] fight-or-flight stabilizer starts to
[2049.54 - 2054.40] build you up so that when you get
[2051.76 - 2057.22] another Pitfall you have a stressful
[2054.40 - 2059.08] situation you have a hard day you're
[2057.22 - 2061.42] already ahead
[2059.08 - 2063.28] you do the fight-or-flight stabilizer I
[2061.42 - 2065.44] have a doctor friend of mine now dude
[2063.28 - 2067.90] the fight-or-flight stabilizer it's been
[2065.44 - 2069.64] doing it for like two weeks now every
[2067.90 - 2071.26] day for two weeks the fight-or-flight
[2069.64 - 2073.72] stabilizer
[2071.26 - 2075.88] and now what's happening
[2073.72 - 2077.74] is like any kind of bad news this
[2075.88 - 2079.84] doctor's getting or any kind of stress
[2077.74 - 2081.94] from any kind of family situation or any
[2079.84 - 2085.06] kind of stress what's happening in his
[2081.94 - 2086.62] life he's like it's not even phasing him
[2085.06 - 2088.60] he's doing the adrenal fight or flight
[2086.62 - 2091.42] stabilizer every day for two weeks he
[2088.60 - 2093.40] says it's almost like he's ahead of it
[2091.42 - 2095.20] and he can just shake it off like it's
[2093.40 - 2097.30] no big deal and keep on moving forward
[2095.20 - 2099.46] and that's the whole point we can
[2097.30 - 2101.74] actually prepare ourselves we can make
[2099.46 - 2104.74] ourselves stronger so that when we're
[2101.74 - 2107.50] going up against something that is
[2104.74 - 2109.00] really the way to do it or you can just
[2107.50 - 2111.58] like I'm gonna get it out now because
[2109.00 - 2114.58] I'm having a day or I don't feel good
[2111.58 - 2117.34] I'm not doing that great I feel a little
[2114.58 - 2119.32] tired my energy is low I think my
[2117.34 - 2121.18] adrenals are having a problem then boom
[2119.32 - 2123.10] these Torino fight or flight stabilizer
[2121.18 - 2125.44] really incredible
[2123.10 - 2127.06] so let's talk about these medical being
[2125.44 - 2128.20] braid shot therapy so I want to give you
[2127.06 - 2129.76] guys a little rundown especially if
[2128.20 - 2131.80] anybody's new right here
[2129.76 - 2134.56] medical media brain shot therapy offers
[2131.80 - 2138.04] instant relief
[2134.56 - 2139.72] so it helps to rewire and reset the
[2138.04 - 2142.36] brain
[2139.72 - 2145.06] so the brain shot therapies rewire the
[2142.36 - 2148.18] brain and actually help to reset the
[2145.06 - 2151.38] brain is what they do but they do it
[2148.18 - 2154.06] quickly because they absorb in the mouth
[2151.38 - 2156.72] instantaneously and it drives right up
[2154.06 - 2156.72] to the brain
[2158.26 - 2163.54] so the whole point of the brain shot
[2160.84 - 2168.76] therapy from Spirit of compassion
[2163.54 - 2171.10] was to offer powerful quick relief a
[2168.76 - 2173.80] quick hit
[2171.10 - 2175.66] strengthening the brain so when you're
[2173.80 - 2178.18] dealing with the obsessive thoughts
[2175.66 - 2181.72] problem you do the obsessive thought
[2178.18 - 2184.42] shifter and it's there to reset the
[2181.72 - 2185.92] brain and rewire the brain quickly
[2184.42 - 2187.30] when you're dealing with any kind of
[2185.92 - 2189.34] stress you're dealing with the adrenal
[2187.30 - 2190.60] fighter flight stabilizer it's there to
[2189.34 - 2193.60] reset
[2190.60 - 2195.04] the brain quickly
[2193.60 - 2197.20] when you're dealing with negative
[2195.04 - 2199.54] exposure that you think you're dealing
[2197.20 - 2201.28] with resetting the brain putting a
[2199.54 - 2204.10] shield around you and moving negative
[2201.28 - 2206.20] energy out or away quickly
[2204.10 - 2207.46] it has to happen quickly you know one of
[2206.20 - 2209.56] the things that
[2207.46 - 2212.74] you can but quickly means for anybody
[2209.56 - 2215.08] could be the next morning
[2212.74 - 2216.34] it could be that second you're taking it
[2215.08 - 2218.08] down
[2216.34 - 2219.76] and usually you'll feel it no matter
[2218.08 - 2221.38] what you'll feel something when you're
[2219.76 - 2223.00] taking down the shot because they're
[2221.38 - 2225.64] doing something
[2223.00 - 2228.28] miraculous in the moment but you can
[2225.64 - 2231.22] feel the results Days Later Weeks Later
[2228.28 - 2233.68] they're really potent
[2231.22 - 2235.60] I remember being in my office
[2233.68 - 2237.10] getting the information from Spirit of
[2235.60 - 2240.00] compassion writing it down about the
[2237.10 - 2240.00] brain shot Therapies
[2242.02 - 2245.26] and
[2243.22 - 2247.36] say well what do I do
[2245.26 - 2249.22] how do I forewarn people about this
[2247.36 - 2252.04] because in the Alternative Health world
[2249.22 - 2255.16] you don't get things
[2252.04 - 2257.08] at the snap of your fingers
[2255.16 - 2259.00] an alternative health and healing world
[2257.08 - 2261.52] it's just not a lot of options people
[2259.00 - 2263.44] don't heal chronic illness easy out
[2261.52 - 2265.30] there at all medical medium books have
[2263.44 - 2266.92] fast-tracked people
[2265.30 - 2268.36] in the last eight years with all the
[2266.92 - 2269.98] medical medium books people have fast
[2268.36 - 2272.14] tracked and their healing diseases
[2269.98 - 2275.56] conditions symptoms faster than anything
[2272.14 - 2277.72] but what do I tell people I said to SOC
[2275.56 - 2279.46] about these brain shot therapies because
[2277.72 - 2282.16] I have to forewarn them they have to
[2279.46 - 2284.32] know that just like it says in the book
[2282.16 - 2287.34] they have to know it comes quick I don't
[2284.32 - 2287.34] want them caught off guard
[2287.38 - 2292.78] so systematically these combinations of
[2290.62 - 2294.94] ingredients work together to help heal
[2292.78 - 2297.76] the problem you're dealing with in even
[2294.94 - 2300.58] more than that deeper issues too along
[2297.76 - 2302.98] with it so the power of these brain shot
[2300.58 - 2304.24] therapies is just absolutely incredible
[2302.98 - 2305.80] so let's talk about what are we even
[2304.24 - 2308.08] doing you guys we're doing the entry
[2305.80 - 2309.82] level if you just got here we're doing
[2308.08 - 2312.28] the entry level brain shot therapy
[2309.82 - 2314.38] cleanse we're on day seven of a 10 day
[2312.28 - 2315.10] brain shot therapy challenge cleanse
[2314.38 - 2317.50] right
[2315.10 - 2320.14] so we're in the entry level that means
[2317.50 - 2322.12] whatever diet you're doing whatever
[2320.14 - 2324.82] Foods you're doing you can just continue
[2322.12 - 2328.60] to continue to do
[2324.82 - 2330.58] so whatever diet you subscribe to or if
[2328.60 - 2332.68] you're doing medical medium stuff if
[2330.58 - 2334.12] you're doing medical medium tools
[2332.68 - 2336.46] whatever's happening and how you're
[2334.12 - 2339.52] eating you can still keep that and still
[2336.46 - 2341.08] do these brain shot Therapies
[2339.52 - 2342.52] what's amazing about these Branch out
[2341.08 - 2345.46] therapies they're giving you relief
[2342.52 - 2348.16] while you bring in other medical medium
[2345.46 - 2351.34] tools too because you're fixing other
[2348.16 - 2354.52] issues deep inside your body long term
[2351.34 - 2356.44] so I like having them both
[2354.52 - 2359.46] the entry-level brain shot therapy
[2356.44 - 2362.20] cleanse you drink 50 ounces of water
[2359.46 - 2364.12] throughout the day as your minimum 50
[2362.20 - 2365.62] ounces of water but don't drink the 50
[2364.12 - 2367.84] ounces right when you had your shot
[2365.62 - 2369.94] don't send down your shot just had my
[2367.84 - 2372.70] shot let me do 50 ounces of water now
[2369.94 - 2376.48] don't do that
[2372.70 - 2379.78] so when you have your brain shot therapy
[2376.48 - 2381.34] make sure you wait like 10 minimum 15
[2379.78 - 2384.58] minutes really but 10 minutes is
[2381.34 - 2387.64] probably the best the closest we can get
[2384.58 - 2389.38] but you want like 15 minutes before you
[2387.64 - 2391.24] start drinking or eating other things
[2389.38 - 2393.36] you want that to get into your
[2391.24 - 2396.94] bloodstream and get to your brain before
[2393.36 - 2399.16] you Sidetrack it with other food and
[2396.94 - 2400.60] things
[2399.16 - 2402.94] so when you do the adrenal
[2400.60 - 2404.80] fight-or-flight stabilizer make sure you
[2402.94 - 2406.78] when you send it down you wait 15
[2404.80 - 2408.70] minutes there's
[2406.78 - 2410.92] children guidance in the brain saver
[2408.70 - 2412.84] books two
[2410.92 - 2414.58] and there's breastfeeding questions if
[2412.84 - 2416.08] you're okay with taking the brain shot
[2414.58 - 2417.82] therapies ask your doctor what's right
[2416.08 - 2420.34] for you take the books to your doctors
[2417.82 - 2424.08] if you want but it's fine to do brain
[2420.34 - 2424.08] shot therapies while breastfeeding
[2424.78 - 2429.28] so the entry level cleanse is what we're
[2426.82 - 2431.80] doing and we're in 10 word seven of ten
[2429.28 - 2435.34] days of it right now
[2431.80 - 2437.32] and you can do one to three shots so I'm
[2435.34 - 2438.94] doing three shots a day so today's the
[2437.32 - 2441.04] adrenal fight or flight stabilizer so
[2438.94 - 2443.50] this is the first shot
[2441.04 - 2445.54] I'm gonna do a second one later and the
[2443.50 - 2447.34] third one tonight
[2445.54 - 2449.44] so that's how I'm doing it you can do it
[2447.34 - 2452.44] the way you want to do you can do one
[2449.44 - 2453.40] shot a day each day you can do two or
[2452.44 - 2455.32] three
[2453.40 - 2456.52] and you could do the same shot now if
[2455.32 - 2459.82] you want to do
[2456.52 - 2461.80] your own thing you're in the 10 day
[2459.82 - 2463.72] brain shot therapy cleanse Challenge and
[2461.80 - 2465.40] you want to do different shots then then

[2465.40 - 2469.78] shots that you see there's over 30 brain
[2467.26 - 2472.00] shot therapy therapies here and you can
[2469.78 - 2474.64] choose anyone you want and you can do
[2472.00 - 2476.56] them every day and do whatever you want
[2474.64 - 2478.66] to do you can be you and do that it's
[2476.56 - 2481.30] totally fine it's amazing
[2478.66 - 2483.10] amethyst says 15 to 30 minutes away from
[2481.30 - 2484.66] food yes when you're doing the brain
[2483.10 - 2488.32] shot therapy
[2484.66 - 2490.42] Darcy Lee said I just did three at once
[2488.32 - 2492.04] it's actually really funny
[2490.42 - 2495.10] day seven adrenal fighter flight
[2492.04 - 2496.90] stabilizer let's get into it
[2495.10 - 2500.08] incredible you guys
[2496.90 - 2502.00] all right so the ingredients are pretty
[2500.08 - 2504.28] straightforward you'll see in there but
[2502.00 - 2505.78] you want to keep them in order
[2504.28 - 2509.32] so what you'll see over here I got
[2505.78 - 2511.48] lemons I got garlic
[2509.32 - 2513.88] so the first thing I need is a clove of
[2511.48 - 2515.92] garlic now it says small clove of garlic
[2513.88 - 2517.60] so you don't want a really large one you
[2515.92 - 2518.98] know how there's elephant garlic you
[2517.60 - 2520.78] guys
[2518.98 - 2523.06] you don't want to get the big old
[2520.78 - 2526.00] elephant garlic and have like one big
[2523.06 - 2529.36] gigantic clove and you also don't want
[2526.00 - 2533.08] the largest clove in the bunch
[2529.36 - 2536.56] you want to go with like a medium clove
[2533.08 - 2538.60] a small clove right so that's the clove
[2536.56 - 2540.94] of garlic right there just getting my
[2538.60 - 2543.64] ingredients ready before they run I run
[2540.94 - 2545.68] them through the juicer
[2543.64 - 2547.60] so that's one thing right there the
[2545.68 - 2550.18] other thing is I don't have any Frozen
[2547.60 - 2552.46] wild blueberries right now so I got the
[2550.18 - 2554.80] Wyman's wild blueberry juice you guys
[2552.46 - 2557.98] know it well right which is an
[2554.80 - 2560.32] incredible tool all on its own which is
[2557.98 - 2561.52] amazing and you guys know I work with
[2560.32 - 2563.32] Wyman's
[2561.52 - 2566.14] to try to keep the stuff out there
[2563.32 - 2568.12] because it is incredible anyway what I'm
[2566.14 - 2570.88] going to do is I'm going to pour some of
[2568.12 - 2573.16] the wild blueberry juice into
[2570.88 - 2574.66] the container after I juice the
[2573.16 - 2576.58] ingredients so I'm not going to use the
[2574.66 - 2579.34] Frozen wild blueberry because I don't
[2576.58 - 2581.38] have any in stock in the house right now
[2579.34 - 2583.24] but and they got a sale going on right
[2581.38 - 2585.46] now they've had a sale going on check it
[2583.24 - 2587.56] out when you when you see so go to
[2585.46 - 2589.78] Wyman's but anyway that's what I'm using
[2587.56 - 2592.54] I got that ready
[2589.78 - 2598.32] what else do we need here
[2592.54 - 2598.32] I have lemon so let's get that prepared
[2598.42 - 2604.18] so it says in the book
[2601.60 - 2608.58] peel your lemon right a peeled lemon so
[2604.18 - 2608.58] don't juice the lemon rind
[2608.80 - 2611.74] so I'm doing a half a peeled lemon in
[2611.02 - 2615.34] here
[2611.74 - 2617.56] so I'm peeling The Lemon Back
[2615.34 - 2619.72] right and you can use a peeler I'm just
[2617.56 - 2623.10] using a knife
[2619.72 - 2623.10] little paring knife right
[2624.12 - 2630.66] now if you have a really large Lemon
[2628.84 - 2634.12] like
[2630.66 - 2637.18] big old Myers lemon that's going to give
[2634.12 - 2638.98] you a lot of juice just preparing you so
[2637.18 - 2642.40] try to use a quarter of that big old
[2638.98 - 2644.32] lemon this is kind of like you know a
[2642.40 - 2647.10] smaller lemon I'm gonna use a half of
[2644.32 - 2647.10] this smaller lemon
[2647.20 - 2652.66] so it says it says Ginger first
[2650.62 - 2653.98] is that what it says okay here's a
[2652.66 - 2658.18] question here
[2653.98 - 2661.30] what juicer is best so the best juicer
[2658.18 - 2663.90] that I have endorsed is the mm-1500
[2661.30 - 2663.90] right here
[2664.06 - 2667.50] now I know the sharks are getting upset
[2666.04 - 2670.30] at me
[2667.50 - 2672.34] because I haven't been talking about the
[2670.30 - 2673.66] MN 1500 or 900 in a while because I've
[2672.34 - 2674.86] been so busy writing the books getting
[2673.66 - 2677.14] the books published making sure
[2674.86 - 2678.58] everything was all set but this is the
[2677.14 - 2679.78] best juicer I know the sharks have
[2678.58 - 2681.04] swooped into the medical medium
[2679.78 - 2682.12] community and they're pushing their
[2681.04 - 2685.06] juicers
[2682.12 - 2688.06] but this one squeezes the heck out of
[2685.06 - 2690.28] the produce and then you have more juice
[2688.06 - 2693.58] when you have more juice
[2690.28 - 2696.34] you save money and that's why I love
[2693.58 - 2699.04] these only the mm 1500 and 900 can do
[2696.34 - 2700.48] that has that high compression but
[2699.04 - 2702.04] here's the incredible thing and I see
[2700.48 - 2703.84] people are getting upset because they
[2702.04 - 2706.54] see me defending
[2703.84 - 2708.52] the mm1500
[2706.54 - 2710.98] so what you have to know that this not
[2708.52 - 2713.44] only juices and saves you money on that
[2710.98 - 2715.78] it makes nut Butters nut milks and the
[2713.44 - 2718.54] other juicers don't mix nut Butters nut
[2715.78 - 2721.48] milks Salsas hummus
[2718.54 - 2724.30] all of that
[2721.48 - 2724.96] so that's something to be really you
[2724.30 - 2727.26] know
[2724.96 - 2730.90] aware of because it's incredible so
[2727.26 - 2732.76] there's that but the point is is that by
[2730.90 - 2735.46] far when you're saving money with your
[2732.76 - 2736.96] produce and you're spending less money
[2735.46 - 2740.26] on your produce
[2736.96 - 2742.48] that's what the mm 900 and 1500 do
[2740.26 - 2744.28] no other juicers do that in my opinion
[2742.48 - 2746.08] I've tried them all they don't do it
[2744.28 - 2748.54] these are designed to actually squeeze
[2746.08 - 2751.96] more juice out so that means you're
[2748.54 - 2754.54] saving all this money and adds up my
[2751.96 - 2758.68] mm-900 paid for itself a dozen times
[2754.54 - 2760.84] which juicers can't do and the MN 1500
[2758.68 - 2762.04] is paying for itself all the time too so
[2760.84 - 2764.02] I'm just letting you know since you guys
[2762.04 - 2765.64] are asking the question now I know the
[2764.02 - 2769.42] other juicer companies are telling all
[2765.64 - 2771.88] their MLM people to fight back
[2769.42 - 2774.64] and say oh no our squeezes all the juice
[2771.88 - 2776.08] out too no it doesn't or they'll be like
[2774.64 - 2778.36] whatever because they're all freaking
[2776.08 - 2780.82] out because they had like the Sharks
[2778.36 - 2783.46] came in when I was like asleep but I
[2780.82 - 2785.44] wasn't asleep I was working my ass off
[2783.46 - 2788.56] anyway guys I got the ginger for the
[2785.44 - 2791.56] fight-or-flight stabilizer here
[2788.56 - 2794.38] that's going to go first
[2791.56 - 2797.56] and then
[2794.38 - 2800.02] let's cut this lemon in half we got the
[2797.56 - 2801.52] half lemon right there
[2800.02 - 2805.32] so I'm just getting these all ready we
[2801.52 - 2805.32] got the garlic we got the ginger
[2807.10 - 2811.66] we got the lemon
[2809.80 - 2815.20] so let's keep on going all right the
[2811.66 - 2818.32] next thing we need is the parsley
[2815.20 - 2821.86] so we need a cup of tightly packed
[2818.32 - 2824.08] parsley so what I like to do I have like
[2821.86 - 2825.34] little measuring way I do with my hand
[2824.08 - 2828.40] because I've done it so many times
[2825.34 - 2830.20] versus cups and all that so I get a cup
[2828.40 - 2832.30] of parsley here
[2830.20 - 2834.10] tightly packed
[2832.30 - 2837.60] so I'm all set that's going to be my
[2834.10 - 2841.30] parsley excited getting everything ready
[2837.60 - 2843.46] so the next is kale a half cup of
[2841.30 - 2845.32] tightly packed kale so I'm just gonna
[2843.46 - 2848.34] roll this kale up a little bit tightly
[2845.32 - 2848.34] pack it up in my hand
[2848.92 - 2854.08] so get a half cup in here
[2852.16 - 2855.94] so now some of this stuff is a little
[2854.08 - 2858.90] juicy so you're going to get probably a
[2855.94 - 2858.90] little bit more in your shot
[2860.08 - 2864.10] all right
[2861.94 - 2866.26] and then we got the watermelon rind so
[2864.10 - 2869.44] let's get that going
[2866.26 - 2872.46] one cup of chopped watermelon rind so I
[2869.44 - 2872.46] got my watermelon right there
[2873.70 - 2877.68] let's get up get a rind real quick
[2879.58 - 2885.72] don't need much to make a cup of brine
[2882.88 - 2885.72] nice
[2885.90 - 2891.64] I really love
[2889.12 - 2893.86] really love this stabilizer right here
[2891.64 - 2896.76] the adrenal fighter flight stabilizer
[2893.86 - 2896.76] just love it
[2897.46 - 2902.38] gonna send these pieces down as well all
[2901.06 - 2904.36] right
[2902.38 - 2907.62] we got our ingredients
[2904.36 - 2907.62] let's start making some
[2909.34 - 2912.54] move the brain
[2912.58 - 2917.08] let's go you guys you guys got your
[2914.62 - 2918.88] juicers ready you got your ingredients
[2917.08 - 2921.22] ready
[2918.88 - 2922.64] let's fire it up
[2921.22 - 2924.10] let's go
[2922.64 - 2925.42] [Music]
[2924.10 - 2927.16] now I don't have the Frozen wall
[2925.42 - 2931.44] blueberries like I said so I'm gonna add
[2927.16 - 2931.44] the wild blueberry juice in the end
[2932.02 - 2935.88] so I'm going to start out with my Ginger
[2937.24 - 2942.10] now look if your order isn't perfect
[2939.52 - 2944.56] because you missed one first or a second
[2942.10 - 2948.76] it's okay but you want to get it in
[2944.56 - 2951.04] order the best you can it does help
[2948.76 - 2954.22] that's what I've been told
[2951.04 - 2958.44] my SOC all right
[2954.22 - 2958.44] first thing in getting the ginger
[2959.86 - 2962.92] okay
[2960.82 - 2963.65] second thing in gonna get the clove of
[2962.92 - 2966.64] garlic
[2963.65 - 2968.86] [Music]
[2966.64 - 2970.84] that's in there right there
[2968.86 - 2973.24] third thing
[2970.84 - 2974.80] it says put the blueberries in but I'm
[2973.24 - 2976.54] gonna pour it in after and you can just
[2974.80 - 2978.76] pour it in
[2976.54 - 2980.44] right from here too if you're dealing
[2978.76 - 2983.64] with the juice so I'm gonna pop in a
[2980.44 - 2983.64] little bit of the juice right here
[2984.28 - 2989.22] it says two teaspoons will go with a
[2986.20 - 2989.22] little bit of juice right there
[2993.16 - 2997.26] all right half peeled lemon
[3000.48 - 3006.68] get that down there
[3002.94 - 3006.68] next we're going with the parsley
[3008.18 - 3011.48] here we go
[3014.28 - 3017.48] I'm actually really excited
[3018.18 - 3023.64] you know there's a feeling you get
[3020.94 - 3025.62] when you know you're doing something so
[3023.64 - 3028.20] incredible for your brain
[3025.62 - 3030.36] because you're using your free will and
[3028.20 - 3031.86] your intentions you're using your brain
[3030.36 - 3033.48] to heal your brain you have to remember
[3031.86 - 3036.50] that and how incredible that is we're
[3033.48 - 3036.50] going to do some kale next
[3036.84 - 3042.30] you're using
[3039.24 - 3044.76] your brain to heal your brain
[3042.30 - 3046.86] that's empowerment but people don't do
[3044.76 - 3048.90] that and if they try to do it they get
[3046.86 - 3050.70] the wrong information which doesn't help
[3048.90 - 3053.28] if your brain is using the wrong
[3050.70 - 3055.50] information to heal your brain it's not
[3053.28 - 3056.94] going to help but when you use your
[3055.50 - 3059.70] brain to heal your brain and it's the
[3056.94 - 3062.22] information that actually works
[3059.70 - 3063.90] that's when everything changes
[3062.22 - 3066.26] so we're gonna do some watermelon rind
[3063.90 - 3066.26] in here
[3069.54 - 3073.10] do you guys find any watermelon
[3074.90 - 3079.80] a little bit more in here
[3077.34 - 3081.54] and what you'll notice with the mm1500

[3081.54 - 3085.52] pulp comes out like dust
[3085.86 - 3088.64] so dry
[3089.76 - 3094.22] incredible
[3091.10 - 3094.22] all right
[3095.70 - 3102.06] I'm excited and that's the thing that's
[3098.40 - 3104.82] real dry pole big difference
[3102.06 - 3106.86] all right you guys

[3115.44 - 3119.30] [Music]
[3119.38 - 3123.84] [Applause]
[3121.46 - 3126.84] when you use your brain to heal your
[3123.84 - 3128.72] brain and you use your soul to feel your
[3126.84 - 3131.37] brain and you're using your free will
[3128.72 - 3134.52] you're using your intentions
[3131.37 - 3134.52] [Applause]
[3137.22 - 3143.30] here we go
[3139.50 - 3143.30] something special happens inside
[3145.14 - 3151.04] you're breaking the rules because down
[3147.90 - 3151.04] here on Earth
[3151.32 - 3156.43] it's not easy to heal and it's kind of
[3153.96 - 3157.80] been set up like that so people struggle
[3156.43 - 3159.78] [Music]
[3157.80 - 3161.76] and they don't find their way
[3159.78 - 3163.32] so many sick people around the world but
[3161.76 - 3165.78] we can change that
[3163.32 - 3167.82] when we have tools that actually work
[3165.78 - 3169.82] and change our lives
[3167.82 - 3173.64] turn things around it is another
[3169.82 - 3176.42] entirely different story
[3173.64 - 3176.42] it's incredible
[3176.82 - 3185.51] that's the first step right there
[3178.18 - 3185.51] [Music]
[3185.70 - 3188.90] Second Step it's hitting
[3188.94 - 3191.94] incredible

[3216.72 - 3219.80] incredible you guys
[3222.24 - 3227.10] what I notice about the adrenal fight or
[3224.40 - 3229.56] flight stabilizer
[3227.10 - 3231.54] is it's hitting the brain but then my
[3229.56 - 3233.40] brain is sending messages and I'm being
[3231.54 - 3235.26] a little bit quiet when I'm drinking
[3233.40 - 3238.32] this one because I'm trying to feel the
[3235.26 - 3240.90] sensations and I feel my brain talking
[3238.32 - 3242.94] to my adrenals where my brain is
[3240.90 - 3244.56] actually connected to my adrenals that's
[3242.94 - 3245.64] what I'm getting right now and when I do
[3244.56 - 3247.62] this
[3245.64 - 3251.16] Anna says oh my God I love the taste
[3247.62 - 3253.38] incredible do you guys feel that I gave
[3251.16 - 3255.66] it a few seconds
[3253.38 - 3258.42] and I feel
[3255.66 - 3261.24] what's happening inside Carrie said she
[3258.42 - 3264.48] just ordered the 1500 amazing
[3261.24 - 3266.70] you guys I can feel my brain talking to
[3264.48 - 3268.38] my adrenals and making that connection
[3266.70 - 3270.24] through the central nervous system
[3268.38 - 3273.48] because your adrenals are directly
[3270.24 - 3275.58] connected wire to your vagus nerves
[3273.48 - 3278.04] incredible right there
[3275.58 - 3280.44] you guys have you tried the brain shots

[3310.50 - 3313.92] if you can that would be incredible
[3311.88 - 3316.02] wherever you got the books
[3313.92 - 3318.72] that would be amazing if you can leave
[3316.02 - 3321.36] reviews that would be just incredible
[3318.72 - 3324.24] because it it helps other people know
[3321.36 - 3327.60] what is in the books and what they can
[3324.24 - 3329.82] do to heal and that part all on its own
[3327.60 - 3331.92] is so special and remember if you get a
[3329.82 - 3334.98] book remember that
[3331.92 - 3337.92] all the books are pristine and they're
[3334.98 - 3339.60] clean and they go to the warehouses like
[3337.92 - 3341.58] Amazon and other places so when you
[3339.60 - 3344.04] order one and they throw it on the
[3341.58 - 3345.90] conveyor belt you might see some dirt or
[3344.04 - 3348.12] grease from their conveyor belt go on
[3345.90 - 3350.46] your book just get a little dish towel
[3348.12 - 3352.74] or a handy wipe or something put a
[3350.46 - 3355.02] little tiny soap on there a damp one
[3352.74 - 3357.24] cloth and you just clean off your book
[3355.02 - 3360.24] and it cleans off like brand new because
[3357.24 - 3362.40] they are brand new all of them and so
[3360.24 - 3364.38] you might get a book that's like that
[3362.40 - 3366.30] gets smudged because it goes on the
[3364.38 - 3369.12] conveyor belt and it goes on down right
[3366.30 - 3371.46] and that whole bit so when you order it
[3369.12 - 3374.40] just letting you know
[3371.46 - 3376.56] but that shot feels so good what it does
[3374.40 - 3379.44] is I could see why it's helping people
[3376.56 - 3381.42] sleep at night better because it's it's
[3379.44 - 3383.94] rejuvenating my brain
[3381.42 - 3386.10] but at the same time supporting my
[3383.94 - 3388.98] adrenals and calming me down but
[3386.10 - 3390.84] strengthening me so I can tell now that
[3388.98 - 3393.18] later on today I'm gonna have this extra
[3390.84 - 3394.98] burst of energy because everything is
[3393.18 - 3396.66] getting recharged my adrenals are
[3394.98 - 3400.80] getting recharged what I was doing is
[3396.66 - 3405.54] when I was sipping that Juice shot
[3400.80 - 3407.52] when I was sipping that brain stabilizer
[3405.54 - 3410.10] what I noticed was
[3407.52 - 3411.96] it was going to my brain but then my
[3410.10 - 3414.42] brain was sending a message to my
[3411.96 - 3417.48] adrenals and I was feeling that message
[3414.42 - 3419.58] get driven down my vagus nerves down my
[3417.48 - 3421.38] spine down my other nerves and just
[3419.58 - 3423.90] going down my phrenic nerves all of it
[3421.38 - 3425.88] and heading down to my adrenals and my
[3423.90 - 3428.22] adrenals were actually getting that
[3425.88 - 3430.74] information I could feel that they were
[3428.22 - 3433.62] getting that information and absorbing
[3430.74 - 3435.24] it and it felt so good and all I can
[3433.62 - 3437.76] think clear and feel clear is so much
[3435.24 - 3439.56] better tomorrow is day eight
