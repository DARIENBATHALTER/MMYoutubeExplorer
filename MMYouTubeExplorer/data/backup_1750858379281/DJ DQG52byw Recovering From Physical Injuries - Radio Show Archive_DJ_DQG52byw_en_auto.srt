00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,720
injuries um I'm excited today because of

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,239
this because injuries are so confused

109
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,720
using they really are um you think they

110
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,599
wouldn't be it's kind of you think they

111
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:12,200
would be clearcut you bang your knee and

112
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,040
it hurts and uh you go to the doctor and

113
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,040
you know and the doctor says you either

114
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,280
have an injury or you have a you know or

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,000
you have an ACL issue a t an ACL or

116
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,639
whatever it is and it's straightforward

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,960
it's not really that straightforward um

118
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,560
some injuries are and you know and and

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,039
and many aren't and we're going to we're

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,800
going to go into this a lot deeper um

121
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,240
first of all it's easy to get an injury

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,680
it can happen to anyone at any time and

123
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,919
just when you're thinking it can't

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,320
happen it can happen I remember years

125
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,240
ago you know I was just walking outside

126
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,880
and there was there was some Icy boards

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,120
and I was trying to step over these icy

128
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,280
boards and I slipped right on my

129
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,080
butt and it hurt and it hurt for weeks

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:01,000
and weeks and weeks because it was one

131
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,000
hard fall on my butt and so so you know

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,520
and that was it okay it healed fine but

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,919
what about the person you know that

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,280
slips and they injure their back they

135
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,240
injure their butt they injure they

136
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,520
injure a leg and it's just not going

137
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,919
away and it's sticking around and

138
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,600
sticking around and I'm not even just

139
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,199
talking about breaks I'm not talking

140
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,800
about broken legs I'm not talking about

141
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,000
broken bones and that too we're going to

142
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,360
cover too you know making sure that we

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
you know we help every aspect of

144
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,039
injuries and you know when we get an

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,360
injury and it doesn't want to budge and

146
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,680
it doesn't want to go away it can be

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,639
devastating I mean it's it's no joke I

148
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,360
mean people can suffer and then if you

149
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,199
have a chronic illness around it or

150
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,919
chronic illness happening you know in

151
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,880
your life or something going on or other

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,440
symptoms and you have an injury that

153
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,039
doesn't want to budge that it just

154
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,720
really weighs heavy really weighs heavy

155
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,240
I mean is H does that happen to you at

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,360
all or do you know anybody that has an

157
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,759

going on you know plus you got diabetes

159
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,360
plus you have some other symptoms plus

160
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,120

163
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,120
then you you know you understand you

164
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,000
know how how harsh it can be how hard

165
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,240
how complicated you know and it makes

166
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,160
life really difficult it's one thing to

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,039
might even do anything I Ste the wrong

184
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,840
way I got a bad ankle um I walk too much

185
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:11,160
and my hip hurts um you know I can't I

186
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,720
you know I hurt my sprained my

187
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,720
wrist just opening up you know a opening

188
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,280
up a jar of something a jar of peanut

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,520
butter or whatever and you know and

190
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,599
spraying my wrist and then now I have my

191
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,319
wrist wrapped up you know it I've seen

192
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,440
it all and I has that ever happened to

193
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,080
you because it it does happen to a lot

194
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,599
of people so the injury thing is a is a

195
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,199
serious deal and then of course there's

196
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,919
injuries there's car accidents get into

197
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,080
a fender bender you get into a car

198
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,639
accident um you know we're going to

199
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,759
cover that too there's people that get

200
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,199
into a small fender bender they're not

201
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,639
even injured and then 3 days later they

202
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,520
their whole body's hurting head to toe

203
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,000
and hurts for about 2 years and then

204
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,159
they go to the doctors the doctors don't

205
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,039
even know what it is because they have

206
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,479
no physical injury you know there's

207
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,360
those kinds of injuries that mysterious

208
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,120
injuries we're going to try to cover

209
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,919
what we can there's a lot so that's

210
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,000
another example right there um getting

211
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,599
you know knocked around not having

212
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,599
anything physically you know showing or

213
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,479
physical physically tangible at the

214
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,440
doctor's office or you know at the

215
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,039
emergency room but yet you're injured

216
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,039
and this happens to a lot of people and

217
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,639
then there's some people they get

218
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,159
injured they just heal from it real

219
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,800
quick and that's it no big deal they had

220
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,680
a small injury they get better they had

221
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,959
a big injury well they healed and all

222
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,120
set done move forward you know they put

223
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:40,760
it past in their lives and that confuses

224
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,159
a lot of people too that confuses a lot

225
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,160
of people that have ongoing injuries

226
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,120
ongoing trauma and they don't know why

227
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,480
it's not going away and they don't know

228
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,839
why it's not healing and they see

229
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,000
someone else break their leg menend

230
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,360
their leg and they're off the running

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,800
and now they're playing basketball again

232
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,279
or something or whatever they're doing

233
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,240
they're you know playing a sport or

234
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,000
they're you riding their bike no problem

235
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,640
um you you know and I've seen people

236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,760
I've seen people you know uh you know

237
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,440
break their shoulder you know get a

238
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,760
break in the shoulder um doctor says

239
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,480
well it's clear it's clear and

240
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,200
straightforward should men no problem

241
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,680
should be you know should be no big deal

242
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,560
and it everything looks great it's

243
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,519
healed it's looks great on the scan but

244
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,680
then they have leftover pain that's

245
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,000
running up into their jaw running down

246
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,480
their arm and it's now troubleshooting

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,320
it's now troubleshooting and it's like

248
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,920
going to doctor to doctor neurologist

249
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,160
neurologist like what is this so our

250
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,760
injuries come with also um these

251
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,079
leftover residuals these leftover issues

252
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,560
that occur and if you're a practitioner

253
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,279
you've probably seen this if you're

254
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,480
someone suffering with it you probably

255
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,839
felt it so you know this this happens so

256
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,320
what let's talk about like the

257
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,560
difference between these so you get

258
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,839
somebody who you know they injure

259
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,279
themselves they break they break a a leg

260
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,640
they break an arm or whatever and it

261
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,360
gets casted and they come out of the

262
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,839
cast they do a little rehab a little

263
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,800
physical therapy they're off and running

264
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,440
and then they put it past them and it's

265
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,600
all good and then what about the person

266
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,959
who gets a break or not even a break

267
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,760
sprains something it's inflamed it's

268
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,959
swollen you know I've seen people with

269
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,480
knees that are just barely injured and

270
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,680
they're swelling and they're swelling

271
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,800
for months and months and there's not

272
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,480
even a tear it's not even a there's not

273
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,279
even ACL tear it's not even anything

274
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,160
else going on and I've seen that happen

275
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,920
too so what's what's the difference

276
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,680
between these two like what's what's

277
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,959
going on in here is it just what they're

278
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,360
eating is that a piece of it it's not

279
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,720
exactly um a lot has to do with other

280
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,760
things happening in the body like viral

281
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,680
conditions especially Epstein bar I mean

282
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,920
that one for sure has a lot to do with

283
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,120
injuries if you're on if you have an

284
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,160
Epstein bar um viral load inside of you

285
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,920
and it's percolating and it's going on

286
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,279
and then you get into a fender bender in

287
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,079
a car and the adrenaline's pumping and

288
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,040
flooding all through your system so tons

289
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:09,200
of adrenaline is pumping all through

290
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,920
your system saturating your body and

291
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
adrenaline is it weakens the immune

292
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,279
system that's what it does it drops the

293
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,120
immune system down to like half its

294
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,959
value when you have that kind of

295
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,040
adrenaline Surge and then if you have a

296
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,079
viral condition that's peaking about to

297
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,519
Peak that comes out next thing you know

298
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,839
it you got an epine bar situation on

299
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,880
your hands and you're feeling

300
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,560
fibromyalgia from a small fender bender

301
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,000
small car accident for the next year or

302
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,440
two or if you don't know how to address

303
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,959
it and have the answers like I put in

304
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,839
the medical medium book or I put on

305
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,240
social media or the answers I put in my

306
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,680
members groups or whatever it is if you

307
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
don't have the answers to how to move

308
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,839
forward these you're stuck with this for

309
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,040
10 years or 15 years who knows I've seen

310
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,240
this happen with people so much and so

311
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,880
that's one of the aspects is viral

312
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,440
conditions that are underlying they have

313
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,040
a huge impact on knee surgeries that's

314
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,320
another thing standard knee surgeries

315
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,920
knee replacements okay or or just you

316
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,120
know knee knee fix itss or whatever um

317
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,160
standard knee surgeries okay where

318
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,120
people get a knee replacement all right

319
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,560
should be no big deal clearcut great

320
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,560
surgeon incredible surgeon job gets done

321
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,360
great uh state-of-the-art um uh knee

322
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,360
replacement okay parts state-of-the-art

323
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,720
parts and you know basically should be

324
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,399
up and walking um in in in a in a couple

325
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
of weeks in a week or two and doing

326
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,120
rehab and then next thing you know it

327
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,120
the KNE swelling up swelling up not

328
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,720
doing good swelling up you're back at

329
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,000
the surgeon's office back getting an MRI

330
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,519
and you know not sure what's going on

331
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,600
and everything's inflamed not responding

332
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,120
good this is rampant out there this is

333
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,360
rampant and then you get someone who has

334
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,519
a knee replacement boom they're they're

335
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,279
walking they're walking in one day

336
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,800
they're walking in one day yeah well

337
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,560
maybe that's not the right thing to do

338
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,800
but they do it anyway they were walking

339
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,519
in one one day so what I'm trying to say

340
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,959
is that you know this is going on and

341
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,720
when when when that does occur and it's

342
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,440
mysterious troubleshooting like knee

343
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,199
issue that's lasting and everything

344
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,880
that's a viral condition underneath it

345
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,639
that's something very important to

346
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,600
understand the one virus that tends to

347
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,399
work with that mostly is the Epstein bar

348
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,760
that's the infamous one that actually

349
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,320
keeps the knee swollen keeps it going

350
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,040
same if someone bangs their knee or gets

351
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,639
an injury underneath it keeps it swollen

352
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,240
it keeps it inflamed could keep it

353
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,560
inflamed for 6 months keep it inflamed

354
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,320
for a year I've seen it do it for 5

355
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,839
years for people whatever and so that's

356
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,560
that's a big part of the injury World

357
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,360
another big part is the shingles virus

358
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,839
um I've seen people you know people that

359
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,519
work in packaging where they're you know

360
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,600
they're carrying packages and they're

361
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,519
doing things with packages and they're

seen strong people doing this doing this

368
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,560
work and all of a sudden one day

369
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,279
something kind of feels weird in their

370
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,320
back and in their shoulders it's

371
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,480
unexplainable they go to the

372
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,880
doctor um doctor doesn't know what it is

373
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,120
it's just now it's an inflammation

374
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,519
that's developing doctor thinks it's a

375
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,000
tear um you know next thing you know

376
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,839
you're at the surgeon's office surgeon

377
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,920
well you know you get the MRI get the

378
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,880
CAT scans doesn't look like a tear and

379
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,360
all this confusion happens and lo and

380
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,120
behold it's a shingle virus and it

381
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,440
literally stops people from using their

382
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,040
arms they take Frozen shoulders I talk

383
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,360
about it in my medical medium book about

384
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,519
the Frozen shoulders that

385
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,000
occurs so you get you know that can

386
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,560
happen out of nowhere the whole shoulder

387
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,040
freezes up people get disabled they lose

388
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,279
their jobs they got to go on you know

389
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,399
they got to go on

390
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,560
disability and then the injuries last

391
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,079
for 10 years 5 years 3 years until

392
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,320
something's done about it they go to

393
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:58,120
doctor to doctor said this is an

394
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,920
example um and maybe that's happened to

395
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,880
you something similar has happened to

396
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,000
you same thing with neck neck and

399
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,680
that I talk about that in the medical

400
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,560
medium book if you haven't gotten the

401
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,360

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,680
it that needs the information um and and

408
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,800

there that's basically what my goal is

410
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,959

412
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,720
just need people to get well in my

meeting book um and learn about how

419
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,759
shingles work so that gets in the neck

420
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,639
it gets in the shoulder someone can

421
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,680
literally just be fine one day and they

422
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,959
turn turn around they pick something off

423
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,600
the ground and their neck goes

424
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,800
completely mysteriously their neck goes

425
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,440
okay they're getting massaged they're at

426
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,639
the chiropractor's office they're

427
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,040
they're getting

428
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,199
um they're at the doctor's office either

429
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,120
way you know and they're getting it

430
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,759
looked at and there's no tear there's no

431
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,440
no break or anything like that and they

432
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,839
got they got a neck that doesn't work

433
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,720
good or you know they get a shoulder

434
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,399
that doesn't work good these are viral

435
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,040
injuries that's what they are they're

436
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,880
viruses that are kind of percing

437
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,279
percolating they've been you know kind

438
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,639
of nesting and they come out and they

439
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,759
inflame things they inflame nerves and

440
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,680
muscles and this is one part of injuries

441
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,959
that this is the big part of injuries

442
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,360
that's being overlooked so people walk

443
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:40,440
around with injuries they walk around

444
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,199
with problems they go to doctor to

445
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,199
doctor they can't get the answers they

446
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,120
need unless there's a physical thing

447
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:47,639
wrong that's really there and even when

448
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,240
that gets fixed they still have

449
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,759
inflammation they still have injuries

450
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,560
and look if you're someone who escaped

451
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,360
all that just had one little injury or

452
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,279
had a break and mended you moved forward

453
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,079
you didn't have the viral inflammation

454
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,759
thank God you know for you you because

455
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,560
you know then you know you get to you

456
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,640
get to experience some freedom and then

457
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,880
when we don't have that we lose some

458
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,520
freedom and it's difficult so that's

459
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,959
what today is about like that's what

460
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,480
we're talking about today we got to get

461
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,919
that freedom back I got to get that

462
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,480
freedom back for the person who's

463
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,520
dealing with that kind of inflammation

464
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,160
that's occurring post injury so it's

465
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,760
like post injury

466
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,880
inflammation very important um you know

467
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,840
when I'm in a crowd or around crowd

468
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,919
which I try not to do too often I try to

469
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,520
just save that energy for events so I

470
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,640
can do the life blast and I could do the

471
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,919
things you know to to be there and

472
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,080
sustain um when I'm around crowds you

473
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,120
know I see back problems everywhere so I

474
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,760
see back issues and um even if I'm even

475
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,760
if it's not at an event even if I'm

476
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,320
somewhere else and I happen to be around

477
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,640
a lot of people or I'm on the plane and

478
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,640
um and spirit's giving me information

479
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,240
about what's happening with anybody

480
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,000
behind me in front of me on the side of

481
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,200
me left of me right of me and I often

482
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,760
look at

483
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,640
backs and um I like to see the

484
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,000
conditions people's backs are in and um

485
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,880
and a lot of times people have the

486
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
messiest backs they have their discs are

487
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,400
all out of place they have old injuries

488
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,559
they have soft tissue injury they have

489
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,080
connective tissue injury they have

490
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:22,760
vertebrae injuries um they have um um

491
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,559
you know degenerative discs they have uh

492
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,840
um anything spondylosis they have all

493
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,240
kinds of different things going on with

494
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,679
their backs scoliosis you name it and

495
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:37,679
it's amazing how so many people don't

496
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,640
even feel it don't even feel it at all

497
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,760
don't even feel it when they have discs

498
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,200
bulging don't even feel it walking

499
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,600
around disc bulging discs bulging for um

500
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,720
30 20 years don't even feel it

501
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,640
and then there's someone who has

502
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,799
something equal and they feel it or

503
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,520
there's someone who has something

504
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,799
less and feels it or or there's someone

505
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,360
that doesn't have anything wrong with

506
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,039
their back and feels it like you know

507
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,799
the back looks fine the discs are lined

508
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,000
up okay there's no nerves being impeded

509
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:14,080
um nothing fishy going on and they're

510
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,320
inflamed and they're inflamed okay and

511
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,120
then there's these routine there's

512
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,080
routine back surgeries like you know

513
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,880
routine laser back surgeries or there's

514
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,520
some really good surgeons out there

515
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,120
amazing surgeons are doing really good

516
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,200
back surgeries back surgeries are not

517
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,559
like they used to be back in the 80s

518
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,880
they were just you know they were pretty

519
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:33,240
gruesome um and because of technology

520
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,120
and our surgeons we're actually getting

521
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,720

there's some good clinics that do it and

523
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,039
so forth and you know a lot of people

524
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,720
that get a back surgery because they

525
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,360

walking around in a week they'll be

542
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,880
recovering and it doesn't happen they

543
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,440
have the same pain they did before they

544
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,600
went in and even

545
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,840
worse and the Mystery of that that's the

546
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,720
troubleshooting mystery that's

547
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,840
that's what I'm talking about that has

548
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,080
everything to do with the viral

549
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,200
inflammation that we have one person

550
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,159
might have a little bit more of a

551
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,720
shingles virus maybe an Epstein bar one

552
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,480
person might have both and those are the

553
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,240
two viruses that mostly stand behind the

554
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,000
post injuries that keep them lasting

555
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,520
longer it's a big piece of it and if

556
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,080
you're eating the wrong Foods you're

557
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,600
feeding the viral situation so you're

558
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,840
getting more viral

559
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,480
inflammation and then that that's

560
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,000
occurring and so so it's a vicious cycle

561
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,679
so that's why foods are important so

562
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,640
we'll cover some of that too let's let's

563
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,240
um so let's talk about a couple of

564
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,400
different things let's go with the backs

565
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,000
because I like the backs because most

566
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,600
people have the back issues am I right I

567
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,880
mean do you have a back issue at all or

568
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,520
did you have a back issue at all maybe

569
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,520
you had one in the past maybe it creeps

570
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,760
up some people say well my back goes out

571
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,159
every fall it goes out every fall not

572
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,240
every time you fall but every fall every

573
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,840
October every November whatever every

574
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,720
late September so some people you know

575
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,000
that's what happens in their lives their

576
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,240
back the back goes out on them like once

577
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,120
a year or every 6 months or 3 months

578
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,000
maybe that's happening with you so we

579
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,640
we'll cover some good stuff with that so

580
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,960
if that's happening and then your back

581
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,520
gets better now that's a good sign if

582
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,720
it's not getting better well you got a

583
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,360
little bit of viral inflammation fine

584
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,480
and that could be dealt with but either

585
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,840
way one thing regardless of where you

586
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,799
stand with your your back you have to

587
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,640
learn how to cold pack your back you

588
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,360
know it sounds simple cold packing like

589
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,760
an ice pack like cold pack um sounds

590
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,520
simple but you'd be surprised how Nobody

591
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,640
Does

592
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,760
It Nobody Does it it's one or does it

593
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,159
enough if you get a back injury or just

594
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,440
start getting a back injury you have to

595
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,240
jump on it right away you have to get a

596
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,480
cold pack on that back that's critical

597
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,039
you don't have to burn the skin you

598
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,480
don't have to have ice pressing against

599
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,279
your skin but you have to get a cold

600
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,799
pack on it that's for first and foremost

601
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,120
that's how you can completely you know

602
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,799
elude or you can completely get around

603
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,240
it getting worse and worse and worse and

604
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:42,400
the inflammation getting worse um if

605
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,159
your back gets tweaked and it starts to

606
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,799
get inflamed there's more than the

607
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:50,640
tweaking the mild injury or the mild

608
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,720
movement you did that was off that's

609
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,840
causing this this is definitely caused

610
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,120
by a little bit of inflammation caused

611
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,200
by a viral

612
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,000
situation so you want to jump on it with

613
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,600
ice that's the first thing you want to

614
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,240
do um 30 minutes twice a day that's

615
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,520
important that's a really good amount

616
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,279
right there you want to do it in the

617
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,360
afternoon you want to do it at night if

618
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,960
you can do it in the morning um but you

619
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,159
want to do it every day the key for this

620
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,080
and why you have to do this is you have

621
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:24,039
to train your nerves to get DEF flamed

622
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,440
even though defamed is probably not a

623
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:30,000
word you want to you want to train that

624
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,080
nerve to calm down push that nerve back

625
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
okay because you that's a critical piece

626
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,640
to it especially if you're chronic if

627
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,520
you're chronic with back issues chronic

628
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,320
with back injuries you want to train the

629
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,440
nerves back you want to train them down

630
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,120
if you don't they're going to get

631
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,320
inflamed they're going to start to crack

632
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,679
they're going to start to harden they're

633
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,080
going to start to dry up and you can't

634
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,840
train them down as easy okay so that's

635
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,919
that's number one if you've been doing

636
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,039
this a long time meaning in pain with

637
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,679
your back going through struggles with

638
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,600
it for a long time time then you still

639
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,159
you have to learn how to cold pack it it

640
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,600
still matters um another thing is you

641
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,200
want heat on your back early in the

642
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,120
morning or in the morning you want heat

643
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,240
in the morning and then ice from there

644
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,320
on or cold packs from there on

645
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,679
throughout the day this is really

646
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,799
critical very important um the heat will

647
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,679
loosen up the muscles in the morning

648
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,799
because the cold packs in the ice does

649
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,640
tighten up muscles and tense up muscles

650
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,559
but it's doing that at the at the same

651
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,720
time it's training the nerve to calm

652
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,120
down it's pushing the nerves back you

653
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,480
want the nerve to be allowed to be

654
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,520
pushed back and trained back so um so

655
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,760
what you do is you do heat in the

656
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,480
morning okay and heat swells up the

657
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,720
nerve a little bit but it but it loosens

658
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,840
up all the muscles and that's what we

659
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,360
want and then later on during the day in

660
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,000
the evening it's the cold packs you want

661
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,760
the cold packs there you want to train

662
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,360
those nerves down that's a great way for

663
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,240
a chronic back problem to heal over time

664
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,320
I've seen some people with some slip

665
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,760
discs that doctors were like no has to

666
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,880
be surgery can't go with that it has to

667
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,600
be surgery there's no way around it and

668
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,360
you know I've seen the people suffering

669
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,480
with this and then once you do some of

670
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,279
these techniques and you and you work on

671
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,960
it just right you literally can heal

672
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,720
from it move on and not have back

673
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,039
surgery um I've helped people many times

674
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,559
over that so this is something to to be

675
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,080
thinking about um we're going to go over

676
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,200
supplements for all this stuff a little

677
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,279
bit later too go over supplements and

678
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,760
some

679
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,360
foods um as well so the back issues are

680
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,799
big because so many people go through

681
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,080
them um people have problems and then

682
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,720
you get the sciatic nerve sciatic the

683
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,120
sciatic nerve that's a big deal you get

684
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,760
the paraph foris you get the nerves in

685
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,760
the paraph foris nerves in the GL the

686
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,720
glutalor nerve all these different

687
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:02,039
nerves that run through S nerve

688
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,919
especially and what happens is with

689
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,320
people with with um back injuries and

690
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,640
viral inflammation they'll get pain on

691
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,760
their toe but not on their back they'll

692
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,600
get pain on their foot pain on their

693
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,039
calf like unexplained debilitating pain

694
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,679
on their calf that's so bad you can't

695
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,440
even stand you can't stand you can't

696
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,159
move you can't walk they go to the

697
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,159
doctors they get mized they get cat

698
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,880
skins everything checks out fine nothing

699
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,760
wrong um but they have pain that's could

700
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,679
be in their thigh it could be on their

701
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,200
calf it could be literally down by their

702
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,279
toes it could be on the top of their

703
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,320
foot and the pain is so vicious where

704
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:40,919
there's nothing that can really treat it

705
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,640
except for heavy drugs heavy medications

706
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:47,640
you know um lots of that kind of thing

707
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,640
and and so this is this is a sciatic

708
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,120
problem mostly you know tibial nerve and

709
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,120
sciatic problem caused by a viral

710
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,000
inflammation this is this is viral it

711
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,399
gets into the lower spine lower back it

712
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,039
can't be seen you can't see on MRIs you

713
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:04,960
can't see it on CAT scans and and the

714
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,799
the nerve sends a signal down to the

715
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,520
foot sends a signal down to the calf now

716
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,960
if you're one of those um yeah you're

717
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,880
you're dealing with it you know what I'm

718
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,240
talking about so that's another viral

719
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,679
inflammatory situation mostly from the

720
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,000
shingles virus the sciatic nerve mostly

721
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:24,480
from the shingles virus um and so that's

722
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,880
a big deal something to know about so

723
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,080
you got the heat in the morning like I

724
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,039
said before you got cold and cold packs

725
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,919
in the

726
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,320
afternoon um and in the evening very

727
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,640
important and then with injuries it's

728
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:41,679
important to move it's important to walk

729
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,559
now it's a catch 22 if you got somebody

730
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,039
with really bad fibromyalgia they got a

731
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,600
really bad Epstein bar issue they're

732
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,679
inflamed in all their

733
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:53,760
nerves if they don't move it gets worse

734
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,399
if they move too much it gets worse so

735
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,320
there's this vicious cycle I mean right

736
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,679
have you ever known anybody like that or

737
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:04,919
have you gone through that and um so

738
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:07,159
when that happens it's really really um

739
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,240
really debilitating but but it kind of

740
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,080
breaks the spirit because you don't

741
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,600
you're really not allowed to exercise

742
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,000
obviously you know because you feel like

743
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
if you push it too much you're going to

744
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,200
be all flared up everything's going to

745
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,720
hurt including your back including your

746
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,799
arms including your legs neck whatever

747
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,799
maybe fatigue will take over too but if

748
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:26,399
you don't move it can get worse as well

749
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,360
everything can get worse so there's

750
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,720
there's we have to find a comfortable

751
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,480
like place for you we're in movement you

752
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,360
know if you're that kind of person we

753
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,159
have to find that comfortable spot so

754
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,760
you know you got to move a little bit

755
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,039
you got to walk a little bit same thing

756
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,039
with a lower back problem in sciatic in

757
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:47,600
a sciatic nerve issue whether it's viral

758
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:49,480
or not whether it's the shingles or it's

759
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,840
a it's a you know an injury where your

760
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,760
disc is collapsing whatever it is we

761
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,320
have to move a little it's very

762
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,840
important for Recovery to actually move

763
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,559
walking sticks are important for

764
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,320
injuries don't have so much pride that

765
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,679
you can't get a walking stick and that's

766
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,200
that's that's not that's not you know

767
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,159
it's not debatable it's not a it's not

768
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,679
an issue that you know you're too young

769
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,960
or something in your life to have a

770
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,559
walking stick or whatever walking sticks

771
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,840
are really good for recoveries you have

772
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,360
a knee issue you have a knee problem um

773
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,039
don't be afraid to use a walking stick

774
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,519
for a little while you got a back issue

775
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,919
don't be afraid to take pressure off by

776
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:27,720
using a walking stick for a little while

777
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,279
there's some really good ones out there

778
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,320
there's these fiberglass ones they're

779
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,240
adjustable they have different handles

780
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,640
on them I love that for people with

781
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,000
injuries people with chronic illness

782
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,760
people with chronic

783
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
injuries and it can actually help you

784
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,960
walk a little bit more and heal a little

785
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,039
bit faster until you don't need it

786
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,679
anymore you don't need the crutch

787
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:51,000
anymore so that's how it works there um

788
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,760
back braces back supports try a few

789
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,480
different ones I think they're fantastic

790
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,799
you know Bower find is my favorite

791
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,640
company for people I've gotten better

792
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,600
results by offering back supports and

793
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,000
knee supports and elbow supports and

794
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,919
wrist supports and and uh ankle supports

795
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,600
from Bower find I think it's like B

796
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:16,399
Aur um and then um what's it find f i n

797
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,120
d or something but do a search the

798
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,039
spelling isn't correct on all thing but

799
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,440
it's bow find um so what you want to do

800
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,080
is you want to check out their their

801
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,799
supports now they have compression

802
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,360
supports if you have a knee issue

803
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:33,360
wearing a compressive sleeve compression

804
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,000
sleeve is ideal incredibly ideal and

805
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,919
then taking it off throughout the day

806
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,480
and putting cold packs on your knees um

807
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,519
getting the inflammation the swelling

808
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,960
down I've seen some bad knee injuries

809
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,799
heal with no surgeries without needing

810
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,840
surgeries and I've seen ones that people

811
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:51,039
went through surgery that wouldn't heal

812
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,640
heal from doing the right things um some

813
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,240
people say well I don't want to you know

814
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,159
weaken the muscles in my leg by using a

815
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,880
sleeve or a compression support for my

816
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,919
knee and or a back brace for my brace

817
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,519
for a back support I don't want to kind

818
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,760
of you know people say well I don't want

819
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:09,960
to kind of do that but that's that's

820
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,200
actually not correct information um the

821
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,760
support is critical and it's important

822
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,399
and you're still using your muscles with

823
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,240
the support or not even with using the

824
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:20,200
support you're still using your muscles

825
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,559
you're still using everything you know

826
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,399
that you're using you're still using

827
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,600
your body the only difference is is

828
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,519
actually you're taking a little less

829
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,519
pressure off the injury and the

830
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,880
inflammation or the viral inflammation

831
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,240
and injury you're taking a little less

832
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,320
pressure off and you're able to walk a

833
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,080
little bit more and you're able to get

834
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,120
stronger and protected at the same time

835
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,519
so compressive compression sleeves are

836
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,799
really good uh knee braces are really

837
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,559
good not knee braces but knee sleeves I

838
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:48,760
really like those so these are some of

839
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,880
the things to do including the walking

840
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:57,360
sticks these are important um and you

841
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,360
know understand that that with injury

842
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,080
injuries um

843
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,240
frustration we have to deal with

844
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,000
frustration in a different way there's

845
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,799
nothing more frustrating than an injury

846
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,120
because if it happens for a silly reason

847
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,519
you trip off the front porch you slip on

848
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:18,039
some ice um you know you hurt yourself

849
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:21,120
doing something we have to we have to

850
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:23,000
emotionally get grounded about it all we

851
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,600
really do because there's nothing more

852
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,120
frustrating nothing more agitating than

853
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,720
having an injury feeling like you could

854
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,080
have avoided it or some maybe something

855
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,399
could have been different that day maybe

856
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,039
you shouldn't you should have walked on

857
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,039
the ice differently whatever it is sure

858
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:38,960
we could learn from our mistakes but we

859
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,799
make these mistakes and we get injured

860
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,320
it's it's a normal process of Life quite

861
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,639
honestly I have never yet seen a single

862
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,000
person not sustain you know not sustain

863
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:52,720
one injury and in their life no matter

864
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,080
what some many some less some really bad

865
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,760
ones some not so bad ones regardless it

866
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,799
happens frustration levels we have to

867
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,120
kind of

868
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:02,039
calm down we have to calm down about it

869
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,880
we can't beat ourselves up we can't

870
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,760
punish ourselves for our injuries that's

871
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,120
something that's very important I know

872
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,080
people that you know they get injuries

873
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,519
literally by the week because they're

874
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,919
struggling with a chronic illness

875
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,399
they're trying to move around they get

876
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,080
small injuries while they're doing it

877
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:17,880
they slip they fall all kinds of things

878
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,760
are happening and we have to keep a

879
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,919
sense of humor the best we can as bad as

880
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,240
it is and it is you know it's a struggle

881
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,320
we got to keep a sense of humor we have

882
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,200
to stay lighthearted the best we can

883
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,559
with these injuries and the pain we go

884
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,360
through with injuries so that's

885
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:33,159
something to keep in mind I know you're

886
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,760
probably saying hey Anthony easier said

887
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:38,000
than done I've been through a lot in my

888
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,519
life and it's easier said than done and

889
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,919
you know it's hard to put a smile on my

890
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,080
face when I'm dealing with injuries and

891
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,679
dealing with pain dealing with the

892
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,919
suffering I've been through and I I

893
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,080
understand I totally understand just

894
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,519
that the frustration tightens up all the

895
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,960
muscles anger tightens up the muscles

896
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,840
tightens up the nerves puts more

897
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,440
pressure on the

898
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,279
injuries so we have to find a way to

899
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,720
kind of you know relax and and stay as

900
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,320
calm as we can around it and that's why

901
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,279

proud of you exactly exactly you're

907
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,800
probably you know you probably don't

908
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:22,599
need to hear that information CU you're

909
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,079
already working on it I get it so but I

910
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:28,200
can't help it I can't help but talk

911
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:30,000
about it so you know want to talk about

912
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,480
ankle injuries when someone gets an

913
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,480
ankle injury um the idea is to stay off

914
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,879
of it right away sprained ankle you know

915
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,040
um ankle injury bruised ankle um but

916
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,760
there's a fine line between that you

917
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,040
have to use that ankle a little bit

918
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,480
that's why supports are good when you

919
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,040
get an angel ankle injury an angel an

920
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,359
ankle injury well you need angels too

921
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,800
when it comes down injuries we're going

922
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,160
to cover that in a few minutes as well

923
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,560
we're going to bring in the angel for

924
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,640
injuries they do help and um so when you

925
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,720
get that kind of ankle issue and you you

926
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,040
definitely need need the support really

927
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,880
important you need to do things like

928
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,359
cold packs like I said on the back you

929
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,040
have to still do that for knees you

930
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,440
still have to do that for ankles

931
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:20,960
remember that that's important um but

932
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,160
you have to use the ankle you may not

933
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,240
have to use it on the first day or the

934
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,119
second day but you have to start using

935
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,680
it with the injury and you could talk to

936
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,079
your doctor about that you could talk to

937
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,480
your practitioner physical therapist or

938
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,480
or or you know or your healer or your

939
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,400
natural practitioner or whatever you can

940
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,599
and but it's important to move a little

941
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,839
bit you know putting a little weight on

942
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,440
it putting a little pressure on it when

943
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:48,839
when it starts to come around a little

944
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,839
bit because if you don't the injury can

945
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:53,240
sustain longer it could stay longer it

946
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:56,119
can get worse it's there's this Catch 22

947
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,119
fine line in between there don't overuse

948
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,800
it okay because we can get in trouble

949
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:01,440
that way too but you got to use it a

950
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,640
little bit the reason why I'm saying

951
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,480
this I know people have injured their

952
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,839
their

953
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,760
ankles and stopped using their foot and

954
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,000
they've done too much rest on it and

955
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,960
very little movement where it's just

956
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,400
just very little and it slowed down the

957
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,560
healing process it you have to walk on

958
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,040
it a little bit I'm not taking take I'm

959
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,040
not saying take a one mile walk with it

960
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,480
saying just maybe just a little bit more

961
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,560
around the house maybe a little bit more

962
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,119
around the kitchen and then rest it rest

963
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,079
it and kind of gauge it this one way to

964
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,680
help heal the ankles ankles actually

965
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,040
need that movement um and so that's one

966
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,440
tip I could give you that's really

967
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,359
important I'm offering that tip because

968
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,680
so many people ask me about it too they

969
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,160
they're like look I twisted my ankle and

970
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,240
it's not healing or I twisted it thought

971
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,839
it was healed and then I took a hike and

972
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,160
now I'm worse than I was before so

973
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:54,680
there's this gradual thing of movement

974
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,800
healing moving

975
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,240
forward and you move forward now if you

976
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,240
had fibromyalgia which is Epstein bar

977
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,960
with the nervous system inflaming nerves

978
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,400
so if you've had fibro or you have

979
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,640
fibromyalgia and you twist your ankle

980
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,400
you could be dealing with a little bit

981
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,800
more of a longer injury a longer

982
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:15,000
inflammation process that I talked about

983
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,640
before and you know that that requires

984
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,960
yeah Tender Loving Care Plus like I said

985
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,599
before it's about knocking down the

986
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,200
Epstein bar you know get a copy of the

987
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,800
book so you learn about Epstein bar so

988
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,400
you know what you're doing there um so

989
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,680
that's a big piece of it and so I want

990
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,640
to talk about nerve damage so nerve

991
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,800
damage with injuries anybody out there

992
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,400
dealing with like nerve damage or

993
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,079
they're told they have nerve damage um

994
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,119
because that's what happens some people

995
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:44,599
have these nerve they they have these

996
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,960
injuries these physical injuries the

997
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,200
injury goes away and they might have had

998
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,480
some surgery with these physical

999
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,400
injuries might have been in a car

1000
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,119
accident whatever it is that's happened

1001
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:58,319
fallen off of a horse um and the doctor

1002
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,560
says well you have nerve damage now you

1003
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:02,400
you that's what's going on here and your

1004
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,839
nerves are damaged and that's why you're

1005
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,920
feeling this pain it could be like this

1006
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,480
for the rest of your life there is ways

1007
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,960
of recovering the nerves there are ways

1008
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,119
of healing the

1009
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,319
nerves and it can be done so um and

1010
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:16,599
we're going to cover that with some of

1011
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:20,880
the supplements we're going to talk

1012
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:24,280
about uh that's important so don't feel

1013
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,280
you can't heal your injuries try to you

1014
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,599
know let that go I was talking to

1015
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,280
someone the other day and they were like

1016
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:33,400
Anthony I there's no way I can heal and

1017
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,599
I said well that that doesn't sound

1018
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,920
right cuz I don't believe that number

1019
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,880
one because you can heal there's no

1020
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,240
question you can and tell me why you

1021
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,160
can't heal that's what I said to the

1022
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,680
person they said well I just it's been a

1023
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,400
long time and I got this nerve damage

1024
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,200
and I got this you know I have this

1025
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,280
injury and I got another injury and it's

1026
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,880
just not healing it's been going on 15

1027
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,640
years the doctor says I'm always going

1028
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,440
to have this

1029
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,160
and it seems like it's getting worse and

1030
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,839
then when the weather comes in and the

1031
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,960
rain comes in and the you know the the

1032
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,800
low pressure storms come in or low

1033
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,319
pressure or high pressure I feel it my

1034
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,119
whole body hurts it's not getting better

1035
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:13,960
you feel the barometric change you feel

1036
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,359
the weather you know that's that's what

1037
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,839
this person was telling me and yeah I

1038
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:19,400
understand because when weather changes

1039
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,160
and weather comes in and the damp

1040
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,720
weather comes in and the low pressure

1041
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,440
storms come in we feel it because

1042
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,400
there's pressure it puts pressure on our

1043
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,440
nerves and I said well look first of all

1044
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,520
we have to get rid of the thought that

1045
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,200
you can't heal that that has to go away

1046
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,920
we have to throw that away that has to

1047
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,560
be thrown in the garbage so let's

1048
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,760
crumple that up like a you know a piece

1049
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,480
of bad paper and let's just you know

1050
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,520
let's just shoot it into the wastepaper

1051
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,359
basket because that's where that has to

1052
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,720
go right now and so well the person said

1053
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:52,640
well it's really hard for me to let that

1054
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,200
go because I just I've been convinced

1055
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,720
there's just no way this is healing I'm

1056
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,960
convinced and and I said

1057
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,960
look number one okay your body responds

1058
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,400
to your thoughts bottom line it does it

1059
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,160
responds to your thoughts it needs that

1060
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,800
tender love and care you have to give

1061
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,319
your body a chance and the person said

1062
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,640
well I gave my body a chance I was all

1063
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:18,960
excited I was all enthusiastic at the

1064
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,240
beginning of my injury and you know I

1065
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,839
thought I can heal and you know I went

1066
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,599
to a lot of different practitioners and

1067
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,839
I thought I can heal and it didn't

1068
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,880
happen and I said look we're dealing

1069
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,680
with a few different things we're

1070
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,079
dealing with a lot of lot of different

1071
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,119

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,160
spirit and I number one new information

1073
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:38,240
that's key and critical uh that's why I

1074
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,480
do the radio show anyway too and we're

1075
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,599

1078
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:47,200
in your body you're going to click it on

1079
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,680
right now you're going to tell your body

1080
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,480
you know you can heal you're going to

1081
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,040
have to do it I don't care if you don't

1082
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,240
even believe it you're going to have to

1083
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,960
tell your body you're going to have to

1084
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,520
start with that and I told this person I

1085
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,760
said you you got to start with that

1086
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,839
three times a day I said three times a

1087
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,440
day I want you telling your body that it

1088
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,480
can heal that it's going to heal and

1089
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,760
it's healing three times a day I said I

1090
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,480
don't even care if you believe it at

1091
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,920
this point so you don't have to believe

1092
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,079
it I just want you to tell your body

1093
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,520
that so the person did that three times

1094
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,960
a day told her body you're going to heal

1095
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,200
if there's you know there's no doubt

1096
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,440
about it okay um Anthony says you're

1097
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,720
going to heal I'm saying you're going to

1098
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,599
heal yes so this person told their body

1099
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,920
of course the person didn't believe it

1100
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:29,119
meaning didn't believe they were going

1101
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,359
to heal but I told that person that

1102
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,319
doesn't matter just don't worry about

1103
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,640
that right now just tell your body and

1104
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,680
it was three times a day for 2 weeks and

1105
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,599
in two weeks less pain was occurring in

1106
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,800
the body a little bit less pain and then

1107
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,400
belief started kind of getting stronger

1108
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,160
and then all with that we started

1109
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,800
working on different foods and then we

1110
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,200
started working on supplements like the

1111
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,480
B12 Dino silk of alamin I'm always put

1112
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,640
putting everybody into because that one

1113
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,960
right there is literally lifechanging

1114
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,280
for people with nerve issues

1115
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,560
neurological problems you know nervous

1116
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,800
system problems from viral issues

1117
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,280
injuries you name it getting on the B12

1118
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,400
and it started coming together for the

1119
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,520
first time in 15 years and then the

1120
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,839
belief got stronger and the faith got

1121
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,880
stronger and then when this person said

1122
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:24,040
to their body I know you're healing they

1123
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,440
actually had this feeling like of Joy

1124
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,119
like this flutter in their in their

1125
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,920
tummy this flutter this little kind of

1126
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,960
this light feeling that went through

1127
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,680
them kind of like Goosebumps and and

1128
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,280
like almost air rushed through them that

1129
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,520
they actually were healing and they

1130
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,359
believed it and the faith was building

1131
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,680
and if you bend through an injury for a

1132
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,680
long time and you just don't think he

1133
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,280
could move forward we're going to we're

1134
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,079
going to switch that around we have to

1135
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,880
switch that around and we're going to

1136
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:55,920
move forward chances are you've had

1137

00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,400
is pretty good I say it's pretty good

1239
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,839
the funny thing is is that people people

1240
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,960
really like their glucosamine I'm not

1241
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:56,240
going to take it away from them I've

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,599
you you try it you see how it works and

1246
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,800
then you you know you can you cannot use

1247
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:11,800
it but I've seen glucosamine help some

1248
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:15,680
