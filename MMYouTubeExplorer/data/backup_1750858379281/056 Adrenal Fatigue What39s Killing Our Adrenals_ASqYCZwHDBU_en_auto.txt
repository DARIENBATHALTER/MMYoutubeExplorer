[47.88 - 53.60] live in a world where we don't realize
[50.28 - 58.04] it but we get our kicks from adrenaline
[53.60 - 61.00] our adrenaline we get high and for many
[58.04 - 66.04] it's how we get by but who pays the
[61.00 - 69.60] price is it your adrenals or you or both
[66.04 - 73.96] or even everyone around you adrenaline
[69.60 - 77.88] is liquid gold precious resource but are

[113.88 - 118.92] few years ago yeah you know the sick
[116.28 - 121.56] part about it was everyone was so pumped
[118.92 - 123.80] up that they cheered her on they thought
[121.56 - 126.32] she did it on purpose but then people
[123.80 - 129.28] started to realize there was no water

[138.64 - 143.96] whoa do you ever hear that old saying
[141.32 - 145.92] whatever floats your boat someone likes
[143.96 - 147.56] to do something they're into something
[145.92 - 150.08] somebody says to them I don't know
[147.56 - 154.40] whatever floats your boat man whatever
[150.08 - 158.44] your boat what it really means is and
[154.40 - 161.56] what it really boils down to is where
[158.44 - 164.48] and how do you get your adrenaline High
[161.56 - 169.04] your adrenaline fix where does it come
[164.48 - 171.12] from what turns you on what are you into
[169.04 - 174.48] people don't realize it but they have
[171.12 - 178.12] adrenaline addictions and we take our
[174.48 - 181.08] adrenals for granted every day our
[178.12 - 184.60] adrenals they do so so much for us and
[181.08 - 188.20] in return we don't do a lot for them
[184.60 - 192.84] most people don't do anything for their
[188.20 - 195.36] adrenals that's right nothing NADA we're
[192.84 - 197.20] not talking about hey we respect our
[195.36 - 200.08] adrenals and that's what we're taught
[197.20 - 203.20] every day we're taught the opposite
[200.08 - 205.72] we're taught to destroy them in many
[203.20 - 209.40] situations we're taught to annihilate
[205.72 - 211.16] them but by default we sometimes look
[209.40 - 215.56] out for our adrenals but we don't
[211.16 - 219.16] realize it meditation yoga reading a
[215.56 - 224.40] book watching something cing sitting
[219.16 - 228.08] down to eat sitting in nature sleeping
[224.40 - 232.36] but the good we do can easily get
[228.08 - 237.56] cancelled by the bad get offset by The

[303.56 - 308.28] can't be done without adrenaline and we
[306.60 - 311.64] don't tell ourselves when we're doing
[308.28 - 314.16] anything this is because of adrenaline
[311.64 - 318.72] without my adrenals I don't know what I
[314.16 - 322.32] would do wait I'm opening up my car door
[318.72 - 323.64] I'm getting in I'm starting my car
[322.32 - 327.92] that's because of
[323.64 - 329.96] adrenaline wow it's got a dawn on me
[327.92 - 332.16] okay let's keep on going I got to stop
[329.96 - 335.16] here and do an appointment oh I'm
[332.16 - 338.12] getting a massage today I can't do that
[335.16 - 341.72] without adrenaline only adrenaline
[338.12 - 344.36] allows you to actually do that I got to
[341.72 - 347.76] talk to my therapist today I got to sit
[344.36 - 352.04] down at her office talk for about an
[347.76 - 355.44] hour I got to just unload talk about my
[352.04 - 358.60] hardships I got to just let out some
[355.44 - 363.80] tears and it can only happen because of
[358.60 - 364.92] adrenaline every basic normal task every
[363.80 - 367.44] single
[364.92 - 371.48] chore any
[367.44 - 375.56] project anything work rated play related
[371.48 - 378.84] life related is adrenaline based and our
[375.56 - 382.36] adrenals help us battle and handle
[378.84 - 386.08] stress any kind of bad news any kind of
[382.36 - 389.04] stress put on us it takes adrenaline to
[386.08 - 391.84] help defend us from that stress to help
[389.04 - 394.64] protect this so when you get given bad
[391.84 - 396.60] news or you're up against a challenge
[394.64 - 399.08] that adrenaline being released is
[396.60 - 401.80] helping you power through it's there to
[399.08 - 404.24] help you make quick decisions what to do
[401.80 - 405.68] where to go and there's different levels
[404.24 - 407.72] of adrenaline running through your
[405.68 - 409.96] system and being released if you're
[407.72 - 412.24] under a little bit of stress that's one
[409.96 - 414.04] level adrenaline's being released it's
[412.24 - 416.88] helping you to move quick it's helping
[414.04 - 418.56] you to think fast and then there might
[416.88 - 420.64] be something else more challenging in
[418.56 - 423.00] that moment more adrenaline's being
[420.64 - 425.96] released and that's helping you to get
[423.00 - 428.20] on the move to get out of the way to do
[425.96 - 431.64] something and then there's adrenaline
[428.20 - 433.64] for everyday projects and jobs chores
[431.64 - 435.32] things that you're doing so you can
[433.64 - 438.60] think about what you're doing stay
[435.32 - 442.88] focused get things done and then there's
[438.60 - 445.68] fight or flight it's either run or fight
[442.88 - 448.24] something happens there's a fire you
[445.68 - 450.52] need to hustle you need to think fast
[448.24 - 452.68] it's an emergency adrenaline's being
[450.52 - 455.28] released into your bloodstream it's
[452.68 - 457.52] flooding your central nervous system do
[455.28 - 460.36] I jump out of this window or do I take
[457.52 - 462.00] the staircase how do I get out of here
[460.36 - 464.52] and then you go to the beach you're in
[462.00 - 467.40] the ocean you're in the water playing in
[464.52 - 470.40] the waves and then you get stung by a
[467.40 - 474.12] jellyfish you feel an overwhelming
[470.40 - 475.88] burning stinging pain on your leg you
[474.12 - 478.80] don't know what it is at first and then
[475.88 - 481.68] you realize it's jellyfish and you start
[478.80 - 484.44] yelling and frantically trying to swim
[481.68 - 487.52] out of the ocean it takes a large amount
[484.44 - 491.40] of adrenaline to service Us in that
[487.52 - 494.04] moment to help bolster us so we can move
[491.40 - 497.00] and we can think and we can react and we
[494.04 - 499.80] can feel and a lot of us have a storage
[497.00 - 501.88] bin of adrenaline just for this occasion
[499.80 - 504.24] just in case something happens a fight
[501.88 - 505.64] ORF flight moment or a moment when we
[504.24 - 507.84] have to become
[505.64 - 510.00] superhuman like if somebody is changing
[507.84 - 513.76] their Tire on the side of the road and a
[510.00 - 515.72] car falls on them you got to be there
[513.76 - 518.36] and that superhuman strength kicks in
[515.72 - 520.68] that adrenaline you hear them screaming
[518.36 - 522.60] while the car is on their torso and then
[520.68 - 524.96] you go and you lift up the car so they
[522.60 - 527.44] can slide out so let's gain some
[524.96 - 530.00] perspective here if that happens a car
[527.44 - 532.20] falls on someone and the person that's
[530.00 - 536.04] going to rescue them is a guy who's
[532.20 - 537.84] about 6'4 has a lot of muscle or just a
[536.04 - 539.80] guy that's really strong has a lot of
[537.84 - 542.76] muscle he's got to have a lot of
[539.80 - 545.12] adrenaline storage he has to have strong
[542.76 - 547.40] reserves adrenaline reserves and there's
[545.12 - 549.72] a good chance he can lift up the car or
[547.40 - 552.76] the back of a small car just enough for
[549.72 - 555.16] somebody to be able to get out but what
[552.76 - 557.72] if it's a strong muscly guy he looks
[555.16 - 560.56] good he's got a lot of muscle and he's
[557.72 - 564.00] there and he tries to lift the car and
[560.56 - 566.60] he has weak adrenals weak adrenaline
[564.00 - 568.36] reserves it's just not there he just
[566.60 - 570.84] doesn't have it in him and he's trying
[568.36 - 574.12] to lift a car he's not going to be able
[570.84 - 576.80] to do the job that needs to be done it's
[574.12 - 579.24] that lack of adrenaline that lack of
[576.80 - 581.60] adrenal strength that can get you in
[579.24 - 584.40] trouble so if a crisis comes and you're
[581.60 - 586.28] needed it's that lack of adrenal
[584.40 - 588.60] strength that can get in the way and
[586.28 - 590.76] make it so that you don't perform like
[588.60 - 593.04] say somebody else can perform if their
[590.76 - 595.40] adrenals are strong I've seen this
[593.04 - 597.60] happen with bodybuilders they got a
[595.40 - 599.56] routine they're doing it for years
[597.60 - 601.64] they're building a lot of muscle they
[599.56 - 602.96] know what kind of weight they can lift
[601.64 - 605.92] they know what kind of ground they can
[602.96 - 609.44] move and then they get severe adrenal
[605.92 - 612.12] fatigue they get adrenal issues their
[609.44 - 614.72] adrenals are wasted and then they can't
[612.12 - 616.84] do the workouts they used to do they're
[614.72 - 619.32] dragging they're suffering they're
[616.84 - 620.88] struggling they're going to the doctors
[619.32 - 623.08] they don't know what it is they don't
[620.88 - 625.04] know if it's fatigue chronic fatigue
[623.08 - 627.80] they don't know if it's depression or
[625.04 - 630.20] anxiety and the guy is struggling and
[627.80 - 632.92] slowly they start losing muscle they
[630.20 - 635.32] can't do what they used to do adrenal
[632.92 - 636.96] issues are getting in the way and it
[635.32 - 639.12] takes a little time for them to lose the
[636.96 - 641.12] muscle because at first they have the
[639.12 - 643.32] muscle it's there but they just don't
[641.12 - 645.64] have that inner strength because they
[643.32 - 647.92] have adrenal issues and then over time
[645.64 - 649.92] if they can't keep the muscle on by
[647.92 - 651.92] using them enough to the capacity of
[649.92 - 653.92] what they were doing before and that
[651.92 - 657.84] adrenal issue gets in the way they start
[653.92 - 659.56] to slowly waste away wasting muscle away
[657.84 - 662.72] it's partly why if you've ever heard
[659.56 - 666.48] this before that sometimes a skinny
[662.72 - 669.72] Scrappy person tends to be able to do a
[666.48 - 671.92] lot lift a lot it's like that group of
[669.72 - 674.56] firefighters there's one that's skinny
[671.92 - 677.28] and lanky but the guy can lift a heavy
[674.56 - 679.28] burning log or that construction crew
[677.28 - 682.56] where you got a skinny lanky guy he's
[679.28 - 684.72] got muscle he's toned the guy looks good
[682.56 - 686.72] he can lift a lot of bricks he's known
[684.72 - 689.76] for it and then there's a couple of guys
[686.72 - 691.48] on that same crew one is really built
[689.76 - 693.80] he's always wondering how that skinny
[691.48 - 695.72] lanky guy that Scrappy guy can lift all
[693.80 - 698.16] those bricks when he can't really lift
[695.72 - 701.08] them as much or as good a reason
[698.16 - 703.28] adrenaline plays a role in this and then
[701.08 - 705.16] you ask the skinny Scrappy guy how do
[703.28 - 707.84] you do it and the guy would be like I
[705.16 - 710.88] just have a strong back but really it's
[707.84 - 713.56] more than that it's adrenal reserves
[710.88 - 715.96] adrenaline strength and we need
[713.56 - 719.32] adrenaline reserves for that special
[715.96 - 721.36] moment like giving birth that's when
[719.32 - 724.68] fight ORF flight happens for a woman
[721.36 - 726.76] having a baby the baby has to come out
[724.68 - 729.08] the body knows this the central nervous
[726.76 - 730.92] system knows this it's time the
[729.08 - 733.60] reproductive system knows this and
[730.92 - 735.76] adrenaline is needed when the water
[733.60 - 738.68] breaks people around a woman will say
[735.76 - 740.88] stay calm stay calm everybody stay calm
[738.68 - 743.00] let's get in the car let's get moving
[740.88 - 744.92] let's get going to the hospital or if
[743.00 - 747.12] it's a birth at home okay let's get
[744.92 - 750.76] things ready because everybody's
[747.12 - 753.08] freaking out adrenaline is Flowing the
[750.76 - 755.36] woman's adrenal strength means
[753.08 - 757.48] everything adrenaline reserves and
[755.36 - 760.68] adrenal strength can determine if it's
[757.48 - 764.16] going to be an easy birth or a very
[760.68 - 766.72] arduous labor when the woman pushes with
[764.16 - 769.96] all her might
[766.72 - 773.40] pushes really hard with everything she
[769.96 - 777.36] has every bit of inner strength every
[773.40 - 780.40] cell in her body every single piece of
[777.36 - 782.88] her existence is in into that one big
[780.40 - 785.96] huge push and then that other big huge
[782.88 - 788.80] push to get the baby to move it's
[785.96 - 790.80] adrenaline behind it adrenaline reserves
[788.80 - 794.40] can determine if it's going to be a
[790.80 - 798.36] strong push a very productive push or a
[794.40 - 801.56] weak push an unproductive push a lot of
[798.36 - 804.48] emergency C-sections are because of weak
[801.56 - 806.80] adrenals if the labor really long it's
[804.48 - 809.44] not the woman that's giving up or it's
[806.80 - 812.28] not her real physical muscles or
[809.44 - 814.96] physical body just giving up it's the
[812.28 - 817.08] lack of adrenaline it's the adrenals
[814.96 - 819.68] giving up during that child birth which
[817.08 - 821.28] could lead to an emergency C-section
[819.68 - 824.00] there are many different reasons why
[821.28 - 826.88] women can have complicated childbirth
[824.00 - 829.40] situations but one of the most common is
[826.88 - 831.28] weak adrenals but women aren't being
[829.40 - 833.28] taught to protect their adrenals
[831.28 - 836.40] strengthen their adrenals and preserve
[833.28 - 838.68] their adrenals and prepare them prepare
[836.40 - 840.72] them for childbirth but it's the
[838.68 - 843.72] opposite women are taught to actually
[840.72 - 846.92] destroy their adrenal glands caffeine
[843.72 - 850.68] chocolate coffee tea intermittent
[846.92 - 853.60] fasting high fat diets cold plunging
[850.68 - 856.56] restricting calories low sugar diets low
[853.60 - 859.12] carb diets long-term water fasting
[856.56 - 862.64] long-term juice fasting extreme
[859.12 - 865.88] exercising Hot Yoga recreational drugs
[862.64 - 868.64] psychedelics drinking alcohol laying in
[865.88 - 871.16] the hot sun for hours and hours watching
[868.64 - 872.92] intense triggering movies and the list
[871.16 - 875.12] goes on and it's not about judging
[872.92 - 876.84] anybody that's not it at all people can
[875.12 - 879.48] do what they want they can do what they
[876.84 - 882.64] like to do remember it's whatever floats
[879.48 - 885.16] your boat because one day if you hit the
[882.64 - 887.36] wall if something happens it's good to
[885.16 - 889.04] know you can do something about it it's
[887.36 - 890.72] good to have the knowledge in case
[889.04 - 893.12] there's something that you're doing that
[890.72 - 894.52] could be backed off a bit or something
[893.12 - 896.44] you could do that could really help you
[894.52 - 899.08] through it to realize hey my adrenals
[896.44 - 900.92] might be wasted here for example a lot a
[899.08 - 903.16] lot of people with adrenal fatigue right
[900.92 - 905.20] now are doing cold plunging and what's
[903.16 - 906.84] happening is they're feeling like woo
[905.20 - 908.48] something was refreshed in them
[906.84 - 910.40] something happened and they feel good
[908.48 - 911.68] for the moment when they come out but
[910.40 - 914.32] what's happening is they're on an
[911.68 - 916.80] adrenaline High what this means is when
[914.32 - 919.20] you dipping into that cold Icy water
[916.80 - 921.04] your body started to fight for its life
[919.20 - 922.60] because of the temperature dropping and
[921.04 - 924.24] your adrenals released a lot of
[922.60 - 926.68] adrenaline because it was fight or
[924.24 - 928.44] flight your adrenals are releasing that
[926.68 - 930.32] adrenaline to keep your temperature up
[928.44 - 932.72] your core temperature up because you're
[930.32 - 934.44] making your core temperature colder what
[932.72 - 936.36] do you think happened when the Titanic
[934.44 - 939.12] was going down and everybody was
[936.36 - 941.08] floating around in that icy cold water
[939.12 - 943.24] they were freezing to death within
[941.08 - 945.48] minutes now of course they didn't have
[943.24 - 948.12] the option to get out of the water and
[945.48 - 950.16] say hey our cold plunge is done but a
[948.12 - 951.64] lot of people now are in competitions
[950.16 - 953.44] and they're trying to stay in there as
[951.64 - 955.68] long as they can and they're putting
[953.44 - 957.84] their bodies into severe crisis which
[955.68 - 960.76] means they're putting their adrenals
[957.84 - 962.64] into severe crisis is it can become an
[960.76 - 964.92] addiction you're getting an adrenaline
[962.64 - 966.24] High the irony nobody knows they're
[964.92 - 968.28] getting an adrenaline High when they're
[966.24 - 970.36] doing cold plunging they have no idea
[968.28 - 972.20] that that's actually what's happening
[970.36 - 973.96] but a year down the road or two years
[972.20 - 976.16] down the road when your adrenals decide
[973.96 - 977.64] to say see you and you're hitting the
[976.16 - 979.48] wall and you don't know why you can't
[977.64 - 981.24] even take 10 steps you're going to be
[979.48 - 982.96] like what happened what was it you're
[981.24 - 984.72] never going to blame the Cal plunging
[982.96 - 987.12] ever but you'll blame that piece of
[984.72 - 989.28] spinach you ate one day and if you're a
[987.12 - 992.28] woman and you had a really difficult
[989.28 - 994.60] childbirth really incredibly difficult
[992.28 - 996.60] childbirth and you don't know why and
[994.60 - 999.24] you don't know why you're so exhausted
[996.60 - 1001.48] afterwards where for months you just
[999.24 - 1003.08] can't get back to where you were you
[1001.48 - 1004.40] won't blame it on all the cold plunging
[1003.08 - 1005.92] you were taught to do for the last
[1004.40 - 1008.60] couple years you'll blame it on
[1005.92 - 1011.00] something entirely different one thing
[1008.60 - 1014.80] that chips away at our adrenal glands
[1011.00 - 1018.00] over time is high fat diets the more fat
[1014.80 - 1020.64] we eat the more overt fat we eat the
[1018.00 - 1023.72] more adrenaline is released the more
[1020.64 - 1026.68] fats we gobble down and eat in our meals
[1023.72 - 1029.44] the more adrenaline's getting into our
[1026.68 - 1031.40] bloodstream and released this is why
[1029.44 - 1034.60] when someone goes lowfat for a little
[1031.40 - 1036.36] while a healthy lowfat regimen of some
[1034.60 - 1038.24] kind they start rebuilding their
[1036.36 - 1041.16] adrenals they start getting stronger
[1038.24 - 1044.48] over time they start getting replenished
[1041.16 - 1046.24] and then they go and eat a lot of fat
[1044.48 - 1049.04] like whatever diet they choose whether
[1046.24 - 1051.40] it's animal protein or it's plant-based
[1049.04 - 1053.08] fat and they end up gobbling down a lot
[1051.40 - 1055.56] of fat and they get this euphoric
[1053.08 - 1057.80] feeling like whoa like a rush they feel
[1055.56 - 1059.72] this energy they feel this Surge and
[1057.80 - 1063.36] what they don't realize is they just
[1059.72 - 1066.52] felt their adrenal glands go explode of
[1063.36 - 1068.08] adrenaline to try to help save them from
[1066.52 - 1069.96] the amount of fat that's floating in
[1068.08 - 1072.20] their bloodstream so they don't have a
[1069.96 - 1074.72] heart attack or interrupt the brain
[1072.20 - 1077.08] chemistry at all they're feeling that
[1074.72 - 1079.48] strength that Euphoria they're feeling
[1077.08 - 1083.64] that adrenaline surge because their
[1079.48 - 1085.44] adrenals over time restored it restored
[1083.64 - 1088.20] and then now the adrenaline's being
[1085.44 - 1089.64] released a lot of it the reason why
[1088.20 - 1091.32] adrenaline's released into the
[1089.64 - 1093.60] bloodstream when you're on a high fat
[1091.32 - 1095.72] diet or eating High fats all the time
[1093.60 - 1099.32] it's to thin out the blood it's to
[1095.72 - 1101.84] protect the heart and before that person
[1099.32 - 1103.96] did a lowfat healthy regimen of some
[1101.84 - 1106.32] kind there were dog in it they didn't
[1103.96 - 1108.96] feel good they felt sick all the time
[1106.32 - 1110.44] they felt weak they had low energy they
[1108.96 - 1112.72] were struggling with some kind of
[1110.44 - 1114.80] condition and then they were slowly
[1112.72 - 1116.76] rebuilding back their adrenal glands
[1114.80 - 1119.08] getting them stronger so then when they
[1116.76 - 1121.44] finally did that pizza whether it was a
[1119.08 - 1123.92] vegan pizza or some other kind of pizza
[1121.44 - 1126.44] that was loaded with just fat all in and
[1123.92 - 1128.32] on top of it they were like wow I can't
[1126.44 - 1131.24] believe how good I feel eating these
[1128.32 - 1133.92] three slices of pizza I feel good I feel
[1131.24 - 1136.16] strong I feel euphoric what am I doing I
[1133.92 - 1137.96] don't have to eat that lowfat anymore I
[1136.16 - 1140.28] don't have to do this or that or try to
[1137.96 - 1142.60] be healthy I could just go back to this
[1140.28 - 1144.76] I was restricted I guess now I can eat
[1142.60 - 1146.44] what I want and they take it for granted
[1144.76 - 1148.56] they don't know they just restored their
[1146.44 - 1151.48] adrenal glands all those weeks or all
[1148.56 - 1153.52] those months and then over time they'll
[1151.48 - 1155.52] decline their adrenals will decline
[1153.52 - 1157.32] again they'll start losing adrenaline
[1155.52 - 1159.24] reserves their adrenals will start
[1157.32 - 1161.48] losing strength they'll just be eating
[1159.24 - 1163.08] anything they want for quite some time
[1161.48 - 1165.04] and then when they're hitting the wall
[1163.08 - 1167.60] are starting to drag again whether it's
[1165.04 - 1169.48] 2 years later one year later 3 years
[1167.60 - 1171.16] later they're going to be like oh no I
[1169.48 - 1173.00] have to do something for myself and they
[1171.16 - 1175.92] won't even realize what restored their
[1173.00 - 1178.60] adrenals to begin with excessive
[1175.92 - 1181.20] high-fat diets whether it's plant-based
[1178.60 - 1183.84] high-fat diets animal protein high-fat
[1181.20 - 1186.68] diets will eventually weaken the adrenal
[1183.84 - 1188.96] glands so many people walk around with
[1186.68 - 1191.36] undiagnosed adrenal problems and
[1188.96 - 1194.60] undiagnosed adrenal fatigue and their
[1191.36 - 1196.88] symptoms getting shakes and Tremors or
[1194.60 - 1199.64] their symptoms of feeling very weak at
[1196.88 - 1202.40] different times of day or brain fog will
[1199.64 - 1204.60] be blamed on blood sugar problems
[1202.40 - 1208.16] meanwhile if somebody has blood sugar
[1204.60 - 1211.04] problems their hypoglycemic hypoglycemic
[1208.16 - 1213.80] or any kind of diabetes situation
[1211.04 - 1217.40] pre-diabetic and they have adrenal
[1213.80 - 1219.76] fatigue both those problems can meld
[1217.40 - 1222.20] together causing a lot of confusion and
[1219.76 - 1224.24] causing a bigger problem if somebody's
[1222.20 - 1226.72] pre-diabetic or they got blood sugar
[1224.24 - 1229.64] issues or they're hypoglycemic it's
[1226.72 - 1231.64] critical to keep strong a adrenals it's
[1229.64 - 1233.56] critical to make sure they restore and
[1231.64 - 1235.92] replenish their adrenals and protect
[1233.56 - 1238.28] them because if they don't protect their
[1235.92 - 1240.40] adrenals and they don't keep them safe
[1238.28 - 1241.76] and strong and build up that adrenaline
[1240.40 - 1243.56] Reserve then they're going to be
[1241.76 - 1246.08] confused all the time they're going to
[1243.56 - 1248.16] not know what's causing what and what is
[1246.08 - 1251.28] this and what is that they just won't
[1248.16 - 1254.36] know the brain and body needs blood
[1251.28 - 1257.20] sugar glucose that's how we function we
[1254.36 - 1260.08] run on sugar without it the brain starts
[1257.20 - 1263.52] to die and we can't can't do anything we
[1260.08 - 1265.88] can't function we can't live sugar is
[1263.52 - 1268.60] what makes the world go around but if we
[1265.88 - 1271.24] lose our sugar or glucose if we go
[1268.60 - 1273.32] glucose deficient in the bloodstream
[1271.24 - 1275.68] guess what takes over
[1273.32 - 1278.36] adrenaline people who are intermittent
[1275.68 - 1280.88] fasting or on low low carb diets they're
[1278.36 - 1283.24] not getting enough sugar enough glucose
[1280.88 - 1287.20] to their brain to their body what do
[1283.24 - 1288.84] they do they exist on caffeine they rely
[1287.20 - 1291.00] on caffeine in all kinds of different
[1288.84 - 1292.64] forms to get them through the day while
[1291.00 - 1295.32] they're not eating while they're not
[1292.64 - 1297.60] getting enough glucose to survive on so
[1295.32 - 1300.76] what they're doing is they are taking
[1297.60 - 1303.68] from Peter to pay Paul they are actually
[1300.76 - 1305.40] using their own adrenaline to compensate
[1303.68 - 1308.24] for the lack of sugar the lack of
[1305.40 - 1310.24] glucose they're stealing adrenaline from
[1308.24 - 1312.40] their adrenals that should have never
[1310.24 - 1314.68] been released that should stay in those
[1312.40 - 1317.16] adrenals to keep those adrenals strong
[1314.68 - 1319.08] they're stealing that adrenaline to
[1317.16 - 1321.28] actually work with whatever thing
[1319.08 - 1324.24] they're doing that means not eating
[1321.28 - 1327.00] enough food enough glucose to get by
[1324.24 - 1329.16] instead they're relying on caffeine to
[1327.00 - 1331.08] shoot those adrenals to blow out that
[1329.16 - 1333.64] adrenaline so they can function do their
[1331.08 - 1335.40] appointments and live their life and why
[1333.64 - 1337.24] are they low carb or why are they
[1335.40 - 1339.40] intermittent fasting because the
[1337.24 - 1341.44] high-fat diet didn't work for them to
[1339.40 - 1343.32] begin with so they're cutting their
[1341.44 - 1345.52] high-fat diet that never worked they're
[1343.32 - 1347.20] cutting it in half or cutting it down to
[1345.52 - 1348.76] just a quarter they're starving
[1347.20 - 1350.72] themselves for most of the day and still
[1348.76 - 1353.48] doing their high-fat diet but only doing
[1350.72 - 1355.76] it partially versus doing it every day
[1353.48 - 1358.68] all day and they're relying on the
[1355.76 - 1362.80] caffeine to get them by to do it and
[1358.68 - 1366.24] guess who pays the price your adrenals
[1362.80 - 1368.36] their adrenals everybody's adrenals our
[1366.24 - 1371.52] adrenals need a lot of things to
[1368.36 - 1373.68] preserve to restore to replenish a
[1371.52 - 1377.88] couple of things that are adrenals need
[1373.68 - 1380.32] is glucose sodium and potassium
[1377.88 - 1382.16] electrolyte and glucose if you don't
[1380.32 - 1384.80] have the glucose and electrolytes in
[1382.16 - 1386.64] your bloodstream floating around in your
[1384.80 - 1387.88] brain then your adrenals are going to
[1386.64 - 1391.16] know about it and they're going to
[1387.88 - 1393.48] release adrenaline to compensate and the
[1391.16 - 1395.76] more adrenaline released the more
[1393.48 - 1397.68] problems we get down the road so we're
[1395.76 - 1399.72] not freed just because we're doing
[1397.68 - 1401.64] intermittent fasting for years or we're
[1399.72 - 1403.60] doing cold plunging for years and we're
[1401.64 - 1406.48] going to just be healthy great have
[1403.60 - 1409.28] longevity and live forever instead we're
[1406.48 - 1412.04] going to have long-term a adrenal and
[1409.28 - 1414.04] adrenaline damage that means adrenaline
[1412.04 - 1417.04] going into the brain and burning out
[1414.04 - 1419.20] neurotransmitter chemicals over time so
[1417.04 - 1420.92] all the different adrenaline addictions
[1419.20 - 1424.64] many of them we've already mentioned in
[1420.92 - 1426.72] this episode over time push the adrenals
[1424.64 - 1429.24] over the edge releasing lots of
[1426.72 - 1431.12] adrenaline and that adrenaline floating
[1429.24 - 1433.20] through the body and the Brain burning
[1431.12 - 1436.24] out neurotransmitter chemicals burning
[1433.20 - 1439.16] out neurons weakening the nerve sheath
[1436.24 - 1441.08] of all the central nervous system and
[1439.16 - 1443.76] creating a problem with cranial nerves
[1441.08 - 1446.56] and the Vegas nerves upping anxiety as
[1443.76 - 1448.48] the years go by creating issues all
[1446.56 - 1450.72] throughout the body including the liver
[1448.48 - 1452.92] and even the stomach glands inside the
[1450.72 - 1455.84] stomach that creates your gastric acid
[1452.92 - 1458.04] your hydrochloric acid adrenaline
[1455.84 - 1461.04] addictions weaken the central nervous
[1458.04 - 1463.84] system bringing people to new types of
[1461.04 - 1465.56] symptoms in their lives new confusion
[1463.84 - 1467.12] they get lost they don't know why
[1465.56 - 1468.88] they're sick they don't know what's
[1467.12 - 1472.60] wrong and
[1468.88 - 1475.16] long-term adrenaline wastage was behind
[1472.60 - 1478.92] a part of it so let's talk a little bit
[1475.16 - 1481.72] about restoring your adrenals sleep does
[1478.92 - 1483.80] help to restore adrenals but a lot of
[1481.72 - 1486.48] people that are under stress they're
[1483.80 - 1488.84] under termoil they're under challenges
[1486.48 - 1491.88] can't sleep good so it's kind of not
[1488.84 - 1494.48] fair to them sleeping would help their
[1491.88 - 1497.48] adrenals would help them fend off what
[1494.48 - 1499.72] they're up against help protect them but
[1497.48 - 1501.88] they can't sleep because of the stress
[1499.72 - 1505.24] and challenges so one thing that can
[1501.88 - 1507.36] help restore adrenals is resting doesn't
[1505.24 - 1509.56] mean you're sleeping it could just mean
[1507.36 - 1511.64] you're resting you're laying there with
[1509.56 - 1514.80] your eyes closed even if it's for 10
[1511.64 - 1517.20] minutes every hour or 10 minutes in the
[1514.80 - 1520.12] afternoon or 15 minutes at the end of
[1517.20 - 1524.04] the day or midm morning just laying
[1520.12 - 1527.04] there resting the nerves also rests the
[1524.04 - 1529.24] adrenals and helps to restore them
[1527.04 - 1531.96] another way to help restore the adrenals
[1529.24 - 1534.64] is lowering your overt fats so if you're
[1531.96 - 1536.64] an animal protein person find a way to
[1534.64 - 1538.72] lower some of your fats it could be
[1536.64 - 1540.60] lowering animal protein a little bit or
[1538.72 - 1543.00] lowering plant fats that you're also
[1540.60 - 1545.92] eating at the same time lowering your
[1543.00 - 1548.28] nuts and seeds lowering your oils
[1545.92 - 1550.68] lowering your animal protein bringing
[1548.28 - 1554.04] your fat down same thing if you're
[1550.68 - 1556.36] plant-based or vegan lowering your oils
[1554.04 - 1558.96] your plant-based oils lowering your nuts
[1556.36 - 1561.12] and seeds lowering your avoc
[1558.96 - 1563.60] bringing it down a little bit Bringing
[1561.12 - 1566.60] Down the overt fats helps to restore the
[1563.60 - 1569.40] adrenal glands another way to actually
[1566.60 - 1572.68] restore your adrenals is having adrenal
[1569.40 - 1575.04] snacks medical medium adrenal snacks
[1572.68 - 1577.48] they have a balance of glucose sodium
[1575.04 - 1579.56] and pottassium those three things are
[1577.48 - 1581.68] critical to protect your adrenals and

[1589.36 - 1593.24] they're having all this adrenaline
[1591.32 - 1595.28] floating through the bloodstream instead
[1593.24 - 1596.60] of having glucose sodium and pottassium
[1595.28 - 1599.00] floating in their
[1596.60 - 1601.20] bloodstream another powerful tool that
[1599.00 - 1604.04] helps restore adrenal glands is celery
[1601.20 - 1606.72] juice every single day having celery
[1604.04 - 1609.08] juice try to have it on an empty stomach
[1606.72 - 1611.68] try to have it a half an hour away from
[1609.08 - 1613.96] food having celery juice every single
[1611.68 - 1617.08] morning on an empty stomach is really
[1613.96 - 1619.08] helpful to help restore adrenal glands
