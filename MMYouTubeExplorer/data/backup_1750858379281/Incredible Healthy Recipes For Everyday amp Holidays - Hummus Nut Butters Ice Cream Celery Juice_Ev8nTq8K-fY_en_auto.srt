the sheath of the garlic and now I'm

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,880
just chopping it up a little bit because

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,720
hummus first

37
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,760
now if you're wondering what other

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,939
hummus is I'm making I'm making a lentil

39
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,380
hummus I'm going to be making

40
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,920
cannellini bean hummus I'm going to make

41
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,680
a black bean hummus too so it's going to

42
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,600
be incredible so let's get going

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,420
so much to show you guys so much going

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,860
on here so I'm gonna move these check

45
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,720
that out right there so I want to see if

46
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,420
you can see that pretty clear

47
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,220
these are the garbanzo beans right there

48
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,600
now I don't like store-bought hummus I

49
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,340
was talking about that earlier I could

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,780
talk about that later too store-bought

51
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,400
hummus will have natural flavors in

52
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,259
there which is toxic it'll have citric

53
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,640
acid in there which is toxic they don't

54
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,640
have nutritional yeast in there which is

55
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,520
toxic so this is really healthy healthy

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,579
hummus and this is the hummus that I

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
make for friends and family and anyone

58
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,420
that's coming over or something or for

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
holidays which is exciting too so we

60
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:08,280
move that over

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,619
and I'm gonna get the mm 1500 over here

62
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,080
now so many so many of you guys have the

63
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,640
mm1500 you probably already make your

64
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,780
own hummus

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,959
so

66
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,780
I'm doing that here excited

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,140
so I'm going to start out with firing it

68
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,020
up let's make the garbanzo bean hummus

69
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,300
right off the running

70
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,280
this is awesome that's all I could say

71
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,099
so in this one it's going to be garbanzo

72
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,580
beans or chickpeas same thing

73
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:42,540
garlic lemon chili pepper flakes what

74
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,700
else cumin and sesame seeds now check

75
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,540
this out you guys I got sesame seeds

76
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,180
here

77
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,220
so I have sesame seeds right here and

78
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,959
let me get this off because this kind of

79
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,040
gets all noisy in the machine let me

80
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,220
take that out

81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,280
so the sesame seeds I put into the

82
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,080
machine instead of like see because what

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,459
happens is hummus is really fattening

84
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,220
because it'll have a lot of different

85
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,440
oil in it or fat in it there's either a

86
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,379
lot of olive oil or canola oil when you

87
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,080
buy store-bought hummus it usually has

88
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,480
the canola oil in it so that's the big

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,540
thing with that so and I don't like that

90
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,640
it'll have a blend of canola and olive

91
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,760
oil in it so when you buy store-bought

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,500
or it'll have a really low-grade tahini

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,480
so what I like to do is just get the

94
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,420
sesame seeds

95
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,980
and when you get the sesame seeds you

96
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,959
can do it that way it's so much better

97
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,340
and you put it into the machine when you

98
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,159
make your own hummus

99
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,239
that's my favorite way of doing it

100
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,239
so let's drop some

101
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,080
let's drop some beans in here some

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,739
garbanzos

103
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,739
there we go

104
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,280
I like to drop some seeds in here too

105
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,959
now take a look at this right here which

106
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,260
is really incredible we'll do a close-up

107
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,959
on here as well let me cut a lemon

108
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,299
do you see how incredible it is you can

109
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,680
make a fat-free hummus

110
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,540
with no oil no tahini no anything and

111
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,819
it's the machine makes it in a way that

112
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,160
I've never seen a blender make it

113
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,019
I've never seen anything naked it's that

114
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,019
incredible you want to even think about

115
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,120
it so I'm gonna drop some more garbanzos

116
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,699
in I'm gonna squeeze a little bit of

117
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,860
lemon juice in here too

118
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,860
I'm gonna put some more sesame seeds

119
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,040
you know when I have people over during

120
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,479
the holidays and I make it in front of

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,479
them they're like you're always like

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,580
blown away they're like medical Medium

123
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,620
you're you're at it again you know like

124
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,479
you're doing the coolest thing so I'm

125
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,800
dropping some more sesame seeds in here

126
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,560
just like this

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,479
got to think about it how they're just

128
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,660
using a little bit of sesame seeds

129
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:57,180
you're not drowning it in oil and sesame

130
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,440
oil or anything like that it's so

131
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,800
incredible when you even think about

132
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,800
that

133
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,419
so

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,840
you're watching those garbanzos come

135
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,840
right out

136
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,860
now you can actually put a little bit of

137
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,500
salt if that's what you like right let

138
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,419
me get a little bit of salt

139
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,880
if you want a little pinch of salt in

140
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,900
here too get a little pinch of salt in

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,400
there

142
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,400
add some more garbanzos

143
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,539
these recipes are incredible for every

144
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,780
day it's not just holiday this is every

145
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:43,560
day you know that's how great these are

146
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,820
for people friends family children

147
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,680
so easy

148
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,780
so you're watching

149
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,060
how the garbanzos come out of the

150
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,300
machine which is so incredible I'm gonna

151
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,979
drop a little bit more in here this

152
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm going to drop a few more sesame

153
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:02,100
seeds just think about

154
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,080
like you're just using the sesame seed

155
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,220
it's incredible a little bit more salt

156
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,220
and a little bit more lemon

157
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,039
it's amazing really it's actually

158
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,960
amazing

159
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,060
now I'm also going to add some spices

160
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,060
you can mix the spices in later

161
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,139
so I'm going to add a little bit of

162
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,819
chili pepper flakes

163
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,440
there we go

164
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,120
that's it you can make as much as you

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,580
want

166
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,120
saves you money it's less expensive than

167
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,100
buying it pre-made in the store

168
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,580
which is incredible all on its own so

169
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,580
there you go

170
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,080
no harmful additives

171
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,919
natural flavors are harmful

172
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,660
in all products

173
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,160
it's one of the greatest scams if you've

174
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,660
heard the medical medium podcast at

175
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,139
Apple podcast I talk about the natural

176
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,139
flavors

177
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,919
so there you go

178
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,919
we got some hummus

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,199
I mean you don't have to just do this

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,139
for the holidays you don't have to make

181
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:16,100
it for then you can make it for

182
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,100
at any time

183
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,979
then you just mix it you can put some

184
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,979
spices in there too

185
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,400
so what I'm going to add is a little bit

186
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,759
of chili pepper flakes right here pop a

187
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,759
few on

188
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,840
put in my hand and sprinkle a few in

189
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,479
there I like it spicy I Like It Hot I

190
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,819
don't know about you guys

191
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm adding a little bit of cumin in here

192
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,979
too

193
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,979
cracking that in here

194
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,319
and

195
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,280
so

196
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,940
I'm gonna move these out of the way a

197
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,039
little bit this is some kale it's kind

198
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,720
of in the way here

199
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,400
there we go

200
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,400
so can you guys take a look at that

201
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,319
so I'm going to mix up those spices in

202
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,319
here

203
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,240
so what's incredible is this isn't a

204
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,500
hummus that's greasy that's loaded with

205
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,840
oil

206
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,699
that's loaded with

207
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,440
a really high fat because that's what

208
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,139
the hummuses are it doesn't have

209
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,340
nutritional yeast in it which is toxic I

210
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,780
know there's many of you guys that eat

211
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,219
new nutritional yeast and you don't know

212
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,979
about the medical medium information

213
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,260
about nutritional yeast just don't judge

214
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,060
me on that right now maybe like another

215
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,640
day kind of learn about it and be like

216
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,640
okay let's look into that with mm info

217
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,260
but either way and if look I'm not

218
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,760
judging you either about if you buy a

219
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,440
hummus and it's got nutritional yeast in

220
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,899
it or it's got natural flavors and

221
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,760
citric acid fine I'm not judging you at

222
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,740
all as a bad person you're a good person

223
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,200
you're just buying a hummus that

224
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,300
you may not know but isn't good for you

225
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,880
even though you think it could be good

226
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,040
for you and that's the really kind of

227
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,839
tricky thing all about it

228
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,540
now you can put fresh herbs on your

229
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,100
hummus so I just mixed it up like this

230
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,740
just to get everything in there a little

231
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,080
bit and then there you go there it is

232
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,820
now I'm going to put it in a little bit

233
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,820
of a bowl a little Bowl here

234
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,640
let me get a spoon I'm gonna scoop it

235
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,300
out I think I'm gonna put some fresh

236
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,980
parsley on top

237
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,620
to give it like a really nice look too

238
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,040
and a little extra parsley flavor

239
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,660
Laura Atkinson asked um over there on

240
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,779
Facebook what machine are you using for

241
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,019
that I'm using the mm-1500

242
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,700
here it is it's 25 off right now the

243
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,000
link is in the description

244
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,500
and what this machine does a lot I think

245
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,060
a lot of people a lot of you guys might

246
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
have this machine and you already know

247
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,899
but what it does

248
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,620
is it makes a lot of things you make

249
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,480
salsa hummuses nut Butters nut milks ice

250
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,339
cream but

251
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,339
something that's really important too is

252
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,980
it makes green juice and it makes celery

253
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,720
juice and it saves you money because it

254
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,720
squeezes the juice out we'll get I'll

255
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,500
actually make a little juice too

256
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,500
okay

257
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,060
so I'm going to pop a little parsley on

258
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,100
here if you guys don't mind

259
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,760
let's see

260
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,760
here we are

261
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,899
let me just chop some up maybe we can

262
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,680
take a look too I'll give you a close-up

263
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,680
on that as well

264
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,000
get our camera's working

265
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,380
there we go so we got our parsley

266
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:52,339
and the parsley I'm going to sprinkle it

267
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,339
right on top of here

268
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,940
okay now this is going to go

269
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,160
right in here

270
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,760
so I want to give you a close-up on that

271
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,920
you guys so on IG can you see that and

272
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,660
then here you go how does that look you

273
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,339
guys

274
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,740
so that's the hummus right there now

275
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,420
think about how incredible that hummus

276
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,899
is

277
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,360
because one reason it doesn't have all

278
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,100
that oil in there

279
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,899
so you know you're not bogging down your

280
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,620
liver with all that oil

281
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,300
and hummuses have cheap oil in them

282
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,839
store-bought too

283
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,459
so what that means is spoiled oil right

284
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,339
Rancid

285
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:46,740
it's bulk it's for you know big

286
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,600
purchases for the company to actually

287
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,519
just put it in you know each container

288
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,019
it's just you don't like that it's not a

289
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,120
good thing this is homemade this is

290
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,260
actually clean which is really

291
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,480
incredible

292
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,180
and it doesn't get any cleaner than that

293
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,220
okay so you can buy your chickpeas

294
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,019
garbanzo beans that's a really good

295
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,060
Focus right there it's fantastic

296
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,760
and you can actually make the cleanest

297
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,579
hummus you ever want it to make and you

298
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,640
still have that Sesame behind it because

299
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:17,339
I used the sesame seed and the sesame

300
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,740
seed was pulverized in here

301
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,420
so it's not like it's whole seeds now

302
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,740
that's what's incredible about the

303
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,019
machine

304
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,360
you're actually looking at pulverized

305
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,959
sesame seeds when they went through here

306
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,360
and that's the nice subtle flavor behind

307
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,579
there that's really nice too

308
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,440
so Mega juicers.com they're having the

309
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:39,000
biggest sale of the year right now just

310
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,000
so you know it only goes for a couple

311
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,160
more days this is the mm-1500

312
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,079
stick around because your mind is going

313
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,660
to be blown when I make nut Butters

314
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,000
because my mind is always blown when I

315
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,079
make nut Butters with the mm-1500 and

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,740
I'm also going to show you how to save

317
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,860
money with juices too because food costs

318
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,899
are up the mm-1500 all it does is pay

319
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,360
for itself over and over again pays for

320
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,399
itself and pays for itself so I'm like

321
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,120
pumped up about that all right

322
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,500
let's make another hummus which would be

323
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,240
really cool

324
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,920
that's next

325
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
now you might not be making four

326
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,880
different hummuses when you make a

327
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,200
hummus you might make one that day and

328
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,600
that's the one you make so we're right

329
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,100
now we're doing more than that so we're

330
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,500
gonna have some fun we're gonna do the

331
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,380
cannellini bean hummus

332
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:31,320
so get ready

333
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,480
because that is next

334
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,120
I'm excited

335
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,380
all right so the kandellini be hummus

336
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,540
here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do

337
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,160
some fresh herbs in this one so I just

338
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,320
like the way it looks with the fresh

339
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,000
herbs of cannellini beans I'm gonna use

340
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,760
some arugula I'm gonna use some lemon

341
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,800
some parsley what else uh sesame seeds

342
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,180
again and I'm gonna use some black

343
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,399
pepper

344
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,320
and a little pinch of salt in this one

345
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,660
so let me just get the black pepper just

346
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,300
ready for a little later which is really

347
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,480
cool I got salt the black pepper right

348
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,459
there and I got my herbs so on the herb

349
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,300
front this is going to be a fresh herb

350
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:11,399
one so I'm gonna add the arugula into it

351
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,680
as I'm making it so I'm going to chop up

352
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,380
a little bit of arugula now and just get

353
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,360
ready and prep for it real quick

354
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,360
so let's do that here's arugula

355
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,660
so I'm going to chop it up

356
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,600
you can mix it into it afterwards as

357
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,399
well which I like to do but I'm going to

358
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,720
add a little bit in there

359
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,060
I'll put those stems there I want to

360
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,040
save those I don't like tossing those

361
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,579
stems they're just so good

362
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,579
right

363
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,480
okay we got arugula ready what else am I

364
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,220
going to put in there besides arugula I

365
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,980
think that's it um

366
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,480
some parsley too

367
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,920
so let me chop up a little bit more

368
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,920
parsley how about that

369
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,500
foreign

370
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:11,399
okay all right

371
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,899
I think what's happening is that Jews

372
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,360
are strong stuff out of focus a little

373
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:18,060
bit all right let's see what we got

374
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,500
let's fire this up

375
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,500
let's make another hummus

376
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,920
I'm gonna drop some cannellini beans in

377
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,920
here

378
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,300
foreign

379
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,839
I'm going to squeeze a little bit of a

380
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,120
lemon

381
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,639
on down

382
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,639

383
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,300
seeds in here too to get pulverized so

384
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm excited about

385
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,839
you need when you're making a hummus if

386
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,300
you're just using a little bit of sesame

387
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,880
seeds like how awesome is that would

388
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:04,040
even think about it and it's so great

389
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,040

391
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,779

392
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,260
I'm gonna add a little bit of arugula in

393
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,260

397
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,980

404
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,940
so we're talking about adding medicine

405
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,639
into this really I mean that's what it's

406
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,899

there we go

411
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,040
so you're talking about the medicinal

412
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,380
Factor when you're doing fresh herbs

413
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:20,760

414
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:23,959

a few more sesame seeds

417
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,320
people add even

418
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,320
a little bit of salt

419
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,260
so many of you guys like salt so I just

420
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,240

423
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,380
they want salt

424
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,080
right that's when it's like okay you got

425
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,799
it I can throw a little salt at anything

426
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,799
you guys want

427
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,940
whatever your heart desires here

428
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,400
so just putting a little bit more of the

429
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,980
cannellini Bean down in there you guys

430
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,360
this is not like cool or what I mean

431
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,500
come on

432
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,500
that's actually so cool

433
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
there you go

434
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,460
and you can make as much as you want I'm

435
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,760
just making some small bowls of it

436
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,760
there you go

437
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:30,320
I'm sure the rest of it comes out

438
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,020
okay

439
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,860
all right I'm going to add a little bit

440
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:43,140
of pepper

441
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,240
I already put the salt in so I'm gonna

442
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,460
add a little bit of pepper to this one

443
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,840
so crack a little bit of that black

444
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,580
pepper on there

445
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,299
because a lot of people love black

446
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,740
pepper in their hummus so it gives it

447
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,480
that flavor

448
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,700
we are live right now you guys this is

449
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,980
not a pre-recorded episode or

450
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,480
pre-recorded whatever we're actually

451
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,240
live right now I get tons of questions

452
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,520
about the mm 1500 regarding the mm 1500

it's 25 percent off

454
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,940

hummuses this is the cannellini bean

465
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,600
hummus

466
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,280

this is just an incredible hummus now

478
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,640
think about the medicine involved in

479
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,500
this one when you make your own hummus

480
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,799
there's a big difference you guys

481
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,960
you're putting in your fresh herbs this

482
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,360

this is your fresh herbs in here it's an

484
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,320
entirely different situation so what I'm

485
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,940
going to do is move this over

486
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,160

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,840
look right there

489
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,360

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,299
when it comes out but there it goes

554
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,980
there's the black beans

555
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:58,159
okay I'm gonna squeeze a little lemon in

556
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,159
here

557
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm gonna put a little bit of garlic in

558
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,840
this one

559
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,860
we got our garlic in there I'm gonna put

560
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,760
some sesame seeds in this one too

561
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:14,280
here we go pulverize those

562
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,320
get some more black beans it's just

563
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,320
basically doing it itself right there

564
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,440
it's all coming out

565
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,280
so this one's really spicy it's got the

566
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,539
the

567
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,820
spicy

568
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,740
hot pepper I'm putting more garlic in

569
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,360
I'm putting a little bit more lemon so

570
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,700
I'm making the black bean hummus right

571
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,440
now you guys just got here watch this

572
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,460
replay we're live right now but watch

573
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,460
the replay after

574
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,700
we're still going to make three nut

575
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,799
Butters we got a lot to do it's gonna be

576
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,539
pretty crazy here

577
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,659
so I'm just gently pushing this down

578
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:53,820
doesn't really take anything at all

579
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:56,159
letting it do its thing pop some more

580
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,200
garlic in there let me put some more

581
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,240
black beans in here too so this is our

582
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,440
third hummus the black bean hummus right

583
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,620
here

584
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,620
how do you like that or sesame seeds

585
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,559
now you can add a little salt to this

586
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,320
one if you want too you can have them

587
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,419
salt free you can you can you have your

588
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,720
own free will you can determine what you

589
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,720
want

590
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,260
foreign

591
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,280
Jan says sick machine oh no it's an

592
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,039
insane machine but you know what the

593
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,020
sickest part of this machine is

594
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,700
right it's not just the like healthy

595
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,140
hummuses and nut Butters and nut milks

596
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,000
and banana ice cream and everything else

597
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,580
and ice creams and sorbets

598
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,280
and Salsas it's not just that it makes

599
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,380
what's really sick about it

600
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,820
is that when you juice your celery and

601
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,159
your greens

602
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,080
you really do save money in a machine

603
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,780
pays for itself that's the sick part

604
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,120
about it that's like the part that just

605
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:57,780
blows me away okay I'm just telling you

606
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,520
like that's the part that blows me away

607
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,320
so I'm going to add a little bit more

608
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,820
lemon in here

609
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,559
because I want to make a little bit more

610
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,120
black bean hummus

611
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,280
and I'm going to add some more black

612
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,780
beans you guys it's 25 off the machine

613
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,220
check out the link is in the description

614
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,539
it's your biggest sale of the year and

615
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,799
it's only like on sale for two more days

616
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:20,400
squeeze a little lemon in there and a

617
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,679
little bit more garlic boom

618
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,299
it's just going through on its own I'm

619
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,880
not even pushing it through right now

620
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:28,880
just going down so

621
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:35,159
there you go amazing

622
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:37,860
insane

623
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,460
smooth

624
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,460
right

625
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,320
you can't do that in a blender by the

626
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,320
way

627
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,039
you can't you have to add like all that

628
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,500
oil in the blender you just can't put

629
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:54,299
like dry beans in there in the blender

630
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,120
and make a hummus it just doesn't happen

631
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:59,340
but

632
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,080
the blender heats up everything too it

633
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,900
just burns it all in there like the

634
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,299
friction this is different

635
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,419
this is like a cold pressed masticating

636
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:13,799
juicer but it has attachments so you can

637
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:16,140
do this which is is really a blessing

638
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,940
Mary Murphy says I have this juicer and

639
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,740
I have only used it for celery so far I

640
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,539
can't wait to experiment more and that's

641
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,279
one of the reasons why I'm doing this

642
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,980
today because I never get a chance to

643
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,120
show you guys what the mm-1500 does I'm

644
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,220
always showing you guys you know how

645
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,140
food costs are going up and produce

646
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,179
costs money and everything costs money

647
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,159
I always just worry about that all the

648
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,659
time so I'm just being real about this

649
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,100
I'm always worried about how do I get

650
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,840
people with chronic illness to save

651
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,539
money how do I get people to save money

652
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,159
and saving money it's the only juicer

653
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:46,200
that has such a compression where it

654
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,260
actually squeezes out all the juice

655
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,539
and so you buy less celery less greens

656
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,860
less things you want to juice right so

657
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,600
it saves you money and it pays for

658
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,980
itself that's that's what I'm always

659
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,500
screaming about

660
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,659
but the thing is is that when I'm always

661
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,419
doing that I don't get a chance to show

662
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:06,960
you like what it does like it is a sick

663
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:09,059
juicer like it's insane actually so I

664
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,440

665
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,880

00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:54,179
isn't Grease

712
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,220
this isn't just all that oil like I just

713
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:59,340
put sesame seeds that were pulverized in

714
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,640
here that's all it was all right so

715
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,279
there you go let's get this in a

716
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,120
new bowl

717
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,120
right here

718
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,020
we go

719
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,900
incredible

720
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,620
amazing there you go let me get get up

721
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,000
close up on that right there can you

722
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,799
guys see that

723
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,500
there it is

724
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,799
that is the black bean hummus you guys

725
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,799
see

726
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,299
get a good Focus right there I think

727
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,899
so the chili pit you can put chili

728
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:42,539
flakes on top a few just like this

729
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:44,580
just to get it to look a certain way you

730
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,440
can put a little bit more

731
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,140
um heat on top as well so I'm going to

732
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,460
drop a little bit more Chipotle

733
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,200
right there

734
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,640
if you guys can see can you eat uh

735
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,740
probably a little bit there you go nice

ingredients and spices you want to make

839
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,179
I'm showing you four different kind of

840
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:16,740
hummuses that I make I'm adding a little

841
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,720
bit more

842
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,839
here we go let's put a little bit more

843
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,020
sesame seed in here do you realize how

844
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,060
very little tahini was used with just

845
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,159
some sesame seeds I made all these

846
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,379
hummuses and that's like this saves you

847
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,960
money I can't even tell you how much

848
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:36,139
money all around to get flavorable food

849
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,480
like if anything

850
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:42,780
and I I told you guys the other day

851
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,080
the the mm-1500 900 came about because

852
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:48,720
how can I get medicine in people who are

853
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:52,740
chronically ill and save them money

854
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,980
that was all it was about is how do I

855
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:58,440
have people save money so that it pays

856
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,940
for itself because I couldn't find that

857
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,560
out there with all the juicers I would

858
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,599
purchase all these years

859
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,339
I couldn't find a juicer that paid for

860
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,760
itself it just seemed

861
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:11,339
master that was costing money and

862
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,339
people don't realize that it was like it

863
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:15,960
never paid for itself and so the mm 1500

864
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:19,680
900 was

865
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,599
designed to make it so the consumer

866
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,160
was not only getting medicine because

867
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,079
that's what I wanted I wanted medicine

868
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,020
and people the other thing I wanted it

869
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:30,900
to pay for itself

870
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:33,780
people were always saying well they have

871
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,240
problems with like resources and stuff

872
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,640
like that because they don't have any

873
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,320
money or resources and how are they

874
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,420
going to heal if they don't have things

875
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,760
a little that's what it's about it's

876
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,560
about finding other options

877
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,180
creating other options you know

878
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,339
and that's what it's really about it's

879
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:57,420
about saving money where you can

880
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:59,280
it's about saving money I mean I worked

881
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,920
with so many people for so many years

882
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,160
and

883
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,180
and it's like not everybody is Rich out

884
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,980
there

885
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,339
I know the other juicer companies think

886
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,920
that everybody's rich

887
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:17,940
but they're not not everybody's Rich out

888
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,520
there okay so how can we heal and do it

889
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,780
in a way that we can save money and

890
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,480
everything and that's what it was really

891
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,820
about it's a cold pressed masticating

892
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,099
juicer it does so many things

893
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,359
anyway

894
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:32,359
so let's actually do this now

895
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,980

943
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,780
cleaning up in front of you here and

944
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,400
we're gonna make nut Butters

945
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,220
three nut Butters

946
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,200
I got the nuts toasted

947
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:10,260
and we're ready for some roasted toasted

948
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,760
nut butter from the mm-1500

949
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,980
so let's do it I'm gonna move some stuff

950
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,760
out of the way

951
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,760
you don't mind

952
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,460
so

953
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,820
we'll do a quick little cleanup as well

954
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,820
okay

955
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,140
got a question right there difference

956
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:33,720
between a 900 and 1500 the 900

957
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,300
you can juice your celery

958
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,579
and you save money because it's pushing

959
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,440
out so much juice and the pulp's coming

960
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:42,780
out that dry bulb right that's the

961
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,920
mm-900 you can put greens you can do

962
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,660
green juices

963
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,000
you can do your celery juice

964
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,500
and that machine can take a beaten

965
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,180
that's something that people don't

966
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,740
realize

967
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,260
people who juice

968
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,440
they'll have a juicer for like five

969
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,180
years they only use it once a month

970
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,040
maybe they use it for three months in a

971
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,020
row and then never use it again

972
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,720
and so it sits there right the medical

973
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,940
medium community and like me I juice

974
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,780
every day I'll juice multiple times a

975
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,720
day

976
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:16,500
I juice every single day seven days a

977
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:21,180
week every year and so what I love about

978
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:23,520
the mm900 and 1500 the engine

979
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,540
the engine supersedes anything I've seen

980
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,820
out there

981
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,400
so it's the power of the engine and how

982
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,920
it's well built right because what

983
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,900
happens is you may get a worn out part

984
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,640
but then just what call the company get

985
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,859
a new part right you may get a worn out

986
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,420
part but the juicer has paid for itself

987
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:43,140
over and over again

988
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,480
you have saved money and saved money and

989
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,940
money can you're using the heck out of

990
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,200
your juicers you try using the heck out

991
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,540
of some of the other juicers out there

992
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,760
they break down and the whole engine

993
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:57,900
just breaks everything breaks about it

994
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,880
these are made to get the crap kicked

995
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,800
out of them they're made for juicing

996
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,200
every day every day and that's what I do

997
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,300
and they save money so the 900 is for

998
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,260
like the green juices and for the celery

999
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,520
juice

1000
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:13,920
okay which is incredible the mm-1500 I'm

1001
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,020

1002
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,280

medicalmedium.com that's what I meant

1016
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:51,480
here all right so I'm going to remove

1017
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,940
this just for easiness

1018
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,079
you can clean this really quick but I

1019
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,000
don't want to waste your time giving

1020
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,640
that a quick clean

1021
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,599
so let's make some

1022
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,599
nut Butters

1023
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,420
right here

1024
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,700
now if you guys just got on here I'm I

1025
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,560
just made four hummuses but what I'm

1026
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:16,980
gonna do too is I'm gonna make Nut

1027
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,260
Butter I'm gonna make banana ice cream

1028
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,820
and then I'm also going to make some

1029
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,820
celery juice too some green juice

1030
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,460
and I want to show you what I do with

1031
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:28,460
wheat greens because

1032
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,920
they're not Incorporated enough in

1033
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,480
people's diets I don't care how clean

1034
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,160
they eat they're not doing enough leafy

1035
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,500
greens

1036
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,500
so let's see here's a question from

1037
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,900
mocha so is the 1500 more powerful no

1038
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,420
they're just as powerful

1039
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,280
it's just that the 1500 offers all these

1040
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,800
other things like you can make the

1041
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,119
sauces the hummus is the nut Butters the

1042
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,800
nut milks

1043
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,839
you can make like all these different

1044
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,460
things to sorbets the ice creams right

1045
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:58,859
and then you can do your green juices

1046
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,359
too but the 900 you can do your green

1047
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,740
juices and your celery juice is still

1048
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:03,420
just as powerful they're powerful

1049
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,900
machines

1050
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:09,240
they're okay get ready for this

1051
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:12,599
we're gonna make the first

1052
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,859
nut butter and let's see which one we're

1053
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,200
going to start with right here we're

1054
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:18,720
going to start with

1055
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,800
cashew butter take a look at the cashews

1056
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,800
let's get a quick look on that

1057
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:26,760
I just toasted these can you take a look

1058
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,099
at them

1059
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,140
so these are toasted

1060
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:34,020
you can kind of see it too

1061
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,359
they're a little toasty looking

1062
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:39,560
if that actually if you know what I'm

1063
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,560
saying right okay

1064
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,319
now

1065
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,140
before we go into making this I want to

1066
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,140
show you something

1067
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:55,079
this is going to be an education for a

1068
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,180
second you guys you gotta check this out

1069
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,980
Brenda says can a normal juicer make

1070
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,540
these things no they can't a normal

1071
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,980
juicer cannot make these things it's the

1072
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,720
mm-1500

1073
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,940
and a normal juicer cannot save you

1074
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,780
money when you're juicing or save you

1075
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:12,060
money in foods this is to battle the

1076
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,240
rising food costs that were starting to

1077
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:19,380
happen in 2019.

1078
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,900
so in 2019 food costs were Rising

1079
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,160
and I was worried about people with

1080
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,400
chronic illness

1081
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,660
being able to heal themselves and save

1082
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,839
money

1083
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,880
that's how these were created

1084
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:35,339
there was a real mission

1085
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,140
and real love behind it

1086
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,420
or I would have been the juicer guy for

1087
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:41,700
the last 30 years if it was just me to

1088
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,319
be a juicer guy like hey aw is now a

1089
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,579
juicer guy I would have done that for

1090
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:45,599
the last 30 years if it was just about

1091
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,660
that

1092
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,780
but it wasn't in 2019

1093
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:53,940
the mission was oh my God

1094
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,800
food costs are going up

1095
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,480
and up and up

1096
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,700
how do we do this

1097
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,900
like how do we heal people

1098
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:05,520
and so a juicer is a medicine maker and

1099
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,440
then when it's done right like this and

1100
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,300
it's squeezing out everything including

1101
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,160
those nutrients everything gets squeezed

1102
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,560
out when you make your medicine it has

1103
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,020
to be good and it has to save you money

1104
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,859
people were struggling to buy celery

1105
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,000
because there's juicers who are wasting

1106
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:23,400
the money

1107
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,440
so people were struggling they'd have to

1108
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,480
buy so much celery

1109
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,180
but they needed the celery juice to heal

1110
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,619
their conditions and symptoms do you see

1111
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,720
the problem we had

1112
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:36,240
it was like spirit and compassion and I

1113
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,640
were like okay they need their herbal

1114
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,920
medicine which is the celery juice it's

1115
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,339
already saved so many lives out there

1116
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,260
but let's let's do something to actually

1117
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:48,720
help people because to see I saw people

1118
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,119
going into the store and buying a lot of

1119
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,680
celery and then running all that celery

1120
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,180
through all their juicers including the

1121
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,800
fancy ones that have that are out there

1122
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,140
now that you see every day right now

1123
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,119
with ads and influencers

1124
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,980
and it was just running all that through

1125
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,960
yeah they'd have some juice a pile of

1126
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,300
juice but they were spending this this

1127
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,859
much more money right and so what

1128
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,420
happened was it was like how can we do

1129
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:11,760
this how can we get medicine herbal

1130
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,640
medicine in people have them save money

1131
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,440
have the machine pay for itself and for

1132
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,079
them to heal

1133
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:22,500
and now we have the brain shot therapy

1134
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:24,660
which you need a juicer and the brain

1135
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,460
shot therapy is incredible because it's

1136
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,680
there to help people heal you know it's

1137
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,960
in the brain saver books and so you need

1138
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,359
a juicer that's saving you money and

1139
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,700
allowing you to heal yourself

1140
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,800
that was the mission

1141
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,680
it was about getting all the juice out

1142
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:43,020
of the wild foods and herbs out of the

1143
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,619
herbs so you have medicine in extraction

1144
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:49,560
so these were the medicine extractors

1145
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:51,480
and so the goal was how do we do it

1146
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,920
where it's incredible where the metal

1147
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,140
isn't touching itself I saw somebody

1148
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,119
make a comment a while back after I did

1149
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:00,240
talked about the mm-1500 and they said

1150
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,520
oh yeah you're just a Salesman

1151
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,880
and they were like yeah metal touching

1152
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,680
metal whatever oh yeah the juicers out

1153
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,540
there either have the

1154
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,160
they just get all dull where do you

1155
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,319
think all that metal goes when that

1156
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,880
centrifuge is doing this

1157
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:17,400
what do you think all the metal goes

1158
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,440
when the parts are rubbing each other it

1159
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,140
goes in you in the medical mean

1160
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,460
Community they use juicers every day to

1161
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,339
heal themselves

1162
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:29,280
so I didn't want that metal involved

1163
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:31,079
it's like there's a lot of thought that

1164
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,359
goes into all of it is what I'm saying

1165
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:36,240
but we have a lot to make right here and

1166
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:38,700
also the mm-1500 is quiet and the mm-900

1167
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,619
is quiet and they're easy to clean and

1168
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,000
and when you make sauces it's easy to

1169
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,260
clean when you make nut Butters it's

1170
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,060
easy to clean and when you make nut

1171
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,480
milks it's easy to clean like it's it's

1172
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:50,099
insane how easy to clean it is

1173
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,619
so I just want to be real with you guys

1174
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:55,740
like what is this about I could have

1175
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:58,500
started a Juicer Company 20 years ago

1176
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:00,780
and been known as the juicer guy and

1177
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,780
sold a trillion juicers in the last 20.

1178
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,359
I didn't want to do that it's specific

1179
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:09,780
it's for people who are trying to heal

1180
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:11,579
themselves who need the medicine who are

1181
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,640
chronically ill who may not have a lot

1182
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:17,220
of money they're not rich

1183
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,740
and we got to get the medicine in them

1184
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:23,160
you know and so

1185
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:25,200
and I didn't even start my own juicer

1186
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,540
so I don't have a medical medium juicer

1187
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,060
I could have started a medical medium

1188
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,280
juicer you guys do you know this

1189
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,740
where it was a instead

1190
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,079
I'm helping Omega

1191
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:39,359

they create created it in the light that

1195
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:48,119
I was hoping to help people to say bunny

1196
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,160
and everything

1197
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,500

1198
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,000
blah blah blah I want to show you

1199
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,500
something that'll blow your mind

1200
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,800
what are you looking at

1201
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,720
can anybody tell me I took the label off

1202
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,400
but it's like this with every nut bugger

1203
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,359
it's not the specific one I have right

1204
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,040
here

1205
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,599
but you see

1206
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,099
the label off I'll get a close-up on

1207
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,960
this right

1208
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:10,920
see the label off but what do you see

1209
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,260
now

1210
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,819
you see oil sitting at the top so let's

1211
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,079
get a close-up of that do you know what

1212
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:17,819

see

1215
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,160
now your yours may not look like that

1216
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:27,240
yet because it didn't sit long enough

1217
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:30,000
because it was still mixed the oil

1218
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,220
and the nuts or seeds were still mixed

1219
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,339
but this is what happens if you let it

1220
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,960
sit for a long time it'll show you the

1221
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:39,900
scam

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,220

00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:48,119
if you want to be educated about this

1225
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:52,079

you're looking at a nut butter

happens to be almond butter

1237
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,260
you're looking at that much oil

1238
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:24,119
that's oil

1239
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:27,560
is not from those nuts

1240
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:27,560
did you guys hear me

1241
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,359
welcome to the world of screw everybody

1242
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,359
over

1243
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,060
this is why I will only make my own nut

1244
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,060
butter

1245
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:42,060
right there

1246
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,619
and if you can't make your own nut

1247
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,240
butter then I'll recommend the best Nut

1248
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:48,859
Butter I possibly can or whatever out

1249
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,859
there I'll try to recommend something

1250
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,480
says OMG what

1251
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,280
I'm trying to tell you guys something

1252
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,839
we're gonna make three nut Butters I

1253
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,460
have toasted roasted nuts we're gonna

1254
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,339
make three nut Butters

1255
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,500
Kim Marietta says you're saying the oil

1256
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:08,280
is not from

1257
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:11,000
the nut in the jar correct

1258
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,000
correct

1259
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,940
The Nut Butter companies and the seed

1260
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,200
butter companies and the peanut butter

1261
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:22,819
companies

1262
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,819
mix in an oil

1263
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:28,260
and then if it's freshly mixed in they

1264
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,720
just did it and they got on the Shelf

1265
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:34,520
you won't see it do this yet

1266
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,520
but it's still all the same

1267
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,079
so the question is right there I see a

1268
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:42,540
question down there the question is what

1269
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,280
kind Alexis says what kind of oil are

1270
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:49,500
they adding

1271
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:51,480
they are adding a bulk rendition of the

1272
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,880
same oil you ready

1273
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,619
they did the almonds but the oil they're

1274
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,140
adding is not from those almonds it's

1275
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:00,359
from other almonds from some other part

1276
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:02,940
of the world that they had to purchase

1277
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:05,700
in bulk

1278
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:08,040
a lesser even quality

1279
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:12,260
that could even be rancid and then they

1280
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,260
put it into the mix

1281
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:20,160
and spirit of compassion says it's time

1282
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,540

Butter looks like

1285
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,660
without adding oil to it so if you're

1287
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:32,819

they add the oil oh oh I forgot I forgot

1294
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,920
they had the oil because they can use

1295
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:51,660
less nuts

1296
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,300

do suckers is we're going to just give

1305
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,460
you less almonds jack up the price and

1306
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:18,240
add a whole bunch of oil in there that's

1307
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:21,660
cheaper they buy the oil cheaper

1308
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,940
in bulk and then they can supplement the

1309
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,579
oil into all of the nut and Seed Butters

1310
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,760
all the companies and then you get less

1311
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:31,800
almonds and less nuts you guys

1312
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,599
the vegans don't know this the vegan

1313
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,880
doctors don't know this

1314
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,920
the vegan experts don't know this the

1315
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,780
vegan authorities don't know this the

1316
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,059
keto authorities don't know this the

1317
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,980
keto trainers don't know this none of

1318
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:47,099
them know this another original and

1319
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:49,920
unique piece of information which also

1320
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:53,400
gets me in trouble because when I go and

1321
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:56,280
do this stuff and say this stuff

1322
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:59,280
I get a whole bunch of for it

1323
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:02,220
and so but I always say this

1324
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,260
you tell The Chronic Leo the truth it

1325
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:05,099
outweighs the big kick in the ass that

1326
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,960
you get

1327
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:08,460
you know like you got to tell them the

1328
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,380
truth because you have to get them

1329
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,579
better you have they have to know how it

1330
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,440
works in the world

1331
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:14,880
and then you can take the kick you know

1332
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,920
the kick and the stab in the back and

1333
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,960
the kick in the butt

1334
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,960
anyway let's go let's do it

00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,359

do you guys see that right there

1397
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,800

1399
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:04,260
guess what's missing

1400
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,660
you know what's missing

1401
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:08,819
all that oil they add

1402
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,920
they take away your nuts they charge you

1403
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:12,960
a ton of money then I tell you the

1404
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,059
mm-1500 saves you money I'm not kidding

1405
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,740
and they add all that rancid oil that

1406
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:18,839
comes from a cashew that's an entirely

1407
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,460
different place in the world

1408
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:22,980
it's bulk

1409
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:24,720
it's low quality

1410
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,160
I am Christina says does the oil

1411
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,140
separation still occur when you make

1412
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,720
your own no it doesn't

1413
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:33,359
because the oil separation isn't the oil

1414
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,180
from the original nuts

1415
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:38,700

is it's real Nut Butter that's the

1478
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,799

1498
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:47,520
before you it actually settles to the

1499
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:51,000
top is not going to be in here this is

I told you watch this from the beginning

1502
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,599
on how it works with all the nut Butters

1503
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,220
and Seed Butters out there I don't have

1504
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:02,520
time to probably go over it all over

1505
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:05,520
again but let's do some more

1506
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:07,619

Walnut butter and I can't wait I have my

1510
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:18,740
toasted walnuts you could do raw walnuts

1511
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,740
that's perfectly fine

1512
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,799
there's nothing wrong with that at all

1513
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:28,700

1514
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:28,700

01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:43,920
I knew when

1520
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:48,480
when these machines

1521
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,160
were done and I knew like when you save

1522
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,559
people money and you give them something

1523
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,200
like would you give them options for

1524
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:58,400
Pure Food it just it feels really good

1525
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,400

1533
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,160
oil they add into the jar that doesn't

1534
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,260
belong to those walnuts

1535
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:31,090
keep that in mind

1536
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:32,819

choose which one you like

1540
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,339
here's a question from Leah Leah I'm

1541
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,599
never buying nut Butters again Dan

1542
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:47,599

1543
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:52,220
okay

1544
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,480
Robin Hansen says does it need to be

1545
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:59,040
refrigerated is it soft spread yes you

1546
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,920
can refrigerate it

1547
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:04,559
now when it's cold it doesn't spread so

1548
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,480
easy right when it's out of the

1549
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,980
refrigerator just leave it out overnight

1550
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,980
it'll spread much easier

1551
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,940

01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,940

without all that oil rancid oil they put

1558
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,040
into every single Nut Butter it's a

1559
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,079
major scam going on with the nut Butters

1560
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,540
out there and Seed Butters I don't care

1561

what company I'm just saying this is

1562
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,960

cares about what you put inside your

1564
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,040
body because that's really what it comes

1565
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,780
down to too it's like you need to know

1566
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,760
what's up you're going to put stuff in

01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:42,480
juicing and not even know and you're

1632
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:45,119
saving money because it saves you money

1633
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,920
instead of the other juicers don't I'm

1634
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,020
not trying to harp on the other juicers

1635
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,839
it's just that the other juicers and

1636
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:54,180
influencers with the other juicers are

1637
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:56,280
trying to basically get into the medical

1638
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:58,079
medium community and they're just trying

1639
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,280
to sell these other juicers and then

1640
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,440
everybody

1641
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,720
spends all this money

1642
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,059
on not only the juicer but all the

1643
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:09,180
produce and everything and it's going to

1644
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:11,880
be one costly Venture the idea is to

1645
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:13,319
save money and that's what these do I

1646
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,020
will repeat things for new people

1647
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:18,119
because I'm I'm trying to be

1648
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:19,799
patient and I want people to actually

1649
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:22,079
have that opportunity so new people

1650
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:24,599
coming here if you notice

1651
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,619
some people will say how come he repeats

1652
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:27,660
himself

1653
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:30,059
well I repeat myself because new people

1654
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:31,740
come in here and they don't know what's

1655
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:34,079
going on and they have questions and I

1656
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:35,160
want to be nice and answer them okay you

1657
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:38,839
guys

1658
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,839
let's make another nut butter

1659
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,359
It's Not Butter on the list

1660
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,559
no

1661
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,460
I got some almonds here they're roasty

1662
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:56,220
they're toasty they're ready to go we're

1663
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:57,420
making our third Nut Butter I'm excited

1664
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:00,539
about that

1665
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:02,520
before I click on the machine though

1666
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:05,400
um so yeah you guys

1667
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:08,160
Walnut Butter sounds lovely Ruth said

1668
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,020
incredible we're always live these are

1669
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:12,359
not pre-recorded and people come on

1670
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:15,900
asking questions and that's why I repeat

1671
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:18,779
myself and so then I'm guilty of the

1672
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:21,299
crime of repeating myself and then

1673
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:24,179
you'll hear in reviews and comments how

1674
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:28,140
he always repeats himself it's like dude

1675
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:29,460
99 of my stuff is live and people are

1676
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,960
coming on and I'm just trying to be

1677
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:33,779
helpful

1678
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,120
I want to be helpful to new people

1679
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:37,620
and um and I know that some people are

1680
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,239
very disrespectful when they say he's

1681
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,739
repeating himself you shouldn't watch

1682
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:43,199
them it's like dude don't be

1683
01:08:40,739 --> 01:08:45,179
disrespectful to people that are sick

1684
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:49,739
and that are chronically ill and they

1685
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:49,739
want help and questions answered right

1686
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:00,420
doing the best we can now almonds

1687
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,799
roasted almonds really tough so what

1688
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,420
you'll notice if you throw in a whole

1689
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:06,000
bunch at the same time

1690
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:07,560
you could get like a jam and what you do

1691
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,819
is you do the reverse on there and there

1692
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,799
you go

1693
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:13,679
I want to show you guys

1694
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:15,719
every time I do the almonds

1695
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,239
can you put too many at once so just

1696
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:22,699
give it a second here

1697
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:22,699
all right here we go

1698
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:25,580
hold on

1699
01:09:27,299 --> 01:09:33,239
raw almonds will never do that but

1700
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:35,339
you're all set

1701
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:37,859
when you do almonds though in here right

1702
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:41,219
don't drop a whole ton down like I just

1703
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:45,239
did do it this way

1704
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:49,380
feed them in slower because roasted

1705
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:51,719
toasted almonds are so tough

1706
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:53,100
you have to actually you know work with

1707
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:54,540
it a little more finesse look at this I

1708
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:57,380
want to show you something guys

1709
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,380
this is just incredible

1710
01:09:58,739 --> 01:10:04,880
now I love making roasted almond butter

1711
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:04,880
with this machine

1712
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,040

1713
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,340
this is pure almond butter coming out

1714
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:15,960
right here Cold Light spring I've

1715
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:18,480
noticed the people who always criticize

1716
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,860
They Don't Really follow mm correct they

1717
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,020
don't know the books they don't have the

1718
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:24,780
brain saver books or any books

1719
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:26,820
guys take a close-up on this I mean see

1720
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:29,400
a close-up on this you guys look what do

1721
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:31,980
you think that's straight roasted almond

1722
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,840
butter the pure stuff it's coming right

1723
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:36,679
through see if I can get a little bit of

1724
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,679
a focus on there

1725
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:43,320
there you go look at that incredible

1726
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:45,960
Wendy says your patience is incredible

1727
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:49,100
that's how we learn we need to hear it

1728
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,100
more times thank you aw

01:10:49,739 --> 01:10:52,280
you're welcome

1730
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,480
someone said what kind of cracker check

1731
01:10:55,980 --> 01:11:00,000
out medicalmeem.com look at the

1732
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:04,199
directory and you can find like a

1733
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,600
cracker or anything else you need

1734
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:09,120
so what I'm doing here is

1735
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,540
you can see you've got to feed the

1736
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:14,159
almonds in slower when they're roasted

1737
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:17,580
almonds are really they become like rock

1738
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:18,900
hard you know how it goes with almonds

1739
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,340
and you just gotta feed them like this

1740
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,540
and take a look the almond butter is

1741
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,800
coming out

1742
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:25,640
look at that

1743
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,640
it's just amazing

1744
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,920
that's your almond butter

1745
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,500
I want to show you the difference

1746
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:38,420
between our almond butter that we're

1747
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,420
making right now and the almond butter

1748
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:43,699
you got to just drop these in like this

1749
01:11:41,219 --> 01:11:43,699
take a look

1750
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:49,260
I love the purple lights

1751
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:51,860
got some purple lights in the back yeah

1752
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,860
I love them too

1753
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,600
Loop is free with celery three through

1754
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,280
three yes I saw an article a

1755
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,260
nutritionist wrote criticizing medical

1756
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:05,159
medium and she did not even read the

1757
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:07,679
books too bad she she deters others from

1758
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:09,900
reading them too yes she does

1759
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:12,120
this is how it works right

1760
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:14,159
this is how dark this works you know in

1761
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,260
the alternative field of medicine they

1762
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:18,060
write articles when they don't even know

1763
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:20,940
anything about celery juice or medical

1764
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:22,679
medium or the books in hopes that a

1765
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:26,219
thousand people will read the article

1766
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:28,020
and never do medical needing

1767
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:29,940
that's what they do

1768
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:32,820
and it happens everywhere and then an

1769
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:34,620
influencer will do it and then a news

1770
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:36,840
station will do it and then a media

1771
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:39,000
Source will do it and then

1772
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,000
another media Source will do it and

1773
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,679
they'll do it over and over again until

1774
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:47,179
people get turned off from even thinking

1775
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,179
about using medical medium right

1776
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,820
but

1777
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:54,120
what are you gonna do

1778
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:57,719
you just put out the best books ever in

1779
01:12:54,120 --> 01:13:01,880
health and you pray that angels for some

1780
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:01,880
Divine source or God

1781
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:06,600
or a friend or anybody tell somebody

1782
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:08,280
about that opportunity

1783
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,400
Kim says hearing the crunch is

1784
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:15,199

get a focus on it

1798
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,900

like this

1803
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:13,800
and I'm going to press it down in with

1804
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:16,260
my fingers just to get the air out

1805
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,960
you can store this forever in your

1806
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:20,880
refrigerator I mean not forever but but

1807
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,500
okay try not to store it in your fridge

1808
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,239
for 10 years

1809
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:27,360
okay

1810
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:30,000

01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,780
I'm just saying like use your own

1813
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:35,219
discretion in the sense of like how long

1814
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,239
you think you can have it in your fridge

1815
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:38,699
but

1816
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:41,699
I kept mine in there for a long long

1817
01:14:38,699 --> 01:14:44,280
time do you think you'll get enough

1826
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,840
which one do you want

1827
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:13,560
do you want that one

1828
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:17,580
or do you want the store-bought one

1829
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:20,100
that adds the extra oil from almonds

1830
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:22,080
from a different place bulk

1831
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:25,199
you don't want an almond butter that has

1832
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,360
50 different almond oils

1833
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:30,060
that were stored for God knows how long

1834
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:31,940
in factories and warehouses and were

1835
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:35,460
used to actually

1836
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:37,679
fulfill a need to lessen the other stuff

1837
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:40,320
I mean it goes rancid so what you're

1838
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:42,179
looking at is rancid oil that's added to

1839
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,699
all the nut Butters and Seed Butters out

1840
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:47,239
there so personally I would like real

1841
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:47,239
nut butter

1842
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:53,540
and I would rather have that instead of

1843
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:53,540
the rancid stuff that's added

1844
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:58,920
so I got my nut Butters here I have

1845
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:02,300
three nut Butters let's do a last little

1846
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,300
work on that before we move on

1847
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,020
foreign

1848
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,330
[Applause]

1849
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,100
got him right here

1850
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,300
all right so the next thing we're doing

1851
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,739
is

1852
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:23,600
you guys don't mind if I make a little

1853
01:16:19,739 --> 01:16:23,600
celery juice I didn't have any yet today

1854
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:30,980
didn't have any celery juice yet today

1855
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,980
so

1856
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:47,880
so that's next let's make some celery

1857
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:51,000
juice I might even throw

1858
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:53,460
something else there and there

1859
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,920
okay

1860
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:57,739
this is a major project here I've got a

1861
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,480
lot going on

1862
01:16:57,739 --> 01:17:01,980
Joel says what's up Anthony signed up

1863
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:06,179

01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:12,060
Courtney M.A says aw your skin is

1867
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:15,060
okay

1868
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:20,940
Cornelia says these nut Butters could be

1869
01:17:18,659 --> 01:17:24,060
a nice Christmas gift yes indeed you can

1870
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:26,940
make them throw a lid on them

1871
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:30,360
and boom you have a nice Christmas gift

1872
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:31,980
mostly crunchy Wendy says I'm making my

1873
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:36,500
celery juice right now as well cheers

1874
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:36,500
okay are you beating me to it oh no no

1875
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:41,300
I think you're beating me to it come on

1876
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:45,780
you're making it right now

1877
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:49,040
no I have to hurry up

1878
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:49,040
let's make some celery juice

1879
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,159
I'm excited

1880
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:04,080
all right why have the mm-1500 make your

1881
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:07,140
celery juice

1882
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:10,140
because you're gonna use less celery

1883
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:13,140
this is a medicine maker this is an

1884
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:15,540
herbal it's extraction you're witnessing

1885
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:18,060
you're witnessing me making an herbal

1886
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:20,640
extraction

1887
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:23,219
what that means is

1888
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,880
celery is an herbal

1889
01:18:23,219 --> 01:18:25,880
medicine

1890
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:32,219
when you eat it you do not get enough of

1891
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:35,219
it you need the juice separated

1892
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:37,380
that's the attraction

1893
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:40,260
you have to juice it in order to get

1894
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:43,020
enough of it the medicine out of it

1895
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:44,040
so when a registered dietitian which you

1896
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,360
know there's some good registered

1897
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:48,420
dietitians out there that do medical

1898
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,739
medium protocols but when a registered

1899
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:52,380
dietitian that doesn't know medical

1900
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:55,620
medium information or the books

1901
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:58,199
does a hit piece and a media Outlet

1902
01:18:55,620 --> 01:19:00,120
allows them to do a hit piece without

1903
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:02,520
hearing my side

1904
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:05,940
or the or the stories of people who have

1905
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:07,980
feel your skin and their body and healed

1906
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:10,739
from excellent psoriasis and healed from

1907
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:13,140
lupus when they don't allow those people

1908
01:19:10,739 --> 01:19:18,000
into the article

1909
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:21,659
thank you then they're doing evil

1910
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,640
they're doing evil bidding

1911
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:25,640
they are dark

1912
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:31,920
what a media Source in alternative

1913
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:35,100
medicine chooses not to call up medical

1914
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:37,199
medium and say look I'm gonna have some

1915
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,640
registered dietitians on there to rip

1916
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,380
apart

1917
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,960
celery

1918
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:45,300
would you like to at least

1919
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,580
have it equal where you can talk about

1920
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:49,440
what it has done you know anybody who

1921
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:52,739
has healed from celery juice

1922
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:54,480
they don't do that the alternative

1923
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:57,300
source

1924
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:59,159
that posts an article

1925
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,719
They Don't Care About The Chronic Leo

1926
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:03,239
but yet they act like they do because

1927
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,820
they're an alternative like website

1928
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:08,520
putting out articles right they act like

1929
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:10,500
they care about people they don't

1930
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,540
so they have a registered dietitian or a

1931
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,340
nutritionist on there saying how

1932
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:16,140
cellular juice is worthless and science

1933
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,880
and research has not found you know

1934
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:19,560
found anything

1935
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,880
science of research hasn't even studied

1936
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:24,560
celery juice

1937
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,560
the stupidity is so great

1938
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,860
loving healing says anyone that picks up

1939
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:34,020
your books knows deep down the info in

1940
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:35,100
them is truth I think haters are afraid

1941
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,600
to read them

1942
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,960
you know that's really true and another

1943
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,340
thing too haters don't read the books

1944
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,820
poachers

1945
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,820
feel at

1946
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,800
m in the health Realm

1947
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:52,920
but yeah the haters they

1948
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,780
and they don't cite it whatever I study

1949
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:59,640
nutrition medical medium gave me answers

1950
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:59,640
nutrition couldn't that's from fsog

1951
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,199

1957
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,980
and now here's the funny thing I was

1958
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,300
going to make nut milk in this in this

1959
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,800
video this episode even though we're

live right now all right

1961
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,400
but there's so much there's so many

1962
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:31,320
things I want to show you

1963
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:33,420
live is free with celery says someone

1964
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:35,460
contacted me to ask how I got a job

1965
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:38,699
promoting you I spread your info because

1966
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:42,000
it saved my life see that's

1967
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:43,739
that's how it works it's like

1968
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,840
there's so much Darkness out there you

1969
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:49,620
guys

1970
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:52,199
if you spent the day with me

1971
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:55,219
and saw what I saw

1972
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:55,219
you wouldn't believe it

1973
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:00,179
it's like there's a hit piece on me

1974
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:02,100
every other day

1975
01:22:00,179 --> 01:22:03,179
there's hip thesis out there that I

1976
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,880
don't even see

1977
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:07,980
it's just unbelievable it's private hate

1978
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,739
groups you name it

1979
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:12,600
but I can tell you this

1980
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:14,460
um

1981
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,320
they're not used to people promoting

1982
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,120
something without getting paid

1983
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,840
that's why so they'll just say oh you

1984
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,840
must be getting paid

1985
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:27,000
so what they'll do is a media Source an

1986
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:29,340
alternative or conventional but an

1987
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,440
alternative media Source just really a

1988
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:35,159
rag of a source

1989
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:37,320
literally did an article on celery juice

1990
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:40,560
smeared my name in it

1991
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:42,000
and had some nutritionist or Rd on there

1992
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,340
saying how it's celery juice is

1993
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,920
worthless right when you think about how

1994
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,320
awful that is right and why does it

1995
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,179
bother me because someone's going to

1996
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:53,960
read that and never drink celery juice

1997
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:53,960
and never heal

1998
01:22:54,659 --> 01:23:00,360
they're never gonna heal because

1999
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:03,500
they're not going to think they should

2000
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,500
drink celery juice ever

2001
01:23:03,659 --> 01:23:07,500
so they're losing a healing tool right

2002
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,560
so that's what it comes down to they

2003
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:13,400
lose a healing tool so I'm going to grab

2004
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,400
a little glass here

2005
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:22,860
now what's really cool about the mm1500

2006
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:25,380
for so many things

2007
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:27,659
so I got some celery juice right here

[Music]

2009
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:33,920
it's a lot of celery juice okay you can

2010
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,920
do a close-up on the celery juice too

2011
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:37,460
there you go

2012
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,719
and then the pulp right here now what

2013
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:48,239
the mm-1500 does

2014
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:49,860
is it actually gives you drier pulp than

2015
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:53,340
the other juicers and what that does is

2016
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:55,260
it gives you more celery juice so that's

2017
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:56,760
where you're saving money and that's an

2018
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:58,560
incredible part about it and that's what

2019
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,060
I love we got more to do you guys so I

2020
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,980
got to make some banana ice cream am I

2021
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:04,620
going to get that ready

2022
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:07,320
Michael Moeller says Susan Craig are

2023
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:09,420
really much impressed by your

2024
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:10,620
I don't know why they gotta fly up there

2025
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:13,260
like that but

2026
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:16,380
most all Health info and people in

2027
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:18,480
health have organizations and programs

2028
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:21,000
that people pay

2029
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:23,100
into right

2030
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,840
and then it to promote things and get

2031
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,880
paid and promotion all that or affiliate

2032
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,320
programs it's not because it really

2033
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,300
works and what medical medium

2034
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,040
information is it's like people who heal

2035
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,120
and they tell somebody else or they post

2036
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,920
about it

2037
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:38,580
and it's just so heartwarming because

2038
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:40,199
it's like I'm healing or I healed and I

2039
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:42,000
want to spread the message and they're

2040
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:43,040
not used to that out there

2041
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,179
out there because

2042
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:48,780
influencers and everybody they're being

2043
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:50,520
paid to actually say this this product

2044
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,500
is this or this thing does that or this

2045
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:55,620
thing does that and so no one's used to

2046
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:57,840
a community that's out there talking

2047
01:24:55,620 --> 01:25:00,060
about how they healed

2048
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,280
and they weren't paid to do it like that

2049
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,199
doesn't exist it's Grassroots the

2050
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:06,080
medical mean communities like Grassroots

2051
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:08,520
community

2052
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:10,260
that cares about people getting answers

2053
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,560

2062
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:53,540
favorite things to make

2063
01:25:51,239 --> 01:25:53,540

frozen bananas out of the freezer if

2068
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:20,280
they're too Frozen you might want to let

2069
01:26:18,659 --> 01:26:21,420
them kind of like sit for a couple of

2070
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:23,460
minutes

2071
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:25,560
that's usually like

2072
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:27,179
you know a good option depending on how

2073
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:30,380
Frozen these are these are pretty darn

2074
01:26:27,179 --> 01:26:30,380

crack pleaser for not just holidays or

2080
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,340
in general

2081
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,620

but

2084
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:06,120

2085
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:08,659
banana ice creams it's like okay what

2086

froze these

2109
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:21,860
so they may not have been like perfectly

2110
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,860
Frozen

2111
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,580

2112
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:25,580
have much

2113
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:35,520
these were pretty ripe too whatever

2114
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:38,699

guys I forgot

2210
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:09,780
hmm

2211
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:12,020
what I love to do is to take a piece of

2212
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:12,020
kale

2213
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:16,580
I can't believe I forgot this

2214
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:23,420
I like to take a piece of kale here

2215
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,420
right and I like to put some hummus

2216
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:29,699
in the kale leaf because it's about

2217
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:31,500
getting those leafy greens that's what

2218
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:33,840
you have to think it's always about

2219
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:35,420
getting the leafy greens right

2220
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,520
so if you're going to make your hummus

2221
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:41,400
make sure you make your little hummus

2222
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:43,260
boat and you use your kale or your you

2223
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:46,760
know a mustard green or something and

2224
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:46,760
that's really important to do oh

2225
01:33:48,179 --> 01:33:51,300
watch this so

2226
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:54,320
these are mustard greens right here

2227
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:54,320
they're really spicy

2228
01:33:54,739 --> 01:33:59,219
set some mustard green I'm going to take

2229
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:01,679
two of these mustard greens like that

2230
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:05,540
put them together

2231
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:05,540
and then you can put a hummus

2232
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:10,639
put this spicy black bean one right in

2233
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,639
the mustard green

2234
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:16,280
you can also take I got some arugula in

2235
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,280
here

2236
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:20,880
so I got some arugula in here too and

2237
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,380
this is how you can do the leafy greens

2238
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,820
with your hummus you're adding in your

2239
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:24,780
arugula and you're having your mustard

2240
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:26,520
greens

2241
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:29,340

2242
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:31,440

2243
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:33,719

for family ready and then you got your

2245
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:36,600
here's the leafy green way to do things

2246
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:37,980
right

2247
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,940
and that's what I've always done if I

2248
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:42,060
was going to have hummus or anything

2249
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:43,980
like that it's not about a chip

2250
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:45,659
in hummus

2251
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:47,820
it's about how do you get your leafy

2252
01:34:45,659 --> 01:34:50,000
greens in you with almost everything you

2253
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:50,000
do

2254
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,840
it

2255
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:01,219

2256
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,219

2282
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:02,880
grounded

2283
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:04,380

01:38:55,620 --> 01:39:01,199
unusable for 10 years

2356
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:04,320
to saying

2357
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:06,239
so let's hope we can use it again

2358
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:08,880
all right because what I want to do is

2359
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:11,040
put exclusive content that I do nowhere

2360
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:13,920

of exclusive content on Twitter

2365
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:28,560
because somebody might see it again

2366
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:30,719
because my Twitter has been kind of on

2367
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,920

2368
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:34,080

your books

2411
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:12,920
remember

2412
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:12,920
take a towel

2413
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:19,199
whatever paper towel or a towel right

2414
01:41:15,739 --> 01:41:22,260
dishcloth just have it moist not soaking

2415
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:24,420
wet just a little damp if you want a

2416
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:25,739
little touch of soap or something or you

2417
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:27,540
can use a hand sanitizer or something

2418
01:41:25,739 --> 01:41:30,780
and you could just clean off your covers

2419
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:34,460
because they come dirty because of

2420
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:34,460
Amazon's conveyor belt

2421
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:39,300
the publisher ships pristine copies

2422
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:40,679
right off the press

2423
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,960
to Amazon

2424
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:45,420
and other places

2425
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,500
and then the person receives it in the

2426
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:49,080
mail

2427
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:51,239
and it's got smudge and dirt and grime

2428
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:52,980
all over it that's from the conveyor

2429
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:55,860
belts

2430
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:57,659
the grease tickier thing your little

2431
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:59,940
doll and you just wipe off you clean it

2432
01:41:57,659 --> 01:42:02,400

2433
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:04,520
it comes out great

2434
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,239
Uma pretty funny right

2435
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:07,679
foreign

2436
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:10,320
yep

2437
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:12,239
If he if he says I hope you can say

2438
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:14,760
something about exercise I used to

2439
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:17,340
exercise very vigorously 10 hours a week

2440
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:19,260
whoa now on medical medium protocols

2441
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:21,480
it's less than two hours per week yet

2442
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:23,760
I'm more lean more defined and more

2443
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:25,980
stronger because that's what happens

2444
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:27,780
medical medium information makes it and

2445
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:30,000
protocols makes it so you can actually

2446
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:32,639
become a stronger healthier person and

2447
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,440
if you wanted to exercise less you're

2448
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:36,300
welcome to do so and you'll still be

2449
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:38,699
healthier than you were before medical

2450
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:41,699
medium when you're exercising more

2451
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:43,860
that's how it works

2452
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:47,280
in a nutshell maybe I'll do a podcast

2453
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:50,040
