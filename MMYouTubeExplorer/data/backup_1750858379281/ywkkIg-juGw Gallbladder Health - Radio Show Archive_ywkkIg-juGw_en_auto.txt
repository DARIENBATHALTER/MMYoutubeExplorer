[0.80 - 10.92] [Music]
[9.04 - 15.72] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 18.28] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.72 - 19.92] medium hello I'm Anthony William you're
[18.28 - 22.16] listening to the medical medium radio
[19.92 - 24.44] show where each week I talk about the
[22.16 - 26.32] most advanced healing information and
[24.44 - 29.52] secrets about health much of which is
[26.32 - 32.56] not found anywhere else and is decades
[29.52 - 34.96] ahead of what's out there now as I've
[32.56 - 36.60] always said who has 10 or 20 years or 30
[34.96 - 38.16] years to wait for answers and I've run
[36.60 - 39.68] into a lot of people over the years that
[38.16 - 42.84] are like you know what I've had this for
[39.68 - 44.92] 20 years I've had this problem for 20
[42.84 - 46.80] years and it just didn't have any
[44.92 - 49.76] answers to know really what to do or
[46.80 - 51.88] what's going on and uh and who wants to
[49.76 - 53.56] wait that long I mean people when they
[51.88 - 55.76] get something going on I mean you know
[53.56 - 57.76] and even if it's for a week even if it's
[55.76 - 60.76] for two weeks even if it's a symptom for
[57.76 - 62.32] a month I mean whoo and and I've seen
[60.76 - 64.04] people where all of a sudden they got
[62.32 - 66.92] something going on and it's it's just
[64.04 - 68.92] like it's like hey I I can't live my
[66.92 - 72.80] life or or if they're living their life
[68.92 - 74.76] they just can't stand a symptom or some
[72.80 - 76.68] kind of condition absolutely I mean
[74.76 - 79.28] without a doubt it's it's really hard
[76.68 - 80.48] it's really hard um you know and and it
[79.28 - 83.24] makes things difficult today we're
[80.48 - 87.24] talking about the gallbladder the
[83.24 - 89.52] gallbladder wo gallbladder spasms things
[87.24 - 91.36] like that all kinds of gall stuff gall
[89.52 - 92.68] stone
[91.36 - 94.40] hey you know and maybe you don't have a
[92.68 - 96.88] gallbladder maybe your gallbladder was
[94.40 - 99.24] taken out maybe it was
[96.88 - 101.60] removed maybe it was removed you know
[99.24 - 103.16] gallbladders are funny and uh and we we
[101.60 - 104.72] need to talk about them that's the whole
[103.16 - 106.32] thing that that's what we want to do I
[104.72 - 111.08] think I think you know I should have
[106.32 - 113.52] done a gallbladder show a long time ago
[111.08 - 115.64] without a doubt I should have done one
[113.52 - 117.88] you know I talk about research and
[115.64 - 119.48] science a lot and in in the sense that
[117.88 - 121.80] you know in chronic illness I feel like
[119.48 - 123.28] it's it's fallen behind it actually was
[121.80 - 127.80] never caught up to begin with all the
[123.28 - 129.48] way from the start and and um you know
[127.80 - 131.48] and I say that a lot I say that a lot
[129.48 - 133.44] when it comes down to chronic illness
[131.48 - 136.72] but when it comes down to a good surgeon
[133.44 - 139.20] removing a gallbladder that's got
[136.72 - 142.44] infected that became
[139.20 - 146.48] infected you know or or
[142.44 - 149.96] spasming so bad and the person is just
[146.48 - 151.52] suffering and you know or or you know a
[149.96 - 152.40] gallbladder that that's basically going
[151.52 - 155.28] to
[152.40 - 157.80] rupture and hey and and we you you you
[155.28 - 160.08] find a good surgeon and that's where
[157.80 - 163.84] research and science is paid off that's
[160.08 - 165.64] where it's paid off right there and um
[163.84 - 167.84] so you know I appreciate that I
[165.64 - 169.80] appreciate that and I respect that
[167.84 - 171.92] highly respect that highly appreciate
[169.80 - 173.92] that um but when it comes down to
[171.92 - 175.44] chronic illness in general all kinds of
[173.92 - 176.72] different ways I mean you know science
[175.44 - 179.84] and research hasn't gotten there
[176.72 - 183.12] including the production of a gallstone
[179.84 - 185.88] the basic understanding is there but
[183.12 - 188.20] what's behind all that like how do we
[185.88 - 191.04] avoid that how do we stop
[188.20 - 193.24] that what's that about well that's that
[191.04 - 195.72] doesn't exist in science and research it
[193.24 - 197.64] just doesn't may you know and and you
[195.72 - 200.80] know and so we really need to cover it
[197.64 - 202.36] and so when you know this is Advanced
[200.80 - 203.76] information we're talking about here in
[202.36 - 205.20] the show without a doubt this
[203.76 - 207.80] information this is the only show where
[205.20 - 211.16] the information here doesn't come from a
[207.80 - 213.24] place an agenda driven place you know
[211.16 - 215.20] like the interest groups and all the
[213.24 - 217.48] strings attached to medical stuff and
[215.20 - 219.28] medical funding and research that's been
[217.48 - 221.88] all messed up and botched up and the
[219.28 - 223.12] thumb on the scale medical lobbyists
[221.88 - 224.76] that sit there and they just want
[223.12 - 227.80] certain drugs to go through they don't
[224.76 - 229.56] you know and that's all it's about both
[227.80 - 231.24] you know and all these things can
[229.56 - 234.00] literally be an alternative and
[231.24 - 236.52] conventional medicine it really can
[234.00 - 238.88] believe it or not internal Kickbacks
[236.52 - 241.00] persuaded belief systems and private
[238.88 - 242.92] panels everywhere whereare that
[241.00 - 245.32] influence
[242.92 - 247.12] decisions decisions and then of course
[245.32 - 249.60] trends that start off of a lot of this
[247.12 - 252.80] information so we have contamination
[249.60 - 254.96] contamination in alternative medicine
[252.80 - 257.24] information and of course conventional
[254.96 - 260.44] medicine information it's the only show
[257.24 - 262.00] that we keep all that out 100% that
[260.44 - 264.40] means that we just don't go on the
[262.00 - 265.80] internet we don't go on the internet we
[264.40 - 267.60] don't need to we don't go on the
[265.80 - 269.72] Internet and try to hack it all out and
[267.60 - 272.00] S search all kinds of studies and things
[269.72 - 274.92] that are all skewed and all messed up
[272.00 - 276.52] and all agendas behind it and all kinds
[274.92 - 277.72] of different panels behind it in all
[276.52 - 279.28] kinds of different ways it was
[277.72 - 282.88] manipulated and
[279.28 - 285.72] contaminated we don't go by those old
[282.88 - 288.04] laws um just the only show that comes
[285.72 - 290.04] that's Pure Clean comes from a source
[288.04 - 292.04] that was given to me since Age 4 and
[290.04 - 294.28] have helped tens of thousands of people
[292.04 - 296.56] find their way and get the information
[294.28 - 298.20] they need throughout my whole lifetime
[296.56 - 300.52] all these decades and that's where you
[298.20 - 302.28] are now so that's where we are in this
[300.52 - 305.20] show right here and gallbladder we're
[302.28 - 308.00] going to go into this this is a good one
[305.20 - 310.48] I really do feel this that uh we're
[308.00 - 312.96] going to have a good
[310.48 - 315.80] time we're going to have a good time I
[312.96 - 318.60] remember my first experience um with a
[315.80 - 320.80] gallbladder not my gallbladder but a
[318.60 - 322.04] first experience with uh somebody who
[320.80 - 325.28] came to me with a
[322.04 - 328.04] gallbladder and and I remember it well
[325.28 - 330.36] it was a long long time ago um I don't
[328.04 - 332.64] want to date myself or anything or make
[330.36 - 334.36] myself sound too old I like to think I'm
[332.64 - 337.04] still
[334.36 - 339.16] young but um and I remember I remember
[337.04 - 341.16] when I first had my office years and
[339.16 - 342.64] years and years ago and you know opened
[341.16 - 344.32] it up to the public so it wasn't just
[342.64 - 346.24] helping people out randomly everywhere
[344.32 - 350.20] else I mean I I I helped people out all
[346.24 - 354.16] all along the way I remember at age 134
[350.20 - 357.36] I was a stock boy in a uh in a store in
[354.16 - 361.08] a grocery store and I would help people
[357.36 - 362.72] out all the time um I had clients that
[361.08 - 364.76] developed because of that because Spirit
[362.72 - 366.32] would give me information and I would
[364.76 - 367.84] see what's going on with People's Health
[366.32 - 370.24] right there right there in the grocery
[367.84 - 372.92] store aisle right there in the grocery
[370.24 - 374.64] store aisle so I I had a love for all
[372.92 - 376.04] that I had a love for food and and
[374.64 - 378.24] everything around because what Spirit
[376.04 - 381.44] was teaching me constantly and and what
[378.24 - 384.56] I needed to do for people and and um so
[381.44 - 386.08] I liked being in that atmosphere it was
[384.56 - 388.88] great because you know people are
[386.08 - 392.80] shopping for food and and it makes them
[388.88 - 394.88] think it makes them think and um and and
[392.80 - 396.48] it's such so great and you give somebody
[394.88 - 399.96] advice and you're like you know what you
[396.48 - 400.92] need you need cucumber juice for those
[399.96 - 403.96] gall
[400.92 - 407.12] stones and then you know after that when
[403.96 - 410.24] I finally had an office um I remember my
[407.12 - 413.00] first my first case coming in with with
[410.24 - 414.28] uh gallbladder problems and you know
[413.00 - 417.24] right when the person walked through the
[414.28 - 419.44] door Spirit was like gallbladder
[417.24 - 422.08] gallbladder you know we got a pile of
[419.44 - 425.28] sand in there we got a few stones in
[422.08 - 428.24] there we got two varieties of stones in
[425.28 - 430.92] there and there's even more varieties
[428.24 - 433.08] than what's what's you know recorded as
[430.92 - 437.04] far as what medical science and you know
[433.08 - 439.04] research understands and so it was
[437.04 - 440.80] really interesting and and and I have a
[439.04 - 442.92] love for that I have a love for the
[440.80 - 447.56] liver and gallbladder and everything
[442.92 - 449.68] around it um so so I remember that first
[447.56 - 451.08] case really clearly in the person was
[449.68 - 453.04] suffering
[451.08 - 454.72] suffering uh it was
[453.04 - 457.56] heartbreaking and they didn't want to
[454.72 - 459.52] get it taken out and since surgeries
[457.56 - 461.92] have gotten better for gallbladders I
[459.52 - 464.84] mean back then they weren't as
[461.92 - 466.88] great and um it was more of a difficult
[464.84 - 470.60] surgery it was a complicated surgery
[466.88 - 472.36] back then believe it or not now you know
[470.60 - 474.64] there's there's there's there's better
[472.36 - 476.28] techniques there's better techniques for
[474.64 - 479.44] you know snipping a gallbladder out
[476.28 - 481.28] underneath the liver under there and um
[479.44 - 484.28] it was a tricky place for surgeons to
[481.28 - 486.20] have to go and find back in the old days
[484.28 - 487.88] they had to swim around and take a
[486.20 - 492.40] really good look you had needed a really
[487.88 - 495.92] good guy or a gal with a really good eye
[492.40 - 497.88] um back then and um and knew you know
[495.92 - 499.92] knew that gallbladders don't sit
[497.88 - 501.76] perfectly in the same place for
[499.92 - 505.00] everybody and that's something I want to
[501.76 - 507.56] talk about too is that um gallbladders
[505.00 - 510.32] just aren't in the same spot for every
[507.56 - 513.96] single person how's that possible I
[510.32 - 516.60] thought we were all created equal in
[513.96 - 521.48] some way or identical in some way with
[516.60 - 524.16] our bodies right no no no no no no um
[521.48 - 526.32] the strangest things with our body one
[524.16 - 529.68] is with gallbladders they're not always
[526.32 - 531.52] in the same spot well you know you might
[529.68 - 533.64] be thinking well where are they how
[531.52 - 535.84] where could a gallbladder be besides
[533.64 - 538.00] tucked underneath the liver under there
[535.84 - 539.80] under the right side up there you know
[538.00 - 542.20] where where would it be well an inch
[539.80 - 544.36] over how about that how about an inch
[542.20 - 545.76] over which makes a huge difference when
[544.36 - 550.56] you're when you're a
[545.76 - 554.00] surgeon an inch over um how about like
[550.56 - 556.60] cocked up a wrong way not or or a
[554.00 - 559.28] different way how about that how about
[556.60 - 562.24] that how about a gallbladder that's not
[559.28 - 565.20] just sitting the way it's supposed to be
[562.24 - 567.40] but since childhood since meaning since
[565.20 - 569.88] birth and everything it it it took a
[567.40 - 570.92] different position how how about that
[569.88 - 574.64] how about a gallbladder that's a
[570.92 - 577.40] different shape entirely different shape
[574.64 - 579.52] it's not that that little pear shape
[577.40 - 583.52] that little pocket but it's it's got an
[579.52 - 585.48] apple shape how about those apples right
[583.52 - 587.80] so it's sitting differently not every
[585.48 - 590.28] gallbladder looks the same not every
[587.80 - 594.28] gallbladder looks the same I talked to a
[590.28 - 596.36] surgeon actually uh pretty recently and
[594.28 - 598.00] and and I was I was telling the surgeon
[596.36 - 599.56] about that kind of very thing and he
[598.00 - 601.28] says it's amazing that you even know
[599.56 - 603.32] that he said and I know and the surgeon
[601.28 - 604.60] you know he a friend of mine and he goes
[603.32 - 605.76] and he goes and I know you know all
[604.60 - 607.64] these things because that's what you
[605.76 - 610.00] done that's what you do we you know we
[607.64 - 612.32] know that but it's still it's still
[610.00 - 614.16] mindblowing that you know this that's
[612.32 - 615.40] what the surgeon said to me so my friend
[614.16 - 617.88] said to me it's still mind-blowing that
[615.40 - 621.36] you know this he knows why I know this
[617.88 - 624.56] because of spirit but it's still it was
[621.36 - 627.60] weird it was weird to him to hear
[624.56 - 629.60] it because because all not all
[627.60 - 632.24] gallbladders look the same if you cut
[629.60 - 634.08] enough of them out if you've cut enough
[632.24 - 637.80] of those babies
[634.08 - 640.04] out over the years you you'll know
[637.80 - 643.04] between women's gallbladders men men's
[640.04 - 647.20] gallbladders the whole bit you would
[643.04 - 649.40] know and um you know it it just it takes
[647.20 - 652.08] experience and being that I've never
[649.40 - 653.32] snipped out a gallbladder before ever
[652.08 - 656.04] he's just like it's just I don't just
[653.32 - 657.56] don't I I I know you hear Spirit but I
[656.04 - 659.32] still don't get it how you know these
[657.56 - 663.64] little nuances how you know these little
[659.32 - 664.96] things and um and because of that though
[663.64 - 666.00] the different shapes and sizes and
[664.96 - 669.20] everything it shows that we're all
[666.00 - 672.60] unique in all different ways without a
[669.20 - 676.08] doubt but back in the old days back in
[672.60 - 678.28] the older days finding that finding that
[676.08 - 681.40] little gallbladder in there you know
[678.28 - 685.44] wasn't always so easy took some time
[681.40 - 689.04] took a little searching took a little
[685.44 - 690.84] TLC and but now now I mean surgeons are
[689.04 - 693.36] you know we found different ways of of
[690.84 - 695.28] of using you know different technology
[693.36 - 697.08] for for getting in there and we got
[695.28 - 699.12] better scanning machines and so forth
[697.08 - 701.92] and all that and you know and thank God
[699.12 - 703.60] thank God that's right I mean I stand
[701.92 - 707.56] behind science and research I stand
[703.60 - 709.68] behind medical advancement 100% I'm
[707.56 - 712.48] always peed off about about chronic
[709.68 - 716.20] illness the area there I think that was
[712.48 - 719.56] just just totally just you know I just
[716.20 - 722.88] think we've all been left left out to
[719.56 - 724.88] dry on that and I can't help it you know
[722.88 - 727.04] medical denial with chronic illness is
[724.88 - 730.00] unbelievable and I can't help it I can't
[727.04 - 733.16] help it I just you know I'm still yeah
[730.00 - 734.72] yeah I'm still burnt up about that after
[733.16 - 736.84] all these years I've seen too many
[734.72 - 739.28] people suffer no answers for people and
[736.84 - 740.56] the answers they do get now is is
[739.28 - 742.60] becoming
[740.56 - 743.92] ridiculous and look I'm not against the
[742.60 - 746.32] whole lime disease thing but I'm going
[743.92 - 748.20] to tell you right now um everybody's
[746.32 - 750.80] going to be diagnosed with Lyme disease
[748.20 - 754.24] everybody in chronic illness everybody
[750.80 - 758.52] everybody because the system is messed
[754.24 - 760.28] up terribly terribly anybody with
[758.52 - 761.52] anything lupus diagnosis those are going
[760.28 - 763.32] to be a thing of the past it's all going
[761.52 - 765.48] to be pushed off the lime everything's
[763.32 - 767.92] going to be lime Ms anything Ms is going
[765.48 - 769.44] to be pushed off the lime anything is
[767.92 - 773.16] going to be pushed off the
[769.44 - 775.36] lime and that's that's by Design that's
[773.16 - 776.92] by Design By the way that's by Design if
[775.36 - 779.88] that's getting anybody upset right now
[776.92 - 781.60] because limes tends to tends to you know
[779.88 - 783.60] the whole lime thing tends to get people
[781.60 - 786.00] just red up and they get angry and
[783.60 - 787.84] pissed off and just read my chapter in
[786.00 - 789.80] book one whatever you do and read it
[787.84 - 793.36] with an open mind don't read it with
[789.80 - 795.20] anger in your heart read it with an open
[793.36 - 798.68] mind it's
[795.20 - 800.96] important um so yeah yeah in and but
[798.68 - 803.04] with the gallbladder thing you know it's
[800.96 - 804.52] it's great we have great people you they
[803.04 - 806.88] can help somebody with a gallbladder
[804.52 - 811.52] problem we have great great
[806.88 - 813.12] surgeons but it's as far as information
[811.52 - 815.84] about how to prevent the gallbladder
[813.12 - 819.64] problem as far as
[815.84 - 822.12] information to uh dissolve
[819.64 - 824.48] Stones you know the one thing I don't
[822.12 - 830.88] like is gallbladder
[824.48 - 834.72] flushes y I don't like them no no
[830.88 - 837.28] no I don't like them at all doing this a
[834.72 - 840.36] long time and Spirits always said you
[837.28 - 844.32] know no gallbladder flesh is why I've
[840.36 - 846.36] seen people pop a good Stone in that
[844.32 - 849.08] duct get it
[846.36 - 851.60] stuck when we didn't need to do a
[849.08 - 853.04] gallbladder flush we didn't need to try
[851.60 - 854.72] to do gallbladder flush we could have
[853.04 - 856.00] just dissolved the stone what was in the
[854.72 - 859.08] gallbladder while it was sitting in
[856.00 - 862.00] there all nice and pretty in a good spot
[859.08 - 863.96] and we could have slowly dissolved it we
[862.00 - 865.72] could have gotten a liver in a better
[863.96 - 868.84] condition so it wouldn't keep on
[865.72 - 871.60] producing a gall stone or growing it we
[868.84 - 875.44] could do a lot of things we don't have
[871.60 - 878.48] to try to do this flush and accidentally
[875.44 - 880.84] pop a giant Stone up into the duct and
[878.48 - 884.16] get it stuck and then it's emergency Sur
[880.84 - 885.88] emergency surgery time or get it in get
[884.16 - 886.96] it popped in there and get it stuck and
[885.88 - 890.04] get it
[886.96 - 891.80] infected over time little strep a cacus
[890.04 - 895.40] that's already in your digestive tra and
[891.80 - 897.00] in your in your your IND wadum and
[895.40 - 898.32] everything else that backtracks and
[897.00 - 900.28] finds its way up there a little bit of
[898.32 - 902.08] strip caucus that you know it's always
[900.28 - 904.08] sitting in people's livers that just you
[902.08 - 906.48] know jumps up
[904.08 - 908.80] into jumps up to the gallbladder it's
[906.48 - 910.16] waiting for something stupid to happen
[908.80 - 912.60] that's what it's doing it's waiting for
[910.16 - 915.56] something stupid to happen like a stone
[912.60 - 917.48] getting jammed because of a flush and
[915.56 - 919.60] then getting a little bit swollen in
[917.48 - 922.16] there because the tissue starts to get
[919.60 - 925.48] irritable and then boom the strep jumps
[922.16 - 927.80] in there and Dives right in and then
[925.48 - 930.24] infects the heck out of it and then now
[927.80 - 933.04] you're rushing to the hospital and it's
[930.24 - 934.20] partly turning green I I can't tell you
[933.04 - 936.64] how many times I've seen that happen
[934.20 - 938.36] from gallbladder fleshes till this day I
[936.64 - 941.24] bang my head against a wall when I hear
[938.36 - 943.56] about another one and I'm just like why
[941.24 - 946.28] why is this misinformation out there why
[943.56 - 947.80] is this stupid misinformation out there
[946.28 - 949.08] what is going on I bet you the liver
[947.80 - 950.28] people are pissed at me right now
[949.08 - 951.48] there's a lot of liver gallbladder
[950.28 - 952.76] flushing people out there they're
[951.48 - 954.16] probably just going to get all angry and
[952.76 - 957.96] I'm sure there's plenty listening I'm
[954.16 - 959.16] sorry just forgive me if you can I'm not
[957.96 - 961.36] you know
[959.16 - 963.00] I like the fact that you care I like the
[961.36 - 964.28] fact that you're healing people I like
[963.00 - 965.36] the fact that you're working on healing
[964.28 - 967.24] people in different ways you probably
[965.36 - 969.72] know all kinds of incredible
[967.24 - 970.88] information and and and everything else
[969.72 - 972.28] and it's not your fault if you're
[970.88 - 973.96] telling people to constantly do a
[972.28 - 977.84] gallbladder fleshes it's not your fault
[973.96 - 980.08] at all it's not and you know just what
[977.84 - 981.56] it is is it's just it's it's information
[980.08 - 983.96] that you gathered somewhere else from
[981.56 - 985.48] some original Source somewhere that just
[983.96 - 987.92] was wrong to begin
[985.48 - 989.20] with and uh and that's how it's done
[987.92 - 991.84] that's how it's done that's how all the
[989.20 - 994.28] misinformation goes around out there I
[991.84 - 995.88] bet you some people are uh hanging up
[994.28 - 997.36] from the show right now and they're like
[995.88 - 1000.52] I'm not listening to him anymore I'm not
[997.36 - 1002.28] listening to that jerk
[1000.52 - 1003.88] anymore I've helped people with
[1002.28 - 1005.72] gallbladder fleshes I'm not listening to
[1003.88 - 1007.20] that jerk anymore he's basically telling
[1005.72 - 1009.04] me I've been doing things wrong I don't
[1007.20 - 1012.80] want to hear that on a
[1009.04 - 1014.52] show but um but look I'm saying that
[1012.80 - 1017.76] because seriously seriously listen
[1014.52 - 1019.80] listen keep a lie heart keep a lie heart
[1017.76 - 1021.76] you know the one thing I've had to do
[1019.80 - 1023.96] with with with all these years and and
[1021.76 - 1026.12] and this show included and and in the
[1023.96 - 1027.76] books is I've had to hurt people's
[1026.12 - 1029.60] feelings once in a while and I don't
[1027.76 - 1030.76] mean to do it on purpose you know
[1029.60 - 1034.44] meaning the sense I don't want to hurt
[1030.76 - 1038.44] anybody's feelings I don't I
[1034.44 - 1041.76] don't I I just you
[1038.44 - 1043.28] know there's a there's a fine line you
[1041.76 - 1045.12] know there's a fine line about
[1043.28 - 1046.96] everything you know you want you want to
[1045.12 - 1050.16] support everybody for everything they're
[1046.96 - 1052.76] doing but you also want to watch
[1050.16 - 1054.48] everybody's backs you know I've seen a
[1052.76 - 1056.36] lot of surgeries that were unnecessary
[1054.48 - 1058.08] over the years I've been doing this for
[1056.36 - 1059.68] a long long time and it's funny someone
[1058.08 - 1062.36] said to me when did you start 5 years
[1059.68 - 1067.04] ago when did you start being a medium 5
[1062.36 - 1069.72] years ago I mean what talk to my parents
[1067.04 - 1072.56] talk to my parents and you you you
[1069.72 - 1075.60] listen to them and going all the way
[1072.56 - 1077.96] back you know vouching for me with
[1075.60 - 1079.76] stories all the way since Charlie you
[1077.96 - 1082.24] you talked to them You' tell you you ask
[1079.76 - 1083.84] them when I started being a medium you
[1082.24 - 1085.64] know and it's not just that I mean I've
[1083.84 - 1088.12] been I've been working on people forever
[1085.64 - 1090.04] working with people forever and going
[1088.12 - 1092.40] all the way back and it hasn't been just
[1090.04 - 1094.72] 5 years hasn't been just 7 years hasn't
[1092.40 - 1098.92] been 9 years hasn't been 12 years hasn't
[1094.72 - 1100.92] been 15 years been a lot longer and so
[1098.92 - 1104.36] I've been able to witness a lot just
[1100.92 - 1106.24] like a good surgeon Witnesses so much
[1104.36 - 1109.12] just like a good surgeon you know I mean
[1106.24 - 1111.32] who's got a track record
[1109.12 - 1115.24] a long-term track
[1111.32 - 1116.68] record and you know and and basically
[1115.24 - 1118.16] the bottom line is I'm not trying to
[1116.68 - 1120.36] hurt anybody's feelings I'm just saying
[1118.16 - 1122.84] hey look instead of doing the flushes
[1120.36 - 1125.64] anymore let's redesign it let's change
[1122.84 - 1128.12] it up let's let's figure out something
[1125.64 - 1130.40] different let's figure out another way
[1128.12 - 1134.48] which spirit and I already
[1130.40 - 1137.52] know but let's figure out another way to
[1134.48 - 1139.16] dissolve Stones wouldn't that be nice
[1137.52 - 1141.12] would wouldn't that be great we can
[1139.16 - 1143.80] dissolve them how about that or stop
[1141.12 - 1145.92] producing them how about that or both
[1143.80 - 1147.76] wouldn't that be nice absolutely
[1145.92 - 1150.40] absolutely without a
[1147.76 - 1152.48] doubt so Stones what's the deal with
[1150.40 - 1154.08] those or what are they made out of right
[1152.48 - 1156.24] well made out of
[1154.08 - 1159.28] cholesterol okay made out of you know
[1156.24 - 1162.84] pigment too made out of pigment Billy
[1159.28 - 1165.36] Rubin Billy Rubin I like that name is
[1162.84 - 1167.92] that the right way to say it Billy Ruben
[1165.36 - 1169.76] you know and um I say that because I
[1167.92 - 1172.36] like I like it when it's called Billy
[1169.76 - 1174.24] Rubin I don't know it's just cool cool
[1172.36 - 1176.28] name cool
[1174.24 - 1178.68] name and
[1176.28 - 1180.00] um and somebody might say that's not the
[1178.68 - 1183.08] correct way of saying it it's called
[1180.00 - 1186.12] biley Robin biley
[1183.08 - 1189.60] Robin there something I me that happen
[1186.12 - 1192.88] where I call something by by you know by
[1189.60 - 1195.24] a name that I I think it's
[1192.88 - 1197.00] called and someone's correcting me like
[1195.24 - 1199.40] no that's not the exact way it's
[1197.00 - 1202.44] supposed to be said and so anyway Billy
[1199.40 - 1204.16] Rubin it's Pigman right and uh what's
[1202.44 - 1205.76] Billy Rubin it's it's red blood cells
[1204.16 - 1207.60] it's just discarded red blood cells
[1205.76 - 1210.56] that's that's actually all
[1207.60 - 1212.00] right that's all correct you know that's
[1210.56 - 1214.68] just the way it works that's great
[1212.00 - 1217.12] that's great cholesterol why is
[1214.68 - 1219.52] cholesterol building
[1217.12 - 1222.68] up in
[1219.52 - 1223.80] somebody's liver and spitting out into
[1222.68 - 1225.76] the
[1223.80 - 1228.92] gallbladder why
[1225.76 - 1231.36] is excuse me why is
[1228.92 - 1232.72] why is why is why is cholesterol doing
[1231.36 - 1235.60] that why
[1232.72 - 1239.64] is Billy
[1235.60 - 1242.52] ruin building up and becoming a stone
[1239.64 - 1244.96] though why is it becoming a stone why
[1242.52 - 1246.84] are these becoming a stone I mean you
[1244.96 - 1249.04] that's the question that's the question
[1246.84 - 1251.76] what's the what's the purpose what's
[1249.04 - 1254.32] going on there why is that
[1251.76 - 1257.00] happening and why is the
[1254.32 - 1258.84] liver being part of this why is it being
[1257.00 - 1261.68] a big part of it is being responsible
[1258.84 - 1263.84] for it what's going on in somebody's
[1261.68 - 1266.08] life what's going on in somebody's diet
[1263.84 - 1268.20] what's going on in somebody's liver
[1266.08 - 1270.76] that's creating those
[1268.20 - 1272.64] stones what's going on
[1270.76 - 1274.08] there and that's what we're going to
[1272.64 - 1276.36] talk about that's what we're going to
[1274.08 - 1279.36] talk about right there and what about
[1276.36 - 1283.08] the pile of sand that builds up you know
[1279.36 - 1286.16] if you don't change your oil in your
[1283.08 - 1288.20] car are you thinking the same thing I am
[1286.16 - 1290.68] are you thinking the same thing I right
[1288.20 - 1291.48] right if you don't change your oil in
[1290.68 - 1294.32] your
[1291.48 - 1296.00] car what happens just the oil filter
[1294.32 - 1298.52] starts getting really
[1296.00 - 1301.72] clogged it just gets really
[1298.52 - 1303.68] clogged that's what's going on well
[1301.72 - 1306.32] that's what's
[1303.68 - 1310.44] happening with the
[1306.32 - 1313.00] gallbladder that's like your oil filter
[1310.44 - 1314.60] kind of like your oil filter in a way so
[1313.00 - 1316.08] getting really gunky in there really
[1314.60 - 1317.56] clogged and gunky in there if you don't
[1316.08 - 1319.20] change your oil if you don't change your
[1317.56 - 1321.96] oil in your
[1319.20 - 1323.86] liver if you don't change the oil in
[1321.96 - 1326.44] your engine in the
[1323.86 - 1329.72] [Laughter]
[1326.44 - 1332.56] car right I mean it just gets gunier and
[1329.72 - 1335.04] dark it turns jet black and it just it's
[1332.56 - 1337.24] it's got all kinds of metal fragments in
[1335.04 - 1339.64] there because the engine doesn't have
[1337.24 - 1342.04] viscosity anymore so the you know the
[1339.64 - 1344.76] crankshaft is just spinning in the
[1342.04 - 1347.52] valves and everything else is just it's
[1344.76 - 1348.88] just um it's just everything's getting
[1347.52 - 1350.44] Mucky
[1348.88 - 1352.96] everything's getting
[1350.44 - 1355.68] Mucky and then the oil's getting dirtier
[1352.96 - 1357.76] and dirtier and the the air filter is
[1355.68 - 1359.08] not being changed and all this garbage
[1357.76 - 1362.76] is going
[1359.08 - 1364.04] in right I mean some of you probably
[1362.76 - 1365.04] know that some of you probably don't
[1364.04 - 1367.60] some of you are probably like I don't
[1365.04 - 1369.32] know I just turned the key on the car
[1367.60 - 1375.68] and that's
[1369.32 - 1379.48] it and that oil turns into a sludge a
[1375.68 - 1382.32] sludge turns into a sludge
[1379.48 - 1384.44] like scrape off the bottom of the oil
[1382.32 - 1386.92] pan a
[1384.44 - 1389.44] sludge that's how it
[1386.92 - 1392.32] works so they don't change your oil it
[1389.44 - 1393.92] gets dirty and Mucky and ugly it turns
[1392.32 - 1397.52] into a sludge a
[1393.92 - 1399.84] pudding thick black pudding the bottom
[1397.52 - 1399.84] of your
[1400.12 - 1406.56] pan and it's set it's settlement
[1403.16 - 1410.08] sediment right sediment is that what it
[1406.56 - 1411.28] is and um the oil filter gets clogged
[1410.08 - 1413.76] and everything
[1411.28 - 1415.64] else or maybe it's just sediment at the
[1413.76 - 1418.08] bottom of the pan maybe that's what that
[1415.64 - 1420.28] gallbladder is it's like the bottom of
[1418.08 - 1420.28] the
[1420.92 - 1425.96] pan and all that Gunk and settlement is
[1424.08 - 1428.76] in there and that's
[1425.96 - 1430.40] different believe it or not that's the
[1428.76 - 1432.36] third thing science research isn't
[1430.40 - 1434.00] really identifying they talk about that
[1432.36 - 1436.24] they talk about lots of different Stones
[1434.00 - 1438.48] you get an ultrasound you get a CAT scan
[1436.24 - 1440.64] an ultrasound an MRI and the nurse
[1438.48 - 1442.36] practitioner the nurse comes in or the
[1440.64 - 1444.28] doctor comes in and says oh my God
[1442.36 - 1447.56] you're your your gallbladder is hundreds
[1444.28 - 1447.56] and hundreds of stones it's filled with
[1447.64 - 1452.16] sand
[1449.72 - 1454.96] and that
[1452.16 - 1458.44] sand isn't
[1454.96 - 1461.92] always gall stones meaning it meaning it
[1458.44 - 1464.32] isn't always cholesterol Stones is
[1461.92 - 1468.32] information that's not known out
[1464.32 - 1471.64] there news flash that saying and isn't
[1468.32 - 1474.56] always Billy Ruben those red blood
[1471.64 - 1476.72] cells it's a third
[1474.56 - 1481.12] component that's science of research
[1476.72 - 1484.68] hasn't tapped into that gunk in that
[1481.12 - 1488.24] gallbladder is all kinds of stuff it's
[1484.68 - 1492.64] dead viral carcasses dead viral
[1488.24 - 1496.76] byproduct dead pathogen byproduct dead
[1492.64 - 1499.60] um uh bacterial byproduct
[1496.76 - 1504.36] Plastics spit up from the liver from
[1499.60 - 1507.28] antibiotics petrol oil petrol
[1504.36 - 1510.04] oil and I'm not doing the analogy the
[1507.28 - 1511.48] metaphor I'm not doing that part I'm not
[1510.04 - 1513.28] just talking about the oil on the bottom
[1511.48 - 1516.88] of a pan is real engine oil in the
[1513.28 - 1522.76] bottom of a pan of a car you
[1516.88 - 1524.00] guys I I'm talking about real petrol oil
[1522.76 - 1525.92] put in
[1524.00 - 1527.44] antibiotics they don't need to put that
[1525.92 - 1529.80] in there by the way I mean I scratched
[1527.44 - 1532.72] my head I'm scratching my head right
[1529.80 - 1534.36] now they don't need to put that in there
[1532.72 - 1536.00] just one of those additives that don't
[1534.36 - 1538.20] have to be in
[1536.00 - 1541.40] antibiotics they just don't have to be
[1538.20 - 1543.44] there isn't that funny isn't that funny
[1541.40 - 1545.36] I mean you know we talk about foods and
[1543.44 - 1546.48] everything preservatives and foods and
[1545.36 - 1548.72] you know you want your chicken
[1546.48 - 1551.16] antibiotic free right you want all that
[1548.72 - 1552.36] you want your chicken be free range you
[1551.16 - 1555.12] you know you don't want preservatives
[1552.36 - 1560.32] you don't want aluminum nitrate you
[1555.12 - 1563.36] don't want aluminum pumped into to your
[1560.32 - 1566.12] chickens you know they they you know
[1563.36 - 1568.56] inject aluminum and turkeys and chickens
[1566.12 - 1571.12] plump them up I mean you don't want that
[1568.56 - 1573.76] in there right you don't want all this
[1571.12 - 1576.08] whatever in there but when we take an
[1573.76 - 1578.28] antibiotic they put all the stuff in
[1576.08 - 1579.96] there I mean they don't have to that's
[1578.28 - 1582.40] the sad part they don't have they don't
[1579.96 - 1584.36] have to have petrol oil in there but
[1582.40 - 1587.28] where does that petrol oil go it's small
[1584.36 - 1589.76] amounts real small amounts doesn't
[1587.28 - 1591.80] matter liver the liver you know the
[1589.76 - 1595.04] liver gets pissed off
[1591.80 - 1596.00] anyway and it storage it stores these
[1595.04 - 1597.84] these
[1596.00 - 1600.08] petrochemicals and you can get other
[1597.84 - 1603.20] exposure to petrochemicals
[1600.08 - 1606.00] too and from other drugs and other
[1603.20 - 1607.48] sources other avenues and liver you know
[1606.00 - 1608.96] eventually just if the liver is not
[1607.48 - 1610.00] getting cleaned up if we're not eating
[1608.96 - 1611.40] right if we're not taking care of the
[1610.00 - 1612.56] liver if we're not doing what we need to
[1611.40 - 1615.04] do for the
[1612.56 - 1617.08] liver if our diet's not good if we're
[1615.04 - 1618.60] pounding in tons of protein and fat in
[1617.08 - 1620.60] our diet
[1618.60 - 1622.28] thinking that's the way even if we're no
[1620.60 - 1623.44] carb and we're exercising and we're
[1622.28 - 1625.20] starting to look better and we're
[1623.44 - 1627.16] starting to get a little bit more fit
[1625.20 - 1630.20] our liver is still taking a hit like oh
[1627.16 - 1633.00] my God nobody knows that by the
[1630.20 - 1636.08] way and so what does the liver do it
[1633.00 - 1639.48] pushes pushes that stuff right up into
[1636.08 - 1643.08] the gallbladder and it's not Billy Rubin
[1639.48 - 1643.08] it's not our friend Billy
[1643.92 - 1649.56] Ruben it's you know it's not our friend
[1647.80 - 1652.80] CEST
[1649.56 - 1655.68] raw making names out of these two things
[1652.80 - 1657.20] all right I'm being silly today there's
[1655.68 - 1658.24] nothing to be silly about with gall
[1657.20 - 1660.40] stones and
[1658.24 - 1661.96] gallbladders see a lot of people go
[1660.40 - 1663.24] through a lot of trouble I think I'm
[1661.96 - 1665.12] just giggly
[1663.24 - 1668.28] today it's
[1665.12 - 1670.52] unbelievable um yeah you got to keep a
[1668.28 - 1674.00] light heart we got to keep a light heart
[1670.52 - 1677.24] okay so there's something else that gets
[1674.00 - 1680.36] going there's something else going on in
[1677.24 - 1683.04] that sludge it's a whole bunch of waste
[1680.36 - 1685.32] that's not analyzed by research and
[1683.04 - 1688.32] science they don't analyze that you know
[1685.32 - 1690.08] why it's got a guilty Trail in it it's
[1688.32 - 1692.52] got a guilty
[1690.08 - 1695.92] Trail it's
[1692.52 - 1699.24] got a trail it's got It's
[1695.92 - 1701.52] evidence it's evidence of all kinds of
[1699.24 - 1703.80] crap I mean everything there's heavy
[1701.52 - 1707.28] metals in there literally and you know
[1703.80 - 1709.00] what's so bizarre what's so bizarre is
[1707.28 - 1710.48] that that's what's in engine oil that's
[1709.00 - 1712.04] that's that when engine oil is not
[1710.48 - 1714.00] replaced and it and it sits at the
[1712.04 - 1716.48] bottom of the pan you guys it gets
[1714.00 - 1718.44] filled with these little micro micr
[1716.48 - 1721.64] chips of metal that are coming out of
[1718.44 - 1721.64] the engine because there's no
[1722.08 - 1728.28] viscosity well there's heavy metals
[1725.76 - 1730.24] saturating the liver from all kinds of
[1728.28 - 1732.28] reasons all kinds of reasons medical
[1730.24 - 1735.24] reasons you know medical
[1732.28 - 1736.96] stuff uh Medical Products uh all kinds
[1735.24 - 1739.48] of different things just you know stuff
[1736.96 - 1742.04] falling out of the sky uh food pots and
[1739.48 - 1744.48] pans people scraping pots and pans
[1742.04 - 1747.28] restaurants restaurants are the worst
[1744.48 - 1748.72] the worst unless it's a good one unless
[1747.28 - 1751.44] it's a good one that's really taking
[1748.72 - 1752.84] care of everybody in the food properly
[1751.44 - 1753.72] so if you're a restaurant owner I'm sure
[1752.84 - 1755.16] that's what you're doing if you're
[1753.72 - 1756.76] listening to this show then that's
[1755.16 - 1761.16] definitely what you're do you're doing
[1756.76 - 1764.00] without a doubt but the bottom line is
[1761.16 - 1766.48] that metal heavy metals toxic heavy
[1764.00 - 1767.84] metals sit in that sludge but that
[1766.48 - 1771.76] sludge never gets
[1767.84 - 1775.40] analyzed never gets analyzed they never
[1771.76 - 1778.16] do and and and and if and if they have
[1775.40 - 1781.76] which they probably
[1778.16 - 1784.76] have um I'm sure they kept out the bad
[1781.76 - 1786.60] stuff bad stuff in any study because
[1784.76 - 1789.60] like I said at the beginning of the
[1786.60 - 1791.36] show blah blah blah this information
[1789.60 - 1793.36] doesn't come from this this this this
[1791.36 - 1794.96] this this contaminated this this sources
[1793.36 - 1796.84] this this this this trendy traps the
[1794.96 - 1798.28] payoffs all that crap it's like I said
[1796.84 - 1800.20] at the beginning
[1798.28 - 1801.76] because what's in that sludge is a whole
[1800.20 - 1804.72] bunch of
[1801.76 - 1808.68] evidence all kinds of metals Plastics
[1804.72 - 1811.64] petroleum oils can you believe it yeah
[1808.68 - 1814.00] yeah yeah yeah and nobody knows it and
[1811.64 - 1817.00] that's the third aspect of what's inside
[1814.00 - 1820.52] a gallbladder mind blown mine is Spirit
[1817.00 - 1823.24] blows my mind all the time mind blown
[1820.52 - 1825.08] seriously if yours isn't then I
[1823.24 - 1830.36] understand but mine is
[1825.08 - 1832.56] boom I mean and that's the third part so
[1830.36 - 1835.20] let's go through them a little bit all
[1832.56 - 1838.28] right the cholesterol Stone why is
[1835.20 - 1841.60] cholesterol like amping up and becoming
[1838.28 - 1844.40] a rolling stone in there what the
[1841.60 - 1846.84] heck what is going
[1844.40 - 1848.72] on that's because a liver is becoming
[1846.84 - 1850.80] dysfunctional a liver is becoming
[1848.72 - 1852.16] dysfunctional because big part of its
[1850.80 - 1853.44] diet and other part of it the liver is
[1852.16 - 1855.80] getting sluggish and dysfunctional
[1853.44 - 1859.24] stagnant even fatty even if it's pre-
[1855.80 - 1859.24] fatty liver and not diagnosed
[1859.52 - 1866.08] what about old Billy Billy
[1862.84 - 1867.80] Ruben right why is that happening
[1866.08 - 1870.00] because red blood cells mean a liver is
[1867.80 - 1872.04] under stress and it's contaminated with
[1870.00 - 1873.84] a lot of toxins and pathogens and stuff
[1872.04 - 1875.36] like that so it's it's dealing with he
[1873.84 - 1878.04] hemoglobin a lot differently and red
[1875.36 - 1880.08] blood cells start to they start to do
[1878.04 - 1882.24] something they start to glue each other
[1880.08 - 1884.52] together the pigment starts to glue
[1882.24 - 1886.16] itself together and creating a stone
[1884.52 - 1888.52] when the liver is too
[1886.16 - 1891.20] overburdened
[1888.52 - 1893.64] and then you know like Grandma's apple
[1891.20 - 1895.60] pie you just need the right recipe you
[1893.64 - 1897.28] just need the right recipe I said that
[1895.60 - 1900.24] probably one of the earliest shows ever
[1897.28 - 1903.00] that we did one of the early
[1900.24 - 1906.60] shows and I've also said it many many
[1903.00 - 1909.16] years ago grandma's Apple Pie tastes
[1906.60 - 1912.44] just the way it does because it's just
[1909.16 - 1914.80] right because she puts just a little bit
[1912.44 - 1918.16] of nutmeg in but not too much and not
[1914.80 - 1920.76] too too little little bit of salt not a
[1918.16 - 1923.68] lot of salt balancing it with the
[1920.76 - 1925.92] sweet I'm being silly today I know sorry
[1923.68 - 1928.84] you guys seriously seriously let's take
[1925.92 - 1930.96] this as serious as
[1928.84 - 1933.88] possible but seriously though with
[1930.96 - 1937.40] Grandma's apple pie it's just right for
[1933.88 - 1940.00] a reason it made a recipe for a reason
[1937.40 - 1941.32] with Billy ruin and and and in
[1940.00 - 1943.36] cholesterol stones to do what they're
[1941.32 - 1945.24] doing it takes also a recipe of what's
[1943.36 - 1947.16] in that other sludge P pile what's in
[1945.24 - 1948.68] the other sludge pile the sludge pile is
[1947.16 - 1950.64] the evidence of what's going on inside
[1948.68 - 1953.24] the liver which creates the recipe of
[1950.64 - 1958.20] creating the stones for God's
[1953.24 - 1960.04] sake yeah mind blown information
[1958.20 - 1962.60] overload because it's never been
[1960.04 - 1965.68] released anywhere that information of
[1962.60 - 1967.96] course just like 85 90% of everything
[1965.68 - 1970.28] else on the shows I
[1967.96 - 1971.56] do I'm saying that in case you know if
[1970.28 - 1973.00] you're on the internet a lot of people
[1971.56 - 1974.24] they're like okay okay what do to see
[1973.00 - 1976.12] okay let's get on the internet okay
[1974.24 - 1977.76] let's let's look into this and now
[1976.12 - 1981.36] they're like going you they're going
[1977.76 - 1981.36] crazy they're looking they're
[1982.88 - 1987.56] looking so it's really about the liver
[1985.48 - 1991.28] in this situation it's about the liver
[1987.56 - 1993.36] producing an amount of of toxic waste
[1991.28 - 1996.80] from not being cared for but it's the
[1993.36 - 1999.04] right kind of toxic waste that can glue
[1996.80 - 2001.16] red blood cells together creating that
[1999.04 - 2003.76] pigment stone that Billy Ruben stone
[2001.16 - 2007.20] that stone I hate that
[2003.76 - 2011.80] stone I hate that stone cuz that one's a
[2007.20 - 2014.08] weird one Billy Ruben that stone I I
[2011.80 - 2015.92] don't like that stone a little harder to
[2014.08 - 2017.76] dissolve I've had to get a lot of people
[2015.92 - 2019.84] to dissolve
[2017.76 - 2021.68] them absolutely I had to change your
[2019.84 - 2023.72] diet around the right way to get them to
[2021.68 - 2027.16] dissolve I had to do different things
[2023.72 - 2027.16] but I I I hate that
[2028.20 - 2035.56] stone cholesterol Stones eh I don't hate
[2032.60 - 2038.16] we can break those down no
[2035.56 - 2039.96] problem we can we can we can break them
[2038.16 - 2041.88] down easier faster we can break down the
[2039.96 - 2044.24] Billy Rubin too I mean that's okay too
[2041.88 - 2046.12] we can do that stone too and we can get
[2044.24 - 2050.44] rid of some of the sludge but we don't
[2046.12 - 2050.44] want to do it with a gallbladder
[2050.56 - 2055.68] flush a silly gallbladder
[2053.32 - 2058.00] flush I'll tell you right now you don't
[2055.68 - 2060.12] want that cholesterol Stone to pop up
[2058.00 - 2061.76] into that duct and lock itself in and
[2060.12 - 2064.20] maybe you're lucky maybe you're lucky
[2061.76 - 2065.84] and it won't as a lot of people do they
[2064.20 - 2067.68] get by they get lucky on that it's a
[2065.84 - 2069.24] good it's but I don't like r roulette do
[2067.68 - 2070.88] you I don't like it I don't like taking
[2069.24 - 2073.52] a gun with one bullet spinning the
[2070.88 - 2075.40] chamber putting up to my head for fun I
[2073.52 - 2078.24] just don't like that I'm not a Russian
[2075.40 - 2080.20] Roulette kind of guy maybe when I was a
[2078.24 - 2082.92] kid maybe when I was a kid I'd be like
[2080.20 - 2086.84] all right I I'll take the chance you I
[2082.92 - 2088.84] was you know maybe when I was 10 11 12
[2086.84 - 2092.20] years
[2088.84 - 2094.68] old I would you know take
[2092.20 - 2096.12] chances not like anything stupid like
[2094.68 - 2098.24] that but I would be like all right all
[2096.12 - 2100.72] right I I I bet we can do this I bet we
[2098.24 - 2104.24] can take this bicycle and we can jump it
[2100.72 - 2106.68] over this Ravine with this little wooden
[2104.24 - 2110.08] ramp I got Spirit watching my back
[2106.68 - 2112.16] Spirit won't let me get hurt I'll F I'll
[2110.08 - 2115.76] Fly Like a Bird on this
[2112.16 - 2118.44] bicycle I'll jump this River with this
[2115.76 - 2121.56] bicycle I'll take a chance there's
[2118.44 - 2124.16] chances are what's my odd Spirit 90%
[2121.56 - 2126.24] chance you're not going to make it 10%
[2124.16 - 2127.60] chance that you're going to make it and
[2126.24 - 2128.84] when you do make it to the other side
[2127.60 - 2131.24] you're probably going to have broken
[2128.84 - 2133.08] bones all right I'll take my chance well
[2131.24 - 2135.36] what's the guarantee about that 10% with
[2133.08 - 2137.20] broken bones well 1% you won't have any
[2135.36 - 2140.36] broken bones just really bad bruises and
[2137.20 - 2140.36] injury okay I'll take the chance
[2140.64 - 2146.08] 1% and you know so yeah but but I don't
[2144.32 - 2149.92] like doing that I don't like doing any
[2146.08 - 2151.32] of that now that was when I was young
[2149.92 - 2154.44] but the point
[2151.32 - 2155.88] is the point is is that we don't want to
[2154.44 - 2157.36] do that you don't want to do the flushes
[2155.88 - 2159.52] you don't want to pop a stone stone in
[2157.36 - 2163.20] there in the
[2159.52 - 2166.04] duck and in the
[2163.20 - 2167.84] duct okay so let's move on let's move on
[2166.04 - 2170.72] we're trying to cut through this um
[2167.84 - 2172.84] telling you guys too many stories spasms
[2170.72 - 2174.16] and infections gallbladder infections I
[2172.84 - 2176.32] hate gallbladder
[2174.16 - 2178.08] infections you can get food poisoning in
[2176.32 - 2179.92] a restaurant and it can take out your
[2178.08 - 2182.56] gallbladder
[2179.92 - 2185.48] boy man that food born toxin that food
[2182.56 - 2186.96] born bacteria that salmonella anything
[2185.48 - 2189.36] like that can Rush up to that
[2186.96 - 2191.28] gallbladder I mean if yeah if you're
[2189.36 - 2193.40] lucky and you're just vomiting for a day
[2191.28 - 2194.84] or for a couple of hours or quickly or
[2193.40 - 2196.24] you just got a bad stomach ache and
[2194.84 - 2197.88] you're burping and burping and burping
[2196.24 - 2200.32] because of a food born toxin in a
[2197.88 - 2203.32] restaurant and I you guys should listen
[2200.32 - 2204.72] to my to my uh I think the show's called
[2203.32 - 2207.20] like food poisoning show or something
[2204.72 - 2209.28] like that I forgot now I forgot doing so
[2207.20 - 2212.32] many shows now I just I
[2209.28 - 2214.48] forgot I think it was food food
[2212.32 - 2217.08] poisoning you should listen to it listen
[2214.48 - 2218.76] to it carefully okay cuz last thing you
[2217.08 - 2220.48] want is to get food poisoning I've had
[2218.76 - 2222.92] friends get food poisoning of the worst
[2220.48 - 2226.08] kind I I oh my
[2222.92 - 2228.76] god I've had friends I've had people
[2226.08 - 2231.40] clients uh I've had you know doctors
[2228.76 - 2233.20] friends getting the worst food poisoning
[2231.40 - 2236.84] ever in their
[2233.20 - 2238.44] life um you know but you name it and and
[2236.84 - 2240.00] what happens is with food poisoning is
[2238.44 - 2242.20] is sometimes it can get us really good
[2240.00 - 2243.64] and it could and that bacteria could
[2242.20 - 2245.92] Rush right up to the gallbladder and
[2243.64 - 2247.52] infect it get it to spasm like hell for
[2245.92 - 2249.16] a long time until the body can
[2247.52 - 2250.88] overcompensate and clean it up and
[2249.16 - 2254.32] sometimes it can't and then surgeons
[2250.88 - 2254.32] have to remove the gallbladder if food
[2254.76 - 2257.80] poisoning I'm drinking cucumber juice
[2257.12 - 2260.76] right
[2257.80 - 2263.24] now by the way just kind of sipping it
[2260.76 - 2265.68] in between a little
[2263.24 - 2267.92] bit cucumber juice why would I be
[2265.68 - 2270.12] drinking cucumber juice on a day we're
[2267.92 - 2271.16] doing gallbladder because cucumber juice
[2270.12 - 2273.64] helps to
[2271.16 - 2275.72] dissolve gallbladder stones but it does
[2273.64 - 2277.40] more than that it helps to alleviate
[2275.72 - 2278.84] sludge out of the liver in a different
[2277.40 - 2280.52] way that it doesn't have to back up
[2278.84 - 2283.20] Purge back up into the gallbladder sit
[2280.52 - 2285.84] there and settle into a pile of Gunk
[2283.20 - 2287.48] pile of engine oil in that
[2285.84 - 2289.36] gallbladder that's almost like the
[2287.48 - 2293.40] gallbladder is the bottom of the pan of
[2289.36 - 2293.40] an a car oil
[2293.96 - 2302.08] pan and um you know what happens what
[2297.84 - 2304.16] happens here what happens here is that
[2302.08 - 2306.60] food poisoning is one thing that's one
[2304.16 - 2308.24] thing but also eoli that sits inside our
[2306.60 - 2310.12] intestinal tract long term or strep or
[2308.24 - 2311.72] ecoli especially ecoli too you know they
[2310.12 - 2313.56] sit in our intestinal tract for long
[2311.72 - 2315.68] term and if they break out and you get
[2313.56 - 2317.36] gastritis and they kind of bubbles up
[2315.68 - 2319.32] and breaks out in your intestinal tract
[2317.36 - 2320.84] and you got a bout of gastritis you
[2319.32 - 2323.04] could always get in trouble with your
[2320.84 - 2325.52] gallbladder and appendix
[2323.04 - 2327.48] too so we want to just take care of
[2325.52 - 2329.08] things the liver tries to trap as much
[2327.48 - 2330.72] bacteria and pathogens as it can
[2329.08 - 2334.20] possibly
[2330.72 - 2338.08] trap the liver's immune system tries to
[2334.20 - 2341.32] destroy as much bacteria as possible
[2338.08 - 2344.16] you know I'm not a what is it uh
[2341.32 - 2346.92] confrontational kind of guy at all you
[2344.16 - 2351.04] know I'm not one of those guys um you
[2346.92 - 2353.00] know with going going uh going all these
[2351.04 - 2355.84] years with hearing spirit's
[2353.00 - 2357.44] voice and helping people you know I mean
[2355.84 - 2358.72] there's been times over the years where
[2357.44 - 2361.40] people are just in
[2358.72 - 2363.20] disbelief that they're even healing from
[2361.40 - 2364.40] the information you know I remember when
[2363.20 - 2365.68] I was younger years and years ago
[2364.40 - 2367.16] getting people that were healing and
[2365.68 - 2369.08] still they can't believe I'm hearing the
[2367.16 - 2370.68] voice and giving them the advice that's
[2369.08 - 2372.80] actually getting them better they just
[2370.68 - 2374.76] think it's some kind of fluke I've
[2372.80 - 2376.04] remembered cases like that once in a
[2374.76 - 2378.76] while every now and
[2376.04 - 2380.88] then and I even remember confrontation
[2378.76 - 2384.64] when I was younger too every now and
[2380.88 - 2387.28] then I remember this one one case going
[2384.64 - 2391.12] all the way back I think I was 18 years
[2387.28 - 2393.36] old and um this woman came to me no
[2391.12 - 2396.08] doctor would listen she was so fatigued
[2393.36 - 2397.52] she couldn't just get out of bed it took
[2396.08 - 2400.12] everything everything she had to get to
[2397.52 - 2401.12] the office everything she had to get to
[2400.12 - 2403.04] the
[2401.12 - 2407.24] office and
[2403.04 - 2409.20] um and she she had New Hope Spirit found
[2407.24 - 2410.80] a virus that she was suffering with she
[2409.20 - 2412.28] had severe chronic fatigue from a
[2410.80 - 2415.12] neurological
[2412.28 - 2417.76] virus and it was inflaming everything in
[2415.12 - 2420.08] her body she was she was literally at 40
[2417.76 - 2422.76] or 50 doctors best clinics across the
[2420.08 - 2424.36] country this is a you know long time ago
[2422.76 - 2427.12] before the world has changed and before
[2424.36 - 2429.24] the internet uh turned into the internet
[2427.12 - 2431.32] and everything else before there was an
[2429.24 - 2434.60] internet I'm sorry before before there
[2431.32 - 2437.08] was an internet when I remember she was
[2434.60 - 2439.72] recovering first time first time in
[2437.08 - 2441.84] years recovering she can get out of bed
[2439.72 - 2445.24] and start recovering and her husband was
[2441.84 - 2448.24] mad angry because I wasn't a medical
[2445.24 - 2450.52] doctor cuz I was a medical medium the
[2448.24 - 2452.52] medical medium so I remember he came to
[2450.52 - 2455.32] the office by
[2452.52 - 2457.84] himself and and she was recovering and
[2455.32 - 2459.00] he came to the office all disgruntled
[2457.84 - 2461.72] all
[2459.00 - 2465.96] angry and he said that uh he didn't he
[2461.72 - 2467.80] didn't want her coming anymore to uh for
[2465.96 - 2469.00] appointments even though she was getting
[2467.80 - 2470.64] better and he admitted she's getting
[2469.00 - 2471.92] better but but there was something
[2470.64 - 2474.36] inside of him that just couldn't stand
[2471.92 - 2477.68] the fact that it was it was the medium
[2474.36 - 2480.44] thing couldn't stand it so he hindered
[2477.68 - 2482.76] her healing hindered her healing I
[2480.44 - 2484.88] didn't know she overcame it and took the
[2482.76 - 2489.48] advice and
[2484.88 - 2492.64] recovered and um but she had such more
[2489.48 - 2496.16] more more more you know struggles
[2492.64 - 2498.52] because of the delay of the
[2496.16 - 2500.16] hindrance and so confrontation is
[2498.52 - 2503.04] something I don't like and what happens
[2500.16 - 2504.92] is that when the liver is under
[2503.04 - 2506.56] confrontation cuz that's what happening
[2504.92 - 2508.68] all the time the liver it's under
[2506.56 - 2510.28] confrontation non-stop it's under
[2508.68 - 2513.48] confrontation with with a diet that
[2510.28 - 2515.76] we're under it's under stress it's under
[2513.48 - 2518.72] it's constantly being attacked it's
[2515.76 - 2522.44] constantly being braided it's constantly
[2518.72 - 2524.84] being antagon you know antagonized it's
[2522.44 - 2526.64] constantly being irritated you know
[2524.84 - 2530.00] livers up against a tremendous amount of
[2526.64 - 2531.68] that all the time so it it it it breaks
[2530.00 - 2534.52] its ability down to do what it's got to
[2531.68 - 2536.44] do it's got an immune system that wants
[2534.52 - 2538.52] to seek and
[2536.44 - 2541.32] destroy the liver has its own immune
[2538.52 - 2544.40] system that wants to Seek and
[2541.32 - 2546.36] Destroy pathogens but when constantly
[2544.40 - 2548.68] you know the confrontation involved it
[2546.36 - 2551.44] it could Sidetrack it confrontation
[2548.68 - 2553.12] meaning eating the wrong Foods
[2551.44 - 2554.56] tremendous amount of adrenaline in your
[2553.12 - 2556.88] life tons of
[2554.56 - 2560.44] stress and then it it it can't send the
[2556.88 - 2562.88] soldiers out the liver takes has no
[2560.44 - 2564.92] mercy it takes no mercy it is an immune
[2562.88 - 2566.60] system designed to
[2564.92 - 2572.48] destroy
[2566.60 - 2574.40] kill yeah yeah that's right that's right
[2572.48 - 2576.40] it's not weak in that
[2574.40 - 2578.52] nature you know it doesn't like
[2576.40 - 2582.56] conversation on any L level it doesn't
[2578.52 - 2584.68] like problems but it's not it won't back
[2582.56 - 2586.40] down it won't back down unless it's
[2584.68 - 2587.44] forced to and it's getting sidetracked
[2586.40 - 2590.20] to that
[2587.44 - 2592.68] degree and um so I always think about
[2590.20 - 2594.48] that you know I I I I just want
[2592.68 - 2596.48] everybody happy since I was a kid I want
[2594.48 - 2599.36] everybody happy I want everybody healing
[2596.48 - 2600.84] and I want everybody happy uh and even
[2599.36 - 2602.40] even as a kid I used to say the spirit
[2600.84 - 2604.56] why is this person disgruntled when
[2602.40 - 2607.64] their most beloved person in their
[2604.56 - 2610.60] family is so it's getting so much better
[2607.64 - 2613.16] he's been so sick and spirit would say
[2610.60 - 2615.36] well you know it's it's like ego stuff
[2613.16 - 2617.08] and it's it's jealousy stuff it's just
[2615.36 - 2618.24] weird stuff it's a whole pile of just
[2617.08 - 2622.28] emotional
[2618.24 - 2623.56] damage emotional damage and I said well
[2622.28 - 2625.40] you know it's amazing because you know
[2623.56 - 2627.32] and that reminded me of people's
[2625.40 - 2629.32] livers people's
[2627.32 - 2630.80] livers you know what's getting in the
[2629.32 - 2633.60] way of people doing the right thing for
[2630.80 - 2637.80] their liver a lot of bad information and
[2633.60 - 2640.64] misinformation out there that has those
[2637.80 - 2642.20] things attached to it like ego and and
[2640.64 - 2643.56] all kinds of different things and
[2642.20 - 2644.80] agendas and everything else that are
[2643.56 - 2647.00] going on and it gets in the way of
[2644.80 - 2648.32] people healing gets in the PE it gets in
[2647.00 - 2649.92] the way of people ever protecting their
[2648.32 - 2652.68] liver protecting their liver healing the
[2649.92 - 2654.12] liver looking after their liver and a
[2652.68 - 2655.64] liver needs help and it needs that
[2654.12 - 2657.28] attention it needs that attention and
[2655.64 - 2659.56] this this woman
[2657.28 - 2661.48] actually I mean this was this was
[2659.56 - 2664.32] horrific what she was going through
[2661.48 - 2666.60] horrific and healing for the first time
[2664.32 - 2669.20] she just needed she just need needed
[2666.60 - 2670.64] some of that information the liver just
[2669.20 - 2672.92] needs some
[2670.64 - 2674.80] attention needs some attention so it
[2672.92 - 2678.72] could do what you you need to do her
[2674.80 - 2680.60] immune system needed a little bit of
[2678.72 - 2682.12] caring a little bit of compassion a
[2680.60 - 2684.96] little bit of the right information for
[2682.12 - 2686.64] the first time in her her life so that
[2684.96 - 2688.00] her immune system could go and seek out
[2686.64 - 2689.84] and Destroy and do what it needs to do
[2688.00 - 2691.24] and not get sidetracked the liver needs
[2689.84 - 2693.60] a same thing it's got an immune system
[2691.24 - 2696.68] that wants to Seek and Destroy and kill
[2693.60 - 2698.52] things but it gets sidetracked so
[2696.68 - 2700.00] confrontation is not good no matter what
[2698.52 - 2701.92] in in you know when it comes down to
[2700.00 - 2703.96] healing and so many people have to deal
[2701.92 - 2706.52] with
[2703.96 - 2708.08] it so what do we do we want to dissolve
[2706.52 - 2709.84] Stones we want to clean up the liver we
[2708.08 - 2711.68] want to do the right things low protein
[2709.84 - 2713.92] diet low protein diet you think you got
[2711.68 - 2716.68] a liver thing developing low protein
[2713.92 - 2719.44] diet why cuz it's lowfat lowfat diet
[2716.68 - 2721.80] lowfat if you're a vegan cut back on the
[2719.44 - 2723.72] nuts cut back on the nuts and seeds too
[2721.80 - 2726.16] many nuts too many seeds nut pies
[2723.72 - 2727.80] nutcakes whatever I even if you're all
[2726.16 - 2729.80] whatever and I respect that I love it I
[2727.80 - 2732.28] love raw vegan stuff I love raw
[2729.80 - 2734.52] plant-based I'm totally behind that 100%
[2732.28 - 2736.24] oh my God I've seen people I've seen
[2734.52 - 2739.76] people get rid of the worst diseases
[2736.24 - 2743.92] ever in history with those the 28-day
[2739.76 - 2748.52] cleanse the 28 day cleanse in my book
[2743.92 - 2752.24] one is literally 28 days of low to no
[2748.52 - 2756.40] fat plant-based mostly
[2752.24 - 2759.16] raw why to to get the liver
[2756.40 - 2761.56] to where it needs to be to get the liver
[2759.16 - 2763.60] to do more than to dissolve stones to
[2761.56 - 2765.64] dissolve stones for God's sake to get
[2763.60 - 2767.52] the liver in a better place doesn't mean
[2765.64 - 2769.24] I'm anti-animal protein or anything if
[2767.52 - 2771.88] somebody wants to eat animal
[2769.24 - 2774.24] protein but when somebody's doing these
[2771.88 - 2775.64] gallbladder flushes and then going after
[2774.24 - 2777.64] the gallbladder flesh they're eating all
[2775.64 - 2780.44] this animal protein a week later and
[2777.64 - 2783.04] they're pounding that liver down that
[2780.44 - 2785.24] liver the amount of bile it has to
[2783.04 - 2787.68] produce is unbelievable to break down
[2785.24 - 2790.76] fat and animal fat and animal protein
[2787.68 - 2794.32] and and forget the animal stuff that
[2790.76 - 2797.40] liver has to do so much to break down
[2794.32 - 2800.52] plant fat like nuts tons and tons of
[2797.40 - 2802.12] nuts and oils so if a vegan also a
[2800.52 - 2804.80] plant-based person is eating of
[2802.12 - 2807.32] vegetarians eating still all this fat
[2804.80 - 2809.32] constantly eating tons of it the liver
[2807.32 - 2812.00] still has to produce tremendous amounts
[2809.32 - 2813.00] of bile salt the pressure and the stress
[2812.00 - 2815.60] it goes
[2813.00 - 2817.12] under is ridiculous he can't dissolve
[2815.60 - 2818.76] stuff Stones Under that you can't clean
[2817.12 - 2821.20] up the sludge at the bottom of the
[2818.76 - 2823.40] gallbladder the bottom of the oil pan
[2821.20 - 2825.88] you can't you can't do
[2823.40 - 2827.56] that and if you're eating animal protein
[2825.88 - 2828.88] and you dropped your carbs fine okay you
[2827.56 - 2831.32] dropped chocolate cake that's the best
[2828.88 - 2832.96] thing you can do that's great but yet
[2831.32 - 2834.76] you're just doing vegetables and lots of
[2832.96 - 2836.44] animal fat without realizing it is your
[2834.76 - 2839.36] calorie to survive because of some
[2836.44 - 2841.44] trendy diet out there from somebody that
[2839.36 - 2843.68] knows absolutely nothing about the liver
[2841.44 - 2845.56] because that's what I've seen that's
[2843.68 - 2846.28] what I've seen even the best experts out
[2845.56 - 2848.28] there
[2846.28 - 2850.92] with the fanciest diets know nothing
[2848.28 - 2852.76] about the liver I'm sorry they just
[2850.92 - 2854.56] don't I know I sound like Brash or
[2852.76 - 2856.72] boasting I don't even know what it
[2854.56 - 2859.64] sounds like but it's it's legit it's
[2856.72 - 2862.20] what it is that's what it is I know I
[2859.64 - 2864.08] sound uh pointy about it I get it I get
[2862.20 - 2865.84] it I can't help it I can't help it
[2864.08 - 2867.76] sometimes because I just want people

[3117.76 - 3121.84] your diet in your life the poisons that
[3119.76 - 3124.04] are inside the liver that inherited from
[3121.84 - 3125.68] your parents all the way down and that
[3124.04 - 3127.60] liver is so filled up with poisons it's
[3125.68 - 3128.88] unbelievable and it strains all night
[3127.60 - 3130.20] and it has to work all night while
[3128.88 - 3132.08] you're sleeping and in the morning what
[3130.20 - 3133.12] do we do we put something in there like
[3132.08 - 3135.28] an
[3133.12 - 3138.08] egg and we're going to end up with a
[3135.28 - 3140.12] cholesterol Stone I'm sorry maybe not
[3138.08 - 3141.68] now maybe you're exercising and you're
[3140.12 - 3143.56] losing weight and you're on this new

[3201.96 - 3206.56] that that no one wants to analyze the
[3204.24 - 3208.36] gunk inside a gallbladder and nobody
[3206.56 - 3210.84] wants to look into cuz it's like dirt
[3208.36 - 3212.52] looking in a dirty closet it's like the
[3210.84 - 3214.16] medical industry looking in a dirty
[3212.52 - 3216.12] closet and analyzing what's in there and
