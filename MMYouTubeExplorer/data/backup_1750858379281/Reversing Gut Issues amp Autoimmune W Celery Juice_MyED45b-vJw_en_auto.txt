[45.52 - 50.64] here now wait oh yep oh trash cans
[48.88 - 52.40] falling apart
[50.64 - 54.64] well let me tell you something because
[52.40 - 56.40] what happens is people don't realize it
[54.64 - 58.24] but they're dumping all kinds of stuff
[56.40 - 60.88] in their trash can every single day
[58.24 - 63.52] right and it's like nah nah nah i'll eat
[60.88 - 65.68] better tomorrow i'll eat better later
[63.52 - 67.84] i'll eat better another day
[65.68 - 70.16] maybe i'll eat better i'll eat better

[70.16 - 75.60] guys when's january 1st
[72.40 - 78.24] when is it like 11 months from now i'll
[75.60 - 80.40] start then i'll start january 1st i
[78.24 - 82.48] missed this january 1st

[82.48 - 86.48] i'll just go for the rest of the year
[84.08 - 87.52] and then maybe i'll start working on my
[86.48 - 91.80] diet
[87.52 - 91.80] january 1st 2023
[92.64 - 95.36] but anyway
[94.08 - 96.56] talking about the gut we're talking
[95.36 - 98.08] about what's going on with the gut
[96.56 - 99.52] everybody's got why there's problems why
[98.08 - 101.52] there's not problems and everything talk
[99.52 - 104.48] about autoimmune
[101.52 - 109.20] because autoimmune
[104.48 - 112.24] isn't related to your gut so much
[109.20 - 113.12] but yet autoimmune tends to get worse
[112.24 - 115.04] right
[113.12 - 117.04] as we're dumping all kinds of stuff and
[115.04 - 118.72] garbage in our guts but there's the
[117.04 - 119.92] relations are not what people think
[118.72 - 121.84] we're going to cover that for a little
[119.92 - 125.60] bit too you guys
[121.84 - 126.72] the mm-900 hds is on sale not for much
[125.60 - 130.16] longer
[126.72 - 131.60] and you'll see okay at omegajuicers.com
[130.16 - 134.32] right you'll see the link in the profile
[131.60 - 136.00] link in the description okay when you
[134.32 - 137.76] put the juice when you when you put the
[136.00 - 139.44] juicer in your cart
[137.76 - 142.40] and then you check out you'll see it
[139.44 - 145.68] automatically come up 71
[142.40 - 148.24] 98 cents savings
[145.68 - 149.92] and food food is going up food prices
[148.24 - 151.20] i'm hearing every day people i know
[149.92 - 152.96] they're like oh my god you know what the
[151.20 - 154.24] food cost me the other day
[152.96 - 156.88] you know what all that you know what all
[154.24 - 158.24] that meat cost me the other day you know
[156.88 - 161.28] you know what everything cost me the
[158.24 - 162.08] other day food's going up up up
[161.28 - 164.32] but
[162.08 - 166.32] when food goes up prices go right food
[164.32 - 167.84] food prices go up food shortages happen
[166.32 - 169.44] food prices go up whatever is happening
[167.84 - 170.64] right now inflation's happening right
[169.44 - 172.48] all of that
[170.64 - 174.72] and so what i like about the mm-900 you
[172.48 - 176.40] squeeze more juice out people swear by
[174.72 - 178.88] it i swear by it you squeeze more juice
[176.40 - 180.48] out you save a lot of money as the year
[178.88 - 182.00] goes on you save more money you save
[180.48 - 184.32] more money i'm gonna juice some celery
[182.00 - 186.00] because celery juice is critical for the
[184.32 - 187.28] trash can
[186.00 - 190.08] because what that's what's happening
[187.28 - 192.00] with everybody we're dumping crap in our
[190.08 - 193.68] trash can all the time
[192.00 - 195.04] how many of these have you had maybe it
[193.68 - 196.72] doesn't look like this maybe it was
[195.04 - 198.40] different maybe it was homemade maybe it
[196.72 - 201.12] was some other kind of way you did it
[198.40 - 203.28] but we we really filled that can
[201.12 - 205.68] how many diners have you how many people
[203.28 - 207.60] were shit-faced during college and maybe
[205.68 - 209.12] maybe even after college whatever and
[207.60 - 210.80] they're in the diner and they're tanking
[209.12 - 212.32] a whole bunch of bacon a whole bunch of
[210.80 - 214.00] stuff and everything else how many
[212.32 - 215.20] people are doing that right all this
[214.00 - 217.20] time
[215.20 - 219.12] and so and it's not even just that it's
[217.20 - 221.60] pizza every day it's everything else
[219.12 - 224.08] kelly beeton says love my juicer
[221.60 - 226.64] it's incredible really the mm-900 hds
[224.08 - 230.00] we're gonna juice some celery juice
[226.64 - 231.44] celery juice is a powerhouse it's not a
[230.00 - 233.16] joke
[231.44 - 234.96] hey you know what's really screwed up

[251.28 - 256.96] who's who and relevant or whatever and
[254.64 - 259.28] they're all drinking celery juice
[256.96 - 262.48] but they don't show it
[259.28 - 264.08] but you catch them all the time
[262.48 - 266.40] you see their celery juice in their
[264.08 - 268.72] kitchen counter during a pick
[266.40 - 269.60] maybe a selfie whatever that they they
[268.72 - 271.60] post

[302.00 - 305.12] of a whole crowd of people that i'm
[303.60 - 306.48] around every day they're not saying that
[305.12 - 308.24] either they're not saying if i didn't
[306.48 - 309.68] have celery juice
[308.24 - 311.12] these hemorrhoids wouldn't have gone

[311.12 - 314.00] you know they don't see any of that they
[312.80 - 315.36] don't see any of that and that's what's
[314.00 - 317.92] incredible and
[315.36 - 320.00] but it's like everybody who's who's who
[317.92 - 323.28] right on social media whether it's tick

[369.12 - 373.12] to go downhill again with my health
[371.36 - 374.64] my functional medicine doctor said i'm
[373.12 - 376.72] doing better than ever and it's because
[374.64 - 379.20] of my celery juice everybody i know
[376.72 - 381.20] knows i drink celery juice but yeah i
[379.20 - 382.40] won't talk about it i hide it because
[381.20 - 385.12] i'm not gonna
[382.40 - 386.96] allow someone else to learn about it you
[385.12 - 389.20] know so they can save their butts
[386.96 - 391.20] because it's all about me me me me me
[389.20 - 393.92] it's all about me and my selfies it's
[391.20 - 396.24] all about me and my thing here i am now
[393.92 - 398.48] i'm on the beach everybody here we go
[396.24 - 400.32] this is my lifestyle this is what i'm
[398.48 - 401.76] doing you think anybody really gives a
[400.32 - 404.08]  about anybody's chronically ill
[401.76 - 406.08] that could be like wait a minute celery
[404.08 - 407.04] juice i heard about it does it really
[406.08 - 409.44] work
[407.04 - 411.92] yeah it really works right
[409.44 - 414.56] but hey that's how it works out there
[411.92 - 417.16] the sales on a couple more days on the
[414.56 - 419.60] mm-900
[417.16 - 422.32] 71.98 i told you guys i would never talk
[419.60 - 423.36] about that juicer unless it was on sale
[422.32 - 424.64] because
[423.36 - 425.92] that's the bottom line i want you to be
[424.64 - 427.68] able to afford it i want you to be able
[425.92 - 429.20] to be able to get it if you need to get
[427.68 - 431.12] if you're using some other juicer use it
[429.20 - 432.56] if you've got a juicer that you're using
[431.12 - 434.40] keep it and use it i'm going to talk
[432.56 - 436.32] about how that saves us money
[434.40 - 437.60] what that does what celery juice does
[436.32 - 439.68] and how critical that is i'm talking
[437.60 - 441.68] about the trash can right now too
[439.68 - 444.24] because what we do is we dump all kinds
[441.68 - 445.20] of stuff inside this trash can
[444.24 - 447.44] and
[445.20 - 450.24] this trash can is important to us right
[447.44 - 452.72] here this is not the normal trash can
[450.24 - 455.36] this one's important to us
[452.72 - 456.40] we beat down and kill our livers is what
[455.36 - 458.64] we do
[456.40 - 460.48] we blow up our stomachs and destroy our
[458.64 - 462.00] stomachs and stomach glands is what we
[460.48 - 465.60] do okay
[462.00 - 468.48] we injure and and annihilate our colons
[465.60 - 470.72] too is what we do boom right we kill our
[468.48 - 472.88] small intestinal tracts we don't even
[470.72 - 475.60] know it boom right
[472.88 - 478.16] and we become a mess is what happens
[475.60 - 480.72] everything ferments in here everything
[478.16 - 482.88] starts to fall apart in here we got
[480.72 - 484.56] resilience your body's got resilience
[482.88 - 487.12] right we can
[484.56 - 490.48] our bodies are tough our bodies want to
[487.12 - 492.96] recover they want to do the right thing
[490.48 - 494.48] but we tend to
[492.96 - 496.80] through just the course of life because
[494.48 - 498.80] life is hard life is not easy we tend to
[496.80 - 500.08] do things that we're not supposed to hey
[498.80 - 501.92] we're not taught
[500.08 - 503.28] no one's being taught to do things that
[501.92 - 504.56] can be really helpful instead they're
[503.28 - 506.08] being taught to do something that's
[504.56 - 507.68] actually harmful that happens all the
[506.08 - 509.44] time you guys know i talk about that all
[507.68 - 511.84] the time out there
[509.44 - 513.60] so let's go into it a little bit right
[511.84 - 514.80] your stomach
[513.60 - 515.84] critical
[514.80 - 518.00] organ
[515.84 - 520.32] right there your stomach is critical so
[518.00 - 523.04] let's go into that a little bit so when
[520.32 - 524.64] it comes down to your stomach right
[523.04 - 525.60] one thing that's really important to
[524.64 - 527.44] know
[525.60 - 529.36] is we can destroy the stump the stomach
[527.44 - 531.68] glands inside your stomach these little
[529.36 - 533.36] glands that produce your gastric acid
[531.68 - 534.48] your gastric acid is your defense
[533.36 - 536.88] mechanism
[534.48 - 539.36] to stop the bugs
[536.88 - 541.68] if your hydrochloric acid is really
[539.36 - 544.00] strong
[541.68 - 545.52] really strong
[544.00 - 547.68] it will kill
[545.52 - 551.28] a case of mono
[547.68 - 553.32] before the mono can even start
[551.28 - 555.52] so if you kiss somebody with
[553.32 - 557.28] mononucleosis which is epstein-barr
[555.52 - 559.12] fresh infection
[557.28 - 561.36] and you kiss them
[559.12 - 563.36] and they pass that epstein-barr virus
[561.36 - 565.12] into your mouth
[563.36 - 566.56] as you're kissing them
[565.12 - 569.76] you're making out with them that
[566.56 - 570.72] epstein-barr virus goes into your mouth
[569.76 - 571.92] say you're just drinking off of
[570.72 - 573.52] somebody's glass yeah i'll share that
[571.92 - 574.56] glass with you
[573.52 - 578.40] sure
[574.56 - 582.72] right and boom now you got mononucleosis
[578.40 - 585.12] if your hcl is strong really strong
[582.72 - 587.12] it will kill and destroy that
[585.12 - 589.52] epstein-barr virus before it can take
[587.12 - 591.60] hold or take root
[589.52 - 594.80] so as that epstein-barr virus
[591.60 - 596.72] goes into the mouth into your spit
[594.80 - 599.84] and then you swallow that epstein-barr
[596.72 - 601.92] virus with your spit down your esophagus
[599.84 - 604.64] down your throat down your esophagus and
[601.92 - 606.88] that spit ends up inside your stomach
[604.64 - 609.28] with an epstein-barr virus
[606.88 - 613.04] your hcl will kill the epstein-barr
[609.28 - 613.04] virus so you don't catch mono
[613.60 - 619.68] but no one's stomach acid is that strong
[616.96 - 623.20] no one's gastric glands are that strong
[619.68 - 625.84] it's rare really rare the world beats us
[623.20 - 628.08] down the bad food beats us down
[625.84 - 630.40] life beats us down
[628.08 - 632.48] all kinds of things beat us down vinegar
[630.40 - 634.96] can kill that uh that opportunity for
[632.48 - 636.72] anybody if you're tank and vinegar
[634.96 - 639.12] apple cider vinegar is so good for you
[636.72 - 641.52] meanwhile boom you destroy your stomach
[639.12 - 642.72] lands and then the toxic fragrances beat
[641.52 - 646.80] our own
[642.72 - 650.00] body systems down the chemical warfare
[646.80 - 652.72] the sea trails beat us down not allowed
[650.00 - 655.36] to say that word you know there's
[652.72 - 657.76] so much that breaks us down the mosquito
[655.36 - 660.64] spray they spray on every state in the
[657.76 - 662.88] united states every town every village
[660.64 - 666.48] in the united states they dump mosquito
[662.88 - 669.36] spray on it all year long out of
[666.48 - 671.44] helicopters on your children on your
[669.36 - 672.96] babies on you
[671.44 - 674.32] purposely
[672.96 - 676.08] it's nothing to do with mosquitoes
[674.32 - 679.44] because mosquitoes never die
[676.08 - 681.44] mosquitoes are there for eternity
[679.44 - 682.88] the point is we're up against so much
[681.44 - 684.40] and it beats down our systems this is

[816.40 - 820.72] there's a ton of juicers out there
[818.88 - 822.08] there's a difference here a big
[820.72 - 824.80] difference that's why an indoor that's
[822.08 - 827.44] why i endorsed it huge difference

[834.00 - 838.52] is toxic to the body the metal gears and
[837.36 - 841.12] juicers
[838.52 - 843.52] intoxicate you
[841.12 - 845.60] over time if you're drinking your green
[843.52 - 847.44] juice
[845.60 - 849.20] you've got your metal gears grinding
[847.44 - 850.88] against each other you're getting little
[849.20 - 852.32] specks of metal

[852.32 - 855.20] juice if you're doing it getting all

[856.32 - 859.04] little specks of metal because you're
[857.36 - 861.20] drinking your green juice
[859.04 - 863.36] what i love about the mm-900 it doesn't
[861.20 - 865.12] do that you don't have the metal gears
[863.36 - 868.00] grinding against each other that's
[865.12 - 868.96] critical to know right there
[868.00 - 871.44] one
[868.96 - 872.56] important reason to drink celery juice
[871.44 - 875.68] i'm going to tell you right now is
[872.56 - 877.20] when's your last blood test when was it
[875.68 - 879.76] on tick tock when was your last blood
[877.20 - 882.48] test just so you know telegram when was
[879.76 - 885.84] your last blood test
[882.48 - 887.68] facebook youtube right rumble
[885.84 - 888.80] rumble when's the last blood test you
[887.68 - 891.76] had
[888.80 - 894.72] when they draw your blood
[891.76 - 897.20] they take critical
[894.72 - 899.52] nutrients out
[897.20 - 901.28] we get deficiencies from our blood draws
[899.52 - 903.68] that's why the medical mean podcast at
[901.28 - 906.48] apple podcast the blood draw vampire
[903.68 - 908.16] blood draw right bloodletting episode i
[906.48 - 909.76] talk about how you have to ask for half
[908.16 - 911.12] files how you have to ask for quarter
[909.76 - 912.80] vials you have to have the phlebotomist
[911.12 - 914.48] for half aisles you gotta be very
[912.80 - 915.84] careful because they will bleed you to
[914.48 - 917.36] death that's why so many people with
[915.84 - 918.80] lyme disease have died over the years
[917.36 - 920.08] because they were bled to death so many
[918.80 - 921.92] people with cancer died early because
[920.08 - 924.16] they were bled to death so many people
[921.92 - 925.76] with diseases and autoimmune get sick
[924.16 - 928.08] they're bedridden because they're bled
[925.76 - 931.28] and blood and blood people now are bled
[928.08 - 933.60] every minute when's your last blood test
[931.28 - 935.12] if you're getting routine blood work and
[933.60 - 936.88] you're not doing it right and even if
[935.12 - 938.32] you were kind of doing it right if
[936.88 - 939.76] you're getting routine blood work for
[938.32 - 940.88] mystery issues
[939.76 - 942.56] because that's what people do they get
[940.88 - 944.32] routine blood work over and over again
[942.56 - 945.76] for mystery issues you're losing all
[944.32 - 948.32] these critical electrolytes trace
[945.76 - 949.92] minerals you're losing things that keep
[948.32 - 953.36] your brain healthy your body healthy
[949.92 - 953.36] you're losing critical things
[953.84 - 957.04] celery juice
[955.28 - 959.44] helps to bring that back if you're
[957.04 - 962.48] somebody that had two blood tests two
[959.44 - 965.36] blood tests this year celery juice helps
[962.48 - 967.28] to bring you back you don't ever recover
[965.36 - 969.60] from blood leading
[967.28 - 972.24] they take the blood from you it can take
[969.60 - 974.24] six months to recover your white blood
[972.24 - 976.96] cells just so you know we're where the
[974.24 - 978.88] white blood cells right there
[976.96 - 980.56] takes six months to recover your white
[978.88 - 983.04] blood cells that's why celery juice is
[980.56 - 987.44] critical all on its own
[983.04 - 987.44] green juice isn't gonna do that
[987.84 - 992.96] celery juice does that the trace mineral
[991.20 - 994.72] salts the sodium cluster salts it's one
[992.96 - 997.92] aspect of celery juice really important
[994.72 - 999.76] to know most people already have a
[997.92 - 1001.44] weakened broken down immune system and
[999.76 - 1003.20] they're getting blood work over and over
[1001.44 - 1005.04] again and it's weakening more weakening
[1003.20 - 1007.12] them more and they're not getting any
[1005.04 - 1009.92] celery juice in you the one way to
[1007.12 - 1012.32] escape that torturous situation of being
[1009.92 - 1014.32] in a vicious cycle of getting your life
[1012.32 - 1015.84] robbed from you from blood taken from
[1014.32 - 1018.32] you is making sure you're putting
[1015.84 - 1020.08] something back in to save your life and
[1018.32 - 1022.48] that's why celery juice is critical you
[1020.08 - 1024.64] had a blood test once every year
[1022.48 - 1027.12] you still need the celery juice
[1024.64 - 1029.20] georgiana says you had it in september
[1027.12 - 1031.04] right sarah says yes six months to a
[1029.20 - 1033.44] year you get your blood work
[1031.04 - 1035.68] they pull the blood out of you you get
[1033.44 - 1038.72] weakened from it and we don't put
[1035.68 - 1041.68] anything back to try to curve that
[1038.72 - 1043.60] balance to try to shape that balance is
[1041.68 - 1045.76] what happens it's very important to know
[1043.60 - 1049.28] that's one reason celery juice is
[1045.76 - 1051.12] critical but one really important reason
[1049.28 - 1053.12] it really is

[1183.60 - 1189.68] on how do i either the whole thing so
[1186.32 - 1192.08] the mm-900 saves us a lot of money
[1189.68 - 1193.76] my family a lot of money that's what i
[1192.08 - 1194.72] love right that's why i endorse the
[1193.76 - 1196.64] machine
[1194.72 - 1198.24] so
[1196.64 - 1200.16] let's see if we got it plugged in right
[1198.24 - 1201.52] here we do what i love about it it's
[1200.16 - 1203.91] quiet
[1201.52 - 1206.08] it's quiet it's not going
[1203.91 - 1208.56] [Music]
[1206.08 - 1210.72] it's not doing something like that
[1208.56 - 1213.12] it's not making these crazy noises so
[1210.72 - 1215.76] what what happens is i'm up usually
[1213.12 - 1218.56] really late at night right i'm working
[1215.76 - 1221.84] working working or i get up really early
[1218.56 - 1223.60] in the morning or i never went to bed
[1221.84 - 1225.28] because i was working all night and i
[1223.60 - 1227.12] want to get the juicer going and i want
[1225.28 - 1229.20] to get the celery going so i'll start
[1227.12 - 1230.40] juicing at five in the morning six in
[1229.20 - 1232.40] the morning and i don't want to wake up
[1230.40 - 1234.24] the house this machine doesn't wake up
[1232.40 - 1236.24] the house and that's what's really
[1234.24 - 1239.76] important too it doesn't leak up
[1236.24 - 1241.44] everybody and that's that's a big deal
[1239.76 - 1243.92] so
[1241.44 - 1248.00] slow masticating juicer it's a cold
[1243.92 - 1248.00] pressed juicer that's what it is
[1248.04 - 1255.28] 71.98 off
[1251.20 - 1259.52] it's this is a medical device
[1255.28 - 1259.52] it's a medical device is what it is

[1335.68 - 1340.00] symptoms i got tingles and numbness
[1337.52 - 1342.64] aches and pains i got eye floaters my
[1340.00 - 1345.12] skin's getting really bad and chewed up
[1342.64 - 1347.20] i got acne i think it's acne the doctor
[1345.12 - 1349.28] doesn't know what it is that's bumping
[1347.20 - 1350.56] up on my face i got all these different
[1349.28 - 1352.48] problems
[1350.56 - 1354.48] maybe it's time to get
[1352.48 - 1356.00] a medical device
[1354.48 - 1357.84] in
[1356.00 - 1362.88] maybe i can get a medical device before
[1357.84 - 1366.00] someday i have to get a medical device
[1362.88 - 1367.84] the bummer kind of medical devices right
[1366.00 - 1369.44] something like that
[1367.84 - 1371.28] so
[1369.44 - 1373.12] one of the things i love about celery
[1371.28 - 1375.04] juice
[1373.12 - 1378.56] trace mineral salts
[1375.04 - 1380.56] get absorbed into your heart muscle
[1378.56 - 1382.00] muscles
[1380.56 - 1383.44] i know everybody's worried about muscles
[1382.00 - 1384.80] they're trying to build up their muscles
[1383.44 - 1386.80] dudes are always trying to build up
[1384.80 - 1388.56] their muscles right dudes are in the gym
[1386.80 - 1390.00] like if they can if they got the luxury
[1388.56 - 1391.76] and they don't have to work like a
[1390.00 - 1392.48] billion hours a week
[1391.76 - 1394.00] if
[1392.48 - 1395.60] if there are some dudes that got the
[1394.00 - 1397.36] luxury and they can work out in the gym
[1395.60 - 1399.12] every single day and they can go and do
[1397.36 - 1402.40] an hour or two in the gym they want to
[1399.12 - 1404.48] build up their muscles right
[1402.40 - 1406.64] well
[1404.48 - 1408.80] what happens is that trace mineral salts
[1406.64 - 1410.64] are critical for muscles to sustain
[1408.80 - 1412.72] themselves and build up your heart is a
[1410.64 - 1416.08] muscle so trace mineral salts from
[1412.72 - 1418.40] celery juice goes into the heart
[1416.08 - 1421.36] what i love about
[1418.40 - 1423.52] what i love about celery juice right
[1421.36 - 1426.56] it's the cleaner
[1423.52 - 1429.76] that goes into the heart valves and
[1426.56 - 1431.52] cleans the edges of the valves it cleans
[1429.76 - 1433.52] the edges
[1431.52 - 1435.20] so what it does is it cleans the edges
[1433.52 - 1437.92] of the valves
[1435.20 - 1439.68] the edges of the valves get gunked up
[1437.92 - 1442.24] like your drain you know what i mean so
[1439.68 - 1444.48] i got the sink right here okay
[1442.24 - 1446.64] i'm running it right now okay
[1444.48 - 1448.48] that water is going down the drain right
[1446.64 - 1451.76] now so on my in my sink right now the
[1448.48 - 1454.32] water's going down the drain okay
[1451.76 - 1456.48] what happens our bloodstream is our
[1454.32 - 1458.88] water right that's our bloodstream
[1456.48 - 1461.04] that's our water and it gets gunked up
[1458.88 - 1462.96] with toxins and garbage
[1461.04 - 1465.28] and as it gets gunked up with toxins and
[1462.96 - 1468.40] garbage it ends up in here ends up into
[1465.28 - 1469.84] the ventricles it ends up into the heart
[1468.40 - 1473.28] valves
[1469.84 - 1474.64] all that gunk ends up in there
[1473.28 - 1476.40] celery juice
[1474.64 - 1478.32] is that cleaner
[1476.40 - 1480.00] to the heart valves
[1478.32 - 1482.56] yeah you know if you're not that bad
[1480.00 - 1484.56] often you just get a better diet
[1482.56 - 1486.56] your blood pressure will go down you get
[1484.56 - 1488.48] rid of your processed food you should do
[1486.56 - 1490.56] all right but if you got bigger problems
[1488.48 - 1492.64] than that
[1490.56 - 1494.88] celery juice is critical for it or if
[1492.64 - 1497.92] you want to prevent bigger
[1494.88 - 1499.28] problems celery juice
[1497.92 - 1501.60] is there for you so that's something
[1499.28 - 1504.32] right there so i was going into
[1501.60 - 1506.08] going into the heart a little bit too so
[1504.32 - 1508.96] let's head into
[1506.08 - 1508.96] adrenals
[1509.04 - 1511.92] but you know what if we're going to go
[1510.48 - 1513.12] into the heart we're going to talk about
[1511.92 - 1515.84] veins and we're going to talk about
[1513.12 - 1517.36] arteries varicose veins
[1515.84 - 1519.68] all those veins
[1517.36 - 1521.84] right that nobody likes to get nobody
[1519.68 - 1524.16] likes to get those varicose veins nobody
[1521.84 - 1527.12] likes to get spider veins that's from
[1524.16 - 1528.80] the liver not being cleaned up
[1527.12 - 1530.72] for years and years everybody's on the
[1528.80 - 1533.44] high fat diets
[1530.72 - 1535.20] and the liver gets stagnant sluggish the
[1533.44 - 1537.76] liver gets toxic it's filled with
[1535.20 - 1539.68] pathogens and garbage and metals and
[1537.76 - 1541.20] what happens is your veins just start
[1539.68 - 1543.60] blowing up
[1541.20 - 1546.08] everybody's veins start blowing up they
[1543.60 - 1548.24] get the varicose veins they grow veins
[1546.08 - 1550.32] the veins start to expand the veins
[1548.24 - 1552.72] start to weaken the veins start to
[1550.32 - 1554.96] collapse as well that happens to people
[1552.72 - 1554.96] too
[1555.52 - 1560.48] elias says how much celery juice a day
[1558.00 - 1562.80] do you recommend 16 ounces on an empty
[1560.48 - 1565.60] stomach every single morning if you can
[1562.80 - 1568.64] i would go up to 32 ounces
[1565.60 - 1570.24] if you got some other stuff going on if
[1568.64 - 1572.24] you got some things happening in your
[1570.24 - 1573.68] life you want to push it up to 32 ounces
[1572.24 - 1576.08] now for years and years and years i said
[1573.68 - 1578.88] 16 ounces i've also told people they go
[1576.08 - 1581.04] to 32 to get 64 ounces you can do you do
[1578.88 - 1583.04] 64 ounces right
[1581.04 - 1584.16] and i told people to do that for years
[1583.04 - 1586.96] but i'm going to tell you right now the
[1584.16 - 1588.48] world is changing this world is becoming
[1586.96 - 1591.12] a very
[1588.48 - 1592.32] disturbing place for a lot of reasons
[1591.12 - 1595.76] right
[1592.32 - 1598.40] i won't go into a lot of those reasons
[1595.76 - 1600.88] because you can't you actually can't
[1598.40 - 1602.72] i'll lose all contact with your boss but
[1600.88 - 1604.64] what happens is the world is a really
[1602.72 - 1607.12] disturbing place
[1604.64 - 1609.04] and so our bodies are taking that heat
[1607.12 - 1610.56] for taking the stress they're taking the
[1609.04 - 1612.56] garbage and clothing around and taking
[1610.56 - 1613.92] the fragrances they're taking you know
[1612.56 - 1616.48] the chemicals are taking the
[1613.92 - 1618.16] insecticides right they're taking all
[1616.48 - 1619.44] this bad stuff all the time and that's
[1618.16 - 1622.32] what's happening they're taking
[1619.44 - 1624.08] everything out of the sun and so we also
[1622.32 - 1626.56] it's not even just about eating bad
[1624.08 - 1628.56] foods or eating good foods it eats more
[1626.56 - 1631.92] than that right truly disturbing i know
[1628.56 - 1634.88] the ring it's truly disturbing really
[1631.92 - 1637.44] what you'll notice about the mm-900
[1634.88 - 1640.08] it's quiet i can talk to you guys while
[1637.44 - 1642.32] juicing which is incredible so it's not
[1640.08 - 1644.08] like i'm screaming over you guys either
[1642.32 - 1646.08] right so we're live right now on tick
[1644.08 - 1648.08] tock live on rumble facebook youtube
[1646.08 - 1650.56] telegram
[1648.08 - 1652.08] debbie gale says no you want just celery
[1650.56 - 1653.36] juice with nothing at it don't add
[1652.08 - 1654.88] anything to your celery just do a
[1653.36 - 1656.80] separate juice
[1654.88 - 1659.20] do a separate juice now what i do with
[1656.80 - 1661.12] the mm-900 is i like to run greens
[1659.20 - 1663.68] through the mm-9002 so what i'll do is
[1661.12 - 1666.24] i'll do my celery juice now right i'll
[1663.68 - 1668.32] have my celery juice with nothing mixed
[1666.24 - 1669.84] into it no apples no greens no nothing
[1668.32 - 1672.96] mixed into it you want it to have the
[1669.84 - 1675.28] power it's an herb that has to be alone
[1672.96 - 1677.20] by itself to turn your life around to
[1675.28 - 1678.56] turn your life around you guys but what
[1677.20 - 1681.28] happens is
[1678.56 - 1683.36] i'll make another juice later with the
[1681.28 - 1685.28] mm 900
[1683.36 - 1687.28] i'll throw a couple of kale leaves in
[1685.28 - 1689.20] there and then throw some celery in
[1687.28 - 1690.96] there i'll throw some spinach in here
[1689.20 - 1692.64] some celery
[1690.96 - 1694.80] i'll throw i'll throw i'll throw some
[1692.64 - 1696.16] parsley in here and some celery
[1694.80 - 1697.60] it's incredible the machine is
[1696.16 - 1699.76] incredible so i like doing some leafy
[1697.60 - 1701.36] greens mixed with stuff but that is
[1699.76 - 1702.56] different medicine
[1701.36 - 1704.88] this is
[1702.56 - 1706.96] the medicine that changes lives and
[1704.88 - 1708.40] moves the needle when celery juice it's
[1706.96 - 1711.12] by itself
[1708.40 - 1712.56] nothing else compares
[1711.12 - 1713.68] and that's what's incredible about it
[1712.56 - 1717.20] that's why people are getting their
[1713.68 - 1717.20] lives back which is so nice
[1718.96 - 1724.48] so i just did some juicing right there
[1721.36 - 1726.64] i got a nice thing of juice
[1724.48 - 1728.08] it's not the most fibrous celery which
[1726.64 - 1730.00] is really great because you know you get
[1728.08 - 1733.04] less the fiber is not like filling up
[1730.00 - 1735.84] but the irony is
[1733.04 - 1737.20] that's my pulp
[1735.84 - 1740.08] do you guys see that
[1737.20 - 1741.60] that wasn't a camera trick
[1740.08 - 1743.20] it's not always like this there's just
[1741.60 - 1744.72] sometimes there's more pulp than this i
[1743.20 - 1746.40] mean you guys know with the mm-900 you
[1744.72 - 1747.84] get more pulp because the celery might
[1746.40 - 1749.68] have more fiber
[1747.84 - 1751.68] right but the point is is that's how
[1749.68 - 1753.52] insane that is
[1751.68 - 1756.48] i think about this
[1753.52 - 1758.88] right germ theory i know you always i
[1756.48 - 1760.48] know you're always talking smack about
[1758.88 - 1761.84] a medical medium all the time so it's
[1760.48 - 1763.60] still great to have you on here by the
[1761.84 - 1765.52] way but i know on youtube you always
[1763.60 - 1767.04] leave messages like
[1765.52 - 1768.96] the medical medium doesn't know what
[1767.04 - 1771.92] he's talking about
[1768.96 - 1774.40] medical medium has no idea how anything
[1771.92 - 1776.40] works the medical term theory it's good
[1774.40 - 1778.88] to have you here but your gym theory
[1776.40 - 1780.80] just so you know i'm holding
[1778.88 - 1783.60] pulp that's dry
[1780.80 - 1785.92] that's dry pulp okay it's not soaking
[1783.60 - 1787.84] wet like where you're squeezing
[1785.92 - 1789.12] constantly squeezing out juice or you're
[1787.84 - 1790.64] trying to run the pulp back in the
[1789.12 - 1792.56] machine right
[1790.64 - 1794.64] but that's dry pulp
[1792.56 - 1795.84] that's how you're saving money right
[1794.64 - 1797.76] there
[1795.84 - 1800.00] that's how you're saving money because
[1797.76 - 1801.68] you're you're buying less celery you're
[1800.00 - 1804.24] buying less greens if you want to do
[1801.68 - 1807.04] greens but you're buying less celery
[1804.24 - 1808.88] right but this is the celery juicer it's

[1967.68 - 1970.88] to the grocery store you see all those
[1968.80 - 1972.72] poor lobsters
[1970.88 - 1973.92] this poor lobsters
[1972.72 - 1976.00] sitting there
[1973.92 - 1978.40] they're all in there they were ripped
[1976.00 - 1980.64] out of the ocean
[1978.40 - 1982.64] they were pulled up by a lobster trap
[1980.64 - 1985.04] ripped out of the ocean and now they're
[1982.64 - 1986.56] in a store tank they're all sitting down
[1985.04 - 1988.48] there like this and they're all just
[1986.56 - 1991.12] depressed they got rubber bands on their
[1988.48 - 1993.84] claws right okay
[1991.12 - 1996.00] those lobsters are non-stop
[1993.84 - 1998.32] so they just go in a bathroom
[1996.00 - 2000.00] and that everything and all their all
[1998.32 - 2001.52] the stuff the excrement that's coming
[2000.00 - 2002.32] out of those lobsters
[2001.52 - 2004.96] right
[2002.32 - 2006.88] you know that you know that but you know
[2004.96 - 2009.28] that trail that's in the tail if
[2006.88 - 2011.36] you've ever had lobster right so all
[2009.28 - 2012.96] that's coming out of the lobster and it
[2011.36 - 2014.00] has to go somewhere so it goes into a
[2012.96 - 2015.92] filter
[2014.00 - 2017.92] so those big tanks in the supermarkets
[2015.92 - 2020.08] have this filter the filter's sucking
[2017.92 - 2021.92] all that up
[2020.08 - 2024.08] that's your liver
[2021.92 - 2026.48] your liver sitting there
[2024.08 - 2028.56] inside your body right now sucking all
[2026.48 - 2030.40] that garbage up so what is it sucking up
[2028.56 - 2031.60] it's sucking up the gas fumes at the gas
[2030.40 - 2034.56] station
[2031.60 - 2036.40] you like the smell of that gasoline
[2034.56 - 2038.48] smells good
[2036.40 - 2041.60] okay i got the pump in
[2038.48 - 2042.80] yeah smells like gasoline
[2041.60 - 2046.00] hey man
[2042.80 - 2047.12] this gasoline is knocking me out
[2046.00 - 2048.96] hey
[2047.12 - 2050.72] give me a couch
[2048.96 - 2051.92] i think you'll roll a doobie now right
[2050.72 - 2053.36] like that's what it is it's like
[2051.92 - 2055.04] literally can knock you out it can get
[2053.36 - 2057.68] you stuck so that's what gasoline fumes
[2055.04 - 2060.24] can do you smell gasoline too long it
[2057.68 - 2062.00] can really hurt you it can set you in a
[2060.24 - 2064.16] bad direction
[2062.00 - 2066.48] that goes into your liver all the gas
[2064.16 - 2069.20] fumes you've ever breathed in sit inside
[2066.48 - 2072.96] the liver for a lifetime and then become
[2069.20 - 2075.20] a cancer because they end up feeding
[2072.96 - 2077.12] a virus eventually inside your body now
[2075.20 - 2080.32] you've got liver cancer now you've got
[2077.12 - 2082.16] another cancer now you got whatever so
[2080.32 - 2085.28] it's important to know that whatever
[2082.16 - 2086.72] we're actually getting so many toxins
[2085.28 - 2088.40] inside of us all the time but what do we
[2086.72 - 2090.32] do to clear them out what are we doing
[2088.40 - 2093.52] to get that stuff out of us how are we
[2090.32 - 2095.68] blowing that out of us
[2093.52 - 2096.88] celery juice is one of the ways it's one
[2095.68 - 2097.84] of the tools
[2096.88 - 2100.08] so
[2097.84 - 2102.88] what i love about the medicine maker and
[2100.08 - 2106.00] i call this thing the medicine maker
[2102.88 - 2108.48] i call this thing the medicine machine i
[2106.00 - 2110.64] call this the herbal extractor i call
[2108.48 - 2112.24] this the medical device i call this a
[2110.64 - 2113.92] lot of things
[2112.24 - 2115.60] because that's what it is
[2113.92 - 2117.40] so someone asked where can i buy one on
[2115.60 - 2119.44] tick tock so you go to
[2117.40 - 2122.72] omegajuicers.com or look at the link in
[2119.44 - 2126.32] the bio omega juicers.com right
[2122.72 - 2128.56] and you find the mm-900 hds
[2126.32 - 2130.72] that's the one that's the celery juicer
[2128.56 - 2132.32] so just so you know
[2130.72 - 2134.72] so jenna says i hope this helps my
[2132.32 - 2137.04] daughter it's helped a lot of people
[2134.72 - 2139.44] around the world it really has he says i
[2137.04 - 2141.44] love the juicer right
[2139.44 - 2143.28] so it's important it juices more than
[2141.44 - 2145.52] celery it does
[2143.28 - 2147.84] i'll throw greens in here so i'll throw
[2145.52 - 2148.88] greens in here which i really like juice
[2147.84 - 2150.72] i'm a big
[2148.88 - 2151.92] juicer of greens the reason why celery
[2150.72 - 2154.56] juice is so important why i'm always
[2151.92 - 2158.00] like celery juice or juice because
[2154.56 - 2159.36] because it's so easy on the system for
[2158.00 - 2162.88] everybody's
[2159.36 - 2164.08] messed up dilapidated injured
[2162.88 - 2166.80] damaged
[2164.08 - 2169.44] intestinal tracts damaged guts got
[2166.80 - 2172.00] diverticulitis diverticulosis they got
[2169.44 - 2173.84] ibs they got celiac they got crohn's
[2172.00 - 2175.36] they got colitis they got h pylori they
[2173.84 - 2177.52] got acid reflux they got low
[2175.36 - 2179.36] hydrochloric acid they got inflammation
[2177.52 - 2180.32] they did everything wrong with their
[2179.36 - 2182.64] guts
[2180.32 - 2184.40] they got e coli c diff
[2182.64 - 2185.60] they got old salmonella just floating
[2184.40 - 2188.16] around in there they got everything
[2185.60 - 2190.08] under the sun in there and it's time to
[2188.16 - 2193.12] kind of get that cleaned up start to
[2190.08 - 2194.88] restore that garbage jump that we have
[2193.12 - 2197.36] inside of us right
[2194.88 - 2199.52] it's incredible how it works
[2197.36 - 2202.56] people are worried about food costs
[2199.52 - 2204.24] they're worried about it okay and and so
[2202.56 - 2205.60] that's one thing right there and that's
[2204.24 - 2206.72] the thing about especially with the
[2205.60 - 2208.72] tough times people are worried about
[2206.72 - 2211.36] tough times worried about food costs
[2208.72 - 2214.08] i'd like to save money
[2211.36 - 2218.48] basically with another juicer that
[2214.08 - 2218.48] probably would have been that much juice
[2218.56 - 2222.40] some juicers that much juice
[2221.20 - 2223.92] there's a lot of juicers with the
[2222.40 - 2225.60] centrifuge
[2223.92 - 2227.04] that centrifuge right the metal
[2225.60 - 2228.80] centrifuge
[2227.04 - 2230.64] i probably would say it would get this
[2228.80 - 2231.92] much juice out of what i just ran
[2230.64 - 2233.60] through there you see what i'm showing
[2231.92 - 2235.84] you guys right now so i'm showing you
[2233.60 - 2237.28] like one inch here of juice right one
[2235.84 - 2240.16] inch here of juice is two inches of
[2237.28 - 2241.36] juice right here how many ounces that is
[2240.16 - 2242.80] okay
[2241.36 - 2244.80] so and then there's some juicers you'd
[2242.80 - 2246.16] probably get that much out of
[2244.80 - 2248.56] there's some juicers you might get that
[2246.16 - 2249.84] much out of look i'm not saying every
[2248.56 - 2250.96] juicer out there you're gonna get this
[2249.84 - 2252.32] much juice where you're only getting
[2250.96 - 2253.92] like two inches juice which is only
[2252.32 - 2255.52] getting like three four ounces of juice
[2253.92 - 2257.84] to how much celery i just ran through
[2255.52 - 2258.56] here i'm not saying that
[2257.84 - 2260.16] but
[2258.56 - 2262.72] someone else could have run that much
[2260.16 - 2266.88] celery through in a juicer and maybe got
[2262.72 - 2266.88] that much right maybe they got that much
[2266.96 - 2272.16] but they're not going to get this much
[2270.16 - 2274.32] some juicers this much some juicers this
[2272.16 - 2276.16] much some juicers this much some juicers
[2274.32 - 2277.84] may be here
[2276.16 - 2279.28] but every bit counts because it's a
[2277.84 - 2280.88] whole other half a head of salt a
[2279.28 - 2282.32] quarter head of celery or three more
[2280.88 - 2284.00] sticks and then three more sticks adds
[2282.32 - 2286.48] up three more six adds up three more
[2284.00 - 2288.64] sticks adds up and since we're on evil
[2286.48 - 2290.56] planet earth
[2288.64 - 2291.76] eventually
[2290.56 - 2293.36] they're probably getting you know down
[2291.76 - 2295.52] the road 20 years from now they're going
[2293.36 - 2296.72] to be messing with celery give it like
[2295.52 - 2299.68] they're gonna be like you know it's
[2296.72 - 2301.04] always going to be like
[2299.68 - 2302.56] i don't know
[2301.04 - 2304.88] cars would be driving down the street
[2302.56 - 2306.40] with a little thing on top somebody be
[2304.88 - 2309.28] in there like you're only allowed two
[2306.40 - 2311.12] sticks of celery per day
[2309.28 - 2312.88] two six to celery
[2311.12 - 2314.56] per day or we're going to come and get
[2312.88 - 2316.56] you
[2314.56 - 2318.64] that's how the world's going
[2316.56 - 2322.76] but not right up
[2318.64 - 2325.68] the liver works unconditionally for you
[2322.76 - 2329.68] unconditionally for you
[2325.68 - 2331.68] it loves you you can't feel the love
[2329.68 - 2334.24] you can't see the love
[2331.68 - 2335.60] i get it we need to see it man
[2334.24 - 2337.12] show me the love
[2335.60 - 2338.96] that's what people are like out there
[2337.12 - 2343.12] it's like show me the love my feelings
[2338.96 - 2344.00] are hurt show me the love or i'm sad man
[2343.12 - 2346.80] right
[2344.00 - 2349.20] but but our liver can't show us the love
[2346.80 - 2351.36] he's not like a dog right it's not like
[2349.20 - 2352.64] a dog a dog
[2351.36 - 2353.60] a dog
[2352.64 - 2355.36] right
[2353.60 - 2356.72] a dog will you know we'll show you it's
[2355.36 - 2359.68] love right but like yeah yeah i don't
[2356.72 - 2361.68] want to treat and i do love you right
[2359.68 - 2363.84] you know and but
[2361.68 - 2365.84] can a chicken show you i don't know if a
[2363.84 - 2367.20] chicken can show you
[2365.84 - 2369.92] i don't know if a chicken can show you
[2367.20 - 2371.92] up i'm not sure about a chicken
[2369.92 - 2373.92] the point is is your liver can't show
[2371.92 - 2375.84] you you can't see it but it's there the
[2373.92 - 2378.24] love is there your liver loves you
[2375.84 - 2380.00] unconditionally like nothing else your
[2378.24 - 2383.84] liver wants to live it wants to stay
[2380.00 - 2383.84] alive it doesn't want to be transplanted
[2384.00 - 2387.20] your liver doesn't want to be removed it
[2385.68 - 2388.56] doesn't want to be taken out of the body
[2387.20 - 2390.24] it doesn't want to die it doesn't want
[2388.56 - 2392.40] to be transplanted it wants wants to
[2390.24 - 2394.00] stay alive and it loves you and so what
[2392.40 - 2395.92] it does is it just needs a little help
[2394.00 - 2398.16] and a little love back that's what
[2395.92 - 2399.52] celery juice does for it
[2398.16 - 2402.24] i'm going to talk about the adrenals for
[2399.52 - 2403.76] a couple of seconds too you guys
[2402.24 - 2405.04] one thing
[2403.76 - 2408.16] in this world
[2405.04 - 2410.08] you will get that's a guarantee
[2408.16 - 2411.84] let's talk into a doctor friend of mine
[2410.08 - 2414.16] who likes to he's like a philosopher
[2411.84 - 2416.00] he's like
[2414.16 - 2418.40] i've heard this a billion times out
[2416.00 - 2419.28] there but he but he said it anyway
[2418.40 - 2420.24] right
[2419.28 - 2422.56] he said
[2420.24 - 2424.32] there's only one certainty in life and
[2422.56 - 2425.68] i'm like what is it like i didn't know
[2424.32 - 2426.88] what he's gonna say
[2425.68 - 2428.96] what is it
[2426.88 - 2430.24] he's an old surgeon and he's like
[2428.96 - 2433.20] death
[2430.24 - 2436.24] that's the only certainty in life
[2433.20 - 2437.76] i said well
[2436.24 - 2439.44] i'll tell you one certainty in life he's
[2437.76 - 2441.28] like what is it
[2439.44 - 2443.44] what is it
[2441.28 - 2447.28] that this world is gonna
[2443.44 - 2447.28] f up your adrenals really bad
[2448.24 - 2453.20] that's a certainty in life here
[2450.72 - 2455.12] whether we're taught to play excessively
[2453.20 - 2457.44] whether we're taught to do a whole bunch
[2455.12 - 2459.20] of drugs and destroy ourselves whether
[2457.44 - 2460.96] we have no choice but to go on a whole
[2459.20 - 2462.48] bunch of medicational drugs because we
[2460.96 - 2464.00] get too sick
[2462.48 - 2466.32] whether we're up against a whole bunch
[2464.00 - 2468.24] of emotional stress whether we're up
[2466.32 - 2470.88] against a whole another problem in our
[2468.24 - 2472.48] life whatever it is one thing's certain
[2470.88 - 2474.80] in life there's one thing certain on
[2472.48 - 2477.92] this planet is your adrenals are going
[2474.80 - 2480.48] to take a hit throughout the life
[2477.92 - 2482.40] yeah planet stress exactly
[2480.48 - 2484.00] whether it's broken relationships broken
[2482.40 - 2486.00] trust whether it's
[2484.00 - 2487.44] whether it's a boyfriend breaking up
[2486.00 - 2488.96] whether it's a girlfriend breaking up
[2487.44 - 2490.56] whether it's a divorce whether it's
[2488.96 - 2492.08] something else whether it's a tragic
[2490.56 - 2494.08] loss whether it's something that we've
[2492.08 - 2495.36] gone through that's unimaginable whether
[2494.08 - 2497.12] it's something that you think no one
[2495.36 - 2499.20] understands whether it's being
[2497.12 - 2501.28] misunderstood whether it's being hard
[2499.20 - 2503.68] hurt whether it's our heartache whether
[2501.28 - 2505.60] our heart is hurting emotionally whether
[2503.68 - 2507.28] we take an emotional hit whether we feel
[2505.60 - 2509.60] the personalization because we've had it
[2507.28 - 2511.12] beaten out of us or our soul feels like
[2509.60 - 2514.56] it's been beaten out of us whatever it
[2511.12 - 2517.12] is our adrenals are going to take a hit
[2514.56 - 2518.48] the reason why people start to bounce
[2517.12 - 2520.64] back
[2518.48 - 2522.80] they start to get what feels like some
[2520.64 - 2525.20] soul back
[2522.80 - 2526.80] celery juice restores those adrenal
[2525.20 - 2529.68] glands it's one of those things that
[2526.80 - 2531.84] feeds them they're thirsty buggers these
[2529.68 - 2533.52] are thirsty critters these are thirsty
[2531.84 - 2534.88] critters
[2533.52 - 2536.32] and that reminds me since we're talking
[2534.88 - 2537.76] about critters so are these these are
[2536.32 - 2539.36] really thirsty critters too but they
[2537.76 - 2540.64] don't like celery juice
[2539.36 - 2543.12] these critters
[2540.64 - 2545.36] hate celery juice these critters like to
[2543.12 - 2546.40] drink and eat other things
[2545.36 - 2548.16] they do
[2546.40 - 2549.84] they like to drink all kinds of stuff
[2548.16 - 2552.00] and eat all kinds of stuff inside the
[2549.84 - 2554.32] body and they like to they like to
[2552.00 - 2556.00] thrive and colonize and then make you
[2554.32 - 2558.32] sick and then you get your lupus and
[2556.00 - 2559.60] your neurological lime and then you get
[2558.32 - 2561.92] everything else in the sun your
[2559.60 - 2563.44] hashimoto's your eczema your psoriasis
[2561.92 - 2565.84] you get all your other problems right
[2563.44 - 2568.96] here and so what celery juice does is
[2565.84 - 2570.24] celery juice likes to
[2568.96 - 2572.08] break down
[2570.24 - 2575.20] and destroy these little buggers

[2617.60 - 2621.20] i'm like well medical medium protocols
[2619.36 - 2622.88] about how to break down fever blisters
[2621.20 - 2624.80] how to break down the virus and all that
[2622.88 - 2626.64] so medical medium protocols are critical
[2624.80 - 2628.24] it's like no i know because i'm just
[2626.64 - 2630.16] starting to get into those now because
[2628.24 - 2631.68] nothing else i'm doing is working so i'm
[2630.16 - 2634.64] starting to use the medical medium
[2631.68 - 2636.56] protocols and celery juice i noticed aw
[2634.64 - 2638.08] celery juice is one of the top pro on
[2636.56 - 2641.92] the top of the protocols it's always
[2638.08 - 2645.28] like 32 ounces of celery juice
[2641.92 - 2648.32] 16 ounces of celery juice
[2645.28 - 2650.40] children's dosages of celery juice like
[2648.32 - 2653.20] all these things it's about dosages it's
[2650.40 - 2654.72] about all that stuff right here and so
[2653.20 - 2656.32] that's important all its own to break
[2654.72 - 2658.16] down the different viruses that people
[2656.32 - 2661.12] have cold sores fever blisters and all
[2658.16 - 2663.68] that it's like aw tell me what the cold

[2797.12 - 2799.92] stuff about it i don't even talk about
[2798.64 - 2801.28] it it's great
[2799.92 - 2803.44] so
[2801.28 - 2805.84] it's important so carlita says why am i
[2803.44 - 2808.16] still having some acne breakouts even if
[2805.84 - 2809.76] i removed eggs and dairy from my diet
[2808.16 - 2811.76] how long did you remove eggs and dairy
[2809.76 - 2813.20] from your diet number one because if you
[2811.76 - 2814.64] remove eggs and dairy from your diet you
[2813.20 - 2816.32] still have eggs and dairy inside your
[2814.64 - 2818.16] liver for quite a little bit of a while
[2816.32 - 2819.36] could could be in there for a good few
[2818.16 - 2820.88] months or more
[2819.36 - 2822.40] and then whatever's feeding on it will
[2820.88 - 2824.72] keep on feeding on it that's one thing
[2822.40 - 2828.40] the other thing is that's one level
[2824.72 - 2831.20] there's different varieties of bacteria
[2828.40 - 2833.44] i mean strengths of bacteria that cause
[2831.20 - 2834.80] acne so if you read cleanse the heal and
[2833.44 - 2836.56] you check into it and check with your
[2834.80 - 2838.48] doctor if you want but if you if you
[2836.56 - 2841.44] re-cleanse the heal you read about
[2838.48 - 2844.40] streptococcus causing acne right
[2841.44 - 2846.64] some people streptococcus is strong some
[2844.40 - 2848.88] of it is even antibiotic resistance
[2846.64 - 2851.52] right resistant so
[2848.88 - 2853.60] there's an acne protocol so removing
[2851.52 - 2855.84] eggs doesn't mean it's going to fix your
[2853.60 - 2857.44] acne but it's going to help so the acne
[2855.84 - 2858.96] doesn't get worse and worse and worse
[2857.44 - 2860.96] removing eggs stops it from getting
[2858.96 - 2862.88] worse and worse and worse but that's
[2860.96 - 2865.36] just one aspect of the protocol is
[2862.88 - 2868.08] removing eggs right that's one aspect
[2865.36 - 2870.24] removing dairy then
[2868.08 - 2872.00] the other aspect is did you remove
[2870.24 - 2873.92] gluten because that's another thing that
[2872.00 - 2877.04] feeds streptococcus bacteria that causes
[2873.92 - 2879.28] acne then are you using something to
[2877.04 - 2881.68] kill the acne
[2879.28 - 2884.08] are you juicing something to kill the
[2881.68 - 2886.16] acne herbal medicine how much celery
[2884.08 - 2888.80] juice are you doing to kill off the
[2886.16 - 2890.72] streptococcus that's causing the acne
[2888.80 - 2892.32] that's another edge of the protocol see
[2890.72 - 2893.36] medical meaning protocols aren't just
[2892.32 - 2894.80] this one little thing where it's like
[2893.36 - 2896.32] hey i'll take get rid of some eggs and i
[2894.80 - 2897.68] did the medical medium protocol you
[2896.32 - 2899.20] there's a thousand protocols you can
[2897.68 - 2900.48] customize and go as far as you need to
[2899.20 - 2901.76] go to get better and heal and that's
[2900.48 - 2903.76] what people do
[2901.76 - 2905.36] julia says i needed to remove all fats
[2903.76 - 2907.44] before my acne went away that means the
[2905.36 - 2910.40] streptococcus that you had julie was
[2907.44 - 2912.48] hiding behind all that fat that was in
[2910.40 - 2914.16] the foods right so that was critical to
[2912.48 - 2916.08] do too so it was really smart and then
[2914.16 - 2918.64] when you apply celery juice or any
[2916.08 - 2920.40] protocols you annihilate that strep
[2918.64 - 2922.00] bacteria because you don't have so much
[2920.40 - 2923.52] fat in the blood and that's another
[2922.00 - 2925.60] thing right there see there's so much
[2923.52 - 2928.80] information to use so you can heal and
[2925.60 - 2931.04] get better so yeah
[2928.80 - 2932.00] yeah medical medium information knocks
[2931.04 - 2934.40] out
[2932.00 - 2937.04] strep like nobody does umakali golden
