1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
strong i'm cooking

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,319
healing broth which i'm excited about i

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,559
got the water on right now

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,679
got my time right here because guess

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,480
what everybody is coughing their brains

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,000
out right now everybody out there i mean

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
if it hasn't hit you yet or hit your

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,240
area yet just you know i mean i don't

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,840
know what to say but it's like it's

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,680
everybody's getting the sniffles the

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,800
coughs and all that the fever everything

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
else so

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,359
the stuff is running through everybody

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,079
it's everywhere so what do we do to stay

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,880
strong because what happens is that

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,239
it's the bugs that go around

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,600
knock

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,200
everyone's immune system down

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,200
and then

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,079
you can't get back off the ground

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,840
because something else inside of you

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,440
is creeping up even if you don't hear it

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
because it makes no sense you know the

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,600
funny thing is is that

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,120
people walk around people walk right now

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
it's no big deal it's good good you can

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,039
get over a cold get over a cold whatever

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,480
but for a lot of people it knocks them

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,400
down

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,320
so then something else creeps up like

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,799
epstein barr and shingles and all these

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,799
other things and they're fever blisters

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,520
and also now they got neurological

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,920
fatigue and everything because the body

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,080
just it's just getting slammed slammed

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,280
by all the stuff going around so how do

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,880
we stay strong good to see you guys

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,560

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,320
talking about also how to keep ourselves

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,680
strong which is really important right

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,479
right there i'm telling everybody it's

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,399

is slammed i know right that's what

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,079

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,879
uh no

60
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
no

61
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,239
unless you're doing something to take

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,120
care of yourself protect yourself unless

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,640
you're doing something because it

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,319
doesn't necessarily make you stronger it

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,640
beats you down

66
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,080
and now you're like dragging or six

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,520
months later now all of a sudden you're

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,440
like why am i having these other

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
problems like what's going on it's

70
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,319
chipping away

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
at your

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,720
strength chipping away at the strength

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
so you want to be on this stuff

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
you want to be on

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
what you don't want to be doing things

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,959
like the healing broth is like that

77
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,040

because i just want it on hand so it's

82
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,120

83
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,440
i don't consume it because things are

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,599

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,040
and then i reheat it or something but

86
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,080

189
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,240
what i tell my family

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,319
is you do a tablespoon of elderberry

191
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,639
syrup every single day right now in this

192
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,520
day and age when the world is freaking

193
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,880
out and the bugs are going around

194
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
that's what you do even if it's two

195
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,080
teaspoons or a teaspoon of the

196
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,319
elderberry syrup right now it's so

197
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,199
important to know like it's an important

198
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,360
time for it that's juiced elderberry

199
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,759
there's no product on the planet that

200
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,880
can touch this like when i look at other

201
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,800
elderberry syrups now it's garbage

202
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880
that's how superseded like this is

203
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,080
superseded any elderberry syrup i've

204
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,319
ever seen anyhow anywhere

205
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,000
it's just unbelievable

206
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,560
and so when i look at other elderberry

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,440
syrups i'm like oh yeah that's right

208
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,560
that's the old way of doing things um

209
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,160
that's just

210
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,800
a dried elderberry basically and then a

211
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,039
whole bunch of cane sugar in there

212
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,479
low quality everything citric acid and

213
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,160
everything else in there oh that's the

214
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,840
old way

215
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,680
you know this is the new way right here

216
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,599
no one's ever done it before that's the

217
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,440
most powerful way right what's the name

218
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,960
of the elderberry syrup it's vimergy v

219
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,960
is in victor i m as

220
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,440
and i'm making the healing broth

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,520
so i got the water heating up so let's

222
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,319
chop some stuff up let's get an onion in

223
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,560
here

224
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,840
onions and garlic baby

225
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,160
onions and garlic

226
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,120
get the onions and garlic in you really

227
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,120
important right there

228
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,960
medicinal medicine

229
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
onions and garlic

230
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,440
is medicine right

231
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,440
you need every edge you can get

232
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,599
i'm using whatever ingredients i have on

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,319
hand right now you guys

234
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,080
right

235
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,440
so i don't have all the perfect

236
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,000
ingredients for

237
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,400
medical medium healing broth right

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,919
but i have close enough

239
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,680
and if that's happening in your house

240
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,160
and look all you have is certain things

241
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,440
then then use it do it i'm getting the

242
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,440
onion in there that's first off

243
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,879
let's get that going in there

244
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,879
right

245
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,279
onion and garlic is the critical

246
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,719
component when you're doing healing

247
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,159
broth

248
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,880
i know that everybody loves your chicken

249
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,279
soup i'm not ranking on chicken soup

250
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,760
it's just that the fat

251
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
from the chicken

252
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,959
stops your immune

253
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,839
system

254
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,839
you know from doing its job

255
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,680
the reason why chicken soup

256
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,800
is something that went down in history

257
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,200
as being helpful for bugs going around

258
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,959
is because it takes people off of

259
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,160
sausage

260
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
bacon

261
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
ham

262
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
pizza

263
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,200
lots of cheese

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,959
it takes them off of all that

265
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,600
so they end up getting sick with the flu

266
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,080
or cold and they find that they eat some

267
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,320
chicken broth which is lighter than how

268
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,360
they've been eating for probably years

269
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,279
and that's why people got like a bump up

270
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,880
from having chicken broth i'm not i'm

271
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,760
not harping on it that's something you

272
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
do

273
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,160
no disrespect i'm not judging anybody

274
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
that's not it i'm showing you guys a

275
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,880
different way

276
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,440
your white blood cells

277
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,000
cannot easily clobber

278
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,800
the bug you're fighting when there's fat

279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,240
in the bloodstream

280
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,480
bottom line

281
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,800
so when you're doing chicken soup you

282
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,360
got all that chicken fat

283
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,680
in the soup the chicken fat gets into

284
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,080
your bloodstream and your immune system

285
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,760
struggles yes it's better than your

286
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
normal standard fare whatever you're

287
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,440
doing processed foods fast food

288
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,279
restaurants pizzas whatever it is and

289
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,880
then you get sick and now you're eating

290
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,160
chicken soup and it gives your body a

291
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,240
little bit more of an edge to heal

292
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,480
because it is lighter than what someone

293
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
else might be already eating every day

294
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,040
because first of all they get sick with

295
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,720
food they're coughing they got no

296
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,640
appetite for a while they go a day

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,040
without really eating much of anything

298
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,399
maybe a dry piece of toast

299
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
and then they have some chicken soup

300
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
it's the first time someone stopped

301
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,640
eating the usual fare they usually eat

302
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,240
for a long time so they get an edge

303
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,920
but that's not enough especially with

304
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,440
the bugs going around today the bugs

305
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,680
going around today you guys gotta have

306
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,000
more of an edge you don't want fat in

307
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,560
the soup so just like chicken soup has a

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,560
fat in it if i put oil in this healing

309
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,800
broth i'm doing the same thing as if

310
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,079
someone was having chicken soup

311
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,279
how can you

312
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,800
give your immune system the strength it

313
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:58,079
needs when you got fat in the way

314
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,640
stopping your white blood cells

315
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,920
from going after the bugs

316
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,760
and that's what happens all the fat in

317
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,440
your bloodstream it's like becomes a big

318
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,839
smokescreen

319
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,600
and that's what goes wrong right

320
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,200
so i got some

321
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,040
onion in there let's get some garlic in

322
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,480
there now

323
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,079
best thing you can do

324
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,000
when you're sick with what's happening

325
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,640
right now stay off of the avocado the

326
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,480
oils the nuts the seeds if you're vegan

327
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,160
stay off of the animal products if

328
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
you're animal protein if you're sick

329
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,800
you're coughing you've got congestion in

330
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,440
your lungs and chest stay off of it keep

331
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,040
the fats out of there

332
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,200
jeanette says chicken soup without the

333
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,279
chicken is my new soup incredible

334
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,720
incredible

335
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,320
so what i'm doing is i'm peeling some

336
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,839
garlic back because

337
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,600
this is what we're doing you love garlic

338
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,160
bobby

339
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,680
yeah i do too love garlic

340
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,440
now if you're if you're not a fan of

341
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,200
garlic

342
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
you can keep it out

343
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
you can but it's really important to

344
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,000
have it in there so if you can tolerate

345
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,160
it on any level

346
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,680
try to keep it in that's what i would

347
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,079
say

348
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,240

newsletter so you know where i'm at like

375
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,880
where the challenge is going to be where

376
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,240
everything's at

377
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
so i'm just throwing this garlic right

378
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,360
in here you don't even have to

379
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,720
you don't even have to uh

380
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,760
you know cut it up you don't have to

381
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,639
chop it up you can just

382
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,639
pop it right out

383
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,279
if you see me hammering on this knife

384
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,360
right i just said this earlier too if

385
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,920
you see me hammering on this knife

386
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,240
don't do it

387
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,519
don't do it if you hammer on a knife

388
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,720
like this

389
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,639
the blade can't be angled to the inside

390
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,760
so the blade the sharp part of the blade

391
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,600
can't be angled to you so you can't put

392
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,040
it down like that

393
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,120
and hammer it

394
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
see with the blade pointing to me you

395
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
don't want to do that here's what

396
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,079
happens you ready

397
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,639
you have it's easy to flip up this way

398
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,480
and go right on the knife i've seen

399
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,399
people do it okay

400
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,880
you want to have it flipped outward you

401
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,440
want the sharp part going out

402
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,760
going outward and then you put it down

403
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,240
the knife doesn't flip easier up like

404
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,560
that it doesn't it actually the weight

405
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,240
of the knife does keep it down for some

406
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,240
reason so you want to do

407
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,399
it's the safest way to go

408
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,880
if you're popping like

409
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,160

568
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,760

593
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
supplement company and nobody realizes

594
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,159
it so i try to make friends with

595
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,159
everybody that's what i've done for

596
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,039
20 plus years

597
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,440
and and any company that has even a

598
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,960
partial quality product i want to know

599
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,520
i want to meet up

601
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
i want to see how they do it

602
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,520

and that's the vimorgy product right

607
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,000
there

608
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,559
so

609
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,400
z shock therapy right

610
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,880
is what i've used all these years i've

611
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,200
learned that from spirit of compassion

612
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,760
where you can head off

613
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,679
stave off that cold or that flu bug you

614
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,600
can stave it off you can head it off the

615
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,600
path right

616
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,360
head it off at the pass right

617
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,440
and that's that's what i love about z

618
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,039
shock therapy so z shock therapy is

619
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,360
every three hours

620
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,120

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,480
every three hours waking hours veronica

623
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,640
samara says mmm i'm the only one not

624
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,799
sick at home from the bug dot dot

625
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,280
following flu and cold protocols lemon

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,480
water and celery juice incredible

627
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,559
incredible

628
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,679
and and then you still have z-shock

629
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,120

630
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,000

this is cooking up right here you guys

633
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,000
and you can put in a little bit of water

634
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,919
that's all you put in a little bit of

635
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,400
water like a shot glass let me go get a

636
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,480
shot glass you could put it in there and

637
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,559
add a little bit of water to it and then

638
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,240
you've got yourself the z-shock therapy

639
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,159
right

640
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,919
you do it for a couple of days if you're

641
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,280
really sick if you're coming down with

642
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,400
something you do it for two or three

643
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,640
days

644
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,600
and you get ahead of it

645
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,200
that's a weapon man that's a weapon i

646
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,480
can't tell you

647
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,559
if i had a feather for any every time a

648
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,679
feather every time

649
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,960
someone said aw that saved my life

650
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,200
aw

651
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,000
i was half as sick as i would have been

652
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,320
aw i never even got sick aw my sore

653
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,559
throat went away aw i caught it in time

654
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,840
and i did that z shock therapy if i had

655
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,000
a feather

656
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,480
i'd be flying i wouldn't have to i

657
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
wouldn't have to book plane tickets

658
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,360
i just literally

659
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,679
just grab my

660
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,159
million feathers stick them on me and

661
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,320
try to fly

662
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,799
you know so jacqueline says i love how

663
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,159
tolerable the vimergy zinc is on the

664
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,600
stomach it's the only one that i know

665
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,440
people with sensitive stomachs can

666
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,840
tolerate so that's the other thing

667
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,440
because it's stabilized right

668
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,360
unstabilizing

669
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,039
which is all the other companies right

670
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,039
now unfortunately i don't know why

671
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,520
people can't get it right out there

672
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,240
but it's unstabilized and then they they

673
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,240
have to use terrible things like citric

674
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,919
acid or whatever in there right

675
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,720
and and it just burns a hole in your

676
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,760
stomach so when people get sick

677
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,200
from z

678
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,480
they're just like they're just do they

679
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,400
feel like they're getting a hole burned

680
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,360
in your stomach right

681
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,600
and like i said if i mean seriously

682
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,159
so many people with with

683
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,320
the z shock therapy what it's done

684
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,600
zinc shock vitamin c and goldenseal have

685
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,880
saved me

686
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,440
cindy says

687
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,960
incredible right

688
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,159
so that's an important thing right now

689
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,039
and look

690
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,960
stomach flu is on its way that one's

691
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,799
going to come through this winter

692
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,840
on top of all the other stuff that's

693
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,159
happening

694
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,440
right and these bugs are

695
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,960
virulent

696
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,279
they're just that's just the way they

697
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,360
are and it's about taking control having

698
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,559
some empowerment empowering yourself be

699
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,159
like you know what

700
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,679
i'm going to have this on hand i'm going

701
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,679
to have the ingredients on hand when i

702
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,799
need it or go go out and get what i need

703
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,640
if something's happening i'm going to

704
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,400
have the healing broth i'm going to have

705
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,720
the time water i'm going to have the

706
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,360
time t i'm going to have lots of oranges

707
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,360
on hand right lots of oranges all that

708
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,240
incredible vitamin c

709
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,240
all that matters too right

710
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,360
you want your oranges on hand lots of

711
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,360
those

712
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,039
because what you can do

713
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,799
is you can make yourself some fresh

714
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,640
squeezed orange juice

715
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,640
how about that for your white blood

716
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,520
cells that's incredible right there

717
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,760
right

718
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,799
and you always keep some thyme in stock

719
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,039
maybe grow it someday too in a pot right

720
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,200
outside your porch or your window or on

721
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,760
your windowsill something like that but

722
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,000
having lots of time is really important

723
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,000
having ginger on hand for ginger tea

724
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,360
that's another one all on its own

725
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,559
right

726
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,200
so

727
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,559
so having ginger tea on its own that's a

728
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,559
great one you got your ginger

729
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,760
so let's talk about time water for a

730
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
minute

731
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,799
you ready

732
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,440
i put water

733
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,679
in this jug

734
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,360
right

735
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200
and then

736
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,000
i take this time

737
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
then i drop it in

738
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,760
someone told me the other day it's too

739
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,640
hard to do all this stuff

740
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,080
that's what they said it's too hard

741
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,039
you said hey i just want to tell you

742
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,559
something i i i can't do this stuff

743
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,240
i said what are you talking about

744
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,080
i can't do the time whatever i'm like

745
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,080
what

746
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,640
i put water in the jug and i dropped

747
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,640
fresh thyme in that's all i did

748
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,559
now it goes in my fridge

749
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,360

902
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,399
here so this is vitamin c

903
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,480
shock therapy

904
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,399
every two hours

905
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,159
two capsules

906
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,360
the best vitamin c that's easy on the

907
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,799
stomach so what happens when everybody

908
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,640
gets the flu and they get the cold bugs

909
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,480
their stomach goes south

910
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,919
their stomachs just go sour a lot of

911
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,919
people half the people who get the flu

912
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,679
bugs end up throwing up all the mucus

913
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,279
and their sinus congestion their sinus

914
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,200
congestion and mucus their lungs and

915
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,799
everything it's going into their stomach

916
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,919
so what happens when someone catches a

917
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,000
bug

918
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,720
they're swallowing all the mucus all

919
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,399
night long and their stomach gets sick

920
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,000
that's why a lot of kids throw up that's

921
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,520
like a lot of people throw up when they

922
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,520
get the flu or the cold or they get the

923
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,800
bug going around they're vomiting

924
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,280
because

925
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,720
their stomach is filled with mucus

926
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,800
another reason why they're vomiting is

927
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,399
because all the sinus pressure from the

928
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,560
bug that's going around right now and

929
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,520
i'm seeing it out there the sinus

930
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,960
pressure

931
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,480
is putting pressure on their vagus

932
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,240
nerves

933
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,720
so everybody has this pressure on the

934
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,440
vagus nerves the sinus pressures are the

935
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,359
sinus pressure is putting pressure on

936
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,480
their facial nerve trigeminal nerve

937
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,240

years ago who cares

1016
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,160
jeanette i see medical medium

1017
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,640
information all the time taken by

1018
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,240
doctors on ads oh my god jeanette

1019
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,240
i just had a a meeting about that

1020
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,520
here's what's happening

1021
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,599
all the doctors have taken medical

1022
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,880
medium original unique information out

1023
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,400
of the books

1024
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,079
that's only been put in the books

1025
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,680
nowhere else right

1026
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,960
they've taken it they've hijacked it

1027
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,400
they have no studies to show where it

1028
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,599
comes from because they don't come from

1029
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,880
studies they come from medical medium

1030
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,880
literature

1031
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,160
and they're they're banking off it right

1032
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,839
that's what they're doing right but

1033
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,079
that's just one area

1034
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,240
i'm seeing it everywhere we see it

1035
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,680
everywhere medical medium information so

1036
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,240
the goal is

1037
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,040
censor medical medium wherever we can

1038
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,920
so medical medium doesn't take credit

1039
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,480
so that his people people who find them

1040
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,079
can't find him and get better so that

1041
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,839
they take the medical media information

1042
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,440
they chop it up dice it up they put it

1043
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,280
out there they add their other stuff to

1044
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,200
it people don't really get better from

1045
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,640
it they don't give credit to the good

1046
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,640
stuff they're using

1047
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,119
from medical media

1048
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,359

good protection method right there the

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,960
elderberry syrup there's nothing like

1185
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,440
that out there i'm letting you guys know

1186
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,040
process the way they do this process is

1187
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,560
incredible it's a juiced elderberry the

1188
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,119
whole thing's incredible right it's got

1189
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,240
vitamin c in here so that actually has

1190
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,000
vitamin c in it which is who does that

1191
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,520
in an elderberry syrup

1192
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,079
is there water in the broth yeah i did

1193
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,560
put eight cups of water in the in there

1194
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,800
somewhere around there i wasn't actually

1195
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,040
counting perfectly and this is done this

1196
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,839
broth is done by the way

1197
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,280
b12 is critical for recovery especially

1198
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,680
with neurological symptoms when we get

1199
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,440
sick with a cold flu which is really

1200
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,240
important

1201
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,760
and

1202
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,440
lemon balm is a great one right there

1203
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,640
you've got the vitamin c shock therapy

1204
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,160
you've got the other various cells all

1205
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,160
these things are important

1206
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,560
i'm not sponsored by them by the

1207
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,960

1209
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,520
superior

1210
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,599
which is unbelievable it's just

1211
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,440
incredible we talked about time t we got

1212
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,800
time water right here on recap you guys

1213
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,319
we got that we got the healing broth

1214
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,480
let's get a little bit of healing broth

1215
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,480
out

1216
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,760
get the lid off of this

1217
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,440
now i'm not straining this right now

1218
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,520
i'm just actually using this just to get

1219
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,599
the broth out see you guys i'm sure

1220
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,040
you've done this before right

1221
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,560
okay

1222
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,920
so basically i'm pushing this down in

1223
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,920
there and i'm just getting the broth

1224
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,000
i think what i'm going to do is use a

1225
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,000
see-through

1226
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
bowl

1227
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,480
how's this

1228
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,480
does that work

1229
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,319
might get a little piece of carrot in

1230
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,720
there because what i'm doing is just

1231
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,119
bringing this down into the bra you know

1232
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,319
i'm kind of letting the

1233
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,800
the broth

1234
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,800
spill on to the spoon i mean to the

1235
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,000
ladle

1236
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,480
and that's what i'm doing right now so

1237
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,480
i'm getting this broth

1238
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,440
all that congestion in the lungs all

1239
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,040
that congestion in the sinuses

1240
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,440
and you sit over this thing and you

1241
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,319
breathe in the steamy hot broth and then

1242
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,040
you

1243
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,319
blow on the spoon and you you suck it

1244
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,880
right in and all those chemical

1245
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,680
compounds get driven into the body how

1246
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,040
incredible is that

1247
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,119
is it okay to freeze the broth yes it is

1248
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,280
yes it is

1249
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,920
so that's the broth right there

1250
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,280
how long does the broth keep

1251
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,160
i keep it in the fridge for a couple

1252
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,119
days

1253
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,920
a couple days easy to reheat it

1254
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,319
to freeze it too if you want

1255
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,800
