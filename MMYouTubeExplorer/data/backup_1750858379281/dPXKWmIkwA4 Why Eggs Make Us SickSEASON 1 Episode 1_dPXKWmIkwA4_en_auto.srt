which is the most

64
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,600
advanced healing information that exists

65
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,520
today

66
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,880

other people know and i want you guys to

68
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,360
learn about it too so today it's all

69
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,680
about eggs

70
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,560
and why they're not working for us and

71
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,959
why we're getting

72
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,479
sicker without realizing it and we don't

73
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,480
blame the egg

74
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
nobody blames the egg you'll blame a

75
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
piece of fruit

76
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,360
somebody will blame something else way

77
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
before they'll blame all the eggs they

78
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,720
eat all those years

79
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,000
even if it was an egg once a year once a

80
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
week once a month

81
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
or once a day they won't blame the egg

82
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
so i'm going to go into it

83
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,560
so we're going to we're going to cover

84
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,360
it so the medical industry

85
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,720
is involved with why eggs are bad not

86
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
because they're out there talking about

87
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,640
eggs being bad but what happened is they

88
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,560
were using eggs

89
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,519
back years and years ago to raise bugs

90
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
so bugs are why we're sick and we're

91
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,239
going to go into this this is going to

92
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,680
be really intense it's going to be

93
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
really interesting

94
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,800
and so much information i got to cover

95
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,400
see basically what happened is viruses

96
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,200
pathogens bacteria were raised in labs

97
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,000
a long time ago back in the 1920s back

98
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,000
in the 1930s back in the 1940s

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,599
and so on and these bugs were raised in

100
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,080
labs these are the bugs

101
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,519
that got into people now that are into

102
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,959
you if you have acne

103
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,480
that's streptococcus i'm going to go

104
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,840
into streptococcus all the different

105
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,640
groups and stuff like that a little bit

106
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
later

107
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,760
but if you have acne that means you have

108
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
strep in your system

109
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,319
that strep is in your system because

110
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,440
that strep left a lab back in the 1920s

111
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,840
1930s

112
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,640
i don't know how mysteriously left the

113
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720
labs

114
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,280
probably on purpose obviously so we can

115
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,239
stay sick so we can be a sick society a

116
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,200
sick culture

117
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,040
250 million americans alone are sick

118
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,560
right now with symptoms and conditions

119
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,239
and if you don't think you got a chronic

120
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,799
illness if you have one symptom

121
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,560
that comes and goes intermittently or if

122
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
it just comes and goes periodically or

123
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
you can't get rid of it or it's there

124
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,480
all the time or you got two symptoms or

125
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,319
three symptoms

126
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,760
that's a chronic problem that's a

127
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,360
chronic illness so

128
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,000
do you suffer from autoimmune do you

129
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,560
suffer from maxima psoriasis vitiligo

130
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,560
lupus lyme disease endometriosis pcos

131
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,519

132
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040

acne ibs crohn's bloating colitis

137
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,400
fibromyalgia

138
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,799
hundreds of more conditions they're

139
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,560
caused by pathogens

140
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,079
so you can get your best medical

141
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
information out there alternative

142
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,160
medicine or your best healer or your

143
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,560
best advisor in in medical health

144
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,560
and they won't tell you which bugs or

145
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,960
bugs that are responsible for this

146
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
responsible for all your illnesses and

147
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,639
how eggs

148
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,800
feed these bugs so this is critical

149
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,400
information it's really important

150
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
so in order for pathogens to stay alive

151
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
they need

152
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,000
food and everybody has pathogens in

153
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,040
their body

154
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,479
every other pathogens in their system

155
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,639
that's how it works if you've had

156
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,400
fibromyalgia if you've had a hashimoto's

157
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,000
problem if you had a thyroid issue

158
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,160
there's pathogens involved so we'll

159
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
cover some of that too along the way

160
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,680
so eczema psoriasis that's a virus

161
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,479
inside the liver along with

162
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,080
abundant amounts of copper a toxin that

163
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,960
sits in the liver so i'll explain about

164
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000
that too so

165
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,120
here's how it works viruses

166
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,160
stay alive by feeding off of food inside

167
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
of our body

168
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,080
pathogens stay alive by feeding off of

169
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,840
food inside our body so that's how it

170
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
works i got some eggs right here

171
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,880
of course you have to have the eggs

172
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,360
right here right so

173
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,320
when you're eating the eggs every day

174
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,560
you're just

175
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,160
bringing yourself closer to sickness now

176
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,520
you could throw up a blind eye at this

177
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,120
you can just throw your hands at it and

178
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,800
be like okay what does he know

179
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,080
what's going on here or whatever but

180
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,600
because you're feeling good you might be

181
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,160
young you might be indestructible at the

182
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,440
moment

183
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
you might be working out in the gym

184
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,960
every single day you're 20 years old

185
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
you're 25 years old you're 22 years old

186
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,199
whatever and you're like no i have eggs

187
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,800
on my salad

188
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,280
i'm told it's a protein source i'm going

189
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,680
to cover all that stuff but in the end

190
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,840
you will get symptoms everybody does

191
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,280
whether they get it at age 38 whether

192
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,479
they start getting reproductive problems

193
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,960
at age 35

194
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,840
whether they get something at age 42

195
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,240
they get it

196
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,160
see that's the whole thing no one's

197
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,960
going to escape that unless they

198
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,000
really know what to do for themselves

199
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,400
what do you actually do

200
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,400
what to use for the health and and how

201
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,880
to avoid things they shouldn't be eating

202
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
because in the end everybody gets

203
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,680
symptoms

204
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,639
bottom line i've been doing this for 35

205
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,400
plus years

206
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,000
been involved with it i've talked to

207
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,800
thousands of health professionals

208
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,319
over the years i know how it works

209
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,440
everybody gets symptoms if you don't

210
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,800
think you're getting them now

211
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,360
you're going to get them later so why

212
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,280
not avoid them why not actually

213
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
do something about it this is one of the

214
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,759
most powerful ways to handle it is

215
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,840
getting rid of these babies right here

216
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,160
and so get them out of your diet no

217
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,400
matter what and so look

218
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
i'm not in the food wars okay we know

219
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,759
that i'm not all about the food world

220
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,440
meaning like you guys may not know if

221
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,800
you're brand new to this it's the first

222
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,639
time you're watching this

223
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,560
with me or anything like that but people

224
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,160
who know medical medium information

225
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,759
know that i'm not involved with that

226
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,599
whole food war thing where it's the

227
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,039
vegans against the paleo's the paleo's

228
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,560
against the vegans whether it's whatever

229
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
diets that you know anybody subscribed

230
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,599
to where animal protein against the

231
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
non-animal protein people

232
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,440
and how it goes and the flip-flopping

233
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,039
that happens all in it where people

234
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,400
leave the vegan world and they go back

235
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,840
to animal proteins

236
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,199
meanwhile they got sick to begin with

237
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,639
off the animal proteins people leave the

238
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,120
animal proteins they go back to vegan

239
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,479
world they're all going back and forth

240
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,240
and what's happening is everybody's

241
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,520
guessing and everybody's still dealing

242
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,440
and fighting with their symptoms

243
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,800
as they go along the way or they get rid

244
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,000
of symptoms for a little while and then

245
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,199
they come back

246
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,639
so not about just subscribing to one

247
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,479
side of it or one hey

248
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,479
veganism is the way to go or hey

249
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,440
paleoism is the way to go it's not how

250
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,160
i've ever been

251
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,759
i'm about real answers real truth

252
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,240
they're in the medical medium series

253
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,400
books

254
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,840
so you can actually be armed and be able

255
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,759
to take care of yourself and help

256
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,520
yourself heal and get better

257
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
that's what it's about it's about making

258
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,680
sure that mom who can't get out of bed

259
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,680
to take care of her kids gets real

260
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,599
answers for the first time after she's

261
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,199
already been to five neurologists after

262
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,879
she's already been to five other doctors

263
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,160
or a dermatologist or

264
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,000
however because of her excellent

265
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,759
psoriasis or some other condition i'm

266
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
all about making sure

267
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,520
you get your information so you can heal

268
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,840
and be empowered

269
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,360
and rise above all the nonsense and the

270
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
noise that's out there including the

271
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,400
noise that's on youtube

272
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,919
including the food war noise including

273
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,120
everybody thinking they got their handle

274
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,360
on a diet or whatever

275
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
when in the end no one knows what causes

276
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,080
illnesses

277
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,680
they don't know the epstein-barr causes

278
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,280
actual sickness like all the different

279
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
conditions i mentioned earlier

280
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,639
some of them many of them and they don't

281
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,160
know about all the different shingles

282
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,759
varieties the epstein-barr varieties the

283
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,039
over 60 varieties so we're going into

284
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,440
this stuff in depth

285
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,800
um gonna have to actually drink a little

286
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,800
celery juice keep me going here

287
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,640
so let's go into a little bit more of

288
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
this

289
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,320
the basics let's just start out with the

290
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,080
basics right here

291
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,920
viruses and pathogens that are

292
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
responsible for autoimmune

293
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,440
and other illnesses if you've been

294
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,040
diagnosed with an autoimmune condition

295
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,640
of any kind and your doctor finally said

296
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
hey it's autoimmune or you went online

297
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,560
and looked and it's autoimmune

298
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
whatever that is what that means without

299
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,920
anybody telling you

300
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,560
is that you have a condition where you

301
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,360
have a pathogen inside the body

302
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,680
causing problems creating neurotoxins

303
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,720
creating dermatoxins like if it's eczema

304
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,519
psoriasis

305
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,680
that's a pathogen creating a toxin that

306
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,320
floats to the skin this is advanced

307
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,680
information now if you eat eggs

308
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,600
if you're eating them or you ate them in

309
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,800
the past you're feeding

310
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,080
that pathogen you're feeding that virus

311
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,519
and that's what's keeping you sick and

312
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,959
that's what what's going to keep you

313
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,760
sick so this is really important to

314
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,959
understand

315
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,279
so that's just a basic rundown of that

316
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,880
so food is medicine you guys heard that

317
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,480
everybody's heard that food is medicine

318
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,560
food is medicine right

319
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,640
what food that be that medicine all of

320
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,279
it and you know you know the whole thing

321
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,839
with that

322
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,279
is food is medicine what's

323
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,959
medicine with food if you don't know

324
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,800
what causes illness

325
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,480
how can you know what's good or bad for

326
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,560
you how can you know as a health

327
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
professional what's really good or bad

328
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,440
for you

329
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
how can you know as an influencer how

330
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,000
can you know if somebody actually giving

331
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,519
advice out there when you don't know

332
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,200
what causes illness

333
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,800
if you don't know what causes all the

334
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,880
different symptoms and conditions

335
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,320
how do you know what food is good or bad

336
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
why do you think people are still eating

337
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,800
eggs

338
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,560
and that's how it works if people knew

339
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
what was really wrong with them and what

340
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,120
was causing illness and sickness out

341
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,760
there

342
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,040
eggs would actually get a bad rap like a

343
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,320
really bad rap

344
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,880
see that's the whole point so

345
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,440
everybody's saying hey food is medicine

346
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
but sure there are some good things in

347
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,399
eggs

348
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,160
but there's bad things in eggs too

349
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,320
there's bad things that actually

350
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,200
feed bugs and that's really important

351
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,120
understand

352
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,959
just because there's a nutrient in eggs

353
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
or like omega-3 or something like that

354
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,600
that you're being told is in an egg

355
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,360
just because you know some omega-3s in

356
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
here there's some protein in here

357
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
something that you think is actually

358
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,320
good for you or some nutrients and stuff

359
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,680
like that just because that's in here

360
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,720
doesn't mean there's something else that

361
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,720
isn't in here

362
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,760
that's causing trouble look the

363
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,120
industries

364
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,079
use this in labs as a food

365
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,440
source for all the bugs that are keeping

366
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,680
everybody down

367
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,640
disempowering women and men actually

368
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,959
hurting people

369
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,640
keeping them sick hurting children

370
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,720
keeping them sick

371
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,560
that's what they did they did that

372
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
without your permission no town hall

373
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,480
meeting

374
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,360
no vote no anything this was done

375
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,560
without your decisions involved so eggs

376
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,440
were actually

377
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,279
ruined because of this okay and before

378
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,200
all this yeah eggs will probably find

379
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,920
food to eat why not

380
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,240
why not so let's go into uh something

381
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,839
called

382
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
autoimmune i want to cover that a little

383
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,600
bit why i want to talk about

384
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,920
that when it comes down to eggs

385
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,000
autoimmune and eggs and and kind of

386
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,000
link that together so that's really

387
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
important to talk about because so many

388
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,720
of you with autoimmune conditions of any

389
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,720
kind

390
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,200
or symptoms that may not have been

391
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,000
diagnosed as autoimmune or anything

392
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,399
so many of you are actually eating eggs

393
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,639
or

394
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,839
go back to eating eggs or maybe come off

395
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,600
of them and go back to them you know

396
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,800
it's one of those things where

397
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,160
it's a staple in all the diets maybe if

398
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,839
you're not a vegan sure

399
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,600
but you know what it's a lot of people

400
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,200
they're not vegan long

401
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
you know they're vegan for a very short

402
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,519
time they're vegan for like five years

403
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,320
yeah that's a short time that's a really

404
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,000
short time

405
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,920
or they're vegan for one year and

406
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,680
they're back on eggs what do they do

407
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,360
when vegans usually leave

408
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,720
that whole thing plant-based people they

409
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,399
go right back to eggs

410
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,320
they do a little fish or they stay with

411
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,360
eggs they bring on cheese or something

412
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,279
or butter they usually start there but

413
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,040
so i want to talk about how most

414
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,480
everybody has been either been on eggs

415
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,959
when they're younger or they're on

416
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
eggs later or they're just on eggs every

417
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,079
day

418
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,440
so let's talk about this think about

419
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,200
technology back in the 1950s late 1940s

420
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,320
right think about technology think about

421
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,480
the phones go watch an

422
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,760
old movie i know i say this a lot watch

423
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,320
an old movie

424
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,000
and look at technology back in 1950 all

425
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,839
right you'll be in shock

426
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
because we're so used to tech now we're

427
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,200
so used to life now we're so used to

428
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,519
what's happening now okay

429
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,320
and so go back and look at that and when

430
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,240
you look at that

431
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,160
you'll see the old phones you'll see the

432
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,480
old cars cars as big as

433
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,200
as big as boats you'll see all of that

434
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,240
you know

435
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,800
and what happens is when you realize

436
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,519
technology was where it was at then you

437
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,560
have to realize

438
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,839
medicine was where technology was at

439
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,720
back then too

440
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,120
it was in the dark ages okay that was

441
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,920
the dark ages of medicine

442
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,680
that was where theories were born just

443
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,360
like now theories are here now

444
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,199
we're still you know in the dark ages in

445
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,160
many ways because you know hey they

446
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,839
still don't even know what causes

447
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,320
chronic illness and autoimmune but think

448
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,120
about as far as back in the late 1940s

449
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,639
early 1950s well that's when the

450
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,760
autoimmune theory was

451
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,440
birthed that's when it was born okay so

452
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,720
if you're someone who's young right now

453
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,079
if you're someone that's already been to

454
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,680
a couple doctors you've got a little bit

455
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,519
of eczema and you're realizing it's

456
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,680
autoimmune or you've got some swelling

457
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,079
on the body or you got something that's

458
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,800
you're getting a diagnosis of lupus or

459
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,000
you just got

460
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,760
symptoms that are actually being

461
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,199
classified as autoimmune are you dealing

462
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,800
with a little fibromyalgia or chronic

463
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,480
fatigue syndrome or whatever it is

464
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,240
that's all in the autoimmune family or

465
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,639
lyme disease now pushed in autoimmune

466
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,079
i'm going to go into that more detail it

467
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,519
whatever you're dealing with

468
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,920
okay autoimmune is a theory still

469
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,360
the word is a theory the concept is a

470
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,399
theory your sickness is

471
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,279
real your symptoms are real they are

472
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,079
very real way more real than the

473
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,040
industry

474
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,600
lets you feel or know because that's how

475
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,560
it is

476
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,240
by saying it's autoimmune they're saying

477
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,079
your body's attacking itself they're

478
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,760
saying your body's destroying itself so

479
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,720
that's what they're doing so think about

480
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,320
that for a minute

481
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,920
here you are you go to a doctor it's not

482
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
the doctor's fault doctors work for the

483
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,959
industry it's not doctors are amazing

484
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,040
it's not about the doctor

485
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,160
but you go to the doctor and the

486
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
doctor's gonna be like yeah you have an

487
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
autoimmune condition that's what you

488
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,079
have

489
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,519
so now you're you're making your protein

490
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,880
shakes now you're making your smoothies

491
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,639
now you're having your hard-boiled eggs

492
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,320
on salads now you're doing all this

493
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,839
because you're trying to eat healthy go

494
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,199
to a good functional medicine doctor and

495
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
they'll like get off a gluten get off of

496
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,600
this get off of that

497
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,760
but they still think you have an

498
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,240
autoimmune condition they're still

499
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,480
following that 1950s

500
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,519
theory where your body's attacking

501
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,839
itself

502
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,360
see autoimmune means your body's immune

503
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,240
system is attacking the glands and

504
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
organs

505
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
that's what it means that's a theory

506
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,959
that occurred

507
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:33,040
back in the technology of that you know

508
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:35,199
old school of the 1940s and the 1950s

509
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,800
that was a theory that came up because

510
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,519
science of research had to protect

511
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,079
itself

512
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,720
because millions of patients were coming

513
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,440
in

514
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,639
with new symptoms for the first time in

515
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,120
history

516
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,360
so please know that and there's no

517
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,480
science proven autoimmune yet the

518
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,240
autoimmune theory

519
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
there's no science or research that can

520
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,680
actually prove the autoimmune

521
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,880
theory okay that's how it works you can

522
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,639
look all you want

523
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,720
they'll still say your body's attacking

524
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,519
itself and they'll talk about an auto

525
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,160
antibody

526
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,959
but they could never find that auto

527
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,839
antibody

528
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,399
causing harm it's not possible it's

529
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,519
still

530
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,399
a complete and total theory a farce

531
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,720
actually

532
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,839
it's basically a ruse played on you and

533
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,199
i'll tell you why

534
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,440
it's to train you that you have a faulty

535
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,360
body that your sickness is your fault

536
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,720
it's not a pathogen it's not the

537
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
epstein-barr virus

538
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,639
it's not this it's not that the industry

539
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,920
doesn't want you knowing these truths

540
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,839
the industry doesn't want you knowing

541
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,360
any of that the industry wants to keep

542
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,279
you sick that's how the money machine

543
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,519
works you've heard of that right

544
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,839
well it's like that with autoimmune the

545
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,000
theory so this is how it works

546
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
in the 1950s they didn't know why all

547
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,839
these people were sick

548
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,839
they were pouring in and pouring in

549
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,040
symptoms they'd never seen before i've

550
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,959
even talked to old

551
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,959
doctors back in the day when they were

552
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,240
already 90 years old after practicing

553
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,160
way back then

554
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,839
and i've and i've talked to them and

555
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,040
they've told me how it all worked and

556
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,160
what was happening

557
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,959
and the autoimmune theory was just a way

558
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,480
to confuse people to protect science and

559
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,919
research because these signs of research

560
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,959
has to protect itself

561
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,720
and it uses you and women kind to do so

562
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,959
not in all fields i'm talking about

563
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,160
chronic illness so just know this not in

564
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,760
all fields

565
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,039
you know when i talk to scientists

566
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,720
they'll say the same thing they'll say

567
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,360
it doesn't it doesn't protect itself all

568
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,720
the time in

569
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,360
other areas and but it does in chronic

570
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
illness and

571
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,039
women suffering and struggling so when

572
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,039
women come in with all their different

573
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,480
symptoms or heart palpitations oh it's

574
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,799
their hormones

575
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,559
or all it's you know or their fatigue

576
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,559
their severe fatigue oh it's their body

577
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,160
attacking itself or it's in their head

578
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,200
and they're creating it

579
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,000
or it's genes these are techniques used

580
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
for the industry to protect itself so

581
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,919
first of all the industry

582
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,720
used eggs to raise all of these

583
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,280
pathogens

584
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,559
that make us sick then when everybody

585
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,120
got sick

586
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,360
and is getting sick now and pouring into

587
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
their offices and still today like never

588
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,240
before in history we have an epidemic

589
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,360
right now right

590
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,039
now that people are pouring in sick they

591
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,559
use the old theory that came out the

592
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,240
protected research and science the

593
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,240
grandfather law theory which is the

594
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,559
body's attacking itself how do you like

595
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,919
them

596
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,080
apples huh exactly so so

597
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,000
you're going to be say 22 years old 21

598
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,919
years old maybe 40 years old maybe 45

599
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,679
years old with your first diagnosis you

600
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,200
got a thyroid problem oh wait a minute i

601
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
got hashimoto's thyroiditis so i got

602
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,640
hyperthyroidism

603
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,400
and you're going to find out that's your

604
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,320
body attacking itself there's no answers

605
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,799
out there so there's no answers out

606
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,720
there

607
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,080
whether you like it or not about me

608
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,600
telling you this truth whether you're

609
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,440
somebody that's like ah that's not true

610
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,919
there's answers no no no i trust my

611
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,440
doctor no no i trust research in science

612
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,440
i trust all the different non-gluten

613
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,880
diets i trust everything

614
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,120
but you know what there's there's

615
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,960
something i call bullshitting yourself

616
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,120
and that's what people do every day and

617
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
they actually themselves to

618
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,039
still eat eggs that i've learned i'm

619
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,919
going to talk about that a little bit

620
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,320
here's here's how it works it's

621
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,640
important to know what causes sickness

622
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,440
so you can actually help others move

623
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
forward

624
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,840
rise out of this it's important to know

625
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,480
that pathogens

626
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,200
cause sickness heavy metals cause

627
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,320
sickness

628
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,600
mercury aluminum you know lead arsenic

629
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,320
uh nickel you know cadmium copper cause

630
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,039
illness and heavy metals like mercury

631
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,720
okay

632
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:31,600
with foods like eggs feed bugs

633
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,559
that keep us sick that keep us down that

634
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,320
keep us hurting

635
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,480
that keep us fatigued that keeper keep

636
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,799
give us thyroid problems and so forth

637
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,600
you have to break out of that whole

638
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,600
thing

639
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,039
where you actually think that your body

640
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,200
is attacking itself

641
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,640
or that you that you cause the problem

642
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,600
or its genes

643
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,000
or it's even the wrong foods you're

644
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,360
eating

645
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,120
people will be like well it's fruit

646
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,080
that's causing my hashimoto's that's

647
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,880
actually not even

648
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,080
possible fruit cannot feed pathogens

649
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,880
like viruses

650
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,320
they can't feed that they're actually

651
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,440
blueberries

652
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,520
help you get rid of pathogens they help

653
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
you get rid of viruses

654
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,280
they help you heal that's the whole

655
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,320
point and so you need to know there's

656
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,200
certain foods that

657
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,760
are medicine and there's foods that

658
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,080
aren't

659
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,559
medicine that's why it's so important

660
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,080
here that's why i'm talking about this

661
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,919
so many people are sick because they're

662
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,600
eating the wrong foods

663
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,280
and they think it's medicine they think

664
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,520
the wrong food is healing

665
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,120
and that's how it works they're also

666
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,080
told their body's attacking itself so

667
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,400
they're given no

668
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,320
answers it's why there are so many

669
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,760
people healing with medical medium

670
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,280
information the reason why there's so

671
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,000
many people healing with medical medium

672
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,760
information

673
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
globally out there because of the

674
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,919
millions of books that got out there

675
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,120
all in the world is because they have

676
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,600
the truth

677
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,840
and they and they know better not to

678
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,039
just yes themselves they know it they

679
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,320
know what they've been through they've

680
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,559
been to 10 doctors

681
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,080
they've been to 15 doctors they've seen

682
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,960
how hard it is they've been to four

683
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,360
neurologists

684
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
they've been through hell and back they

685
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
bend down on their hands and knees

686
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,000
suffering

687
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,000
and they paid tons of money and they put

688
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,559
so much money out in so many different

689
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,919
ways

690
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,080
and they've suffered and they've

691
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,120
struggled okay and they know

692
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,240
this and so what happens is those people

693
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,159
that have healed through the medical

694
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,720
medium information know not to eat eggs

695
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,159
but hey

696
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,840
but this might be the first time you've

697
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,240
ever seen a video of me

698
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,760
first time you ever heard about my books

699
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,760
so we're gonna go into more of this so

700
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,000
just back to the autoimmune theory

701
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,679
it's not your body attacking itself

702
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,080
that's not how it works

703
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,039
and that's just a complete and total

704
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,360
fraudulent

705
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,400
theory that was created to protect

706
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,440
science because there were no answers

707
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,760
and so every single illness now is

708
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,559
classified practically every single you

709
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,840
have to understand

710
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,159
it's not just 10 illnesses 20 illnesses

711
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,880
or a hundred we're in hundreds of

712
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,200
different

713
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,799
conditions now are classified in the

714
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,840
autoimmune category

715
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,080
because they have no answers

716
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,360
and then you're supposed to believe your

717
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,799
body caused it

718
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,880
and then when you sit there with that

719
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,080
autoimmune diagnosis you're eating your

720
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,000
eggs

721
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,360
because you're told by some dietitian i

722
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
mean i love dietitians there's some

723
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
really great ones

724
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,280
out there that know about medical medium

725
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,880
information and or more decent

726
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,559
information in general

727
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,320
but you'll be told by some dietitian and

728
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,000
keep on doing the eggs you'll be told by

729
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,080
a nutritionist keep on eating your eggs

730
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,679
because it's high in protein

731
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,200
and then what happens is if you've even

732
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,720
started recovering because you got rid

733
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,320
of certain foods like you got rid of

734
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,360
gluten and you got rid of fried foods

735
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,559
and you've been eating healthy and

736
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,840
you're exercising a little and you're

737
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,280
starting to do some recovery and you're

738
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
seeing a good functional medicine doctor

739
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,760
and you're taking good supplements

740
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,720
you're starting to just come out of it a

741
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
little bit you're still going to be

742
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,840
eating eggs

743
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,520
and then boom years later you get a new

744
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,240
problem boom you get or you get a

745
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
relapse

746
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,919
or you just you're back to where you

747
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,400
were before see

748
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,760
they don't know what causes illnesses

749
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,080
that's how it works

750
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,080
you go to practitioners they don't know

751
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,360
not all practitioners know the ones that

752
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
actually know about medical medium

753
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,919
information

754
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,360
they know what's going on they know

755
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,440
what's causing diseases

756
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,200
they know that epstein-barr one of the

757
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,720
60 varieties of epstein-barr which i'll

758
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,880
talk about in a little bit

759
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,799
what that is about they know that that

760
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
virus causes more than a little bit of

761
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,919
tiredness

762
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,360
it causes aches and pains it causes

763
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,440
fibromyalgia it causes

764
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,480
rheumatoid arthritis it causes eczema

765
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,240
and psoriasis

766
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,919
it causes hashimoto's thyroiditis it

767
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
causes multiple sclerosis it causes

768
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,120
aches and pains tingles and numbness

769
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,559
ringing the ears vertigo that's just the

770
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,440
touch of what it causes

771
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,760
okay and that's not even pcos because it

772
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,280
causes pcos too and some reproductive

773
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,120
problems and conditions

774
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,480
so that's what epstein-barr causes

775
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,360
you're not going to get that you're not

776
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,880
going to get that clear

777
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,880
information instead you'll be told to

778
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
keep on eating your eggs and that

779
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,159
yeah you have autoimmune and you need to

780
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,679
do maybe an aip

781
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,440
diet or some other kind of diet and so

782
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,720
forth and it's not that i'm against any

783
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,159
diets that's not it

784
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,120
it's just that it can't subscribe to a

785
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,120
belief system what happens is people

786
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,880
they fall into a belief system they have

787
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,120
no choice they fall into a belief system

788
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,880
and that's what they do i can't do that

789
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,720
that's why i'm not in the food wars

790
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,240
that's why i'm not like you know i'm not

791
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,679
throwing stones at the vegans i'm not

792
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,039
throwing stones at the paleo

793
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,120
you know people they can eat animal

794
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,799
protein i'm just gonna teach you

795
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,440
what foods actually feed the real

796
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,360
problems why people are really sick

797
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,679
how to do something about that and

798
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,880
that's what the youtube subs live series

799
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,080
is going to be about like i'm going to

800
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,279
be bringing on the guests i'm going to

801
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,720
be bringing on other people

802
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,400
in the future episodes what we're going

803
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,240
to be doing but i'm going to make sure

804
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,559
you have the answers you need so let's

805
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,600
talk about lyme disease a little bit

806
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,360
i want to cover that lyme disease

807
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,520
everybody thought it was all sewed up

808
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,200
they all thought it was bacteria it was

809
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,440
bacterial you got the bartonella

810
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,880
you got the babesia got the borrelia and

811
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,080
that's what they thought it all was in

812
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,320
the past okay

813
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,480
that was the whole thing now you just

814
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,159
need to know something because of the

815
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,679
medical medium information

816
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,440
and the millions of books that got out

817
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,360
there in the world and the amount of

818
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,080
doctors using the medical medium

819
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,400
information

820
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,159
at this point now in time the lyme

821
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,240
disease information has changed out

822
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,640
there because of medical medium books

823
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,919
it is actually altered so which is

824
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,080
actually a good thing

825
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,840
but it's what happened out there the

826
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,200
industry is sneaky though

827
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,559
they don't like when this information

828
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,159
gets out there they don't like when the

829
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,080
truth gets out there because they know

830
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,440
it threatens them in so many ways it

831
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,640
threatens them from making money it

832
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,000
threatens them in different ways from

833
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,080
taking control

834
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,679
they don't want women kind taking

835
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
control over their lives over their

836
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,840
health

837
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,080
and they want to make sure they sell as

838
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,679
many antibiotics as they possibly can so

839
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,000
the lyme disease movement is all about

840
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,919
selling

841
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,520
as many antibiotics as possible the

842
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,279
industry wants to do it they've made

843
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,200
trillion dollars on antibiotics in the

844
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,720
last 35 years still a lot of money no

845
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,799
one wants to lose that

846
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,960
so but what happened with the medical

847
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,679
medium information the truth got out

848
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,200
there

849
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,000
thousands and thousands of doctors just

850
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,559
in this country alone and globally

851
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,840
know that lyme disease is viral that

852
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,360
bacteria can't

853
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,039
cause a neurotoxic response

854
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,400
like all of the neurological lyme

855
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,880
patients go through

856
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,320
i actually broke that information out

857
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,840
there in the world through through my

858
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,120
source that you guys learn about if

859
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,320
you've never heard about that it's all

860
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,559
in the books

861
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,480
and so that information is changing the

862
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,960
world but what the industry did to try

863
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,919
to kind of like catch up to itself a

864
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,400
little bit they took

865
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,279
lyme disease they removed it from

866
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,120
bacteria

867
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,799
category even though the lyme labs still

868
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,200
test for bacteria and all that they took

869
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,880
it from this category of just bacteria

870
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,320
bacterial and they placed it in the

871
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,279
autoimmune category

872
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,039
they now say lyme disease is in the

873
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,799
autoimmune category

874
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,440
now it can't be in the autoimmune

875
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,760
category if it's bacterial related

876
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,320
but you see how that works they just

877
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,000
took lyme disease after 35 years

878
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,520
out from underneath everybody no one's

879
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
even realizing it

880
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,720
and they placed it in the autoimmune

881
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,640
category

882
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,559
which means they're telling you that

883
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,400
your lyme disease and lyme symptoms are

884
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,880
now your body attacking itself wait a

885
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,559
minute wasn't it bacteria for 35 years

886
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,320
didn't they literally bomb the hell out

887
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,880
of people with antibiotics

888
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,320
decade after decade and tortured women

889
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,640
kind and tortured people

890
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,159
literally i mean people have suffered

891
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,760
you wouldn't believe if you don't know

892
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,600
about this you wouldn't believe with

893
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,120
lyme people lyme patients have gone

894
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,200
through in the hell they've been through

895
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,159
it's so heartbreaking you just can't

896
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,360
even imagine

897
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,679
you can't even imagine see they placed

898
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,080
it in the autoimmune category

899
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,440
for a reason because we've altered the

900
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,720
information out there

901
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,039
because people are healing when they

902
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,159
realize it's viral

903
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,120
see look babesia bartonella borrelia

904
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,760
they're not superbugs they can't harm

905
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,200
you like people really believe so

906
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,039
see that's how it works they can't

907
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,799
produce a neurotoxin

908
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,399
because they can't produce a neurotoxin

909
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,240
like viruses like epstein-barr

910
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,120
hhv-6 shingles varieties and other

911
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,120
viruses hhv-7 simplexes and so forth

912
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,200
they can't produce a neurotoxin

913
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,120
neurotoxins is why people suffer with

914
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,840
neurological lyme symptoms

915
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,360
that's how it works and the industry

916
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,960
they got kind of wise to what was

917
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,240
happening and what was shifting so they

918
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,480
took the actual

919
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,399
diagnosis of lyme disease that condition

920
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,320
and they placed it in autoimmune

921
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,240
now they're teaching people that's your

922
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,240
body attacking itself that's what it is

923
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,919
they're leaving the bacteria

924
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,640
aspect of it out of it because the

925
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,840
bacteria was never the problem

926
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,840
mrsa has a higher healing response rate

927
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,039
of recovery with antibiotics

928
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,760
than bartonella babisia okay because

929
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,240
and borrelia there's a reason for that

930
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,520
because

931
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,080
mrsa is a real superbug but yet has a

932
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,679
higher response rate in recovery the

933
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,799
reason why people with lyme

934
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,240
suffered all these years with

935
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,919
antibiotics and they've been they've

936
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,240
been bombarded with antibiotics in their

937
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,760
system and haven't had good recoveries

938
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,520
and they've even gotten worse so many of

939
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,960
them is because

940
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,399
they were viral when you use antibiotics

941
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,799
for viral conditions you suffer worse

942
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,080
that's how it works and that's what

943
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,200
happens

944
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,720
see if the bacteria borrelia and the and

945
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,559
the hybrid babesia

946
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,240
and the bartonella were the true causes

947
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,720
of lyme disease antibiotics would kill

948
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,399
them off so simply and easily

949
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,720
because they're not superbugs like even

950
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,320
mrsa and mrsa has a higher kill off in a

951
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,159
response rate of recovery

952
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,640
my god i've known so many people that

953
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,240
have you know had mrsa and recovered and

954
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,840
that's like the superbug one of the

955
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,120
superbugs

956
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,799
and that's how it works see lime lyme

957
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
people people that have dealt with lyme

958
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,279
disease and everything else and they're

959
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
dealing with the symptoms neurological

960
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,159
lyme and all that lyme disease patients

961
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,279
would be freed up in a heartbeat from an

962
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,679
antibiotic

963
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,880
and a heartbeat and and it would never

964
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,039
come back

965
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,720
and so but the reason why they don't and

966
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,480
they end up getting sick again or they

967
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,640
end up suffering either way

968
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,640
the reason why it's always been viral

969
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,039
that's why antibiotics are being phased

970
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,360
out of lyme disease protocols

971
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,960
doctors now lyme doctors are using half

972
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,399
the amount a quarter of the amount

973
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,720
now they're bringing it down to a

974
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,720
fraction because they know better

975
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,000
they've seen the wake of the hell that

976
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,600
has happened and they've seen what

977
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,880
people have gone through

978
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,960
and what do they do though everybody

979
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,960
just tells everybody to eat eggs just

980
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,960
everybody just eat eggs i mean that's

981
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,880
how it works just lots of eggs

982
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,120
and so and those eggs feed the viruses

983
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,200
behind lyme disease

984
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,120
so the medical medium information was to

985
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,279
bring out the truth that it's viral

986
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,679
that it's viral neurotoxins produced by

987
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,840
viruses causing neurological lyme

988
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,679
the industry got wise they placed it in

989
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,080
the autoimmune category now

990
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,520
okay that's how it is and now the

991
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,120
autoimmune category means your body's

992
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,799
attacking itself wait a minute what lyme

993
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,399
wasn't bacteria i'm confused now the

994
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,520
body's attacking itself what is it down

995
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,320
they're slipping in there and they're

996
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,640
kind of like

997
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,159
and all the big doctors now and all the

998
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,679
big protocols they're backing down on

999
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,440
the antibiotics you see and then they're

1000
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,880
using more natural things they're using

1001
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,320
more natural stuff they're using the

1002
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,399
diets and people are recovering but the

1003
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,799
reason why they're starting to recover

1004
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,320
is because they're viral and that when

1005
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,760
you clean up your diet and your diet

1006
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,200
gets better especially with the medical

1007
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,559
medium information of what foods to

1008
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,000
eliminate when you clean up your diet

1009
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,399
and everything starts to go down you

1010
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,840
start

1011
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,519
getting rid of all the bad foods

1012
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,919
including the eggs

1013
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,440
that's right your symptoms start to back

1014
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,039
down and they start to back down and you

1015
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,799
start to recover

1016
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,640
and so that's just a whole example of

1017
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,559
lyme disease autoimmune

1018
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,240
how things work how the system out there

1019
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,440
works the trickery of what's happening

1020
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,000
the aspect of it all

1021
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,840
so it's so important to know this so

1022
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,360
just to recap real quick before we move

1023
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,000
on because we're moving on to some cool

1024
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,320
stuff

1025
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,840
without a doubt so a little recap on

1026
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,679
things okay

1027
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,960
and i love the comments coming up it's

1028
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,880
incredible so

1029
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,200
um i'm gonna answer questions if if the

1030
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,799
eggs are organic is that a good thing so

1031
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,559
we'll cover that in a little bit

1032
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,679
um the whole bit so there's because

1033
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,120
there's important things to know about

1034
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,159
how eggs work so i'll check out the

1035
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,240
comments too

1036
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:43,360
um let's go into food as medicine

1037
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,519
so what food is medicine okay is it egg

1038
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,919
medicine is it egg medicinal no it's not

1039
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,679
it's not a medicine it's not medicinal

1040
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,960
this is so important to understand it's

1041
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,440
critical okay

1042
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,159
spinach is a medicine so just know the

1043
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,640
difference

1044
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,080
get the reference you know like like

1045
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,240
know what we're talking about

1046
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,200
like all of us are talking about right

1047
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,320
just like

1048
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,440
spinach is medicine yeah of course it is

1049
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,519
you know that i mean

1050
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,120
of course you know it's medicine i mean

1051
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,720
a pile of spinach in front of you

1052
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,320
you know that's medicinal you know

1053
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,960
that's medicine okay

1054
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,279
eggs no they're not medicine and there's

1055
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,880
a spark in us that knows that why do you

1056
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,559
think eggs in moderation

1057
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,880
you've heard that oh eat eggs in

1058
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,080
moderation why could you probably get a

1059
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,200
heart attack and die they're worried

1060
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,039
about like yeah

1061
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,640
that's one of the things like why eat

1062
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,200
eggs in moderation

1063
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,080
you've heard that one spinach in

1064
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,159
moderation

1065
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,519
i don't think so you can eat spinach all

1066
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,200
you want the whole bit

1067
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,399
i mean but eggs in moderation that

1068
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,519
phrase came around because of high

1069
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,000
cholesterol

1070
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,960
because of because of plaque in the

1071
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,039
arteries

1072
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,720
because of your blood clots because of

1073
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,600
all kinds of other issues high blood

1074
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,880
pressure

1075
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,360
so that's so that's where eggs in

1076
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,559
moderation was a concern

1077
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,679
because it's not a medicine it's not

1078
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:00,480
it's actually a food that's you know

1079
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,200
constantly promoted by backers of the

1080
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,720
industry

1081
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,360
for a reason so we'll go into that a

1082
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,000
little bit celery juice

1083
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,120
is this medicine or is this not medicine

1084
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,679
it's medicine

1085
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,200
spinach medicine wild blueberries

1086
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,679
medicine

1087
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,720
blueberries medicine potato even a

1088
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,000
potato

1089
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,200
medicine so you know potato without

1090
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,240
cream without butter

1091
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,559
without you know without any of that yes

1092
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,519
in important you know potatoes without

1093
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,919
cream butter

1094
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,679
cheese all of that so i want to talk

1095
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,840
about potato for a second somebody

1096
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,720
like out there you guys might be vibing

1097
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,399
us the

1098
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,919
feeling well potato is not medicine

1099
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,320
potatoes terrible for you i'm on this

1100
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,640
certain diet potatoes bad for me oh i'm

1101
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
just

1102
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,600
i'm gonna just completely all this

1103
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,039
information doesn't mean anything to me

1104
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,440
now because i've learned potatoes are

1105
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,559
bad out there from some kind of diet

1106
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,799
so if you're somebody that's getting

1107
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,559
that that feeling of like why is he

1108
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,039
talking about potato there's something

1109
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,760
called

1110
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,600
lysine lysine is inside potato

1111
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,080
people are suffering out there with the

1112
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,919
epstein-barr viruses the shingles riot

1113
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,120
do you know anybody that has jaw pain

1114
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,480
neck pain that they're it's

1115
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,639
unexplainable

1116
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,159
they got trigeminal neuralgia they got

1117
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,919
migraines they got headaches that's the

1118
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,399
shingles virus that can cause

1119
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,079
all of that chronic sciatic nerves

1120
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,599
sciatica problems if you know a relative

1121
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,440
or a friend that has a back problem that

1122
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,760
just doesn't want to back down

1123
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,359
surgery or no surgery or whatever it is

1124
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,599
shingles variety see shingles there's

1125
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,879
over 30 varieties of undiscovered

1126
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,879
shingles varieties i mean that's the

1127
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,440
whole thing see epstein-barr

1128
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,720
there's over 60 varieties only one they

1129
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,560
have discovered out there

1130
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,320
they don't have the over 60 price of

1131
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,839
mutations and strains

1132
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,679
so let's go into this a little bit um

1133
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,720
we're talking about foods as foods as

1134
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,679
medicine we're talking about the

1135
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,960
potatoes the lysine lysine

1136
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,240
actually harms viruses so that's how it

1137
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,079
works so just pretend

1138
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,679
you know just pretend that look this is

1139
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,280
a virus i got the little critter in my

1140
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,960
hand right here i've done this before

1141
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,400
say that's the virus the pathogen the

1142
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,480
invader lysine when you eat a potato

1143
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,160
starts to hurt the invader starts to

1144
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,720
take down the invader starts to take

1145
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,960
down the pathogen that's how it works so

1146
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,760
potato has something in it that is

1147
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,160
medicine

1148
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,280
to stop conditions that lyme suffers

1149
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,200
fibromyalgia

1150
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,480
chronic fatigue syndrome you know me

1151
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,520
chronic fatigue syndrome all the

1152
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,920
different conditions

1153
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,280
just regular fatigue all of it people

1154
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,359
that suffer with

1155
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,800
what happens is potato actually helps

1156
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,160
you heal it is one of the foods is

1157
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,680
medicine but it shows you how the

1158
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,280
industries don't know this

1159
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,280
and they'll just be like oh it's a carb

1160
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,960
toss it or whatever but that's a prime

1161
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,720
example of how the industries and how

1162
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,160
people in the diet fads and trends don't

1163
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,440
know what causes your symptoms or

1164
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,839
conditions or illnesses

1165
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,480
that's how it works celery juice is a

1166
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,960
medicine

1167
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,680
helps to actually destroy and kill off

1168
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,000
bugs

1169
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,000
so it actually helps to kill off viruses

1170
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,240
and that's what's important

1171
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,640
so i'm going into stuff like that no one

1172
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,560
eats potatoes by itself so caught a bad

1173
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,400
wraps everybody eats potatoes with sour

1174
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,400
cream they protect you know the potatoes

1175
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,560
cheese on it with butter on it so yeah

1176
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,839
it is it it actually is bad for you at

1177
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,119
that point it's not going to help you

1178
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,880
with all of that on there

1179
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,240
and they put oil on it all of that

1180
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,160
doesn't help so yeah

1181
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,599
it catches a bad wrap and rightfully so

1182
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,480
if you're going to do all that to it it

1183
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,320
doesn't work

1184
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,160
so let's go into another thing too

1185
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,320
everybody is guessing out there so that

1186
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,960
leads me into this next part

1187
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,880
everybody's guessing that's how it works

1188
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,760
so everybody in the industry is they're

1189
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,240
guessing

1190
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,400
to what food is right to what can heal

1191
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,599
you to what is good it's all

1192
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,760
guessing games that's how it works much

1193
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,160
of it built off of theories

1194
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,280
it's a prime example how everyone is

1195
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,880
guessing and no one knows how to heal

1196
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,560
and you can watch this on people's

1197
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,760
youtube channels you can see you can see

1198
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,119
what they were doing two years ago on

1199
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,000
the youtube channel you can see all of a

1200
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,040
sudden they're doing this and they're

1201
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,920
changing it up and they're starting to

1202
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,359
get a little better and they start

1203
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,400
getting a little worse again

1204
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,240
and they're confused and they're

1205
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,040
shifting their diet or you can see it on

1206
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,320
the youtube or

1207
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,079
you know different episodes of people

1208
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,599
where it goes back a few years ago or a

1209
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,359
couple years ago you can watch the

1210
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,920
progression now

1211
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,280
of people getting sicker too you can

1212
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,720
watch that too you can see it when

1213
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,160
they're younger and then three years

1214
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,280
later they're starting to get excellent

1215
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
for the first time in their life

1216
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,680
they're starting to get something for

1217
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,119
the first time in your life and you can

1218
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,560
actually witness this

1219
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,920
and they're trying different diets and

1220
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,200
different trends and they're working out

1221
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,680
and you can see

1222
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,200
where everybody really still doesn't

1223
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,520
know what they're doing everybody is

1224
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,079
guessing including the big diet people

1225
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,680
out there

1226
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,760
being the people that back the trends

1227
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,200
the people that actually start the big

1228
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,800
diet trends out there

1229
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,160
they don't know what actually heals

1230
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,880
somebody or doesn't heal somebody

1231
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,079
because

1232
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,200
once again how can you actually know

1233
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,599
what heals someone when you don't know

1234
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,800
what

1235
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,200
causes their illness so critical to know

1236
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,560
so

1237
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,240
if you're suffering with any chronic

1238
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,480
illness say just

1239
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,760
you think about that for two seconds how

1240
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,720
does anybody know

1241
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,480
which you know how to heal someone if

1242
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,200
they don't know what's causing

1243
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,880
the problem you have to know the cause

1244
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,359
in order to heal you have to know the

1245
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,119
cause

1246
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,960
you have to know what's causing your

1247
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,800
illness so then you can know

1248
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,480
not to eat this when you have pcos when

1249
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,200
you have endometriosis

1250
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,079
when you have you know chronic utis when

1251
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,320
you have all kinds of different

1252
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,640
conditions or reproductive conditions

1253
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,359
you no one's going to know hey you can't

1254
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,040
eat that

1255
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,880
because that's going to feed a virus

1256
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,640
that's responsible for your condition

1257
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,079
or breast cancer same thing with breast

1258
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,920
cancer no one's going to know

1259
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,119
hey you know that's the thing when

1260
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,160
people get breast cancer they're told to

1261
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,880
eat more eggs

1262
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,800
when people get pcos they're told to eat

1263
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,320
more eggs and people get endometriosis

1264
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,000
they're told to eat more eggs they're so

1265
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,599
no eat eggs eat this and they'll say

1266
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,119
sure eat salads and

1267
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,760
and some vegetables and eat your

1268
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,440
vegetables and maybe have a few berries

1269
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,920
you'll hear all that stuff out there but

1270
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,280
they'll leave the eggs in there 100

1271
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,000
which will make pcos worse and worse

1272
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,920
and worse and so that's an example so

1273
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,040
how is it possible

1274
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,119
that everybody knows what they're

1275
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,640
talking about there out there about what

1276
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,400
can heal and what can help

1277
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,760
when they don't even know the cause of

1278
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,880
the pcos

1279
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,960
they don't know the cause of the

1280
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,520
endometriosis they don't know the

1281
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,880
constant cause of chronic utis

1282
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,400
they don't know the cause of your eczema

1283
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,839
psoriasis they don't know the cause of

1284
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,440
your fibromyalgia your multiple

1285
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,560
sclerosis your aches and pains your

1286
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,240
tingles and numbness your chronic

1287
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,640
vertigo your balance issues your brain

1288
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,800
fog

1289
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,480
if they are the cause of your brain fog

1290
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,920
then how do they know what's going to

1291
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,079
heal it

1292
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,000
and so the medical mean information is

1293
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,920
all about getting those answers

1294
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,440
it's like that with breast cancer they

1295
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,720
don't know the cause of breast cancer

1296
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,880
because they still don't know the cause

1297
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,240
they're just starting to link up steam

1298
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,480
bar virus because that is

1299
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,680
the true cause just starting to link

1300
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,200
that finally

1301
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,720
with all the medical medium information

1302
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,480
that's gotten out there for all these

1303
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,520
years and it just finally the length of

1304
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,800
that it's just fine

1305
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,320
i talked to scientists and lab

1306
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,680
technicians that are pro medical medium

1307
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,880
information out there

1308
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,680
i'm going to interview some of them

1309
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,880
along the way and they'll talk about how

1310
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,280
yeah i mean

1311
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,960
this is the information this is the way

1312
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,280
to go look

1313
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,240
chronic illness isn't about laying in a

1314
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,800
bed dying

1315
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,320
and and and believe me there's plenty of

1316
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,680
people out there doing that it's the

1317
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,599
saddest thing out there

1318
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,680
it's a saddest thing it's heartbreaking

1319
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,960
it's disturbing in so many ways

1320
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,520
it's it's heart crushing but chronic

1321
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,000
illness

1322
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,079
is any symptom condition that you got

1323
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,119
or you're developing or going to develop

1324
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,880
10 years from now

1325
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,720
are going to develop it's easy when

1326
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,560
you're 20 years old and just really you

1327
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,800
don't have much going on

1328
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,720
and then all of a sudden you start

1329
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,520
getting that brain fog while you're 27

1330
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,040
years old

1331
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,400
and that brain fog is getting in the way

1332
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,520
of your career getting in the way of

1333
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,200
things and then all of a sudden you find

1334
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,800
your thyroid count is off your

1335
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,920
if your thyroid numbers are off and all

1336
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,000
of a sudden you find other things are

1337
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,800
going on and it's happening to everyone

1338
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,280
no one's escaping it's happening but you

1339
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,119
can stop it you can learn how to heal it

1340
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,400
you can figure out how to you can figure

1341
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,240
out what the cause is

1342
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,520
all of that's possible that's the whole

1343
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,760
point so

1344
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,440
it's so critical to know so a chronic

1345
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,599
symptom and condition

1346
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,280
chronic illness is any symptom you're

1347
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,760
battling with or struggling with that

1348
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,400
isn't

1349
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,960
helping you that is hurting you in some

1350
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,599
way

1351
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,960
or lowering the quality of your life or

1352
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,359
reducing you know

1353
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,880
your your positive nature your outlook

1354
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,160
on life because you're just bummed out

1355
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,640
because you got these symptoms and

1356
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,880
whatever it is the symptom is

1357
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,079
they actually those symptoms keep us

1358
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,400
down

1359
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,079
and they keep us down and that's that's

1360
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,079
chronic illness chronic illness isn't

1361
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,240
the person that's in a bed dying and

1362
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,520
there's like i said so many are in that

1363
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,720
condition

1364
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,680
and it's so sad but chronic illness is

1365
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,880
all kinds of stuff

1366
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,160
it's all kinds of symptoms that you're

1367
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,680
dealing with so let's talk about the

1368
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,200
protein and eggs

1369
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,319
um so yeah so it's great comments coming

1370
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,560
up thanks guys

1371
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,760
really appreciate it i love doing this

1372
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,680
live

1373
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,440
not edited or anything it's like youtube

1374
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,359
live it's just so fun to do

1375
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,200
the protein and eggs let's go into that

1376
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,880
a little bit okay

1377
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,720
is it good for us hey you should eat

1378
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,200
your eggs because of protein so maybe we

1379
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,560
should have

1380
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,240
eggs because the protein look at all

1381
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,359
this protein here so you'll hear it over

1382
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,200
and over and over again it's like a

1383
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,599
brainwashing out there

1384
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,640
and but what no one understands or

1385
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,160
nobody knows

1386
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,560
or no one realizes is protein

1387
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,880
was one of the food sources that was

1388
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,200
given to bugs to keep them alive

1389
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,480
it's one of the sources so it's protein

1390
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,599
inside eggs

1391
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,160
that kept bugs alive in the labs they

1392
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,000
learn to feed off of the sticky protein

1393
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,079
that's in eggs

1394
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
so that's what happened so when you're

1395
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,000
eating egg proteins

1396
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,680
they're slowly feeding things because

1397
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,359
everybody has things in them

1398
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,040
and they will get something eventually

1399
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,319
they'll pick it up they'll pick it up in

1400
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,880
different ways pick it up from

1401
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,960
a new relationship people in new

1402
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,880
relationships pass the bugs along

1403
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,079
say somebody has acne okay and they've

1404
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,400
taken antibiotics for

1405
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,079
their acne over and over again that

1406
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,319
streptococcus that they have

1407
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,560
which causes their cystic acne because

1408
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:51,520
that's the true cause of acne

1409
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,960
that strep actually gets stronger and

1410
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,800
stronger with antibiotics then you get

1411
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,720
into a new relationship that strep gets

1412
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,400
passed to another person and that person

1413
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,720
has that streptococcus

1414
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,319
and so we we tend to pass all of these

1415
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,160
bugs around and then bugs continue to

1416
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,560
get stronger as the years go on we pass

1417
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,800
along the epstein bars we which is mono

1418
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,560
nucleosis we pass along all the

1419
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,000
different h pylori

1420
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,760
we pass along these things we get them

1421
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,599
from restaurant food we get them from

1422
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,880
restaurant glasses we get them from

1423
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,880
all kinds of different things we get

1424
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,960
them from people not washing their hands

1425
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,960
and working in places we get them from

1426
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,960
public bathrooms we just get

1427
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,640
bugs and we're going to get them along

1428
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,000
the way in our life one way or another

1429
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,200
because we're going to sit on a plane

1430
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,800
somewhere and we're going to

1431
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,599
pick up a bug somewhere and we're going

1432
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,680
to be in a on a plane bathroom

1433
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,440
and we're just going to get bugs in her

1434
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,720
life if we're not careful we're not

1435
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,319
cautious but we're going to get him

1436
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,880
that's how life works

1437
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,040
with those bugs they just they incubate

1438
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,040
over time i'm just being straight out

1439
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,200
i'm just telling it like it is because

1440
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,960
if i if i keep the truth from you and i

1441
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,640
act like you know and i just

1442
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,920
talk silly stuff out there like you

1443
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,359
should have some butter in your coffee

1444
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,880
or something or if i talk silly

1445
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,359
stuff out there like you should be doing

1446
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,760
this that and not have the answers to

1447
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,319
heal

1448
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,760
it's not enough we need more i want to

1449
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,599
protect you it's about protecting

1450
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,119
yourself it's about making sure you have

1451
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,520
the answer so you can protect yourself

1452
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,440
so we actually pass around these bugs

1453
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,079
and then we eat eggs and we feed the

1454
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,839
bugs we may not see a problem in a while

1455
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,359
sometimes we go through a lot of stress

1456
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,119
we go through some emotional heartaches

1457
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,560
some heartbreaks things like that trust

1458
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,079
gets broken next thing you know what our

1459
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,680
immune system gets knocked down a little

1460
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,880
bit and then the bugs that we have

1461
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,119
floating around in us

1462
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,560
get left lots of ample food we have some

1463
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,319
eggs and then we get in trouble with

1464
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,920
that i haven't covered the emotional

1465
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,680
aspect about eggs and why we're so

1466
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,880
attached to them and how i understand

1467
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,200
i want to do that too i don't want to

1468
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,520
forget about that the other thing that's

1469
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,319
in

1470
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,680
eggs are hormones let's cover that now

1471
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,960
some of you out there might be like well

1472
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,800
he's talking about hormones and eggs but

1473
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,960
i eat organic eggs they free-range eggs

1474
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,079
i eat my own eggs no no no i'm talking

1475
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,480
about

1476
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,119
the hormones that are in those those

1477
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,359
eggs

1478
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,800
these these are organic eggs right here

1479
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,960
and there's hormones in these

1480
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,040
they're just not added but there's

1481
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,119
hormones naturally occurring to grow

1482
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,839
that baby chicken that's how important

1483
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,000
it is to understand this stuff and so

1484
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,880
these hormones were another food used in

1485
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,599
labs to raise

1486
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,040
all of the bugs that keep us sick sick

1487
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,240
let's just cover the bugs for two

1488
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,319
seconds first okay

1489
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,160
so there's over 60 varieties of

1490
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,560
epstein-barr mutated strains and so

1491
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,640
forth

1492
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,319
over 30 varieties of shingles

1493
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,920
undiscovered by research and science

1494
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,240
that plague people left and right out

1495
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,720
there

1496
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,920
they give them a neuropathy they give

1497
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,359
them all kinds of aches and pains

1498
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,280
trigeminal neuralgia

1499
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,640
they give them bell's palsy everything

1500
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,560
so there's all these different kinds of

1501
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,280
shingles varieties out there non-rashing

1502
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,640
and rashing

1503
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,200
there's hhv-6s there's hhv-7s out there

1504
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,680
too

1505
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,040
there's simplex 1 simplex 2 and all the

1506
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,480
different mutations and varieties that

1507
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,280
are being passed around all over the

1508
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,359
place

1509
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,480
and then there's cytomegalovirus there's

1510
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,480
that one as well

1511
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,720
then there's the undiscovered hhv 10s

1512
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,000
11s 12's 13s through 16

1513
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,000
that scientific research doesn't even

1514
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,960
have their finger or pulse on on any

1515
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,319
level

1516
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,520
so you got all these different viruses

1517
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,760
then you have the different varieties of

1518
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,240
streptococcus over 50 groups of strep

1519
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,760
now are developing over 50 groups and

1520
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,400
multiple strains per

1521
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,160
group you can't even the alphabet won't

1522
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,720
even cover it now you speak group a

1523
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,079
group b

1524
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,040
strap group c uh um you know d

1525
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,800
h whatever and you know the whole bit e

1526
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,319
so what happens is that

1527
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,480
i probably got it backwards right there

1528
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,160
but the groups have different strains

1529
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,079
and multiple mutations

1530
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,920
these are all the bugs i'm talking about

1531
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,520
that are keeping everybody sick

1532
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,280
you can arm yourself you can knock them

1533
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,800
down you can clean up your illnesses you

1534
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,079
can be like other people medical medium

1535
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,119
information in the books that actually

1536
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,800
understand this stuff

1537
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,720
and actually realize that doctors don't

1538
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,440
know that most doctors don't even have

1539
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,280
an idea

1540
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,040
or or know about this it's not their

1541
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,480
fault all doctors are good because they

1542
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,319
want people to heal they're in it their

1543
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,720
hearts in it i know lots of doctors work

1544
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,000
with them

1545
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,760
there's doctors on the front of these

1546
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,119
books that that have written

1547
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,960
forwards on the front of these books and

1548
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,079
there's amazing physicians out there

1549
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,599
done incredible work out there but when

1550
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,520
it comes down to eggs you're just going

1551
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,680
to feed the bugs so much as this this is

1552
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,240
so important to know about

1553
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,520
so it doesn't matter if it's organic

1554
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,359
doesn't matter if it's free range

1555
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,800
doesn't matter if you grew it yourself

1556
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,200
it's going to have hormones in it that

1557
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,880
feed

1558
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,960
the viruses it's going to have a protein

1559
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,520
that feeds viruses and bacteria

1560
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,200
and keep us sick that's the bottom line

1561
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,800
so all of this is important to know

1562
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,599
about let's keep on going a little bit

1563
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,520
further and all this so

1564
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,880
a lot of people ask the question and

1565
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,000
this is a good one a lot of people ask

1566
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,040
the question

1567
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,640
um is raw egg okay

1568
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,720
so that's what they'll do is raw egg

1569
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,880
okay the whole bit now

1570
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,800
raw egg is definitely better than cooked

1571
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,400
egg but still with raw egg you got to

1572
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,240
worry about other problems

1573
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,920
one being the main problem it'll feed

1574
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,319
your pathogens it'll still

1575
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,280
feed everything viruses will will eat

1576
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,440
raw egg

1577
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,200
they'll be cooked egg pathogens will eat

1578
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,920
raw egg cooked egg that's just what they

1579
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,280
do

1580
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,200
and then when you cook an egg you

1581
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,640
denature what's even good in it that

1582
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,800
people think is good in it so the

1583
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,119
omega-3 everybody says is good in eggs

1584
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,119
you

1585
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,119
cook it you destroy it so you're not

1586
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,880
even using the omega-3

1587
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,400
so anybody who says well hey look

1588
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,839
there's omega-3 in eggs

1589
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,200
yeah good luck getting it if you're

1590
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,839
cooking it because you're destroying the

1591
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,680
omega-3 you can't cook omega-3

1592
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,760
it won't work in your body it just it

1593
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,280
just it can't be used

1594
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,520
same thing with proteins they become

1595
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,440
denatured you can't cook proteins

1596
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,720
they become denatured you cook an egg

1597
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,880
protein it's denatured

1598
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,559
so if you eat a raw egg you'll get the

1599
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,280
omega-3 you'll get the protein

1600
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,040
but you'll feed the bugs all the same

1601
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,920
and maybe even get yourself salmonella

1602
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,599
or a food-borne

1603
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,720
illness if you eat rags too so you got

1604
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,119
to be careful it's a whole nother thing

1605
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,760
here's the thing i have nothing against

1606
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,319
eggs

1607
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,920
okay if anything and i got nothing to

1608
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,960
gain doing this

1609
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,960
all i get is is flack from actually

1610
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,240
telling the truth that's all i get

1611
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,640
that's how it works out there in the

1612
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,640
world

1613
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,720
you tell the truth you go against the

1614
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,920
industry you actually let the truth out

1615
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,920
to get people to heal

1616
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,440
all you do is get crap for it that's the

1617
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,280
bottom line okay

1618
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,520
but the only thing i have to gain is you

1619
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,800
healing and that that's true i have that

1620
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,319
to gain because i know that i could

1621
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,440
sleep at night knowing that you have

1622
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,040
answers

1623
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,400
while i'm in this lifetime now that you

1624
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,960
have the answers so you can work on

1625
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,119
healing

1626
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,640
that's critical to me okay but other

1627
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,040
than that there's nothing to gain with

1628
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,640
this

1629
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,960
it's not like i have anything against

1630
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,440
eggs it actually tastes really good i

1631
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,760
mean

1632
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,680
i mean eggs people love them they taste

1633
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,160
great it's emotional connection

1634
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,079
our moms made eggs or dads made eggs or

1635
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,920
grandparents made eggs there's so many

1636
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,000
people all that through the

1637
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,839
the family line you know we went to

1638
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,400
diners right did you guys all go to

1639
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:34,160
diners and have eggs in your lifetime

1640
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,079
you know maybe somebody got drunk and

1641
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,040
went to a diner after a college party or

1642
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,200
something whatever it is

1643
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,040
just just you know had eggs there's all

1644
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,559
these emotional connections

1645
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,040
people have with eggs down to the family

1646
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,520
line

1647
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,240
goes back in history i mean i mean down

1648
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,559
to

1649
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,280
the food that's made to egg salad that's

1650
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,200
made by you know a family recipe

1651
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,559
a potato salad with eggs mayonnaise

1652
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,640
whatever it's just whatever it is

1653
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,720
mayonnaise and eggs and all this stuff

1654
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,319
there's so much going on there

1655
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,920
and there's so you know with omelets and

1656
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,400
fried eggs and scrambled eggs and

1657
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,839
all the way people like them you know

1658
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,960
and i get that and i completely

1659
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,119
understand

1660
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,079
and i know that connection is deep in

1661
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,480
people

1662
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,319
but see you know what happens is the

1663
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,040
industry

1664
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,960
they don't care about your family they

1665
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,240
don't care about you and your health

1666
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,440
they want you to think your body's

1667
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,760
attacking itself they want you on eggs

1668
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,359
they want you sick and they want you

1669
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,800
playing guessing games

1670
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,400
and they want you throwing stones at

1671
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,760
each other and throwing fake science at

1672
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,200
each other you know like the vegans and

1673
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,559
the paleos do and everybody else

1674
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,200
everybody's throwing all this stuff at

1675
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,640
each other

1676
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,559
and the iep and everybody's just

1677
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,680
throwing all the stuff because everybody

1678
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,440
thinks they have the answers when they

1679
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,599
don't even know what causes

1680
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,599
anything that's the whole thing i don't

1681
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,640
even know what causes anything

1682
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:53,040
and so the industries want everybody

1683
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,359
guessing they want everybody confused

1684
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,760
and they want everybody to stay sick

1685
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,359
that's just the bottom line okay i have

1686
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,559
to be the one deliberate well that's the

1687
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,280
way it works you know

1688
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,440
i want to tell you read this new york

1689
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,079
times bestselling book deliver rescue

1690
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,200
learn about protein the whole bit

1691
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,960
protein myth

1692
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,640
critical critical to understand so you

1693
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,720
can protect yourselves so that's a good

1694
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,839
book you can actually uh get into

1695
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,200
if you're new to my books so let's move

1696
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,880
on down the line a little bit more i'm

1697
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,839
gonna sip a little bit of celery juice

1698
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,839
here

1699
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,319
okay so if you can't afford a book can't

1700
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,920
get a book go to the library

1701
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,520
get a book for free i don't care if

1702
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,839
everybody goes to the library

1703
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,359
back to hormones and eggs i don't care

1704
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,040
if the eggs organic free range you still

1705
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,720
have hormones that feed pathogens that

1706
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,760
keep you sick so your excellence rises

1707
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,800
are going to come and go it's going to

1708
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,559
keep on coming

1709
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,160
that's how it works doesn't matter if

1710
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,000
it's you know it's free range like i

1711
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,920
said the whole bit it still has hormones

1712
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,920
in it it's like a ball of hormones

1713
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,680
that's what it is naturally occurring

1714
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,359
and the hormones and eggs confuse the

1715
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,559
our endocrine endocrine glands our

1716
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,760
endocrine system so it's really

1717
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,839
important to understand

1718
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,599
and they also get stored up in her liver

1719
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,960
so the protein and eggs get stored up in

1720
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,640
our liver

1721
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,880
the the hormones from eggs get stored up

1722
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,440
in our liver and then we get sick

1723
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,280
because of

1724
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,640
pathogens sit inside the liver i talk

1725
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,640
about all the different viruses and

1726
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,520
pathogens that sit inside the liver

1727
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,480
and they feed off of a storage bin of

1728
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,400
old egg

1729
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,520
by-product that's sitting inside your

1730
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,880
liver so it's really important to

1731
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,119
understand

1732
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,640
eggs are not blood sugar balancers let's

1733
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,040
cover that a little bit everybody's like

1734
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,559
oh eggs will balance my blood sugar

1735
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,400
eggs will actually keep my blood sugar

1736
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,240
balance they keep me level first of all

1737
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,400
eggs have sugar in them

1738
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,640
so it's not just this protein food

1739
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,400
non-carb food that's not at all eggs

1740
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,720
actually have a lot of sugar in them

1741
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,880
there's a reason for that without sugar

1742
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,119
glucose a baby chicken can't form

1743
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,319
get muscles can't break out of the shell

1744
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,800
there has to be sugar

1745
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:53,280
inside of an egg or a baby chick

1746
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,960
can't develop and break out of the shell

1747
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,160
can't have the strength to break out of

1748
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,680
the shell

1749
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,920
so there has to be sugar in there

1750
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,760
i mean there is but if you take the

1751
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,599
the sugar naturally didn't have any if

1752
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,359
the egg didn't have naturally any sugar

1753
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,160
in it a baby chicken couldn't break out

1754
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,400
of the shell

1755
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,559
so that's how it works so when you have

1756
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,960
sugar and fat combined

1757
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,880
you have now you destable you're

1758
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,400
actually you disable your blood sugar

1759
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,839
that's how you create insulin resistance

1760
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,160
so just know this this is actually

1761
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:24,319
something is really important so

1762
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,520
eggs are toted as blood sugar imbalances

1763
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,960
they're good for diabetics they're good

1764
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,319
for people with diabetes and all that

1765
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,480
not true

1766
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,319
worst thing for diabetics the worst

1767
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,680
thing to keep you with diabetes you

1768
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,240
continue to stay with diet

1769
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,119
being a diabetic or a pre-diabetic or

1770
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,359
your a1c

1771
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,200
is going to constantly be unstable and

1772
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,000
you're going to have to need medications

1773
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,800
and the reason why is because this is

1774
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,040
sugar

1775
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,720
and protein this is sugar and fat

1776
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,119
combined inside of an egg

1777
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,359
it causes instant insulin resistance so

1778
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,119
it's not a blood sugar balancer

1779
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,640
because when you put fat and sugar

1780
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,880
together

1781
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,119
the sugar can't find its way into cells

1782
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,200
because fats blocking it so insulin has

1783
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,200
to be produced to try to somehow get

1784
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,559
that sugar to bypass the fat and enter

1785
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,280
into cells so you can actually have

1786
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,760
strength

1787
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,200
and that's how it works so these are bad

1788
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,720
for diabetics but yeah

1789
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,240
diabetics are told to eat them

1790
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,480
everybody's told to eat them that's the

1791
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:20,079
whole point we're all told to eat them

1792
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,760
so the fat clogs up the blood

1793
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,359
keeps the insulin from attaching to the

1794
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,440
sugar and then the

1795
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,200
sugar the glucose entering your cells

1796
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,839
that's how it works

1797
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,520
so when people are eating carbs if

1798
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,240
you're eating carbs with some type of

1799
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,559
fat

1800
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,280
the same thing occurs that's how it

1801
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,319
works so

1802
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,640
like for instance if you're eating

1803
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,200
french fries with oil

1804
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,839
french fries with oil is fat and a carb

1805
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,680
right

1806
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:46,160
see so that's insulin resistance but if

1807
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,079
you're eating potatoes without oil

1808
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,520
that's how it works that's why donuts

1809
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,559
cakes cookies

1810
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:55,520
all that stuff is bad for you it's fat

1811
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,400
and carbs it's fat and sugar that's how

1812
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,000
it works

1813
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,520
so because of that you get the insulin

1814
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,040
resistance so i'm trying to give you a

1815
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,799
little run down on that same thing with

1816
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,079
barbecue sauce so if you're actually got

1817
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,559
barbecue ribs

1818
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,079
going on the grill and you think you got

1819
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,400
a protein source right there but you

1820
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,599
slap on barbecue sauce you just put a

1821
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,520
sugar

1822
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,040
on top your barbecue ribs whatever

1823
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,720
you're on your ribs you put a sugar on

1824
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,480
top of it you just cause an insulin

1825
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:22,160
resistant issue with sugar

1826
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,960
and fat very important understand so

1827
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,319
realize this is not free from that it's

1828
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,640
got a lot of sugar in it

1829
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,680
to keep a baby chicken actually so baby

1830
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,440
chicken can grow

1831
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,280
it can gain muscle and strength and be

1832
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,280
able to break out of the shell

1833
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,359
and that's how it works so eggs are not

1834
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,480
a perfect food for diabetes that's the

1835
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:41,680
whole point

1836
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,359
so you can you can read more information

1837
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,160
about this too in my books i talk all

1838
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,079
about that

1839
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,599
liver rescue is a great one for get your

1840
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,119
liver healthy and actually you can get

1841
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,880
so many conditions behind you it's

1842
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,960
ridiculous you can actually really heal

1843
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,640
you can learn how to heal the whole bit

1844
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,720
um and you know what i'm going to be

1845
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,119
doing a keto live ketogenic live

1846
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,559
diet you know ketogenic diet live too so

1847
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,160
we're going to do that eventually i

1848
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,680
can't wait to do that cover all of that

1849
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,880
that's going to be fun

1850
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,920
um so here's the other thing people have

1851
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,280
to understand too

1852
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,920
okay eggs are high in fat so remember

1853
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,440
that too

1854
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,799
so it's a whole nother thing so they're

1855
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,480
high in fat so when you put the sugar

1856
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,680
combination of fat and sugar that's when

1857
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,440
you get the problems

1858
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,359
that's the bottom line and then the

1859
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,920
person feels stabilized but

1860
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,359
really they become destabilized more and

1861
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,680
more and more and more

1862
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,200
and they end up getting in trouble so

1863
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,640
and the reason why they feel stabilized

1864
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,160
for the moment by eating eggs some

1865
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,280
people feel stabilized because it's got

1866
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,960
a lot of calories

1867
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,640
it's got a it's got it's packed with

1868
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,920
calories it's the bottom line so

1869
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,200
if you're going to eat a caloric foods

1870
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,799
you're going to feel stable for a little

1871
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,160
while so anytime but

1872
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,359
you're going to set yourself up for

1873
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,799
pre-diabetes you're going to set

1874
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:46,799
yourself down the road for liver

1875
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,799
problems because eggs clog up the liver

1876
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,319
cause pre-diabetes and so forth and

1877
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,000
that's one of the things that gets us in

1878
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,599
trouble down the road

1879
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,440
um so that's something i wanted to cover

1880
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,359
there many people eat their eggs fried

1881
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,880
or in omelets butter or oil the whole

1882
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,480
bit now here's something i got to talk

1883
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,599
about this is fun just let me get a sip

1884
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,599
of celery juice right here

1885
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,440
so coconut oil let's talk about coconut

1886
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,880
oil and eggs

1887
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,880
just because you're frying your eggs and

1888
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,559
coconut oil

1889
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,079
that's not the answer that's not the

1890
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,760
answer because you're still

1891
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,119
feeding any kind of pathogen any kind of

1892
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,319
virus any kind of bacteria that's in

1893
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,119
your body that's causing any of your

1894
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,559
symptoms

1895
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,079
you're still feeding any illness you're

1896
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,200
still feeding any disease so what

1897
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,599
happens is if you take

1898
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,680
take eggs and you fry in coconut oil or

1899
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,359
you cook it in coconut oil

1900
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,880
it's a way a term i call bullshitting

1901
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,520
yourself that's what it does you know

1902
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,440
it's like

1903
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,119
you think it's healthier you think we're

1904
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,720
told it's healthier all you're doing is

1905
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,960
adding more fat to your meal

1906
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,400
so you're having like a double fat meal

1907
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,920
eggs which have fat in it then you're

1908
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,160
adding coconut oil

1909
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,520
into it and you're using that sure it's

1910
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,200
better than using butter

1911
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,040
definitely it's without a doubt it's

1912
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,440
better using butter or bacon grease

1913
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,040
without a doubt it is so i like that's

1914
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,640
what i like about the coconut oil with

1915
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,839
eggs and stuff but at the same time

1916
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,040
you're not getting away with something

1917
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,720
the most important part

1918
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,160
which is this is responsible for all

1919
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,359
those diagnoses

1920
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,880
this is one of the things that are

1921
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:09,440
responsible for feeding the viruses

1922
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,880
and the bugs that are responsible for

1923
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,160
autoimmune conditions and all different

1924
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,599
conditions that are out there and

1925
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,200
diseases and so forth

1926
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:18,240
all the pathogens of viruses and

1927
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,079
bacteria that feed off of foods it likes

1928
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,680
this is one of those foods that's what

1929
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,000
i'm saying this was a food that

1930
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,680
raised them in the labs and they're in

1931
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,040
our system and they're in our bodies and

1932
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,119
then that's what everybody's

1933
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,480
that's what everybody's fighting they're

1934
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,559
fighting their

1935
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,319
pathogens and they're fighting also the

1936
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,359
information out there the misinformation

1937
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,559
out there at the same time they're

1938
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,400
finding two things

1939
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,599
and i always say if you know the truth

1940
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,240
you don't have to fight one thing

1941
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,280
anymore

1942
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,520
all the misinformation and all

1943
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,520
of the the the information that's out

1944
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,720
there that isn't right that doesn't work

1945
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,319
that isn't good

1946
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,160
and you don't have to fight that battle

1947
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,839
anymore so once you have the real

1948
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,440
information of what causes illness and

1949
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,559
you know how to support yourself and you

1950
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,960
know how to

1951
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,240
empower yourself and heal that's one

1952
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,640
battle that's over

1953
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,640
the next battle is clean up your system

1954
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,240
clean up the toxins clean up the bugs

1955
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,240
and the whole bit it's so important to

1956
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,000
that so

1957
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,359
you gotta re-watch this live anybody who

1958
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,480
came on now you have to go back to the

1959
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,839
beginning of this live and make sure you

1960
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,520
watch it right from the beginning to all

1961
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:18,559
of it it's so important

1962
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,920
no one is immune from getting sick

1963
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,160
and no one's immune from bullshitting

1964
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,920
themselves when it comes down to eggs

1965
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,079
in order to support somebody's belief

1966
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,319
system and they love eggs

1967
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,319
they will themselves in every

1968
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:32,480
possible shape and manner

1969
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:33,680
because if you love the emotional

1970
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,520
connection you have with

1971
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,359
eggs and you're really connected and you

1972
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,960
love the taste and you hear one good

1973
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,799
thing about eggs out there

1974
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,079
without fail you're going to pass it on

1975
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,599
to the next generation you're going to

1976
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,960
pass it on to the next generation and

1977
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,599
pass it on to the next generation and

1978
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,440
you're

1979
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,680
and it's going to happen over and over

1980
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,359
and over again you'll carry the torch

1981
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,040
into the next generation is what you'll

1982
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,960
do because

1983
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,400
no one wants to drop a belief system

1984
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,720
that tastes good

1985
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,400
and everybody's eating it's their

1986
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,920
favorite comfort food or one of their

1987
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,520
favorite comfort foods i've had people

1988
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,720
tell me no eggs not my favorite comfort

1989
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,079
food but they can't get rid of them and

1990
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,240
they can't stop eating them

1991
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,440
because it is i've had so many people

1992
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,640
say well i don't really eat that many

1993
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,240
eggs

1994
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,760
maybe you're one of them and you're like

1995
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,119

but then get rid of them get rid of them

2000
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,559
and keep them out all together

keep them out all together and get rid

2002
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,720
of them and you'll know where you stand

2003

the internet now i got to look up

2015
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,440
studies and research

i got to look up things and and find out

2017
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,920
how eggs are good for me and find out

2018
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,200
how eggs are

2019
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,079
you know realize that egg studies are

2020
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,799
paid for

2021
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,480
by their constituents they're paid for

2022
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:59,280
that's how it works

2023
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,720
that's how it's done nobody's paying me

2024
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,400
to do this

2025
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,839
nobody's paying me to do this to put it

2026
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,119
simple

2027
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:08,480
to put it simple okay because it's the

2028
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,079
first thing that people are going to do

2029
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,200
after seeing this this youtube

2030
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,480
is they're going to be running looking

2031
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,599
for research about eggs they're going to

2032
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,839
say wait a minute where

2033
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,520
how does eggs work how are they bad and

2034
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,359
they're going to trust studies

2035
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,720
that are paid for so you keep eating

2036
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:24,400
eggs but that's how the world works

2037
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,079
haven't you figured that out yet you

2038
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,880
know it's pretty much just how the world

2039
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,680
works with stuff

2040
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,200
that's how crazy the world is because

2041
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,119
it's all about keeping you sick

2042
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,480
keeping the industry fat the fat cats

2043
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,079
happy out there

2044
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,160
keeping them nice and you know all the

2045
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,520
money paid for all the investors all the

2046
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,880
backups all that stuff

2047
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,160
all that constituents happy and

2048
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,280
everything they're going to make sure

2049
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,079
those studies

2050
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,280
are supporting eggs and that's the

2051
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,079
bottom line it's going to get pushed

2052
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,440
into the

2053
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,799
alternative movement it's going to get

2054
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,359
pushed in every movement it's going to

2055
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:55,520
be in every diet system there is

2056
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:57,119
except for the vegan system but yet the

2057
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,960
vegans flip flop anyway and they leave

2058
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,720
veganism and veganism the minute they

2059
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,920
get a sniffle because their people are

2060
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,079
telling them they need protein or

2061
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,920
something so they run off and they're

2062
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,359
now they're eating eggs again which is

2063
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,960
you know which is sad because i like

2064
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,480
anybody who's just staying off of eggs

2065
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,000
no matter what diet belief system

2066
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,079
they're attached to or whatever they're

2067
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,119
attached to

2068
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:19,039
the industry big pharma actually pushed

2069
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:22,640
eggs upon us

2070
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:25,440
they use them in the labs to get us sick

2071
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:27,280
and they push it upon us to eat them

2072
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,599
that's how it's done

2073
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:33,839
and they know this they know this okay

2074
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,680
i want you to know this and remember if

2075
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:37,520
you like i said if you're a big science

2076
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,640
research study fan

2077
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,480
just know you know if they if science of

2078
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,640
research had all the answers

2079
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:48,720
why is everybody so darn sick

2080
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,160
so many symptoms and conditions

2081
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:54,559
conditions that are just

2082
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,680
rising out of the blue over 250 million

2083
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,200
americans alone

2084
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,359
have symptoms and conditions they can't

2085
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,240
get rid of so is that what it's supposed

2086
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,079
to be you guys

2087
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,760

2088
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,160
everybody supposed to be sick except for

2089
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,400
a few 20 year olds before they get sick

2090
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,599
i mean is that how it's supposed to be

2091
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,839
millions

2092
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,799
and the millions getting sicker that are

2093
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,720
coming

2094
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:16,000
soon the millions that are going to get

2095
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,160
sicker why are you

2096
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,200
or someone you know why are you or

2097
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,119
someone you know

2098
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,079
still suffering with x-men psoriasis if

2099
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:27,280
research and science had all the answers

2100
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:29,039
why i mean do they go to enough doctors

2101
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,640
don't don't they have all the answers oh

2102
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,799
i forgot their body's attacking itself

2103
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,599
that's right the 1950s theory

2104
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:36,799
that was shoved in everybody's face so

2105
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,400
realize

2106
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,839
how research in science works with

2107
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,640
chronic illness and how it's a

2108
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:45,119
it's a house of cards and it just falls

2109
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,880
and breaks and falls all falls down

2110
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,319
you have to be able to see that or you

2111
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,280
can't heal in the end

2112
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,480

2113
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,760

correct is critical

2139
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:35,280
eggs are not the culprit for disease i'm

2140
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:37,680
not saying eggs are responsible

2141
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,799
i'm not saying don't make listen don't

2142
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,599
mistake this

2143
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:43,359
i'm not attacking eggs and saying

2144
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,200
they're actually the culprit of disease

2145
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,880
it takes a host of toxic heavy metals

2146
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,480
mercury aluminum copper it takes

2147
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,520
pathogens takes viruses such as

2148
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,200
epstein-barr

2149
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,000
it takes all of that and that's that's

2150
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,119
what it's involved

2151
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,640
with it just so happens that the eggs

2152
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:02,960
feed pathogens the egg actually feeds

2153
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,240
the viruses the viruses eat the eggs is

2154
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,240
what happens

2155
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,200
i know it's pretty silly right but it's

2156
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,520
the truth and it is the bottom line

2157
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,799
eggs aren't the cause of disease but

2158
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,480
they feed it

2159
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:16,000
so eggs aren't the cause of disease but

2160
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,920
they feed it so important to understand

2161
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,160
you guys that's like critical they feed

2162
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,480
basically that's how it works because

2163
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,079
the viruses that cause disease were fed

2164
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,839
eggs

2165
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:30,880
look here's the thing

2166
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:31,839
okay i want you guys to have the answer

2167
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,119
answers i want you to have the

2168
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,880
information i want you to know you can

2169
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,359
heal avoid eggs at all

2170
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,119
costs is what i'm trying to say if

2171
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,559
you're not sick now and you feel good

2172
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,039
and you want to eat some eggs

2173
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,760
okay fine i mean eat some eggs but we're

2174
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:47,200
always one

2175
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,520
egg away from getting ourselves sicker

2176
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,400
so important to know look it sounds

2177
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,480
ridiculous

2178
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,000
probably to someone who's not feeling

2179
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,280
too many symptoms or any symptoms at all

2180
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,400
and they're like that egg didn't hurt me

2181
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,200
when i hated

2182
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,720
but what about the woman with pcos who's

2183
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,559
really suffering with some kind of

2184
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,720
reproductive system condition or the

2185
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,559
worst endometriosis she's getting she's

2186
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,720
getting surgery

2187
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:10,720
and there she's told to eat an egg every

2188
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:14,160
day and it's worsening the condition

2189
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,720
rapidly or even a diabetic that's being

2190
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,160
told

2191
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,520
you might care about the diabetic in

2192
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,280
your family and they're told to eat eggs

2193
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,799
every day

2194
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,400
basically the bottom line is have

2195
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,160
compassion for the people

2196
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,440
people who actually really are sick

2197
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,119
struggling and going through hell and

2198
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,400
back or bend through hell and back

2199
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,960
and i want you guys to have that

2200
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,480
compassion for them too because

2201
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,000
but by having that compassion you'll

2202
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,359
actually be more open to understanding

2203
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,880
this information

2204
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,799
and and about the eggs and what i'm

2205
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,559
talking about in the whole bit

2206
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:42,000
what about the people who are 102 years

2207
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,280
old what are the people who are 90 years

2208
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,640
old and ate eggs their whole life they

2209
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,319
didn't have the pathogens we're up

2210
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,680
against now we're up against mutations

2211
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:49,280
that are different we're up against over

2212
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,119
60 varieties of epstein-barr not one

2213
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,799
variety of epstein-barr we're up against

2214
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,319
toxic heavy metals like never before in

2215
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,920
history we're up against mercury like

2216
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,280
never before in history so you need to

2217
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,640
know that we're up against all these

2218
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,920
different toxins and all these different

2219
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,000
poisons and we're up against things

2220
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,240
we've never been up against

2221
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,039
and and people that the the last

2222
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,200
dinosaurs that are 102 102 years old

2223
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,359
that are 99 years old and 98 years old

2224
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,520
god bless them the last dinosaurs

2225
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:14,960
have less of that in their system they

2226
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,960
got less of that and they were exposed

2227
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,480
to less pathogens but that changed

2228
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,640
that all changed why do you think we

2229
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,039
have teenagers that are laying in bed

2230
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,760
suffering with like full body pain and

2231
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,520
fatigue

2232
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,200
why do you think there's there's there's

2233
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,640
children that are sick to the degree

2234
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,039
they are and getting diagnosed with

2235
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,559
autoimmune every every minute why do you

2236
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,079
think there's people in their early 20s

2237
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,599
that can't go to college anymore or

2238
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,720
can't pursue their career after college

2239
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,240
or can't do anything

2240
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,240
why do you think there's people like

2241
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,359
literally suffering why do you think

2242
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,039
everybody's getting diagnosed with a

2243
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:46,240
thyroid condition

2244
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:48,079
that never happened back then that never

2245
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,359
happened with the old days of what

2246
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:52,640
happened

2247
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:54,400
so and look even if you raise your own

2248
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,920
chickens have your own chickens

2249
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,400
have the best chickens in the world that

2250
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,000
egg will still feed bugs

2251
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,599
bottom line you can still keep your

2252
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,359
chickens if it's therapy you can still

2253
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,599
keep your chickens and feed them and

2254
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:06,799
have them lay eggs and and maybe there's

2255
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,240
somebody that doesn't care about this

2256
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:09,599
information you can give the eggs to

2257
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,799
because they want to eat the eggs no

2258
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,559
matter what and they don't care about

2259
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,359
this information she could find somebody

2260
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,880
but

2261
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,799
the point is even if you raise your own

2262
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,880
chickens just the eggs will feed

2263
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:20,319
if you're con look i've known people

2264
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,960
over the years raising their own

2265
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,920
chickens

2266
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,400
the most amazing eggs dark dark colored

2267
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,759
yolks

2268
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,640
like incredible dark orange yellow yolks

2269
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,839
like incredible and but they're

2270
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,839
suffering with like

2271
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,120
fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis

2272
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,719
and they got all the joint pain and

2273
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,480
their back creaks and hurts and they

2274
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,480
they go out to the chicken to the

2275
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,080
chicken shack and they're

2276
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,520
and they're you know and they're they're

2277
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,880
out there and they're they're collecting

2278
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,080
their eggs but they're

2279
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,080
they got all kinds of problems and they

2280
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,960
got glaucoma developing and they got all

2281
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,319
kinds of different

2282
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,920
symptoms and they're they're in their

2283
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,000
50s but they're like they're they're

2284
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,120
feeling like they're 85-90 they feel

2285
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,719
like they're a hundred

2286
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:02,000
no don't eat the eggs don't eat the eggs

2287
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,880
and what about you know look be mad at

2288
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,319
the industry

2289
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:09,759
that raised the bugs and pathogens

2290
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:12,480
with your food that was a good food

2291
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,400
that was a great food that's the irony

2292
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,120
see i think eggs

2293
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,319
was an amazing food you know back in the

2294
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,799
old days

2295
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:23,199
it wasn't the most nutrient-rich food

2296
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:24,719
but it was a survival food that's why i

2297
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:26,000
think it was an amazing food because

2298
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,839
back in the old days

2299
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,440
it was an incredible survival food when

2300
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:30,719
nothing else was around in the moment if

2301
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,719
you can get an egg

2302
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,400
it was a really good high caloric

2303
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,000
survival food that's why

2304
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,440
that's i mean that's why i even like

2305
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,440
eggs in that sense it's

2306
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,560
it has a history of that but it's

2307
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,319
changed

2308
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,000
you know be mad at the industry for

2309
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,600
taking those eggs and ruining them be

2310
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,199
mad at the industry don't be mad at me

2311
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,000
for dropping the news on you'd be mad at

2312
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:49,759
the industry for what

2313
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,279
they've done to eggs that's really

2314
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,839
important to know

2315
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,600
you know so what about the people who

2316
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:57,199
can say i'm taking away everything they

2317
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,640
can eat so what about those people

2318
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,480
that's a good question because

2319
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,280
you know that's a question i i hear all

2320
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,560
the time is oh you know medical medium

2321
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,760
you're you want everybody on celery

2322

juice and you're taking away everything

2323
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,560
they eat

2324
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,239
that's not true medical medium

2325
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,600
information in all the books gives you

2326
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,199
the most food to eat than any of the

2327
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,640
diet systems out there what about

2328
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,719
what about when you go and get your food

2329
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,440
allergy food sensitivity testing and

2330
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,320

2333
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:25,679
what about that i mean what about all

2334
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,600
the diet belief systems out there that

2335
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:29,199
all these years that strip people of all

2336
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,239
eliminate all the foods elimination

2337
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,520
plans

2338
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,960
and they get rid of your fruit what

2339
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,480
about all the diet systems what about

2340
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,840
all the diet belief systems that get rid

2341
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,040
of your fruit including the vegan

2342
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,120
systems now out there they get rid of

2343
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:42,640
your fruits and your nightshades

2344
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:44,080
i'm the only guy out there the only the

2345
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,560
only books and information

2346
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,400
and give you more things to eat than any

2347
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,239
of the other diet belief systems

2348
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,920
so if anybody thinks i'm the food police

2349
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:53,679
quite the opposite it's just that the

2350
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,280
difference is i know what foods to avoid

2351
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,320
because i know what causes illness

2352
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,760
i want you to know that okay so the

2353
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,679
medical medium information the book

2354
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,600
series the medical books

2355
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,880
it's all about knowing what to avoid so

2356
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,600
you don't feed the bugs and the

2357
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,400
pathogens

2358
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,080
that's what it's all about and i only

2359
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,199
tell you that what foods feed those

2360
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,679
pathogens

2361
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:15,199
and to not be fooled okay and don't be

2362
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,719
fooled when you see young people because

2363
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,800
it's confusing i get it

2364
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,239
when you see them you know young people

2365
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,560
they're seemed indestructible and

2366
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,080
they're

2367
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,239
and they're they're in the gym and

2368
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,679
they're they're removing gluten and

2369
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,880
removing some bad stuff out of their

2370
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,400
diets and they're choosing

2371
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,920
choosing to do egg whites and they're

2372
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,840
cooking their eggs in coconut oil

2373
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,239
and they're exercising they seem symptom

2374
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,560
free it's a short

2375
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,000
short duration of time it's a short

2376
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,239
duration of time

2377
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,480
because they may seem indestructible but

2378
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:44,800
i've been in this for 35 years

2379
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,320
and i and i talk to doctors all the time

2380
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,880
and it's like no one's

2381
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,440
no one's getting away with it bottom

2382
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,520
line

2383
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,280
that's what i'm trying to say and when

2384
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,239
and when it does hurt you later i

2385
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,159
guarantee you

2386
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:58,239
one something something that when you're

2387
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,040
young and you're exercising and you're

2388
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,560
doing your thing

2389
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,159
and you believe if you believe in what

2390
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,760
you're doing and you're you're eating

2391
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,120
pretty good and all of that and you

2392
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,840
think you're indestructible and when

2393
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,360
something happens

2394
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,360
you start getting symptoms like you will

2395
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,800
because everybody does

2396
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,800
i'm gonna tell you right now you're

2397
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,040
never gonna blame the egg

2398
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,719
you're never gonna blame the egg you

2399
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:22,560
won't be blaming that

2400
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:25,840
but that you'll never blame the egg

2401
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,840
bottom line so it's important to know

2402
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,280
you know you'll blame a piece of fruit

2403
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,400
you'll blame something else but you

2404
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,400
won't blame the egg

2405
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,600
so look i have nothing to gain like i

2406
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,760
said about any of this

2407
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,280
it's just about you healing so if i call

2408
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,040
that some of the gain then

2409
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:42,080
yeah i call that something to gain you

2410
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:45,040
healing it's called you healing

2411
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,600
being empowered and not disempowered so

2412
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,120
a lot of

2413
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,880
there's a lot of women disempowerment

2414
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,280
going on with the medical industry still

2415
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,760
to

2416
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,360
to this day and everybody bought into it

2417
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,280
women being told it's their genes

2418
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,880
it's complete total disempowerment

2419
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,480
because that you walk around as a woman

2420
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,159
thinking your jeans are faulty

2421
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,080
and then they're garbage that's what

2422
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,280
they're teaching women right now

2423
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,800
they're teaching women that their body's

2424
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,080
attacking itself and it's their fault

2425
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,280
they're also teaching women that it's

2426
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,800
all in their head and they're creating

2427
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,679
it with their thoughts

2428
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,320
so that's another thing too okay you buy

2429
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,719
into that

2430
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,920
you just buy into their tricks and games

2431
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:19,120
of disempowerment

2432
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:22,800
of body shaming so remember that too

2433
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:25,199
eggs are a catapult basically

2434
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,719
they're a catapult of getting people

2435
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:29,040
sick

2436
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:30,400
here's how it works women are world

2437
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,960
changers

2438
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,760
they change the world the industries

2439
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,280
know this

2440
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,120
though in these industries have been

2441
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,159
trying to keep women down

2442
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:43,040
for decades and decades and decades

2443
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:44,080
because women change the world for the

2444
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,640
positive

2445
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,600
okay they make things happen that's what

2446
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,560
they do

2447
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,560
okay we know that that's the bottom line

2448
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,159
so keeping women disempowered

2449
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,679
training them that their body's faulty

2450
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:57,360
their genes are faulty and their immune

2451
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,640
systems are attacking itself training

2452
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,320
them to eat eggs

2453
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,239
the very foods that feed viruses and

2454
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,440
pathogens training them that it's all in

2455
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,360
their head and they're creating it with

2456
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,560
some kind of like woo-woo

2457
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:10,080
training them that they're crazy or lazy

2458
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,520
or bored and that's why they're fatigued

2459
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,800
all these years so whatever it is that

2460
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,320
they're training them to do

2461
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,159
it's to keep them down keep them

2462
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,080
disempowered because they're world

2463
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:22,000
changers and that's the bottom line

2464
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:24,560
eggs feed every tumor cyst every fibroid

2465
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,080
every single cancer every single any

2466
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,880
kind of reproductive system

2467
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:31,199
eggs feed all of the very things women

2468
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,600
are afraid of and worried about

2469
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,640
that's what eggs feed okay so that just

2470
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,800
goes to show you right there

2471
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,400
endometriosis pcos eggs

2472
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,719
feed these it's so important to know

2473
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:43,920
this okay

2474
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:45,600
so they're told to eat eggs every

2475
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,960
morning they're told to eat eggs every

2476
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,000
morning it's almost like a joke played

2477
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,840
on everybody

2478
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
so women are told to eat eggs every day

2479
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,480
every morning to keep them sick

2480
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,920
and disempowered and then when they get

2481
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,199
the first hashimoto's thyroiditis

2482
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,120
diagnosis they're told that their body

2483
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,880
is destroying their own thyroid

2484
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,320
it really breaks the soul down in a

2485
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,840
woman and it breaks the soul down in

2486
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,760
people and it breaks them down

2487
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,199
it kicks them down a notch and it

2488
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,960
weakens them

2489
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,560
you can become empowered you can learn

2490
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,159
you can learn about the information you

2491
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,159
can learn about how to protect yourself

2492
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:16,480

around the world in healing
