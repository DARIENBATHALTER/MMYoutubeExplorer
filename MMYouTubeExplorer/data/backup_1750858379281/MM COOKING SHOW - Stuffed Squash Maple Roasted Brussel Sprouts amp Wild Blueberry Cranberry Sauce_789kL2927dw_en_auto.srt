134
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,960
marketing guys do you know what that

135
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,199
means

136
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,000
no pr marketing it means i didn't take a

137
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,680
million dollars

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,720
like they all do

139
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,320
and put it into pr marketing

140
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,320
so that their book can get somewhere

141
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,280
the books no money behind them

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,199
no money behind the books being

143
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,479
propelled out there right i'm gonna put

144
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,759
this in the pan

145
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,080
the books

146
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,280
healed people

147
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280

148
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,440
people everybody deserves to heal even

149
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,520
people

150
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,720
who heal from medical medium and then

151
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,720
give me a middle finger on the way out

152
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,639
because they want to sell an alkaline

153
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,800
ionizer water machine and the medical

154
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,560
medium community says medical medium

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
doesn't like those because the metal

156
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,440
plates in there rot and bubble up and

157
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,000
everybody gets poisoned and then because

158
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,160
they can't sell their alkaline

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,160
ionizer water machine to anybody they

160
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,080
get mad and they say well even though i

161
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,320
healed 100

162
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,960

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,600
from here on up from here on up

191
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,280
okay

192
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,840
right there

193
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,840
there's an alkaloid on that carrot

194
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,240
nobody knows this they don't know that

195
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,560
there's an alkaloid here inside that

196
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,720
carrot and that alkaloid

197
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,240
okay that alkaloid makes it hard to

198
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,240
digest

199
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,039
it's got enzyme inhibitors in that

200
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,960
alcohol alkaloid right there so i chop

201
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,720
the top of the carrot off because that's

202
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,560
an enzyme enzyme inhibitors are in that

203
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,080
part of the carrot give somebody a

204
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
bellyache there's people that can't eat

205
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,440
carrots and they don't know why well the

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,440
reason why they can't eat carrots

207
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
is because

208
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,599
that affected them a lot more than

209
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,759
somebody else but i love carrots so what

210
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:22,080
i like to do anyways i cut that top off

211
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
i mean i eat them with the tops

212
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
but i know there's people that are

213
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,840
sensitive

214
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,599
i'm not i don't have a sensitive

215
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,360
digestion

216
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,599
i mean i could you know it's not going

217
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,000
to affect me but it will

218
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,599
it will affect somebody else for sure

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,280
who's struggling with digestive problems

220
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,840
so what i say with carrots that's what

221
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,759
you want to do

222
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,280

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
like that tip because that's a really

224
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,400
important tip

225
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,160
that's what that is

226
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,240
you cut the top off you don't have to

227
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,479
cut that far i probably cut a little too

228
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,240

talk about like why it's important to

273
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,839
wash some techniques about washing

274
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
a little bit about that what happens is

275
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,279
that

276
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,480
produce

277
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,120
could be

278
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:40,000
in a box and those boxes on a pallet in

279
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,640
the truck could be under other boxes it

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
happens all the time they could be under

281
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,200
chicken

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,200
fresh

283
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,920
chicken boxes

284
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,920
and chicken juices can be dripping on

285
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,360
produce this is why washing produce is

286
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,120
so important

287
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,920
it's different when you're picking it

288
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,320
yourself maybe in the farm or something

289
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,000
if you do you know like pick your own or

290
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,920
you got your garden or anything like

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,399
that that's different right but you got

292
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,440
to be careful with

293
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,519
with

294
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,880
you know you can have some in la e coli

295
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,399
the whole bit

296
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,720
right

297
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,680
and the thing is with chicken

298
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
is like

299
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,720
chicken can kill you

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,720
it can kill you

301
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,160
eggs can kill you

302
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,800
right eggs can kill you mayonnaise do

303
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,320
you ever think about that mayonnaise

304
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,279
don't leave the mayonnaise out in the

305
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,000
sun

306
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,959
why because you'll die

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
uh

308
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,920
at the cookout make sure the mayonnaise

309
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,839
is cold oh my god make sure the

310
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,320
mayonnaise is cold if the mayonnaise

311
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,079
doesn't stay cold everybody's gonna be

312
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
on the toilet and barfing and holding

313
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,440
the toilet for dear life and throwing up

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
and diarrhea

315
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,320
just don't let the mayonnaise get cold

316
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,360
because why because egg

317
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,120
egg

318
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,200
right didn't i i taught you guys about

319
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,600
the whole thing about eggs right eggs

320
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,360
are the food that raised all the

321
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
pathogens

322
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,320
in in the classified medical research

323
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,760
and science labs right it's all the

324
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
whole thing i told you guys about that

325
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,279
so the whole point is

326
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,360
is that eggs feed bacteria really fast

327
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,440
so when you bring your mayonnaise in the

328
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,760
sun

329
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,959
you bring your mayonnaise outside

330
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,720
and a fly lands on your mayonnaise

331
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,959
it's possible the fly can bring some

332
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,200
bacteria from somebody's garbage can

333
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,560
down the road right

334
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,399
when you're at a cookout or you're out

335
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,240
in the backyard and you've got that mayo

336
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,360
that fly can bring some bacteria from

337
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,040
somebody's garbage can down the street

338
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,120
and that bacteria

339
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,360
you know what if somebody threw out some

340
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,880
bad meat at their house and they threw

341
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
it in the can it was in the garbage bag

342
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,920
and it was kind of sitting there open

343
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
and the flies got into the garbage bag

344
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,560
and they just started you know landing

345
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,720
on that meat and then what happened was

346
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,880
that meat had all this e coli and stuff

347
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,959
and everything else or some raw chicken

348
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
bags were thrown in there and the fly

349
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,920
then landed in

350
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,320
somebody's cookout and then landed in

351
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,120
the mayo dish the bacteria that the fly

352
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,399
brought can proliferate in hours

353
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,160
in hours

354
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,680
and that's why

355
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,760
what happens is you you know

356
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,480
it's crazy and the same thing with with

357
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,120
chicken like if you eat chicken juices

358
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,200
they can kill you undercooked chicken

359
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,040
right can kill you right

360
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,120
all that information

361
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,959
citric acid i saw something about citric

362
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,320
acid over there yeah citric acid not

363
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,120
good not good

364
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,320
when it's in processed food and

365
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
everything else and all these other

366
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,839
things are you guys i just put some

367
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,839
carrots in the pan so i got that on on

368
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,519
here too so i'm gonna keep on going i'm

369
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,519
gonna cut some mushrooms how about that

370
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,040
let's do that

371
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
so i'm going to cut up some mushrooms

372
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,959
right here if you guys are okay with

373
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,959
that

374
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,920
i think the bottom line is you got to

375
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,360
wash your produce

376
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,279
you got to wash them

377
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,680
these are mushrooms right here you have

378
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,120
to wash mushrooms with hot water

379
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,360
remember that

380
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,680
with hot water because you might you

381
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,120
might eat a mushroom piece

382
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,600
on its own

383
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,360
that hasn't been in the pan so you got

384
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,519
to make sure you wash because there's

385
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,240
any bacteria on top of those mushrooms

386
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,440
the manure that they grow mushrooms in

387
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,880
manure

388
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,880
has all this bacteria

389
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,399
so you have to make sure that you

390
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,560
wash them with hot water to really

391
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,639
bind on to that bacteria and pull that

392
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,639
bacteria off and like i said there's all

393
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
this fresh produce it's all moved

394
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,320

395
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,000
about that and i remember i've seen that

396
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440

so i'm pulsing you don't want to make a

495
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,600
smoothie you don't want to make a

496
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,200
cauliflower smoothie keep that in mind

497
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,919
okay you don't want to make a

498
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,520
cauliflower smoothie right so you want

499
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,000
to dump this in here

500
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
there you go

501
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,880
all right we're going to knock some more

502
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,799
pieces in there we don't want to make a

503
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,320
cauliflower smoothie that's the last

504
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,080
thing we want keep that in mind

505
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,240
yeah

506
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,480
sarah says but if you are going to mince

507
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,600
it what is the problem cutting the other

508
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,039
way

509
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,520
well what happens is is that

510
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,960
most people are not going to make it

511
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,320
their cauliflower rice they're just

512
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,200
going to cut their cauliflower on the

513
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,600
board and throw it nicely in a salad

514
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,000
so that's a tip for every reason and

515
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
when you cut it the other way and you

516
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,240
want to put it in a salad it just starts

517
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,679
to break apart and crumble and then it's

518
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,960
not doesn't have that pretty look or

519
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,799
maybe maybe you want to make a crude

520
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,440
it's hay and you want them perfect for

521
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,200
your crude hay for dipping right and

522
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,640
then what you did was you ended up

523
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,320
cutting it like this and it just started

524
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,480
to fall apart when it was cutting these

525
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,559
little pieces were popping off and then

526
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,080
it just it ends up kind of falling apart

527
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,160
like it was when i was first cutting all

528
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,240
those big pieces so there's a lot of

529
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,559
reasons i was just covering that tip for

530
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
a second because it covers everything

531
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,640
it's a great way to really keep it

532
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,080
intact and you know what you get all

533
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,520
these little pieces on the board if you

534
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,640
cut it that way you got a board full of

535
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,799
this stuff

536
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,840

going to go too far and you're going to

555
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,080
go too long and then you're going to

556
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,919
have

557
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,760

don't want to have that

561
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,679
look at that isn't that great

562
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,679
all right

563
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,200
so i think what i'm going to do is cut

564
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,880
an onion we're going to get an onion in

565
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,840
here too

566
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
so that's the plan

567
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,440
i'm going to move this over

568
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,679
you can you can save that too you can

569
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,840
use that you can turn that into rice too

570
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,679
that core cauliflower core you can

571
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,720
totally turn into rice that's perfectly

572
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,919
fine

573
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,280
nothing wrong with that i'm gonna go

574
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,919
with an onion i'm gonna go with a white

575
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,000
onion right here

576
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,000
remember how i taught you guys that

577
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,039
that's the sweet part the top of the

578
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,480
onion

579
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,840
that's the roots you see the roots right

580
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,440
there i don't know if you see those

581
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,600
roots okay

582
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,600
so

583
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,480
a lot of cauliflower hanging around here

584
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,400
i don't know if you see those roots

585
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,400
that's the bitter part of the onion if

586
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,159
you're making a salad someone's going to

587
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
get the bitter part of the onion and

588
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,240
when somebody gets a bitter part of the

589
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,400
onion

590
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,080
then your salad was

591
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
you know could it could throw somebody

592
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,000
off

593
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,960
and they'll be like yeah it was all

594
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,799
right that's the right salad

595
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,360
so that's the bitter part of the onion

596
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,679
right there so what i do is i usually

597
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,240
save that for other things like a soup

598
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,400
or something right so sometimes i just

599
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,919
leave that part out so i'm gonna peel

600
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,039
this back

601
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,840
a little bit

602
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,840
okay there you go

603
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,600
all right

604
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,600
i'm gonna peel that part back right

605
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,679
and then

606
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,679
i'm gonna cut this

607
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,760
so that's the sweet part top of the

608
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,200
onion where the greens were that's the

609
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,200
sweet part right there okay

610
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,120
i'm cutting tiny pieces i don't want big

611
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,240
hunks but there's a couple of bigger

612
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,159
hunks but they're not so big

613
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,480
that's the bottom right there that's the

614
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,159
part that's a little bit bitter and you

615
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,640
can cut that bitter part off like that

616
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,640
there you go

617
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,080
believe it or not when someone gets that

618
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
it's not a pleasing thing they don't

619
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,400
know sure you're smothering it with

620
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,240
ranch dressing you may not notice

621
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,640
but there's a lot of people that pick

622
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,000
subtle flavors up everywhere and or you

623
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,600
know flavors that are a little bit more

624
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,120
bitter or intense and they get thrown

625
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,120
off by by everything

626
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,919
just moving stuff over here giving

627
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,280
myself a little bit of room

628
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,280
we're going to chop up these onions

629
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,880

630
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,039

631
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,400
i'm making the stuffing we're also going

632
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,679

637
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,919

so i'm chopping up the onions there's

639
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,960
different ways of chopping these onions

640
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,880
you know

641
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,640
i'm trying not to blow your ears out too

642
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,400
with any noise but there's different

643
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,000
ways of chopping them you can do you

so i'm making small pieces now with

646
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
onions remember once they cook down

647
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,360
they kind of get a little bit

648
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,039
translucent

649
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,480
they start to

650
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,799
break down better

651
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,799
there we go

652
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,799

679
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,720
recipes

680
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,640
dr von md good to see you

681
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,320
so this is the medical medium cooking

682
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,559
show we just moved it out of amazon

683
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,240
amazon had a tech problem now we're here

684
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,159
and what we're doing is we're going to

685
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,760
go over some tips on some squash i'm

686
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,520
going to let this cook down a little bit

687
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,159
is what i'm going to do

688
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,679
i'm going to get the lid

689
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,919
like that

690
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,880
keep that lid on let that cook up i'm

691
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,640
going to clean off the board a touch

692
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,120
because what happens is when you cut

693
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,039
this squash you want to make sure you

694
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,200
don't have anything on the board that's

695
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,679
really important to know you don't want

696
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,559
the squash slipping on you when you're

697
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,039
trying to run that knife through it

698
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,720
always be cautious

699
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,640
when you're dealing with these squashes

700
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,400
make sure the board is dry so i got this

701
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,880
towel right here

702
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,480
so make sure the board is dry

703
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,600
right

704
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,840
like that

705
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,600
make sure the board is definitely got

706
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,000
it's not wet because you don't want the

707
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,159
squash to slip when you're cutting it

708
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,760
keep that in mind right this is holiday

709
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,559
recipe right here i mean the maple

710
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,400
roasted brussels sprouts it's insane

711
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,000
it's so good i can't wait to eat it i'm

712
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,000
actually really really hungry right now

713
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,279
because we're delayed okay so here's a

714
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,159
couple of tips right here

715
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,720
on the squash this is a kombucha squash

716
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:46,159
right not kombucha tea

717
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,799
about your squash not kombucha tea right

718
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,600
so keep that in mind all right

719
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,159
and

720
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,400
what i'm doing is i'm taking my knife

721
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,480
right this knife right here

722
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,320
and i'm cutting this out

723
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,640
carefully

724
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,799
kind of putting my thumb on here

725
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,400
so i'm holding the knife in a special

726
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,320
way i'm not putting my knife under the

727
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,640
blade right here i'm not putting my my

728
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,279
hand under the blade

729
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,360
i'm holding the knife but i'm putting my

730
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,640
thumb thumb up closer to the knife like

731
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,440
that right

732
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,440
and this is how i do it okay and this is

733
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,240
where you don't get cut

734
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,720
and i'm taking out this really hard part

735
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,240
right there

736
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,840
taking that off

737
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,240
because i've seen it over and over again

738
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,919
over the years somebody's grandmom

739
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,159
somebody's granddad somebody's uncle

740
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,960
somebody's aunt sweeney's nephew

741
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,440
somebody ends up biting on that at the

742
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,440
table somewhere and then someone's

743
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,919
getting to the dentist with an emergency

744
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,840
dental problem

745
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,039
so i like taking that really hard part

746
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,799
off

so

794
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,520
i have to say that because someone would

795
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,559
say oh he's not giving any unique tips

796
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,360

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,080
lots of unique tips for sure now what

799
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,440
people don't realize is that fur that's

800
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,399
left behind

801
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,080
here that fur okay not that seed get

802
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,120
that seed out

803
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,880
but that fur is bitter

804
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,960
and everybody leaves it in

805
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,799
and their squash experience isn't as

806
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,120
great as it should be it's not as great

807
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,039
as it should be so it should be a better

808
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,600
squash experience

809
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,080
but that fur is left behind you want to

810
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,399
scrape that out because it doesn't taste

811
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,559
good it doesn't taste like that sweet

812
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,960
squash is supposed to taste it's got an

813
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,200
entirely different flavor

814
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,200
so you want to scrape that out and i

815
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,720
people don't know that this is bitter

816
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,640
and doesn't have a good flavor they

817
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,799
don't know that that's going to make

818
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,640
their squash dish not that great

819
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,399
they don't know this

820
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,840
so what i'm doing is getting that out

821
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,440
there it is

822
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:39,360

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,159
on telegram tick-tock yes that's it

824
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,600

826
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,240

and hit the floor

850
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,919
and that's why we do everything live all

851
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,679
the time because

852
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,399

853
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,159

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,440
all right you want to take the top off

858
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,990
the squash when you're doing the

859
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,679
butternut squash okay

860
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,080

that off

871
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,880
just you don't want to cut a lot of it

872
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,880
like you don't want to cut all that

873
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,880
part off you just want to cut a thin

874
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
slice at the back of your butternut

875
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,960

it's baked

883
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,120

921
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,200
this is cooking up nice

922
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,279
on the little burner so let's take a

923
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,760
look at this

924
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,600
so we have is the butternut squash

925
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,120
i cut off the ends there's a divot in

926
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,159
here

927
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,360
why

928
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,159
because there was a pretty big hole

929
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,600
poked into this i see it all the time in

930
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,919
the market

931
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,519
and what people don't realize

932
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,840
is those holes

933
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,760
right here's one here

934
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,240
those gashes

935
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,040
were equipment gashes

936
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,480
that was equipment gashes

937
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,200
equipment

938
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,119
that you don't know what's on it you

939
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,359
don't know what's on that farm equipment

940
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,119
you don't know what's on that grocery

941
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,919
store equipment you don't know what's on

942
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,440
the

943
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,960
the you know you don't know what's on

944
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,560
that

945
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,679
right

946
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,960
so what you want to do is carve out any

947
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,240
suspicious hole or

948
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,760
mark that's big enough you carve it out

949
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,760
now the squash that hit the floor

950
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,919
which i'm just gonna grab for a second

951
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,159
this is a squash that ran away the

952
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,879
squash did not want to be cut open it's

953
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,079
a shy squash okay

954
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,599
now

955
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,040
let's see if there's any marks on this

956
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,960
one because i thought there was one

957
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,240
there's a little one on this one here's

958
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,760
one right here

959
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,520
it's right there

960
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,480
wait here we go right there see that

961
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,280
mark

962
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,280
i'm gonna cut that out

963
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,839
i cut that off

964
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,560
so i'm gonna put that over here

965
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,839
that was on the floor so i'm not gonna

966
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,640
put on the cutting board even though the

967
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,119
floor is clean so over here

968
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,640
so anyway

969
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,079
the bottom line is what i'm trying to

970
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,800
say is we don't know what's on that

971
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,040
equipment we don't know what's on that

972
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,400
whatever went into i've seen some gashes

973
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,040
in some of the big

974
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,800
big squashes and other things like that

975
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,520
and those gashes

976
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,119
there's grease on that equipment

977
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,960
so a little bit of grease goes into like

978
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,800
because i've seen all the farm equipment

979
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,640
i've walked on a lot of farms i've

980
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,920
visited a lot of farms visit some

981
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,320
friends farms i've spent all around and

982
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,760
all that farm equipment there's grease

983
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,359
on every tractor grease on everything

984
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,599
and what happens is people don't realize

985
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,440
this so when you see when you see

986
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,760
injuries to things you want to cut them

987
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,720
out because you can have some grease and

988
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,760
that's another original medical medium

989
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,280
tip

990
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,960
which is really important let's cut this

991
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,560
open actually let's do that so

992
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,440
let me make sure the board's not wet

993
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,960
okay

994
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,720
so you don't want the board wet when

995
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,880
you're cutting your squashes you can

996
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,960
even put a towel down so you can

997
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,400
actually put a towel down while you're

998
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,280
cutting it too

999
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,720
but

1000
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,720
this is a pretty dry board

1001
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,760
chris says i work on a small scale

1002
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,119
organic farm it's hard haha yeah i know

1003
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,040
i can't

1004
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,040
i could imagine i know i understand

1005
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,960
right so here's the butter butternut

1006
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,960
squash right so i'm gonna cut this one

1007
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,520
now what i what i don't like about

1008
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,320
squashes is cutting them i don't like it

1009
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,960
right

1010
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,320
because you to be really careful you got

1011
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,119
to be really careful when you're cutting

1012
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,480
this can't can't be reckless you got to

1013
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,640
be cautious so here we go

1014
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,760
same rule applies with every single

1015
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,480
squash

1016
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,480
every single squash you scoop out

1017
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,000
not just the seeds

1018
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,440
not just the seeds of the squash

1019
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,320
right

1020
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,720
but you scoop out more than the seeds

1021
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,680
you scoop out the fur

1022
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,720
that fur you don't want to be baking and

1023
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,960
eating

1024
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,440
it's not going to hurt you it's just not

1025
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,040
going to make a pleasant flavor you're

1026
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,800
going to go into this part of the squash

1027
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,480
which is the sweetest part of squash and

1028
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,520
then there's this bitter side to it

1029
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,040
right there

1030
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,960
and you're gonna be like what i thought

1031
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,440
i had the swedish squash the sweetest

1032
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,800
one and it's not so sweet so i'm gonna

1033
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,800
scoop this one out too right

1034
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,599
so you wanna get

1035
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,160
that out

1036
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,400
now i stuffed this butternut squash that

1037
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,680
i that i've already cooked that we're

1038
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,359
gonna fill and prepare and all that

1039
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,680
okay here we go

1040
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,839
right so what i did was

1041
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,599
then you get this fur too out of here

1042
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,599
so if your squash has it up here you

1043
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,079
want it up there too you'll know because

1044
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,880
if you cook this and you just eat this

1045
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,000
part by itself you'll be like that just

1046
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,040
didn't taste great

1047
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,200
but when you get it out

1048
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,160
when you get it out

1049
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,320
wow

1050
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,280
tastes amazing now what i did with this

1051
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,720
squash because i'm i'm stuffing these

1052
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,040
squashes

1053
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,280
and baking them i cut a divot in here

1054
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,960
like this

1055
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,320
i wanted to make sure i had some

1056
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,240
stuffing room

1057
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,400
so i cut a divot right in the center a

1058
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,839
little bit just a little piece is what i

1059
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,440
did

1060
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,440
like that

1061
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,880
and so when i filled it

1062
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,000
i got room

1063
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,440
and that's what's happening with this

1064
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,560
one right here which is a cooked one

1065
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,079
right here which i'm excited about

1066
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,320
lake culture says

1067
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,320
now it makes sense why my pumpkin dishes

1068
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,880
taste different each time gotta remove

1069
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,960
the fur you got same thing same thing

1070
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,560
with the pumpkin identical thing with

1071
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,560
the pumpkin it's identical

1072
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,720
same problem so i'm gonna move this over

1073
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,079
a little bit

1074
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,440
i want to show you tip we're doing

1075
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,520

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,280
that as well a couple cool tips about

1077
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,200
brussels sprouts

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,400
right so i'm going to get this cleaned

1079
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,400
up just give me a second you guys

1080
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,680
so the one thing about the holidays is

1081
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,599
that

1082
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,160
you gotta keep a light heart when you're

1083
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,640
making food for family and friends

1084
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,880
and you gotta have fun doing it and it

1085
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,440
doesn't have to be perfect

1086
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,760
never have it never has to be perfect

1087
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,839
but there's these cool things you can do

1088
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,480
to make it taste better right so which

1089
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,480
is really great

1090
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,320
all right

1091
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,920
so i cleared off that but let me just

1092
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,920
see if the stuffing is nice and done

1093
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,000
all right this is done now now i'm going

1094
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,520
to add

1095
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,520
some maple syrup to this

1096
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,839
right

1097
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,839
add a little bit of maple syrup

1098
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,400
because i want this to taste incredible

1099
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,640
and i'm going to add some lemon juice to

1100
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,640
this too

1101
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,400
add some lemon as well

1102
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,319
there we go

1103
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,319
a little bit more lemon

1104
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,480
make it really pop

1105
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,480
right

1106
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:46,000
mix it up because i got that maple syrup

1107
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,000
in there now i'm mixing it up with lemon

1108
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,960
it's just really delicious

1109
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,280
i'm going to put some dried thyme in

1110
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,280
here

1111
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,680
right pinch of dried thyme

1112
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,680
how about that

1113
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,359
and now i'm going to stuff

1114
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,880
these turkeys

1115
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,359

1116
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,400

1119
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,160
i never liked that whole turkey gizzard

1120
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,680
thing

1121
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,520
turkey heart turkey gizzard because

1122
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,800
that's what's in there i forget to put a

1123
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,599
little garlic in there so let me get a

1124
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,839
garlic clove going

1125
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,839
right

1126
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,440
i never liked that whole stuff the

1127
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,000
turkey gizzard

1128
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,839
like with the gizzards and the heart

1129
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,599
because it's like you got a little heart

1130
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,119
little turkey heart in your hand right

1131
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,119
you know in the bag that comes in you

1132
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,400
pull the bag out of the turkey

1133
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,000
if you like turkey that's great i mean

1134
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,960
it's you can still do turkey in medical

1135
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,359
medium

1136
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,119
but when you pull that bag out

1137
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,880
trisha murray says me neither you pull

1138
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,040
that bag out and it's got all that stuff

1139
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,400
in there right it's got the liver that's

1140
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,599
the gizzard thing it's got the liver

1141
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,359
right

1142
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,800
and it's got a heart

1143
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,079
so you look at the heart you're like

1144
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,520
well what do i do with this heart will

1145
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,400
you chop it up because you put it in

1146
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,079
there for flavor

1147
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,160

1159
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,480
these squashes

1160
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,839
let's do

1161
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,280
that you can put a little bit of salt in

1162
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,520
here

1163
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,280
you're welcome to do that

1164
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,800
right so you can do that if you want a

1165
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,000
little bit of salt in there you can put

1166
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,000
a little bit of salt in here

1167
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,359
i usually keep the salt out

1168
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,680
you know that's what i do i keep the

1169
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,440
salt out

1170
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,160
all right so here we go

1171
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,160
let's take a look

1172
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,160
so

1173
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,000
if you can see and you can get a

1174
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,880
close-up on this if you want to there

1175
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,119
you go

1176
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,119
look at that it's like a pie it's like a

1177
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,760
pie crust

1178
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:39,040
right telegram take a look tic tac it's

1179
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,119
a pie crust that's what it's like

1180
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,760
so i'm gonna fill it

1181
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,760
look at that

1182
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,560
how incredible is that right

1183
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,520
so i'm filling this

1184
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,760
pie crust basically

1185
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,319
okay so there's one right there let's

1186
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,319
get another

1187
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
and

1188
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,079
i got another one right here

1189
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,800
you don't have to make your own

1190
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,800
cauliflower rice you can

1191
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,760
buy the rice minced in the store

1192
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,839
there you go look at that

1193
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,079
that that's so good that's insanely good

1194
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,800
i love that

1195
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,359
i'm going to get these back

1196
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,359
on the pan

1197
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:53,440
now i'm going to bring these over here

1198
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,440
this is the butternut right here okay

1199
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,200
why are you cooking too long not sure if

1200
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,760
this tastes good

1201
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,119
if it's over or well done

1202
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,640
well the thing is you don't want the

1203
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,880
carrots

1204
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,680
hard

1205
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,680
right

1206
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,359
i don't have the heat on too high but

1207
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,359
you don't want the carrots hard

1208
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,720
you want to make sure those are cooked

1209
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,119
because the squash are already cooked

1210
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,839
they're already done so when i'm

1211
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,240
throwing this in at 400 heat in a minute

1212
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,720
to just basically really you know and

1213
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,640
you want the cauliflower to cook the

1214
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,040
problem is is the cauliflower takes a

1215
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,760
little longer cauliflower rice

1216
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,160
you don't want that hard either

1217
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,359
you want these just cooked right they're

1218
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:47,839
not super soft but they're not

1219
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:49,520
hard right that's that's why

1220
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,920
so what i'm doing is popping this on

1221
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,920
like that

1222
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,040
there we go

1223
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,599
all right so we got these all set these

1224
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,599
are going in the oven

1225
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,680
guys give me a second

1226
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,680
i'm gonna pop these in

1227
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,599
so that's what we have and that's what's

1228
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,599
going on right there

1229
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,119
maybe i'll drop this whole thing by

1230
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,319
accident on my way it'll come off

1231
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,119
that's what happens when you're live you

1232
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,240
don't know what could happen

1233
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,599
that is

1234
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,599
an amazing pan right there

1235
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,839
all right so that's in the oven

1236
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,280
i'm gonna clean up the board for a

1237
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,280
minute you guys give me a second here

1238
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,920
so the thing is is

1239
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,280
what you you want if you want your stuff

1240
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,359
to taste really good all these little

1241
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,640
tips matter too which is really great so

1242
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,160
i'm gonna show you some brussels sprouts

1243
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,160
i'm gonna do a little brussels sprout

1244
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,160
dish

1245
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,560
so

1246
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,359
i got some brussels sprouts right here

1247
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,200
okay here we are

1248
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,319
now these aren't raw

1249
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:19,280
i lightly steamed these

1250
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:21,520
because what happens is when you roast

1251
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,040
brussels sprouts

1252
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,599
they'll be tough

1253
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,119
like chewy and tough

1254
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,920
that that's hard on a lot of people for

1255
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,680
a lot of reasons not so easy to digest

1256
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,480
when they're tough and chewy and just

1257
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,880
not that fun you want them roasted but

1258
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,359
yet kind of creamy inside a little bit

1259
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,720
roasted and crispy on the top and on the

1260
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,720
edges

1261
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,559
but creamy inside like that's what you

1262
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,800
want so those are the steamed ones right

1263
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,800
there

1264
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,760
so what i'm going to do is cut some of

1265
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,800
these

1266
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,400
right here

1267
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,760
right and i'm going to put these right

1268
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,760
up here in front of here for you

1269
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,760
if you guys can see those a little bit

1270
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,960
so i'm just going to cut these up

1271
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,960
i'm going to cut them in half

1272
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,400
i'm going to move them out

1273
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,599
i'm going to cut them in half like this

1274
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,559
so these are going to be the maple

1275
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,440
roasted

1276
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,440
brussels sprouts

1277
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,760
right here

1278
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,559
i got a couple of raw ones i want to

1279
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,119
show you a tip on that

1280
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,200
which is going to be cool

1281
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,440
but i like to steam these a little

1282
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,480
because you can roast them

1283
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,000
all you want in there raw to start with

1284
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,240
and what happens is they're going to be

1285
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
tough and chewy they're just going to be

1286
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,359
tough and chewy that's what they're

1287
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,880
going to be

1288
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,599
so i'm giving these guys all a little

1289
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,359
bit

1290
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,920
of a cut right here you guys see this on

1291
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,920
telegram

1292
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,599
all right

1293
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,599
get some more

1294
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,559
now i did a big batch

1295
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,200
i steamed them for about 20 minutes

1296
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,280
you can even steam them for 30 minutes

1297
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,280
you can try you can check them out but i

1298
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,119
steamed them for

1299
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,680
20 to maybe 25 minutes is what i did

1300
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,680
there we go

1301
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,359
did you cut the ends off okay good

1302
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,559
question i did it

1303
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:50,240
because if you steam them

1304
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,839
if you steam them they still come they

1305
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,920
come out really good those ends see

1306
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,839
that's the end right there so you're

1307
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,359
talking about that end and i saved this

1308
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,920
one on purpose to show you this right

1309
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,520
here right so what's interesting here is

1310
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,200
you got this end right here it's

1311
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,280
sticking out right

1312
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,119
so you got this end

1313
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,000
and

1314
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,280
what's happening is you can you can eat

1315
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,200
that end

1316
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,640
when it's cooked

1317
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,559
but that's why steaming is really good

1318
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,960
you steam for 25 minutes all this at

1319
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,720
least starts to soften up if you steam

1320
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,240
them longer this is all tender here i

1321
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,119
know a lot of people do this a lot of

1322
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,599
people will cut this end off like that

1323
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:30,000
so they'll cut the end completely off i

1324
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,319
keep them on even when there's that

1325
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
piece right there i still keep them on

1326
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:37,040
but you're welcome to cut them off

1327
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,040
definitely right

1328
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:42,240
you're definitely welcome to do that

1329
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,480
and

1330
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,960
there we go

1331
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,280
do some more

1332
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,240
i'm gonna make a nice big batch

1333
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,200
i got the squashes in the oven i could

1334
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,200
smell them already

1335
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,520
if you guys don't like maple syrup

1336
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,119
you can use honey if you want

1337
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,280
if you're if you're somebody that just

1338
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,520
won't do maple syrup for some reason you

1339
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,760
can use honey and that's okay

1340
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,760
right

1341
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,559
let's cut a few more

1342
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,559
and then we're

1343
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:39,200

1344
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,640

1345
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,880

inspiration

1429
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,240

we don't want it too too hot right

1441
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,559
unless you want it really spicy i mean

1442
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,000
sometimes i'll even

1443
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,559
go spicier

1444
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,960

1445
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,880

salt if you want

1449
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:41,500

1450
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:44,690
little bit of that let me whisk it

1451
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,690
[Music]

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,640
right on top and we're going to mix it

1458
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,640
up

1459
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,280

1460
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,280
a little bit of that

1461
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:24,799

there we go

1465
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,839
let's get that on a baking pan

1466
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,040

1467
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,200
just got a little bit of

1468
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,799

1472
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,960
what do you guys think on telegram did

1473
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,240
you ever have these did you ever make

1474
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,440
the recipe

1475
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,440
right out of liver rescue

1476
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,559

1478
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,799
so

1479
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:47,040
save some sauce at the bottom of the

1480
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,960
bowl so that's what i recommend okay

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,680
so save some of that sauce at the bottom

1482
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,920
of the bowl i'm gonna put all these on

1483
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,920

00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:00,760
there we go and i'm gonna spread them

1485
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,760
out on the pan look at that

1486
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,079
strange how people get mad when you heal

1487
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,319
sarah dylan they do get mad

1488
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,079
and know what's really strange

1489
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:15,839
is when

1490
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,799
tens of thousands and thousands of

1491
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,599
people

1492
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:22,480
it goes into millions around the world

1493
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,799
and they're healing from the mm info

1494
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,400
that's not allowed

1495
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,520
because then they'll call you a cult or

1496
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,359
something

1497
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,960
say oh you're a cult well that's funny

1498
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:33,359
then it must be the biggest cult on the

1499
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,599
planet because 500 million people are

1500
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:37,599
drinking celery juice

1501
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,040
millions and millions of medical medium

1502
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,119
books are out there in almost every

1503
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,359
country in the world

1504
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,839
i guess we're just not allowed to heal

1505
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:48,160
or something

1506
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,680
it's the craziest thing i've ever seen

1507
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,000
and it's all free

1508
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:55,119
does that make any sense it's all free

1509
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,119
go to library and get the book

1510
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,280
meanwhile you got the medical colts

1511
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,839

1512
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,839

i'm gonna let these cedar for a second i

1543
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,680
want to show you a couple tips

1544
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,559
let's get another brussels sprout right

1545
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,520
here

1546
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,440
and i want to show you guys this right

1547
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,960
what i do is i peel back the leaf i mean

1548
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,960
everybody probably does that

1549
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,160
i'm sure a lot of people do that right

1550
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:38,480
if the leaf is yellow or yellowing you

1551
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,480
want to take that leaf off

1552
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,520
that leaf

1553
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,880
tastes

1554
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,880
terrible

1555
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,920
terrible so when you get the yellow

1556
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,160
leaves

1557
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,920
on your brussels sprouts

1558
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,760
awful flavor

1559
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,640
it'll ruin it'll ruin the whole brussels

1560
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,480
sprout because the yellow leaf

1561
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,119
decayed

1562
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,280
and so it's just got this awful oxidized

1563
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,039
flavor it could ruin it just ruins your

1564
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,960
whole dish so what i did was i picked

1565
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,480
off all the yellow leaves

1566
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,799
right i'll show you guys on a close-up

1567
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,440
too i picked up all i picked them all

1568
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:14,319
off so this is a raw brussels sprout

1569
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,440
these are steamed in here

1570
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:19,440
amber says starting the cleanse with mom

1571
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,920
whoa incredible

1572
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,160
so what i do is i take this off

1573
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,000
when they're yellow or decayed on any

1574
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,280
level and right there there's that dk on

1575
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,200
there it's on there i know if you guys

1576
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,799
can see it it's basically just plant

1577
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,640
decay it's it's

1578
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:34,559
it's leaves that have gone bad on here

1579
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,400
so i kind of pull back that leaf that

1580
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,039
one's really stuck on

1581
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:42,319
but i pull that leaf off like that

1582
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:44,160
there you go aj i saw you

1583
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:45,839
there you go and i took that leaf off

1584
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,559
these leaves taste terrible when they

1585
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:51,280
start to decay like that

1586
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,559
and i know people peel back their

1587
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,880
brussels sprouts

1588
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,839
i do know that some people do that right

1589
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,359
but

1590
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:01,200
the leaf when it's decaying or yellow it

1591
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:04,160
stays in the mix it's going to ruin the

1592
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,160
flavor of the whole dish

1593
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,359
right

1594
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,359
so in rumble kim marie

1595
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:15,039
and cindy you know and ben ben watson

1596
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,039
i'm glad you guys are there

1597
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,240
glad you guys are on there

1598
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,920
so debbie said did he say pull off the

1599
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,400
yellow only

1600
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,280
you can pull off the yellow only yeah

1601
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,760
only

1602
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:30,720
but if you see a leaf that's not yellow

1603
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,240
but it's like it's decayed okay here's

1604
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,240
one right here

1605
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,160
you see this one's not okay here it is

1606
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,079
right there that'll show it perfectly

1607
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,640
good thing i had one left

1608
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,720
see right there you guys a close-up i

1609
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:45,280
know you can't see it on telegram

1610
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,119
no maybe you guys can on tick-tock

1611
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,359
put that close-up up there

1612
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,839
that right there so you can do this you

1613
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:53,200
can even take shortcuts and not peel

1614
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,039
back the leaf if you don't want to

1615
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,119
that's the leaf i peeled back you can

1616
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,880
take shortcuts if you don't want to peel

1617
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,640
back the leaf right like you can peel

1618
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,760
back that leaf but if you don't want to

1619
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,960
you can just do this

1620
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,799
if you want

1621
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,119
and you get rid of that because that

1622
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:10,640
piece right there will ruin

1623
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,880
that taste

1624
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,640
of your meal it just does

1625
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,799
those leaves when they're they when they

1626
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,960
get nasty like that they're nasty to

1627
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:20,720
your meal so that's really important to

1628
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,160

we're all teachers here right that's

1645
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,520

01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,200
you know we're all trying to teach look

1647
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,280
the whole point though is with that

1648
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,280
brussels sprout look out for that that's

1649
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,880
something to know like i said before if

1650
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,240
you're going to steam brussels sprouts

1651
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,319
and that's the only way you're going to

1652
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,240
make them another tip that's important

1653
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:16,000
when you steam brussels sprouts and it's

1654
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,599
the only way you're going to make them

1655
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,760
or you're going to cook them in some way

1656
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,400
you want to cook them till they're soft

1657
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,119
inside until the fork goes through

1658
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,359
so let me just show you right here right

1659
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,359
like you want to make sure like that

1660
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:31,680
these are still these are only steamed

1661
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:33,440
for 20 minutes 25 minutes right but

1662
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,200
there might be a soft one in here okay

1663
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,520
here's a soft one

1664
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,760
you want to steam them until that fork

1665
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,839
goes through

1666
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,799
because if you have any digestive issues

1667
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:48,160
whatsoever that's to that's how you

1668
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:51,039
avoid digestive distress you don't want

1669
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:53,680
half cooked brussels sprouts you don't

1670
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:55,039
want chewy brussels sprouts if you're

1671
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,160
going to steam them or cook them and

1672
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,839
just eat them so you're not even going

1673
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,039
to do this roasted brussels sprout meal

1674
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,559
out of the book

1675
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,520
you want to make sure you steam them

1676
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:05,599
until the fork goes in where it's soft

1677
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,359
where they're creamy inside where you

1678
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,599
can eat them and they're creamy inside

1679
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,440
that's how you want to do it that's

1680
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,000
important

1681
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,160
for any kind of problems at all

1682
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,240
kenneth says maybe that's why i was not

1683
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,920
having it when eating steamed brussels

1684
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,200
sprouts for three to four days during my

1685
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,119
original 369 that's exactly why it can

1686
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,000
it

1687
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:27,920
exactly why

1688
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,280
you when they're chewy or tough in the

1689
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:33,839
center you're gonna have a tummy full of

1690
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,839
roughage that doesn't want to break down

1691
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,440
or digest easy

1692
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,960
and and what i did here is i steamed

1693
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,640
them for 25 minutes and that's not

1694
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,039
enough if you just want to have it that

1695
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:45,760
way alone but when i put it in the oven

1696
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,839
and then i roast them for a while too

1697
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,119
that's where it takes that next level

1698
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:51,280
where they're going to start getting it

1699
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,640
you know softer but you can cook them

1700
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,319
not roast them you can cook them where

1701
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,680
they're where you're steaming them real

1702
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,039
soft if you're going to do like a mono

1703
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,839
cleanser brussels sprouts or something

1704
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,520
like that if you're going to do

1705
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,720
something like on the 369 and you're

1706
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,559
cleansing you want to cook them when

1707
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,920
they're really really soft that's what

1708
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,640
you want to do

1709
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,880
yep that's important

1710
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,880
so

1711
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,599
all right so i have these getting ready

1712
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,760

1762
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:08,960

right

1766
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,239
we're gonna cook this down for a while

1767
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:24,159
that's what we need to do

1768
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,159
so i'm going to dice up an apple

1769
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:29,440
these apples are incredible

1770
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,440
right here

1771
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,799
i want to give you a tip on apples

1772
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,080
you want to have or enjoy the best apple

1773
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,520
do you know do you want to know how to

1774
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,520
pick apples

1775
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,199
i'm not talking about off the tree

1776
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,880
i'm talking about picking them at the

1777
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:44,000
store right

1778
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,560
do you want to know how to pick these

1779
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,440
apples at the store

1780
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,719
you want to look for apple skins

1781
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,799
that have

1782
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,600
that kind of design those marks you see

1783
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,600
this

1784
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,360
it's not a perfect

1785
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,520
apple

1786
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,199
right you don't want bruises there's no

1787
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,560
bruises on this apple right there's no

1788
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:05,360
bruises

1789
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:08,640
but the best flavored apples inside have

1790
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,880
the skin that looks kind of geographic

1791
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,320
see that right there

1792
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,880
see how it looks like it's got like

1793
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,640
constellations or stars

1794
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,159
and that that means that whether it's

1795
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,360
honey crisp all the same whether it's

1796
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,800
fuji all the same this is what you're

1797
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,000
looking for well there's pink lady

1798
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,159
that's what you're looking for red

1799
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,640
delicious that's what you're looking for

1800
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:27,520
you're looking for the skins to have

1801
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,719
like

1802
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,719
this

1803
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,640
rough patches

1804
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,239
where it's like what is that like what's

1805
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,280
that rough patch

1806
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:39,760
right that means you have the crispiest

1807
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,679
sweetest apples

1808
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,960
out of that bunch

1809
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:47,440
okay and the only people that probably

1810
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:50,080
have an idea about that one are apple

1811
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,600
growers themselves that are so

1812
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,080
they're so used to tasting their own

1813
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,159
apples and picking them and and trying

1814
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,040
them out and harvesting them that they

1815
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:00,640
know this right they know this and i've

1816
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,360
been blessed to know it because i've

1817
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:06,800
picked a lot of apples and so it's

1818
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:09,840
really a special little tip

1819
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,040
so i want to do is cut these pieces thin

1820
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,199
i want them

1821
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:15,280
thin and small i don't want these pieces

1822
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:16,880
too big because this apple's gonna cook

1823
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,480
down

1824
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,640
is what it's gonna do so i'm cutting

1825
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,560
these pretty thin i want this apple to

1826
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,159
cook down in that sauce

1827
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:28,640
all right so i don't want big hunky

1828
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,640
pieces in this right

1829
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:34,640
lacey said breath bauer says i had no

1830

1831
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,760

1832
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:40,719

1834
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,159
whoa

1835
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,760
you will get the best apples and then

1836
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:48,320
everybody else will have these other

1837
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,640
apples that aren't the best

1838
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:54,560
lori malone says wow great apple tip

same pineapples now i picked

1843
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:06,000
purposely all these kinds of apples

1844
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:08,480
where they have that geographic zone so

1845
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,960
these are all the best apples possible

1846
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,640
this has less see see how's this less

1847
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,640
this look that has less believe it or

1848
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,760
not it has it but less it's not like

1849
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,440
that

1850
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,320
you see the different difference there

1851
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,760
we go

1852
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,199
you see that

1853
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,840
that's how you pick them in the store

1854
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:25,520
guess which one you pick you pick that

1855
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,679
one at the store

1856
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,920
i want to show you on tick-tock you pick

1857
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:31,679
the one here

1858
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:35,520
right there you see all that you don't

1859
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,060
pick that one you pick this one

1860
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,280
yeah

1861
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,520

so happy about you will be like okay

1866
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,520
wait a minute and if you have a basket

1867
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,280
of apples you you bought a bunch of

1868
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,239
different apples you'll know when you

1869
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,080
start

1870
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:56,239
trying it out like that

1871
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,960
be open-hearted has a question looks

1872
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:00,080
like a question for soc really

1873
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,560
because

1874
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,120
my brain can't hold

1875
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:08,480
the trillions of pounds of information

1876
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:10,960
from soc every second so why is that the

1877
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:13,760
geographic area right

1878
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,520
okay that means that a temperature

1879
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,400
change happened

1880
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,719
and that temperature temperature change

1881
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,320
brought the sweetness out so the

1882
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,159
temperature fluctuation spirit of

1883
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,280
compassion is telling me right now so

1884
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:26,719
you're

1885
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,960
that's how that's because i didn't know

1886
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:31,920
i forgot or didn't know but it's attempt

1887
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,920
that means we had we had in that crop

1888
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,920
right when it was coming to almost

1889
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,960
getting ripe the whole batch of apples

1890
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,880
in that crop

1891
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,679
we had some temperature changes where

1892
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,600
the temperature went really high or low

1893
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,520
and most likely the temperature dropped

1894
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,760
and went low so that means it might have

1895
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,679
been a frost coming on or close to a

1896
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,199
frost the temperature spirit compassion

1897
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,360
is telling me right now the temperature

1898
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:55,440
dropped to maybe 40 degrees and it

1899
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,040
wasn't 40 degrees for a while and it's

1900
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,280
the end of august it's the end of

1901
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,600
september it's in the middle of october

1902
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,120
and then often boom you get a 38 degree

1903
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,920
night

1904
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:07,120
and then the the sweetness comes out and

1905
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,360
the skin

1906
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,960
turns that rough color because of that

1907
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,400
temperature shift

1908
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,159
because the chemistry of the apple

1909
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,880
changes spirit of compassion says it

1910
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:19,199
changes and shifts and then the sugar

1911
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,199
comes out to more it comes out of the

1912
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,199
core like literally sugar comes right

1913
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:24,960
out of the core and then the core will

1914
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:27,199
be won't be sweet

1915
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,719
the core won't be sweet and what happens

1916
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,719
is with these other apples when that

1917
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:32,000
doesn't happen in certain crops spirit

1918
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,239
of compassion is dumb this is new

1919
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,600
information for me i had no idea about

1920
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,560
this spirit kabash is telling me right

1921
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,920
now that

1922
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,960
the core

1923
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,360
right

1924
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,040
is more sweeter on the not so good

1925
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,280
apples and then all the flesh and the

1926
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,880
apples when this doesn't happen is not

1927
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,560
as sweet so that's a piece of

1928
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,640
information i just learned now because

1929
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,800
yes you asked

1930
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,360
you know

1931
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,679
i like learning

1932
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,360
i'm learning a heck of a lot right now

1933
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,120
with that new book that i'm trying to

1934
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,640
finish and hand to the publisher

1935
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,640
hopefully soon

1936
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:07,040
i'm learning a lot information about the

1937
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,800
human body i had no idea about even all

1938
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,760
these years

1939
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,800
the book is a massive book

1940
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,800
a massive book

1941
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,280
so i'm going to get this apple in here

1942
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,920
and actually get this apple cooking down

1943
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,920
is what we're going to do

1944
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,120
so we're going to chop this up

1945
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,239
and that's why i wear glasses because if

1946
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:40,400
i answer questions specifically that

1947
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:42,400
spirit of compassion is giving me new

1948
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,880
information for in the moment like an

1949
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,480
actual read

1950
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,080
then

1951
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,000
now i'm getting whited out it's called

1952
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,960
snow blindness and i talk about it in

1953
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,920
here

1954
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:56,080
of how i lose the eyesight from that and

1955
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,159
then i'm struggling to actually even see

1956
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,159
anything so that's what starts happening

1957
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:02,159
and that's why these are on so that you

1958
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:03,840
don't see me like this

1959
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,440
okay and the glasses kind of kind of

1960
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,239
hide that when i need to do that like

1961
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,239
that sometimes

1962
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,199
all right let me get the rest these

1963
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,840
apples in while those brussels sprouts

1964
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,840
are cooking up

1965
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,960
this is an incredible

1966
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,239
incredible sauce

1967
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,800
it really is

1968
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:35,840
incredible sauce

1969
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,840
chop the rest of these up

1970
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,320
i'm mincing them practically right

1971
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,000
because you don't want these big hunky

1972
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,800
apple pieces in that sauce because you

1973
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,400
want them to break down that's the key

1974
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,159
that's that's a really important key

1975
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,560
right there so when you do it this way

1976
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:56,800
like that you got it nice and minced up

1977
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,800
right

1978
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:03,000

2030
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:58,239
all the dense and it's getting the dense

2031
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,320
and it's getting soft like squishy it

2032
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:02,239
still could be a good orange ready watch

2033
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,960
this it still could be a good orange

2034
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:06,719
check this out looks amazing

2035
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,800
it's incredible

2036
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,800
it looks incredible but why did i tell

2037
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,840
you not to pick this orange

2038
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,640
like why

2039
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,600
it looks great but it's got the softness

2040
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,679
to it

2041
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,080
that's because when you buy a bunch of

2042
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:21,840
these and then you've got them in a bowl

2043
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:24,480
whether they're on the counter or even

2044
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,520
in the fridge in a week they're going to

2045
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,040
start going bad fast that's why unless

2046
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,880
you're going to eat them right now

2047
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,480
they're going to start going bad quick

2048
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,080
and when you buy oranges you want them

2049
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,600
to stick around you want to be able to

2050
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,600
have your oranges you want them to be

2051
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,640
able to stick around that's what you

2052
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,880
want to do and so what happens is is

2053
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:45,360
you know when you get those soft spots

2054
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,360
like that and it's soft all the soft

2055
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:49,600
different dents and everything

2056
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:52,239
you just you it's starting to get to a

2057
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,360
point where it's shifting gears it's

2058
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:55,360
starting to shift gears

2059
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:00,560
right so i'm doing juice from one orange

2060
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:04,520
but i cut two oranges why not

2061
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,520
i'm gonna pop that in here

2062
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,880
okay

2063
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,800
my screen keeps freezing

2064
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,960
adelina

2065

2072
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,600
back

2073
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,120
so they freeze people out to make them

2074
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,679
go away

2075
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,880

is i talk about

2155
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,000

[Laughter]

2162
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,960

01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:56,560
i actually stained my beautiful

2164
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,280
spatula

2165
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,880
so

2166
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,159
that's going to be stained for a long

2167
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,159
time

2168
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,920
and i was really proud of myself for not

2169
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:05,520
doing that for a long time because i was

2170
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,040
using a different tool

2171
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,920

2197
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:05,360
but what am i gonna say if it's

2198
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,880
original medical medium information that

2199
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:09,360
comes from spirit of compassion and

2200
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,280
nobody knew before am i supposed to just

2201
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:13,840
pretend that's not really it and then i

2202
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:16,159
got it from somebody else when i didn't

2203
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,520
this smells amazing by the way amazing

2204
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,960
and it's cooking up really quick

2205
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,239
actually it's starting to cook up nice

2206
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,760
i'm gonna keep the lid on it because i

2207
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:23,679
want the juices to be in there while

2208
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,239
that is cooking

2209
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:29,199
and the thing is is how do you help

2210
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:30,800
somebody heal if you don't tell them

2211
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:32,639

2213
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:38,560
how are you going to help them find the

2214
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:40,960
rest of it someone can say epstein-barr

2215
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:43,040
but not know all the things they need to

2216
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,600
do to heal the problem or not know what

2217
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:47,120
epstein-barr causes it's just it's

2218
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,520
critical that people know where the

2219
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,480
original information comes from

2220
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,800
so

2221
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,800
all right so

2222
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:58,320
whoa those are cooking up nice brussels

2223
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:01,040
sprouts are almost done the maple

2224
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,040
brussels sprouts

2225
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,679
all right so

2226
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,520
let's move a little bit into where we're

2227
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:14,320
going next you guys

2228
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:16,960
we might plate some stuff up

2229
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:18,560
so i got these right here

2230
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:22,600
and i'm going to do some plating and i

2231
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,600
got a nice plate right here

2232
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,120
moving that over

2233
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,760
so

2234
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:40,159
these are really hot

2235
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,159
putting that one here

2236
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,760
those are hot

2237
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:51,679
i don't advise you to use your hands

2238
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:55,440
unless they've cooled down

2239
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:58,480
but i have for some reason an ability

2240
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:00,480
to stand really high intense heat with

2241
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:04,120
my hands

2242
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,120
since i was a child

2243
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:12,239
i mean i could grab hot potatoes like

2244
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,920
it's nothing

2245
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:15,920
right out of the steamer like it's

2246
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:19,239
nothing

2247
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,239
look at that

2248
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,239
so

2249
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,920
that's the big squash which is

2250
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:25,360
incredible now you can cut it like a

2251
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,360
pizza pie

2252
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,760
you can do it that way you can serve it

2253
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:32,639
like that you can take a knife and and

2254
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:35,040
cut it in pieces and serve it on

2255
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:37,280
you know an individual plate

2256
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:39,280
you can easily do that

2257
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:42,800
so that's one one way to do it too and

2258
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,800
i'll cut them up too in a little bit

2259
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,000
you can do this for thanksgiving you can

2260
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:48,080
do this for christmas what an incredible

2261
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,520
recipe it really is

2262
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,280

right leafy greens

2268
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:07,840
no one

2269
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,840
unfortunately

2270
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,159
knew

2271
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:15,760
that you can take these herbs and eat

2272
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:17,920
them in high quantity like a leafy green

2273
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,600

01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,760
you don't have to have a lot

2276
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:26,159
just a little bit it's fine

2277
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,239
i it blows people's minds every day it's

2278
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:30,719

parsley and eating them like a leafy

2282
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,159

01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:44,639
let's put this on here put a little bit

2284
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,920
on here

2285
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:49,520
just right on top you don't need a lot

2286
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,600
for this

2287
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,199
because you're not having leafy greens

2288
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,120
in this meal really you're not do unless

2289
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:58,880
you make a big salad a leafy green salad

2290
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,880
but you're not having that kind of meal

2291
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:05,120
okay alessa says

2292
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:07,520
my neurologist says that i have to have

2293
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:10,320
sir my neurologist says that i have to

2294
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:13,120
have the blood draw drawn so that he can

2295
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:14,239
keep an eye on my levels

2296
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:18,560
right

2297
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:18,560
you should listen to medical medium

2298
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:26,800
look at the the blood draw podcast too

2299
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,800
and you did oh wait you did

2300
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,800
wait a minute let me

2301
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,800
hold on you know what's funny i got this

2302
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:40,320
thing cooking and cranking and i'm

2303
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,320
trying to keep an eye on it hold on

2304
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,480
there we go i turned the heat down the

2305
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:47,679
heat was really high for some reason on

2306
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,679
here and just pumping

2307
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:52,440
this is coming out really good

2308
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,719
what happens is doctors don't know they

2309
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,719
don't have to take a lot of blood

2310
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:07,920
i'm going to get a pop really quick i

2311
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,280
don't usually take a prop out during the

2312
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,880
medical medium cooking show but i'm

2313
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,760
going to do that for now

2314
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,199
and

2315
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,639
so i'll give you a little bit of

2316
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:17,040
information about this this will be

2317
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:17,040
interesting

2318
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:21,840
there we go

2319
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,239
that cranberry sauce is going to be done

2320
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:28,639
in just a couple of minutes which is

2321
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,639
incredible

2322
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,120
okay

2323
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,840
so

2324
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,840
let's just say that

2325
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,040
let's just say that the blood lab needed

2326
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:43,040
to test for something like an a a

2327
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:45,040
anti-nuclear antigen test

2328
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,360
thyroid panel

2329
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:50,320
a1c

2330
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:53,120
check out the kidneys

2331
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:54,880
sodium levels potassium levels

2332
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:57,679
a whole bit right

2333
01:30:54,880 --> 01:31:00,159
nutritional a nutritional panel

2334
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:01,440
right a metabolic panel liver enzyme

2335
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:03,360
test the whole bit

2336
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,199
they only need this much blood

2337
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,800
that's all they need

2338
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,920
i'll show you guys on a close-up i don't

2339
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,679
think i've ever had ability to show you

2340
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,120
guys on a close-up they only need that

2341
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:13,600
much blood

2342
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:16,639
that's it

2343
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:19,520
they can take a speck of blood

2344
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:21,840
right smaller than that a speck like a

2345
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,040
speck you can't see on here like a speck

2346
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,040
and i'll put a speck you see i put a

2347
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,800
little green speck right there

2348
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:29,679
see a green speck

2349
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:31,840
they can take dehydrated blood

2350
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:34,320
from a murder scene

2351
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:36,800
50 years ago on a pair of jeans that

2352
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:39,120
were buried in a shallow grave

2353
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,560
that only had a speck of blood on that

2354
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,000
pair of jeans

2355
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:44,560
way less than that

2356
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,520
and they can do a thyroid panel

2357
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:49,440
not metabolic panel a a

2358
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:53,120
they could do a lyme disease test they

2359
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:54,880
can do mt if mthfr gene mutation tests

2360
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:57,040
they can do everything sodium levels

2361
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,960
nutritional panels all of it

2362
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,400
just so you know

2363
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,199
check out medical medium podcasts at

2364
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,639
apple podcast the blood draw episode

2365
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:07,199
so important

2366
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:08,320
so important and

2367
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:10,719
so

2368
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,560
they take the blood on purpose

2369
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:14,080
they rob the blood on purpose

2370
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,520
and all it does is send people backwards

2371
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,199
and backwards and backwards so when i

2372
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,120
tell my friends and family ask for half

2373
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:21,040
files or quarter vials well i'll tell

2374
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:23,120
them to ask for quarter vials

2375
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,719
quarter vials they can fill up each tube

2376
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,960
with a quarter

2377
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,480
quarter tubes quarter each two quarter

2378
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:31,120
amount in each two

2379
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:33,440
so that you're not losing all of your

2380
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:36,159
blood they don't need a lot of blood to

2381
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,159
make a serum

2382
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,520
so what happens is that

2383
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:42,560
when you've got chronic illness and

2384
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,239
you're sick i mean that'll trash you

2385
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,440
next thing you know you're sicker and

2386
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,880
then sicker and then you lose your

2387
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,159
immune system and you're sicker and now

2388
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,199
you catch something and then you're

2389
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,239
sicker and then you lose your immune

2390
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,520
system and you're sick and they take

2391
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,320
more blood take more blood take more

2392
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,520
blood

2393
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:58,080
and that's what they do

2394
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,080
all right so

2395
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,920
