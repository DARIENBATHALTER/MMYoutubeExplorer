00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,680
series dedicated to exposing an

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,559
organized hateful group that has been on

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,759
a Relentless pursuit to destroy the

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,759
medical medium community and that has

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,480
been attacking bullying harassing and

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,359
preying upon the chronically ill joining

8

00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,960
bakaro she's an alternative medicine

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,039
practitioner who became a whistleblower

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,640
after she witnessed this hateful group

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,079
in action when they tried to recruit her

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,320
to join them last year Amber caught the

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,440
main members of this group on legally

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,879
recorded calls describing their

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,680
premeditated multi-step plan to create a

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,559
quote postm medal medium era by feeding

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,600
false stories and claims about me and

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,559
about medical medium information to

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,519
Major media outlets in hopes that it

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,359
would lead to securing themselves a deal

22
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,519
for an anti-ed medium documentary on

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,479
Netflix that would bring Fame and other

24
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,640
benefits to them now known infamously

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,840
instead for their malicious plot that

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,040
was caught on recording and exposed we

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,119
refer to this hateful group as the

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,000
plotters their entire smear campaign is

29
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:26,280

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,880
what she wanted from me years ago and is

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,799
now seeking re Revenge she's made it her

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,799
mission to gather a bunch of plotters

34

with ulterior motives and AES to grind

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,200
including competitors in the health

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,119
industry to try to frame medical medium

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,040
and take down the community what this

38
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,000

health industry as you'll see it's also

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,360
one of the biggest instances of

43
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,640
capturing corruption within the

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,600

you have been tremendously injured and

67
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,799
harmed by what they have done the record

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,799
needs to be set straight and they need

69
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,280
to be called out for what they've done

70
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,400
and are still doing the medical medium

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,920
Community does not deserve to be

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,640
attacked like this and we are going to

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,900
set the record straight as many times as

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:32,760
we need to

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,400
[Music]

76
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,799
people who lie are liars if you're

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,000
willing to lie about one thing you might

78
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,480
be willing to lie about everything One

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,760
Lie calls into question the entirety of

80
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,760
someone's character what about two three

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,360
4 100

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,079
lies these are words from Ashley Foster

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
words that she is soon going to eat

84
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,200
because as I've said from the very

85
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,959
beginning what Ashley projects and tries

86
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,159
to accuse other people of being and

87
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,599
doing is usually what she herself is

88
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,159
guilty of being and

89
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:14,079
doing Ashley is the ring leader of an

90
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,959
organized anti-ed medium hateful group

91
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,959
that she created on a mountain of Lies

92
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,079
Ashley has been lying and attacking

93
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,000
Anthony for years and she has now

94
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,720
incited a group of people that are out

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,800
there attacking harassing and bullying

96
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,759
the medical medium community and even

97
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,720
going as far as to make videos of them

98
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,440
eles burning medical medium books okay

99
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,960
all these medical medium books are going

100
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,199
to be burned

101
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,199
today it's

102
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,280
happening this is going in first celery

103
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,720
juice

104
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,320
one I took out the insides because it's

105
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,080
going to take forever to burn why is

106
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,080
Ashley really doing this many have asked

107
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,160
in response to the activities of the

108
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,280
plotters one online commenter said it's

109
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,320
clear there are other motives behind all

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,560
this

111
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,280
a different commenter said it's just

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,960
full-on Reckless ruthless attacks that

113
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,360
seems like it doesn't have anything to

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,759
do with the realities nor facts of our

115
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,400
community just attacks simply to bring

116
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,199
us down utterly nonsensical and

117
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,960
infuriating and another commenter said

118
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,800
it's so clear that there's an agenda I

119
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
don't see why anyone would listen to all

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,680
their

121
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,440
n so what are Ashley's ulterior motives

122
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,560
what is this really about for her what

123
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,520
type of person is capable of harboring

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,800
so much hatred towards someone who does

125
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,720
nothing but help the chronically ill

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,120
even long after the madeup story they

127
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,160
tried to use to slander him was proven

128
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
to be

129
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,759
false what type of person could be so

130
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,199
painfully entitled and careless so as to

131
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,120
spend years plotting and obsessively

132
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,880
trying to bring Anthony and the entire

133
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,080
medical medium community of chronically

134
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,759
ill people who are already struggling

135
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,680
down

136
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,960
today we're going to be answering these

137
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,800
questions Ashley's true motives are

138
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,160
going to be exposed for the first time

139
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,039
we're going to be revealing some

140
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,960
shocking new facts that are wildly

141
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,199
inconsistent with Ashley's Proclamation

142
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:20,520
that she's doing this smear campaign

143
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,919
quote #for step to Zone and we're going

144
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,520
to begin exposing some of the many many

145
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,800
more lies that Ashley has told since the

146
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,520
release of our podcast episodes last

147
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,280
year you may recall that in our previous

148
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,599
episodes we played the following

149
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,039
recording of Taylor call and Robbie

150
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:40,400
Barbaro describing their friend and the

151
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,880
number one plotter Ashley

152
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,880
Foster and by the way Ash do need to

153
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,840
work Ash ever ever the woman is she

154
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,000
family money a lot of it you know

155
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,000
private jet and

156
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,879
plus Ashley has since responded to this

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,280
part of our podcasts somebody said to

158
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,160
her you are independently wealthy what

159
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,800
is the source of your family's wealth

160
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,199
I'm suspicious because of that and

161
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,039
Ashley

162
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:14,800
replied my dad grew up without shoes or

163
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:17,800
electricity his first job was knocking

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,720
the cement off off all Briggs for a

165
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,800
penny a brick he worked incredibly hard

166
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,520
harder than anyone else I have ever met

167
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,560
eventually he was able to buy one of the

168
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,319
houses he built for $700

169
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,080
he sold it later for a few thousand he

170
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,840
built another house by hand and sold

171
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,440
that by the time he died at 83 he had

172
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,240
been working in real estate for 60 years

173
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,240
he built and sold houses and eventually

174
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,520
apartment buildings he was able to leave

175
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,960
an amazing Legacy for our family I'm

176
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,199
incredibly proud of him and

177
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,280
grateful that said we don't own a plane

178
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,120
like they said in the podcast we aren't

179
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,080
able to spend money without thinking

180
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,080
about it we don't have vacation homes

181
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,319
like Anthony does we don't have the

182
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,280
ability to pay indefinitely for

183
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,759
aggressive lawyers like Anthony does

184
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,440
we're just able to live a comfortable

185
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,639
life where I can stay home with my kids

186
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,800
and homeschool them my husband works

187
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,560
incredibly hard there's nothing crazy

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,399
here we're just blessed and I'm really

189
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,000
really

190
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:36,640
grateful so Ashley's claiming

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,560
specifically that quote we don't have a

192
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,320
plane and quote we don't have vacation

193
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,839
homes she's trying to portray herself as

194
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,480
a victim of Anthony's lawyers saying

195
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,680
that she can't afford ongoing legal

196
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,360
representation of her own and she's

197
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,279
depicting herself as having a simple

198
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,040
humble life just to give you an idea of

199
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,920
how absurd these statements and

200
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,279
characterizations are I'm going to

201
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,800
reference some of the many news articles

202
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,040

using the following

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,200
Philips last week prosecutors said he

electronic monitor his house is so large

270
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,440
however that agents had to install three

271

monitoring stations where typically one

272
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,880

273
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,279
Jean did not end up being convicted

274
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
however news Outlet records and

275
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,000

276
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,680

277
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,880

the Dallas real estate conglomerate that

Moose's trouble at Pillar income Asset

311
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,040
Management arrived with a document he

312
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:45,480
had never seen it was a two-page

313
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,120
contract that said moose had signed his

314
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,959
2% stake in a $1.8 billion real estate

315
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,839
deal back to his employer the document

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,199
had Dallas real estate executive Jean

317
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,120
Phillips signature and his own but there

318
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:02,600
was one big problem moose said he had

319
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,399
never signed the contract the allegedly

320
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,279
forged contract was key evidence in a

321
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,000
trial where a jury recently awarded

322
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,920
moose more than $22 million in salary

323
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,680
and real estate compensation after he

324
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,160
sued his former

325
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,120
employer the plaintiff's petition calls

326
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,720
the document in which moose allegedly

327
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,440
signed over his rights to vaa the

328
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,199
doctored letter and says it was created

329
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,440
by taking the signature from a different

330
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,040
document and combining it with a new

331
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,440
cover page

332
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,399
It also says the document was altered by

333
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,920
a typewriter after the fact to reflect

334
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,759
that pillar was a third party to the

335
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,600
agreement with Phillips and moose the

336
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,600
pillar signature lines font differs from

337
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,720
the rest of the

338
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,920
document as it turns out it's an awfully

339
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,959
fragile glass mansion that Ashley is

340
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,759
trying to throw stones from can we play

341
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,279
that last audio

342
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,160
again and by the way Ash didn't need to

343
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:04,720
work Ash

344
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:09,000
ever ever the woman is she family money

345
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,360
a lot of it you know private jet and

346
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,720
plus Ashley's closest friends said that

347
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,639
she doesn't have to work and that she

348
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,720
has a lot of family money like private

349
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:23,199
jet

350
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,320
plus and then Ashley denied their claims

351
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,320
after the podcast came

352
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:33,000
out that said we don't own a plane like

353
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,839
they said in the podcast we aren't able

354
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,440
to spend money without thinking about it

355
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,040
we don't have vacation homes like

356
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,040
Anthony

357
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,279
does this part is hilarious because

358
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,160
Ashley has always been an aspiring

359
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,639
writer and she had written a piece about

360
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,360
her own life years ago she sent it to

361
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,600
multiple people who have since submitted

362
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,480
evidence to us in this piece in

363
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,399
reference to her family Ashley had said

364
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,399

00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:05,240

Colorado is an 80 acre property worth

$10

million Ashley's previous home in

382
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,560
California sold for $73 million and we

383
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,319
know people who have visited multiple

384
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,319
different properties of Ashley's in

385
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:03,799
different places around the country some

386
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:06,439
of which are worth close to $13

387
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,559
million once in the process of trying to

388
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,839
purchase a property Ashley had sent a

389
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:15,439
text to a friend that says the

390
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,839
following our first loan didn't close 2

391
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,000
days before closing the board of the

392
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,160
bank had approved the loan when our

393
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,679
broker got a random call they were

394
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,679
cancelling

395
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,120
it the friend asked was your dad a

396
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:35,600
backer and Ashley

397
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,960
replied I was in tears and so confused

398
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,160
and he was so pissed off and

399
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:45,120
Confused my dad looks at the paperwork

400
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:48,160
and goes oh this Bank never would have

401
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:54,200
made you alone I sued them for $70

402
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,200
million last year # thanks

403
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:02,919
Dad the friend said holy LOL

404
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,919
so Ashley's dad a late billionaire had

405
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:08,840
sued a bank for $70

406
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,960
million but Ashley wants you to believe

407
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,559
that she can't afford a lawyer and that

408
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,720
she is somehow a victim of Anthony's

409
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,320
legal representation because she has

410
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,559
simply been notified that she is

411
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,360
repeatedly spreading verifiably false

412
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,320
information about Anthony and about

413
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,440
medical medium information and she

414
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,840
continues to ignore the facts that have

415
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,200
been presented to her in a different

416
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,880
text Ashley wrote

417
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,679
this we bought an apartment building in

418
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,039
Texas with the help of my

419
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:42,799
dad Ashley and her husband bought an

420
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:46,520
apartment building with the help of her

421
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:50,039
dad a lot of people rent apartments not

422
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,360
many people can buy apartment buildings

423
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,880
as investment

424
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,840
properties and we have another text from

425
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,919
Ashley to a

426
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:03,039
friend a lot of huge huge things going

427
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:06,760
on over here 100 plus million doll deals

428
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,120
Etc it's a lot to get my mind around and

429
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,600
I feel easily overwhelmed if I don't

430
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,520
just focus on listening for what God has

431
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,280
for

432
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,400
me so she's involved with a 100 plus

433
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,720
million doll

434
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,960
deals 100 plus million dollar deals but

435
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,159
remember everybody Ashley just lives a

436
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,520
simple humble life she can't even afford

437
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,480
legal representation and again she's the

438
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,679
victim when she gets called out for the

439
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,039
falsities that she originated and took

440
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,320
to the media with the expressed intent

441
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,320
of harming Anthony and the

442
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:47,000
community um oh my

443
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:52,280
um yeah we're hopeful that once the

444
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,480
article's out um one of the directors or

445
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,679
producers that Britain works with

446
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,360
will uh you know become interested in

447
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,640
telling the story really well I think

448
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,480
it's going to take that because Anthony

449
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,480
is so um he has such a presence and if

450
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,919
it just stops at the article I'm

451
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,080
guessing that like there would be some

452
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,200
buzz in the medical medium Community for

453
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,360
a few months but like really I think

454
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,159
then it would kind of die down

455
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,720
ultimately the

456
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,919
way to really get the word out is like

457
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,960
would be like a Netflix documentary you

458
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,760
know

459
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,679
so um once you hit that level of like

460
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,720
being exposed there's kind of no there's

461
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,720
no coming back from

462
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:41,440
that there's kind of no coming back from

463
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,960
that that's what Ashley wants for

464
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Anthony and let me be clear that nobody

465
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,559
over here cares if Ashley has money or

466
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,600
not that's not the problem it's the fact

467
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,640
that she's being ridiculously dishonest

468
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,919
about it and even publicly rebutting

469
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,960
with her own close friends who know her

470
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,480
situation personally said about her

471
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,480
wealth at the same time as Ashley's

472
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,880
trying to convince everyone that she's

473
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,039
so perfectly honest and morally

474
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,120
Superior the truth is that Ashley will

475
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,039
throw anybody under the bus even her own

476
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,600
friends who threaten The Masks she's

477
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,159
wearing as she's trying to portray

478
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,600
herself to be an everyday innocent Mommy

479
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:17,840
so that people are more likely to

480
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,960
believe her

481
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,559
lies Ashley's misrepresenting herself

482
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,919
just like she's misrepresented the

483
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,159
entire Stephanie story and just like she

484
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,559
continues to misrepresent Medical medium

485
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:31,240
information with every lie and every

486
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:34,760
falsity she's out there

487
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,480
pedling here is again Ashley's response

488
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,760
to what Taylor and Robbie said about

489
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,360
her that said we don't own a plane like

490
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,640
they said in the

491
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,600
podcast they don't own a plane hm maybe

492
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,919
Ashley doesn't have a plane but her

493
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,400
family does or at least they did there's

494
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,520
obviously a reason why Robbie and Taylor

495
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,400
said what they did and Ashley's being

496
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,880
dishonest again just a minute ago you

497
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,080
heard what we read from Ashley from

498
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,600
another time in which she said

499
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:11,039
explicitly that her family has homes and

500
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,520
cars and planes all over the globe if

501
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,039
that wasn't enough there's also an

502
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,840
article on businesswire.com from 2017

503
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:20,240
about Ashley's father that

504
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,760
reads Dallas real estate entrepreneur

505
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,640
and philanthropist Jean e Phillips

506
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,760
offered his private plane for a

507
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,960
humanitarian flight to St Thomas and the

508
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,960
US Virgin Islands last

509
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:37,880
week her father offered up his plane not

510
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,919
a plane his plane there are also

511
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,720
multiple currently public posts on

512
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,200
Ashley's mother's Instagram account in

513
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,840
which the family can be seen on a

514
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,840
private jet like in this

515
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:55,120
video Ming with the

516
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,120
dogs look at those dogs trying to bite

517
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,120
me

518
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,360
crazy dogs

519
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
right

520
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,360
more you wants to do it

521
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,079
[Music]

522
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,679
again if you're listening to the podcast

523
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,880
version of this episode what you just

524
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,840
heard is the sound to a video of

525
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Ashley's family on a private jet that

526
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,600
seems to be on its way to the location

527
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,279
tagged of CIO Hawaii it appears as

528
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,159
though Ashley's mother is recording the

529
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,200
video while Ashley's dad is holding

530
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,760
Ashley's daughter on his lap as he's

531
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,679
showing her something on his phone and

532
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:52,200
Ashley herself is in plain view talking

533
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:55,320
to someone behind him on the private jet

534
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:59,520
it was posted on June 25th of 2019 with

535
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,880
the caption quot memories Priceless as

536
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,159
if from a trip they had taken in

537
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,080
previous years it gets even crazier

538
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:11,400
there are two posts one from July 7th of

539
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:13,320
2018 and one from July 15th of 2018 with

540
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,480
photos of Ashley's kids on a private

541
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,480
plane with Ashley's dad the July 7th

542
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,000
2018 post is captioned quote we are

543
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,120
headed to

544
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,880
Pennsylvania this was four months before

545
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,279
Stephanie passed away and Pennsylvania

546
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,520
is where Stephanie lived

547
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,520
Ashley's family took the private jet

548
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,799
that Ashley's now claiming that they

549
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,760
don't have or have access to to the very

550
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:43,640
state in which Stephanie lived just four

551
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:47,840
months before Stephanie died and

552
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:50,919
yet Ashley did not visit Stephanie once

553
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,200
during the entire time she was sick we

554
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:59,200
know this because in a blog post Ashley

555
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,200
wrote on March 7th of 2020 she said this

556
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,120
Steph went back home after a few months

557
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,960
and a relationship turned into texts and

558
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,880
occasional phone calls she was the kind

559
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,000
of friend I didn't talk to every day but

560
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,480
I never worried about it because I knew

561
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,039
the second I saw her again it would be

562
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,200
like we hadn't missed a day

563
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,200
unfortunately I wouldn't have that

564
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,360
chance here Ashley is referring to a

565
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,919
Time when Stephanie stayed with her in

566
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,039
2016 Ashley is saying in this post that

567
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,399
she never saw Stephanie again after that

568
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:45,480
time Stephanie passed away on November

569
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:48,600
13th of 2018 over two years later in an

570
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,559
Instagram post from March 6th of 2020

571
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,960
Ashley said something similar Steph went

572
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,679
back home to Pennsylvania a few months

573
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,320
later and a relationship turned into

574
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,200
texts and occasional calls she was the

575
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,039
kind of friend I didn't talk to every

576
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,360
day but who I knew I would never miss a

577
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,480
beat with the second I saw her again

578
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,640
unfortunately I never

579
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,120
would Ashley saying she would never get

580
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,039
the chance as if Stephanie had died

581
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,720
right after that but Ashley had over two

582
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:24,520
years of a

583
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,440
chance for someone who claims to have

584
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,039
cared so much about Stephanie that

585
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,279
Stephanie is the reason why she is so

586
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,600
determined to blatantly harm Anthony and

587
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,159
the medical medium Community it seems

588
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,840
just a little strange that Ashley did

589
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,120
not visit Stephanie once while Stephanie

590
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,279
was sick for 2 years Ashley clearly has

591
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,159
the means her family according to her

592
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:50,720
own words has quote cars and planes and

593
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,760
houses all over the globe and Ashley

594
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,880
appears to even have been on one of said

595
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,880
private planes with her family to

596
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,120
Pennsylvania just a few months before

597
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,679
Stephanie died in Pennsylvania and yet

598
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,600
Ashley still did not visit her instead

599
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,559
during that time that Stephanie was sick

600
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,520
Ashley was traveling to run Retreats

601
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:15,120
with her friends here is a text that

602
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,559
co-plot Taylor call had sent to a friend

603
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,559
on November 6th of

604
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,039
2018 I'm good just now back from

605
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,919
California the retreat was wonderful but

606
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:31,960
loads of work gret and was sick and in

607
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,240
the hospital the whole time so it was me

608
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Ash and Mel full

609
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:42,080
on that text was sent just seven days

610
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,720
before Stephanie passed away so for over

611
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,159
two years despite Ashley taking multiple

612
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,519
trips despite her having the time to run

613
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,919
Retreats despite the family using a

614
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,039
private jet to visit Pennsylvania where

615
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,919
Stephanie lived all while Stephanie was

616
00:27:54,039 --> 00:28:00,080
sick Ashley didn't visit Stephanie once

617
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,200
in instead Ashley was using that time

618
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,320
trying to become something in the health

619
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,600
industry using the medical medium name

620
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,519
in Ashley's blog post from 2020 where

621
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,039
she began pedaling her original false

622
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,559
storyline about what happened with

623
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:19,679
Stephanie she told a massive additional

624
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:22,279
falsity I have absolutely no agenda I

625
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:26,240
don't make money off clients or my

626
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:28,159
Instagram I intentionally never have and

627
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,799
the reason for that is because of how

628
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,320
how highly I value the truth I know it's

629
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,320
hard to trust people in the current

630
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,679
climate of social media and no one is

631
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,799
perfect but I want you guys to be able

632
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:42,799
to trust me as much as you choose

633
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,720
to As Nice And as trusting as that might

634
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:51,399
sound it's far from the truth and it's

635
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,159
incredibly manipulative Ashley clearly

636
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:55,640
had an agenda all along and Ashley has

637
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,200
very much made money off of her

638
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,519
Instagram or at least she's tried to and

639
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,799
she had every intention to do so I'm

640
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,880
going to go through some examples first

641
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,559
of all Ashley once had a platform on

642
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,200
Instagram of around 20,000 followers she

643
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,640
had this platform mostly because the

644
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,320
medical medium account was reposting her

645
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,039
and that's largely how her account grew

646
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,960
to what it was at the time Ashley then

647
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:19,679
used that platform built from the

648
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,679
medical medium Community to sell a

649
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,919
myriad of different digital products and

650
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,320
inperson

651
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,320
events one type of digital product

652
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,200
Ashley made money from was her ebooks

653
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,279
that she marketed on her Instagram

654
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,519
account there were three different

655
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,080
ebooks and we have receipts that were

656
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,760

657
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,480

2020 two of them were $7 each for PDF

660
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:49,640
copies and $15 each for hard copies and

661
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:54,760
one of them was $20 for a PDF copy and

662
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:56,720
$25 for a hard copy in 2018 through 2020

663
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,080
Ashley was promoting her offerings a lot

664
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,120
on social media Ashley shared

665
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,159
screenshots directly on her Instagram

666
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,000
stories that customers had taken of

667
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:07,679
their receipts from purchasing Ashley's

668
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,600
ebooks at the time of course Ashley

669
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,519
would share these receipts to try to

670
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,159

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,399
felt like it was still the right thing

743
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,639
to do to launch and start selling her

744
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,440
next ebook anyway Ashley is the daughter

745
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:43,760
of a billionaire it's not like she

746
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,760
needed the money she had no publisher

747
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,679
and no deadline this was an ebook Ashley

748
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,960
self-published she had the freedom to

749
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,600
release it at any time of her choosing

750
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,039
and she decided that the day after

751
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,840
Stephanie died was the right time and

752
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,720
then in the caption of the promotional

753
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,360
host Ashley said

754
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,519
this I could use your help getting the

755
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,440
word out about this little book I just

756
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,560
didn't have the energy to do the

757
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:15,480
giveaways and the hype stuff to build

758
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,480
momentum for it but that's the way life

759
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,560
goes Ashley offered to donate some of

760
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:23,119
the proceeds of her book sales to relief

761
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,480
efforts for the Wy fires that were going

762
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,359
on and affecting Ashley personally at

763
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,760
the time but not all of the proceeds and

764
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:31,919
again Ashley is the daughter of a

765
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,560
billionaire she doesn't need sales from

766
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,639
the medical medium Community to donate

767
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:40,599
to a cause what a bizarre time to try to

768
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,800
make money not even 24 hours after

769
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,760
Stephanie died that's the kind of thing

770
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,720
you do when you don't care about the

771
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:52,000
person who died but to each their

772
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,599
own so not only did Ashley lie about

773
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,839
never making money or trying to make

774
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,320
money off of her Instagram clearly she

775
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,200
did but Ashley even tried to make money

776
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,200
off of her Instagram the very next day

777
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,000
after Stephanie passed away and Ashley

778
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,560
was not only making money on Instagram

779
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
with her ebooks but she was also trying

780
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,119
desperately to make a name and a brand

781
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,240
for herself Ashley used the name of her

782
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,200
weight loss ebook and made a separate

783
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,280
Instagram account for it she did

784
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,400
Instagram lives promoting it she made a

785
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,720
Facebook group for it she created an

786
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,520
Instagram hashtag for it and she used

787
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,000
the hashtag in a bunch of her posts and

788
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,400
encouraged other people to use the

789
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,200
hashtag too

790
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,839
and Ashley wanted to do a retreat in

791
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,320
2020 centered around this brand she

792
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:37,640
created one Instagram post she had made

793
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,800
a few years ago said

794
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:44,520
this I'm over here dreaming up holding

795
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,720
some Retreats this year based on my meal

796
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:50,400
plan Ashley also participated in a vegan

797
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,880
bundle with one of her ebooks another

798
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,960
Avenue of Ashley making money off of her

799
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,560
Instagram we have a receipt that was

800
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,079
submitted to us from someone who

801
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,599
purchased the bundle without Ashley's

802
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,760
ebook in it for $50 from Ashley on

803
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,960
February 7th of 2020 which was just 4

804
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,040
days before Ashley started coming out

805
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,079
against medical medium and publicly

806
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,880
spreading false stories about

807
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,760
Stephanie think about this Ashley was

808
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,760
making money off of the medical medium

809
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,680
community Through Instagram 4 days

810
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,920
before coming out with her false

811
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,720
story for anyone who doesn't know how

812
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,760
bundle companies work I'll give you an

813
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,599
example I was asked to be an affiliate

814
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,119
for a bundle company multiple times over

815
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,800
the past year I chose not to participate

816
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,119
but I was sent all of the information

817
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,520
about how the commission structure works

818
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,200
the vegan bundle that Ashley

819
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,000
participated in was a different type of

820
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,720
bundle than the one I was asked to be a

821
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,160
part of but the structure for all of

822
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,240
them is very similar so I'm going to

823
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,839
read off parts of the pitch that I

824
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,400
received to give you a peek into how

825
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,560
much money Ashley could have made from

826
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,680
being a digital product contributor in

827
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,720
the vegan bundle and selling and

828
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,240
marketing it directly from her Instagram

829
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,560
account the pitch I received ceed said

830
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,920
this in short we have over 100 creators

831
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,079
come together and each ad their book or

832
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,359
course as an affiliate you would make

833
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,800
$19 per bundle you sell I sold 800

834
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,200
bundles our last

835
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,040
launch in the bundle companies Creator

836
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,520
section of their website participating

837
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,079
in the bundle is marketed to have the

838
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:24,200
following benefits it says why should I

839
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:27,599
join one high earnings two huge exposure

840
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,800
three followers love it and then in the

841
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,839
the commission breakdown section it says

842
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,720
if you contribute with one or several of

843
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,000
your digital products in the bundle you

844
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,760
get 70% Commission of the net profit

845
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,640
which is $33 per bundle sold as somebody

846
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,599
contributing an ebook Ashley could have

847
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,960
gotten a similar commission making

848
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:49,480
around $33 per bundle she sold through

849
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,160
promoting it on her Instagram the person

850
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,599
who reached out to me with this proposal

851
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,760
said that they sold 800 bundles during

852
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,720
one 10day launch as an example so just

853
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,960
to piece all this together for everyone

854
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,560
if Ashley with her 20,000 followers at

855
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,400
the time would have sold even half of

856
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,920
the example amount that I was given for

857
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,599
a similar bundle and therefore made 400

858
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,400
sales at $33 commission per bundle sold

859
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,920
Ashley would have made

860
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,440
$13,200 in 10

861
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,119
days and again all of this is done

862
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,920
through marketing the bundles on

863
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,520
Instagram meaning that Ashley in fact

864
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,960
made money or tried to make money off of

865
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,280
her Instagram

866
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,640
once again Ashley misled

867
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,319
people we not only have proof that

868
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,760
Ashley did in fact make money or try to

869
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:40,359
make money off of her Instagram but we

870
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,800
also have proof that she got new

871
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,400
customers and likely made more money

872
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,880
after she started pedaling her false

873
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,240
storyline about

874
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,280
Stephanie here's a comment somebody made

875
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,720
to Ashley on Instagram on February 11th

876
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,640
of 2020 it says hi Ash I had no idea who

877
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,839
you were until today when your post

878
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,760
about your dear friend started

879
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,040
circulating social media first I'm so

880
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,240
sorry for the losses that you've

881
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,880
experienced and I'm hopeful that by

882
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,920
sharing this that it will help those of

883
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,599
us who follow Anthony make those hard

884
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,960
decisions about the intersection of

885
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,560
holistic wellness and life-saving modern

886
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,560
medicine so many of us have been so sick

887
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,560
for so long and we are vulnerable to a

888
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,960
message of healing even if it's tainted

889
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,839
or imperfect in some way thank you for

890
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,680
sharing your truth I think it's so

891
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:26,880
important to not follow anything or

892
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,280
anyone blindly although so many have

893
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,200
experienced healing with Anthony and I

894
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,640
was super excited to order all of your

895
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:37,640
books sending you lots of

896
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:40,640
love to begin with that person believed

897
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,400
I did what Ashley said I did Ashley

898
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,160
created a false story and that person

899
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,880
believed it and now that person believes

900
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,040
Ashley is doing a justifiable action

901
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,160
most likely that person will never hear

902
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:57,680
the truth and they're probably just gone

903
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,240
they left thinking that I hurt somebody

904
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,480
second she purchased all of Ashley's

905
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,800
books so Ashley made money selling books

906
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,599
on a platform that was built off of

907
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,880
medical medium and then at the same time

908
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:16,079
using a false story to do so in that

909
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,440
instance oh yeah and Ashley claimed that

910
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,359
she never made money on her Instagram

911
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,520
and here it is little old honest Ashley

912
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,480
once again being

913
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,160
dishonest even better than that Ashley's

914
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,319
ebooks are still still available for

915
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,920
purchase to this day multiple people

916
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:35,040
submitted receipts to us from their

917
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,960
purchases of Ashley's ebooks in December

918
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,760
of

919
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,000
2023 and Ashley wanted to make a whole

920
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,800
lot more money off of the medical medium

921
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,200
community Through many different Avenues

922
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,960
this was what she wanted one

923
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:52,000
money-making Avenue was through running

924
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,839
big Retreats first in 2016 Ashley began

925
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,040
by sending an email to let Anthony and

926
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,400
his wife know that she wanted to host a

927
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,200
retreat in Santa Monica California and

928
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,240
she asked them if they would give her

929
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,040
and her Retreat a shout out then later

930
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,760
on in 2016 Ashley submitted a business

931
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,760
proposal to Anthony Ashley wanted to do

932
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,520
medical medium Retreats with Anthony

933
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,760
using the medical medium name in the

934
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,400
summer of

935
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,839
2017 in the business proposal which I

936
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,400
have in front of me Ashley included a

937
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,160
cost analysis and financial forecast for

938
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,440
150 attendees with a cost of attendance

939
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,480
of $33,000 per person and a total

940
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,480
Revenue amount of

941
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:36,440
$450,000 it's worth noting that in this

942
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,920
2016 business proposal Ashley listed

943
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,319
Robbie Barbaro on the retreat itinerary

944
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,520
as someone who would have been teaching

945
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:46,040
classes at the medical medium Retreat

946
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,240
that she wanted to run and profit from

947
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,160
Ashley also stated in her business

948
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,960
proposal that quote by looking ahead to

949
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:57,359
2018 the quote event could grow up to

950
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,760
250 people if desired this shows was

951
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,480
that Ashley's desire was to do medical

952
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,280
medium Retreats for years to come and to

953
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,640
make even more money with more people at

954
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,760
$3,000 per person with 250 people like

955
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,079
Ashley desired the revenue would have

956
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,079
been

957
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:20,680
$750,000 and then came a pivotal moment

958
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,960
in history Anthony turned it all down

959
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,640
and said no to Ashley's big Retreat

960
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,440
proposal I've always felt Ashley was not

961
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,240
looking out for the community and The

962
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,960
Chronic ill so much she was more into

963
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,359
what can Ashley get out of this and that

964
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,240
concerned

965
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,440
me Ashley got turned down and then

966
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,720
Ashley still had Her Mind Set On Doing

967
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,000
Retreats so she went forward with trying

968
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,280
to do them on her own we have a

969
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
screenshot from Ashley's old website in

970
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,160
which she had a spot she was using to

971
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,599
Market upcoming Retreats under upcoming

972
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,520
events it says summer Retreat 2017 check

973
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,319
back for more information

974
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,160
soon Ashley was trying to Market her own

975
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:06,040
retreat but it seems as though this

976
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,720
Retreat never ended up taking place

977
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,880
however Ashley still kept trying to move

978
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,880
forward to make her big Retreat business

979
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:17,400
plans happen here is the text Ashley

980
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,400
sent to someone on April 29th of

981
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:23,520
2018 would be fun to buy a small house

982
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,520
there and just set it up to do Retreats

983
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,280
let comfy bunk beds in each room and

984
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:33,000
make it hold 10 to 12 people and then I

985
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:37,280
could fly into lead Retreats once a

986
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,720
month and make like 30 grand house would

987
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,720
pay for

988
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,119
itself and here is another text she sent

989
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,920
to the same person 3 days

990
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:50,640
later it would make even more sense for

991
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:55,240
me to just do like a full month of

992
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:59,240
Retreats twice a year and bring in

993
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:02,079
240k less with cost of course how much

994
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:05,079
cashh do I need in the bank do you think

995
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,559
to get a loan on these houses I'd want

996
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:10,160
to do it without my

997
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:13,800
trust she's the daughter of a

998
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,680
billionaire family she has a trust fund

999
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,079
and she was trying to use medical medium

1000
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,839
to make it big in the health industry

1001
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,400
and she didn't want to dip into her

1002
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:26,280
trust and I can promise you this her

1003
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,079
trust fund doesn't just have $220,000 in

1004
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,440
it

1005
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,520
I'm sure it

1006
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,400
doesn't we've got the daughter of a

1007
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,200
billionaire with a trust fund who's

1008
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,359
trying to act like she can't even afford

1009
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,319
a lawyer but she does have a lawyer by

1010
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,800
the way everybody should know that and

1011
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:43,240
she was trying to do medical medium

1012
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,400
Retreats so that she could make

1013
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,200
$240,000 a year from the chronically ill

1014
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,000
only have to show up for two months out

1015
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,680
of the year and she didn't want to dip

1016
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,880
into her trust fund

1017
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,119
amazing next I'm going to play voice

1018
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,359
text that Ashley sent to Anthony around

1019
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,800
that same time in 2018 asking him again

1020
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:05,480
about doing Retreats note that we are

1021
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,520
redacting the name of her child for

1022
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,200
privacy as you'll hear in the audios the

1023
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,280
Retreats were her and her friend's ideas

1024
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,280
Ashley reached out multiple times over

1025
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,400
the course of 17 days trying to get me

1026
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,200
on the phone trying to get me involved

1027
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,960
and still trying to use the medical

1028
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,359
medium name on them and get me to

1029
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,160
promote them and I was not interested

1030
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:30,760
and told her no this was many months

1031
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,640
after Stephanie was diagnosed with

1032
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,200
cancer and Ashley was trying to do

1033
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,200
business with

1034
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:39,520
me hey it's Ash I

1035
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,880
know sorry got too

1036
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,599
bigle it's okay Budd um okay I know you

1037
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,040
talked to gret about this that she and I

1038
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:54,760
are trying to get some Retreat stuff

1039
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,520
going and she's doing one in Hawaii that

1040
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,319
I'm going to help her do the food for

1041
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:03,160
which will be really fun but we've also

1042
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:05,040
been talking about this main idea and um

1043
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,920
we're getting a proposal from them to do

1044
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,400
a retreat for a smaller group like you

1045
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,880
and I talked about of about 30 people

1046
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,960
this coming September and I just wanted

1047
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,119
to get a feel from you because I wasn't

1048
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,640
sure I kind of felt like you weren't

1049
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,640
really wanting to be involved in that

1050
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,440
which is totally fine I just wanted to

1051
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,720
make sure before we go ahead and see

1052
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,599
like is that something that you would

1053
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,559
want to do through medical medium at all

1054
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,680
and um if not we're going to just Market

1055
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:35,160
it as like a family Retreat where like

1056
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,160
the food happens to follow medical

1057
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,359
medium healing um guidelines and you

1058
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,280
know we'll be we'll run all our

1059
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,000
marketing by you guys just to make sure

1060
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,760
it's like on the up and up but um it

1061
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,800
wouldn't be like we would make sure to

1062
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,839
make it clear it's not like affiliated

1063
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,599
with medical medium so that's kind of

1064
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,280
what I'm thinking because I sort of got

1065
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,280
the vibe of like you're not sure about

1066
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,800
that yet but correct me if I'm wrong

1067
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,079
okay if you guys would like to

1068
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,040
be like have medical medium be the SP of

1069
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,839
something like that the idea I mean the

1070
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:09,480
retreat is just on a beautiful Retreat

1071
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:11,960
facility and there's hiking and beaches

1072
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,760
and a lake and we're not going to plan

1073
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,319
like too much for people it's mostly

1074
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,319
about you know a chance to get together

1075
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:21,119
with other people and all the food you

1076
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:23,520
know have the food done for you and just

1077
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,960
to rest and maybe there'll be like a

1078
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,359
cooking demo and some like guided

1079
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,559
meditations or something something like

1080
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,440
that but nothing nothing super

1081
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:35,200
structured nothing real um formal it'll

1082
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:39,280
just be an opportunity for people to

1083
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,280
come take advantage of the

1084
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,839
location all I have to say just let me

1085
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:47,200
know if it's something you guys did do

1086
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:50,520
end up feeling like you want to be more

1087
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,880
through the mm Banner or if you're if

1088
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,880
you'd rather us just kind of Take the

1089
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,319
Lead and run with it and like I said

1090
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,000
we'll be well you know you know I'll

1091
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:01,599
check with you in case to make sure all

1092
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,720
our marketing is really clear in that

1093
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,240
case that it's not through you guys and

1094
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,720
and we won't we'll be careful with the

1095
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,720
wording and

1096
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,319
everything that first audio was sent on

1097
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:18,520
April 27th in 2018 Ashley did not get a

1098
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:21,240
response from Anthony and then Ashley

1099
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,480
sent another one nudging him further on

1100
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,079

don't know where you are

1103
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,839
um this is the week we have to make a

1104
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,760
decision about the main Retreat we got a

1105
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:41,599
proposal back from Catherine at Point

1106
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:43,400
Lookout it suggests a cost of about

1107
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,520
41,000

1108
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,799
and that's with an estimate of 30 people

1109
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,880
30 adults and 10 children so the cost

1110
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:53,200
per person comes down to a little like

1111
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,160
around

1112
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,119
$1,100 per

1113
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,520
person so

1114
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:02,960
I think it has the potential to be a

1115
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:05,599
pretty good little test trial you know

1116
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,160
if we are thinking of a retreat cost of

1117
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,799
around

1118
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,119
$3,000

1119
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:13,520
um and it's really cool because if it

1120
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:17,480
did work next year we could do the same

1121
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,960
thing for 150 people and all of a sudden

1122
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,319
then it would really be generating some

1123
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,280
income let me know your thoughts it's

1124
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:25,400
obviously no pressure but we just are

1125
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,640
going to have to make some decisions

1126
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,359
about it this week so so um any insight

1127
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,440
into what you're thinking and whether

1128
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:37,960
you guys would want to be involved would

1129
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,960
be awesome okay love you

1130
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,760
bye Ashley's saying here that the

1131
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:47,559
retreat she had been planning would just

1132
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,520
be a test trial she said that she wants

1133
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:53,760
to charge people $3,000 for the retreat

1134
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:56,160
and ultimately at some point host 150

1135
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,359
people which if you do the math would

1136
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:02,520
bring in almost half a million dollar

1137
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:05,559
half a million dollar for one

1138
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:08,880
Retreat Anthony how did you respond to

1139
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:10,480
this prodding from Ashley I turned her

1140
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,440
down

1141
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,520
again right and then after you turned

1142
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,799
her down Ashley still tried to pursue

1143
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,440
doing Retreats on her own to whomever

1144
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:22,839
she could sell them to Ashley did end up

1145
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,000
posting a retreat later on with now co-

1146
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:28,000
plotters Taylor and Gretchen and they

1147
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,280
had a total of 12 attendees

1148
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,760
I'm sure that 12 attendees made Ashley a

1149
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:36,160
lot less money than the 150 to 250

1150
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,000
attendees that Ashley was hoping to get

1151
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,559
from doing Retreats with Anthony using

1152
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,760
his name and

1153
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:44,400
likeness Ashley's retreat with Taylor

1154
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:48,160
and Gretchen took place in aahu Hawaii

1155
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,680
from October 15th through the 21st in

1156
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,720
2018 this Retreat ended just three and a

1157
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,000
half weeks before Stephanie passed away

1158
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,880
in the marketing that was done to

1159
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,599
promoted on Instagram the details of the

1160
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,920
retreat included quote all organic

1161
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,960
plant-based grain-free meals in line

1162
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,680
with the medical medium protocol and

1163
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:10,720
quote cooking classes led by

1164
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,559
Ashley so again Ashley was too busy to

1165
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,319
visit Stephanie once while she was sick

1166
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,799
but she certainly wasn't too busy to

1167
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:19,280
travel from where she was living in

1168
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:21,000
California to Hawaii and run Retreats

1169
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,119
using medical medium

1170
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,640
information and then even over a year

1171
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:28,480
after Stephanie passed away Ashley was

1172
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,720
still trying to run medical medium

1173
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,400
Retreats Ashley ended up trying to sell

1174
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,240
a retreat that she would have hosted

1175
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,599
along with Gretchen in

1176
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,760
2020 initially The Retreat dates were

1177
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:42,760
going to be August 31st to September 5th

1178
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,480
of 2020 initially Ashley had said that

1179
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,880
she wanted to add a second week to that

1180
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,440
but then she changed her mind Ashley

1181
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,440
marketed this Retreat all over her

1182
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,599
Instagram in early 2020 just literal

1183
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,079
weeks before she came out with her false

1184
00:51:54,599 --> 00:52:00,079
Stephanie story in one Instagram post

1185
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,000
Ashley started describing the retreat by

1186
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,200
saying

1187
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,720
this cost is

1188
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:12,200
$3,800 for the week all meals daily

1189
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,200
hiking and yoga and celery juice

1190
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:17,559
included in that same Instagram story

1191
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:20,000
post Ashley included a blurry photo of

1192
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:22,160
random people swimming in the ocean she

1193
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,599
Drew an arrow pointing to two of them

1194
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,520
and said

1195
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:30,839
this I recognize that these are random

1196
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,839
some people but this could be you and

1197
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:38,880
me in the next Instagram story Ashley

1198
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:41,760
said this I know it's expensive but if

1199
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:46,240
you find a Budd and save $10 a day

1200
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,240
between now and then you can both

1201
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,160
come Ashley then did a series of

1202
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,280
promotional Instagram stories for the

1203
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:58,599

1208
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,839
with one option being yes and the other

1209
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,920
option being yes also next to a photo of

1210
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:18,280
an outdoor table overlooking the beach

1211
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,480
then Ashley posted a very blurry photo

1212
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:25,200
of a bed and said

1213
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:28,440

after I fill up

1222
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:54,480
Hawaii so Ashley planned to continue on

1223
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,119
doing Retreats and making money Ashley

1224
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,160

00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,400
2020 one was for marketing her Retreat

1227
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:05,359
and the other was for marketing one of

1228
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,920
her ebooks in addition to those Retreats

1229
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:10,079

storefront she linked products like VI's

1241
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:38,799
barleygrass juice powder which Ashley

1242
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,680
described by saying

1243
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:44,960
this one of the supplements I take every

1244
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,119
single day I filed it under Beauty

1245
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,240
because it has helped my hair grow in so

1246
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,240
thick and

1247
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,040
shiny Ashley had plenty of plans for

1248
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,119
making money off of the medical medium

1249
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,200
community Through many other avenues as

1250
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:59,880
well

1251
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,040
in 2016 Ashley submitted a proposal to

1252
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,920
Anthony's wife in which Ashley offered

1253
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,720
to invest in getting a YouTube channel

1254
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,000
going for medical medium Ashley proposed

1255
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,720
doing a 5050 Revenue split Ashley wanted

1256
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,680
50% of all of the medical medium YouTube

1257
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,319
earnings this is something that never

1258
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,119
ended up panning out and so just so

1259
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:22,480
everyone is clear to this day I do not

1260
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:25,480
accept money from YouTube this was

1261
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,760
Ashley calculating and planning some

1262
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,400
kind of financial Endeavor that she

1263
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,640
wanted to do with me that wasn't about

1264
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,520
money going back into the community with

1265
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:38,599
more free resources instead it was

1266
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,039
Ashley hoping to make money for herself

1267
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:43,079
classic

1268
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:45,400
Ashley we also have texts that Ashley

1269
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:50,400
sent to a health practitioner friend on

1270
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:53,680
November 7th of 2017 they said

1271
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:56,920
this what if we did an ebook

1272
00:55:53,680 --> 00:56:00,119
specifically for the postpartum period

1273
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,870
and if we kept it short and sweet we

1274
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:04,720
could release it for like $10 or

1275
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:08,119
[Music]

1276
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,480
something we could possibly talk to an

1277
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:13,119
and rage and see if they want to do it

1278
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,760
through medical medium like we could

1279
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,760
design the whole thing but they could

1280
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:21,039
release it as an MMA ebook or something

1281
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,000
so much more reach that

1282
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,680
way again this was taking place during

1283
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,039
the time that Stephanie was sick instead

1284
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,240
of visiting Stephanie Ashley was using

1285
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:33,000
that time trying to become something in

1286
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:36,079
the health industry using the medical

1287
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:40,319
medium name another text she sent to the

1288
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:44,240
same friend on March 27th of 2018

1289
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:47,079
reads I know I wrote a whole book last

1290
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:52,440
year and then realized I had to do a

1291
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:52,440
proposal and still haven't started

1292
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:59,760
lol on May 15th of 2018 the friend asked

1293
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,559
when is your ebook launch so exciting

1294
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:05,520
and Ashley

1295
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:08,839
replied hm probably in another two weeks

1296
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:11,559
or so I know so much exciting stuff

1297
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:14,799
these days I'm cooking for Gretchen's

1298
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:17,599
retreat in October I decided to host the

1299
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:20,920
one-day cooking class of my very own

1300
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:23,960
this August and the

1301
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:26,720
ebook I'm talking to an agent today

1302
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:31,000
about doing my own cookbook we're

1303
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:33,400
remodeling the playroom and the yard my

1304
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,640
head is

1305
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,599
spinning around this time Ashley had

1306
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,280
asked me to co-author a medical medium

1307
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:42,720
recipe book with her and I said no and

1308
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,319
turned her

1309
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,160
down it looks like after Ashley got

1310
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:49,240
turned down on co-authoring a medical

1311
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,960
medium book Ashley then went around

1312
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:54,880
trying to pursue a book deal on her

1313
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,280
own and Ashley was desperately trying to

1314
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:01,079
grow a following on social media here is

1315
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,079
a text she sent to a friend in

1316
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,839
2017 had a meeting with a marketing

1317
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,839
consultant

1318
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:11,280
yesterday the friend responded by asking

1319
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:13,680
is this for your brand for your book and

1320
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,680
Ashley

1321
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,160
replied I basically just have to get my

1322
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:23,079
numbers up before I post all the random

1323
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:25,559
baby photos and stuff yeah every time I

1324
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:29,559
post something other than food I lose

1325
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:33,280
about 10 followers which adds up so I

1326
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:37,640
have to sort of streamline and

1327
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:40,720
focus in the same text thread Ashley

1328
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:43,319
said up for a little friendly

1329
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,880
competition I just want to like I don't

1330
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:48,839
know I need some inspiration to get

1331
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,319
serious about growing my insta so I

1332
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:53,440
thought you might be down for a little

1333
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:58,039
challenge like first one to gain 10K or

1334
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,039
something we can put some fun Stakes on

1335
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:03,319
Ashley was regularly asking this person

1336
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:06,680
for advice on how to grow her social

1337
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:10,559
media following in another text she

1338
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,799
asked question did your IG growth slow

1339
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,319
down so much because your only posting

1340
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:18,920
less frequently how many times do you

1341
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:22,640
think one needs to post to

1342
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:25,480
grow after receiving advice Ashley said

1343
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,599
this okay I've been trying to post once

1344
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,200
a day

1345
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:32,240
and I like lose followers at that rate

1346
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,559
LOL it seems like if you start a YouTube

1347
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,520
channel you get way more followers

1348
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,520
without posting as

1349
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:43,799
much after receiving advice again a

1350
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,720
couple days later Ashley said

1351
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:49,480
this I finally have been consistent

1352
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,319
enough with insta where I'm not losing

1353
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,119
followers at least once a day posting

1354
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:58,280
results in like super slow growth like

1355
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:01,319
10 new a day or

1356
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:04,039
so on a later date frustrated with not

1357
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:06,640
seeing the growth she so desired Ashley

1358
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:06,640
sent this

1359
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:17,319
text I'm posting twice a day on IG

1360
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:19,799
really top quality photos and seeing no

1361
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:22,240
growth she got some more advice from

1362
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:24,200
this person on Switching up her hashtags

1363
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,839
and then several hours later Ashley

1364
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:29,240
texted back

1365
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:31,839
okay I changed them up to see if it

1366
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,799
helps got a little boost from switching

1367
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:36,599
them

1368
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:39,160
up okay so Ashley had a meeting with an

1369
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:40,720
agent about getting herself a book deal

1370
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,680
Ashley had a meeting with a marketing

1371
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,760
consultant and then she was trying

1372
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,480
really hard to grow her social media

1373
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:50,079
following Anthony can you explain for

1374
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,920
listeners how book deals work and why

1375
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:55,480
this was so important to her it was a

1376
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,799
different world back in 2018 it was

1377
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:00,280
before influencers could become famous

1378
01:00:57,799 --> 01:01:03,480
on social media you either got somewhere

1379
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:06,039
on television acting music getting

1380
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,839
signed in a record deal something in

1381
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:11,680
sports or in publishing getting a book

1382
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:13,559
deal maybe it was before the time period

1383
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,039
we living in now where someone hits

1384
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,920
their grandmother over the head with a

1385
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:19,400
2x4 and gets 20 million views and the

1386
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,000
person who hit the grandmother over the

1387
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:25,200
head with a 2x4 has endorsement deals

1388
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,599
the world has changed Ashley was

1389
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,559
desperate to to get a book deal

1390
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:32,760
desperate to become somebody Ashley

1391
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:36,079
wanted to co-author a book with me she

1392
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,920
was very entitled and raised that way

1393
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:42,119
and she expected to co-author a book

1394
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:45,000
with me she expected it I said no for a

1395
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:48,000
multitude of reasons and I'm so glad I

1396
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,839
said no because this is the kind of

1397
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,319
person she is back then I noticed that

1398
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:55,599
when I spoke to Ashley she would say

1399
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:57,920
something and then the second time she

1400
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,920
said said it it would be different I

1401
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:03,200
didn't trust her I said no so Ashley

1402
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:05,480
tried to get a book deal on her own and

1403
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,279
in order to get a book deal on her own

1404
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,279
she needed a certain number of followers

1405
01:02:08,279 --> 01:02:12,799
so Ashley was trying to learn from

1406
01:02:10,279 --> 01:02:14,839
people like Robbie her best friend one

1407
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:17,720
of the other plotters how to build

1408
01:02:14,839 --> 01:02:20,520
followers on her Instagram

1409
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:22,079
Facebook that makes sense so clearly

1410
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,559
Ashley was trying to make a name for

1411
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:27,279
herself and build a platform for herself

1412
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:30,279
she ultimately wanted to be famous she

1413
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:31,640
was definitely also trying to make money

1414
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,400
the claims Ashley made when she was

1415
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,279
trying to get people to trust her with

1416
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,319
her fake Stephanie story that she never

1417
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:39,680
made money off of her Instagram and

1418
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:42,760
intentionally never did because of how

1419
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,960
much she quote values the truth are

1420
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:49,359
Flatout lies Ashley was using Instagram

1421
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:51,000
to sell ebooks Retreats bundles and more

1422
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,559
and let's be clear making money off of

1423
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,640
Instagram is fine that's not the problem

1424
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:58,720
but why did Ashley feel the need to lie

1425
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:00,520
about about it furthermore Ashley even

1426
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,160
tried to pursue another Avenue for

1427
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,839
profit by offering to invest in a brand

1428
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:09,160
that Anthony endorses here is the text

1429
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:12,720
she had sent to the owner of that

1430
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:14,680
company also bear this in mind if you

1431
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,440
ever decide you want to do a big push

1432
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:20,480
with vimergy and take on some investment

1433
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:23,720
and try and grow it up quick let me know

1434
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,720
I do it with y'all in a

1435
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:29,599
heartbeat there you have it Ashley got

1436
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:33,920
turned down on this proposal as

1437
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:37,000
well Ashley Foster always gets her way

1438
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:40,440
no one's allowed to tell Ashley no if

1439
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,520
they do Ashley will turn on them anyone

1440
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,960
who tells her no will pay the price it's

1441
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,920
who she

1442
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,160
is not only did Ashley eagerly want to

1443
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,720
invest in vimergy but this is also a

1444
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,960
company that has products that before

1445
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,279
Ashley got upset and turned on everyone

1446
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,480
Ashley said she used every day and that

1447
01:03:57,279 --> 01:04:01,200
helped her hair quote grow in so thick

1448
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,760
and

1449
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,880
shiny now after being turned down by

1450
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,119
them years ago Ashley and her hateful

1451
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,799
group repeatedly attacked this company

1452
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:12,480
along with Anthony and the medical

1453
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:14,880
medium Community after we released the

1454
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,440
plotter podcast episodes last year in

1455
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,599
another post Ashley made as she was

1456
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:22,480
trying to say face she said this

1457
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,839
something that really bothers me is how

1458
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,480
Anthony claimed in his podcast that we

1459
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:29,760
were doing this for money but at the

1460
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:33,000
same time claims that we must be part of

1461
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:35,559
some evil plot because we have money

1462
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,559
which one is

1463
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:42,359
it this is inaccurate if you listen back

1464
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:45,400
this instead is what was actually said

1465
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:45,400
in our first podcast

1466
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:50,599
episode what I learned is that the

1467
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:54,000
strategy of this group is to try to

1468
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:56,240
capture people like those young women

1469
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,119
with a manipulated story

1470
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,440
of a deceased person who isn't here

1471
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:02,039
anymore to speak for herself or to

1472
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,319
defend the truth of what actually

1473
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:06,480
happened they might throw in some other

1474
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:08,200
random misinformation to add to their

1475
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,880
story of why you shouldn't trust medical

1476
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:13,319
medium because they try to act like they

1477
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,720
have some special information that you

1478
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:17,559
just don't know even though all these

1479
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,079
people still admitted to applying

1480
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:21,039
medical medium information into their

1481
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:23,720
own lives yet they say that they don't

1482
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,200
trust you they just don't they they

1483
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,680
explicitly say that they don't credit

1484
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,000
the source they use it and don't credit

1485
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:32,079
the source and I literally heard them

1486
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,279
out on all of their points for a total

1487
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:37,559
of over 17 hours and I can tell you that

1488
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:39,400
everything that they think they have is

1489
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:41,440
a bunch of Twisted

1490
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,000
misinformation their false narrative

1491
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,599
story is the guys that they're using but

1492
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
what these calls also made clear to me

1493
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:51,400
is that some of these sources are part

1494
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,079
of this plan because they're actually

1495
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,640
being driven by some of it is misplaced

1496
01:05:54,079 --> 01:06:00,119
grief some of it is is people being

1497
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,279
driven by guilt but most of them

1498
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:04,160
disturbingly are being driven by

1499
01:06:02,279 --> 01:06:06,200
self-interests and what they would stand

1500
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:09,960
to gain financially and otherwise from

1501
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,960
the impact of a medical medium

1502
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,839
takedown I stand by all of that Ashley

1503
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:18,880
always gets it wrong first as you can

1504
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:21,039
hear it was me who said this not Anthony

1505
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,160
hi Ashley I did not say that you were a

1506
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,880
part of a plot because you have money

1507
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,920
your friend Taylor called you out for

1508
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,319
having a lot of money like private jet

1509
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:32,880
plus her words I said that I suspected

1510
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,359
that the plotters had mixed motives we

1511
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,079
didn't mention the fact that some of

1512
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:38,240
them have money and some of them don't

1513
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,799
have money and there are plenty of

1514
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,839
extremely wealthy people out there

1515
01:06:39,799 --> 01:06:43,799
including billionaires and Daughters of

1516
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:46,599
billionaires who never stop wanting to

1517
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:49,559
make more money what Ashley said is a

1518
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:52,119
false dichotomy in fact Ashley knows

1519
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:55,079
that this is a false dichotomy in text

1520
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:56,920
messages she sent to a friend in 2017

1521
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:59,480
Ashley used the following words to

1522
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,400
describe her own father who had long

1523
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,760
since been a billionaire and his

1524
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,760
business

1525
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,880
dealings he's trying to build something

1526
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,960
bigger and bigger and bigger I think

1527
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:15,720
he's just addicted to the game he's a

1528
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:19,720
real true addict the rush of the

1529
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:22,240
gambling element is so addictive to

1530
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,279
him while Ashley was applying medical

1531
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,440
medium information she wanted to do

1532
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:29,200
high-profit retreats without dipping

1533
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,720
into her trust fund admitting in that

1534
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,760
very text that she has money but that

1535
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,440
she wants to make more Ashley was

1536
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,440
selling eBooks she was working with

1537
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,559
bundle companies she wanted to be an

1538
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,160
author she was meeting with marketing

1539
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,799
consultants she wanted to grow a

1540
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,960
following she wanted to run the medical

1541
01:07:43,799 --> 01:07:48,039
medium YouTube channel for 50% of the

1542
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,920
earnings she wanted to have a stake in a

1543
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:53,720
company endorsed by medical medium and

1544
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,160
more Ashley also talked about wanting to

1545
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:59,480
do a positive medical medium documentary

1546
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:02,520
on Me on the light blast years ago she

1547
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:03,680
had her sight set on it she was obsessed

1548
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,240
with

1549
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,240
it okay so this is going to be shocking

1550
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:11,200
for people listening to hear to hear

1551
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:13,680
that so Ashley has wanted to make a

1552
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,159
documentary in some way shape or form

1553
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,000
about you for a long time this goes way

1554
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:21,279
back one of the most interesting things

1555
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,159
I've seen from Ashley is that one of her

1556
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:26,080
longest standing goals has been to

1557
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:28,839
become successful specifically in the

1558
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,359
film industry in a blog post Ashley

1559
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:35,799
wrote in 2010 she described a rule book

1560
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:38,640
she had for herself one of her rules was

1561
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:41,920
this right did you write

1562
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:44,159
today right and the writing you do today

1563
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:47,319
must eventually lead to a successful

1564
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,319
career in the film

1565
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:52,679
industry as you just heard Ashley has

1566
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:56,040
always wanted to be successful in the

1567
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:58,239
film industry Ashley's husband is also a

1568
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:01,120
documentary cinematographer I'm sure

1569
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:03,199
that he wants to be well known for that

1570
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,199
can you describe for everyone Anthony

1571
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:07,239
what the proposal that Ashley made to

1572
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:09,120
you years ago for a positive medical

1573
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:12,400
medium documentary was

1574
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,600
like Ashley was so fixated I wanting to

1575
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,279
do a documentary she asked me about it

1576
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:20,199
first on the phone she asked a mutual

1577
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,440
friend about it over and over again that

1578
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:25,440
mutual friend brought it up to my wife

1579
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:28,040
and I again and was in conversation with

1580
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:30,120
Ashley about it Ashley wanted to write

1581
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,400
and control the content of the

1582
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,159
documentary she wanted her husband to

1583
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,679
film it and she wanted her sister to

1584
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:40,560
edit it over the years I've been

1585
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:42,960
approached many times by big producers

1586
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,480
media companies and networks about doing

1587
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,600
a medical medium documentary or TV show

1588
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:49,920
my wife and I thought it'd be great to

1589
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,560
get people's healing stories and more

1590
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,760
information out there to help the

1591
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:57,280
chronically ill at some point but we

1592
01:09:54,760 --> 01:10:00,000
wouldn't have have gone to Ashley to do

1593
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,320
a documentary we entertained Ashley's

1594
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,560
ideas but then we quickly became

1595
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:08,800
concerned about what Ashley was

1596
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:11,000
saying so I have that text thread in

1597
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,120
front of me your wife initiates a

1598
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,920
conversation with Ashley about it after

1599
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,320
Ashley had been prodding about doing a

1600
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,760
documentary for a while Ashley says that

1601
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,120
she had thought about doing the

1602
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:23,719
documentary idea a lot and then she gets

1603
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,719
into her proposal she starts describing

1604
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:27,719
some of her ideas

1605
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:30,640
I like the idea of following a new

1606
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:33,280
client we could even fake that part of

1607
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,280
it

1608
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:39,000
LOL it can be an actor that recreates a

1609
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:41,520
storyline that is true that's frequently

1610
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,520
done for

1611
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:47,400
documentaries this sounds super sketchy

1612
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,840
very weird of Ashley to suggest being

1613
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,640
dishonest and to say that that's

1614
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:53,040
frequently done in

1615
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:56,000
documentaries after your wife politely

1616
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,920
responds interesting Ashley right away

1617
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,719
changes her mind on the idea that she

1618
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:05,159
herself just presented the actor idea is

1619
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:11,320
no good if someone got wind of it it

1620
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:11,320
would be real bad but it is common

1621
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:17,080
LOL these were more signs we saw

1622
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:21,840
firsthand of Ashley being manipulative

1623
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:24,159
and dishonest it made us really really

1624
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,120
uncomfortable right after Ashley's last

1625
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,560
message your wife changed es the subject

1626
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:30,520
and ends the documentary conversation so

1627
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:34,199
I'm guessing you guys had turned her

1628
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:37,000
down on that sketchy proposal as well

1629
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:39,480
yeah in the nicest way possible she kept

1630
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,920
asking about it and prodding and it's

1631
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,480
something we were never going to do with

1632
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,679
her we didn't want to disappoint Ashley

1633
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:49,880
but we just were not on the same page

1634
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:52,719
about it at all for Ashley to suggest

1635
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:56,120
altering a documentary so it becomes

1636
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:58,600
dishonest was unimaginable for a medical

1637
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:01,960
medium documentary we were sitting there

1638
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:05,040
wondering why on Earth is Ashley telling

1639
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:08,440
us this is how you do a documentary you

1640
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:10,679
fabricated in a dishonest way this was a

1641
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:14,440
shocker to

1642
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:16,800
us yeah so Ashley wanted her hand in

1643
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:19,360
every pot with you I'm sure that she saw

1644
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,679
you as a ticket to success everybody

1645
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,960
knows that you're one of the biggest

1646
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:24,880
Health authors in the world Ashley was

1647
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,199
trying to use the medical medium name to

1648
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,000
get her herself and her husband

1649
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:31,199
somewhere and she ended up getting

1650
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,760
turned down from basically every angle

1651
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:35,280
Ashley had spent years trying to pursue

1652
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,920
all these different Avenues and they

1653
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:40,199
were unsuccessful Ashley was struggling

1654
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,440
to grow a following she got turned down

1655
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:44,760
on co-authoring a book with you getting

1656
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,800
a book deal on her own evidently didn't

1657
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,159
work out she got turned down on

1658
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,159
investing in a company endorsed by you

1659
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:53,080
the medical medium YouTube channel deal

1660
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:55,760
that Ashley proposed didn't work out for

1661
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:57,800
her she got turned down on her proposal

1662
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,120
to partner with you to do medical medium

1663
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,880
Retreats her independent Retreat only

1664
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:05,199
filled 12 spots Ashley never made it in

1665
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,199
the film industry like she wanted to she

1666
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:09,080
got turned down on her proposal to do an

1667
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:11,040
inspirational documentary about medical

1668
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:13,639
medium that she wanted her husband to

1669
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:17,440
film and her sister to

1670
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:19,360
edit was Ashley upset with you I mean

1671
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:22,159
how did she respond to all of this

1672
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:25,159
rejection at the time she was

1673
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:27,639
disappointed and frustrated Ashley

1674
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:30,400
wanted desperately to have a hand in

1675
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:32,800
Everything Medical medium everything she

1676
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:35,520
wanted a piece of everything I was doing

1677
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,960
and now look what she's doing because

1678
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:41,080
she didn't get her way Ashley's not used

1679
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:43,800
to being told no it's an entitlement and

1680
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:46,040
an ego thing when Ashley realized she

1681
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,000
wasn't going to be able to get all of

1682
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:51,199
these high-profile business deals with

1683
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,199
me she flipped the switch was flipped

1684
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:55,760
and she started making things up that

1685
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:57,960
didn't exist she started Ed working on

1686
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,320
her false storylines and any

1687
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:02,840
communication she had with me of any

1688
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,280
kind or anybody I was associated with

1689
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,480
she started to try to twist and rewrite

1690
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,600
history so she could tell people a

1691
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:12,920
disturbing story that never existed and

1692
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:17,080
then she decided to take her stories to

1693
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,080
the media to try to hurt me and the

1694
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,880
community and you turned her down on

1695
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,600
these deals years ago because you had

1696
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:26,800
concerns about her intentions I turned

1697
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:29,320
her down for multiple reasons first of

1698
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,679
all every time someone I knew would talk

1699
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:33,480
to Ashley they would be left shaking

1700
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,400
their heads because it seemed that

1701
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:38,880
nothing that came out of Ashley's mouth

1702
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:42,440
was totally accurate she was 50/50 at

1703
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:46,159
best 50% mixed in accurate things with

1704
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:48,440
50% mixed in completely wrong inaccurate

1705
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,639
information and it was obvious to me

1706
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,480
that Ashley was only wanting to be

1707
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:55,000
involved with medical medium because of

1708
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:57,920
her wanting to start a business invol

1709
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,760
olving me or use me to launch her

1710
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:03,239
business and I knew this about Ashley

1711
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:06,159
it's not that I'm saying it's bad she

1712
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:09,000
wants to become somebody it's bad that

1713
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:13,120
her desire was to become somebody using

1714
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,320
me and then when I said no afterwards

1715
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:17,600
trying to destroy the medical medium

1716
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:20,920
community and me because she didn't get

1717
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:23,199
her way even if there was a world where

1718
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,880
I was naive enough to give Ashley all

1719
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:29,159
that she wanted a book deal with me big

1720
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:32,480
Retreats with my name on them $750,000

1721
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:35,880
like pop documentaries for her and her

1722
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:37,760
husband money made from those Ventures

1723
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,760
which could have equated to Millions

1724
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:42,400
would have been taken from the community

1725
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:45,239
and not invested back into the community

1726
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:48,120
on any level it would have been selfs

1727
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:51,159
serving as we'll cover later on Ashley

1728
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:53,800
is so cheap she wouldn't buy Stephanie a

1729
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:56,159
coach plane ticket to help Stephanie get

1730
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:59,000
out to Ashley's family is Pebble Beach

1731
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:01,320
mansion and money that I've made from

1732
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,800
working around the clock a big portion

1733
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:06,440
of that money goes back into producing

1734
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:08,120
free everything for the community if

1735
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,800
there was a world where I was naive

1736
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:13,560
enough to let Ashley go into multiple

1737
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,760
business deals with me all that money

1738
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,120
would have been

1739
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:19,280
squandered Penny pinched and

1740
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,480
self-serving for her children and her

1741
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,920
lifestyle so that she can have expensive

1742
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:26,920
vacations and grandiose dinners with

1743
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,760
friends all all while I will still be

1744
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,040
standing in my kitchen eating a steamed

1745
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:33,960
potato standing up working 20 hours a

1746
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:38,120
day to get the next book out so people

1747
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,880
can heal an example of how Ashley works

1748
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:43,080
is that she wanted to make all this

1749
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:45,920
money from you the community that

1750
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:48,880
doesn't have money so she's didn't have

1751
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:52,000
to touch her trust fund a trust fund

1752
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:54,239
with an exorbitant amount of money in it

1753
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,840
it would have been unfair to the

1754
01:16:54,239 --> 01:17:00,320
community that Ashley was making a

1755
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:02,440
killing off their backs I could not live

1756
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,880
with that so I chose not to do a

1757
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:07,320
documentry with her I chose not to let

1758
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,360
her co-author books with me and I chose

1759
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:12,199
not to go into the retreat business with

1760
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:15,239
her using my name Ashley would have made

1761
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:18,440
a killing so that she could avoid using

1762
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:21,080
her trust fund from her billionaire

1763
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:23,639
father now after I turned her down and

1764
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:25,440
she didn't get what she wanted Ashley is

1765
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:28,600
trying to become famous

1766
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:31,159
through pretending to be a whistleblower

1767
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,719
spreading lies false claims and

1768
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:36,800
disinformation and trying to frame me

1769
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:39,719
along with her partner Tony tazone

1770
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:42,520
Stephanie's brother who as one of the

1771
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:45,080
plotters said is just looking for

1772
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:48,040
someone to blame according to another

1773
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:51,120
plotter Tony has multiple fake accounts

1774
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:54,280
on social media platforms and he may not

1775
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:55,760
realize it but he's doing Ashley's

1776
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:58,560
bidding

1777
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:00,880
she's stoking the Flames of his grief

1778
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,719
and anger and Tony doesn't know why

1779
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:06,920
Ashley's really on this Mission she's

1780
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:09,560
using him Ashley has recruited other

1781
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:12,719
people to spread her lies for her we

1782
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,600
have Insider information that she's

1783
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:18,159
promising the people who are supporting

1784
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:20,840
her a spot in a documentary ultimately

1785
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:23,480
Ashley's goal is now to make it

1786
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:25,639
somewhere in the film industry by trying

1787
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:28,120
to get a deal for negative hitpiece

1788
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:31,920
documentary about me and to take the

1789
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:34,280
medical mum Community down in the

1790
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,600
process I also want to ask you this

1791
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:38,840
because I know that there will be people

1792
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,920
out there wondering about spirit and if

1793
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:44,920
Ashley was capable of all of this

1794
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,520
spinning stories and lying to harm you

1795
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:49,840
and attacking the medical medium

1796
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:51,520
Community then can you explain why why

1797
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:54,400
did spirit let you engage with her at

1798
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,320
all Spirit told me not to engage with

1799
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,400
Ashley

1800
01:18:55,320 --> 01:19:02,120
and I voiced that to my friends Ashley

1801
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:04,560
was a friend of a friend I communicated

1802
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:07,400
with Ashley very little I kept her at

1803
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:10,120
arms length when I got off the phone

1804
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:13,320
after one of my first calls with her I

1805
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:16,440
said to my wife no she is not a good

1806
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:20,400
person she seems empty and soulless and

1807
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:23,159
not genuine and spirit's given me a

1808
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:25,199
warning but I gave it a chance because I

1809
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:27,880
always keep faith that people will heal

1810
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:30,840
their mental state Spirit gave me the

1811
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:33,840
potential that Ashley could be an

1812
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:36,000
ill-intentioned person but you can only

1813
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,719
hope that someone uses their free will

1814
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,600
to do good things and not harmful things

1815
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:43,800
despicable things abusive things and I

1816
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,560
didn't want to let a mutual friend down

1817
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:48,840
who was wanting me to connect with

1818
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:52,480
Ashley for somebody that said I saved

1819
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:55,840
her and her sister's life and to turn so

1820
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:58,880
dark and to lie so much really brings me

1821
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:01,520
a new understanding of what people can

1822
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:03,880
be I mean you expect out there in the

1823
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:07,760
world for things to go wrong but you

1824
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:11,239
never expect a mom to be so conniving

1825
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:14,840
and just plain evil she built the whole

1826
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:17,199
thing off of originally I never told

1827
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:20,920
Stephanie to see a doctor which was a

1828
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:23,639
lie that alone is sick if you think or

1829
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:26,960
falsities lies and fabricated stories

1830
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:28,920
about me are harmful and ridiculous now

1831
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,400
what would have happened if I didn't

1832
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:34,280
keep Ashley at arms

1833
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:36,960
length I mean just in what we've exposed

1834
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:39,239
in this episode alone Ashley has been

1835
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,320
wildly dishonest about her wealth she

1836
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:43,679
said quote there's nothing crazy going

1837
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:46,560

1838
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:50,120
daughter of a late multibillionaire with

1839
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:52,560
cars and homes and planes all over the

1840
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:54,960
world and she grew up in a mansion

01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:18,800
having the intention to make money off

1850
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,679

01:21:20,679 --> 01:21:26,320
Instagram and also specifically to

repeatedly make 200 $40,000 off of the

1854
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:30,760
medical medium Community without dipping

1855
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:33,560
into her trust fund by doing Retreats

1856
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:35,880
two months out of the year plus to gain

1857
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,800
a whole lot more money and fame off of

1858
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,239

Crystal Clear for everyone to see

1862
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:49,639
Stephanie was sick for two whole years

1863
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,120
and despite Ashley having all of the

1864
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:54,600
means in the world the convenience of a

1865
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:56,920
private jet that even went directly to

1866
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,120
Pennsylvania where Stephanie lived and

1867
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:01,800
somehow the time to be able to travel

1868
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,920
for other purposes like to host Retreats

1869
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:07,360
that she was trying to make money off

1870
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:09,920
of Ashley did not visit Stephanie

1871
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:13,040
once what Ashley's doing is not about

1872
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:15,520
Stephanie Ashley has exploited and used

1873
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,800
Stephanie now along with multiple others

1874
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,639
as well and because her Twisted

1875
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:22,280
Stephanie story didn't do the damage she

1876
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:24,639
desperately wanted it to Ashley's now

1877
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:27,320

positive documentary deal that she

1886
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,880

01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,320

negative hitpiece documentary about you

1891
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,440
so that she can become famous and

1892
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,159
successful that

1893
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:02,080
way this isn't some whistleblower who

1894
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:04,760
walked away because of Integrity Ashley

1895
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,679
is trying hard to convince her followers

1896
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,760
that she is such an honest and

1897
01:23:06,679 --> 01:23:11,760
transparent person yet Ashley has not

1898
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,840
publicly disclosed the fact that she had

1899
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:17,040
every desire to make money and become

1900
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,199
somebody using medical medium Ashley has

1901
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,159
not disclosed the fact that she made all

1902
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:23,719
of these business proposals to Anthony

1903
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:25,280
and that she got turned down all right

1904
01:23:23,719 --> 01:23:26,639
around the same time as what was

1905
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,360
happening with

1906
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:30,920
Stephanie Ashley has not disclosed that

1907
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,760
she was still marketing and trying to

1908
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:35,360
sell Retreats using medical medium

1909
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:38,400
information to the community for over a

1910
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:40,760
year after Stephanie passed away and all

1911
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:44,159
the way up until literal weeks before

1912
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:47,360
she came out with her false story about

1913
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:49,760
Stephanie it's hard to think that Ashley

1914
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,960
is this motive driven person when she's

1915
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:55,040
breastfeeding or acting like she's this

1916
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:57,920
well-to-do authentic or honest mom

1917
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:01,480
it's really a good cover like she's just

1918
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:03,320
a whistleblower to stop a mean man the

1919
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:06,400
story she's telling people never

1920
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:09,760
happened but a mom who seems so honest

1921
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:12,280
in every sense it can win somebody over

1922
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,520
it can win a journalist over it can win

1923
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:16,920
other people over especially people who

1924
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:19,880
are looking for reason to not like me

1925
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:23,239
her cloak in Disguise is this wholesome

1926
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:26,000
mother with seemingly so much wisdom who

1927
01:24:23,239 --> 01:24:28,760
cares so deeply about the world from the

1928
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,800
outside raises her children with the

1929
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:34,800
best of values and then she seeks out

1930
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:38,040
journalists they see this she puts on

1931
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:40,440
this front how can she be wrong

1932
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:42,639
influencers who weren't friends of mine

1933
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:45,280
but were acquaintances she would

1934
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:48,600
befriend them purposely to try to sell

1935
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:50,880
them these stories that I'm a fraud and

1936
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:54,040
she's worked really hard at it for years

1937
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,840
now and in reality the truth she has a

1938
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,360
condition

1939
01:24:54,840 --> 01:25:00,119
either born out of jealousy and hatred

1940
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:02,800
towards me or just a different illness

1941
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:05,520
where she just can't help but to lie and

1942
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:08,440
makeup stories as you'll learn in these

1943
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:12,000
episodes to come Ashley can't get

1944
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:14,840
anything right or anything straight not

1945
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,600
just her own madeup stories but factual

1946
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:20,480
worldly understandings that can actually

1947
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,840
be fact checked and she'll still be

1948
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:25,639
completely off the

1949
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,679

series as we are in the process of

1954
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,960
exposing Ashley and her organized

1955
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,440
hateful group for who and what they

1956
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,360
really are it's important to take note

1957
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:45,920
of their tactics and patterns that are

1958
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:48,320
likely to follow the plotters have a

1959
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:51,400
documented history of initiating attacks

1960
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:53,679
using lies and misinformation and then

1961
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,760
upon getting called out and corrected

1962
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:59,400
trying to flip it and play victim that

1963
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:01,960
is not going to work here all this group

1964
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:04,199
has done is spread verifiable lies and

1965
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,880
falsities they've carelessly attacked

1966
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:09,040
and harmed many innocent people they've

1967
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,760
used and exploited deceased individuals

1968
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:13,520
and others in the process of trying to

1969
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:16,040
get what they want they've repeatedly

1970
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,880
explicitly expressed the intent to harm

1971
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,679
medical medium and they've even

1972
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:21,880
deliberately tried to stop Anthony from

1973
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:24,600
doing a free event to support and raise

1974
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:26,719
money for the community we have every

1975
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:29,199
right to set the record straight and to

1976
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:31,119
defend the truth with facts and evidence

1977
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:32,639
and to defend the chronically ill

1978
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:35,480
against the malicious attacks of this

1979
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:38,960
group and we are going to continue to do

1980
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:41,679
so we expect the plotters to evade and

1981
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,560
ignore what they have done wrong we

1982
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:46,480
expect them to continue to lie and

1983
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:49,480
spread falsities we expect them to Pivot

1984
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:52,639
onto something new they'll make up and

1985
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:54,840
we expect them to skew and alter data

1986
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:57,159
and to hide critical pie pieces of

1987
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:00,119
evidence that undermines their entire

1988
01:26:57,159 --> 01:27:03,000
campaign we also expect the plotters to

1989
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:05,199
fabricate explanations as they do

1990
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,159
everything they can to try to discredit

1991
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:10,320
what we're exposing them for having done

1992
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:13,000
and said in their own

1993
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:15,880
words but we are using their own text

1994
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:19,600
messages voice messages social media

1995
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:22,239
posts words that they spoke on recorded

1996
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:25,119
calls and other published materials

1997
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:28,360
there's no use of any AI in any of these

1998
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:30,400
episodes and never will be all of the

1999
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:33,440
