[541.68 - 547.28] and pain on the tongue right
[545.28 - 549.76] so what i'm doing here is i have the
[547.28 - 551.28] bottle so let's say canker sores first
[549.76 - 553.04] we're not going to talk about simplex on
[551.28 - 554.96] the lip over here anything but canker
[553.04 - 556.24] sores what you do is you take a paper
[554.96 - 557.28] towel
[556.24 - 559.12] right
[557.28 - 560.00] and if you want to get rid of a canker
[559.12 - 563.12] sore
[560.00 - 565.28] fast as lightning
[563.12 - 567.44] fast as lightning a lot of people a lot
[565.28 - 569.68] of kids suffer from them everything you
[567.44 - 571.52] take it take a paper towel dry paper
[569.68 - 573.36] towel not a wet one
[571.52 - 574.84] and you dab the canker sore so if you
[573.36 - 577.84] have a canker sore on your
[574.84 - 579.52] tongue you dry the canker sore is what
[577.84 - 581.20] you do
[579.52 - 583.12] this is information that people can go
[581.20 - 584.56] to 20 doctors 50 doctors with finger
[583.12 - 586.08] sores riddle their mouth and not even
[584.56 - 587.36] know what to do they leave the doctor's
[586.08 - 589.76] office
[587.36 - 591.84] they get some kind of mouth rinse
[589.76 - 594.72] and they're just like what do i do
[591.84 - 597.28] this is that valuable this information
[594.72 - 598.96] so you dry off the canker sore
[597.28 - 601.52] and then
[598.96 - 602.84] keep your mouth open
[601.52 - 605.76] and then you put
[602.84 - 608.40] it right on the canker sore and you let
[605.76 - 610.40] it sit there right on the mouth ulcer
[608.40 - 613.20] right wherever that is now if you can't
[610.40 - 613.92] reach your mouth ulcer
[613.20 - 616.40] or
[613.92 - 619.12] your canker sore
[616.40 - 621.60] if you can't reach reach it
[619.12 - 624.40] then you squirt a dropper full in its
[621.60 - 627.60] vicinity so if you got a wisdom tooth
[624.40 - 630.08] that's coming out or you or a corn chip
[627.60 - 633.04] when a jagged corn chip went right into
[630.08 - 634.64] your gum or gum line
[633.04 - 637.12] and now you got a sore but you're like
[634.64 - 639.04] what is that it hurts right between my
[637.12 - 641.52] two back molars
[639.04 - 642.80] you want to go to the vicinity like that
[641.52 - 644.72] and be like okay it's on the left side
[642.80 - 647.04] of my mouth
[644.72 - 648.64] boom you hit it
[647.04 - 650.96] that's what you do
[648.64 - 653.76] and you let it sit there
[650.96 - 655.28] you let it sit there on that area in
[653.76 - 657.76] that area you let it sit there that
[655.28 - 658.84] propolis
[657.76 - 661.60] same
[658.84 - 664.64] thing right
[661.60 - 666.16] if you got a sore throat
[664.64 - 667.44] and do what your doctor tells you to do
[666.16 - 670.24] but i'm just showing you what i tell my
[667.44 - 671.36] family members and my friends
[670.24 - 673.04] okay
[671.36 - 675.28] and it's something i would do if i had a
[673.04 - 676.80] sore throat or what i was saying like a
[675.28 - 678.24] sore somewhere
[676.80 - 680.00] and so
[678.24 - 681.28] now if you have sore throat
[680.00 - 683.60] and dealing with sore throats you could
[681.28 - 685.68] have a canker sore on your throat
[683.60 - 687.28] people don't know this
[685.68 - 688.48] same thing with people with tonsil
[687.28 - 690.72] stones
[688.48 - 694.00] they get sores because of those tonsil
[690.72 - 696.88] stones starting to pop out right
[694.00 - 698.96] tonsil stones really being streptococcus
[696.88 - 701.52] bacteria producing tremendous amounts of
[698.96 - 703.76] junk and garbage and then it then it um
[701.52 - 705.12] calcifies
[703.76 - 707.36] right
[705.12 - 709.28] so what's happening is you take this and
[707.36 - 711.20] you put it in there and you have it sit
[709.28 - 712.96] there in your throat tamara says will it
[711.20 - 714.48] work for lupus well i'll talk about all
[712.96 - 715.84] that a little later like neurological
[714.48 - 718.40] symptoms people with lupus have all the
[715.84 - 719.76] neurological symptoms immune problems so
[718.40 - 721.52] this is the propolis so this is the
[719.76 - 723.28] vimergy propolis i'm talking about i'm
[721.52 - 725.20] not sponsored

[733.68 - 736.88] cleanse the heel right now we're talking
[735.60 - 738.72] about the kink i see a whole bunch of
[736.88 - 739.92] people coming on

[760.72 - 764.88] inside and you can't dry it off like
[763.60 - 767.44] this
[764.88 - 769.92] and then put the propolis directly on it
[767.44 - 770.84] you can get rid of canker sores so quick
[769.92 - 774.88] it's
[770.84 - 777.04] insane overnight they start going away
[774.88 - 778.88] when you use a real propolis like
[777.04 - 780.00] something that's unbelievable like this
[778.88 - 781.20] right
[780.00 - 782.96] and you know
[781.20 - 784.40] right on that spot right
[782.96 - 787.84] check this out okay
[784.40 - 787.84] then you let it sit there
[789.60 - 793.84] and then you do it again
[792.24 - 795.60] a minute later
[793.84 - 797.12] you take your paper towel you hit the
[795.60 - 799.68] canker sore or mouth sore or anything
[797.12 - 801.68] like that and boom you dry it real quick
[799.68 - 804.40] and then you hit it with another drop
[801.68 - 806.48] and you let it sit on there
[804.40 - 808.56] you do that before bed your canker sores
[806.48 - 810.56] start to heal overnight they start to go
[808.56 - 811.84] away overnight mouth sores canker sores
[810.56 - 813.20] all that stuff now ask your doctor

[830.96 - 834.96] the sore
[832.72 - 836.72] it's good for the virus when the virus

[836.72 - 841.04] hell in your life
[838.56 - 844.00] like neurological symptoms

[844.00 - 848.08] causing vagus nerve inflammation causing
[846.64 - 850.56] all these problems people don't realize
[848.08 - 852.88] trigeminal nerve pain clenching of the
[850.56 - 854.88] teeth all the time herpes simplex one
[852.88 - 857.68] you don't need the cold sore virus to
[854.88 - 859.36] have it it's in the nerves
[857.68 - 862.40] randa says love everything you do makes
[859.36 - 864.08] so much sense on facebook thank you
[862.40 - 865.20] i'm honored you're here truly just so
[864.08 - 866.80] you know
[865.20 - 868.80] okay
[866.80 - 871.12] so tamara says i have cold sore using
[868.80 - 873.68] tea tree oil is that okay well ask your
[871.12 - 875.84] doctor if that's okay but if i had
[873.68 - 878.56] a cold sore i wouldn't be using tea tree
[875.84 - 880.64] oil personally i'd be using propolis
[878.56 - 882.32] that's what i would be using
[880.64 - 885.84] but you if your doctor tells you tea
[882.32 - 885.84] tree oil you listen to your doctor
[886.64 - 890.08] anyway
[888.00 - 892.40] the bottom line is i want to talk now
[890.08 - 894.88] about the herpes source so people get a
[892.40 - 896.64] lot of cold sores and so let's go into
[894.88 - 899.36] the cold sore section here but first of
[896.64 - 900.40] all we're going to go back and forth a
[899.36 - 902.00] little bit because i want to talk about
[900.40 - 903.68] some other supplements involved with
[902.00 - 905.60] that
[903.68 - 906.88] but i'm in herpes simplex section right
[905.60 - 908.72] here so let's get a close-up see if we
[906.88 - 910.16] can see this and and we were getting a
[908.72 - 912.16] pretty good close-up before it was it
[910.16 - 913.60] was amazing so there it is herpes
[912.16 - 916.80] simplex do you guys see that right where
[913.60 - 917.52] the post with postage note is
[916.80 - 919.04] right
[917.52 - 920.72] so there's a protocol in here this is
[919.04 - 922.72] cleanse the heel you guys so this is a
[920.72 - 925.36] book that millions of people have around
[922.72 - 926.96] the world millions of copies have sold
[925.36 - 928.64] it's almost in every single country on
[926.96 - 930.40] the planet
[928.64 - 932.08] people use it i hear it all the time use
[930.40 - 933.76] it as the reference books
[932.08 - 935.60] they use it as the reference guides they
[933.76 - 938.08] use it as their bible a lot of people
[935.60 - 940.32] say all of that right this is the
[938.08 - 943.04] medical textbook cleanse the heel if you
[940.32 - 946.00] guys don't have it okay amazon.com it's
[943.04 - 948.96] 51 off or free at the library so we're
[946.00 - 950.64] in the herpes simplex part right here
[948.96 - 953.44] so anita says which one is for the
[950.64 - 954.48] tongue and mouth sore so the propolis
[953.44 - 956.88] you use
[954.48 - 958.64] on any source that are in the mouth
[956.88 - 960.00] right
[958.64 - 963.36] and
[960.00 - 965.20] here's the thing on in other propolises
[963.36 - 968.16] you will taste the difference right they
[965.20 - 970.08] have alcohol in them and you'll know it
[968.16 - 972.32] there's a difference with this one you
[970.08 - 973.84] don't have the hidden alcohol or the
[972.32 - 975.76] hidden solvents
[973.84 - 977.92] it's the first of its kind you cannot
[975.76 - 979.84] make a propolis without alcohol and
[977.92 - 981.12] hidden solvents by the way it's not it
[979.84 - 983.84] can't be done
[981.12 - 986.64] first time ever it was done and that's
[983.84 - 988.48] how incredible this is but the thing is
[986.64 - 991.12] is what vimergy did
[988.48 - 995.28] they did it and they left over 50
[991.12 - 996.72] percent of the active quercetin
[995.28 - 999.52] and other
[996.72 - 1001.28] incredible polyphenols right
[999.52 - 1003.28] now people say why not take a quercetin
[1001.28 - 1006.16] supplement because it's dead
[1003.28 - 1007.68] you can't really bottle corsetin that's
[1006.16 - 1009.92] why medical medium doesn't talk about
[1007.68 - 1012.32] quercetin all day long because it has to
[1009.92 - 1014.80] be in its living form
[1012.32 - 1016.32] quercetin is is practically useless
[1014.80 - 1018.48] actually it's useless in a
[1016.32 - 1019.76] supplementation form on its own so
[1018.48 - 1021.28] everybody says well i'll take my course
[1019.76 - 1023.20] and the reason why you don't see me ever
[1021.28 - 1025.12] talk about quercetin is because it
[1023.20 - 1027.36] doesn't work
[1025.12 - 1030.40] but when quercetin is left in its active
[1027.36 - 1032.80] state in a living form in the propolis
[1030.40 - 1034.56] the resin itself that was that was
[1032.80 - 1035.76] designed by the bees
[1034.56 - 1038.40] from
[1035.76 - 1041.68] from gathering it from tree buds the the
[1038.40 - 1043.84] quercetin is actually alive and active
[1041.68 - 1046.32] and real it wasn't baked and cooked and
[1043.84 - 1048.00] run through the mill
[1046.32 - 1050.88] so just so you know people who love
[1048.00 - 1052.08] corsetin or think corseton's good
[1050.88 - 1053.60] this is the first time you're going to
[1052.08 - 1055.68] be getting a course attendant actually
[1053.60 - 1058.16] works even though it doesn't say corsa
[1055.68 - 1059.76] 10 it says propolis
[1058.16 - 1062.72] it's the only place to get quercetin
[1059.76 - 1064.96] that's active and alive
[1062.72 - 1067.04] so that's a piece of information all in
[1064.96 - 1069.12] its own that's mind-blowing that's
[1067.04 - 1072.16] mind-blowing
[1069.12 - 1074.32] in the world of health
[1072.16 - 1077.04] like you know i mean
[1074.32 - 1078.48] it's just it's just crazy how it works
[1077.04 - 1080.48] so we got the herpes simplex we're
[1078.48 - 1082.40] talking about that right now um clearly
[1080.48 - 1084.08] clearly nature cool handle right there
[1082.40 - 1087.04] on youtube good to see you can you
[1084.08 - 1089.36] explain why the propylene glycol glycol
[1087.04 - 1092.24] is bad because propylene glycol is
[1089.36 - 1094.08] alcohol it's an industrialized alcohol
[1092.24 - 1096.16] that's why it's bad so what it does is
[1094.08 - 1099.28] it destroys the active constituents that
[1096.16 - 1101.20] are actually in proplus
[1099.28 - 1102.72] so your propolis
[1101.20 - 1104.96] is destroyed
[1102.72 - 1106.96] with the alcohol in it propylene glycol
[1104.96 - 1109.12] if that's in your
[1106.96 - 1110.32] propolis your propolis isn't living
[1109.12 - 1112.32] anymore
[1110.32 - 1114.16] that means your quercetin isn't living
[1112.32 - 1116.32] anymore in there that means it's not
[1114.16 - 1118.80] even a fraction of what it can do
[1116.32 - 1121.60] that's just one the other is alcohol and
[1118.80 - 1124.16] tinctures burn holes in stomachs
[1121.60 - 1128.16] i've said this for years so alcohol and
[1124.16 - 1130.08] tinctures burn holes in stomachs
[1128.16 - 1132.80] irritates everything irritates the
[1130.08 - 1135.28] linings irritates the nerves irritates
[1132.80 - 1136.72] you don't see alcoholic tinctures
[1135.28 - 1138.16] recommended by medical medium
[1136.72 - 1141.28] information because spirit of compassion
[1138.16 - 1143.04] told me since day one they're the worst
[1141.28 - 1145.12] and it's why people don't heal when they
[1143.04 - 1146.72] do herbal remedies that have alcohol in
[1145.12 - 1148.56] them that's why they go to their next
[1146.72 - 1149.76] naturopath and people have done this
[1148.56 - 1151.28] stuff for years they go to another
[1149.76 - 1153.28] naturopath another functional doctor
[1151.28 - 1154.48] another guy another guru another healer
[1153.28 - 1155.76] and they're taking all their teachers
[1154.48 - 1158.48] all this alcohol in them and just
[1155.76 - 1160.08] getting sicker
[1158.48 - 1161.92] sicker
[1160.08 - 1163.76] each other says vimorji is so incredible
[1161.92 - 1165.12] they really go above and beyond for us
[1163.76 - 1166.08] because they care about the chronically
[1165.12 - 1167.76] ill
[1166.08 - 1169.84] so you say i'm so grateful for them they
[1167.76 - 1171.44] really have taken my healing to the next
[1169.84 - 1173.92] level every time i can't wait for the
[1171.44 - 1175.52] propolis to get here hopefully today so
[1173.92 - 1178.80] let's talk about the herpes a little bit
[1175.52 - 1180.96] before we get cruz in here okay um on
[1178.80 - 1182.32] rumble lee says hi
[1180.96 - 1183.84] hi lee
[1182.32 - 1185.76] i love rumble
[1183.84 - 1187.60] all right
[1185.76 - 1190.00] so we're in the herpes simplex section
[1187.60 - 1191.84] here there are many strains of mutations
[1190.00 - 1193.60] of herpes simplex one you guys and
[1191.84 - 1195.68] almost every single person if not every
[1193.60 - 1197.44] single person has one strain inside
[1195.68 - 1199.28] their liver somewhere hiding out and
[1197.44 - 1201.36] will come out or not come out or it all
[1199.28 - 1203.92] depends on what's going on but a lot of
[1201.36 - 1205.20] people gather a lot more than one strain
[1203.92 - 1206.96] that's the whole thing with herpes
[1205.20 - 1210.32] simplex 1.
[1206.96 - 1211.76] herpes simplex 1 and herpes simplex 2
[1210.32 - 1213.60] symptoms that can arise from these
[1211.76 - 1216.08] viruses including fatigue you can get
[1213.60 - 1218.96] fatigue from herpes simplex 1 in your
[1216.08 - 1221.44] system not even having the sore jaw pain
[1218.96 - 1223.12] ear pain pain in the lower neck pain in
[1221.44 - 1225.36] the lower neck pain in the upper neck
[1223.12 - 1227.44] pain in the back of the head pain in the
[1225.36 - 1230.48] genital area bladder pain and
[1227.44 - 1232.64] inflammation sore throat mild fever
[1230.48 - 1234.64] mouth sores sores on the genitals
[1232.64 - 1236.48] adjacent areas in many cases someone is
[1234.64 - 1238.56] actually dealing with shingles and it's
[1236.48 - 1240.64] misdiagnosis herpes simplex one or two
[1238.56 - 1242.32] but still these are all herpetic viruses
[1240.64 - 1244.72] and in here
[1242.32 - 1246.16] okay you'll see a protocol right here
[1244.72 - 1248.96] and i'll give you give you a close-up on
[1246.16 - 1250.96] this protocol right here right so
[1248.96 - 1252.32] there's the protocol you can't see it
[1250.96 - 1253.92] it's probably a little blurry but i'm
[1252.32 - 1255.44] trying to show you
[1253.92 - 1257.44] right and
[1255.44 - 1260.16] and in this protocol
[1257.44 - 1263.60] okay you'll see propolis it says five
[1260.16 - 1266.24] dropper folds twice a day or dab on the
[1263.60 - 1269.04] herpes source so i want to show you this
[1266.24 - 1269.92] right okay
[1269.04 - 1271.76] so
[1269.92 - 1273.84] if you have a cold sore if you don't
[1271.76 - 1275.68] have a cold sore but you but the virus
[1273.84 - 1277.76] is creating problems and making you sick
[1275.68 - 1279.20] that's another story right
[1277.76 - 1280.96] but you know and i'm going to show you
[1279.20 - 1283.04] also in the shot glass so you take the
[1280.96 - 1285.84] paper towel and you dry off
[1283.04 - 1287.92] your herpes cold sore
[1285.84 - 1290.64] and then you put the propolis right on
[1287.92 - 1292.80] the herpes cold sore right here so at
[1290.64 - 1295.60] least you can start killing
[1292.80 - 1297.92] the sore where it lies here even though
[1295.60 - 1300.16] this the virus is still in the system so
[1297.92 - 1303.60] that's why it also says take five
[1300.16 - 1305.52] dropper fulls of propolis twice a day
[1303.60 - 1307.60] twice a day so you're taking five
[1305.52 - 1308.96] dropper fulls right here
[1307.60 - 1310.56] okay
[1308.96 - 1312.48] you guys people traveled around the
[1310.56 - 1315.04] world to enter my office just so you
[1312.48 - 1318.16] know i've been doing this for 35 years
[1315.04 - 1320.80] people traveled around the world coming
[1318.16 - 1324.24] to my office
[1320.80 - 1326.48] praying to god they can even talk to me
[1324.24 - 1328.72] it was a sad situation to see that many
[1326.48 - 1330.08] sick people people being carried into my
[1328.72 - 1333.20] office
[1330.08 - 1335.36] because they couldn't walk and
[1333.20 - 1336.32] this information
[1335.36 - 1338.32] okay
[1336.32 - 1340.72] is really important i mean this could
[1338.32 - 1342.88] change lives for so many people natalia
[1340.72 - 1344.80] says aw what about propolis and water
[1342.88 - 1346.48] base
[1344.80 - 1348.48] doesn't work
[1346.48 - 1350.80] for a lot of reasons
[1348.48 - 1352.72] it goes rancid and ferments and goes
[1350.80 - 1354.08] south
[1352.72 - 1355.92] and that's
[1354.08 - 1357.28] and okay first of all any propolis that
[1355.92 - 1358.88] says it's in water-based it's just in
[1357.28 - 1360.24] water-based is still an alcohol but
[1358.88 - 1362.96] they're not saying it's an alcohol or
[1360.24 - 1362.96] it's in solvents
[1363.12 - 1366.40] that's a whole thing too unless you take
[1364.72 - 1368.64] propolis yourself that you harvested
[1366.40 - 1369.68] from a bee hive and then you mixed it in
[1368.64 - 1371.28] water
[1369.68 - 1372.64] but but but
[1371.28 - 1374.00] that's another story and i don't think
[1372.64 - 1375.44] that's what that is if they're selling
[1374.00 - 1377.04] it is prolific and water-based it's not
[1375.44 - 1378.96] purples and water-based you don't have
[1377.04 - 1380.80] to disclose here's the thing you don't
[1378.96 - 1382.88] have to disclose all the wrongs about
[1380.80 - 1385.60] propolis in the world no one's keeping
[1382.88 - 1387.52] after that that's how like
[1385.60 - 1388.80] problematic it all is and that's why the
[1387.52 - 1391.60] vimergy
[1388.80 - 1393.28] uh people did a different thing
[1391.60 - 1395.52] selena says what supplements would you
[1393.28 - 1399.04] recommend for visual snow would it help
[1395.52 - 1401.52] this condition i floaters i floaters are
[1399.04 - 1403.28] a herpes virus that's what i floaters
[1401.52 - 1406.48] are so it's one of the herpes family
[1403.28 - 1408.24] members ebv can create the eye floaters
[1406.48 - 1411.12] even a little bit of simplex all those
[1408.24 - 1412.16] neurotoxins so we're we're talking about
[1411.12 - 1413.84] that kind of thing and we're talking
[1412.16 - 1416.64] about neurological symptoms so let's go
[1413.84 - 1418.88] into this a little bit more so we're in
[1416.64 - 1422.24] i want to go back to canker source for a
[1418.88 - 1422.24] second here too okay
[1422.64 - 1426.40] so we're in the canker sores
[1425.28 - 1429.96] all right
[1426.40 - 1429.96] canker sore viruses
[1430.56 - 1434.24] and we're in here now so we're in canker
[1432.24 - 1436.24] sores so i just want to show you
[1434.24 - 1438.80] it says propolis for kinkosaurus three
[1436.24 - 1440.56] dropper folds twice a day
[1438.80 - 1442.48] so it's not just you dab it on the
[1440.56 - 1444.40] kicker store you can you can dab it just
[1442.48 - 1447.36] right on the canker sore if you want
[1444.40 - 1449.12] you can do that but you can also do
[1447.36 - 1450.72] three dropper holes twice a day you can
[1449.12 - 1452.00] do the protocol now i want to give
[1450.72 - 1453.44] everybody a little window in this when
[1452.00 - 1454.72] you look at cleanse the heel and you're
[1453.44 - 1456.32] learning about this and seeing the
[1454.72 - 1457.68] protocols try not to just jump to the
[1456.32 - 1459.92] protocols
[1457.68 - 1462.64] try to read the section before the
[1459.92 - 1464.72] protocols read the supplements section
[1462.64 - 1467.20] like all the information the do's and
[1464.72 - 1468.88] don'ts what to look out for the link for
[1467.20 - 1470.40] this book is in the bio and the link for
[1468.88 - 1471.44] this book is in the description right
[1470.40 - 1473.68] there
[1471.44 - 1475.92] the life-saving book it has a history
[1473.68 - 1478.96] and street cred of saving lives millions
[1475.92 - 1481.36] of people have it around the world
[1478.96 - 1482.56] and amazon's selling it dirt cheap right
[1481.36 - 1484.48] now because they
[1482.56 - 1488.24] they i think they you know what i think
[1484.48 - 1490.24] it's angelic intervention personally i
[1488.24 - 1492.40] think at the same time maybe they're
[1490.24 - 1494.72] trying to price it so low that i don't
[1492.40 - 1496.88] i don't get my 10 cents for it but it
[1494.72 - 1498.48] doesn't matter you can go to you can go
[1496.88 - 1501.84] to the library and get it for free or
[1498.48 - 1504.40] amazon 51 off us but the point is it's a
[1501.84 - 1507.44] medical textbook critical information so
[1504.40 - 1508.32] what about propolis mixed in honey
[1507.44 - 1510.08] okay
[1508.32 - 1511.60] so it's in either way if someone takes
[1510.08 - 1513.44] propolis and they mix it in honey that
[1511.60 - 1514.96] means there must be alcohol or solvent
[1513.44 - 1517.76] in your honey
[1514.96 - 1519.68] i'd rather take a propolis that doesn't
[1517.76 - 1522.00] have a solvent or alcohol one that's
[1519.68 - 1523.52] high grade at the highest grade possible
[1522.00 - 1525.28] with active
[1523.52 - 1529.12] polyphenols
[1525.28 - 1531.36] and 120 milligrams per serving then
[1529.12 - 1533.60] actually take a honey that someone
[1531.36 - 1535.28] slapped in some alcohol and solvent
[1533.60 - 1536.56] propolis and mixed it into a whole bunch
[1535.28 - 1537.76] of honey
[1536.56 - 1539.12] that's just something i probably
[1537.76 - 1540.64] wouldn't want to do of course you do
[1539.12 - 1542.96] what you want to do
[1540.64 - 1544.08] right
[1542.96 - 1546.88] um
[1544.08 - 1550.16] lacey game says why
[1546.88 - 1552.32] i can have it too much how why i it when
[1550.16 - 1554.32] i have too much vitamin c it gives me
[1552.32 - 1555.76] canker sores
[1554.32 - 1557.76] what kind of vitamin c you have an
[1555.76 - 1559.36] ascorbic acid
[1557.76 - 1561.20] that's a whole other problem so let's
[1559.36 - 1564.00] talk about vitamin c just for a second
[1561.20 - 1566.16] because we we actually
[1564.00 - 1568.32] i'm just looking here at this
[1566.16 - 1570.16] okay so this is this is another reason
[1568.32 - 1572.96] why vimmergy does what they do so i just
[1570.16 - 1574.96] want to just run this by you guys
[1572.96 - 1578.00] vimergy doesn't
[1574.96 - 1579.76] package up ascorbic acid now i'm not
[1578.00 - 1581.76] going to name all the brands out there
[1579.76 - 1584.48] that have all ascorbic acid including
[1581.76 - 1587.68] that one that has a packet they got the
[1584.48 - 1591.76] packet so let me get my
[1587.68 - 1593.04] uh urgent packet out let me get my
[1591.76 - 1594.96] urgent
[1593.04 - 1597.04] packet out
[1594.96 - 1600.80] and they don't realize that urgent
[1597.04 - 1603.52] packet is garbage it's straight ascorbic
[1600.80 - 1605.68] acid of the cheap kind right
[1603.52 - 1608.48] straight ascorbic acid you take too much
[1605.68 - 1610.64] of straight ascorbic acid vitamin c and
[1608.48 - 1612.16] yeah you will literally you could you
[1610.64 - 1613.68] you could break out with canker swords
[1612.16 - 1616.72] you could get a stomach ulcer you can
[1613.68 - 1619.36] hurt your stomach right so the microc
[1616.72 - 1622.48] is not ascorbic acid so it's not all
[1619.36 - 1625.28] this it's not all ascorbic acid
[1622.48 - 1627.60] then that's the difference right there
[1625.28 - 1629.68] so the germ theory hoax layer which i am
[1627.60 - 1632.16] honored you were here because you tend
[1629.68 - 1633.76] to leave youtube comments like
[1632.16 - 1636.72] mmm really is
[1633.76 - 1638.08] stupid or mm is dumb
[1636.72 - 1640.24] and them is
[1638.08 - 1642.16] doesn't know what about anything and
[1640.24 - 1644.48] then does it know right so i'm honored
[1642.16 - 1646.32] to hear a germ theory hoax slayer
[1644.48 - 1648.08] so you say herbal products were made
[1646.32 - 1650.72] with alcohol for thousands of years and
[1648.08 - 1652.64] they worked really were you there
[1650.72 - 1654.24] because i'm i'm confused there were you
[1652.64 - 1655.84] there thousands of years why they worked
[1654.24 - 1659.36] or didn't work because everybody had a
[1655.84 - 1661.20] lifespan of 35 years old back then
[1659.36 - 1664.40] so i'm just curious how good did they
[1661.20 - 1666.48] work and who even had access to them
[1664.40 - 1668.96] that's what i'd like to know too right
[1666.48 - 1670.72] and here's another thing too
[1668.96 - 1672.72] was anybody up against the bugs we're up
[1670.72 - 1674.64] against today no they weren't there
[1672.72 - 1676.24] weren't any labs out there creating new
[1674.64 - 1677.76] bugs left and right and releasing them
[1676.24 - 1679.44] into the environment
[1677.76 - 1682.64] how many strains of herpetic family
[1679.44 - 1684.48] viruses were there then none
[1682.64 - 1686.32] none so we got all these engineered
[1684.48 - 1687.44] viruses now that are making everybody
[1686.32 - 1689.44] sick and making everybody have
[1687.44 - 1692.00] neurological symptoms
[1689.44 - 1694.56] they didn't have that back then
[1692.00 - 1696.48] that's a whole thing on its own and
[1694.56 - 1698.64] try not to get confused with thousands
[1696.48 - 1700.32] of years ago and that being like this
[1698.64 - 1702.08] blatant statement if it means everything
[1700.32 - 1704.64] worked a thousand years ago are you
[1702.08 - 1705.84] kidding emperors died of mercury
[1704.64 - 1707.76] poisoning
[1705.84 - 1710.00] emperors
[1707.76 - 1713.20] emperors in china
[1710.00 - 1715.12] emperors around the world kings
[1713.20 - 1717.36] in great britain
[1715.12 - 1718.64] died of mercury poisoning or went insane
[1717.36 - 1720.24] because of murky poison because they
[1718.64 - 1722.32] used to give them all they gave all the
[1720.24 - 1725.52] kings and queens and emperors
[1722.32 - 1727.12] they gave all the the ruling class a
[1725.52 - 1729.92] thousand years ago and more they gave
[1727.12 - 1732.24] them mercury tonics you got sick you
[1729.92 - 1734.64] were given a mercury tonic oh maybe they
[1732.24 - 1736.96] put alcohol in there too that's great
[1734.64 - 1739.44] they give you a mercury alcohol tonic
[1736.96 - 1742.24] and then you went completely insane
[1739.44 - 1744.00] that's actually known out there so let's
[1742.24 - 1746.16] kind of not get confused by everything
[1744.00 - 1748.32] so great a thousand years ago or 2 000
[1746.16 - 1750.72] years ago
[1748.32 - 1750.72] all right
[1751.20 - 1753.84] thank you
[1755.60 - 1758.80] all right let's go into this a little
[1756.80 - 1760.40] bit more you guys we're talking about
[1758.80 - 1762.24] cleanse the heel
[1760.40 - 1764.72] right here and that leads me to the
[1762.24 - 1767.04] whole copper thing too we won't go into
[1764.72 - 1769.12] it too deep but copper vats in india a
[1767.04 - 1771.20] thousand years ago to keep amoebas from
[1769.12 - 1772.56] not filtering you know taking over the
[1771.20 - 1774.48] water
[1772.56 - 1776.88] actually helped for as far as killing
[1774.48 - 1778.40] one amoeba but what people don't realize
[1776.88 - 1780.32] you got copper poisoning again you died
[1778.40 - 1782.48] at 50 years old or 40 years old copper
[1780.32 - 1784.56] poisoning so it's like okay let's we
[1782.48 - 1787.20] just got to kind of like we got to get a
[1784.56 - 1789.12] grasp about how things work out there
[1787.20 - 1790.64] got to get a grasp all right so we're in
[1789.12 - 1792.56] canker source i'm looking at different
[1790.64 - 1794.88] so goldenseal is an option right there
[1792.56 - 1797.28] so i got the golden seal goldenseal is
[1794.88 - 1798.64] another incredible
[1797.28 - 1800.80] supplement
[1798.64 - 1802.40] that's really important so when i when
[1800.80 - 1804.40] what happens is you have to realize when
[1802.40 - 1806.64] you go into like herpetic family viruses
[1804.40 - 1809.76] like shingles and herpes and cold sores
[1806.64 - 1812.32] and canker sores and epstein-barr
[1809.76 - 1815.20] you have to have the antivirals that's a
[1812.32 - 1816.56] big deal you have to have the antivirals
[1815.20 - 1819.52] that's the thing
[1816.56 - 1821.76] so when it comes down to that
[1819.52 - 1823.20] if you don't have the antivirals because
[1821.76 - 1824.64] that's what's happening with people
[1823.20 - 1827.84] people they're dealing with all these
[1824.64 - 1829.44] viral issues neurological problems you
[1827.84 - 1831.60] think people just magically have a
[1829.44 - 1833.12] neurological problem is it because of a
[1831.60 - 1834.88] past life like why do they have a
[1833.12 - 1837.20] neurological problem
[1834.88 - 1839.12] now why do they have severe severe brain
[1837.20 - 1840.88] fog and aches and pains their neck is
[1839.12 - 1842.24] killing them but nothing's really wrong
[1840.88 - 1844.72] with them why are they suffering with
[1842.24 - 1847.20] burning skin and vertigo and dizziness
[1844.72 - 1849.76] because they got these pathogens
[1847.20 - 1851.36] and these pathogens are causing problems
[1849.76 - 1853.04] so we have all these different pathogens
[1851.36 - 1854.88] we got the herpes cold sore virus that
[1853.04 - 1856.72] causes all that trigeminal neuralgia we
[1854.88 - 1859.28] got the shingles virus that creates all
[1856.72 - 1861.12] that trigeminal neuralgia too so these
[1859.28 - 1863.20] are herpetic families they sit inside
[1861.12 - 1866.24] the trigeminal nerves you guys they can
[1863.20 - 1868.64] actually sit inside the brain stem
[1866.24 - 1871.60] is what they do so
[1868.64 - 1873.68] what we're doing right now is we're
[1871.60 - 1876.72] talking about
[1873.68 - 1878.64] ways to deal with that now part of my
[1876.72 - 1879.76] time is teaching doctors just so you
[1878.64 - 1883.84] know okay
[1879.76 - 1883.84] so part of my time is teaching doctors
[1885.44 - 1889.44] so i have conversations with doctors on
[1887.52 - 1891.52] the phone okay
[1889.44 - 1892.40] and in meetings
[1891.52 - 1894.32] about
[1892.40 - 1895.52] why people are sick
[1894.32 - 1896.80] so they're learning now and they're
[1895.52 - 1898.96] learning more and more about these
[1896.80 - 1900.96] neurological conditions the brain stem
[1898.96 - 1903.36] inflaming and doctors didn't know your
[1900.96 - 1905.60] brain stem can get inflamed
[1903.36 - 1907.36] that's actually recently as far as i'm
[1905.60 - 1908.88] teaching doctors that stuff i've tried
[1907.36 - 1911.76] to teach that throughout the years about
[1908.88 - 1913.68] the vagus nerves brain stem right but
[1911.76 - 1915.52] it's kind of brand new for everybody
[1913.68 - 1917.52] when your brain stem is inflamed and
[1915.52 - 1920.32] your vagus nerve is inflamed and your
[1917.52 - 1922.08] vestibular nerves inflamed and facial
[1920.32 - 1924.08] nerves inflamed all these are inflamed
[1922.08 - 1925.36] all these cranial nerves you get all
[1924.08 - 1927.44] these problems you get the ticks and
[1925.36 - 1929.84] spasms and the aches and pains and the
[1927.44 - 1931.28] jabbing pain and the popping in the ear
[1929.84 - 1933.12] and the ringing in the ear and the
[1931.28 - 1934.80] dizziness and you get the balance issues
[1933.12 - 1936.72] in the tight tightened chest where you
[1934.80 - 1938.40] can't breathe
[1936.72 - 1939.60] you just can't breathe you don't know
[1938.40 - 1941.60] what it is and you don't know if you're
[1939.60 - 1943.84] having anxiety attack or not these are
[1941.60 - 1945.04] inflamed nerves right
[1943.84 - 1946.24] and that's what they are if you guys
[1945.04 - 1947.92] just came on here talking about
[1946.24 - 1949.44] neurological symptoms now we covered
[1947.92 - 1951.12] canker sores please watch this from the
[1949.44 - 1952.64] beginning when you get a chance covered
[1951.12 - 1954.88] what to do with canker sores and cold
[1952.64 - 1956.16] source and herpes simplex cold sores
[1954.88 - 1957.76] so and we're talking about
[1956.16 - 1959.20] supplementation what you see in front of
[1957.76 - 1961.12] me is vemorgy products that i'm not
[1959.20 - 1962.40] sponsored so this isn't the kind of
[1961.12 - 1964.80] thing where it's just the best stuff
[1962.40 - 1966.64] that's out there so if i was to hide the
[1964.80 - 1968.16] best stuff that was out there and didn't
[1966.64 - 1969.60] want to show it how would anybody
[1968.16 - 1972.24] actually get
[1969.60 - 1974.48] like that chance to actually really heal
[1972.24 - 1976.88] in so many ways let's cover shingles a
[1974.48 - 1978.64] little bit shingles likes to sit
[1976.88 - 1980.24] in the spinal nerves it likes to sit in
[1978.64 - 1983.12] the sciatic nerve it likes to sit in the
[1980.24 - 1984.72] lumbar so people have a lot of shingles
[1983.12 - 1987.12] viruses there's different varieties over
[1984.72 - 1988.96] 30 varieties of shingles viruses right
[1987.12 - 1991.04] shingles will create a lot of problems
[1988.96 - 1993.04] like that neuropathy issue
[1991.04 - 1994.32] plantar fasciitis
[1993.04 - 1996.96] neuropathy
[1994.32 - 1998.16] pain down the leg piriformis issues a
[1996.96 - 2000.40] lot of people out there they'll have
[1998.16 - 2002.40] piriformis problems right they'd be like
[2000.40 - 2004.88] i don't know what it is but i just can't
[2002.40 - 2007.12] i can't do anything i can't walk right i
[2004.88 - 2008.64] got this piriformis problem these are
[2007.12 - 2010.72] all nerves that get inflamed by the
[2008.64 - 2013.28] shingles virus right there a lot of
[2010.72 - 2014.56] people have the epstein bar and shingles
[2013.28 - 2017.20] and people who are sick with like
[2014.56 - 2019.28] neurological lyme and ms and a lot of in
[2017.20 - 2021.44] lupus and they have all these sets of
[2019.28 - 2022.88] symptoms they get the vertigo one day
[2021.44 - 2025.28] they get the ringing in the ears they
[2022.88 - 2026.80] get the back pain they get the tingles
[2025.28 - 2029.12] and numbness they get the tightness of
[2026.80 - 2031.28] the chest they got more than just one
[2029.12 - 2033.12] bug they'll have an epstein bar and a
[2031.28 - 2036.08] shingles
[2033.12 - 2038.08] it's mm school today
[2036.08 - 2040.56] so they'll have epsine bar they'll have
[2038.08 - 2042.40] shingles they might have a simplex so
[2040.56 - 2043.92] here's what happens people walk around
[2042.40 - 2046.00] and they'll have one or two simplex
[2043.92 - 2047.52] viruses they'll have that are sitting
[2046.00 - 2049.28] inside their trigeminal nerve they'll
[2047.52 - 2050.96] have an epstein bar they'll have maybe
[2049.28 - 2053.28] two epstein bars they'll have a shingles
[2050.96 - 2056.08] virus and to boot they might even have a
[2053.28 - 2057.92] cytomegalovirus or an hhv6 and sometimes
[2056.08 - 2059.44] these viruses move up and people have
[2057.92 - 2061.84] problems and sometimes these viruses
[2059.44 - 2063.28] move down and they they survive
[2061.84 - 2065.52] meaning like they get through their day
[2063.28 - 2067.36] but but it's this ebb and flow of this
[2065.52 - 2069.36] immune system thing and that's why it's
[2067.36 - 2072.32] critical that for instance like that
[2069.36 - 2074.16] propolis is such a breakthrough
[2072.32 - 2077.28] so kelly says i have shingles now what
[2074.16 - 2077.28] can i take for the paint
[2077.60 - 2080.48] i'm going to move this over here
[2079.60 - 2081.68] yeah
[2080.48 - 2084.40] so
[2081.68 - 2086.48] i talk about shingles in medical medium
[2084.40 - 2088.40] book one new edition right here
[2086.48 - 2090.40] kelly can take the book to your doctor
[2088.40 - 2093.68] so you're on facebook right there right
[2090.40 - 2095.44] so if i had shingles all right
[2093.68 - 2097.44] i talk about it in here i talk about
[2095.44 - 2098.64] what it does and also
[2097.44 - 2100.16] in
[2098.64 - 2101.68] cleanse the heel so let me give you a
[2100.16 - 2104.40] protocol and cleanse the heel right here
[2101.68 - 2105.76] in shingles so you have it
[2104.40 - 2107.60] so we're going to find the shingle
[2105.76 - 2109.20] section so i'm in a single section now i
[2107.60 - 2110.80] want to get a close-up on it real quick
[2109.20 - 2112.40] just to show you that it's in the book
[2110.80 - 2113.92] even if it's blurry at least you know
[2112.40 - 2116.08] it's here so i'm trying to get
[2113.92 - 2118.32] everything on here we go got a lot going
[2116.08 - 2120.32] on moving parts so there it is it's hard
[2118.32 - 2123.84] to see it's blurry but there's jingles
[2120.32 - 2123.84] now i'm going to move it up whoa
[2124.72 - 2128.64] it's just about bringing it up higher so
[2127.12 - 2130.24] do you guys see that
[2128.64 - 2132.56] now in tick tock you probably don't see
[2130.24 - 2135.12] it so much right
[2132.56 - 2137.12] can you guys read that
[2135.12 - 2138.56] so it says true cause the shingles virus
[2137.12 - 2140.40] is the true cause of trigeminal
[2138.56 - 2142.16] neuralgia
[2140.40 - 2145.28] so think about that a little bit like
[2142.16 - 2148.08] your teeth quenching your teeth grinding

[2160.72 - 2164.40] shoulder that so many people get that's
[2162.64 - 2168.48] the shingles virus in their system but
[2164.40 - 2169.60] nobody knows it ulcerative colitis
[2168.48 - 2172.72] right there
[2169.60 - 2175.36] many cases of neck pain jaw pain
[2172.72 - 2176.96] gum and tooth pain tongue pain burning
[2175.36 - 2179.44] sensations inside the mouth burning
[2176.96 - 2180.88] sensations on the skin pain in the back
[2179.44 - 2183.76] of the head
[2180.88 - 2185.04] some migraine related pain mystery
[2183.76 - 2187.36] sciatica
[2185.04 - 2189.92] mystery lower back pain
[2187.36 - 2192.08] neuropathy and a stagnant sluggish liver
[2189.92 - 2194.16] there are shingles infections without
[2192.08 - 2195.84] rashes and rashes and there are over 30
[2194.16 - 2198.72] varieties of shingles all but one
[2195.84 - 2200.16] undiscovered seath shingles chapter in
[2198.72 - 2202.24] medical medium book i was just showing
[2200.16 - 2204.08] you too now there's
[2202.24 - 2206.56] a supplement protocol right there just
[2204.08 - 2206.56] so you know
[2207.44 - 2211.44] and i'm in there
[2209.36 - 2213.28] okay so let's go over let's go over it a
[2211.44 - 2214.72] little bit so it says fresh celery juice
[2213.28 - 2216.00] is one thing it says right there in the
[2214.72 - 2217.92] protocol
[2216.00 - 2220.24] so
[2217.92 - 2222.64] i got a celery juice right here there's
[2220.24 - 2224.32] one right here fresh celery juice that's
[2222.64 - 2226.40] in the protocol now understand you don't
[2224.32 - 2228.88] have to do full protocols in here you
[2226.40 - 2231.28] can customize medical medium information
[2228.88 - 2233.84] isn't one size fits all it's an answer
[2231.28 - 2235.92] to why we're sick but you can do what's
[2233.84 - 2237.36] what you feel like you can do you can
[2235.92 - 2239.60] take your healing as far as you want to
[2237.36 - 2241.36] go but here's why everybody's so
[2239.60 - 2243.04] different besides the fact that their
[2241.36 - 2244.88] souls are different and unique
[2243.04 - 2247.20] everybody's soul is unique another
[2244.88 - 2248.96] reason why people are unique is someone
[2247.20 - 2250.32] may have two or three viruses of a
[2248.96 - 2252.08] different kind another person may have
[2250.32 - 2253.60] only one another person may have a whole
[2252.08 - 2255.60] bunch of streptococcus another person
[2253.60 - 2257.28] may have heavy metals and that another
[2255.60 - 2259.28] person may have one type of metal not
[2257.28 - 2260.32] the other it goes on forever and ever
[2259.28 - 2262.00] and ever
[2260.32 - 2263.68] is different varieties of bugs different
[2262.00 - 2265.84] varieties of metals different varieties
[2263.68 - 2267.68] of toxins and then what happens is
[2265.84 - 2270.08] everybody's got a mix of all this stuff
[2267.68 - 2272.40] a whole hush pasha mix about with all
[2270.08 - 2274.56] this stuff okay and different viruses
[2272.40 - 2276.32] have different aggression too so
[2274.56 - 2278.24] everybody's different with what's ailing
[2276.32 - 2280.64] them so you can customize and go as far
[2278.24 - 2282.24] as you need to go so in the shingles
[2280.64 - 2284.08] chapter right here
[2282.24 - 2286.00] it says aloe vera is something you can
[2284.08 - 2288.40] take two or more inches a fresh gel
[2286.00 - 2289.92] removed cat's claw is another one so
[2288.40 - 2292.40] let's look for the cat's claw i was just
[2289.92 - 2294.32] grabbing the wrong one right there so
[2292.40 - 2297.28] i think we got the cat's claw somewhere
[2294.32 - 2297.28] or it's over here
[2297.68 - 2301.44] got the cat's claw right here okay so
[2300.08 - 2303.44] i'll give you a close-up on the cat's
[2301.44 - 2305.84] claw
[2303.44 - 2307.44] cat's claw okay
[2305.84 - 2309.04] is make or break for somebody with
[2307.44 - 2310.80] neurological line
[2309.04 - 2313.28] that's make or break
[2310.80 - 2315.52] that's an important one right there
[2313.28 - 2317.12] someone's really suffering okay that's
[2315.52 - 2319.04] the vimorgy cat's claw though there's a
[2317.12 - 2322.32] difference if you run out you go by a
[2319.04 - 2324.16] cat's claw i can't say yeah okay yeah
[2322.32 - 2325.60] could help a little maybe not so i'll
[2324.16 - 2328.00] show you guys on tick tock right that's
[2325.60 - 2330.24] a cat's claw okay
[2328.00 - 2330.24] so
[2333.44 - 2337.00] let's see here
[2344.24 - 2347.12] so i'm backing guys
[2348.00 - 2351.36] so all right i showed you the cat's claw
[2349.76 - 2353.12] so back in the shingles right here says
[2351.36 - 2356.08] cats call it two dropper foals twice a
[2353.12 - 2357.52] day so two dropper folds twice a day and
[2356.08 - 2358.88] you got your little shot glass right
[2357.52 - 2360.88] here you can put your dropper holes
[2358.88 - 2365.56] right in the shot glass you can probably
[2360.88 - 2365.56] catch this on a close-up right here
[2376.72 - 2381.00] okay we got a close-up right there
[2383.84 - 2387.36] so i just did two dropper folds you add
[2385.92 - 2388.80] a little bit of water
[2387.36 - 2390.08] and then you got it in your shot glass
[2388.80 - 2391.68] so i just showed you guys right here in
[2390.08 - 2393.52] tick tock right
[2391.68 - 2397.08] okay
[2393.52 - 2397.08] and there it is
[2397.44 - 2400.32] so
[2398.16 - 2402.80] i'm giving an example now if you if you
[2400.32 - 2404.48] read this chapter you'll see before for
[2402.80 - 2405.84] all the protocols you'll see hey you can
[2404.48 - 2408.48] start with just a couple of different
[2405.84 - 2411.28] things you can start with b12
[2408.48 - 2413.60] to give yourself then the nerve food i
[2411.28 - 2416.24] call it like nerve food central nervous
[2413.60 - 2417.60] system needs the b12 so that's something
[2416.24 - 2420.40] you can start with right there where
[2417.60 - 2422.16] it's b12 all on its own if you look in
[2420.40 - 2425.28] the shingle section
[2422.16 - 2427.84] right you'll see b12 three dropper folds
[2425.28 - 2429.84] twice a day so a lot of people have that
[2427.84 - 2431.20] sciatic nerve pain they have that
[2429.84 - 2433.76] different the different neurological
[2431.20 - 2436.08] symptoms so it's critical that the b12
[2433.76 - 2437.84] gets in their system right so you can
[2436.08 - 2439.76] take it slow you can literally take it
[2437.84 - 2441.20] with some salt you can take celery juice
[2439.76 - 2442.80] you can start with that you can work
[2441.20 - 2444.80] your way up you can work your way up in
[2442.80 - 2447.20] dosages you can start with a small
[2444.80 - 2448.96] amount of b12 it says three dropper
[2447.20 - 2451.12] falls twice a day you can start with a
[2448.96 - 2453.12] small amount you can customize it and
[2451.12 - 2455.12] work to where you're at and build
[2453.12 - 2456.96] yourself up that's how incredible it is
[2455.12 - 2459.28] what's the name of the book
[2456.96 - 2461.36] it's called cleanse the heel right here
[2459.28 - 2463.04] that's the name all right medical medium
[2461.36 - 2464.56] cleanse the heel
[2463.04 - 2468.08] it's a medical textbook get it free at
[2464.56 - 2470.96] the library or amazon.com 51 off it's
[2468.08 - 2472.64] only 16 there in the us
[2470.96 - 2474.88] and we're doing protocols watch this
[2472.64 - 2476.96] from the beginning too someone said uh
[2474.88 - 2479.68] the b12 is life changing you take in
[2476.96 - 2481.92] michelle l says i take a lot of b12 i
[2479.68 - 2485.12] take a lot of b12 too you're on uh
[2481.92 - 2486.24] you're on twitch incredible
[2485.12 - 2489.20] so
[2486.24 - 2491.04] i take a lot of b12 too i do i take i
[2489.20 - 2492.48] take three four dropper fulls twice a
[2491.04 - 2494.00] day sometimes i'll take two dropper
[2492.48 - 2495.76] fulls twice a day
[2494.00 - 2497.28] rennes says that cleanse the heel is
[2495.76 - 2499.60] your bible
[2497.28 - 2501.68] i'm honored that's
[2499.60 - 2503.68] quite serious
[2501.68 - 2505.28] so jackie says i love the b12 right
[2503.68 - 2506.72] there too you can't wait to try the
[2505.28 - 2508.72] alisa henry says can't wait to try the
[2506.72 - 2509.60] propolis so you guys we're talking about
[2508.72 - 2511.44] shingles we're talking about
[2509.60 - 2513.68] neurological symptoms we're talking
[2511.44 - 2515.76] about herpes simplex canker sores herpes
[2513.68 - 2517.28] simplex one two talk about all the
[2515.76 - 2519.28] different symptoms people are dealing
[2517.28 - 2521.28] with so what happens is right now the
[2519.28 - 2522.64] neurological symptoms are exploding and
[2521.28 - 2524.16] everybody's just filing into their
[2522.64 - 2526.16] doctor's offices with the tightness of
[2524.16 - 2528.24] the chest they can't breathe right the
[2526.16 - 2530.48] pain the dizziness the burning skin the
[2528.24 - 2531.68] jaw pain the neck pain the back pain the
[2530.48 - 2533.76] fatigue
[2531.68 - 2535.60] and also like the brain fox all these
[2533.76 - 2537.20] neurological symptoms so we're talking
[2535.60 - 2538.24] about like game changers that's the
[2537.20 - 2540.72] propolis
[2538.24 - 2542.24] that's the new like the new game changer
[2540.72 - 2544.08] it's a whole new level there's no
[2542.24 - 2545.92] propolis out there like that i'm not
[2544.08 - 2548.16] sponsored just talking about that it's
[2545.92 - 2550.48] talking about how ascorbic acid the
[2548.16 - 2552.64] vitamin c from vimergy is not ascorbic
[2550.48 - 2554.08] acid how ascorbic acid can burn a hole
[2552.64 - 2555.84] in people's stomach like make them feel
[2554.08 - 2558.48] really sick in their stomach
[2555.84 - 2560.08] or trigger something else like trigger
[2558.48 - 2562.48] off a canker sore or something because
[2560.08 - 2565.44] it's so acidic it just eats away the
[2562.48 - 2568.16] linings right so that's why i don't like
[2565.44 - 2569.68] ascorbic acid vitamin c so a lot of
[2568.16 - 2571.60] people will make a mistake and they'll
[2569.68 - 2574.56] take just straight ascorbic acid vitamin
[2571.60 - 2576.64] c whether it's in that that you know
[2574.56 - 2580.00] other other varieties too where they mix
[2576.64 - 2582.08] fat lipids in it which is a bad idea all
[2580.00 - 2584.00] of it either way it's not great and it's
[2582.08 - 2585.92] hard on the system
[2584.00 - 2587.20] so we're going i'm going through here
[2585.92 - 2588.72] shingles a little bit more because
[2587.20 - 2590.00] people have shingles more than they know
[2588.72 - 2592.40] and they have problems more than they
[2590.00 - 2593.68] know because of shingles right so i'm
[2592.40 - 2595.52] going into a couple other things
[2593.68 - 2597.84] licorice root that's another big one
[2595.52 - 2599.52] right there licorice root is an
[2597.84 - 2600.88] important one so i'll show you right
[2599.52 - 2603.76] here close up
[2600.88 - 2604.72] and the licorice root
[2603.76 - 2607.60] now
[2604.72 - 2610.48] licorice root and viruses don't get
[2607.60 - 2613.76] along so what happens is licorice root
[2610.48 - 2616.00] tends to get viruses sluggish and docile
[2613.76 - 2618.04] and they can't handle licorice root the
[2616.00 - 2620.72] phytochemical compounds
[2618.04 - 2622.80] intoxicate viruses the ones that are in
[2620.72 - 2624.56] licorice root so that's why it's a great
[2622.80 - 2626.72] antiviral
[2624.56 - 2627.92] and that's why it's really helpful for
[2626.72 - 2629.60] all kinds of different things that we
[2627.92 - 2632.00] deal with that are neurological symptoms
[2629.60 - 2633.52] and viral symptoms neurological lyme i
[2632.00 - 2634.56] see neurological line but here's the
[2633.52 - 2636.64] irony
[2634.56 - 2638.80] if you go to a lyme doctor which is
[2636.64 - 2640.56] tingles and numbness
[2638.80 - 2642.96] and a little fatigue and brain fog
[2640.56 - 2645.60] you're walking out with a lime patch on
[2642.96 - 2647.84] your back like a lime sticker on your
[2645.60 - 2649.84] on your hand a lime bracelet a lime
[2647.84 - 2651.84] diagnosis whatever you're going to be
[2649.84 - 2653.92] walking out of the lyme doctor's office
[2651.84 - 2655.92] with a lyme diagnosis so if you go into
[2653.92 - 2656.96] a lyme doctor's office all you need is
[2655.92 - 2658.00] just
[2656.96 - 2659.92] fatigue
[2658.00 - 2662.80] tingles and numbness if you go this is
[2659.92 - 2666.00] he was really crazy too if you go into a
[2662.80 - 2667.36] gynecologist's office
[2666.00 - 2669.36] and you go in there with fatigue and
[2667.36 - 2670.88] brain fog you'll walk out with a pcos
[2669.36 - 2673.28] diagnosis even if they didn't find
[2670.88 - 2675.04] fluid-filled cysts in your ovaries
[2673.28 - 2677.52] you'll walk out with pcos i mean it all
[2675.04 - 2679.36] depends on what they specialize in
[2677.52 - 2681.04] two that's how crazy that is if you walk
[2679.36 - 2682.72] into a multiple sclerosis doctor's
[2681.04 - 2684.08] office then you've got tingles and
[2682.72 - 2685.68] numbness and aches and pains and
[2684.08 - 2688.08] dizziness and vertigo you're walking out
[2685.68 - 2689.92] with an ms diagnosis
[2688.08 - 2692.16] i mean that that's that's also you know
[2689.92 - 2693.36] like so when i say neurological line
[2692.16 - 2695.20] people walk around with all the
[2693.36 - 2697.76] neurological lyme symptoms all day long
[2695.20 - 2699.44] they got back pain they got leg pain
[2697.76 - 2701.12] they got tingles and numbness they got
[2699.44 - 2702.96] weakness in the limbs
[2701.12 - 2704.56] they got confusion they got brain fog
[2702.96 - 2706.00] they're walking around with neurological
[2704.56 - 2707.84] lyme dye you know like all they have to
[2706.00 - 2709.44] do is just bump into a lime doctor and
[2707.84 - 2711.36] on the subway
[2709.44 - 2713.84] you got lyme disease
[2711.36 - 2716.40] really what's happening is no
[2713.84 - 2718.80] you have low grade viral infections
[2716.40 - 2721.12] or higher grade viral infections
[2718.80 - 2723.36] chronic viral infections bacterial
[2721.12 - 2725.36] infections too like streptococcus can
[2723.36 - 2727.36] add to it but mostly the viral
[2725.36 - 2730.16] infections the trigeminal neuralgia
[2727.36 - 2732.96] viruses the back pain viruses all the
[2730.16 - 2735.52] shingles all the herpes all the ebv
[2732.96 - 2737.60] stuff cindy reeves says is propolis good
[2735.52 - 2738.96] for tinnitus if i had tinnitus i'd be
[2737.60 - 2740.72] taking propolis if i had any
[2738.96 - 2743.52] neurological symptom i would be taking
[2740.72 - 2744.88] propolis definitely okay
[2743.52 - 2746.64] that's what i would be doing that's the
[2744.88 - 2749.68] licorice right there but if i had
[2746.64 - 2751.12] tinnitus yeah i would take propyl so
[2749.68 - 2753.36] now if you look in cleanse of healing
[2751.12 - 2756.00] you don't see propolis in a lot of the
[2753.36 - 2757.84] symptoms and conditions right list one
[2756.00 - 2760.64] reason is because the propolises that
[2757.84 - 2762.32] have been out there they're hard on
[2760.64 - 2764.56] people who are really sensitive so i
[2762.32 - 2767.28] only had to use them where i had to use
[2764.56 - 2769.44] them where i had to use them i recommend
[2767.28 - 2770.80] them but now that there's a propolis
[2769.44 - 2772.64] that i don't have to worry about
[2770.80 - 2774.40] sensitivities for people now it's just
[2772.64 - 2776.24] like whoa yeah anybody with the
[2774.40 - 2778.96] neurological autoimmune all of it
[2776.24 - 2780.32] propolis is fantastic for right
[2778.96 - 2782.56] so yeah
[2780.32 - 2784.32] this is all important information
[2782.56 - 2785.52] so if you if you i could give you a
[2784.32 - 2787.12] quick rundown on some of the
[2785.52 - 2788.72] supplementation here right i talked
[2787.12 - 2790.88] about the vitamin c a little bit this is
[2788.72 - 2792.72] the ly scene right here okay
[2790.88 - 2795.76] so high quality all i seen is great for
[2792.72 - 2797.44] viruses too andy and anthony good handle
[2795.76 - 2799.92] i'm frustrated with all the different
[2797.44 - 2801.52] diagnoses tests appointments and all the
[2799.92 - 2803.04] different medications and i don't blame
[2801.52 - 2805.20] you one bit
[2803.04 - 2806.32] i wish i just had one answer and one
[2805.20 - 2808.64] solution
[2806.32 - 2810.80] i could completely understand a lot of
[2808.64 - 2813.92] people have gone to 10 or 20 doctors and
[2810.80 - 2816.24] 50 doctors and it's what i saw all day
[2813.92 - 2819.84] every day for seven days a week in my
[2816.24 - 2821.52] office back years ago for decades it's
[2819.84 - 2823.44] people that went to 50 doctors again
[2821.52 - 2824.96] remember people don't go and see the
[2823.44 - 2826.16] medical medium
[2824.96 - 2827.92] because
[2826.16 - 2829.76] because for whatever reason they go
[2827.92 - 2830.56] because they've actually exhausted every
[2829.76 - 2831.92] other
[2830.56 - 2833.28] angle and
[2831.92 - 2834.72] bent have rather docked around the
[2833.28 - 2836.72] planet i mean why would you see the
[2834.72 - 2839.04] medical medium unless you weren't
[2836.72 - 2840.56] desperate i mean people billionaires and
[2839.04 - 2842.40] wealthy people around the globe flying
[2840.56 - 2844.56] their private jets to try to get a
[2842.40 - 2847.12] chance to talk to me because they had
[2844.56 - 2849.44] the best doctors in the world to see but
[2847.12 - 2851.12] they still couldn't get better and so
[2849.44 - 2853.20] that's when you go and knock on the
[2851.12 - 2854.80] medical mediums door
[2853.20 - 2856.40] right i mean that's and it's also why i
[2854.80 - 2858.56] get so much hate it's like i gotta kick
[2856.40 - 2860.80] me sign on the on my back because of
[2858.56 - 2862.32] that michelle l says labels aren't
[2860.80 - 2864.96] answers and that's the thing if you get
[2862.32 - 2866.56] a fibromyalgia diagnosis it's not really
[2864.96 - 2868.56] a diagnosis
[2866.56 - 2869.92] it's a label that someone else will give
[2868.56 - 2871.76] you but someone else might give you a
[2869.92 - 2873.84] lupus one someone else might give you an
[2871.76 - 2876.00] autoimmune one someone else might give
[2873.84 - 2877.76] you a lime one it's just exactly what
[2876.00 - 2880.16] they but really what's happening is you
[2877.76 - 2882.72] have these low-grade viral infections
[2880.16 - 2884.08] sarah bear your info healed my vaginal
[2882.72 - 2885.44] shingles

[2885.44 - 2889.44] vaginal shingles up throughout the years

[2958.32 - 2961.12] opportunity to heal alexandra sophia
[2960.08 - 2962.32] says hey
[2961.12 - 2964.64] i had
[2962.32 - 2966.72] been to doctors and specialists for 12
[2964.64 - 2968.48] years chasing my tail into a medical
[2966.72 - 2970.40] medium nothing worked until medical
[2968.48 - 2973.60] medium to heal i'm honored you're here
[2970.40 - 2975.84] bless your heart it's so great
[2973.60 - 2977.36] and it's so sad when
[2975.84 - 2978.80] people don't realize that out there and
[2977.36 - 2980.48] they just love to do a hit job in
[2978.80 - 2982.08] medical meeting because
[2980.48 - 2983.76] they just don't like hearing medical
[2982.08 - 2986.24] medium all the time out there in the
[2983.76 - 2987.12] health world and just starts to bother
[2986.24 - 2988.72] people
[2987.12 - 2990.40] so let's go into the more supplement
[2988.72 - 2992.40] land on how this works so i was in
[2990.40 - 2993.92] shingle shingles is a big one so many
[2992.40 - 2995.52] people have shingles
[2993.92 - 2997.28] and so many people have like herpes
[2995.52 - 2998.80] simplex one like i was saying in two
[2997.28 - 3000.88] without realizing it but we're in
[2998.80 - 3002.88] shingles right now so i want to cut into
[3000.88 - 3005.20] it lysine is critical for shingles all
[3002.88 - 3007.04] on its own so it says here right so
[3005.20 - 3008.96] that's the vimergy lysine six capsules
[3007.04 - 3011.04] twice a day you can be somebody you
[3008.96 - 3012.96] could do one capsule twice a day
[3011.04 - 3015.36] you can start with one capsule once a
[3012.96 - 3016.24] day you can start with one capsule a
[3015.36 - 3018.32] week
[3016.24 - 3020.48] you can do what you feel is right for
[3018.32 - 3022.72] you to build up and that's really
[3020.48 - 3025.44] important deegan allison good to see you
[3022.72 - 3027.52] exactly it's just the label
[3025.44 - 3029.28] good to see you here so yeah i mean on
[3027.52 - 3031.76] youtube right
[3029.28 - 3033.84] so lysine's right here so that's an
[3031.76 - 3036.00] option nettle leaf is a good one too so
[3033.84 - 3038.32] then we got the nettle leaf right
[3036.00 - 3040.48] so nettle leaf is a great
[3038.32 - 3041.84] herb as well so what i love about nettle
[3040.48 - 3044.00] leaf it has anti-inflammatory
[3041.84 - 3045.28] phytochemical compounds
[3044.00 - 3047.68] and
[3045.28 - 3049.44] even though it's probably not out there
[3047.68 - 3051.36] yet or maybe they finally talked about
[3049.44 - 3053.84] it out there but it's anti-viral on a
[3051.36 - 3054.96] mild level but i love nettle leaf
[3053.84 - 3057.36] because it's incredible for the
[3054.96 - 3059.28] reproductive system so i want to go into
[3057.36 - 3060.56] hair loss for women for a minute if you
[3059.28 - 3062.48] guys
[3060.56 - 3064.08] if you guys got a second right so what
[3062.48 - 3065.60] you're going to see coming up and women
[3064.08 - 3067.92] have always struggled with hair loss out
[3065.60 - 3070.24] there but what you're going to see
[3067.92 - 3071.84] coming up is in a massive explosion of
[3070.24 - 3074.48] hair loss for women and that's going to
[3071.84 - 3076.72] be in this next you know five years so
[3074.48 - 3078.24] it's going to be a massive problem
[3076.72 - 3079.52] and and you're going to see more and
[3078.24 - 3081.44] more and
[3079.52 - 3083.36] junky hair skin nail supplements just
[3081.44 - 3085.20] don't work they never did
[3083.36 - 3086.88] they never will they're just kind of
[3085.20 - 3087.84] like one of that stuff where you see
[3086.88 - 3090.32] hair
[3087.84 - 3092.56] skin nails and then as a woman you're
[3090.32 - 3094.48] like well i don't like my hair right now
[3092.56 - 3096.16] i don't like my skin right now and i
[3094.48 - 3098.56] don't like my nails right now so i'm
[3096.16 - 3099.92] gonna buy that hair skin nail supplement
[3098.56 - 3101.64] so that's how they do it it's an
[3099.92 - 3103.44] industry designed on
[3101.64 - 3105.60] psychologically
[3103.44 - 3107.52] trying to crack women that's what it is
[3105.60 - 3109.60] so the hair skin nail supplements are
[3107.52 - 3111.52] it's just it's just rigged it's rigged
[3109.60 - 3113.60] to just gaslight women that's what hair
[3111.52 - 3117.60] skin nail supplements have always been
[3113.60 - 3119.84] it's just a total gas lighting right so
[3117.60 - 3123.04] and this is what they've always done
[3119.84 - 3124.80] but what's happening is if you really
[3123.04 - 3126.48] understand hair loss or hair thinning
[3124.80 - 3128.40] and you go in here and you go into like

[3198.32 - 3201.36] tick tock talking about hair thinning
[3199.68 - 3203.68] for women
[3201.36 - 3205.44] kelsey box says my hair my hair loss
[3203.68 - 3206.72] grew back after medical medium
[3205.44 - 3208.08] information
[3206.72 - 3210.40] there's a couple of things to know about
[3208.08 - 3212.16] hair loss and medical medium information
[3210.40 - 3213.68] kelsey bach on youtube hey you made the
[3212.16 - 3215.52] live sometimes you miss it remember and
[3213.68 - 3216.80] then you leave a comment saying i missed
[3215.52 - 3218.40] live
[3216.80 - 3220.32] okay so
[3218.40 - 3221.84] there's a lot of people a lot of women
[3220.32 - 3223.12] that come into the medical medium
[3221.84 - 3225.28] community and don't know it but they're
[3223.12 - 3227.36] about to lose their hair
[3225.28 - 3228.40] okay they had something happen in their
[3227.36 - 3230.08] life
[3228.40 - 3232.56] like they had something happen in the
[3230.08 - 3235.20] last nine months like severe stress over
[3232.56 - 3237.92] the plague we just went through
[3235.20 - 3240.32] maybe they caught a flu
[3237.92 - 3241.52] like four months ago and don't realize
[3240.32 - 3243.92] it but they're gonna get the hair
[3241.52 - 3244.80] thinning and hair loss later on
[3243.92 - 3246.80] okay
[3244.80 - 3247.92] a lot of women also have then maybe they
[3246.80 - 3249.52] have
[3247.92 - 3252.48] a stressful moment
[3249.52 - 3254.96] betrayal a relationship breakup
[3252.48 - 3258.24] relationship breakups are
[3254.96 - 3259.52] infamous for hair thinning afterwards
[3258.24 - 3261.84] childbirth
[3259.52 - 3263.36] right a lot of women they give birth to
[3261.84 - 3264.80] a child
[3263.36 - 3267.12] three months later they're losing all
[3264.80 - 3268.32] their hair now if they for some reason
[3267.12 - 3269.76] just got into the medical medium
[3268.32 - 3271.68] community and started drinking celery
[3269.76 - 3273.44] juice for the first time
[3271.68 - 3274.88] they'd be like oh my god is my hair
[3273.44 - 3277.20] thinning because i just drank celery
[3274.88 - 3280.00] juice hair thinning happens when
[3277.20 - 3282.16] something in your life a year before was
[3280.00 - 3283.68] involved or nine months before and if
[3282.16 - 3285.76] you're coming into medical medium and
[3283.68 - 3288.16] you're doing things you're slowing down
[3285.76 - 3289.12] the hair loss and you're saving your
[3288.16 - 3290.80] hair
[3289.12 - 3292.96] that's why so many people who are in the
[3290.80 - 3295.12] medical meeting community with hair loss
[3292.96 - 3296.88] right women they actually get their hair
[3295.12 - 3298.40] back if they stick with the protocols
[3296.88 - 3299.92] and they work on it
[3298.40 - 3301.12] so
[3299.92 - 3302.88] right here
[3301.12 - 3304.64] okay we're in hair thinning and hair
[3302.88 - 3307.12] loss and you see ashwagandha three
[3304.64 - 3309.68] dropper folds twice a day
[3307.12 - 3312.08] and that's the vimergy ashwagandha so
[3309.68 - 3314.00] that's that's the best one out there
[3312.08 - 3316.00] okay it's only one i trust because
[3314.00 - 3318.00] ashwagandhas are filled with toxic heavy
[3316.00 - 3319.92] metals lots of heavy metals so
[3318.00 - 3320.88] ashwagandha supplements are loaded with
[3319.92 - 3322.88] metals
[3320.88 - 3324.40] and i can't trust any of them
[3322.88 - 3325.36] and metals is just one thing they're
[3324.40 - 3327.60] loaded with they're loaded with
[3325.36 - 3329.44] fungicides so what i've noticed by
[3327.60 - 3331.12] buying all the different ashwagandhas
[3329.44 - 3334.24] from the best companies out there and
[3331.12 - 3336.24] trying them i tasted fungicide
[3334.24 - 3337.92] isn't that interesting
[3336.24 - 3339.76] fungicide that means all the
[3337.92 - 3341.68] ashwagandhas out there were highly
[3339.76 - 3342.88] sprayed with fungicides and then bottled
[3341.68 - 3344.96] up
[3342.88 - 3346.64] vimergy is the only one
[3344.96 - 3349.12] that wasn't sprayed with the fungicides
[3346.64 - 3351.36] like all that heavy fungicide so i don't
[3349.12 - 3353.44] taste fungicide when i'm using
[3351.36 - 3355.68] ashwagandha
[3353.44 - 3357.28] so just letting you know so
[3355.68 - 3360.72] anyway when it comes down to hair loss
[3357.28 - 3363.04] ashwagandha helps the adrenals
[3360.72 - 3365.68] and when it's hair thinning
[3363.04 - 3366.64] a stagnant sluggish liver
[3365.68 - 3369.60] right
[3366.64 - 3371.84] along with adrenal problems
[3369.60 - 3375.36] when you meet you're missing
[3371.84 - 3378.64] critical hormones in the adrenal glands
[3375.36 - 3381.76] hair starts to fall out
[3378.64 - 3384.48] and so ashwagandha helps to restore the
[3381.76 - 3388.24] adrenal glands in women
[3384.48 - 3390.96] that missing hormonally start to lose
[3388.24 - 3392.88] and when they start to lose that
[3390.96 - 3395.12] they end up
[3392.88 - 3397.76] losing everything else they lose their
[3395.12 - 3400.00] hair they lose other things too
[3397.76 - 3400.00] so
[3401.92 - 3405.84] he's not sponsored someone's saying uh
[3403.84 - 3407.68] affiliate affiliate marketing i'm not
[3405.84 - 3409.52] sponsored so let's go back into that a
[3407.68 - 3411.36] little bit i don't own the vimergy
[3409.52 - 3412.72] company i'm not sponsored i'm not an
[3411.36 - 3414.96] ambassador
[3412.72 - 3416.56] okay so i'm just letting you know and i
[3414.96 - 3419.20] buy my products
[3416.56 - 3421.44] i buy them i order i just ordered a
[3419.20 - 3423.04] bunch of propolis
[3421.44 - 3424.32] but i ordered a few more bottles because
[3423.04 - 3425.76] i try not to order too much because i'm
[3424.32 - 3427.76] worried about it going out of stock and
[3425.76 - 3430.32] then somebody with chronic illness
[3427.76 - 3432.72] needs to buy up a propolis and all of a
[3430.32 - 3433.76] sudden you know whatever so i'm and and
[3432.72 - 3435.52] if you look if you're dealing with
[3433.76 - 3437.68] symptoms you should stock up on it so
[3435.52 - 3440.16] you have it so you're not out of it so
[3437.68 - 3442.64] make sure so i got a couple of a bottle
[3440.16 - 3444.08] so i hope you guys got enough of it
[3442.64 - 3446.16] anyway
[3444.08 - 3448.00] so when it comes down to ash ashwagandha
[3446.16 - 3449.92] i want to go into that a little bit so
[3448.00 - 3452.40] what ashwagandha does is it helps to
[3449.92 - 3454.16] restore the balance
[3452.40 - 3456.08] in the adrenals so dr
[3454.16 - 3458.56] epinephrine is not your only hormone in
[3456.08 - 3460.64] your adrenals
[3458.56 - 3462.64] that's not your only hormone
[3460.64 - 3464.72] so it's not like okay what boom we just
[3462.64 - 3467.20] have adrenaline is complex right there's
[3464.72 - 3469.36] a lot of different blends of adrenaline
[3467.20 - 3471.44] and so hair loss once those adrenals
[3469.36 - 3473.28] start to drop down and break down you
[3471.44 - 3475.84] end up with a hair loss because you're
[3473.28 - 3478.72] losing critical hormones
[3475.84 - 3481.44] adrenals even produce some estrogen
[3478.72 - 3482.96] right they produce that so you're losing
[3481.44 - 3484.88] these different hormones in the adrenal
[3482.96 - 3486.56] glands when we go through stress and
[3484.88 - 3488.24] everything else so a relationship break
[3486.56 - 3489.92] up something bad happens or do you just
[3488.24 - 3491.52] been through a sickness
[3489.92 - 3493.28] and you end up losing hair so
[3491.52 - 3494.56] ashwagandha is critical so that's just
[3493.28 - 3496.08] one right there and i'm just showing you
[3494.56 - 3498.64] hair thinning and hair loss the
[3496.08 - 3499.76] ashwagandha right here
[3498.64 - 3500.96] hell glue
[3499.76 - 3502.64] so there's a lot of there's a lot of
[3500.96 - 3504.24] different things um
[3502.64 - 3507.12] i'm looking at different stuff magnesium
[3504.24 - 3508.88] is a great one so ms msm right so let's
[3507.12 - 3512.32] go into that a little bit
[3508.88 - 3515.12] sets of energy msm right there
[3512.32 - 3518.08] and for hair loss it says one capsule
[3515.12 - 3520.72] daily right there one capsule daily
[3518.08 - 3523.52] so you'll see out there hair skin nail
[3520.72 - 3525.68] supplements but they don't have things
[3523.52 - 3527.84] that are critical for hair building for
[3525.68 - 3529.60] bringing back hair
[3527.84 - 3532.40] right so i'm going to show you three
[3529.60 - 3533.76] critical things for bringing back hair
[3532.40 - 3534.80] msm
[3533.76 - 3536.48] right
[3534.80 - 3538.72] nettle leaf let me show you three
[3536.48 - 3540.96] critical things
[3538.72 - 3541.92] and ashwagandha
[3540.96 - 3546.00] three
[3541.92 - 3547.84] critical pieces for bringing back hair
[3546.00 - 3550.32] right there
[3547.84 - 3550.32] these three
[3552.64 - 3555.76] and
[3553.60 - 3557.36] the msm that just came out from bimrg is
[3555.76 - 3559.76] really incredible it's got the silica in
[3557.36 - 3562.32] it the whole bit carrie says vimergy
[3559.76 - 3563.68] supplements are game changing i hear it
[3562.32 - 3565.60] all the time you're on facebook awesome
[3563.68 - 3567.60] i hear i hear it all the time it's like
[3565.60 - 3569.12] i stopped using my vimorgy i got another
[3567.60 - 3571.68] brand or i got another thing and all of
[3569.12 - 3573.28] a sudden things started changing
[3571.68 - 3575.92] so rosalie
[3573.28 - 3578.72] cac says i take organic ashwagandha
[3575.92 - 3580.32] organic ashwagandha doesn't mean it
[3578.72 - 3583.20] doesn't have the fungicides i've
[3580.32 - 3584.88] purchased all the organic ashwagandhas
[3583.20 - 3586.40] that's the whole point i purchased them
[3584.88 - 3588.48] from all the different companies
[3586.40 - 3590.64] from all the different places the best
[3588.48 - 3591.52] companies and the best known brands
[3590.64 - 3592.32] okay
[3591.52 - 3594.32] and
[3592.32 - 3595.92] it doesn't mean the quality is there for
[3594.32 - 3597.84] other reasons and i still tasted
[3595.92 - 3599.68] fungicide so i think the whole
[3597.84 - 3601.12] ashwagandha world you can have it it's
[3599.68 - 3603.36] great to have an organic one with
[3601.12 - 3606.16] ashwagandha but it's not everything when
[3603.36 - 3608.08] it comes down to ashwagandha because
[3606.16 - 3609.76] of that fungicide
[3608.08 - 3610.56] that i taste it that's the whole thing
[3609.76 - 3612.00] too
[3610.56 - 3613.20] so
[3612.00 - 3616.24] anyway
[3613.20 - 3616.24] when it comes down to
[3616.64 - 3619.52] and another thing too what you're going
[3618.00 - 3620.32] to say well here's the thing what people
[3619.52 - 3621.76] say
[3620.32 - 3623.76] it happens all the time i try to
[3621.76 - 3626.56] amendment doesn't work for me and they
[3623.76 - 3628.40] didn't even have the right stuff
[3626.56 - 3630.00] they didn't have the right type of b12
[3628.40 - 3632.88] they had cya cobalamin they didn't have
[3630.00 - 3634.40] adenosine volume and methylcobalamin
[3632.88 - 3635.92] so their meanwhile their neurological
[3634.40 - 3637.84] symptoms aren't showing any prove
[3635.92 - 3639.60] improvement and they're like i tried mmm
[3637.84 - 3642.32] really because you didn't use adenosine
[3639.60 - 3644.72] cobalamin and methylcobalamin combined
[3642.32 - 3646.64] or really good one right so it's these
[3644.72 - 3648.32] things that matter you know you know
[3646.64 - 3650.08] it's like oh i tried propolis it didn't
[3648.32 - 3652.24] work oh really well you tried one with
[3650.08 - 3653.44] alcohol and solvents in it and it wasn't
[3652.24 - 3655.44] active
[3653.44 - 3656.64] so there's differences here that's
[3655.44 - 3657.84] that's why the medical medium
[3656.64 - 3659.76] information
[3657.84 - 3660.80] is is different than other people out
[3659.76 - 3662.72] there so
[3660.80 - 3665.92] people say i tried i tried celery juice
[3662.72 - 3667.52] they tried eight ounces for a week
[3665.92 - 3669.20] i tried the heavy metal detox and they
[3667.52 - 3670.88] had chlorella and charcoal in their
[3669.20 - 3672.40] heavy metal detox
[3670.88 - 3674.56] because someone's like
[3672.40 - 3676.08] you need charcoal you need you know
[3674.56 - 3677.44] chlorella you need whatever and they're
[3676.08 - 3679.20] like i tried the heavy metal thing and
[3677.44 - 3681.28] then they just what it is i'm an easy
[3679.20 - 3682.20] target easy target to be picked on and i
[3681.28 - 3684.56] get it because it's called
[3682.20 - 3686.48] discrimination because i hear a voice
[3684.56 - 3688.00] and i understand that i accepted that at
[3686.48 - 3690.72] age four
[3688.00 - 3691.84] then it's not my my first rodeo with
[3690.72 - 3694.08] like
[3691.84 - 3696.00] all of it with discrimination so it
[3694.08 - 3697.44] happens when you hear a voice
[3696.00 - 3699.20] and that voice tells you what's wrong
[3697.44 - 3700.80] with people and what they need or what
[3699.20 - 3701.92] they what's wrong what's happening
[3700.80 - 3703.60] what's wrong with the industry and
[3701.92 - 3705.76] everything else right and then you
[3703.60 - 3707.28] provide that information and it's just
[3705.76 - 3709.36] like just like
[3707.28 - 3711.60] people just can't handle it
[3709.36 - 3713.36] karen says ashwagandha isn't on vimorji
