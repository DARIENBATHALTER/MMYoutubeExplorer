[460.68 - 466.08] know where to start they've lost their
[462.72 - 468.12] Foundation along the way they're in this
[466.08 - 470.16] spare they're
[468.12 - 472.16] struggling and they're living with their
[470.16 - 474.40] symptoms and conditions and then in the
[472.16 - 475.96] end their family might not even
[474.40 - 478.36] understand them their friends might not
[475.96 - 480.56] even understand them and they might look
[478.36 - 482.92] just fine and look look just standy the
[480.56 - 485.68] person can look good look okay but
[482.92 - 487.64] they're dying inside they feel like they
[485.68 - 490.24] might look okay from the outside but in
[487.64 - 492.24] the inside they feel Doom and Gloom and
[490.24 - 493.92] am I ever going to get out of this and
[492.24 - 496.24] I've been to so many doctors and I've
[493.92 - 497.96] seen so many opinions and I've seen so
[496.24 - 499.68] many things in social media and I've
[497.96 - 501.24] bought in this person's program and I
[499.68 - 503.16] tried it and I've bought this person's
[501.24 - 505.60] program in course I've taken this
[503.16 - 507.92] person's class in course and now I'm
[505.60 - 510.08] $22,000 Less in my pocket now I'm
[507.92 - 512.80] another $1,000 Less in my pocket and
[510.08 - 514.32] then the blood work thing all on its own
[512.80 - 515.84] you go to this specialist they want
[514.32 - 517.48] seven vials and you go to this
[515.84 - 519.40] specialist and they want 12 vials and I
[517.48 - 521.88] saw somebody leave a comment saying I'm
[519.40 - 524.24] a blah blah blah nurse or I'm a blah
[521.88 - 525.88] blah fonus and they were like there's no
[524.24 - 527.48] such thing as taking more than a couple
[525.88 - 529.04] of vials I've never heard of such a
[527.48 - 532.44] thing and then everybody came on like
[529.04 - 535.92] are you crazy I took I they took 7 12 14
[532.44 - 538.20] 40 vials somebody said 60 vials of blood
[535.92 - 540.36] and then we just get knocked down from
[538.20 - 541.64] there and then you find this other
[540.36 - 543.16] doctor and he's like nutritional
[541.64 - 545.16] deficiencies look at all this stuff in
[543.16 - 546.60] the blood work and then look at this on
[545.16 - 549.36] the allat look at all your food
[546.60 - 552.16] sensitivities look at your IGG
[549.36 - 556.08] Madness absolute Madness is what it can
[552.16 - 558.20] turn into it's worth a swear I'll say
[556.08 - 559.80] that you know why it's worth a swear
[558.20 - 562.44] because I've watched it go on for so
[559.80 - 564.40] long and it's about the person who's
[562.44 - 568.20] suffering and struggling it's about
[564.40 - 570.56] making sure that that person is heard
[568.20 - 572.04] because it's there's never any time for
[570.56 - 573.56] The Chronic wheel there's never any time
[572.04 - 578.44] for the person struggling and swept
[573.56 - 578.44] under the carpet so yeah I can deserve a
[579.16 - 585.48] swear gets me emotional really
[583.32 - 588.04] emotional I've seen it every day for
[585.48 - 590.60] years and I've seen
[588.04 - 592.52] people just get kicked down so low get
[590.60 - 593.72] kicked down so low down down down down
[592.52 - 596.00] down down down to the point where
[593.72 - 601.12] they're rock bottom and they're just a
[596.00 - 601.12] puddle of water a puddle of fluid on the
[602.52 - 607.52] floor they got the bladder infections
[605.56 - 610.00] the kidney infections the UTI they're
[607.52 - 611.92] back on antibio antibiotics they got the
[610.00 - 613.28] sinus infections they got the sore
[611.92 - 614.32] throats all the time then they got the
[613.28 - 616.64] ear
[614.32 - 619.20] infections and the list goes on and then
[616.64 - 620.96] the flues come rolling into town you see
[619.20 - 623.72] I got immune system stuff in front of me
[620.96 - 630.08] right now because guess what I'm so sick
[623.72 - 633.36] of it I am so darn sick of it the flu
[630.08 - 635.16] and the Sea coming into town RSB coming
[633.36 - 638.64] into
[635.16 - 639.80] town rolling in the holidays are coming
[638.64 - 641.08] people are getting together for
[639.80 - 642.88] Thanksgiving getting together for
[641.08 - 645.28] Christmas and everybody's coughing and
[642.88 - 648.48] choking their brains out and they're
[645.28 - 650.80] sick and they're sick and then what
[648.48 - 652.68] happens is when you get the flu like
[650.80 - 654.76] medical meme information you get the flu
[652.68 - 657.40] or you get the SE it knocks you down and
[654.76 - 660.08] then the bugs rise up knocks you down
[657.40 - 662.28] and then the bugs rise up
[660.08 - 665.16] exposures knock us down then the bug
[662.28 - 666.16] bugs rise up and then we have that
[665.16 - 668.44] happen
[666.16 - 670.20] too like right now I'm under a lot of
[668.44 - 672.64] stress not sleeping that much doing a
[670.20 - 674.24] lot of different projects and things
[672.64 - 676.00] trying to serve the chronic Leo and all
[674.24 - 678.48] the other stuff right and I'm doing and
[676.00 - 682.08] plus regular life stuff that comes in
[678.48 - 684.56] the way I'm cranking up my antivirals
[682.08 - 686.48] antibacterials anti- whatever because
[684.56 - 688.44] you know I don't want a flu com in my
[686.48 - 690.92] way while I have two hours of sleep and
[688.44 - 692.92] I'm run down I don't need the SE come in
[690.92 - 694.72] my way when I have 1 hour of sleep one
[692.92 - 697.60] night cuz I'm working on a bunch of
[694.72 - 699.44] deadlines and I'm under a lot of stress
[697.60 - 701.12] like everybody's under stress and I
[699.44 - 704.68] don't need something Sweeping in like a
[701.12 - 708.60] sea or a flu coming in and knocking me
[704.68 - 711.56] on my ass I don't need that right
[708.60 - 713.20] now because I know I see it out there I
[711.56 - 715.08] got some friends and I know some other
[713.20 - 716.44] people and they're hit with it and
[715.08 - 719.08] they're hit with it right now and
[716.44 - 722.04] they're just their throat swollen Galore
[719.08 - 725.48] they're choking mucas for a whole 3
[722.04 - 728.64] weeks and I don't want that to be
[725.48 - 730.76] me but I know that inevitably so many
[728.64 - 732.76] people are going to be affected by it
[730.76 - 734.96] and they're already affected by The
[732.76 - 737.32] Chronic sickness and symptoms that
[734.96 - 738.72] they're dealing with every day you guys
[737.32 - 740.00] have been through it you know you know
[738.72 - 742.28] other people that have been through it
[740.00 - 742.28] and you
[744.04 - 749.88] know so today I'm talking about
[746.60 - 751.92] sensitivities as well
[749.88 - 753.80] supplement sensitivities and other
[751.92 - 756.40] sensitivities so let's go into it a
[753.80 - 757.92] little bit right now there are a lot of
[756.40 - 759.68] people out there that are struggling
[757.92 - 761.36] with neurological symptoms whether
[759.68 - 763.12] they've been diagnosed with neurological
[761.36 - 764.72] symptoms or seen as if they have a
[763.12 - 768.68] neurological
[764.72 - 771.32] symptom and they get just whacked
[768.68 - 773.24] whacked some kind of exposure a lawn
[771.32 - 776.44] treatment at a neighbor's
[773.24 - 778.48] house pesticide spray drift coming from
[776.44 - 781.20] mosquito spray wherever they don't even
[778.48 - 782.64] know what it is diesel exhaust coming
[781.20 - 784.72] from a truck that was running for a half
[782.64 - 788.32] an hour near their
[784.72 - 790.60] house any kind of exposure any kind of
[788.32 - 792.44] exposure there's so many different kinds
[790.60 - 794.08] and then all of a sudden something flips
[792.44 - 795.56] them upside down maybe they got a food
[794.08 - 797.76] poisoning and they don't realize it but
[795.56 - 799.88] they got a food poisoning so easy
[797.76 - 801.80] there's so many food born pathogens on
[799.88 - 803.72] food every day out there in restaurants
[801.80 - 805.96] and everywhere else it's easy to get a
[803.72 - 808.12] food born pathogen and then it knocks
[805.96 - 810.88] you on your butt and now you're
[808.12 - 813.76] struggling and now you're in this weird
[810.88 - 816.36] hyper sensitive mode your neurological
[813.76 - 819.08] symptoms have clicked up you're in this
[816.36 - 821.08] hyper sensitive mode your head feels
[819.08 - 822.68] fuzzy you got the brain fog your nerves
[821.08 - 824.52] feel kind of Itchy and Scratchy you
[822.68 - 826.44] don't feel like yourself and you're
[824.52 - 827.64] sensitive to everything sensitive to
[826.44 - 829.60] everything and the last thing you want
[827.64 - 831.16] to do is try to take a supplement cuz
[829.60 - 833.28] you're scared to take
[831.16 - 836.36] anything and you're in this place where
[833.28 - 840.68] you're just super hyp
[836.36 - 842.60] sensitive super hypers sensitive
[840.68 - 845.76] and that place right there is not a fun
[842.60 - 847.04] place to be and then you're scared and
[845.76 - 848.28] now you're going to this different
[847.04 - 849.52] practitioner and this different
[848.28 - 851.28] practitioner and you should you should
[849.52 - 853.08] see doctors and practitioners I always
[851.28 - 855.28] have told people that from the beginning
[853.08 - 857.20] everybody knows that but you go see
[855.28 - 858.72] another person and you're just like what
[857.20 - 860.84] do I do and they're just like well you
[858.72 - 864.00] can try this or do this and then you try
[860.84 - 865.80] something and you react your body reacts
[864.00 - 869.08] you feel like something is off
[865.80 - 871.44] something's wrong and your body reacts
[869.08 - 873.60] and now you're afraid of everything and
[871.44 - 875.36] then the OCD kicks it up a notch and
[873.60 - 876.84] you're afraid of everything the OCD
[875.36 - 878.44] kicks it up a notch then you're afraid
[876.84 - 881.08] of
[878.44 - 882.68] everything then the anxiety Rises and
[881.08 - 884.56] then the depression hits and then the
[882.68 - 886.40] anger goes up and then the anger comes
[884.56 - 888.72] down then your anxiety Rises and the
[886.40 - 890.68] anger hits the anger goes up anger goes
[888.72 - 892.32] down then the sadness comes and sweeps
[890.68 - 893.84] in then the depression comes and takes
[892.32 - 895.16] over then you're depersonalized then
[893.84 - 896.64] you're doubting Your Existence and
[895.16 - 901.04] doubting your purpose then it's back to
[896.64 - 902.12] square one over and over and over again
[901.04 - 903.60] what I want to tell you guys there's
[902.12 - 905.80] light at the end of the
[903.60 - 907.64] tunnel there's light at theend end of
[905.80 - 909.56] the tunnel people who have committed
[907.64 - 912.60] really committed to wanting to learn the
[909.56 - 914.88] information I get it there's so many
[912.60 - 917.20] things out there and so much noise and
[914.88 - 919.28] confusion it's easy to get lost but if
[917.20 - 920.36] someone cracks into the information then
[919.28 - 923.96] they learn
[920.36 - 925.96] it the light is in this book the light
[923.96 - 927.96] is in these books so they can learn how
[925.96 - 930.60] they got sick why they got sick and you
[927.96 - 932.92] may see tits and T tidbits and things
[930.60 - 936.76] like that and tidbits out
[932.92 - 939.04] there you may see
[936.76 - 940.44] that and what happens is that when you
[939.04 - 942.08] see that out there you'll be confused be
[940.44 - 943.68] like oh he talks about epine bar here oh
[942.08 - 946.64] this person talks about this or mentions
[943.68 - 949.52] this but you got to learn the truth and
[946.64 - 952.00] where it comes from because tits and
[949.52 - 954.52] tats and tads and things and all that of
[952.00 - 957.20] information out there don't compile to
[954.52 - 958.60] what's in here and becoming an experts
[957.20 - 961.20] critical let's go into supplement
[958.60 - 963.52] sensitivities a little
[961.20 - 965.68] bit there may come a time in your life
[963.52 - 968.36] where you're hyp sensitive and you've
[965.68 - 970.68] been burned by supplements and you don't
[968.36 - 973.28] like it because you're super sensitive
[970.68 - 975.60] you can't take anything you can't do
[973.28 - 977.04] anything then that happens out there one
[975.60 - 978.88] of the reasons why there's supplements
[977.04 - 979.92] out there that have citric acid in it
[978.88 - 982.36] they have all these different
[979.92 - 984.28] undisclosed things like C citric acid
[982.36 - 986.80] and they cause problems with so many
[984.28 - 988.56] people Terra over there on YouTube
[986.80 - 991.36] please talk more about sensitivities to
[988.56 - 993.64] to stimulation sound motion mental
[991.36 - 995.24] stimulation reading talking ET
[993.64 - 996.92] absolutely what what happens is those
[995.24 - 1000.60] are all neurological
[996.92 - 1002.92] symptoms a sensitive nervous system can
[1000.60 - 1006.00] make it so you're actually sensitive to
[1002.92 - 1007.88] noise you're sensitive to the front door
[1006.00 - 1009.44] opening if you have if you're living
[1007.88 - 1010.96] with family and someone opens the front
[1009.44 - 1012.64] door you're going to feel it you're just
[1010.96 - 1013.64] going to feel it and you're going to be
[1012.64 - 1016.32] really sensitive you're going to be
[1013.64 - 1018.64] sensitive to a Full Moon you're going to
[1016.32 - 1020.52] be sensitive to a storm a wind wind
[1018.64 - 1022.52] storm you're going to be sensitive to
[1020.52 - 1025.24] when the cold weather sweeps
[1022.52 - 1026.72] in and you can be sensitive to when the
[1025.24 - 1029.08] hot weather comes in you could be
[1026.72 - 1031.60] sensitive when the humidity Rises
[1029.08 - 1033.16] sensitive when the air gets too dry
[1031.60 - 1036.16] sensitive when the heat's on in the
[1033.16 - 1037.68] house when it's cooled out sensitive to
[1036.16 - 1040.04] when the air conditioner's on in the
[1037.68 - 1041.72] house when it's hot out you can be fine
[1040.04 - 1046.40] for years and then suddenly you're
[1041.72 - 1046.40] sensitive to everything and
[1046.44 - 1051.84] anything fine for years
[1050.12 - 1053.84] what happens is with a lot of Sensi
[1051.84 - 1057.56] sensitive people it's the sensitive
[1053.84 - 1061.20] nervous system syndrome is what it is
[1057.56 - 1063.72] the sensitive nervous system
[1061.20 - 1065.52] syndrome basically what that means is
[1063.72 - 1067.60] anything and everything can just rattle
[1065.52 - 1069.92] your vegus nerves rattle your trial
[1067.60 - 1072.96] nerves rattle your frenic nerves rattle
[1069.92 - 1074.60] all the nerves in your body and bring
[1072.96 - 1076.88] you to a place where you're just you're
[1074.60 - 1079.32] just you can't you want to jump out of
[1076.88 - 1081.20] your skin
[1079.32 - 1082.56] and you feel like you might even seizure
[1081.20 - 1083.76] kind of feeling where you almost feel
[1082.56 - 1085.40] like it's pushing you over the edge
[1083.76 - 1086.40] where you almost can't stand it anymore
[1085.40 - 1092.12] and you
[1086.40 - 1094.84] just you just feel like you're losing it
[1092.12 - 1098.32] sensitivities from sensitive nerves can
[1094.84 - 1100.72] make us feel inadequate make us feel
[1098.32 - 1103.32] like something's wrong make us feel
[1100.72 - 1105.28] like we're not doing good at all and
[1103.32 - 1106.92] it's a hard place to be a hard place to
[1105.28 - 1109.64] feel I feel for anybody who's going
[1106.92 - 1112.24] through any of that
[1109.64 - 1114.60] I really do truly truly
[1112.24 - 1117.08] truly
[1114.60 - 1118.84] and when it comes down to sensitivities
[1117.08 - 1121.04] when we get exposed to something and
[1118.84 - 1123.96] we're really hyp sensitive something
[1121.04 - 1126.40] triggers triggers us in our life and
[1123.96 - 1130.32] we're sick now whether it's pathogens
[1126.40 - 1130.32] creating neurotoxins medical M
[1130.40 - 1136.40] information got to say
[1132.92 - 1139.32] it with there pathogens triggering off
[1136.40 - 1141.64] you know things with neurotox toxins
[1139.32 - 1143.68] whether it's strep bacteria whether it's
[1141.64 - 1146.28] toxic heavy metals whether it's
[1143.68 - 1149.32] pesticides herbicide sprays
[1146.28 - 1152.20] somewhere whatever it is we get
[1149.32 - 1154.44] sensitive and these things trigger us
[1152.20 - 1156.84] our our nervous system can get inflamed
[1154.44 - 1159.48] from it and our nervous system can get
[1156.84 - 1162.52] allergic to it so then now it's time to
[1159.48 - 1164.32] heal so we go we try a supplement and we
[1162.52 - 1167.12] feel like we
[1164.32 - 1169.00] react we try to eat something different
[1167.12 - 1172.92] and we feel like we can't handle it and
[1169.00 - 1174.80] we react sensitivities that occur and
[1172.92 - 1176.60] now we're stuck because then it becomes
[1174.80 - 1179.04] this thing where we get wrapped up all
[1176.60 - 1182.28] in it and rightfully so because it's
[1179.04 - 1184.48] real the feelings we're having are real
[1182.28 - 1187.60] they're not fake they're
[1184.48 - 1189.84] real they're real true symptoms we're
[1187.60 - 1191.40] actually experiencing even though
[1189.84 - 1192.76] someone else hearing it might be like
[1191.40 - 1194.96] what do you mean you can't handle some
[1192.76 - 1199.08] noise what do you mean you can't handle
[1194.96 - 1201.32] some hot some cold you you can't handle
[1199.08 - 1203.12] the heater on here you can't handle this
[1201.32 - 1206.00] you can't handle the blanket being too
[1203.12 - 1208.36] warm you can't handle whatever it is you
[1206.00 - 1210.68] can't handle something stimulating on
[1208.36 - 1213.20] television you can't see a movie or
[1210.68 - 1215.60] watch an action-packed movie you can't
[1213.20 - 1218.16] do things that you want to do cuz the
[1215.60 - 1220.40] nervous system got really hypers
[1218.16 - 1221.52] sensitive and then it becomes this
[1220.40 - 1224.16] vicious
[1221.52 - 1227.40] cycle it's vicious
[1224.16 - 1229.00] cycle and then it's like I want to heal
[1227.40 - 1231.12] I want to try
[1229.00 - 1234.04] something and then a lot of people end
[1231.12 - 1238.44] up trying something that's toxic or
[1234.04 - 1242.56] aggressive or not great for you they'll
[1238.44 - 1244.16] try some Alkaline ionizer Water they'll
[1242.56 - 1247.40] feel worse but don't know why they'll
[1244.16 - 1249.48] try some bentonite clay they'll try some
[1247.40 - 1251.96] kind of scratchy microbiome probiotic
[1249.48 - 1253.96] powder they'll try some kind of greens
[1251.96 - 1256.24] powder that has all kinds of stuff in it
[1253.96 - 1258.72] nobody knew about like scratchy scratchy
[1256.24 - 1260.96] stuff and their intestinal tract gets
[1258.72 - 1262.80] irritated everything gets irritated and
[1260.96 - 1265.48] the nerves get irritated because when we
[1262.80 - 1267.96] eat things that aren't easy on our
[1265.48 - 1270.08] system while we're hyper sensitive or we
[1267.96 - 1272.20] take supplements that aren't easy on our
[1270.08 - 1274.32] system while we're hypers sensitive we
[1272.20 - 1276.92] react and then all of our nerves
[1274.32 - 1278.68] everywhere fire up and they go on fire
[1276.92 - 1282.20] all of our
[1278.68 - 1285.52] nerves the Vegas nerves light up and
[1282.20 - 1288.40] then where anxiety attacks panic attacks
[1285.52 - 1290.48] itchy scratchy um all kinds of different
[1288.40 - 1292.92] involuntary functions and jerks and
[1290.48 - 1294.20] things like that weakness in the limbs
[1292.92 - 1297.60] weird
[1294.20 - 1300.68] vibrations itchiness you can't scratch
[1297.60 - 1303.56] pinches on the body ticks and spasms and
[1300.68 - 1309.36] I'm just naming a
[1303.56 - 1311.08] few and we become very very sensitive
[1309.36 - 1314.16] but we have to
[1311.08 - 1315.72] heal we have to move forward and we have
[1314.16 - 1318.92] to
[1315.72 - 1321.80] heal we need a chance toal heal what do
[1318.92 - 1324.12] we do the key is finding the right
[1321.80 - 1327.20] supplements it don't have things in it
[1324.12 - 1329.20] that aggravate the whole thing that
[1327.20 - 1331.32] aggravate the whole
[1329.20 - 1334.68] condition so I talk about taking
[1331.32 - 1337.96] supplements a lot I do I talk about food
[1334.68 - 1340.84] a lot I talk about supplementation a lot
[1337.96 - 1342.76] I talk about meditations a lot I talk
[1340.84 - 1344.80] about a lot of
[1342.76 - 1347.72] things but when it comes down to
[1344.80 - 1348.72] supplementation people who are sensitive
[1347.72 - 1352.72] I
[1348.72 - 1354.52] tell you start with one thing that's it
[1352.72 - 1357.56] you start with one
[1354.52 - 1359.12] thing and you can do something with it I
[1357.56 - 1362.56] know people out there like I can't take
[1359.12 - 1365.72] one thing I just can't take one
[1362.56 - 1368.80] thing and then people need to understand
[1365.72 - 1372.20] that you can take one thing you
[1368.80 - 1374.08] can but it it takes just a little bit of
[1372.20 - 1376.52] confidence A Little Bit of Faith a
[1374.08 - 1378.48] little bit of understanding and an
[1376.52 - 1380.00] acclamation process so so what happens
[1378.48 - 1381.80] when people are on Rock Bottom with
[1380.00 - 1384.04] their sensitivities they on Rock Bottom
[1381.80 - 1385.80] with their nervous system conditions it
[1384.04 - 1388.40] takes some
[1385.80 - 1390.52] acclamation teaching the body that it's
[1388.40 - 1392.48] going to be okay it's going to be all
[1390.52 - 1394.40] right because we got receptors in the
[1392.48 - 1396.72] neurons that are basically saying I've
[1394.40 - 1398.52] been burned before I've been I've tried
[1396.72 - 1402.52] this tried
[1398.52 - 1406.32] that I've done this everything
[1402.52 - 1407.96] hurts and so what you can do and here's
[1406.32 - 1409.48] an example right here I got some beach
[1407.96 - 1411.72] 12 right here right that's the vimer G
[1409.48 - 1415.32] B12 so I want to show
[1411.72 - 1418.72] you okay what you can do is you take a
[1415.32 - 1423.28] tiny drop right
[1418.72 - 1424.36] here right tiny drop and you put it on
[1423.28 - 1427.28] your
[1424.36 - 1430.88] hand just like
[1427.28 - 1433.68] this tiny drop right on your hand okay
[1430.88 - 1436.40] just like that so I'm showing you guys
[1433.68 - 1439.52] okay tiny drop just on the hand just
[1436.40 - 1441.04] like this you could even go smaller than
[1439.52 - 1443.80] that
[1441.04 - 1445.48] okay and you'll let it sit there if
[1443.80 - 1448.00] you're somebody with
[1445.48 - 1449.80] sensitivities supplement
[1448.00 - 1452.40] sensitivities someone who's been through
[1449.80 - 1454.28] a lot nervous system
[1452.40 - 1456.92] sensitivities that's one thing you can
[1454.28 - 1460.04] start with right there you got your B12
[1456.92 - 1464.28] you put a little bit right on your hand
[1460.04 - 1469.36] and you can just dab it on there like
[1464.28 - 1473.56] this you can do this once a day once a
[1469.36 - 1476.72] day just like this your body starts to
[1473.56 - 1479.84] acclimate it starts to prepare and get
[1476.72 - 1481.12] ready for something that's going to help
[1479.84 - 1484.80] change your
[1481.12 - 1487.68] life change your body
[1484.80 - 1491.36] systems change the
[1487.68 - 1494.04] balance so it goes into a better place
[1491.36 - 1497.24] and you do this once a day if you're
[1494.04 - 1498.56] somebody hyper sensitive you do this
[1497.24 - 1502.12] once a day
[1498.56 - 1504.12] day you can leave it on there just for a
[1502.12 - 1507.64] couple of minutes once a day when those
[1504.12 - 1509.76] couple of minutes are up you do this can
[1507.64 - 1513.40] wipe it right off that's
[1509.76 - 1516.52] it what happens is your body's now
[1513.40 - 1518.48] recalibrating rewiring your brain your
[1516.52 - 1520.96] nervous system your entire body is
[1518.48 - 1524.68] rewiring to that
[1520.96 - 1527.72] B12 to that supplement now I like doing
[1524.68 - 1531.08] this with B12 because B12 is fundament
[1527.72 - 1534.52] Fally how we exist keep that in
[1531.08 - 1539.48] mind it is fundamentally how we exist on
[1534.52 - 1539.48] this planet we need B12 or we
[1539.76 - 1545.60] die we have to either be producing some
[1543.04 - 1548.40] of the B12 on our own in our
[1545.60 - 1551.88] alium we have to be getting B12 from
[1548.40 - 1554.16] some Source something out there or we
[1551.88 - 1555.64] cease to live eventually our whole body
[1554.16 - 1559.40] falls
[1555.64 - 1562.72] apart Rob over there on Stitch is that
[1559.40 - 1564.72] it twitch I was sensitive to liquid B12
[1562.72 - 1567.44] last year I've since been able to
[1564.72 - 1570.68] tolerate it more there's a light at the
[1567.44 - 1573.88] UN end of the tunnel there is a light
[1570.68 - 1577.04] there the end of the tunnel important to
[1573.88 - 1579.64] know Michelle you said your B12 is your
[1577.04 - 1582.08] favorite because what happens is that we
[1579.64 - 1585.24] our bodies
[1582.08 - 1587.68] naturally want B12 our bodies no matter
[1585.24 - 1590.92] what our condition is no matter what
[1587.68 - 1593.84] what our condition is whether we got
[1590.92 - 1596.76] fibro whether we got lime whether we got
[1593.84 - 1601.08] ra whether we got some other symptom and
[1596.76 - 1604.88] condition no matter what it is our body
[1601.08 - 1607.44] wants B12 it does Cara says I've been so
[1604.88 - 1610.16] sensitive to all supplements in the past
[1607.44 - 1613.28] especially b12 with years of applying
[1610.16 - 1615.76] medical medium healing tools and lots of
[1613.28 - 1620.04] patience though it's now one of my
[1615.76 - 1620.04] favorite supplements vimergy all the
[1621.08 - 1627.28] way so on this test what happens is I
[1623.88 - 1629.44] like doing it on the hand okay I do it
[1627.28 - 1631.24] again I like doing it on the hand so
[1629.44 - 1633.76] it's this once a
[1631.24 - 1635.96] day what this does It prepares your
[1633.76 - 1637.80] Vegas nerves that are inflamed It
[1635.96 - 1639.52] prepares your central nervous system
[1637.80 - 1641.84] your brain your
[1639.52 - 1645.04] liver which is the
[1641.84 - 1647.84] converter of supplements and what I love
[1645.04 - 1651.12] about B12 I'm not speaking for all B12
[1647.84 - 1653.52] out there I'm not because I don't know
[1651.12 - 1655.60] the crap that's in beach2 bottles all
[1653.52 - 1657.08] across the land I don't care who says
[1655.60 - 1659.20] what and they got the best stuff going
[1657.08 - 1660.84] on they buy the lower quality they buy
[1659.20 - 1663.64] the lower
[1660.84 - 1665.04] tier I've seen it all out there that's
[1663.64 - 1667.24] why I support vinm that's why I work
[1665.04 - 1670.04] with them because of this fact that
[1667.24 - 1672.24] that's what companies do out there and I
[1670.04 - 1674.64] become friends with so many different
[1672.24 - 1676.52] companies and Company owners out there
[1674.64 - 1679.80] and all through the land all these years
[1676.52 - 1681.96] in the last 20 plus plus 30 plus years
[1679.80 - 1684.20] and it's been the same story we can't do
[1681.96 - 1686.32] that aw we can't make it good enough
[1684.20 - 1688.60] like you wanted we can't do the quality
[1686.32 - 1690.60] you want we can't make it so sensitive
[1688.60 - 1693.80] people can take it sorry it's all about
[1690.60 - 1695.72] the Dollar Bottom Dollar the bottom line
[1693.80 - 1697.76] and themy doesn't do that they don't do
[1695.72 - 1699.64] that to me that's why I actually support
[1697.76 - 1702.32] them like I do because they don't do
[1699.64 - 1703.96] that I become friends with them too over
[1702.32 - 1705.92] the years and they don't do that they
[1703.96 - 1708.04] said I'm not they said they said aw
[1705.92 - 1710.20] we're not going to do that we wanted so
[1708.04 - 1712.08] good we want to take it for ourselves we
[1710.20 - 1716.12] want people to have
[1712.08 - 1717.76] this and so I can't speak for all other
[1716.12 - 1719.56] like like b12's out there but what I'm
[1717.76 - 1721.84] trying to say is the methab balamin the
[1719.56 - 1724.32] stos silab balamin right this these
[1721.84 - 1726.08] co-enzymes right here in this bottle so
[1724.32 - 1728.00] what I like to do is put it on the hand
[1726.08 - 1730.16] for people who are
[1728.00 - 1731.84] sensitive and you put it on their hand
[1730.16 - 1734.44] you do a little rub like that you'll
[1731.84 - 1735.76] leave it there for a good couple of
[1734.44 - 1738.20] minutes you could leave it there longer
[1735.76 - 1740.72] for 3 or 4 minutes it's fine
[1738.20 - 1743.64] and you leave it there and you do that
[1740.72 - 1745.16] once a day and then this acclamation
[1743.64 - 1746.80] process happens now if you're somebody
[1745.16 - 1748.60] you're not you're not even sensitive to
[1746.80 - 1750.20] anything you take all your supplements
[1748.60 - 1753.12] you do all your stuff you eat what you
[1750.20 - 1755.28] want you go out you party whatever it is
[1753.12 - 1757.68] you can still do this because you're
[1755.28 - 1758.96] sending a message to your neurons you're
[1757.68 - 1760.48] sending a message to your liver your
[1758.96 - 1763.36] liver is already picking up on this this
[1760.48 - 1766.60] goes to the skin it's heading into the
[1763.36 - 1769.16] liver already drawing it in from this
[1766.60 - 1772.36] process but in such a minute
[1769.16 - 1776.76] amount on a level that is actually
[1772.36 - 1779.68] Awakening your natural ability to absorb
[1776.76 - 1781.32] assimilate and methylate supplementation
[1779.68 - 1782.68] because if you've been that sensitive
[1781.32 - 1784.92] where you're in that place where you're
[1782.68 - 1789.00] super sensitive you've been through a
[1784.92 - 1792.28] lot exposures Galore this is a way to

[1795.92 - 1800.72] your body wants the stuff it wants be2
[1799.04 - 1803.44] because guess what we need it it's
[1800.72 - 1805.96] critical critical critical critical that
[1803.44 - 1808.04] people have it so I want to show
[1805.96 - 1810.20] everybody that right there that
[1808.04 - 1812.92] technique really
[1810.20 - 1814.52] powerful
[1812.92 - 1817.08] empowering
[1814.52 - 1819.08] truly Angela over there on IG I got all

[1831.12 - 1836.68] B12 which is
[1834.64 - 1839.44] insane but it's
[1836.68 - 1841.36] incredible I don't want a sale to go buy
[1839.44 - 1843.52] and not mention it because someone's
[1841.36 - 1846.00] going to be like why didn't you mention
[1843.52 - 1848.48] it because I it'll help me if I know
[1846.00 - 1850.00] there's a sale anyway so yeah I'm glad
[1848.48 - 1852.92] you did that that's incredible so that's
[1850.00 - 1852.92] the B12 right
[1854.08 - 1857.84] there So eventually what happens is
[1856.64 - 1860.24] you're going to get to to a point where
[1857.84 - 1861.64] you're like okay you're going to get to
[1860.24 - 1864.52] a point where you're like okay that's
[1861.64 - 1866.24] that's another bottle I use this one and
[1864.52 - 1869.16] you're going to be able to
[1866.24 - 1870.48] do one drop internally take a look at
[1869.16 - 1871.80] that right so I want to show you a
[1870.48 - 1873.76] close-up on that I'll just give you a
[1871.80 - 1876.04] close-up on the one drop eventually
[1873.76 - 1879.48] you'll do one drop
[1876.04 - 1882.96] internally it's like this you guys see
[1879.48 - 1885.96] that okay right and you add a little bit
[1882.96 - 1887.28] water and you take one drop just like
[1885.96 - 1890.00] that so I'm going to go and grab a
[1887.28 - 1890.00] little bit of water
[1890.60 - 1896.68] now and here we
[1893.24 - 1897.76] go this isn't hot like super hot just a
[1896.68 - 1902.52] little
[1897.76 - 1905.24] warm one drop and you do this once a
[1902.52 - 1908.20] day not only are you doing the
[1905.24 - 1911.40] hand the hand
[1908.20 - 1913.96] technique you're doing the one drop a
[1911.40 - 1916.16] day if you're some sensitive that's how
[1913.96 - 1919.24] you start each
[1916.16 - 1921.56] day that's how you do it the nervous
[1919.24 - 1923.84] system rewires everything rewires your
[1921.56 - 1927.40] body takes it in your liver takes it in
[1923.84 - 1927.40] you're methylating all of
[1928.44 - 1932.92] it so that's
[1930.60 - 1934.32] important to know that's one way to do
[1932.92 - 1935.88] it eventually you move on and you're
[1934.32 - 1937.88] like whoa you can take more you can take
[1935.88 - 1940.28] a drop or full a day and you get to this
[1937.88 - 1943.36] point and now things are happening in
[1940.28 - 1945.40] your body you're getting stronger you're
[1943.36 - 1948.60] getting past
[1945.40 - 1950.76] sensitivities and you're now taking
[1948.60 - 1953.68] one
[1950.76 - 1955.24] dropper every day I mean it could be a
[1953.68 - 1956.88] quarter dropper and that's where you go
[1955.24 - 1960.36] and now you're taking one dropper every
[1956.88 - 1964.92] day there it is Courtney ma says the
[1960.36 - 1964.92] sale helps me so much that's
[1965.72 - 1971.00] incredible and there we
[1967.76 - 1973.92] go and we got one
[1971.00 - 1976.64] dropper now what happens with
[1973.92 - 1979.08] sensitivities this is an important
[1976.64 - 1980.12] understanding right here because you're
[1979.08 - 1982.40] so
[1980.12 - 1985.28] hotwired your nervous system's so
[1982.40 - 1987.40] hotwired you're so
[1985.28 - 1988.92] sensitive you can react to something
[1987.40 - 1991.00] else but you won't know what it is and
[1988.92 - 1993.24] then you'll actually blame something
[1991.00 - 1995.96] else do you know what I'm
[1993.24 - 1997.20] saying you can react to this you eat
[1995.96 - 1998.68] this you don't know if it's that you
[1997.20 - 1999.88] don't know if it was the food you had an
[1998.68 - 2001.80] hour ago you don't know if it was
[1999.88 - 2003.32] something you ate yesterday you don't
[2001.80 - 2004.52] know if it's a supplement you just took
[2003.32 - 2006.20] you don't know if it's a supplement you
[2004.52 - 2007.80] took the other day you don't know if
[2006.20 - 2008.76] it's somebody who came over to visit you
[2007.80 - 2010.44] you don't know if it was because you
[2008.76 - 2012.68] were in a store and breathe in all this
[2010.44 - 2015.16] fragrance you don't know if it was
[2012.68 - 2016.84] because you were in the grocery store
[2015.16 - 2018.76] and the protest manager was spraying
[2016.84 - 2021.44] down some stuff and cleaning all the
[2018.76 - 2023.48] racks and rails you don't know what it
[2021.44 - 2026.20] is you don't know if it was The Toxic
[2023.48 - 2028.16] conventional flowers at the supermarket
[2026.20 - 2029.60] that are just blasting out the pesticide
[2028.16 - 2030.96] as you walk by you don't know if it's
[2029.60 - 2033.56] somebody's cologne you were standing in
[2030.96 - 2035.08] line with but either way you actually
[2033.56 - 2036.36] are having a reaction but you don't know
[2035.08 - 2038.40] what it is and the first thing you might
[2036.36 - 2041.84] do is just be like oh it was that one
[2038.40 - 2045.08] drop of B12 I had oh it was that orange
[2041.84 - 2047.76] I had you know oh ho maybe it was that
[2045.08 - 2050.12] avocado I had or maybe it was something
[2047.76 - 2051.76] else and that's where it gets really
[2050.12 - 2055.20] difficult that's why
[2051.76 - 2056.84] I beg of people to make sure they're
[2055.20 - 2058.84] actually learning and understanding
[2056.84 - 2061.00] what's actually in these
[2058.84 - 2062.96] books how much you can learn and
[2061.00 - 2065.12] knowledge you can take in so you can you
[2062.96 - 2068.84] can protect yourself through all this
[2065.12 - 2072.32] process you can climb out of this and
[2068.84 - 2074.24] he so it's usually a really tough tough
[2072.32 - 2077.08] ride up when you got all these
[2074.24 - 2080.72] sensitivities it's a tough tough ride up
[2077.08 - 2083.52] the ladder the healing ladder because
[2080.72 - 2088.04] it's like I always said this is never
[2083.52 - 2091.40] ever gets old this never
[2088.04 - 2093.68] ever gets old three steps up two steps
[2091.40 - 2094.64] back three steps up two steps back five
[2093.68 - 2098.40] steps
[2094.64 - 2101.44] up couple steps back six steps up one
[2098.40 - 2105.40] step back back to three steps up two
[2101.44 - 2109.44] steps back boom four steps back boom
[2105.40 - 2111.52] seven steps up two more steps back
[2109.44 - 2114.04] that's how healing
[2111.52 - 2116.16] works and you're going up the ladder
[2114.04 - 2118.60] that's how it works this never gets old
[2116.16 - 2121.40] it's one of the most
[2118.60 - 2123.80] profound powerful pieces of scripture
[2121.40 - 2127.56] that are in the medical medium books all
[2123.80 - 2130.36] these years three steps up two steps
[2127.56 - 2132.00] back learning this is critical to
[2130.36 - 2133.24] Healing you got sensitivities you got
[2132.00 - 2136.00] supplement sensitivities food
[2133.24 - 2137.96] sensitivities air sensitivities water
[2136.00 - 2139.88] sensitivities you don't know if you're
[2137.96 - 2141.56] coming or going and you're working on
[2139.88 - 2143.12] your healing process you go three steps
[2141.56 - 2146.56] up two steps back and that's how it
[2143.12 - 2146.56] works as you're climbing
[2147.08 - 2155.44] up yes and you're rising out of the
[2151.80 - 2157.64] ashes this is all hogwash to someone
[2155.44 - 2160.48] who's not sick
[2157.64 - 2162.88] someone's not sick they're about what is
[2160.48 - 2163.88] this unless there's some like a podcast
[2162.88 - 2164.96] doctor that wants to steal the
[2163.88 - 2166.36] information and then they'll there
[2164.96 - 2167.84] another story they'll just listen
[2166.36 - 2169.40] they'll get it and then they'll tell
[2167.84 - 2172.80] their people and their people like oh my
[2169.40 - 2175.48] God oh my God never heard anything like
[2172.80 - 2177.76] it never knew we have low-grade viral
[2175.48 - 2180.08] infections never heard of anything like
[2177.76 - 2181.52] that never knew the flu can knock our
[2180.08 - 2182.76] immune system down and something else
[2181.52 - 2184.96] could
[2182.76 - 2187.20] happen never knew heavy metals are
[2184.96 - 2189.68] behind anxiety wow Dr blah blah blah
[2187.20 - 2189.68] you're so
[2189.80 - 2196.04] smart but the three steps up two steps
[2192.60 - 2198.20] down Mac critical to know because it's
[2196.04 - 2200.60] one of the most profound aspects of the

[2401.80 - 2405.64] the immune system for a couple of
[2402.96 - 2408.40] minutes as well so lately what I've been
[2405.64 - 2410.84] doing is I've been doing kind of like a
[2408.40 - 2413.92] cocktail just grabbing a glass right
[2410.84 - 2415.88] there okay so I've been doing some cat's
[2413.92 - 2417.80] claw so I'm just putting in a couple of
[2415.88 - 2419.60] dropper FS of cats claw right there two
[2417.80 - 2421.12] dropper FS of cat's claw you don't have
[2419.60 - 2423.76] to do this you can start out small like
[2421.12 - 2425.52] one drop of something ask your doctor
[2423.76 - 2428.56] what's right for you ask your doctor
[2425.52 - 2429.76] what your doctor wants you to do okay
[2428.56 - 2432.44] I'm just telling you what I tell my
[2429.76 - 2438.40] friends my family two dropper
[2432.44 - 2439.92] fulls there right okay um B12 let's pop
[2438.40 - 2441.92] a little bit of that two dropper fulls
[2439.92 - 2443.88] of the B12 in
[2441.92 - 2445.52] there okay I'm starting to make a little
[2443.88 - 2448.76] bit of a
[2445.52 - 2448.76] mess and
[2449.48 - 2455.36] then I'm going to put four dropper FS of
[2452.24 - 2457.12] the propolis in here right now I can't
[2455.36 - 2459.68] say enough about the propolis I'm just
[2457.12 - 2460.36] letting you know cannot say enough about
[2459.68 - 2462.88] this
[2460.36 - 2464.32] propolis I won't go into it right here I
[2462.88 - 2466.08] just want to show you what I'm doing for
[2464.32 - 2471.48] my immune system during this type of
[2466.08 - 2471.48] time of year so putting four of these in
[2474.24 - 2480.60] here but I want to
[2477.32 - 2485.24] scream I want to scream
[2480.60 - 2488.24] propolis okay I want to scream
[2485.24 - 2488.24] propolis
[2489.92 - 2492.16] all
[2492.36 - 2497.56] right it's all over the
[2494.84 - 2500.68] glass there's putting four dropper fulls
[2497.56 - 2503.20] of golden seal in here two
[2500.68 - 2505.24] three four I can't say enough about
[2503.20 - 2509.92] golden seal as
[2505.24 - 2513.36] well so important all right now I'm
[2509.92 - 2513.36] going to put a little bit of water in
[2514.44 - 2518.32] here and I'm going to put some some
[2516.36 - 2520.80] orange in here right now almost lost
[2518.32 - 2522.64] that orange I threw it in an entirely
[2520.80 - 2525.68] different wrong
[2522.64 - 2529.72] direction and now we got it
[2525.68 - 2529.72] right let's get an orange
[2531.12 - 2538.56] cut yep I got my two dropper fulls of
[2535.28 - 2540.44] cat's claw in here two dropper fulls of
[2538.56 - 2542.56] zinc in here I'm putting a little bit of
[2540.44 - 2544.56] orange why am I putting a little bit of
[2542.56 - 2547.00] orange in in this one let's go into that
[2544.56 - 2549.28] a little bit
[2547.00 - 2551.28] I'm increasing the chances of making
[2549.28 - 2553.84] sure that all the phytochemical
[2551.28 - 2555.48] compounds and nutrients and cortin
[2553.84 - 2558.68] that's naturally like in the propolis
[2555.48 - 2560.96] and all the different all the different
[2558.68 - 2564.40] incredible incredible nutrients that are
[2560.96 - 2565.68] in these medicinals right what I'm doing
[2564.40 - 2567.24] is put a little orange in there because
[2565.68 - 2569.84] that orange is glucose you know what
[2567.24 - 2575.16] that means glucose
[2569.84 - 2578.52] delivers the nutrient to the
[2575.16 - 2580.16] cell and that's the whole thing I love
[2578.52 - 2581.64] about vimer to begin with they got the
[2580.16 - 2585.08] flax
[2581.64 - 2588.12] glycerin it's a whole another game it
[2585.08 - 2590.84] helps to deliver nutrients to the cell
[2588.12 - 2593.88] right and then I step it up I crank it
[2590.84 - 2596.72] up I put a little bit of orange in
[2593.88 - 2598.44] there so that the constituents so that
[2596.72 - 2601.24] the phytochemical compound so that the
[2598.44 - 2603.80] anthocyan so that the the polyphenols
[2601.24 - 2604.92] everything in here and the enzymes and
[2603.80 - 2607.88] everything else that's in there and the
[2604.92 - 2610.88] co-enzymes all get delivered easily into
[2607.88 - 2613.80] the cells into the organs they get
[2610.88 - 2616.68] pulled into the cells and organs because
[2613.80 - 2618.88] you're driving it in with the glucose
[2616.68 - 2621.40] you have to have sugar in order to take
[2618.88 - 2622.96] a nutrient into a cell you can take all
[2621.40 - 2624.88] the supplements you want out there in
[2622.96 - 2626.60] the world all the different things you
[2624.88 - 2629.20] want in the world and if you don't have
[2626.60 - 2632.08] enough glucose in your bloodstream you
[2629.20 - 2634.88] won't get all of it in your cells that's
[2632.08 - 2637.08] an important piece of information vital
[2634.88 - 2638.76] to Healing all on its own
[2637.08 - 2640.80] Bobby over there on Facebook it's a
[2638.76 - 2643.36] whole party in that
[2640.80 - 2646.32] cup it
[2643.36 - 2648.84] is mixing it up right now just Naturally
[2646.32 - 2648.84] by doing
[2649.28 - 2654.88] this back to this piece of information
[2652.04 - 2657.32] on how critical critical this is it
[2654.88 - 2660.16] takes sugar glucose in your bloodstream
[2657.32 - 2663.36] to drive a nutrient into your organ and
[2660.16 - 2665.16] cells big reason why a lot of people
[2663.36 - 2667.12] take all their supplements and they're
[2665.16 - 2670.28] doing the intermittent fasting and they
[2667.12 - 2672.72] got their glucose is really low and they
[2670.28 - 2673.84] just did a workout they did a workout
[2672.72 - 2675.88] they were on the treadmill they were
[2673.84 - 2678.96] doing weights in the gym they were doing
[2675.88 - 2681.24] their you know their resistance
[2678.96 - 2682.76] training and they're taking all these
[2681.24 - 2684.40] powders and supplements and they're
[2682.76 - 2686.28] intermittent fasting and they don't have
[2684.40 - 2688.16] enough glucose and the stuff isn't even
[2686.28 - 2691.64] going into the cells they're becoming
[2688.16 - 2691.64] deficient and they don't even know
[2694.08 - 2699.32] it um cyy says hi what's the brand of

[2717.08 - 2722.12] description links in the
[2720.00 - 2723.88] profile so what I do is I put a little
[2722.12 - 2725.96] orange in here you guys because I want
[2723.88 - 2727.88] to drive these nutrients really deep in
[2725.96 - 2729.52] into the cells and what happens is when
[2727.88 - 2731.76] you're sick and you got neurological
[2729.52 - 2734.68] problems if you don't have some glucose
[2731.76 - 2737.76] bringing those nutrients into your nerve
[2734.68 - 2740.20] cells carrying those nutrients into your
[2737.76 - 2742.52] liver carry them into your
[2740.20 - 2743.88] organs they're not going to go as deep
[2742.52 - 2746.00] they're not going to go as far and
[2743.88 - 2748.16] you're not going to heal as quick not
[2746.00 - 2750.68] going to move forward as quick any want

[2774.40 - 2778.32] down for a couple of minutes after I've
[2776.20 - 2780.12] taken a cocktail like this an immune
[2778.32 - 2783.96] cocktail like

[2995.52 - 3001.24] taking supplements like B12 zinc D3 and
[2998.72 - 3002.48] iodine on an empty stomach this has been
[3001.24 - 3004.16] something recommended by some
[3002.48 - 3006.36] practitioners in the
[3004.16 - 3008.20] community you can take them any way you
[3006.36 - 3009.60] like and you can take them any way your
[3008.20 - 3012.80] doctor prescribes
[3009.60 - 3014.80] it but if you don't have enough glucose
[3012.80 - 3017.12] in your
[3014.80 - 3021.92] system then the supplements aren't going
[3017.12 - 3024.64] to actually get deep enough into your
[3021.92 - 3026.00] system it's partly why you see the
[3024.64 - 3028.36] vitamin C sh
[3026.00 - 3031.12] therapy there was orange put into the
[3028.36 - 3031.12] vitamin C shock
[3031.20 - 3035.08] therapy it's also partly why I was
[3033.32 - 3036.84] talking about before I put a little
[3035.08 - 3040.48] orange in the
[3036.84 - 3044.20] immune little immune tonic that I made
[3040.48 - 3047.00] cocktail but the good news with the viy
[3044.20 - 3050.04] supplements because they're not in
[3047.00 - 3053.32] alcohol they're alcohol-free they're in
[3050.04 - 3057.16] the flax glycerin you do get some
[3053.32 - 3060.28] glucose which is why they work work so
[3057.16 - 3062.12] good it's why they work so good so if
[3060.28 - 3063.52] you have to empty stomach them because
[3062.12 - 3065.12] your doctor or your practitioner saids
[3063.52 - 3069.04] so then that's that's fine perfectly
[3065.12 - 3071.68] fine but if you add just a little bit
[3069.04 - 3073.44] more of glucose in there you don't have
[3071.68 - 3075.52] to do it this way maybe you had some
[3073.44 - 3077.28] celery juice a half an hour ago you got
[3075.52 - 3080.00] some glucose from the celery
[3077.28 - 3081.64] juice maybe you had some lemon water an
[3080.00 - 3083.16] hour before you got some glucose from
[3081.64 - 3086.24] the lemon water so you're still in the
[3083.16 - 3088.56] ballpark you're still okay
[3086.24 - 3089.84] Don't Panic or anything you'll they
[3088.56 - 3092.36] you'll still work it's just there's
[3089.84 - 3094.44] people out there that just drink coffee
[3092.36 - 3096.08] with no sugar in the coffee and then
[3094.44 - 3098.40] they go take their supplements and it
[3096.08 - 3100.00] never gets anywhere unless it's the
[3098.40 - 3102.60] vimergy supplements and there's that
[3100.00 - 3105.16] flax there's that flax glycerin and that
[3102.60 - 3109.00] does help that that gets it in there too
[3105.16 - 3111.36] so Frederick go says why does zinc cause
[3109.00 - 3113.32] nausea for so many on an empty stomach
[3111.36 - 3116.12] so first of all let's go into
[3113.32 - 3117.44] that so
[3116.12 - 3119.80] there's zincs out there they'll just
[3117.44 - 3121.84] make you throw right up they'll just
[3119.80 - 3125.12] make you throw right
[3121.84 - 3126.56] up and that's why like vimergy changed
[3125.12 - 3129.08] the rules with
[3126.56 - 3130.36] zinc you go into the store you go into
[3129.08 - 3131.72] whatever the health food store and you
[3130.36 - 3133.72] look on the rack and you see the
[3131.72 - 3135.40] different zincs and stuff like that you
[3133.72 - 3136.76] take one it's got all that citric acid
[3135.40 - 3138.96] in there and all this other stuff in
[3136.76 - 3140.48] there you take it boom nauseous boom you
[3138.96 - 3143.40] throw up so many people have just
[3140.48 - 3147.00] vomited and vomited because of that the
[3143.40 - 3148.40] liquid zinc sulfate the way it's done
[3147.00 - 3149.92] with the flax glycerin and everything
[3148.40 - 3151.68] else the way it's done with fmer is a
[3149.92 - 3152.92] whole different ballpark but ask your
[3151.68 - 3155.20] doctor what's right for you your doctor
[3152.92 - 3155.20] knows
[3155.96 - 3161.84] best and if you're really really hyper
[3158.60 - 3163.44] sensitive yeah zinc just like selenium
[3161.84 - 3166.08] can make you feel a little nauseous if
[3163.44 - 3168.16] you're really really hyper sensitive but
[3166.08 - 3170.92] the problem is a lot of other things are
[3168.16 - 3174.20] getting you nauseous too keep that in
[3170.92 - 3175.68] mind if you're somebody where zinc a
[3174.20 - 3178.16] really good zinc like you're somebody
[3175.68 - 3181.36] wear a really good zinc like this right
[3178.16 - 3182.56] here gets you slightly nauseous then
[3181.36 - 3183.68] that means you're getting nauseous when
[3182.56 - 3185.20] you eat different things you're getting
[3183.68 - 3186.84] nauseous when you take a different thing
[3185.20 - 3188.80] you're getting nauseous when you do this
[3186.84 - 3190.68] it means you got the Vagas nerve nause
[3188.80 - 3192.96] nausea always
[3190.68 - 3194.28] happening and someone who's sensitive
[3192.96 - 3196.60] and they get the nausea then take it
[3194.28 - 3199.00] with food take your supplements with
[3196.60 - 3200.56] food is what I tell friends and family
[3199.00 - 3202.36] you do what your doctor tells you but
