Ashley thanks for being here amazing so

72
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,720
glad dicing these up right here so this

73
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,480
is the healing potato

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,280
salad so red potatoes are okay Barbara

75
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,560
totally you can use red potatoes I love

76
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,040
red potatoes um it's a great potato and

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,720
you certainly can use it why steamed

78
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,000
Lori because it preserves the nutrients

79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,680
like no other and it's the the makes it

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,480
easy to digest a potato is easiest to

81
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,439
digest when you steam them that's the

82
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,560
critic key right there so you have to

83
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:37,080
steam them not boil them you don't want

84
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,680
to boil them cuz you'll boil that flavor

85
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,720
right out of them too and it'll be in

86
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,599
the water unless you're making a soup

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,760
right unless you're making a soup but

88
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,840
we're not making a soup and you want the

89
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,360
steamed

90
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,760
potatoes not not any other way for this

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,640
for sure

92
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,159
um so I'm dicing this up don't add oil

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,280
don't add butter don't add cheese don't

94
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,239
add any products that's not in the

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
recipe plus you don't want those in

96
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,920
there if you're actually struggling with

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,079
any kind of

98
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,400
condition you certainly don't want those

99
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,519

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:42,320
potatoes a bad

108
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,880
wrap is what people do to potatoes okay

109
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,039
it's not potatoes that give anybody any

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,160
issues or problems potatoes are actually

111
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:52,600
a healing food really healing what the

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,639
problem is it's the milk cheese butter

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,919
oil the Mayo right the egg it's all that

114
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,320
that causes problems with potato cuz

115
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,080
it's not the potato causing the problem

116
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,120
it's all the dairy products the oil the

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,039
the that's drenched in them frying

118
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,000
potatoes that's another thing right

119
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,479
there that causes problems so that's

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,120
what really goes on that's what gives

121
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,120
potatoes a bad wrap right

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,199
there so I'm dicing these up making the

123
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,199
potato salad as we speak here you can

124
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,039
use 2 lbs of

125
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:33,120
potatoes you can roughly peel them I'm

126
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:37,600
roughly dicing

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,600
them okay you don't have to peel

128
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,960
them so I'm getting my potatoes in this

129
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,680
dish right here I want to answer some

130
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,680
questions for you

131
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,600
too but potato is a great food Corn's

132
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,960
not so I'm just letting you know corn is

133
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,199
not a good thing to do cuz cuz I saw

134
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,919
somebody say starch solution it say you

135
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,440
know what happens is that is that you

136
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,479
don't want corn and I know that in the

137
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,639
old days the starch solution stuff was

138
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,919
all about corn disaster there's problems

139
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,840
and holes in everybody's ideas out there

140
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,280
it's really sad how it works because

141
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,560
nobody knows that the corn feeds viruses

142
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,280
so when people are sick with chronic

143
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,800
fatigue and fibro and they're eating

144
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,520
corn in their starch meals lots of corn

145
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,520
they don't know that contributing to

146
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,479
feeding the very bugs that's making them

147
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,199
sick and and really hurting them and but

148
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:41,680
potato that's not the case of potato so

149
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:45,280
potato's antiviral antibacterial NAA

209
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,429
[Music]

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,600
those Caroline says love your chopping

211
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,240
skills do you recommend digestive

212
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,040
enzymes not really I recommend fixing

213
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,040
the digestion that's what I do recommend

214
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,760
so medical meum information is about

215
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,519
give needed tools to fix things like the

216
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,279
celery juice to fix the hydrochloric

217
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,200
acid to fix your stomach gland so your

218
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,760
digestion gets strong All These Years

219
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,160
everybody was doing the digestive

220
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,519
enzymes out there it was a big thing and

221
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,200
they were just pumping them everywhere

222
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,920
they still do but what people don't

223
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,839
understand is it's a Band-Aid or you're

224
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,360
trying to do this Band-Aid so you're

225
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,040
doing dig digestive enzymes it's like a

226
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,920
Band-Aid to things versus actually

227
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,440
fixing a digestive problem fixing the

228
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,880
the liver and its bile strength fixing

229
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,680
the hydrochloric a

230
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,279
in the stomach glands that that produce

231
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,079
the gastric acid the stomach glands

232
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,519
fixing things and then get Ri getting

233
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,639
rid of bad bacteria through using foods

234
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,480
and and also understanding how

235
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,160
everything works like can cleanse the

236
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,000
heel and the new medical medium book

237
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,440
that's coming out um so you can learn I

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,399
got a gut chapter in here that's

239
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,560
mind-blowing so inside the medical

240
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,880
medium uh revised and

241
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,040
expanded so it's really about fixing

242
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,399
things that's what I like to do

243
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,160
um see how do I know different between

244
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,120
cultivated and wild blueberries okay

245
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,160
cultivated blueberries are bigger

246
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,079
they're larger and wild blueberries will

247
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,800
say Wild on the packaging like the

248
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:47,560
Frozen wild blueberries that'll say Wild

249
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,000
on the packaging it's in the freezer

250
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,480
section Frozen wild blueberries so

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,279
that's really important right there

252
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,920
cultivated blueberries are in those clam

253
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,279
shell pint siiz clam shells that you see

254
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,240
in the grocery store where they're all

255
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,360
stacked up and they're bigger they're

256
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,600
their larger blueberries those are still

257
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,880
good for you but they won't do that

258
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,399
healing they won't do that healing that

259
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,440
you need they won't get the toxic heavy

260
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,600
metals out they don't even have the

261
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,360
antioxidant level that the wild

262
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,480
blueberries do or the phytochemical

263
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,000
compounds wild blueberries are antiviral

264
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,959
cultivated blueberries are not antiviral

265
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,079
antibacterial so all those things matter

266
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,519
um they really

267
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:28,639
do so so let's do some like additions

268
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,959
with this potato salad that I'm making

269
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,600
you guys steing potato Sal I got the

270
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,240
diced up Cub potatoes these are steamed

271
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,639
potatoes just so you know I got a 1/4

272
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,040
cup of parsley thrown in there I got a

273
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,839
couple tablespoons of green onion diced

274
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,360
in there and I have a clove of garlic

275
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,199
diced too really finely and thrown in

276
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,279
there just so you know so let's keep on

277
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:51,959
going let's go into some radish land I

278
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,800
don't know if you guys like

279
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:58,040
radishes but I do sulfur comp compounds

280
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,079
and radishes are really healing can

281
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,560
thinly slice these rad es it's what I'm

282
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,560
doing right

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,519
now you don't need a whole lot of

284
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,000
them so you don't need a lot of them

285
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,959
like this is an option right here you

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,959
can do a half a cup of radish put in

287
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,360
here so I'm thinly slicing these

288
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,360
radishes right

289
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,279
now okay Lisa says I make potatoes and

290
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,120
eggs together is that

291
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,000
bad well it all depends you know if you

292
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,399
have any symptoms going on if there's

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,199
any kind of symptom you know when people

294
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,639
have um skin conditions eczema psoriasis

295
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,120
if they have sibo intestinal tract

296
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:49,079
disorders if they have Celiac if they

297
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,920
have Crohn's colitis chronic fatigue

298
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,040
syndrome thyroid problems and anything

299
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,360
like this eggs aren't a good thing for

300
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,560
any of these symptoms or conditions

301
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,959
because what's behind everybody's

302
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,040
sickness and behind autoimmune so if

303
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,720
you're somebody with any kind of

304
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,079
autoimmune what's behind it is viruses

305
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,759
so Epstein bar virus shingles virus um

306
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,040
all the different viruses that's what's

307
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,120
behind autoimmune and they sit inside of

308
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,199
us and we get all these symptoms skin

309
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,360
conditions and everything so with all

310
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:22,800
that said eggs will feed the bugs so

311
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,720
eggs are a bad idea so um I'd keep them

312
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,279
out of your diet if I I would listen to

313
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,880
the medical medium podcast at Apple

314
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,240
podcast and listen to the egg episode

315
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,639
your mind will be blown the information

316
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,120
in that episode so it's a docy series

317
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,920
style podcast it's uh at Apple podcast

318
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,959
medical medium so you can check that out

319
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,160
so um got a half cup of thinly sliced

320
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,959
radishes right here I'm going to pop

321
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,199
these

322
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,480
in that's what I'm going to

323
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,959
do it's one of the options in this

324
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,800
recipe see guys I'm making the healing

325
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,680
potato salad so I just threw the

326
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,920
radishes in there take a look right

327
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,399
partially flat or curly you can use

328
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,000
Either Ore so I use the flat leaf

329
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:05,480
parsley but you can use um either one

330
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,480
perfectly

331
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,399
fine so anyway all right so I'm going to

332
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,240
do some cucumber too that's that's the

333
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,720
next option inside this so thinly half

334
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,120
cup of thinly slice cucumber all right

335
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,079
what I'm going to do is cut the cucumber

336
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,639
in half this is an English cucumber I'm

337
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,560
leaving the skin on this one too here's

338
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,079
a question from Janette by the way this

339
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,720
is an English cucumber I just wanted to

340
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:32,000
show you and I just cut it in half just

341
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,480
so you know that's that's it right there

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,600
um why are so many people sensitive to

343
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,880
onions the people who need them stop

344
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,160
eating them

345
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,600
um so what happens is that a lot of

346
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,079
people they'll have a lot of

347
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,480
sensitivities because they're dealing

348
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,399
with so many different levels of

349
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,800
bacteria in their intestinal tract

350
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,839
that's one reason too so in their

351
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,079
intestinal tract they'll have bacteria

352
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,959
strepto octus is one of the bacteria the

353
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,120
main bacteria in people's intestinal

354
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,120
tract the other one is other ones E coli

355
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,360
and if you got a lot of that in there

356
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,680
including fungus yeast mold if you got a

357
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,319
lot of this inside your intestinal tract

358
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,199
you're going to rock the boat because

359
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:17,199
when you put something like onions in

360
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:19,279
onions is like an antiseptic against

361
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,959
these very bugs and these microorganisms

362
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,120
that aren't great so when you're eating

363
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,839
a little bit of that onion some people

364
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,279
can get a reaction the reaction is um

365
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,079
they feel a little funny in their tummy

366
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,199
maybe or they feel like they got got

367
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:34,959
some extra gas that kind of sensitivity

368
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:38,360
um but but really that's that's that's

369
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,360
what happens there it feels too

370
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,600
strong does radish give Jacqueline says

371
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,480
does radish give nutrition I heard

372
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,079
radish is a

373
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,040
condiment radishes are an incredible

374
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:55,399
food I mean I think I talk about

375
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,800
it here in life-changing Foods I think I

376
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,839
talk about it in some of the other books

377
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,519
too radish is really power ful because

378
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,559
it's it's got a high sulfur Rich

379
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,959
phytochemical compound in it and that

380
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,559
high sulfur Rich pH phytochemical

381
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,000
compound is is anti-bug and you got to

382
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,039
think about here's the thing okay

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,520
everybody's sick because they got these

384
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,720
little bugs inside of them and they got

385
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:25,039
toxic heavy metals too and other toxins

386
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,039
in them and foods have to be detoxifying

387
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,080
but they also have to be anti-bug

388
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,919
anti-pathogen antiviral antibacterial

389
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,080
anti- mold anti- geese anti fungus and

390
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:37,320
some foods are stronger than others for

391
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,880
helping us to heal and radishes that's

392
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,440

gastrointestinal problems so um so an

429
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:20,120
IBS is inflammation that is a mystery to

430
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,840
medical research and science so it's a

431
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,320
mystery to the doctor it's a mystery to

432
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,760
medical research and science they don't

433
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,919
know what IBS is irritable bowel

434
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,679
syndrome so with all the science and

435
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,159
technology in the world and all the

436
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,480
trillions of dollars that went into

437
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,960
medicine so far all they can come up

438
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,360
with with three words irritable bowel

439
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,960
syndrome which means out of all the all

440
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,840
the medical technology we have they came

441
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,120
up with the fact that your bow is

442
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,720
irritable that's all they came out with

443
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,520
like that's it it's like trillions of

444
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,919
dollars they can send a rocket ship into

445
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,600
space um we got the best stereo systems

446
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:00,200
in our cars now but all they can come up

447
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,200
with with IBS is it's irritable so

448
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,000
you're irritable that's it so you got an

449
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,400
irritable problem in your gut that's all

450
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,799
they can come up with it when you really

451
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,480
size it up and see how stupid it is and

452
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:14,080
see how actually crazy it is and when

453
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,240
you actually look at the truth of things

454
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,679
and see where technology is and and the

455
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,080
medical world is it's it's remedial it's

456
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,520
really sad sure you get into a car

457
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,159
accident they try to piece you back

458
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,679
together in the hospital and and keep

459
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,000
you alive and try to put your broken

460
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,080
bones together but you know and Sur too

461
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,559
your gallbladder is about to pop they'll

462
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,080
take it out for you but when it comes

463
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,400
down to so many things when it comes

464
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,200
down to all these mystery illnesses and

465
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,880
autoimmune and and hundreds of

466
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,320
autoimmune conditions they've labeled

467
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,760
now they don't know the cause and they

468
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,520
don't know the cause of celiac they

469
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,159
don't know the cause of anything

470
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,760
gastroparesis they just don't know the

471
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:55,440
cause so it so with IBS it's

472
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,600
inflammation yeah but it's inflammation

473
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,400
from Little buggies that are inside the

474
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,000
intestinal tract so and little buggies

475
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,360
cause a lot of problems and then what

476
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,679
happens is when you eat gluten and when

477
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,360
you eat dairy products it could make IBS

478
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,000
worse even if it doesn't make it worse

479
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,159
that day it could make it worse a week

480
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,799
later and then then you kind of don't

481
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,679
know what did it you kind of don't know

482
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:21,240
what's going on so if I had IBS I'd be

483
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,799
off gluten I'd be off dairy products I'd

484
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,600
be off um milk cheese butter I wouldn't

485
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,600
be doing that I'd be off eggs I would be

486
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,919
off all that that's what I would do and

487
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,000
and then then I would learn hey what's

488
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,880
the cause of IBS so I would try to find

489
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,880
out the cause of IBS and then learn how

490
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,799
to heal it so that's cleanse the heel

491
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,600
right there if you see it I know it's

492
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,840
kind of shiny on the screen so that's

493
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,799
cleanse the heel I have IBS in the book

494
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,720

lemon juice on here is what I'm going to

548
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,200
do there we

549
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,159
go a lemon seed went in and I'm going to

550
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,960
grab that lemon seed real quick get it

551
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,240
out don't you hate what that

552
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,880
happens what if you have a sulfur

553
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,039
allergy sulfur allergy is different than

554
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:26,039
what's in a radish so that's not the

555
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:27,799
same sulfur so the sulfur um for for

556
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,840
sulfur allergy is a whole different

557
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,039
chemical a whole different element it's

558
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,320
a whole different compound it's a

559
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:38,720
different chemical compound um this is

560
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:42,760
this we're made out of sulfur we're made

561
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,240
out of sulfur from plant material like

562
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,559
we're made out of sulf that's what's in

563
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,679
all vegetables that's what's in all

564
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:53,159
fruit all herbs I'm drinking some

565
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,320
traditional medicinal tea right now so

566
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm drinking some tea I got some nettle

567
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,320
leaf tea in the moment okay and um

568
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,120
there's sulfur in the nettle Leaf so

569
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,360
whatever herb you've ever had you know

570
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,840
have you had lemon bomb nettle Leaf

571
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,360
peppermint Peppermint's got sulfur in it

572
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,919
it's it's it's the fundamental basis of

573
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,159
life so that's not the same sulfur

574
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,720
chemical compounds that you'd be

575
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,200
allergic to um that's a whole different

576
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,960
that's a whole different kind of thing

577
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,200
this is something that's in food

578
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,440
entirely

579
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,640
different um so if you've been told that

580
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,840
you're allergic to a vegetable or a

581
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,159
radish

582
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,960
that can happen out there well they'll

583
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,080
tell you you know you get testing for

584
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,240
food testing it's totally messed up it's

585
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,480
totally backwards in so many ways and

586
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,320
the problem is with all those tests is

587
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,080
whoever created them doesn't know why

588
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,840
anybody's sick so here we go we're going

589
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,600
to tell somebody don't eat the radish

590
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,880
don't eat this don't eat a strawberry

591
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,640
don't eat an apple don't eat cilantro

592
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,799
don't eat this this this don't have

593
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,440
asparagus you know you're sensitive to

594
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,799
asparagus they'll say on the test don't

595
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,679
have cucumber knock that off the test

596
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,080
don't have lemon that's bad you and

597
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,240
they'll do this thing where now you're

598
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,320
just stuck with some meat and some

599
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,000
chicken and then they'll give you

600
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,760
something odd to eat like you'll be able

601
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,880
to eat like uh you'll be able to eat

602
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,600
like a zucchini or something they'll

603
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,520
give you like a few things to eat and

604
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,279
now you're totally stuck you're like you

605
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:21,000
have 50 things they say you're you know

606
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:24,039
you're sensitive to and meanwhile these

607
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,640
foods are the foods that are helping you

608
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,399
heal a problem that they're not

609
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,760
detecting and that happens with food

610
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:30,360
allergy testing

611
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,600
food sensitivity testing now it's

612
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,760
different if you're really allergic

613
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,919
where you eat an asparagus and now you

614
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,960
can't breathe or something and your

615
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,760
throat closes well then you're allergic

616
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,200
to an asparagus pressing Prince hey good

617
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,840
to see you um you love to eat radishes

618
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,880
and you love eating their leaves too in

619
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,640
salads incredible incredible yeah I the

620
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,840
radish leaves are really healing in

621
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,480
salads too you put those in your salads

622
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,799
that's an amazing thing to do so I got

623
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,159
the lemon in there so I want to put a

624
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,159
little garlic

625
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,200
powder um but here's the thing you know

626
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,520
what what people don't realize is that

627
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,480
people don't realize is that you don't

628
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,799
when you don't know why someone's sick

629
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,279
it's easy to just mess things up so you

630
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,960
tell somebody hey you're allergic to

631
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,159
these 20 Foods you're allergic to celery

632
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,720
you're allergic to Strawberry you're

633
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,919
allergic to Apple and you tell and it's

634
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,880
like what you don't even know why

635
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,679
they're sick you don't even know what's

636
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:30,679
wrong with them um you know it's it's

637
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,520
it's when it's a rash they don't even

638
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,960
know what causes a r here's the thing if

639
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,200
you eat a food that you're really

640
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,200
allergic to and you get a rash right

641
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,360
that second or your stomach gets really

642
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,760
crazyer funnier T right in that second

643
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,640
then you might have a sensitivity to

644
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,399
that food you know but like if it's like

645
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:54,559
really really Intense or something but

646
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:56,240
other than that you know nothing happens

647
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,039
you eat a piece of radish and nothing

648
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,240
happens you know you eat an asparagus

649
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,559
and nothing happens and even

650
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,840
then and even then what you know what

651
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:08,760
people don't realize is that you know

652
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:13,000
rashes like from eczema rashes from

653
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:16,679
psoriasis vitiligo rosacea they're viral

654
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
so these are viral things and IBS is

655
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:22,159
strepto coctus it's bacterial

656
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,840
and sometimes you'll eat some foods and

657
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,519
you're cleaning all that up and you

658
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,559
might see some rashes come and go but

659
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,080
that's different that's different than

660
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,760
eating a strawberry and then your throat

661
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,799
swells up or something and you break out

662
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,159
in hives or something that's that's

663
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,880
different you know it's an entirely

664
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,640
different thing that's when someone

665
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,440
actually has a real food allergy or

666
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,919
something you know when they experience

667
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,399
it in that very second their throat

668
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,120
swells up or something and you know like

669
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:50,600
with peanuts like with peanuts something

670
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,919
like that so um other than that I know

671
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,960
that so many people they don't have food

672
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,880
allergies to their foods and they're

673
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,039
just they're just told got to eat them

674
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,440
so they don't eat a radish they never

675
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,919
try it they don't eat a piece of

676
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,840
eggplant they don't have a cucumber they

677
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:10,600
don't have anything and um and people

678
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,039
get hives all the time but it's not from

679
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,760
the healthy foods they're eating so

680
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:15,799
anyway I want to mix this

681
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,000
up is what I'm going to do so I'm going

682
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:19,000
to mix this potato salad

683
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:24,399
[Music]

684
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,039
up lot of people have chemical

685
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,760
sensitivities out there a lot of people

686
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,200
have chemical sensitivity because

687
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,840
they're they got the Epstein bar virus

688
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,159
they're they got lots of metals in their

689
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,360
system and between the Epstein bar virus

690
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,120
and metals that alone can give somebody

691
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,840
so many chemical sensitivities they

692
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,399
become sensitive to everything as far as

693
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,080
chemical wise so that's important to

694
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,320
know they'll get hives because of

695
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,200
chemical sensitivities that's really

696
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,679

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,320
the heel it's a medical textbook so you

got these options so they're there for

745
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,120
you that's that's the whole point but

746
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm excited about the potato salad it's

747
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,600
going to be delicious

748
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,679
so Karen says what book do you recommend

749
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,159
for chemical sensitivities I recommend

750
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:05,240
cleanse the heel so if I open up cleanse

751
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,360
the

752
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,360
heel right

753
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,360
here

754
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,480
um so if I open up cleanse the heel I

755
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,080
don't know if you can see this but it's

756
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,200
going to say chemical and food

757
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,120
sensitivities for some reason the

758
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,240
lighting is doing something weird

759
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,000
today um chemical and food sensitivities

760
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,519
and I talk about the true cause of

761
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,600
chemical sensitivities the true cause of

762
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,960
food sensitivities and I talk about what

763
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,480
to do for it everything I mean this book

764
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,279
right here just has that right in here

765
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,240
it's over 200 symptoms and conditions in

766
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:46,480
this book so I'm excited about

767
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:49,399
this um so this is a recipe that's

768
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,519
helpful for the digestion it's it's easy

769
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:53,600
on the system there's no fat in this

770
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,039
recipe so it's important to know not to

771
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,399
put oil in your potato salad in this

772
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,440
recipe don't put oil in there there

773
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,639
don't put nut Butters in there don't

774
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,639
throw Chicken in there has nothing to do

775
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:06,639
whether if I like animal protein or I

776
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:07,840
like vegan diets or animal protein diets

777
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:10,240
has nothing to do with that it's just

778
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,000
this recipe is meant to help heal the

779
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,919
liver help you gently cleanse out toxins

780
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,639
and poisons keep you strong so it's a

781
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,639
really good powerful recipe right there

782
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,840
I'm reading some questions right here do

783
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,440
you like mustard powder better than

784
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,840
using

785
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,240
mustard well when you use mustard you

786
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,679
got to remember there's vinegar in there

787
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,600
so keep that in mind and vinegar is a

788
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,880
problem so vinegar can really be a

789
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,519
problem it's it's it's highly agitating

790
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,279
to the liver it's irritating to the

791
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,679
liver um and that's a whole another

792
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:58,399
story so and mustard pow unless it's a

793
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,639
mustard recipe for medical medium maybe

794
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,159
my blog medical mem.com at the blog and

795
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,880
it's a mustard recipe that's another

796
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:07,039
story but mustards out there in the

797
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,560
little squeezy bottles it's got vinegar

798
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,359
in there so you got to look out for that

799
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,399
and that's a big issue I see a question

800
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,200
here Karen my Eczema is flaring up after

801
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:17,839
eight months of 369 is that part of the

802
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,000
healing process are you doing eight

803
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,679
months of 369 the whole time is you

804
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,679
taking breaks what are you eating in

805
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,320
between

806
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:32,679
369 is it the 369 Advanced or 369

807
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,399
uh simplified 369 original 369 Advanced

808
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,520
are you doing the heavy metal detox

809
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,200
smoothie at all because eczema is caused

810
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,679
by two things it's caused by the epine

811
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,599
bar in combination with copper inside

812
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,879
the liver so that's copper inside the

813
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,079
liver so are you doing anything to get

814
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:52,000
the copper out of the liver because

815
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,119
until the copper completely comes out of

816
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,280
the liver then you're free so are you

817
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,040
doing the heavy metal detox smoothie um

818
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,079
are you doing any of the antio antiviral

819
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,920
protocols so when I look at cleanse to

820
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,920
heel and I look at

821
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,480
eczema and you can take this to your

822
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,280
doctor and you can ALS or healthc care

823
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,000
provider or health coach or whoever's in

824
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,560
whoever's in charge of your health care

825
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,040
um you can take this to them but when I

826
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,960
look into eczema I'm going to find it

827
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,599
here

828
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,960
um so exoman psoriasis including rosacea

829
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,880
lupus style rashes and some other things

830
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,760
too some in here right now okay um and

831
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,400
I'm looking I'm seeing supplements and

832
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,680
dosages

833
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,560
so some people can get rid of their

834
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,119
eczema by just doing the 369 after a

835
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,240
week or two right and their eczema

836
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:43,800
starts to clear up some people can get

837
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,599
rid of their eczema doing the mono

838
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,520
eating cleanse some people get rid of

839
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,880
their eczema by just you doing the 28

840
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,240
day cleanse like like in the medical

841
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,800
medium book here but it all depends some

842
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,920
people have more copper inside their

843
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,880
liver causing the eczema some people end

844
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,079
up having two or three varieties of

845
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,800
Epstein bar inside their liver so or

846
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,400
they'll get exposed and get another

847
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,960
epsteam bar three years after they got

848
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,520
their eczema better and then three years

849
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,200
later they pick up another viral uh a

850
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,920
viral load and then they're you know

851
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,800
they they end up getting something else

852
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,000
but you have to have copper inside the

853
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:24,480
liver in order to have eczema and So

854
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,400
when you buy new clothing brand new

855
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,200
clothing there's copper in the fungus

856
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,920
side

857
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,160
and you know they sell copper clothing

858
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,720
now right you know copper clothing type

859
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,560
stuff where they got copper weaved into

860
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,000
clothing now and stuff like that socks

861
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,720
and other things and all that highly

862
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,200
toxic because that's copper that gets in

863
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,640
our system they um and then fungicides

864
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,839
pesticides everything scented candles

865
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,839
have copper in it um air fresheners it

866
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,560
all depends on your exposures too so I

867
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:55,319
talked about so I talked this about a

868
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,000
doctor recently about ezim and psoriasis

869
00:36:55,319 --> 00:37:00,400
and people get new exposures too they'll

870
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,440
get scented candle exposure and then a

871
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,599
month later they end up getting a flare

872
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,599
or they'll get air freshener exposure

873
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,680
and they'll get a flare or cologne

874
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,040
exposure so perfume in Cologne exposure

875
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,960
I've seen people order new clothes the

876
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,560
new clothes come they try them on and

877
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,480
they got perfume on them from somebody

878
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,480
else trying them on and all of a sudden

879
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,720
it flares things up because perfume

880
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,319
cologne have copper in them copper is a

881
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,280
heavy metal toxic heavy metal used in

882
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:29,280
perfume clones scented candles

883
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,040
pesticides herbicides fungicides air

884
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,599
fresheners and everybody should be

885
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,119
complaining to all these companies

886
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:37,560
because we're just they just they're

887
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,839
just contaminating everybody but so

888
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,280
there's a couple things you could do you

889
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,240
can go to your practitioner doctor and

890
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,000
you can look at the supplements too for

891
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,000
examon orasis you could be like well am

892
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,200
I doing all these am I doing some of

893
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,640
these and so and that's what's in here

894
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,359
so I don't know if you guys could see

895
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,839
that it's kind of Whiting out on there

896
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,520
um but the whole thing is that when you

897
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,400
look here when you look here you can

898
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,079
start out with you read the supplement

899
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,599
chapter in cleans the heel and you can

900
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,280
read like the information you can try a

901
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,640
few different supplements for it you can

902
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,119
go to your practitioner and see if your

903
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,000
practitioner wants you to try more and

904
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,920
then it and then you're doing the heavy

905
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,839
metal detox smoothie too so when you go

906
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,200
in here there's a heavy metal

907
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,319
detox um smoothie in here the reason for

908
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,400
that is to get the copper out so when

909
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:28,040
that when it comes down to that you got

910
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,400
like the vimergy spirulina the barley

911
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,280
grass cheese powder in the heavy metal

912
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,720
detox smoothie I talked about that the

913
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:38,040
other day and when you get out when you

914
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,280
get out the copper then you get you get

915
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,240
you know you move forward you move

916
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,200
forward and then the supplementations

917
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,319
for the ant that's the whole antiviral

918
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,520
thing too but also if you're doing the

919
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:50,680
369 or you doing it how's how's the

920
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,200
process going like are you doing

921
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,400
caffeine at all in between it did you

922
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,720
have chocolate in between chocolate is

923
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,319
the eczema instigator so if you had

924
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,640
chocolate a month ago you can end up

925
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:03,520
with a cycle of eczema a month later cuz

926
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,640
it's an instigator because it jacks up

927
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,440
the adrenals and the adrenals push out

928
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,560
copper everywhere that's in your liver

929
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,880
so any kind of caffeine any kind of

930
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,400
chocolate any kind of tea any kind of

931
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,480
coffee drinks um these are just some of

932
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,760
the things are you staying away from

933
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,560
vinegar are you staying away from

934
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,480
nutritional yeast uh make sure no eggs

935
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,560
get in the diet between the 369 and

936
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,800
maybe you're doing a 369 8 months

937
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,079
straight and nothing's getting in so you

938
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,280
got to try some of those other things

939
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:30,720
I'm talking about um you can talk to

940
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,960
your practitioner but I'm trying to give

941
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,280
you any

942
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,680
insight um to make sure that you know

943
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,760
you get every chance to recover like so

944
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,960
many millions have with exim mons orias

945
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,960
um or you under a lot of stress stress

946
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,200
triggers the adrenals when the adrenals

947
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,400
are flooding the heart rate goes up the

948
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,119
adrenaline pushes out old storage bins

949
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,119
of copper deeper out of the liver and

950
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,160
now you got a little bit of a flare up

951
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,599
that's how it works so um it just

952
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,160
happens anyway um but you're in the

953
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,680
healing process you're doing all the

954
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,040
right things and you just keep you can

955
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,720
go further you can go a little bit

956
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,560
further and that's how it's set up so

957
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,440
you can go as far farther as you need to

958
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,400
