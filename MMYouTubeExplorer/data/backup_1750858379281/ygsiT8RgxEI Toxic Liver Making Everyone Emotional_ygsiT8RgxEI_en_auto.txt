[125.68 - 129.28] you know i mean so many times i've
[127.92 - 131.84] watched that
[129.28 - 135.12] and so health is just so important and
[131.84 - 138.64] right now it's critical
[135.12 - 140.88] to keep our immune system strong because
[138.64 - 143.04] our immune systems get weakened and
[140.88 - 145.20] beaten down that's how the system's set
[143.04 - 147.92] up the system is set up to beat us down
[145.20 - 149.36] to beat us down to beat us down even the
[147.92 - 151.20] time change
[149.36 - 153.28] just so you know you guys the whole time
[151.20 - 154.08] change the whole time the one hour time
[153.28 - 156.80] shift
[154.08 - 159.16] that's actually to throw us off our game
[156.80 - 161.92] and weaken our immune systems and
[159.16 - 164.08] destabilize us that's what that is i'm
[161.92 - 166.16] going to talk about that one day i've
[164.08 - 167.60] been saying this for years but
[166.16 - 168.72] i'm going to go into details on that if
[167.60 - 169.84] you guys just came on here we're talking
[168.72 - 171.04] about the liver we're talking about the
[169.84 - 173.60] liver's immune system we're talking
[171.04 - 176.40] about the skin conditions of liver
[173.60 - 179.44] including acne we're talking about
[176.40 - 182.32] emotions when you have a sick liver
[179.44 - 184.72] things can get heated up emotional
[182.32 - 187.04] emotional yellow rings true it's true
[184.72 - 188.16] michelle l you said you knew
[187.04 - 190.56] yeah
[188.16 - 192.64] yeah the time change is not supposed to
[190.56 - 194.32] happen they're not supposed to do the
[192.64 - 196.56] time change
[194.32 - 199.04] that's not any natural occurrence that's
[196.56 - 201.36] control that's that's because
[199.04 - 202.32] that's all about controlling the human
[201.36 - 204.08] race
[202.32 - 207.52] and weakening them because the time
[204.08 - 209.52] chain change stresses people out gets
[207.52 - 211.76] them sick that's what it does that's
[209.52 - 214.48] what they do that's the whole point it's
[211.76 - 216.08] actually to knock people down
[214.48 - 218.56] they try to try to knock you down
[216.08 - 219.60] wherever they can that's how it's done

[347.60 - 352.64] everyone slowly purposely not the doctor
[350.56 - 353.84] on purpose doctors are great they're
[352.64 - 356.48] trained
[353.84 - 359.28] to bloodlet you to lower your immune
[356.48 - 360.64] system let viruses take over let let
[359.28 - 364.32] pathogens take over break down your
[360.64 - 366.00] immune system and and quicken a death

[840.48 - 845.36] is that what people don't realize
[844.08 - 848.24] about

[848.24 - 853.12] we become toxic
[850.72 - 856.00] when the liver becomes toxic our brain
[853.12 - 859.52] becomes toxic when your liver becomes
[856.00 - 861.68] toxic your brain
[859.52 - 864.24] becomes toxic
[861.68 - 866.00] because when your liver gets backed up

[1046.16 - 1049.68] the whole thing about pandas is what
[1047.92 - 1052.24] people don't really understand is that
[1049.68 - 1054.16] it's not just streptococcus pandas is
[1052.24 - 1056.88] more than streptococcus
[1054.16 - 1058.64] streptococcus is a co-factor in pan with
[1056.88 - 1062.00] pandas and that's what people don't
[1058.64 - 1063.44] realize it's the co-factor to pandas

[1071.84 - 1075.92] and different strains and the different
[1073.44 - 1077.52] varieties of strep that everybody has
[1075.92 - 1079.04] everybody has everybody walks around
[1077.52 - 1081.04] with all the different strips right the
[1079.04 - 1084.24] whole bit is any any child that had

[1122.32 - 1126.56] if you just came on on telegram
[1124.80 - 1128.08] this came on youtube we're talking about
[1126.56 - 1129.84] the liver we're talking about emotional
[1128.08 - 1132.16] liver we're talking about what happens
[1129.84 - 1135.52] when our liver gets stagnant and
[1132.16 - 1138.00] sluggish it poisons our brain
[1135.52 - 1140.80] the liver is supposed to hold on to the
[1138.00 - 1143.28] poisons and toxins until we give it a
[1140.80 - 1145.36] chance to safely guide it out
[1143.28 - 1147.52] so what liver rescue is it's a way to
[1145.36 - 1149.04] safely guide out poisons and toxins in a
[1147.52 - 1151.28] way that can be really helpful so
[1149.04 - 1153.28] someone can get that liver cleaned up
[1151.28 - 1155.04] right but everybody walks around with
[1153.28 - 1157.36] these toxic livers and then the brain
[1155.04 - 1159.36] gets intoxicated and when the brain gets
[1157.36 - 1160.80] intoxicated then we all of a sudden end
[1159.36 - 1162.88] up getting blood draws that's a whole
[1160.80 - 1165.76] nother thing all on its own julie said

[1165.76 - 1172.00] is that is so amazing that's so special
[1169.52 - 1174.88] when our brain gets intoxicated with all
[1172.00 - 1175.68] the different poisons and toxins
[1174.88 - 1177.68] then
[1175.68 - 1179.76] we're now in a place where we get we get
[1177.68 - 1180.88] triggered do you guys know anybody i
[1179.76 - 1182.16] want to ask you guys something do you
[1180.88 - 1183.68] guys know anybody that gets triggered
[1182.16 - 1185.52] easy
[1183.68 - 1187.92] right a little trigger triggered into
[1185.52 - 1190.24] anxiety easy
[1187.92 - 1192.08] triggered soma says love the liver
[1190.24 - 1194.24] rescue book so amazing you know anybody
[1192.08 - 1196.24] that gets triggered easy in any way like
[1194.24 - 1198.64] emotionally or their anxiety gets
[1196.24 - 1200.56] triggered easy or they get you know
[1198.64 - 1201.60] triggered in any way
[1200.56 - 1205.04] right
[1201.60 - 1207.92] mood mood swings and all that liver
[1205.04 - 1210.56] gets so stagnant and so sluggish in so
[1207.92 - 1212.40] many people
[1210.56 - 1214.00] i just saw how can i stop sugar cravings
[1212.40 - 1216.96] there's a mystery
[1214.00 - 1218.16] mystery hunger section in here
[1216.96 - 1219.60] and
[1218.16 - 1222.48] so what happens is that when your liver
[1219.60 - 1224.40] gets toxic like that okay
[1222.48 - 1226.64] when that happens we get triggered easy
[1224.40 - 1228.40] because the brain gets saturated so keep
[1226.64 - 1230.32] that in mind
[1228.40 - 1231.68] the brain gets saturated so everybody's
[1230.32 - 1233.44] saying me
[1231.68 - 1235.60] right there i see on tik tok everybody's
[1233.44 - 1237.44] saying me it happens to me it happens to
[1235.60 - 1239.28] me there too on youtube
[1237.44 - 1241.52] allison so
[1239.28 - 1244.80] we go through this thing where we can
[1241.52 - 1246.96] get unstable right we feel unstable we
[1244.80 - 1249.92] don't feel strong
[1246.96 - 1252.48] like we just don't feel strong
[1249.92 - 1254.48] we feel like we can break easy you guys
[1252.48 - 1257.04] ever feel that you feel like you could
[1254.48 - 1259.92] break easy you feel like you you're not
[1257.04 - 1262.32] strong you feel like you're not tough or
[1259.92 - 1264.24] something or you're you're sensitive but
[1262.32 - 1266.08] you're not you are strong and that's the
[1264.24 - 1268.32] whole thing people don't realize just
[1266.08 - 1270.24] because if you don't feel strong and you
[1268.32 - 1272.08] don't feel confident about your your
[1270.24 - 1273.68] health and your health strength
[1272.08 - 1275.84] it doesn't mean you're not the strongest
[1273.68 - 1277.92] person out there people with chronic
[1275.84 - 1279.68] illness and symptoms and conditions are
[1277.92 - 1282.32] the strong ones
[1279.68 - 1284.80] they're the strong ones but but yet it's
[1282.32 - 1287.20] easy to get triggered because you're
[1284.80 - 1289.12] bearing so much
[1287.20 - 1291.68] and that's what people don't realize
[1289.12 - 1293.84] when your liver gets all toxic
[1291.68 - 1296.00] and sluggish right
[1293.84 - 1299.28] it gets toxic and sluggish
[1296.00 - 1302.48] and tired and stagnant
[1299.28 - 1304.72] all the toxins go into the brain
[1302.48 - 1307.12] and then if you already have
[1304.72 - 1308.64] symptoms and conditions you're already
[1307.12 - 1310.64] sensitive
[1308.64 - 1312.80] you're already struggling so you can be
[1310.64 - 1314.32] triggered easier and then you can feel
[1312.80 - 1315.52] like you're not a strong person you
[1314.32 - 1317.60] could feel like you're not strong and
[1315.52 - 1318.64] then people around you're like oh
[1317.60 - 1320.32] you know
[1318.64 - 1322.16] god there goes your symptoms again and
[1320.32 - 1324.32] there goes your problems again i mean
[1322.16 - 1327.20] while you're the strongest person
[1324.32 - 1329.52] because look what you're bearing
[1327.20 - 1332.40] it's hard to have a symptom and
[1329.52 - 1333.52] condition and be struggling so when
[1332.40 - 1335.92] someone
[1333.52 - 1337.52] like you guys and people i know are
[1335.92 - 1339.68] struggling with something you need to
[1337.52 - 1341.76] know how strong you really are even if
[1339.68 - 1343.44] you get triggered easy and feel like
[1341.76 - 1345.12] you're weak
[1343.44 - 1347.52] you're not weak
[1345.12 - 1349.52] because guess what people out there who
[1347.52 - 1351.36] seem strong who don't have a symptom and
[1349.52 - 1354.40] condition if they were sick they would
[1351.36 - 1356.40] fall the heck apart
[1354.40 - 1359.36] i can't tell you how many times i've
[1356.40 - 1361.12] heard from people like oh my god
[1359.36 - 1363.12] my husband got sick for the first time
[1361.12 - 1366.40] in his life and he's crying like a baby
[1363.12 - 1368.48] every single day meanwhile aw i've been
[1366.40 - 1370.48] sick for 20 years
[1368.48 - 1372.64] and i've had all kinds of conditions and
[1370.48 - 1374.96] symptoms and he's sick with his first
[1372.64 - 1376.00] thing he's bawling and he can't handle
[1374.96 - 1377.44] it
[1376.00 - 1378.80] i mean people with chronic heal i hear
[1377.44 - 1379.92] that all the time people with chronic
[1378.80 - 1381.60] illness
[1379.92 - 1382.88] symptoms and conditions are really the
[1381.60 - 1385.04] strong ones
[1382.88 - 1387.52] but then but we don't feel strong we
[1385.04 - 1390.16] feel weak we feel kicked down we feel
[1387.52 - 1391.92] not confident right on telegram you guys
[1390.16 - 1393.52] right on tick-tock you feel not
[1391.92 - 1396.40] confident
[1393.52 - 1398.08] and you feel you feel kind of weakened
[1396.40 - 1400.56] but really you're strong but what
[1398.08 - 1402.72] happens is you get triggered easy
[1400.56 - 1404.24] because the liver is all
[1402.72 - 1406.80] dirtied up
[1404.24 - 1408.72] it's all filled with toxins
[1406.80 - 1412.16] diana says i remember i started becoming
[1408.72 - 1415.28] emotional around 25 i used to control my
[1412.16 - 1416.64] emotions really well before
[1415.28 - 1419.20] yeah
[1416.64 - 1421.12] what happens is the liver gets
[1419.20 - 1423.20] all clogged up
[1421.12 - 1425.68] we get some symptoms
[1423.20 - 1428.24] we get triggered easy because the brain
[1425.68 - 1430.72] gets filled up with stuff
[1428.24 - 1432.72] that's why because the brain gets filled
[1430.72 - 1436.08] up with stuff the brain gets filled up
[1432.72 - 1437.68] with copper that's a big one right there
[1436.08 - 1440.24] copper
[1437.68 - 1442.80] so much copper we get into our brain
[1440.24 - 1444.56] toxic copper everybody's everybody's in
[1442.80 - 1446.40] touch with toxic copper it's everywhere
[1444.56 - 1448.88] it's coming out of air fresheners it's
[1446.40 - 1450.80] in colognes and perfumes toxic copper is
[1448.88 - 1451.76] everywhere it fills up in the liver
[1450.80 - 1454.96] right
[1451.76 - 1457.44] everybody gets filled up with aluminum
[1454.96 - 1459.04] fluoride treatments anybody
[1457.44 - 1460.72] fluoride treatments
[1459.04 - 1462.48] anybody have a fluoride treatment it
[1460.72 - 1465.04] builds up in the liver and builds up in
[1462.48 - 1467.44] the liver and the next thing you know it
[1465.04 - 1469.60] that fluoride treatment finally hits the
[1467.44 - 1471.68] brain and now you're you get triggered
[1469.60 - 1473.68] easy emotionally
[1471.68 - 1475.84] emotionally then you get blamed in your
[1473.68 - 1477.20] relationship if you're in a relationship
[1475.84 - 1478.72] if you're not in a relationship you get
[1477.20 - 1480.24] blamed by a friend if you're not in a
[1478.72 - 1481.68] relationship you get blamed by a family
[1480.24 - 1483.60] member but if you're in a relationship
[1481.68 - 1485.20] you get blamed by the other person in
[1483.60 - 1487.76] the relationship
[1485.20 - 1490.56] you're just way too emotional
[1487.76 - 1492.64] yeah it's her fault she's the problem
[1490.56 - 1494.32] she's the one causing all this
[1492.64 - 1496.16] and then you're at counseling you're at
[1494.32 - 1497.92] marriage counseling or partner
[1496.16 - 1499.44] counseling boyfriend girlfriend
[1497.92 - 1501.28] counseling and you're out of counselors
[1499.44 - 1504.64] and the counselor is just like now tell
[1501.28 - 1506.48] me what's all the problem here
[1504.64 - 1508.08] now that the council is like so what's
[1506.48 - 1510.48] all the problem here and then the guy's
[1508.08 - 1512.48] like she's just too emotional she just
[1510.48 - 1514.72] can't keep her crap together every
[1512.48 - 1517.60] little thing just gets her upset
[1514.72 - 1519.28] everything's going on or or she's like
[1517.60 - 1521.92] you know if it's flipped around she's
[1519.28 - 1523.52] like he's just angry all the time he's
[1521.92 - 1525.68] always angry
[1523.52 - 1527.76] he comes home from work he's angry you

[1527.76 - 1533.04] to watch what he wants to watch he just
[1530.40 - 1535.68] plays on his computer he's angry i can't
[1533.04 - 1538.08] get any words out of him he's
[1535.68 - 1540.84] he's uh he's cranky he doesn't say good
[1538.08 - 1543.84] night at night right like whatever it
[1540.84 - 1545.28] is a big part of it
[1543.84 - 1547.04] is that liver
[1545.28 - 1548.56] i was a lot of a lot of guys out there
[1547.04 - 1551.28] with angry livers

[1556.40 - 1560.64] gets filled up with everything the liver
[1558.40 - 1562.32] is overflowing and i love liver rescue

[1577.04 - 1584.08] sensitive too emotional all the time for
[1580.24 - 1585.60] for 10 years 10 of these years and what
[1584.08 - 1589.76] happens is that
[1585.60 - 1591.92] our livers get clogged up and stagnant
[1589.76 - 1593.84] and they get all these things in there
[1591.92 - 1597.04] like muck like
[1593.84 - 1599.12] viral muck too they get all this viral
[1597.04 - 1601.44] muck in there
[1599.12 - 1602.32] courtney ma says my husband has an angry
[1601.44 - 1604.72] liver
[1602.32 - 1607.12] i believe it i believe it
[1604.72 - 1608.96] and we get all these pathogens inside
[1607.12 - 1611.20] the liver and it builds up and the
[1608.96 - 1613.20] pathogens are eating things in the liver
[1611.20 - 1615.76] the pathogens are eating copper and
[1613.20 - 1617.52] aluminum the pathogens are eating stuff
[1615.76 - 1618.48] inside the liver
[1617.52 - 1620.40] and then
[1618.48 - 1622.24] all that stuff comes barreling out of
[1620.40 - 1624.80] the liver and it ends or ends up in the
[1622.24 - 1626.48] brain the brain's toxic now now we got
[1624.80 - 1628.40] brain fog and now we got short
[1626.48 - 1630.80] circuiting and now we're cranky now
[1628.40 - 1632.72] we're irritable now we're triggered easy
[1630.80 - 1633.92] now we're emotional and that's what
[1632.72 - 1636.00] happens
[1633.92 - 1638.72] i'm giving you guys the rundown about
[1636.00 - 1640.64] those angry livers everybody has

[1686.88 - 1690.64] you got the pathogens and the
[1688.08 - 1692.48] streptococcus it's easy to be triggered

[1698.88 - 1702.72] pressure it's like bottlenecking it's

[1711.44 - 1715.84] mean i hear about it anyway
[1714.40 - 1717.20] yeah
[1715.84 - 1719.20] so
[1717.20 - 1721.84] sarah says ayurveda has been teaching
[1719.20 - 1724.00] this for thousands of years
[1721.84 - 1726.48] sarah arvetta hasn't been teaching this
[1724.00 - 1728.64] for thousands of years and no disrespect
[1726.48 - 1730.08] no disrespect i know i know they tell
[1728.64 - 1732.08] you that
[1730.08 - 1734.08] but they haven't they irvetta didn't
[1732.08 - 1737.20] know about pathogens
[1734.08 - 1738.72] um shen says ayurveda is man-made
[1737.20 - 1741.20] i got
[1738.72 - 1742.64] majorly duped by ayurvedic doctors and
[1741.20 - 1744.48] so has
[1742.64 - 1745.84] thousands of other people and thousands
[1744.48 - 1748.00] of the people that came to see me in my
[1745.84 - 1750.96] office over the last 30 years
[1748.00 - 1753.20] so yeah it's no disrespect i know some
[1750.96 - 1754.72] cool air vetted doctors ayurvedic
[1753.20 - 1756.72] doctors that are really cool it's just
[1754.72 - 1758.48] that ayurvedic medicine didn't know
[1756.72 - 1759.36] about pathogens so they didn't know
[1758.48 - 1761.84] about
[1759.36 - 1765.12] viruses ever they didn't know that
[1761.84 - 1766.80] epstein-barr causes fibromyalgia and
[1765.12 - 1769.52] epstein-barr feeds off of copper and
[1766.80 - 1770.72] causes eczema so for thousands of years
[1769.52 - 1773.36] ayurvedic medicine didn't know that
[1770.72 - 1776.24] there's no disrespect it's just fact
[1773.36 - 1778.08] ayurvedic medicine talked about
[1776.24 - 1780.24] talked about other things
[1778.08 - 1782.24] but and they didn't talk about the liver
[1780.24 - 1784.72] overflowing with poisons and toxins
[1782.24 - 1788.16] either saturating the brain and causing
[1784.72 - 1789.36] emotional triggers that's not ayurvedic
[1788.16 - 1791.68] um
[1789.36 - 1794.48] kirsten says ayurveda is a good
[1791.68 - 1797.28] philosopher but this is now exactly it's
[1794.48 - 1798.08] this times have changed
[1797.28 - 1800.48] uh
[1798.08 - 1802.64] wylie green says i think wilder green w
[1800.48 - 1804.16] green ayurvedic set me back before
[1802.64 - 1807.20] finding anthony
[1804.16 - 1808.72] i i've heard that over the years
[1807.20 - 1810.32] i have so
[1808.72 - 1812.16] it's important to know the information
[1810.32 - 1814.48] it really is got no disrespect for
[1812.16 - 1817.44] ayurvedic medicine air vetted at all no
[1814.48 - 1819.28] way but i'm just saying divine light
[1817.44 - 1822.16] said something about ayurveda
[1819.28 - 1824.16] ayurveda is evil and i know that from
[1822.16 - 1826.08] experience because i paid thousands to
[1824.16 - 1828.48] study arvetta before finding medical
[1826.08 - 1829.76] medium divine light so glad to have you
[1828.48 - 1831.84] here
[1829.76 - 1833.36] truly
[1831.84 - 1836.24] um
[1833.36 - 1837.76] the whole thing too is is with ayurveda
[1836.24 - 1840.16] some you know
[1837.76 - 1841.84] ayurvedic doctor actually i know as a
[1840.16 - 1844.24] friend of mine who says i'm gonna go do
[1841.84 - 1845.44] a a gee cleanse a geek cleanse i'm like
[1844.24 - 1848.32] uh
[1845.44 - 1850.24] you can't cleanse with that because your
[1848.32 - 1852.80] your gallbladder and your liver are
[1850.24 - 1854.64] going to produce bile to try to break it
[1852.80 - 1855.68] down and it's like what do you mean it's
[1854.64 - 1857.60] like
[1855.68 - 1859.28] you're gonna have to produce a ton of
[1857.60 - 1861.04] bile to break it down so your liver
[1859.28 - 1862.96] won't cleanse because it's in production
[1861.04 - 1865.04] of bile it's like what ayurveda doesn't
[1862.96 - 1866.80] know that i'm like here vetted doesn't
[1865.04 - 1868.64] know a lot of things you know i was
[1866.80 - 1869.84] trying to be nice
[1868.64 - 1871.68] but anyway

[1968.88 - 1974.24] vomited the ghee up
[1972.48 - 1975.84] dr nesbitt the one thing about doctor
[1974.24 - 1976.80] nesbi you need to know that he does
[1975.84 - 1978.16] drink
[1976.80 - 1980.16] then he drinks when he's performing
[1978.16 - 1983.52] surgeries
[1980.16 - 1985.28] dr nesbitt just performed a spleenectomy
[1983.52 - 1986.72] and he said that he only had two shots
[1985.28 - 1989.28] of whiskey before he performed the
[1986.72 - 1991.04] splenectomy
[1989.28 - 1993.04] he had a martini and two shots of
[1991.04 - 1994.32] whiskey and he says he he wants to give
[1993.04 - 1996.16] advice since he's a board-certified
[1994.32 - 1998.24] surgeon psychiatrist he says don't mix
[1996.16 - 2000.80] martinis and whiskey together he says it
[1998.24 - 2003.04] was a bad concoction
[2000.80 - 2004.24] i won't tell him that part what
[2003.04 - 2006.40] i'm not going to tell them what else she
[2004.24 - 2007.60] did no because somebody might need
[2006.40 - 2009.44] surgery
[2007.60 - 2012.00] one day and they might end up because
[2009.44 - 2014.72] their health plan sticks them in your
[2012.00 - 2014.72] way and you
[2015.36 - 2019.12] all right i think i'm going to have to
[2016.80 - 2021.04] put dr nesbitt back dr nesbitt likes
[2019.12 - 2022.24] liver rescue though so i'm just gonna i
[2021.04 - 2024.08] don't know if that's helping right
[2022.24 - 2026.64] helping me right now dr nesbitt if you
[2024.08 - 2028.96] like liver rescue i got it dr nesman has
[2026.64 - 2032.08] to go back into surgery april 10. dr
[2028.96 - 2032.88] nesbit came out
[2032.08 - 2036.56] um
[2032.88 - 2039.76] okay mthfr gene mutation
[2036.56 - 2039.76] okay lose some of you guys
[2041.36 - 2044.08] you know what it is
[2044.16 - 2048.56] humor having a sense of humor
[2046.48 - 2051.44] having some joy in the heart being able
[2048.56 - 2053.92] to laugh a little it's really important
[2051.44 - 2057.84] really important and that's not
[2053.92 - 2060.80] that information that's in humankind for
[2057.84 - 2064.08] centuries and centuries and centuries
[2060.80 - 2066.48] that that's that's in human nature
[2064.08 - 2069.28] that's human design laugh a little you
[2066.48 - 2070.56] got to find some humor it really matters
[2069.28 - 2073.28] so let's go into here we're in
[2070.56 - 2075.36] methylation right now
[2073.28 - 2076.88] methylation is an important topic
[2075.36 - 2078.80] because what you'll find is you'll be
[2076.88 - 2079.76] tricked into the methylation problem
[2078.80 - 2081.04] right
[2079.76 - 2082.16] you'll be told you have this gene
[2081.04 - 2084.40] mutation
[2082.16 - 2086.32] or mthfr gene mutation so that's the
[2084.40 - 2088.64] whole thing with with what's happening
[2086.32 - 2090.16] so you got an mthfr gene mutation that's
[2088.64 - 2091.84] what the blood test shows but there's a
[2090.16 - 2094.64] couple important things to understand
[2091.84 - 2096.32] they don't actually see a gene mutation
[2094.64 - 2097.28] very important to know
[2096.32 - 2100.40] okay
[2097.28 - 2102.72] a gene mutation
[2100.40 - 2104.08] cannot be fixed if you have a mutated
[2102.72 - 2106.16] gene
[2104.08 - 2109.28] it can't be fixed
[2106.16 - 2113.12] so if you have a mutated gene
[2109.28 - 2114.48] it's not fixable it's your genes
[2113.12 - 2116.24] right
[2114.48 - 2119.28] and that's where i scratch my head
[2116.24 - 2121.68] because thousands of people have done
[2119.28 - 2123.20] medical medium information
[2121.68 - 2125.12] and then
[2123.20 - 2127.68] go to their doctors
[2125.12 - 2129.04] and then their doctor says we don't know
[2127.68 - 2131.12] why
[2129.04 - 2133.76] but we think we misdiagnosed you because
[2131.12 - 2136.08] you don't have a gene mutation anymore
[2133.76 - 2139.28] because it's not showing up that you
[2136.08 - 2141.28] have the mthfrg mutation
[2139.28 - 2143.36] and so the patient is like well that
[2141.28 - 2145.28] doesn't make any sense
[2143.36 - 2146.72] if i have this gene mutation the doctor
[2145.28 - 2147.84] says i don't know why that happens
[2146.72 - 2149.60] either
[2147.84 - 2151.20] it doesn't make any sense either so we
[2149.60 - 2152.88] think we diagnosed you so that means
[2151.20 - 2153.84] that your gene mutation test must have
[2152.88 - 2155.20] been
[2153.84 - 2157.28] it must have been
[2155.20 - 2160.56] you know a pro must have been
[2157.28 - 2162.40] false or fake or you know not right so
[2160.56 - 2163.52] what happens is that
[2162.40 - 2166.64] mth
[2163.52 - 2169.20] mthfr gene mutations can always be fixed
[2166.64 - 2171.68] once you clean up the liver
[2169.20 - 2174.00] and know how to heal
[2171.68 - 2175.76] you can get rid of the mthfr gene
[2174.00 - 2178.00] mutation
[2175.76 - 2181.04] okay because it's not genetic that's
[2178.00 - 2182.64] really important to know so
[2181.04 - 2184.64] what i'll give you a rundown too on the
[2182.64 - 2189.28] gene mutation test the gene mutation
[2184.64 - 2191.68] test is an inflammatory marker test
[2189.28 - 2193.68] they should have never named it a gene
[2191.68 - 2195.36] mutation test
[2193.68 - 2197.68] they should have named it
[2195.36 - 2202.00] an inflammatory marker test because just
[2197.68 - 2205.52] like the antinuclear antigen test a a
[2202.00 - 2208.64] just like the c-reactive protein test
[2205.52 - 2210.24] the mthfr gene mutation test is the same
[2208.64 - 2214.48] thing
[2210.24 - 2218.32] it's just an inflammation test it's not
[2214.48 - 2222.80] an actual gene mutation they don't see a
[2218.32 - 2222.80] gene mutation under the microscope
[2223.04 - 2230.72] they see elevated inflammation
[2226.48 - 2235.04] it's a theory that you have a g mutation
[2230.72 - 2237.92] so the mthfr gene mutation theory
[2235.04 - 2237.92] is a theory
[2238.80 - 2241.20] stating
[2240.24 - 2244.56] that
[2241.20 - 2247.92] you have a gene mutation when really you
[2244.56 - 2251.28] just have elevated inflammation
[2247.92 - 2253.04] and they're using an inflammation test
[2251.28 - 2254.84] that they're calling
[2253.04 - 2257.04] a gene mutation
[2254.84 - 2258.40] test and that's what why it's all
[2257.04 - 2259.84] screwed up
[2258.40 - 2262.08] it's rigged
[2259.84 - 2264.08] it's just an inflammation test that's
[2262.08 - 2266.24] why you can reverse it
[2264.08 - 2269.04] you can't reverse
[2266.24 - 2272.24] an actual gene
[2269.04 - 2275.68] that's the way it is your gene
[2272.24 - 2277.04] stays the way it is if that's your gene
[2275.68 - 2279.84] it can't be
[2277.04 - 2281.44] changed it can't be reversed
[2279.84 - 2282.88] okay
[2281.44 - 2285.44] you can't
[2282.88 - 2287.60] sit there like if you don't like your
[2285.44 - 2290.72] nose
[2287.60 - 2290.72] if you don't like your nose
[2291.04 - 2293.84] you can't
[2292.24 - 2295.60] change that
[2293.84 - 2299.76] unless you go unless you do cosmetic
[2295.60 - 2300.96] surgery but you can't change your nose
[2299.76 - 2302.32] okay
[2300.96 - 2305.52] if you have
[2302.32 - 2305.52] a mutated gene
[2305.76 - 2311.76] then you can't change the gene you can't
[2308.32 - 2314.32] change yourself genetically
[2311.76 - 2316.32] it doesn't happen gene mutation test is
[2314.32 - 2318.00] a theory they call it a gene mutation
[2316.32 - 2319.92] test when it's really an inflammatory
[2318.00 - 2322.00] marker just like c-reactive protein or a
[2319.92 - 2324.40] a anti-nuclear antigen test
[2322.00 - 2328.24] that's why when people do medical medium
[2324.40 - 2330.24] they get rid of their mthfr g mutation
[2328.24 - 2332.24] they get rid of it too many thousands
[2330.24 - 2333.60] and tens of thousands millions of liver
[2332.24 - 2335.12] rescues
[2333.60 - 2336.72] sold around the world
[2335.12 - 2338.84] in almost every country in the on the
[2336.72 - 2342.48] planet just so you know
[2338.84 - 2344.72] doctors steal liver rescue information
[2342.48 - 2346.96] and then run ads on all the social media
[2344.72 - 2349.60] channels selling their products taking
[2346.96 - 2352.16] out the information in here and using it
[2349.60 - 2354.00] for themselves without citing it
[2352.16 - 2355.52] this is one of the most popular books in
[2354.00 - 2358.32] the world
[2355.52 - 2360.80] it's saved countless lives
[2358.32 - 2363.60] and an overburdened sluggish liver with
[2360.80 - 2366.08] a low gra low-grade infection like
[2363.60 - 2367.68] epstein-barr or shingles
[2366.08 - 2370.08] a sluggish stagnant liver with a
[2367.68 - 2371.20] low-grade infection like epstein-barr
[2370.08 - 2372.00] shingles
[2371.20 - 2373.84] okay
[2372.00 - 2376.48] is the real cause
[2373.84 - 2379.52] of inflammation markers ringing off both
[2376.48 - 2381.68] a a c-reactive protein mthfr gene
[2379.52 - 2384.00] mutation and neurological and
[2381.68 - 2386.56] neurological line
[2384.00 - 2388.96] and neurological line
[2386.56 - 2391.12] really important enough
[2388.96 - 2391.12] so
[2391.36 - 2395.36] so it's critical to understand so when
[2393.52 - 2397.28] you go to your doctor do what your
[2395.36 - 2398.48] doctor says okay i'm just telling you
[2397.28 - 2400.80] you can bring this information to your
[2398.48 - 2403.28] doctor you go to your doctor and he
[2400.80 - 2405.20] tells you you have a gene mutation
[2403.28 - 2407.44] really you don't he just did an
[2405.20 - 2408.96] inflammation test now you think your
[2407.44 - 2411.04] genes are screwed up so now you think
[2408.96 - 2412.80] you just have bad genes now you think
[2411.04 - 2414.56] your son's jeans are messed up you think
[2412.80 - 2416.08] your daughter's jeans are messed up you
[2414.56 - 2418.88] think your family's got some gene
[2416.08 - 2420.96] problem and you were just duped you were
[2418.88 - 2423.20] just duped the wolves pulled over your
[2420.96 - 2425.52] eyes you were tricked
[2423.20 - 2427.36] is what happened tammy says tammy winter
[2425.52 - 2429.12] says great information
[2427.36 - 2430.80] wow great
[2429.12 - 2431.84] so what happens is you guys the reason
[2430.80 - 2433.68] why
[2431.84 - 2436.08] countless people around the planet got
[2433.68 - 2437.60] rid of their gene mutation
[2436.08 - 2438.96] just like somebody already commented
[2437.60 - 2440.00] right they got rid of their gene
[2438.96 - 2440.88] mutation
[2440.00 - 2443.12] because
[2440.88 - 2445.44] they didn't have a gene mutation
[2443.12 - 2448.08] they had a dirty liver with a low-grade
[2445.44 - 2449.68] viral infection and they cleaned it up
[2448.08 - 2452.00] using medical medium information and
[2449.68 - 2454.24] tools and they went back to their doctor
[2452.00 - 2456.56] and suddenly their gene mutation was
[2454.24 - 2456.56] gone
[2457.44 - 2461.36] all of our genes haven't gone bad in
[2459.44 - 2463.12] just the last 20 years
[2461.36 - 2464.88] 15 20 years
[2463.12 - 2466.56] for some reason medical research and
[2464.88 - 2468.56] science believes that all of her genes
[2466.56 - 2470.64] just went bad
[2468.56 - 2472.96] and teaching doctors that
[2470.64 - 2475.36] all of her genes went bad
[2472.96 - 2477.60] chronic illness is exploding like never
[2475.36 - 2481.04] before all around the planet all around
[2477.60 - 2483.92] the world exploding everywhere
[2481.04 - 2485.76] and her genes didn't go bad in two years
[2483.92 - 2489.36] and five years
[2485.76 - 2491.20] all over jeans just didn't go bad
[2489.36 - 2492.80] okay so what they do is they tell you
[2491.20 - 2494.40] you have gene problems to take your eyes
[2492.80 - 2496.16] off the ball so it's like take your eyes
[2494.40 - 2498.32] off the ball don't know that it's your
[2496.16 - 2500.00] liver just say it's a gene problem don't
[2498.32 - 2502.56] know that your brain is filled with all
[2500.00 - 2504.88] this crap no it's a gene problem they
[2502.56 - 2507.20] don't tell you how to fix it no because
[2504.88 - 2509.36] nobody knows they don't tell you any of
[2507.20 - 2510.48] that because the system's not built to
[2509.36 - 2512.80] care
[2510.48 - 2514.96] about anybody they're built to break it
[2512.80 - 2516.88] down the system's set up to break down
[2514.96 - 2518.32] and destroy and hurt and harm people
[2516.88 - 2519.60] that's what it is it's just that's
[2518.32 - 2522.00] reality
[2519.60 - 2523.28] that's just reality
[2522.00 - 2525.44] yeah
[2523.28 - 2528.48] me too 787 good to see you usually you
[2525.44 - 2530.56] leave comments on on youtube right
[2528.48 - 2533.12] yeah it's exactly what you just said is
[2530.56 - 2534.96] spot on
[2533.12 - 2536.72] so anyway you guys so we talked about
[2534.96 - 2538.96] live rescue for a little bit i made some
[2536.72 - 2541.12] pasta i already ate some so i ate a
[2538.96 - 2543.12] whole bunch before i came on here
[2541.12 - 2544.64] but i made some pasta on the amazon live
[2543.12 - 2545.92] make sure you subscribe to the amazon
[2544.64 - 2547.28] live because that's where i'm cooking
[2545.92 - 2548.96] that's where i'm cooking and doing the
[2547.28 - 2550.88] cooking tips and everything and showing
[2548.96 - 2552.80] you things that i like and all that the
[2550.88 - 2555.04] link is in the description make sure you
[2552.80 - 2557.04] uh subscribe for that give me a thumbs
[2555.04 - 2559.36] up if you like the video by the way you
[2557.04 - 2560.80] guys on youtube okay
[2559.36 - 2562.64] and the link is in the description on
[2560.80 - 2563.68] tick tock on tick tock the link is in
[2562.64 - 2565.20] the bio
[2563.68 - 2566.96] you guys on youtube link is in the
[2565.20 - 2568.48] description facebook link is in the
[2566.96 - 2571.20] description right
[2568.48 - 2574.08] okay dr fine md autoimmune theory and
[2571.20 - 2575.60] gene theory is a mass duping of the
[2574.08 - 2578.40] populous
[2575.60 - 2579.44] we've cracked the human genome for years
[2578.40 - 2581.92] now
[2579.44 - 2583.76] what has that brought on
[2581.92 - 2586.08] what has that brought on other than
[2583.76 - 2588.08] money for a new industry it's so true
[2586.08 - 2589.28] etc they haven't fixed anybody because
[2588.08 - 2590.96] of that
[2589.28 - 2593.68] they've been playing with genes for
[2590.96 - 2595.44] decades and decades now right for 50 60
[2593.68 - 2597.04] 70 years they've been playing they
[2595.44 - 2598.40] started playing with jeans right around
[2597.04 - 2600.32] world war ii
[2598.40 - 2602.32] right before in the 30s in the late 30s
[2600.32 - 2603.44] they started playing with jeans
[2602.32 - 2606.00] and they
[2603.44 - 2607.52] nothing came from it besides billions
[2606.00 - 2609.44] and trillions of dollars going up
[2607.52 - 2610.96] throughout the decades trillions of
[2609.44 - 2612.64] dollars throughout the decades getting
[2610.96 - 2613.76] funneled into it
[2612.64 - 2615.36] and
[2613.76 - 2617.12] they still don't have one answer to why
[2615.36 - 2618.64] you have a heart palpitation
[2617.12 - 2620.96] that's unexplainable they don't have an
[2618.64 - 2623.76] answer to why anything lizzie liu says
[2620.96 - 2626.16] i've had the same experience with mthfr
[2623.76 - 2628.24] i didn't have it before and then got
[2626.16 - 2630.80] sick and now testing positive for due to
[2628.24 - 2632.80] two different types of ftmtf that's
[2630.80 - 2634.32] mthfr gene mutation i got to tell you
[2632.80 - 2635.60] one thing about that this is really
[2634.32 - 2636.80] interesting
[2635.60 - 2639.12] and
[2636.80 - 2641.12] so here's how it goes you don't have a
[2639.12 - 2643.60] gene mutation before
[2641.12 - 2648.88] you get sick and then they diagnose you
[2643.60 - 2652.56] with two varieties of mthfrg mutation
[2648.88 - 2655.12] two varieties of mthfrg mutation
[2652.56 - 2657.84] that's unbelievable and
[2655.12 - 2659.28] it's it's so fraudulent i mean listen to
[2657.84 - 2661.76] your doctor do your doctor tells you but
[2659.28 - 2663.28] it's so fraudulent how the system is
[2661.76 - 2665.12] when you think about it
[2663.28 - 2667.12] you don't have a gene mutation in the
[2665.12 - 2669.44] past but now all of a sudden you've got
[2667.12 - 2672.00] one when you get sick
[2669.44 - 2674.08] really it's because it was just an
[2672.00 - 2677.84] inflammation marker detecting
[2674.08 - 2679.60] inflammation not a gene mutation
[2677.84 - 2681.68] and that inflammation
[2679.60 - 2684.56] has a lot to do with the liver i'm going
[2681.68 - 2686.24] to ig so i'm heading off to instagram in
