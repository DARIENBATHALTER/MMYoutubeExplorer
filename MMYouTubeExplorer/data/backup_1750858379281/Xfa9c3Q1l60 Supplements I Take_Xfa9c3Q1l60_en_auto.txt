[96.32 - 99.76] you know and all that so let me get
[97.92 - 102.16] started so
[99.76 - 102.80] in the morning the first thing i do is
[102.16 - 105.92] obviously

[113.04 - 116.88] healing tool flush the liver
[115.12 - 118.56] but i do this before i take any
[116.88 - 120.64] supplements you know so i
[118.56 - 122.96] squeeze a little lemon in a glass of
[120.64 - 124.56] water 16 to 32 ounces
[122.96 - 125.92] that's the first thing i do you guys

[125.92 - 128.00] mono cleanse talked about that medical
[127.68 - 131.68] medium

[147.84 - 151.28] really strong bruise of tea so i'm going
[149.20 - 153.60] to do that in a moment
[151.28 - 154.56] yeah that that we're going to talk about
[153.60 - 155.84] and

[168.96 - 172.08] so i got some hot water that i just
[171.04 - 173.76] brewed right
[172.08 - 176.24] you guys are you guys doing tea every
[173.76 - 176.24] day at all
[179.92 - 184.24] so what brands will begin with with the

[184.24 - 189.44] i'm talking about traditional medicinal
[187.04 - 190.96] okay i'm gonna be talking about vimergy
[189.44 - 192.80] that's the brand right here of
[190.96 - 194.88] supplements that i
[192.80 - 196.16] admire the most because of the quality
[194.88 - 197.52] and all kinds of other reasons and i'll
[196.16 - 198.88] talk about that so i'm going to show you
[197.52 - 200.56] that too
[198.88 - 202.88] i got the weinman's wild blueberry juice
[200.56 - 204.88] it's something i do every single day
[202.88 - 205.92] i'm not sponsored by traditional
[204.88 - 208.56] medicinals
[205.92 - 210.40] just a little forewarning there not
[208.56 - 212.96] sponsored by these guys
[210.40 - 213.52] i'm not sponsored by vimergy this is
[212.96 - 217.04] stuff
[213.52 - 218.80] i do every single day okay i am working
[217.04 - 220.32] with wyman's to make sure this stuff
[218.80 - 221.36] gets out there in the world because it's
[220.32 - 222.80] incredible right
[221.36 - 225.52] all these different reasons i've talked
[222.80 - 227.60] about that before but
[225.52 - 229.28] so as far as the t's go i make a really
[227.60 - 231.92] really strong brew and i'll do
[229.28 - 233.44] i'll do multiple teas in a day okay so
[231.92 - 235.92] that's something i'll do
[233.44 - 237.20] so i'll get a really strong hibiscus
[235.92 - 239.60] rose hip in the morning
[237.20 - 241.20] what i like about the rose hips is it's
[239.60 - 242.80] great for the immune system
[241.20 - 245.20] and right now we have to keep our immune
[242.80 - 247.12] system strong so what you'll find
[245.20 - 249.68] in here is a lot of powerful immune
[247.12 - 250.80] system builders and boosters right and
[249.68 - 253.52] i'm going to be doing
[250.80 - 255.04] multiple lives on this topic right here
[253.52 - 256.24] not just what i take in a day but i'm
[255.04 - 257.92] going to do it a million
[256.24 - 260.24] immune system builder one i'm going to
[257.92 - 263.28] do a baseline supplement one two
[260.24 - 266.96] so i'm dropping some tea bags in here
[263.28 - 270.40] so there's one right there and
[266.96 - 274.00] there's two right
[270.40 - 276.64] okay and then three
[274.00 - 278.40] right so i'm doing three rows hip with
[276.64 - 280.88] hibiscus
[278.40 - 282.48] so i usually do this sometime in the
[280.88 - 284.56] morning you know you can
[282.48 - 285.84] i don't know what you guys you know if
[284.56 - 287.36] you do any teas in the morning but
[285.84 - 291.12] that's one right there
[287.36 - 291.12] i'll drop some honey in there too
[291.92 - 299.52] yeah that's hot water
[295.76 - 299.52] so i'm gonna drop some honey right there
[299.84 - 304.00] so that's that's one of
[305.12 - 311.12] now i do a lot of tea just so you guys
[307.52 - 312.64] know a lot of tea which you won't see me
[311.12 - 314.48] doing is green tea
[312.64 - 316.16] you won't see me trying to destroy my
[314.48 - 318.08] adrenal glands
[316.16 - 319.28] and what you guys are going to be doing
[318.08 - 320.40] what's going to happen out there is you
[319.28 - 322.00] guys are going to be
[320.40 - 323.92] they're going to try to brainwash you
[322.00 - 325.36] guys they're going to try to brainwash
[323.92 - 327.12] you to have your green tea
[325.36 - 329.20] to make sure that every woman's on green
[327.12 - 330.72] tea or matcha tea or some kind of coffee
[329.20 - 332.00] and i talk about that being bad right
[330.72 - 335.84] and all that stuff
[332.00 - 338.32] but it do you see me drinking green tea
[335.84 - 340.24] do you see me drinking matcha tea right
[338.32 - 342.88] do you see me drinking coffee you don't
[340.24 - 345.36] see that there's a reason because
[342.88 - 348.16] green tea matcha tea coffee those are
[345.36 - 349.04] adrenal destroyers for women especially
[348.16 - 350.72] for women
[349.04 - 352.08] good to see you guys healthy liz good to
[350.72 - 356.36] see you
[352.08 - 358.80] so those are adrenal destroyers
[356.36 - 360.48] annihilators so it's funny how the
[358.80 - 362.08] industry the health industry works okay
[360.48 - 363.44] it's one thing the caffeine industry is
[362.08 - 366.48] one thing right
[363.44 - 369.12] but it's not just that it's the
[366.48 - 371.04] alternative medicine industry and the
[369.12 - 371.52] alternative medicine medicine industry
[371.04 - 375.28] is
[371.52 - 377.44] is such a game like a tricky
[375.28 - 380.24] game and it's a game to really hurt
[377.44 - 383.04] women more than people know and men too
[380.24 - 383.92] so they'll just push all that caffeine
[383.04 - 386.00] into women
[383.92 - 387.52] and they'll age them quick now i don't
[386.00 - 388.64] know why alternative medicine loves to
[387.52 - 391.04] do that but they do
[388.64 - 391.68] and it's all paid for stuff it's all
[391.04 - 393.60] paid for
[391.68 - 396.00] stuff just you know so there's that game
[393.60 - 399.28] so which which you won't see
[396.00 - 403.44] in my morning or my day is you won't see
[399.28 - 405.28] teas that are you know that are
[403.44 - 406.80] caffeinated because you don't want that
[405.28 - 409.60] you definitely don't want that that's
[406.80 - 410.96] important to know
[409.60 - 413.44] so i'm going to do another tea right
[410.96 - 414.16] here okay i'm going to get this hop
[413.44 - 418.56] right here
[414.16 - 418.56] hotter so
[420.24 - 424.32] and that's so good right there i'm gonna
[422.08 - 426.56] do another tea
[424.32 - 428.16] so i drink multiple teas in a day one of
[426.56 - 431.04] the teas i drink a lot of is red
[428.16 - 431.04] raspberry leaf
[431.12 - 438.40] okay and i'll do the same thing i'll do
[433.44 - 438.40] three tea bags right there
[439.84 - 445.52] and this is a great way to get
[443.04 - 447.28] minerals trace minerals in you guys this
[445.52 - 448.48] is herbal medicine so i'm all about
[447.28 - 450.40] herbal medicine
[448.48 - 451.84] but i'm not about stupid herbal medicine
[450.40 - 452.96] there's a difference and i'll go into
[451.84 - 455.84] what that means
[452.96 - 456.64] uma do you do you do tea after celery
[455.84 - 460.40] juice sure
[456.64 - 464.88] yeah 15 to 30 minutes later absolutely
[460.40 - 466.40] i definitely do
[464.88 - 468.80] so i'm going to do another cup of tea
[466.40 - 468.80] right here
[470.80 - 474.72] using herbal medicine properly is how
[473.84 - 477.04] you heal
[474.72 - 478.80] just so you know using herbal medicine
[477.04 - 479.28] properly is how you heal and i'm going
[478.80 - 480.56] to cover
[479.28 - 481.92] a whole bunch of different things that i
[480.56 - 482.88] take i got all the supplements here
[481.92 - 484.80] right here
[482.88 - 486.16] all the different stuff that i do every
[484.80 - 489.52] single day
[486.16 - 491.92] i take lysine every day jody k
[489.52 - 494.48] can you overdo it with supplements i
[491.92 - 497.60] heard too many can affect the liver
[494.48 - 499.76] too many useless supplements
[497.60 - 501.28] too many supplements that aren't good
[499.76 - 502.64] for people to take
[501.28 - 504.80] there's a big difference like
[502.64 - 508.00] supplements and then there's crap
[504.80 - 511.52] or supplements and trendy garbage or
[508.00 - 513.04] supplements and um
[511.52 - 514.56] junk so let's give you a couple of a
[513.04 - 516.32] couple of things fish oil
[514.56 - 518.00] yeah you can overdo it any of it's
[516.32 - 518.48] overdue because it's terrible for you
[518.00 - 519.84] right
[518.48 - 521.52] so if you're like well i'm taking my
[519.84 - 523.76] supplements i'm doing my fish oil well
[521.52 - 526.16] that's that's that's a disaster
[523.76 - 527.68] because of of the mercury that's in fish
[526.16 - 529.28] oil and i don't care what anybody says
[527.68 - 531.60] there's mercury and fish oil in fact
[529.28 - 533.04] it's even worse than what people believe
[531.60 - 534.72] because they try to remove mercury
[533.04 - 536.48] artificial and then it makes it worse
[534.72 - 538.00] because you have the homeopathic version
[536.48 - 539.20] of mercury inside fish oil which goes
[538.00 - 542.32] straight to the brain
[539.20 - 544.16] straight to the brain stem okay so
[542.32 - 546.80] so that's just an example right there
[544.16 - 548.48] like sodium bicarbonate bentonite clay
[546.80 - 550.72] apple cider vinegar gummies like all
[548.48 - 553.60] this is garbage colostrum
[550.72 - 554.96] collagen right zeolite all of this is
[553.60 - 557.20] garbage and so
[554.96 - 558.48] yeah you can overdo it when you do
[557.20 - 559.60] zeolite because you like you're not
[558.48 - 560.88] supposed to be doing
[559.60 - 562.00] you can overdo it when you do whey
[560.88 - 563.12] protein powder because you're not
[562.00 - 565.20] supposed to be doing it
[563.12 - 566.56] you can overdo bentonite clay because
[565.20 - 568.72] you're not supposed to be doing it you
[566.56 - 570.16] can overdo humic and fulvic acid
[568.72 - 573.12] because you're not supposed to be doing
[570.16 - 575.84] it because this stuff isn't good for you
[573.12 - 576.72] and that's the scam of the alternative
[575.84 - 578.64] industry too
[576.72 - 579.84] it's all they have to give you so much
[578.64 - 582.00] to choose from
[579.84 - 582.88] that you shouldn't be doing because it's
[582.00 - 585.28] it's garbage
[582.88 - 587.20] if your doctor wants you on it be on it
[585.28 - 588.80] okay but i wouldn't go on it i wouldn't
[587.20 - 590.24] put family and friends on it i wouldn't
[588.80 - 591.36] put any of the people that have reached
[590.24 - 593.68] out to me throughout the
[591.36 - 596.40] throughout my life you know i wouldn't i
[593.68 - 598.24] wouldn't put anybody on that so
[596.40 - 601.52] so i'm doing red raspberry leaf right
[598.24 - 605.12] here i'm doing there's herbal medicine
[601.52 - 607.68] and then there's herbal medicine
[605.12 - 608.32] that's not smart there's lots of that
[607.68 - 611.20] out there
[608.32 - 611.20] keep that in mind
[611.68 - 616.08] hi anthony astrid says i've healed my
[614.00 - 616.64] migraines that i've had for more than 30
[616.08 - 618.24] years
[616.64 - 619.76] i am so grateful for your information
[618.24 - 622.56] and your help so astrid
[619.76 - 624.16] you're seasoned you know what's going on
[622.56 - 625.36] out there with products and everything
[624.16 - 626.80] else so you're obviously doing the
[625.36 - 627.76] medical medium tools you healed your
[626.80 - 629.76] migraines
[627.76 - 631.44] and the not so sick people they play
[629.76 - 633.04] around in the land of
[631.44 - 634.24] supplements that aren't good for you and
[633.04 - 635.68] they can do that when they're not so
[634.24 - 637.36] sick when you only have a headache but
[635.68 - 639.28] not severe migraines
[637.36 - 641.04] you can play around with all the
[639.28 - 644.72] different thinking out there and all the
[641.04 - 644.72] different bad supplements out there
[644.84 - 649.20] so question on tick tock
[647.28 - 650.40] i think it's a question can you mix the
[649.20 - 652.88] teas you can
[650.40 - 654.24] you can't i don't mix them but you can
[652.88 - 656.80] so what kind of tea is that
[654.24 - 658.08] okay so that's red raspberry right here
[656.80 - 659.52] is what i was just doing
[658.08 - 661.76] red raspberry leaf from traditional
[659.52 - 665.52] medicinals okay
[661.76 - 667.28] and that's the rose hip one medical
[665.52 - 668.72] medium directory medical medium
[667.28 - 670.48] dot com you can find on directory so
[668.72 - 672.64] let's talk about other stuff i do so i'm
[670.48 - 675.44] just showing you some teas

[767.12 - 770.40] powerful no fillers no garbage no
[769.68 - 772.32] nothing
[770.40 - 773.84] and i and and that's the thing it's like
[772.32 - 775.92] that matters to me
[773.84 - 777.20] but also really potent at the same time
[775.92 - 780.24] as gentle so
[777.20 - 781.76] the lemon balm is an incredible healing
[780.24 - 783.84] tool for so many people
[781.76 - 785.84] no citric acid no natural flavors no
[783.84 - 787.28] alcohol it's it's really incredible so
[785.84 - 790.88] let's go into this a little bit
[787.28 - 790.88] how much do i take right
[791.60 - 796.40] so it's just moving this around a little
[795.04 - 801.84] bit so you guys can see
[796.40 - 801.84] okay so how much do i take
[801.92 - 807.84] try not to let disaster happen over here
[804.56 - 807.84] like spilling everything
[808.00 - 812.32] so that's one dropper full right there
[810.64 - 814.64] maybe somebody you're just taking one
[812.32 - 818.32] dropper full maybe somebody that takes
[814.64 - 821.76] a one drop one drop
[818.32 - 823.92] right and but this is what i do so i'll
[821.76 - 823.92] put
[824.96 - 828.08] two dropper fulls two full dropper fulls
[827.04 - 830.40] right
[828.08 - 830.40] three
[831.20 - 833.44] four
[834.32 - 836.64] five
[838.32 - 844.32] six so i take six full dropper holes of
[841.92 - 846.24] lemon balm right there
[844.32 - 850.08] put them in a shot glass that's what i
[846.24 - 850.08] do that's my shot glass right there
[850.64 - 853.68] and i add a little water
[853.84 - 858.08] huh put a little bit of water in there
[858.96 - 865.12] so i just made a lemon balm
[862.00 - 866.32] shot that's what it did it's a lemon
[865.12 - 871.28] balm
[866.32 - 871.84] now this is a tool used correctly right
[871.28 - 874.56] here
[871.84 - 875.28] it's the right kind of lemon balm right
[874.56 - 877.04] kind of lemon
[875.28 - 878.96] lemon balm product and already that's a
[877.04 - 881.20] win-win because what people don't
[878.96 - 882.88] understand is you get a lemon balm out
[881.20 - 884.72] there that's an alcohol with natural
[882.88 - 885.52] flavors or anything you get a lemon balm
[884.72 - 887.92] that's
[885.52 - 889.12] not not it's got fillers in it or it's
[887.92 - 892.48] just a weak
[889.12 - 894.32] weak version you know nasa says zeolite
[892.48 - 895.60] is garbage i read that it is okay in
[894.32 - 896.88] your book medical medium i'm glad you
[895.60 - 898.16] asked that i'm going to cover that too
[896.88 - 902.24] why that was there
[898.16 - 905.04] because just like i will i will drop
[902.24 - 907.12] anything that i think changes if a
[905.04 - 909.68] product is changing
[907.12 - 911.36] they're dead to me that's it and there
[909.68 - 913.04] hasn't been a zeolite out not even to
[911.36 - 914.40] this day i know everybody screams the
[913.04 - 916.96] light and all the stuff
[914.40 - 918.00] they're not good okay in my opinion
[916.96 - 921.52] they're not good
[918.00 - 924.32] and they dehydrate they remove
[921.52 - 925.20] important trace minerals there was a
[924.32 - 927.28] zeolite
[925.20 - 929.20] that was okay enough at the time when
[927.28 - 932.40] dulce wasn't present
[929.20 - 934.08] right but it's it's not okay enough
[932.40 - 935.92] and what people do is they do large
[934.08 - 938.16] dosages of zeolite the whole thing and
[935.92 - 941.44] they're using the wrong zeolites
[938.16 - 943.12] and and um so yeah so
[941.44 - 944.72] the only reason why i offered zeolite at
[943.12 - 946.88] one point there was a certain variety of
[944.72 - 950.64] zeolite out at the time
[946.88 - 953.20] and small dosages it would help get
[950.64 - 954.96] some debris out of the intestinal tract
[953.20 - 956.72] but it can't cross the barrier of
[954.96 - 957.68] intestinal tract it can't go into the
[956.72 - 959.76] bloodstream
[957.68 - 961.20] it can't very easily it can't go into
[959.76 - 963.28] places you need to go in
[961.20 - 964.80] and the z lights today are not the right
[963.28 - 967.20] kind so i just want to just
[964.80 - 968.08] make that clear and how that works so
[967.20 - 970.64] but what you'll find
[968.08 - 972.24] is the heavy metal detox smoothie which
[970.64 - 974.16] is the spirulina
[972.24 - 976.00] and the barley grass juice powder right
[974.16 - 977.84] heavy metal detox movie
[976.00 - 979.92] that's helping people heal around the
[977.84 - 982.08] world people are trying to
[979.92 - 983.20] hop on that boat that bandwagon so
[982.08 - 985.12] they'll say hey
[983.20 - 986.64] do the z light 2 with your heavy metal
[985.12 - 988.56] detox smoothie
[986.64 - 990.08] and then they try to take credit for
[988.56 - 991.44] what the medical medium heavy metal
[990.08 - 993.04] detox smoothie does
[991.44 - 995.60] zeolite in the last 20 years hasn't done
[993.04 - 998.08] anything for anybody somebody has lupus
[995.60 - 1000.24] or ra or hashimoto's they
[998.08 - 1001.84] keeps with their ra their hashimoto's
[1000.24 - 1003.12] their neurological line they keep with
[1001.84 - 1003.92] their lupus they keep with their
[1003.12 - 1006.08] conditions
[1003.92 - 1008.32] zeolite doesn't change that same thing
[1006.08 - 1011.04] with like humic acid fulfilling acid
[1008.32 - 1011.60] it dehydrates the body it doesn't give
[1011.04 - 1014.08] back
[1011.60 - 1014.96] it takes and it doesn't get people out
[1014.08 - 1016.72] of sickness
[1014.96 - 1018.56] medical medium info is about getting
[1016.72 - 1021.68] people out of sickness
[1018.56 - 1024.88] disease illness struggles
[1021.68 - 1026.16] symptoms and doing it right so
[1024.88 - 1028.08] you know there's people out there the
[1026.16 - 1030.40] user of all medicine they use it wrong
[1028.08 - 1032.24] so i'm showing a great way of how to use
[1030.40 - 1033.44] it can ask your doctor what's right for
[1032.24 - 1035.04] you but this is how i use it for my
[1033.44 - 1038.48] friends and family so this is a
[1035.04 - 1041.76] lemon bomb okay shot right there
[1038.48 - 1041.76] and i take this every day
[1044.80 - 1049.60] if you're watching this on youtube give
[1046.80 - 1052.16] me a thumbs up if you want
[1049.60 - 1054.88] so that's a lemon balm shot now i take
[1052.16 - 1056.96] those throughout the day
[1054.88 - 1058.08] kathy hill will the lemon balm tea be
[1056.96 - 1060.40] just as good
[1058.08 - 1061.12] as the tincture it's not as good as the
[1060.40 - 1063.52] tincture
[1061.12 - 1065.20] but i like the lemon balm tea and i like
[1063.52 - 1067.36] traditional medicinals lemon balm tea
[1065.20 - 1070.48] that's the peppermint right there
[1067.36 - 1072.72] but it's not as good as
[1070.48 - 1074.88] the tincture but it's still helpful so
[1072.72 - 1076.24] if you have the lemon balm tea drink it
[1074.88 - 1080.00] drink it drink it if you like that
[1076.24 - 1083.20] that's fine but this is more of
[1080.00 - 1083.60] heading to that that extra medicinal
[1083.20 - 1086.64] that
[1083.60 - 1087.92] powerful level of a healing tool
[1086.64 - 1090.16] so that's why i do it with the tincture
[1087.92 - 1091.60] takes it to that whole another thing
[1090.16 - 1093.36] so that's what i do with the lemon balm
[1091.60 - 1094.88] i do that every day so the thing is the
[1093.36 - 1095.44] question is i've never showed you guys
[1094.88 - 1097.68] this
[1095.44 - 1099.44] i never have yet of like how i do
[1097.68 - 1101.68] something for myself

[1337.04 - 1339.84] that's all because you might say wait a
[1338.96 - 1342.40] minute wait a minute
[1339.84 - 1343.52] do i have to take all these supplements
[1342.40 - 1345.44] what i have to do
[1343.52 - 1346.64] six dropper fulls of this what that's
[1345.44 - 1348.56] not what this is
[1346.64 - 1349.92] i'm actually just saying you guys i want
[1348.56 - 1352.00] you to have a window
[1349.92 - 1353.68] into what i'm doing in my life i want
[1352.00 - 1355.04] you to have a window into how i'm taking
[1353.68 - 1358.08] my supplements
[1355.04 - 1359.28] and this is the window right here so i
[1358.08 - 1364.08] do
[1359.28 - 1367.92] four of these a day six dropper fulls
[1364.08 - 1369.44] in some water is what i do
[1367.92 - 1371.76] you may be somebody that takes one
[1369.44 - 1372.88] dropper full it's amazing just one
[1371.76 - 1374.72] dropper full
[1372.88 - 1376.24] much light and love energy has always
[1374.72 - 1378.08] been good to me
[1376.24 - 1379.60] they listen to you they really do that's
[1378.08 - 1381.12] what i love about them they care about
[1379.60 - 1382.72] you and they run
[1381.12 - 1386.00] heavy metal testing on all their
[1382.72 - 1389.04] supplements they do by an independent
[1386.00 - 1391.68] independent testing
[1389.04 - 1395.04] organization not one that's not
[1391.68 - 1398.16] independent which all the others do
[1395.04 - 1399.44] that says everything right there linda
[1398.16 - 1401.36] says can you say
[1399.44 - 1403.20] something about vitamin b12 how much and
[1401.36 - 1404.40] how long to take i'll go to b12 next of
[1403.20 - 1406.96] what i do
[1404.40 - 1408.40] that's the vimergy b12 i'll talk about
[1406.96 - 1410.64] why i take it
[1408.40 - 1412.64] okay all of that so let's head there let
[1410.64 - 1416.08] me get the shot glass out
[1412.64 - 1417.52] now b12 i take orally a lot of times i
[1416.08 - 1419.20] just put it directly in my mouth but i
[1417.52 - 1421.12] also do the shot glass too
[1419.20 - 1423.04] so go into that a little bit i want to
[1421.12 - 1425.28] mention something though
[1423.04 - 1427.20] about uh vimorji being good to you okay
[1425.28 - 1429.04] because i know you said that right
[1427.20 - 1431.44] and they've always been so good to you i
[1429.04 - 1433.84] want to tell you how i even
[1431.44 - 1436.24] like went into this whole thing of why
[1433.84 - 1438.88] this is my one of my favorites okay
[1436.24 - 1439.28] because the quality is is far surpass
[1438.88 - 1441.44] any
[1439.28 - 1443.20] spirulina so this is spirulina the
[1441.44 - 1446.56] reason why i mention this is because
[1443.20 - 1450.00] i used to i used to be supportive
[1446.56 - 1451.76] of pacifica spirulina right so west
[1450.00 - 1454.32] coast spirulina
[1451.76 - 1455.92] and a couple of things went wrong there
[1454.32 - 1459.04] all right
[1455.92 - 1459.52] one of the west coast companies they i
[1459.04 - 1463.04] found
[1459.52 - 1465.44] something in their bottle and
[1463.04 - 1467.12] i never spoke about this before but i
[1465.44 - 1469.60] found something in their bottle
[1467.12 - 1471.04] it was a little piece of plastic that
[1469.60 - 1474.48] was this big
[1471.04 - 1477.68] like a little tiny thin square
[1474.48 - 1481.12] that was the color of
[1477.68 - 1482.64] the spirulina i could have accidentally
[1481.12 - 1484.48] swallowed it
[1482.64 - 1486.24] and i and and because of spirit of
[1484.48 - 1487.92] compassion i didn't
[1486.24 - 1489.68] i never told you about this story it's a
[1487.92 - 1490.32] private story it's like only my family
[1489.68 - 1492.08] knows this
[1490.32 - 1493.84] a couple of my friends i told the story
[1492.08 - 1496.72] right and
[1493.84 - 1498.40] so like i went to the bottle with the
[1496.72 - 1501.44] spoon
[1498.40 - 1504.56] and it was so thin and small by far
[1501.44 - 1508.00] anybody else would have swallowed that
[1504.56 - 1509.84] and i i was really upset so i was like
[1508.00 - 1511.20] well what do i do
[1509.84 - 1513.60] it looked like it could have been maybe
[1511.20 - 1514.08] one of the fresheners that are inside
[1513.60 - 1516.48] these things
[1514.08 - 1517.28] but something was wrong this was so
[1516.48 - 1520.80] easily
[1517.28 - 1522.88] a problem and so i called the company
[1520.80 - 1524.08] told them who i was on the medical
[1522.88 - 1526.56] medium
[1524.08 - 1529.68] you know i left a message on on your on
[1526.56 - 1532.72] your you know at your company before
[1529.68 - 1536.16] and i promote your products your pacifi
[1532.72 - 1537.28] pacific spirulina i have thousands of
[1536.16 - 1539.36] people
[1537.28 - 1541.12] out there that you know come to me for
[1539.36 - 1543.04] help you know all these things over the
[1541.12 - 1545.84] years thousands of thousands of people
[1543.04 - 1547.52] and i i like a good product so i know i
[1545.84 - 1550.48] can help people right
[1547.52 - 1551.60] and you know i've left messages before
[1550.48 - 1552.96] and they've ignored me
[1551.60 - 1554.80] and it's the first sign when the
[1552.96 - 1556.08] companies ignore me right
[1554.80 - 1558.64] and then when i found this piece of
[1556.08 - 1561.28] plastic this piece of
[1558.64 - 1562.00] this dangerous thing in there i reached
[1561.28 - 1563.68] out to them
[1562.00 - 1566.00] it's like give me a call back i found
[1563.68 - 1569.28] this in this and this they never did
[1566.00 - 1572.64] and i was like that's it done
[1569.28 - 1575.60] no recommendations for me it's over
[1572.64 - 1577.36] you know strike two and then the oceans
[1575.60 - 1579.44] got more polluted recently just in the
[1577.36 - 1582.40] last few years the last three years
[1579.44 - 1583.60] the west coast water is so polluted sea
[1582.40 - 1586.08] life is actually
[1583.60 - 1587.36] being forced to come closer to the shore
[1586.08 - 1588.56] and that's why so many people are with
[1587.36 - 1590.00] their videos and their cameras like oh
[1588.56 - 1591.92] my god i see another shark
[1590.00 - 1593.60] i see another porpoise i see another i
[1591.92 - 1594.80] see another whale i see another this the
[1593.60 - 1596.72] reason why is because there's no more
[1594.80 - 1598.96] ocean left out there in the west coast
[1596.72 - 1600.88] because it's it's a garbage patch now so
[1598.96 - 1601.76] everybody's everything's being pushed to
[1600.88 - 1604.72] this to the
[1601.76 - 1605.52] edge and so i'm done with the whole
[1604.72 - 1608.64] pacifica
[1605.52 - 1609.12] spirulina done like i can't even tell
[1608.64 - 1610.80] you
[1609.12 - 1612.72] and that's the best stuff on the market
[1610.80 - 1614.72] right there is the vimergy which is not
[1612.72 - 1615.52] pacifica and it's the best stuff so it's
[1614.72 - 1618.24] vimergy v
[1615.52 - 1618.80] i m e rgy so talk about that in a little
[1618.24 - 1621.28] bit
[1618.80 - 1622.00] this is this is like more purse this
[1621.28 - 1623.60] whole i i
[1622.00 - 1625.44] i'm always personal with you guys duh
[1623.60 - 1628.48] right i always am
[1625.44 - 1630.64] but this is more like okay what is a w
[1628.48 - 1632.08] doing what where's the fly on the wall
[1630.64 - 1634.16] on aw
[1632.08 - 1635.52] like who's gonna be the [ __ ] where's the
[1634.16 - 1639.60] fly on the wall
[1635.52 - 1641.52] with aw at ew's house right so yeah
[1639.60 - 1643.44] can you say something about vitamin b12
[1641.52 - 1646.24] how much and how long to take this
[1643.44 - 1647.12] vitamin b12 and blood can be on a high
[1646.24 - 1648.88] level
[1647.12 - 1651.04] what do you recommend i noticed that i
[1648.88 - 1653.12] needed a little bit every day
[1651.04 - 1654.80] without i get symptoms okay here's the
[1653.12 - 1656.72] things you get symptoms right
[1654.80 - 1658.32] if you don't take it but yet you have
[1656.72 - 1659.92] high b12 right
[1658.32 - 1661.12] see that's the problem the industry
[1659.92 - 1661.84] doesn't know alternative medicine
[1661.12 - 1664.96] doesn't know
[1661.84 - 1668.16] how b12 works with this okay
[1664.96 - 1669.68] is that it's okay if levels are high
[1668.16 - 1670.96] do what your doctor says though your
[1669.68 - 1672.32] doctor doesn't like something you just
[1670.96 - 1673.76] listen to them i'm just telling you that
[1672.32 - 1674.64] what i would tell my family member if a
[1673.76 - 1678.00] family member
[1674.64 - 1680.80] had high b12 i wouldn't say stop
[1678.00 - 1682.00] taking the b12 because it's helping your
[1680.80 - 1683.76] symptoms get better because
[1682.00 - 1685.28] what they don't measure and what they
[1683.76 - 1686.96] can't measure
[1685.28 - 1689.76] is how much b12 your central nervous
[1686.96 - 1690.64] system has so what i tell my family
[1689.76 - 1694.32] members
[1690.64 - 1696.08] is you keep your b12 high
[1694.32 - 1698.08] so that your central nervous system is
[1696.08 - 1699.44] getting enough b12 which is your cranial
[1698.08 - 1702.32] nerves
[1699.44 - 1704.96] your brain stem your brain stem that
[1702.32 - 1707.28] your brain stem is getting enough b12
[1704.96 - 1708.56] how important that is to get enough b12
[1707.28 - 1712.00] right
[1708.56 - 1716.08] and and because they can't measure
[1712.00 - 1717.76] how much b12 your vagus nerve needs
[1716.08 - 1719.52] you guys see how important this is they
[1717.76 - 1722.56] can't measure how much b12
[1719.52 - 1725.68] your phrenic nerve needs okay
[1722.56 - 1728.40] all in our nerve needs right your
[1725.68 - 1728.88] cochlear nerve needs they can't they
[1728.40 - 1731.52] can't
[1728.88 - 1732.08] um your tibial nerve your you they can't
[1731.52 - 1735.12] measure
[1732.08 - 1735.52] how much these nerves need right sciatic
[1735.12 - 1737.84] nerve
[1735.52 - 1739.52] it's not you know whatever and it's not
[1737.84 - 1741.20] cranial but trigeminal nerve facial
[1739.52 - 1744.64] nerve they can't measure that
[1741.20 - 1748.00] so your symptoms
[1744.64 - 1750.48] can get worse even if you have high b12
[1748.00 - 1751.12] and the wrong kind of b12 won't even
[1750.48 - 1753.84] absorb
[1751.12 - 1755.44] properly so and that's the other thing
[1753.84 - 1757.52] this is the adenosil cobalamin
[1755.44 - 1760.40] methylcobalamin b12
[1757.52 - 1760.88] so i take this every day to get the b12
[1760.40 - 1763.52] i need
[1760.88 - 1766.00] i'm on lots of b12 i mean what i do and
[1763.52 - 1768.08] have to have to conquer on a daily basis
[1766.00 - 1769.36] like the amount of of stuff i have to
[1768.08 - 1771.92] conquer on a daily basis
[1769.36 - 1772.88] when i'm up against every day it's just
[1771.92 - 1776.72] it's it's
[1772.88 - 1778.80] it's absorbing you know that kind of
[1776.72 - 1780.32] i mean you know you need that health of
[1778.80 - 1784.00] liz only learned
[1780.32 - 1786.88] this from you never learned this
[1784.00 - 1788.00] neuro never learned this in neuro class
[1786.88 - 1789.52] i'm honored list it's
[1788.00 - 1791.92] incredible and thank you for being here
[1789.52 - 1793.36] today by the way your support uh is so
[1791.92 - 1796.24] helpful
[1793.36 - 1798.16] what are the right kinds of b12 okay so
[1796.24 - 1800.88] there's a lot of b12 products out there
[1798.16 - 1801.84] alcohol's in there okay preservatives
[1800.88 - 1804.24] are in there
[1801.84 - 1805.60] it's all the bad preservatives and b12s
[1804.24 - 1809.12] keep that in mind
[1805.60 - 1810.88] msg natural flavors are in b12s okay
[1809.12 - 1813.20] and then there's cyclobalamide that's a
[1810.88 - 1815.20] bad b12 there's other there's other b
[1813.20 - 1816.52] 12s so even if you have the right kind
[1815.20 - 1819.36] of b12 like
[1816.52 - 1821.12] methylcobalamin doesn't mean it's the
[1819.36 - 1823.52] right kind of b12 because
[1821.12 - 1825.44] of how it was processed made the the
[1823.52 - 1827.12] quality of it and everything else right
[1825.44 - 1829.12] but the right blend is adenosine
[1827.12 - 1830.64] cobalamin and methylcobalamin that's the
[1829.12 - 1833.36] right blend right there
[1830.64 - 1834.00] and that's it it's avemargee.com v isn't
[1833.36 - 1836.80] victor i
[1834.00 - 1837.60] am ergy.com i'm gonna say their name
[1836.80 - 1839.12] because you guys
[1837.60 - 1840.96] a bunch of people are gonna be like whoa
[1839.12 - 1842.48] where do you get that you know what do
[1840.96 - 1843.12] we do whatever whatever so i'm letting
[1842.48 - 1844.64] you know
[1843.12 - 1846.16] and if you just came on here i'm not
[1844.64 - 1847.36] sponsored by these guys i'm not the
[1846.16 - 1849.04] owner of the company
[1847.36 - 1850.48] if i owned a supplement company i say
[1849.04 - 1852.40] this all the time if i owned a tea
[1850.48 - 1854.96] company supplement company or whatever
[1852.40 - 1856.48] you'd see medical medium across the
[1854.96 - 1860.96] front
[1856.48 - 1865.36] right so what i'm doing here is
[1860.96 - 1868.16] four dropper fulls of b12 right
[1865.36 - 1870.64] murray hell taylor why did you switch
[1868.16 - 1872.00] the b12 you were recommending two years
[1870.64 - 1874.64] ago
[1872.00 - 1875.76] because i always go to the better the
[1874.64 - 1877.92] better b12
[1875.76 - 1879.28] that's why i don't think it was two
[1877.92 - 1882.64] years ago it could have been
[1879.28 - 1884.40] three years ago um
[1882.64 - 1886.24] could have been four years ago not sure
[1884.40 - 1888.64] how long ago uh
[1886.24 - 1890.56] but when a better one comes out i don't
[1888.64 - 1893.60] have loyalty
[1890.56 - 1894.88] to the one that's not as good there's
[1893.60 - 1896.48] something to be said about that i've
[1894.88 - 1898.16] seen people what happens is people who
[1896.48 - 1901.12] are involved in the supplement world
[1898.16 - 1903.68] right um the meaning like they're being
[1901.12 - 1906.88] endorsed or paid or sponsored
[1903.68 - 1908.80] or they own the company right they even
[1906.88 - 1910.72] if their product is garbage they stand
[1908.80 - 1913.60] behind their garbage product
[1910.72 - 1914.40] so i don't have that loyalty i'm not
[1913.60 - 1917.76] chained
[1914.40 - 1919.76] to a company for loyalty if the b12
[1917.76 - 1920.32] product is not as good and there's one
[1919.76 - 1923.04] better
[1920.32 - 1924.40] then guess what i'm on to the better one
[1923.04 - 1926.56] and guess what
[1924.40 - 1928.00] i'm gonna stay with that and stay with
[1926.56 - 1930.80] that end state with that
[1928.00 - 1931.36] that's what i do this is the b12 right
[1930.80 - 1933.76] here
[1931.36 - 1935.92] um but if they change for the worst if
[1933.76 - 1939.36] any company changes for the worst
[1935.92 - 1939.84] bye bye bye bye that's just the bottom
[1939.36 - 1941.04] line
[1939.84 - 1943.20] because i always got to think about you
[1941.04 - 1944.24] guys that's what it is it's always got
[1943.20 - 1946.48] to think about you guys
[1944.24 - 1947.92] well if i was chronically ill i want to
[1946.48 - 1948.40] make sure i have the best opportunity to
[1947.92 - 1950.08] heal
[1948.40 - 1952.24] and i have the best stuff there is so
[1950.08 - 1953.28] that's four dropper fulls of b12 right
[1952.24 - 1954.80] here in the shot glass
[1953.28 - 1956.64] you guys just came on here this is what
[1954.80 - 1957.84] i do you talk to your doctor whatever
[1956.64 - 1959.60] you guys want to do
[1957.84 - 1963.36] i'm just saying this is what i do right
[1959.60 - 1966.40] here me in my life personally okay
[1963.36 - 1968.48] i take the best stuff is what i do i
[1966.40 - 1970.72] only take the best stuff
[1968.48 - 1972.16] personally inside my body everybody says
[1970.72 - 1972.72] the body's the temple the body is the
[1972.16 - 1974.84] temple
[1972.72 - 1976.80] body's temple yeah let's treat it that
[1974.84 - 1980.88] way
[1976.80 - 1980.88] which re reminds me of something right
[1981.52 - 1984.56] so that's four dropper fulls of b12 i
[1983.12 - 1987.12] take that um
[1984.56 - 1989.12] i take that twice a day sometimes i'll
[1987.12 - 1991.84] do six dropper holes
[1989.12 - 1993.20] if someone does a half a drop or full
[1991.84 - 1995.04] it's going to help
[1993.20 - 1996.48] it's going to help if somebody does that
[1995.04 - 1998.72] much
[1996.48 - 1999.84] if someone's on a like a budget they're
[1998.72 - 2000.88] worried and they're like well i don't
[1999.84 - 2002.32] want
[2000.88 - 2003.84] you know i'm not under a lot of stress
[2002.32 - 2005.84] right now i just want to take a little
[2003.84 - 2007.28] b12 just take a little b12
[2005.84 - 2008.72] i tell friends you could just take a
[2007.28 - 2011.52] little bit of b12 right there you can do
[2008.72 - 2012.96] a quarter dropper full or something or
[2011.52 - 2014.64] since you can just do that a lot of
[2012.96 - 2016.08] people they're really sensitive
[2014.64 - 2017.60] and that's what i love about the vimergy
[2016.08 - 2018.64] products because they're force sensitive
[2017.60 - 2020.40] people
[2018.64 - 2022.24] a lot of people are really sensitive
[2020.40 - 2024.56] they only need to take a little
[2022.24 - 2025.76] so you know little is is good they get a
[2024.56 - 2029.76] little bit in them
[2025.76 - 2033.60] that's fine quality matters
[2029.76 - 2035.84] cheap crappy junk out there
[2033.60 - 2037.68] really holds people back it holds them
[2035.84 - 2038.64] back from healing i've talked about this
[2037.68 - 2041.12] for years
[2038.64 - 2043.04] so garbage products holds them back
[2041.12 - 2046.56] holds their healing back
[2043.04 - 2049.12] so and that happens all the time right
[2046.56 - 2050.64] so all right move on a little bit i just
[2049.12 - 2053.36] showed you some lemon balm
[2050.64 - 2055.92] shot right there the b12 right there now
[2053.36 - 2058.00] i take b12 also orally so i also do it
[2055.92 - 2061.36] this way too every day i'll drop four
[2058.00 - 2064.16] dropper full just like that i'll try not
[2061.36 - 2067.20] to get it on my yellow shirt
[2064.16 - 2071.52] so okay let's move on to more of
[2067.20 - 2074.00] now like a medicinal shot right
[2071.52 - 2075.92] let's go into that realm okay so i'm
[2074.00 - 2078.96] exposed i get exposed
[2075.92 - 2080.72] if i you know like
[2078.96 - 2082.00] i like to keep my immune system strong
[2080.72 - 2084.16] so every
[2082.00 - 2086.40] day if i get especially if i'm getting
[2084.16 - 2089.84] exposed in some way through work
[2086.40 - 2089.84] or anything like that
[2091.04 - 2096.00] chelsea floyd first time i had liquid
[2093.44 - 2098.32] zinc from my local health food store
[2096.00 - 2099.44] it made me throw up i bet it did i bet
[2098.32 - 2101.28] it did
[2099.44 - 2103.20] but it was not good for sensitive
[2101.28 - 2104.40] stomachs i bet it wasn't it's one of my
[2103.20 - 2105.28] biggest fear out there of all the
[2104.40 - 2107.04] junkies
[2105.28 - 2108.40] zinc out there was nervous to try the
[2107.04 - 2111.44] vimergy one
[2108.40 - 2114.00] but it was so gentle no issues chelsea
[2111.44 - 2115.36] that means everything and that was the
[2114.00 - 2117.68] zinc world before
[2115.36 - 2118.56] vimergy came along right that was the
[2117.68 - 2121.60] zinc world
[2118.56 - 2123.60] the zinc world was you take zinc and you
[2121.60 - 2124.08] get nauseous you get sick or you just
[2123.60 - 2126.08] you can't
[2124.08 - 2128.16] you know because of all the citric acid
[2126.08 - 2129.84] in it and all the garbage and junk in it
[2128.16 - 2131.28] that's what that is and that's why i
[2129.84 - 2134.72] love the vimorji
[2131.28 - 2136.40] of emergency zinc it changes everything
[2134.72 - 2138.80] it allows somebody to have a chance to
[2136.40 - 2140.88] actually heal and and to take something

[2209.12 - 2211.52] let's go into a little bit let's do kind
[2210.96 - 2213.20] of a
[2211.52 - 2215.92] this next little thing so what i'll do
[2213.20 - 2219.76] is i love licorice
[2215.92 - 2221.20] okay i love it for my for my adrenal
[2219.76 - 2223.76] glands
[2221.20 - 2226.16] i love it for my adrenal glands you know
[2223.76 - 2228.48] what about aw's adrenal glands
[2226.16 - 2230.00] okay what about what about his adrenal
[2228.48 - 2234.16] glands okay
[2230.00 - 2237.84] so i love licorice for my adrenal glands
[2234.16 - 2240.48] right there my adrenals
[2237.84 - 2241.44] are pumping because i'm dying out fires
[2240.48 - 2245.12] a lot
[2241.44 - 2246.24] dine out a lot of fires and that's three
[2245.12 - 2249.20] dropper fulls
[2246.24 - 2251.84] of licorice now what i recommend is you
[2249.20 - 2254.08] talking to your doctor
[2251.84 - 2254.96] about licorice is licorice okay for you
[2254.08 - 2256.88] to take
[2254.96 - 2258.40] i talk about take the book to your
[2256.88 - 2260.24] doctor and you'll you'll see where it
[2258.40 - 2261.60] says licorice and how many dosages and
[2260.24 - 2262.08] what how much licorice or whatever to
[2261.60 - 2263.36] take
[2262.08 - 2265.28] bring it to your doctor ask your doctor
[2263.36 - 2267.68] about it you know and
[2265.28 - 2269.84] that's that's what you can do lorraine
[2267.68 - 2272.16] it's pretty cozy right
[2269.84 - 2273.04] yeah i know it is i feel i feel that way
[2272.16 - 2276.08] too
[2273.04 - 2278.64] quality in licorice matters i'm gonna be
[2276.08 - 2280.08] straight up about that another thing
[2278.64 - 2283.12] again like the quality
[2280.08 - 2286.56] matters means everything with licorice
[2283.12 - 2288.24] working like working okay
[2286.56 - 2289.68] no alcohol no citric acid but the
[2288.24 - 2292.32] quality of licorice itself
[2289.68 - 2292.88] right it in the resin involved in the
[2292.32 - 2296.16] licorice
[2292.88 - 2300.16] it matters right to how it works so what
[2296.16 - 2305.20] i love about licorice it's anti-pathogen
[2300.16 - 2308.48] antiviral anti-bug anti-pathogen
[2305.20 - 2311.76] why is everybody sick
[2308.48 - 2315.52] with mystery illness because
[2311.76 - 2317.04] their nerves are inflamed from pathogens
[2315.52 - 2319.12] from viruses they talk about that in the
[2317.04 - 2322.16] medical medium books right
[2319.12 - 2323.60] and so their nerves are inflamed from
[2322.16 - 2326.32] pathogens
[2323.60 - 2326.96] so keep that in mind details matter dale
[2326.32 - 2330.56] right on
[2326.96 - 2333.04] this is details this is details
[2330.56 - 2334.24] okay so i just put three dropper fulls
[2333.04 - 2337.36] of licorice in there
[2334.24 - 2340.08] all right now i'm also gonna put
[2337.36 - 2342.32] okay a little bit of goldenseal in here
[2340.08 - 2345.44] because that's what i do
[2342.32 - 2347.84] i'll do licorice and some goldenseal
[2345.44 - 2350.56] so i'm going to do three dropper fulls
[2347.84 - 2350.56] of goldenseal
[2351.68 - 2359.23] that's the vimergy goldenseal okay
[2355.76 - 2362.48] anna sophie please the doctors again

[2372.16 - 2376.00] there's times some days that it changes
[2374.56 - 2377.84] with me okay
[2376.00 - 2380.08] it changes with me and well you know
[2377.84 - 2382.32] what dr nesbitt might come in here
[2380.08 - 2383.36] in a little bit might bring on dr
[2382.32 - 2386.88] nesbitt
[2383.36 - 2390.80] he's a board-certified surgeon
[2386.88 - 2394.84] and a board-certified

[2402.56 - 2407.12] cat's claw in there okay
[2404.72 - 2408.08] all right you're someone's asking what
[2407.12 - 2412.96] would um
[2408.08 - 2414.96] dr desmond i might bring dr nesbit on
[2412.96 - 2417.20] but i want dr nesbitt to ruin this
[2414.96 - 2420.00] personal moment
[2417.20 - 2421.12] with us right now anyway in here i talk
[2420.00 - 2424.00] about goldenseal
[2421.12 - 2425.52] in the different right tear appleman
[2424.00 - 2429.04] right dr nesbit
[2425.52 - 2430.72] okay if someone's really viral they
[2429.04 - 2432.32] you know i talk about that in this
[2430.72 - 2436.88] section here
[2432.32 - 2440.08] someone's really viral i love goldenseal
[2436.88 - 2441.20] but i talk about dosages do smaller
[2440.08 - 2443.04] dosages i go
[2441.20 - 2444.32] that's why this part is so important to
[2443.04 - 2447.68] read so
[2444.32 - 2447.68] important to read okay
[2449.36 - 2455.20] dr nesbit is a very qualified
[2452.40 - 2456.64] doctor by the way i'll bring him on a
[2455.20 - 2459.92] little bit
[2456.64 - 2461.36] if i could find him
[2459.92 - 2463.04] all right let's just keep on going i put
[2461.36 - 2465.12] cat squad here i put licorice in here
[2463.04 - 2467.68] i'm having too much fun
[2465.12 - 2468.96] golden seal i like to do two weeks on
[2467.68 - 2470.72] two weeks off
[2468.96 - 2472.72] depending and i talk about that in the
[2470.72 - 2474.08] book okay licorice root i like to do two
[2472.72 - 2475.36] weeks on two weeks off
[2474.08 - 2476.72] sometimes i'll do licorice fruit
[2475.36 - 2478.24] straight and not take weeks off
[2476.72 - 2478.88] sometimes i'll do golden steel like that
[2478.24 - 2481.36] too
[2478.88 - 2483.04] but it says in my book you do it two
[2481.36 - 2484.00] weeks on two weeks off it's a great way
[2483.04 - 2486.48] of doing it
[2484.00 - 2488.64] so i have this right here okay so we got
[2486.48 - 2490.88] that what else do i put in here i don't

[2532.24 - 2535.60] qualified too

[2535.60 - 2538.88] i've ever taught and i have talked to
[2537.44 - 2539.60] thousands of doctors over the last three
[2538.88 - 2541.68] five years

[2689.68 - 2691.84] ah
[2693.12 - 2696.72] let's see house of liz says you have
[2695.52 - 2697.92] cleanse to heal
[2696.72 - 2700.24] i don't think you're talking to somebody
[2697.92 - 2703.20] else emma says
[2700.24 - 2705.20] your mono cleanses helped me like
[2703.20 - 2708.24] nothing else has ever
[2705.20 - 2709.76] i'm sorry i ever doubted you
[2708.24 - 2712.16] that you know it's incredible i'm
[2709.76 - 2715.84] honored and
[2712.16 - 2718.16] uh people doubt me they do i know i know
[2715.84 - 2720.56] it's just it's amazing but they do and
[2718.16 - 2722.80] the funny thing is is
[2720.56 - 2725.36] i i think i think you just have to be
[2722.80 - 2728.00] sick enough you know to just
[2725.36 - 2728.40] go around merry around and and that's
[2728.00 - 2730.48] just
[2728.40 - 2732.00] what i talk about at the colts out there
[2730.48 - 2734.16] because there's a difference
[2732.00 - 2735.76] like this is not a cult those are colts
[2734.16 - 2737.52] out there how they do it they do the
[2735.76 - 2739.60] brainwashing they got the power and the
[2737.52 - 2740.72] money behind it and it trickles down and
[2739.60 - 2742.64] everybody gets
[2740.72 - 2744.16] brainwashed it's really sick how it
[2742.64 - 2745.28] works um
[2744.16 - 2747.20] and when you really learn the medical
[2745.28 - 2748.64] medium tools and how to use it and
[2747.20 - 2750.32] you're not dabbling in it what's going
[2748.64 - 2752.32] to happen is here's one thing too
[2750.32 - 2754.00] you'll run across somebody dabbling in
[2752.32 - 2755.52] say somebody new and you'll run across
[2754.00 - 2756.72] somebody dabbling in the medical medium
[2755.52 - 2758.56] tools
[2756.72 - 2760.08] and they're dabbling so they're not
[2758.56 - 2761.52] really seeing results because they're
[2760.08 - 2763.04] also doing all this other stuff they're
[2761.52 - 2764.32] doing their colostrum and their in their
[2763.04 - 2766.08] collagen and their fish oil and their
[2764.32 - 2767.44] protein powders and their msg which they
[2766.08 - 2769.76] don't know in their caffeine
[2767.44 - 2770.72] and they're alkaline ionizer alkaline
[2769.76 - 2771.84] water machines
[2770.72 - 2773.76] they're doing all these things that are
[2771.84 - 2776.56] poisoning themselves right
[2773.76 - 2778.40] and then they do they dabble with a
[2776.56 - 2780.72] little bit of medical medium
[2778.40 - 2782.08] and it's keeping them a little stable
[2780.72 - 2783.60] but they don't realize it but they just
[2782.08 - 2785.36] don't know better and then
[2783.60 - 2787.44] someone runs across them and be like oh
[2785.36 - 2788.80] medical medium's not doing it for me no
[2787.44 - 2789.92] and then you that's it you lost your
[2788.80 - 2791.60] chance because you're gonna be like i
[2789.92 - 2793.84] doubt it i doubt that guy's
[2791.60 - 2794.88] got info the whole bit even though
[2793.84 - 2796.48] millions have healed
[2794.88 - 2797.68] it's just unbelievable let's go let's
[2796.48 - 2798.72] keep on moving forward we've got another
[2797.68 - 2802.40] shot glass so
[2798.72 - 2805.36] so ashwagandha
[2802.40 - 2805.84] sits a medical medium tools ashwagandha
[2805.36 - 2808.00] right
[2805.84 - 2809.44] it's it's always been i've always liked
[2808.00 - 2811.92] ashwagandha okay
[2809.44 - 2812.80] in the sense where it's a medical medium
[2811.92 - 2815.20] tool
[2812.80 - 2816.72] because of some of the reasons why we
[2815.20 - 2819.04] hear about ashwagandha
[2816.72 - 2821.04] stems from medical medium for 35 years
[2819.04 - 2822.08] okay and it's just like cat's claw cat's
[2821.04 - 2825.20] claw
[2822.08 - 2826.72] is used in neurological lyme disease
[2825.20 - 2829.04] right now for neurological lyme
[2826.72 - 2830.00] that's because of medical medium it's 35
[2829.04 - 2832.08] years of teaching
[2830.00 - 2833.68] lyme doctors fighting for lecturing
[2832.08 - 2835.84] about cats claw for
[2833.68 - 2837.36] viruses and bacteria and stuff so
[2835.84 - 2837.84] ashwagandha is kind of the same thing
[2837.36 - 2841.44] now
[2837.84 - 2841.44] i take ashwagandha every day
[2842.84 - 2848.96] so can i put the supplements in orange
[2846.56 - 2851.12] juice yes you can i put in water you can
[2848.96 - 2854.80] put it in orange juice of course you can
[2851.12 - 2859.12] definitely can why take supplements
[2854.80 - 2860.72] separately or together okay
[2859.12 - 2862.00] you can take them all together if that's
[2860.72 - 2862.88] what you do if that's what your doctor
[2862.00 - 2864.88] recommends
[2862.88 - 2866.40] um you don't have to do anything i'm
[2864.88 - 2868.08] doing course not just do what your
[2866.40 - 2871.12] doctor says
[2868.08 - 2871.44] but with me is the lemon bomb shot i
[2871.12 - 2873.60] take
[2871.44 - 2875.36] separately i use it as a medical medium
[2873.60 - 2877.92] tool separately
[2875.36 - 2878.64] so yeah cold white spring says dr
[2877.92 - 2881.68] nesbitt
[2878.64 - 2884.40] have you been laying eggs
[2881.68 - 2885.76] all right so i'll take it separately as
[2884.40 - 2886.48] a medical medium tool that's what i'll
[2885.76 - 2889.20] do
[2886.48 - 2890.96] i mix herbs that spirit compassion is
[2889.20 - 2892.88] telling me to do in that moment too
[2890.96 - 2894.64] and and that's how i live my life you
[2892.88 - 2895.44] know i'm hearing information from spirit
[2894.64 - 2896.88] of compassion
[2895.44 - 2898.56] since age four if you don't know that
[2896.88 - 2900.08] about me if you guys want to learn that
[2898.56 - 2900.56] you can learn it in the books and
[2900.08 - 2902.88] that'll be
[2900.56 - 2904.72] in books if you want to learn about that
[2902.88 - 2907.04] medical medium new edition right there
[2904.72 - 2910.08] check that book out read origin so you
[2907.04 - 2910.08] understand how it works
[2910.80 - 2914.72] okay quality matters there's so many
[2913.12 - 2916.64] junkie ashwagandhas out there it's
[2914.72 - 2917.84] unbelievable there's junkie ashwagandha
[2916.64 - 2921.60] powders there's junkie
[2917.84 - 2924.88] ashwagandha capsules and and tablets
[2921.60 - 2927.20] bad tinctures and
[2924.88 - 2929.52] that's a problem all on its own so
[2927.20 - 2933.12] that's something to look out for too
[2929.52 - 2935.68] and and that that's
[2933.12 - 2936.56] junky ashwagandha can make somebody sick
[2935.68 - 2939.12] by the way
[2936.56 - 2941.28] really sick so there's a dropper full of
[2939.12 - 2941.68] ashwagandha i usually take a dropper
[2941.28 - 2944.80] full of
[2941.68 - 2947.44] ashwagandha once a day
[2944.80 - 2949.36] i tend to not mix it remember alcohol
[2947.44 - 2951.60] and additives and citric acid
[2949.36 - 2952.88] and msg and natural flavors that's the
[2951.60 - 2954.80] stuff that's really bad
[2952.88 - 2956.00] there's bad powders out there that have
[2954.80 - 2958.08] even that in there
[2956.00 - 2959.44] not only they're just junky powders they
[2958.08 - 2960.88] got a lot of dust in them
[2959.44 - 2963.28] so the one thing you'll find with
[2960.88 - 2965.68] powders like ashwagandha powder and
[2963.28 - 2969.04] herbal powders what you'll find is
[2965.68 - 2971.84] there's herbal dust in those
[2969.04 - 2972.88] powders and you guys are eating dirt and
[2971.84 - 2975.52] don't know it
[2972.88 - 2976.08] that's how it works you're eating dirt
[2975.52 - 2977.60] then
[2976.08 - 2979.92] and so what happens is when you're
[2977.60 - 2983.12] getting all your herbal powders
[2979.92 - 2984.48] right okay and you're doing that herbal
[2983.12 - 2987.84] powder and herbal
[2984.48 - 2988.96] tablets and and many times herbal
[2987.84 - 2991.92] capsules
[2988.96 - 2992.56] you're eating herbal dust you're eating
[2991.92 - 2995.76] herbal
[2992.56 - 2996.32] dirt you're eating you're actually
[2995.76 - 3000.72] eating
[2996.32 - 3002.80] dirt and dust mixed with your herbs
[3000.72 - 3004.48] and people don't realize that and that's
[3002.80 - 3006.00] that's that's
[3004.48 - 3007.76] that's something that gets in that
[3006.00 - 3011.04] people don't even realize it yeah
[3007.76 - 3012.64] it's how it works um but yeah there's so
[3011.04 - 3014.00] much to talk about i mean i can cover a
[3012.64 - 3015.52] million things and i'm trying to
[3014.00 - 3017.44] trying to harness myself a little bit
[3015.52 - 3019.60] because i want to give you guys
[3017.44 - 3021.04] enough time on what i take but i can go
[3019.60 - 3022.24] on forever with so much and that's
[3021.04 - 3024.72] what's cool we're going to do
[3022.24 - 3028.24] a series of these over the next like
[3024.72 - 3028.24] week week and a half two weeks
[3028.72 - 3031.92] there's people out there that will say
[3030.16 - 3034.00] i'm doing medical medium
[3031.92 - 3034.96] but they're not they're doing
[3034.00 - 3036.72] supplements
[3034.96 - 3038.16] that are bad that medical media would
[3036.72 - 3040.96] never recommend
[3038.16 - 3042.56] okay so that's they're using companies
[3040.96 - 3044.32] that cut corners
[3042.56 - 3046.08] and that's another thing too so one of
[3044.32 - 3047.60] the biggest scams and supplements if you
[3046.08 - 3049.04] want to know
[3047.60 - 3052.24] one of the biggest scams in the
[3049.04 - 3055.76] supplement world is putting a little bit
[3052.24 - 3059.84] of something into the supplement
[3055.76 - 3062.88] a little bit of cat's claw a crappy one
[3059.84 - 3064.08] a little bit of nettle crappy one a
[3062.88 - 3067.68] little bit of
[3064.08 - 3070.96] ashwagandha a crappy one a little bit of
[3067.68 - 3072.48] this junk right like garbage little
[3070.96 - 3076.80] pieces bits and pieces
[3072.48 - 3078.32] now you've got a fat capsule or a powder
[3076.80 - 3080.40] that has a little bit of everything and
[3078.32 - 3082.80] that's how they rip you off i know how
[3080.40 - 3085.92] the supplement industry works
[3082.80 - 3087.20] they scam you by putting a whole bunch
[3085.92 - 3089.60] of stuff in there
[3087.20 - 3090.32] slapping a label on it here's our green
[3089.60 - 3092.72] powder
[3090.32 - 3094.64] mix it's got all these different things
[3092.72 - 3096.24] in here it's got alfalfa in it it's got
[3094.64 - 3098.00] this in it that in it
[3096.24 - 3099.20] and it does the list a little corella in
[3098.00 - 3099.60] there and it does this list down the
[3099.20 - 3102.00] line
[3099.60 - 3103.44] and you get a little speck and that's
[3102.00 - 3105.36] how they bank
[3103.44 - 3107.12] they rip you off because you can't get
[3105.36 - 3109.04] better with this you can't get better
[3107.12 - 3110.64] you can't heal you can't recover with a
[3109.04 - 3112.24] speck
[3110.64 - 3114.40] of something that's not even a good
[3112.24 - 3116.32] quality you can't recover
[3114.40 - 3117.76] with just a speck thrown in there so
[3116.32 - 3119.04] important now all right so there's the
[3117.76 - 3121.20] ashwagandha
[3119.04 - 3122.80] okay so i did one dropper full sometimes
[3121.20 - 3124.96] i'll do a drop or full twice a day
[3122.80 - 3125.84] sometimes i'll do two twice a day today
[3124.96 - 3130.24] i'm doing
[3125.84 - 3130.24] one probably twice a day
[3131.20 - 3135.36] if you're not so sick you might get a
[3132.96 - 3137.04] tiny benefit from that technique of
[3135.36 - 3138.72] just a little bit of garbage in these
[3137.04 - 3141.84] supplements so a powder
[3138.72 - 3143.52] or a capsule and you're just getting a
[3141.84 - 3145.28] little bit of that
[3143.52 - 3147.04] product in the capsule a little bit of
[3145.28 - 3148.80] that product in the powder
[3147.04 - 3150.40] and you might actually benefit as a not
[3148.80 - 3152.00] so sick person meanwhile if you clean
[3150.40 - 3154.40] your diet as a not so sick person
[3152.00 - 3155.12] you take enough junky supplements you
[3154.40 - 3158.00] might see
[3155.12 - 3158.88] some difference but it's when you get
[3158.00 - 3161.20] sick
[3158.88 - 3162.72] that's when everything changes that's
[3161.20 - 3164.00] when all the junk and garbage out there
[3162.72 - 3165.68] will take you down so let's move into a
[3164.00 - 3169.44] couple other things
[3165.68 - 3171.28] got the licorice right did some cat's
[3169.44 - 3173.04] claw we did that so we can talk about
[3171.28 - 3174.48] some capsules i did some b12
[3173.04 - 3176.32] if you guys just got on here this
[3174.48 - 3179.20] vimorgy.com vs invictor i
[3176.32 - 3180.00] am e r g y dot com you go to i'm not
[3179.20 - 3181.36] sponsored by these
[3180.00 - 3185.04] guys but i'm showing you what i've taken
[3181.36 - 3188.32] today and how it works 5mthf right there
[3185.04 - 3189.60] i take that every single day 5mthf it's
[3188.32 - 3191.68] a methylfolate right
[3189.60 - 3193.20] best one on the markets of emergency one
[3191.68 - 3197.04] right
[3193.20 - 3200.24] so i'll take one capsule a day
[3197.04 - 3201.76] sometimes i'll take two pop one down now
[3200.24 - 3203.36] well let me get a little cup i'll use
[3201.76 - 3206.56] this
[3203.36 - 3210.40] so can't use that
[3206.56 - 3210.40] and that's what i like about live
[3213.44 - 3218.40] so i'll take a 5 mthf right
[3217.12 - 3220.16] that's funny i didn't know there were
[3218.40 - 3224.32] holes in this but you know what there is
[3220.16 - 3227.28] because this is a water bottle
[3224.32 - 3228.64] so it's a 5m thf i take every day what
[3227.28 - 3231.20] else do i take
[3228.64 - 3234.32] i take glutathione every single day
[3231.20 - 3236.16] there you go that's of image glutathione
[3234.32 - 3238.64] now i don't have a chance probably to
[3236.16 - 3240.32] give you every little bit about these
[3238.64 - 3242.64] but let's go into some other stuff i do
[3240.32 - 3245.36] at night
[3242.64 - 3247.04] so what if i can't swallow pills if i
[3245.36 - 3247.76] was somebody that couldn't swallow pills
[3247.04 - 3250.32] right
[3247.76 - 3251.36] i would get the powders for one at
[3250.32 - 3254.96] vimergy
[3251.36 - 3256.08] okay that's what i would do for one so i
[3254.96 - 3258.72] would get everything
[3256.08 - 3261.36] like the powders and vimergy the barley
[3258.72 - 3264.00] grass powder or the spirulina and then
[3261.36 - 3264.40] the liquids of course i would do right
[3264.00 - 3266.08] and then
[3264.40 - 3267.44] tease like i was showing you guys at the
[3266.08 - 3269.68] beginning the t's right
[3267.44 - 3271.12] and then i would open a capsule so let's
[3269.68 - 3274.48] go into that next
[3271.12 - 3276.24] okay let's grab a cup here let's open a
[3274.48 - 3278.64] capsule so
[3276.24 - 3280.80] magnesium that's something i take every
[3278.64 - 3284.16] single day
[3280.80 - 3284.16] all right so
[3287.92 - 3291.44] so i would open a capsule is what i
[3289.68 - 3294.24] would do
[3291.44 - 3295.92] like that and i would take it that way
[3294.24 - 3297.52] with open capsules and i would mix it i
[3295.92 - 3299.28] would mix it with oj it would mix it
[3297.52 - 3301.04] with anything you want to mix it
[3299.28 - 3302.64] some water some coconut water is a good
[3301.04 - 3304.16] way to mix it right there
[3302.64 - 3305.84] so let's talk about zinc for a little
[3304.16 - 3308.32] bit so zinc shock therapy is a medical
[3305.84 - 3310.56] medium tool
[3308.32 - 3312.40] i talked about that i might and like i
[3310.56 - 3315.28] said this is just about what i take
[3312.40 - 3315.76] in a day i'm going to be doing more
[3315.28 - 3318.40] lives
[3315.76 - 3320.16] as we go on throughout like the next two
[3318.40 - 3324.00] weeks about this stuff
[3320.16 - 3324.00] so when it comes down to zinc
[3324.24 - 3327.44] i'll put zinc in here
[3328.00 - 3332.56] the pdf that i put out went around about
[3330.40 - 3335.28] sink helping for the pandemic
[3332.56 - 3336.96] that's how the zinc thing caught on
[3335.28 - 3337.68] liquid zinc sulfate's the right one to
[3336.96 - 3339.04] use
[3337.68 - 3341.12] now what you're gonna see here's how
[3339.04 - 3343.44] medical medium information works okay
[3341.12 - 3345.92] here's the zinc we're using here's how
[3343.44 - 3349.36] medical medium information works
[3345.92 - 3351.92] is medical medium puts info out
[3349.36 - 3353.20] it spreads around through the books and
[3351.92 - 3356.48] through social media
[3353.20 - 3358.88] okay and then other people change their
[3356.48 - 3360.64] supplementation around medical medium so
[3358.88 - 3362.16] all the other companies
[3360.64 - 3364.08] change their supplementation around
[3362.16 - 3365.52] medical medium they start putting things
[3364.08 - 3366.64] in their probiotics now because
[3365.52 - 3368.64] probiotics don't work
[3366.64 - 3370.00] they never did but they start putting
[3368.64 - 3373.20] like a little
[3370.00 - 3374.48] speck of this like lysine in a probiotic
[3373.20 - 3377.52] because of medical medium
[3374.48 - 3379.52] they put a little speck of zinc in a pro
[3377.52 - 3381.20] probiotic or they're putting these
[3379.52 - 3382.80] different immune system ones they'll put
[3381.20 - 3385.12] a little bit of vitamin c in something
[3382.80 - 3386.88] now so they're they're making
[3385.12 - 3388.48] all these different formulas out there
[3386.88 - 3390.40] but ripping people off
[3388.48 - 3392.08] is what they're doing they're making all
[3390.40 - 3393.28] these different formulas and they're
[3392.08 - 3395.12] ripping people off
[3393.28 - 3396.96] and that's how they do it out there
[3395.12 - 3397.52] they'll put a speck of lemon balm in
[3396.96 - 3399.52] something
[3397.52 - 3400.80] a speck of zinc and something they'll
[3399.52 - 3403.52] add it now into their
[3400.80 - 3405.68] collagen so now collagen powders because
[3403.52 - 3407.92] medical medium hit collagen powder so
[3405.68 - 3409.68] hard right because i wrote about it in
[3407.92 - 3410.56] the books i talked about how collagen
[3409.68 - 3412.72] doesn't repair
[3410.56 - 3414.24] skin you actually need the building
[3412.72 - 3416.48] blocks to create collagen
[3414.24 - 3418.00] in your body right you guys and because
[3416.48 - 3420.24] medical medium was the first to put
[3418.00 - 3423.20] that out there that collagen itself
[3420.24 - 3426.16] doesn't fix your skin or your body
[3423.20 - 3427.36] or tissue it's it's the building blocks
[3426.16 - 3430.24] to make so that your
[3427.36 - 3432.08] body makes collagen so that was original
[3430.24 - 3433.52] mm info now everybody stole that
[3432.08 - 3435.28] info not citing it and now they're
[3433.52 - 3436.64] creating products for collagen building
[3435.28 - 3437.92] now that isn't collagen
[3436.64 - 3440.00] they remove the collagen and they're
[3437.92 - 3441.76] putting all these medical medium tools
[3440.00 - 3443.28] and products down so that's how it works
[3441.76 - 3443.68] the medical medium puts something out
[3443.28 - 3446.72] there
[3443.68 - 3448.64] like for instance zinc all right
[3446.72 - 3450.32] zinc is out there because of the whole
[3448.64 - 3452.08] the pandemic now they talk about
[3450.32 - 3453.44] it's important with the pandemic you see
[3452.08 - 3455.84] doctors talking about zinc
[3453.44 - 3457.28] that originated from medical medium info
[3455.84 - 3458.56] you know all these years and then the
[3457.28 - 3460.64] pdf i put out
[3458.56 - 3461.76] the 35 years of doing work so i'm
[3460.64 - 3464.72] letting you know how mm
[3461.76 - 3466.24] info goes around how where it originates
[3464.72 - 3467.84] and i'm allowed to say it
[3466.24 - 3469.28] because the proof is there
[3467.84 - 3470.88] documentation's there and the proof's
[3469.28 - 3472.88] there where it originates with medical
[3470.88 - 3476.24] medium all of this stuff
[3472.88 - 3479.12] so there's somebody new here
[3476.24 - 3479.12] it is what it is
[3479.36 - 3482.72] patrice bennett how are you anthony why
[3482.16 - 3484.96] do you think
[3482.72 - 3486.84] other vitamin companies are not as pure
[3484.96 - 3491.12] as vimergy
[3486.84 - 3495.20] oh money money money money
[3491.12 - 3499.12] money that's what it is
[3495.20 - 3500.40] right so because it you can cut corners
[3499.12 - 3501.84] as a supplement company
[3500.40 - 3503.52] you can cut corners to the point where
[3501.84 - 3506.40] you couldn't even believe
[3503.52 - 3506.72] and your margins are unreal you can use
[3506.40 - 3508.96] cut
[3506.72 - 3510.48] corners with fillers and you can cut
[3508.96 - 3511.92] corners with with lower
[3510.48 - 3513.52] did you know that did you know
[3511.92 - 3515.60] supplement companies have a choice
[3513.52 - 3516.64] to use high grade and low grade did you
[3515.60 - 3518.48] guys know that
[3516.64 - 3520.00] when you're a supplement company and
[3518.48 - 3523.92] you're buying your product
[3520.00 - 3525.76] bulk you can buy the different levels
[3523.92 - 3527.20] all supplement companies don't buy the
[3525.76 - 3530.48] highest level
[3527.20 - 3532.40] they don't they buy the lower levels
[3530.48 - 3533.76] and they won't go up to the higher
[3532.40 - 3535.28] levels
[3533.76 - 3537.44] so they give you junk that's how it
[3535.28 - 3540.56] works it's one of the scheisterest
[3537.44 - 3540.96] sheisterous scheister businesses out
[3540.56 - 3544.56] there
[3540.96 - 3547.92] supplement world shyster business
[3544.56 - 3551.04] of like big time my god
[3547.92 - 3552.08] um all right we talked about capsules a
[3551.04 - 3554.32] little bit right
[3552.08 - 3557.20] so here's something i do this is some
[3554.32 - 3560.16] coconut water in here
[3557.20 - 3560.16] wait hold on
[3560.40 - 3563.04] talk about the zinc a little bit added
[3561.76 - 3564.32] water to the zinc we'll cover that a
[3563.04 - 3565.52] little bit i didn't finish talking about
[3564.32 - 3567.92] this thing trying to find it
[3565.52 - 3568.80] all the labels are backwards here okay
[3567.92 - 3570.72] there we go
[3568.80 - 3572.40] and i got this ink right there so i take
[3570.72 - 3573.84] the zinc every single day i'll take two
[3572.40 - 3576.08] dropper fulls three dropper fulls
[3573.84 - 3576.88] of zinc every day ask your doctor what's
[3576.08 - 3578.80] right for you
[3576.88 - 3580.08] what i love about zinc is zinc is this
[3578.80 - 3581.44] great thing where you can just take a
[3580.08 - 3583.12] little if you wanted to you can just
[3581.44 - 3584.84] take a few drops like three drops in
[3583.12 - 3588.88] some water
[3584.84 - 3588.88] right you can do
[3589.52 - 3595.92] and um and the other thing is
[3592.88 - 3596.56] um the other thing is with zinc which is
[3595.92 - 3598.48] interesting
[3596.56 - 3600.56] is i talk about flu cold and flu
[3598.48 - 3602.08] protocols and medical mediums and shock
[3600.56 - 3602.80] therapy check that out if you get a
[3602.08 - 3606.00] chance
[3602.80 - 3607.04] right there it's in there which is
[3606.00 - 3608.32] incredible
[3607.04 - 3610.16] zinc is the kind of thing where we're
[3608.32 - 3611.92] missing zinc in our bodies and zinc is
[3610.16 - 3614.24] one of those viral fighters it's
[3611.92 - 3614.80] pathogen fighters it runs our immune
[3614.24 - 3619.68] system
[3614.80 - 3622.24] it's critical z therapy works ernesto
[3619.68 - 3623.20] amazing it really does it's incredible
[3622.24 - 3625.76] what happens with
[3623.20 - 3626.88] with that so we did a little zinc so we
[3625.76 - 3629.28] got the
[3626.88 - 3631.04] and i do zinc separately a lot of times
[3629.28 - 3633.84] i just don't put it at all one thing
[3631.04 - 3635.36] can you put all these in one one shot
[3633.84 - 3636.72] glass yeah of course you can
[3635.36 - 3638.96] put all these in one shot glass if you
[3636.72 - 3639.92] want so let's go let's move forward a
[3638.96 - 3642.88] little bit more
[3639.92 - 3644.72] now every single day i try to get the
[3642.88 - 3646.56] heavy metal detox smoothie in me if i
[3644.72 - 3649.68] can
[3646.56 - 3652.80] some days i can't get an image
[3649.68 - 3654.16] because the day already went like the

[3662.48 - 3666.80] so what i'll do is i'll put a little
[3664.56 - 3670.48] spirulina
[3666.80 - 3674.24] right right in coconut water

[3683.84 - 3690.24] powder in there and i'll mix it up
[3686.40 - 3692.00] now later on throughout the day because

[3717.12 - 3722.96] so that's barley grass juice powder not
[3720.40 - 3724.72] barley grass there's a difference you
[3722.96 - 3726.08] can't get the metals out with barley
[3724.72 - 3729.68] grass so i'll put some
[3726.08 - 3729.68] wild blueberry powder in here okay
[3730.96 - 3733.60] so you're gonna be like well wait a
[3732.00 - 3736.24] minute that's not the heavy metal detox

[3742.16 - 3746.64] blueberry shots
[3743.76 - 3748.56] okay that's the other thing so this is
[3746.64 - 3751.44] something i do every single day
[3748.56 - 3753.36] is i'll take wild blueberry shots that's
[3751.44 - 3755.84] the wyman's
[3753.36 - 3755.84] um

[3765.68 - 3771.04] i'll do one or two shots three shots a
[3767.84 - 3772.48] day that's why blue bridges
[3771.04 - 3775.36] that's sure i'm going to spill it on my
[3772.48 - 3775.36] yellow shirt right now
[3776.08 - 3783.56] so that's what i do every single day
[3780.32 - 3786.64] it's at shopwymans.com so shop
[3783.56 - 3788.80] wymans.com i'm working with them by the
[3786.64 - 3788.80] way
[3790.00 - 3793.28] i am working with wyman's
[3794.48 - 3798.08] just so you know it's the only company
[3796.00 - 3801.12] here i'm working with
[3798.08 - 3804.16] because this is this
[3801.12 - 3806.08] i'm worried that you know that if i
[3804.16 - 3807.44] don't support them we could lose this
[3806.08 - 3808.64] product out there in the world and that
[3807.44 - 3811.84] would be a shame because this is an
[3808.64 - 3811.84] incredible product
[3811.92 - 3816.24] okay i mean traditional medicinals i
[3814.40 - 3817.84] don't need to work with them
[3816.24 - 3819.28] they've been like this for years they
[3817.84 - 3822.88] haven't changed anything
[3819.28 - 3824.64] for decades and and vimergy is keeping
[3822.88 - 3827.04] everything the same so
[3824.64 - 3828.72] but these guys here it's hard to make
[3827.04 - 3831.12] this stuff so i'm trying to
[3828.72 - 3832.88] i'm trying to get the word out so you
[3831.12 - 3836.80] know it keeps the stuff
[3832.88 - 3838.72] going it's so so critical all right so
[3836.80 - 3840.00] we're on to that a little bit so this
[3838.72 - 3842.08] this is
[3840.00 - 3843.52] my quick heavy metal detox smoothie i'll
[3842.08 - 3846.96] put it in coconut water
[3843.52 - 3850.80] i'll drink this at my desk right here
[3846.96 - 3852.00] so it's a spirulina the barley grass
[3850.80 - 3856.32] juice powder
[3852.00 - 3856.32] right in the coconut water okay
[3857.28 - 3862.16] and um i do the whole wild blueberries
[3860.16 - 3864.56] of course when i make the smoothie
[3862.16 - 3866.16] and i also do the juice every single day

[3900.08 - 3904.48] right here yeah i take celery for us
[3903.52 - 3908.00] before bed

[3908.00 - 3911.76] a leveler is what it is it gives you
[3910.56 - 3914.00] clarity
[3911.76 - 3914.88] right it always gives me clarity i run
[3914.00 - 3916.96] on it all day
[3914.88 - 3919.20] but i also take it before bed believe it
[3916.96 - 3922.72] or not so i'll do both
[3919.20 - 3925.84] it doesn't make you sleepy
[3922.72 - 3926.24] but it gives you a better sleep that's
[3925.84 - 3927.76] what
[3926.24 - 3930.08] that's what i discovered so i do the
[3927.76 - 3931.52] celery force it doesn't make you sleepy
[3930.08 - 3933.84] but it gives you a better sleep that's
[3931.52 - 3935.20] what i like right and what i also love
[3933.84 - 3937.04] about cellular pores when you take it
[3935.20 - 3939.84] the morning or take it during the day

[3941.28 - 3943.04] come he can do all the things he does
[3942.72 - 3944.48] and
[3943.04 - 3946.00] whatever and he's got high energy and
[3944.48 - 3947.44] stuff like that like i'm trying to keep

[3950.64 - 3953.28] something i take every day it helps it
[3952.16 - 3954.80] contributes to my
[3953.28 - 3956.40] high energy but i noticed that when i
[3954.80 - 3958.48] take it at night
[3956.40 - 3960.08] it gives me a better sleep which is
[3958.48 - 3961.84] which is great that's gaba right there

[3963.52 - 3968.72] melatonin i take every night for bed now
[3965.52 - 3970.48] dosage of melatonin if you are a

[4158.16 - 4163.12] i use a lot of honey you guys glucose to
[4161.60 - 4165.44] the brain
[4163.12 - 4168.64] is is really a good thing i'm going to
[4165.44 - 4168.64] talk about a lysine
[4171.28 - 4174.64] i'm assuming you guys are frozen out on
[4172.96 - 4176.64] facebook
[4174.64 - 4179.04] most likely that's where i'm heavily
[4176.64 - 4179.04] censored
[4179.68 - 4182.00] all right
[4184.64 - 4189.20] so i got the glutathione something i
[4186.72 - 4191.52] take every single day that's of energy
[4189.20 - 4193.28] defined which is incredible does your
[4191.52 - 4195.60] regular diet not provide
[4193.28 - 4197.60] all of these vitamins and minerals
[4195.60 - 4202.40] samantha it works like this
[4197.60 - 4203.68] is that regular diet is you can say
[4202.40 - 4206.40] regular diet for
[4203.68 - 4207.12] thousands of years if you want hundreds
[4206.40 - 4209.76] of years
[4207.12 - 4212.40] but what has changed what has changed in
[4209.76 - 4214.88] the last hundred years
[4212.40 - 4216.96] radiation floating through the sky
[4214.88 - 4218.24] nuclear waste in
[4216.96 - 4220.72] places you wouldn't even believe
[4218.24 - 4223.20] chemtrails dropping crap on us every day
[4220.72 - 4225.76] mercury and chemicals pathogens and
[4223.20 - 4227.28] toxins engineered viruses released into
[4225.76 - 4230.72] the environment to actually just
[4227.28 - 4233.28] destroy people um epstein bars and
[4230.72 - 4236.48] shingles viruses left and right
[4233.28 - 4238.80] mutations of different strep bacteria so
[4236.48 - 4241.44] is your regular diet was it was your
[4238.80 - 4244.48] regular diet prepared for
[4241.44 - 4246.08] the onslaught of horribleness that that
[4244.48 - 4247.36] is upon us
[4246.08 - 4248.80] is your regular diet it's a good
[4247.36 - 4249.76] question samantha though is your regular
[4248.80 - 4252.56] diet
[4249.76 - 4254.40] there to stop fragrances from actually
[4252.56 - 4257.12] destroying our brains
[4254.40 - 4257.60] perfumes colognes the toxicity levels of
[4257.12 - 4259.52] that
[4257.60 - 4261.52] fragrances you guys there's no there's
[4259.52 - 4263.60] no list of ingredients in fragrance
[4261.52 - 4265.12] they won't do that you know perfume you
[4263.60 - 4266.96] know you know what the list ingredients
[4265.12 - 4270.24] and perfume is
[4266.96 - 4273.36] perfume perfume

[4273.36 - 4277.28] of dangerous chemicals in it
[4274.72 - 4278.40] but they just put it under perfume
[4277.28 - 4280.48] everybody's always like
[4278.40 - 4282.32] well i'm looking at my skincare it has

[4289.36 - 4294.72] can't read the ingredients on a perfume
[4291.60 - 4297.76] or air freshener it's just fragrance
[4294.72 - 4300.80] it's under the term fragrance or perfume
[4297.76 - 4303.04] right in skincare fragrance is under the
[4300.80 - 4305.04] term perfume or fragrance
[4303.04 - 4306.40] right you can't you don't know how many
[4305.04 - 4309.60] hundreds of chemicals actually
[4306.40 - 4311.36] it's in cosmetics perfume and cosmetics

[4320.56 - 4324.08] stroke
[4321.76 - 4325.60] if you saw what was in there if you guys

[4329.44 - 4333.36] chemical companies that they won't show
[4331.28 - 4335.36] it's hidden so everybody's all into i'm
[4333.36 - 4336.16] into really good health i'm into
[4335.36 - 4339.16] healthcare
[4336.16 - 4340.64] i'm into skin care i'm into like
[4339.16 - 4343.36] environment

[4348.72 - 4350.96] with hundreds of dangerous chemicals are
[4350.32 - 4354.24] destroying
[4350.96 - 4356.96] like the earth the environment right
[4354.24 - 4358.64] and so anyway we weren't our regular
[4356.96 - 4361.84] diets aren't prepared for that
[4358.64 - 4364.00] our regular diets are prepared for the
[4361.84 - 4366.08] next onslaught of chemicals being
[4364.00 - 4368.48] you know churned out of a chemical
[4366.08 - 4370.80] factory put in perfumes and colognes
[4368.48 - 4371.60] put in air fresheners put in scented
[4370.80 - 4373.36] candles
[4371.60 - 4376.72] you won't see a scented candy you just
[4373.36 - 4379.20] see scented candles say fragrance
[4376.72 - 4380.40] fragrance beeswax yeah you'll see some
[4379.20 - 4382.00] other stuff in there but you won't see
[4380.40 - 4383.52] what the 100 chemicals are in the
[4382.00 - 4386.16] fragrance
[4383.52 - 4387.04] so regular diet doesn't take care of
[4386.16 - 4388.72] that i'm sorry
[4387.04 - 4390.16] the regular diet doesn't take care of
[4388.72 - 4393.44] that
[4390.16 - 4395.92] the regular diet does not cover the
[4393.44 - 4397.36] onslaught of poisons and chemicals and
[4395.92 - 4399.84] everything else you see how it works you
[4397.36 - 4402.32] guys so important to know right
[4399.84 - 4403.52] yeah sad that people make millions
[4402.32 - 4406.08] dollars poisoning people
[4403.52 - 4406.80] healthy liz they do they do it's it's
[4406.08 - 4408.00] incredible really
[4406.80 - 4409.68] so anyway so that's just some
[4408.00 - 4412.48] information today that look you guys
[4409.68 - 4415.20] lysine is something i take every day too
[4412.48 - 4416.56] there's a vegan epa i take right from
[4415.20 - 4417.36] vimergy it's the only one i trust i
[4416.56 - 4419.68] won't take one
[4417.36 - 4422.00] if they actually didn't have this i
[4419.68 - 4424.40] would never take an epa dha really
[4422.00 - 4426.16] anymore just none of them are up to snub
[4424.40 - 4427.92] to compare to this now
[4426.16 - 4430.08] and then the curcumin i take every
[4427.92 - 4431.52] single day as well so i take that one of
[4430.08 - 4433.52] emergency curcumin right
[4431.52 - 4435.84] so this is all the stuff i do and what
[4433.52 - 4438.96] do i do for dosages of curcumin
[4435.84 - 4441.04] every single day i'll take four capsules
[4438.96 - 4443.36] four capsules are curcumin every day
[4441.04 - 4445.92] that's what i do
[4443.36 - 4447.68] look don't like as i said before i gave
[4445.92 - 4450.00] you kind of a little disclaimer don't
[4447.68 - 4454.40] get overwhelmed at what i
[4450.00 - 4456.64] take i'm under immense pressure enormous
[4454.40 - 4460.96] enormous stress
[4456.64 - 4464.08] i'm putting out probably the the most
[4460.96 - 4466.72] comprehensive book i've ever put out
[4464.08 - 4468.00] in history in my history and in the
[4466.72 - 4470.56] history of natural medicine
[4468.00 - 4472.08] and conventional medicine too so you
[4470.56 - 4473.68] know i'm getting working on that
[4472.08 - 4475.52] and i got a lot of their stuff doing so
[4473.68 - 4476.88] i inputs my own personal life stuff
[4475.52 - 4478.48] which is you know
[4476.88 - 4480.72] stuff that happens in all of our lives
[4478.48 - 4481.12] that you know you can't avoid that's
[4480.72 - 4484.00] like
[4481.12 - 4485.52] just life right so with all of that
[4484.00 - 4486.56] meaning like every day you wake up and
[4485.52 - 4489.68] you have to do
[4486.56 - 4491.12] your chores and everything else right so
[4489.68 - 4493.60] the bottom line is
[4491.12 - 4495.04] uh don't get overwhelmed at how i take
[4493.60 - 4496.48] my supplements how i do it but i do the
[4495.04 - 4499.20] lemon shots lemon balm
[4496.48 - 4501.60] shots i do enough b12 it's critical
[4499.20 - 4504.16] right there i do the golden seal
[4501.60 - 4505.72] i do the wild blueberry shots every
[4504.16 - 4508.80] single day
[4505.72 - 4510.24] shopwymans.com this is all vemorgy.com
[4508.80 - 4511.92] the supplements here
[4510.24 - 4514.64] you get your you know traditional
[4511.92 - 4517.60] medicinals to find them
[4514.64 - 4518.64] in the store right but i do a lot of tea
[4517.60 - 4520.32] like i said you guys
[4518.64 - 4521.84] showed you that so this is this is a big
[4520.32 - 4523.60] part of it i do
[4521.84 - 4525.60] like i said the heavy metal detox goes
[4523.60 - 4527.20] in here a lot of times
[4525.60 - 4528.72] you know but i also have the cilantro on
[4527.20 - 4529.04] the same day i have the dolson the same
[4528.72 - 4530.48] day
[4529.04 - 4532.88] and i have the in the wild blueberry
[4530.48 - 4534.96] shot so i'm getting that a lot if i
[4532.88 - 4538.24] can't make the smoothie one day
[4534.96 - 4541.12] there's that and the vitamin c
[4538.24 - 4542.16] i take a lot i'll sometimes i'll take 10
[4541.12 - 4544.88] capsules
[4542.16 - 4546.72] three times a day of the microc
[4544.88 - 4548.48] especially if i'm concerned about being
[4546.72 - 4550.64] exposed concerned about anything like
[4548.48 - 4551.44] that if i feel like i've pushed myself
[4550.64 - 4554.08] to a limit
[4551.44 - 4555.84] the less sleep i get by working harder
[4554.08 - 4556.48] say i'll only give myself three hours of
[4555.84 - 4558.08] sleep
[4556.48 - 4559.60] like last night i only gave myself three
[4558.08 - 4561.12] and a half hours of sleep right
[4559.60 - 4562.88] so my three and a half hours of sleep
[4561.12 - 4563.60] i'm like i better take more vitamin c so
[4562.88 - 4567.20] i took
[4563.60 - 4569.76] 10 capsules of vitamin c is what i did
[4567.20 - 4573.12] the microc the best one there is that's
[4569.76 - 4575.20] the best seed there is anyway
[4573.12 - 4576.32] guys i'm heading off to ig i think we
[4575.20 - 4579.68] covered
[4576.32 - 4583.68] a good portion of what i take in a day
[4579.68 - 4587.04] and but we're going to be doing another
[4583.68 - 4589.52] live on immune system so maybe
[4587.04 - 4591.20] in like a couple days or something like
[4589.52 - 4592.96] that we'll do an immune system one then
[4591.20 - 4594.40] we're gonna do or a baseline one what's
[4592.96 - 4595.84] a good baseline because this is
[4594.40 - 4598.32] everything i take in a day
[4595.84 - 4599.36] but what's a good baseline for someone
[4598.32 - 4601.28] you know like
[4599.36 - 4602.96] what's the definite baseline for
[4601.28 - 4606.24] somebody and they can work from there
[4602.96 - 4609.28] so that'll probably be the next
