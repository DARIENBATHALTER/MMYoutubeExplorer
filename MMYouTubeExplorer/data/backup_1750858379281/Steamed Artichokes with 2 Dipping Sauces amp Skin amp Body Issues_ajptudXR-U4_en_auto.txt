[229.36 - 233.12] incredible incredible
[233.52 - 239.60] someone said ljax said
[236.72 - 242.00] what the heck is ayahuasca something you

[242.00 - 246.48] um yeah aren't those big aren't these
[243.92 - 248.80] aren't these big
[246.48 - 249.92] incredible so let's get going you guys i
[248.80 - 251.04] want to i want to show you guys
[249.92 - 254.56] everything here
[251.04 - 257.28] um so
[254.56 - 258.96] to start with these things are finishing
[257.28 - 261.12] up so we'll just give them a couple more
[258.96 - 264.32] minutes i'm going to turn down the heat
[261.12 - 265.60] get this to chill out turn it down
[264.32 - 266.80] and then i'm going to get them out and
[265.60 - 269.04] we're going to plate them up we're going
[266.80 - 272.56] to make some dipping sauces
[269.04 - 274.56] but let me show you what i did
[272.56 - 276.32] see these got the long stems and i
[274.56 - 276.88] noticed that sometimes in the grocery
[276.32 - 279.92] store
[276.88 - 280.24] you'll see them with short stems so when
[279.92 - 282.16] they
[280.24 - 284.24] when they prepped them for the grocery
[282.16 - 288.08] store they cut the stem off now
[284.24 - 290.24] the the longer the stem
[288.08 - 292.16] so if you after you steam it if you eat
[290.24 - 293.36] it all the way down to the lower stem
[292.16 - 296.56] it's really bitter
[293.36 - 298.88] so down here about right here
[296.56 - 301.28] this inch inch and a half you guys is a
[298.88 - 303.52] really better section
[301.28 - 306.24] now i like to what i like to do
[303.52 - 308.88] sometimes is even though it's bitter
[306.24 - 310.32] okay even though it's better i do like
[308.88 - 312.80] to
[310.32 - 314.64] looking for my uh knife i do like to
[312.80 - 315.92] peel this back a little bit like this
[314.64 - 318.48] sometimes
[315.92 - 320.40] and because i don't like to waste it i
[318.48 - 322.84] still like to eat the stem
[320.40 - 324.08] first of all artichokes are really
[322.84 - 326.80] expensive
[324.08 - 328.08] these are organic ones okay but you'll
[326.80 - 330.24] see what i'll do i'll show you what i
[328.08 - 333.44] just did right now
[330.24 - 335.52] just so you know so i just peeled back
[333.44 - 336.88] that stem here because that's the rough
[335.52 - 339.52] part is
[336.88 - 341.12] this the skin on the stem that's edible
[339.52 - 343.60] all this right
[341.12 - 345.28] just cut a little piece of this off but
[343.60 - 345.76] it gets a little bitter down here at the
[345.28 - 347.52] end
[345.76 - 348.88] but still i just love it i mean i love
[347.52 - 350.40] the artichoke heart
[348.88 - 352.96] this attaches to the heart of the
[350.40 - 354.64] artichoke so it's attached
[352.96 - 356.24] which is you know and so you you know
[354.64 - 359.44] but it's tastier up
[356.24 - 361.20] higher up about here in the stem i mean
[359.44 - 363.92] right about here sorry about that
[361.20 - 366.00] so just want to show you so i'm just
[363.92 - 367.60] prepping this artichoke
[366.00 - 369.52] these are almost done if you just got on
[367.60 - 371.28] here so i'm making steamed artichokes
[369.52 - 372.80] with two dipping sauces mustard dipping
[371.28 - 375.12] sauce zucchini dipping sauce
[372.80 - 376.64] mustard maple dipping sauce i have the
[375.12 - 379.04] maple syrup right here
[376.64 - 380.24] it's in this little tray and the
[379.04 - 382.16] zucchini herb
[380.24 - 384.64] dipping sauce which i got some zucchinis
[382.16 - 384.64] right here
[384.80 - 389.52] so what i like to do is cut the top a
[387.76 - 390.88] little bit back so i'd like to cut the
[389.52 - 392.96] top off a little bit
[390.88 - 394.40] so all these pieces so i'll take the
[392.96 - 397.04] knife okay
[394.40 - 398.00] you guys see this and i like to cut the
[397.04 - 401.84] top off
[398.00 - 404.96] so just like this okay
[401.84 - 404.96] let me just get rid of these
[407.12 - 409.84] so now i have that
[410.88 - 415.04] so now you can steam them whole the
[414.08 - 418.24] recipe
[415.04 - 420.64] calls for steaming them whole right so
[418.24 - 421.36] in this pot right here they're just
[420.64 - 424.48] about done
[421.36 - 426.16] i turned down the heat there
[424.48 - 427.60] there's a couple of whole ones just like
[426.16 - 431.36] that but i cut one in
[427.60 - 434.32] half too and i'll show you that
[431.36 - 436.08] but that one's prepped now let me cut it
[434.32 - 438.40] in half too
[436.08 - 440.00] all right so because i want to show you
[438.40 - 441.76] the inside because you can cut them in
[440.00 - 444.16] half if you really want to
[441.76 - 445.44] and i'll do that that's next let me do
[444.16 - 448.64] that here so i'm going to
[445.44 - 451.84] send this knife through now these are
[448.64 - 451.84] tough to cut sometimes
[454.40 - 459.60] all right that's the inside okay
[457.60 - 461.12] you got a couple of options you can take
[459.60 - 464.32] a spoon and get this
[461.12 - 465.84] furry stuff out which is like the seed
[464.32 - 468.80] pulp inside this
[465.84 - 470.24] that's the furry a little fur that's
[468.80 - 471.84] going on in the center you can actually
[470.24 - 473.20] scoop that out
[471.84 - 478.08] and you can take it out after it's
[473.20 - 481.44] cooked as well
[478.08 - 481.44] so move these over
[482.00 - 485.84] so i want to answer some questions too
[483.44 - 487.52] as we're making these
[485.84 - 490.84] i'm going to lift up the lid these are
[487.52 - 495.04] done first time growing artichokes
[490.84 - 495.04] amazing that's so great
[496.08 - 500.16] so take the lid off
[500.96 - 504.24] these are going to be really hot
[504.40 - 511.12] lucy lou hey how are you doing
[508.80 - 514.40] good to see you're here the comments go
[511.12 - 514.40] up and i can't catch him in time

[520.00 - 525.52] separate dermatitis i need advice please
[523.84 - 527.20] it's all about the liver chelsea when it
[525.52 - 529.60] comes down to dermatitis so it's all
[527.20 - 533.44] about the liver and you're in luck

[533.44 - 537.44] healing liver food it just is this is an

[547.20 - 551.12] you're healing your liver
[548.56 - 551.60] you're healing your skin that's the key
[551.12 - 554.96] so
[551.60 - 558.96] dermatitis stagnant sluggish
[554.96 - 562.00] liver filled with lots of toxins and
[558.96 - 562.48] this meal has no fat in it so this is a
[562.00 - 565.28] no
[562.48 - 566.88] fat meal there's no oils in this meal
[565.28 - 568.16] and i'm saying this for a reason because
[566.88 - 570.08] i'm talking about your liver and
[568.16 - 571.12] dermatitis you want to get dermatitis
[570.08 - 573.44] better
[571.12 - 575.04] you got to get off the fats or lower the
[573.44 - 576.64] fats or reduce them
[575.04 - 577.84] so you don't see oils in this meal and
[576.64 - 578.64] you're not gonna see nut butters you're
[577.84 - 581.04] not gonna see
[578.64 - 581.76] avocado you're not gonna see pork fat in
[581.04 - 583.20] this meal
[581.76 - 585.20] you're not gonna see chicken fat in this
[583.20 - 587.76] meal you're not gonna see
[585.20 - 589.60] corn oil vegetable oil you know you're
[587.76 - 590.80] not gonna see anything canola oil you're
[589.60 - 593.36] not going to see
[590.80 - 594.56] grease you're just not going to see any
[593.36 - 597.04] of that in this meal
[594.56 - 598.08] and that right there is the key to
[597.04 - 600.56] getting the liver
[598.08 - 601.68] better is i want to show you guys always
[600.56 - 606.00] show you guys these
[601.68 - 608.64] low fat to no fat actually no fat meals
[606.00 - 609.52] and because what happens is every time
[608.64 - 612.00] you're eating fat
[609.52 - 613.52] your liver has to spill out a lifetime
[612.00 - 615.68] of bile reserves
[613.52 - 617.52] to break down the fat to try to thin it
[615.68 - 620.72] out to save your life
[617.52 - 622.00] to save your life and i'll talk about
[620.72 - 624.40] what that fat does
[622.00 - 625.68] it builds up into your arteries it
[624.40 - 627.68] becomes the plaque
[625.68 - 629.12] in your arteries science research
[627.68 - 631.28] doesn't know that
[629.12 - 632.48] they just don't know that which is
[631.28 - 634.88] interesting right
[632.48 - 637.36] so the whole point about these meals is
[634.88 - 639.04] about reducing that fat or eliminating
[637.36 - 640.96] the fat at least a little bit
[639.04 - 642.64] in your life like a moment in your life
[640.96 - 644.64] like whether it's a cleanse
[642.64 - 646.56] whether it's a 20-day cleanse i mean you
[644.64 - 649.52] guys should check the book out
[646.56 - 651.68] it's on amazon you know get it so you
[649.52 - 652.40] got this information but like the 28 day
[651.68 - 654.40] cleanse you'll see
[652.40 - 655.84] there won't be any fats in there so
[654.40 - 657.84] that's important i mean unless you want
[655.84 - 660.32] to stick a little bit of avocado in
[657.84 - 662.08] something or something but i recommend
[660.32 - 664.08] trying to have a moment in your life to
[662.08 - 666.40] have the fats out of there so
[664.08 - 668.00] you can get rid of the dermatitis get
[666.40 - 669.76] rid of your skin problems
[668.00 - 672.40] help get rid of your acne help get rid
[669.76 - 675.04] of your eczema psoriasis vitiligo
[672.40 - 676.08] because your liver is killing itself
[675.04 - 678.24] every time you dump
[676.08 - 680.56] fat in there like a whole bunch of oil
[678.24 - 682.08] and grease and too much animal protein
[680.56 - 683.04] and i'm not against animal protein i'm
[682.08 - 685.52] not against plant
[683.04 - 686.80] plant fat either and plant protein
[685.52 - 688.08] people but
[686.80 - 689.60] the whole point is is that when you're
[688.08 - 691.12] dumping in all that fat your liver is
[689.60 - 693.92] killing itself
[691.12 - 694.24] to actually thin out the blood that's
[693.92 - 697.28] what
[694.24 - 698.88] biles for bile is released to try to
[697.28 - 701.20] always save your butt
[698.88 - 702.88] and to break down that fat so it thins
[701.20 - 705.36] it out to get it either out of your
[702.88 - 707.76] system someday somehow some way right
[705.36 - 708.80] and that's one thing and then the other
[707.76 - 710.96] thing is adrenals
[708.80 - 712.80] every time you're eating fat your
[710.96 - 714.88] adrenals are pumping
[712.80 - 716.40] because you're you need adrenaline to
[714.88 - 719.04] thin out your blood
[716.40 - 720.56] so oxygen can go to your brain so your
[719.04 - 722.40] brain sends them it's the minute you eat
[720.56 - 724.00] all this fat
[722.40 - 726.08] and many eat all this avocado and
[724.00 - 727.28] avocados a healthy fat i get it but if
[726.08 - 729.20] you're eating it every day and then
[727.28 - 730.48] you're having chicken for dinner and you
[729.20 - 733.04] had avocado toast for
[730.48 - 734.16] for breakfast you had something for
[733.04 - 736.24] lunch oil
[734.16 - 737.76] on your food for lunch oil on your salad
[736.24 - 739.20] for lunch chicken salad or whatever
[737.76 - 741.52] you're doing tuna fish
[739.20 - 743.60] you get all this fat in there and then
[741.52 - 745.44] your adrenals are running all day to try
[743.60 - 747.76] to thin out the blood
[745.44 - 748.80] to disperse the fat in your bloodstream
[747.76 - 751.84] your brain
[748.80 - 754.40] tells your adrenals i need adrenaline
[751.84 - 755.92] fast you have to thin out the blood or
[754.40 - 759.68] you're going to kill me the brain
[755.92 - 760.88] and you're going to kill me the heart so
[759.68 - 763.12] that's how it works so i'm trying to
[760.88 - 765.12] give you guys a chance to heal and when
[763.12 - 767.12] your liver gets stagnant and sluggish
[765.12 - 769.36] guess what you've got that dermatitis
[767.12 - 771.60] coming on you've got stuff coming on
[769.36 - 773.60] you get that rosacea coming on all of it
[771.60 - 775.20] and look i talk about the stuff
[773.60 - 777.76] you know cleanse the heel you can take a
[775.20 - 778.40] look at that liver rescues another great
[777.76 - 781.60] book
[778.40 - 784.84] information on this so cleanse the heel
[781.60 - 787.84] and then of course liver rescue right
[784.84 - 787.84] here
[787.92 - 792.96] but yeah guys so
[791.60 - 794.56] and then what happens your liver gets
[792.96 - 795.60] stagnant your liver gets sluggish and
[794.56 - 798.84] you end up getting
[795.60 - 800.00] the sun spots so now it's sunspot time
[798.84 - 801.84] right
[800.00 - 803.92] you know that's another thing too and
[801.84 - 806.16] then if you're jacked up on caffeine all
[803.92 - 807.92] day you really get those sunspots
[806.16 - 809.20] like really get them you know because
[807.92 - 812.08] the liver is going into
[809.20 - 813.76] overdrive trying to absorb all that
[812.08 - 814.72] adrenaline all the time and that's
[813.76 - 816.16] another thing too
[814.72 - 818.00] we're eating all these fats your liver
[816.16 - 819.60] is killing itself to break down the fats
[818.00 - 821.52] your adrenals are killing themselves to
[819.60 - 822.88] release adrenaline to break down the fat
[821.52 - 824.64] to thin out your blood
[822.88 - 826.64] and then your liver has to do this
[824.64 - 827.60] massive cleanup it has to suck in all
[826.64 - 830.72] the fat that it
[827.60 - 832.40] that it can't disperse and and it has to
[830.72 - 833.28] suck in all this fat so you get the
[832.40 - 834.88] fatty liver
[833.28 - 837.20] and then you get the dermatitis you get
[834.88 - 840.08] all kinds of problems you get the gout
[837.20 - 841.44] you get i mean everything goes wrong and
[840.08 - 841.92] and your liver is killing itself to
[841.44 - 843.52] absorb
[841.92 - 845.04] all that adrenaline it's killing itself
[843.52 - 847.20] to absorb all that fat and then we just
[845.04 - 857.84] get in trouble right there
[847.20 - 857.84] gail says liver rescue yeah
[859.92 - 866.80] so i mean seriously i mean
[862.96 - 866.80] it's important to know it really is
[867.44 - 872.80] so um let's keep on working on this
[871.04 - 874.32] i'm excited you guys lots to talk about
[872.80 - 875.76] thanks for everybody coming on being
[874.32 - 877.12] here if you guys just came on here we're
[875.76 - 878.48] about to get started
[877.12 - 880.48] we're kind of moving through just just
[878.48 - 883.76] covering a couple questions
[880.48 - 884.88] um so that's important and let's talk
[883.76 - 886.96] about what we're making steamed
[884.88 - 888.88] artichokes which is a real healing food
[886.96 - 890.40] and i want you guys to have the healing
[888.88 - 892.72] foods right
[890.40 - 895.52] everything you put in your body i just
[892.72 - 898.72] saw geographical tongue that's liver
[895.52 - 900.96] ella that's the liver right there so
[898.72 - 903.04] just know i mean it's time to get the
[900.96 - 905.36] liver healthier that's what geographical
[903.04 - 906.08] that's what the geographical tongue is
[905.36 - 908.64] that is
[906.08 - 909.52] a liver that's heating up way too much
[908.64 - 912.08] because it's
[909.52 - 914.08] overloaded with toxins and poisons and
[912.08 - 914.80] eventually what comes after geographical
[914.08 - 916.96] tongue
[914.80 - 919.12] comes after it is weight gain sometimes
[916.96 - 920.08] during it sometimes before it but after
[919.12 - 923.76] it can come out
[920.08 - 925.68] you know so got to get that liver better
[923.76 - 928.32] it's important gail you're reading
[925.68 - 932.32] liverescue now so awesome awesome
[928.32 - 934.40] um rebecca does the body need fat
[932.32 - 935.68] the body gets fat from every single food
[934.40 - 939.52] there is so
[935.68 - 943.04] the body does need traces
[939.52 - 944.96] of fat but that's traces and guess what
[943.04 - 946.48] it's in all your food there's fat and
[944.96 - 948.96] artichokes
[946.48 - 950.08] there's fat and potatoes there's fat and
[948.96 - 952.32] bananas
[950.08 - 953.52] there's fat and butter leaf lettuce
[952.32 - 955.60] there's fat in fruit
[953.52 - 957.04] mangoes there's fat in every vegetable
[955.60 - 961.12] broccoli has fat in it
[957.04 - 964.56] broccoli green beans have fat in it um
[961.12 - 966.64] so you know that's every single food you
[964.56 - 969.28] eat an apple has fat in it
[966.64 - 970.88] an apple has fat in it so we already got
[969.28 - 973.60] the fats in those foods
[970.88 - 974.96] so technically you're not fat free on
[973.60 - 976.72] any of these meals because there's
[974.96 - 978.48] traces of omega-3s
[976.72 - 979.92] in these foods there's traces of
[978.48 - 982.08] omega-3s
[979.92 - 984.08] six and nines in these foods right here
[982.08 - 986.64] so we get that there
[984.08 - 988.80] and it's okay to do avocado it's okay to
[986.64 - 991.68] do some nut butters it's okay to do
[988.80 - 993.52] um hemp seeds and and sesame seeds and
[991.68 - 994.32] have some of that but that's not what we
[993.52 - 997.04] do
[994.32 - 997.60] that's not what we do here's what we do
[997.04 - 999.68] it's
[997.60 - 1001.20] we fat ourselves to death that's all we
[999.68 - 1003.04] do that's what we've been taught
[1001.20 - 1005.76] you just fat yourself to death that's
[1003.04 - 1008.40] what we're taught it's fats all day long
[1005.76 - 1008.80] all day long tuna salad for lunch eggs
[1008.40 - 1011.52] for
[1008.80 - 1012.72] fat everywhere cheese milk cheese butter
[1011.52 - 1014.32] oils
[1012.72 - 1015.76] okay sure you're doing healthy fat
[1014.32 - 1017.68] you're doing some avocado
[1015.76 - 1019.52] for one minute you're doing avocado yeah
[1017.68 - 1021.44] you got a healthy fat but your body's
[1019.52 - 1023.36] already like whoa healthy or not just
[1021.44 - 1025.92] slow that stuff down
[1023.36 - 1027.60] because you do an avocado toasted you're
[1025.92 - 1029.68] throwing peanut butter in your smoothie
[1027.60 - 1030.96] then you're doing chocolate cacao
[1029.68 - 1033.84] straight fat
[1030.96 - 1035.04] then it's like it doesn't stop so okay
[1033.84 - 1038.00] are fats good for me
[1035.04 - 1040.08] are they good for my body well some but
[1038.00 - 1041.52] there's no such thing as any moderation
[1040.08 - 1043.68] and there's no such thing as anything
[1041.52 - 1044.24] being balanced all it is is fat all day
[1043.68 - 1046.48] long
[1044.24 - 1047.84] no moderation no balance no nothing
[1046.48 - 1049.84] everybody's choking
[1047.84 - 1050.88] that fat down they're just sending it
[1049.84 - 1054.40] down send it down
[1050.88 - 1057.28] sucking it down and it's nonstop
[1054.40 - 1058.72] so unless someone decides intermittent
[1057.28 - 1059.92] fast and the only reason why they
[1058.72 - 1062.40] intermittent fast
[1059.92 - 1064.32] is because it's by hit and miss it's
[1062.40 - 1065.04] because someone accidentally one day
[1064.32 - 1067.44] discovered
[1065.04 - 1068.40] that if they don't eat all this food in
[1067.44 - 1070.88] the morning
[1068.40 - 1072.64] they start to feel a little better but
[1070.88 - 1074.64] what they don't know
[1072.64 - 1075.84] is they're not eating fats in the
[1074.64 - 1078.32] morning anymore they're
[1075.84 - 1079.12] actually holding back the fats they
[1078.32 - 1081.36] don't even know it
[1079.12 - 1083.44] intermittent so-called intermittent
[1081.36 - 1085.60] fasting experts don't even know why
[1083.44 - 1086.88] anybody starts to even feel better
[1085.60 - 1088.08] when they intermittent fast and it
[1086.88 - 1088.80] doesn't even mean it's the right thing
[1088.08 - 1090.40] to do
[1088.80 - 1092.40] because you're really supposed to have
[1090.40 - 1092.88] fuel no matter what during your morning
[1092.40 - 1095.60] and day
[1092.88 - 1097.28] so you don't burn out your adrenals but
[1095.60 - 1098.80] in intermittent fasting experts or
[1097.28 - 1100.88] whoever they are
[1098.80 - 1102.24] they don't even know that they're just
[1100.88 - 1103.68] all like
[1102.24 - 1105.92] they're just all like oh you're burning
[1103.68 - 1106.80] fat you're burning fat you're burning up
[1105.92 - 1108.40] carbs
[1106.80 - 1110.08] you're not eating in the morning your
[1108.40 - 1111.28] digestion is getting a little stronger i
[1110.08 - 1112.64] mean that's pretty much as far as it
[1111.28 - 1113.52] goes with them they don't know anything
[1112.64 - 1116.32] else
[1113.52 - 1117.68] and but what's happening is when you
[1116.32 - 1120.24] when you're holding off
[1117.68 - 1121.28] all that fat in the morning your liver
[1120.24 - 1123.36] starts to bounce back
[1121.28 - 1124.88] nobody knows that but your liver starts
[1123.36 - 1127.76] to bounce back
[1124.88 - 1129.44] and that's what happens so are we
[1127.76 - 1130.96] getting any fats yeah we're getting fat
[1129.44 - 1132.80] so getting them in the artichokes that i
[1130.96 - 1135.92] got right here i'm about to plate up
[1132.80 - 1136.48] we get them we get them in every food we
[1135.92 - 1138.48] eat
[1136.48 - 1140.00] and yeah if you want to have some sesame
[1138.48 - 1142.00] tahini yeah if you want to have a little
[1140.00 - 1144.40] peanut butter a little almond butter
[1142.00 - 1146.40] yeah if you want to have some hemp seeds
[1144.40 - 1149.44] a little avocado or something
[1146.40 - 1151.44] but we don't do that we don't have a
[1149.44 - 1152.96] little bit of sesame tahini we don't
[1151.44 - 1156.32] have a little bit of
[1152.96 - 1159.20] peanut butter we have tablespoons of it
[1156.32 - 1160.48] all week long on top of the fact we have
[1159.20 - 1161.84] chicken for dinner
[1160.48 - 1162.88] whether you're vegan plant-based if
[1161.84 - 1164.08] you're vegan you're still going to do
[1162.88 - 1167.04] all these oils
[1164.08 - 1168.00] on top of drowning things with olive oil
[1167.04 - 1169.36] eggs
[1168.00 - 1170.64] eggs are filled with fat that's what
[1169.36 - 1171.36] they are i mean that's the whole point
[1170.64 - 1175.44] it's
[1171.36 - 1176.96] it's like we don't do anything but fat
[1175.44 - 1178.48] no one's like i'll just eat that piece
[1176.96 - 1179.04] of fruit and some greens i'm good for
[1178.48 - 1181.28] now
[1179.04 - 1182.48] are you kidding no one's doing that
[1181.28 - 1185.36] nobody's doing that
[1182.48 - 1186.64] it doesn't exist so it's and if it does
[1185.36 - 1188.24] it's from
[1186.64 - 1190.16] from medical medium information teaching
[1188.24 - 1192.56] people for 35 years if it does exist
[1190.16 - 1194.64] so it's because they never did it before
[1192.56 - 1196.64] i got into the health scene 35 years ago
[1194.64 - 1198.48] it was fat fat fat fat and it's still
[1196.64 - 1200.48] fat fat fat today
[1198.48 - 1201.92] and the dairy products straight fat
[1200.48 - 1204.32] kefir
[1201.92 - 1205.36] milk goat's milk sheep's milk sheep's
[1204.32 - 1206.80] cheese goat's cheese
[1205.36 - 1208.56] oh i'm on goat's cheese i'm not eating
[1206.80 - 1210.08] any fat what
[1208.56 - 1211.76] that's a head scratcher to me right
[1210.08 - 1213.84] there are you kidding
[1211.76 - 1214.88] and so it's all about just fatting
[1213.84 - 1216.80] ourselves to death
[1214.88 - 1218.40] boom just that's we're killing ourselves
[1216.80 - 1219.84] let's just kill ourselves
[1218.40 - 1221.52] because pretty much that's what it is
[1219.84 - 1223.92] but it's a slow death
[1221.52 - 1225.60] that's what it is we fat ourselves to a
[1223.92 - 1226.88] slow death and then eventually
[1225.60 - 1230.32] and here's the thing here's the sad
[1226.88 - 1232.32] thing that plaque in our arteries
[1230.32 - 1234.40] you know what it's made out of it's not
[1232.32 - 1235.44] made out of cholesterol that's that's
[1234.40 - 1237.84] how that's how
[1235.44 - 1239.20] science of research is so off the mark
[1237.84 - 1241.04] they're off the mark on all chronic
[1239.20 - 1243.52] illness they're off the market 90
[1241.04 - 1244.64] 99 of all chronic illness are off the
[1243.52 - 1247.44] mark
[1244.64 - 1248.16] and i'm not talking about the robots
[1247.44 - 1249.84] they create
[1248.16 - 1251.36] that science creates to to get an
[1249.84 - 1252.00] aneurysm out of somebody's brain when i
[1251.36 - 1254.32] talk to a
[1252.00 - 1255.20] neurosurgeon that's amazing but that's
[1254.32 - 1256.40] what i'm talking about i'm talking about
[1255.20 - 1257.12] chronic illness i'm talking about
[1256.40 - 1258.56] everybody else
[1257.12 - 1260.08] everybody the whole world who's sick
[1258.56 - 1261.44] with symptoms science research doesn't
[1260.08 - 1264.00] know why anybody's sick
[1261.44 - 1264.88] so and plaque in the arteries that's
[1264.00 - 1268.00] from fat
[1264.88 - 1271.12] and toxins combined congealed
[1268.00 - 1272.72] that's from fat in your system running
[1271.12 - 1275.76] through the pipes
[1272.72 - 1278.80] you gotta you gotta see your system as
[1275.76 - 1280.64] pipes right and what's running through
[1278.80 - 1282.64] those pipes is fat let me just have this
[1280.64 - 1284.40] avocado right here that's some fat let
[1282.64 - 1286.96] me have some more nut butter in here
[1284.40 - 1288.08] let me have chicken and put some olive
[1286.96 - 1290.16] oil on that chicken
[1288.08 - 1291.76] let me have some salmon and make sure i
[1290.16 - 1295.68] cook it in olive oil
[1291.76 - 1299.04] make sure i keep on doing all that and
[1295.68 - 1300.96] what happens is and it would have
[1299.04 - 1302.88] a look let's do more coconut oil let's
[1300.96 - 1304.64] do more more coconut butter
[1302.88 - 1305.92] let's do ghee let's do whatever we can
[1304.64 - 1307.84] find and
[1305.92 - 1309.48] what we're doing is we're running fat
[1307.84 - 1312.64] through our pipeline
[1309.48 - 1314.16] non-stop running pipe fat through our
[1312.64 - 1318.16] pipeline
[1314.16 - 1318.72] and it and because of that that fat is
[1318.16 - 1322.08] also
[1318.72 - 1324.00] toxin soluble so the more
[1322.08 - 1325.84] fat that you got running through you the
[1324.00 - 1328.40] more fat that's in our bodies
[1325.84 - 1330.16] the more toxins absorb into those fat
[1328.40 - 1332.56] cells fat cells absorb
[1330.16 - 1333.60] pesticides herbicides fungicides
[1332.56 - 1335.52] petrochemicals
[1333.60 - 1337.60] colognes perfumes scented candles

[1406.00 - 1410.64] that's what it is
[1407.12 - 1413.84] it's all counter sensibility
[1410.64 - 1417.04] it's counselor it's counter sensible
[1413.84 - 1417.44] it's counter common sense it's stupidity
[1417.04 - 1420.56] at its
[1417.44 - 1423.28] highest you guys and
[1420.56 - 1424.80] and it's like it's it's unbelievable
[1423.28 - 1427.80] it's unbelievable
[1424.80 - 1429.20] and it's counter intuition it's
[1427.80 - 1432.40] unintuition they
[1429.20 - 1432.80] unintuit you everybody is unintuiting
[1432.40 - 1434.96] you
[1432.80 - 1435.84] you just get all your intuition robbed
[1434.96 - 1438.32] and stolen
[1435.84 - 1438.96] and theft it you guys have no intuition
[1438.32 - 1441.20] left
[1438.96 - 1442.72] sounds like an insult but it's just a
[1441.20 - 1444.80] fact what happens is
[1442.72 - 1446.08] because every time i talk to people the
[1444.80 - 1447.52] most intuitive people in the world they
[1446.08 - 1449.20] tell me the most intuitive people in the
[1447.52 - 1450.40] world do all their spiritual practices
[1449.20 - 1450.96] they're sitting down they're doing all
[1450.40 - 1452.48] their prayers
[1450.96 - 1454.48] they're doing all their meditations and
[1452.48 - 1455.28] then i hear they're like burning scented
[1454.48 - 1457.52] candles
[1455.28 - 1458.80] and they're pouring fat on their food
[1457.52 - 1460.96] your intuition
[1458.80 - 1463.36] your heart and your brain and your your
[1460.96 - 1465.28] body's your body doesn't want all that
[1463.36 - 1466.64] fat going in there to kill you
[1465.28 - 1468.32] and your body doesn't want all that
[1466.64 - 1469.44] caffeine going in there to kill you and
[1468.32 - 1471.36] all those chemicals so
[1469.44 - 1473.36] whose intuition are we talking about i
[1471.36 - 1475.28] want to know like someone please tell me
[1473.36 - 1478.40] whose intuition's working
[1475.28 - 1478.64] because every day all day long all i see
[1478.40 - 1480.24] is
[1478.64 - 1481.52] doctors and practitioners and healers
[1480.24 - 1482.00] and everybody else and their intuition
[1481.52 - 1484.72] is
[1482.00 - 1486.24] in the garbage it's in the garbage bin
[1484.72 - 1487.84] because they're not using it i guess
[1486.24 - 1490.00] everybody's born with it and then it's
[1487.84 - 1491.44] stolen from us by the caffeine industry
[1490.00 - 1492.96] and by the chemical industry and by
[1491.44 - 1494.80] every other industry and it's stolen
[1492.96 - 1496.64] by the health industry big pharma
[1494.80 - 1499.76] soldiers did they steal
[1496.64 - 1502.16] our intuition it's it's unbelievable
[1499.76 - 1504.00] it's actually it's actually unbelievable
[1502.16 - 1507.20] when you think about it
[1504.00 - 1508.48] um jody says for me eaters what's the
[1507.20 - 1512.08] healthiest meat to eat
[1508.48 - 1515.20] lamb beef chicken seafood kangaroo
[1512.08 - 1517.76] believe it or not fish is still
[1515.20 - 1518.48] the healthiest okay so it'd be like
[1517.76 - 1521.04] trout
[1518.48 - 1522.80] be like salmon sardines right there so
[1521.04 - 1525.28] if you're into animal proteins
[1522.80 - 1526.40] you're better off having trout salmon
[1525.28 - 1528.64] sardines
[1526.40 - 1530.40] haddock that's another one right there
[1528.64 - 1532.56] so haddock sardines
[1530.40 - 1535.44] salmon you know get a hold of some
[1532.56 - 1537.76] mackerel that could be a possibility
[1535.44 - 1539.68] um i'll give you the most unhealthiest
[1537.76 - 1542.16] okay and healthiest of all if you're an
[1539.68 - 1545.36] animal protein person
[1542.16 - 1545.84] pork keep it out never have it stay away
[1545.36 - 1547.76] from it
[1545.84 - 1549.68] it'll kill you fast it'll age you faster
[1547.76 - 1551.60] too it's so high in fat
[1549.68 - 1553.52] that will cling into your arteries and
[1551.60 - 1555.36] it's all fun and dandy when you're 22
[1553.52 - 1557.52] years old when you're 25 years old 28
[1555.36 - 1559.04] years old you know it's it's
[1557.52 - 1560.64] it i get it you know we're all
[1559.04 - 1561.44] indestructible when we're 25 we're
[1560.64 - 1563.36] indestructible
[1561.44 - 1565.68] you know what i mean and but man when
[1563.36 - 1567.60] you're 60 and you're like wait a minute
[1565.68 - 1569.52] what i got to get a double triple heart
[1567.60 - 1570.88] surgery what do i need to do i got to
[1569.52 - 1572.40] get two valves done i have to get a
[1570.88 - 1575.28] stint put in a shunt put in
[1572.40 - 1576.56] wait a minute what do i got to do and
[1575.28 - 1577.36] and then you're laying on the table and
[1576.56 - 1579.60] they got to run them
[1577.36 - 1581.76] they got to run a scope they got to run
[1579.60 - 1583.60] a scope through your leg
[1581.76 - 1584.80] up through your arteries and veins and
[1583.60 - 1586.16] they gotta think and then they gotta
[1584.80 - 1586.88] find out where your arteries are
[1586.16 - 1588.80] collapsing
[1586.88 - 1590.80] because of all that pork fat and then
[1588.80 - 1592.80] they gotta shove a stint in there
[1590.80 - 1594.48] it just is no fun but when you're 20 and
[1592.80 - 1595.92] you're exercising and you're on this
[1594.48 - 1597.60] this keto diet and you think you've
[1595.92 - 1599.44] learned everything about health
[1597.60 - 1601.28] i noticed is everybody's a health expert
[1599.44 - 1602.96] now like every 25 year old's a health
[1601.28 - 1604.48] expert it's just unbelievable because
[1602.96 - 1606.72] they went keto
[1604.48 - 1608.56] and lamb might be cautious about it's
[1606.72 - 1610.24] really high in fat
[1608.56 - 1612.00] if you're going to do animal proteins
[1610.24 - 1613.68] you really like animal proteins and you
[1612.00 - 1615.60] keep it to grass-fed beef but you don't
[1613.68 - 1617.44] overdo it that's one option
[1615.60 - 1619.52] grass of beef just don't don't overdo it
[1617.44 - 1621.52] if you're into animal protein
[1619.52 - 1622.72] i would do turkey over chicken even
[1621.52 - 1625.44] though turkey's
[1622.72 - 1626.16] high in fat too i would do turkey over
[1625.44 - 1628.40] chicken
[1626.16 - 1630.48] i've listened i've i've been asked this
[1628.40 - 1631.28] a million times by doctors by all kinds
[1630.48 - 1632.56] of people by
[1631.28 - 1634.80] the most powerful people in the world
[1632.56 - 1636.48] that want my help and it's like what
[1634.80 - 1637.92] animal proteins i do anthony i'm not
[1636.48 - 1639.36] going to go plant-based so what animal
[1637.92 - 1640.16] proteins am i going to do well let me
[1639.36 - 1642.16] help you
[1640.16 - 1643.28] i want to help you eat animal protein i
[1642.16 - 1644.00] want to help you if you're plant-based
[1643.28 - 1646.80] too
[1644.00 - 1648.48] and so it'd be like you'd be like okay
[1646.80 - 1649.92] well when i go through things
[1648.48 - 1651.04] with people i'll give you the give you
[1649.92 - 1653.44] the rundown you could do a little bit of
[1651.04 - 1655.52] grass-fed beef if you like beef fine
[1653.44 - 1656.96] i would stay away from chicken yeah you
[1655.52 - 1657.92] can have it if you want but i would stay
[1656.96 - 1661.76] away from chicken
[1657.92 - 1663.44] it's way too high in fat um the turkey's
[1661.76 - 1665.52] better than the chicken even though
[1663.44 - 1667.84] turkey's high in fat's still better
[1665.52 - 1669.12] than the chicken for you so that's
[1667.84 - 1672.24] something to think about
[1669.12 - 1675.52] fish like i said the salmon the trout
[1672.24 - 1678.08] the haddock the sardines small fish
[1675.52 - 1679.68] like sardines really good option really
[1678.08 - 1680.72] good option if you're into animal
[1679.68 - 1682.80] protein
[1680.72 - 1684.64] and it's got lower metals in it don't
[1682.80 - 1686.40] get fooled by the fish thing
[1684.64 - 1688.32] hey he's talking about fish why is he
[1686.40 - 1689.76] doing that when he's about getting toxic
[1688.32 - 1691.04] heavy metals out
[1689.76 - 1693.12] first of all we're getting metals
[1691.04 - 1695.20] everywhere everywhere anyhow you're
[1693.12 - 1696.40] in grass-fed beef it's in there it's in
[1695.20 - 1698.16] every animal protein
[1696.40 - 1700.00] it's on every vegetable it's in every
[1698.16 - 1701.84] vegetable organic or not
[1700.00 - 1704.08] toxic heavy metals are in every single
[1701.84 - 1705.92] organic vegetable every single
[1704.08 - 1707.60] organic food you've ever eaten toxic
[1705.92 - 1709.20] heavy metals are in
[1707.60 - 1711.68] so when it comes down to fish it go with
[1709.20 - 1715.20] the smaller fish they do have less and
[1711.68 - 1717.44] go with wild caught but yeah
[1715.20 - 1720.32] i would stay away from tilapia stay the
[1717.44 - 1722.88] heck away from it
[1720.32 - 1725.84] so anyway there's some you know there's
[1722.88 - 1727.52] some information for you guys

[1769.60 - 1772.80] going to give you some important
[1770.64 - 1776.00] information let's work on that now
[1772.80 - 1780.72] okay let's do that
[1776.00 - 1782.32] um i'm just grabbing a hand towel sorry
[1780.72 - 1786.00] about that you guys
[1782.32 - 1787.52] so lyme disease look i recommend this
[1786.00 - 1789.12] book
[1787.52 - 1791.12] right here for the lyme disease
[1789.12 - 1793.84] information okay
[1791.12 - 1795.52] and get it free of the library once the
[1793.84 - 1797.20] book comes out because eventually it's
[1795.52 - 1800.72] going to end up in the library
[1797.20 - 1803.36] and i love that because i've actually i
[1800.72 - 1804.80] i what i do is i set aside funding and i
[1803.36 - 1807.92] get i try to get
[1804.80 - 1809.60] help with getting books in libraries so
[1807.92 - 1812.16] people can read the books for free
[1809.60 - 1813.20] something i've done for years um and if
[1812.16 - 1815.12] you don't have the 16
[1813.20 - 1816.96] 20 or whatever it's going to be the
[1815.12 - 1818.56] other thing is
[1816.96 - 1820.64] cleanse the heal has a lyme disease
[1818.56 - 1822.96] section in cleanse to heal
[1820.64 - 1824.80] with supplements and protocols just like
[1822.96 - 1826.16] the new addition does with supplements
[1824.80 - 1827.60] and protocols for lyme disease you can
[1826.16 - 1828.08] take it to your doctor find out what's
[1827.60 - 1829.44] you know
[1828.08 - 1831.44] your doctor can see what's right for you
[1829.44 - 1831.92] or not if you want talk to your doctor
[1831.44 - 1833.52] about
[1831.92 - 1835.36] what to do and all that if you want but
[1833.52 - 1837.84] the protocols are here okay that's one
[1835.36 - 1839.84] thing to know
[1837.84 - 1841.92] and then it's about supplements the best
[1839.84 - 1845.36] supplements and that's what matters too
[1841.92 - 1848.40] so using a b12
[1845.36 - 1849.28] that's not good won't get someone better
[1848.40 - 1851.76] down the road
[1849.28 - 1852.56] versus a b12 that is good so that's the
[1851.76 - 1854.48] other thing
[1852.56 - 1856.08] it's like like the vimergy products is
[1854.48 - 1857.12] what i recommend doctors so i tell
[1856.08 - 1858.56] doctors all the time
[1857.12 - 1860.72] i go if you're giving your patients
[1858.56 - 1862.56] another type of b12 then
[1860.72 - 1864.32] the the effective rate of actually them
[1862.56 - 1866.08] healing is going to be a lot less
[1864.32 - 1868.00] that's why the vimorgy products i always
[1866.08 - 1870.00] promote i promote other products too
[1868.00 - 1871.84] that are actually really good
[1870.00 - 1873.68] vimergi is the one i use that's why it's
[1871.84 - 1874.48] always on my counter it's the one i use
[1873.68 - 1878.04] so
[1874.48 - 1880.24] um vimerges v is in victor i m
[1878.04 - 1881.28] victorimergy.com vimrgy.com i'm not
[1880.24 - 1883.20] sponsored
[1881.28 - 1885.52] but the point is is that when it comes
[1883.20 - 1887.76] down to lyme disease it's like
[1885.52 - 1889.52] when you have neurological lyme it's you
[1887.76 - 1891.68] got to have the right b12
[1889.52 - 1893.76] and you ask your doctor if this is this
[1891.68 - 1895.28] is fine fine to do or whatever
[1893.76 - 1897.20] but this is what i would do if i had
[1895.28 - 1899.84] lyme disease neurological lyme
[1897.20 - 1900.48] that's the b12 i'd be using it's in and
[1899.84 - 1903.12] that's
[1900.48 - 1904.72] just the starting point of like okay
[1903.12 - 1906.16] then i would learn about what foods not
[1904.72 - 1908.32] to do
[1906.16 - 1910.48] vitamin c is critical if i had lyme
[1908.32 - 1912.56] disease i would be on microsee
[1910.48 - 1914.88] the vimercy microc that's what i would
[1912.56 - 1915.60] do personally me i'd be taking six
[1914.88 - 1917.28] capsules
[1915.60 - 1919.20] twice a day that's what i would do if i
[1917.28 - 1919.60] had lyme disease that's the microc right
[1919.20 - 1921.92] there
[1919.60 - 1923.84] and this goes with this goes with
[1921.92 - 1924.64] conditions and symptoms of all kinds too
[1923.84 - 1928.64] i mean
[1924.64 - 1930.48] this is all critical stuff um
[1928.64 - 1932.16] so and and then there's a bunch of other
[1930.48 - 1933.76] stuff too this is getting metals out
[1932.16 - 1935.36] anybody with lyme disease has toxic
[1933.76 - 1937.92] heavy metals off the charts
[1935.36 - 1940.24] off the charts even if the blood test
[1937.92 - 1942.24] doesn't show the toxic heavy metals
[1940.24 - 1944.48] if you got neurological lyme disease you
[1942.24 - 1944.88] got metals inside the brain nervous
[1944.48 - 1946.80] system
[1944.88 - 1948.80] liver all that's important to know so
[1946.80 - 1950.96] that's where the vimrgy spirulina and
[1948.80 - 1953.60] the heavy metal detox smoothie comes in
[1950.96 - 1954.96] so these are just some things um so i'll
[1953.60 - 1955.84] give you a couple tips about lyme
[1954.96 - 1957.92] disease
[1955.84 - 1959.44] lyme disease is viral not bacterial
[1957.92 - 1961.60] science research actually now
[1959.44 - 1963.68] are taking medical medium information
[1961.60 - 1964.88] they dump the whole bacterial thing so
[1963.68 - 1966.64] you know how you say you see the
[1964.88 - 1970.08] co-infection thing you see
[1966.64 - 1972.56] all right and there's a lyme disease
[1970.08 - 1974.24] in the original book here but this is
[1972.56 - 1975.92] the new edition with the lime protocol
[1974.24 - 1977.28] all that stuff that's in this i showed
[1975.92 - 1979.60] that to you earlier
[1977.28 - 1981.04] um so you guys can show that to you
[1979.60 - 1983.68] again see if that helps
[1981.04 - 1985.36] but the co-infection thing just give you
[1983.68 - 1988.32] a quick rundown about that
[1985.36 - 1988.88] that is old school now so that's old
[1988.32 - 1992.08] school
[1988.88 - 1993.36] because science research jumped ahead of
[1992.08 - 1995.36] all the lyme doctors
[1993.36 - 1996.64] so you got these old lyme doctors now
[1995.36 - 1998.88] going by old school
[1996.64 - 2001.28] and the blood labs going by old school
[1998.88 - 2003.12] right they think it's still bacteria
[2001.28 - 2005.20] that's what they think it's not bacteria
[2003.12 - 2007.68] it's it's viral it's viruses so
[2005.20 - 2009.52] but but when you say cofactors that
[2007.68 - 2011.68] means you got the old lyme doctors
[2009.52 - 2012.88] that means you got the old you got the
[2011.68 - 2016.00] old school
[2012.88 - 2019.36] process that process already
[2016.00 - 2020.80] hurt and hindered tens of thousands
[2019.36 - 2022.56] hundreds of thousands of women in the
[2020.80 - 2025.20] last 40 years
[2022.56 - 2026.80] so more than 40 years because it's not
[2025.20 - 2027.68] viral it's not bacterial it's viral
[2026.80 - 2029.92] sorry about that
[2027.68 - 2030.96] but so what happens is science research
[2029.92 - 2033.44] they know now
[2030.96 - 2034.40] it's not bacterial so that cofactor
[2033.44 - 2036.72] thing
[2034.40 - 2037.92] that thing is actually just old school
[2036.72 - 2039.44] it's almost like someone didn't get the
[2037.92 - 2041.60] memo at the blood lab
[2039.44 - 2042.96] but the blood lime labs they don't want
[2041.60 - 2044.56] to lose all their money and they don't
[2042.96 - 2046.24] want to lose everything they did
[2044.56 - 2048.00] so they're trying to save their skin so
[2046.24 - 2049.60] they keep on doing the same old thing
[2048.00 - 2052.56] even though science research
[2049.60 - 2054.32] already the boss the boss of all of them
[2052.56 - 2056.96] science research now
[2054.32 - 2057.92] has basically declared cleared it's not
[2056.96 - 2059.84] bacterial
[2057.92 - 2061.28] so here you've got like it's like a
[2059.84 - 2063.12] ghost ship you got the
[2061.28 - 2064.40] the lime labs still looking for
[2063.12 - 2065.92] co-factors you've got
[2064.40 - 2067.92] lyme doctors still looking for
[2065.92 - 2071.36] co-factors when that's not the problem
[2067.92 - 2072.72] that's how sad it is it's so sad mm-info
[2071.36 - 2074.00] has always talked about it being viral
[2072.72 - 2076.64] and now science research
[2074.00 - 2078.48] pulled it out of bacterial years after
[2076.64 - 2080.00] publication of the book and now they're
[2078.48 - 2081.68] looking for different things so it's
[2080.00 - 2084.64] important to know when you're healing
[2081.68 - 2085.28] okay so i'm gonna make the dipping sauce
[2084.64 - 2086.96] i have the
[2085.28 - 2089.28] artichoke right here i'm just gonna put
[2086.96 - 2092.32] it over
[2089.28 - 2092.96] got the artichokes there's a cooked
[2092.32 - 2095.36] artichoke
[2092.96 - 2096.88] cooked half i have that's a half of a
[2095.36 - 2100.32] cooked artichoke right there
[2096.88 - 2101.68] so the heart is right right in this area
[2100.32 - 2103.76] you've got to scoop out that little
[2101.68 - 2106.16] fiber that little fiber the
[2103.76 - 2107.04] seed fiber right there i could show you
[2106.16 - 2111.52] that too
[2107.04 - 2113.76] let me put these here so um
[2111.52 - 2117.84] let's make the uh first of all i gotta
[2113.76 - 2117.84] get a bowl
[2118.40 - 2125.12] and gonna whisk up a sauce
[2122.64 - 2125.92] so this is the mustard maple dipping
[2125.12 - 2128.24] sauce
[2125.92 - 2129.44] so i'm gonna have two tablespoons of
[2128.24 - 2130.96] maple syrup
[2129.44 - 2133.36] i'm going to drop some of this in here
[2130.96 - 2133.36] like that
[2138.24 - 2142.72] some maple syrup is good two and a half
[2140.88 - 2146.64] tablespoons of lemon
[2142.72 - 2146.64] juice now if you're worried about lemon
[2147.20 - 2152.16] you shouldn't be okay there's no signs
[2150.48 - 2153.84] of research that says lemon has done
[2152.16 - 2156.40] anything wrong to anybody but for some
[2153.84 - 2159.92] reason everybody believes it hurts them
[2156.40 - 2161.60] hurts their teeth really what happens is
[2159.92 - 2163.12] it's all the caffeine that's sucking
[2161.60 - 2164.96] life out of everybody's teeth
[2163.12 - 2167.12] sucking the calcium out of everybody's
[2164.96 - 2168.48] teeth it's on that apple cider vinegar
[2167.12 - 2169.44] it's all the vinegars i've been talking
[2168.48 - 2171.28] about right
[2169.44 - 2173.36] that's what's actually robbing from
[2171.28 - 2176.64] people's teeth it's lauren henry
[2173.36 - 2177.92] love cooked artichokes hey lauren good
[2176.64 - 2181.68] to see you
[2177.92 - 2185.12] lauren's a expert on mm info
[2181.68 - 2188.72] um good to see you here
[2185.12 - 2189.52] yeah i mean the real artichokes are so
[2188.72 - 2191.68] good
[2189.52 - 2193.44] what i'm doing is i'm making the mustard
[2191.68 - 2197.60] maple dipping sauce right now
[2193.44 - 2200.08] i'm adding some lemon and
[2197.60 - 2200.96] i need a little bit more lemon than that
[2200.08 - 2204.08] i want to get two
[2200.96 - 2207.60] two and a half tablespoons of lemon
[2204.08 - 2212.08] juice so i'm going to cut one more lemon
[2207.60 - 2213.44] lunell good to see you here
[2212.08 - 2215.12] so you know when it comes down to
[2213.44 - 2218.00] healing
[2215.12 - 2219.92] the supplements matter the foods matter
[2218.00 - 2221.12] like what foods to do what foods not to
[2219.92 - 2222.96] do
[2221.12 - 2226.24] anybody and everybody has a chance to
[2222.96 - 2229.60] heal it's how you play it
[2226.24 - 2230.56] right like it's about applying the
[2229.60 - 2232.16] information
[2230.56 - 2234.16] if you're somebody that doesn't want to
[2232.16 - 2236.08] apply all the information or they only
[2234.16 - 2237.68] want to apply one thing
[2236.08 - 2239.20] and then you get sidetracked and all
[2237.68 - 2242.96] this other information out there
[2239.20 - 2244.56] like throwing in collagen and
[2242.96 - 2246.72] doing you know doing something that
[2244.56 - 2249.68] maybe won't be the best for you
[2246.72 - 2251.44] downing the charcoal pills doing cruella
[2249.68 - 2252.88] whatever it is that's out there
[2251.44 - 2255.20] you're not going to go to the finish
[2252.88 - 2256.16] line doing too much fat when you're
[2255.20 - 2257.52] trying to heal
[2256.16 - 2258.96] you're not going to get down the finish
[2257.52 - 2259.84] line you're not going to get down there
[2258.96 - 2261.76] so
[2259.84 - 2264.16] if you want to heal it's about really
[2261.76 - 2267.60] applying as much as you can
[2264.16 - 2269.52] of what works that's a big deal to
[2267.60 - 2271.04] healing
[2269.52 - 2272.80] so i'm gonna need some mustard so let me
[2271.04 - 2274.56] do a little bit of that so
[2272.80 - 2277.52] about a half teaspoon of mustard powder
[2274.56 - 2277.52] let's get that going
[2278.48 - 2283.52] making the mustard maple dipping sauce
[2281.68 - 2285.84] a little mustard powder in there like
[2283.52 - 2285.84] that
[2286.08 - 2291.44] all right we got that so um
[2289.84 - 2292.64] what else do we need we need the cayenne
[2291.44 - 2293.68] a little bit of cayenne now you don't
[2292.64 - 2295.60] want it too hot
[2293.68 - 2296.80] i tend to spike everything and it gets a
[2295.60 - 2298.64] little too hot
[2296.80 - 2300.72] it's kind of like an accident i just end
[2298.64 - 2303.36] up throwing too much in there but
[2300.72 - 2304.88] i i think i did good right there so
[2303.36 - 2307.76] mustard powder cayenne
[2304.88 - 2308.72] a little bit of thyme fresh thyme half
[2307.76 - 2311.36] teaspoon tea
[2308.72 - 2313.76] teaspoon got the fresh thyme in here
[2311.36 - 2315.68] dropping that in there okay
[2313.76 - 2317.12] and let's see if there's anything else
[2315.68 - 2320.32] in here and then
[2317.12 - 2321.60] um some finely chopped parsley
[2320.32 - 2323.52] let's do a little bit of that i'm just
[2321.60 - 2327.84] gonna move this bowl over a touch
[2323.52 - 2327.84] let me get some parsley going
[2328.08 - 2331.68] so you don't have to have a lot of
[2329.20 - 2335.20] parsley for this one about a teaspoon
[2331.68 - 2335.20] finely chopped parsley
[2335.52 - 2341.84] there we go get that chopped up
[2342.08 - 2346.80] anyone can heal lyme disease anyone
[2347.04 - 2351.58] anyone countless people already have
[2348.88 - 2353.76] with the medical medium information
[2351.58 - 2356.80] [Music]
[2353.76 - 2358.24] lyme disease is viral that's why a lot
[2356.80 - 2359.28] of doctors now are testing for
[2358.24 - 2360.64] epstein-barr
[2359.28 - 2362.08] with their lyme patients because of
[2360.64 - 2363.60] medical medium information because
[2362.08 - 2365.76] really in truth epstein-barr is the
[2363.60 - 2369.84] cause one of the causes
[2365.76 - 2369.84] one of the main causes
[2370.24 - 2373.92] put a little bit of that parsley in here
[2375.92 - 2379.92] i'm gonna whisk this up that's one
[2378.72 - 2381.76] dipping sauce
[2379.92 - 2383.04] what you're gonna notice about these
[2381.76 - 2385.28] recipes you guys
[2383.04 - 2388.40] is you're gonna notice i'm not salting
[2385.28 - 2391.19] you guys out with a ton of salt
[2388.40 - 2392.96] no salt really
[2391.19 - 2396.72] [Music]
[2392.96 - 2398.96] because that'll get you in trouble too
[2396.72 - 2399.76] i mean all we do is salt ourselves out
[2398.96 - 2402.16] salt fat
[2399.76 - 2403.84] vinegar lots of fat salt vinegar that's
[2402.16 - 2406.72] what we do
[2403.84 - 2406.72] that's what everybody does
[2407.52 - 2412.00] and then we hit the msg natural
[2409.68 - 2414.08] flavoring that's all everybody does too
[2412.00 - 2415.44] lots of natural flavoring so it's like
[2414.08 - 2418.56] salt vinegar
[2415.44 - 2421.68] fats natural flavoring nutritional yeast
[2418.56 - 2422.64] yeast you know you know the game is with
[2421.68 - 2426.40] nutritional yeast
[2422.64 - 2426.40] they put the word nutritional before it
[2427.04 - 2432.24] yeah that's how they got you no it's
[2429.84 - 2432.24] yeast
[2432.72 - 2437.52] and east is filled with a lot of bad
[2434.56 - 2438.72] stuff msg
[2437.52 - 2440.48] you know what i never liked about the
[2438.72 - 2442.16] whole like edible yeast stuff it's like
[2440.48 - 2442.96] okay what about yeast infections you
[2442.16 - 2444.64] know
[2442.96 - 2446.48] it's what about yeast infections it's
[2444.64 - 2449.68] like okay
[2446.48 - 2451.76] why do i want yeast
[2449.68 - 2454.08] i mean i'm confused about that one a
[2451.76 - 2456.56] little bit
[2454.08 - 2458.64] let me just throw yeast on my food like
[2456.56 - 2461.60] that's real smart let me just throw
[2458.64 - 2461.60] yeast in my food
[2462.00 - 2465.04] and then let's put the word nutritional
[2463.60 - 2468.24] in front of yeast like
[2465.04 - 2471.68] fancy that one okay
[2468.24 - 2474.88] that's one dipping sauce right there
[2471.68 - 2476.32] okay so i'm just one dipping sauce gonna
[2474.88 - 2478.00] make another dipping sauce
[2476.32 - 2480.48] i need some room over here i'm just
[2478.00 - 2485.44] gonna put that over there for now
[2480.48 - 2487.44] um so when you think about it
[2485.44 - 2488.96] so worst thing you can have is yeast in
[2487.44 - 2492.00] general
[2488.96 - 2495.84] and as far as nutritional yeast just
[2492.00 - 2495.84] don't put that word in front of it
[2496.24 - 2499.36] yeah you can find a nutrient in
[2497.68 - 2500.96] everything that's bad for you you can
[2499.36 - 2501.92] find a nutrient in every single thing
[2500.96 - 2504.32] that's bad for you
[2501.92 - 2505.84] out there there's nutrients in snake
[2504.32 - 2508.48] venom
[2505.84 - 2510.00] do you want some snake venom right
[2508.48 - 2511.60] there's there's nutrients
[2510.00 - 2513.04] in snake venom should we start calling
[2511.60 - 2515.52] it nutritional
[2513.04 - 2516.56] snake venom that's what we should do
[2515.52 - 2519.36] like their
[2516.56 - 2521.04] black the black widow spider the venom
[2519.36 - 2522.72] of a black widow spider
[2521.04 - 2524.24] is nutrition and there's nutrition in
[2522.72 - 2527.68] there there's minerals in there
[2524.24 - 2530.64] trace minerals so nutritional
[2527.68 - 2533.52] venom spider venom i mean what
[2530.64 - 2533.52] nutritional yeast
[2534.80 - 2538.40] lauren said yeah if everyone is so
[2536.88 - 2540.00] worried about candida why are they
[2538.40 - 2544.24] eating nutritional yeast lauren
[2540.00 - 2546.72] it's so true oh my god it's so true
[2544.24 - 2547.68] right and they're down in this stuff
[2546.72 - 2549.04] down in it
[2547.68 - 2551.04] they're not like let me put a half a
[2549.04 - 2552.72] teaspoon of nutritional yeast here
[2551.04 - 2556.16] they're like let me pour that stuff on
[2552.72 - 2559.04] my food let me get it nice and tasty
[2556.16 - 2559.04] i mean exactly
[2559.36 - 2563.28] totally so let's see we're gonna make

[2639.52 - 2643.44] live on facebook at the same time by the
[2641.28 - 2645.28] way in case you want to know
[2643.44 - 2647.28] i know on youtube you can see it on the
[2645.28 - 2651.04] tv if you set it up that way
[2647.28 - 2653.68] singrit said haha my tcm doctor
[2651.04 - 2655.04] did give me snake venom in an herbal
[2653.68 - 2659.68] formula
[2655.04 - 2663.76] interesting and also a bad idea
[2659.68 - 2668.48] really bad idea
[2663.76 - 2670.72] that's a neurotoxin stuff scares me man
[2668.48 - 2672.64] chinero says is collagen healthy for the
[2670.72 - 2677.12] body
[2672.64 - 2679.76] no because you can't eat
[2677.12 - 2681.52] if you got an eye problem do you think
[2679.76 - 2683.52] eating a sheep's eyeball or a human
[2681.52 - 2685.44] eyeball is gonna fix your eye problem
[2683.52 - 2687.04] no if you got a kidney problem kidney
[2685.44 - 2688.16] disease do you think you should start
[2687.04 - 2691.20] eating kidneys
[2688.16 - 2692.48] you think it'll fix your kidney um you
[2691.20 - 2693.68] got a brain disease do you think
[2692.48 - 2694.96] desiccated brain
[2693.68 - 2697.52] in supplements is going to fix your
[2694.96 - 2698.88] brain i mean if none of that's going to
[2697.52 - 2700.40] work if you got collagen problems
[2698.88 - 2701.84] because your collagen is disintegrating
[2700.40 - 2703.28] because of caffeine damage
[2701.84 - 2705.20] because caffeine is what kills her
[2703.28 - 2706.56] collagen it's like
[2705.20 - 2708.40] you're losing your collagen and your
[2706.56 - 2709.84] skin's falling apart you know your
[2708.40 - 2710.96] skin's wrinkling and sagging and
[2709.84 - 2711.68] everything because your collagen is
[2710.96 - 2713.20] going away
[2711.68 - 2714.96] you're aging before your time that's
[2713.20 - 2716.48] because of caffeine it's from chocolate
[2714.96 - 2718.32] caffeine and from toxins and other
[2716.48 - 2721.04] things too it's not just caffeine
[2718.32 - 2722.48] but caffeine is a big one and you know
[2721.04 - 2723.60] you lose your collagen you can't just
[2722.48 - 2725.52] eat collagen to
[2723.60 - 2726.88] fix the collagen the body doesn't work
[2725.52 - 2728.40] like that the collagen will go in and
[2726.88 - 2729.92] you'll poop it out that's it
[2728.40 - 2732.32] go in and you'll poop it out it's just
[2729.92 - 2733.84] it doesn't find its way all of a sudden
[2732.32 - 2734.88] to where your collagen is supposed to be
[2733.84 - 2737.60] produced and then you
[2734.88 - 2739.04] produce collagen i mean this this this
[2737.60 - 2740.72] this shit's psycho out there
[2739.04 - 2742.32] it's actually psycho the stuff that
[2740.72 - 2743.04] they're doing like or the trends that
[2742.32 - 2744.56] are out there
[2743.04 - 2746.08] they just think you guys are all like
[2744.56 - 2747.92] suckers or something you know
[2746.08 - 2749.60] and i get it that's how the system's set
[2747.92 - 2751.04] up it's like the butter and the coffee
[2749.60 - 2752.00] thing how stupid is that you may as well
[2751.04 - 2754.80] have your eggs toast
[2752.00 - 2755.36] toast and bacon with it i mean how dumb
[2754.80 - 2757.92] is that
[2755.36 - 2758.72] like it's like it's psycho out there it
[2757.92 - 2760.80] really is
[2758.72 - 2761.76] and it's it's all there to just mess
[2760.80 - 2764.16] everybody up
[2761.76 - 2765.36] and make money while they're doing it
[2764.16 - 2770.75] it's crazy
[2765.36 - 2772.84] let's put some tablespoon of lemon in
[2770.75 - 2775.20] [Music]
[2772.84 - 2777.76] here
[2775.20 - 2777.76] get it going
[2779.44 - 2782.72] cmos anything good about it yeah it's
[2781.52 - 2784.32] fine
[2782.72 - 2786.24] it's not going to get the metals out
[2784.32 - 2788.40] like dolls and the heavy metal detox
[2786.24 - 2792.48] smoothie or spirulina
[2788.40 - 2794.96] but it it's fine you can do that
[2792.48 - 2796.24] see moss i'm not against it at all so
[2794.96 - 2797.52] i'm going to do one tablespoon of lemon
[2796.24 - 2798.72] juice i didn't get much out of that
[2797.52 - 2800.00] lemon for some of that lemon
[2798.72 - 2802.00] didn't have a lot of juice in it you
[2800.00 - 2803.76] know how that happens
[2802.00 - 2806.56] here we go here's a lemon that has a lot
[2803.76 - 2808.88] of juice in it there we go
[2806.56 - 2808.88] so
[2811.12 - 2814.88] are facial laser treatments harmful or
[2813.36 - 2818.88] beneficial
[2814.88 - 2818.88] micro needling harmful
[2819.68 - 2827.92] microneedling not good
[2822.80 - 2827.92] not good not good just letting you know
[2828.32 - 2831.76] not good at all body's trying to
[2830.00 - 2833.92] overcompensate for itself when you micro
[2831.76 - 2835.12] needle just like everything else and
[2833.92 - 2837.36] eventually you'll have more problems
[2835.12 - 2841.36] later on your skin than than than
[2837.36 - 2843.76] where you started from you get like
[2841.36 - 2845.84] micro needling leads to micro scar
[2843.76 - 2845.84] tissue
[2846.88 - 2850.72] that's what it leads to micro scar
[2848.88 - 2852.88] tissue is what it leads to
[2850.72 - 2854.72] and so i'm not a big fan of that right
[2852.88 - 2858.08] there
[2854.72 - 2862.32] just so you know
[2858.08 - 2862.32] um so that's one thing
[2862.64 - 2868.64] laser treatments of what happens is
[2866.24 - 2870.88] we get we get the sun spots from the
[2868.64 - 2872.64] toxins and the caffeine
[2870.88 - 2874.32] caffeine especially creates the sun
[2872.64 - 2875.68] spots so i mean
[2874.32 - 2878.56] that's one thing right there so the next
[2875.68 - 2880.08] thing you're doing lasers for that
[2878.56 - 2882.32] let's talk about skin cancer for a
[2880.08 - 2883.84] little bit too so um
[2882.32 - 2885.28] i've got one dipping sauce i got one in
[2883.84 - 2886.56] the making right here so i'm gonna put
[2885.28 - 2889.60] some raw honey in here
[2886.56 - 2892.32] two teaspoons of raw honey
[2889.60 - 2893.68] let's do that it's about two teaspoons
[2892.32 - 2894.88] just doubled it up
[2893.68 - 2900.48] this is gonna be really good this
[2894.88 - 2904.32] dipping sauce is incredible
[2900.48 - 2904.32] i'm gonna put a half a clove of garlic
[2904.72 - 2908.40] small garlic clove in here really
[2910.00 - 2913.76] you guys i just it's about protecting
[2911.76 - 2916.96] you you know it's it's
[2913.76 - 2917.70] like you know tough love tough love
[2916.96 - 2920.24] you know
[2917.70 - 2922.88] [Music]
[2920.24 - 2924.32] i know i'm pretty harsh about stuff
[2922.88 - 2926.80] truth is tough
[2924.32 - 2928.00] truth truth truth is tough but it's
[2926.80 - 2929.84] about it's about making sure
[2928.00 - 2932.16] you guys are protected in any way i can
[2929.84 - 2935.68] looking out for you guys
[2932.16 - 2935.68] and you know that's a big deal
[2936.40 - 2940.88] trying not to let you guys get suckered
[2937.92 - 2943.20] into stuff like rishi coffee
[2940.88 - 2944.24] mushroom coffee just trying to get you
[2943.20 - 2946.00] guys like
[2944.24 - 2948.24] in a safe zone so you don't get tricked
[2946.00 - 2950.32] by all the different trends collagen
[2948.24 - 2951.84] other things too butter in your coffee
[2950.32 - 2952.72] whatever else garbage is out there a
[2951.84 - 2954.40] dumb idea
[2952.72 - 2956.48] and i just want you guys protected you
[2954.40 - 2958.56] know it's important um
[2956.48 - 2960.00] like apple cider vinegar the teeth
[2958.56 - 2962.40] dissolver just
[2960.00 - 2964.96] ruins teeth like nothing does just that
[2962.40 - 2966.88] and caffeine just destroys teeth it's
[2964.96 - 2968.24] it's like i mean if you guys like going
[2966.88 - 2969.52] to the dentist in the future and you
[2968.24 - 2970.00] like getting your teeth rolled and you
[2969.52 - 2972.24] like getting
[2970.00 - 2973.60] implants and bridges and root canals and
[2972.24 - 2975.68] you like getting jaw disease
[2973.60 - 2977.60] and you know lose your bones and your
[2975.68 - 2979.76] jaw and everything else it's like
[2977.60 - 2981.28] then caffeine caffeine caffeine lots of
[2979.76 - 2982.24] chocolate because chocolate will make it
[2981.28 - 2983.84] so you
[2982.24 - 2985.20] you lose your jaw i mean you'll loop
[2983.84 - 2986.40] down the road you lose your teeth your
[2985.20 - 2987.84] teeth all wiggle out
[2986.40 - 2989.60] it's like and that's what happens it's
[2987.84 - 2991.36] caffeine doing that
[2989.60 - 2992.48] it's caffeine and chocolate doing that
[2991.36 - 2993.92] but yet everybody will tell you
[2992.48 - 2995.52] chocolate's such a great thing to do
[2993.92 - 2996.72] it's medicine it's plant medicine and
[2995.52 - 2998.56] what a crock that is
[2996.72 - 3000.08] it's like what do i do do i just be
[2998.56 - 3001.44] quiet about this stuff and just try to
[3000.08 - 3004.32] do my thing and be like
[3001.44 - 3006.08] oh here's my book uh here you can get
[3004.32 - 3008.00] better you guys or do i tell you like
[3006.08 - 3009.76] everything straight do i just lay it out
[3008.00 - 3011.52] on the table like i always have
[3009.76 - 3013.52] for 35 years with everybody i've ever
[3011.52 - 3015.12] talked to i can't change me you know i
[3013.52 - 3016.64] got to make sure i look out for you guys
[3015.12 - 3020.40] and that's that's what i'm about
[3016.64 - 3020.40] um you put a little water in here
[3021.52 - 3026.56] a couple tablespoons all right
[3024.96 - 3028.80] and i'm gonna put a little green onion
[3026.56 - 3029.60] in here chives but i'm gonna do green
[3028.80 - 3032.48] onion
[3029.60 - 3032.48] not gonna do a lot
[3035.44 - 3038.80] so do some chives in there i'm doing
[3037.52 - 3040.08] green onion i have them right here on
[3038.80 - 3042.00] the board you see that
[3040.08 - 3044.32] and i'm going to do a little bit of
[3042.00 - 3047.28] parsley
[3044.32 - 3048.48] it's about a quarter cup of some loose
[3047.28 - 3050.00] herbs
[3048.48 - 3053.68] quarter cup of loose herbs a little bit
[3050.00 - 3053.68] of parsley some dill
[3053.84 - 3058.00] right i got some dill here that's my
[3057.20 - 3059.92] dill
[3058.00 - 3061.28] i got some thyme here do a little bit of
[3059.92 - 3064.00] that too okay
[3061.28 - 3068.32] so and then i'm gonna blend it up let's
[3064.00 - 3070.16] see what we get
[3068.32 - 3072.00] but like if i don't give you guys just
[3070.16 - 3073.44] the straight up on stuff i mean then
[3072.00 - 3074.96] you're gonna just get like
[3073.44 - 3076.64] tricked into stuff you know and that's
[3074.96 - 3077.84] not good
[3076.64 - 3080.88] it's not good especially when you're
[3077.84 - 3082.64] sick or you don't feel good
[3080.88 - 3084.24] i'm making the dipping sauce right here
[3082.64 - 3085.68] this happens to be a really incredible
[3084.24 - 3087.04] one
[3085.68 - 3089.44] this is the recipe out of the new
[3087.04 - 3089.44] edition
[3090.00 - 3093.28] it's taking a little bit to spin
[3094.84 - 3097.84] okay
[3100.48 - 3104.80] so when it comes down to skin cancer
[3105.04 - 3108.32] science research wants you afraid of the
[3106.72 - 3111.84] sun now huh
[3108.32 - 3111.84] he wants you afraid of the sun
[3112.16 - 3116.00] i'm not telling you to go out and get a
[3113.52 - 3116.00] sunburn
[3116.56 - 3128.24] all right there we go
[3124.32 - 3128.24] that's the dipping sauce i'm excited
[3133.76 - 3139.04] so there's two dipping sauces with these
[3136.84 - 3140.32] artichokes so science of research will
[3139.04 - 3142.56] say hey
[3140.32 - 3144.80] you know the sun is where your skin
[3142.56 - 3147.12] cancer is caused the sun is the problem
[3144.80 - 3148.16] the sun is a bad thing that's that's
[3147.12 - 3150.08] what's going on
[3148.16 - 3152.16] um it's all about the sun causing your
[3150.08 - 3154.72] skin cancer like i said it's it's
[3152.16 - 3156.64] but you know why did the sun just all of
[3154.72 - 3157.36] a sudden go bad or something like that
[3156.64 - 3160.24] like
[3157.36 - 3162.08] because skin cancer is is more people
[3160.24 - 3163.44] that don't go in the sun get skin cancer
[3162.08 - 3166.24] than people that go in the sun
[3163.44 - 3167.12] so why is the sun all of a sudden like a
[3166.24 - 3169.36] problem
[3167.12 - 3170.96] and the other thing is is what billions
[3169.36 - 3171.68] of years go by and the sun went bad all
[3170.96 - 3173.44] of a sudden
[3171.68 - 3175.68] so i'm scratching my head on that one in
[3173.44 - 3178.96] the last 20 years the sun went bad
[3175.68 - 3181.36] so now the sun's the problem you know
[3178.96 - 3184.16] in the last 20 30 50 years the sun went
[3181.36 - 3186.24] bad so billions of years go by
[3184.16 - 3188.32] and now all of a sudden the sun is bad
[3186.24 - 3189.84] like just like our jeans so just like
[3188.32 - 3193.12] our jeans went bad
[3189.84 - 3196.40] so our genes went bad millions of years
[3193.12 - 3198.48] our genes went bad okay um
[3196.40 - 3200.08] billions of years the sun went bad now
[3198.48 - 3201.52] so everything's just going bad but
[3200.08 - 3203.28] but it's not the petrochemicals and the
[3201.52 - 3204.80] pesticides and your air fresheners
[3203.28 - 3206.40] it's not the toxic heavy metals in your
[3204.80 - 3209.12] pharmaceuticals
[3206.40 - 3210.72] that everybody's playing with uh from
[3209.12 - 3212.24] big pharma it's toxic heavy metals and
[3210.72 - 3214.40] every pharmaceutical it's not that it's
[3212.24 - 3215.92] not the caffeine everybody's drugged on
[3214.40 - 3217.36] it's not the drug dealer selling all the
[3215.92 - 3218.80] caffeine right now like the mushroom
[3217.36 - 3220.64] coffees and every other caffeine and
[3218.80 - 3223.20] chocolate and everything else
[3220.64 - 3224.48] to get teaching influencers to just sell
[3223.20 - 3226.00] all their chocolate now and everything
[3224.48 - 3227.44] else put their name on some chocolate
[3226.00 - 3229.28] and just get more kids high and more
[3227.44 - 3230.72] people high and more people high
[3229.28 - 3232.56] it's not any of that no it's not the
[3230.72 - 3234.16] radiation going through the airport
[3232.56 - 3236.80] i mean jesus christ you go through the
[3234.16 - 3239.76] airport and you get radiated to death
[3236.80 - 3241.44] it's not that no it's not the msg and
[3239.76 - 3243.04] all the natural flavors and all your
[3241.44 - 3244.48] powders and all your supplements and
[3243.04 - 3245.92] liquid supplements and all your foods
[3244.48 - 3246.72] and packaged foods it's not the natural
[3245.92 - 3249.12] flavors
[3246.72 - 3250.48] that which is straight msg it's not the
[3249.12 - 3251.92] ddt you're breathing in it's not the
[3250.48 - 3253.44] asbestos you're breathing in driving
[3251.92 - 3254.96] down the highway with your window down
[3253.44 - 3256.00] and all the asbestos is coming in from
[3254.96 - 3258.40] the sides of the highway
[3256.00 - 3260.24] from asbestos breaks for 100 years it's
[3258.40 - 3262.16] not the fire retardant on your
[3260.24 - 3263.68] your bed sheets and your your bedding
[3262.16 - 3265.60] and your your mattresses
[3263.68 - 3267.12] no it's not the fire retardant on your
[3265.60 - 3267.92] clothing it's not the fungicides under
[3267.12 - 3270.16] clothing either
[3267.92 - 3272.48] it's not that no the sun went bad that's
[3270.16 - 3275.84] why you got skin cancer the sun went bad
[3272.48 - 3277.28] i mean it's ridiculous it's like science
[3275.84 - 3277.84] research fell asleep or something or
[3277.28 - 3280.88] they're just
[3277.84 - 3281.60] they're just so negligent so negligent
[3280.88 - 3283.92] it's
[3281.60 - 3285.52] it's almost it's almost too much at this
[3283.92 - 3288.00] point it's almost
[3285.52 - 3290.48] so ridiculous and too stupid that you
[3288.00 - 3292.00] can't even like
[3290.48 - 3293.76] you can't even i mean i don't even know
[3292.00 - 3298.24] what to say anymore it's
[3293.76 - 3300.08] oh man anyway okay so
[3298.24 - 3301.54] we got a dipping sauce i need a bowl and
[3300.08 - 3304.40] here it is
[3301.54 - 3306.16] [Music]
[3304.40 - 3307.84] so this dipping sauce is really good
[3306.16 - 3310.00] it's a zucchini dipping sauce it's got
[3307.84 - 3315.52] the lemon
[3310.00 - 3315.52] and so i'm just getting it in here
[3317.44 - 3321.12] so i got this sauce it's really good so
[3319.36 - 3321.92] i got these artichokes here i got more
[3321.12 - 3323.76] in here
[3321.92 - 3326.24] right you guys see that just want to
[3323.76 - 3329.68] bring it over
[3326.24 - 3331.68] so so we're told it's not the suntan
[3329.68 - 3333.52] lotions right what about the toxic
[3331.68 - 3334.40] suntan lotions tell me those can't cause
[3333.52 - 3336.24] cancer
[3334.40 - 3337.52] i'm not saying burn yourself and sit in
[3336.24 - 3339.36] the sun and get and get them
[3337.52 - 3340.96] but what about the suntan lotions the
[3339.36 - 3343.36] sunscreen right
[3340.96 - 3344.16] toxic stuff you go to the beach and that
[3343.36 - 3346.64] stuff is so
[3344.16 - 3348.00] lethal like it's it's reeking off of
[3346.64 - 3350.00] people like you go to the beach
[3348.00 - 3352.32] and you don't sell you don't walk on the
[3350.00 - 3355.04] beach and be like oh
[3352.32 - 3356.64] clean ocean air let me breathe this in
[3355.04 - 3359.52] you know you do when you go to the beach
[3356.64 - 3360.16] oh my god i'm choking on cologne perfume
[3359.52 - 3362.32] and
[3360.16 - 3364.64] conventional laundry detergent and
[3362.32 - 3366.08] sunscreen filled toxic heavy metals and
[3364.64 - 3368.08] chemicals from companies
[3366.08 - 3369.76] let me just breathe in all that suntan
[3368.08 - 3370.80] lotion that's what happens when you go
[3369.76 - 3373.60] to the beach
[3370.80 - 3374.56] and you know skin cancer yeah the sun
[3373.60 - 3377.84] hand lotions
[3374.56 - 3379.68] talking about skin cancer so it's the
[3377.84 - 3382.88] chemicals in the suntan lotion
[3379.68 - 3386.00] the chemicals that are in there and um
[3382.88 - 3387.52] and then you know our own toxins you
[3386.00 - 3388.80] don't need to be in the sun
[3387.52 - 3390.40] that's a whole point you could be
[3388.80 - 3391.68] sitting at home and your liver is all
[3390.40 - 3393.04] stagnant and sluggish with all the
[3391.68 - 3394.88] toxins i talked about including the
[3393.04 - 3396.40] radiation the ddt the pesticides and
[3394.88 - 3398.32] chemicals and the gasoline
[3396.40 - 3399.68] you're pumping in your gas tank we can't
[3398.32 - 3402.08] run from all this stuff
[3399.68 - 3404.24] but that's what i mean it's like that's
[3402.08 - 3406.08] where the skin cancer comes from
[3404.24 - 3407.36] and then you need the viruses too
[3406.08 - 3409.68] because some
[3407.36 - 3411.12] some some skin cancers are not viral
[3409.68 - 3413.28] straight from toxins
[3411.12 - 3414.16] and chemicals but then some skin cancers
[3413.28 - 3416.24] they're viral
[3414.16 - 3418.16] so you need to feed the viruses all
[3416.24 - 3419.36] these toxins to create a skin cancer has
[3418.16 - 3421.36] nothing to do with the sun
[3419.36 - 3422.80] sun has not nothing to do with it same
[3421.36 - 3424.48] thing with sunspots
[3422.80 - 3426.64] the sun has nothing to do with sunspots
[3424.48 - 3428.16] it's like i love that one
[3426.64 - 3429.92] what does science research do do they
[3428.16 - 3431.36] just wake up one morning and say we're
[3429.92 - 3432.96] just going to the crap out of
[3431.36 - 3434.40] everybody we're gonna sit in the lab and
[3432.96 - 3436.40] not do anything we're gonna sit in the
[3434.40 - 3437.60] lab kick our feet up and not do nothing
[3436.40 - 3439.44] and then we're just gonna tell him it's
[3437.60 - 3440.96] the sun we're just gonna make it up
[3439.44 - 3443.68] there's no study that shows it we're
[3440.96 - 3445.76] just gonna make it up
[3443.68 - 3446.96] and i'll tell you why it's like that
[3445.76 - 3448.24] because they don't want you knowing why
[3446.96 - 3449.52] you're sick and they don't want you know
[3448.24 - 3450.96] why you get skin cancer and they don't
[3449.52 - 3452.08] want you to know why you got problems
[3450.96 - 3452.80] and they don't want you to know what's
[3452.08 - 3454.64] going on
[3452.80 - 3456.24] they don't want you to know about that
[3454.64 - 3457.60] about what's in the medications
[3456.24 - 3459.44] they don't want to know wants you to
[3457.60 - 3460.16] know anything they want you blind they
[3459.44 - 3462.80] want you just
[3460.16 - 3464.64] they want you just not knowing nothing
[3462.80 - 3466.64] melissa says have you ever been asked to
[3464.64 - 3469.20] host your own television show
[3466.64 - 3470.24] a thousand times you have the best
[3469.20 - 3473.52] information a
[3470.24 - 3475.36] thousand times i always felt that if i
[3473.52 - 3477.52] go and do one of the television shows
[3475.36 - 3479.44] been asked by every major network
[3477.52 - 3480.96] practically in the world to take on the
[3479.44 - 3482.72] medical medium and do the medical medium
[3480.96 - 3485.52] series the medical medium show
[3482.72 - 3486.80] i've been asked all every network you
[3485.52 - 3488.96] name the network
[3486.80 - 3490.80] they've asked me okay and they've asked
[3488.96 - 3494.48] me for 15
[3490.80 - 3498.16] years 15 plus years i've been asked
[3494.48 - 3501.92] long before social media i mean
[3498.16 - 3502.48] 15 plus years before social media right
[3501.92 - 3505.04] and
[3502.48 - 3505.68] um and i've turned it down because i
[3505.04 - 3507.84] feel like
[3505.68 - 3509.44] once it gets you in that rat race once
[3507.84 - 3511.04] they get you in that
[3509.44 - 3512.56] then you're screwed because you're gonna
[3511.04 - 3515.04] be so wrapped up in that
[3512.56 - 3516.00] that like that rat race they put you in
[3515.04 - 3518.24] you're not going to be able to help
[3516.00 - 3519.52] people like really help people you're
[3518.24 - 3520.88] you're not going to be able to
[3519.52 - 3522.72] be personable you're not you're not
[3520.88 - 3524.00] going to be able to break bread with
[3522.72 - 3525.28] your people because that's what i like
[3524.00 - 3526.24] doing with you guys is breaking bread
[3525.28 - 3528.64] with you guys
[3526.24 - 3529.60] and those days ago they'll just be gone
[3528.64 - 3531.28] next thing you know you got to get a
[3529.60 - 3532.32] publicist see i don't have i don't do
[3531.28 - 3533.68] that
[3532.32 - 3535.76] i've been told a million times you need
[3533.68 - 3537.60] pr you need publicist because you're
[3535.76 - 3539.44] you're well known in the world you're
[3537.60 - 3541.36] blah blah celebrity or whatever the heck
[3539.44 - 3542.64] i'm told that all the time but the
[3541.36 - 3544.16] minute you do that and then they're
[3542.64 - 3545.60] going to force the publicist on your
[3544.16 - 3545.92] force and then the publicist is gonna
[3545.60 - 3548.00] say
[3545.92 - 3549.68] don't you go near those dirty people
[3548.00 - 3550.24] don't you go near those dirty little
[3549.68 - 3552.40] people
[3550.24 - 3554.16] don't you go near all those fans they're
[3552.40 - 3555.76] they're just fans that's what they are
[3554.16 - 3556.16] cause that's your publicist will do be
[3555.76 - 3558.16] like
[3556.16 - 3559.76] those are just fans you just stay away
[3558.16 - 3561.76] from them don't talk to them
[3559.76 - 3563.60] don't be transparent you're just you're
[3561.76 - 3565.28] in your big tv show now and that's what
[3563.60 - 3566.24] they'll do and i'm like i'm not going
[3565.28 - 3569.44] that's not
[3566.24 - 3571.36] my people are my people and meaning like
[3569.44 - 3572.88] you know what i mean it's like you guys
[3571.36 - 3574.80] are family so it's like
[3572.88 - 3576.40] no i don't want to go and do that and
[3574.80 - 3577.28] that's why i've turned it down because i
[3576.40 - 3579.04] remember
[3577.28 - 3581.36] many years ago been asked to do the
[3579.04 - 3583.04] major networks make ask do tv shows and
[3581.36 - 3584.24] there's a disconnect that happens once
[3583.04 - 3587.04] you start going there
[3584.24 - 3587.68] and that disconnect takes you away from
[3587.04 - 3589.52] you know
[3587.68 - 3590.80] the people who matter in the world and
[3589.52 - 3593.36] getting them better you
[3590.80 - 3595.12] you you know unless it's done right and
[3593.36 - 3597.60] i haven't found that
[3595.12 - 3599.28] that way to do it but that's how because
[3597.60 - 3600.80] what i've done is focused on the books
[3599.28 - 3603.28] so i was worried that the
[3600.80 - 3604.64] tv careers and those big careers and
[3603.28 - 3606.00] netflix careers and all the big
[3604.64 - 3607.44] you know which are hey they're great for
[3606.00 - 3608.48] somebody else maybe but i was always
[3607.44 - 3611.60] worried that
[3608.48 - 3613.20] though that career sector would take
[3611.60 - 3616.88] away from
[3613.20 - 3618.64] me sitting in my office at my desk
[3616.88 - 3620.72] and making sure you can save your life
[3618.64 - 3622.88] with these books i was afraid that
[3620.72 - 3624.96] once i start doing all that tv heavy tv
[3622.88 - 3626.40] stuff there's no getting these books out
[3624.96 - 3627.76] to you guys anymore to save your lives
[3626.40 - 3628.00] this book has saved millions of lives
[3627.76 - 3629.52] around
[3628.00 - 3631.20] the world right here the original book
[3629.52 - 3633.20] this is the new edition
[3631.20 - 3634.32] and and it's and i'm not going to get a
[3633.20 - 3636.08] chance to tell you about the best
[3634.32 - 3636.88] supplements you think if i do a tv show
[3636.08 - 3638.88] i can tell you
[3636.88 - 3640.00] what the best vitamin c is the vimergy
[3638.88 - 3642.80] the microc and the
[3640.00 - 3645.68] the curcumin there's no way like it
[3642.80 - 3648.96] won't be a chance to do that
[3645.68 - 3650.00] so anyway it was all about focusing on
[3648.96 - 3653.68] writing the books
[3650.00 - 3655.76] and that's why and you know and i was i
[3653.68 - 3659.36] in and i've been asked to write them
[3655.76 - 3660.64] from people who are in need and
[3659.36 - 3663.04] you know and i didn't want that
[3660.64 - 3663.84] disconnect the disconnect that happens
[3663.04 - 3667.04] when you
[3663.84 - 3667.84] go to tv land and now your fans are just
[3667.04 - 3670.48] you know it's
[3667.84 - 3671.84] it's i don't like that you know it's
[3670.48 - 3674.72] it's not it's not about that because
