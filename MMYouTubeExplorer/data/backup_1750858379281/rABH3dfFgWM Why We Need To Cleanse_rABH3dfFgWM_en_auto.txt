[16.72 - 20.88] oranges i see lemons i see everything
[19.12 - 23.28] we're gonna juice a little bit of celery
[20.88 - 25.12] right lost that one they got it we're
[23.28 - 26.48] gonna do we're gonna have some fun it's
[25.12 - 28.08] gonna be awesome so we're doing the
[26.48 - 30.32] medical medium morning plans challenge
[28.08 - 31.20] but really we're getting ready for it
[30.32 - 33.84] okay
[31.20 - 36.32] i'm doing it anyway today but it starts
[33.84 - 37.76] tomorrow and it's free
[36.32 - 39.36] it's free
[37.76 - 41.52] good to see you guys coming on here i'm
[39.36 - 42.56] excited about this i'm gonna talk about
[41.52 - 46.00] why
[42.56 - 49.04] you have to cleanse why it's important
[46.00 - 51.44] if you hear someone say the body
[49.04 - 53.04] cleanses itself
[51.44 - 54.72] they're wrong
[53.04 - 56.16] they're wrong
[54.72 - 59.76] i mean
[56.16 - 60.56] the body does not cleanse itself
[59.76 - 61.36] we
[60.56 - 62.48] get
[61.36 - 64.24] sick
[62.48 - 65.92] and we die
[64.24 - 67.84] that's how it works on planet earth
[65.92 - 71.12] that's how it works okay
[67.84 - 74.24] do you want to get sick early
[71.12 - 74.24] and die early
[74.56 - 77.44] or do you want to get
[76.40 - 80.32] sick
[77.44 - 82.80] way at the end
[80.32 - 84.48] and die later that's a better option
[82.80 - 86.32] right because everybody dies and
[84.48 - 88.32] everybody dies and they get sick right
[86.32 - 90.48] everybody gets sick sometime and
[88.32 - 92.40] whatever that's the way the world works
[90.48 - 93.84] right now okay because the world is too
[92.40 - 96.56] polluted
[93.84 - 99.60] it's too problematic
[96.56 - 101.28] there's too many traps there's too much
[99.60 - 103.68] junk in the way
[101.28 - 106.40] and it's rigged like that so we die
[103.68 - 107.52] early that's how the world is rigged
[106.40 - 108.72] right
[107.52 - 111.04] the
[108.72 - 112.80] evil doers
[111.04 - 114.48] on the planet
[112.80 - 116.32] want people
[114.48 - 118.40] gone
[116.32 - 121.04] that's what they want right
[118.40 - 122.96] so there's all these ways they do it
[121.04 - 125.04] there's all these traps set for
[122.96 - 126.48] everybody so if you hear some dietitian
[125.04 - 129.60] some nutritionist some functional
[126.48 - 131.84] medicine doctors some health some health
[129.60 - 133.68] food advocate somebody whatever some
[131.84 - 135.84] health coach whatever some nutritionists
[133.68 - 137.76] whatever it is if you hear them say in
[135.84 - 139.44] an article or you hear them saying
[137.76 - 141.36] social media somewhere else the body
[139.44 - 144.08] cleanses itself you don't need to drink
[141.36 - 145.76] celery juice medical medium's wrong you
[144.08 - 147.28] just eat the stick oh you just have
[145.76 - 148.88] fruits and vegetables and that's the
[147.28 - 151.36] good thing to do
[148.88 - 154.08] if they're saying that
[151.36 - 155.92] they're oblivious to how the world works
[154.08 - 156.96] they're oblivious to what's really
[155.92 - 159.36] happening
[156.96 - 161.28] they're oblivious to any of it they're
[159.36 - 162.96] ignorant to all of it
[161.28 - 164.40] they don't know what's happening they
[162.96 - 165.60] don't know what's being dumped on us
[164.40 - 166.72] they don't know what's happening they
[165.60 - 167.92] don't know what's in our water they
[166.72 - 169.04] don't know what's in our food they don't
[167.92 - 171.12] know anything
[169.04 - 173.68] and then what's worse they don't know
[171.12 - 175.76] anything about the human body because
[173.68 - 178.48] your liver is this filter and it
[175.76 - 181.04] contains all that junk and it holds on
[178.48 - 183.04] to it and then it gets sick
[181.04 - 184.96] and then it gets sick and our body gets
[183.04 - 186.32] sick so if you guys just came on here
[184.96 - 188.32] watch this from the beginning this is an
[186.32 - 189.60] important talk of why you need to

[543.44 - 549.04] heavy metals do we have in our system
[546.08 - 550.88] all of it gasoline fumes you breathe in
[549.04 - 552.72] in the pump you're breathing in all
[550.88 - 555.12] those gas fumes you're breathing in
[552.72 - 556.96] somebody vaping around the corner you're
[555.12 - 558.72] you're just walking down a city street
[556.96 - 560.48] wherever you are you're breathing and
[558.72 - 562.48] people vaping in their cars you got the
[560.48 - 564.48] car windows cracked and all that
[562.48 - 566.40] vaping's coming out the window like this
[564.48 - 568.40] and it's getting sucked into your car
[566.40 - 571.44] yeah you're breathing in little bits of
[568.40 - 574.96] it everywhere so basically you're just
[571.44 - 577.68] this filter bringing in all the toxins
[574.96 - 579.52] and the poisons every single day it's
[577.68 - 581.12] coming out of the walls in our houses
[579.52 - 582.72] it's coming out of the sofas it's coming
[581.12 - 585.20] out of the bed there's fire retardant
[582.72 - 587.20] it's on all the beds and
[585.20 - 588.88] bedding and everything else fungicides
[587.20 - 591.12] on people's bedding they don't know they
[588.88 - 593.52] buy it sits in there for 10 years we are
[591.12 - 595.84] saturated and inundated with toxins on a
[593.52 - 598.88] level people have no idea and let's wait
[595.84 - 601.12] i'm not even talking about the sea trail
[598.88 - 602.64] not even talking about the sea trail
[601.12 - 605.04] not even talking about how much is
[602.64 - 605.84] dumped on us on a daily basis but guess
[605.04 - 607.84] what
[605.84 - 609.76] you can read an article that comes out
[607.84 - 612.00] probably every month somewhere whether
[609.76 - 614.00] it's a slam on medical medium or slam on
[612.00 - 615.84] something else and that article says you
[614.00 - 617.92] don't need a cleanse
[615.84 - 620.32] you know your body takes care of itself
[617.92 - 622.16] it cleanses itself i mean
[620.32 - 623.52] i don't know if that's even ignorance i
[622.16 - 626.24] don't know what that is i don't know if
[623.52 - 629.52] it's stupidity i don't know if it's just
[626.24 - 630.80] a newbie that doesn't know anything
[629.52 - 632.00] i love when there's all these health
[630.80 - 634.40] professionals i mean i've been in this
[632.00 - 636.48] for 35 plus years going over 35 years

[636.48 - 640.32] are born yesterday they have an
[638.08 - 641.76] awakening like i'm going to eat fruits
[640.32 - 643.36] and vegetables and i'm going to eat
[641.76 - 645.04] organic and then i'm going to get a
[643.36 - 646.96] little degree somewhere and get my
[645.04 - 649.28] masters and then i'm gonna get an
[646.96 - 650.88] interview in somebody's article someday
[649.28 - 653.28] and i'm gonna act like i've been in this
[650.88 - 654.56] forever and it's really sad
[653.28 - 656.72] and what do they do they'll say
[654.56 - 658.24] something like you don't need to cleanse
[656.72 - 661.84] it's not what we were taught in our

[829.60 - 835.20] we could cleanse
[832.00 - 836.00] try to control it detox
[835.20 - 840.08] right
[836.00 - 843.12] keep the real true balance going
[840.08 - 846.00] where we're getting more out of us
[843.12 - 850.00] than what toxic crap is coming in us
[846.00 - 852.80] more toxic stuff coming out of us
[850.00 - 854.96] than what's coming in it's like the boat
[852.80 - 856.64] man it's like the boat you're sitting in
[854.96 - 858.16] that little boat
[856.64 - 859.84] and the water's coming in because
[858.16 - 861.68] there's a hole in that boat and you got
[859.84 - 864.08] a bucket and that water's coming in
[861.68 - 866.00] quick and you're scooping the water out
[864.08 - 867.36] as the water is coming in right that's
[866.00 - 869.76] what you're doing
[867.36 - 872.00] okay you gotta scoop the water out
[869.76 - 873.92] faster than the water coming into the
[872.00 - 876.00] boat that's going to sink your ass
[873.92 - 877.84] that's the whole point so you don't get
[876.00 - 879.20] sunk and go down
[877.84 - 880.88] and drown
[879.20 - 882.96] and so what we got to do is when we're
[880.88 - 885.92] cleansing is we're getting the toxins
[882.96 - 887.20] out faster than they are coming in
[885.92 - 888.40] because when you're doing like the
[887.20 - 890.00] medical meeting morning cleanse

[1085.28 - 1091.76] insane on planet earth recently
[1088.56 - 1093.04] we're heading into a really serious
[1091.76 - 1094.72] place where people are going to be
[1093.04 - 1096.64] dropping off a lot more and dropping off
[1094.72 - 1099.36] a lot more dropping off a lot more if

[1104.80 - 1109.68] all this stuff going inside of you a
[1106.64 - 1111.60] whole bit claudia says talk about how
[1109.68 - 1114.08] the lymphatic system is the backup for
[1111.60 - 1115.44] the liver thanks good question awesome
[1114.08 - 1117.36] everybody's worried about the lymphatic
[1115.44 - 1118.88] system right in health and in it's
[1117.36 - 1120.24] usually newbies you're not newbie
[1118.88 - 1122.56] claudia i know that but there's usually
[1120.24 - 1123.92] newbies right they get in health and
[1122.56 - 1125.12] they're like i'm getting a lymphatic
[1123.92 - 1127.92] massage
[1125.12 - 1130.56] i'm like i need i need my lymph my
[1127.92 - 1132.64] lymphatic stuff that's what it is i talk
[1130.56 - 1133.92] to my nutritionist and they're all about
[1132.64 - 1136.56] lymphatic
[1133.92 - 1139.04] that's what it is right it's all about
[1136.56 - 1140.64] that and i went to my acupuncturist
[1139.04 - 1143.20] they're all about my lymphatic and my
[1140.64 - 1145.52] functional medicine doctor said you know
[1143.20 - 1148.32] my lymphatic system is where the
[1145.52 - 1149.60] troubles at
[1148.32 - 1152.48] wrong
[1149.60 - 1154.72] it's not how it works
[1152.48 - 1158.48] your lymphatic system
[1154.72 - 1161.36] only becomes a problem because of your
[1158.48 - 1163.68] liver has already gotten there first
[1161.36 - 1166.08] your liver has already gotten sick first
[1163.68 - 1168.48] for the lymphatic system to get sick
[1166.08 - 1168.48] later
[1168.64 - 1172.40] if you're working on the lymphatic
[1170.64 - 1173.84] system but not working on the liver then
[1172.40 - 1175.36] you're not working on the root cause of
[1173.84 - 1178.16] the root problem that's what's happening
[1175.36 - 1180.56] your liver gets stagnant and sluggish
[1178.16 - 1180.56] first
[1180.80 - 1184.32] and
[1181.68 - 1186.48] your lymphatic system is the dump ground
[1184.32 - 1188.72] it's like the dumping ground for a liver
[1186.48 - 1192.48] that's already pushed over the edge it's
[1188.72 - 1194.80] already so polluted it's already sick
[1192.48 - 1196.48] and so the lymphatic system if we got
[1194.80 - 1197.84] the we got our eyes on the lymphatic
[1196.48 - 1199.20] system all the time but we don't have
[1197.84 - 1200.96] our eyes on everything else we don't
[1199.20 - 1202.80] have our eyes on all the bugs that are
[1200.96 - 1204.40] inside our liver we don't have the our
[1202.80 - 1206.80] eyes on the epstein bar that's inside
[1204.40 - 1208.48] our liver we don't have our eyes on any
[1206.80 - 1210.00] of that we don't have our eyes on all
[1208.48 - 1211.84] the toxic heavy metals and the
[1210.00 - 1214.00] pollutants and the chemicals if we don't
[1211.84 - 1217.60] have our eyes on all that you know
[1214.00 - 1220.72] aluminum and everything else and mercury
[1217.60 - 1222.88] and copper if we don't have our eyes on
[1220.72 - 1224.96] everything that's saturating inside your
[1222.88 - 1226.56] liver and making it sick and stagnant
[1224.96 - 1228.48] and sluggish and instead we're just
[1226.56 - 1231.12] doing topical stuff
[1228.48 - 1233.28] like oh my lymphatic system that's
[1231.12 - 1235.28] that's where the problem is really okay
[1233.28 - 1236.64] oh i took this lymphatic system tonic
[1235.28 - 1238.32] here to help me that somebody
[1236.64 - 1240.80] recommended it's like oh my god you're
[1238.32 - 1243.60] so far off and guess what 20 30 years
[1240.80 - 1245.76] from now you're gonna be so sick
[1243.60 - 1248.00] and so lost
[1245.76 - 1250.00] and like i said on here on planet earth
[1248.00 - 1251.44] that's how it rolls everybody has a
[1250.00 - 1254.16] symptom i don't know if you guys know
[1251.44 - 1255.76] this yet kids included all have symptoms
[1254.16 - 1257.84] all have problems it's only getting
[1255.76 - 1259.76] worse out there because the world's
[1257.84 - 1262.40] getting more polluted and more shady
[1259.76 - 1264.24] than ever in all kind of sinister ways
[1262.40 - 1266.16] and if we don't do something about it
[1264.24 - 1267.60] and empower ourselves and stay strong
[1266.16 - 1270.88] then how are we going to battle it and
[1267.60 - 1270.88] how we're going to recover and heal
[1272.16 - 1277.68] how are we going to do it
[1274.00 - 1280.16] so if you hear right
[1277.68 - 1281.92] do you hear you don't need to cleanse
[1280.16 - 1283.84] somebody that just doesn't understand
[1281.92 - 1285.36] health
[1283.84 - 1286.72] now i know that there's some bad
[1285.36 - 1289.28] cleanses throughout the years that have
[1286.72 - 1291.20] given people about the given people a
[1289.28 - 1294.40] bad ride and have given
[1291.20 - 1296.32] cleansing a bad name
[1294.40 - 1298.48] i've never supported any of those
[1296.32 - 1301.44] cleanses ever
[1298.48 - 1305.84] i've never supported just shoving water
[1301.44 - 1308.40] and cayenne pepper and oil in a drink
[1305.84 - 1311.68] and then sent it down all day and all
[1308.40 - 1314.08] night i've never never supported any
[1311.68 - 1316.24] ridiculous
[1314.08 - 1318.56] problematic cleanse that was ever
[1316.24 - 1320.72] offered out there the medical medium
[1318.56 - 1322.56] information's different it's about the
[1320.72 - 1324.88] chronically ill and recovering it's
[1322.56 - 1326.24] about recovering sensitive people you
[1324.88 - 1328.40] guys it's about
[1326.24 - 1330.40] people who are sensitive because they've
[1328.40 - 1332.24] been injured with their health along the
[1330.40 - 1334.88] way they've been chronically sick for
[1332.24 - 1337.12] many many years the cleansing that we're
[1334.88 - 1339.12] talking about is an entirely different
[1337.12 - 1341.20] ballpark and it gets people better and
[1339.12 - 1343.60] it's so important jennifer said i've
[1341.20 - 1346.24] been doing the morning cleanse and or
[1343.60 - 1348.64] doing mono cleanses awesomes right from
[1346.24 - 1351.20] this book here and pretty much cured my
[1348.64 - 1353.20] fibromyalgia in six months
[1351.20 - 1355.76] incredible i'm amazed anthony you've
[1353.20 - 1357.76] definitely got the right information and
[1355.76 - 1359.20] fibromyalgia if you read and cleanse the
[1357.76 - 1360.80] heal and jennifer you probably know this
[1359.20 - 1362.48] right is the epstein bar so that's
[1360.80 - 1364.00] that's the epstein bar causing that
[1362.48 - 1365.60] nerve inflammation causing all that
[1364.00 - 1367.68] fibromyalgia and what you did was you
[1365.60 - 1370.00] did these cleanses you did the mono
[1367.68 - 1372.08] cleanse and you starved out the epstein
[1370.00 - 1374.64] bar so what you did is you starved out
[1372.08 - 1375.92] and killed off the epstein-barr that's
[1374.64 - 1378.24] amazing and
[1375.92 - 1380.64] that's actually really incredible i'm
[1378.24 - 1384.08] really proud of you seriously

[1421.76 - 1426.64] but we're just doing the pre-talk
[1424.00 - 1428.80] because this is important we're going
[1426.64 - 1430.24] we're going to where we need to go which
[1428.80 - 1432.16] is getting into that morning cleanse
[1430.24 - 1434.00] challenge tomorrow right katie says i've
[1432.16 - 1435.84] been doing the morning cleanse and heavy
[1434.00 - 1438.80] metal detox yeah
[1435.84 - 1441.60] smoothie for almost three years i healed
[1438.80 - 1443.76] from hashimoto's you destroyed your
[1441.60 - 1445.36] epstein-barr that causes hashimoto's
[1443.76 - 1446.64] thyroiditis which is
[1445.36 - 1448.24] medical meme information now that
[1446.64 - 1450.40] science is trying to steal all the mm
[1448.24 - 1452.80] info about epstein-barr from me years
[1450.40 - 1454.88] later that's on facebook katie fantastic
[1452.80 - 1456.84] but you killed off your epstein bar you
[1454.88 - 1459.12] knocked it back you restored your
[1456.84 - 1460.88] thyroid mm info i'm really really proud
[1459.12 - 1462.56] of you i can't even tell you're
[1460.88 - 1464.64] so proud of you
[1462.56 - 1466.00] big time big time
[1464.64 - 1467.44] you guys i'm a little more pumped up
[1466.00 - 1468.32] today if you notice
[1467.44 - 1470.08] um
[1468.32 - 1472.32] one reason is because we're going into a
[1470.08 - 1474.00] cleanse tomorrow okay we're going to do
[1472.32 - 1476.16] a cleanse i've been excited about this
[1474.00 - 1478.40] because i've been wanting to get to this
[1476.16 - 1480.00] point with everything to get you know to
[1478.40 - 1481.84] get to where we need to and i think
[1480.00 - 1483.28] right now it's winter in a lot of places
[1481.84 - 1484.64] right we're in the united states it's
[1483.28 - 1486.80] winter
[1484.64 - 1487.92] in the us right now okay
[1486.80 - 1489.28] you know on the other side of the world
[1487.92 - 1491.20] it's not winter but it's winter right
[1489.28 - 1492.16] now in the u.s and
[1491.20 - 1494.24] um
[1492.16 - 1496.48] and also in other places too around the
[1494.24 - 1498.80] world too it's winter so it's kind of a
[1496.48 - 1501.84] great place to get some of these toxins
[1498.80 - 1503.68] and poison so they don't incubate
[1501.84 - 1506.08] they don't incubate
[1503.68 - 1508.16] and that's what happens when we go into
[1506.08 - 1510.32] this like kind of like hibernation we
[1508.16 - 1512.48] end up not eating so good either and we
[1510.32 - 1514.88] end up really compacting the poisons and
[1512.48 - 1517.68] toxins into our
[1514.88 - 1520.64] liver we end up compacting it into our
[1517.68 - 1522.88] cells right and those toxins and poisons
[1520.64 - 1524.48] get they just get stuck in there is what
[1522.88 - 1526.64] they do they get stuck in the cells of
[1524.48 - 1528.64] the organs that's what happens right
[1526.64 - 1530.56] there and so
[1528.64 - 1531.36] cleansing
[1530.56 - 1532.48] right
[1531.36 - 1534.48] cleansing
[1532.48 - 1535.92] gets those poisons out so we're not
[1534.48 - 1537.36] stagnant
[1535.92 - 1539.52] so if you're looking at that snow
[1537.36 - 1541.84] blowing if you're looking at that wind
[1539.52 - 1544.16] of blowing outside and you're inside and
[1541.84 - 1546.08] you're trying to stay warm at least you
[1544.16 - 1547.84] know you're cleaning out all the junk
[1546.08 - 1549.60] and all the garbage outside of you like
[1547.84 - 1551.12] you're getting it out of you right the
[1549.60 - 1554.08] inside stuff you're getting it out of
[1551.12 - 1556.00] you so it's so important okay
[1554.08 - 1557.76] so i'm excited let's talk about the
[1556.00 - 1560.32] pre-cleanse
[1557.76 - 1563.92] information

[1711.84 - 1715.92] you got to keep the fats out now i know
[1713.84 - 1717.04] some of you guys don't know about
[1715.92 - 1718.24] like
[1717.04 - 1719.60] you don't know about medical medium
[1718.24 - 1722.84] information
[1719.60 - 1725.20] but it's not that almonds or
[1722.84 - 1726.64] tahini or
[1725.20 - 1730.24] avocado
[1726.64 - 1733.76] is not a healthy fat i'm not saying that
[1730.24 - 1736.80] they're better than grease and lard
[1733.76 - 1739.20] they're better than fried grease lard
[1736.80 - 1742.64] oil chicken fat
[1739.20 - 1744.16] they're better than fried chicken skin
[1742.64 - 1746.80] they're better than you know

[1746.80 - 1749.52] all that
[1748.16 - 1752.24] it's just that you won't be able to
[1749.52 - 1754.40] cleanse if you're doing all the fats you
[1752.24 - 1756.80] won't be there's fat and cacao there

[1786.48 - 1790.40] cleanse challenge you're not going to be
[1788.32 - 1793.04] doing fats no eggs in the morning that's
[1790.40 - 1795.12] another thing you won't do
[1793.04 - 1796.72] so we're not gonna do any eggs we're not
[1795.12 - 1799.28] gonna do any butter so we're not gonna
[1796.72 - 1802.40] have some eggs right
[1799.28 - 1805.28] okay for those babies
[1802.40 - 1807.36] you're not gonna have eggs
[1805.28 - 1810.32] not tomorrow morning
[1807.36 - 1813.28] by the way eggs aren't a healthy fat
[1810.32 - 1816.16] they are not a healthy fat
[1813.28 - 1816.96] almond butter's a healthy fat
[1816.16 - 1819.52] right
[1816.96 - 1821.52] cacao is not a healthy fat because it
[1819.52 - 1823.76] destroys your adrenals and it ages you
[1821.52 - 1825.68] quick and then boom you get aged much
[1823.76 - 1827.44] quicker than you should because the
[1825.68 - 1829.52] stuff just destroys your adrenals but
[1827.44 - 1831.04] that's another story don't get mad about
[1829.52 - 1832.80] the cacao if you guys like chocolate
[1831.04 - 1834.00] fine i'm you can have chocolate if
[1832.80 - 1836.00] that's what you like whatever what i'm
[1834.00 - 1838.08] just saying
[1836.00 - 1839.68] this is not a healthy fat eggs aren't a
[1838.08 - 1841.60] healthy fat but almond butter is a
[1839.68 - 1844.64] healthy fat tahini is a healthy fat
[1841.60 - 1846.64] right almonds cashews are a healthy fat
[1844.64 - 1849.60] coconut oil is a healthy fat olive oil
[1846.64 - 1852.64] is a healthy fat right
[1849.60 - 1855.12] so hemp seeds are a healthy fat pumpkin
[1852.64 - 1856.80] seeds are a healthy fat even sunflower
[1855.12 - 1858.16] seeds are a healthy fat because i know
[1856.80 - 1859.92] people are like no
[1858.16 - 1862.24] he doesn't know anything all the vegan
[1859.92 - 1865.04] doctors say too much the omega-6s in the
[1862.24 - 1867.44] sunflower oil
[1865.04 - 1870.56] sunflower seeds are a healthy fat
[1867.44 - 1872.32] compared to pork fat
[1870.56 - 1875.04] egg fat
[1872.32 - 1878.72] right bacon fat which is pork fat
[1875.04 - 1881.52] compared to a lot of bad fats right
[1878.72 - 1884.48] because of so many reads anyway
[1881.52 - 1886.72] that's really important to know so
[1884.48 - 1887.76] you guys won't be doing pork in the
[1886.72 - 1889.52] morning
[1887.76 - 1890.96] no bacon

[2149.20 - 2155.12] they're young
[2151.44 - 2155.12] but it's a snapshot in time
[2155.36 - 2159.28] do you ever see those old photos of like
[2157.60 - 2161.68] people in black and white
[2159.28 - 2163.28] in the 1930s they all look like they're
[2161.68 - 2164.88] all standing together and they all look
[2163.28 - 2167.28] miserable and it's kind of spooky and
[2164.88 - 2169.28] it's just a bunch of people like
[2167.28 - 2172.16] like you know it's a husband and a wife
[2169.28 - 2173.60] a couple of kids and aunt and uncle
[2172.16 - 2176.68] couple nephews whatever and they're all
[2173.60 - 2179.60] grouped together and it's 1932 or it's
[2176.68 - 2181.84] 1928 or it's 1919
[2179.60 - 2184.40] and you see that photo
[2181.84 - 2187.36] it's a snapshot in time
[2184.40 - 2191.28] but what you don't see is what happened
[2187.36 - 2192.64] to them all along the way
[2191.28 - 2195.12] you don't see
[2192.64 - 2196.88] what tumor grew in one of them
[2195.12 - 2198.96] you don't see
[2196.88 - 2201.44] okay would chronic illness are
[2198.96 - 2205.36] neurological disorder overcame one of
[2201.44 - 2206.56] them you don't see what stroke happened
[2205.36 - 2209.84] in them
[2206.56 - 2212.80] as the years went by you don't see the
[2209.84 - 2215.28] struggle and the suffering
[2212.80 - 2217.92] okay as
[2215.28 - 2219.60] they battled whatever it was that came
[2217.92 - 2222.72] their way
[2219.60 - 2224.72] or a snapshot in time when a dietitian
[2222.72 - 2227.04] functional medicine doctor nutritionist
[2224.72 - 2228.72] or anybody else sits there and says you
[2227.04 - 2231.04] don't need to cleanse and they're
[2228.72 - 2233.20] sitting there they're just a snapshot in
[2231.04 - 2235.04] time because what's going to happen is
[2233.20 - 2237.04] 10 years from now i'd like to see that
[2235.04 - 2238.56] dietitian that nutritionist that whoever
[2237.04 - 2239.92] it is that functional medicine doctor i
[2238.56 - 2242.00] want to see what happened along their
[2239.92 - 2243.92] journey did they get fibro really bad
[2242.00 - 2245.12] did they get hoshis did they get eczema
[2243.92 - 2246.80] did they have a stroke did they have a
[2245.12 - 2248.48] heart attack did they get cancer did
[2246.80 - 2250.48] they get als did they get multiple
[2248.48 - 2252.72] sclerosis what happened to them i want
[2250.48 - 2256.56] to know because guess what as the years
[2252.72 - 2259.76] go by it happens and people all get sick
[2256.56 - 2262.24] and it's a snapshot in time
[2259.76 - 2264.56] it's what it is
[2262.24 - 2266.32] charlenski says for the lemon water do
[2264.56 - 2268.48] you just cut lemons and put it in the
[2266.32 - 2269.60] water you could do that
[2268.48 - 2271.60] that's okay
[2269.60 - 2272.88] i'll show you how i do it too but you
[2271.60 - 2274.80] can definitely do that so i'm going to
[2272.88 - 2276.40] take this cup right here
[2274.80 - 2278.40] and i'll give you a quick run down this
[2276.40 - 2280.24] is just so you're ready for tomorrow so
[2278.40 - 2281.92] i'm going to cut this lemon in half and
[2280.24 - 2283.12] the details are in the cleanse the heel
[2281.92 - 2285.20] book so you're going to want i want to
[2283.12 - 2287.20] get the cleanse the heel book one way of
[2285.20 - 2289.28] doing it is just squeezing that half
[2287.20 - 2291.60] right in here like that
[2289.28 - 2294.08] and adding water that's one way to do it
[2291.60 - 2296.32] take a half squeeze it in and add water
[2294.08 - 2298.00] you want 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water
[2296.32 - 2300.72] on an empty stomach first thing in the
[2298.00 - 2302.40] morning because you want to flush
[2300.72 - 2304.08] you want to flush
[2302.40 - 2306.72] that liver
[2304.08 - 2310.24] you flush the liver and the lymphatic
[2306.72 - 2311.84] system starts to clean up
[2310.24 - 2313.28] you want to go after the lymphatic
[2311.84 - 2314.88] system with different things then you're
[2313.28 - 2318.64] going to miss out on the liver you want
[2314.88 - 2320.08] to get the liver that's where it's at
[2318.64 - 2321.92] right
[2320.08 - 2323.60] so you want to flush that liver in the
[2321.92 - 2325.28] morning so that's the lemon water right
[2323.60 - 2327.28] there
[2325.28 - 2329.84] so that's so i just want you prepared i
[2327.28 - 2331.68] want you ready for this
[2329.84 - 2333.28] someone says you don't need to cleanse
[2331.68 - 2334.96] they're a snapshot in time you don't
[2333.28 - 2336.08] know what's going to happen to them 10
[2334.96 - 2337.44] years from now you don't know what's
[2336.08 - 2338.64] going to happen to them 20 years from
[2337.44 - 2340.48] now
[2338.64 - 2342.96] and guess what they won't be held
[2340.48 - 2345.04] accountable for what they said 10 years
[2342.96 - 2347.84] or 20 years before and deterred a bunch
[2345.04 - 2349.52] of people into healing
[2347.84 - 2351.92] so
[2349.52 - 2353.68] they won't be held accountable doesn't
[2351.92 - 2355.04] matter if they stroke out 15 years from
[2353.68 - 2356.56] now does it matter if they take a
[2355.04 - 2358.00] medical treatment that finishes their
[2356.56 - 2360.08] life it doesn't matter if something else
[2358.00 - 2362.64] happens to them doesn't matter if
[2360.08 - 2364.72] whatever that does it
[2362.64 - 2367.52] they won't be held accountable for what
[2364.72 - 2370.48] they said 15 years before when they told
[2367.52 - 2372.80] 5000 people or 100 000 people you don't
[2370.48 - 2375.76] need a cleanse
[2372.80 - 2378.64] michaela says my teeth became sensitive
[2375.76 - 2381.52] to lemons and acid fruit in them
[2378.64 - 2383.60] in the month why can be
[2381.52 - 2386.16] so it's not the lemons it's not the acid
[2383.60 - 2388.96] fruit those are just letting you know
[2386.16 - 2390.56] something else is happening so so that's
[2388.96 - 2393.20] what that is
[2390.56 - 2395.36] so lemons and things like that that make
[2393.20 - 2398.00] you feel sensitive one thing is is it
[2395.36 - 2399.76] cold anything cold another thing too is
[2398.00 - 2402.72] nothing else makes you sensitive be your
[2399.76 - 2404.72] own detective so kind of like chart
[2402.72 - 2407.20] everything like what else kind of sets
[2404.72 - 2408.96] you off a little bit too right but what
[2407.20 - 2410.56] that means is it's not the lemon that
[2408.96 - 2411.92] causes the problem it's the lemon
[2410.56 - 2413.60] showcasing that you already have a
[2411.92 - 2416.24] sensitive nerve developing from
[2413.60 - 2418.72] something else from some other situation
[2416.24 - 2420.40] and so sensitive nerves trigeminal
[2418.72 - 2422.16] nerves facial nerves all these nerves
[2420.40 - 2424.72] that are actually all intertwined to our
[2422.16 - 2427.04] mouth or draw everything right cranial
[2424.72 - 2429.36] nerves that go through our mouth and jaw
[2427.04 - 2431.36] something's already happening there
[2429.36 - 2433.28] and lemon water is helpful for that
[2431.36 - 2436.80] situation even though it's setting off
[2433.28 - 2439.12] an alarm bell so that's how that works
[2436.80 - 2440.56] did you if you want to know
[2439.12 - 2442.48] what's going on with your health i mean
[2440.56 - 2443.92] just take a look at the book learn about
[2442.48 - 2446.08] all these things that causes all the
[2443.92 - 2448.64] problems right and that's important to
[2446.08 - 2450.24] know sandra says lemon tastes like eggs
[2448.64 - 2454.16] to me
[2450.24 - 2457.20] i hope you like the taste of eggs
[2454.16 - 2459.36] because lemon's so good for you
[2457.20 - 2461.76] tomorrow morning
[2459.36 - 2464.88] we're going to be doing lemon water
[2461.76 - 2466.80] we're going to be doing the celery juice
[2464.88 - 2468.32] okay
[2466.80 - 2469.68] we're going to talk about what foods you
[2468.32 - 2471.52] can eat
[2469.68 - 2474.72] right
[2471.52 - 2477.60] i'm going to juice some celery right now
[2474.72 - 2477.60] so i'm going to do that
[2478.00 - 2481.20] and
[2479.20 - 2485.60] you're going to do the celery juice
[2481.20 - 2489.12] 16 to 32 ounces try to get 32 ounces in
[2485.60 - 2491.44] if you can if you can't get 32 ounces in
[2489.12 - 2493.68] you can't get 32 ounces in
[2491.44 - 2498.16] try to get 16 ounces in if you can't get
[2493.68 - 2498.16] 32 ounces in so that's important to know
[2498.40 - 2503.04] if you guys just came on here this is
[2500.24 - 2504.88] the mm-900 hds it's on sale right now
[2503.04 - 2508.76] for two more days
[2504.88 - 2508.76] it's not just the juicer
[2508.80 - 2512.80] the reason why i endorse this model is
[2510.48 - 2514.64] because it saves you money
[2512.80 - 2516.96] and it doesn't have the metal gears
[2514.64 - 2519.36] grinding against each other
[2516.96 - 2521.44] so you get metal particles with all the
[2519.36 - 2523.04] other juicers
[2521.44 - 2525.20] so that's important
[2523.04 - 2527.60] the pulp comes out dry
[2525.20 - 2529.76] it comes out drier than other machines
[2527.60 - 2532.00] so you save that much more money when
[2529.76 - 2533.68] you're buying your celery
[2532.00 - 2537.84] okay
[2533.68 - 2537.84] that's important to know right there
[2538.88 - 2542.80] if you have a chronic condition
[2543.28 - 2549.44] this is one of the powerful tools to
[2546.80 - 2552.56] reversing it over time
[2549.44 - 2557.04] juicing celery is one of the powerful
[2552.56 - 2559.76] tools this is a medical device
[2557.04 - 2559.76] hold on guys

[2797.28 - 2800.64] on facebook youtube right link is in
[2799.28 - 2802.32] description
[2800.64 - 2803.92] people are asking me all the time what
[2802.32 - 2805.84] juicer is the best this one's the best
[2803.92 - 2808.08] because it's squeezing out all the juice
[2805.84 - 2810.56] and it's saving you money and right now
[2808.08 - 2812.40] food costs going up
[2810.56 - 2813.92] because the world is definitely a dark
[2812.40 - 2816.48] place so they're gonna make sure they
[2813.92 - 2818.00] jack up the food costs and the food
[2816.48 - 2820.48] costs are going to go up people have a
[2818.00 - 2822.16] hard time getting healthy
[2820.48 - 2824.24] they're going to try to buy cheaper food
[2822.16 - 2826.32] that makes them unhealthy
[2824.24 - 2829.12] that's just how the system is rigged
[2826.32 - 2830.88] it's rigged like that purposely
[2829.12 - 2833.36] and so
[2830.88 - 2835.12] that means you need to kind of supersede
[2833.36 - 2836.88] that so what i like about this juicer is
[2835.12 - 2838.96] it helps me supersede that because it's
[2836.88 - 2841.44] battling that saving you money and
[2838.96 - 2843.68] that's what i love right
[2841.44 - 2845.76] so yeah
[2843.68 - 2847.84] so

[3006.88 - 3011.20] it's on it's a cold pressed juicer
[3009.60 - 3013.36] doesn't have the metal gear so you're
[3011.20 - 3015.20] not getting metal particles over time
[3013.36 - 3017.44] and you're in your juice which is
[3015.20 - 3019.36] incredible right
[3017.44 - 3023.28] so what you'll notice here
[3019.36 - 3025.04] is that is the pulp right there
[3023.28 - 3027.28] juicers on sale for two more days i'm
[3025.04 - 3029.20] just letting you know almost 72 dollars
[3027.28 - 3031.76] off of megajuicers.com you have to get
[3029.20 - 3033.52] the mm 900 hds or you're not going to
[3031.76 - 3036.72] have this juicer
[3033.52 - 3038.72] it's that specific model right and what
[3036.72 - 3040.48] you're looking at right here is pulp in
[3038.72 - 3044.88] my fingertips
[3040.48 - 3045.84] and it's dry it's just slightly damp
[3044.88 - 3048.08] right
[3045.84 - 3048.08] in here
[3048.32 - 3052.00] there you go
[3049.44 - 3054.00] and it dries out quick too because it's
[3052.00 - 3056.40] just damp so what happens it just dries
[3054.00 - 3057.92] up and it starts to fall apart quick
[3056.40 - 3060.88] that's where you're saving your money
[3057.92 - 3062.48] with the mm-900 hds right there
[3060.88 - 3064.24] that's where you're saving it so when
[3062.48 - 3066.40] you run green i like to run greens
[3064.24 - 3068.24] through what i do is i take
[3066.40 - 3069.52] i take greens and i run that through
[3068.24 - 3070.96] sometimes too
[3069.52 - 3072.32] right
[3070.96 - 3074.08] but there you go
[3072.32 - 3076.80] that's the pulp it's dry that's the
[3074.08 - 3078.72] mm-900 so let's strain the cylinder
[3076.80 - 3082.48] juice you always want to strain it keep
[3078.72 - 3084.00] that in mind that's important
[3082.48 - 3086.00] because it's herbal medicine you're
[3084.00 - 3087.60] doing an extraction you don't want
[3086.00 - 3090.16] anything in there
[3087.60 - 3091.60] but the extraction itself so that's
[3090.16 - 3094.48] important to know right there so i'm
[3091.60 - 3094.48] going to move this over
[3095.04 - 3098.88] so let's get some celery juice going
[3106.40 - 3110.80] i got a friend saves all his cardboard
[3108.32 - 3113.04] boxes
[3110.80 - 3113.04] right
[3113.20 - 3116.40] because at home why don't you recycle
[3114.64 - 3119.84] them that's what i said i said why don't
[3116.40 - 3121.68] you recycle your cardboard boxes
[3119.84 - 3125.04] and my friend said
[3121.68 - 3127.12] no i save every last one of them okay
[3125.04 - 3130.00] so i save every last one of those
[3127.12 - 3132.56] cardboard boxes
[3130.00 - 3132.56] and go why
[3132.72 - 3135.04] you never know when you're gonna need
[3134.00 - 3135.92] one
[3135.04 - 3139.32] right
[3135.92 - 3139.32] you never know
[3140.64 - 3145.44] because i like to save things
[3143.68 - 3147.12] it's kind of like you aw you like to
[3145.44 - 3148.88] save lives
[3147.12 - 3150.88] because i like to save cardboard boxes
[3148.88 - 3153.68] you like to save lives that's what you
[3150.88 - 3155.28] do you know and
[3153.68 - 3156.88] so what i think about that when i even
[3155.28 - 3158.72] think about what he said
[3156.88 - 3160.40] it blows me away because it's not just
[3158.72 - 3162.96] about wanting to save lives and
[3160.40 - 3167.12] obviously that's why we're in this
[3162.96 - 3170.40] i mean right that's why we're in it but
[3167.12 - 3171.76] it's about saving organs
[3170.40 - 3173.28] it's about
[3171.76 - 3175.92] saving
[3173.28 - 3177.76] time with loved ones too you know so
[3175.92 - 3179.36] when you stick around longer on this
[3177.76 - 3182.40] planet because you cleanse and you
[3179.36 - 3184.16] restore and you bank minerals
[3182.40 - 3185.76] back into your organs and you bring
[3184.16 - 3188.88] yourself back
[3185.76 - 3190.64] you get more precious moments
[3188.88 - 3192.72] with maybe someone you meet that you
[3190.64 - 3194.96] would have never met because you lived
[3192.72 - 3197.44] long enough to meet them or precious
[3194.96 - 3200.00] moments with family members you actually
[3197.44 - 3201.84] get those precious moments saved because
[3200.00 - 3203.60] guess what you get more of them and you
[3201.84 - 3205.68] get more memories because your brain
[3203.60 - 3207.52] comes back and you get rid of all that
[3205.68 - 3209.04] alzheimer's that's starting up from your
[3207.52 - 3210.56] celery juice and you're cleansing and
[3209.04 - 3212.96] you're getting the poisons and toxins
[3210.56 - 3214.80] out right and so what happens is you get
[3212.96 - 3217.36] these precious moments
[3214.80 - 3219.92] and that's what you end up
[3217.36 - 3222.32] getting in the end is all those extra
[3219.92 - 3224.96] precious critical moments that your soul
[3222.32 - 3227.60] holds on to you so when you do die and
[3224.96 - 3229.28] leave this place your soul leaves and it
[3227.60 - 3231.04] leaves with all of these precious
[3229.28 - 3233.68] moments more precious moments and
[3231.04 - 3235.44] memories are in that soul of yours as
[3233.68 - 3239.20] it's floating out and leaving and
[3235.44 - 3242.16] propelling out of the solar system
[3239.20 - 3243.84] more time here on earth and more
[3242.16 - 3245.28] precious moments and if you're going
[3243.84 - 3247.28] through a struggle and a hardship right
[3245.28 - 3249.36] now what you're doing is you're working
[3247.28 - 3251.28] on healing yourself so that you stay
[3249.36 - 3253.04] here longer and so you can then meet
[3251.28 - 3255.12] somebody and because that's what happens
[3253.04 - 3259.12] our life changes all the time we end up
[3255.12 - 3262.84] seeing we meet new people in our life
[3259.12 - 3265.92] the journey changes to a whole different
[3262.84 - 3267.68] place and what happens is we've been
[3265.92 - 3269.92] able to kind of be a part of that
[3267.68 - 3271.28] transition making that happen by taking
[3269.92 - 3273.04] care of ourselves by cleansing and
[3271.28 - 3275.84] everything else
[3273.04 - 3277.52] staying here longer because of it
