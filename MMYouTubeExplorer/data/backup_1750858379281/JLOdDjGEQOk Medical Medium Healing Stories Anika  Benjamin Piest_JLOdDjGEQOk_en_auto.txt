[54.36 - 58.62] stories are powerful because they can
[56.55 - 61.35] help so many other people out there find
[58.62 - 63.57] their way and you know when you can't
[61.35 - 65.34] find answers and you know you're going
[63.57 - 69.00] to doctor the doctor and you feel that
[65.34 - 71.85] kind of hopelessness take over and you
[69.00 - 74.10] realize that you know you're really sick
[71.85 - 76.20] it's just it's so important to have a
[74.10 - 78.87] way out or to have information that
[76.20 - 82.05] makes sense and you know that's why I
[78.87 - 84.36] mean you guys are warriors really you
[82.05 - 86.97] are your health warriors you're here
[84.36 - 88.26] you're fighting for the people and
[86.97 - 90.69] that's what you're doing I mean I know
[88.26 - 95.85] I've seen your work out there it's the
[90.69 - 99.12] first time we've ever met which is
[95.85 - 100.74] really exciting all on its own and but
[99.12 - 104.01] I've watched your work on social media
[100.74 - 106.86] and how much you care about people and
[104.01 - 109.17] how invested you are about getting the
[106.86 - 111.27] message out so people can heal and and
[109.17 - 113.97] find the answers they need you guys
[111.27 - 116.34] really care yeah us I've always noticed
[113.97 - 120.48] I'm a big role model for us because you
[116.34 - 122.70] care for for the humanity and this is so
[120.48 - 125.31] important for us and we want to give the
[122.70 - 128.22] light to other people that they can
[125.31 - 132.72] actually heal because healing is is so
[128.22 - 133.90] so it's possible with the right kind of
[132.72 - 136.05] information yeah
[133.90 - 138.25] you know it's about empowerment and
[136.05 - 140.50] healing empowerment you know we get
[138.25 - 143.50] disempowered and I talk about that a lot
[140.50 - 145.48] lately is that you know when we're told
[143.50 - 147.91] their body's attacking itself and we're
[145.48 - 150.01] told that you know it's our genes and
[147.91 - 151.24] we're it's whole or creating it that's a
[150.01 - 153.28] whole nother thing do you ever hear that
[151.24 - 155.89] is that just me talking about that all
[153.28 - 157.57] the time but because I've always I heard
[155.89 - 159.55] that out there where people are like you
[157.57 - 161.41] know maybe I'm creating this with me you
[159.55 - 163.15] know with my mic my sickness because I'm
[161.41 - 166.06] thinking the wrong way did you go
[163.15 - 168.58] through that that was exactly what
[166.06 - 170.71] doctors told me so when I got to the
[168.58 - 177.37] doctor's office my first diagnosis was
[170.71 - 180.40] Hashimoto and emoto's and next psoriasis
[177.37 - 183.34] psoriasis at writers and artists writers
[180.40 - 186.01] came up well they always told me okay
[183.34 - 188.10] Anika your body is destroying yourself
[186.01 - 193.81] and you have to live with this and
[188.10 - 197.74] probably you will not be you will not be
[193.81 - 199.78] able to get an old age so you have to
[197.74 - 202.81] learn to live with this and you're
[199.78 - 204.82] servicing your mind has problem because
[202.81 - 207.19] you know you are sick and you're getting
[204.82 - 213.52] sicker because you think that you are
[207.19 - 215.11] sick so it was it was weird so we get
[213.52 - 217.57] told and that's what happens with women
[215.11 - 220.15] right now where we think women are
[217.57 - 222.19] empowered but yet they're disempowered
[220.15 - 224.38] in the worst worst way we could ever
[222.19 - 226.63] possibly imagine in our history right
[224.38 - 229.96] now which is their bodies and their
[226.63 - 231.91] health and so we it's like almost like a
[229.96 - 233.71] joke being played on everybody out there
[231.91 - 235.42] Alaura it's almost like no one wants to
[233.71 - 237.40] talk about this and it's spirit of
[235.42 - 239.53] compassion is is who gave me this
[237.40 - 241.99] information all these years you guys
[239.53 - 243.73] know I talk about that and and so and
[241.99 - 246.01] spirit of compassion always said to me
[243.73 - 248.35] women women this empowerment is going to
[246.01 - 251.20] be at its all-time high where we are now
[248.35 - 252.82] and that's unimaginable when you think
[251.20 - 254.32] about it because how is that possible
[252.82 - 257.20] how can we even think about that being
[254.32 - 259.00] that way but when we're told our bodies
[257.20 - 261.52] are too immense you when we're told our
[259.00 - 263.50] bodies are destroying itself our body's
[261.52 - 265.96] immune systems are attacking glands and
[263.50 - 267.59] organs and that you know and then and
[265.96 - 269.06] then it
[267.59 - 271.61] that's it since they don't have an
[269.06 - 272.78] answer for why you're sick they don't
[271.61 - 274.07] have an answer research and science
[272.78 - 276.41] doesn't have an answer it's not the
[274.07 - 278.45] doctors fault doctors are great but
[276.41 - 280.46] because they don't have the answer then
[278.45 - 283.25] all of a sudden people try to figure out
[280.46 - 285.56] well maybe it's a attraction maybe it's
[283.25 - 288.11] how we're thinking maybe it's we're
[285.56 - 289.97] manifesting it that is disastrous
[288.11 - 292.79] because that might be great for other
[289.97 - 294.83] things that aren't your body that might
[292.79 - 297.44] be okay for like I want to attract a
[294.83 - 299.24] good relationship I want to manifest a
[297.44 - 301.04] good relationship I want to manifest
[299.24 - 303.59] love I want to manifest this and what a
[301.04 - 305.78] manifest a good job a good career I want
[303.59 - 307.46] to manifest them that's great but when
[305.78 - 309.05] it comes down to health so when it comes
[307.46 - 311.45] down to why we're sick while we're going
[309.05 - 313.78] through so much when we feel like we do
[311.45 - 315.92] what we have all these symptoms it's
[313.78 - 318.41] disasterous to think that we may be
[315.92 - 319.88] manifest at that yeah and that's
[318.41 - 321.59] happening right now I'm seeing that all
[319.88 - 323.27] the time because research science
[321.59 - 325.13] doesn't have the answers everybody's
[323.27 - 327.02] running around sick and then you get
[325.13 - 329.30] healthier people who haven't been sick
[327.02 - 332.00] yet say to other women other young women
[329.30 - 334.76] like no you're just you're not you're
[332.00 - 336.92] not on your game right you're not you're
[334.76 - 339.50] not like connecting up there you're not
[336.92 - 341.24] spiritually connected because you're not
[339.50 - 343.37] doing what you're supposed to do and
[341.24 - 344.48] you're not like and that's disaster so
[343.37 - 345.89] that's a whole nother form of
[344.48 - 348.98] disempowerment I'm seeing growing
[345.89 - 350.24] rapidly because once again nobody has
[348.98 - 353.32] the answers to chronic illness
[350.24 - 356.30] absolutely I think you desperately
[353.32 - 360.44] empowered women so it's so important in
[356.30 - 363.02] our work not just physical level also on
[360.44 - 365.06] a mental mental level so Benjamin is
[363.02 - 369.17] icon is a psychologist and we are
[365.06 - 373.31] working a lot with some mental part of
[369.17 - 377.03] healing recovering people because of the
[373.31 - 379.91] wounds from your bodies destroying
[377.03 - 382.52] itself the wounds of being siccola got a
[379.91 - 383.90] loan of going through that because when
[382.52 - 386.21] you feel hopeless and you're in that
[383.90 - 387.50] place you get into a dark place people
[386.21 - 390.32] get into a dark post I've been watching
[387.50 - 392.24] that for 35 years and maybe even a
[390.32 - 392.81] little longer than that and so when I
[392.24 - 395.60] was little
[392.81 - 398.69] and you know this is our place you can
[395.60 - 401.20] go into and so I just knew you guys are
[398.69 - 404.45] doing amazing work that's why I had a
[401.20 - 407.51] you know I have to get them here it has
[404.45 - 411.83] to be the first episode of this season
[407.51 - 414.14] has to be you guys because you guys are
[411.83 - 416.06] you guys are world changers and and and
[414.14 - 417.35] that matters to me with the informations
[416.06 - 419.78] tell me a little bit about your story
[417.35 - 421.49] too and I know we're going a little bit
[419.78 - 424.22] into - you're going to different doctors
[421.49 - 427.16] and you're diagnosed with Hashimoto's
[424.22 - 430.34] you're diagnosed with with us right so
[427.16 - 432.92] this all started ten years ago when I
[430.34 - 434.84] was a young college student Benjamin and
[432.92 - 437.12] I were a young couple and we lived a
[434.84 - 440.08] fully flat laugh we were very happy and
[437.12 - 444.20] absolutely yeah
[440.08 - 446.51] then out of a sudden symptoms started I
[444.20 - 449.27] remember the date quite well went to the
[446.51 - 452.15] bus station and out of a sudden I got
[449.27 - 455.27] very dizzy and got something called
[452.15 - 457.01] brain fog today I know it is brain fog
[455.27 - 460.28] because you have a radio show about it
[457.01 - 462.35] and you talking you books about it and
[460.28 - 466.43] let me ask you for example here's all
[462.35 - 471.89] the information in about brain fog and
[466.43 - 473.66] this was such a hard symptom for me to
[471.89 - 478.22] live this because when you have brain
[473.66 - 481.07] fog you can't move through you your
[478.22 - 488.60] normal daily life your normal business
[481.07 - 491.27] I became awesome I also got a lot of
[488.60 - 495.26] symptoms neurological symptoms nag
[491.27 - 498.53] neurological fatigue tingling numbness
[495.26 - 501.41] and fatigue is the whole thing with that
[498.53 - 504.25] is that this medical meeting information
[501.41 - 507.05] it's neurological fatigue because
[504.25 - 508.97] doctors never put fatigue with
[507.05 - 511.49] neurological together before that never
[508.97 - 513.44] happened and either did research in
[511.49 - 515.33] science it's either your fatigue and
[513.44 - 517.55] that's it your fatigue but
[515.33 - 518.87] neurologically fatigue means that
[517.55 - 521.03] there's something going out the center
[518.87 - 523.64] that your central nervous system is
[521.03 - 526.40] having trouble and that's causing your
[523.64 - 527.78] fatigue and there's so much information
[526.40 - 529.85] I talk about that but so you have the
[527.78 - 534.88] neurological fatigue going on the tables
[529.85 - 538.22] and and and tiredness all day long
[534.88 - 540.83] yeah you had you had to do the mattress
[538.22 - 543.50] island thing I call it mattress island
[540.83 - 545.90] where we're you know we spend more time
[543.50 - 547.82] in bed than we want to that's right and
[545.90 - 549.98] that's hard that's hard for women
[547.82 - 553.67] because women and men too of course but
[549.98 - 554.78] it's hard for anyone to who wants to
[553.67 - 556.40] move and groove and they want to get
[554.78 - 557.75] things done they want to like work hard
[556.40 - 560.15] they want to survive they want and then
[557.75 - 563.72] you start feeling then you start feeling
[560.15 - 567.08] like well I'm not productive right my
[563.72 - 570.73] studies yeah I had to stop it and other
[567.08 - 578.45] symptoms man tinnitus how old are you 23
[570.73 - 589.34] 23 it's 10 years ago yes today so when
[578.45 - 591.86] everything today I'm 33 and begins 10
[589.34 - 594.26] years ago and I had tinnitus
[591.86 - 597.32] and flowers in my eyes and problem was
[594.26 - 600.20] my that was my vision so everything
[597.32 - 602.96] around me was just in a like brain
[600.20 - 608.96] focus and that's why why it's called
[602.96 - 611.72] right yeah it was it was a hard time but
[608.96 - 616.25] I am a lucky one because I have my my
[611.72 - 619.37] husband and he was on my side every
[616.25 - 621.28] every time on this on this journey and
[619.37 - 625.16] there's a tough losing but it's I
[621.28 - 627.47] learned so so much the last 10 years and
[625.16 - 630.02] after seven years of chronic illness and
[627.47 - 634.67] a bunch of symptoms I found your first
[630.02 - 642.08] book medical medium and I think is it is
[634.67 - 643.73] better than right it's a quite funny
[642.08 - 645.80] story actually because I came home from
[643.73 - 650.00] work and Anika was sitting on the couch
[645.80 - 652.76] and reading this blue book and looking
[650.00 - 654.89] with me looking to me was was tears in
[652.76 - 657.53] her eyes and and I recognized
[654.89 - 660.61] immediately that that aren't tears of
[657.53 - 664.31] sadness but I couldn't find the onions
[660.61 - 666.20] she mustered so as I was looking at all
[664.31 - 669.91] the onions where was it
[666.20 - 669.91] years came from but I couldn't find them
[671.59 - 677.00] just tears of joy and then she looked at
[674.42 - 680.57] me and said okay honey I finally found
[677.00 - 682.88] the answer yeah and this was was like
[680.57 - 686.99] and and I believe her immediately
[682.88 - 689.03] and we went through so hard times and
[686.99 - 692.81] and it was sometimes we were so
[689.03 - 697.46] desperate of looking for answers looking
[692.81 - 699.85] looking for solutions and but when when
[697.46 - 703.13] you looked at me I like okay Wow yeah
[699.85 - 706.58] give it a try when I read your book I
[703.13 - 709.85] know this is the truth this is not just
[706.58 - 712.97] an idea or opportunity in your
[709.85 - 716.96] opportunity I tried so many diets and
[712.97 - 720.17] lifestyle changes and therapies but I
[716.96 - 722.81] never saw it okay this is the answer but
[720.17 - 728.00] when I read your book everything makes
[722.81 - 731.90] sense you you gave me so much relief so
[728.00 - 734.21] from our heart for my entire being so
[731.90 - 737.41] from my perspective it was like Anika
[734.21 - 740.21] felt understood like finally someone
[737.41 - 742.04] understood her and it's not saying I'll
[740.21 - 744.98] you're you're making this with your mind
[742.04 - 747.68] or or you're overreacting
[744.98 - 750.26] your drama ring and stuff like that so
[747.68 - 752.69] finally you had some feeling that that
[750.26 - 755.15] you someone understood you yeah and
[752.69 - 757.67] that's a great thing in our daily work
[755.15 - 760.88] when we work with clients guiding them
[757.67 - 763.19] through their illnesses with your
[760.88 - 768.64] information the moment when they realize
[763.19 - 773.17] that their body is not destroying itself
[768.64 - 778.49] yeah yeah and that they are not that
[773.17 - 781.04] they have not that they have not sorry
[778.49 - 783.74] just have to find the right word that
[781.04 - 787.37] the illnesses are not their fault
[783.74 - 790.40] forward wasn't but then it is like magic
[787.37 - 792.11] happens and this is part of empowerment
[790.40 - 795.44] you're talking about this is so
[792.11 - 798.77] important to realize it's not your fault
[795.44 - 799.84] and you can do something against it you
[798.77 - 802.51] know what happens is
[799.84 - 804.31] but that was the plan that was the plan
[802.51 - 809.86] for a spirit of compassion so when I was
[804.31 - 812.05] writing that book you know it was it and
[809.86 - 814.54] I was taking down the information I was
[812.05 - 816.37] writing word-for-word with spirit of
[814.54 - 819.49] mash it was telling me that's right now
[816.37 - 820.63] in the words and you know it's like it
[819.49 - 823.06] made sense to me
[820.63 - 825.70] every Devery sentence was it made sense
[823.06 - 828.91] and I was like so this is going to speak
[825.70 - 831.07] to the ones that that need the answers
[828.91 - 834.58] and spirit clash was like that's the
[831.07 - 836.77] plan is that they see what they're
[834.58 - 839.47] really going through and there is a way
[836.77 - 841.21] out and that it that there I remember
[839.47 - 843.85] writing that your body doesn't attack
[841.21 - 846.28] itself and your immune system doesn't
[843.85 - 849.04] attack itself in that first book I
[846.28 - 853.48] remember writing sentence for me this
[849.04 - 854.35] was so oh my gosh what this is crazy i
[853.48 - 857.26] but in a good way
[854.35 - 860.29] that's perfect it's so helpful and this
[857.26 - 862.75] was so full of come compassion for me
[860.29 - 867.40] part of me a big part of me wishes that
[862.75 - 869.92] that I I had that book out years and
[867.40 - 872.62] years earlier like I was supposed to do
[869.92 - 874.21] and but the waiting lists in the

[932.49 - 938.22] and going to social media and looking
[935.10 - 942.00] for more input and informations and it's
[938.22 - 944.91] so so great so you are very well known
[942.00 - 946.92] in Germany right now that well that's
[944.91 - 949.26] incredible it truly is it's a it's a
[946.92 - 950.64] it's a dream because that's what I want
[949.26 - 952.59] I want I want people to have that
[950.64 - 954.48] information so when you found that book
[952.59 - 957.35] and you're reading and you're like oh my
[954.48 - 960.36] god this is truth this is the answer
[957.35 - 962.37] this is this is the information and then
[960.36 - 965.73] Benjamin and you came home and you start
[962.37 - 970.28] crying without on it so were you were
[965.73 - 973.41] you like oh no now we got all this work
[970.28 - 976.68] okay now we have this work to do to heal
[973.41 - 981.42] and but you guys I mean you you jumped
[976.68 - 983.88] into it yeah it's it's so nice to have a
[981.42 - 985.56] little bit more control because when
[983.88 - 987.72] someone is telling you your body is
[985.56 - 988.68] attacking yourself you feel out of
[987.72 - 993.03] control
[988.68 - 995.63] and when when and you gave me my my
[993.03 - 999.39] control back what's your information
[995.63 - 1002.87] know that for sure I have to be honest
[999.39 - 1006.59] healing and detoxing is not an easy way
[1002.87 - 1008.75] it's not like starting and a few days
[1006.59 - 1011.06] later you feeling like if you go on
[1008.75 - 1013.55] taking after it's not like taking a pill
[1011.06 - 1016.94] oh it is is this um you have work to do
[1013.55 - 1020.39] and but when you have faith and trust is
[1016.94 - 1024.05] in your body then you go for it and you
[1020.39 - 1026.33] will heal and this is just the most
[1024.05 - 1028.94] amazing thing I've ever done in my life
[1026.33 - 1032.33] to start this healing healing journey
[1028.94 - 1035.33] and to trust to trust you to just spirit
[1032.33 - 1037.25] to trust myself in my body and I want I
[1035.33 - 1040.79] want everybody to have their control
[1037.25 - 1042.23] back over their health and I know that
[1040.79 - 1044.00] when people aren't that sick and they
[1042.23 - 1046.82] haven't been there yet and they haven't
[1044.00 - 1049.28] been in the trenches where you were okay
[1046.82 - 1052.04] and they only have a little bit of acne
[1049.28 - 1053.93] which is no fun or they only have maybe
[1052.04 - 1055.61] a little bit of Aksum on it kind of
[1053.93 - 1057.32] comes and goes a little bit but they're
[1055.61 - 1059.72] able to go and they're able to work out
[1057.32 - 1061.46] every day and they're able to live their
[1059.72 - 1063.77] life and run around and get their coffee
[1061.46 - 1064.57] drinks and and they're able to get off a
[1063.77 - 1066.13] gluten
[1064.57 - 1067.96] and somebody gives them advice to do
[1066.13 - 1069.82] this and somebody clears up a little war
[1067.96 - 1071.26] they feel a little bit better here and
[1069.82 - 1073.81] there and they're not in that place
[1071.26 - 1075.58] they're not in that place they still
[1073.81 - 1078.97] feel like they got control as they play
[1075.58 - 1082.00] guessing games and and but when you get
[1078.97 - 1085.09] when when that shifts and stuff starts
[1082.00 - 1088.09] to catch up and and you start getting
[1085.09 - 1089.56] sick and things that like pathogens that
[1088.09 - 1091.69] people don't even know about or talk
[1089.56 - 1093.25] about or in your system that are in the
[1091.69 - 1095.08] medical medium book so people can learn
[1093.25 - 1096.76] and you learn and all of a sudden you're
[1095.08 - 1098.20] going to those doctors and you're really
[1096.76 - 1099.73] getting appointments and you're really
[1098.20 - 1102.58] and you're losing your in the fatigue
[1099.73 - 1104.32] and you're getting the brain fog and
[1102.58 - 1105.73] you're not able to do that workout in
[1104.32 - 1107.65] the gym for an hour and a half every day
[1105.73 - 1109.51] and you're not able to and you can't
[1107.65 - 1111.88] really think and you can't see you feel
[1109.51 - 1114.04] so fatigued once it goes then you just
[1111.88 - 1116.71] you realize that no we don't have
[1114.04 - 1119.20] control and I always tell people don't
[1116.71 - 1123.34] let it get to that point learn the
[1119.20 - 1125.74] information to where where you can heal
[1123.34 - 1127.93] and come back from such difficult times
[1125.74 - 1129.31] and struggles and what's what's
[1127.93 - 1131.89] disheartening out there and what I see
[1129.31 - 1133.33] is there's people that play around in
[1131.89 - 1135.52] the whole guessing game land because
[1133.33 - 1138.16] they're not really sick sick they really
[1135.52 - 1139.66] haven't gone into the having been
[1138.16 - 1141.37] through hell and back or anything
[1139.66 - 1143.80] they're just playing around and they're
[1141.37 - 1146.08] playing around and I understand that but
[1143.80 - 1146.71] it's sad because there's so much noise
[1146.08 - 1149.89] out there
[1146.71 - 1153.28] to play around with yeah so much yeah
[1149.89 - 1156.52] and people are realized this is the only
[1153.28 - 1159.75] information it's ever been out there he
[1156.52 - 1162.73] gets you out of the trenches was this
[1159.75 - 1164.89] originally and it wasn't just oh try

[1174.19 - 1180.85] this is this is the this is the heart of
[1177.96 - 1183.40] wait a minute it's way worse than that
[1180.85 - 1185.29] you know I I'm told my body is
[1183.40 - 1187.03] destroying itself I can't get out of bed
[1185.29 - 1192.22] I'm on mattress island i'm on couch
[1187.03 - 1194.71] island and i don't have control and in
[1192.22 - 1197.23] your you're somebody that fought your
[1194.71 - 1198.23] way back you found information you
[1197.23 - 1201.77] fought your way back
[1198.23 - 1203.66] back in ensure okay sure the books are
[1201.77 - 1207.71] there the information set but it takes
[1203.66 - 1209.60] also somebody to be like you know I'm I
[1207.71 - 1211.52] gotta I gotta do this
[1209.60 - 1213.86] I'm tired this I don't want to live like
[1211.52 - 1216.38] this anymore see so you're liking you're
[1213.86 - 1218.36] a hero you need to use it you need to
[1216.38 - 1221.06] use the information it's not enough that
[1218.36 - 1223.76] the information is there you need to
[1221.06 - 1226.70] read it and to reread it and to think
[1223.76 - 1229.85] about it and to live with it and this is
[1226.70 - 1234.23] what I did I not only read your books
[1229.85 - 1238.22] once I read it I read them quite a few
[1234.23 - 1242.66] times and sometimes I reread some some
[1238.22 - 1243.50] pages because I always find another a
[1242.66 - 1245.93] new thing
[1243.50 - 1247.82] when a new and you think when I read
[1245.93 - 1252.26] different places and you can actually
[1247.82 - 1256.01] this is the magical trainer yes and I
[1252.26 - 1259.19] think this is a magical thing about your
[1256.01 - 1262.57] books I found answers for all my
[1259.19 - 1266.36] symptoms and I had a list it was so long
[1262.57 - 1269.54] just symptoms from literally from head
[1266.36 - 1273.50] to toe nearly every part of my body had
[1269.54 - 1276.71] at least one symptoms and I found
[1273.50 - 1279.74] answers for every single symptom in your
[1276.71 - 1282.29] book and the connection between them and
[1279.74 - 1285.98] everything makes sense and this was so
[1282.29 - 1288.08] Wow absolutely mind-blowing what's
[1285.98 - 1290.03] important to have answers to all the
[1288.08 - 1292.07] different symptoms to like why is the
[1290.03 - 1294.49] symptom there what's causing the symptom
[1292.07 - 1297.08] because that's not anywhere else and
[1294.49 - 1298.94] it's just not there research and science
[1297.08 - 1300.98] doesn't have it for anyone they just
[1298.94 - 1303.86] don't have any answers it's your genes
[1300.98 - 1307.58] are bad or your body's destroying itself
[1303.86 - 1309.38] or if you go in kind of the new-age area
[1307.58 - 1312.71] that all like and you're not spiritually
[1309.38 - 1315.38] connected your your manifesting it wrong
[1312.71 - 1318.13] and that's why that's why your sake we
[1315.38 - 1321.80] can't accept that that's not acceptable
[1318.13 - 1324.35] it's not supposed to be okay to be the
[1321.80 - 1326.84] new normal for every single person have
[1324.35 - 1328.64] a symptom or five symptoms your case
[1326.84 - 1331.73] like 15 symptoms
[1328.64 - 1334.97] maybe even more and it's not it's not
[1331.73 - 1339.14] right to have to live like that
[1334.97 - 1341.93] and so look you know what I love is I
[1339.14 - 1343.28] love it that that you've you've come
[1341.93 - 1345.11] this far okay
[1343.28 - 1348.80] and I love that you're doing the work
[1345.11 - 1357.19] you're doing and I love all of that and
[1348.80 - 1362.09] I love how your you know your that that
[1357.19 - 1364.52] spiritual power in a way that is the
[1362.09 - 1367.79] guide for people and I see it that way
[1364.52 - 1370.07] it's like well if I was ever sick if I
[1367.79 - 1373.46] was ever sick if I was ever down and out
[1370.07 - 1375.77] if I was ever struggling if I was just
[1373.46 - 1379.61] if I was stuck in that place of not
[1375.77 - 1382.97] having control and you are like Anthony
[1379.61 - 1385.70] their third there are answers and you
[1382.97 - 1390.53] put your hand out I would just be like
[1385.70 - 1392.66] yeah just get me out of this and yes
[1390.53 - 1396.08] you're doing for people I yeah I hope so
[1392.66 - 1400.34] and I do this because it's so it's so
[1396.08 - 1402.38] it's an important work and yeah so thank
[1400.34 - 1406.04] you very much and what I realized is
[1402.38 - 1408.76] when you live this way with a clean diet
[1406.04 - 1414.23] who has a lot of fruits and veggies and
[1408.76 - 1416.15] when you're detoxing your spiritual your
[1414.23 - 1417.83] spirituality I saw before the
[1416.15 - 1418.73] pronouncing I hope you guys understand
[1417.83 - 1425.06] me
[1418.73 - 1428.57] is is clear clearer so you have a better
[1425.06 - 1433.91] contact to the spirituality I hope you
[1428.57 - 1435.20] understand what I want you I need you
[1433.91 - 1440.60] had all these books and everything bring
[1435.20 - 1444.41] you spiritual and I'm like okay I'm
[1440.60 - 1447.50] hearing a voice from up here giving me
[1444.41 - 1449.81] advance medical information and also
[1447.50 - 1451.91] other information I'm writing it down in
[1449.81 - 1453.74] here I don't know if I'm spiritual I
[1451.91 - 1455.33] don't know what you would call it what
[1453.74 - 1457.94] do you mean because people say what how
[1455.33 - 1460.91] are you really spiritual though and well
[1457.94 - 1463.43] I'm getting the information from up here
[1460.91 - 1469.43] I don't know if that accounts for being
[1463.43 - 1472.91] spiritual because I'm not doing the
[1469.43 - 1475.04] spiritual talk that's maybe trending so
[1472.91 - 1477.05] much you know where everybody's doing
[1475.04 - 1478.70] the spiritual vibe or a spiritual talk
[1477.05 - 1480.26] that's trending so much and I'm not like
[1478.70 - 1482.21] gee I'm not I'm always talking about
[1480.26 - 1486.50] illness and sickness and people
[1482.21 - 1488.15] struggling and and because I feel that
[1486.50 - 1491.77] that's the most spiritual place you
[1488.15 - 1494.48] could ever go is someone's struggle
[1491.77 - 1496.31] there because you lose your spirit when
[1494.48 - 1498.56] you're sick right so I don't know
[1496.31 - 1500.69] anything more spiritual than that where
[1498.56 - 1502.43] you're sick you're not feeling good
[1500.69 - 1504.23] you're your there's a part of you you're
[1502.43 - 1507.11] losing you're feeling like you're losing
[1504.23 - 1509.39] you get the hopelessness for so many
[1507.11 - 1511.55] people going through it your spirits
[1509.39 - 1513.44] breaking down I've had people come to me
[1511.55 - 1516.08] over the years when they get a chance to
[1513.44 - 1517.28] talk to me all these years ago and they
[1516.08 - 1520.67] would get a chance to talk to me and
[1517.28 - 1523.46] they'd be like my spirits broken yeah my
[1520.67 - 1525.76] spirit is broken and so I don't think
[1523.46 - 1529.67] there's anything more spiritual than
[1525.76 - 1531.76] getting somebody's life back because
[1529.67 - 1534.77] it's not about a spiritual mumbo-jumbo
[1531.76 - 1536.75] or still like it's not like spiritual
[1534.77 - 1538.70] trending words or anything it's about
[1536.75 - 1541.58] when you get your life back there's
[1538.70 - 1545.24] nothing more spiritually powerful than
[1541.58 - 1548.87] that yes because we all have souls well
[1545.24 - 1551.30] we work we're spiritual beings here
[1548.87 - 1553.76] doesn't matter how we kind of cookie cut
[1551.30 - 1556.64] it or how we dress it up or how we gloss
[1553.76 - 1560.21] it up or what's trending or how we talk
[1556.64 - 1564.08] it's about worse more spiritual beings
[1560.21 - 1565.67] and when we're losing our lives and
[1564.08 - 1566.84] we're in that dark place and we're in
[1565.67 - 1568.82] that dark hopelessness and we're
[1566.84 - 1571.28] suffering and we're struggling and our
[1568.82 - 1572.90] spirits are broken and I mean I people
[1571.28 - 1575.21] tell me that over the years this is what
[1572.90 - 1578.81] it feels like and you come back from
[1575.21 - 1582.98] that that's spiritual empowerment that's
[1578.81 - 1586.25] that's what that is and you know and and
[1582.98 - 1588.47] I've had people come back from from the
[1586.25 - 1591.44] depths of of despair from healing like
[1588.47 - 1593.30] with you from from being sick and and
[1591.44 - 1594.95] you become my spiritually
[1593.30 - 1597.50] do you feel like do you feel it's that
[1594.95 - 1600.32] tool away to you like it's almost like I
[1597.50 - 1602.18] get a new chance yeah absolutely there's
[1600.32 - 1605.15] something about that having that new
[1602.18 - 1608.18] chance is a new chance and you wrote it
[1605.15 - 1612.19] so so wonderful in one of your books you
[1608.18 - 1614.90] said that we have a part of our soul so
[1612.19 - 1619.18] upwards in the universe behind the Stars
[1614.90 - 1624.62] and that even if we are so so broken and
[1619.18 - 1627.44] feel so emotional tired and lost that we
[1624.62 - 1633.01] can connect with this part of our soul
[1627.44 - 1640.43] and when I read that I stood outside
[1633.01 - 1643.52] looking to the Stars and cried now that
[1640.43 - 1645.80] that we have the the heel part of our
[1643.52 - 1647.75] soul to connect this yeah it gets me
[1645.80 - 1650.30] choked up and because they remember when
[1647.75 - 1652.85] spirit of compassion told me that and so
[1650.30 - 1655.22] I put it in the book and and I remember
[1652.85 - 1657.13] when spirit compassion told me that long
[1655.22 - 1660.11] before I even put it in in the book
[1657.13 - 1664.31] because I would tell people I would say
[1660.11 - 1665.72] you if if you feel you're in that place
[1664.31 - 1667.94] right now people would come to me so
[1665.72 - 1669.11] sick and I'd say look I just want you to
[1667.94 - 1671.81] look at the Stars
[1669.11 - 1674.78] and I want you to know that there's a
[1671.81 - 1678.76] there's a part of your soul that stays
[1674.78 - 1681.53] protective up there in those stars
[1678.76 - 1684.14] behind those stars and there's a part of
[1681.53 - 1687.38] you that stays protected it's there for
[1684.14 - 1689.87] a reason because we get broken down here
[1687.38 - 1691.73] we go through betrayal we go through the
[1689.87 - 1693.02] trust to breakage we grow when when
[1691.73 - 1694.16] someone breaks your trust when someone
[1693.02 - 1695.75] stabs you in the back when somebody
[1694.16 - 1697.76] betrays you when someone hurts you and
[1695.75 - 1701.03] someone if we go through so much
[1697.76 - 1703.70] different kind of letdowns here from
[1701.03 - 1705.20] emotional upsets and breakups and all
[1703.70 - 1707.21] kinds of things that we have
[1705.20 - 1708.68] relationship people that people go
[1707.21 - 1710.47] through problems and all these things
[1708.68 - 1713.51] kick just if you like it wrecks you
[1710.47 - 1717.29] there's a part of your soul that stays
[1713.51 - 1720.05] untouched and free from all of that way
[1717.29 - 1722.18] up spirit of compassion told me and you
[1720.05 - 1723.71] just have to look up you have to look up
[1722.18 - 1724.31] behind those stars and you know it's
[1723.71 - 1726.56] there
[1724.31 - 1728.99] for you and connect with it and that's
[1726.56 - 1731.81] gonna give you that extra power to start
[1728.99 - 1734.38] that battery power in your soul and in
[1731.81 - 1736.46] your spirit to start bringing you back
[1734.38 - 1739.31] while you're working on your healing
[1736.46 - 1742.70] process I remember this was a long time
[1739.31 - 1744.41] before and we read your books was when I
[1742.70 - 1748.27] was back in New Zealand and I had this
[1744.41 - 1753.47] bad bad injury and I almost died was was
[1748.27 - 1756.32] bleeding brain and I'm during this time
[1753.47 - 1760.16] before that happened one of my greatest
[1756.32 - 1763.34] fears was always death not dying but
[1760.16 - 1767.48] death and then I got this experience and
[1763.34 - 1771.01] I almost died and the doctors in Germany
[1767.48 - 1776.96] couldn't understand how I survived and
[1771.01 - 1779.33] it was so funny but and and but but what
[1776.96 - 1780.92] happened was like that it was like I was
[1779.33 - 1783.53] staying there in front of the door
[1780.92 - 1785.81] knocking and and someone said no not
[1783.53 - 1789.56] soon it's not your time and this really
[1785.81 - 1792.29] changed my thinking about Wow and it was
[1789.56 - 1793.88] amazing and this was was before we read
[1792.29 - 1795.98] your books and then your books came and
[1793.88 - 1798.32] it was again like wow yes it's right
[1795.98 - 1801.92] what what you experienced this is real
[1798.32 - 1813.14] yeah that's incredible that's a powerful
[1801.92 - 1814.16] story going to near-death and doctors
[1813.14 - 1819.17] wondering if you're gonna make it
[1814.16 - 1821.24] exactly I you know what I wanted to ask
[1819.17 - 1823.67] you guys like your foods and supplements
[1821.24 - 1824.81] and you're doing things like that so
[1823.67 - 1826.64] what are you doing for the foods I mean
[1824.81 - 1831.08] I have a heavy metal detox ability of
[1826.64 - 1833.39] course always in front of me juice is so
[1831.08 - 1837.25] important for us because when we started
[1833.39 - 1841.01] with celery juice it was three years ago
[1837.25 - 1844.70] the first thing we realized was the
[1841.01 - 1847.97] Benjamin get rid of his exit reflux so
[1844.70 - 1851.54] the celery juice accelerate roses was
[1847.97 - 1853.58] the first change in our diet the celery
[1851.54 - 1856.67] juice and he had
[1853.58 - 1861.59] bad exit reflux for his entire life
[1856.67 - 1863.78] since childhood and in as a child you
[1861.59 - 1867.77] saw it is quite normal to have such
[1863.78 - 1870.83] burning in your throat right no I think
[1867.77 - 1873.92] I I told my parents when I was 16 or so
[1870.83 - 1878.81] and but I experienced I think the first
[1873.92 - 1880.40] time I remember it was was 5 and since I
[1878.81 - 1882.68] said okay we need to do something we
[1880.40 - 1892.19] need to do a gastro and send I looked
[1882.68 - 1895.64] and said today this yeah and and yeah
[1892.19 - 1897.32] and I took pills so long and I always
[1895.64 - 1900.88] had the feelings it's not right it's not
[1897.32 - 1904.25] right and even when I was studying
[1900.88 - 1907.01] nursing I it was like oh my god I can't
[1904.25 - 1909.26] take such pills anymore cuz what am i
[1907.01 - 1911.63] what am i doing I'm it's just trying my
[1909.26 - 1913.97] whole guts was this pills and I didn't
[1911.63 - 1915.92] want to do it anymore and finally it was
[1913.97 - 1920.93] amazing you know your whole life
[1915.92 - 1922.46] spending with having reflux or knowing
[1920.93 - 1925.40] that you're doing something better your
[1922.46 - 1928.16] body and was kind of a big relief
[1925.40 - 1929.84] business celery juice and well how long
[1928.16 - 1934.04] did you do the soul just before it start
[1929.84 - 1936.86] easing up a few weeks I think I was so
[1934.04 - 1939.26] fast and so it's very fast so we changed
[1936.86 - 1942.26] a little bit more we cut off for no food
[1939.26 - 1947.11] so everything that feed viruses and
[1942.26 - 1951.92] bacteria we cut off so X and diary and
[1947.11 - 1954.35] gluten and because I thought okay there
[1951.92 - 1957.08] are these box viruses and bacteria and
[1954.35 - 1961.19] they are making me sick and I don't want
[1957.08 - 1964.31] to feed them one day longer so this was
[1961.19 - 1968.06] my decision and so I cut off the no
[1964.31 - 1970.52] foods you know the people say well how
[1968.06 - 1972.74] can X be bad for you everybody's still
[1970.52 - 1974.33] being told to eat eggs they're so like
[1972.74 - 1976.22] you know it had some women are being
[1974.33 - 1977.60] told every day young women just eat eggs
[1976.22 - 1980.03] make sure you get your protein make sure
[1977.60 - 1982.88] you get your healthy here healthy eggs
[1980.03 - 1984.25] in you and all the stuff and it's really
[1982.88 - 1987.25] sad because
[1984.25 - 1989.53] eggs actually feed everything that makes
[1987.25 - 1991.90] us sick the reason why were six these
[1989.53 - 1993.61] pathogens and you know so when I did
[1991.90 - 1999.76] with with the new cleanse the heal book
[1993.61 - 2002.10] coming out i I really pushed spirit of
[1999.76 - 2003.87] compassion really hard with the new
[2002.10 - 2005.61] cleansing heal book so this is this is
[2003.87 - 2008.70] actually that this isn't a book it's
[2005.61 - 2011.31] simple this is mine did my copy which is
[2008.70 - 2014.16] the manuscript I'm editing right here
[2011.31 - 2016.65] this is and but it's it's on Amazon if
[2014.16 - 2017.79] you want to find it um cleanse the heal
[2016.65 - 2020.79] it's coming out soon
[2017.79 - 2022.89] but anyway so what I did was I really
[2020.79 - 2026.28] pushed spirit of compassion hard I said
[2022.89 - 2030.24] I want all the information you can give
[2026.28 - 2033.30] me on why eggs are hurting us and why we
[2030.24 - 2035.28] need to stay away from them because you
[2033.30 - 2038.13] know a shirt you told me it feeds
[2035.28 - 2040.65] pathogens I want all of this information
[2038.13 - 2042.33] so people can be armed and they can be
[2040.65 - 2044.58] protected and they can have that shield
[2042.33 - 2046.77] of protection to know that if they're
[2044.58 - 2048.48] dealing with brain fog and you know
[2046.77 - 2050.19] tinkles of numbness fibromyalgia
[2048.48 - 2052.20] Hashimoto's and actually psoriasis
[2050.19 - 2055.86] whatever it is that you don't want to do
[2052.20 - 2059.76] eggs so it's really critical that you
[2055.86 - 2061.53] don't do eggs and so spirit gave me so
[2059.76 - 2063.99] much information about eggs and why we
[2061.53 - 2065.94] shouldn't be eating them and it I love
[2063.99 - 2067.65] eggs it's not even like it's not even
[2065.94 - 2069.48] like I hate them or anything like that I
[2067.65 - 2070.83] don't and people people are like way to
[2069.48 - 2072.30] me you must have Lee system you just
[2070.83 - 2076.97] don't like them or something no that's
[2072.30 - 2076.97] not it they taste really really good
[2078.68 - 2086.06] that's the whole problem and it's a
[2081.41 - 2088.59] man-made thing right because we used
[2086.06 - 2090.99] they used them in the last yes what
[2088.59 - 2092.10] that's what that's that's what research
[2090.99 - 2093.54] in science that's what the
[2092.10 - 2096.81] pharmaceutical companies did they took
[2093.54 - 2099.33] eggs a survival food that kept people
[2096.81 - 2101.22] alive in so many situations around the
[2099.33 - 2103.56] world because they were an important
[2101.22 - 2106.02] food and they took that food and they
[2103.56 - 2108.57] used it as a fuel source for pathogens
[2106.02 - 2111.87] they raised in the lab back eighty years
[2108.57 - 2115.03] ago ninety years ago like 80 years like
[2111.87 - 2117.55] 70 80 years ago all in that realm
[2115.03 - 2119.29] and they still they still use them and
[2117.55 - 2120.64] no one knows about it they don't talk
[2119.29 - 2122.29] about it and no one gets that
[2120.64 - 2123.97] information so what happens is when you
[2122.29 - 2125.98] have the epstein-barr causing your
[2123.97 - 2129.01] neurological fatigue your aches and
[2125.98 - 2130.75] pains your eczema your psoriasis your
[2129.01 - 2133.33] Hashimoto's your thyroid problems your
[2130.75 - 2134.62] your fibromyalgia your your all these
[2133.33 - 2136.84] different things are the shingles fires
[2134.62 - 2138.85] causing your trigeminal neuralgia and
[2136.84 - 2139.96] your neuropathy all these different
[2138.85 - 2143.23] things that people are dealing with
[2139.96 - 2144.73] every day then you eat eggs you're just
[2143.23 - 2145.90] feeding that bug you're feeding that
[2144.73 - 2147.85] epstein-barr you're feeding that
[2145.90 - 2150.43] shingles virus and it's going to town
[2147.85 - 2154.12] it's it's eating it's it's staying
[2150.43 - 2157.72] strong and you stay sick and you know
[2154.12 - 2161.28] it's amazing how you know the people are
[2157.72 - 2161.28] so emotionally connected to eggs and I
[2163.74 - 2172.03] read your books I ate just eggs and meat
[2169.12 - 2175.21] and diary prologue says this was my diet
[2172.03 - 2177.79] because bacon eggs and bacon and doctors
[2175.21 - 2180.70] told me you have to stay away from fruit
[2177.79 - 2184.30] so the fruit fear was going around and
[2180.70 - 2189.21] this was the worst thing I think about
[2184.30 - 2194.77] my diet no fruit no a lot of fat and no
[2189.21 - 2198.31] very rare red veggies just meat eggs and
[2194.77 - 2201.42] it was like it worked for for Buffett I
[2198.31 - 2204.58] guess when we were just just diet like
[2201.42 - 2205.48] some Munson's and my whole system
[2204.58 - 2207.94] collapsed
[2205.48 - 2209.55] well the reason why there what happens
[2207.94 - 2213.76] is when you go off of processed foods
[2209.55 - 2215.91] and and you just go on say eggs meat
[2213.76 - 2218.38] dairy you're gonna feel a little better
[2215.91 - 2220.15] you are because you're all for processed
[2218.38 - 2222.37] foods it's just so just say somebody
[2220.15 - 2224.32] wasn't as sick as you and they just had
[2222.37 - 2226.81] a little bit of eczema a little bit of
[2224.32 - 2228.94] brain fog once in a while maybe maybe
[2226.81 - 2231.94] they just didn't feel like they had that
[2228.94 - 2234.85] much energy or they had some acne and
[2231.94 - 2236.35] there then then there they're told stay
[2234.85 - 2238.39] off of processed foods but make sure you
[2236.35 - 2239.47] keep your eggs in there soon as they get
[2238.39 - 2240.58] off the processed foods you're gonna
[2239.47 - 2242.77] start feeling better and they think they
[2240.58 - 2244.18] found the Holy Grail they think that oh
[2242.77 - 2246.04] wait a minute could still have some eggs
[2244.18 - 2248.14] still have some of this don't have some
[2246.04 - 2248.56] salmon still have you know lots of nuts
[2248.14 - 2250.27] and sea
[2248.56 - 2251.77] seeds still have some peanuts the seeds
[2250.27 - 2253.21] are healthy but having a lot of them is
[2251.77 - 2255.67] not really a good idea you can still
[2253.21 - 2258.70] have all these different high-fat foods
[2255.67 - 2261.40] or you can still have some cheese
[2258.70 - 2263.77] healthy cheese some yogurt some he can
[2261.40 - 2264.76] still have these things and then what
[2263.77 - 2267.40] happens is what they don't realize
[2264.76 - 2268.93] though is that they'll get a little bit
[2267.40 - 2272.71] better they'll start feeling a little
[2268.93 - 2274.69] bit better and then all of a sudden you
[2272.71 - 2276.64] know things can take a turn down the
[2274.69 - 2278.32] road or they'll just stay in that
[2276.64 - 2280.27] guessing game area where they can get
[2278.32 - 2281.95] away with just eating the trendy diet
[2280.27 - 2283.87] keeping eggs and but when you're
[2281.95 - 2285.34] somebody that really high and it can get
[2283.87 - 2287.92] you in trouble go down a road you start
[2285.34 - 2289.09] getting a little older and then it hits
[2287.92 - 2290.83] and you start getting all your heart
[2289.09 - 2292.45] palpitations and eat camp you know
[2290.83 - 2294.70] office and live your life and you get
[2292.45 - 2296.92] all these other things but with you you
[2294.70 - 2298.54] were really at this place where you had
[2296.92 - 2300.70] a lot of a lot of stuff going on like
[2298.54 - 2302.52] millions of people do millions of women
[2300.70 - 2306.40] do they have all these symptoms okay
[2302.52 - 2308.47] and you you went off the processed food
[2306.40 - 2310.57] and you just you kept your diet really
[2308.47 - 2312.88] clean like doctors wanna you kept like
[2310.57 - 2314.35] the eggs you kept the bacon in there you
[2312.88 - 2317.20] kept right and you noticed a difference
[2314.35 - 2319.39] you were feeling a little bit better yes
[2317.20 - 2323.41] when everybody goes on their keto diet
[2319.39 - 2327.01] there are Paleo diet and when you eat
[2323.41 - 2330.37] such yes high-fat diets you produce so
[2327.01 - 2333.63] much adrenaline and this is why you feel
[2330.37 - 2336.46] a little bit better I think um yeah and
[2333.63 - 2339.16] this was a first step for me cutting out
[2336.46 - 2341.95] the no foods drinking celery juice and
[2339.16 - 2344.77] the heavy-metal detox smoothie was was
[2341.95 - 2347.80] very important because because I had so
[2344.77 - 2351.24] so many heavy metals and my body
[2347.80 - 2355.24] floating around they play a huge part in
[2351.24 - 2357.13] this brain fog and so I started very
[2355.24 - 2361.36] slowly with the heavy metal detox
[2357.13 - 2364.27] smoothie on a daily base and yeah we
[2361.36 - 2368.53] still drink it every day it was full
[2364.27 - 2371.56] amounts of every ingredient and I think
[2368.53 - 2373.93] that's the most important part yes you
[2371.56 - 2376.78] started and I just followed yeah and
[2373.93 - 2379.00] what we experienced was that I could
[2376.78 - 2381.44] handle more than you could yeah you for
[2379.00 - 2384.62] example was the celery juice as well as
[2381.44 - 2387.26] heavy-metal detox smoothie and I just
[2384.62 - 2389.78] followed and I had my own to be honest
[2387.26 - 2392.42] my up and downs might a few transaction
[2389.78 - 2397.16] costs because I I wasn't coming from
[2392.42 - 2398.90] this bad situation as Annika was so and
[2397.16 - 2401.66] this is a funny thing about your mind
[2398.90 - 2405.89] cause because I just experienced that I
[2401.66 - 2407.96] felt better quite fast and then this
[2405.89 - 2412.88] little man in my head was like oh yeah
[2407.96 - 2430.64] now you can try it again go back to your
[2412.88 - 2434.00] own behavior and I needed some you asked
[2430.64 - 2438.91] about supplements so I take a lot to be
[2434.00 - 2441.77] honest I took a lot and I take a lot and
[2438.91 - 2445.37] my favorite supplements lemon balm
[2441.77 - 2448.25] because lemon born always grounded me on
[2445.37 - 2450.47] an emotional level and it helps my
[2448.25 - 2453.26] nervous system because when you have a
[2450.47 - 2456.02] problem so this is just my opinion but
[2453.26 - 2459.62] when you had a problem with your nervous
[2456.02 - 2462.14] system for such a long period of time
[2459.62 - 2462.77] then this is nothing that changed
[2462.14 - 2466.79] overnight
[2462.77 - 2469.85] so I'm three years on this journey right
[2466.79 - 2473.33] now with your information and I healed a
[2469.85 - 2476.51] lot so I never thought three years ago
[2473.33 - 2479.36] that I will ever reach such a healthy
[2476.51 - 2481.46] state for me in my body you know what's
[2479.36 - 2483.26] amazing is you guys do just the medical
[2481.46 - 2484.70] medium information you don't mix it up
[2483.26 - 2486.95] you're not adding in the apple cider
[2484.70 - 2488.93] vinegar you're not you know you're not
[2486.95 - 2490.10] adding in the collagen you're not adding
[2488.93 - 2493.07] in all these other things you're not
[2490.10 - 2494.84] mixing it up we're we're including
[2493.07 - 2497.00] changing up foods and doing this where
[2494.84 - 2498.11] you're getting all this misinformation
[2497.00 - 2499.94] on the Internet
[2498.11 - 2502.04] you guys are sticking with this
[2499.94 - 2503.96] information here that the the
[2502.04 - 2506.38] information that's swapping the internet
[2503.96 - 2508.99] that's both good and bad
[2506.38 - 2511.30] is is a compilation of just guessing
[2508.99 - 2512.89] games that are man-made and I always try
[2511.30 - 2516.13] to tell people this because someone will
[2512.89 - 2517.83] say to me why do I want medical medium
[2516.13 - 2520.56] information why would I want your
[2517.83 - 2523.84] information because it's not man-made
[2520.56 - 2526.93] it's not manly right and and that means
[2523.84 - 2529.53] it's not contaminated with guessing
[2526.93 - 2532.75] games or interests money behind it or
[2529.53 - 2534.73] investors behind it or trendsetters
[2532.75 - 2536.50] behind it that have investment nesters
[2534.73 - 2537.76] or whatever it is or research and
[2536.50 - 2540.61] science where there's a thumb on the
[2537.76 - 2542.41] scale so no one gets fired I'm in the in
[2540.61 - 2543.79] the in I've had scientists tell me you
[2542.41 - 2547.84] don't want if you want to keep your job
[2543.79 - 2550.21] you better produce a result whether you
[2547.84 - 2551.95] like it or not one thing whether you see
[2550.21 - 2554.41] something bad you don't talk about what
[2551.95 - 2556.03] you see bad you just scientists they
[2554.41 - 2557.44] just gotta talk about a one little thing
[2556.03 - 2559.36] that might have been positive because
[2557.44 - 2561.22] you don't want to never work again in
[2559.36 - 2562.78] the science field that I've heard that
[2561.22 - 2565.66] from so many different scientists it's
[2562.78 - 2569.08] like either scientists have they have
[2565.66 - 2571.12] this this common saying which do you
[2569.08 - 2574.63] want to work again or do you never want
[2571.12 - 2577.30] to work again yeah and so so well this
[2574.63 - 2580.21] isn't man-made information and the
[2577.30 - 2582.94] information works so when I started with
[2580.21 - 2587.92] your information and to change my diet
[2582.94 - 2590.74] and so in my lifestyle at the time I got
[2587.92 - 2593.10] my breast implants removed I had breast
[2590.74 - 2595.99] implants for eight years of my life and
[2593.10 - 2598.81] you have a radio show about breasts and
[2595.99 - 2603.12] containers and breast implant illness is
[2598.81 - 2606.19] a real thing it's not the cause of
[2603.12 - 2608.65] chronic illness but it's a huge trigger
[2606.19 - 2611.35] of course you have those influence in
[2608.65 - 2614.26] your body and they are full of heavy
[2611.35 - 2616.81] metals and other toxic stuff and you
[2614.26 - 2619.45] wearing it under your skin and it's
[2616.81 - 2622.99] always there and it's a big trigger and
[2619.45 - 2626.95] a great place for bacteria to live in
[2622.99 - 2632.59] and so I've got the breast implants
[2626.95 - 2636.70] removed and I recovered so so quick with
[2632.59 - 2638.89] your diet information from this surgery
[2636.70 - 2640.11] it was a big surgery because the
[2638.89 - 2642.73] implants were
[2640.11 - 2646.33] everywhere my body literally and
[2642.73 - 2650.14] connected to my bones so this was big
[2646.33 - 2652.69] surgery and I recovered so so quick with
[2650.14 - 2659.56] celery juice with mangoes they were
[2652.69 - 2662.20] played at mangos like always a time and
[2659.56 - 2669.52] this was so this was like hey that was
[2662.20 - 2671.80] fruit you know it people have to
[2669.52 - 2673.90] understand that some people like many
[2671.80 - 2676.99] women can have the breast implants and
[2673.90 - 2678.97] not experience any problems because in
[2676.99 - 2683.59] that moment they don't have an Epstein
[2678.97 - 2685.99] bar that's actually basically out of the
[2683.59 - 2687.64] running out of the gate and and running
[2685.99 - 2689.17] around through the body causing trouble
[2687.64 - 2690.79] they don't have a shingles they don't
[2689.17 - 2692.23] have multiple Epstein bars they don't
[2690.79 - 2693.58] have an hhv-6 they don't have a
[2692.23 - 2696.55] cytomegalovirus they don't have a
[2693.58 - 2699.52] simplex one or two and or they don't
[2696.55 - 2701.56] have a really bad bad mix of them all
[2699.52 - 2704.56] you know what happens is that is that
[2701.56 - 2707.47] but you can have the breast implants and
[2704.56 - 2709.42] then they're creating toxins you're
[2707.47 - 2711.88] creating toxins or discharging toxins
[2709.42 - 2714.73] and there's nothing feeding on those
[2711.88 - 2716.44] toxins until you end up picking up your
[2714.73 - 2717.85] first step scene bar in a relationship
[2716.44 - 2719.38] or you pick you up at the first Epstein
[2717.85 - 2721.81] bar in a restaurant because you chefs
[2719.38 - 2723.07] cut their finger or you pick up your
[2721.81 - 2724.72] first step steam bar sharing some
[2723.07 - 2726.46] glasses because someone would happen to
[2724.72 - 2727.48] be really viral in that moment and
[2726.46 - 2730.48] you're at a party and they're sharing
[2727.48 - 2733.93] bottles or glasses and you get your
[2730.48 - 2736.15] first EBV and you're at now your your
[2733.93 - 2738.19] breast implants they become a trigger
[2736.15 - 2740.62] because they're just like having saying
[2738.19 - 2741.94] toxic heavy metals in your body it's
[2740.62 - 2743.92] just like having something else in your
[2741.94 - 2746.28] body and you know the toxins I talked
[2743.92 - 2748.84] about in cleanse the heel which I cover
[2746.28 - 2752.71] toxins like no one's ever known about
[2748.84 - 2755.86] what's inside our body all the way to to
[2752.71 - 2757.39] just luggage went in the airport on how
[2755.86 - 2759.55] you have to throw away your your
[2757.39 - 2762.58] carry-ons after you've gone through the
[2759.55 - 2765.82] airports for a few trips cuz the amount
[2762.58 - 2767.38] of radiation that's in the carry-on and
[2765.82 - 2768.97] you don't want that near your child you
[2767.38 - 2770.29] don't want that you know sitting by your
[2768.97 - 2771.52] bed at night you don't want that you
[2770.29 - 2772.78] want to throw away your carry-ons
[2771.52 - 2774.01] eventually
[2772.78 - 2776.20] so I tell people don't get real
[2774.01 - 2777.76] expensive carry-ons because you're gonna
[2776.20 - 2781.78] need to toss it after a couple of trip
[2777.76 - 2783.91] few trips good to know radiation but the
[2781.78 - 2785.65] point is is that all these toxins were
[2783.91 - 2788.02] dealing with our triggers and breast
[2785.65 - 2792.48] implants it's just it's like that it's
[2788.02 - 2796.09] one of those triggers it's a big trigger
[2792.48 - 2800.56] and I was so happy to get rid of them
[2796.09 - 2803.23] and the surgery was was big I already
[2800.56 - 2808.09] said that and I recovered so fast year
[2803.23 - 2814.27] before that in 2016 I had appendicitis
[2808.09 - 2817.72] and surgery as well and I need five
[2814.27 - 2822.18] months to recover from that surgery ages
[2817.72 - 2827.50] it took me so long it was before my my
[2822.18 - 2831.91] breast surgery so the surgery for the
[2827.50 - 2834.88] appendix was half a year before and I
[2831.91 - 2839.31] had so many trouble to to recover from
[2834.88 - 2843.90] that because I've got anti buttocks and
[2839.31 - 2846.40] antibiotics after surgery and all
[2843.90 - 2847.66] streptococcus and my body said hooray
[2846.40 - 2851.98] let's have a party
[2847.66 - 2858.85] in this girl so streptococcus is a big
[2851.98 - 2860.83] big part and huge yeah doctor so know
[2858.85 - 2862.00] it's a streptococcus they don't know
[2860.83 - 2864.19] they don't know they don't know that
[2862.00 - 2865.36] that's they know that yeah that you've
[2864.19 - 2866.59] learned that from them that mean
[2865.36 - 2868.90] information because that's the whole
[2866.59 - 2871.84] thing in the strep groups are what
[2868.90 - 2873.52] causes our our appendix to get inflamed
[2871.84 - 2877.53] for so long that's those strep groups
[2873.52 - 2880.72] and you know from sinuses the tonsils
[2877.53 - 2889.09] to-to-to sore throats mystery mysterious
[2880.72 - 2894.49] sore throats - - bloating reflux strep
[2889.09 - 2896.38] is behind so I still have acne after
[2894.49 - 2898.12] surgery it's amazing you know every time
[2896.38 - 2900.61] every time a friend will be like you
[2898.12 - 2902.65] know I was watching a YouTube or I was I
[2900.61 - 2904.21] was on social media and there's another
[2902.65 - 2905.48] person talking about their acne and how
[2904.21 - 2908.27] you know
[2905.48 - 2911.33] and they don't have a single clue their
[2908.27 - 2912.74] acnes caused by streptococcus and
[2911.33 - 2915.77] they're just getting information from
[2912.74 - 2918.08] either some type of practitioner or
[2915.77 - 2919.43] their doctor or a health coach and
[2918.08 - 2924.17] they're just telling them oh it's your
[2919.43 - 2926.30] hormones or use this cream or or change
[2924.17 - 2927.92] this food but not know why it could help
[2926.30 - 2930.77] or not help or might help but might not
[2927.92 - 2932.15] and everybody's still running around and
[2930.77 - 2933.59] you see it's just you know no matter how
[2932.15 - 2936.05] many years I've been putting out the
[2933.59 - 2939.62] truth that cystic acne and acne problems
[2936.05 - 2941.21] are streptococcus and and how you have
[2939.62 - 2942.77] to get rid of that strep to really get
[2941.21 - 2944.15] rid of that no matter how many years it
[2942.77 - 2946.16] puts it out you still see it every day
[2944.15 - 2947.66] people tell me I still people tell me
[2946.16 - 2949.07] like you know there's still a new person
[2947.66 - 2951.13] on YouTube now open another ten more
[2949.07 - 2954.08] people saying it's hormones or something
[2951.13 - 2956.99] so may I ask you a question at symmetric
[2954.08 - 2959.24] caucus is it is it about what is about
[2956.99 - 2961.76] beans and lentils when it comes to
[2959.24 - 2965.18] streptococcus well what it is what it is
[2961.76 - 2967.61] this is is beans lentils they don't feed
[2965.18 - 2969.95] viruses and pathogens so beans and
[2967.61 - 2973.55] grains don't feed those those kinds of
[2969.95 - 2976.73] beans like lentils and and dukey beans
[2973.55 - 2981.98] black beans chickpeas garbanzo beans
[2976.73 - 2983.45] they don't feed bugs and and grains like
[2981.98 - 2987.50] millet okay
[2983.45 - 2989.42] and even oats don't feed bugs but but
[2987.50 - 2993.17] they still if you're eating too much of
[2989.42 - 2994.87] it they don't offer Oh enough nutrition
[2993.17 - 2996.83] so you're taking up so much space
[2994.87 - 2998.87] because they don't offer that much
[2996.83 - 3000.91] nutrition I mean compared to feed you
[2998.87 - 3003.19] could meet it and that's one thing right
[3000.91 - 3005.20] there it's really important no but but
[3003.19 - 3008.53] gluten based grains are the ones that
[3005.20 - 3009.82] feed viruses they feed pathogens and all
[3008.53 - 3013.30] that it's just that when you're eating
[3009.82 - 3015.97] too many grains too much rice you're
[3013.30 - 3017.32] taking up a lot of space for what you
[3015.97 - 3019.48] can you know and I talked about it all
[3017.32 - 3021.34] and cleanse the heel - all about that
[3019.48 - 3024.70] like all about beans and grains and
[3021.34 - 3028.69] stuff and so but Anthony coos and I I
[3024.70 - 3031.39] read that beans and vandals form mucus
[3028.69 - 3033.49] in our body yeah just that this could be
[3031.39 - 3034.89] a problem within some people because
[3033.49 - 3037.53] they're not they're not
[3034.89 - 3039.15] easily digestible because everybody's
[3037.53 - 3041.88] digestion czar just there shot
[3039.15 - 3043.77] everybody's hydrochloric acid stomach
[3041.88 - 3046.32] lands are producing the HCL their
[3043.77 - 3047.85] digestion is weakened their livers their
[3046.32 - 3049.65] livers are weakened so when you're
[3047.85 - 3052.56] putting you know you're putting in a lot
[3049.65 - 3054.42] of beans and a lot of grains they're
[3052.56 - 3056.31] they're they're harder to break down
[3054.42 - 3058.05] they're harder to digest so it's not
[3056.31 - 3060.21] that they're feeding pathogens it's just
[3058.05 - 3062.43] they're really hard to digest so you
