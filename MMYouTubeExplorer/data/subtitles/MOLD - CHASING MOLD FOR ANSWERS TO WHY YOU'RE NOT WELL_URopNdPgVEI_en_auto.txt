[91.20 - 94.72] way to actually
[92.16 - 95.84] you know hear about it so the whole bit
[94.72 - 97.52] so
[95.84 - 99.92] i want to talk about mold the crazy
[97.52 - 100.96] maker why did i name it the crazy maker
[99.92 - 102.96] because
[100.96 - 105.04] it could send you down a rabbit hole it
[102.96 - 106.48] sent a lot of people down the rabbit
[105.04 - 108.08] hole over the years
[106.48 - 110.16] then you you know then there's a lot of
[108.08 - 113.04] mold chasing doctors too
[110.16 - 114.00] out there where they they chase mold so
[113.04 - 115.44] they don't know what's going
[114.00 - 117.28] on they don't know why someone has aches
[115.44 - 119.52] and pains and tingles and numbness
[117.28 - 120.48] and fatigue and brain fog and they don't
[119.52 - 122.16] know why
[120.48 - 123.68] someone has all that body pain and neck
[122.16 - 125.36] pain and jaw pain
[123.68 - 127.28] so they start they don't they weren't
[125.36 - 128.64] taught that it's about viruses it's
[127.28 - 130.56] about bacteria
[128.64 - 131.84] and and toxic heavy metals and they
[130.56 - 132.80] weren't taught about that so they don't
[131.84 - 134.88] know that's why they
[132.80 - 136.40] people have anxiety and you know medical
[134.88 - 138.08] medium information so
[136.40 - 139.52] what they do is there's some doctors out
[138.08 - 140.88] there that are in the great pure
[139.52 - 142.16] intentions and
[140.88 - 144.16] they're loving doctors and are
[142.16 - 146.32] compassionate and they look for mold
[144.16 - 148.64] and they think that mold is the reason
[146.32 - 152.00] why someone just can't get
[148.64 - 152.40] better but when you get away from mold
[152.00 - 154.40] so
[152.40 - 156.56] say you actually were in a situation
[154.40 - 158.72] where you were surrounded by mold or
[156.56 - 160.16] mold was in your life and you get away
[158.72 - 162.80] from mold
[160.16 - 164.48] and you're still sick and still sick and
[162.80 - 166.24] still sick there's a reason and it
[164.48 - 167.60] wasn't the mold the mold was the trigger
[166.24 - 168.24] and i talked all about this this is
[167.60 - 171.92] really
[168.24 - 175.28] incredible information and why why
[171.92 - 179.04] would a family of five you know
[175.28 - 179.68] not get sick from mold or a family of
[179.04 - 183.52] four
[179.68 - 185.52] or why would a family
[183.52 - 187.36] you know be okay except for one member
[185.52 - 190.40] in the family so why would like
[187.36 - 191.20] say the mom be bedridden sick with
[190.40 - 193.68] fatigue
[191.20 - 194.64] and aches and pains and blurry vision
[193.68 - 197.44] and dizziness
[194.64 - 198.32] and and just stuck on mattress island
[197.44 - 200.88] like many people
[198.32 - 203.12] are and just be bedridden practically
[200.88 - 204.00] and then the husband and the kids they
[203.12 - 205.28] feel great
[204.00 - 207.28] they're going out every day they're
[205.28 - 208.24] going to the park they're going to the
[207.28 - 211.28] beach
[208.24 - 213.60] everything's great you know and and it's
[211.28 - 216.80] because mold exposure
[213.60 - 217.84] most mold exposure should make every
[216.80 - 219.60] single person
[217.84 - 221.76] sick if they were exposed but it doesn't
[219.60 - 223.52] work that way there's office buildings
[221.76 - 224.24] where you have like 50 people working in
[223.52 - 227.12] one
[224.24 - 229.20] and only three get sick and it's like
[227.12 - 230.80] whoa they test for mold wait it's mold
[229.20 - 232.16] it's mold it's mold if you're chasing
[230.80 - 234.64] mold and molds bad
[232.16 - 236.56] it's real bad but i talk about why it's
[234.64 - 238.72] really really bad and why
[236.56 - 240.72] people do get sick when they've been
[238.72 - 242.00] around mold so
[240.72 - 243.92] you know it's really important to know
[242.00 - 247.28] there too um

[590.96 - 593.60] know i didn't give a chance but in the
[592.32 - 595.84] b12 episode
[593.60 - 597.04] this is the one i use right here if you
[595.84 - 600.00] want to know
[597.04 - 601.84] it's the b12 right here and that's the
[600.00 - 604.48] vivirgy brand it's

[608.00 - 612.80] want to know
[608.80 - 615.68] let's take a look that's it and
[612.80 - 617.76] sabina says podcast is a life savior so
[615.68 - 618.24] yeah the b-12 with dinosaur bomb methyl
[617.76 - 620.40] volume
[618.24 - 622.08] no preservatives none of that bad stuff
[620.40 - 624.56] and then the alkyl no alcohol
[622.08 - 626.00] no citric acid nothing like that in
[624.56 - 629.28] there this is the cleanest stuff the
[626.00 - 631.12] stuff i trust and everything so um
[629.28 - 632.64] you guys the bottom line is when it
[631.12 - 636.96] comes down to mold
[632.64 - 638.16] you want to be easy on yourself okay you
[636.96 - 639.44] want to pat yourself on the back
[638.16 - 641.44] wherever you can you want to
[639.44 - 643.04] be be compassionate towards yourself
[641.44 - 646.48] because it's not your fault
[643.04 - 647.36] mold sickness isn't your fault you
[646.48 - 649.12] didn't do anything
[647.36 - 651.28] wrong you didn't do anything to create
[649.12 - 653.44] mold sickness it's not your fault there
[651.28 - 654.56] so that's something that's really
[653.44 - 658.16] important to know
[654.56 - 660.64] and and um the bottom line is
[658.16 - 663.20] it's a trigger a major trigger and
[660.64 - 664.96] that's one thing no one really gets
[663.20 - 667.04] and even the best mold doctors don't
[664.96 - 669.44] know it's a trigger they think
[667.04 - 671.36] the mold itself is totally the reason
[669.44 - 672.80] why we get knocked down but really it
[671.36 - 674.40] knocks down our immune system and then
[672.80 - 675.36] we have more problems that talk about
[674.40 - 679.44] that in there
[675.36 - 680.88] so yeah um so so many people have mold
[679.44 - 682.00] they have them in their walls they have
[680.88 - 683.60] them everywhere
[682.00 - 685.68] i think jenny fisher was just saying
[683.60 - 686.48] that as the as her comment went up there
[685.68 - 688.32] too
[686.48 - 690.56] there's michelle miller hey good to see

[694.00 - 699.12] um so yeah what the healing tools that i
[697.04 - 701.36] have in that episode are really powerful
[699.12 - 703.20] so the medical medium heavy metal detox
[701.36 - 704.56] smoothie is critical because what
[703.20 - 706.64] people don't know and this is an
[704.56 - 709.76] important one is that
[706.64 - 710.32] mold has metals in it really important
[709.76 - 713.04] right there
[710.32 - 714.40] so mold has metals in it's part of how
[713.04 - 716.16] everybody gets sick or
[714.40 - 717.68] you know because of that very thing
[716.16 - 720.00] they're getting triggered
[717.68 - 721.36] the metals bring down the immune system
[720.00 - 723.52] you breathe in the mold
[721.36 - 724.48] you get it and you get you eat it the
[723.52 - 726.80] whole bit

[745.28 - 749.60] what happens is you can be triggered

[760.08 - 764.48] you so much for doing this
[761.52 - 766.88] as i have requested several times i know
[764.48 - 769.92] i know i remember you requested it
[766.88 - 772.08] i do um i have not so much
[769.92 - 774.40] and you have helped me calm down and
[772.08 - 777.52] know the truth behind all this thank you
[774.40 - 779.92] anthony um sunday i'm so glad
[777.52 - 781.76] i want to be helpful i wanted to make
[779.92 - 784.48] sure i had this episode go out
[781.76 - 786.32] i remember you requested it and i just
[784.48 - 789.44] want you to have this information
[786.32 - 791.92] so it's really important it is um
[789.44 - 793.84] so jenny fisher says could my family
[791.92 - 796.00] still be affected by the mold we were
[793.84 - 798.40] exposed to for 10 years
[796.00 - 800.40] well what happens is your your immune
[798.40 - 802.32] system can get affected 10 years ago
[800.40 - 804.00] when you're exposed to 10 years ago
[802.32 - 805.68] or i'm not sure if the question was
[804.00 - 807.36] you're exposed for it for 10 years
[805.68 - 809.60] i mean through 10 years or it was 10
[807.36 - 811.20] years ago but that what happens is your
[809.60 - 813.92] immune system gets triggered
[811.20 - 815.04] because it gets weakened and then other
[813.92 - 816.88] things come out of
[815.04 - 818.96] us like bacteria that we have in our
[816.88 - 820.48] bodies and viruses we have in our bodies
[818.96 - 823.52] and we just get sick so
[820.48 - 825.20] it so the whole point of the episode too
[823.52 - 826.80] is to say hey we could take control over
[825.20 - 828.32] this whether we were affected by mold or
[826.80 - 830.64] not and we could get better
[828.32 - 831.84] we actually could get better and heal so
[830.64 - 833.28] that's important too
[831.84 - 835.76] got to check out the medical medium
[833.28 - 837.84] directory for all the tools
[835.76 - 840.72] because in the episode there's all these
[837.84 - 842.72] tools so the whole bit
[840.72 - 844.64] eliza says please tell us the best place
[842.72 - 848.32] to purchase all the items in the
[844.64 - 850.36] detox smoothie yes medicalmedium.com

[900.72 - 905.68] really they're really
[902.08 - 909.20] healing all of it so um
[905.68 - 912.00] so you guys the whole thing with mold is
[909.20 - 913.92] like this it's there are some people
[912.00 - 915.52] they don't get affected by it at all
[913.92 - 917.60] like they could eat the stuff
[915.52 - 918.80] they could breathe it in they could live
[917.60 - 920.88] it they could just
[918.80 - 922.64] it's all it just doesn't bother them
[920.88 - 924.80] it's amazing how it works
[922.64 - 926.08] and then there's someone that's all they
[924.80 - 927.12] have to do is just live in it for a
[926.08 - 930.00] little while
[927.12 - 931.68] breathe it for a little while um be a
[930.00 - 932.80] part of it for a little while and then
[931.68 - 935.12] when they are
[932.80 - 936.48] whoa it hits them hard chemical
[935.12 - 938.40] sensitivities
[936.48 - 941.04] all of that they just get totally
[938.40 - 942.80] whacked by it totally hit hard by it
[941.04 - 944.64] and that's a big deal you know apple
[942.80 - 946.08] podcast yep apple podcast is where
[944.64 - 948.96] medical medium podcast as
[946.08 - 950.56] is you can listen to the mold crazy
[948.96 - 952.88] maker episode there

[952.88 - 956.40] the crazy maker
[954.00 - 957.76] because what happens is that first of
[956.40 - 960.08] all you're not crazy
[957.76 - 962.40] that's the whole point what people don't
[960.08 - 965.04] get all these years i've watched is
[962.40 - 966.88] people get sick from old all these years
[965.04 - 968.88] and then other people including the
[966.88 - 971.92] doctors of the past
[968.88 - 974.64] they just would be like no no no you're
[971.92 - 975.52] you're crazy uh it's not the mold under
[974.64 - 977.44] your kitchen
[975.52 - 978.96] sink it's not the mold in your basement
[977.44 - 982.64] that's not why you're sick
[978.96 - 986.08] and but really it's caused a lot
[982.64 - 987.20] of hardship mold a tremendous amount of
[986.08 - 989.36] hardship
[987.20 - 990.56] and people who who have experienced it
[989.36 - 992.40] are not crazy
[990.56 - 994.40] it's the opposite they're actually
[992.40 - 995.20] totally sane they've been through hell
[994.40 - 996.80] and back
[995.20 - 999.12] no one understands them what they've

[1083.68 - 1089.44] to make sure you had this
[1086.08 - 1091.92] it's important um candy says i've
[1089.44 - 1094.32] struggled with mold for so many years
[1091.92 - 1095.20] and i'm not sure what to do about it ah
[1094.32 - 1097.92] what happens is
[1095.20 - 1098.64] if you're struggling with symptoms and
[1097.92 - 1100.64] conditions
[1098.64 - 1101.92] like when you diagnose with fibro where
[1100.64 - 1103.28] you diagnose with some needs you have
[1101.92 - 1105.44] the fatigue
[1103.28 - 1106.56] um was a hair thinning or you're just
[1105.44 - 1109.36] not well

[1113.28 - 1116.72] whatever it is all of it
[1114.88 - 1118.48] that there's other things causing that
[1116.72 - 1121.60] it's just mold
[1118.48 - 1122.64] triggers it so mold is the trigger it's
[1121.60 - 1125.52] one of those big
[1122.64 - 1127.04] triggers um you can learn you know god
[1125.52 - 1129.12] you can learn about this stuff for sure

[1180.24 - 1186.08] so that's important too um sage yep
[1183.76 - 1186.88] keeley says you mentioned adding sage as
[1186.08 - 1190.24] a treatment
[1186.88 - 1192.56] yes i did you listen to the podcast
[1190.24 - 1195.68] episode incredible um
[1192.56 - 1198.48] and what about burning sage
[1195.68 - 1200.16] i have a friend who burns sage to clean
[1198.48 - 1203.36] house once a year
[1200.16 - 1206.64] well um i would i would do a sage
[1203.36 - 1208.32] essential oil and a diffuser that's what
[1206.64 - 1210.24] i would do personally
[1208.32 - 1212.00] like i wouldn't burn i personally
[1210.24 - 1215.04] wouldn't burn sage
[1212.00 - 1216.64] you know and um and be careful too if
[1215.04 - 1219.20] you're doing that make sure

[1219.20 - 1222.88] and um
[1220.08 - 1224.48] inside the house but i would i would do
[1222.88 - 1227.28] the essential oil
[1224.48 - 1228.48] uh sage infuser but one of the tools i
[1227.28 - 1231.76] talk about
[1228.48 - 1232.40] in this podcast episode is the rosemary
[1231.76 - 1234.08] oil

[1252.64 - 1257.68] mean some people are more sensitive
