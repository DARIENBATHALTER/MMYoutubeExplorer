[50.56 - 55.96] about potatoes it's a food that
[53.44 - 59.00] generates a whole bunch of love and at
[55.96 - 61.12] the same time a lot of hate when eaten
[59.00 - 64.48] in the right way potato can help you
[61.12 - 66.48] gain strength and deeply satiate
[64.48 - 69.16] especially when eating straight but
[66.48 - 72.56] whatever you do try not to take the
[69.16 - 75.08] negative bait fear and confusion are
[72.56 - 78.28] tactics to change your mind about this

[104.52 - 110.56] chips scaring people to never eat them
[107.32 - 114.38] again you better stay strict forever the
[110.56 - 116.32] potato will be known to widen your

[148.76 - 152.20] crunchiness
[150.96 - 154.88] are really
[152.20 - 158.52] good do you think they're like a th000
[154.88 - 160.76] calories no they're not 1,000 calories
[158.52 - 165.00] pH I was kind of getting worried right
[160.76 - 169.32] there for a minute what 2500
[165.00 - 172.16] calories they're that bad it's all
[169.32 - 174.12] starch uh I'll just work out tomorrow
[172.16 - 177.12] more it doesn't matter I'll do extra
[174.12 - 179.20] workout this is my cheat day anyway I'm
[177.12 - 180.36] going to enjoy it and not feel guilty
[179.20 - 183.88] it's all about
[180.36 - 187.12] balance in some ways what you just heard
[183.88 - 190.40] here wasn't a cheat day if it was just
[187.12 - 193.64] the potato but while everybody's focus
[190.40 - 198.12] on the carb aspect they're missing the
[193.64 - 201.40] most important concern there is the oil
[198.12 - 205.28] that's the cheat day part it's not the
[201.40 - 209.04] potato it's the fat on the potato and
[205.28 - 211.76] that's where the bad calories are doing
[209.04 - 214.92] the extra work out the next day is only
[211.76 - 219.00] to clean up the oil mess not the carb
[214.92 - 222.68] mess the oil slick mess carbs on their
[219.00 - 227.36] own they're safe carbs with oils and
[222.68 - 231.40] fats are a problem any carb with oil and
[227.36 - 234.08] fat is what the real concern should be
[231.40 - 237.80] these days the potato always gets to
[234.08 - 240.60] blame it always has in recent decades
[237.80 - 243.56] and probably always will
[240.60 - 246.68] mostly because the health world is a
[243.56 - 250.84] pile of guessing games Hit or Miss hit
[246.68 - 253.44] or miss miss hit hit Miss got it there
[250.84 - 255.64] nope didn't work that might work uh
[253.44 - 258.40] maybe that'll work later no it didn't
[255.64 - 260.00] try again hit Miss again guessing game
[258.40 - 263.04] There You Go Round the Corner Round the
[260.00 - 266.92] Bend never ends guessing game when
[263.04 - 268.60] you're sick for three five 10 years seen
[266.92 - 271.32] more doctors than you ever could have
[268.60 - 273.92] dreamed of and you're still sick and on
[271.32 - 276.68] medications and tried everything
[273.92 - 280.04] alternative medicine had to offer every
[276.68 - 282.36] approach and someone tells you hey just
[280.04 - 284.00] go try it whatever see what works for
[282.36 - 286.72] you everybody's different did you try
[284.00 - 289.32] what works for you go go you should try
[286.72 - 292.40] it see if it works wait a minute just
[289.32 - 294.64] see it works for me that's the answer
[292.40 - 296.96] like that'll fix it after all the
[294.64 - 300.04] doctors and all the years I've been sick
[296.96 - 301.52] just see what works for me that's that's
[300.04 - 302.96] how to do it that's how you're doing it
[301.52 - 304.56] so that's how you're getting better so
[302.96 - 307.32] you're better or wait a minute you were
[304.56 - 309.76] never sick and you're telling me that um
[307.32 - 311.12] don't we all just have human bodies and
[309.76 - 313.52] when we're really sick there should be
[311.12 - 317.20] an answer out there just try something
[313.52 - 319.84] and see if that works isn't that like a
[317.20 - 322.20] guessing game and within the world of
[319.84 - 325.60] guessing games one of the things that
[322.20 - 327.56] takes the blame is potato like must be
[325.60 - 330.24] the potato did you take that out of your
[327.56 - 332.56] diet cuz that could be causing all your
[330.24 - 335.16] problems in the guessing game world
[332.56 - 337.68] that's how it works when it comes to
[335.16 - 339.80] having a health symptom or condition and
[337.68 - 341.92] trying to find relief in the guessing
[339.80 - 345.12] game world or hit or miss World this
[341.92 - 348.04] could happen if you got acne the potato
[345.12 - 350.08] did it if you have a weight problem the
[348.04 - 352.96] potato did it there are countless
[350.08 - 356.44] mistakes in the Health Arena what's good
[352.96 - 359.68] what's bad is that good is that bad is
[356.44 - 362.64] that bad yeah that's good no that's bad
[359.68 - 365.92] and a lot of innocent bystanders got
[362.64 - 368.16] mauled because of it the potato was just
[365.92 - 371.32] sitting there mining its own business
[368.16 - 374.92] and we grabbed it shoved it in a big gun
[371.32 - 377.04] and shot it 300 M an hour across a field
[374.92 - 379.36] and when it hit somebody in the head and
[377.04 - 382.00] nearly killed them it was the potato's
[379.36 - 384.68] fault not the dude who shoved it in the
[382.00 - 387.84] potato gun and shot it it's the potato's
[384.68 - 390.68] fault Let's Pretend something let's do
[387.84 - 392.40] some make believe Let's Pretend There's
[390.68 - 395.36] millions of people in the world that are
[392.40 - 397.52] sick struggling and suffering with
[395.36 - 399.76] countless symptoms and they've been to
[397.52 - 402.24] all these different doctors exhausted
[399.76 - 404.20] all resources looked at every scientific
[402.24 - 406.64] study about their illness that they can
[404.20 - 410.36] find and they were still sick with no
[406.64 - 411.80] answers oh wait that's not make believe
[410.36 - 415.36] there's no pretending that because
[411.80 - 417.48] that's true it's reality okay okay no
[415.36 - 420.72] pretending there's millions of people
[417.48 - 423.36] sick no one knows why yes they got a
[420.72 - 426.44] label for their disease or symptom like
[423.36 - 429.28] fibromyalgia neurological Lyme Hashim
[426.44 - 432.60] modus thyroiditis but still no one knows
[429.28 - 435.60] the cause the true cause so it's a
[432.60 - 437.64] random Blame Game a pick and choose
[435.60 - 439.76] that's how it's done and since no one
[437.64 - 443.04] knows why people are sick with chronic
[439.76 - 446.36] illness we need a Fall Guy or as many
[443.04 - 449.48] Fall Guys as we can find or produce or
[446.36 - 453.08] get or just get somewhere find somewhere
[449.48 - 456.60] or whatever and someone a Fall Guy was
[453.08 - 458.44] thrown in the mix and a mistake was made
[456.60 - 460.88] that's how all the theories of mistakes
[458.44 - 462.96] are made or created because when there
[460.88 - 466.04] aren't any answers to why someone's
[462.96 - 469.16] suffering one mistake two mistake three
[466.04 - 473.16] mistake four occurs one potato two
[469.16 - 476.72] potato three potato four um one potato
[473.16 - 480.80] two potato three potato four one potato
[476.72 - 483.60] two potato what wait wait a minute
[480.80 - 486.56] potato that's why everybody's sick right
[483.60 - 489.44] now it's like the makers of the health
[486.56 - 492.16] theories and mistakes stumble across the
[489.44 - 494.92] reasons in a children's rhyme or hearing
[492.16 - 497.96] something out there or finding something
[494.92 - 501.00] because really you're grasping at straws
[497.96 - 504.60] when you don't know why people are sick
[501.00 - 508.24] excuse me excuse me is that potato on my
[504.60 - 512.20] dish I can't eat that can you remove it
[508.24 - 515.72] please what no it's cooked fine I just
[512.20 - 519.04] can't eat it why uh it's cuz it's a
[515.72 - 522.04] night shade um what's a
[519.04 - 525.00] Nightshade not really sure but it sounds
[522.04 - 527.52] really scary it sounds shady and my
[525.00 - 530.20] health Guru told me to avoid it I think
[527.52 - 533.24] it means they grow at night or they give
[530.20 - 536.68] a lot of shade I really don't know I'm
[533.24 - 540.36] told it'll make me sick am I still sick
[536.68 - 542.84] yeah I got bad days do I still eat them
[540.36 - 546.40] no how would I know I'm sensitive to
[542.84 - 549.00] potato or night shades I have no idea it
[546.40 - 551.80] just makes sense yeah I'm sick with
[549.00 - 554.04] fatigue still and headaches brain fog
[551.80 - 556.68] and I get dizzy and my digestion is
[554.04 - 559.48] never good and I got aches and pains
[556.68 - 561.80] it's probably the night shades right
[559.48 - 564.56] mistakes are made every day and the
[561.80 - 566.56] potato gets thrown in the PO of mistakes
[564.56 - 570.32] when potato took the hit more than 20
[566.56 - 573.00] years ago as being a problem no one was
[570.32 - 577.20] looking at what was around the potato
[573.00 - 580.00] the fixings the dressing The Works hey
[577.20 - 583.92] good to see you let's sit down and order
[580.00 - 588.36] something M these hash browns are really
[583.92 - 592.84] good so buttery I love butter these eggs
[588.36 - 596.48] are yummy too oh oh best pancake I ever
[592.84 - 599.12] had hey waiter can I get an extra dab of
[596.48 - 602.44] butter on these pancakes what's that
[599.12 - 604.32] these are buttermilk pancakes oh good
[602.44 - 607.40] can I get two strips of bacon on the
[604.32 - 610.28] side and a little cream in my coffee
[607.40 - 612.36] thanks yeah how have I been feeling well
[610.28 - 614.44] been a little achy lately joints have
[612.36 - 617.28] been hurting haven't been feeling that
[614.44 - 620.76] great little tired my doctor says be
[617.28 - 622.56] careful of the night shades oh I
[620.76 - 625.84] shouldn't have had those hash browns
[622.56 - 628.48] just now what was I thinking what gets
[625.84 - 629.60] overlooked along with so many things is
[628.48 - 634.80] the butter
[629.60 - 639.56] the milk cream sour cream oils lard
[634.80 - 641.12] cheese bacon vinegar Mayo egg and gluten
[639.56 - 643.80] nitrates and
[641.12 - 646.48] antibiotics these get ignored if you're
[643.80 - 649.12] convinced it's the potato or a doctor or
[646.48 - 651.40] practitioner got sold on the potato bill
[649.12 - 654.16] of goods or read something in some
[651.40 - 657.36] article or in a meeting at a convention
[654.16 - 660.24] that potato was bad then you get nervous
[657.36 - 663.36] and you avoid it there's no science that
[660.24 - 666.56] can prove or ever proved that potato was
[663.36 - 669.60] a problem or caused a problem and very
[666.56 - 672.40] few people eat a potato by itself
[669.60 - 675.20] without a dressing or a condiment or
[672.40 - 678.12] foods like Dairy and gluten with it do
[675.20 - 682.16] you know anybody who just eats Potato by
[678.12 - 685.04] itself or with lettuce no oil no butter
[682.16 - 688.28] no milk no cheese do you know anybody
[685.04 - 690.16] just eating potato with none of that oh
[688.28 - 694.24] you do you know somebody who ordered
[690.16 - 696.48] just fries and only fries but wait did
[694.24 - 700.00] you miss something they were fried in
[696.48 - 702.84] oil or lard or he had some ketchup with
[700.00 - 705.76] vinegar in it which doesn't help either
[702.84 - 708.24] a person who isn't well has bigger
[705.76 - 710.76] problems than a fake problem like the
[708.24 - 713.64] potato it's a classic case of bait and
[710.76 - 717.56] switch the cheese is fine the potato's
[713.64 - 719.36] bad look over here the Butter's safe hey
[717.56 - 723.20] the Butter's fine the potato potato's
[719.36 - 726.32] dangerous hey over here the milk is good
[723.20 - 728.64] but the potato's bad it's real simple
[726.32 - 731.72] butter will set you up for a future
[728.64 - 733.56] heart attack anyone who's somebody in
[731.72 - 736.32] health telling you that butter is good
[733.56 - 738.20] on anything or even in your coffee is
[736.32 - 741.52] unaware and somehow missed the heart
[738.20 - 744.72] attack memo the most important thing to
[741.52 - 747.40] understand about food is what food can
[744.72 - 749.48] cause a problem and why does it cause a
[747.40 - 752.40] problem well you think the an are out
[749.48 - 755.64] there avoid gluten process food fried
[752.40 - 757.56] food you heard all of this it seems like
[755.64 - 760.48] all the answers are out there already
[757.56 - 763.48] there's nothing to know that's new so
[760.48 - 767.84] when they say that food will cause
[763.48 - 770.52] inflammation what food and why how how
[767.84 - 772.44] does the food cause the inflammation
[770.52 - 774.92] because there's no study or science that
[772.44 - 777.68] determine white gluten causes a problem
[774.92 - 780.08] no one knows it's all theories the
[777.68 - 784.04] theory is not a proven factual
[780.08 - 788.08] guaranteed answer that's why it's called
[784.04 - 790.44] a theory inflammation caused by a food
[788.08 - 791.68] is a theory science can't see what
[790.44 - 793.60] happens when you choose something
[791.68 - 796.08] swallow it and then monitor it with an
[793.60 - 798.32] actual scope and computer and visualize
[796.08 - 801.20] right in front of their eyes your cells
[798.32 - 804.32] getting inflamed it hasn't happened and
[801.20 - 807.16] it never will here's one for you why
[804.32 - 809.84] would one person be able to eat whatever
[807.16 - 812.60] they want and feel great while another
[809.84 - 815.84] person never feels good and foods like
[812.60 - 819.08] gluten make them feel worse but if it
[815.84 - 822.00] was the food itself then no one would
[819.08 - 826.00] get away with eating it one person's
[822.00 - 828.68] inflamed one person's not if a food
[826.00 - 831.08] causes inflammation then it's going to
[828.68 - 834.44] cause inflammation in everyone but it
[831.08 - 836.08] doesn't theories become sales pitches
[834.44 - 838.80] someone's going to sales pitch you on
[836.08 - 841.44] eltin Theory probably sell you a few
[838.80 - 844.32] supplements too someone's going to sales
[841.44 - 846.00] pitch you on a Nightshade Theory maybe
[844.32 - 848.76] someone's going to pitch you on the
[846.00 - 850.88] butter in your drink Theory or butter in
[848.76 - 854.16] your water doesn't matter how much it
[850.88 - 856.12] defies Common Sense the thing is some of
[854.16 - 858.56] the theory makers don't even believe in
[856.12 - 862.28] their own theories but they do believe
[858.56 - 864.88] one thing the people are gullible and
[862.28 - 867.72] will buy into these theories but what
[864.88 - 869.28] they don't realize is is that people
[867.72 - 871.36] aren't G
[869.28 - 874.24] people are trusting there's a big
[871.36 - 877.04] difference and these Theory makers take
[874.24 - 879.92] advantage of trusting people and treat
[877.04 - 882.36] them like they were chickens or cattle
[879.92 - 884.52] any chance to cash out on a theory make
[882.36 - 888.20] a brand out of it maybe make a lot of
[884.52 - 891.28] money a theory that defies Common Sense
[888.20 - 894.28] someone's going to do it people like to
[891.28 - 896.72] gamble you like to gamble right gambling
[894.28 - 899.48] is great who cares if you leave a
[896.72 - 901.56] gambling place with only your box on
[899.48 - 903.20] barefooted trying to call for a car
[901.56 - 905.56] service because you gambled your car
[903.20 - 908.72] away but you realize you don't have your
[905.56 - 911.04] phone it's gone too lost in the bet so
[908.72 - 914.08] let's gamble with your health on a
[911.04 - 916.76] theory potatoes are bad you ready to
[914.08 - 920.04] roll the dice is it going to come up
[916.76 - 922.40] snake eyes are you going to roll a seven
[920.04 - 925.28] who's got the Joker card you think your
[922.40 - 927.20] cards will fall on a 21 you think that
[925.28 - 928.84] little ball spinning around and around
[927.20 - 931.76] and around is going to land on that high
[928.84 - 934.72] number you got to watch out because the
[931.76 - 937.52] potato is about to drop down a straight
[934.72 - 940.96] flush and you want to be on the side of
[937.52 - 944.20] the winner unless the brainwashing you
[940.96 - 947.04] underwent stops you what brainwashing am
[944.20 - 950.44] I talking about it's a Nightshade it's
[947.04 - 953.52] got lectins It's too high in carbs
[950.44 - 955.80] voiding nutrition make you gain weight
[953.52 - 958.76] it's a white food that kind of
[955.80 - 960.80] brainwashing and manipulating I'm not
[958.76 - 963.20] talking about everybody who hears
[960.80 - 965.56] something and tells someone something
[963.20 - 967.16] else who tells somebody something else
[965.56 - 968.68] because they heard something from
[967.16 - 971.08] someone else who heard something from
[968.68 - 972.72] somebody else who told somebody else I'm
[971.08 - 974.84] talking about the people who make a
[972.72 - 977.56] career out of playing guessing games
[974.84 - 980.00] with People's Health the theory makers
[977.56 - 983.12] why does it matter because it stops you
[980.00 - 985.48] from eating a food that can help you who
[983.12 - 987.20] cares well if you're someone who's
[985.48 - 989.60] living their life a mattress in couch
[987.20 - 992.92] Island and is really struggling to get
[989.60 - 995.56] through their day everything counts they
[992.92 - 998.68] don't have time energy money to waste on
[995.56 - 1001.60] another bad idea little things matter it
[998.68 - 1003.92] could be make our break in recovery so
[1001.60 - 1006.40] being told you should fear a food that
[1003.92 - 1009.20] could actually help you will only set
[1006.40 - 1012.92] you back and not help you move forward
[1009.20 - 1014.88] does a potato cause inflammation no it's
[1012.92 - 1017.08] the foods that are eaten with a potato
[1014.88 - 1019.72] that cause a problem they still don't
[1017.08 - 1023.28] cause inflammation either but the milk
[1019.72 - 1026.28] cheese butter corn oil and cream feed
[1023.28 - 1029.48] viruses and bacteria inside our body and
[1026.28 - 1031.44] then these bugs create the inflammation
[1029.48 - 1034.48] they eat food they like and then
[1031.44 - 1038.48] eliminate the food go to bathroom inside
[1034.48 - 1041.00] your body we become the pathogens toilet
[1038.48 - 1042.72] and this is really toxic they release
[1041.00 - 1046.24] what I termed viral
[1042.72 - 1049.32] neurotoxins these neurotoxins can cause
[1046.24 - 1051.52] inflammation viruses and bacteria IA can
[1049.32 - 1054.64] also burrow themselves into organs and
[1051.52 - 1057.04] glands creating more inflammation so
[1054.64 - 1058.88] it's not even the milk cheese butter and
[1057.04 - 1060.92] gluten that causes inflammation when you
[1058.88 - 1062.52] grab that milk carton of milk you pour
[1060.92 - 1065.44] your glasses of milk there and you grab
[1062.52 - 1065.44] it and you start sending it
[1065.52 - 1070.36] down all your bugs in there are just
[1067.64 - 1071.96] going like yeah yeah yeah there it is
[1070.36 - 1073.64] there it is they start feeding on it and
[1071.96 - 1077.16] eating it and that's how it goes and
[1073.64 - 1080.72] that's what the problem is the bugs that
[1077.16 - 1082.56] are inside of us are drinking the milk
[1080.72 - 1085.08] that's why you could be somebody who's
[1082.56 - 1087.28] 95 years old anywhere around the world
[1085.08 - 1089.32] or in some country somewhere and
[1087.28 - 1091.28] drinking milk and everybody knows
[1089.32 - 1093.68] they're drinking milk they're 95 years
[1091.28 - 1095.44] old they feel okay they're living their
[1093.68 - 1098.32] life everybody's like look how old you
[1095.44 - 1100.08] are this is amazing and what do you do
[1098.32 - 1102.16] it's like drinking milk well they don't
[1100.08 - 1104.92] have the bugs and then when a
[1102.16 - 1107.00] 20-year-old drinks a glass of milk all
[1104.92 - 1109.52] of a sudden the eczema the psoriasis an
[1107.00 - 1113.80] acne breakout occurs stomach cramps
[1109.52 - 1116.00] diarrhea bloating all happens and they
[1113.80 - 1118.28] remove the milk and dairy things start
[1116.00 - 1121.12] to get better and better and better
[1118.28 - 1123.04] because they have the bugs so when that
[1121.12 - 1125.32] person sends that milk down and drinks
[1123.04 - 1129.28] it the bugs are drinking it at the same
[1125.32 - 1132.04] time but guess what the potato doesn't
[1129.28 - 1134.20] feed any viruses or bacteria but the
[1132.04 - 1138.36] butter on the potato feeds the viruses
[1134.20 - 1141.12] and bacteria potato starves viruses and
[1138.36 - 1143.76] bacteria starves the bugs put butter on
[1141.12 - 1146.00] the potato now we have a problem it's
[1143.76 - 1148.60] like one is fighting the other the
[1146.00 - 1151.68] potato is antiviral and the butter is
[1148.60 - 1154.92] proviral and then we got eggs eggs feed
[1151.68 - 1156.52] viruses and bacteria potatoes don't eat
[1154.92 - 1158.76] eggs with their fried potatoes in the
[1156.52 - 1161.84] morning you got a conflict of interest
[1158.76 - 1165.40] one food is trying to save you one food
[1161.84 - 1167.88] is not potatoes are a Nightshade what
[1165.40 - 1170.28] does that mean the theory is that night
[1167.88 - 1172.60] shade that are edible possess an
[1170.28 - 1175.16] alkaloid that alkaloid could be
[1172.60 - 1178.04] irritating to some people causing
[1175.16 - 1179.88] inflammation what no one is told is that
[1178.04 - 1181.96] they're looking at the alkaloid that the
[1179.88 - 1184.92] leaves and stems of The Nightshade
[1181.96 - 1187.40] plants have that you don't eat they're
[1184.92 - 1190.36] looking at the potato leaves and stems
[1187.40 - 1193.12] the tomato leaves and stems that's where
[1190.36 - 1196.12] the alkaloid resides the alkaloid in the
[1193.12 - 1198.40] tomato and potato is the normal edible
[1196.12 - 1201.28] alkaloid different from the alkaloid in
[1198.40 - 1204.12] the leaves and stems it's the normal
[1201.28 - 1206.80] alkaloid in potato that's equal to the
[1204.12 - 1209.56] alkaloid in lettuce raspberries Swiss
[1206.80 - 1211.64] Shard Lamb's quarters blackberries
[1209.56 - 1214.36] artichoke zucchini and every other
[1211.64 - 1216.08] edible plant food certain people that
[1214.36 - 1219.32] are considered sensitive to night shades
[1216.08 - 1222.08] like potato have other problems that has
[1219.32 - 1224.08] nothing to do with the potato there are
[1222.08 - 1226.00] other things in their diet causing the
[1224.08 - 1227.88] trouble that's feeding the root causes
[1226.00 - 1229.92] of their symptoms and conditions the
[1227.88 - 1232.32] problem is people eat the potato with
[1229.92 - 1235.12] other things or they eat the potato
[1232.32 - 1237.72] cooked wrong fried in oil baked with
[1235.12 - 1240.52] cheese and cream mashed with butter and
[1237.72 - 1243.72] milk baked or fried as a chip with bad
[1240.52 - 1246.32] oil or combined with a bunch of fat
[1243.72 - 1249.32] potato and meat potato and chicken
[1246.32 - 1252.88] potato and pork potato and eggs potato
[1249.32 - 1256.56] and oil potato and tofu which leads us
[1252.88 - 1259.96] to another problem a diabetic nightmare
[1256.56 - 1262.88] carbohydrates and fat combined causing
[1259.96 - 1266.56] insulin resistance any carbohydrates and
[1262.88 - 1268.52] fats combined causes insulin resistance
[1266.56 - 1270.72] and the potato gets to blame the
[1268.52 - 1273.32] carbohydrate looks like the culprit the
[1270.72 - 1275.48] bad guy but what's really happening is
[1273.32 - 1278.48] the fat is getting in the way of
[1275.48 - 1281.64] insulin's job to send a message to your
[1278.48 - 1284.28] cells to open up wide and then guide the
[1281.64 - 1287.08] sugar into the cells so they get the
[1284.28 - 1290.48] food they need and the fat gets in the
[1287.08 - 1292.68] way and blocks it forget potato stick
[1290.48 - 1295.12] any carbohydrate in the pitcher and the
[1292.68 - 1298.08] exact same thing happens rice and
[1295.12 - 1299.80] chicken the chicken fat blocks the carb
[1298.08 - 1303.20] the sugar from the rice from entering
[1299.80 - 1305.76] your cells pork and beans pork and rice
[1303.20 - 1308.56] same thing happens there too quinoa and
[1305.76 - 1311.72] oil oatmeal and peanut butter turkey
[1308.56 - 1315.20] sandwich with meat and bread pasta and
[1311.72 - 1319.44] butter the carb is always blamed as the
[1315.20 - 1322.16] A1C Rises or hypogly lmia occurs or
[1319.44 - 1325.40] hypoglycemia comes on but really it's
[1322.16 - 1327.56] just a fat insulin isn't produced to dry
[1325.40 - 1331.04] fat into your cells your cells aren't
[1327.56 - 1334.24] Reliant upon fat they rely on sugar
[1331.04 - 1336.60] glucose to survive so we can function
[1334.24 - 1338.96] blood sugar means everything without
[1336.60 - 1341.52] blood sugar we can't function they're
[1338.96 - 1343.72] not testing your blood fat the fat
[1341.52 - 1345.96] doesn't keep you alive it's not what's
[1343.72 - 1348.20] important here it's not letting you
[1345.96 - 1350.16] function on a day-to-day basis if it
[1348.20 - 1352.56] drops down or you don't have fat in your
[1350.16 - 1355.04] diet you feel great but without blood
[1352.56 - 1359.04] sugar you're going to hit the wall or
[1355.04 - 1361.56] the ground insulin isn't created for fat
[1359.04 - 1364.24] it's created for sugar but the fat you
[1361.56 - 1367.00] eat that enters your bloodstream stops
[1364.24 - 1369.56] the glucose from entering cells it stays
[1367.00 - 1372.80] in your bloodstream trapping the sugar
[1369.56 - 1375.44] and driving up your A1C but the potato
[1372.80 - 1379.56] gets the blame you know how you reverse
[1375.44 - 1382.76] type 2 diabetes and drop your a 1 C and
[1379.56 - 1385.76] put type 2 diabetes behind you and heal
[1382.76 - 1388.72] you remove the fats and bring in lots of
[1385.76 - 1391.32] potatoes Everything Changes insulin
[1388.72 - 1393.48] resistance is gone I've seen it happen
[1391.32 - 1396.32] thousands of times over the years this
[1393.48 - 1398.36] isn't a theory it's been proven
[1396.32 - 1400.52] successfully I taught a lot of doctors
[1398.36 - 1403.12] how to do it for their patients let's
[1400.52 - 1405.48] talk about weight and the potato will
[1403.12 - 1408.08] make you fat Theory you're eating that
[1405.48 - 1410.80] baked potato those french fries potato
[1408.08 - 1412.80] chips cheesy potatoes mashed potatoes
[1410.80 - 1415.76] you're going to gain weight put on
[1412.80 - 1418.48] unwanted pounds that's what we're told
[1415.76 - 1421.60] and it's all you hear or this is all you
[1418.48 - 1424.00] hear carbs carbs carbs whoa too many
[1421.60 - 1427.04] carbs lots of carbs but you won't hear
[1424.00 - 1429.12] this fat fat look out for the fat the
[1427.04 - 1430.88] butter the oil look out for the cream
[1429.12 - 1433.72] the cheese look out for the milk you
[1430.88 - 1437.08] won't hear that no one's going to say
[1433.72 - 1439.12] whoa there's a lot of fat on those fries
[1437.08 - 1441.96] whoa look at that grease everywhere that
[1439.12 - 1443.92] oil look at the fat on those chips or
[1441.96 - 1445.60] the fatty milk and cheese and butter and
[1443.92 - 1447.76] the cheesy potatoes the mashed potatoes
[1445.60 - 1450.76] like look out for that or the sour cream
[1447.76 - 1452.64] on the baked potato no one blames any of
[1450.76 - 1455.60] that instead they're just like carbs
[1452.64 - 1457.88] carbs car carbs carbs it defies common
[1455.60 - 1460.12] sense and you know what's funny it
[1457.88 - 1462.76] defies reality what do you mean just
[1460.12 - 1465.04] carbs these are fat bombs majority of
[1462.76 - 1467.20] calories are coming from the fat and
[1465.04 - 1470.12] combine the fat with the carb and then
[1467.20 - 1472.88] blame the weight on the carb that's like
[1470.12 - 1475.80] shooting the potato gun shooting that
[1472.88 - 1477.68] Spud 300 mph across the field hitting
[1475.80 - 1480.56] somebody in the head and blaming the
[1477.68 - 1482.28] Spud and not the dude that shot him and
[1480.56 - 1484.52] then getting off the ground dusting
[1482.28 - 1486.04] yourself off and rubbing your head and
[1484.52 - 1488.84] looking at the potato on the ground and
[1486.04 - 1492.00] saying stupid potato all you'll ever
[1488.84 - 1495.16] hear is the French fry as a carb not a
[1492.00 - 1498.04] word about the oil like it doesn't exist
[1495.16 - 1500.32] throw cheese on those fries and pretend
[1498.04 - 1502.60] it doesn't exist it's all carbs there's
[1500.32 - 1504.92] no cheese on there throw ranch or sour
[1502.60 - 1507.20] cream on those fries or a potato and
[1504.92 - 1509.68] pretend it doesn't exist there's no
[1507.20 - 1512.84] Ranch on there there's no Ranch there's
[1509.68 - 1515.64] no cheese no sour cream it just doesn't
[1512.84 - 1517.04] exist we live in a pretend world when it
[1515.64 - 1519.00] comes down to some of these things we
[1517.04 - 1520.56] eat you're eating potato chips your
[1519.00 - 1522.68] hands are smeared with grease all over
[1520.56 - 1524.92] the place and you need a napkin to wipe
[1522.68 - 1526.72] it you got grease all over your face
[1524.92 - 1528.28] grease prints are on the glass of water
[1526.72 - 1530.72] or something you're drinking
[1528.28 - 1534.00] and you think it's a carb they tricked a
[1530.72 - 1536.04] lot of people with that one it's the fat
[1534.00 - 1539.40] that puts on the weight clogs up the
[1536.04 - 1542.04] liver overburn it slows everything down
[1539.40 - 1544.32] your liver can't store any more of it so
[1542.04 - 1547.04] now the fat gathers all around your body
[1544.32 - 1549.32] you better exercise you're told anyway
[1547.04 - 1551.84] burn off those carbs but really you're
[1549.32 - 1553.48] trying to burn off the fat meanwhile
[1551.84 - 1555.36] you're on your treadmill and you're
[1553.48 - 1558.20] thinking I got to burn off all this
[1555.36 - 1561.08] sugar but it's the oil the but butter
[1558.20 - 1563.56] sour cream the cheese the milk they're
[1561.08 - 1565.40] the weight gainers I get it I get it you
[1563.56 - 1567.44] know somebody who can eat whatever they
[1565.40 - 1568.88] want all the cheese they want all the
[1567.44 - 1571.72] pizza they want they don't gain any
[1568.88 - 1574.44] weight not yet when their liver gets
[1571.72 - 1577.08] maxed out they'll gain it down the road
[1574.44 - 1579.56] everybody does as they get older weights
[1577.08 - 1582.32] harder to keep off they're just lucky
[1579.56 - 1584.76] they're not gaining it now people say
[1582.32 - 1588.00] potatoes are a white food like processed
[1584.76 - 1591.64] flour just because they have a white
[1588.00 - 1593.72] inside but wait a minute to start with
[1591.64 - 1596.44] an inside of a potato isn't exactly
[1593.72 - 1599.40] white unlike processed white flour the
[1596.44 - 1601.64] potato is a little bit of a richer color
[1599.40 - 1604.20] they missed that second of all the
[1601.64 - 1606.68] potato has a skin that skin determines
[1604.20 - 1609.32] the color of that food just like a big
[1606.68 - 1612.16] cultivated blueberry has a clear whitish
[1609.32 - 1614.72] Center just like an apple has a white
[1612.16 - 1617.64] pulp just like zucchini and yellow
[1614.72 - 1620.64] squash has a white center zucchini is
[1617.64 - 1624.08] green it's a green food a blueberry is
[1620.64 - 1626.96] blue it's a blue food a red apple is red
[1624.08 - 1629.64] it's a red food red potato is red too
[1626.96 - 1632.80] it's a red food brown potato is a brown
[1629.64 - 1635.44] food yellow potato is a yellow food a
[1632.80 - 1638.20] purple potato is a purple food all these
[1635.44 - 1640.16] simple mistakes gives us a window into
[1638.20 - 1641.72] the possibility of what else is
[1640.16 - 1644.80] everybody wrong about in the healthfield
[1641.72 - 1646.52] the list is massive we haven't even
[1644.80 - 1650.16] scratched the surface of all the
[1646.52 - 1652.36] screw-ups the potato is a whole food not
[1650.16 - 1655.08] a processed white food you take the
[1652.36 - 1657.84] potato you cook it it's a whole food
[1655.08 - 1659.68] it's a long sustaining complex
[1657.84 - 1662.36] carbohydrate that's
[1659.68 - 1665.00] satiating but before we talk about its
[1662.36 - 1668.48] benefits we still got some more fish to
[1665.00 - 1670.76] fry and some dice to roll if you heard
[1668.48 - 1672.84] about lectins in your potato there's
[1670.76 - 1675.48] something to know there's lectins in a
[1672.84 - 1677.32] potato yeah just like there's lectins in
[1675.48 - 1680.48] every single plant food there is that
[1677.32 - 1682.92] you you eat and they're all created
[1680.48 - 1684.68] equal unless someone spouts out an
[1682.92 - 1686.84] opinion or theory that there's bad
[1684.68 - 1689.40] lectin in a potato or tomato because
[1686.84 - 1691.72] they're deciding they don't like those
[1689.40 - 1694.48] and most likely because they bought into
[1691.72 - 1697.08] an earlier theory that tomatoes and
[1694.48 - 1699.56] potatoes cause problems cuz they're the
[1697.08 - 1700.92] night shades oh wait you might be
[1699.56 - 1703.36] someone that thinks well there's too
[1700.92 - 1705.84] many eltin in a potato then versus
[1703.36 - 1709.52] something else well if lectin were so
[1705.84 - 1712.16] bad then why have so many people healed
[1709.52 - 1715.04] eating potatoes and healed from
[1712.16 - 1718.28] debilitating diseases somebody in the
[1715.04 - 1720.88] field of Health stab the potato and use
[1718.28 - 1723.16] lectins as the knife in the irony
[1720.88 - 1725.80] lectins don't cause any problems they're
[1723.16 - 1728.56] not the reason anyone has a symptom or a
[1725.80 - 1731.44] condition on any level when you don't
[1728.56 - 1733.56] know why people are sick we come up with
[1731.44 - 1736.04] the most blatantly ridiculous unfounded
[1733.56 - 1738.96] guesses we pull them straight out of our
[1736.04 - 1742.28] behind and smear it on everyone
[1738.96 - 1744.60] thousands and thousands of people healed
[1742.28 - 1747.28] from debilitating diseases while eating
[1744.60 - 1749.88] lectins and the lectin propagandists
[1747.28 - 1753.60] pretend no one ever healed while eating
[1749.88 - 1756.68] a tomato a potato or a lectin so what's
[1753.60 - 1759.20] good about potato a lot let's start with
[1756.68 - 1761.44] zinc it's a precious mineral that's not
[1759.20 - 1763.76] in our food today a critical Trace
[1761.44 - 1766.76] mineral needed to keep our immune system
[1763.76 - 1769.76] strong and to fight pathogens there's
[1766.76 - 1771.44] not a lot of zinc in Foods the soil
[1769.76 - 1775.00] doesn't have zinc like it used to have
[1771.44 - 1777.64] in the old days it's depleted so where's
[1775.00 - 1780.60] the zinc when it comes to potato it's in
[1777.64 - 1782.56] the skin the skin of the potato is high
[1780.60 - 1784.52] in essential trace minerals it's a
[1782.56 - 1786.92] protective sheath around the potato
[1784.52 - 1790.00] around the pulp the trace minerals grow
[1786.92 - 1793.04] into the skin the zinc helps to protect
[1790.00 - 1796.12] us when we consume a potato it adds to a
[1793.04 - 1798.08] protective shield our own immune system
[1796.12 - 1800.60] when food science and research looks
[1798.08 - 1802.96] into the nutritional value of a potato
[1800.60 - 1805.48] they sample a larger portion from the
[1802.96 - 1807.96] center of the potato and a smaller
[1805.48 - 1810.56] portion of the skin or in many cases
[1807.96 - 1815.00] remove the skin altoe discard it and
[1810.56 - 1818.04] just test the skinless potato hey Frank
[1815.00 - 1821.32] uh today we're testing potatoes look see
[1818.04 - 1824.44] the sheet of paper it says uh you need
[1821.32 - 1827.64] one potato peeler okay uh Frank you see
[1824.44 - 1830.68] the potato peeler over there uh they say
[1827.64 - 1833.88] remove the skin of the potato uh they
[1830.68 - 1837.36] want a carbohydrate count and protein
[1833.88 - 1840.08] count and fat count and to look for some
[1837.36 - 1843.28] vitamins okay U just peeling the potato
[1840.08 - 1846.20] here ow almost cut my finger with that
[1843.28 - 1850.12] peeler um Frank what do we do with all
[1846.20 - 1853.24] the Skins just throw them out meanwhile
[1850.12 - 1855.92] the zinc is in the skin and it helps to
[1853.24 - 1858.60] protect us zinc is an essential weapon
[1855.92 - 1860.64] against viruses because viruses cause
[1858.60 - 1862.92] autoimmune and much of the chronic
[1860.64 - 1865.92] illness we're faced with today and the
[1862.92 - 1868.24] zinc in a potato is not just bi aailable
[1865.92 - 1871.28] but it's hyper absorbable which means
[1868.24 - 1873.76] your immune cells absorb it quickly
[1871.28 - 1876.32] instantly that matters when fighting an
[1873.76 - 1878.36] infection that's a make or break it
[1876.32 - 1880.80] matters if a bacteria and a wound is
[1878.36 - 1883.40] going to spread quickly or not the zinc
[1880.80 - 1885.92] enters cells easily because it attaches
[1883.40 - 1888.44] to the glucose inside the potato the
[1885.92 - 1890.40] potato has its own delivery system
[1888.44 - 1892.08] meaning it's like ordering a pizza and
[1890.40 - 1894.48] having it delivered to the house the
[1892.08 - 1896.80] pizza place has its own delivery system
[1894.48 - 1899.08] the glucose and the potato is the car
[1896.80 - 1900.76] with the guy in it the zinc is the pizza
[1899.08 - 1903.24] in his hand bringing it right to your
[1900.76 - 1905.64] front door of your cells if you're
[1903.24 - 1909.24] someone with trigeminal neuralgia jaw
[1905.64 - 1912.76] pain neck pain back pain Bells paly
[1909.24 - 1916.52] frozen shoulder fatigue burning skin
[1912.76 - 1919.00] rashes migraines dizziness eye floaters
[1916.52 - 1921.44] ringing in the years if you're someone
[1919.00 - 1924.12] with fibromyalgia Lyme disease
[1921.44 - 1927.72] rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis
[1924.12 - 1930.60] lupus pots enal syndrome endometriosis
[1927.72 - 1932.88] PCOS and these are just some then you're
[1930.60 - 1937.48] dealing with viruses in the herpes
[1932.88 - 1942.52] family Epstein bar shingles virus hhv6
[1937.48 - 1945.00] hhv7 sedom virus simplex 1 Simplex 2 and
[1942.52 - 1948.04] you know what's needed to battle that Li
[1945.00 - 1950.48] scene and it helps to SL slow them down
[1948.04 - 1955.08] so your immune system can help defend
[1950.48 - 1958.36] you and potato has Eline so let's talk
[1955.08 - 1960.40] glucose sugar the carb everything that
[1958.36 - 1962.36] we're all complaining about sugar it's
[1960.40 - 1965.36] got carbs it's bad it's got what is that
[1962.36 - 1967.88] Sugar carbohydrates that's bad stuff
[1965.36 - 1970.24] well guess what potatoes possess the
[1967.88 - 1972.92] right kind of it the right kind of
[1970.24 - 1975.44] carbohydrate one that's received by our
[1972.92 - 1978.16] intestinal tract as if it was Mother's
[1975.44 - 1981.04] Milk good bacteria our intestinal tract
[1978.16 - 1983.96] feed off of glucose from potatoes it
[1981.04 - 1985.96] nourishes them it keeps them strong a
[1983.96 - 1988.80] complex carbohydrate that grows
[1985.96 - 1992.36] underground specifically potato has a
[1988.80 - 1995.00] correlation to good bacteria potatoes
[1992.36 - 1998.00] never see the light they're in the earth
[1995.00 - 2000.40] while growing and many varieties of the
[1998.00 - 2003.12] more potent good bacteria never see the
[2000.40 - 2006.48] light either they grow deep within our
[2003.12 - 2008.08] gut soil born microorganisms cluster
[2006.48 - 2011.28] around potatoes as they grow in the
[2008.08 - 2013.40] earth these soil born microorganisms
[2011.28 - 2016.40] feed off of natural sugars being
[2013.40 - 2019.16] released from the potato skins as they
[2016.40 - 2022.08] expand during the growing process under
[2019.16 - 2024.80] the Earth the potatoes sweat as they
[2022.08 - 2027.20] grow they release water during droughts
[2024.80 - 2029.64] and dry times these soil born
[2027.20 - 2032.20] microorganisms feed off of this drink
[2029.64 - 2034.28] the water they have a similarity to some
[2032.20 - 2037.04] of our good bacteria that resides in our
[2034.28 - 2040.20] gut it's a food they both have a
[2037.04 - 2042.88] connection to the glucose and potatoes
[2040.20 - 2046.24] the sugar is critical for restoring the
[2042.88 - 2048.84] nervous system any neurological symptom
[2046.24 - 2052.72] and condition means the nerves are
[2048.84 - 2057.88] inflamed and a need to be fueled up and
[2052.72 - 2060.20] restored anxiety depression ticks spasms
[2057.88 - 2062.56] aches pains these are just some
[2060.20 - 2066.04] neurological symptoms and conditions and
[2062.56 - 2068.16] glucose and potato is restorative so
[2066.04 - 2071.72] let's talk about the digestive system
[2068.16 - 2073.88] from food poisoning to colitis potatoes
[2071.72 - 2076.16] have brought back a lot of people from
[2073.88 - 2079.12] living hell with their suffering one of
[2076.16 - 2081.72] my favorite tools pieces of knowledge is
[2079.12 - 2082.60] mono eating potatoes when in difficult
[2081.72 - 2084.84] Health
[2082.60 - 2087.44] situations I've seen just eating
[2084.84 - 2090.08] potatoes for breakfast lunch and dinner
[2087.44 - 2092.40] along with celery juice some lemon water
[2090.08 - 2095.08] some lettu uses here and there I've seen
[2092.40 - 2100.36] it bring back people from Crohn's
[2095.08 - 2104.40] colitis sibo Celiac IBS ulcers acid
[2100.36 - 2107.48] reflux hives gastritis gastroparesis
[2104.40 - 2110.04] diarrhea cramping I've seen it recover
[2107.48 - 2113.00] people from post food poisoning where
[2110.04 - 2114.48] nothing else would one reason is because
[2113.00 - 2116.88] potatoes are so soothing on the
[2114.48 - 2119.08] digestive tract and nerves especially
[2116.88 - 2121.36] dealing with colitis where there are
[2119.08 - 2123.80] large pockets of inflamed tissue within
[2121.36 - 2126.52] the colon which is unknowingly caused by
[2123.80 - 2129.52] the shingles virus knowing these medical
[2126.52 - 2132.68] me tools has helped save a lot of people
[2129.52 - 2135.28] with their colitis and potatoes sue the
[2132.68 - 2137.76] lining of the colon they don't aggravate
[2135.28 - 2140.40] the lining it's not an aggressive food
[2137.76 - 2143.24] it's a gentle food so let's talk about a
[2140.40 - 2145.68] few other conditions many people get
[2143.24 - 2148.40] diagnosed with sibo these days it's
[2145.68 - 2151.24] bacteria in the small intestinal tract
[2148.40 - 2153.80] but what kind of bacteria that's the
[2151.24 - 2155.44] question right there medical communities
[2153.80 - 2157.56] they don't know it's just like you got
[2155.44 - 2159.40] sibo overgrowth the bacteria that's
[2157.56 - 2162.28] what's happening down there but what
[2159.40 - 2164.56] kind it's strep to coctus that's what
[2162.28 - 2168.40] people don't know that's a dominating
[2164.56 - 2170.48] bacteria inside people's guts and strep
[2168.40 - 2176.16] likes to eat it likes to eat all kinds
[2170.48 - 2180.48] of foods cheese eggs milk butter right
[2176.16 - 2184.00] but strep doesn't like potatoes so when
[2180.48 - 2187.08] you eat a potato it goes down the Chute
[2184.00 - 2190.00] the tiny stringy fibers inside potato
[2187.08 - 2192.96] grab on to strep bacteria and wind them
[2190.00 - 2196.92] up balls them up and pulls them out of
[2192.96 - 2199.36] the gut irritable bowel syndrome IBS
[2196.92 - 2201.84] also caused by strepto coctus bacteria
[2199.36 - 2204.44] the bacteria slowly eats away at the
[2201.84 - 2207.44] colon lining and then tiny formations of
[2204.44 - 2209.84] scar tissue occur potatoes are soothing
[2207.44 - 2212.96] to the lining help feed the cells in the
[2209.84 - 2215.40] lining wall and as it's doing that it
[2212.96 - 2218.16] grabs onto bacteria it removes it out of
[2215.40 - 2221.48] the colon let's talk about ulcers in the
[2218.16 - 2225.36] stomach dadum small intestinal tract
[2221.48 - 2228.24] colon ulcers are caused by bacteria and
[2225.36 - 2231.12] viruses the canker stur virus which is a
[2228.24 - 2233.92] herpes family virus creates ulcers the
[2231.12 - 2236.36] lysine and potato helps to slow down and
[2233.92 - 2239.44] stop the canker sore virus allowing the
[2236.36 - 2242.48] ulcer to heal other ulcers are caused by
[2239.44 - 2245.04] strepto octus and eoli potatoes bind on
[2242.48 - 2248.00] to exposed bacteria as the potato moves
[2245.04 - 2251.04] over the ulcers helping to drive the
[2248.00 - 2254.20] bacteria out of the gut most varieties
[2251.04 - 2257.00] of strep are antibiotic resistant or
[2254.20 - 2259.72] partially immune to antibiotics but
[2257.00 - 2262.48] strap and other types of bacteria cannot
[2259.72 - 2265.32] become immune to what potato has to
[2262.48 - 2267.56] offer have you ever had food poisoning
[2265.32 - 2270.12] it hits you out of nowhere sometimes 12
[2267.56 - 2272.08] to 24 hours after you've been exposed
[2270.12 - 2273.92] after you've consume the food that had
[2272.08 - 2278.04] bacteria in it or a mutated
[2273.92 - 2283.64] microorganism or a food born toxin
[2278.04 - 2285.60] Ow o oh my stomach hurts why is it like
[2283.64 - 2288.52] this what did I
[2285.60 - 2292.36] eat I had those nachos and I ordered
[2288.52 - 2296.20] some fish oh my God I'm in so much pain
[2292.36 - 2298.16] I I can't even talk I I'm nauseous it's
[2296.20 - 2300.72] in the center of my gut like the pit of
[2298.16 - 2302.68] my gut I got to get to the bathroom no I
[2300.72 - 2305.16] need to get to the bed and lay there oh
[2302.68 - 2307.44] I got to get to the bathroom we've all
[2305.16 - 2310.44] been there before it's a brutal
[2307.44 - 2313.44] experience sometimes even dangerous very
[2310.44 - 2315.44] dangerous you have your meal hours later
[2313.44 - 2318.04] you're feeling kind of sick and then it
[2315.44 - 2319.48] hits you you get a little nauseous then
[2318.04 - 2322.12] you get that terrible pain in your
[2319.48 - 2323.84] stomach so uncomfortable could even go
[2322.12 - 2326.20] straight to a point where you're just in
[2323.84 - 2329.00] gnawing pain some throw up or have
[2326.20 - 2332.84] diarrhea others have both could last a
[2329.00 - 2335.00] day a week hard to get fluids down I
[2332.84 - 2336.68] always tell people to sip coconut water
[2335.00 - 2339.04] when coming out of a bat of food
[2336.68 - 2341.84] poisoning but a lot of people have an
[2339.04 - 2344.64] uneasy stomach for days after sometimes
[2341.84 - 2346.92] a week after sometimes more than a week
[2344.64 - 2348.88] sometimes months and any food tends to
[2346.92 - 2352.48] not settle right or feel like it's not
[2348.88 - 2355.76] digesting and pain gas bloating can
[2352.48 - 2358.04] happen every day and potato on its own
[2355.76 - 2360.48] is a powerful way to recover from post
[2358.04 - 2363.60] food poisoning I've helped many do it
[2360.48 - 2366.56] over the last 35 years sometimes it's
[2363.60 - 2368.80] the only food it feels gentle enough but
[2366.56 - 2371.04] satiating enough but gives you something
[2368.80 - 2373.24] back so you can gain your strength
[2371.04 - 2376.24] here's something to think about where's
[2373.24 - 2378.88] your protein people worry about that all
[2376.24 - 2380.32] the time what food you're eating where
[2378.88 - 2384.08] you getting your protein every single
[2380.32 - 2386.60] day potato it's not seen or viewed as a
[2384.08 - 2388.88] food with protein in it meanwhile it
[2386.60 - 2390.80] does have protein it's the quality of
[2388.88 - 2393.16] protein that matters and it's
[2390.80 - 2395.56] bioavailability the protein and potato
[2393.16 - 2398.48] can be assimilated easy and broken down
[2395.56 - 2401.92] easy another thing to think about is
[2398.48 - 2404.64] trace minerals potatoes are packed with
[2401.92 - 2407.28] them anyone that says potatoes are just
[2404.64 - 2410.20] a ball of empty carbs void of nutrients
[2407.28 - 2412.96] and minerals is unaware of the truth
[2410.20 - 2415.40] potatoes grow underground they absorb
[2412.96 - 2417.92] trace minerals potatoes are not going to
[2415.40 - 2420.60] be considered as a superfood there's no
[2417.92 - 2423.20] get-rich scheme with potato farming and
[2420.60 - 2425.72] you can't fluff potatoes up and package
[2423.20 - 2428.76] them up as a fancy new herb from the
[2425.72 - 2431.88] Amazon or special ryome that has magical
[2428.76 - 2434.48] powers in healing or superfood the
[2431.88 - 2438.72] minute you say potato everybody's eyes
[2434.48 - 2441.92] glaze over it's the ultimate food wait
[2438.72 - 2445.20] no the ultimate taken for granted
[2441.92 - 2448.32] healing food there's not a magical
[2445.20 - 2451.16] special Majestic vibe that comes off a
[2448.32 - 2454.52] potato nothing Sparkles when someone
[2451.16 - 2456.92] says try some potatoes that'll help you
[2454.52 - 2459.24] okay so the best way to eat potatoes to
[2456.92 - 2462.00] get the best healing support from them
[2459.24 - 2464.56] is steamed I know people love to bake
