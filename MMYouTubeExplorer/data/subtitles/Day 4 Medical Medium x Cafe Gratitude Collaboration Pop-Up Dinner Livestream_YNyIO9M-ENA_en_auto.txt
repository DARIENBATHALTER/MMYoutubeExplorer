[8.68 - 14.08] with the man Chef Drew who uh
[11.72 - 16.56] collaborated with aw on the dishes that
[14.08 - 18.36] are featured on the menu now Chef Drew

[18.36 - 23.08] you as well it's so happy to be here yes

[23.08 - 28.32] movement now every juice bar restaurant
[25.76 - 30.08] health food store have celery juice but
[28.32 - 31.76] what is it like to be the first
[30.08 - 34.04] restaurant to collaborate on medical
[31.76 - 35.68] medium dishes well I feel like Cafe
[34.04 - 37.12] Gratitude you know we have a 20-year
[35.68 - 39.16] history now and we've sort of been a
[37.12 - 40.88] Trailblazer in our own way both in the
[39.16 - 43.44] transformational sphere and the werness
[40.88 - 45.12] sphere uh we were doing cold brew coffee
[43.44 - 46.88] and cold press juices you know well
[45.12 - 49.40] before most restaurants you know 20
[46.88 - 51.56] years ago but this is a really beautiful
[49.40 - 54.36] opportunity to kind of build on what was
[51.56 - 56.00] our traditions in the past and bring the
[54.36 - 58.32] food and the philosophy of the medical
[56.00 - 60.04] medium Community out to our Cafe
[58.32 - 62.00] Gratitude customers as well as sering
[60.04 - 63.32] your community here you know and having
[62.00 - 64.48] letting them have the experience of a
[63.32 - 65.88] place where they can come and eat in a
[64.48 - 67.84] restaurant environment so it's very
[65.88 - 70.00] exciting yeah we have just been having
[67.84 - 72.48] the most incredible week it's night four
[70.00 - 74.80] our final night now how do you feel this
[72.48 - 75.80] whole four nights have gone well you
[74.80 - 78.12] know I think when we originally
[75.80 - 80.92] conceived it I wasn't expecting it to be
[78.12 - 82.84] so well supported by the community so
[80.92 - 84.36] just seeing this whole setup all the
[82.84 - 86.28] work that you've all been doing and the
[84.36 - 88.20] way that your community has showed up
[86.28 - 89.92] and really sort of taken advantage of it
[88.20 - 91.40] and embraced it has been an incred
[89.92 - 93.12] incredible sort of enlightening
[91.40 - 95.40] experience for me and it's been super
[93.12 - 97.80] fun you know super fun and it's rare
[95.40 - 99.96] that you find a group of people so open
[97.80 - 102.20] and happy and supportive and really
[99.96 - 103.92] committed to health and wellness yeah
[102.20 - 106.56] it's such an uplifting beautiful
[103.92 - 109.20] community and I feel like you're
[106.56 - 111.24] bringing joy and happiness to this
[109.20 - 113.28] community through a dining experience
[111.24 - 114.32] that normally they wouldn't get because
[113.28 - 115.84] you know they worry about the
[114.32 - 118.44] ingredients on the menu so how does it
[115.84 - 120.56] feel to bring that joy and happiness to
[118.44 - 122.88] this community Through dining well I
[120.56 - 125.76] mean for me as a chef it's providing a
[122.88 - 127.64] Hospitality experience is always the the
[125.76 - 130.52] highest you know level of importance for
[127.64 - 132.32] me and you don't often I I personally
[130.52 - 135.08] have a diet that's very similar to the
[132.32 - 136.88] medical medium protocol um some slight
[135.08 - 139.32] variations but I'm a long-term you know
[136.88 - 141.28] vegan and I I sort of you know don't
[139.32 - 144.56] usually use oils and and you know
[141.28 - 148.36] heavily refined Foods either so my own
[144.56 - 150.88] food is now being influenced by the this
[148.36 - 153.24] community and what we're doing here so I
[150.88 - 155.76] just feel that it's a really great
[153.24 - 157.16] opportunity for me to build on the the
[155.76 - 158.76] menu that I've done for all these years
[157.16 - 161.32] of Cafe Gratitude the work that I've
[158.76 - 163.04] done in this community and maybe find a
[161.32 - 165.20] new way to express myself as a chef so
[163.04 - 168.20] it's been great it is so beautiful like
[165.20 - 170.40] the crossover of communities uh one
[168.20 - 173.12] finding out about the other and and so
[170.40 - 175.60] on now aw has said that you have taken
[173.12 - 177.36] his recipes to the next level like you
[175.60 - 179.00] really upped the flavor profile how did
[177.36 - 180.92] you do that well he's being very
[179.00 - 183.52] generous for all
[180.92 - 186.00] um I think that it was an interesting
[183.52 - 187.64] set of guidelines to work with um in a
[186.00 - 189.20] restaurant context like I as I said
[187.64 - 191.32] earlier my own personal diet and the way
[189.20 - 192.60] I eat and my private life is one thing
[191.32 - 195.32] but when you're in a restaurant setting
[192.60 - 196.96] and you're trying to create food that is
[195.32 - 199.44] going to appeal to a broad spectrum of
[196.96 - 200.56] people with those I don't want to say
[199.44 - 203.40] restrictions but with those
[200.56 - 205.96] considerations right like not using soy
[203.40 - 208.16] not using vinegars not using corn you
[205.96 - 209.56] know nuts and gluten and all that stuff
[208.16 - 211.96] I was sort of halfway there already
[209.56 - 213.72] because we are primarily gluten-free you
[211.96 - 216.88] know I don't use any refined you know
[213.72 - 219.88] vegan foods in in the menu but this was
[216.88 - 222.24] a way for me to look at um I don't know
[219.88 - 224.68] how I want to say this but to really go
[222.24 - 226.44] I hate to use this word cleaner you know
[224.68 - 229.96] with with everything that we're doing
[226.44 - 231.48] and um I feel like just slight changes
[229.96 - 234.76] can make a really big difference in the
[231.48 - 235.88] flavor the flavor profile of foods so
[234.76 - 237.96] yeah and there's people that have
[235.88 - 239.48] traveled here from all around the world
[237.96 - 241.20] and they're just loving your work well
[239.48 - 243.56] thank you I mean it's been I've actually
[241.20 - 245.08] been very surprised by by how well it's
[243.56 - 247.12] been received and I do think it's
[245.08 - 249.00] because they haven't had the opportunity
[247.12 - 250.88] I mean I feel I feel great about the
[249.00 - 252.40] work that I've done with this menu um
[250.88 - 253.76] and I'm just really happy that people
[252.40 - 256.28] are appreciating it I don't know how
[253.76 - 257.80] else to say it yeah everyone's talking
[256.28 - 259.76] about the sushi
[257.80 - 260.92] rolls oh my gosh incredible they're
[259.76 - 262.60] saying they've never had anything like
[260.92 - 265.32] it before so can you tell me more about
[262.60 - 266.76] them well I think that you know a lot of
[265.32 - 267.68] people when they do a vegan Sushi
[266.76 - 268.80] especially when you're saying oh we
[267.68 - 270.52] don't want vinegar we don't want sugar
[268.80 - 272.40] you don't want to but you know you could
[270.52 - 274.12] what I did was I looked at it how can I
[272.40 - 275.60] season this in a way that follows these
[274.12 - 276.88] guidelines you know so I use some lemon
[275.60 - 280.48] juice I use a little bit of honey I use
[276.88 - 282.16] some dull flakes um the pumpkin SE tofu
[280.48 - 283.48] has been a big hit which is another you
[282.16 - 286.04] know thing that not many people are
[283.48 - 288.80] aware of so that gives it a nice sort of
[286.04 - 290.40] proteiny kind of vibe that that a normal
[288.80 - 293.40] vegetable Sushi doesn't have we use a
[290.40 - 295.64] high quality rice um yeah keeping it
[293.40 - 297.60] clean and simple but playing with the
[295.64 - 299.16] flavor profile to give it a bit of a
[297.60 - 301.40] punch you know how long does that
[299.16 - 304.24] pumpkin food take to is that a process
[301.40 - 306.04] we marinate well yeah so we get the the
[304.24 - 309.00] base ingredients and then we marinate it
[306.04 - 310.76] overnight um so yeah I mean it's not
[309.00 - 312.32] it's not that complicated no I mean most
[310.76 - 315.84] tofu people don't realize it's actually
[312.32 - 318.40] fairly simple food to make yeah yeah wow
[315.84 - 321.04] and the the Millet tortillas tortillas I
[318.40 - 322.68] had those on Friday night and the way
[321.04 - 324.68] they hold together that was a bit of a
[322.68 - 327.04] journey I mean it's taking us a little
[324.68 - 328.32] while to get the hang of that I know and
[327.04 - 329.92] you know we've had a lot of disasters
[328.32 - 331.84] but I think we finally have got it down
[329.92 - 333.40] inshi rolling is a new thing for my team
[331.84 - 335.68] as well but they've really they finally
[333.40 - 337.24] like having made hundreds now um because
[335.68 - 339.04] it's been a super popular menu item
[337.24 - 340.68] they're getting very good at it so well
[339.04 - 342.08] I'm Blown Away by the dishes that you've
[340.68 - 344.80] created for the medical medium
[342.08 - 346.08] collaboration uh we are about to start
[344.80 - 347.36] with some of our dinner guest and I know
[346.08 - 348.68] that you're very busy you've got to get

[375.92 - 381.52] a Lifetime really um I'm from a small
[378.24 - 383.36] community in Canada so I never get to
[381.52 - 385.64] eat out and I'm sure it won't happen
[383.36 - 387.56] again for a long time so I'm really
[385.64 - 390.16] excited for this food it's amazing I've
[387.56 - 391.72] already tried it it's fantastic
[390.16 - 393.80] yes did you come with anyone this
[391.72 - 395.84] evening or did you come alone or met up
[393.80 - 397.88] with friends here so yeah really excited
[395.84 - 399.52] to dine with everybody and get to know
[397.88 - 401.12] more people because there's just so many
[399.52 - 402.68] people in the community that I think
[401.12 - 404.16] even when I think I've seen everybody
[402.68 - 406.92] like there's just so many of us and it's
[404.16 - 408.04] so many M mate that's right what are you
[406.92 - 409.72] most excited about with this
[408.04 - 412.96] collaboration between medical medium and
[409.72 - 414.76] Cafe Gratitude the fearlessness of being
[412.96 - 417.40] able to order food and knowing that
[414.76 - 420.52] somebody understands why I eat this way
[417.40 - 422.60] and what I need to feel comfortable you
[420.52 - 423.84] know they are creating their business
[422.60 - 425.76] because they want to provide something
[423.84 - 428.08] for the people and so the fact that they
[425.76 - 429.76] meet our needs is just amazing it is
[428.08 - 431.12] incredible how did your medical medium
[429.76 - 433.92] journey start how did you first come
[431.12 - 436.00] across the information I'm lucky enough
[433.92 - 438.56] that my sister came across the
[436.00 - 441.60] information actually she was really sick
[438.56 - 443.24] she needed a lot of help um but she was
[441.60 - 444.96] not really sure if she could trust the
[443.24 - 447.36] information yet she didn't know whether
[444.96 - 450.44] to really take it on or not and she kept
[447.36 - 451.76] conving in me and asking what do I think
[450.44 - 453.60] of it and at the time I didn't know
[451.76 - 456.24] medical medium I didn't understand the
[453.60 - 458.20] concept so I wasn't super supportive but
[456.24 - 459.44] luckily I told her I was like I'll read
[458.20 - 462.76] the book and tell you why I think it's
[459.44 - 465.60] probably not real and after page five I
[462.76 - 467.56] said oh my God I think this is it and
[465.60 - 470.00] from then I just started to implement
[467.56 - 473.08] small steps every two weeks I give
[470.00 - 474.68] myself a timeline and say if if if
[473.08 - 476.24] something happens then I know it works
[474.68 - 478.92] if it doesn't then I can say I was right
[476.24 - 481.72] all along you know but and here you are
[478.92 - 483.84] now gratitude exactly and everything
[481.72 - 485.56] worked that I tried to this day I've
[483.84 - 488.04] been doing medical medium for 8 years
[485.56 - 490.40] and everything he recommends does
[488.04 - 492.88] something it moves the needle in
[490.40 - 494.28] miraculous ways wow so what are some of
[492.88 - 496.00] the health benefits that you found from
[494.28 - 497.32] using medical medium information and
[496.00 - 498.80] what were some of the symptoms and
[497.32 - 501.68] conditions you were dealing with prior
[498.80 - 503.64] to starting this my worst and severe
[501.68 - 505.56] most severe condition was mental health
[503.64 - 509.84] issues I dealt with a lot of depression
[505.56 - 513.96] and anxiety and OCD thoughts um and even
[509.84 - 516.16] like dyslexia add and just over like
[513.96 - 518.56] committing it takes time but when you
[516.16 - 521.12] commit it changes and so now I no longer
[518.56 - 523.08] have dyslexia and for me I mean that has
[521.12 - 525.24] been amazing because it's meant I have
[523.08 - 529.08] new employment opportunities that I
[525.24 - 532.12] never had before and just you know it
[529.08 - 534.72] just it just changes everything when you
[532.12 - 537.24] can be yourself and succeed when you
[534.72 - 538.72] didn't have the opportunity before yeah
[537.24 - 539.92] that's incredible do you have an
[538.72 - 543.20] encouraging message you would like to
[539.92 - 545.04] share with the community online sure um
[543.20 - 547.92] I think really it's it's small steps to
[545.04 - 549.60] Perfection um or to progress as however
[547.92 - 552.08] anyone wants to say it and it doesn't
[549.60 - 554.84] have to be done overnight um we took
[552.08 - 556.88] years and decades to get sick and so it
[554.84 - 559.36] takes time to heal and I think it you
[556.88 - 561.08] just have to commit to it you know and I
[559.36 - 563.56] see it as a challenge a lot of times of
[561.08 - 566.72] like how much more can my body heal how
[563.56 - 570.16] much more can I improve and what changes
[566.72 - 572.12] can happen because it's it is ulous what
[570.16 - 573.60] happens I like the way you're saying
[572.12 - 575.28] that it takes time I think that's really
[573.60 - 576.36] good to remind people it's not overnight
[575.28 - 578.96] especially if you've been dealing with
[576.36 - 581.36] it for a long time but also I like how
[578.96 - 583.36] you say how healthy can I get or how how
[581.36 - 585.60] much can I improve that's that's kind of
[583.36 - 586.96] cool to focus on it it is really cool
[585.60 - 589.16] and sometimes I think okay I must be
[586.96 - 591.36] done healing now and then I do another
[589.16 - 593.48] 369 and I'm like oh wow but more
[591.36 - 595.96] happened like what else could it be that
[593.48 - 597.24] that changes so it's very cool are you

[682.76 - 687.60] autoimmune he's going to have it for the
[684.40 - 689.88] rest of his life um probably managed by
[687.60 - 692.16] Pharmaceuticals and I just would accept
[689.88 - 694.64] it it just did not
[692.16 - 697.56] resonate and um I was sitting in the
[694.64 - 699.96] garden and I was in such despair I was

[954.48 - 959.44] and how did you discover uh aw medical
[956.84 - 962.52] medium information I
[959.44 - 966.28] discovered medical medium about six or
[962.52 - 968.28] seven years ago or when his F he just
[966.28 - 970.68] had two books at that time so that's the
[968.28 - 973.12] how how long it was he had um medical
[970.68 - 975.32] medium and life-changing foods and I was
[973.12 - 979.24] really struggling I had a fibroid and I
[975.32 - 981.48] had um many surgeries and so his
[979.24 - 984.76] information stopped the
[981.48 - 986.36] surgeries wow so I was supposed to have
[984.76 - 988.56] um another one and I didn't need it
[986.36 - 990.20] after I found his info oh that's
[988.56 - 992.08] incredible so did you first start with
[990.20 - 996.32] the celery juice and then add on from
[992.08 - 998.32] there I I did but I um I really
[996.32 - 999.88] gravitated towards the heavy metal detox
[998.32 - 1002.00] smoothie that was a very important piece
[999.88 - 1005.00] and that was the thing that I was the
[1002.00 - 1007.00] most diligent with and then
[1005.00 - 1009.04] supplementation and then changing like
[1007.00 - 1011.32] removing troublemakers that's that was
[1009.04 - 1015.04] my first wave and I feel like every year
[1011.32 - 1017.80] I go deeper and deeper yeah so healing
[1015.04 - 1019.48] more and more healing more and more yeah
[1017.80 - 1020.48] now because we're here at Cafe gratitude
[1019.48 - 1021.72] and there's the medical medium
[1020.48 - 1023.56] collaboration I've got to ask you what
[1021.72 - 1028.52] are you most excited about this evening
[1023.56 - 1030.92] oh my gosh okay so I used to love sushi
[1028.52 - 1033.72] and so I'm really excited about the the
[1030.92 - 1035.56] pumpkin sushi cuz I I don't eat sushi
[1033.72 - 1036.84] anymore yeah no they have been a
[1035.56 - 1038.16] favorite with everyone that's come
[1036.84 - 1039.72] through everyone's talking about the
[1038.16 - 1042.28] sushi it's
[1039.72 - 1045.88] amazing yeah I can't wait the food I am
[1042.28 - 1049.52] so excited but I'll also say going back
[1045.88 - 1052.08] to Healing any women out there um with
[1049.52 - 1053.92] menopause issues medical medium is the
[1052.08 - 1056.16] way there's so many women I've turned on
[1053.92 - 1058.40] to Medical medium that are struggling
[1056.16 - 1060.52] horrifically with menopause like I went
[1058.40 - 1063.00] through menopause a few years ago and
[1060.52 - 1065.64] not a single hot flash not a single
[1063.00 - 1068.16] symptom feeling so healthy like it is
[1065.64 - 1070.40] the way it is the way that is great
[1068.16 - 1072.28] information do you have like one bit of
[1070.40 - 1074.52] information in regards to that that you
[1072.28 - 1076.20] would say is the most important you felt
[1074.52 - 1078.84] with your healing uh that You' like to
[1076.20 - 1080.40] share with the community online um the
[1078.84 - 1083.20] celery juice like I was a little bit
[1080.40 - 1085.84] resistant cuz I didn't enjoy the taste
[1083.20 - 1087.76] at first like I love it now I was
[1085.84 - 1091.24] gravitating more towards the heavy metal
[1087.76 - 1093.60] detox smoothie but um celery juice and
[1091.24 - 1096.44] avoiding troublemakers is a good start
[1093.60 - 1098.40] like that alone will help significantly
[1096.44 - 1101.92] and then the more that you can bring in
[1098.40 - 1103.80] of the protocols the easier it'll be yes

[1631.40 - 1637.20] actually made a friend from the first
[1632.68 - 1638.68] event um ali um and um we connected
[1637.20 - 1640.04] instantly you just connect with every in
[1638.68 - 1641.92] the community it's actually something
[1640.04 - 1643.60] that we all understand each other and we
[1641.92 - 1646.32] don't have to say much we just
[1643.60 - 1648.92] understand we've been through a lot um
[1646.32 - 1650.52] and we have that in common and just like
[1648.92 - 1651.96] we know where we're coming from and I
[1650.52 - 1654.76] think the community is like one of the
[1651.96 - 1657.52] best parts um of this I for years and
[1654.76 - 1659.72] years like I was just in and out of the
[1657.52 - 1660.96] hospital sick mystery illness doctors
[1659.72 - 1664.56] don't know what they take all these
[1660.96 - 1665.88] tests same with my mom and um nothing
[1664.56 - 1667.68] they're just like you seem healthy but
[1665.88 - 1669.68] yet they know I'm very sick they're like
[1667.68 - 1672.04] but you look very sick I am very sick I
[1669.68 - 1674.04] know you know you know your own body and
[1672.04 - 1676.68] no one understood until we found this
[1674.04 - 1678.80] for once we feel understood for once
[1676.68 - 1681.68] like he's saying um
[1678.80 - 1683.40] for the chronically ill and no if no one
[1681.68 - 1685.04] even knows what that means like other
[1683.40 - 1686.60] people so it's like finally I felt like
[1685.04 - 1688.68] I was seeing like friendch should be
[1686.60 - 1690.20] like well you look fine or you know they
[1688.68 - 1691.72] didn't understand if you can't come out
[1690.20 - 1692.92] no understands you're just in bed of
[1691.72 - 1694.92] course you want to be going out you want
[1692.92 - 1697.28] to be living life you want to experience
[1694.92 - 1699.92] things and then it just holds you back
[1697.28 - 1701.76] and so many people don't understand that
[1699.92 - 1704.88] unless unfortunately they've been
[1701.76 - 1706.68] through it so this is something that is
[1704.88 - 1708.52] like nothing else I never even knew this
[1706.68 - 1710.20] existed um my heart goes goes out for
[1708.52 - 1712.60] everybody else who's not met this
[1710.20 - 1714.72] community yet and hopefully they find it
[1712.60 - 1716.44] um cuz you do feel alone like why me
[1714.72 - 1719.00] what's wrong with me um until you find
[1716.44 - 1720.92] and applied information I've been you

[3580.16 - 3585.92] Thiago and Anthony you know he's non
[3582.40 - 3588.00] verbal so he has symptoms and he can't
[3585.92 - 3591.24] communicate with me and he can't tell me
[3588.00 - 3593.12] what's going on so I have to go off by
[3591.24 - 3595.00] what I see the symptoms that I see
[3593.12 - 3597.76] Spirit of compassion says belly ache
[3595.00 - 3600.20] sometimes that's the spirit says so so
[3597.76 - 3603.28] belly ache and it's very hard to express
[3600.20 - 3605.92] it but yeah there's no communication so
[3603.28 - 3608.08] I go off by the symptoms and I go to the
[3605.92 - 3610.80] book and then from there I go to the
[3608.08 - 3613.16] protocols so and then he rubs his ear
[3610.80 - 3617.32] too once in a while and so sometimes it
[3613.16 - 3620.00] gets itchy inside okay so I just want to

[3751.00 - 3757.08] first question is will I heal my EMF
[3753.00 - 3758.60] sensitivity and if so how EMF EMF always
[3757.08 - 3760.28] always heals when you when you do the
[3758.60 - 3763.60] right things it always
[3760.28 - 3766.24] heals okay people don't stay in EMF hell
[3763.60 - 3768.48] forever if they do the right things okay
[3766.24 - 3770.68] so you have you have the information and
[3768.48 - 3773.76] EMF will heal what's the other question
[3770.68 - 3775.48] um so I created an affirmation card deck
[3773.76 - 3777.92] based off of the healing path Wellness
[3775.48 - 3779.16] step for that you taught us how to do
[3777.92 - 3782.12] and I was wondering if you would
[3779.16 - 3784.00] autograph my card de of course I would

[3784.00 - 3788.96] you this one I can grab that back from

[3791.08 - 3795.88] remember to do them regularly okay my
[3793.48 - 3798.56] favorite one is I work for God and you

[5636.64 - 5640.48] with curses where I come from people
[5638.40 - 5642.88] believe in that and it causes so much
[5640.48 - 5645.76] fear so I don't know if that exists if

[8039.32 - 8044.96] that the information the books literally
[8042.24 - 8047.88] landed on my doorstep I mean mind blown
[8044.96 - 8050.76] all on its own just divinely landed
[8047.88 - 8052.24] there and how did you trust how did you
[8050.76 - 8054.64] trust it was the
[8052.24 - 8056.28] information and I know so many people in
[8054.64 - 8059.68] the community can relate just reading
[8056.28 - 8061.72] those words it's like that knowing
[8059.68 - 8064.16] right and everything
[8061.72 - 8067.16] and still blows my mind to think that is
[8064.16 - 8069.80] just hanging around it blows my mind too
[8067.16 - 8071.52] on a daily um and I mean I've talked
[8069.80 - 8073.76] about it a little bit on social media
[8071.52 - 8075.48] but it's it's really personal to me but
[8073.76 - 8077.92] when I flipped the back and I saw your

[8077.92 - 8082.76] like I knew you and I do have a kind of
[8080.60 - 8085.08] understanding of what it is but like
[8082.76 - 8087.76] your your essence was there and I could
[8085.08 - 8089.72] feel it in the photo and I it felt like

[10253.68 - 10258.80] meaning to me when I first walked into
[10256.28 - 10262.84] this restaurant I walked into this one
[10258.80 - 10265.04] right here all right my mind was blown
[10262.84 - 10267.36] my mind was blown and spirit of
[10265.04 - 10270.44] compassion told me there was a soul in
[10267.36 - 10271.72] this restaurant it has a soul and I
[10270.44 - 10273.12] haven't experienced that and I've been
[10271.72 - 10275.76] in a lot of restaurants throughout the
[10273.12 - 10279.88] years and I didn't experience that but
[10275.76 - 10283.36] in here I did I never forgot it ever and
[10279.88 - 10285.44] to think that years later over a decade

[10403.44 - 10408.52] C can I give you the floor for a second
[10405.60 - 10410.20] is that okay sure um what was it like
[10408.52 - 10412.28] what was it like when you first put
[10410.20 - 10414.72] these dishes together what were you
[10412.28 - 10417.88] thinking were you like that aw this
[10414.72 - 10418.96] needs work right this needs work no
[10417.88 - 10421.08] definitely that's not what I was
[10418.96 - 10423.32] thinking but uh what I what I was
[10421.08 - 10426.24] thinking is that you know as a as a chef
[10423.32 - 10428.20] my job is to create food that will bring
[10426.24 - 10430.84] in all kinds of people right and so it
[10428.20 - 10432.88] was an interesting project to to use the
[10430.84 - 10435.68] protocols of this of this you know way
[10432.88 - 10438.28] of eating this this methodology and
[10435.68 - 10440.16] incorporated into the food in a way that
[10438.28 - 10441.80] not only would your community be
[10440.16 - 10444.12] interested in in eating this food but
[10441.80 - 10445.52] also the Cafe Gratitude community and
[10444.12 - 10447.84] and people who are new to both
[10445.52 - 10449.72] communities so that was the inspiration
[10447.84 - 10451.92] to really sort of like H how can I make
[10449.72 - 10453.12] this appealing to both sides of the
[10451.92 - 10456.48] spectrum
[10453.12 - 10460.32] so that is I really appreciate it we
[10456.48 - 10460.32] appreciate it you guys right
[10461.20 - 10465.24] and I actually I have another invitation
[10463.32 - 10468.64] to everybody as well for for those of
[10465.24 - 10471.72] you who know Cafe Gratitude uh we we
[10468.64 - 10473.80] started in 2004 uh it was created by
[10471.72 - 10475.52] Matthew and tery anglehart and what they
[10473.80 - 10477.80] did at one point was decided that they
[10475.52 - 10480.48] wanted to create a board game that
[10477.80 - 10482.20] brought our attention to abundance and
[10480.48 - 10484.00] gratitude so it was called the abounding
[10482.20 - 10485.92] river board game and they created it and
[10484.00 - 10487.40] then they decided why don't we create a
[10485.92 - 10489.00] little raw food restaurant where people
[10487.40 - 10491.04] can come and play that game and so
[10489.00 - 10492.88] literally the the board game was the
[10491.04 - 10494.40] tables and people would come in and it
[10492.88 - 10496.20] was sort of like a Trivial Pursuit game
[10494.40 - 10498.28] where you were ask you know certain
[10496.20 - 10501.84] things about your life and about your
[10498.28 - 10504.00] past and uh out of that evolved Cafe
[10501.84 - 10506.00] Gratitude and our question of the day
[10504.00 - 10509.52] which most of you may well some of you
[10506.00 - 10511.04] may know about and I invite you to ask

[12462.18 - 12465.29] [Music]
[12469.76 - 12474.00] hey guys we're back on the red carpet
[12471.48 - 12476.80] with aw and we have just been having a
[12474.00 - 12479.64] blast these past few nights aw I do have
[12476.80 - 12481.24] to ask you why is medical medium it's
[12479.64 - 12483.44] not a one-size fits-all can you talk
[12481.24 - 12485.24] about that a bit Yeah in the health
[12483.44 - 12487.68] world there's a lot of one siiz fits-all
[12485.24 - 12491.28] that's how it works if someone believes
[12487.68 - 12493.88] in one thing it's really restricted in
[12491.28 - 12496.96] so many ways medical medium information
[12493.88 - 12500.84] you could come in and you can can keep
[12496.96 - 12503.00] all these Foods in there that you love
[12500.84 - 12506.52] and do these and you can just take one
[12503.00 - 12509.52] thing and start one thing only and
[12506.52 - 12512.80] you're in it you're doing it and you can
[12509.52 - 12515.12] customize and you can't customize in all
[12512.80 - 12518.36] the other health Arenas but that keeps
[12515.12 - 12520.20] the healing aspect down low you know so
[12518.36 - 12522.04] what happens in the health world is
[12520.20 - 12524.28] because it's one size fits all and all
[12522.04 - 12526.12] these different Trends and diets and all
[12524.28 - 12528.52] that and they make it look like it's not
[12526.12 - 12531.28] one size pit all but it is and when you
[12528.52 - 12533.56] scratch the surface sure you get one out
[12531.28 - 12536.44] of a 100 people that start healing and
[12533.56 - 12539.60] they Harald that as it's the Holy Grail
[12536.44 - 12543.44] how about getting 99 out of 100 better
[12539.60 - 12546.84] fast how about getting 100 people healed
[12543.44 - 12549.68] a th000 people healed a million people
[12546.84 - 12552.76] healed and it takes something that's not

[15324.80 - 15329.12] all right I think we can do
[15327.60 - 15333.76] this
[15329.12 - 15333.76] hey good to see you guys
[15340.29 - 15345.56] [Applause]
[15343.96 - 15350.02] you ready for a little
[15345.56 - 15350.02] [Applause]
[15352.28 - 15358.48] talk you can have eyes and they can see
[15355.84 - 15362.88] fine
[15358.48 - 15365.60] right and everything looks
[15362.88 - 15367.64] good but yet there could be a fog and
[15365.60 - 15371.04] that fog is what a lot of you guys have
[15367.64 - 15373.28] been through which is the health
[15371.04 - 15377.76] movement and the medical system system
[15373.28 - 15377.76] too not forget that there's some fog in
[15378.16 - 15385.08] there and you got good eyes you can see
[15383.20 - 15389.24] but all these things are
[15385.08 - 15393.52] there and they become this thick
[15389.24 - 15396.20] fog all the different Trends all of it
[15393.52 - 15398.20] everything from what
[15396.20 - 15402.08] charcoal
[15398.20 - 15404.64] colostrum list goes on right I can name
[15402.08 - 15407.08] off a hundred things
[15404.64 - 15411.48] but we'll just talk about some other
[15407.08 - 15414.96] things too but it becomes like this fog
[15411.48 - 15417.56] that gets in the way and maybe that's no
[15414.96 - 15420.00] big deal for someone who feels
[15417.56 - 15422.32] fine maybe no big deal at all for
[15420.00 - 15423.48] somebody who just maybe needs to drop a
[15422.32 - 15426.08] couple of
[15423.48 - 15428.16] pounds maybe feel less
[15426.08 - 15431.84] sluggish but when you're somebody that's
[15428.16 - 15433.48] been really sick and really struggled
[15431.84 - 15437.28] for a long time
[15433.48 - 15438.92] 30 years 20 years 5 years 6 months 6
[15437.28 - 15440.84] months can be a long
[15438.92 - 15443.56] time that
[15440.84 - 15445.56] fog can seem death
[15443.56 - 15447.92] defying it could
[15445.56 - 15450.84] seem
[15447.92 - 15454.48] depressing something that holds you
[15450.84 - 15457.12] back you got eyes and you can see and
[15454.48 - 15460.04] you could see fine but that fog can
[15457.12 - 15463.52] really get in the way over time and
[15460.04 - 15465.40] maybe you guys experience this
[15463.52 - 15468.04] so when you're chronically sick and
[15465.40 - 15471.16] you've struggled for a while in your
[15468.04 - 15472.92] life it becomes like doors that end up
[15471.16 - 15476.12] closing on
[15472.92 - 15477.68] you it becomes a lot of confusion it's
[15476.12 - 15480.44] easy to get
[15477.68 - 15482.96] lost and I was told about that when I
[15480.44 - 15486.08] was young and I was a
[15482.96 - 15488.44] kid was told about that from Spirit of
[15486.08 - 15492.92] compassion because all I wanted to do
[15488.44 - 15495.60] was just go fishing in a pond ride my b
[15492.92 - 15499.04] icle hop on my
[15495.60 - 15501.12] skateboard that's all I wanted to do
[15499.04 - 15503.56] also go in nature too as
[15501.12 - 15505.44] well but Spirit of compassion would say
[15503.56 - 15507.00] well we have bigger things to do we have
[15505.44 - 15508.96] more important things to do there's a
[15507.00 - 15511.16] lot of people out there that need
[15508.96 - 15514.60] something and you know when you're six
[15511.16 - 15518.20] seven years old 8 years old that becomes
[15514.60 - 15521.84] a strange sound strange sound in your
[15518.20 - 15524.60] ear cuz it really doesn't make sense
[15521.84 - 15527.40] like what do people need what does it
[15524.60 - 15529.36] matter and spirit of compassion told me
[15527.40 - 15531.12] that someday there's going to be a lot
[15529.36 - 15533.24] of people out there they're going to be
[15531.12 - 15535.04] very sick they're going to be lost
[15533.24 - 15537.20] they're going to be in a fog and you're
[15535.04 - 15539.52] going to have to help them see
[15537.20 - 15541.36] differently you have to help them see
[15539.52 - 15544.40] things that actually can change their
[15541.36 - 15546.84] lives move them out of that Darkness out
[15544.40 - 15548.64] of that fog into the light of healing I
[15546.84 - 15552.04] heard that when I was seven eight years
[15548.64 - 15554.80] old and it was the most foreign strange
[15552.04 - 15557.12] words I've ever could imagin to hear at
[15554.80 - 15560.56] 7 years
[15557.12 - 15562.96] old it took a little while to care
[15560.56 - 15568.00] because I didn't want to
[15562.96 - 15571.20] care I cared about animals I cared about
[15568.00 - 15573.12] birds with a broken wing I cared about
[15571.20 - 15576.32] frogs with a broken
[15573.12 - 15579.32] leg I cared about
[15576.32 - 15581.80] caterpillars
[15579.32 - 15584.84] dragonflies I would get so sad when a
[15581.80 - 15587.64] dragonfly seemed weak and something was
[15584.84 - 15589.80] wrong I would try to give it water and
[15587.64 - 15593.84] revive
[15589.80 - 15594.96] it and what happens along the way when
[15593.84 - 15597.60] you're young like that and you're
[15594.96 - 15600.56] hearing this information you want to
[15597.60 - 15603.08] kind of avoid it but Spirit of
[15600.56 - 15606.60] compassion said you have to care with
[15603.08 - 15608.80] everything you have you have to care and
[15606.60 - 15611.80] so I did everything I could to reach
[15608.80 - 15614.76] deep when I was young and spirit of
[15611.80 - 15617.92] compassion said the same way you care
[15614.76 - 15623.12] about animals and the same way you care
[15617.92 - 15627.48] about dogs and cats and birds and
[15623.12 - 15630.48] turtles you have to care about people so
[15627.48 - 15632.32] it's 7 years old I was like okay okay
[15630.48 - 15634.80] I'm getting the hang of this I have to
[15632.32 - 15637.92] care about people I have to see what's
[15634.80 - 15640.48] going on and I wasn't
[15637.92 - 15642.88] sick and I say it all the time unless
[15640.48 - 15646.32] you've been sick and walk in someone 's
[15642.88 - 15649.52] shoes will you ever know what it feels
[15646.32 - 15651.92] like being that I wasn't sick that was
[15649.52 - 15653.68] the next Hill to climb for me because
[15651.92 - 15655.80] Spirit of compassion said somehow
[15653.68 - 15658.24] someway you have to know what it feels
[15655.80 - 15660.84] like you're going to have to experience
[15658.24 - 15661.92] it in your Consciousness in some way
[15660.84 - 15664.56] you're going to have to make that
[15661.92 - 15666.32] connection to someone suffering just
[15664.56 - 15668.64] because you're not there and you haven't
[15666.32 - 15671.24] suffered like that
[15668.64 - 15674.88] physically at a young age doesn't mean
[15671.24 - 15677.32] you can't connect and make that
[15674.88 - 15680.04] connection I remember seeing a wounded
[15677.32 - 15683.00] turtle that was hit by a car it was
[15680.04 - 15684.96] still alive when I was young I did
[15683.00 - 15689.72] everything I could to save it I couldn't
[15684.96 - 15689.72] save it was too injured shell was just
[15690.76 - 15696.72] fractured it was weak and weakening fast
[15694.92 - 15698.52] but I did everything I could and I beg
[15696.72 - 15700.48] Spirit of compassion to send down light
[15698.52 - 15703.44] and I sent that light with Spirit of
[15700.48 - 15705.92] compassion into that turtle through me
[15703.44 - 15709.28] and also to the turtle
[15705.92 - 15711.88] direct just like the light blast and we
[15709.28 - 15714.92] kept that turtle alive for as long as we
[15711.88 - 15716.60] could as long as we could a lot longer
[15714.92 - 15718.40] than it ever would have because it
[15716.60 - 15722.72] should have passed probably within a
[15718.40 - 15722.72] half an hour and it was alive for
[15722.84 - 15728.48] weeks but that Turtle still passed away
[15726.24 - 15731.48] because it was run over by a car so
[15728.48 - 15734.96] badly but that was the moment right
[15731.48 - 15738.72] there when I was like okay I'm awakened
[15734.96 - 15740.72] I'm awakened we have to save people we
[15738.72 - 15743.52] have to keep them alive we have to
[15740.72 - 15745.80] recover them we have to bring them back
[15743.52 - 15748.12] no matter what happens we need to do
[15745.80 - 15752.16] that and at 7 years old I made the
[15748.12 - 15752.16] connection and that's when I was
[15753.64 - 15760.16] reborn I wasn't the same person as I was
[15756.88 - 15764.08] when I was 4 years old or 5 years old or
[15760.16 - 15766.80] one it was a rebirthing for for me to
[15764.08 - 15769.36] make the connection to somebody who is
[15766.80 - 15772.92] suffering and struggling but that was
[15769.36 - 15777.32] that level now that I had to meet up to
[15772.92 - 15779.68] which means I had to now live with that
[15777.32 - 15782.52] that means that all through my days it's
[15779.68 - 15784.84] all I thought about it took over my mind
[15782.52 - 15786.64] my Consciousness and every time I had a
[15784.84 - 15788.84] hard time with it about suffering in
[15786.64 - 15791.40] people suffering as Spirit of compassion
[15788.84 - 15794.88] was telling me this person has brain fog
[15791.40 - 15798.24] and the term brain fog didn't
[15794.88 - 15798.24] exist didn't
[15798.28 - 15803.40] exist this person has neurological Lyme
[15801.04 - 15805.96] disease did not
[15803.40 - 15808.16] exist this person has this this person
[15805.96 - 15810.20] has that it didn't exist hearing these
[15808.16 - 15812.72] words hearing what was wrong with people
[15810.20 - 15815.12] then connecting that to the suffering
[15812.72 - 15817.80] and remembering about that turtle that
[15815.12 - 15819.04] was suffering and making that connection
[15817.80 - 15820.96] probably one of the most difficult
[15819.04 - 15824.00] things in my
[15820.96 - 15825.84] life but I had to get over these humps
[15824.00 - 15829.48] and I had to live with it I would go out
[15825.84 - 15833.28] into the woods when I was younger
[15829.48 - 15837.04] alone I would sit out there and fall
[15833.28 - 15839.64] asleep on the ground next to a little
[15837.04 - 15841.92] campfire some rocks I would have there
[15839.64 - 15845.96] that got really hot with the fire around
[15841.92 - 15849.28] it and I would every time I heard some
[15845.96 - 15850.92] twig snap or break I would say the
[15849.28 - 15855.84] spirit of compassion
[15850.92 - 15855.84] Sasquatch Spirit of as would say no no
[15860.12 - 15863.92] Sasquatch a frog a
[15864.00 - 15870.76] toad but I would be in nature and I had
[15867.00 - 15874.28] to be there to decompress at a young age
[15870.76 - 15876.72] to lift off that pain and suffering in
[15874.28 - 15878.56] the moments because I was taking it on I
[15876.72 - 15881.36] took it on at a young age people's pain
[15878.56 - 15883.76] and suffering and it would fester and I
[15881.36 - 15885.96] had to learn how to cycle it through
[15883.76 - 15889.97] learn how to understand it learn how to
[15885.96 - 15891.72] process it and guess what nobody
[15889.97 - 15894.08] [Music]
[15891.72 - 15897.20] cared nobody
[15894.08 - 15900.04] cared my parents did but nobody in the
[15897.20 - 15901.52] world cared they don't care about the
[15900.04 - 15903.40] chronically ill and I learned that at a
[15901.52 - 15906.04] young age nobody cared about the
[15903.40 - 15909.40] chronically sick oh my God if you've
[15906.04 - 15911.68] been sick for 30 years or 30 years ago
[15909.40 - 15914.40] you know they care now because it's
[15911.68 - 15915.72] clicks and likes and all that [ __ ]
[15914.40 - 15917.60] and then sell whatever you're going to
[15915.72 - 15920.56] sell to the chronically sick because
[15917.60 - 15922.40] boom cha-ching cha-ching the industry
[15920.56 - 15925.56] changed completely
[15922.40 - 15927.96] now but back then nobody even cared
[15925.56 - 15932.56] about anything with the chronic Leo so
[15927.96 - 15936.68] here I was young a child okay I care I
[15932.56 - 15939.24] feel it I understand it nobody
[15936.68 - 15941.76] cares and then I hear this
[15939.24 - 15944.40] voice that's teaching me all these
[15941.76 - 15946.28] different things things about why people
[15944.40 - 15948.76] are sick
[15946.28 - 15950.84] and and then the connection about
[15948.76 - 15953.48] suffering and struggling and then
[15950.84 - 15955.96] realizing just like I heard tonight
[15953.48 - 15959.76] someone's driving now who couldn't drive
[15955.96 - 15964.12] before that simple little thing how
[15959.76 - 15968.40] important that is losing that freedom to
[15964.12 - 15970.48] drive losing the freedom to even talk so
[15968.40 - 15973.44] many people have been
[15970.48 - 15975.24] there and then connect to that
[15973.44 - 15977.96] understanding that my job all these
[15975.24 - 15980.16] years has been you have to know what
[15977.96 - 15981.84] that's like in some way you have to
[15980.16 - 15983.68] understand it it can't be just words
[15981.84 - 15985.60] from Spirit of compassion I have to
[15983.68 - 15987.96] connect with it and that's what drives
[15985.60 - 15990.36] me that's how I get up in the morning
[15987.96 - 15993.92] and that's what drives me every single
[15990.36 - 15996.32] day my life has passed by like this like
[15993.92 - 15998.00] that because the spirit of compassion
[15996.32 - 16000.12] all I've heard is a bunch of scrambled
[15998.00 - 16001.80] eggs going into my ear about every
[16000.12 - 16004.36] illness and every symptom and every
[16001.80 - 16006.88] disease and everything else and it's
[16004.36 - 16007.88] made my life kind of go by like this but
[16006.88 - 16011.52] guess
[16007.88 - 16015.32] what it was worth
[16011.52 - 16018.57] it how many people
[16015.32 - 16018.57] [Applause]
[16019.00 - 16023.96] healed how many people healed how many
[16021.68 - 16025.88] people recovered throughout the years
[16023.96 - 16029.96] the fact that we're in here in Cafe
[16025.88 - 16031.88] Gratitude in La blows my mind all on its
[16029.96 - 16034.16] own I can't even believe it can't
[16031.88 - 16034.16] believe
[16037.68 - 16041.40] it you know I've talked about three
[16039.92 - 16043.12] steps up you guys have heard that from
[16041.40 - 16046.72] me probably broken record there he goes
[16043.12 - 16049.24] three steps up two steps back right what
[16046.72 - 16051.64] does it even mean right you ever think
[16049.24 - 16054.40] about that you guys know what it means
[16051.64 - 16055.84] though right you're moving forward
[16054.40 - 16057.84] you're moving forward then you're kicked
[16055.84 - 16061.32] back a little bit scared
[16057.84 - 16063.48] [ __ ] scared [ __ ] you get kick backed a
[16061.32 - 16065.92] little bit and then but but you're
[16063.48 - 16068.92] further than you were you're further
[16065.92 - 16070.32] than you were with your symptoms how
[16068.92 - 16075.80] powerful is
[16070.32 - 16075.80] that the healing process is exactly
[16075.84 - 16080.52] that
[16077.40 - 16083.44] it's a few steps forward one step back a
[16080.52 - 16085.84] few steps forward two steps back that's
[16083.44 - 16089.12] how it works when you heal even if it
[16085.84 - 16094.12] doesn't feel that way sometimes you are
[16089.12 - 16094.12] still healing you are still healing
[16096.00 - 16100.64] I think one of the problems in the
[16098.12 - 16103.20] Natural Health world right now to this
[16100.64 - 16105.80] day right this second is they still
[16103.20 - 16107.68] don't know why anybody's sick I hear it
[16105.80 - 16110.52] every day out there this person knows
[16107.68 - 16112.68] this this expert knows this this person
[16110.52 - 16114.44] knows this this professional knows this
[16112.68 - 16117.08] but at the same time none of them know
[16114.44 - 16118.72] why anybody was sick what happened when
[16117.08 - 16120.64] you found out why you were sick did
[16118.72 - 16122.20] anybody in here find out why you were
[16120.64 - 16124.80] sick
[16122.20 - 16124.80] ever find out
[16130.08 - 16136.48] why when you find out why you became
[16133.60 - 16138.56] sick it's half the battle I talk about
[16136.48 - 16141.44] that the other half is now just doing
[16138.56 - 16144.52] the right tools and moving forward right
[16141.44 - 16147.00] and and doing that and
[16144.52 - 16149.20] healing the world of chronic illness in
[16147.00 - 16152.56] the world of natural health is
[16149.20 - 16154.64] still still in the Dark Ages
[16152.56 - 16157.60] still in the Dark
[16154.64 - 16159.48] Ages and when you find any kind of
[16157.60 - 16161.48] resistance out there towards medical
[16159.48 - 16163.56] medium information like
[16161.48 - 16166.36] censorship and
[16163.56 - 16168.28] social not a lot of comment here not a
[16166.36 - 16170.68] lot of comment here getting kicked off
[16168.28 - 16172.40] of here whatever it is means you're in
[16170.68 - 16173.18] the right place and you're doing the
[16172.40 - 16176.32] right
[16173.18 - 16176.32] [Music]
[16179.52 - 16185.44] thing because we're Advan ened
[16182.68 - 16189.04] information is what we
[16185.44 - 16190.52] are it's not what people think it's the
[16189.04 - 16192.12] opposite of what's happening out there
[16190.52 - 16195.72] it's the advanced
[16192.12 - 16198.72] information is what it is and that's why
[16195.72 - 16200.48] sometimes it can feel like my God am I
[16198.72 - 16202.84] the only one doing this medical medium
[16200.48 - 16204.88] stuff oh my God why is everybody on my
[16202.84 - 16206.56] ass about it how come people are saying
[16204.88 - 16209.24] why are you eating that way why are you
[16206.56 - 16212.32] doing this why are you doing
[16209.24 - 16215.88] that but it's Advanced it's a ahead of
[16212.32 - 16218.88] its time it still is it's Timeless it's
[16215.88 - 16221.40] in your hands you have it and you know
[16218.88 - 16223.68] what's going to really piss you guys off
[16221.40 - 16226.00] down the
[16223.68 - 16229.12] road you guys are going to be like I was
[16226.00 - 16233.20] doing that already I already
[16229.12 - 16235.68] knew it's going to piss you
[16233.20 - 16237.72] off especially when little tidbits are
[16235.68 - 16241.16] being poached left and
[16237.72 - 16243.92] right you already knew you're already
[16241.16 - 16243.92] doing it
[16245.64 - 16250.76] every
[16247.16 - 16254.32] time you bump into a
[16250.76 - 16260.88] wall and you think Justice isn't there
[16254.32 - 16260.88] or you're not being heard God hears God
[16262.72 - 16269.16] knows how many of you guys have had dogs
[16265.64 - 16269.16] and cats that have passed
[16270.64 - 16275.44] away how many many of you got dogs and
[16273.04 - 16275.44] cats
[16277.08 - 16282.04] now
[16278.96 - 16284.08] someone back there on the red carpet
[16282.04 - 16286.76] talked about that are we going to see
[16284.08 - 16288.28] our dogs are we going to see our cats
[16286.76 - 16290.84] are we going to see our pets when we
[16288.28 - 16293.68] leave here 100 years from now 80 years
[16290.84 - 16295.40] from now whenever it is and yes we are
[16293.68 - 16298.40] they're going to be
[16295.40 - 16301.12] waiting now I can say that not as a
[16298.40 - 16303.76] psychic that's just saying it because
[16301.12 - 16306.12] people want to hear it or
[16303.76 - 16308.48] something Spirit of compassion told me
[16306.12 - 16312.32] that years
[16308.48 - 16315.64] ago that when you leave here your pets
[16312.32 - 16315.64] are there to greet
[16316.96 - 16322.00] you there's so much more than the
[16320.00 - 16324.36] [ __ ] down here on planet stress and
[16322.00 - 16324.36] planet
[16325.24 - 16331.40] Earth when you have this Advanced
[16329.12 - 16332.44] information and you can move forward and
[16331.40 - 16334.32] heal
[16332.44 - 16337.12] and live a good
[16334.32 - 16339.88] life it doesn't matter if someone really
[16337.12 - 16342.40] doesn't understand it yet or if someone
[16339.88 - 16345.04] doesn't respect it yet or if someone
[16342.40 - 16347.60] thinks whatever some medium guy whatever
[16345.04 - 16349.88] it is it doesn't matter there's bigger
[16347.60 - 16352.40] things going on there's angels watching

[16359.84 - 16365.36] in my life and Three Angels
[16362.48 - 16368.72] were by my
[16365.36 - 16372.04] bedside and I know they're by yours
[16368.72 - 16374.12] too I do there's many times I shouldn't
[16372.04 - 16376.60] have even
[16374.12 - 16379.84] survived been through some things in my
[16376.60 - 16382.76] life but I'm here because of
[16379.84 - 16385.12] angels cuz God was looking out because
[16382.76 - 16387.64] the Angels were
[16385.12 - 16389.88] there and I'm still here and I'm
[16387.64 - 16393.76] standing here with you guys it's
[16389.88 - 16393.76] mind-blowing I just want to say that
[16399.44 - 16403.08] I don't say enough about the people who
[16401.36 - 16405.20] look after loved ones that are really
[16403.08 - 16406.60] sick I know there's some good people and
[16405.20 - 16409.08] family members that are looking after
[16406.60 - 16410.48] loved ones care so much they do
[16409.08 - 16411.92] understand they do understand what it's
[16410.48 - 16413.52] like they see the suffering they
[16411.92 - 16415.60] understand it I I do want to acknowledge
[16413.52 - 16417.80] that by the way I know I say all the
[16415.60 - 16418.84] time it's like you don't know or
[16417.80 - 16420.60] understand unless you walked in
[16418.84 - 16423.20] somebody's shoes but there are some
[16420.60 - 16425.80] people and family members that take care
[16423.20 - 16428.28] of their other family members and they
[16425.80 - 16429.96] care and they feel it they feel the pain
[16428.28 - 16432.36] and they do understand I want to
[16429.96 - 16435.20] acknowledge that by the way you
[16432.36 - 16437.12] guys and maybe you know somebody maybe
[16435.20 - 16439.48] you're somebody right now that
[16437.12 - 16439.48] understands
[16441.52 - 16447.52] that I was talking about the other day
[16445.12 - 16449.24] yesterday I think it was and spirit of
[16447.52 - 16451.33] compassion was talking about time and
[16449.24 - 16453.00] how time works
[16451.33 - 16454.64] [Music]
[16453.00 - 16457.04] and how we're up against the restraints
[16454.64 - 16461.16] of time and how we're under the law of
[16457.04 - 16464.36] time and the rule the rule of time and
[16461.16 - 16467.08] we're always faced with that all the
[16464.36 - 16470.24] time there's a couple things I didn't
[16467.08 - 16474.52] talk about though in that
[16470.24 - 16479.60] moment is that any day you lost
[16474.52 - 16482.52] here on this Earth because you lost it
[16479.60 - 16484.92] to having to take care of your yourself
[16482.52 - 16487.40] having to fight for your life having to
[16484.92 - 16490.44] tend to your health or someone else
[16487.40 - 16492.24] every day and every hour you lost comes
[16490.44 - 16497.00] back to
[16492.24 - 16497.00] you an S so told me that years
[16498.48 - 16504.16] ago because the time you lost is noted
[16503.16 - 16507.60] and
[16504.16 - 16510.28] calculated it's added up by the angels
[16507.60 - 16513.84] and by Supernatural
[16510.28 - 16518.28] forces because the time you lost was of
[16513.84 - 16520.24] the holiest time the holiest hours hours
[16518.28 - 16522.52] of your suffering hours of you're
[16520.24 - 16524.88] struggling hours of you taking people
[16522.52 - 16527.80] who are taking care of people who are
[16524.88 - 16530.24] sick hours of feeling like maybe you're
[16527.80 - 16532.40] hopeless and you don't have the right
[16530.24 - 16535.04] healing information no one understands
[16532.40 - 16540.08] you you're not validated hours of all
[16535.04 - 16540.08] those hours are protected by
[16540.64 - 16546.72] God and they're placed aside and they're
[16544.24 - 16549.68] gifted back to you at some point either
[16546.72 - 16552.76] in this lifetime or when you leave this
[16549.68 - 16558.40] lifetime gift it back to you in some way
[16552.76 - 16560.76] shape or form or given to a loved one
[16558.40 - 16563.16] either way that time is not
[16560.76 - 16567.28] lost you bank
[16563.16 - 16573.56] it because struggling in suffering is of
[16567.28 - 16573.56] the noblest it's of the most holy it
[16574.20 - 16581.20] has it is the most
[16577.32 - 16581.20] important part of
[16582.00 - 16588.04] existence it's not a throwaway it's not
[16585.04 - 16590.20] a loss it's a gain and what happens is
[16588.04 - 16592.76] when you're chronically sick and you've
[16590.20 - 16595.56] suffered and struggled you're gaining
[16592.76 - 16597.40] not losing critical to know Spirit of

[16775.68 - 16782.08] is going to be really powerful really
[16779.00 - 16785.00] big it's worth it for me to be laying on
[16782.08 - 16786.96] the bench afterwards for a few minutes
[16785.00 - 16789.12] way worth it wouldn't trade it in for
[16786.96 - 16789.12] the
[16798.28 - 16802.16] world tonight's light blast is going to
[16800.56 - 16805.00] be similar to last night where you can
[16802.16 - 16807.04] split the light if you need to some of
[16805.00 - 16809.56] you probably remember that you can split
[16807.04 - 16812.20] the light send some of the light to
[16809.56 - 16815.24] somebody else
[16812.20 - 16818.92] send some of the light to an

[16825.00 - 16829.40] that's coming down tonight similar to
[16826.88 - 16834.24] the light that came down last night and
[16829.40 - 16837.08] it holds within you for a longer time
[16834.24 - 16840.00] but more than that you'll be able to
[16837.08 - 16842.64] possess it hold on to it and touch
[16840.00 - 16845.32] somebody and some of that light's going
[16842.64 - 16845.32] to enter
[16846.88 - 16852.68] them you touch them on the top of the
[16849.16 - 16857.12] head or on the forehead it's a great

[17219.36 - 17227.28] dream I was walking down a dirt
[17223.32 - 17231.24] road was walking by a house there was a
[17227.28 - 17231.24] woman on the front porch
[17231.92 - 17238.64] playing with a
[17234.68 - 17239.92] dog I walked in front of that front lawn
[17238.64 - 17242.64] in that
[17239.92 - 17246.92] porch and it was a dog that passed away
[17242.64 - 17246.92] in my life decades
[17248.44 - 17253.88] ago
[17250.48 - 17256.24] profound I can't tell you what I felt
[17253.88 - 17258.88] like woke
[17256.24 - 17262.40] up and that was what happened with me
[17258.88 - 17263.68] with the light blast last night
[17262.40 - 17265.96] there's going to be a lot of things

[17329.36 - 17336.96] know that you're very special
[17334.32 - 17340.44] people but you really
[17336.96 - 17343.60] are you have the most compassion out of
[17340.44 - 17346.52] any community in the health world I know
[17343.60 - 17346.52] that sounds a
[17346.60 - 17353.48] little harsh or tough or a stretch but
[17350.36 - 17356.12] it's true true it's true anybody in the
[17353.48 - 17358.04] medical medium communities know they
[17356.12 - 17361.28] know the
[17358.04 - 17362.76] difference and they know the people that
[17361.28 - 17365.32] they're communicating with and the
[17362.76 - 17365.32] people they're
[17367.44 - 17372.60] around always remember that there's
[17370.24 - 17374.48] support out there and there's somebody
[17372.60 - 17378.24] that
[17374.48 - 17378.24] understands always remember
[17378.48 - 17385.52] that back 35 years when I was doing
[17382.72 - 17387.40] consultations back 30 years ago and 25
[17385.52 - 17390.88] years ago when I was doing
[17387.40 - 17395.16] consultations it wasn't like this it
[17390.88 - 17395.16] wasn't this huge massive
[17396.56 - 17401.48] Community I think somebody tonight that
[17398.96 - 17403.76] was on the red carpet said they had a
[17401.48 - 17405.96] consultation with me 12 or 14 years ago
[17403.76 - 17405.96] or
[17406.40 - 17412.64] something I thank them for coming and
[17409.36 - 17412.64] being here
[17412.84 - 17419.44] and she knew that what happened in that
[17416.16 - 17421.80] consultation that talk with
[17419.44 - 17424.36] me really
[17421.80 - 17426.92] helped helped move her
[17424.36 - 17429.60] forward there's a community now we got
[17426.92 - 17429.60] to be proud of
[17435.64 - 17443.76] it remember that when

[17692.52 - 17695.24] something about connecting with the
[17693.52 - 17696.88] medical medium community and that's what
[17695.24 - 17698.96] I think even the last few nights we just
[17696.88 - 17700.72] seeing how strong it is how beautiful
[17698.96 - 17701.96] how uplifting it is for everyone to
[17700.72 - 17704.40] connect and get together it's very
[17701.96 - 17705.88] special yeah absolutely and it's been a
[17704.40 - 17708.20] beautiful Journey like we we started
[17705.88 - 17709.80] medical medium in 2019 so it's been
[17708.20 - 17711.76] almost 6 years we're just reflecting on

[17718.36 - 17721.24] health challenges and we came across

[17909.44 - 17913.12] before doing the medical meeting
[17910.84 - 17915.16] protocol yeah I think for me like I I
[17913.12 - 17916.68] suffered from adrenal fatigue and and
[17915.16 - 17918.88] burnout and it was uh it really
[17916.68 - 17920.84] transformational to have uh the celery
[17918.88 - 17923.24] juice in my life and and what it's done
[17920.84 - 17924.40] for my energy levels and for my healing
[17923.24 - 17926.32] alysa's had some pretty incredible
[17924.40 - 17928.08] healing too of course I'm very grateful
[17926.32 - 17931.04] to have a partner that does medical
[17928.08 - 17933.48] medium with me um I've healed severe
[17931.04 - 17935.24] lupus and my daughter had neonatal lupus
[17933.48 - 17937.52] that we both healed together within a
[17935.24 - 17939.04] year of doing medical medium um and I
[17937.52 - 17940.56] healed it more with just a healing foods
[17939.04 - 17943.52] versus supplements which was a really
[17940.56 - 17945.60] fun thing to watch um and then our son
[17943.52 - 17947.04] um has an eye condition called Dwayne
[17945.60 - 17948.52] and that's healing as well with medical
[17947.04 - 17952.84] medium and his prescription has gone
[17948.52 - 17955.60] from plus 4.5 to plus two that's huge
[17952.84 - 17957.16] yes yes and what about you how what
[17955.60 - 17959.12] benefits have you found from doing the
[17957.16 - 17962.16] medical medium protocol so I found
[17959.12 - 17964.28] medical medium uh in 2021 and I was
[17962.16 - 17967.44] super desperate I had all the kinds of
[17964.28 - 17969.24] neurological problems adrenal fatigue my
[17967.44 - 17971.88] family was tired of me saying I don't
[17969.24 - 17973.60] feel well I don't feel well what's going
[17971.88 - 17975.32] on with my health so I went Doctor
[17973.60 - 17978.52] shopping doctor to doctor trying to
[17975.32 - 17980.84] figure out what was going on um MRI came
[17978.52 - 17982.44] back clean we couldn't fig figure out
[17980.84 - 17985.64] anything and then I went to a naturopath
[17982.44 - 17988.28] who did a viral panel and said okay well
[17985.64 - 17990.72] you have epine bar um and the only thing
[17988.28 - 17993.48] that will heal that is celery juice and
[17990.72 - 17995.08] didn't connect to the medical medium um
[17993.48 - 17997.72] but I had to do my own research and my
[17995.08 - 17999.56] mom had actually read the first book and
[17997.72 - 18001.12] she brought it to me and I put that book
[17999.56 - 18002.96] down on the table that night and I
[18001.12 - 18004.68] cracked it open I said I'm starting
[18002.96 - 18006.36] tomorrow morning and I did and it was
[18004.68 - 18009.60] February 2nd of
[18006.36 - 18012.96] 2021 and um this journey has been
[18009.60 - 18015.00] miraculous ulous truly I mean I started
[18012.96 - 18016.56] just because I wanted to feel better I
[18015.00 - 18020.60] didn't know I was going to have the best
[18016.56 - 18023.96] life ever because of it um so it's truly
[18020.60 - 18026.80] incredible I've met the best friends um
[18023.96 - 18028.84] I love my life I love my family I've my
[18026.80 - 18031.36] whole family has reconnected over this
[18028.84 - 18034.32] and I truly feel like what had started
[18031.36 - 18037.52] as just healing my illness blossomed
[18034.32 - 18039.20] into this fruitful Beautiful Life wow
[18037.52 - 18040.68] that's incredible so your family does
[18039.20 - 18042.60] the protocols
[18040.68 - 18044.08] and it's brought you together a lot yeah
[18042.60 - 18047.44] and I think that it just healed old
[18044.08 - 18049.72] emotional wounds yeah so the soul like
[18047.44 - 18051.00] all of the um emotional healing as well
[18049.72 - 18052.88] like sometimes we think about the
[18051.00 - 18054.60] physical and that's what we what we
[18052.88 - 18056.20] really want to heal right the symptoms
[18054.60 - 18058.36] but then we don't realize that it can be
[18056.20 - 18060.40] connected to to the
[18058.36 - 18061.84] emotional interesting talking to
[18060.40 - 18063.40] everyone over these past few nights a
[18061.84 - 18066.44] lot of people are saying it's very Soul

[18171.36 - 18175.80] because they were about to close at 1:30

[18193.00 - 18197.32] and I didn't feel tired so it was nice
[18195.16 - 18199.60] yeah MH did you enjoy having lunch and
[18197.32 - 18201.16] dinner here yeah definitely you know
[18199.60 - 18204.20] especially when you're are not cooking
[18201.16 - 18206.48] it because cooking food is also takes a
[18204.20 - 18208.60] lot of time and having this going out
[18206.48 - 18210.40] and having a like medical medium healthy
[18208.60 - 18212.88] food it's the best thing I could ever
[18210.40 - 18215.24] dream of yeah yeah incredible and you
[18212.88 - 18217.60] guys are somewhat locals from the OC
[18215.24 - 18219.24] area so you can come back again yeah
[18217.60 - 18221.00] definitely yep definitely I'm pretty
[18219.24 - 18223.76] sure we're going to do it a lot like
[18221.00 - 18226.44] maybe celebrating some like any holidays
[18223.76 - 18230.44] here right that's such a good idea what
[18226.44 - 18233.32] was your favorite dish uh I did like the
[18230.44 - 18237.92] the sushi mhm and since it doesn't have
[18233.32 - 18240.44] any fish any like a meat and it it just
[18237.92 - 18244.04] tastes like sushi so it was with the
[18240.44 - 18246.20] Wasabi and then the side yeah it was
[18244.04 - 18248.60] very nice I liked it very much what was
[18246.20 - 18251.32] your favorite dish yeah I like the sushi
[18248.60 - 18254.60] as well and the second favorite is the
[18251.32 - 18257.12] I'm trustworthy I guess the fajitas was
[18254.60 - 18259.84] yeah and was the guacamole was the best
[18257.12 - 18263.04] oh yeah it's incredible I finally had uh
[18259.84 - 18265.80] the kelp noodles the papaya salad oh my
[18263.04 - 18269.00] gosh it's so good I loved it yeah I'm
[18265.80 - 18271.96] Noble one was also um it had a nice
[18269.00 - 18274.00] potato and it was nice dressing it was
[18271.96 - 18276.08] very delicious yeah yeah do you think
[18274.00 - 18278.60] that Cafe Gratitude having these medical
[18276.08 - 18280.00] medium uh dishes on the menu will help
[18278.60 - 18281.52] people's healing Journey make it a
[18280.00 - 18284.48] little bit easier for them and more
[18281.52 - 18287.36] enjoyable I believe so I wish they had
[18284.48 - 18290.52] more uh options specifically medical
[18287.36 - 18293.12] medium yeah cuz I only saw like a five
[18290.52 - 18295.08] or four and it's still already a good
[18293.12 - 18297.40] start and I feel like in the future
[18295.08 - 18298.76] maybe uh once they will see more people
[18297.40 - 18301.68] are ordering them they're going to add
[18298.76 - 18304.40] more options so definitely I'm excited
[18301.68 - 18306.68] for this yeah yes what about you yeah I
[18304.40 - 18309.12] think having it in the in the menu it's
[18306.68 - 18311.12] already a big thing because a lot of
[18309.12 - 18313.40] people who doesn't know about the
[18311.12 - 18316.20] information they can see and try it and
[18313.40 - 18319.60] maybe find it out like you know and I
[18316.20 - 18322.52] believe that it's going to like the cafe
[18319.60 - 18324.52] gred is the one of the first like places
[18322.52 - 18327.52] have this menu I hope in the future
[18324.52 - 18329.68] maybe the other places going to like do
[18327.52 - 18332.16] the same and I hope the information
[18329.68 - 18333.92] going to be even more spread it around
[18332.16 - 18335.96] you know yeah yeah did you enjoy
[18333.92 - 18338.72] connecting with the community tonight oh
[18335.96 - 18340.40] definitely yeah we we had a wonderful
[18338.72 - 18342.60] party in our table
[18340.40 - 18345.40] so we just enjoyed we shared all our
[18342.60 - 18347.64] experiences how you know how they some

[18353.36 - 18357.96] years so and we already can see it's
[18355.24 - 18360.28] life changing experiences happening it's
[18357.96 - 18361.32] just uh unbelievable yeah yeah would you
[18360.28 - 18362.92] like to share a little bit of your
[18361.32 - 18365.68] healing Journey since using medical
[18362.92 - 18368.04] medium oh yeah so as I said it's been a
[18365.68 - 18371.52] couple of years since we've been U
[18368.04 - 18374.28] primarily focused mm medical medium um
[18371.52 - 18376.76] diets and then uh and thank you thanks
[18374.28 - 18379.88] to my wife actually I discovered mm and
[18376.76 - 18382.64] then she's been very encouraging us to
[18379.88 - 18384.64] stick into it believe in it I initially
[18382.64 - 18386.16] was a little bit skeptical because it
[18384.64 - 18388.04] felt like maybe it's another some kind
[18386.16 - 18389.96] of you know like someone just said and
[18388.04 - 18391.56] then she's just following someone else
[18389.96 - 18393.72] and then I just like okay let me give it
[18391.56 - 18398.48] a try as well and I right away started
[18393.72 - 18401.40] feeling well I have healed um in general
[18398.48 - 18404.40] uh per year I get sick like at least two
[18401.40 - 18407.80] three times I used to get sick so since
[18404.40 - 18411.52] I switched to Medical medium uh type of
[18407.80 - 18413.28] feeding myself I I feel myself great I
[18411.52 - 18415.96] haven't been sick for 2 years and it's
[18413.28 - 18418.28] very incredible cuz I'm 37 years old for
[18415.96 - 18420.20] the last like 30 something years I
[18418.28 - 18422.60] remember I've been always a year at
[18420.20 - 18426.08] least couple of times get flu or some
[18422.60 - 18428.68] kind of coldness and then my wife uh she
[18426.08 - 18430.04] healed so many uh health issues and then
[18428.68 - 18433.96] also my mother
[18430.04 - 18438.08] she had a chronic asthma issues she was
[18433.96 - 18441.12] heavy on medic medicine and then uh now
[18438.08 - 18443.68] she no longer takes any medicine only on
[18441.12 - 18446.32] medical medium and she is already
[18443.68 - 18449.28] getting much better she doesn't have any
[18446.32 - 18451.84] more like a chronic illness more like a
[18449.28 - 18454.08] seasonal little bit but we're working on
[18451.84 - 18455.40] it so it's getting much better wow so
[18454.08 - 18457.52] you introduced the whole family to the
[18455.40 - 18461.56] medical medium information yeah I guess
[18457.52 - 18463.48] so I did so I uh I found medical medium
[18461.56 - 18467.08] information because of my own health
[18463.48 - 18469.56] issues and I think my husband was seeing
[18467.08 - 18472.44] how better I'm getting by using medical
[18469.56 - 18475.56] medium because before whatever I did uh
[18472.44 - 18479.64] whatever doctors I FL p i I couldn't
[18475.56 - 18482.00] help myself anyhow so uh yeah he he
[18479.64 - 18484.48] actually I I'm grateful that he catched
[18482.00 - 18486.32] it right away you know of course he was
[18484.48 - 18489.76] skeptical he was just taking whatever
[18486.32 - 18492.24] food I'm giving to him and I think first
[18489.76 - 18495.04] like um year and a half he was doing
[18492.24 - 18497.48] just the morning detox and my husband
[18495.04 - 18500.36] was uh addicted to caffeine and stuff
[18497.48 - 18503.04] and he had the anges actually and with
[18500.36 - 18506.52] the celery juice like it's actually uh
[18503.04 - 18509.56] helps people to like count down I guess
[18506.52 - 18515.44] like he's getting very understanding and
[18509.56 - 18519.80] calm yeah and um yeah so me um I think I
[18515.44 - 18523.04] get rid of over 30 plus symptoms yeah
[18519.80 - 18525.88] wow yeah in 2022 actually I had some uh
[18523.04 - 18528.72] issues and I went to one of the like
[18525.88 - 18531.16] modern places to get the IV therapies
[18528.72 - 18533.04] and and I was unfortunate that I got
[18531.16 - 18535.24] poisoned with the heavy metals because
[18533.04 - 18537.40] they they injected like five different
[18535.24 - 18539.64] medications at that time and I think it
[18537.40 - 18541.72] didn't work well with me yeah after
[18539.64 - 18544.64] right after the IV therapy I start
[18541.72 - 18547.56] having like very heavy symptoms of
[18544.64 - 18550.04] poisoning with the heavy metals and
[18547.56 - 18553.08] depression and panic attacks was the one
[18550.04 - 18555.32] of them yeah and I remember then when I
[18553.08 - 18558.52] started drinking celeres like on day
[18555.32 - 18560.56] four I felt so much better my anxiety
[18558.52 - 18564.08] start getting better and it was like
[18560.56 - 18567.08] Miracle because it worked for me like
[18564.08 - 18568.28] from the first day so I knew that this
[18567.08 - 18570.68] was the
[18568.28 - 18572.08] information yeah well that's incredible
[18570.68 - 18574.08] and now you're here going out to dinner

[18724.00 - 18728.36] easier and more enjoyable for them oh
[18726.36 - 18730.44] absolutely and it reminds me of
[18728.36 - 18732.20] something that Anthony Williams says
[18730.44 - 18734.80] where you know we only have so many
[18732.20 - 18737.76] meals in this lifetime and I think you
[18734.80 - 18740.00] know in any of those heals if meals if
[18737.76 - 18742.68] we can bring that healing into it it's
[18740.00 - 18744.84] so important every everyone counts and
[18742.68 - 18747.12] so being able to have a place where
[18744.84 - 18749.36] people can go and and enjoy meal with
[18747.12 - 18751.88] their loved ones um at such an
[18749.36 - 18753.80] accessible way uh it's it's a
[18751.88 - 18756.80] GameChanger so how has the medical
[18753.80 - 18758.24] medium information helped you heal yeah
[18756.80 - 18759.96] so um like I mentioned I've been doing
[18758.24 - 18762.20] this for eight years and I came on to
[18759.96 - 18764.64] his information because I had a lot of
[18762.20 - 18767.20] severe mental health issues um you know
[18764.64 - 18769.48] I'd wake up and feel just severely
[18767.20 - 18772.08] depressed and anxious but not really be
[18769.48 - 18773.72] able to pinpoint why I felt that way it
[18772.08 - 18776.56] wasn't like an outside factor or
[18773.72 - 18778.16] anything and and I just um I remember I
[18776.56 - 18780.32] was going through a heartbreak you know
[18778.16 - 18781.52] as we all do breakups girl you know and
[18780.32 - 18784.92] I'm in the bookstore and I'm soul
[18781.52 - 18786.12] searching and I I I actually look on my
[18784.92 - 18789.32] phone and I'm like what are the top
[18786.12 - 18791.64] books right now in this space and I make
[18789.32 - 18793.52] eye contact with the first book with the
[18791.64 - 18795.00] lungs and I'm like that's so interesting
[18793.52 - 18796.56] that it looks like that and I look up
[18795.00 - 18798.56] from my phone and I make direct eye
[18796.56 - 18800.32] contact with the book and so I kind of
[18798.56 - 18802.76] took it as a sign I was like okay let me
[18800.32 - 18804.96] take it and just immediately I resonated
[18802.76 - 18807.72] with it and um with time I've been able
[18804.96 - 18810.72] to incorporate so many of the healing
[18807.72 - 18812.92] protocols um to the point where I really
[18810.72 - 18816.68] feel like I've moved forward in feeling
[18812.92 - 18819.28] more mentally resilient um and just have
[18816.68 - 18822.00] a more positive compassionate out look
[18819.28 - 18823.48] on life and I think if anyone has
[18822.00 - 18826.00] struggled with like a mental health
[18823.48 - 18827.48] issue like that's so invaluable
[18826.00 - 18829.48] especially if it's been your day today
[18827.48 - 18832.32] and and there's so much freedom in that
[18829.48 - 18834.40] and so I I feel like the trajectory of
[18832.32 - 18836.92] my life has changed so I I feel so
[18834.40 - 18838.32] grateful wow that's incredible thank you

[18863.36 - 18869.12] a range of flavors in in a medical
[18867.40 - 18871.36] medium type meal I'm used to things
[18869.12 - 18874.68] being quite a bit more basic and rustic
[18871.36 - 18877.40] in what I cook you know so uh it was
[18874.68 - 18882.36] quite it was quite good um the first few

[18913.76 - 18918.68] the the sushi was was very very clean

[18918.68 - 18925.84] nicely cleanly on the pallet um of the
[18923.84 - 18930.92] I'm not a chef okay so I might be
[18925.84 - 18933.52] completely bungling words on this um uh

[18968.76 - 18971.36] what what was your experience like
[18969.88 - 18974.16] meeting
[18971.36 - 18977.92] aw um
[18974.16 - 18979.76] very I mean very moving very moving
[18977.92 - 18983.36] experience
[18979.76 - 18985.76] um uh let's see I
[18983.36 - 18988.28] asked my wife wanted to give him
[18985.76 - 18992.88] something cuz my wife's kind of a nerd
[18988.28 - 18995.24] and likes to do research and such and um
[18992.88 - 18997.96] wanted him to look at some of the
[18995.24 - 19000.84] research that she did and so she wrote
[18997.96 - 19003.96] something up and I gave and that and I
[19000.84 - 19006.72] thanked him for some of his podcasts
[19003.96 - 19009.12] that he's done actually the telegrams on
[19006.72 - 19013.48] on angels that I found particularly
[19009.12 - 19018.40] meaningful for me uh because for me
[19013.48 - 19020.92] I I I used to pray um like actually
[19018.40 - 19022.88] starting around the age of five until
[19020.92 - 19025.36] around 20 and then I started getting
[19022.88 - 19028.56] kind of confused a little bit about what
[19025.36 - 19030.52] I should be praying to because it seemed
[19028.56 - 19033.40] like there are people from all sorts of
[19030.52 - 19037.64] religions that have deep
[19033.40 - 19040.32] meaningful uh thoughts about what they
[19037.64 - 19043.00] believe and I didn't feel like those
[19040.32 - 19045.68] people were any less or more valid valid
[19043.00 - 19047.80] than the belief system that I was at the
[19045.68 - 19050.84] time following and so I kind of stayed
[19047.80 - 19053.68] on the sidelines for a long time until I
[19050.84 - 19056.96] heard that the couple telegrams he had
[19053.68 - 19059.00] and somehow it that clicked for me on on
[19056.96 - 19060.64] angels and praying to the angels and
[19059.00 - 19064.72] then so I started resuming that again
[19060.64 - 19067.08] and it's been a long long Hiatus when I
[19064.72 - 19070.24] really kind of stopped or felt very
[19067.08 - 19072.64] insecure about it so
[19070.24 - 19075.28] um so yeah those are some of the things
[19072.64 - 19079.40] I mentioned and I think I mentioned to
[19075.28 - 19082.44] him if he had any idea or if SOC said
[19079.40 - 19086.56] anything special and he said he was just
[19082.44 - 19089.00] he was just very I was Floyd he was just
[19086.56 - 19091.56] very very
[19089.00 - 19092.68] nice about communicating what SOC had
[19091.56 - 19096.40] said
[19092.68 - 19100.24] he's um something that I
[19096.40 - 19102.40] was you know a smart guy and you know
[19100.24 - 19104.40] keep doing things I honestly don't
[19102.40 - 19106.04] remember it was a moment you have to
[19104.40 - 19107.84] watch the live stream back and get that
[19106.04 - 19109.76] you know that's right yeah exactly I
[19107.84 - 19111.48] would have to watch it again to know for
[19109.76 - 19113.24] sure cuz I could say now and then I'd
[19111.48 - 19115.48] watch the live stream and say wait he
[19113.24 - 19117.64] said that you know that's actually what
[19115.48 - 19120.16] happened in the M yeah yes exactly it
[19117.64 - 19121.56] can be a bit of a blow yeah yeah and
[19120.16 - 19122.84] what has your medical medium Journey
[19121.56 - 19124.92] been like would you like to share a bit
[19122.84 - 19127.84] of that with the community watching um
[19124.92 - 19131.56] sure I mean my medical medium Journey
[19127.84 - 19133.72] has been mostly just sort of watching my
[19131.56 - 19137.12] wife who's the canary in the coal mine
[19133.72 - 19140.72] for me because whenever Anthony speaks
[19137.12 - 19143.12] of ailments basically she's kind of felt
[19140.72 - 19147.08] them all you know it doesn't matter what
[19143.12 - 19149.28] you know at some point she has felt any
[19147.08 - 19151.88] one of those number of ailments
[19149.28 - 19154.88] and um and I've seen how helpful it's
[19151.88 - 19156.80] been for her because she's done we've
[19154.88 - 19159.48] done so many different other things and
[19156.80 - 19162.12] tried so many different other things so
[19159.48 - 19165.20] um at first that was the main thing and
[19162.12 - 19168.16] then because I saw the benefit to her I
[19165.20 - 19171.28] started doing some of those things like
[19168.16 - 19173.80] the lime water and the celery juice and
[19171.28 - 19177.00] the heavy metal detox smoothie and
[19173.80 - 19179.20] eating eating cleaner and um you know
[19177.00 - 19180.84] and then gradually find tuning in and
[19179.20 - 19184.80] getting more knowledgeable about what to
[19180.84 - 19186.84] do and but finally toward the toward the
[19184.80 - 19189.48] end I I had a full mouth reconstruction
[19186.84 - 19194.36] done by my brother who was a
[19189.48 - 19197.92] dentist is a dentist and um but I kept
[19194.36 - 19199.60] losing caps anyway um cuz he would cap
[19197.92 - 19204.24] my teeth and they kept coming out anyway
[19199.60 - 19208.92] I lost a bunch of them and
[19204.24 - 19211.56] um as as a result you know I I would was
[19208.92 - 19213.88] I saw a few other dentists who said that
[19211.56 - 19215.32] it they didn't see any reason that it
[19213.88 - 19217.32] would stop unless I did something more
[19215.32 - 19219.24] aggressive and so or do something
[19217.32 - 19221.76] different because they were just they
[19219.24 - 19224.80] still kept coming out and so I decided
[19221.76 - 19228.56] to finally adopt some of the protocols
[19224.80 - 19231.12] and that those finally worked so um
[19228.56 - 19233.48] those have been really really helpful um
[19231.12 - 19237.96] I would hardly say I'm out of the woods
[19233.48 - 19239.44] and I you know I'm hopefully not um you
[19237.96 - 19241.52] know going to make make a two steps
[19239.44 - 19243.88] backward move on you know cuz he talks
[19241.52 - 19248.12] about the three steps forward two two
[19243.88 - 19249.52] steps back so um uh that's been really
[19248.12 - 19251.92] helpful that's kind of been the main
[19249.52 - 19253.56] thing oh that's incredible well where's
[19251.92 - 19255.40] your wife this evening is she with you
[19253.56 - 19259.48] here or is she watching from harm or
[19255.40 - 19261.60] she's watching from home she she um has
[19259.48 - 19263.96] a tendency to need to eat very very low
[19261.60 - 19266.08] fat and she was concerned whether the
[19263.96 - 19269.60] dishes would be sufficiently low fat for
[19266.08 - 19271.24] her and so um she decided rather than
[19269.60 - 19273.64] take somebody's spot she would just stay
[19271.24 - 19277.56] home wow can we say hello to her before

[19549.40 - 19556.88] just Joy yeah
[19552.44 - 19559.92] peace well I you know I felt it really
[19556.88 - 19561.92] in my I directed to my brain and I could
[19559.92 - 19564.96] feel it trickling down through my face
[19561.92 - 19569.04] like tingling down through my face and
[19564.96 - 19571.96] so uh and I also shared it with my son
[19569.04 - 19574.56] and his his girlfriend just had surgery
[19571.96 - 19575.92] today and so you know sending them some
[19574.56 - 19579.68] light and hopefully that helps the
[19575.92 - 19582.68] healing process yeah so that's beautiful
[19579.68 - 19586.88] how did you first discover medical
[19582.68 - 19589.28] medium I have always loved health and
[19586.88 - 19593.28] seeking had gone through some things in
[19589.28 - 19595.12] my life and um it just appeared
[19593.28 - 19597.96] angelically I believe you know it's just
[19595.12 - 19600.00] like it's just there and I was intrigued
[19597.96 - 19602.80] and so so I started to look into it
[19600.00 - 19604.80] little by little and then just kind of
[19602.80 - 19607.00] evolved started doing celery juice and
[19604.80 - 19610.84] hmds now we have a routine where every
[19607.00 - 19612.76] morning we get up and we do the the the
[19610.84 - 19614.76] protocol straight on through so it's
[19612.76 - 19618.12] been beautiful yeah what benefits have
[19614.76 - 19621.80] you found the benefits I found were just
[19618.12 - 19625.64] the skin the skin healing and clearing
[19621.80 - 19629.24] up and uh sinuses was the big thing for
[19625.64 - 19631.92] me I had sinus issues bad sinus issues
[19629.24 - 19634.04] and those issues are now gone I can ask
[19631.92 - 19637.20] I remember actually the day that I was
[19634.04 - 19639.84] able to taste food again which was quite
[19637.20 - 19644.04] profound spiritual experience like
[19639.84 - 19647.16] losing taste is just like I didn't like
[19644.04 - 19650.04] that at all yeah it takes a vital part
[19647.16 - 19652.64] of life away from us flavor of life and
[19650.04 - 19657.00] I got that back from the information
[19652.64 - 19658.64] celery juice hmds every morning texures
[19657.00 - 19660.76] every morning
[19658.64 - 19663.48] yeah and then trying to stay fat free
[19660.76 - 19667.24] and that's the big challenge for for us
[19663.48 - 19669.36] moving forward is staying fat free so
[19667.24 - 19670.64] I'm really give it a shot I'm so glad
