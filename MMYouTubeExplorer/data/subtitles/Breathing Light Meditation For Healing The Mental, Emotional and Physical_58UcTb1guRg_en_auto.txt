[0.16 - 4.64] i just released medical medium podcast
[2.72 - 6.56] at apple podcast and also you can listen
[4.64 - 8.80] to it on spotify too
[6.56 - 11.20] so the breathing light meditation it's
[8.80 - 13.28] really powerful and i hope you guys try
[11.20 - 15.28] it when you get a chance
[13.28 - 16.88] and some people have some people have
[15.28 - 19.76] already i've heard i got some comments
[16.88 - 22.72] here some people have tried it i'm blown
[19.76 - 26.00] away i'm so happy about it because
[22.72 - 28.32] light has been a big deal in my life for
[26.00 - 31.28] decades since age four with spirit of
[28.32 - 34.96] compassion communicating with me and so
[31.28 - 36.08] it's very dear to my heart and i wanted
[34.96 - 37.60] to
[36.08 - 40.40] i wanted to give you guys this
[37.60 - 41.84] meditation because i know there's
[40.40 - 43.20] other light workers out there i know
[41.84 - 45.92] there's other light stuff out there i
[43.20 - 48.32] know that but in this meditation though
[45.92 - 50.24] it's a little different because you're
[48.32 - 52.32] learning how to control the light use
[50.24 - 54.68] the light and then pinpoint it and
[52.32 - 57.36] that's the key right there is
[54.68 - 61.12] pinpointing that light
[57.36 - 62.08] and the only way you truly can pinpoint
[61.12 - 64.32] light
[62.08 - 65.92] is if you actually move
[64.32 - 67.44] your nose
[65.92 - 70.72] and your mouth
[67.44 - 72.24] away from your face so you have to check
[70.72 - 73.92] out this meditation i'll talk about a
[72.24 - 75.76] little bit i want to read some comments
[73.92 - 77.20] read some points too
[75.76 - 79.04] i want to answer some questions if we
[77.20 - 80.16] can along the way too if you guys just
[79.04 - 81.44] got here we're live right now i'm
[80.16 - 84.48] talking about the breathing light
[81.44 - 87.84] meditation right for the emotional
[84.48 - 90.16] spiritual physical parts of our lives
[87.84 - 93.04] for the mental emotional physical all of
[90.16 - 96.32] it spiritual part of our lives so
[93.04 - 99.12] i know and when we use the light
[96.32 - 101.52] and we actually take our consciousness
[99.12 - 104.00] and we connect to the light right
[101.52 - 106.48] and we use our consciousness to do so
[104.00 - 109.36] we can then control the light
[106.48 - 113.52] and guide it into areas of the body that
[109.36 - 115.04] you need any assistance or you need aid
[113.52 - 116.88] and that's what i love about this
[115.04 - 119.84] incredible meditation you guys medical

[194.56 - 197.92] experienced thank you so much melissa i
[196.32 - 200.88] want to talk about it a little bit too
[197.92 - 204.08] why this thing is so powerful
[200.88 - 206.64] why this spiritual meditation has so
[204.08 - 207.76] much power to it because
[206.64 - 209.84] in it
[207.76 - 211.44] we do something in there that nobody
[209.84 - 213.12] does and you know i've been doing this
[211.44 - 214.56] for a long time my whole life right you
[213.12 - 216.64] guys know that for decades i've been
[214.56 - 219.28] teaching about spiritual and physical
[216.64 - 220.80] right teaching you what's wrong right
[219.28 - 221.92] so you guys if you know medical medium
[220.80 - 224.40] information you know about all the
[221.92 - 225.68] medical books okay most popular health
[224.40 - 228.16] books in the world right the medical
[225.68 - 230.32] medium series and i've been teaching
[228.16 - 232.40] about what goes wrong inside of us so we
[230.32 - 234.16] can heal so that's what i'm known for
[232.40 - 238.16] but i'm also known
[234.16 - 239.60] for the spiritual aspect too right and
[238.16 - 242.96] and then but
[239.60 - 245.60] what this is this meditation
[242.96 - 247.68] it's a powerful tool that you can
[245.60 - 251.76] control
[247.68 - 253.36] you have control and empowerment here
[251.76 - 255.92] that's the difference
[253.36 - 257.92] i want this to be a surprise it's a very
[255.92 - 258.80] special meditation
[257.92 - 261.36] and
[258.80 - 263.12] it's dear to my heart this meditation
[261.36 - 265.36] i'm getting choked up i'm actually
[263.12 - 268.56] getting choked up you guys
[265.36 - 269.60] i'm getting emotional here
[268.56 - 271.60] because
[269.60 - 273.84] i know that when you have something like
[271.60 - 276.40] this in your hands
[273.84 - 278.16] you can make changes that are
[276.40 - 278.96] unmeasurable
[278.16 - 280.64] like
[278.96 - 282.72] i taught you guys how to heal your
[280.64 - 284.32] bodies right physically how to heal your
[282.72 - 287.28] bodies with all the different tools that
[284.32 - 289.04] i taught you guys to use right
[287.28 - 291.28] and then
[289.04 - 292.72] but this tool
[291.28 - 295.04] right
[292.72 - 297.92] takes it to another level because this
[295.04 - 299.36] is a tool that you have full control
[297.92 - 301.44] over
[299.36 - 303.04] and then anything's possible because
[301.44 - 305.04] you're using the light so anything's
[303.04 - 305.92] possible anything
[305.04 - 307.84] right
[305.92 - 309.60] who am i to say anything's not possible
[307.84 - 312.40] because i've seen
[309.60 - 313.92] what it has done for people in my life
[312.40 - 316.56] throughout my
[313.92 - 318.72] years i wanted you guys to have this in
[316.56 - 320.40] your hand but i needed to be
[318.72 - 323.28] in a space
[320.40 - 325.20] able to do it right now you guys know
[323.28 - 326.72] that i worked on the brainsaver books
[325.20 - 327.60] and i finished the brainsaver books
[326.72 - 329.60] right
[327.60 - 331.28] it took a toll on me
[329.60 - 333.68] and i could not
[331.28 - 336.24] i could not just give you this breathing
[333.68 - 338.56] light meditation just like i'll just
[336.24 - 341.20] throw it out i'll throw it out there and
[338.56 - 344.24] i'll just blab it out and
[341.20 - 347.68] i had to make sure i was connected
[344.24 - 350.32] to soc i had to make sure that i was in
[347.68 - 351.92] that light when i did this meditation
[350.32 - 354.24] and recorded this meditation for you
[351.92 - 356.16] guys and i knew i had to get past the
[354.24 - 358.56] brain book because that was a different
[356.16 - 360.88] place i was in that was about taking
[358.56 - 362.96] tremendous amounts of information from
[360.88 - 364.48] above right
[362.96 - 366.16] ahead of science information that
[364.48 - 368.32] science will then fuse and take or
[366.16 - 370.08] whatever right and i had to make sure
[368.32 - 371.36] that the brain books were done and soon
[370.08 - 373.36] as they're done
[371.36 - 375.36] i had to get i had to get moving into
[373.36 - 377.12] this and i had to make sure you guys had
[375.36 - 378.96] this tool in your hand so this is the
[377.12 - 380.96] meditation if you guys just came on here

[471.44 - 476.08] i'm so glad that you did the meditation
[473.68 - 478.08] it makes me so happy because seriously
[476.08 - 480.88] you won't be disappointed when you try
[478.08 - 483.28] it now every time you do the meditation
[480.88 - 484.96] the breathing light meditation it builds
[483.28 - 487.36] on itself
[484.96 - 489.92] and there's a spot in that meditation
[487.36 - 492.08] where you can choose
[489.92 - 494.96] the place on your body that you feel
[492.08 - 497.68] like was injured that you feel like that
[494.96 - 500.24] maybe something happened in your life
[497.68 - 503.04] and you can choose that moment to direct
[500.24 - 504.84] the light to that spot that you want to
[503.04 - 507.44] direct that light to now in the
[504.84 - 509.20] meditation all right there's different
[507.44 - 511.60] areas i talk about where you direct the
[509.20 - 513.68] light into so you'll know like where you
[511.60 - 514.56] can direct the light into
[513.68 - 516.48] and
[514.56 - 518.56] what you what you can do in this
[516.48 - 520.80] meditation is then right when it comes
[518.56 - 523.60] to the point where i say now choose a
[520.80 - 524.72] spot that you want to bring that light
[523.60 - 526.48] in
[524.72 - 528.48] right you can even think about it before
[526.48 - 531.04] you do the meditation what spot would i
[528.48 - 533.52] like to bring the light in so when you
[531.04 - 537.12] do the meditation you can then drive
[533.52 - 539.28] that light into that place that's very
[537.12 - 541.92] important to you like something that's
[539.28 - 543.52] ailing you something that's
[541.92 - 545.52] something that you feel like you've been
[543.52 - 547.20] harmed or hurt throughout your life any
[545.52 - 548.72] kind of place
[547.20 - 550.64] maybe you had an accident maybe
[548.72 - 551.92] something happened in your life maybe
[550.64 - 554.32] you've been wounded in a different way
[551.92 - 556.64] emotionally physically you can take that
[554.32 - 557.68] light and direct that light into that
[556.64 - 559.84] place
[557.68 - 562.00] inside your body
[559.84 - 564.40] and inside your soul if you need to
[562.00 - 566.08] inside your heart your soul your mind
[564.40 - 567.68] your body all of it so it's really
[566.08 - 570.88] important
[567.68 - 572.56] to know you have that control so
[570.88 - 574.16] i want to read a couple of comments here
[572.56 - 576.80] too is well first of all let's let's
[574.16 - 578.64] just go into this here so what i like
[576.80 - 580.56] about this here's one thing right here
[578.64 - 582.08] discover the power of the light as it
[580.56 - 584.64] moves through your body and destroys
[582.08 - 587.04] disease darkness toxic emotions guilt
[584.64 - 587.76] shame fear doubts and worry now a lot of
[587.04 - 590.64] us
[587.76 - 592.88] we we put boundaries up
[590.64 - 594.96] because we've been hurt so we have to
[592.88 - 596.80] put boundaries up that's how we protect
[594.96 - 598.32] ourselves right but when we put
[596.80 - 600.56] boundaries up
[598.32 - 602.48] because we've been hurt
[600.56 - 606.00] right we also
[602.48 - 607.84] don't know how to heal we can't heal so
[606.00 - 609.28] easily we need the boundaries up
[607.84 - 610.72] sometimes
[609.28 - 612.88] because we need them to protect
[610.72 - 614.72] ourselves but at the same time once that
[612.88 - 616.40] boundary is built
[614.72 - 618.40] and it's there it's there in our
[616.40 - 620.48] consciousness it's there in our memory
[618.40 - 622.72] banks it's there in our brain and mind
[620.48 - 625.44] right and that boundaries there
[622.72 - 627.52] then it's hard to do some healing that
[625.44 - 628.56] needs to be done behind those boundaries
[627.52 - 630.48] and people
[628.56 - 632.00] they don't know how this works a little
[630.48 - 634.16] bit where whoa they're like they got
[632.00 - 636.48] their boundaries up but yet there's a
[634.16 - 638.72] wound down in behind that boundary
[636.48 - 640.72] there's a wound in there and how do we
[638.72 - 641.84] reach that wound and have access to
[640.72 - 643.68] healing it
[641.84 - 646.24] this meditation
[643.68 - 647.68] allows you to take light go through the
[646.24 - 649.44] boundary
[647.68 - 651.36] and into that place that you've been
[649.44 - 653.60] hurt physically emotionally spiritually
[651.36 - 656.72] mentally in that place where you've been
[653.60 - 658.00] hurt and harmed in some way
[656.72 - 659.52] so that you can still keep the
[658.00 - 661.36] boundaries up that you've had to
[659.52 - 663.20] throughout life because you've been hurt
[661.36 - 664.96] throughout your life but at the same
[663.20 - 666.24] time you can bring light through the
[664.96 - 670.08] boundary
[666.24 - 672.24] into a place where you want to heal
[670.08 - 674.40] can bring that light into the heart you
[672.24 - 676.40] can bring that light
[674.40 - 677.84] into the places you want to bring that
[676.40 - 681.12] light into
[677.84 - 682.40] you can bring it into that consciousness
[681.12 - 684.40] right bring that into the
[682.40 - 686.32] subconsciousness which is incredible
[684.40 - 688.32] michelle stinnett says i'm finally able
[686.32 - 690.16] to focus on meditation since healing my
[688.32 - 691.68] physical symptoms with your life-saving
[690.16 - 693.20] healing meditation that's a really good
[691.68 - 694.80] point right there medical media
[693.20 - 697.60] meditations
[694.80 - 699.60] very gentle powerful but gentle it's a
[697.60 - 701.76] different form of meditation than what's
[699.60 - 703.68] out there in the meditation world
[701.76 - 705.28] it's there for the chronically ill and
[703.68 - 706.72] the chronically sick who have a lot of
[705.28 - 709.76] sensitivities
[706.72 - 711.44] and so these meditations are geared for
[709.76 - 712.72] someone who's been through a lot
[711.44 - 714.64] physically
[712.72 - 716.88] with symptoms and conditions they've
[714.64 - 718.88] been through so much
[716.88 - 721.12] right so that's the kind of meditations
[718.88 - 722.88] these are it's like the moon meditation
[721.12 - 724.80] is powerful in all the medical medium
[722.88 - 726.08] meditations the fruit picking meditation
[724.80 - 728.72] right you guys know that when the
[726.08 - 731.44] stargazing meditation but this breathing
[728.72 - 734.72] like meditation is very special i wanted
[731.44 - 737.68] this here for you guys as a tool so you
[734.72 - 739.76] can learn how to use the light for your
[737.68 - 741.04] healing process
[739.76 - 742.48] right
[741.04 - 744.40] jorah says can this help with
[742.48 - 747.36] self-sabotage behavior
[744.40 - 750.56] absolutely because what happens is that
[747.36 - 753.52] when we get light into places
[750.56 - 755.84] right that have some kind of injury that
[753.52 - 757.04] we don't have our finger on that we
[755.84 - 759.44] don't know
[757.04 - 760.64] we don't know where that injury is we
[759.44 - 762.48] just don't know you know the
[760.64 - 764.64] consciousness and the subconsciousness
[762.48 - 766.96] right and what's inside our brain we
[764.64 - 769.20] don't know where our injuries are
[766.96 - 770.00] when they're emotional and spiritual
[769.20 - 772.08] right
[770.00 - 774.32] and mental so we don't know where those
[772.08 - 777.36] injuries are we need light to go in
[774.32 - 780.08] there and ha ha do the work for us help
[777.36 - 782.32] us do the work for us so we can do that
[780.08 - 784.56] healing and that's what's incredible
[782.32 - 787.12] about this meditation
[784.56 - 789.28] now what's amazing about this meditation
[787.12 - 791.04] is you'll feel it
[789.28 - 792.72] as time goes on after you've done the
[791.04 - 794.56] meditation so once you do it the
[792.72 - 796.96] breathing light meditation
[794.56 - 800.08] you then can
[796.96 - 802.00] feel the results as you go along you'll
[800.08 - 804.56] start being like whoa
[802.00 - 807.20] wait a minute that's starting to feel
[804.56 - 808.88] like i feel lighter now and emily
[807.20 - 811.20] marshall said i did the meditation and
[808.88 - 812.80] it was amazing i need to keep practicing
[811.20 - 814.08] the visualization so here's what's
[812.80 - 816.08] incredible about the breathing light
[814.08 - 818.24] meditation you'll notice it has the word
[816.08 - 820.96] breathing in front of it right
[818.24 - 822.80] now but yet it's not a breathing
[820.96 - 824.80] meditation
[822.80 - 826.64] where it's just all breathing
[824.80 - 827.60] that's not it
[826.64 - 830.00] this is
[827.60 - 832.56] very powerful very gentle
[830.00 - 834.40] this is about the light so when you do
[832.56 - 836.48] this breathing like meditation you'll
[834.40 - 837.36] notice in the title breathing
[836.48 - 839.60] light
[837.36 - 841.76] meditation
[839.60 - 844.16] there's a big difference right there
[841.76 - 847.04] dr fon md hey aw can you direct the
[844.16 - 848.88] light into a loved one yes you can you
[847.04 - 850.88] can right in that meditation where it
[848.88 - 852.00] says where would you like the light to
[850.88 - 853.52] go
[852.00 - 856.56] you choose
[853.52 - 858.80] an option to where you want to drive
[856.56 - 860.80] that light
[858.80 - 863.12] inside that meditation right when you're
[860.80 - 865.44] doing the meditation if it's a loved one
[863.12 - 867.60] that's where you send that light so when
[865.44 - 869.68] you're doing the visual visualization
[867.60 - 871.36] when you're in that meditation and your
[869.68 - 873.20] consciousness is all connected to the
[871.36 - 876.40] light and you're in there
[873.20 - 879.36] then you can say i want to direct this
[876.40 - 881.84] light to a loved one
[879.36 - 885.44] and that's where you send it and imagine
[881.84 - 886.72] and visualize and see and connect to
[885.44 - 888.08] that loved one when you're in the
[886.72 - 890.40] meditation
[888.08 - 892.56] and then have the light drive into now
[890.40 - 894.40] the difference with this meditation
[892.56 - 895.60] is something that's spirit of compassion
[894.40 - 898.48] taught me
[895.60 - 901.68] like more than 30 years ago okay when i
[898.48 - 903.28] was young when i was a child and it's
[901.68 - 905.12] taking your nose
[903.28 - 907.60] taking your mouth
[905.12 - 910.00] and actually moving it
[907.60 - 911.04] moving it to a different place on the
[910.00 - 912.80] body
[911.04 - 914.96] to a place you want that light to be
[912.80 - 917.04] pinpointed divine light says can we
[914.96 - 918.64] choose the whole body instead of just
[917.04 - 922.40] one spot
[918.64 - 924.00] you can on that one time right and one
[922.40 - 925.76] powerful time because you're building up
[924.00 - 927.60] in that meditation and when that one
[925.76 - 929.20] powerful time comes
[927.60 - 932.80] and
[929.20 - 934.88] where do you want that light to go
[932.80 - 936.56] if you want it your whole body then
[934.88 - 938.64] that's where the light goes your whole
[936.56 - 940.48] body in that place
[938.64 - 943.28] and that's where you can do it
[940.48 - 945.36] which is just amazing stephanie chu says
[943.28 - 947.36] hi anthony i did the meditation last
[945.36 - 948.96] night pain in my gallbladder was not
[947.36 - 952.24] there when i woke up
[948.96 - 954.56] i focused on that area extra that's the
[952.24 - 957.12] whole point that's what you can do with
[954.56 - 959.60] this incredible tool i had the pain for
[957.12 - 961.04] three days straight and now it's gone
[959.60 - 963.36] thank you so much i am working on
[961.04 - 964.80] healing every day even when i fail
[963.36 - 966.96] sometimes
[964.80 - 967.68] there's no failing there's no feeling at
[966.96 - 969.76] all
[967.68 - 972.32] right which is the learning experience
[969.76 - 975.28] as we heal and we grow and we do the
[972.32 - 978.40] things we need to do and then sometimes
[975.28 - 980.40] everybody doesn't have it easy and
[978.40 - 982.32] it's not our fault if we get kicked back
[980.40 - 983.84] a little bit or we try or we go back to
[982.32 - 985.28] some kind of an old habit or whatever it
[983.84 - 986.40] is so you never fail you're always
[985.28 - 988.16] moving forward
[986.40 - 990.16] each time you try something new and you
[988.16 - 992.24] you know put forward your head

[1046.08 - 1050.16] me and the healing light
[1047.92 - 1052.56] that happens within this breathing light
[1050.16 - 1055.28] meditation is profound you're
[1052.56 - 1057.28] controlling it you're a part of it and
[1055.28 - 1058.96] they don't want you missing out if you
[1057.28 - 1060.72] get a chance i know you guys are busy
[1058.96 - 1063.12] you've got a lot going on but if you get
[1060.72 - 1065.28] a chance right
[1063.12 - 1066.88] it would be incredible
[1065.28 - 1068.96] and you get a chance and you try the
[1066.88 - 1071.68] meditation
[1068.96 - 1073.60] joanne says how often can you do these
[1071.68 - 1075.12] meditations you could do them every day
[1073.60 - 1077.36] you could do them twice a day you could
[1075.12 - 1078.40] do them every day you can do them every
[1077.36 - 1079.76] other day
[1078.40 - 1081.52] right
[1079.76 - 1084.08] so medical medium podcast at apple
[1081.52 - 1085.76] podcast or or spotify if you want to go
[1084.08 - 1088.24] you know those are two two platforms
[1085.76 - 1089.12] right there breathing light meditation
[1088.24 - 1090.40] okay
[1089.12 - 1092.72] and so
[1090.40 - 1094.88] look i explained in this meditation how
[1092.72 - 1097.92] limitations taught by others block
[1094.88 - 1100.16] profound information from entering our
[1097.92 - 1103.04] being now so here's what happens
[1100.16 - 1105.44] we can have boundaries bestowed upon us
[1103.04 - 1107.52] from others and not even realize it
[1105.44 - 1109.52] because we've been conditioned so what
[1107.52 - 1111.28] happens is we go through life and we end
[1109.52 - 1112.96] up getting conditioned we can have
[1111.28 - 1114.80] boundaries bestowed upon us by
[1112.96 - 1117.20] institutions we can have boundaries
[1114.80 - 1119.36] bestowed upon us by organizations we can
[1117.20 - 1121.52] have boundaries bestowed upon us
[1119.36 - 1123.36] blocking our ability to heal
[1121.52 - 1124.72] right heal emotionally
[1123.36 - 1126.56] by others
[1124.72 - 1129.04] and these boundaries can be set up not
[1126.56 - 1132.32] even by yourself or who you are these
[1129.04 - 1134.96] boundaries can be set up by others
[1132.32 - 1137.04] and so and institutions and other
[1134.96 - 1138.80] organizations can literally set these
[1137.04 - 1140.16] boundaries for you so then you're
[1138.80 - 1142.64] blocked
[1140.16 - 1144.64] you end up getting blocked and it
[1142.64 - 1147.12] interferes with your decision making so
[1144.64 - 1149.04] when you want to make the right decision
[1147.12 - 1152.00] there's this boundary blockage that
[1149.04 - 1153.84] stops you from making the right decision
[1152.00 - 1155.60] it's really painful it can happen to a
[1153.84 - 1157.76] lot of people so
[1155.60 - 1160.00] this meditation is there to just be like
[1157.76 - 1161.84] you know what you know what
[1160.00 - 1162.84] no organization
[1161.84 - 1164.40] no
[1162.84 - 1166.64] institution
[1164.40 - 1168.08] nobody of some type of institution
[1166.64 - 1170.56] organization
[1168.08 - 1172.32] right no something else and what their
[1170.56 - 1174.48] belief system is
[1172.32 - 1176.08] that created a boundary whatever it is
[1174.48 - 1178.00] these boundaries that could be in me
[1176.08 - 1180.08] that were created by so much that we're
[1178.00 - 1181.56] brainwashed about here
[1180.08 - 1183.84] this is like the on
[1181.56 - 1186.16] brainwashing meditation the breathing
[1183.84 - 1187.92] light meditation because what it does is
[1186.16 - 1190.96] it puts everything aside
[1187.92 - 1194.24] everything aside that we've been
[1190.96 - 1197.36] messed with or entrapped with in this
[1194.24 - 1198.72] lifetime because of so much darkness and
[1197.36 - 1201.04] so much evil that's happening in the
[1198.72 - 1202.96] world right we don't know it but we get
[1201.04 - 1205.12] thrown into that spider web this
[1202.96 - 1209.04] meditation is about moving all of that
[1205.12 - 1211.44] away you become this free spirit
[1209.04 - 1214.16] and then you're using the light to
[1211.44 - 1216.56] pinpoint and direct in places of the
[1214.16 - 1218.56] body that you want like you can do that
[1216.56 - 1221.36] and put it in a place that counts that
[1218.56 - 1223.20] you feel that's where i want that light
[1221.36 - 1224.64] and so the goal of the meditation of
[1223.20 - 1226.16] what happens the reason why it's so
[1224.64 - 1227.84] profound is because once you're in that
[1226.16 - 1230.08] meditation you're now connecting to the
[1227.84 - 1232.56] light
[1230.08 - 1235.12] and if you if you want this is important
[1232.56 - 1238.08] too okay whatever you like whatever you
[1235.12 - 1240.72] like about the light meaning if it's
[1238.08 - 1242.80] god's light then that's what you connect
[1240.72 - 1243.76] to if you believe i just talked to
[1242.80 - 1246.00] someone the other day like well i
[1243.76 - 1247.68] believe in a creator i don't i don't use
[1246.00 - 1249.36] the term god i just believe there's a
[1247.68 - 1251.68] creature okay well that's the light you
[1249.36 - 1253.36] use i talked to another person and
[1251.68 - 1255.36] they're like well i believe in the
[1253.36 - 1257.20] universe you know universal light this
[1255.36 - 1259.20] is the light from the okay well then the
[1257.20 - 1261.12] universal light that's what you use
[1259.20 - 1262.80] inside this meditation then it's the
[1261.12 - 1264.48] universal way
[1262.80 - 1265.76] you know another person i believe it's
[1264.48 - 1268.08] the light of jesus christ well then
[1265.76 - 1271.20] that's that's what you actually channel
[1268.08 - 1272.24] you make sure it's that light
[1271.20 - 1274.16] so
[1272.24 - 1276.16] you know so what you can do with the
[1274.16 - 1277.04] power of this light is you can just make
[1276.16 - 1279.44] sure
[1277.04 - 1281.92] you use this light in the way that works
[1279.44 - 1283.20] for you but it's there it's at your
[1281.92 - 1286.80] fingertips
[1283.20 - 1288.64] it's in this meditation it's this is a
[1286.80 - 1291.20] way look we all have access to light but
[1288.64 - 1294.00] this is a great tool to really connect
[1291.20 - 1294.96] with it because we get so busy we get so
[1294.00 - 1296.96] stuck
[1294.96 - 1299.44] we get so stagnant
[1296.96 - 1302.08] we get trapped in so many things and so
[1299.44 - 1303.68] this is a way to move all that aside and
[1302.08 - 1306.56] bring that light in
[1303.68 - 1309.36] joanna gristo says can you direct this
[1306.56 - 1311.76] to a pet absolutely a hundred percent
[1309.36 - 1313.92] you can direct that light to a pet when
[1311.76 - 1315.68] you do this incredible meditation this
[1313.92 - 1318.00] is the breathing light meditation link
[1315.68 - 1320.64] is in the description link is in the bio
[1318.00 - 1322.72] over there and to talk to you guys
[1320.64 - 1324.88] rachel says do you just visualize moving
[1322.72 - 1327.12] your nose and mouth to a point on your
[1324.88 - 1329.12] body yes we're moving her nose and her
[1327.12 - 1331.20] mouth both
[1329.12 - 1332.80] we're taking him
[1331.20 - 1334.16] and we're moving them
[1332.80 - 1336.24] so here's what we're doing we're taking
[1334.16 - 1337.84] our nose and mouth right and we're
[1336.24 - 1340.96] moving them
[1337.84 - 1342.56] removing them all of a sudden here
[1340.96 - 1344.32] so now when you're doing that breathing
[1342.56 - 1346.24] light meditation
[1344.32 - 1349.76] you're actually breathing here because
[1346.24 - 1350.72] your nose and your mouth are now here
[1349.76 - 1352.88] and then
[1350.72 - 1354.48] we're taking our nose and our mouth
[1352.88 - 1356.32] we're removing it from here we're

[1471.28 - 1477.52] process now all medical medium
[1473.36 - 1477.52] information is about course correcting
[1477.92 - 1483.04] if you're sick it's about
[1480.64 - 1484.96] finding the cause and healing right
[1483.04 - 1487.36] knocking down pathogens taking out
[1484.96 - 1489.52] metals getting out chemicals

[1495.36 - 1500.08] correcting with the light with the light
[1498.00 - 1501.60] the power of the light and that's the
[1500.08 - 1502.96] course correcting right there so i
[1501.60 - 1504.96] wanted to kind of talk about that a
[1502.96 - 1507.76] little bit
[1504.96 - 1510.24] feel how the light changes you and feel
[1507.76 - 1513.36] how it lingers and stays with you
[1510.24 - 1517.12] purifies and clears you like you can
[1513.36 - 1519.44] feel that after the meditation
[1517.12 - 1521.28] this is a meditation that you just don't
[1519.44 - 1522.96] do once
[1521.28 - 1524.48] make sure this becomes a part of your
[1522.96 - 1526.16] life because it's a part of my life you
[1524.48 - 1528.64] think i did it once you know what's
[1526.16 - 1531.52] funny is when i was taught this
[1528.64 - 1533.68] meditation when i was a kid by soc
[1531.52 - 1534.80] and i did the meditation
[1533.68 - 1537.84] right
[1534.80 - 1538.80] that soc taught me i didn't say okay did
[1537.84 - 1540.40] it
[1538.80 - 1542.88] did it
[1540.40 - 1544.80] i did it once i'm never going to do it
[1542.88 - 1546.00] again
[1544.80 - 1548.32] right
[1546.00 - 1549.36] maybe i'll i'll teach somebody how to do
[1548.32 - 1550.80] it
[1549.36 - 1552.88] but i'm not going to do it i've been
[1550.80 - 1554.24] doing it my whole life
[1552.88 - 1556.16] it's the kind of thing where i brought
[1554.24 - 1557.52] it into my life i've been doing it my
[1556.16 - 1558.96] entire life
[1557.52 - 1561.44] it's not the kind of meditation where
[1558.96 - 1564.56] you do once you get bored you don't use
[1561.44 - 1565.28] it this is a profound meditation
[1564.56 - 1568.16] and
[1565.28 - 1569.84] it's there for you along the way now the
[1568.16 - 1572.32] thing is here's something to know about
[1569.84 - 1573.84] the medical media meditations
[1572.32 - 1574.88] i just have to be clear about this
[1573.84 - 1576.40] because i know there's a lot of new
[1574.88 - 1577.76] people and they just don't know and i
[1576.40 - 1580.24] understand
[1577.76 - 1581.84] it's not man-made
[1580.24 - 1583.44] this meditation
[1581.84 - 1584.40] the breathing light meditation is not
[1583.44 - 1586.24] man-made
[1584.40 - 1587.84] so it's not like someone like kind of
[1586.24 - 1589.68] knew about another meditation that was
[1587.84 - 1591.52] made by another man by another
[1589.68 - 1593.44] meditation made by another man another
[1591.52 - 1595.20] meditation made by another man and then
[1593.44 - 1597.76] well i'll add a little thing to it too
[1595.20 - 1600.00] because i'm i'm a guy in the spiritual
[1597.76 - 1602.56] movement let me just create a meditation
[1600.00 - 1604.32] here look let me man-made it
[1602.56 - 1606.56] let me man make it
[1604.32 - 1608.40] it's not man-made
[1606.56 - 1611.12] and that's why
[1608.40 - 1614.08] the meditations do what they do
[1611.12 - 1615.28] because they're not actually made by a
[1614.08 - 1617.44] guy
[1615.28 - 1619.28] who decided to start
[1617.44 - 1621.60] you know getting into the spiritual
[1619.28 - 1623.52] movement at a certain time in his life
[1621.60 - 1627.20] went to some retreats
[1623.52 - 1629.36] and decided to make a meditation so
[1627.20 - 1630.40] a whole bunch of women can try
[1629.36 - 1633.20] because
[1630.40 - 1636.16] women make meditations too but really it
[1633.20 - 1638.32] started out with guys making meditations
[1636.16 - 1639.84] this is not a guy's meditation it's not
[1638.32 - 1642.08] a woman's meditation either it's not a
[1639.84 - 1643.60] man's meditation it's not a woman's made
[1642.08 - 1644.72] meditation
[1643.60 - 1646.48] so
[1644.72 - 1648.72] and this is important to know
[1646.48 - 1650.72] it's from above so this meditation is
[1648.72 - 1652.88] made from above
[1650.72 - 1655.60] so it comes from above
[1652.88 - 1657.68] and so that's the difference with this
[1655.60 - 1660.00] there's nothing wrong when a guy makes a
[1657.68 - 1661.28] meditation
[1660.00 - 1662.80] there's nothing wrong with it at all i
[1661.28 - 1664.40] got a friend who makes meditations he's
[1662.80 - 1666.24] like check out this
[1664.40 - 1668.00] it's like aw
[1666.24 - 1669.36] i got a meditation that'll that'll
[1668.00 - 1671.20] totally you know
[1669.36 - 1672.56] totally put yours to shame check this
[1671.20 - 1674.08] out i'm like all right what do you got
[1672.56 - 1675.60] he's like what you do is you sit there
[1674.08 - 1677.36] you got your legs crossed you got your
[1675.60 - 1678.96] hands like this
[1677.36 - 1681.28] and here's what you're doing you're
[1678.96 - 1683.92] you're trying to knock out all the all
[1681.28 - 1685.92] the voices in your head you're trying to
[1683.92 - 1687.36] knock out all the noise in your head
[1685.92 - 1689.36] you're getting rid of all the noise in
[1687.36 - 1691.20] your mind you're clearing your mind
[1689.36 - 1693.12] you're breathing in and then you know
[1691.20 - 1695.12] you see the sun and you clear your mind
[1693.12 - 1697.60] and i'm like okay been done a billion
[1695.12 - 1699.44] times made by men
[1697.60 - 1701.20] okay that's fine
[1699.44 - 1703.44] there's nothing wrong with it i support
[1701.20 - 1705.36] it i was like i was like dude do that
[1703.44 - 1706.24] meditation for sure when you get a
[1705.36 - 1707.92] chance
[1706.24 - 1709.76] try this meditation that wasn't created
[1707.92 - 1710.96] by a guy
[1709.76 - 1713.76] so
[1710.96 - 1715.84] it's really a special tool is what i'm
[1713.76 - 1718.24] saying and that's what i want you guys
[1715.84 - 1719.52] to know and have in your hands it's
[1718.24 - 1721.20] important to me
[1719.52 - 1723.28] because
[1721.20 - 1725.84] it this is got a
[1723.28 - 1727.76] personal connection to me it really does
[1725.84 - 1728.88] and these meditations aren't just thrown
[1727.76 - 1730.72] out there
[1728.88 - 1732.64] like lightly you know like meditation
[1730.72 - 1734.08] apps and stuff like that meditation
[1732.64 - 1736.24] podcast what happens is they're just
[1734.08 - 1738.88] literally they're there so people can
[1736.24 - 1740.00] get into them but the personal
[1738.88 - 1743.44] connection
[1740.00 - 1746.88] and it comes from above that's
[1743.44 - 1748.88] what helps me with the meditation
[1746.88 - 1750.00] it's not sterile
[1748.88 - 1751.84] so
[1750.00 - 1753.20] the thing is is what you'll learn and
[1751.84 - 1755.68] what you'll know when you do this
[1753.20 - 1757.84] meditation it's not sterile
[1755.68 - 1759.84] it's not sterile
[1757.84 - 1760.80] this meditation
[1759.84 - 1763.04] right
[1760.80 - 1765.52] it becomes a part of you
[1763.04 - 1768.08] because guess what
[1765.52 - 1770.16] you're the person who's in control and
[1768.08 - 1772.08] empowered you're the person that's
[1770.16 - 1775.20] gaining that control over the light and
[1772.08 - 1776.72] using it to place into a part of your
[1775.20 - 1778.32] body or your soul
[1776.72 - 1782.56] or wherever
[1778.32 - 1784.00] you feel you want to bring that light in
[1782.56 - 1786.72] and
[1784.00 - 1788.08] yeah be prepared to feel some changes
[1786.72 - 1790.00] christina
[1788.08 - 1791.76] do we move our nose and mouth to the
[1790.00 - 1793.52] other person when we want to direct it
[1791.76 - 1796.16] to them yes you do you have to you do
[1793.52 - 1798.16] that or how do we direct it you have to
[1796.16 - 1799.52] take your nose and mouth
[1798.16 - 1801.52] and your nose and mouth is going to go
[1799.52 - 1802.80] on to that other person
[1801.52 - 1805.28] so you're going to place your nose and
[1802.80 - 1807.52] mouth onto the other person
[1805.28 - 1809.52] wherever you want
[1807.52 - 1811.68] wherever you want wherever you want that
[1809.52 - 1815.12] light to enter into the other person do
[1811.68 - 1817.12] you want it to enter into their heart
[1815.12 - 1819.36] do you want that light to enter into
[1817.12 - 1822.16] their brain their heart to their third
[1819.36 - 1824.56] eye do you want it to enter
[1822.16 - 1827.04] right into their abdomen
[1824.56 - 1829.28] into their leg do where do you want that
[1827.04 - 1831.04] light to enter into their body you want
[1829.28 - 1832.48] it to hit their whole body so you put
[1831.04 - 1833.84] your mouth and nose on your body and you
[1832.48 - 1835.76] want to hit the whole body if you want
[1833.84 - 1838.00] but having the nose amount that's where
[1835.76 - 1839.28] it has to go in though
[1838.00 - 1841.44] um
[1839.28 - 1843.92] alexandra sophia good to see you aw will

[1843.92 - 1847.44] that's what it's for
[1845.84 - 1851.76] loss

[1851.76 - 1856.16] right
[1852.80 - 1857.84] betrayal that's a big one

[1867.44 - 1870.56] really does
[1869.12 - 1872.24] so what i was saying before allow
[1870.56 - 1874.00] yourself to break boundaries in
[1872.24 - 1876.72] unproductive belief systems because what
[1874.00 - 1879.84] happens is we fall into all these belief
[1876.72 - 1881.76] systems that end up controlling us
[1879.84 - 1883.52] because there's money tons of money
[1881.76 - 1885.20] behind those belief systems out there
[1883.52 - 1887.04] and they end up just controlling us and
[1885.20 - 1890.00] brainwashing us and this is about
[1887.04 - 1892.16] clearing that which is incredible
[1890.00 - 1893.68] right
[1892.16 - 1895.60] and
