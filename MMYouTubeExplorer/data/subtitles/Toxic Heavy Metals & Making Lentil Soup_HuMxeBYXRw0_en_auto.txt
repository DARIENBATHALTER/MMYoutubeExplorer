[1097.68 - 1101.84] disturbing when you see things in the
[1099.08 - 1103.96] mainstream Alzheimer's scientists have
[1101.84 - 1105.76] now studied what causes Alzheimer's you
[1103.96 - 1107.08] mean like what you did last for the last
[1105.76 - 1108.40] 30 years what you thought it was
[1107.08 - 1110.80] proteins in the brain and some other
[1108.40 - 1113.72] stuff right right and now they're like
[1110.80 - 1115.80] you know they're like Alzheimer's um you
[1113.72 - 1118.16] know there is hope for people with
[1115.80 - 1121.88] Alzheimer's it's like yeah how because
[1118.16 - 1124.40] the heavy metal detox is what reverses
[1121.88 - 1127.04] Alzheimer's and has it's what helps
[1124.40 - 1129.44] reverse and Stave off and shut it down
[1127.04 - 1131.12] and stop it if someone's really bad with
[1129.44 - 1133.08] their Alzheimer's it has the ability to
[1131.12 - 1135.36] shut that down at least to stop getting
[1133.08 - 1137.76] it worse and even backtrack it a little
[1135.36 - 1139.32] bit if somebody has you know a moderate
[1137.76 - 1141.44] version of Alzheimer's has the ability
[1139.32 - 1143.40] to shut that down and backtrack it
[1141.44 - 1145.32] somebody has a moderate version of
[1143.40 - 1147.24] dementia has the ability to backtrack it
[1145.32 - 1149.36] and shut that down if the brain is
[1147.24 - 1151.64] damaged too much by metals and dementia
[1149.36 - 1152.92] is off the chart so bad someone doesn't

[2043.20 - 2047.36] into the lining of the intestinal tract
[2045.60 - 2050.48] they burrow themselves in there and in
[2047.36 - 2051.88] the liver and it's so important to
[2050.48 - 2053.96] actually have the heavy metal detox to
[2051.88 - 2056.00] pull that out so intestinal tracts get
[2053.96 - 2057.76] healthier Denise thank you so much for

[2062.16 - 2068.60] them to save me from the Alzheimer's
[2065.60 - 2071.32] disease not one doctor had ever been
[2068.60 - 2074.60] able to help me I was literally on my
[2071.32 - 2077.28] knees begging them Denise I'm so happy
[2074.60 - 2079.84] over there on Facebook that you have
[2077.28 - 2080.92] found this information found the heavy
[2079.84 - 2084.08] metal
[2080.92 - 2085.76] detox heavy metals get into the brain
[2084.08 - 2090.56] and they
[2085.76 - 2094.16] rust let's see grab that and they rust
[2090.56 - 2098.32] okay heavy metals get into the brain and
[2094.16 - 2101.80] they rust that's how it works
[2098.32 - 2105.72] they outp poet they out gas they
[2101.80 - 2107.48] explode okay uh Megan Miller quit weed
[2105.72 - 2109.56] and chocolate and finally moving the
[2107.48 - 2112.40] needle been doing medical meeting for
[2109.56 - 2114.00] years thank you Anthony and S so that's
[2112.40 - 2115.68] incredible I'm so proud of you by the
[2114.00 - 2119.08] way I really
[2115.68 - 2121.80] am what happens is Metals get in here
[2119.08 - 2124.32] and when they get in here okay they
[2121.80 - 2126.60] saturate adjacent tissue that's tissue
[2124.32 - 2128.12] next to the metals Metals burrow when
[2126.60 - 2129.48] they find their home in the midline
[2128.12 - 2131.76] canal and other areas the left
[2129.48 - 2133.76] hemisphere the right hemisphere frontal
[2131.76 - 2136.04] lobe when metals get buried in there
[2133.76 - 2141.48] around the pituitary and so forth what
[2136.04 - 2145.44] happens is they outgas they rust they
[2141.48 - 2147.52] disintegrate they out poock it okay and
[2145.44 - 2148.96] oxidize and when those Metals oxidize
[2147.52 - 2151.68] I'll tell you right now what goes wrong
[2148.96 - 2153.52] as the metals oxidize they travel and
[2151.68 - 2155.12] they travel to other tissue and as they
[2153.52 - 2157.68] travel to other tissue you forget who
[2155.12 - 2159.60] you are as they travel to other tisue
[2157.68 - 2162.32] tissue you get anxiety and depression
[2159.60 - 2165.00] and bipolar and OCD as they travel to
[2162.32 - 2167.24] other tissue you start getting you know
[2165.00 - 2169.04] a possible diagnosis of Alzheimer's
[2167.24 - 2171.12] dementia and so forth or memory loss and
[2169.04 - 2173.32] any kind of other depersonalization
[2171.12 - 2176.68] anything when they
[2173.32 - 2178.88] travel you can get insomnia you can get
[2176.68 - 2181.48] restless legs when they travel to
[2178.88 - 2182.80] adjacent tissue you can get all kinds of
