industries aren't St Lee they're not St

51

Lee that's the whole point that that's

52
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,480
what we have to understand here and

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,400
alternative medicine used to be the

54
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,400
industry first of all the regular

55
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,280
medical industry the conventional Med

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,720
medical industry was never saintly and

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,319
going all the way back hundreds of years

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,720
it was never saintly it was never a pure

59
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,959
place um the doctors are the doctors are

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,319
let's not let's not mess that that up

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,319
let's not mess up that because that's

62
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,280
the doctors are I mean honestly like

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,959
angels and and you know and what happens

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,280
is that you know alternative medicine

65
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
though the the medicine the the the

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,440
industry was

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,800
saintly it was always pure in the

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,920
1800s the late 1800s the herbalists the

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,680
naturopaths that developed the nature

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,879
medicine nature

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,120
medicine you know that was that was

72
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,680
definitely and in the 1920s it was still

73
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,959
cleaning it was still 30s 1940s 50 60s

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,239
and then we got into the day the day

75
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,640
we're into now today today's age and I'm

76
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,720
sorry but alternative medicine the

77
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,200
industry has is slightly tainted because

78
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,840
these groups that I just mentioned are

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,760
all kind of in there so information

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,159
getting out there isn't always as like

81
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,360
it was back in the 1950s 40s 30s in

82
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,680
alternative

83
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,840
medicine and you know and always

84
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,560
remember that you

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,280
know when it comes down to the

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,120
practitioner itself that's different you

87
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,200
know that's different than the

88
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,159
practitioner the Healer the doctor

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,640
they're they're Saints to me every

90
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,159
naturopath you go and visit any

91
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,799
naturopath you go and visit just

92
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,400
remember there's probably hundreds of a

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,079
hundred easy hundred if not hundreds of

94
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,959
naturopaths that went to prison for no

95
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,760
reason just for waking up in the

96
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:03,079
morning putting on their their white

97
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,680
coat and helping people not because of

98
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,519
anything that harm or anything to happen

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,680
to people because the conventional

100
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,760
industry

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,040
ostracized and and privately went after

102
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,359
all the naturopaths in the old days all

103
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,239
the chiropractors in the old days when

104
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:19,400
medicine you know wanted to dominate

105
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,639
when conventional medicine wanted to

106
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,960
dominate and own it all and they didn't

107
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,880
like the they didn't like the nature

108
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,680
medicine rising up in the late 1800s and

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,840
early

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,639
1900s I mean there those doctors were

111
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,479
hung they were hung by their feet and

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,320
beaten and and you just need to know

113
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,000
that so when you go to your natural path

114
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,520
just you need respect and

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,240
honor where we've come from and how far

116
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,960
we've come it's like

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,039
unbelievable and you go to your

118
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,560
chiropractor you need to respect that

119
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,840
you need respect if you go to your

120
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,039
healer you need to respect that and if

121
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,880
you go to your conventional doctor you

122
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,240
need to respect that too of

123
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,039
course it wasn't wasn't the doctor's

124
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,280
faults it was the industry it was the

125
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,800
industry it was the industry I know you

126
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,479
know I know I'm going on a tangent about

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,960
this but it's important to know to have

128
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,160
that kind of respect when you go and see

129
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,440
your your healer when you go to see your

130
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,919
naturopath now I have naturopaths tell

131
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,600

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,840

is is upset about something and he

137
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,199
doesn't like the the naturopath or

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,440
something like that the naturopath is

139
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,319

lot of mystery and all that on every

342
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
level you know so mysterious that nobody

343
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,600
even knows what happens to food once it

344
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,320
enters the stomach I say that a lot I'm

you something right now right

348
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,440
now 500 years from now from this day

349
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,959
they're still not going to know what

350
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,800
happens to food when it enters the

351
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,320
stomach they're still not going to know

352
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,120
no one's going to know there's going to

353
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,720
be theories and more theories the enzyme

354
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,720
factor is a theory yes enzymes exist

355
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,160
they do play a role but what they do is

356
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,079
theoretical nobody knows what they do

357
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,800
nobody knows what they

358
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,920
do seriously even when we have a theory

359
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,920
of they break down food they cause you

360
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,360
know they cause a gastric breakdown of

361
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,480
food they help assist in digestion

362
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,920
Theory because we don't know there's no

363
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,920
way to measure it no way to weigh it

364
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,519
nobody can measure it nobody God knows

365
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,920
what happens inside the stomach when

366
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,199
food's dropped in there God

367
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,880
knows yeah God and if you don't believe

368
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:48,839
in God it's fine the universe universe

369
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,000
knows okay and and it's going to be like

370
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,000
that for 500 years 700 years a th000

371
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,199
years 1500 years 2,000 years and if we

372
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,240
haven't blown this planet to nothing by

373
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,959
then if we haven't blown it into Smither

374
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:07,560
and Ash and boulders burning Boulders

375
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:10,079
and we hav't literally nuked it and

376
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,120
wiped it clean by then if we haven't

377
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,279
burned it to just a just a ball of

378
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,040
nothingness by then we're still not

379
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,040
going to know what drops inside our

380
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,480
stomach we're still not going to know

381
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,720
and don't think I Haven an asked Spirit

382
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,480
when the world does end or if it does at

383
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,839
all I have many times and I do have

384
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,199
secrets about if the world is if it's

385
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,759
not when if it is or if it's never or I

386
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,279
have secrets to all that I am going to

387
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,360
do a book on that down the road but

388
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,160
there's just too much medical

389
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,519
information in the way there's too much

390
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,880
medical information there's too much

391
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:43,959
chronic illness and it needs to be

392
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,160
addressed and I just I got to push off

393
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:49,079
the fun stuff I have to push off the fun

394
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,839
stuff I have to push it away push it

395
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:55,880
away

396
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,079
so the deal is the deal is that um

397
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,519
because we don't know what happens to

398
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,160
food in the stomach we're not going to

399
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,440
know what foods really do help and

400
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,839
change what's happening down in there

401
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,360
like when you put celery juice in the

402
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,560
stomach and I'm going to take a little

403
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,759
sip I feel my I feel my acid reflux

404
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,680
already going

405
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,399
away I don't have any acid reflux but if

406
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,800
I

407
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,560
did it would start fixing

408
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,680
it what is acid reflux let's go into

409
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,120
that let's go into

410
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,800
that it doesn't mean I took another sip

411
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,720
of celery juice it doesn't mean I can't

412
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,680
get acid re flux if I'm under tremendous

413
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,720
stress someday like I'm always under

414
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,079
stress

415
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,519
anyway deadlines and stuff like that I

416
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,920
got to get the information out to you I

417
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,480
got to get all the blog blog articles

418
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,160
out to you I got to get all these radio

419
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
shows done I got to get the books done I

420
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,720
got to you know I got to be of help and

421
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,399
service any way I can in between it all

422
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,240
in any way

423
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,639
possible

424
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,560
and and doesn't mean you know I can't

425
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,959
get some stress and and and something

426
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,120
also changed chemist chemistry-wise in

427
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,040
the gut comes some stress happening

428
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,880
creating acid reflux I'm I don't want to

429
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,720
get it I hope I don't get it but if I do

430
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,640
which I could be susceptible to that

431
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,559
darn right someone said to me well

432
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,160
you're you're you know you're Anthony

433
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:18,000
William you you can't be susceptible to

434
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,280
anything well if I was not human if I

435
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,839
was if it was not human then sure I'm

436
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,319
human I'm just like you yeah I hear a

437
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,799
voice perfectly clear but if I don't

438
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,440
take care of myself you know some it's

439
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,400
Anything Could Happen

440
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,400
but I don't take care of

441
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,120
myself I mean it's just way the ball

442
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,000
rolls the way the ball rolls

443
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,039
so celery juice okay so what what what

444
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,280
is the bad what is this acid what is

445
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:47,559
this acid

446
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:50,919
reflux acid reflux aets those aets

447
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:54,520
aren't gastric acids those aren't

448
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,919
gastric acids news flash they're not

449
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,440
gastric

450
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:03,000
acid so when you get acid reflux and

451
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,960
it's always

452
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,720
happening news flash those aren't the

453
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,360
glands in the stomach creating gastric

454
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,000
acid and hydrochloric acid that's not

455
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,000
what that is that is an hydrochloric

456
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,280
acid burns like hell goes up the

457
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,360
esophagus Burns everything goes into

458
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,120
your throat they kind of spit it

459
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,240
out some people do some people don't it

460
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,760
can make you

461
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,720
cough cough and cough and coughing all

462
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,480
night all night long coughing on some

463
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,480
mucus too I've seen people

464
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,400
suffer I've seen people suffer or it's

465
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,200
just you Burns and it's rising up Burns

466
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,000
and it rises up Burns and it rises up

467
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,000
Burns and it rises up that's not gastric

468
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:53,600
acid would you believe

469
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,600
it but you know back to chronic chronic

470
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,280
illness research back to how it's so

471
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,000
deficient and anemic back to how you

472
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,679
know they can go to the best clinics the

473
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,120
best doctors it's not their fault

474
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,200
believe me it's not their fault they

475
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,720
just don't

476
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,919
know that's not gastric

477
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,720
acid it's an acid it's an acid produced

478
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:19,400
by something it's an acid produced

479
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,919
produced by poison inside the liver but

480
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,799
but but more than that it's an acid

481
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,280
produced by bacteria by

482
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,080
bacteria I'll say it again it's an acid

483
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,240
produced by bacteria you got acid reflux

484
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,679
there's a good

485
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,840
chance it's not reflux because you got a

486
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,120
kink and we're going to talk about that

487
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,600
if you have something going on that's

488
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,600
visible if you got something going on

489
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,559
like a

490
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,720
kink and that's what I love about

491
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,200
medicine too is you you get an MRI you

492
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,919
could get a because I can't be

493
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,799
everywhere to get people MRIs through

494
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,320
spirit I can't I tried that I tried that

495
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,960
for

496
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,200
decades and I still can't get every I

497
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,320
can't reach everybody I can't get

498
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,679
everybody done can't get the millions of

499
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,600
people that need help with me

500
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,280
personally can't do so I got to do it

501
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,799
through the books the

502
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,919
books the series the medical medium

503
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,080
series if you got one of them make sure

504
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,200
you get them all because they're all

505
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,320
interconnected they're all

506
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,280
interconnected it's

507
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,000
important they're they're they're there

508
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,960
for a reason and then here's the deal

509
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,159
here's the

510
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,000
deal if you don't have a kink if you

511
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:28,240
don't have something busted

512
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,360
inside I don't mean busted but you you

513
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,080
know what I mean you don't have because

514
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,600
what happens is we get wonky in there

515
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,360
internally we get first of all we get

516
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,280
hernas we get high anal hernas that

517
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,520
actually can cause a reflux that can

518
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,559
cause non bacteria related acid reflux

519
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,520
so if everything rolls out there's no

520
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,960
hiatal

521
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,360
hernia there's no

522
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,880
hernia in a weird place that maybe not

523
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,240
just Hiatal but there's all kinds of

524
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,960
hernas you can get in weird

525
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,080
places and uh and believe me I'm not I'm

526
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,840
not immune to a hernia I mean I could

527
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,640
pick up something stupid and heavy and

528
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,200
pop something out just like the best of

529
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,799
anybody can it's another thing too we

530
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,039
got to always be careful with that um we

531
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,480
got to be careful we get pushed into

532
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,080
workouts by the way that's just that's

533
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,000
just LED I I know I'm taking this off

534
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,000
track a little but not not necessarily

535
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,120
because if I can avoid a hernia with you

536
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
that's amazing um and then hey I could

537
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,080
avoid possible acid reflex then there

538
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,679
you go but if you're doing workouts or

539
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:30,039
you get sold into a workout thing don't

540
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,000
push it too hard a lot of a lot of

541
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,720
trainers they don't realize in so many

542
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,360
different ways they have people pick up

543
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,200
tires and stuff like that you just you

544
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,279
just don't do that that's so so silly

545
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,360
you just don't do that if you're a

546
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,120
trainer do offering that just stop that

547
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,520
stop that stop that whole thing or

548
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,760
you're like taking sledgehammers you

549
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,600
give them a sledgehammer you have them

550
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,720
hit a tire with it just don't do that I

551
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,840
can't tell you how many people get

552
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,200
hernas from that crap you don't even

553
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,039
know because everybody's doing that and

554
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,520
they're all getting hernas I know I know

555
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:05,240
so I hear about it all the time don't be

556
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,760
picking up giant tractor tires with

557
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,559
everything you got and pushing it over

558
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,720
there's nothing to prove there don't do

559
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:15,120
it do do responsible exercising okay you

560
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,520
do you know resistance you could do

561
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,159
weights you could do resistance you can

562
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,760
jog you can run anything you like to do

563
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,159
but you just just don't do things like

564
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,960
picking up gigantic tractor tires and

565
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,880
pushing them over in in in in the

566
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,120
workout place stuff like that oh be

567
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,840
careful be

568
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,559
careful um okay so let's go back let's

569
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,159
go back sorry guys let's go back into

570
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,640
this if you don't have a kink if you

571
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,200
don't have a hernia if you don't have a

572
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,159
blockage and those are easy to see for

573
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,679
MRIs and CAT scans and stuff like that

574
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,400
and ultrasounds

575
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,520
and and you know you go to the doctor

576
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,039
and you swallow that barium you swallow

577
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,679
that you know that glow-in-the-dark

578
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,679
material and then you go and get an

579
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,440
x-ray whatever it is if nothing's like

580
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,279
that is going on and you got the acid

581
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,799
reflux and you got some bacteria

582
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,880
Brewing could be undiagnosed bacteria of

583
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:11,559
course that's how it works I mean

584
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,320
hpylori can cause it but hpylori becomes

585
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,360
it's diagnosable sometimes and sometimes

586
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:20,760
it's not it's very elusive it it evades

587
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:23,000
andc escapes tests it tests all the time

588
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,880
hpylori is a

589
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,960
bacteria interesting Critter but

590
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,880
bacteria

591
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,039
produces an

592
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,240
acid produces an

593
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:39,640
acid that will trick out and mimic an

594
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,679
acid similar to gastric acid which will

595
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,679
trick out the doctor physician thinking

596
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,760
that this is just a tremendous amount of

597
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,640
acid regardless and not really know what

598
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,960
kind and what kind and

599
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:54,760
where bacterial acids that's what it is

600
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,640
that's what that acid is it's constantly

601
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,120
causing problems it's constantly going

602
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,400
up the esophagus it's const constantly

603
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,559
burning everything that's bacterial

604
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,039
acid heartburn a lot of times is a gas

605
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:11,039
bubble it's a gas

606
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:12,480
bubble and and not acid so a lot of

607
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,600
different cases of heartburn someone

608
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,000
describes like I got a heartburn I got

609
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,880
heartburn that you know I can't tell you

610
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,559
how many people they came to me and

611
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,919
they're like I got heartburn in the old

612
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,919
days like that's that's gastritis and

613
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,520
like maybe it is yeah it is and then

614
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:27,960
there's heartburn world oh okay now it's

615
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,480
burning up here okay no that that's

616
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,600
burning yeah no that's heartburn that's

617
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,360
heartburn that's that's that's that's

618
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,559
you know that's acid

619
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,039
reflux and

620
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:46,640
um so what happens is you got bacterial

621
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:49,760
acid that's not gland produced gland

622
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,360
produced gastric acid and hydrochloric

623
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,919
acid in the

624
00:24:51,360 --> 00:25:00,480
stomach do you know what happens when

625
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:03,000
you're getting acid reflux from Bad acid

626
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,960
bacterial produced

627
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,559
acid do you know what

628
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,520
happens it means you have no

629
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,600
hydrochloric acid left or very little

630
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,559
because if you did have enough

631
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:21,159
hydrochloric acid it would be destroying

632
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:24,919
the bacteria so you wouldn't have acid

633
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:28,360
reflux yep

634
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:30,840
yep yep yes

635
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,960
I'm trying not to say that's right

636
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,399
that's

637
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,200
right that's what's going on there

638
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:40,000
what's going on is if you got the bad

639
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,880
acids and you got that acid reflux and

640
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,399
that's bacterial produced

641
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,120
reflux that's what that acid is it's

642
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:50,520
it's acids produced by

643
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,880
bacteria if that's going on that means

644
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,480
you don't have any toone to very little

645
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,279
hydrochloric acid but that might not be

646
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,320
diagnosed properly at a practitioner's

647
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,120
office both conventional or alternative

648
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,679
or functional because they think you're

649
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,320
filled with acid so they're thinking you

650
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:07,760
got tons of hydrochloric acid or they're

651
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:11,200
think you got tons of gastric acid

652
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,120
no you got acid in your gastric system

653
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,039
but it's coming from

654
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,760
bacteria it doesn't mean taking

655
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,440
antibiotics either it doesn't mean you

656
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,080
got to jump on the antibiotic thing to

657
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,559
start killing off bacteria because that

658
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,279
will just create more bacteria and more

659
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,440
bacterial

660
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:28,440
acid I know so there's so many people

661
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,159
with h pyloric diagnosed hpor did they

662
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,600
do the antibiotics for hpor and then

663
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,840
they have the worst aser reflux for the

664
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,679
next 10 years I see that all the time I

665
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,000
saw that all the

666
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,840
time and you know we so and I'm not

667
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,320
against antibiotics they're great when

668
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,440
when you need them for certain things I

669
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,279
mean there's there's things you need

670
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,440
them for there's no doubt about

671
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:50,840
it but we could be cautious when we use

672
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,320
them and how we use

673
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,919
them that's important to

674
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,760
know sip of celery juice again so here's

675
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,039
the deal

676
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,320
here's the

677
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:04,799
deal if we have that kind of problem

678
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,080
going on that means our hydrochloric

679
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,760
acid is gone so we have to build their

680
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,559
hydrochloric acid back up and it doesn't

681
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:15,600
mean taking HCL capsules or HCL pills

682
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:19,039
hydrochloric acid pills we need to build

683
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,399
it back up and that's really important

684
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,720
very important we need to change the

685
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,200
diet around too because there's

686
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,279
something in our diet that's feeding

687
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,000
bacteria whatever that is could be wheat

688
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:31,000
and gluten could be corn could be weak

689
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,840
gluten could be Dairy could be eggs eggs

690
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
feeds bacteria like no other you know

691
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,279
what even if you have your best chicken

692
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,799
eggs from your best friend's

693
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,120
backyard which is the ones to eat if

694
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:46,039
you're going to eat an egg even if you

695
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,320
have the BET and the the the yolk is

696
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:52,000
nice and dark it's not like Factory

697
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,519
chicken eggs the yolk is nice and

698
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,720
dark delicious

699
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,159
egg right I mean a coyote with would

700
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,080
love that

701
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:05,799
egg a fox would love that egg my God be

702
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,559
a fox's dream to get that kind of

703
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:12,559
egg and you know even even those kinds

704
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:15,399
of eggs which you know which are the

705
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,120
nutritious ones they still will feed a

706
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:18,200
bacteria and it's not the egg's fault

707
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,559
it's not the chicken's fault it's not

708
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,919
your fault I said this before actually

709
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,440
recently that the medical industry not

710
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,159
the alternative medical industry the

711
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,039
conventional medical industry ruined

712
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,960
eggs for us they ruined it as a food

713
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,279
they ruined it as a food

714
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,279
source because they used it in the lab

715
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:40,360
to feed and raise bacteria for a hundred

716
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:43,000
years now and that's what they did and

717
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,080
they used it in the labs to feed viruses

718
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,360
and bacteria to play around with bugs

719
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,559
and pathogens they used it as a food

720
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,799
source I don't care what anybody tells

721
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,960
me they're wrong if they say no that's

722
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:55,960
not true and they're wrong if they say

723
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,200
that bugs don't eat anything they're

724
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,679
wrong wrong wrong I don't care if you're

725
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,480
a scientist saying it I don't care

726
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,279
you're wrong I don't know I don't know

727
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,799
why you don't have the right information

728
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,440
I don't know how that happened I don't

729
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:09,000
know if it wasn't just taught to you or

730
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,720
what it wasn't told to you or your

731
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,080
supervisor didn't tell you at a lab or

732
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,159
something whatever happened or there

733
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,799
wasn't a study on it that you could read

734
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,919
but you're wrong bugs feed off of things

735
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,240
food food food like we feed off of food

736
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:23,960
and eggs are one of them and it's not

737
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,360
that this would have never happened if

738
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,640
they didn't use egg they used corn too

739
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,960
corn they ruined corn on

740
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,399
us corn is delicious totally screwed

741
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,440
that up the medical industry ruined that

742
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,840
on us and then they grow all the GMO

743
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,559
medical corn on top of it and they

744
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,919
ruined it even more and they ruined it

745
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:46,159
it was corn eggs and even some Dairy was

746
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,519
used to Corn eggs mostly but these are

747
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:52,720
the things that feed the bugs they feed

748
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,000
the bugs so you know so diet matters so

749
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,720
that's important to know so we got to

750
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,080
build up the hydrochloric acid we got to

751
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,600
clean up the liver a little bit cuz the

752
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,720
liver is not functioning that great if

753
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,760
we have acid

754
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,120
reflux that's going to be a big part of

755
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,799
it too might have a fatty liver

756
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,360
developing pre fatty liver might be

757
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:08,880
pre-diabetic for a lot of people with

758
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,399
acid reflux they have this pre

759
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,960
pre-diabetes not pre-diabetes pre

760
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:18,519
pre-diabetes and then guess what guess

761
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:22,960
what there's pre pre pre-diabetes

762
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:26,240
interesting huh pre pre pre-diabetes PPP

763
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,880
diabetes that's right nobody knows that

764
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,640
either

765
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,960
and that is happening in people so

766
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,200
that's going on with their liver and

767
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,960
that's what's happening it's all liver

768
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,360
caused and then you got you know weak

769
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,159
digestion because if the liver is

770
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,720
getting beaten down then the liver

771
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,960
doesn't produce the strong bile so that

772
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,640
means your stomach has to

773
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,919
overproduce hydrochloric acid your your

774
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,279
stomach has to overproduce hydrochloric

775
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:56,200
acid and wears it out wears the stomach

776
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:58,760
right out exhausts the stomach's gastric

777
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,799
ability to produce the proper kind of

778
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,600
acids because the liver's so burdened

779
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,840
and and so constantly having to spit out

780
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,440
all that bile to digest tons of protein

781
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,039
and tons of fat in everybody's diet the

782
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,440
liver weakens and breaking down breaking

783
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,200
down it breaks down is breaking a word

784
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,519
it could be and you know here's the

785
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,039
thing with all that

786
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,320
happening and then what goes wrong is

787
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,919
the stomach the HCL starts to then

788
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,919
diminish starts to WAN starts to fall

789
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,760
back

790
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,440
the glands in the stomach can't produce

791
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,880
the stomach can't produce anymore and if

792
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,320
you're not drinking celery juice and

793
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,200
you're not taking care of yourself you

794
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,320
can't even build your stomach acids back

795
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,679
up you can't even clean the liver up and

796
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,039
build it back up and people go on even

797
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,919
higher protein diets and they wear their

798
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:47,080
liver down more even if things gotten

799
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,240
better in their health in other ways

800
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,480
they're still breaking their liver down

801
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,480
they're still setting themselves up for

802
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,799
the worst hydrochloric acid deficiency

803
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,039
and they're setting themselves up for

804
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,120
down the road WEA the time they're in

805
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,120
their 50s or 30s or 80s or whatever

806
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,799
whatever it's going to be they're going

807
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,799
to have that acid reflux kick up because

808
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,559
that bacteria is going to grow bacteria

809
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,720
is going to grow and when it grows

810
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:09,360
produces bad acid your Hydrochloric

811
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,279
acid's too weak you don't have enough

812
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,720
hydrochloric acid to kill off that

813
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:17,000
bacteria and remember that hydrochloric

814
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,799
acid blend is a seven blend that's that

815
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,240
only Spirit knows and release that

816
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,720
information I talked about that in the

817
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,080
first book I'm going to talk about it

818
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,039
again in the next

819
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,240
book

820
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:33,080
and

821
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,799
so and what happens is that seven blend

822
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,600
three of that seven could be diminishing

823
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,840
so then practitioner doesn't even know

824
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,600
somebody's hydrochloric acid is even

825
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,840
low so we have to build up the HCL to

826
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,279
kill off the bacteria so the overgrowth

827
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,639
doesn't happen and I'm not just talking

828
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,600
about sibo small intestinal tract you

829
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:53,279
know bacterial overgrowth I'm talking

830
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,039
about bacteria that's just not that's

831
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:59,000
just in general sitting in the

832
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,000
dadum

833
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,320
and then sitting in the in this in the

834
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,880
stomach pouch the bottom of the pouch

835
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,080
there's this well there a well at the

836
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,000
bottom of the

837
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,799
pouch stomach pouch it's a little

838
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,080
well okay and there's this little spot

839
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:17,440
too that dips

840
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,760
down and and stuff collects in that

841
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,639
little spot it collects there right

842
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,519
there that's where bacteria loves to

843
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,240
grow right in that little spot do you

844
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,799
ever go to the beach and it's low tide

845
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,960
and there's water in this one little

846
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,320
spot but yet there's no water in that

847
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,799
spot that's how what it's like there's a

848
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,200
little spot in the bottom of the

849
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:41,240
stomach little spot little little patch

850
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,279
in there it's almostly you know a little

851
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,840
spot and right there at the bottom of

852
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,919
the corner there it's you know little

853
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,960
spot lots of things can grow in there

854
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,760
bacteria loves to grow there especially

855
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,720
if somebody's got a weak hydrochloric

856
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,760
acid the bacteria just spawns and grows

857
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:03,039
right there and when it does it spawns

858
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:07,039
and creates acid not hydrochloric acid

859
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:10,679
no not the seven blend no not other

860
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:15,560
factors in gastric acid from glands

861
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:20,040
no it spawns and grows an ugly mutant

862
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:24,599
foreign acid that mimics acid stomach

863
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,599
acid hydrocor whatever mimics all the

864
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,119
acids and that's what it does and that's

865
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,560
the bacteria right there that creates

866
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,040
that and sure you can have sibo too

867
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,919
which we did in the sibo show which is

868
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,480
all strep a cacus that's defin and that

869
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:41,440
strep can get in there too and strep in

870
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,320
the small intestinal tract if it's high

871
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,639
enough can create a lot of acid

872
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,639
absolutely and that can spew up into

873
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,200
dadum and push up even further into the

874
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,879
stomach and somebody could have a lot of

875
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,879
acid going

876
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:54,879
on

877
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:00,000
yeah it's all it's it's all fixable

878
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,119
though it's all fixable it's all we can

879
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,119
all work on it we can all get it better

880
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:05,720
we can all do things about it we can all

881
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,720
get it in the right place we can get rid

882
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:11,160
of acid reflux but what I like about

883
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,480
doing the show on acid reflux is you

884
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,720
know you're covering a few things you

885
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,599
want to get the liver a little bit

886
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,240
better you want to knock down

887
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,119
bacteria right talked about kinks in the

888
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,480
gut kinks in the intestinal tract I

889
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,160
hernas different kind of her we're

890
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,880
covering a lot of

891
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,680
ground so it's not just this thing where

892
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,359
okay I got acid reflux let me find a

893
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,560
pill for it let's see if

894
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:38,839
aw has you know has some kind of pill

895
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,400
the magical natural pill because I got

896
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:41,839
this acid reflex no it's more than that

897
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,160
it's the information because it empowers

898
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,599
you strengthens you and then we'll do

899
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,560
more than just a magic pill we'll do

900
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,119
some different foods so first of all

901
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,920
what not to eat just go to my what not

902
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,319
to

903
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,000
eats you know and in in all the

904
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:58,599
books and uh that's really a big deal

905
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,280
that's a big deal for getting rid of

906
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,160
acid reflux if your animal protein lover

907
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,800
lower reduce it because you're just

908
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,920
going to max out your liver with all

909
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,119
that animal fat and you're going to

910
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,680
force your liver to produce extra bile

911
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,000
salts to break down that animal fat and

912
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,119
you're going to weaken your hydrochloric

913
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,920
acid because your stomach's going to

914
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,599
have to overproduce hydrochloric acid

915
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,480
once again and just exhaust itself kind

916
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,640
of like adrenals when adrenals get tired

917
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,160
and all of a sudden you get a bad

918
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,599
experience it happens to you and then

919
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,599
your adrenals don't have anything else

920
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,000
to spit out so they just shoot out

921
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,280
whatever they got left and they're

922
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,119
really exhausted you know like when a a

923
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,560
girlfriend breaks up with a boyfriend or

924
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,720
a boyfriend breaks up with a girlfriend

925
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:41,240
or or anything anything that happens in

926
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,720
Life or you walked into the office one

927
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,800

adrenals got hit adrenals got weakened

938
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,040
well it's the same thing with the

939
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,200
intestinal tract you dropped too much

940
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,319
animal protein down too much animal

941
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,480
protein too much animal fat down in

942
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:17,240
there and same thing if you're a vegan

943
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,040
you drop too much nut fat too much

944
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,960
coconut oil oh my God I saw somebody eat

945
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,599
like a half a jar of coconut oil and

946
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,960
they gave themselves pancreatitis and

947
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,000
they were a vegan and they gave

948
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,440
themselves pancreatitis this matter if

949
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,240
they were a vegan or a meat eater if

950
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,640
they're a meat eater and drank a whole

951
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,079
bottle of coconut oil yeah it's possible

952
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,240
they can give themselves pancreatitis

953
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,880
too and just for the record meat eaters

954
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,040
get more pancreatitis than any

955
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,880
vegetarian or vegan has ever gotten in

956
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,720
the history of medicine I'm going to say

957
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,119
that not cuz I'm standing up for vegans

958
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,319
right now and I'm trying to knock down

959
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,880
animal protein people that's not it at

960
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:50,800
all I'm just telling you right now

961
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,800
pancreatitis is from animal fats from

962
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,200
pork more people get pancreatitis from

963
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,960
pork than anything else anything else

964
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:04,160
Bak bacon ham pork roast whatever that

965
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,760
is pork chops uh ribs more people get

966
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,319
pancreatitis in cases of pancreatitis

967
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,480
from all that pork and all that and the

968
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:13,599
burgers and all that stuff even if it's

969
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,319
grass-fed burgers and all that butter on

970
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,560
their lobster whatever it is more people

971
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:20,880
get pancreatitis that way than vegans do

972
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,200
eating too many nuts or a half a jar of

973
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,760
coconut oil I've seen meat eaters drink

974
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,200
a whole bottle of olive oil thinking

975
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,560
they're going to flush out gallbladder

976
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,839
and liver which you can't and it doesn't

977
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,280
work and they do that and they give

978
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,800
themselves pancreatitis because they

979
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,240
also had a steak the night before I've

980
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,280
also seen vegans drop a whole bottle of

981
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,280
olive oil down and give themselves

982
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,640
pancreatitis and then the night before

983
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:48,000
they had you know a big nut pie so it's

984
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,960
like seriously like you know whatever

985
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,160
but the bottom line is

986
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,040
um you know we got to reduce that animal

987
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,440
fat if you're in the Animal product

988
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,760
world and we we just got to reduce the

989
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,160
fats so that the liver is not

990
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,680
overburdened if you want your acid

991
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,319
reflux to go away you want you don't

992
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,480
want that liver overburdened I'm telling

993
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,680
you right now if it's overburdened

994
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,240
what's going to happen is it's going to

995
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,960
overproduce bile it's going to try to

996
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,480
make bile so damn strong it's going to

997
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,880
weaken the liver it's going to push out

998
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,839
so much bile and when that happens when

999
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,560
that happens the the liver weakens and

1000
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,599
then what happens the stomach over

1001
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,839
produces the hydrochloric acid it burns

1002
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,000
itself out Burns it out like a

1003
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:29,839
star Burns it out like a rock star when

1004
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,040
rock stars get burnt

1005
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,599
out and I'm you know I've known a lot of

1006
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,920
rock stars over the years I've helped

1007
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,800
out a lot of rock stars over the years

1008
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,920
and they get all burnt out you know and

1009
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,280
so it's it's and that's what happens

1010
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:47,359
your hydrochloric acid they you know it

1011
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,800
burns out and so you want to kind of

1012
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,640
restore that so how do we store that

1013
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,440
what do we what do we do what are we

1014
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,839
trying to do well you know I I

1015
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,440
antibacterials don't I mean they we

1016
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,400
shouldn't disc guard them natural ones

1017
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,119
herbal ones a little bit of golden seal

1018
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,720
once in a while will lower a bacterial

1019
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,520
load in the gut a little bit of golden

1020
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,720
seal once in a while little bit of eona

1021
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,359
golden seal it does reduce that little

1022
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,079
bit of Elderberry syrup once in a while

1023
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,760
cats CLW a little bit of cats claw here

1024

and there if you ever want you can lower

1025
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,560
and reduce that bacterial stuff a little

1026
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,960
bit of oregano oil oregano oil time tea

1027
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,400
time time water time tea the stuff I

1028
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,480
always promote in the books like

1029
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,760
life-changing foods you can you can

1030
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,599
lower you can

1031
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,560
lower the uh bacterial

1032
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:39,560
load lemon balm lowers the bacterial

1033
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:41,760
load why does peppermint tea help with

1034
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,880
digestion nobody knows you know I was

1035
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,280
talking to an herbalist a while back too

1036
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,920
a well-known one and they were just like

1037
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,760
I love what you do I love what you do I

1038
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,800
I I I learn a lot even as an herbalist

1039
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,599
you

1040
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,520
know he go let me ask he goes let me ask

1041
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,440
you this question Anthony let me asked

1042
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,040
this gu I'm like what and he's a really

1043
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,920
nice guy really nice guy and he said he

1044
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,680
said peppermint tea peppermint tea you

1045
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,480
know it it it works really good with

1046
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,680
that bacteria in the stomach I'm I'm

1047
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,520
guessing because you're telling me the

1048
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,119
bacteria is the acid reflux so the

1049
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,880
peppermint tea it

1050
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,760
helps with the acid reflux how's that

1051
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,160
possible that is it that I go because

1052
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,000
it's actually knocking down bacteria he

1053
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,240
says no but herbalists know that that's

1054
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,520
not one of the antibacterials peppermint

1055
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,359
te herbalists know that that's not

1056
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,200
really one of the main that's not an

1057
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,720
antiviral antibacterial herb I go yes it

1058
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,680
is it's an antibacterial herb nobody

1059
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,680
knows that it's like I'll be darned I'll

1060
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,800
be darned I'm going to be talking about

1061
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,000
that on my lectures that's what he

1062
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,800
said and you know he's helped a lot of

1063
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,640
people he's helped a lot of people I

1064
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,560
mean just in his whole career being an

1065
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,040
herbalist he's helped a lot of people I

1066
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,319
love herbalists you know the thing is is

1067
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,760
this is that is that is because that

1068
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,560
peppermint alone peppermint tea does

1069
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,200
diminish bacteria certain bacteria in

1070
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,040
the in the gut meaning in the top in the

1071
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,680
stomach in there so that one helps the

1072
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,520
lemon bomb like I said before peppermint

1073
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,400

1080
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,640
lot of time and energy exhausting and a

1081
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:32,680
lot of money involved to create this we

1082
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,720

it for a long time but we kept on

1086
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,200
hearing from so many people like I got

1087
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,640
this supplement and I'm not getting

1088
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,680
result because that supplement is

1089
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,280
actually garbage or I got this

1090
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,680
supplement and it just burned my throat

1091
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,920
yeah because it was loaded with citric

1092
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,599
acid or whatever it is so finally we had

1093
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,040
to create a

1094
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,160

people people that weren't you know they

1152
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:08,680

00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,079
used to being with

1154
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,760

1155
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,839
their food out we were having lunch and

1156
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,160
all that and I grabbed a leaf an Al of

1157
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:23,359
leaf I cracked it open and I took a

1158
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:25,359
spoon I sliced it open so it was It was

1159
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,800
kind of open where I I then took a spoon

1160
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,359
and I divided at the flaps and I just

1161
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,960
scraped inside the leaf and I just ate

1162
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,119
the whole Alo leaf that was my lunch

1163
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,720
that day and everybody looked at me like

1164
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:37,520
like even though they knew of course and

1165
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,839
they know and everything else and there

1166
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,839
that's the whole point I mean they knew

1167
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:43,400
if they're me you know with me they knew

1168
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,640
but they were still so surprised I'm

1169
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,480
like why are you surprised they're like

1170
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,000
what I just never seen anybody do that

1171
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,800
for lunch I go yeah I'm doing that

1172
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,960
because the flu it's flu season right

1173
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,440
now it's flu season people have

1174
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,079
pneumonia out there it's flu season it's

1175
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,599
traveling I was hopping on a plane on

1176
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:02,240
and off planes or whatever and you know

1177
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,200
what this Alo does it kills bacteria and

1178
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,240
it kills viruses so if I happen to

1179
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,040
accidentally ingest or inhale a a neuro

1180
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,079
virus which is a flu virus which is a

1181
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,640
stomach flu virus and it gets on my

1182
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,280
tongue and it goes down my throat and

1183
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,359
gets to my stomach and fires up the

1184
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,920
worst stomach flu ever I got some aloe

1185
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,440
sitting down all around in there and

1186
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,319
that's bacterial and viral

1187
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,440
killing that's why people's acid reflux

1188
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:29,319
drops

1189
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,599
substantially

1190
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:34,720
substantially when you use aloe water or

1191
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:39,200
aloe

1192
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:41,520
juice yeah it's another secret weapon

1193
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,040
but what's the goal what's the goal it's

1194
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,920
killing off the

1195
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,680
bacteria that's the goal the other goal

1196
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,319
is getting the liver better getting this

1197
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,480
hydrochloric acid stronger and that's

1198
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:53,559
where the Cel juice comes up with the

1199
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,400
with the the hidden subgroup mineral

1200
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:56,800
salts that rebuild your hydrochloric

1201
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,480
acid

1202
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,520
that rebuild and restore glands in the

1203
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,119
stomach that produce HCL in the seven

1204
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,960
blend the mystery 7 blend nobody to this

1205
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:12,760
day knows about except for

1206
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:15,960
us so and that that right there is why

1207
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,359

because he heard it from somebody else

1278
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,280
he heard it from somewhere else and I

1279
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,480
know where the original Source came 11

1280
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,920
years ago from a doctor that brought it

1281
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,520
into the industry because it was to sell

1282
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,319
his fruit pills he didn't want people

1283
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,920
eating fruit I remember the day it

1284
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:08,799
happened and it's just spread like

1285
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,520

everything under the sun as eggs they

1298
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:47,240
kept cancer alive in Labs back in the

1299
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:49,640
1950s by putting eggs in with them

1300
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,079
Christ but yet no but you know they all

1301
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,400
be like oh fruit will feed cancer it

1302
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,559
doesn't feed cancer you know what fruit

1303
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,599
does it kills bacteria that causes acid

1304
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:01,880
reflux you just can't eat a fruit

1305
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:03,680
pie on top of a steak the body fights

1306
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,319
itself cuz the fruit just wants to do

1307
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,799
right while the steak wants to just do

1308
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:10,480
wrong not saying you can quit steak if

1309
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:13,599
you're a steak eater I'm just saying I

1310
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,200
can't put the two together the fruit is

1311
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,760
a bacterial

1312
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,480
killer and it wants to rush through your

1313
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,319
stomach through your dadum through your

1314
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,680
intestinal tract it wants to rush

1315
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:24,079
through it wants to push through it

1316
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,119
wants to drive all the way through and

1317
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,520
it wants to kill everything shouldn't be

1318
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:31,160
there and save everything that should be

1319
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:34,839
there so when I hear misinformation it

1320
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:36,440

1321
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,920
