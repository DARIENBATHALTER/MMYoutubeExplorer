1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
I bought this right here and I looked at

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,140
it I was like you're spindly you're

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,880
skinny and spindly and small why would

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,500
you say that reason why I got the celery

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,780
juice out there all these decades is

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,120
because for chronic illness it's an

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,460
integral part of helping people recover

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,220
this machine cold press masticating

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,380
juicer with a triple auger gets the

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,320
nutrients out without damaging or

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,599
scorching the vegetable or in this case

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,760
the herb what you're making right here

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,760
is herbal medicine

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,980
the mm-1500 100 off right now you guys

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,140
know I work with the mega and everything

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,600
it is the medicine maker the reason why

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,520
is because it extracts to such a degree

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,200
and what happens with other juicers like

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,180
the basket juicers that everybody gets

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,579
suckered into is it's deficient juice

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,820
because it's not extracting enough of

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,699
the nutrients the mm 1500 extracts such

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,120
a large quantity of critical nutrients

24
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,780
literally leaves dust behind to that

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,780
degree almost

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,220
you're looking at really dry pulp

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,500
because of the compression how sick is

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,720
that this isn't wet and sloppy pull

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,020
people don't juice like the medical

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,600
medium Community juices people don't put

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,460
wear and tear on their juicers like the

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,320
medical medium Community does the other

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,960
juicers out there will never stand up

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,020
for that it can't handle that intensity

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,180
it's not possible that's why the mm-1500

36
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,939
is here it's here to handle that that's

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,420
a celery juice right there boom boom

38
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,750
boom

39
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:43,579
boom boom fresh off the press

40
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:47,299
