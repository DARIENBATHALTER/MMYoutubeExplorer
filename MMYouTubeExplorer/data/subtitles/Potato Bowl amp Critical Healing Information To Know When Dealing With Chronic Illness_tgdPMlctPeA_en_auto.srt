00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,600
live live on facebook live on youtube

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,200
making a potato bowl it's gonna have

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,360
some nice onion in there

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,360
it's gonna have asparagus see i got

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,440
beautiful asparagus right here you guys

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
and it's gonna have potatoes too so i'm

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
gonna chop up some asparagus and get it

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,640
going right away

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,920
we're talking about today how incredibly

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,439
important it is

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,240
when you're sick that everything you do

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,000
matters right we don't want to go 10

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,280
steps ahead

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and then go 25 steps

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
backwards we don't want to do that right

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
we want to go

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
ahead and if we go backwards a little

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,160
bit

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,160
it's only in the natural process of

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,120
healing and then we go ahead even

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,399
more so it's like the three steps up two

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,280
steps back sometimes

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,840
boom three steps up again two steps back

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,480
right

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,280
three steps up again two steps back

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,640
right

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,920
and we don't wanna go ahead

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,040
we don't want to go three steps up

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,400
25 30 steps back and that's what's

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
happening with so many people trying to

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720

right

99
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,319
3692 even after that

100
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,599
i'm going to steam up some asparagus

101
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,599
right here i'm going to get it cooking

102
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,239
yeah so we're doing that

103
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,239
um let me go get a utensil too

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,239
cooking utensil that would be nice to

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,560
have one there

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,319
i got asparagus in the pan so you guys

107
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,519
it looks like we're censored

108
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,200
tonight to a point that's to a level

109
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,440
i've never seen before

110
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
so there's only 200 people on in total

111
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,360
between youtube and facebook

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,480
so we are actually we're actually

113
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,400
super duper uh super duper

114
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,319
censored so this is very interesting

115
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,239
um that means no one's allowed to come

116
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,480
on tonight so if you guys made it on

117
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,840
it's a miracle i'm just letting you know

118
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,400
it's a miracle

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,120
um so anyway

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,160
seriously that's like as censoring as

121
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,160
censoring can ever be

122
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,080
well look it's an intimate small crowd

123
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,080
it's good i like that too so i don't

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
mind so i'm gonna get the lid on here

125
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,000
just moving around getting it to kind of

126
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,560
take so i got some asparagus i'm

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,800
steaming up i'm making a potato bowl

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,080
and i want to tell you guys first of all

129
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
what i do every day

130
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,880
right or every other day and so forth i

131
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
take a bunch of potatoes i cook them up

132
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,800
i steam them up right in a steamer right

133
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
and i have all these potatoes and then i

134
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
put them in the fridge

135
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,440
and i don't put a lid on them in the

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,479
fridge because the potatoes can get

137
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,080
kind of spongy right so

138
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,560
i don't like to um i don't like to put a

139
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
lid

140
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,759
on a bowl and have potatoes in it that

141
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,639
way

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,240
i like having the lid off the bowl when

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,400
it sits in the fridge so when i steam a

144
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,880
whole bunch of potatoes

145
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,160
i like them kind of like dry like a

146
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,160
little bit dry

147
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,360
and to do that as i put them in the

148
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,479
fridge it's just the way i like it you

149
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,479
might like it where they're

150
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
moist after you steam them and they're

151
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,199
moist right you might be somebody that

152
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,800
likes that way

153
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,759
hi monica glad you're coming on there um

154
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,960
and so what i like to do is keep them

155
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,160
kind of like in the fridge

156
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,240
with the cover off right of a bowl

157
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,759
or you know no saran wrap on there or

158
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,360
anything like that and then i like i

159
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,840
like the air just getting to them in the

160
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,479
fridge

161
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,800
and then they stay where they stay in a

162
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
way where they keep dry inside

163
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,080
just a little trick i want to give you

164
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,880
right now nicholas says how long do you

165
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
steam them

166
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,160
you got to steam them until the fork

167
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,759
goes through them right that's what you

168
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,919
want to do

169
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
you don't want them hard in the center

170
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,680
you want to steam them and it

171
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
it depends on where you are what

172
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,000
altitude you're in

173
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,759
right and around the world could be at a

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,880
higher altitude lower altitude

175
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,639
so can't i can't give you a time because

176
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,720
it may not be the same time

177
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
right and you might have hard water you

178
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,919
might have

179
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,039
soft water all these things make a

180
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,479
difference right so

181
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,400
when you're steaming but you want to

182
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,000
steam them till the fork goes through

183
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,160
right you want to catch them

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,120
you don't want to overcook your potatoes

185
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
but you want to make sure they're

186
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,639
steamed all the way through

187
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,319

blood

230
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,080
they take a little too much blood you

232
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,919
blood they're taking five full vials

233
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,800
seven full vials

234
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,240
10 or 12 or 14 full vials and they start

235
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,000
removing your immune system right

236
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,280
without realizing it without even

237
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,720
knowing what's wrong with you to begin

238
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,199

okay and i've talked about that you guys

243
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,280

your doctor

245
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,759
about like half files and so forth

246
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
because the labs take half files the

247
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,960
labs take quarter vials right

248
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,639
and then maybe scheduling more

249
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,080
appointments at the doctor for blood

250
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,760
work where you're doing some tests so

251
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,159
you divide the tests

252
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
um elena anthony my white blood count

253
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
went back to normal range

254
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,959
after your protocol and supplements and

255
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,279
they were

256
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,279

it the keto diet well you got off

334
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,440
processed foods so that's helping

335
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,200
is it maybe you went vegan and you know

336
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,000

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,680
in some of those supplements that's

344
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,720

345
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,399

355
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,720
they want you to heal but there's

356
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,920
alcohol in all their supplements alcohol

357
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,480
i've seen this for years

358
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,600
okay i've seen this in the alternative

359
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
healing arts

360
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,839
with uh with a natural doctor

361
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,040
out there okay that has a lot of

362
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,399
programs out

363
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,680
all right and but was just

364
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,600
constantly dumping all these alcohol

365
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,440
you know all these alcohol filled

366
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,920
supplements and

367
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,959
that's already a no-no you can't get

368
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,440
someone to the finish line

369
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,959
when maybe one person you'll get close

370
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,399
enough because you're doing all these

371
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,959
other good things

372
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
but the alcohol supplements will it will

373
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,160
stop somebody from getting to the finish

374
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
line and then we go backwards

375
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,519
or that's just one thing right just

376
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,480
using it as an example

377
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,680
and so and and then there's the whole

378
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,120
thing where

379
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,720
when someone gets sick and they're

380
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,920
really getting sick and they're really

381
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,160
sensitive

382
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,720
and anything could kick him downhill and

383
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,120
then now we're in the land of the lost

384
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,680
and it matters like we can lose

385
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,959
ourselves we can lose ourselves in that

386
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,079
fight

387
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,600

that too ichoda you're here tonight

419
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,399
amazing so

420
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,920
um anyway guys we're talking about how

421
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,440
to protect yourselves what to look out

422
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,480
for you don't want to go 10 steps

423
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
forward

424
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,839
and 25 steps back you don't want to go

425
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,560
three steps forward and

426
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,839
10 steps back right you want to go three

427
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,920
steps forward

428
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,880
another three steps forward another two

429
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,880
steps forward

430
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
another one step forward another two

431
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,199
steps back

432
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,360
but you're already way ahead of where

433
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,720
you were when you started and then boom

434
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
three steps forward again now you're one

435
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,480
more step

436
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,440
ahead of the two steps right and so it's

437
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
this whole thing

438
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,959
even if it feels like you went 10 steps

439
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,399
back

440
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,320
but you're healing and moving forward

441
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,839
than you ever did and i want to talk

442
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,079
about something else but we don't want

443
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,480
to really go backwards and we

444
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,399
never get to heal and we're stuck and we

445
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,760
can't go forward and we never get to be

446
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,440
where we need to be

447
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,519
we can't get there we don't want to go

448
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,360
there we don't want to be there right

449
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,920
really important um

450
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,199
so let's go into a different aspect of

451
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,519
this which is critical let me get the

452
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,839
white blood cells in the cpc off my

453
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,639
my little counter here my little uh

454
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,519
board

455
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,720
and let's talk about like some of the

456
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,320
fundamental

457
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,839
like like rules i could call them roles

458
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,639
i guess right because we can make our

459
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,160
own rules

460
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,720
right and we can make our own

461
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,079
way right and we can choose what we're

462
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,519
what what we want to do in medical

463
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,519

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,760

that's one thing right there that just

519
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,600
has to go if you want to heal it's about

520
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,799
moving some of these these things out

521
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,720
these are basics though

522
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,080
they weren't basics they weren't basics

523
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,880
35 years ago

524
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,320
right people wanted to chop off my head

525
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,679

526
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,600

right i got this great butter and i

553
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,600
churned it myself right which is better

554
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,120
than buying store-bought butter

555
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
definitely and better than buying butter

556
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,240

557
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,520

558
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,280
it from a farm where i

559
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,640

560
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,200
animals and i can

people will do too

566
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,360
is to state their case they'll say they

567
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,640
were sicker than they

568
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,720
were now in all fairness

569
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,840
anybody who's sick with a symptom i'm

570
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,400

572
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,400
reality

573
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,480
when it comes to stating your case on

574
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
social media i've seen a lot of people

575
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,799
where

576
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,360
and i've talked first of all i've talked

577
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,120
to a lot of doctors that know

578
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,400
their patients cases right and

579
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,080

580
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,080
people and i've heard from

581
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,360
all kinds of people along the way too

582
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,120
professionals that

583
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,720
tell me well this person yeah they got

584
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,679
some fatigue but it's nothing like this

585
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,600
person who can't

586
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,600
budge and get out of bed so see the

587
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,720
differences but yet the person who's got

588
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,120
fatigue

589
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,720
might might might actually express

590
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,320
that they can't get out of bed but

591
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,760

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,360
right they're out of they're living

593
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,799
their life still you know

594
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,080

595
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,280
probably can't get out of bed there's

596
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,039
moments where they're stuck

597
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,960
but then there's somebody who's really

598
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,679
stuck like really stuck where they get

599
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,240

kitchen

602
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,120
chore they couldn't even imagine being

603
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,440
here and doing this

604
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,159

605
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,760
going to happen

606
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679

607
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,000
who's yeah they got fatigued yes they're

608
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,440

yeah they got some low-grade viral

610
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,080
infections yeah all the things that

611
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
medical medium information is about

612

right

613
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,600
but they're able to actually still take

614
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,280
care of themselves they're able to still

615
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,880
do things they're able still to function

616
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,159
right but

617
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,799
but and you know and that kind of person

618
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,760
might go on this clean diet right and

619
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,039

they're moving and

702
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,400

703
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,919
be any age this happens

704
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,400
and that's when yo

705
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,200
it's make or break all these things

706
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,840
count

707
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,320
every last bit of it all these little

708
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,919
things

709
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,120
matter you're traveling and your luggage

710
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,880
goes through that radiation right

711
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,280
that luggage luggage goes through the

712
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,960
radiation and you're traveling

713
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,960
right you know what i love about live

714
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,159
you know what i love about doing it live

715
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,320
you can actually not put enough water in

716
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,520
a pan because you're too busy

717
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,200
too busy teaching and you lose you lose

718
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,200

719
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,360
got to take them out

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,360
but anyway the point is is when when

721
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,760
we're in that position

722
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,360
right where every little bit counts

723
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,400
you've got your luggage glowing in the

724
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,760
dark because it's going through the

725
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,760
radiation machine

726
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,360

727
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,640
radiation because your luggage is so

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,039
big like this

747
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,200
these are new asparagus they're not the

748
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,960
old asparagus canes you know i'm sure

749
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,279
you guys know your asparagus by now

750
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,799
right

751
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,559
many of you probably already have known

752
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,480
it all your life but

753
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,960
these are the young asparagus right here

754
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,720
the thick ones the thick juicy ones

755
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,080
they're so good for you but listen

756
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,679
here's the other thing doesn't mean

757
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,799
don't do your asparagus right

758
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,360
understand this part right here is that

759
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,440
is that you can do the skinny asparagus

760
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,520
which is an older asparagus meaning the

761
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,559
canes are older the asparagus is older

762
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,840
right

763
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,760
and it's medicinal too there's two forms

764
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,919
of like medicinal when it comes to

765
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,240
asparagus two levels of medicinal

766
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,679
there's

767
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,840
level there's a level of medicinal with

768
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,320
the young asparagus which is juicy like

769
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,200
this

770
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,240
okay there's a level with that and then

771
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,440
there's a level with

772
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:38,000
um and there's a level with

773
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,480
uh the older asparagus which is like

774
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,039
really spindly thin have you guys ever

775
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,840
seen that

776
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,840
it's really thin

777
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,919
so what i'm going to do is chop up a

778
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,600
little onion so we're going to play

779
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,240
onion games as lorraine

780
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
l said

781
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,240
i think couple people were saying it too

782
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,240
which actually made me laugh

783
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,080
someone might think what's medical

784
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,279
medium talking about right now it

785
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:19,200
doesn't sound that interesting

786
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,880
um but this is this means everything

787
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,559
when it comes down to healing just so

788
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,559

818
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,840

821
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,520

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:20,399
caramelize them they can kind of

830
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,399
maybe one onion's all i need for this

831
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,670

859
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,799

860
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,440
so letting you guys know lorraine you're

861
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,399
laughing um

862
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,480
so i like to prep ahead of time on this

863
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,159
dish so i already have my potato steamed

864
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,120
i'll make a big bowl of potatoes put it

865
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,720
in the refrigerator

866
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,399
let it sit in there and as i was telling

867
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,559
everybody earlier i don't put a lid on

868
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,320
it because they get too moist in there

869
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,520
and they start getting a little moisture

870
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,480
built inside of it and they get a little

871
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,399
spongy

872
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,919
so i don't like that i take the lid off

873
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,840
so the lid's not there

874
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,760
and then i keep it in the fridge and i

875
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,279
let them kind of dry out so if i need

876
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,000
them in there for a day

877
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,600
or another day and i need them in there

878
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,200
i have them there and i could use them

879
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,360
for all these purposes that's what i

880
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,360
love

881
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:13,919
um so you know uh

882
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,640
you seem fine to me chris hey talk about

883
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,559
gout

884
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,399
gout's the liver that's the liver that's

885
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,480
when the liver is it

886
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,399
the liver has said i can't handle

887
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,440
protein anymore

888
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,210
or fat the liver's just like i'm done i

889
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,200
can't handle protein or fat anymore

890
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,039
[Music]

891
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,960
and sometimes the liver can get pushed

892
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,760
over the edge for people

893
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,520
and then then the liver gets deficient

894
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,919
like it gets deficiencies

895
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,080
so your liver is now deficient your

896
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,080
liver is your vitamin converter

897
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,120
that's your vitamin and mineral storage

898
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,159
bin right

899
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,600
the liver just holds it all chris thanks

900
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,520
for uh

901
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,200
because i wanted to talk about gout a

902
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,240
couple times and i keep on i keep on

903
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,320
forgetting and i

904
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,320
i want to talk about gout definitely

905
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,360
so when it comes down to the liver

906
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,880
okay if your liver is really

907
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,440
overburdened

908
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,440
really overburdened okay and you're

909
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,640
getting those purines and stuff

910
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,840
and when the i just want to keep an eye

911
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,840
on those

912
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,399
hold on

913
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,600
i don't want to do what i did to the

914
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,440
asparagus with the onions this time

915
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,960
and you know what happens is that when

916
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,320
people are worried about their diet

917
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,440
they're worried about purines and

918
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,080
everything else and

919
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,799
all that's happening i want to talk

920
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,279
about that

921
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,919
what i what i worry about when you have

922
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,799
gout

923
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,399
what i worry about is protein and fat

924
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,039
protein and fat

925
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,279
that's how it goes wrong with gout

926
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,200
that's my concern

927
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,960
and a concern that i've taught doctors

928
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,159
over time it's a very important concern

929
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,279
and um gout is something that

930
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,799
is fixable it can heal it probably one

931
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,799
of the easiest

951
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,000
happens too now you might be somebody

952
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,919
with with

953
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,200
gout and you don't have any of that yet

954
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,480
and you might have a different variety

955
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,799
of gout where it's not like

956
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,399
out in your feet it's not gout in your

957
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,320
toes and ankles

958
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,519
it's gout somewhere else in the body and

959
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,799
the doctor's like i don't know what to

960
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,080
call this thing i'm pretty sure we're

961
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,159
dealing with gout

962
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,760
you know smoky mountain paradise good to

963
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,000
see you

964
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,440
and so the whole thing with gout is

965
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,799
about cleaning up the liver my

966
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,039
number one concern is protein

967
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,840
and fat those are two things that the

968
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,240
liver said

969
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,760
i'm done with i can't handle anymore i

970
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,200
don't want anything to do with it i

971
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,399
can't handle the protein can handle the

972
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,720
fat and that's what the liver does

973
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,600
then you go deficient people with gout

974
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,440
they get all these

975
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,679
mineral deficiencies all these vitamin

976
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,080
nutrient nutrient deficiencies these

977
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,440
phytochemical compound deficiencies

978
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,039
that's what they get

979
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,799
because their liver is like well i can't

980
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,240
process the vitamins anymore i can't

981
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,320
store the vitamins anymore

982
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,320
there's too much fat in here there's too

983
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,200
much desiccated protein stuck

984
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,880
inside the liver everything's gummed up

985
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,760
that the inner works

986
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,159
that the waterworks inside your liver

987
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,480
are

988
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,200
just done you know the liver is not it's

989
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,960
not that you're

990
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,480
in liver failure or anything like that

991
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,880
that's not at all you can have gout your

992
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,279
liver seems okay i've seen people with

993
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,799
gout

994
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,720
don't even have elevated liver enzymes

995
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,080
so if their liver is trashed

996
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,159
because it's not it's not always black

997
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,000
or white black and white it's not always

998
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,320
like that it's not always just

999
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,159
you know it's not it's not two plus two

1000
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,000
equals four when it comes down to that

1001
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,399
so somebody might have

1002
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,679
somebody might have um elevated liver

1003
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,040
enzymes

1004
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,679
with gout someone might not right

1005
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,720
someone might have a bilirubin off the

1006
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,679
chart

1007
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,960
with gout someone might not right so

1008
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,320
these things are really important to

1009
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,159
know but that's that's what i

1010
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,079
always tell people so if you're on a

1011
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,000
vegan plant-based diet

1012
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,440
be careful on how much fat you're eating

1013
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,159
because your gout is going gonna be

1014
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,480
there

1015
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,679
even vegans get gout vegans have gout

1016
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,159
you know it's like

1017
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,440
yeah i know it's amazing how there's a

1018
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,280
whole bunch of vegans and plant-based

1019
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,760
people out there and once they start

1020
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,159
improving with a vegan plant-based diet

1021
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,440
right they're not out of the woods yet

1022
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,879
but they think they're out of the woods

1023
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,159
yet and then they just get sicker later

1024
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,159
because they're doing all these other

1025
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,599
practices they got the fats cranking up

1026
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,200
they're cranking the fats up they got

1027
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,960
other stuff going on and you know they

1028
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:07,200
just get in trouble

1029
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,119
um sarah hazel i thought keto was the

1030
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,920
healthiest diet until i ended up with

1031
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,839
gout

1032
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,119
yo that's what happens the ketos for men

1033
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,480
that aren't sick what's the ketos for

1034
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,960
keto diet

1035
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,240
the old keto diet used to kill people

1036
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,760
did you guys know that

1037
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,839
did you guys know that the old keto diet

1038
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,320
used to kill women

1039
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,640
yeah uh i'm not exaggerating

1040
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,920
i'm straight up i was telling a doctor

1041
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,160
that the other day and he said you know

1042
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,960
what i remember there was this case

1043
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,280
where there was a woman in his practice

1044
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,720
that

1045
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,839
that that left his practice and it was

1046
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,440
years ago and she just

1047
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,520
did this keto thing and she had no

1048
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,280
glucose gold or system go to her

1049
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,800
neurological system had no glucose her

1050
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,839
brain was missing the glucose and she

1051
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,880
was on a keto

1052
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,480
the old keto diet was you you can't have

1053
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,599
a starchy vegetable

1054
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,119
and you can't have a fruit you can't

1055
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,240
have honey you can't have anything the

1056
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,119
old keto diet now

1057
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,599
when women would adhere that when they

1058
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,400
would

1059
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,000
when they would go by that playbook and

1060
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,440
do it perfectly

1061
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,200
no honey no maple syrup no coconut water

1062
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,800
no uh no avocado

1063
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,960
the old keto diet you weren't allowed to

1064
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,599
do the avocados right avocado has sugar

1065
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,400
in it

1066
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,200
see you know they brought the avocado in

1067
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,599
in the newer

1068
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,880
keto diet you see the old old keto diet

1069
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,079
killed a lot of women

1070
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,760
they died they just died they were sick

1071
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,920
no one knew what was wrong with them and

1072
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,280
they died they lost the glucose to their

1073
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,320
brain and they died and they

1074
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,440
ceased they ceased living okay now

1075
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,040
the new keto diet turned into a non-keto

1076
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,000
diet it's not the keto diet anymore they

1077
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,599
use the same name

1078
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,079
keto but there's sugar in it

1079
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,760
everywhere there's sugar in it

1080
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,119
everywhere is the avocados there's nuts

1081
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,880
and seeds there's nut butters there's

1082
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,040
sugar and all that

1083
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,040
right there's fat in there and then the

1084
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,480
new keto diet's got berries in there so

1085
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,000
what happened was medical medium

1086
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,119
information was

1087
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,240
against the old keto diet

1088
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,800
okay and

1089
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,400
medical medium information has healed

1090
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,839
tens of thousands of people over through

1091
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,040
the years tens of thousands before

1092
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,280
publishing the book

1093
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,079
right the books the first book right it

1094
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,880
changed the

1095
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,320
shape of all the diets out there now

1096
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,000
whether they understand that or not

1097
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,720
whether people know that or not

1098
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,599
the keto diet of the old day i i

1099
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,400
forewarned

1100
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,880
women about because it kill it will kill

1101
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,280
you

1102
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,960
you lose your glucose to your brain and

1103
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,000
if you're sick you could die because of

1104
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
that right

1105
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,079
so i'm just caramelizing these onions

1106
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,280
right now which are coming out nice this

1107
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,960
pans really hot

1108
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,280
as we speak um so let me just

1109
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,880
kind of talk a little bit more about

1110
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,880
this this is really an important

1111
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,240
topic it's a part of how things are just

1112
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,599
all screwed up out there

1113
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,760
so now the keto diet see ketosis

1114
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,599
your body would go into ketosis if you

1115
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,960
took sugar away

1116
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,960
right well now the keto diets

1117
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,880
they have sugar in there so you don't go

1118
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,520
into ketosis so why

1119
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,839
is it called the keto diet you you ask

1120
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,760
yourself that

1121
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,000
i ask you to ask yourself that i'll ask

1122
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,800
myself that right now okay

1123
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,200
why do they call it the keto diet when

1124
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,480
you

1125
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,720
can't go into ketosis anymore because

1126
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,960
they have berries in the keto diet

1127
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,079
and they have avocado in the keto diet

1128
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,040
you can't enter

1129
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,400
the ketosis state so why is it called

1130
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,800
the keto diet anymore

1131
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,160
because in alternative medicine there's

1132
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,160
a billion and one screw-ups

1133
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,760
even your simple wholesome keto diet of

1134
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,880
the day

1135
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,760
that's in the magazines that's online is

1136
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,760
screwed up

1137
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,359
and wrong wrong in the sense where they

1138
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,960

1139
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,800

1184
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,359
another minute too

1185
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,800
so these are getting caramelized right

1186
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,040
they're coming out really good i'm about

1187
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,280
to put them in a bowl

1188
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,280
so

1189
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,200
all right and then

1190
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,240
but the keto diet today is not the keto

1191
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,040
is not a keto diet

1192
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,680
what it is it's just a clean diet right

1193
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,800
but

1194
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,800
when you're sick even the keto diet of

1195
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,480
today that has taken medical medium

1196
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,839
information and placed it into it which

1197
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,599
are berries

1198
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,960
no one cared about berries it's 35 years

1199
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,079
of medical medium information going all

1200
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,280

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,880
that's like the next step that was the

1299
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,119
next step above

1300
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,400
what they used to say mcdonald's burger

1301
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,560
king used to say we're the next step

1302
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,640
above mcdonald's we flame broil

1303
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,240
that's what they used to say right and

1304
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,079
then you know

1305
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,760
and then you can go to the next step

1306
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,560
above burger king right

1307
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,680
and now you're at another restaurant and

1308
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,839

1309
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,040
more they're doing more vegetables more

salads right

1311
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,240
so then you're at that place then you're

1312
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,200
at the next level right

1313
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,319
next next restaurant chain that next

1314
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,839
restaurant chain

now they got avocado going in there so

1318
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,079
now they got guacamole in there right

1319
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,599

00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,119
steroids

1359
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,119
that's interesting

1360
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,400
so um so the point of this look the

1361
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,920
point of this live right now we're live

1362
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,680
on youtube we're live on facebook the

1363
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,280
point of this live is to talk about how

1364
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,040
we can avoid

1365
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:16,160
getting stunted getting stuck

1366
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,760
getting pushed back and knowing

1367
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,160
information knowing the knowledge is

1368
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,040
really important right there

1369
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,160
angie wynn says what's your opinion on

1370
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,160
b12 injections

1371
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:34,480
well yeah

1372
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,240
yeah yeah i just got my b12 injection

1373
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,559
uh-huh

1374
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,920
yeah i know i get them once every other

1375
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,559
week

1376
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:47,680
mm-hmm what they use the bad b12

1377
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:49,839
you mean you mean not like intravenous

1378
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,040
like iv you mean the injection like they

1379
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,280
stick a needle in your

1380
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,240
arm to just jam you and your arm or your

1381
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,640
butt

1382
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,640
that's the ones i get right yeah they're

1383
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,720
bad

1384
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:06,880
what why are they bad

1385
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,200
oh your body just your body

1386
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,920
when it comes down to b12 your body

1387
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,520
likes to

1388
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:17,359
receive it orally so your body

1389
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,559
likes to get oral b12 i see

1390
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:22,480
so you don't bypass the liver your whole

1391
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,760
process your digestion process your

1392
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,800
liver

1393
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:30,240
so the b12 has to go

1394
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,640
in your mouth and then find its way

1395
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,800
down to your ilium let me see if i got

1396
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:39,520
an ilium here

1397
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:42,640
uh uh-huh

1398
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,160
so your helium down on the right side

1399
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,920
that's where the small intestinal tract

1400
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,359
connects to the

1401
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,680
large intestinal tract that b12 has to

1402
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,400
find its way down there

1403
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,800
because that's where you produce it and

1404
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,559
then

1405
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,480
that gets driven up into the liver and

1406
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:02,000
then the liver converts it

1407
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:04,079
ah i see i see so when you

1408
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,040
stick b12 in your bloodstream directly

1409
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,400
in the arm

1410
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,720
like this you're not utilizing it

1411
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,720
and then maybe could even build an

1412
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,839
allergic

1413
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,520
allergy to b12 without the doctor ever

1414
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,200
knowing and then there's an allergy to

1415
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,880
b12 i see

1416
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,119
all right i got to look out for that i

1417
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,839
think what i'll do is just focus on the

1418
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,839
b12 drops in my mouth okay bye

1419
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,839
um

1420
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,440
so what i like to do for friends and

1421
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,599
family

1422
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,880
right these are potatoes are actually

1423
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,079
coming out these are coming out like

1424
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,640
hash browns

1425
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:47,280
whoa love that like hashbrowns you guys

1426
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,960
so what i like to do with b12 oh here's

1427
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,599
here it is

1428
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,040
um the liquid b12 right here is the

1429
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,240
adenosil cobalamin

1430
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,240
and methylcobalamin and the b12 shots

1431
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,680
unless you got a doctor that's doing ivs

1432
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,480
that's different going directly into the

1433
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,079
vein

1434
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,760
um um cali says i got terrible allergic

1435
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,520
reaction after b12 shots

1436
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,280
i'm not a fan of b12 shots i've seen too

1437
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,599
many people get allergic reactions

1438
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,400
there's

1439
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,359
there's preservatives in b12 shots

1440
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,920
there's

1441
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,640
also the chance that your body could

1442
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,680
build an

1443
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,040
antibody against the b12 because the b12

1444
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,240
is entering without your body's

1445
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,200
permission

1446
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,240
when you enter it in the mouth or in the

1447
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,000
vein itself

1448
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,359
through intravenous either or right

1449
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,240
mouth is the best i've always

1450
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,240
recommended right

1451
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,319
when you enter it in the mouth you're

1452
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,599
you're giving your body's giving you

1453
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:39,280
permission right when it goes to the

1454
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,800
outside of the body

1455
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,960
and when it's a shot a needle it's going

1456
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,319
against the body's permission

1457
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:51,359
the body might build an antibody to it

1458
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,640
so that you become sensitive to b12 i've

1459
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,359
seen this over and over again

1460
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,319
i taught about this too for years and i

1461
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,400
still can't believe

1462
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,640
it hasn't gotten out there well if i

1463
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,000
keep on getting censored like i am today

1464
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,839
on facebook and youtube

1465
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,359
it's me it's it's a no wonder why it

1466
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,400
doesn't get out there

1467
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,920
um but anyway the b12

1468
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,440
that's the liquid one the venus of

1469
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,839
cobalamin and methyl

1470
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,440
methylcobalamin combined right the

1471
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,599
combination that's the word the liver

1472
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,359
loves the most

1473
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,040
what i recommend i'm not sponsored by

1474
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,720

1475
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,839
my friends and family that's the vimergy

1476
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,640

what about intravenous vitamin c that's

1479
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,160
in your vein

1480
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:40,559
sammy sammy loom that's in your vein

1481
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:42,880
that's not a shot like the b12

1482
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,079
shot right the needle going into the arm

1483
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,280
directly into the muscle in the

1484
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,520
bloodstream

1485
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,680
when it enters into the vein like a lot

1486
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,000
of a lot of practitioners do

1487
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,119
do uh ivc they throw some

1488
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,319
methylcobalamin

1489
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,640
in there they throw uh uh you know

1490
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:02,160
multivitamin they'll do the injection

1491
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:04,960
in your vein right that is different

1492
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,760
your body won't build an antibody

1493
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,760
against it

1494
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,720
these are turning into toasty hash

1495
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,520
browns and they're going to go in my

1496
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,359
potato bowl

1497
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,800
how does look i can't wait to eat this

1498
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,400
i'm going to be i'm going to be shoving

1499
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,520
this down right in between this

1500
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,680
now and tick tock

1501
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,200
and then it's the right kind you can get

1502
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,079
intravenous stuff but is it still

1503
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,920
preservatives

1504
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:27,200
there's intravenous vitamin c that's not

1505
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,599
the good kind of vitamin c

1506
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,440
you have to you have to make sure that's

1507
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,760
not corn derived

1508
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,040
vitamin c intravenously that's something

1509
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,480
to know there

1510
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,040
but getting back to what we were talking

1511
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,839
about earlier 10 steps forward 25 steps

1512
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,000
back

1513
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,760
we got to be careful got to make sure

1514
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,480
your iv

1515
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,960
your ivs through intravenous the vein

1516
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,559
right

1517
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,680
if you're doing nutritional therapies

1518
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,599
through ivs that there's no

1519
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,520
preservatives

1520
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,440
important that one there all on its own

1521
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,480
or the vitamin c is a corn derived

1522
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,480
that's another one too

1523
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:03,760
okay these are actually done

1524
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,920
they're nice and toasty i am gonna put

1525
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,040
these right here

00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,040
see if i can do this right

1527
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:14,640
um so anyway

1528
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,640
all the all this is important

1529
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,119

right

1532
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,240
if i was trying to heal i'd stay away

1533
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,000
from

1534
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,599

sodium bicarbonate right just lost one

1537
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,160
i would stay away from bentonite clay

1538
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,480
i'd stay away from clays

1539
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:43,440
in general okay i would stay away from

1540
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,880
from that i would stay away from zeolite

1541
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,520
i would stay away from alcohol and

1542
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,800

going to take us later into the night

1597
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,880
uh why not zeolites they dehydrate

1598
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,559
they rob you of electrolytes they're not

1599
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,599
the same zeolites uh

1600
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,960
years before they take electrolytes when

1601
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,720
you're sick and you got neurological

1602
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,440
problems it's the last thing you want

1603
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,960
and um there's a lot of zeolite that's

1604
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,559
pushed into the medical medium community

1605
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,160
now they're saying oh you need to have

1606
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,920
that with your medical medium heavy

1607
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,160
metal detox smoothie no you don't

1608
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,000
no you don't the only reason why zeolite

1609
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,599
never gave anybody any benefits no one

1610
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,200
saw benefits with zeolite all these

1611
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,559
years it's been happening for 20 years

1612
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,559
and no one saw that right

1613
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,240
but the heavy metal detox smoothie

1614
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,440
macromedia heavy metal detox movie gave

1615
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,200
people benefits so what

1616
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,200
they do is they try to say well take

1617
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,799
that with your take it too with your

1618
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,319
heavy metal detox smoothie and as people

1619
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,760
get benefits from the heavy metal detox

1620
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,079
smoothie they think it's a zeolite

1621
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,559
because

1622
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,359

pyramid schemers working on it now and

1625
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,680
be like no it's your zeolite that did it

1626
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,760
and they're all like there's just

1627
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,119
everybody's trying to sell a zealot

1628
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,480
i'm not saying that the people are bad

1629
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,920
they're doing it not at all their hearts

1630
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,920
in it they're compassionate

1631
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,280

other stuff and

1633
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,440
i'm just saying that it's not the first

1634
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,839
time people try to hop on the medical

1635
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,599
mean bandwagon and try to push stuff

1636
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:47,040
that medical medium doesn't recommend

00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,880
