[83.68 - 88.40] depression answers they're priceless
[87.12 - 90.64] they're priceless because that's the
[88.40 - 93.28] whole point all those years of people
[90.64 - 94.64] going to doctors but not getting an

[94.64 - 100.08] we need doctors we need doctors and they
[97.76 - 102.48] do a lot of great things but we also
[100.08 - 103.28] have this chronic mystery illness out
[102.48 - 105.76] there
[103.28 - 108.52] and it encompasses like autoimmune in
[105.76 - 110.88] every aspect of that hundreds of
[108.52 - 114.08] diagnoses and symptoms to that
[110.88 - 115.36] autoimmune that diagnosis right so
[114.08 - 118.08] whether it's a thyroid problem or
[115.36 - 120.56] anything else so we need to also have
[118.08 - 122.32] answers and answers are critical because
[120.56 - 124.64] we could see doctors for 10 years we
[122.32 - 126.88] could see doctors for 15 years we could
[124.64 - 129.28] see we can we can just be on that
[126.88 - 131.20] treadmill of doctors and that's fine
[129.28 - 132.48] that's fine of course we've got to see
[131.20 - 133.52] doctors right

[144.56 - 148.96] you don't have an answer
[146.40 - 150.80] here at the doctor's office so since you
[148.96 - 152.80] don't know why i have lupus and you
[150.80 - 154.80] don't know why i have crippling anxiety
[152.80 - 156.80] and you don't know why i have eczema i
[154.80 - 158.80] actually found the answers and guess

[158.80 - 164.00] by following protocols in medical medium
[161.60 - 166.16] cleanse the heal so it's not an insult

[338.88 - 342.80] i've been getting into it
[340.88 - 344.48] i'm excited about that so i got about
[342.80 - 346.08] roughly about two pounds or more
[344.48 - 348.40] potatoes right here so these are steamed
[346.08 - 350.16] potatoes i cut them in half
[348.40 - 352.16] but they're steamed potatoes so i'm
[350.16 - 353.84] going to be stuffing the peppers i want
[352.16 - 355.76] to get them in the oven so we can get
[353.84 - 358.32] down to business
[355.76 - 359.04] that's what i want to do
[358.32 - 361.20] so
[359.04 - 363.68] i'm removing some of the skins not
[361.20 - 365.60] because you're supposed to
[363.68 - 368.32] you can keep them on
[365.60 - 370.40] they're good for you more than good for
[368.32 - 372.88] you i'm just pulling some of the skins
[370.40 - 374.88] off because
[372.88 - 376.80] of the look right
[374.88 - 378.48] it's the look i'm going for in this
[376.80 - 380.08] recipe of course you can keep them on
[378.48 - 380.80] and i'll keep a lot of the skins on
[380.08 - 382.56] right
[380.80 - 385.04] i'll do that but i'm just taking some of
[382.56 - 388.24] the skins back so i'm looking for a
[385.04 - 390.00] special kind of like stuffing look in
[388.24 - 391.84] the middle of the pepper so i'm just
[390.00 - 394.72] taking some of the skins back a little
[391.84 - 396.56] bit i'm not taking them all off right
[394.72 - 399.20] so i'm going through these these are
[396.56 - 400.40] steamed potatoes right here
[399.20 - 402.16] you know i was talking about on the
[400.40 - 403.12] telegram message
[402.16 - 404.80] how
[403.12 - 407.04] i don't know why
[404.80 - 408.80] i have to be the only one
[407.04 - 411.12] to release
[408.80 - 413.84] never before heard information
[411.12 - 415.84] that's life-saving life protecting
[413.84 - 418.24] remember the blood draw problem
[415.84 - 420.08] everybody getting too much blood taken i
[418.24 - 422.96] was the first to bring that information
[420.08 - 424.64] out there reactivated epstein-barr
[422.96 - 426.16] first to bring that information out
[424.64 - 428.16] there so people can know what's wrong
[426.16 - 430.40] with them so they could actually start
[428.16 - 432.24] getting help right
[430.40 - 433.20] long haul covet
[432.24 - 435.60] right
[433.20 - 437.28] uh being reactivated epstein-barr i was
[435.60 - 438.56] the first to put that information out
[437.28 - 440.32] there okay
[438.56 - 441.92] i was the first to put the information
[440.32 - 443.92] out there that you're not creating your
[441.92 - 446.32] illness with your thoughts meaning that
[443.92 - 448.48] that's not why you're sick like you're
[446.32 - 451.20] not just somebody who somehow is
[448.48 - 453.04] imagining your condition and your
[451.20 - 454.24] symptoms because medical medical
[453.04 - 455.52] research and science and both
[454.24 - 457.04] alternative medicine conventional
[455.52 - 458.40] medicine doesn't know why anybody's sick
[457.04 - 461.52] so they came up with a lot of theories
[458.40 - 463.20] and one theory was you're creating it
[461.52 - 464.88] with your mind
[463.20 - 466.64] so you just need to rewire
[464.88 - 468.40] so you're sick with your hashimoto's and
[466.64 - 470.24] your lupus and your multiple sclerosis
[468.40 - 472.24] because you're creating it
[470.24 - 473.84] it's all in your head right the you know
[472.24 - 475.92] alternative medicine
[473.84 - 477.36] all the spiritual medicine right so i
[475.92 - 479.52] was the first to break the news that
[477.36 - 480.56] that's not correct
[479.52 - 482.08] right
[480.56 - 483.92] first to break the news about all the
[482.08 - 485.36] air fresheners
[483.92 - 486.32] all the air fresheners poisoning
[485.36 - 489.04] everybody
[486.32 - 490.80] first to break the news about
[489.04 - 492.88] staying the hell away from dental
[490.80 - 495.12] amalgams that have mercury in them
[492.88 - 497.20] i remember in the in the early 1980s i
[495.12 - 498.80] was shouting it out in the mid-1980s i
[497.20 - 500.96] was shouting at it everywhere and people
[498.80 - 502.80] were just livid
[500.96 - 506.56] angry as
[502.80 - 508.56] bees like you just hit a beehive so when
[506.56 - 510.08] i started out getting out there and
[508.56 - 512.48] lecturing and going on the circuit
[510.08 - 514.64] saying no you can't put the amalgams the
[512.48 - 517.20] mercury amalgams in you can't do that
[514.64 - 520.40] anymore people thought i was like an
[517.20 - 523.44] alien from another planet with 10 heads
[520.40 - 525.04] and i took a lot of for that man
[523.44 - 528.64] that was a tough one
[525.04 - 530.40] so i don't know why i have to be the one
[528.64 - 532.40] to do all this
[530.40 - 535.36] but i guess that's just my
[532.40 - 537.20] curse or burden i could keep it going
[535.36 - 538.56] all day on that why do i have to be the
[537.20 - 540.64] one to let everybody know that
[538.56 - 543.28] chickenpox is not the shingles they're
[540.64 - 545.84] two separate viruses
[543.28 - 549.28] you still see tv commercials if you had
[545.84 - 552.32] the chickenpox you also have the
[549.28 - 554.00] shingles they're the same virus
[552.32 - 556.48] make sure you get the shingles
[554.00 - 557.60] medication from our pharmaceutical
[556.48 - 560.16] company
[557.60 - 562.08] if you had the chickenpox you are going
[560.16 - 563.52] to have the shingles first of all
[562.08 - 564.88] they're two separate viruses and people
[563.52 - 566.40] have both of them
[564.88 - 568.72] they're two separate viruses but why do
[566.40 - 570.32] i have to be the one to to break that to
[568.72 - 571.84] the whole world
[570.32 - 573.44] the best medical clinics the best
[571.84 - 575.36] doctors don't know it
[573.44 - 577.04] i have to be the one to break that out
[575.36 - 578.96] because i'm confused about that when i'm
[577.04 - 580.16] scratching my head about that one
[578.96 - 581.20] all right so i'm just peeling some of
[580.16 - 584.08] these skins back because i'm going to
[581.20 - 586.96] mash these potatoes
[584.08 - 588.72] i could make it a whole episode on how
[586.96 - 590.08] i'm the first to put this out
[588.72 - 591.36] i could make it a whole episode but i
[590.08 - 594.48] don't want to
[591.36 - 597.12] the point is is the essential oil thing
[594.48 - 598.96] has gotten a little out of control so
[597.12 - 600.88] on rumble
[598.96 - 602.48] i'm going to talk about why and get down
[600.88 - 603.84] to the nitty-gritty in the details about

[603.84 - 607.52] people to know
[606.00 - 609.60] more information about it so they

[828.24 - 833.52] lamb than they do spinach
[830.24 - 836.64] right all that misinformation
[833.52 - 837.76] out there about oxilic oxalates and stay
[836.64 - 841.04] away from
[837.76 - 843.60] spinach that's misinformation out there
[841.04 - 846.00] it's funny no one eats spinach they eat
[843.60 - 848.00] lamb more than they eat spinach
[846.00 - 850.16] it's like okay when's the last time you
[848.00 - 853.84] had spinach two years ago when's the
[850.16 - 856.72] last time you had lamb last night

[877.84 - 881.44] gonna stuff the peppers but let me get
[879.76 - 883.36] some chives in here if you guys don't

[883.36 - 889.12] this
[885.28 - 890.24] i have an oxalate video i just got
[889.12 - 893.52] a little
[890.24 - 896.40] tidbit of info i can it's popping up
[893.52 - 898.80] i got an oxalate video
[896.40 - 901.12] on rumble check out the oxalate video on
[898.80 - 902.88] rumble that's an important one also to
[901.12 - 904.32] look at i know a lot of people are in
[902.88 - 906.56] oxalate fear
[904.32 - 908.64] what happens is when someone says hey i
[906.56 - 910.32] want to do a cleanse i want to do say
[908.64 - 911.68] the anti-bug cleanse i want to get my
[910.32 - 913.12] life back and all of a sudden they run
[911.68 - 914.32] into all these walls and be like wait a
[913.12 - 916.32] minute wait a minute wait a minute wait
[914.32 - 918.16] a minute i can eat fruit oh no i have
[916.32 - 921.36] fruit fear
[918.16 - 923.52] oh wait um i can't eat that food uh

[927.52 - 931.44] i'm like dude
[929.04 - 933.12] those aren't these rolls
[931.44 - 936.16] that's just a bunch of made up theory
[933.12 - 938.16] stuff keep you from healing
[936.16 - 939.84] you know why people don't heal
[938.16 - 941.52] from all that kind of stuff all that
[939.84 - 942.16] kind of misinformation there's tons of
[941.52 - 943.44] it
[942.16 - 946.88] out there
[943.44 - 949.28] that's why people don't heal all the way
[946.88 - 951.12] right they don't heal over wet
[949.28 - 952.80] and the people that usually shout out
[951.12 - 955.20] hey you should do this you should do
[952.80 - 957.28] that they never got sick yet when they
[955.20 - 958.80] get sick and they realize oh crap
[957.28 - 960.48] whatever i've been telling everybody
[958.80 - 962.40] ain't gonna get them better because i
[960.48 - 963.84] finally got sick in my life and now i'm
[962.40 - 967.20] doing what i've been telling people to
[963.84 - 967.20] do and i'm getting sicker
[967.68 - 974.32] so i just put some chives in here
[971.44 - 976.16] so i'm mixing up the mixture
[974.32 - 979.20] and now i'm gonna
[976.16 - 979.20] cut up the peppers
[979.60 - 983.92] there we go
[981.28 - 986.32] so this is a mashed potato mixture with
[983.92 - 987.44] paprika if you just got on here
[986.32 - 989.36] garlic
[987.44 - 991.36] onion powder right
[989.36 - 993.36] that's what this is and i'm just getting
[991.36 - 994.80] ready to stuff the pepper so that's the
[993.36 - 997.04] mixture
[994.80 - 998.72] boom we got it those are steamed
[997.04 - 1001.76] potatoes by the way
[998.72 - 1001.76] steamed potatoes
[1002.16 - 1006.00] so what pepper do i want to pick in this
[1004.80 - 1007.92] batch
[1006.00 - 1010.96] i know a lot of you guys
[1007.92 - 1012.96] are afraid of peppers right
[1010.96 - 1016.72] that's an interesting pepper right there
[1012.96 - 1018.48] a lot of you guys are afraid of peppers
[1016.72 - 1020.08] okay
[1018.48 - 1023.08] so i'm taking out the center of the
[1020.08 - 1023.08] pepper
[1024.32 - 1028.00] and then i'm cutting the pepper in half
[1029.52 - 1032.96] all right and i'm going to stuff them
[1030.80 - 1034.48] this way
[1032.96 - 1036.72] that's how i'm going to stuff them like
[1034.48 - 1040.56] that
[1036.72 - 1042.72] but you can do another option too
[1040.56 - 1044.32] you can just take the whole pepper and
[1042.72 - 1046.24] you can stuff it
[1044.32 - 1048.64] in the center if you wanted to that's an
[1046.24 - 1051.64] option right there
[1048.64 - 1051.64] okay
[1055.12 - 1057.36] so
[1057.60 - 1062.80] you can also do it this way too on this
[1059.52 - 1064.96] recipe you can cut it in half
[1062.80 - 1066.48] like that
[1064.96 - 1068.48] right
[1066.48 - 1070.88] you can scoop out
[1068.48 - 1070.88] center
[1071.68 - 1076.32] and now you got a nice boat
[1073.76 - 1078.08] i like that i like that way
[1076.32 - 1079.92] do you do it the way you feel like doing
[1078.08 - 1082.16] though you know you could be really a
[1079.92 - 1083.52] creative person really creative person

[1511.92 - 1514.88] part of the category of the anti-bug
[1513.44 - 1516.32] cleanse i mean how incredible it is if

[1523.52 - 1529.36] all right so but incredible price okay
[1526.68 - 1531.04] dehydrators now when i say dehydrators i
[1529.36 - 1533.36] bet you some of you
[1531.04 - 1535.60] are thinking food dehydrators food
[1533.36 - 1537.52] dehydrators i make crackers i make my
[1535.60 - 1538.96] raw crackers i got to get rid of my food
[1537.52 - 1540.88] dehydrators no
[1538.96 - 1542.40] no keep your food dehydrators if that's
[1540.88 - 1543.52] what you got or want
[1542.40 - 1546.00] right
[1543.52 - 1548.24] no i'm talking about dehydrators to the
[1546.00 - 1551.60] body we're getting rid of one of the
[1548.24 - 1553.60] categories dehydrators to the body the
[1551.60 - 1554.88] caffeine we're getting rid of that we're
[1553.60 - 1556.88] getting rid of caffeine we're getting
[1554.88 - 1559.68] rid of vinegars we're getting rid of
[1556.88 - 1562.24] excess salt we're getting rid of the
[1559.68 - 1564.40] body dehydrators the high fats which
[1562.24 - 1567.20] dehydrate the blood right we're getting
[1564.40 - 1569.84] rid of the dehydrators
[1567.20 - 1571.52] that's important what the dehydrators do
[1569.84 - 1573.92] is they stop you from getting nutrients
[1571.52 - 1576.24] to your brain glucose to your brain
[1573.92 - 1578.40] neurotransmitter chemicals you need to
[1576.24 - 1579.84] your brain complete electrolytes full
[1578.40 - 1581.84] electrolytes
[1579.84 - 1584.80] then we're getting rid of the category
[1581.84 - 1587.36] toxin contributors because now your diet
[1584.80 - 1590.00] is not a toxin contributor think about
[1587.36 - 1592.96] that your diet's not a contributor to
[1590.00 - 1593.76] bringing toxins into your body
[1592.96 - 1595.28] right
[1593.76 - 1596.88] you're keeping the caffeine out which is
[1595.28 - 1598.80] still a toxin too you're keeping that
[1596.88 - 1601.04] one out you're keeping other things out
[1598.80 - 1602.96] too so it's really important you're
[1601.04 - 1605.28] keeping your chocolate out as well when
[1602.96 - 1607.84] you're doing this thing you're taking a
[1605.28 - 1609.28] a chocolate break right
[1607.84 - 1611.68] a chocolate break
[1609.28 - 1613.52] that's important like kathy
[1611.68 - 1615.28] you guys know
[1613.52 - 1617.20] there's a limitation
[1615.28 - 1618.88] right there's a message that hits you
[1617.20 - 1619.84] when you're on your third chocolate bar
[1618.88 - 1620.96] right
[1619.84 - 1623.04] right
[1620.96 - 1625.36] if you're on your third chocolate bar
[1623.04 - 1627.52] you're like oh
[1625.36 - 1629.68] i pushed it too far
[1627.52 - 1630.80] wait a minute here and then it's like
[1629.68 - 1632.64] whoa
[1630.80 - 1634.64] okay let me just do a couple of squares
[1632.64 - 1636.24] i got this dark chocolate bar i got from
[1634.64 - 1638.40] the health food store it's supposed to
[1636.24 - 1640.80] be healthy it's got nothing bad in it
[1638.40 - 1642.24] let me just do a couple of squares a day
[1640.80 - 1644.88] and then a couple more squares a couple
[1642.24 - 1646.16] more squares and you just you just know

[1982.96 - 1989.60] especially with food prices rising this
[1985.52 - 1990.56] is the greatest thing i never thought
[1989.60 - 1992.72] like
[1990.56 - 1994.48] because this this cuts um
[1992.72 - 1995.92] celery costs in half and anything else
[1994.48 - 1997.92] you put it in here cuts it in half
[1995.92 - 2000.16] because it squeezes over the last drop i
[1997.92 - 2002.24] never thought i mean
[2000.16 - 2003.44] with the food cost rising how great it
[2002.24 - 2005.84] would be
[2003.44 - 2008.40] it's just so great
[2005.84 - 2011.68] but it's only this model it's the mm-900
[2008.40 - 2011.68] hds all right
[2013.84 - 2017.08] here we go
[2020.00 - 2024.88] ran some celery through here gonna put
[2022.24 - 2026.80] this down you guys
[2024.88 - 2029.52] don't add anything to your celery juice
[2026.80 - 2031.28] the reason why i like to juice celery
[2029.52 - 2034.16] in front of you guys is it kind of gives
[2031.28 - 2037.04] you a little window into
[2034.16 - 2038.48] how to treat your celery juice don't add
[2037.04 - 2040.48] apple
[2038.48 - 2043.44] don't add lemon
[2040.48 - 2044.72] always strain it don't add water don't
[2043.44 - 2047.04] add ice
[2044.72 - 2048.88] very important tips if you want this
[2047.04 - 2051.04] complete electrolyte to go to the brain
[2048.88 - 2053.36] and actually work if you want this to
[2051.04 - 2055.76] kill off pathogens because this is not
[2053.36 - 2058.00] only anti-bug but this actually helps
[2055.76 - 2059.20] and destroys destroy bugs in in and out
[2058.00 - 2060.88] of the body right
[2059.20 - 2063.60] all through the body very important to
[2060.88 - 2068.08] know so it destroys pathogens viruses
[2063.60 - 2070.64] bacteria so viruses
[2068.08 - 2073.36] and bacteria
[2070.64 - 2075.84] have a membrane okay
[2073.36 - 2078.08] peppers are coming out good
[2075.84 - 2079.52] they have a membrane around them
[2078.08 - 2082.40] that membrane
[2079.52 - 2086.00] around bacteria and viruses is what
[2082.40 - 2088.56] protects the virus and the bacteria
[2086.00 - 2091.44] right makes it hard
[2088.56 - 2094.08] for your immune system to kill
[2091.44 - 2095.68] it makes it hard to die
[2094.08 - 2097.84] so one of the things you're doing with
[2095.68 - 2101.28] the anti-bug cleanse is you're starving
[2097.84 - 2103.68] the bacteria you're starving the virus
[2101.28 - 2105.44] right so your herpes simplex cold sore
[2103.68 - 2108.24] fever blister virus that stays in you
[2105.44 - 2110.00] forever you're starving it now
[2108.24 - 2112.00] all the different bugs we have that
[2110.00 - 2113.04] cause autoimmune we're starving them
[2112.00 - 2114.08] right
[2113.04 - 2115.68] then
[2114.08 - 2117.12] what's cool about the anti-bug cleanse
[2115.68 - 2118.72] and you guys are doing this anyway a lot
[2117.12 - 2120.64] of celery juice
[2118.72 - 2122.56] when you're bringing in the celery juice
[2120.64 - 2124.64] which i'm gonna strain when you're
[2122.56 - 2125.60] bringing in the celery juice
[2124.64 - 2128.24] you're
[2125.60 - 2131.04] breaking down the membrane
[2128.24 - 2133.84] of the bacteria the streptococcus you're
[2131.04 - 2135.76] breaking down the membrane
[2133.84 - 2138.08] of the virus
[2135.76 - 2140.08] so now you're breaking you're stripping
[2138.08 - 2142.40] the membrane down
[2140.08 - 2145.92] so the virus is weakened
[2142.40 - 2148.48] so your immune system can kill it easier
[2145.92 - 2152.48] see how it works so celery juice is
[2148.48 - 2155.52] antiviral antibacterial
[2152.48 - 2156.88] so you're using it as a weapon
[2155.52 - 2161.28] debbie says since i've been on the
[2156.88 - 2164.16] celery juice i no longer need my daily
[2161.28 - 2166.16] metamucil whoa whoa
[2164.16 - 2168.88] that's incredible okay
[2166.16 - 2170.80] that i'm happy about
[2168.88 - 2173.12] because
[2170.80 - 2174.80] it's no fun if you gotta be it it's no
[2173.12 - 2176.56] fun if you've got to be on your daily
[2174.80 - 2178.64] metamucil
[2176.56 - 2181.20] i don't know that's not a fun thing it's
[2178.64 - 2183.04] not like i'm having fun on my metamucil
[2181.20 - 2187.84] this is the funnest thing ever
[2183.04 - 2187.84] no it's it's far from fun right
[2188.16 - 2193.60] okay so
[2189.52 - 2196.40] you want to strain your celery juice
[2193.60 - 2196.40] keep that in mind
[2198.88 - 2204.08] it's a mistake often made simple mistake
[2201.84 - 2205.28] people make it they don't strain it
[2204.08 - 2207.68] that's all
[2205.28 - 2210.72] simple mistake
[2207.68 - 2211.92] got your celery juice right there
[2210.72 - 2213.20] there we go
[2211.92 - 2215.52] incredible
[2213.20 - 2217.52] so what the celery juice does
[2215.52 - 2219.76] is it starts to break down the membrane
[2217.52 - 2222.24] membrane of the bugs so this is the
[2219.76 - 2223.44] anti-bug cleanse that's an anti-bug
[2222.24 - 2227.12] drink
[2223.44 - 2229.28] so what's incredible about the mm-900
[2227.12 - 2230.80] it's dry in here
[2229.28 - 2232.96] it's like dust
[2230.80 - 2234.80] it's dry and this is dry
[2232.96 - 2237.60] so that's why the food costs go down
[2234.80 - 2239.28] with that juicer it's the mm-900 hgs i'm
[2237.60 - 2241.36] mentioning it because i hear people are
[2239.28 - 2243.68] freaking out about food costs
[2241.36 - 2245.92] and they've been asking lately
[2243.68 - 2249.12] so it's it's really nice but just wait
[2245.92 - 2252.96] for it to be on sale so let's go
[2249.12 - 2252.96] let's move along let's take a look
[2253.84 - 2258.96] we are pretty much there i'm gonna take
[2256.56 - 2258.96] them out
[2259.84 - 2262.80] so i'm gonna do that now
[2264.16 - 2270.92] i'm just gonna look for an oven mitt
[2267.60 - 2270.92] real quick
[2271.04 - 2275.32] because i think that would be a good
[2272.32 - 2275.32] thing
[2288.64 - 2292.24] i think an oven mitt would be good
[2293.28 - 2300.08] man let me just do this
[2296.84 - 2302.48] here by holding you guys i gotta move
[2300.08 - 2302.48] piggy

[2362.64 - 2365.60] little parsley because i'm going to
[2363.68 - 2367.68] garnish it with a little bit of parsley
[2365.60 - 2369.36] and some more chives
[2367.68 - 2372.64] so
[2369.36 - 2372.64] got some parsley right here

[2382.08 - 2386.40] little bit

[2404.00 - 2408.16] watching this
[2405.52 - 2411.84] monique says mini hammer
[2408.16 - 2411.84] says she's making them
[2412.72 - 2417.20] monique i read your um comment on
[2415.36 - 2419.84] telegram too i think you left a comment
[2417.20 - 2419.84] on telegram
[2420.64 - 2424.48] all right so i got some parsley chopped
[2422.64 - 2426.08] up
[2424.48 - 2427.68] so what i'm going to do is grab one of
[2426.08 - 2429.92] these peppers
[2427.68 - 2431.92] and bring it on over okay
[2429.92 - 2433.68] so what i'll do is i'll grab this yellow
[2431.92 - 2435.28] one like this
[2433.68 - 2438.08] i will grab
[2435.28 - 2439.76] this red one too
[2438.08 - 2441.20] so i have them here
[2439.76 - 2443.20] if you guys can see that and i'm gonna
[2441.20 - 2445.04] drop a little bit of parsley on there
[2443.20 - 2448.48] just like this i'm gonna put a little
[2445.04 - 2448.48] bit of chive on there too
[2451.44 - 2454.96] just cut up a little bit of chive
[2457.84 - 2460.32] there you go
[2460.64 - 2465.56] i wanted to show you and then i'm gonna
[2462.08 - 2465.56] plate it okay
[2473.68 - 2476.72] so
[2475.36 - 2478.48] i'm putting these two here i'm going to
[2476.72 - 2479.68] plate the rest right now if you guys are
[2478.48 - 2482.24] okay with this
[2479.68 - 2483.28] this is like one of my favorite dishes
[2482.24 - 2484.72] okay
[2483.28 - 2486.64] now i know a lot of people have
[2484.72 - 2488.16] nightshade fear but
[2486.64 - 2489.76] there's no
[2488.16 - 2491.28] oil
[2489.76 - 2493.52] in here
[2491.28 - 2496.48] there's no dairy
[2493.52 - 2498.08] that's what causes a nightshade problem
[2496.48 - 2500.16] it's not the nightshade causing the
[2498.08 - 2502.80] problem it's the dairy the cream the
[2500.16 - 2506.84] milk the butter that's what causes that
[2502.80 - 2506.84] so it's very important to know
[2511.12 - 2515.12] pathogens cause your symptoms
[2514.00 - 2518.76] okay
[2515.12 - 2518.76] peppers are antiviral
[2519.24 - 2523.76] antibacterial
[2520.96 - 2526.40] viruses and pathogens and
[2523.76 - 2528.40] bacteria cause your symptoms so you're
[2526.40 - 2529.84] somebody that's sick and you go and you
[2528.40 - 2532.40] talk to somebody like maybe you should
[2529.84 - 2533.76] stay away from nightshades you just got
[2532.40 - 2538.56] handed
[2533.76 - 2538.56] a one-way ticket down south to sick land
[2539.92 - 2544.32] okay
[2541.68 - 2545.20] this is a one-way ticket
[2544.32 - 2548.00] up
[2545.20 - 2549.52] to healing land okay when someone says
[2548.00 - 2551.28] stay away from those night shades don't
[2549.52 - 2553.84] eat the potato
[2551.28 - 2555.76] they they're just not educated as a
[2553.84 - 2559.52] health professional to know
[2555.76 - 2560.96] the potatoes bad from being fried in oil
[2559.52 - 2562.96] grease
[2560.96 - 2565.92] like people eat them and doused in
[2562.96 - 2567.76] butter cream milk
[2565.92 - 2569.04] and that's why the potatoes bad oh i
[2567.76 - 2570.32] forgot
[2569.04 - 2572.96] cheese
[2570.32 - 2574.32] lots of cheese on potatoes now
[2572.96 - 2576.32] what the health professional doesn't
[2574.32 - 2578.16] know
[2576.32 - 2580.48] is that it's the cheese the milk the
[2578.16 - 2581.44] butter so you're really kind of screwed
[2580.48 - 2582.64] think about it you're out of health
[2581.44 - 2585.60] professionals
[2582.64 - 2587.36] in office you're trying to get help
[2585.60 - 2590.08] and so you're relying on them to be
[2587.36 - 2592.24] smart and like stay away from potato
[2590.08 - 2594.00] stay away from the red bell pepper like
[2592.24 - 2596.80] okay all right
[2594.00 - 2597.52] because they're bad they're a nightshade
[2596.80 - 2602.16] no
[2597.52 - 2602.16] it's the milk cheese butter oil
[2602.72 - 2606.48] it's that the cream
[2605.12 - 2609.20] it's that
[2606.48 - 2611.36] that's giving them their problems
[2609.20 - 2612.96] i've done your 369 cleanse and read your
[2611.36 - 2615.60] cleanse the heel book
[2612.96 - 2618.00] it helped me tremendously eliminated my
[2615.60 - 2620.16] anxiety and eczema and i loved many
[2618.00 - 2624.08] recipes in the book asparagus soup is
[2620.16 - 2626.64] delicious asparagus soup is amazing
[2624.08 - 2628.40] i'm gonna pop on a few more chives
[2626.64 - 2629.84] because i only i really just put on
[2628.40 - 2631.76] parsley so let me just put a few more
[2629.84 - 2635.72] chives on top
[2631.76 - 2635.72] because that's the way i like them
[2636.32 - 2641.44] so the nightshade problem out there was
[2639.12 - 2643.36] a guess it was just another guessing
[2641.44 - 2645.68] game because nobody knows why anybody's
[2643.36 - 2647.76] sick it's just another guessing game
[2645.68 - 2650.48] maybe it's the nightshade sounds so
[2647.76 - 2652.48] spooky nightshades ooh
[2650.48 - 2654.72] maybe that's why you're sick you can put
[2652.48 - 2656.24] a little lemon on here if you want too
[2654.72 - 2658.16] i'm gonna add a little bit lemon a
[2656.24 - 2661.80] little bit of lemon right on the top
[2658.16 - 2661.80] that's what i'm gonna do
[2662.08 - 2666.96] fresh lemon to give it that nice flavor
[2668.24 - 2673.20] that's what i'm gonna do there
[2671.20 - 2674.64] okay and then i might even try to take a
[2673.20 - 2676.80] bite of one of these but this thing is
[2674.64 - 2679.52] gonna be hot let me get rid of the
[2676.80 - 2679.52] pathogens
[2679.76 - 2684.08] okay
[2681.20 - 2685.84] now you can you can cut these in half
[2684.08 - 2687.52] again like cut them in half and have
[2685.84 - 2690.96] smaller wedges
[2687.52 - 2692.88] you can take a bite right
[2690.96 - 2693.84] so if i do this i can go this way too
[2692.88 - 2697.20] i'm just showing you all the different
[2693.84 - 2697.20] ways of eating it okay
[2700.56 - 2705.84] that's insanely good
[2702.88 - 2705.84] that's just insane
[2708.00 - 2712.96] you can cut it in a wedge like this
[2711.84 - 2716.60] okay
[2712.96 - 2716.60] i just cut in a wedge
[2720.88 - 2724.00] all right that's that's good
[2727.84 - 2730.84] yep

[2903.76 - 2906.80] yeah how about pancreatitis you know how
[2905.28 - 2908.08] many people got pancreatitis from doing
[2906.80 - 2909.60] that cleanse
[2908.08 - 2910.72] yeah i watched people come through my
[2909.60 - 2912.64] office said the worst case of
[2910.72 - 2914.24] pancreatitis they could they were sick
[2912.64 - 2916.40] for months they almost lost their
[2914.24 - 2918.72] pancreas
[2916.40 - 2918.72] nope
[2918.88 - 2922.48] that's not a cleanse all that does is
[2920.72 - 2923.76] put your system in shock
[2922.48 - 2926.32] and you can't cleanse with all that
[2923.76 - 2926.32] olive oil
[2926.64 - 2930.32] man
[2927.52 - 2933.20] i wouldn't do that cleanse

[2940.32 - 2945.28] debbie says
[2943.52 - 2947.68] i feel like this only resonates with
[2945.28 - 2950.80] people who have been really sick for
[2947.68 - 2950.80] quite a while seasoned
[2951.36 - 2954.88] that's why medical medium is hated by a
[2953.12 - 2956.08] lot of not so sick people out there
[2954.88 - 2957.92] they're doing all kinds of different
[2956.08 - 2959.28] fancy belief systems out there and they
[2957.92 - 2961.28] just hate the medical medium because
[2959.28 - 2963.36] they've never been sick
[2961.28 - 2965.04] someday if they get sick they they'll
[2963.36 - 2966.72] get a chance to heal
[2965.04 - 2968.16] if they can somehow
