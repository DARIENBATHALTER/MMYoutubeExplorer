00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:40,749
autoimmune condition that's why people

are getting better so fast and rapidly

15
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:45,760
with celery juice it's that powerful I

16
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:48,159
feel more connected I just I can't even

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,019
explain it this whole health journey

18
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,359
that I started a month ago maybe a

19
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:56,829
little bit over a month ago has totally

20
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,809
flipped my world the right way up when

21
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,789
you see people who have gone to 10 or 20

22
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,829
doctors looking for answers and and

23
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:05,260
years are passing in their life and they

24
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,570
don't have that quality of life and yet

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,780
it turns around from celery juice alone

26
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,450
just from this very humble herb celery

27
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,310
celery juice revives liver cells it

28
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,100
helps bring them back it flushes out

29
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,200
toxins flushes out old pharmaceuticals

30
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,480
metals petrochemicals pesticides

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,520
herbicides different toxins that we get

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,500
every day in our life they're inside

33
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,510

decreased my medications like by 50%

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,500
within one year celery juice is one of

54
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,510
those tonics that cleans out the liver

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,520
so you can heal and that's how you lose

56
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,810
weight that's how you heal overall you

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,360

meant to be everybody has a different

63
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,940
story they have different things

64
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,550
happening in their life with celery is

65
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,280
the one thing though that everybody has

66
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,990
that they're doing that's all United and

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,610
combined that's making everybody move

68
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,610
forward regardless of where they are
