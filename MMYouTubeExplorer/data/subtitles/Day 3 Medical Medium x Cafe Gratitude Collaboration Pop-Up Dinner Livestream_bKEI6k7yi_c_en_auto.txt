[645.48 - 650.76] up a little closer yeah could I ask
[648.80 - 652.92] Spirit of compassion one
[650.76 - 655.40] question
[652.92 - 658.48] okay
[655.40 - 660.52] more y my husband did a w drop blood
[658.48 - 663.72] test um and it just has never been
[660.52 - 665.64] working out so I wanted to ask um if the
[663.72 - 667.60] if just the technology would be like the
[665.64 - 669.16] right one to whenever it would be
[667.60 - 671.84] possible to continue with that to
[669.16 - 673.08] continue with it or um does he look at
[671.84 - 675.88] the books does he look at the
[673.08 - 678.64] information he does he read no he does
[675.88 - 681.48] not we there's information in there you
[678.64 - 683.64] have to look at your symptoms the
[681.48 - 686.28] symptoms are important yeah and then you
[683.64 - 688.40] take the sympoms he's doing he um
[686.28 - 692.08] invented a blood test a Wonder blood
[688.40 - 694.52] test like a long time ago and um oh he
[692.08 - 696.68] invented a he invented it yeah so my
[694.52 - 699.20] question was like if the technology that
[696.68 - 701.08] he is using um like it was for Spirit of
[699.20 - 703.48] compassion if the technology that he's
[701.08 - 706.92] using is I'd have to look at it and
[703.48 - 710.44] really see and ask a lot of questions to
[706.92 - 712.88] so like because it's complicated so I
[710.44 - 714.44] would have to ask continual questions so
[712.88 - 716.28] maybe we can someday figure out and take
[714.44 - 721.24] a look at that technology or get you in
[716.28 - 721.24] touch with someone okay okay thank you

[8346.76 - 8350.08] to every customer that comes in the door
[8348.48 - 8351.28] we ask it internally to each other at
[8350.08 - 8353.32] the beginning of our days at the
[8351.28 - 8355.76] beginning of our shifts um for many
[8353.32 - 8356.84] years it was what are you grateful for
[8355.76 - 8358.84] um and that's what it's going to be
[8356.84 - 8360.24] tonight so you might I invite you to
[8358.84 - 8362.24] share with the person next to you what
[8360.24 - 8364.08] you might be grateful for today but we
[8362.24 - 8365.68] do change it every day so and it it's

[10350.88 - 10355.32] doctor said oh you have to keep getting
[10352.96 - 10357.00] surgeries and that's the only way to
[10355.32 - 10360.76] heal it I was like there's got to be
[10357.00 - 10363.28] something more than that right and so
[10360.76 - 10365.96] just to condense a story in like 202s
[10363.28 - 10369.04] basically um I started reading his books

[10369.04 - 10374.00] I was like oh it's viral I said that's
[10371.16 - 10375.28] what it is you know and so I was
[10374.00 - 10376.96] supposed to have like my fourth knee
[10375.28 - 10379.24] surgery like a year and a half ago but
[10376.96 - 10381.72] because of his information the condition
[10379.24 - 10383.68] in my knee you know like it even after
[10381.72 - 10386.12] three knee surgeries like they're like
[10383.68 - 10388.60] it's not spreading anymore right like
[10386.12 - 10390.40] and um so it's he's completely changed

[10458.76 - 10463.80] marinate the pumpkin seeds and soak them
[10461.40 - 10465.96] overnight and then make the tofu and
[10463.80 - 10469.28] then let the tofu set up overnight like
[10465.96 - 10472.28] I mean this is like days of prep you
[10469.28 - 10475.08] know so you used to be a chef I worked
[10472.28 - 10478.16] as a chef for N9 years in South Florida
[10475.08 - 10480.96] yeah so I I really connected with with
[10478.16 - 10483.08] Chef Drew on that and I I have a lot of
[10480.96 - 10485.08] respect for anyone who does this for a
[10483.08 - 10487.20] living it's really a lot of work it's a
[10485.08 - 10489.28] labor of love and to even do like
[10487.20 - 10491.64] healing food like this
[10489.28 - 10494.08] is just it's on another level it's
[10491.64 - 10496.44] incredible and I have to say like when
[10494.08 - 10499.92] you get into medical medium and you
[10496.44 - 10501.96] start cooking without oil and without
[10499.92 - 10503.60] like Butters and all these things it
[10501.96 - 10505.64] completely changes everything it's like
[10503.60 - 10507.72] you have to learn how to cook all over
[10505.64 - 10509.00] again because nothing comes out the same
[10507.72 - 10511.32] when you're not cooking with tons of
[10509.00 - 10514.96] salt and tons of oils and Butters and
[10511.32 - 10519.20] things like that so for this to be this
[10514.96 - 10522.48] good it really is an Testament to
[10519.20 - 10525.08] their skill level really truly talented
[10522.48 - 10528.16] very talented Cooks back there very
[10525.08 - 10531.00] blessed by them and we we ask the angels
[10528.16 - 10533.32] to bless them as well I love that we're
[10531.00 - 10535.28] getting your feedback as a former Chef
[10533.32 - 10537.64] because there is a lot of work that goes
[10535.28 - 10539.40] into this and that Sushi the way that
[10537.64 - 10543.32] it's made and presented like you're
[10539.40 - 10546.72] saying is just I mean it's incredible
[10543.32 - 10548.68] it's really it is a lot of work oh my

[10716.76 - 10722.20] out your food but it's all gone
[10719.48 - 10724.24] last so how was the dining experience
[10722.20 - 10726.16] this evening oh pretty wonderful I've
[10724.24 - 10728.32] been thinking that it's been a long time
[10726.16 - 10730.76] since I've been in a restaurant where we
[10728.32 - 10734.20] could both eat the same thing and I
[10730.76 - 10736.84] could have a full meal is pretty fun and
[10734.20 - 10740.92] so you came together then yes my husband
[10736.84 - 10743.00] oh so I toate you thank you yeah so we
[10740.92 - 10745.64] don't get to sit down in a restaurant
[10743.00 - 10748.20] together almost ever yeah used to do it
[10745.64 - 10749.68] a lot yeah so this is a great treat that
[10748.20 - 10752.72] and that's why when she first heard
[10749.68 - 10755.32] about this she was immediately excited
[10752.72 - 10758.28] because it it's it becomes a restaurant
[10755.32 - 10760.36] where she can quit wearing anything on
[10758.28 - 10762.92] the menu is absolutely fair game you
[10760.36 - 10764.40] know so what a treat that is you know so

[12085.56 - 12088.56] really
[12108.56 - 12114.39] you guys ready for a little
[12111.24 - 12115.96] talk about time
[12114.39 - 12118.96] [Applause]
[12115.96 - 12123.76] right good to see you guys you guys okay
[12118.96 - 12123.76] out there okay thank
[12128.44 - 12133.72] youy
[12130.44 - 12136.92] so you guys one thing that Spirit of
[12133.72 - 12139.64] compassion always tells me is that time
[12136.92 - 12143.16] is one of the things that so much of us
[12139.64 - 12144.20] on planet Earth are stuck worrying about
[12143.16 - 12149.00] it's
[12144.20 - 12153.44] time and seems to have a law over our
[12149.00 - 12156.32] heads every day time for this time for
[12153.44 - 12159.56] that chasing our
[12156.32 - 12163.44] taals time just rules
[12159.56 - 12165.20] everything and the one thing though
[12163.44 - 12166.64] about time that's interesting and I just
[12165.20 - 12169.72] want to start with this is when you
[12166.64 - 12171.52] first get sick do you guys remember the
[12169.72 - 12174.16] first time you got sick the first time
[12171.52 - 12175.68] you got a symptom you remember remember
[12174.16 - 12178.44] what year it
[12175.68 - 12182.76] was maybe what month it
[12178.44 - 12186.32] was some people what day it was it was
[12182.76 - 12189.28] October this you know was this
[12186.32 - 12190.12] day that's how much time means so much
[12189.28 - 12193.68] to
[12190.12 - 12196.04] us that's how much it governs us as well
[12193.68 - 12198.32] we remember things just like when we
[12196.04 - 12199.20] were SI
[12198.32 - 12201.04] and
[12199.20 - 12202.84] then there's something really
[12201.04 - 12205.64] interesting about the medical meme
[12202.84 - 12207.88] information and it really doesn't have
[12205.64 - 12210.20] that law over its head Spirit of
[12207.88 - 12211.96] compassion has always told me that the
[12210.20 - 12215.16] medical medium information because it
[12211.96 - 12217.52] comes from above it doesn't come from me
[12215.16 - 12217.52] it's
[12217.84 - 12221.68] Timeless there's something to say about
[12220.16 - 12223.56] that because there's so many things out
[12221.68 - 12227.12] there like biohacks and Trends and
[12223.56 - 12230.48] everything else it's not timeless
[12227.12 - 12233.20] it screws people up it hurts them it
[12230.48 - 12235.72] throws them in different
[12233.20 - 12239.20] directions but it's not
[12235.72 - 12241.60] Timeless it's not
[12239.20 - 12245.20] Timeless and so the medical medium
[12241.60 - 12247.44] information from above is timeless and
[12245.20 - 12249.08] that brings me to the next thing I
[12247.44 - 12252.32] wanted to tell you
[12249.08 - 12254.28] guys is about our soul are you guys
[12252.32 - 12256.23] ready to talk a little bit about our
[12254.28 - 12261.00] soul
[12256.23 - 12264.00] [Applause]
[12261.00 - 12267.16] so because we're under the law of time
[12264.00 - 12269.92] here on planet Earth and it brings about
[12267.16 - 12272.52] so much stress because it does got to
[12269.92 - 12274.48] get to work on time you got to call
[12272.52 - 12276.08] somebody on time everything has to be on
[12274.48 - 12279.60] time so we're governed by that and it's
[12276.08 - 12282.80] very stressful and difficult but our
[12279.60 - 12286.84] souls it's a different story our souls
[12282.80 - 12289.92] don't really see time the same
[12286.84 - 12293.56] they just don't in fact when we leave
[12289.92 - 12296.80] here someday whether it's 100 years 50
[12293.56 - 12300.08] years whatever it is and we leave here
[12296.80 - 12304.36] our soul is free from time itself and it
[12300.08 - 12306.64] floats through space and time it
[12304.36 - 12308.96] travels from this Earth through the
[12306.64 - 12314.04] solar system it's not governed by any
[12308.96 - 12316.88] time at all and it's free and it lives
[12314.04 - 12320.08] forever I think that a lot of people
[12316.88 - 12323.88] people what holds them back is feeling
[12320.08 - 12326.40] like they're trapped under the law of
[12323.88 - 12329.24] time they don't they don't think that
[12326.40 - 12332.40] they're ever going to have another
[12329.24 - 12335.04] chance but that's not true that's not
[12332.40 - 12336.60] true and I think one part of how we heal
[12335.04 - 12340.96] is to
[12336.60 - 12343.88] know these very laws to understand this
[12340.96 - 12347.92] a little bit it's a big part of healing
[12343.88 - 12349.88] it's critical the angels don't actually
[12347.92 - 12352.92] get governed by time
[12349.88 - 12356.08] either they're not under that rule or
[12352.92 - 12360.56] that law but we can access them anytime
[12356.08 - 12363.20] we want we can they're at our fingertips
[12360.56 - 12365.40] if we need them they're there for us how
[12363.20 - 12368.60] many of you guys are accessing angels
[12365.40 - 12371.20] are any of you guys trying to do
[12368.60 - 12374.84] that are you guys talking angels do you
[12371.20 - 12374.84] talk to angels at night before
[12374.92 - 12380.16] bed it's a powerful connection that
[12377.44 - 12382.68] everybody has the god-given right to do
[12380.16 - 12387.84] is to access the Angels talk to the
[12382.68 - 12391.84] angels use them to help you battle
[12387.84 - 12394.32] time because the angels
[12391.84 - 12397.00] can when we're going through life and
[12394.32 - 12401.20] we're chasing our tails and we're lost
[12397.00 - 12403.48] and confused we have tools that we can
[12401.20 - 12404.84] have access to and we do have access to
[12403.48 - 12407.28] every single day and one is the
[12404.84 - 12408.80] connection to the angels the other is
[12407.28 - 12412.48] understanding that our soul lives
[12408.80 - 12414.88] forever no matter what I think a lot of
[12412.48 - 12417.72] people think that this is the only shot
[12414.88 - 12420.24] you got down here and it's not your only
[12417.72 - 12422.68] shot you live forever all the
[12420.24 - 12427.52] information you gather and Learn and
[12422.68 - 12430.28] Grow from stays in our soul it travels
[12427.52 - 12433.20] far and wide in the future 100 years
[12430.28 - 12435.48] from now it's these very things that can
[12433.20 - 12438.04] give you some peace while you're healing
[12435.48 - 12440.80] your physical body body here now and
[12438.04 - 12442.76] that's critical having peace while
[12440.80 - 12445.28] you're healing how many of you struggled
[12442.76 - 12448.60] with not having the peace while
[12445.28 - 12450.40] healing did you ever have that battle
[12448.60 - 12452.52] you're trying to heal but this is in
[12450.40 - 12454.24] your way you're trying to heal but
[12452.52 - 12456.84] that's in your way you're trying to heal
[12454.24 - 12458.16] but you don't really know how you're up
[12456.84 - 12462.04] against so
[12458.16 - 12464.36] much right so it's critical to get
[12462.04 - 12466.44] moments of peace in our life while we're
[12464.36 - 12469.04] healing
[12466.44 - 12471.20] and we have that it's in our hands we
[12469.04 - 12473.16] can gather that piece and part of it is
[12471.20 - 12474.60] the information that comes above have
[12473.16 - 12477.68] you gotten any piece from the
[12474.60 - 12477.68] information from s
[12482.24 - 12485.84] so I know it feels like this you know
[12484.72 - 12488.28] we're on a
[12485.84 - 12491.68] ship and we're out at
[12488.28 - 12493.04] Sea and we're floating out there and
[12491.68 - 12496.92] floating out
[12493.04 - 12500.84] there and we're on the sea of confusion
[12496.92 - 12504.08] any of you remember the Sea of confusion
[12500.84 - 12505.72] right and that sea of confusion can be a
[12504.08 - 12508.08] long time for a lot of you guys with
[12505.72 - 12509.72] chronic illness how many of you guys
[12508.08 - 12512.16] have been out in that sea before you
[12509.72 - 12514.12] found this information from above you've
[12512.16 - 12515.64] been out there you know what it's like
[12514.12 - 12517.84] to be lost at
[12515.64 - 12521.76] sea it's it's
[12517.84 - 12524.84] real that's real and you find this
[12521.76 - 12527.28] information from above and then you're
[12524.84 - 12530.20] freed from that sea of
[12527.28 - 12534.12] confusion and that's
[12530.20 - 12538.92] powerful keep in mind that your body's
[12534.12 - 12540.72] healing every day I know some of you get
[12538.92 - 12543.32] kind of lost with that and you don't
[12540.72 - 12545.96] think you're healing anymore I know that
[12543.32 - 12549.92] can creep up that's how it works here
[12545.96 - 12552.32] fears creep up concerns creep up and
[12549.92 - 12554.32] then we think we're not healing but your
[12552.32 - 12556.44] body is healing it's healing every
[12554.32 - 12558.96] single day and all you have to do is
[12556.44 - 12561.56] just apply one thing one thing that's
[12558.96 - 12564.44] the information of the medical medium
[12561.56 - 12566.92] information you apply one thing and it's
[12564.44 - 12568.80] life- changing for your body life
[12566.92 - 12570.60] changing for your body just one thing
[12568.80 - 12572.92] just the wild blueberry every single day
[12570.60 - 12575.36] it's one thing right just a celery juice
[12572.92 - 12577.32] it's one thing but just one thing and
[12575.36 - 12581.44] things are changing inside the
[12577.32 - 12584.40] body they are you can find peace in that
[12581.44 - 12587.24] if you do one thing you find peace in
[12584.40 - 12590.24] that if you need to access an angel you
[12587.24 - 12592.24] can find peace in that so I wanted to
[12590.24 - 12594.00] talk a little bit about this because so
[12592.24 - 12595.80] many people struggle with this how many
[12594.00 - 12597.76] people do you know in your life that are
[12595.80 - 12599.92] struggling do you know anybody in your
[12597.76 - 12602.12] life that's struggling and you care
[12599.92 - 12604.80] about them you love them you're worried
[12602.12 - 12607.76] about them and they're struggling
[12604.80 - 12611.16] somebody in your life you know
[12607.76 - 12613.64] somebody right and they're struggling
[12611.16 - 12616.32] with what trying to have peace is that
[12613.64 - 12618.28] what it is peace in their hearts peace
[12616.32 - 12622.68] in their mind peace in their
[12618.28 - 12624.44] head okay and so I want you to know that
[12622.68 - 12626.56] if you need to get this information to
[12624.44 - 12629.52] them and say look you can find peace
[12626.56 - 12631.44] it's there you just need to know your
[12629.52 - 12633.48] body's healing no matter what it will
[12631.44 - 12635.72] heal just give it something and it will
[12633.48 - 12638.36] heal sure it might might take a little
[12635.72 - 12640.84] while for some somebody might take some
[12638.36 - 12644.72] time for some people but it can heal and
[12640.84 - 12647.60] it will heal over time and letting them
[12644.72 - 12649.88] know and the other thing is having the
[12647.60 - 12651.16] faith how many people you know struggle
[12649.88 - 12654.40] with faith do you know anybody that
[12651.16 - 12657.00] struggles with faith you guys you do
[12654.40 - 12658.48] it's a difficult one right there it's a
[12657.00 - 12661.20] difficult one because this world kind of
[12658.48 - 12663.48] sucks it out of you sucks it away from
[12661.20 - 12665.80] you it beats you down and it takes away
[12663.48 - 12667.92] our faith that's what this world is like
[12665.80 - 12671.20] right that's what it
[12667.92 - 12673.68] does but that's okay because we can
[12671.20 - 12675.48] build that back up we can build it up
[12673.68 - 12680.20] and build it up a little bit each day
[12675.48 - 12680.20] and a little bit each day I tell
[12680.40 - 12687.00] people that look for therapies all the
[12684.72 - 12689.12] time they're looking for therapies of
[12687.00 - 12691.36] the mind they're looking for help
[12689.12 - 12696.08] through the mind and they're visiting
[12691.36 - 12697.84] their old old baggage of yester year and
[12696.08 - 12700.16] they're clinging on to it and clinging
[12697.84 - 12702.12] on to it and it's holding them down
[12700.16 - 12704.08] every day how many people have a little
[12702.12 - 12707.84] bit of that you you think something's
[12704.08 - 12707.84] holding you back from the past
[12708.20 - 12714.00] that's something that takes our peace
[12709.68 - 12715.92] away as well and we can cut that line
[12714.00 - 12717.80] that's holding back all that baggage
[12715.92 - 12721.12] that's keeping it attached to us we can
[12717.80 - 12723.96] cut that fishing line we can let it go
[12721.12 - 12726.36] and that's another form of Peace we can
[12723.96 - 12728.12] get and what you'll find out there when
[12726.36 - 12730.44] you really break it break it down and
[12728.12 - 12733.12] you talk to somebody they're missing
[12730.44 - 12735.48] that peace they're missing that Faith
[12733.12 - 12738.16] they're missing something they don't
[12735.48 - 12740.40] have that strength or that belief that
[12738.16 - 12743.04] they can talk to an angel they're not
[12740.40 - 12744.92] sure about any information working it's
[12743.04 - 12747.72] hard to get them to understand say
[12744.92 - 12747.72] medical medium
[12747.92 - 12754.00] information but all this can change but
[12751.20 - 12756.24] you guys have already come this far
[12754.00 - 12758.44] you've already gone through all this you
[12756.24 - 12761.12] beat out the Sea of confusion you got
[12758.44 - 12763.24] away from there you got off that
[12761.12 - 12766.56] ocean you know medical medium
[12763.24 - 12770.00] information is classic and timeless
[12766.56 - 12772.00] it's timeless it is it's here for you
[12770.00 - 12774.24] today it's here for you tomorrow it's
[12772.00 - 12776.64] here for somebody a year from now 10
[12774.24 - 12778.44] years from now a 100 years from now it's
[12776.64 - 12780.92] here for them and it's always going to
[12778.44 - 12783.08] beat out the other stuff out there that
[12780.92 - 12785.84] keeps on recycling all over again and
[12783.08 - 12789.68] all over again because this will always
[12785.84 - 12789.68] be here because it came from
[12790.60 - 12795.96] above and the other thing is being hard
[12793.16 - 12799.32] on yourself too I notice
[12795.96 - 12801.08] that today right here everybody coming
[12799.32 - 12802.48] in a lot of people are hard on
[12801.08 - 12805.08] themselves Spirit of compassion was
[12802.48 - 12807.12] telling me this person's hard on
[12805.08 - 12809.16] themselves this person is hard on
[12807.12 - 12812.08] themselves they think they're a bad
[12809.16 - 12814.48] person they have a lot of fears have a
[12812.08 - 12818.28] lot of worries all these
[12814.48 - 12819.92] things and we don't have to have that
[12818.28 - 12821.84] because you're a good person you didn't
[12819.92 - 12823.44] do anything wrong you're a good person
[12821.84 - 12825.80] you didn't do anything wrong you didn't
[12823.44 - 12827.44] create your illness you're not the
[12825.80 - 12829.00] reason why you got sick you're not the
[12827.44 - 12831.92] reason why you're sick now and still
[12829.00 - 12834.56] struggling you're not it's not your
[12831.92 - 12837.24] fault but we tend to kind of believe
[12834.56 - 12838.36] that somehow and carry that and then
[12837.24 - 12840.60] punish
[12838.36 - 12842.32] ourselves and we have to learn to let
[12840.60 - 12844.12] that go too now I've heard that saying
[12842.32 - 12845.80] let it go and it's really insulting it's
[12844.12 - 12848.28] like just let it go how many times have
[12845.80 - 12849.76] you heard that out there just let it go
[12848.28 - 12853.32] just let it go
[12849.76 - 12855.24] right yeah you can't let something go if
[12853.32 - 12858.48] you don't understand it you can't let
[12855.24 - 12861.68] something go if you just don't have
[12858.48 - 12863.44] another way to do it and one way to do
[12861.68 - 12865.12] it is you didn't create your illness you
[12863.44 - 12866.80] didn't you didn't create your problem
[12865.12 - 12868.88] you're not the reason for it you didn't
[12866.80 - 12870.60] start it you're not a bad person it's
[12868.88 - 12871.64] not your fault you're not faulty you're
[12870.60 - 12874.36] not
[12871.64 - 12877.40] broken that has to be embedded in your
[12874.36 - 12881.20] Consciousness forever in your soul and
[12877.40 - 12883.60] you guys know this and you're doing
[12881.20 - 12885.04] it when I was just sitting over here a
[12883.60 - 12887.20] little bit a couple minutes ago Spirit
[12885.04 - 12890.88] of compassion was saying let them know
[12887.20 - 12893.32] that they are good you are good doesn't
[12890.88 - 12894.96] matter what happened in the past a lot
[12893.32 - 12897.16] of times we beat ourselves up when we
[12894.96 - 12899.44] get sick we beat ourselves up when we
[12897.16 - 12901.88] get chronic illness it just happens
[12899.44 - 12904.04] that's the way the world kind of
[12901.88 - 12906.36] like does its
[12904.04 - 12908.92] thing but you guys don't have to believe
[12906.36 - 12910.24] or think that anymore you're good people

[13039.88 - 13045.88] some serious light
[13041.60 - 13045.88] down this is going to be an incredible
[13049.92 - 13054.80] night I know that when you get sick it's
[13052.20 - 13057.80] hard to be heard it's hard to be
[13054.80 - 13059.44] validated it is when you're somebody
[13057.80 - 13062.44] with chronic sickness or you have a
[13059.44 - 13064.24] symtom it's hard for that to hear that
[13062.44 - 13065.72] validation to get that validation have
[13064.24 - 13067.40] you struggled with that at all we're
[13065.72 - 13071.32] getting that
[13067.40 - 13073.20] validation right right that alone is
[13071.32 - 13075.52] hard to deal with all on its own and
[13073.20 - 13077.72] then being heard that's another thing
[13075.52 - 13079.48] too the light that's coming down
[13077.72 - 13081.60] tonight's a little
[13079.48 - 13083.84] different it's a little different than
[13081.60 - 13085.44] the light that came down yesterday it's
[13083.84 - 13087.60] a little different than the light that
[13085.44 - 13088.60] came down the other day and that's what
[13087.60 - 13090.68] I've been
[13088.60 - 13093.40] told when I was over there on the red
[13090.68 - 13095.88] carpet and I was greeting you
[13093.40 - 13099.76] guys Spirit of compassion was is telling
[13095.88 - 13101.72] me some different things okay there's
[13099.76 - 13105.08] something to do with the way the stars
[13101.72 - 13107.36] are set up tonight something to do with
[13105.08 - 13110.52] where we are in history in the
[13107.36 - 13112.88] moment few things that were coming down
[13110.52 - 13115.44] the information it's pretty
[13112.88 - 13118.64] intense and S so said tonight's a
[13115.44 - 13122.76] different night it's a different
[13118.64 - 13126.40] night and this light blast that's right
[13122.76 - 13126.40] is going to be different
[13126.64 - 13130.16] many of you are going to see it I know
[13128.60 - 13132.88] that many of you saw it for the first
[13130.16 - 13135.48] time yesterday where you saw the
[13132.88 - 13136.72] light you're going to see it again it's
[13135.48 - 13138.96] going to be a little different a little
[13136.72 - 13141.16] intense and your dreams are going to be
[13138.96 - 13144.36] more different than normal which is why
[13141.16 - 13146.72] I brought those up so tonight kind of
[13144.36 - 13148.28] get an idea or keep track of what you're
[13146.72 - 13151.00] dreaming about when you wake up in the
[13148.28 - 13153.44] morning and so forth because your dreams
[13151.00 - 13156.07] are going to be different tonight they
[13153.44 - 13161.56] are
[13156.07 - 13163.08] [Applause]
[13161.56 - 13167.36] let's do a little light blast if you
[13163.08 - 13169.60] guys are ready you guys ready out there
[13167.36 - 13171.96] okay all
[13169.60 - 13175.16] right so where do you want the light to
[13171.96 - 13175.16] hit keep that in
[13175.20 - 13181.20] mind tonight Spirit of compassion was
[13178.36 - 13182.96] telling me that you can split the light
[13181.20 - 13185.00] if you really need to if you want to
[13182.96 - 13187.44] send some of it to somebody else and
[13185.00 - 13190.08] keep some yourself that's how different
[13187.44 - 13190.08] of a night it
[13191.60 - 13195.84] is you can direct all the light to
[13194.00 - 13199.88] somebody if you want but you can also
[13195.84 - 13202.80] like I said split it now I've never
[13199.88 - 13205.16] heard that before from Spirit of
[13202.80 - 13206.64] compassion so it's not like I knew this
[13205.16 - 13208.16] for years and years and years oh you can
[13206.64 - 13210.80] just split the light that's all you can
[13208.16 - 13213.28] split the light this is new for
[13210.80 - 13215.96] me but I'm always surp I still get
[13213.28 - 13217.16] surprises I'm always surprised this is
[13215.96 - 13220.92] how it
[13217.16 - 13223.80] works because it's not coming from me I
[13220.92 - 13223.80] get thrown these
[13225.08 - 13229.28] Louis but splitting the light is what's
[13227.48 - 13231.64] happening tonight if you want to send it
[13229.28 - 13234.64] to somebody else and also keep
[13231.64 - 13235.40] it A lot's coming down and we're able to
[13234.64 - 13238.16] do
[13235.40 - 13239.92] it so where do you want the light to hit
[13238.16 - 13242.32] who do you want it to hit is it somebody
[13239.92 - 13244.44] you love is it somebody that you know is
[13242.32 - 13246.64] it somebody that you care about is it
[13244.44 - 13248.60] somebody that you just want to see
[13246.64 - 13251.44] recover and they need some kind of
[13248.60 - 13255.16] ignition like a starting point some kind
[13251.44 - 13257.72] of moment where it's ignite it it's
[13255.16 - 13259.36] going to ignite inside of us and you can
[13257.72 - 13261.16] send a little to somebody else if you
[13259.36 - 13262.68] choose and you don't have to do that
[13261.16 - 13264.76] either just keep it all for yourself
[13262.68 - 13266.96] it's perfectly fine you'll be glowing
[13264.76 - 13268.96] for quite a while and anybody you touch
[13266.96 - 13271.60] after this point for quite a while is
[13268.96 - 13271.60] going to feel
[13272.76 - 13277.00] it this light's going to come out of the
[13274.96 - 13278.56] pal your hand when you do Touch Somebody
[13277.00 - 13281.32] by the way it's a piece of information
[13278.56 - 13283.04] that's important to know so anybody you
[13281.32 - 13286.12] know and you touch them on top of the
[13283.04 - 13288.68] head it's going to come right out of the
[13286.12 - 13291.00] palm of your hand when you touch the top
[13288.68 - 13291.00] of their
[13292.04 - 13296.32] head think about the Stars everybody
[13294.76 - 13297.68] close your eyes for a moment Close Your
[13296.32 - 13300.04] Eyes For a Moment Close Your Eyes For a
[13297.68 - 13303.36] Moment think about the
[13300.04 - 13306.60] Stars you see the stars doesn't have to
[13303.36 - 13308.60] be perfect but do you see them and then
[13306.60 - 13310.04] think about what's behind those stars
[13308.60 - 13314.00] because that's where the light's coming
[13310.04 - 13314.00] from it's coming from
[13314.80 - 13318.76] there on the count of three take a deep

[13322.16 - 13327.24] breath
[13323.88 - 13327.24] in and then
[13327.44 - 13331.04] release like I said before it's not a
[13329.64 - 13333.00] contest you don't have to hold your
[13331.04 - 13335.28] breath or take the biggest deepest
[13333.00 - 13338.04] breath

[13338.04 - 13341.64] breath
[13339.48 - 13344.80] in and then
[13341.64 - 13348.52] release fantastic we're going to do the
[13344.80 - 13352.92] first one I'm just waiting right now
[13348.52 - 13352.92] for I'm being patient I'm
[13353.40 - 13359.00] waiting right about now okay the first
[13356.72 - 13360.56] one count of three we're going to take a
[13359.00 - 13362.40] deep breath and we're going to hold it
[13360.56 - 13365.52] and then I'll say release okay when we

[14168.76 - 14173.04] speak about the soul tonight if he could
[14170.76 - 14175.48] so I was just so grateful that he was
[14173.04 - 14176.80] able to honor that yeah what was it
[14175.48 - 14178.80] about this event that made you want to
[14176.80 - 14182.68] come here to Cafe Gratitude this
[14178.80 - 14184.44] evening so I've been using the medical
[14182.68 - 14187.48] medium information for 9 and a half
[14184.44 - 14189.84] years now um and I found that
[14187.48 - 14194.16] information in June of
[14189.84 - 14197.68] 2015 um when we were living in LA
[14194.16 - 14199.40] and my mother-in-law was starting a
[14197.68 - 14202.28] decline in her health toward the end of
[14199.40 - 14205.20] her life and
[14202.28 - 14208.48] um she ended up in a care facility just
[14205.20 - 14212.44] about a mile east of here and it was
[14208.48 - 14213.76] very difficult watching her will give up
[14212.44 - 14219.36] as the months went
[14213.76 - 14221.44] on and she lost that will to live um and
[14219.36 - 14225.48] so we were coming to visit her at that
[14221.44 - 14229.08] care facility every few days um toward
[14225.48 - 14231.68] the end of her life and it was so hard
[14229.08 - 14235.28] to watch that and witness it as her life
[14231.68 - 14238.40] force was sort of eing away
[14235.28 - 14240.96] um and so we were trying to implement
[14238.40 - 14243.12] Anthony's information um and we would
[14240.96 - 14244.00] come out of that care facility feeling
[14243.12 - 14247.68] just
[14244.00 - 14251.44] exhausted and hungry and tired and just
[14247.68 - 14254.08] needing a place of comfort and I
[14251.44 - 14256.92] remember finding Cafe Gratitude on the
[14254.08 - 14259.60] phone and it was a plant-based organic
[14256.92 - 14263.56] restaurant and so we would come here and
[14259.60 - 14266.36] this was our refuge during that time um
[14263.56 - 14269.84] and it really became a safe haven for us
[14266.36 - 14272.84] during that difficult um time period and
[14269.84 - 14275.16] she did end up passing um and she wanted
[14272.84 - 14279.00] to be buried in Southern Illinois where
[14275.16 - 14281.64] she was from um so we ended up arranging
[14279.00 - 14284.48] her burial and we did a road trip across
[14281.64 - 14287.36] the country from La um and it turned out
[14284.48 - 14289.72] it's very interesting timing um my
[14287.36 - 14291.76] youngest brother had just moved to
[14289.72 - 14296.08] Kansas
[14291.76 - 14298.28] City and he had moved because he was
[14296.08 - 14300.84] trying to escape a heroin
[14298.28 - 14302.80] addiction and he wanted a fresh start in
[14300.84 - 14305.72] a new
[14302.80 - 14308.64] city and so he had only been there a
[14305.72 - 14311.28] week or two and he was desperate to find
[14308.64 - 14316.60] a job so he could stabilize in Kansas
[14311.28 - 14318.32] City um and keep himself sober so we
[14316.60 - 14319.76] ended up meeting up with him on our road
[14318.32 - 14322.68] trip to go to her
[14319.76 - 14325.12] funeral and I was desperate to find a
[14322.68 - 14328.20] place to eat and Kansas
[14325.12 - 14329.76] City and so I remember we were driving
[14328.20 - 14331.24] into Kansas City I've never been there
[14329.76 - 14334.88] in my life I don't know where to eat
[14331.24 - 14336.80] it's famous for barbecue right and um
[14334.88 - 14339.40] I'm looking at the phone and and I'm
[14336.80 - 14341.92] like you know vegan organic restaurant
[14339.40 - 14344.16] and the first result is Cafe
[14341.92 - 14348.56] Gratitude there's a Cafe Gratitude in
[14344.16 - 14350.72] Kansas City really yeah wow
[14348.56 - 14352.52] so I thought oh my God am I still
[14350.72 - 14354.64] looking at the LA search results right I
[14352.52 - 14356.64] was so confused but it turned out no
[14354.64 - 14359.00] there is indeed a Cafe Gratitude in
[14356.64 - 14363.28] Kansas city
[14359.00 - 14365.96] so we met my brother and we said hey we
[14363.28 - 14367.76] know you don't care about vegan food but
[14365.96 - 14369.72] that's what we want to eat and you know
[14367.76 - 14371.80] we're taking you out to eat so you have
[14369.72 - 14376.12] to eat at this restaurant with us and so
[14371.80 - 14377.96] we took him there um and he loved it it
[14376.12 - 14380.96] absolutely changed something for him the
[14377.96 - 14382.56] approach of Cafe Gratitude and the
[14380.96 - 14385.20] attitude and the treatment of their
[14382.56 - 14387.32] employees and their customer customers
[14385.20 - 14389.00] um so impressed him he had worked in the
[14387.32 - 14391.56] food industry previously and he was so
[14389.00 - 14394.56] impressed that night with Cafe Gratitude
[14391.56 - 14397.84] that he decided to apply for a job and
[14394.56 - 14399.72] he um he he got the job and he ended up
[14397.84 - 14402.28] working at that Cafe Gratitude in Kansas
[14399.72 - 14404.16] City for several years and they helped
[14402.28 - 14406.44] him with his drug
[14404.16 - 14408.20] rehabilitation and um he was able to
[14406.44 - 14410.76] establish himself in Kansas City and
[14408.20 - 14413.28] have that fresh start and go to college
[14410.76 - 14414.88] and um you know start a career and get
[14413.28 - 14418.12] married and
[14414.88 - 14420.08] buy a house and it's just such a mayy
[14418.12 - 14422.44] hug yeah
[14420.08 - 14423.96] oh I know it's been difficult for you to
[14422.44 - 14426.60] tell this story like you felt now was
[14423.96 - 14428.52] the right time yeah it's just um it's
[14426.60 - 14431.36] such a
[14428.52 - 14434.24] beautiful you know the way it's woven
[14431.36 - 14437.32] together medical medium which led me to
[14434.24 - 14439.44] Cafe Gratitude which helped me to make
[14437.32 - 14442.60] this difference in my brother's life

[15031.60 - 15036.56] I love the sushi but I also really like

[15058.72 - 15062.80] really
[15059.52 - 15064.48] radiates yeah and the light blast what

[15068.60 - 15072.24] this was like the first time anyone has
[15070.28 - 15074.08] ever experienced like the ability to
[15072.24 - 15075.36] split the light blast
[15074.08 - 15077.44] and like to be able to share it with
[15075.36 - 15080.00] others and I thought that was really
[15077.44 - 15081.36] really amazing um so yeah and this one
[15080.00 - 15082.48] he said is different from the other one
[15081.36 - 15084.44] so I'm actually really looking forward
[15082.48 - 15085.88] to seeing like any noticeable benefits
[15084.44 - 15088.56] cuz I have benefited from the previous
[15085.88 - 15090.04] light blasts oh wow so in what ways do
[15088.56 - 15092.96] you feel you benefited from those other
[15090.04 - 15095.52] light Bloss um so I've been doing
[15092.96 - 15097.44] medical medium protocol since 2018 and
[15095.52 - 15099.36] I've I've done really really I've had
[15097.44 - 15101.52] really wonderful progress but my most
[15099.36 - 15104.32] lingering symptoms were like PTSD
[15101.52 - 15105.92] related and there is a PTSD protocol
[15104.32 - 15109.68] that I was working on before I got
[15105.92 - 15112.64] pregnant and um I really felt like this
[15109.68 - 15115.00] last event the Calabasas event um that
[15112.64 - 15117.52] one really held my PTSD with driving
[15115.00 - 15119.28] I've had like um previous episodes where
[15117.52 - 15120.48] when I was really sick I almost fainted
[15119.28 - 15123.16] at the wheel and that was really
[15120.48 - 15126.28] traumatic for me and I since then I've
[15123.16 - 15127.68] been like afraid to drive um on highways
[15126.28 - 15130.56] and I still do but it's like really
[15127.68 - 15133.32] stressful for me and um ever since that
[15130.56 - 15135.20] event I don't have that anymore and it's
[15133.32 - 15137.76] the only thing that I can attribute to
[15135.20 - 15139.36] that change and it's been really amazing
[15137.76 - 15141.20] wow that's incredible so let's take it
[15139.36 - 15142.24] back a little bit to when you first
[15141.20 - 15144.64] discovered the medical medium
[15142.24 - 15145.72] information how that came about and what
[15144.64 - 15147.44] symptoms you were going through and
[15145.72 - 15148.40] you're talking about the PTSD but a
[15147.44 - 15150.72] little bit about the other things you
[15148.40 - 15153.72] were dealing with as well yeah so my
[15150.72 - 15156.00] story is pretty long but um that's okay
[15153.72 - 15158.04] so I'm I'm 34 now and I got sick when I
[15156.00 - 15160.08] was like 22 23 I ended up getting food
[15158.04 - 15161.24] poisoning and I was working as an ICU
[15160.08 - 15162.64] nurse at the time I ended up getting
[15161.24 - 15163.68] food poisoning from the hospital
[15162.64 - 15165.72] cafeteria
[15163.68 - 15167.80] and that ended up triggering my chronic
[15165.72 - 15170.76] illness and I started developing
[15167.80 - 15173.40] neurological symptoms chronic fatigue um
[15170.76 - 15175.92] fainting digestive issues
[15173.40 - 15177.68] eccema um like vertigo a lot of
[15175.92 - 15179.76] neurological symptoms and eventually got
[15177.68 - 15182.32] to the point where I became bed bound
[15179.76 - 15183.76] and then I I was sick for about six
[15182.32 - 15184.96] years before I found medical medium
[15183.76 - 15186.12] information I was going through all
[15184.96 - 15187.32] these different I was trying
[15186.12 - 15188.96] conventional medicine functional
[15187.32 - 15191.20] medicine all these alternative remedies
[15188.96 - 15193.40] and then in 2018 I found medical medium
[15191.20 - 15198.28] information and then 6 months later I
[15193.40 - 15199.60] was medication free and um yeah wow yeah
[15198.28 - 15201.20] it's been incredible obviously my my
[15199.60 - 15202.40] journey I will say has not been linear
[15201.20 - 15204.72] I've had lots of ups and downs and
[15202.40 - 15205.84] setbacks and things like that but um my
[15204.72 - 15207.28] health has been very good the last
[15205.84 - 15209.36] several years thanks to Medical medium
[15207.28 - 15211.36] information and I'm just eternally
[15209.36 - 15213.40] grateful wow that's incredible so you
[15211.36 - 15215.28] say the food poisoning kind of started
[15213.40 - 15217.36] this that was my trigger okay yes your
[15215.28 - 15218.80] trigger um what were some of those
[15217.36 - 15220.84] symptoms and conditions you were dealing
[15218.80 - 15222.56] with after that that the medical medium
[15220.84 - 15224.64] helped you improve if you wouldn't mind
[15222.56 - 15227.20] talking bit more in detail about those
[15224.64 - 15229.92] yeah so you know I I had a lot of like
[15227.20 - 15231.40] hormone imbalances and adrenal issues I
[15229.92 - 15233.40] I struggled with a lot of chronic
[15231.40 - 15236.56] fatigue there were months u i was
[15233.40 - 15238.72] bedbound for months at a time um I
[15236.56 - 15241.28] couldn't stand up without feeling light
[15238.72 - 15243.16] headed or weak I couldn't really shower
[15241.28 - 15246.40] I you know I just I had difficulty
[15243.16 - 15249.08] swallowing I had food sensitivities and
[15246.40 - 15251.76] I mean I I I've had like over 50
[15249.08 - 15253.16] symptoms so oh go I think those symptoms
[15251.76 - 15255.88] now that you've been on the protocol for
[15253.16 - 15257.64] sometime are you symptom free are you
[15255.88 - 15260.16] still working towards it have a lot of
[15257.64 - 15262.12] them lifted um most of them are gone
[15260.16 - 15263.04] thank god um I think the most lingering
[15262.12 - 15266.00] was the
[15263.04 - 15267.76] PTSD um but yeah I thankfully my health
[15266.00 - 15270.16] has been very good the last few years so

[15346.68 - 15352.40] on telegram but he leaves these really
[15349.72 - 15354.08] um beautiful messages and the most one
[15352.40 - 15356.48] that really stuck with me is he talked
[15354.08 - 15358.36] about how when we're really really sick
[15356.48 - 15361.92] it can feel like we're like completely
[15358.36 - 15363.20] missing out on life and um like we're
[15361.92 - 15365.20] just like have this like fear of missing
[15363.20 - 15366.24] out like everyone's else's lives are
[15365.20 - 15367.56] like moving forward and you're just
[15366.24 - 15370.76] stuck at home and you're really sick and
[15367.56 - 15373.56] you're really miserable but he said that
[15370.76 - 15375.32] um when you come out of chronic illness
[15373.56 - 15377.80] you will be so much more
[15375.32 - 15380.36] productive um than you ever could have
[15377.80 - 15381.84] been before you ever got sick and I just
[15380.36 - 15383.68] remember feeling that way when I was
[15381.84 - 15385.40] really sick I just remember like think I
[15383.68 - 15386.60] was sick through all my 20s I just
[15385.40 - 15387.92] remember like thinking like all my
[15386.60 - 15389.80] friends are like getting married and
[15387.92 - 15391.80] having kids and like doing all these
[15389.80 - 15394.48] different things and I really felt
[15391.80 - 15395.84] really limited and um you know since
[15394.48 - 15397.84] I've come out of chronic illness I've
[15395.84 - 15399.40] like started my own practice and I got
[15397.84 - 15403.24] married and now I'm having my first
[15399.40 - 15405.16] child and it's just um I just if you're
[15403.24 - 15407.08] feeling that way and you're feeling like
