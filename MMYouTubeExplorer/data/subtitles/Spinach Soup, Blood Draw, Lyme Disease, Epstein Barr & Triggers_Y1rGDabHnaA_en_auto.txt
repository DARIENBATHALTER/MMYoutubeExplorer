[182.80 - 186.64] record established
[184.56 - 188.00] of the power of healing this book has

[188.00 - 191.60] people from around the world who've
[190.24 - 193.60] tried everything
[191.60 - 196.40] medical research and science had to
[193.60 - 197.84] offer have found this information to be
[196.40 - 200.32] a sanctuary
[197.84 - 202.40] they found that it has allowed them to
[200.32 - 204.80] rise out of the ashes
[202.40 - 207.20] and when this book came out okay the
[204.80 - 209.12] first edition
[207.20 - 211.04] there was very little information out
[209.12 - 212.00] there for the chronicle for anybody with
[211.04 - 214.72] fibro anybody
[212.00 - 217.20] with chronic fatigue lyme disease gut
[214.72 - 219.84] problems
[217.20 - 222.16] there was really very little information
[219.84 - 223.20] out there this was that sanctuary that
[222.16 - 225.36] came out right
[223.20 - 227.52] and the new edition is packed with more
[225.36 - 230.72] information so you don't want to
[227.52 - 231.92] miss out on this but when this book came
[230.72 - 235.52] out
[231.92 - 237.68] it exploded the truth about
[235.52 - 239.36] the epstein-barr virus and what it
[237.68 - 241.16] causes so if you're somebody dealing
[239.36 - 243.40] with hashimoto's thyroiditis
[241.16 - 245.84] hyperthyroidism graves
[243.40 - 247.28] hypothyroidism that's epstein-barr that
[245.84 - 247.76] causes it if you're somebody dealing
[247.28 - 250.00] with
[247.76 - 252.08] rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia
[250.00 - 255.28] chronic fatigue syndrome amne or
[252.08 - 256.24] cfs or plain old cfs or however you're
[255.28 - 258.72] feeling
[256.24 - 260.72] that's the epstein-barr virus and that's
[258.72 - 263.84] just some things right there and
[260.72 - 266.72] so i broke the truth about epstein-barr
[263.84 - 268.48] out there and it has saved millions of
[266.72 - 271.04] lives around the world
[268.48 - 271.92] it's the most popular book series in
[271.04 - 275.20] health
[271.92 - 275.60] globally for going on close seven years
[275.20 - 277.92] now
[275.60 - 279.68] and this book right here broke the truth
[277.92 - 280.16] about epstein-barr and why does that
[279.68 - 282.24] matter
[280.16 - 283.92] like who cares you know who cares about
[282.24 - 284.96] breaking the truth about epstein-barr
[283.92 - 287.84] out there like
[284.96 - 288.72] why should it even matter because
[287.84 - 292.72] because it gave
[288.72 - 295.20] people the answers of why they were sick
[292.72 - 296.16] that didn't exist before the mm
[295.20 - 299.36] information
[296.16 - 303.28] everybody was on the merry-go-round and
[299.36 - 306.64] chasing phantom ghosts for answers like
[303.28 - 308.56] chasing theories and chasing all that
[306.64 - 310.80] guessing games everybody was running
[308.56 - 312.56] around the musical chairs
[310.80 - 314.40] and so millions of women around the
[312.56 - 315.68] world and they're still doing it that
[314.40 - 316.56] don't know the medical medium
[315.68 - 318.16] information
[316.56 - 320.16] they're doing the musical chair route
[318.16 - 322.08] where they're like okay this doctor here
[320.16 - 322.56] and then this neurologist here or what's
[322.08 - 325.20] my
[322.56 - 326.16] ringing in my ears and my dizziness and
[325.20 - 328.64] my body pain
[326.16 - 329.76] and my burning skin and and my tics and
[328.64 - 332.16] spasms and
[329.76 - 333.12] and that's just a few things and nobody
[332.16 - 336.24] knew like
[333.12 - 339.04] what was the cause what what's going on
[336.24 - 340.00] why do i have a problem with my thyroid
[339.04 - 342.16] and
[340.00 - 343.60] and all that sherry says couldn't put
[342.16 - 345.68] the first edition down
[343.60 - 347.36] when i first read it i'm sure this will
[345.68 - 350.88] blow minds and hearts
[347.36 - 353.60] of all that receive it it sherry this is
[350.88 - 354.64] you know i'll tell you dr sherry green
[353.60 - 357.12] thank you for being here
[354.64 - 358.56] this is amazing this book is really
[357.12 - 360.88] really special
[358.56 - 362.32] and you know before the truth came out
[360.88 - 364.24] about epstein-barr everybody
[362.32 - 365.60] thought epstein-barr was the kissing
[364.24 - 368.48] disease where
[365.60 - 370.08] you caught mono and then it went away
[368.48 - 372.32] and then it was gone
[370.08 - 373.44] never to come back again never to cause
[372.32 - 376.80] a problem
[373.44 - 377.52] it it and that's what best of science
[376.80 - 379.84] thought
[377.52 - 381.36] all the doctors thought that science of
[379.84 - 384.24] research thought that
[381.36 - 384.96] they just thought that you caught mono
[384.24 - 387.36] and then
[384.96 - 388.72] it disappeared and you were better and
[387.36 - 390.32] you would never have to worry about
[388.72 - 393.40] anything ever again
[390.32 - 395.36] the whole reason anybody's talking about
[393.40 - 397.44] reactivation of epstein-barr
[395.36 - 398.88] right now today is because of the
[397.44 - 401.84] original book here
[398.88 - 402.64] and that's how incredible that is so now
[401.84 - 405.68] out there
[402.64 - 407.12] you'll hear out there reactivation of
[405.68 - 410.16] epstein-barr
[407.12 - 413.84] and you'll hear that and that's from
[410.16 - 415.92] this book no one in science or research
[413.84 - 417.04] no one anywhere no doctors knew
[415.92 - 420.24] epstein-barr
[417.04 - 424.56] caused an aftermath problems
[420.24 - 427.60] later on which lead to lyme disease
[424.56 - 431.68] so this book brought that truth
[427.60 - 433.84] to light and the thing is
[431.68 - 435.12] is that epstein-barr causes symptoms
[433.84 - 437.12] later on
[435.12 - 438.24] so you get your mono whether you know
[437.12 - 440.80] it's mono or not
[438.24 - 442.24] or if it was diagnosed of mono or not
[440.80 - 445.28] you get it
[442.24 - 447.60] it goes away and then it comes
[445.28 - 448.56] back on a rainy day and it comes back
[447.60 - 450.16] with some vertigo
[448.56 - 451.92] some dizziness some focus and
[450.16 - 452.96] concentration issues a little bit of
[451.92 - 455.92] anxiety
[452.96 - 456.40] sometimes some depression migraines it
[455.92 - 458.64] comes
[456.40 - 459.76] back with all these different conditions
[458.64 - 462.16] and symptoms
[459.76 - 463.84] and everybody then goes looking for
[462.16 - 465.20] answers and they're spending thousands
[463.84 - 467.60] of dollars and they go to
[465.20 - 468.32] alternative doctors of all kinds right
[467.60 - 470.64] and they go to
[468.32 - 472.08] every kind there is and they look for
[470.64 - 475.04] answers and they don't find
[472.08 - 476.32] them this book has changed the world
[475.04 - 479.04] with this and it's so
[476.32 - 480.64] it's so special science of research just
[479.04 - 483.44] started talking about
[480.64 - 484.88] epstein-barr now being linked to
[483.44 - 487.44] hashimoto's
[484.88 - 489.52] ra and fibromyalgia and lyme disease and
[487.44 - 490.24] that's because science research follows
[489.52 - 493.28] the lead
[490.24 - 495.04] of the medical medium books so
[493.28 - 497.20] i love when i hear out there someone say
[495.04 - 498.64] where's your scientific evidence
[497.20 - 500.96] well that's funny because science
[498.64 - 503.44] research they take the medical medium
[500.96 - 505.12] information and they use it later so i'm
[503.44 - 506.08] the source for science research and
[505.12 - 507.92] chronic illness
[506.08 - 509.76] it's the medical medium books and that's
[507.92 - 512.80] where they get their information
[509.76 - 513.44] so i am the source for science and
[512.80 - 515.36] research
[513.44 - 517.28] include that involves lyme disease
[515.36 - 518.72] science research for hashimoto's science
[517.28 - 520.80] research for fibro
[518.72 - 522.40] for all these things because it stems
[520.80 - 524.00] from the original publication of the
[522.40 - 524.72] medical medium book which was published
[524.00 - 526.24] before
[524.72 - 527.92] medical research and science even
[526.24 - 529.52] started spouting out that fc bar has
[527.92 - 532.00] anything to do with anything
[529.52 - 533.44] so it's really exciting so you guys the
[532.00 - 535.68] book is packed
[533.44 - 536.96] it's a thick book it's a heavy book for
[535.68 - 538.88] a reason
[536.96 - 540.48] get ready to get mind blown when you get
[538.88 - 541.60] into this book i'm going to talk about a
[540.48 - 543.20] little bit about it i'm going to talk
[541.60 - 545.20] about triggers today
[543.20 - 546.80] so i know you guys are up against
[545.20 - 548.40] triggers
[546.80 - 550.88] and i do want to talk about triggers to
[548.40 - 551.60] lyme disease triggers to other things
[550.88 - 555.36] too
[551.60 - 557.44] um other conditions and in this book
[555.36 - 559.76] i talk about the plague we're up against
[557.44 - 561.36] right now of why everybody's in lockdown
[559.76 - 563.60] where everybody's going around with
[561.36 - 565.60] masks on i talk about
[563.60 - 567.52] that plague in the medical medium book
[565.60 - 570.64] which is really cool
[567.52 - 572.56] it's got way more information than even
[570.64 - 575.28] cleanse to heal for specific
[572.56 - 577.28] conditions for specific conditions so
[575.28 - 580.80] this book is that pact
[577.28 - 581.84] um and look i i can't cover what's in
[580.80 - 583.76] this book
[581.84 - 584.88] in one moment right here it's not
[583.76 - 586.56] possible it's
[584.88 - 588.24] that there's that much but i'm gonna
[586.56 - 589.52] make the spinach soup i'm gonna talk
[588.24 - 591.84] about lyme disease i'm going to talk
[589.52 - 593.68] about triggers to chronic illness
[591.84 - 594.88] this is going to be interesting i'm glad
[593.68 - 598.40] you guys are on there

[609.04 - 611.84] tool i'm gonna start making a little bit
[611.28 - 613.20] of it just
[611.84 - 615.52] start giving you some at least the
[613.20 - 616.88] ingredient ingredient so forth and how
[615.52 - 618.48] it works i'm gonna put the book down for
[616.88 - 621.84] a second
[618.48 - 622.40] and um you know you guys the more and
[621.84 - 624.48] more

[625.60 - 629.84] um causing people to stay sick it's just
[628.24 - 632.40] so disheartening i mean i can't believe
[629.84 - 634.56] people are still talking about colostrum
[632.40 - 637.20] they still think collagen is helpful i
[634.56 - 639.52] mean these are things that are not
[637.20 - 639.52] um
[640.32 - 645.12] donna says i didn't know i was infected
[642.32 - 648.24] by ebv before i read the book
[645.12 - 651.12] then i did a lab for ebv
[648.24 - 652.24] and igg yep and found that i had lots of
[651.12 - 654.64] antibodies
[652.24 - 655.36] i have graves and all the doctors told
[654.64 - 657.68] me that
[655.36 - 659.44] my autoimmune disease was caused by my
[657.68 - 660.88] immune system going crazy and
[659.44 - 662.88] donna what happens is that's what they
[660.88 - 664.64] do they'll they'll blame it on your body
[662.88 - 665.84] attacking itself they'll say that your
[664.64 - 668.96] immune system is
[665.84 - 670.64] attacking the organs and the the amazing
[668.96 - 672.40] thing about this book is
[670.64 - 674.08] i release the truth that that's not
[672.40 - 677.20] accurate that the body
[674.08 - 678.72] does not go against itself because the
[677.20 - 679.92] minute you take that into your
[678.72 - 682.96] consciousness
[679.92 - 685.92] the minute it's all blamed on
[682.96 - 686.72] you and your body it can go even more
[685.92 - 688.32] wrong because
[686.72 - 690.64] all of a sudden you're sick why am i
[688.32 - 693.44] sick why do i have a condition
[690.64 - 695.20] and now you get told by medical research
[693.44 - 697.92] and science that tells doctors
[695.20 - 699.36] that your immune system went haywire and
[697.92 - 702.64] it's attacking your
[699.36 - 704.16] organs and your glands and
[702.64 - 705.76] that's not accurate that's not what
[704.16 - 708.00] happens instead
[705.76 - 710.08] it's about the epstein-barr virus that's
[708.00 - 711.84] causing the inflammation
[710.08 - 713.36] and your immune system's protecting you
[711.84 - 715.04] and not causing a problem at all
[713.36 - 716.56] it's there to protect you it's there to
[715.04 - 719.60] look out for you
[716.56 - 721.76] and this is this is the
[719.60 - 723.44] the problems that happen out there where
[721.76 - 725.36] people just they're
[723.44 - 727.12] they get told that their body's
[725.36 - 728.56] destroying itself they get told that
[727.12 - 731.36] their bodies against them
[728.56 - 732.32] and that's really disheartening very
[731.36 - 734.40] damaging
[732.32 - 736.08] doesn't allow the body to heal doesn't
[734.40 - 737.84] allow us to move forward
[736.08 - 739.60] doesn't allow us to get past their
[737.84 - 740.32] illnesses because once we consciously
[739.60 - 743.20] take that in
[740.32 - 743.76] it's like wow my body's killing itself
[743.20 - 746.40] hey
[743.76 - 747.76] my body's hurting itself so there's no
[746.40 - 750.40] way to fix this
[747.76 - 751.28] uh what's the other answer it's genes
[750.40 - 754.56] and
[751.28 - 756.56] or maybe i'm thinking myself sick maybe
[754.56 - 758.00] i'm creating it so that's the next thing
[756.56 - 761.04] that occurs that's all wrong
[758.00 - 762.40] right and your body is so beyond
[761.04 - 765.44] intelligent
[762.40 - 766.16] your body is that unconditionally loves
[765.44 - 768.72] you
[766.16 - 769.92] your body knows what's going on your
[768.72 - 772.32] body doesn't attack
[769.92 - 773.28] itself there's a real problem to why
[772.32 - 775.92] we're sick
[773.28 - 777.84] and that information i released in
[775.92 - 779.20] medical medium book one to start with
[777.84 - 781.52] years ago this is the new addition if
[779.20 - 783.84] you guys just came on it just came out
[781.52 - 786.16] i mean it's out in probably i don't know
[783.84 - 788.32] four or five days or six days now so
[786.16 - 791.36] it's the amazon.com has it
[788.32 - 793.68] um barnes noble has it but i got my copy
[791.36 - 795.68] i just got my copy all right and you
[793.68 - 797.44] know i think i saw somebody online that
[795.68 - 799.44] had a copy or an early copy they must
[797.44 - 802.08] have got it from their local bookstore
[799.44 - 804.72] and they had a copy before i did which
[802.08 - 806.64] was really funny i laughed so hard
[804.72 - 808.88] and um it's like i don't even have a
[806.64 - 810.80] copy and they had a copy first
[808.88 - 812.16] and uh that was so great to see that
[810.80 - 814.00] that made me so happy
[812.16 - 817.28] so anyway you guys um you go to your
[814.00 - 820.88] local bookstore too okay
[817.28 - 824.16] so educating myself good to see you
[820.88 - 825.44] the tattoo truth bomb was awesome
[824.16 - 827.04] you know you guys that you want to say
[825.44 - 827.76] this one thing about that the tattoo
[827.04 - 831.44] thing
[827.76 - 834.40] in order for the ink to actually show up
[831.44 - 835.44] and pop like show up and make a good
[834.40 - 837.28] tattoo
[835.44 - 839.12] all right they have to put toxic heavy
[837.28 - 841.28] metals inside the ink
[839.12 - 842.96] all right so wherever the ink is if you
[841.28 - 844.24] want to get that scripture on the side
[842.96 - 846.16] of your ribs or
[844.24 - 847.52] wherever you get your ink you want to
[846.16 - 848.96] get the butterflies on your ankles
[847.52 - 851.28] whatever you're doing
[848.96 - 853.52] wherever that ink is it has to be filled
[851.28 - 856.08] with toxic heavy metals in order to
[853.52 - 858.00] reflect light to come through the skin
[856.08 - 859.04] so you can see it really well so that's
[858.00 - 862.16] how it's done
[859.04 - 862.80] so the light shines on the tattoo the
[862.16 - 864.72] ink
[862.80 - 866.00] underneath the skin reflects off the
[864.72 - 868.16] toxic heavy metals
[866.00 - 870.32] even the best vegan ink the best cruelty
[868.16 - 872.64] free ink the best steriling the best
[870.32 - 874.56] non-toxic ink whatever they say
[872.64 - 876.32] there's metals in it so that the light
[874.56 - 878.56] when it hits your skin if you get a
[876.32 - 881.12] tattoo on your hand it hits the skin
[878.56 - 883.36] it goes into it the light then reflects
[881.12 - 884.80] off of the ink and pops back and that
[883.36 - 885.36] because if they didn't put toxic heavy
[884.80 - 887.60] metals in
[885.36 - 889.28] ink you wouldn't see your ink it would
[887.60 - 892.00] turn into a blob
[889.28 - 894.00] literally a blob and that's why ink
[892.00 - 897.04] fades throughout the years because the
[894.00 - 899.68] metals leach down and they
[897.04 - 901.68] drop deeper into the derma and the metal
[899.68 - 903.44] stop having that reflection ability and
[901.68 - 904.96] i didn't even say that part when i was
[903.44 - 907.44] talking about the tattoos
[904.96 - 908.56] i didn't even say that part that the ink
[907.44 - 910.88] as it settles
[908.56 - 912.32] deeper into the derma and then goes into
[910.88 - 915.44] the bloodstream the metals
[912.32 - 917.44] go into the bloodstream you lose the it
[915.44 - 918.80] fades the reason why it's fading is
[917.44 - 922.32] because the metals are
[918.80 - 924.48] leaving the ink so so then this so that
[922.32 - 926.24] so the light doesn't reflect so strong
[924.48 - 926.56] and i didn't even say that part i was i
[926.24 - 928.00] was
[926.56 - 929.28] i was bummed out i didn't tell you guys
[928.00 - 930.40] about that part too because it's such
[929.28 - 932.00] good information
[930.40 - 934.08] but um the point is don't get rid of
[932.00 - 934.80] your ink and tattoos don't do that just
[934.08 - 936.72] do the
[934.80 - 938.16] you know do what i tell my friends and
[936.72 - 939.76] family if you want ask your doctor if
[938.16 - 941.76] it's right for you
[939.76 - 943.60] do the heavy metal detox smoothie and i
[941.76 - 945.28] talked about that here's the spirulina
[943.60 - 946.96] and the barley grass you guys know i
[945.28 - 949.52] talk about that
[946.96 - 951.60] the you know and that's what i would do
[949.52 - 954.48] i tell my friends and family

[992.96 - 996.72] your spinach soup
[995.28 - 998.48] i just want to at least start this a
[996.72 - 1001.52] little bit
[998.48 - 1004.72] 30 years ago i got ebv then set a
[1001.52 - 1007.44] megalovirus i talk about cytomegalovirus
[1004.72 - 1009.48] diagnosed with cfs meniere's meniere's
[1007.44 - 1013.04] which is vertigo
[1009.48 - 1016.64] diverticulitis i see and finally
[1013.04 - 1018.64] chf i'm exhausted and need help
[1016.64 - 1020.80] sandy i completely understand and that's
[1018.64 - 1022.40] that's that's what millions of women
[1020.80 - 1024.00] when they discovered the medical medium
[1022.40 - 1026.48] books and discovered this first book
[1024.00 - 1028.08] here they were in that situation and
[1026.48 - 1028.48] they needed to learn about the epstein
[1028.08 - 1030.16] barr
[1028.48 - 1031.92] they needed to learn how to learn how it
[1030.16 - 1033.12] worked and they needed to learn some of
[1031.92 - 1034.88] the foods
[1033.12 - 1038.08] and if you guys can't get the book right
[1034.88 - 1041.12] now on amazon.com like you can't buy it
[1038.08 - 1041.76] maybe you know because you don't have
[1041.12 - 1043.52] any money
[1041.76 - 1045.36] or whatever just wait for the book to
[1043.52 - 1046.32] come out for a while right and go to the
[1045.36 - 1048.56] library
[1046.32 - 1050.00] and ask for it or go straight to your
[1048.56 - 1051.92] library and ask for it
[1050.00 - 1053.12] so that they get a copy or something
[1051.92 - 1054.88] like that or
[1053.12 - 1056.56] so where people drop off their old
[1054.88 - 1058.48] copies to the library
[1056.56 - 1059.76] they'll they'll buy some extra copies
[1058.48 - 1060.32] and they should deliver that's what we
[1059.76 - 1061.76] do we'll
[1060.32 - 1064.24] you know get copies and bring them to
[1061.76 - 1064.24] libraries
[1065.20 - 1068.48] anyway so let's go into this a little
[1067.04 - 1069.68] bit i'm just going to pop a couple of
[1068.48 - 1071.20] tomatoes in here
[1069.68 - 1073.36] just to start with and we'll talk about
[1071.20 - 1075.92] epstein-barr and talk about
[1073.36 - 1077.20] stuff that's in the book so powerful
[1075.92 - 1079.04] information
[1077.20 - 1081.60] so i'm putting putting some tomatoes in
[1079.04 - 1083.76] here because this is the spinach soup
[1081.60 - 1085.36] you can do cherry tomatoes which i have
[1083.76 - 1087.04] right here but
[1085.36 - 1088.80] i'm in the mood for some of these these
[1087.04 - 1089.36] beautiful tomatoes so i'm popping these
[1088.80 - 1093.12] in here
[1089.36 - 1093.12] do another one okay
[1093.20 - 1095.84] so
[1096.48 - 1100.48] so there are over 60 varieties of
[1098.16 - 1101.52] epstein-barr i talk about it in medical
[1100.48 - 1104.08] medium
[1101.52 - 1105.84] secrets and i talk about how these are
[1104.08 - 1108.24] mutations of the virus
[1105.84 - 1109.20] as the years go by these the viruses do
[1108.24 - 1111.12] different things
[1109.20 - 1113.44] some viruses cause a little bit more
[1111.12 - 1114.80] fibromyalgia some cause hashimoto's
[1113.44 - 1116.08] thyroiditis
[1114.80 - 1117.84] and different levels and they're
[1116.08 - 1120.56] different aggressions of the virus
[1117.84 - 1122.96] okay and that's what makes this all
[1120.56 - 1124.32] different really what kind of virus do
[1122.96 - 1126.72] you have do you have
[1124.32 - 1127.44] you know epstein-barr which variety do
[1126.72 - 1129.68] you have
[1127.44 - 1131.36] how long have you had it you know you
[1129.68 - 1133.04] know and these are the things that make
[1131.36 - 1134.56] a big difference how many toxic heavy
[1133.04 - 1136.72] metals do you have
[1134.56 - 1138.16] um you know how many toxins overall
[1136.72 - 1139.92] how's your liver the condition of your
[1138.16 - 1143.12] liver all these things matter
[1139.92 - 1144.80] and with epstein-barr what it likes to
[1143.12 - 1148.16] do is it likes to start out
[1144.80 - 1150.56] by incubating or going
[1148.16 - 1153.12] dormant in the liver but epstein-barr
[1150.56 - 1154.00] never really just goes dormant it lives
[1153.12 - 1156.80] in us
[1154.00 - 1158.24] and stays alive as our immune system
[1156.80 - 1160.56] keeps it in check
[1158.24 - 1162.80] and then we get triggers along the way
[1160.56 - 1164.72] that become the triggers for the epstein
[1162.80 - 1168.08] bar that's sitting inside of us
[1164.72 - 1171.12] so like heartache betrayal
[1168.08 - 1173.76] broken trust broken promises
[1171.12 - 1174.72] these things hurt us really bad
[1173.76 - 1178.24] emotional
[1174.72 - 1180.32] abuse emotional hardship of any kind
[1178.24 - 1182.32] all those are triggers so there's a lot
[1180.32 - 1183.44] of emotional triggers from what we go
[1182.32 - 1185.20] through hard times
[1183.44 - 1187.04] and then we go into fight or flight and
[1185.20 - 1188.32] our adrenaline is pumping and our immune
[1187.04 - 1191.52] system drops
[1188.32 - 1193.84] divorces breakups and relationships
[1191.52 - 1194.80] and and then also we pick up epstein
[1193.84 - 1197.52] bars people
[1194.80 - 1199.44] pass around epstein bars in all kinds of
[1197.52 - 1201.20] relationships because that's just normal
[1199.44 - 1202.56] that's life it's like you get into a new
[1201.20 - 1204.72] relationship and then
[1202.56 - 1206.88] you got somebody else's epstein bar who
[1204.72 - 1208.64] also had somebody else's epstein bar and
[1206.88 - 1210.24] somebody else's epstein bar and said now
[1208.64 - 1212.72] i've seen bars are like
[1210.24 - 1214.48] they travel that way you know they can
[1212.72 - 1215.60] travel in restaurants you go into
[1214.48 - 1217.44] restaurants and you're
[1215.60 - 1219.84] eating food in restaurants epstein bar
[1217.44 - 1221.36] travels to restaurant food is probably
[1219.84 - 1223.84] one of the big ways it travels
[1221.36 - 1224.48] public bathrooms it can travel that way
[1223.84 - 1226.96] and so
[1224.48 - 1227.92] the whole population has an epstein-barr
[1226.96 - 1231.04] r2
[1227.92 - 1234.32] so that's the other thing so we all have
[1231.04 - 1236.40] ebv in our system and that's just
[1234.32 - 1238.56] the fact of life here the way of life
[1236.40 - 1240.00] here in on planet earth and then but
[1238.56 - 1241.44] that's okay
[1240.00 - 1242.72] because when you know what to do to take
[1241.44 - 1244.40] care of yourself and you know how to
[1242.72 - 1247.04] stop it from causing problems you know
[1244.40 - 1249.84] how to fix it when you have a problem
[1247.04 - 1251.20] that's what matters it's it's not about
[1249.84 - 1253.60] the fact that we pick
[1251.20 - 1255.28] epstein-barr up easy whether it's a new
[1253.60 - 1258.24] relationship
[1255.28 - 1259.84] a new friendship um you know some
[1258.24 - 1261.28] restaurant food somewhere from a chef
[1259.84 - 1263.60] cutting their finger or
[1261.28 - 1265.52] sweat dripping off a chef's you know
[1263.60 - 1266.80] forehead and dropping it right on your
[1265.52 - 1270.16] salad
[1266.80 - 1272.80] which is really an easy way to pass ebv
[1270.16 - 1274.00] um either way when we pick up new
[1272.80 - 1275.68] varieties
[1274.00 - 1277.28] and then they're in our system and then
[1275.68 - 1280.48] they become a problem
[1277.28 - 1282.00] later on we can do something about it
[1280.48 - 1284.32] and that's the whole point
[1282.00 - 1286.72] even if we didn't get fibro yet or
[1284.32 - 1289.04] eczema yet or psoriasis
[1286.72 - 1291.60] or we didn't get another condition lyme
[1289.04 - 1293.20] disease or we didn't get cfs or focusing
[1291.60 - 1294.48] concentration issues or something or
[1293.20 - 1296.88] dizziness or
[1294.48 - 1297.60] some kind of mysterious symptom even if
[1296.88 - 1299.52] we didn't go
[1297.60 - 1301.44] there yet we can take care of ourselves
[1299.52 - 1303.36] and we can clean abv up out of our
[1301.44 - 1305.04] system because everybody has it
[1303.36 - 1306.56] and eventually they get something if
[1305.04 - 1308.24] they don't take care of themselves you
[1306.56 - 1310.00] know someone might be young and seem
[1308.24 - 1312.16] strong and indestructible now
[1310.00 - 1314.08] they're on instagram they're on social
[1312.16 - 1315.84] media they're on facebook
[1314.08 - 1317.28] they're on youtube and they think they
[1315.84 - 1319.04] got it all down
[1317.28 - 1320.56] and they're doing their their you know
[1319.04 - 1321.52] foods and whatever it is in their
[1320.56 - 1324.08] lifestyle and
[1321.52 - 1325.04] boom they're 38 years old years later
[1324.08 - 1327.20] and then
[1325.04 - 1328.96] now we got ebv we got symptoms and they
[1327.20 - 1330.88] doubt everything and now they don't know
[1328.96 - 1331.44] what to do and i got all kinds of brain
[1330.88 - 1335.28] fog
[1331.44 - 1336.88] and back pain and all kinds of stuff so
[1335.28 - 1339.04] it's it's really important to have
[1336.88 - 1339.84] control over your health entirely and
[1339.04 - 1342.96] not just be
[1339.84 - 1344.48] in this place of you know you think you
[1342.96 - 1346.16] got control but you don't
[1344.48 - 1347.84] and the one thing about medical medium
[1346.16 - 1349.84] books especially this one
[1347.84 - 1351.12] is it allowed people to become so
[1349.84 - 1353.44] empowered
[1351.12 - 1354.88] that they were able to actually stop
[1353.44 - 1357.04] things from coming their way
[1354.88 - 1359.92] stop conditions from coming their way
[1357.04 - 1363.52] they were they were able to stop eb
[1359.92 - 1365.44] from causing harm and in the shingles
[1363.52 - 1367.12] too which is also in this book and
[1365.44 - 1369.12] so it's so important and then there's
[1367.12 - 1371.60] like this book also brought to light for
[1369.12 - 1374.16] the first time what bell's palsy was
[1371.60 - 1376.24] which is shingles back pain that's
[1374.16 - 1378.40] mysterious which is shingles virus and
[1376.24 - 1380.72] there's over 30 varieties of shingles
[1378.40 - 1381.44] so this book brought that information to
[1380.72 - 1384.80] light
[1381.44 - 1387.60] as well okay and frozen shoulder
[1384.80 - 1389.52] colitis so it it broke the truth about
[1387.60 - 1391.60] colitis which is the shingles frozen
[1389.52 - 1393.60] shoulder which is the shingles
[1391.60 - 1396.16] um bell's palsy with which is the
[1393.60 - 1397.44] shingles back pain like sciatica which
[1396.16 - 1399.60] is the shingles
[1397.44 - 1402.56] and um so it's just so great i just put
[1399.60 - 1404.16] some tomatoes in now i'm gonna put
[1402.56 - 1405.68] i'm gonna put a celery stick or two in
[1404.16 - 1406.16] i'm gonna do two celery sticks in this
[1405.68 - 1408.24] one
[1406.16 - 1409.60] small they're small celery sticks
[1408.24 - 1410.96] sometimes you have a really big celery
[1409.60 - 1412.40] stick that's all you need is that one
[1410.96 - 1415.52] big celery stick
[1412.40 - 1417.84] penny says i heard you can't heal okay
[1415.52 - 1420.48] polythemia and with the help of your
[1417.84 - 1423.84] book i was able to help heal my husband
[1420.48 - 1425.84] incredible incredible that's so special
[1423.84 - 1427.12] so amazing i'm gonna pop i'm gonna cut
[1425.84 - 1429.12] an orange over here
[1427.12 - 1431.04] and pop this in good to see you guys
[1429.12 - 1433.68] coming on education
[1431.04 - 1435.04] educating myself says the book was a
[1433.68 - 1437.04] master class
[1435.04 - 1438.48] and medical information you know it's
[1437.04 - 1440.72] it's funny because
[1438.48 - 1442.56] i keep on being told first of all i was
[1440.72 - 1444.40] i was asked to write the books
[1442.56 - 1446.24] i was asked by thousands of people
[1444.40 - 1448.80] because you guys know that i worked with
[1446.24 - 1449.28] over 250 000 people for over 30 years
[1448.80 - 1451.76] right
[1449.28 - 1453.92] and i was told every day by doctors
[1451.76 - 1456.00] every day by practitioners to write the
[1453.92 - 1459.28] books write the books write the books
[1456.00 - 1461.12] and and i was like ah just
[1459.28 - 1462.56] i got to help people i got to help like
[1461.12 - 1463.92] i'm helping them now and they're like no
[1462.56 - 1465.44] you've got to help millions of people
[1463.92 - 1468.40] everybody needs an opportunity
[1465.44 - 1469.68] everybody needs a chance so i wrote the
[1468.40 - 1470.32] books and that's and that's what
[1469.68 - 1472.24] happened
[1470.32 - 1474.08] like the world changed the world of
[1472.24 - 1475.68] medicine changed because of this book
[1474.08 - 1477.76] the world of medicine
[1475.68 - 1479.20] completely changed in chronic illness
[1477.76 - 1482.00] because of this book
[1479.20 - 1483.04] and um and so that was really special
[1482.00 - 1486.32] but
[1483.04 - 1487.92] but now i'm being told don't keep on
[1486.32 - 1491.20] writing the books
[1487.92 - 1492.64] create programs you know create programs
[1491.20 - 1494.24] people all they have to do is spend two
[1492.64 - 1496.24] thousand dollars for the program
[1494.24 - 1497.44] they can learn from the program and you
[1496.24 - 1499.36] can create multiple pro
[1497.44 - 1501.20] programs you know two thousand dollars a
[1499.36 - 1505.04] piece i'm like no i want this
[1501.20 - 1507.76] affordable i want a book that's
[1505.04 - 1509.92] really really affordable you can get
[1507.76 - 1511.28] your life saved and bring your life back
[1509.92 - 1513.20] i don't want to do that i don't want to
[1511.28 - 1515.04] stop writing the books no matter how
[1513.20 - 1516.56] hard the books are to write and do
[1515.04 - 1518.16] i don't want to just stop writing the
[1516.56 - 1519.76] books and create programs
[1518.16 - 1521.28] so people have to pay two three thousand
[1519.76 - 1522.96] dollars for a program in order to learn
[1521.28 - 1525.36] how to heal it just doesn't seem
[1522.96 - 1527.12] fair to me it just doesn't right now it
[1525.36 - 1527.60] just doesn't it just doesn't feel right
[1527.12 - 1530.24] so
[1527.60 - 1530.72] the book's there it's affordable and
[1530.24 - 1532.48] it's just
[1530.72 - 1534.64] it's just such a great way to heal i'm
[1532.48 - 1535.04] gonna pop in some orange in here you
[1534.64 - 1536.64] guys
[1535.04 - 1538.56] so i'm making the spinach soup which is
[1536.64 - 1540.08] really a famous recipe for healing
[1538.56 - 1541.92] it's one of the medical medium healing
[1540.08 - 1544.80] tools you guys laur
[1541.92 - 1546.08] uh lorelai hey what about tomatoes being
[1544.80 - 1548.00] nightshades
[1546.08 - 1550.80] what about them being nightshades
[1548.00 - 1554.84] because that's misinformation out there
[1550.80 - 1558.16] nightshades was a
[1554.84 - 1559.36] theory basically because okay it goes
[1558.16 - 1561.36] back to this book
[1559.36 - 1563.04] i'm glad you asked that question it's so
[1561.36 - 1565.28] important
[1563.04 - 1566.72] before this book came out no one knew
[1565.28 - 1569.60] what was wrong with anybody
[1566.72 - 1571.68] so lorelai think about it okay you got
[1569.60 - 1572.16] almost 100 years of chronic illness
[1571.68 - 1574.24] right
[1572.16 - 1575.28] people rushing to doctors not having any
[1574.24 - 1578.96] answers
[1575.28 - 1581.36] and um so a lot of theories were created
[1578.96 - 1583.28] because nobody knew why anybody was sick
[1581.36 - 1584.40] so then they'd be guessing games like
[1583.28 - 1586.88] what if it's
[1584.40 - 1587.84] these tomatoes because it's a night
[1586.88 - 1591.36] shade
[1587.84 - 1594.56] a spooky night shade
[1591.36 - 1597.28] kind of vegetable fruit thing right
[1594.56 - 1599.20] so that's one that was just a theory but
[1597.28 - 1601.52] there's no science behind it
[1599.20 - 1603.60] causing a problem there's no truth
[1601.52 - 1606.88] behind it they've never been able to
[1603.60 - 1608.88] link anything to it
[1606.88 - 1610.48] and so like rheumatoid arthritis isn't
[1608.88 - 1613.20] caused by a tomato
[1610.48 - 1614.96] it's caused by epstein-barr virus so you
[1613.20 - 1616.32] got all these people they're going into
[1614.96 - 1618.32] you know functional medicine doctors
[1616.32 - 1621.36] offices chinese medicine doctors offices
[1618.32 - 1623.92] naturopathic doctors offices do's doctor
[1621.36 - 1626.00] you know osteopathic doctors going in
[1623.92 - 1629.68] there looking for help for years like
[1626.00 - 1632.48] the 1960s the 1970s the 1980s
[1629.68 - 1634.32] and the 1990s no one having answers like
[1632.48 - 1636.56] why are we sick why are we sick
[1634.32 - 1638.40] and then it's like all you have to do is
[1636.56 - 1639.20] just come up and pull something out of
[1638.40 - 1640.88] thin air
[1639.20 - 1642.56] pull something out of somebody's you
[1640.88 - 1644.16] know whatever and just all of a sudden
[1642.56 - 1645.68] you're like you pull something out
[1644.16 - 1648.16] and it's like night shades that's the
[1645.68 - 1650.00] answer and that's why people are sick uh
[1648.16 - 1651.44] now it's lectins that's why people are
[1650.00 - 1652.80] sick well that's funny because millions
[1651.44 - 1655.28] of people already healed
[1652.80 - 1656.32] and they healed using the tomatoes they
[1655.28 - 1658.08] healed using
[1656.32 - 1660.24] potatoes they healed using all the
[1658.08 - 1661.04] medical medium tools and foods that i
[1660.24 - 1662.88] talked about
[1661.04 - 1664.72] and lectins didn't stop them from
[1662.88 - 1666.16] healing their diseases and chronic
[1664.72 - 1668.40] illness and everything else
[1666.16 - 1670.32] these are just these are guessing games
[1668.40 - 1671.36] to when someone doesn't know why
[1670.32 - 1673.76] somebody's sick
[1671.36 - 1674.56] so it's like it must be the nightshade
[1673.76 - 1677.76] it must be
[1674.56 - 1680.32] the leptin it must be hmm
[1677.76 - 1682.16] and maybe it's you know that vegetable
[1680.32 - 1684.00] that makes people sick so people just
[1682.16 - 1684.80] wanna they they just throw the guessing
[1684.00 - 1686.64] games out
[1684.80 - 1688.56] and the guessing games maybe it's
[1686.64 - 1689.84] candida that makes them sick because
[1688.56 - 1692.16] that was a complete
[1689.84 - 1694.40] farce and i talked about the whole
[1692.16 - 1695.12] candida mistake that happened out there
[1694.40 - 1697.12] and
[1695.12 - 1698.96] so and maybe it's the histamines maybe
[1697.12 - 1701.84] it's oxalates
[1698.96 - 1703.60] maybe it's that and and it's all a
[1701.84 - 1706.48] guessing game and that's the sad
[1703.60 - 1707.28] part so what happens is you get sucked
[1706.48 - 1708.72] into that
[1707.28 - 1710.96] you totally get sucked into that and
[1708.72 - 1713.44] that and that's a problem it really is
[1710.96 - 1714.72] um because if you really get sick
[1713.44 - 1717.60] someday
[1714.72 - 1719.28] and you're running from a tomato
[1717.60 - 1720.88] basically you're running from a bee
[1719.28 - 1722.64] a bumble bee and then you run right out
[1720.88 - 1724.40] into a street and get hit by a bus and
[1722.64 - 1726.48] you're mauled by a bus
[1724.40 - 1728.00] because you're running from a bee and
[1726.48 - 1729.44] the bee wasn't going to sting you
[1728.00 - 1731.28] because the tomatoes not going to hurt
[1729.44 - 1732.88] you it's just this is what they do they
[1731.28 - 1734.88] set this i i think they
[1732.88 - 1737.20] i think it's done purposely and by
[1734.88 - 1738.40] accident kind of a both of a combination
[1737.20 - 1739.92] out there it's like they just set
[1738.40 - 1741.44] everybody up for failure it's like no
[1739.92 - 1742.72] one wants anybody to truly heal or
[1741.44 - 1744.64] something
[1742.72 - 1747.36] um and where did if you had a problem
[1744.64 - 1748.72] with tomato what was it was it really a
[1747.36 - 1750.88] tomato like
[1748.72 - 1752.64] it was it a ripe perfectly ripe vine
[1750.88 - 1755.28] tomato like this
[1752.64 - 1756.96] and you cut it and you ate a piece of it
[1755.28 - 1760.08] and then something bad happened
[1756.96 - 1761.04] or was it the tomato sauce that was on a
[1760.08 - 1763.84] pizza
[1761.04 - 1765.60] that was on with cheese and bad oil and
[1763.84 - 1768.64] gluten in the crust was it that
[1765.60 - 1771.44] was it some other was it ketchup
[1768.64 - 1772.96] with vinegar in it was it that that was
[1771.44 - 1773.52] used for something else you know what i
[1772.96 - 1775.36] mean
[1773.52 - 1777.12] because those are the things that will
[1775.36 - 1778.64] get you sick it's the vinegar it's the
[1777.12 - 1781.20] cheese on a pizza
[1778.64 - 1783.12] that's what's gonna amp up the
[1781.20 - 1786.84] epstein-barr virus
[1783.12 - 1790.08] tomatoes are anti-viral tomatoes are
[1786.84 - 1792.88] anti-pathogen they're anti-bug
[1790.08 - 1795.04] and you know i remember teaching people
[1792.88 - 1796.88] about how the nightshade confusion was
[1795.04 - 1798.96] wrong from the beginning and it freed
[1796.88 - 1802.72] so many people they can heal they can
[1798.96 - 1806.24] eat potatoes and tomatoes
[1802.72 - 1809.84] so matt says your books info
[1806.24 - 1810.16] changed my life sue says false i used to
[1809.84 - 1812.80] get
[1810.16 - 1814.80] kidney stones now i have none of none
[1812.80 - 1815.68] and eat all the oxalates especially
[1814.80 - 1819.68] spinach
[1815.68 - 1822.80] and crap spinach is an anti-kidney stone
[1819.68 - 1824.80] uh you know fixer or whatever it's like
[1822.80 - 1828.16] it's the anti-kidney stone
[1824.80 - 1828.88] tool spinach is healing it heals the
[1828.16 - 1830.56] kidneys
[1828.88 - 1832.24] it heals the body it heals the
[1830.56 - 1833.92] gallbladder but that's how
[1832.24 - 1835.52] misinformation works out there it has
[1833.92 - 1838.88] tons of it out there you guys
[1835.52 - 1840.64] tons of it it's it's overwhelming now
[1838.88 - 1841.92] you know medical medium information when
[1840.64 - 1843.52] it hit the scene
[1841.92 - 1844.80] uh i've been teaching it forever but
[1843.52 - 1846.80] when it hit the scene in the
[1844.80 - 1848.80] publications of the books and stuff
[1846.80 - 1850.00] it was like it had such a leg up because
[1848.80 - 1851.84] everybody's like fresh air
[1850.00 - 1853.44] fresh air now there's so many tricks out
[1851.84 - 1855.36] there and so many people getting fooled
[1853.44 - 1857.04] in so many different directions it's
[1855.36 - 1859.60] it's really sad when you really see it
[1857.04 - 1861.52] now where do we start which one which
[1859.60 - 1864.72] which book tasha

[1931.28 - 1934.96] so anyway and i'm trying to protect the
[1932.96 - 1935.36] book right now because i usually make a
[1934.96 - 1937.92] mess
[1935.36 - 1939.36] i get food on it all of it i'm trying to
[1937.92 - 1942.08] trying to take care of it right now and
[1939.36 - 1943.52] not mess it up
[1942.08 - 1946.16] like when that book came to me i was
[1943.52 - 1948.32] like oh my god i can't believe i have it
[1946.16 - 1950.80] after all this time just put a little
[1948.32 - 1953.68] orange juice in here
[1950.80 - 1953.68] squeezing an orange
[1961.68 - 1964.00] great to see you guys i'm glad you're
[1962.88 - 1964.72] coming on we're going to talk about
[1964.00 - 1966.80] triggers
[1964.72 - 1968.08] with chronic illness triggers with
[1966.80 - 1969.52] symptoms and conditions we're going to
[1968.08 - 1971.20] talk about lyme disease
[1969.52 - 1972.56] so we're going to go into that that's
[1971.20 - 1974.64] where we're heading now
[1972.56 - 1976.16] just making some spinach soup i want to
[1974.64 - 1978.16] give you guys kind of a little in on
[1976.16 - 1981.04] this of what i got going on here so
[1978.16 - 1983.12] i got the cilantro i got the tomatoes i
[1981.04 - 1985.52] got some celery sticks thrown in there i
[1983.12 - 1989.36] squeezed some orange in there
[1985.52 - 1992.00] um jamie
[1989.36 - 1993.44] my husband has a horrible reaction to
[1992.00 - 1997.52] onion and garlic
[1993.44 - 1999.28] no doctors can figure out why um
[1997.52 - 2000.72] depends on the reaction well first of
[1999.28 - 2002.40] all um
[2000.72 - 2004.16] i would stay away from onions and garlic
[2002.40 - 2007.28] if he's having a bad reaction i would
[2004.16 - 2008.32] stay away from them for sure onions and
[2007.28 - 2012.00] garlic
[2008.32 - 2015.52] can kill bacteria so bacteria
[2012.00 - 2018.64] like h pylori it can kill bacteria
[2015.52 - 2020.96] like streptococcus it can kill
[2018.64 - 2022.88] bacteria like staph and what happens in
[2020.96 - 2024.72] people's intestinal tracts it gets so
[2022.88 - 2025.36] mucky in there you get a lot of staph
[2024.72 - 2028.72] you get c
[2025.36 - 2029.68] diff staph streptococcus e coli and h
[2028.72 - 2032.56] pylori
[2029.68 - 2033.28] so the even if you're not exhibiting
[2032.56 - 2035.44] symptoms
[2033.28 - 2038.24] there's people out there that have a lot
[2035.44 - 2041.20] of e coli streptococcus h pylori staph
[2038.24 - 2042.16] c diff in their intestinal tract small
[2041.20 - 2044.00] intestinal tract
[2042.16 - 2045.20] even in their stomach they have some of
[2044.00 - 2048.16] it so when you
[2045.20 - 2049.28] drop some garlic in there the garlic is
[2048.16 - 2051.60] giving direct
[2049.28 - 2052.32] kill-off so we're talking direct
[2051.60 - 2055.60] kill-off
[2052.32 - 2059.44] on that stuff the minute or the second
[2055.60 - 2061.68] that e coli explodes depending
[2059.44 - 2063.68] if it's got some toxins in it if that
[2061.68 - 2066.64] bacteria like strep e coli c
[2063.68 - 2068.96] diff staph uh h pylori has actually
[2066.64 - 2071.28] toxins in it or some bad toxins in it
[2068.96 - 2073.76] the minute those buggers explode from
[2071.28 - 2075.60] that direct hit from the garlic right
[2073.76 - 2078.40] and i'm looking for my garlic here it is
[2075.60 - 2081.52] the minute that garlic goes down
[2078.40 - 2083.20] and it hits those bugs and they die you
[2081.52 - 2084.96] don't even need a lot of those bugs to
[2083.20 - 2086.00] die you can have just a little bit of e
[2084.96 - 2088.64] coli dye
[2086.00 - 2090.72] a little bit of strep a tiny tiny bit of
[2088.64 - 2093.36] strep or e coli or anything
[2090.72 - 2095.20] if you you know if if they die then you
[2093.36 - 2097.04] get all you get the reactions you can
[2095.20 - 2099.20] get a lot of reactions okay
[2097.04 - 2101.52] and that's people who are loaded with
[2099.20 - 2104.16] all the different levels of bacteria
[2101.52 - 2106.16] in their system right so we can do is is
[2104.16 - 2106.96] how much garlic first of all i wouldn't
[2106.16 - 2109.92] do
[2106.96 - 2111.68] cooked garlic if i was somebody that was
[2109.92 - 2114.08] really hypersensitive
[2111.68 - 2116.88] because cooked garlic can still kill off
[2114.08 - 2118.80] the pathogens too but cooked garlic
[2116.88 - 2121.84] tends to be a little bit different
[2118.80 - 2124.48] digesting wise i mean i would say
[2121.84 - 2125.68] tiny bit if you're ever if you know if
[2124.48 - 2127.68] you're ever up against something like
[2125.68 - 2129.44] this but you want garlic you want onions
[2127.68 - 2131.60] it would be a tiny bit
[2129.44 - 2133.28] because when you use a tiny bit you end
[2131.60 - 2135.36] up killing just
[2133.28 - 2137.60] less you end up killing less of that
[2135.36 - 2139.92] bacteria so you might be able to slowly
[2137.60 - 2141.20] kill off that bacteria over time
[2139.92 - 2144.16] and get to that point where you can
[2141.20 - 2147.92] actually have garlic again or
[2144.16 - 2151.76] stay off the garlic and onions right
[2147.92 - 2154.48] and just change the diet so you're not
[2151.76 - 2155.20] feeding those bugs let them die off on
[2154.48 - 2157.92] their own
[2155.20 - 2158.56] naturally over time i have a gut health
[2157.92 - 2160.96] chapter
[2158.56 - 2164.00] in this medical medium book right here
[2160.96 - 2167.12] which is incredible gut health chapter
[2164.00 - 2168.48] um it's so much information in here it
[2167.12 - 2173.60] really there really is
[2168.48 - 2175.68] and so you can do like the healing foods
[2173.60 - 2176.72] make sure there's no gluten milk cheese
[2175.68 - 2179.52] or butter
[2176.72 - 2180.08] to keep the ice creams out keep all that
[2179.52 - 2181.76] out of there
[2180.08 - 2183.84] and there's protocols in the book too
[2181.76 - 2185.28] just eating better like the 28 day
[2183.84 - 2188.24] cleanse in the medical medium book
[2185.28 - 2189.60] just eating better like the 28 day
[2188.24 - 2191.04] cleanse in that book can be really
[2189.60 - 2192.40] helpful so that now you're killing off
[2191.04 - 2193.68] the bacteria and i recommend that to
[2192.40 - 2194.32] everybody and that's why a lot of people
[2193.68 - 2196.72] healed
[2194.32 - 2198.64] when you're doing the 28 day cleanse
[2196.72 - 2200.72] you're starving
[2198.64 - 2202.08] that e coli that's in everybody you know
[2200.72 - 2203.84] i know people today they'll be like i
[2202.08 - 2204.80] don't got any e coli in my system i go
[2203.84 - 2206.64] yeah you do
[2204.80 - 2208.08] of course you do i don't got any strep
[2206.64 - 2209.60] in my system well did you have strep
[2208.08 - 2210.96] throat before yeah i had a sore throat
[2209.60 - 2212.48] and they said it was strapped back
[2210.96 - 2213.68] when i was younger yeah it's still in
[2212.48 - 2215.44] your system it's in your gut and
[2213.68 - 2217.28] eventually it causes sibo and then you
[2215.44 - 2219.92] get the sibo diagnosis right
[2217.28 - 2221.84] so and you know people got that e coli
[2219.92 - 2223.60] they got the strep they got the h pylori
[2221.84 - 2224.08] people are loaded with this stuff you
[2223.60 - 2227.20] know
[2224.08 - 2231.12] the 28 day cleanse in medical medium
[2227.20 - 2232.88] took away the foods that feed these
[2231.12 - 2234.96] pathogens feed the bacteria and
[2232.88 - 2237.76] proliferate this bacteria right
[2234.96 - 2239.28] the 20-day cleanse took away that people
[2237.76 - 2240.64] like getting their lives back on the
[2239.28 - 2243.92] 28-day cleanse
[2240.64 - 2246.88] healing because they were taking away
[2243.92 - 2248.40] foods that feed the bugs right so here
[2246.88 - 2250.56] you go
[2248.40 - 2252.48] that's your bacteria that's your e coli
[2250.56 - 2255.44] that's your streptococcus
[2252.48 - 2256.72] that's your h pylori that's your c diff
[2255.44 - 2260.08] that's your staff
[2256.72 - 2260.88] okay sits inside everybody's guts 28-day
[2260.08 - 2262.48] cleanse
[2260.88 - 2264.32] took away the food that feeds the
[2262.48 - 2265.68] bacteria so the bacteria couldn't eat
[2264.32 - 2267.84] anymore it's like wait a minute
[2265.68 - 2269.76] this person's on the 28-day cleanse and
[2267.84 - 2270.96] i can't find any food and i'm starting
[2269.76 - 2272.72] to starve in here
[2270.96 - 2274.56] and this person's cleaning up so i can't
[2272.72 - 2275.60] even find old food that's hanging around
[2274.56 - 2277.12] the intestinal tract
[2275.60 - 2279.20] and then the bacteria is like where do i
[2277.12 - 2281.60] go where do i go and it weakens and
[2279.20 - 2283.60] weakens and eventually dies off or
[2281.60 - 2284.88] gets flushed out and pushed out by the
[2283.60 - 2286.08] 20-day cleanse
[2284.88 - 2287.44] and that's how people were getting
[2286.08 - 2290.88] better that's one way they're getting
[2287.44 - 2290.88] better from the 28-day cleanse
[2292.24 - 2296.72] making the spinach soup let's talk about
[2295.20 - 2299.36] lyme disease
[2296.72 - 2300.80] let me put a little bit of spinach in
[2299.36 - 2302.96] here
[2300.80 - 2305.92] let me put a little bit of spinach let's
[2302.96 - 2305.92] do that right now
[2306.24 - 2309.36] honestly people being afraid of spinach
[2308.40 - 2312.08] is heartbreaking
[2309.36 - 2313.12] breaks my heart totally does you guys i
[2312.08 - 2315.12] mean seriously
[2313.12 - 2317.84] it's so sad that's misinformation once
[2315.12 - 2317.84] again out there
[2318.00 - 2321.52] michelle been tested and allergic to
[2320.40 - 2323.68] tomatoes
[2321.52 - 2325.60] missed so much there's a difference
[2323.68 - 2327.04] between and i told a doctor friend about
[2325.60 - 2328.00] this recently there's a difference
[2327.04 - 2330.32] between
[2328.00 - 2331.12] what a test says for your foods because
[2330.32 - 2333.28] you can go
[2331.12 - 2334.64] and get tested do a food sensitivity
[2333.28 - 2336.48] test and they'll be like you're allergic
[2334.64 - 2338.00] to tomatoes you're allergic to eggplant
[2336.48 - 2339.60] allergic to strawberries you're allergic
[2338.00 - 2341.20] to cilantro you're allergic to
[2339.60 - 2342.72] some kind of weird ragweed you're
[2341.20 - 2343.36] allergic to whatever and they just throw
[2342.72 - 2345.44] all the stuff
[2343.36 - 2346.72] in stuff that isn't even food stuff that
[2345.44 - 2348.32] you would never eat in a million years
[2346.72 - 2349.20] you're allergic to star and nice you're
[2348.32 - 2350.88] allergic to
[2349.20 - 2353.12] ginger you know they'll just do all the
[2350.88 - 2355.76] stuff right and
[2353.12 - 2357.44] meanwhile you're getting tested by a
[2355.76 - 2359.36] system that doesn't know why you're sick
[2357.44 - 2361.20] or doesn't know why anybody's sick
[2359.36 - 2362.64] food sensitivities they don't know why
[2361.20 - 2364.80] anybody's sick do they know why the
[2362.64 - 2366.16] world's sick i mean unless they know
[2364.80 - 2368.16] unless they're actually doing what
[2366.16 - 2370.00] science research is now taking
[2368.16 - 2371.28] taking all the cues from medical medium
[2370.00 - 2372.40] books they're not going to know why
[2371.28 - 2376.16] anybody's sick
[2372.40 - 2376.72] so um so what i told the doctor friend
[2376.16 - 2378.80] is like
[2376.72 - 2380.96] are you and dr fred actually said well
[2378.80 - 2382.40] my food sensitivity test says i'm
[2380.96 - 2383.36] allergic tomatoes and i said to my
[2382.40 - 2385.76] doctor friend i said
[2383.36 - 2387.28] so if you ate a tomato what happened so
[2385.76 - 2389.60] i gave him a tomato
[2387.28 - 2390.32] and i said if you eat a tomato what
[2389.60 - 2392.40] happens
[2390.32 - 2394.32] say nothing nothing happens if i eat a
[2392.40 - 2396.16] tomato but my food sensitivities
[2394.32 - 2398.24] test says you know i'm allergic to it
[2396.16 - 2399.12] like okay well that's really funny
[2398.24 - 2401.92] because
[2399.12 - 2403.20] um you can eat it and you're fine yeah i
[2401.92 - 2404.88] could eat it i'm fine
[2403.20 - 2406.48] like what else does your test say you're
[2404.88 - 2407.52] allergic to test says i'm allergic to
[2406.48 - 2409.12] blackberries
[2407.52 - 2411.44] what happens when eat the blackberries
[2409.12 - 2414.40] nothing i'm fine like okay
[2411.44 - 2415.76] and what happens is those tests they're
[2414.40 - 2418.64] not perfect
[2415.76 - 2420.56] and they never were they never will be
[2418.64 - 2422.56] it's different if you're eating a tomato
[2420.56 - 2424.16] and your mouth is swelling up and your
[2422.56 - 2425.04] throat's swelling up and you can't
[2424.16 - 2426.48] breathe
[2425.04 - 2428.00] look i don't want you to eat tomato if
[2426.48 - 2429.68] you don't want to eat a tomato do what
[2428.00 - 2431.44] your doctor says your doctor says don't
[2429.68 - 2433.76] eat a tomato don't eat a tomato
[2431.44 - 2434.88] i'm just telling you about my experience
[2433.76 - 2436.40] with a doctor friend
[2434.88 - 2438.56] who said well you know my food
[2436.40 - 2441.76] sensitivity test is i'm orange tomatoes
[2438.56 - 2444.40] i guess i shouldn't have um and
[2441.76 - 2445.04] meanwhile you know last week or whatever
[2444.40 - 2448.24] it's like
[2445.04 - 2451.44] i had a pizza you know he was like
[2448.24 - 2452.80] whatever uh nozilla when i first started
[2451.44 - 2456.88] to drink celery juice
[2452.80 - 2459.20] i had a lot of shivering and diarrhea
[2456.88 - 2461.28] it was a sign that lots of cleansing was
[2459.20 - 2463.84] happening i don't have any
[2461.28 - 2465.84] any of these drastic symptoms anymore
[2463.84 - 2466.72] because i have healed so much with mm
[2465.84 - 2468.56] info
[2466.72 - 2470.08] what that is is when you do your celery
[2468.56 - 2471.44] juice and i got my juicer over there in
[2470.08 - 2472.48] the corner can you guys see it i
[2471.44 - 2474.08] actually just juiced
[2472.48 - 2476.16] pretty recently before i started this
[2474.08 - 2478.24] live and i drank my juice
[2476.16 - 2479.92] um what happens is when you're doing
[2478.24 - 2481.44] your celery juice and i just put a
[2479.92 - 2482.48] little celery in the spinach soup by the
[2481.44 - 2484.00] way
[2482.48 - 2485.68] when you're doing that the sodium
[2484.00 - 2487.76] cluster salt and celery destroy
[2485.68 - 2488.88] pathogens so it looks like this so
[2487.76 - 2490.48] here you go you got all these little
[2488.88 - 2491.52] bugs in here right you guys know this
[2490.48 - 2493.36] one right
[2491.52 - 2494.96] it's my little friend virus right
[2493.36 - 2498.56] epstein-barr
[2494.96 - 2499.76] and bacteria okay streptococcus
[2498.56 - 2500.80] so people are filled with all the
[2499.76 - 2502.48] bacteria they're filled with all the
[2500.80 - 2504.16] strep you start dropping celery juice in
[2502.48 - 2504.56] there the sodium cluster salts start to
[2504.16 - 2506.16] strip
[2504.56 - 2507.76] down the membrane and that's what
[2506.16 - 2509.36] happens the bacteria will have this
[2507.76 - 2511.36] membrane all around it like this you see
[2509.36 - 2513.68] this that's that's the membrane and
[2511.36 - 2515.36] that celery juice starts to eat away you
[2513.68 - 2517.20] see these little furry things that stick
[2515.36 - 2519.28] up that stick off this bacteria
[2517.20 - 2520.48] that's actually accurate bacteria will
[2519.28 - 2522.64] have fur on it
[2520.48 - 2524.32] some viruses will have fur on it that's
[2522.64 - 2525.12] their first defense mechanism right
[2524.32 - 2526.48] there
[2525.12 - 2529.12] they have first sticking out of their
[2526.48 - 2532.40] membrane that's what that's what happens
[2529.12 - 2534.72] and so just to break that down
[2532.40 - 2536.00] is is difficult all on its own but not
[2534.72 - 2537.92] for celery juice celery
[2536.00 - 2539.76] juice the sodium cluster salt starts to
[2537.92 - 2541.36] break down that membrane
[2539.76 - 2543.60] and and that's then starts to really
[2541.36 - 2543.60] help
[2543.76 - 2549.92] and julia my daughter's eczema
[2546.80 - 2551.44] went away uh do his protocol celery
[2549.92 - 2554.24] juice no eggs supplements
[2551.44 - 2555.76] dot dot dot incredible incredible um you
[2554.24 - 2557.04] guys have if you just got on here i'm
[2555.76 - 2558.24] talking about lyme disease right here
[2557.04 - 2559.44] out of medical medium i'm gonna read
[2558.24 - 2560.80] some triggers too
[2559.44 - 2562.72] so this book has healed tens of
[2560.80 - 2565.12] thousands of people with lyme disease
[2562.72 - 2567.60] when it came out and now it's hundreds
[2565.12 - 2569.60] of thousands of people with lyme disease
[2567.60 - 2570.64] since it's been out um this is the new
[2569.60 - 2572.40] edition it's
[2570.64 - 2574.08] packed with information even more i put
[2572.40 - 2576.16] a whole book in this that's why
[2574.08 - 2577.68] it's so big and now that's the whole bit
[2576.16 - 2579.76] um so
[2577.68 - 2581.28] this book the lyme disease section of
[2579.76 - 2582.72] this book has changed the way doctors
[2581.28 - 2585.68] see lyme disease
[2582.72 - 2587.76] so it's changed the way they see it
[2585.68 - 2589.60] because this book exposed the truth
[2587.76 - 2593.36] about lyme disease that lyme disease
[2589.60 - 2596.72] is viral not bacterial so okay
[2593.36 - 2600.32] so this lyme disease is caused by
[2596.72 - 2603.44] viruses not bacteria okay
[2600.32 - 2607.04] and so that was what this book exposed
[2603.44 - 2610.48] um and also what happened with this book
[2607.04 - 2613.52] is it forced the medical science
[2610.48 - 2614.88] of the world it forced them to abandon
[2613.52 - 2617.12] the theory that lyme disease was
[2614.88 - 2618.64] bacteria so they abandoned it
[2617.12 - 2620.16] so medical research and science doesn't
[2618.64 - 2622.64] believe lyme disease is bacteria
[2620.16 - 2624.08] anymore now the lyme labs that your
[2622.64 - 2627.12] doctor sends the tet
[2624.08 - 2630.16] the blood to right
[2627.12 - 2632.48] they won't abandon the idea
[2630.16 - 2634.72] that it's bacteria because they built
[2632.48 - 2637.28] their empires
[2634.72 - 2638.80] on lyme disease being bacteria so you
[2637.28 - 2641.04] got these lyme labs
[2638.80 - 2642.72] that have made billions of dollars for
[2641.04 - 2646.00] the last 50 years
[2642.72 - 2647.68] 40 50 years and they can't abandon it so
[2646.00 - 2650.16] you've got the lyme labs
[2647.68 - 2651.52] with then you've got the doctors that
[2650.16 - 2653.52] are the old dogs now
[2651.52 - 2656.00] the old dogs that believe that still
[2653.52 - 2658.40] believe lyme disease is bacterial
[2656.00 - 2659.52] you got them working with the lyme labs
[2658.40 - 2661.12] but then
[2659.52 - 2663.28] you got medical research and science
[2661.12 - 2666.00] which is their boss
[2663.28 - 2668.00] doctor's boss in medical research and
[2666.00 - 2669.92] science is the boss of doctors it's the
[2668.00 - 2671.76] boss of the lyme labs
[2669.92 - 2673.44] that big boss doesn't believe it's
[2671.76 - 2675.76] bacterial anymore because of medical
[2673.44 - 2677.68] medium books so they took lyme disease
[2675.76 - 2679.36] out of the bacterial world and they put
[2677.68 - 2680.88] it now in autoimmune so now it's an
[2679.36 - 2681.28] autoimmune they don't know what it is so
[2680.88 - 2683.60] they
[2681.28 - 2684.56] they're just like it could be viral it's
[2683.60 - 2686.24] not bacterial
[2684.56 - 2687.28] we don't know what lyme disease is
[2686.24 - 2690.00] anymore and that's because of the
[2687.28 - 2693.04] medical medium books now
[2690.00 - 2694.72] antibiotics destroyed thousands and
[2693.04 - 2696.48] thousands of women's lives now i say
[2694.72 - 2698.16] women because they were mostly stricken
[2696.48 - 2700.80] by this disease
[2698.16 - 2701.76] not men and that's still like that today
[2700.80 - 2704.32] now okay
[2701.76 - 2705.28] so tens of thousands of women's lives
[2704.32 - 2707.76] were destroyed because
[2705.28 - 2709.84] antibiotics because the overuse of
[2707.76 - 2710.80] bombarding their system with antibiotics
[2709.84 - 2714.56] when their condition
[2710.80 - 2716.96] wasn't bacterial this book
[2714.56 - 2718.00] has saved countless women's lives
[2716.96 - 2721.04] because they didn't have to
[2718.00 - 2721.36] go through all that heavy bombardment of
[2721.04 - 2724.00] that
[2721.36 - 2724.80] old school antibiotic treatment for lyme
[2724.00 - 2726.56] disease
[2724.80 - 2728.96] they were able to be freed from that and
[2726.56 - 2731.12] recover without having their life
[2728.96 - 2732.16] destroyed and that's what this book did
[2731.12 - 2735.12] the original one
[2732.16 - 2736.56] well now this is the new new and even
[2735.12 - 2738.40] improved because i added so much
[2736.56 - 2741.12] information into it okay
[2738.40 - 2741.92] now there's these doctors on podcasts
[2741.12 - 2743.68] right now
[2741.92 - 2745.60] there's some some of them famous
[2743.68 - 2747.44] whatever there's doctors on television
[2745.60 - 2751.04] with doing television careers
[2747.44 - 2753.44] and they were responsible for the damage
[2751.04 - 2754.56] and the life and the death of thousands
[2753.44 - 2756.56] of women
[2754.56 - 2759.12] going back many years of lyme disease
[2756.56 - 2760.00] but see no one ever corrects anything so
[2759.12 - 2761.92] they just kind of be
[2760.00 - 2763.84] act like a chameleon and now they're
[2761.92 - 2764.32] chameleon to another direction like oh i
[2763.84 - 2766.96] didn't
[2764.32 - 2768.72] i didn't run a clinic and give hundreds
[2766.96 - 2771.20] and hundreds and hundreds of women
[2768.72 - 2772.64] tons of antibiotics and destroyed their
[2771.20 - 2774.80] lives that wasn't me
[2772.64 - 2777.20] uh you know with the old lyme disease
[2774.80 - 2778.08] theory they keep on they keep on jumping
[2777.20 - 2780.24] from
[2778.08 - 2781.84] old theory to new theory to new theory
[2780.24 - 2783.52] to new theory to new theory
[2781.84 - 2784.72] and they don't clean up the mess nobody
[2783.52 - 2786.24] knows what they did now they're on
[2784.72 - 2788.08] podcasts or have their own podcast
[2786.24 - 2790.64] meanwhile they've destroyed so many
[2788.08 - 2791.28] lives doctors from new england doctors
[2790.64 - 2792.56] from around
[2791.28 - 2795.04] you know the country around the world
[2792.56 - 2795.52] now they're famous for their podcast or
[2795.04 - 2797.60] something
[2795.52 - 2799.84] and literally they have a wake behind
[2797.60 - 2801.60] them blood on their hands
[2799.84 - 2803.04] uh because i know i've been in this for
[2801.60 - 2806.16] 35 years i know
[2803.04 - 2808.16] who screwed up everything
[2806.16 - 2810.08] when it came down to that i know how
[2808.16 - 2811.92] that worked people who lost their lives
[2810.08 - 2813.12] i know the good doctors versus the bad
[2811.92 - 2814.64] doctors i know
[2813.12 - 2816.56] what happened in the lyme disease world
[2814.64 - 2818.64] and it's it's really hell
[2816.56 - 2819.68] and there's a terrible thing and what
[2818.64 - 2822.00] happened so
[2819.68 - 2823.60] this book has changed that for so many
[2822.00 - 2825.28] women so they don't have to go that
[2823.60 - 2828.16] route of being bombard
[2825.28 - 2829.84] bombarded being completely just having
[2828.16 - 2832.00] their systems wrecked with tons of
[2829.84 - 2832.40] antibiotics not knowing that it's viral
[2832.00 - 2834.24] and
[2832.40 - 2836.80] being told it's bacterial and that's
[2834.24 - 2838.96] what's incredible about the book so
[2836.80 - 2840.72] and no one sees those mistakes no one no
[2838.96 - 2843.20] one care who cares if tens of thousands
[2840.72 - 2845.44] of women lost their lives
[2843.20 - 2846.80] from lyme disease and you know who cares
[2845.44 - 2848.64] because it doesn't matter
[2846.80 - 2850.80] those doctors they never get like no one
[2848.64 - 2853.12] ever says hey so you just spent
[2850.80 - 2853.92] 20 years bombarding you know women with
[2853.12 - 2857.04] so much and
[2853.92 - 2858.48] sarah says i was given so much doxy yeah
[2857.04 - 2861.68] in boxing it was brutal
[2858.48 - 2863.52] sarah that was the old way
[2861.68 - 2865.36] and that's the way that now you'll see
[2863.52 - 2867.04] these podcast doctors out there
[2865.36 - 2868.48] that you know are doing their podcast
[2867.04 - 2869.20] they got all this money behind them and
[2868.48 - 2872.40] they're
[2869.20 - 2875.52] they have a history of
[2872.40 - 2877.52] bombarding women with antibiotics and
[2875.52 - 2878.96] they don't even like they don't come to
[2877.52 - 2881.20] the table and say well
[2878.96 - 2882.80] made a mistake shouldn't have done that
[2881.20 - 2884.00] i shouldn't maybe we shouldn't have gone
[2882.80 - 2886.08] that direction
[2884.00 - 2887.04] you know no and they don't just keep on
[2886.08 - 2889.52] going with the
[2887.04 - 2891.36] you know the theories and the bs and who
[2889.52 - 2894.00] cares you know it's amazing
[2891.36 - 2894.64] amy beasley explain why when a lyme
[2894.00 - 2897.68] patient
[2894.64 - 2901.36] takes antibiotics when they have um
[2897.68 - 2902.96] why they have they die off or hurts
[2901.36 - 2904.72] yeah absolutely i talk about it medical
[2902.96 - 2906.32] medium book here
[2904.72 - 2908.00] they're not having a die off when they
[2906.32 - 2909.52] take antibiotics they're having a
[2908.00 - 2911.20] reaction their nervous system is having
[2909.52 - 2912.48] a reaction to the toxic nature of the
[2911.20 - 2915.04] antibiotics now i'm not against
[2912.48 - 2916.64] antibiotics okay and do what your doctor
[2915.04 - 2919.04] wants to do but the point is
[2916.64 - 2919.92] is that i'm asked this all the time by a
[2919.04 - 2921.76] lot of people
[2919.92 - 2923.76] and what happens is and i taught about
[2921.76 - 2924.40] this for years and taught doctors this
[2923.76 - 2927.04] too
[2924.40 - 2928.72] herxheimer is a theory that there's a
[2927.04 - 2930.32] die-off happening
[2928.72 - 2932.32] you so you just think there's a die-off
[2930.32 - 2933.68] happening but what it is
[2932.32 - 2936.64] it's an adverse reaction to the
[2933.68 - 2938.96] antibiotic because when you have lyme
[2936.64 - 2940.72] you have viral inflammation to the
[2938.96 - 2942.40] nervous system and when the nerves are
[2940.72 - 2945.60] very sensitive i'll say it again
[2942.40 - 2947.76] you have viral information inflammation
[2945.60 - 2949.04] to the nervous system so the vagus nerve
[2947.76 - 2950.64] the phrenic nerves
[2949.04 - 2952.40] all the nerves in the body they get
[2950.64 - 2954.64] sensitive as heck
[2952.40 - 2956.00] so when something toxic like an
[2954.64 - 2957.28] antibiotic it's driven into
[2956.00 - 2959.20] the body whether it's through
[2957.28 - 2960.96] intravenous or any other way
[2959.20 - 2962.24] you think you're getting herxheimer but
[2960.96 - 2964.96] what you're doing is just
[2962.24 - 2966.56] hurting bad your nerves are hurting bad
[2964.96 - 2969.12] hypersensitive nerves
[2966.56 - 2970.16] from viral infections they can't handle
[2969.12 - 2971.60] a lot of things
[2970.16 - 2973.12] and that's the great mistake in the
[2971.60 - 2974.40] industry but i would listen to your
[2973.12 - 2976.08] doctor if he thinks you need to be on
[2974.40 - 2977.68] antibiotics you go on antibiotics if
[2976.08 - 2979.92] that's what your doctor wants
[2977.68 - 2981.36] you know or whatever and and all that
[2979.92 - 2982.96] i'm just saying that look you can always
[2981.36 - 2985.12] take the book to your doctor
[2982.96 - 2986.64] and and maybe educate him and maybe
[2985.12 - 2988.40] he'll see some other things
[2986.64 - 2990.40] but whatever whatever your doctor says
[2988.40 - 2992.32] do um
[2990.40 - 2993.52] but that's how it works with herxheimers
[2992.32 - 2994.56] and that's how it works with the whole
[2993.52 - 2998.08] situation
[2994.56 - 2999.76] um anyway
[2998.08 - 3001.36] talk about triggers in a second let me
[2999.76 - 3002.48] just blend this up a little bit
[3001.36 - 3004.96] and then we're going to go into some
[3002.48 - 3007.84] triggers that's the next thing
[3004.96 - 3013.60] so i'm going to make the spinach soup
[3007.84 - 3016.08] let me at least do some blending
[3013.60 - 3027.20] now you can use more spinach you can use
[3016.08 - 3028.64] less spinach not a lot there's not
[3027.20 - 3031.09] that much spinach in this one but
[3028.64 - 3033.68] there's definitely some in there
[3031.09 - 3035.92] [Music]
[3033.68 - 3035.92] so
[3038.32 - 3044.24] tammy can it just affect one side
[3041.44 - 3046.16] of the body i have ebv shingles and more
[3044.24 - 3048.80] it affects the left side from
[3046.16 - 3051.44] from ear to toe yeah absolutely
[3048.80 - 3054.56] definitely can affect one side
[3051.44 - 3057.28] epstein-barr hasn't um
[3054.56 - 3057.84] epstein-barr and shingles loves to
[3057.28 - 3060.80] affect
[3057.84 - 3062.00] one side in many many situations it just
[3060.80 - 3065.04] does
[3062.00 - 3069.84] i've seen bar can too
[3065.04 - 3069.84] i'll tell you why in a minute
[3078.96 - 3085.20] okay that spinach soup is blended
[3082.08 - 3086.80] epstein-barr releases neurotoxins
[3085.20 - 3089.44] some nerves will be more sensitive to
[3086.80 - 3091.20] their neurotoxins than other nerves
[3089.44 - 3093.12] what happens is if you've been under any
[3091.20 - 3096.24] stress your adrenals will
[3093.12 - 3097.44] release adrenaline and the left side of
[3096.24 - 3100.48] the body
[3097.44 - 3102.00] can be hit with more adrenaline from a
[3100.48 - 3103.52] stronger adrenal which could be the
[3102.00 - 3104.32] adrenal that's on the left side of your
[3103.52 - 3105.44] body too
[3104.32 - 3107.12] so when you're going through fight or
[3105.44 - 3109.52] flight any kind of stress in your life
[3107.12 - 3111.36] anything financial stress anything
[3109.52 - 3112.64] you know could be relationships whatever
[3111.36 - 3114.80] happens in your life
[3112.64 - 3116.08] that adrenal gland pumps out more and
[3114.80 - 3117.60] more and more adrenaline
[3116.08 - 3119.36] weakens the nervous system a little but
[3117.60 - 3120.56] you really can't feel that until the
[3119.36 - 3122.16] epstein bar releases all these
[3120.56 - 3123.76] neurotoxins and when the neurotoxins
[3122.16 - 3124.80] land on nerves it's going to be whatever
[3123.76 - 3126.16] nerves
[3124.80 - 3128.24] are your most sensitive and they're
[3126.16 - 3130.00] going to light right up shingles on the
[3128.24 - 3131.04] other hand can focus on one side of the
[3130.00 - 3132.88] body so
[3131.04 - 3134.32] you know it that can happen too but
[3132.88 - 3135.76] epstein-barr can
[3134.32 - 3138.32] can do different things there's
[3135.76 - 3141.28] different varieties
[3138.32 - 3141.28] glad you guys are here
[3144.40 - 3148.56] gotta pay attention when i cook when i
[3147.04 - 3150.80] prepare foods
[3148.56 - 3152.08] gary said i was really crippled with
[3150.80 - 3154.08] many lyme symptoms
[3152.08 - 3155.52] after a spider bite four years ago thank
[3154.08 - 3156.56] you anthony for bringing me back let's
[3155.52 - 3158.24] talk about triggers
[3156.56 - 3161.04] let's do that you guys i'm gonna pour
[3158.24 - 3161.04] this out in a minute
[3161.20 - 3166.64] but i'd like to talk about triggers and
[3163.52 - 3168.40] how it works
[3166.64 - 3169.84] a spider bite can lower your immune
[3168.40 - 3171.60] system
[3169.84 - 3172.96] and when your immune system is lowered
[3171.60 - 3174.64] because the spider bite is a trigger
[3172.96 - 3177.28] when your immune system is lowered
[3174.64 - 3180.64] now the epstein bar creeps up
[3177.28 - 3182.00] cytomegalovirus hhv6 herpes simplex one
[3180.64 - 3183.60] they can you know which is cold source
[3182.00 - 3184.32] they can all creep up shingles can all
[3183.60 - 3186.08] creep up
[3184.32 - 3188.08] strep can even creep up right but
[3186.08 - 3188.40] epstein-barr loves to creep up with all
[3188.08 - 3190.88] that
[3188.40 - 3192.64] because it just sits inside of us and
[3190.88 - 3193.20] eventually kind of comes out and creeps
[3192.64 - 3196.00] up
[3193.20 - 3197.84] so i'm going to page 197 i know you guys
[3196.00 - 3198.56] don't have your books yet i wish you had
[3197.84 - 3201.52] it
[3198.56 - 3202.88] had the book so amazon.com right now
[3201.52 - 3204.72] that's where you can get it if you want
[3202.88 - 3208.16] to know where you can get it right now
[3204.72 - 3210.48] um barnes and noble too online
[3208.16 - 3212.08] so right now i'm looking at triggers so
[3210.48 - 3213.12] i'm in the trigger section right here of
[3212.08 - 3215.12] lyme disease and it's really the
[3213.12 - 3217.44] triggers for epstein-barr too
[3215.12 - 3218.40] is there a list of recipes i came in
[3217.44 - 3221.44] late yeah
[3218.40 - 3223.20] there is uh in this book this is packed
[3221.44 - 3225.60] i'm making the spinach soup from this
[3223.20 - 3228.80] book yasmin thank you for coming here
[3225.60 - 3230.48] i really appreciate it so in this
[3228.80 - 3232.80] trigger zone here let's see if i could
[3230.48 - 3237.28] find spider bite
[3232.80 - 3239.36] so i'm looking right now um
[3237.28 - 3241.12] but yeah so the whole thing is spider
[3239.36 - 3241.92] bite to have it it's number 12 on the
[3241.12 - 3243.52] triggers list
[3241.92 - 3244.96] spider bites are actually much more
[3243.52 - 3246.32] common triggers for lyme disease
[3244.96 - 3247.84] symptoms than tick bites
[3246.32 - 3249.44] accounting for about five percent of
[3247.84 - 3252.56] cases from this list
[3249.44 - 3254.48] all right if the bite leaves some of the
[3252.56 - 3256.16] spider's venom inside your skin an
[3254.48 - 3257.84] infection can result that weakens your
[3256.16 - 3260.24] immune system
[3257.84 - 3261.84] roughly one out of five times it also
[3260.24 - 3264.64] produces a bullseye
[3261.84 - 3265.44] rash okay it can in a lot of people i'm
[3264.64 - 3267.12] reading
[3265.44 - 3268.80] out of the lyme disease chapter right
[3267.12 - 3273.52] here and
[3268.80 - 3276.40] um so talking about epstein-barr
[3273.52 - 3279.12] which is really an epidemic all on its
[3276.40 - 3280.64] own just so you know so
[3279.12 - 3282.56] let's talk about the triggers i got the
[3280.64 - 3284.24] book open i want to show you guys so i
[3282.56 - 3285.44] got a couple of note postage notes in
[3284.24 - 3287.44] here as you can see
[3285.44 - 3288.80] i'm in the trigger section of medical
[3287.44 - 3290.48] medium secrets
[3288.80 - 3291.92] i'm making the spinach soup i still got
[3290.48 - 3292.56] to pour it out and i still have to taste
[3291.92 - 3295.44] it
[3292.56 - 3296.80] so the first trigger right here i have
[3295.44 - 3299.04] here for epstein barr
[3296.80 - 3300.80] is the pandemic we're facing now so that
[3299.04 - 3301.28] pandemic that plague we're up against
[3300.80 - 3304.84] now
[3301.28 - 3307.84] is the first trigger the most powerful
[3304.84 - 3308.80] trigger for epstein-barr so everybody's
[3307.84 - 3310.56] epstein bars
[3308.80 - 3312.40] can really get amped up from the
[3310.56 - 3312.88] pandemic virus that's going around right
[3312.40 - 3315.60] now
[3312.88 - 3317.20] so if you happen to contract that virus
[3315.60 - 3318.40] that's creating this pandemic that's
[3317.20 - 3320.08] happening right now then
[3318.40 - 3321.52] you've got a good chance of creeping
[3320.08 - 3322.72] that epstein barr up
[3321.52 - 3324.96] we're actually triggering that
[3322.72 - 3327.20] epstein-barr up so
[3324.96 - 3328.32] okay the current pandemic can challenge
[3327.20 - 3331.12] the immune system
[3328.32 - 3333.20] both by exhausting its reserves and by
[3331.12 - 3334.16] causing it to overreact so what happens
[3333.20 - 3336.24] when we get
[3334.16 - 3337.76] sick from the pandemic virus that's
[3336.24 - 3340.00] going around right now
[3337.76 - 3341.20] it can trigger off by literally lowering
[3340.00 - 3342.08] our immune system weakening in our
[3341.20 - 3344.00] immune system
[3342.08 - 3345.84] and making it overreact a weakened
[3344.00 - 3346.72] immune system can in turn provide an
[3345.84 - 3348.96] opportunity
[3346.72 - 3350.56] for dormant viral infections to gain
[3348.96 - 3351.84] strength and create new symptoms so what
[3350.56 - 3354.08] i'm trying to say is
[3351.84 - 3356.32] in from what i'm reading here is that if
[3354.08 - 3357.20] you catch that pandemic bug going around
[3356.32 - 3359.60] right now
[3357.20 - 3360.48] right your immune system lowers it
[3359.60 - 3362.08] weakens
[3360.48 - 3364.08] and then any kind of low grade viral
[3362.08 - 3366.32] infection creeps up
[3364.08 - 3367.84] glad you guys are coming on all right
[3366.32 - 3369.60] making spinach soup and reading about
[3367.84 - 3373.20] the triggers right here
[3369.60 - 3375.68] and so that's important to know
[3373.20 - 3377.68] okay it can also lead to symptoms that
[3375.68 - 3378.80] someone had previously experienced to
[3377.68 - 3379.76] resurface so if you guys had
[3378.80 - 3381.60] epstein-barr
[3379.76 - 3383.12] if you guys had symptoms of epstein-barr
[3381.60 - 3384.96] maybe not even knew it was epstein-barr
[3383.12 - 3385.76] maybe had tingles and numbness aches and
[3384.96 - 3387.68] pains
[3385.76 - 3389.84] you know um ringing in the ears
[3387.68 - 3391.60] dizziness whatever it is burning skin
[3389.84 - 3392.48] then it's chances are those symptoms
[3391.60 - 3396.72] could come back
[3392.48 - 3396.72] if you get hit with that pandemic bug
[3396.88 - 3401.52] so that's another thing too the pandemic
[3400.24 - 3403.76] virus that's going around now is
[3401.52 - 3405.36] difficult on the central nervous system
[3403.76 - 3407.52] and people who have suffered with
[3405.36 - 3408.24] neurological lyme symptoms are often
[3407.52 - 3409.92] dealing with
[3408.24 - 3411.92] or often dealing with nervous system
[3409.92 - 3414.48] compromises already
[3411.92 - 3416.32] can get triggered by this because hey if
[3414.48 - 3418.16] you get a high fever from the pandemic
[3416.32 - 3419.52] bug that's going around right now that
[3418.16 - 3420.88] can trigger off the neurological
[3419.52 - 3423.28] symptoms of lyme
[3420.88 - 3424.72] if you've already were someone with lyme
[3423.28 - 3426.56] so that's one of the biggest
[3424.72 - 3427.84] triggers right now going on so you got
[3426.56 - 3428.72] all these millions of people out there
[3427.84 - 3429.84] with epstein-barr
[3428.72 - 3432.00] they don't know how to fix their
[3429.84 - 3433.20] epstein-barr they either struggle with
[3432.00 - 3434.40] it they struggle with symptoms and
[3433.20 - 3435.76] conditions that they don't even know
[3434.40 - 3438.96] causes it right
[3435.76 - 3440.08] and what happens is that
[3438.96 - 3442.00] that they're going around with the
[3440.08 - 3443.92] epstein bar they have it in their system
[3442.00 - 3446.16] it's sitting there whether it's causing
[3443.92 - 3447.76] trouble or not in the moment and then
[3446.16 - 3449.68] they end up getting the pandemic bug
[3447.76 - 3451.12] that's happening out there right
[3449.68 - 3452.48] they get hit with that well then that
[3451.12 - 3453.84] weakens the immune system and their
[3452.48 - 3455.68] epstein-barr creeps up
[3453.84 - 3457.68] and now they think it's a pandemic bug
[3455.68 - 3459.28] that's keeping them sick after the fact
[3457.68 - 3460.72] but really now their epstein-barr is
[3459.28 - 3463.04] ignited
[3460.72 - 3466.32] and it was published first here in the
[3463.04 - 3470.24] medical medium book right
[3466.32 - 3473.76] so um there's more information
[3470.24 - 3477.36] here to read too so that's one
[3473.76 - 3480.00] so just like the flu or the pandemic
[3477.36 - 3482.08] bug here now it can prompt that high
[3480.00 - 3482.80] fever which can heat and strain the
[3482.08 - 3485.20] nerves
[3482.80 - 3485.92] that are weakened so if someone recently
[3485.20 - 3487.76] healed
[3485.92 - 3488.96] those nerves can actually weaken from
[3487.76 - 3491.12] the high fever
[3488.96 - 3492.16] okay so the pandemic bug can create that
[3491.12 - 3494.80] high fever
[3492.16 - 3496.80] weaken somebody's nerves who actually
[3494.80 - 3498.56] recently healed and now we're back
[3496.80 - 3499.84] in the saddle again of having
[3498.56 - 3503.04] neurological lyme
[3499.84 - 3505.84] or having hashimoto's or having ra
[3503.04 - 3507.92] or having cfs or having any kind of
[3505.84 - 3509.60] thing any any kind of symptom really
[3507.92 - 3511.36] so many different symptoms so that's how
[3509.60 - 3513.28] it works there um
[3511.36 - 3514.64] so yeah but but i want to talk about
[3513.28 - 3516.64] blood draw extension
[3514.64 - 3518.40] extensive blood draw as a trigger so i'm
[3516.64 - 3519.92] in the trigger section right now
[3518.40 - 3521.44] i'm going to cover that for a minute i'm
[3519.92 - 3521.76] in medical medium if you just came on
[3521.44 - 3523.92] here
[3521.76 - 3525.52] the revised and expanded new edition you
[3523.92 - 3527.04] guys got to check it out it's on amazon
[3525.52 - 3528.64] the link is in description
[3527.04 - 3530.24] you can look at look at that right now
[3528.64 - 3531.44] so here's another trigger you have to
[3530.24 - 3533.20] look out for okay
[3531.44 - 3535.76] this trigger right here is a trigger
[3533.20 - 3538.40] that we get in trouble with all the time
[3535.76 - 3539.28] and we don't realize it it's extensive
[3538.40 - 3540.72] blood draw
[3539.28 - 3542.56] so when you go to your doctor to get
[3540.72 - 3545.52] blood taken so
[3542.56 - 3547.36] fasten your seat belts for this okay so
[3545.52 - 3549.84] we get told by our doctor hey
[3547.36 - 3551.36] you need some blood work let's go do it
[3549.84 - 3552.80] you'll be fine all right i need blood
[3551.36 - 3553.92] work because blood work's a good thing
[3552.80 - 3557.28] right yeah
[3553.92 - 3559.44] and they end up taking too much blood
[3557.28 - 3561.28] and if you have epstein-barr or you're
[3559.44 - 3562.72] already chronically sick with something
[3561.28 - 3565.04] that's epstein-barr related
[3562.72 - 3566.64] or epstein-barr caused of course like
[3565.04 - 3568.80] cfs or fibro or
[3566.64 - 3570.00] lupus whatever's going on in your life
[3568.80 - 3573.04] or just say vertigo
[3570.00 - 3574.40] dizziness focus some anxiety eczema
[3573.04 - 3576.24] psoriasis and you're already dealing
[3574.40 - 3577.68] with all these conditions right
[3576.24 - 3579.36] and then you go to the doctor and you
[3577.68 - 3582.72] get your blood drawn
[3579.36 - 3585.44] they end up taking more blood right
[3582.72 - 3586.48] from you than you need really taken from
[3585.44 - 3588.72] you first of all
[3586.48 - 3590.96] it gets thrown away at the la the labs
[3588.72 - 3592.56] so blood labs throw away 95
[3590.96 - 3594.48] of all that blood they take a little
[3592.56 - 3598.48] sample out of each vial but
[3594.48 - 3600.00] you end up losing a whole vial right and
[3598.48 - 3601.20] sometimes people get a whole vial and
[3600.00 - 3602.72] they'll take a bunch of things out of
[3601.20 - 3604.56] there do a bunch of tests out of that
[3602.72 - 3605.84] vial but still they throw away half the
[3604.56 - 3607.76] blood easy
[3605.84 - 3609.36] so they'll say hey you need five vials
[3607.76 - 3611.04] of blood you know they come and
[3609.36 - 3612.24] take your blood or you go to a place to
[3611.04 - 3613.84] get your blood taken or you're at the
[3612.24 - 3615.28] doctor's office to get your blood taken
[3613.84 - 3616.40] and they're like what we're taking
[3615.28 - 3618.00] they won't even tell you sometimes
[3616.40 - 3619.36] they'll just take seven vials they'll
[3618.00 - 3622.80] take seven vials
[3619.36 - 3624.64] nine vials 12 vials of blood 14
[3622.80 - 3626.16] vials of blood i talked about this in
[3624.64 - 3629.52] the past where
[3626.16 - 3631.52] where i've known people they've taken 20
[3629.52 - 3633.92] something vials plus
[3631.52 - 3635.60] and then some people die from that right
[3633.92 - 3636.96] they die literally die from that they
[3635.60 - 3638.72] get too much blood taken
[3636.96 - 3640.64] they weaken they can't recover and they
[3638.72 - 3642.64] get chronically ill and die
[3640.64 - 3644.40] and it all stemmed from that big blood
[3642.64 - 3646.72] draw right
[3644.40 - 3647.52] so i talk about this being a trigger so
[3646.72 - 3649.52] here you are
[3647.52 - 3651.68] you're somebody that is on the edge of
[3649.52 - 3654.56] epstein barr or you're on the edge of
[3651.68 - 3655.92] getting a sickness of some kind okay
[3654.56 - 3657.52] you're on the edge of some kind of
[3655.92 - 3658.88] low-grade viral infection like
[3657.52 - 3661.36] epstein-barr
[3658.88 - 3662.00] or shingles and then you get the blood
[3661.36 - 3664.48] draw
[3662.00 - 3666.08] and they take too much blood and what
[3664.48 - 3669.44] goes wrong with that
[3666.08 - 3671.84] is they remove your immune system so
[3669.44 - 3672.80] epstein-barr stay in us they live in us
[3671.84 - 3674.24] they live in our liver
[3672.80 - 3675.92] they live in our body they live in a lot
[3674.24 - 3678.40] of people's thyroid and they stay
[3675.92 - 3679.92] somewhat dormant they're not really
[3678.40 - 3682.16] causing too much trouble
[3679.92 - 3684.40] they're alive they're inside of us but
[3682.16 - 3686.00] they stay kind of relaxed kind of in a
[3684.40 - 3688.56] docile state
[3686.00 - 3689.12] because your immune system keeps it in
[3688.56 - 3691.60] check
[3689.12 - 3693.04] too so your white count basophils
[3691.60 - 3694.64] monocyte neutrophils are
[3693.04 - 3696.64] keeping it all in check that's what
[3694.64 - 3699.28] happens and
[3696.64 - 3701.04] as you're sitting there living your life
[3699.28 - 3702.00] your immune system is trying to stay
[3701.04 - 3703.52] strong
[3702.00 - 3705.60] and it's trying to keep those viruses
[3703.52 - 3708.16] down and then you get a blood test
[3705.60 - 3710.32] and they pull out too much blood when
[3708.16 - 3712.24] they pull out too much blood
[3710.32 - 3714.40] they end up pulling out your immune
[3712.24 - 3716.24] system that was in your blood
[3714.40 - 3718.24] now your immune system doesn't rebuild
[3716.24 - 3719.76] overnight you all of a sudden don't get
[3718.24 - 3720.88] a brand new immune system when they
[3719.76 - 3723.04] removed it
[3720.88 - 3724.24] so when they removed your white count in
[3723.04 - 3726.00] your blood
[3724.24 - 3728.16] that one time they took 10 vials of
[3726.00 - 3731.52] blood and that all that
[3728.16 - 3733.76] immune system went into that blood right
[3731.52 - 3735.12] meaning went out of your body in that
[3733.76 - 3738.08] blood right
[3735.12 - 3739.28] then epstein-barr is like wow we got a
[3738.08 - 3741.28] chance to now thrive
[3739.28 - 3742.40] i'm looking for we got a chance to now
[3741.28 - 3744.48] thrive because
[3742.40 - 3745.84] you had all that blood taken out so now
[3744.48 - 3748.32] the epstein barr is like
[3745.84 - 3750.08] whoa the immune system's gone right now
[3748.32 - 3751.92] a large part of your immune system that
[3750.08 - 3754.64] was inside your bloodstream
[3751.92 - 3756.16] keeping the virus from causing problems
[3754.64 - 3758.24] is now removed
[3756.16 - 3759.92] and that's why this is a huge trigger
[3758.24 - 3761.20] right here is blood draw
[3759.92 - 3763.52] so what i recommend and i'm going to
[3761.20 - 3765.28] read this section extensive blood draw
[3763.52 - 3766.72] that's a major trigger i'm talking about
[3765.28 - 3768.00] that that's in the medical media book
[3766.72 - 3770.40] right here okay
[3768.00 - 3771.20] when a larger number of blood vials are
[3770.40 - 3773.84] drawn
[3771.20 - 3775.76] it can be stressful on the immune system
[3773.84 - 3777.68] because the very immune defenses that
[3775.76 - 3779.84] are keeping the viruses behind lyme
[3777.68 - 3782.40] symptoms and other chronic illnesses
[3779.84 - 3783.84] the viruses behind lyme and other
[3782.40 - 3787.36] chronic illnesses
[3783.84 - 3789.84] the immune system keeps them at bay
[3787.36 - 3791.76] and now it's your immune system is being
[3789.84 - 3794.96] drawn out of the body
[3791.76 - 3794.96] when the blood is taken
[3795.76 - 3799.20] you guys so i'm in i'm in the lyme
[3797.52 - 3801.20] disease chapter chapter 16
[3799.20 - 3802.40] 16 of the book right here medical medium
[3801.20 - 3803.68] just letting you know
[3802.40 - 3805.44] and i'm going to tell you a couple other
[3803.68 - 3808.72] things in a second
[3805.44 - 3809.36] so here's how it goes um larger blood
[3808.72 - 3811.36] draws
[3809.36 - 3814.08] tend to take away a substantial portion
[3811.36 - 3816.00] of a person's immune system that day
[3814.08 - 3817.60] and it sometimes takes weeks to rebuild
[3816.00 - 3819.28] those portions of the immune system so
[3817.60 - 3820.16] here it goes you just had your blood
[3819.28 - 3822.08] taken
[3820.16 - 3824.48] now you need weeks to restore your
[3822.08 - 3826.88] immune system but during those weeks
[3824.48 - 3828.08] epstein-barr creeps up so say you're
[3826.88 - 3829.60] somebody with lyme disease which is
[3828.08 - 3831.36] epstein-barr infection
[3829.60 - 3833.28] and you get all this blood taken all the
[3831.36 - 3834.64] time your lyme doctor is getting all
[3833.28 - 3837.20] ordering all these blood tests you're
[3834.64 - 3839.12] getting all this blood removed right
[3837.20 - 3841.04] i've seen this take people into grave
[3839.12 - 3842.80] places with lyme disease
[3841.04 - 3845.12] too much of their immune system is being
[3842.80 - 3846.88] taken out and they decline and they
[3845.12 - 3847.76] decline and they decline over the years
[3846.88 - 3849.28] and decline
[3847.76 - 3850.80] and the very thing that's causing their
[3849.28 - 3853.60] lyme disease epstein-barr
[3850.80 - 3855.28] creeps up creeps up creeps up and really
[3853.60 - 3858.56] does a number on them
[3855.28 - 3860.32] so okay so that that's important to know
[3858.56 - 3861.92] too
[3860.32 - 3863.36] it can take weeks to rebuild those
[3861.92 - 3864.32] portions of your immune system within
[3863.36 - 3866.32] those weeks that
[3864.32 - 3868.08] that the full power of the immune system
[3866.32 - 3869.36] is not present anymore to monitor the
[3868.08 - 3870.88] blood the viruses
[3869.36 - 3873.04] can get a window to strengthen and
[3870.88 - 3874.80] proliferate infections can travel from
[3873.04 - 3877.12] organ to organ with ease
[3874.80 - 3878.24] that means your viral infection can
[3877.12 - 3880.64] travel from your liver
[3878.24 - 3881.60] to your spleen spleen to your pancreas
[3880.64 - 3883.68] all because
[3881.60 - 3885.20] the doctor's ordering too much blood it
[3883.68 - 3886.72] doesn't even know why you're sick with
[3885.20 - 3888.32] lyme to begin with doesn't know why
[3886.72 - 3890.08] you're sick with some kind of cfs
[3888.32 - 3891.20] doesn't know why you're sick with ra
[3890.08 - 3892.64] doesn't know why you're sick with
[3891.20 - 3894.24] anything hashimoto's and too much
[3892.64 - 3896.72] blood's being ordered
[3894.24 - 3898.48] so that's important to know infections
[3896.72 - 3900.96] can travel from organ organ with ease
[3898.48 - 3904.16] because they're not being corralled
[3900.96 - 3906.00] by your immune system right and that can
[3904.16 - 3907.36] lead to a flare-up of symptoms whether a
[3906.00 - 3908.96] week or a few weeks
[3907.36 - 3911.12] oh i didn't get my symptoms after i just
[3908.96 - 3912.80] had all my blood taken but you get it
[3911.12 - 3914.24] six months down the road
[3912.80 - 3915.68] then you got all these new symptoms six
[3914.24 - 3917.28] months down the road but you don't know
[3915.68 - 3918.96] it's from the blood that was taken six
[3917.28 - 3921.44] months before
[3918.96 - 3922.80] i recommend doing smaller blood draws
[3921.44 - 3924.56] over more visits
[3922.80 - 3925.84] if you're struggling with lyme symptoms
[3924.56 - 3927.92] or any other condition labeled
[3925.84 - 3930.88] autoimmune i recommend no more than
[3927.92 - 3931.52] four vials of blood at a time and even
[3930.88 - 3934.72] consider
[3931.52 - 3936.64] fewer if you're very sensitive a mistake
[3934.72 - 3938.24] made by well-meaning doctors is to draw
[3936.64 - 3939.12] a large number of blood vials with
[3938.24 - 3941.28] sensitive people
[3939.12 - 3942.72] that's just one precious piece of
[3941.28 - 3944.48] information
[3942.72 - 3946.00] in this book like when people say well
[3944.48 - 3947.20] why do i need that book like why would i
[3946.00 - 3950.00] need medical medium
[3947.20 - 3952.16] new addition or anything uh that piece
[3950.00 - 3953.84] of information can save people's lives
[3952.16 - 3955.28] it can save them from years of chronic
[3953.84 - 3956.80] illness it can ha
[3955.28 - 3958.96] it can help them literally get their
[3956.80 - 3961.36] lives back just that piece
[3958.96 - 3962.56] so it's like what and this isn't in
[3961.36 - 3964.08] their books you can't find this is
[3962.56 - 3965.60] medical medium information i teach
[3964.08 - 3966.80] doctors this stuff but you can't find
[3965.60 - 3968.80] this in other books
[3966.80 - 3970.80] so anyway there's chapters on anxiety
[3968.80 - 3973.44] depression adhd autism
[3970.80 - 3974.56] lyme ebv lupus fibromyalgia chronic
[3973.44 - 3977.36] fatigue syndrome
[3974.56 - 3978.16] adrenal fatigue candida gut health fruit
[3977.36 - 3981.44] fear
[3978.16 - 3983.92] menopause thyroid issues ra migraines
[3981.44 - 3985.92] shingles colitis tmj frozen shoulder i
[3983.92 - 3989.12] mean it the list goes on this book is
[3985.92 - 3990.80] crazy and it's packed and um
[3989.12 - 3993.04] so i made some spinach soup i'm gonna
[3990.80 - 3996.00] actually pour it into a bowl
[3993.04 - 3996.00] bear with me guys
[4002.16 - 4007.76] miasha he only writes books he could
[4004.72 - 4009.60] have created programs instead and change
[4007.76 - 4011.76] hundreds it charged hundreds of
[4009.60 - 4014.32] thousands of dollars for each program
[4011.76 - 4014.88] the books are all under 20 if you can't
[4014.32 - 4016.64] afford
[4014.88 - 4018.00] the book you can go to the library it's
[4016.64 - 4019.44] so true
[4018.00 - 4021.20] i can charge programs two thousand
[4019.44 - 4022.64] dollars three thousand dollars programs
[4021.20 - 4023.36] ten million people around the world
[4022.64 - 4024.80] world will
[4023.36 - 4026.48] buy those programs at two thousand
[4024.80 - 4028.08] dollars a piece put the math together
[4026.48 - 4029.60] which ten million times two hundred
[4028.08 - 4030.80] what's ten million times two two
[4029.60 - 4031.36] thousand dollars for three thousand
[4030.80 - 4033.20] dollars
[4031.36 - 4034.88] it would be an insane amount of money i
[4033.20 - 4037.36] don't want to do that to you guys i feel
[4034.88 - 4039.04] like it's unfair or not right i know
[4037.36 - 4040.88] a lot of people that would do that in a
[4039.04 - 4042.72] heartbeat i don't want to do it
[4040.88 - 4044.32] i'm not trying to say i'm just like you
[4042.72 - 4045.20] know a great guy and i just didn't want
[4044.32 - 4048.56] to do that to you it's
[4045.20 - 4051.20] because i look at it if i was sick
[4048.56 - 4053.68] would i you know what would help me
[4051.20 - 4055.60] spend two thousand dollars on a program
[4053.68 - 4056.88] and get a few bills and whistles and
[4055.60 - 4060.16] then be broke
[4056.88 - 4062.16] or a 20 book or 30 book 16
[4060.16 - 4063.20] book whatever and get the answers i need
[4062.16 - 4065.60] so i can heal
[4063.20 - 4067.52] if that was me you know what direction i
[4065.60 - 4068.16] would go and its bottom line is what it
[4067.52 - 4071.28] is
[4068.16 - 4072.80] so um put a little cilantro on top
[4071.28 - 4076.24] couple sprigs
