[3.60 - 7.84] at clubhouse
[4.56 - 11.12] celery juice kills yeah
[7.84 - 16.16] it does celery juice
[11.12 - 19.60] can kill it's interesting right
[16.16 - 20.40] what does it kill it kills the pathogens
[19.60 - 23.84] of viruses
[20.40 - 27.04] hhv-6 hhv7
[23.84 - 30.64] epstein-barr hpv
[27.04 - 34.56] sedimental virus herpes simplex
[30.64 - 37.52] 8 1 2 hh v8
[34.56 - 38.88] hhv 10 through 16. people walk around
[37.52 - 41.12] with all these different bugs
[38.88 - 43.36] they have them in them these bugs
[41.12 - 46.48] different varieties of shingles viruses
[43.36 - 48.48] different varieties of epstein-barr
[46.48 - 49.52] that gives you the fatigue and all the
[48.48 - 52.00] different vertigo
[49.52 - 53.28] tingles and numbness aches and pains
[52.00 - 56.64] celery juice
[53.28 - 58.48] kills and it kills for you
[56.64 - 60.08] it's killing for you let me just say
[58.48 - 61.76] this right just
[60.08 - 64.72] if i can just have your ear for just a
[61.76 - 68.72] second you guys okay
[64.72 - 71.52] what food out there
[68.72 - 72.56] does that much killing do they all kill
[71.52 - 76.08] for you
[72.56 - 79.44] do all the foods kill for you
[76.08 - 83.28] a lot of the foods kill you
[79.44 - 85.52] so they kill you all right
[83.28 - 87.52] and whether it's slowly whether it's
[85.52 - 91.84] like i always say death by a thousand
[87.52 - 95.20] cuts a lot of foods out there kill you
[91.84 - 97.04] slowly over time a little bit at a time
[95.20 - 100.56] a little bit of time right
[97.04 - 103.36] but what foods out there kill for you
[100.56 - 104.88] think about that like what foods what
[103.36 - 105.60] foods kill for you you guys have a
[104.88 - 108.72] clubhouse with
[105.60 - 110.72] what foods kill for you something to
[108.72 - 112.64] think about right there now
[110.72 - 115.84] medical medium talks about antiviral
[112.64 - 119.28] compounds antibacterial compounds in
[115.84 - 123.20] fruits herbs leafy greens
[119.28 - 126.48] wild foods right but there's only
[123.20 - 130.84] one herb one
[126.48 - 134.16] herb that supersedes
[130.84 - 137.36] antiviral compounds
[134.16 - 141.12] super seeds one herb
[137.36 - 144.00] and it's celery it's celery
[141.12 - 144.40] when you think about it aren't we in
[144.00 - 147.84] this
[144.40 - 150.08] plague pandemic plague
[147.84 - 152.16] everybody's been locked down all this
[150.08 - 155.52] stuff happening
[152.16 - 159.76] right because of a pathogen
[155.52 - 163.20] because of a bug a bug
[159.76 - 165.52] a virus okay and
[163.20 - 167.36] i spent decades teaching people about
[165.52 - 169.04] bugs teaching people about epstein-barr
[167.36 - 170.40] teaching people about books fc1 was
[169.04 - 171.44] forgotten about it was just tucked away
[170.40 - 172.96] it was forgotten about
[171.44 - 175.04] two amazing virologists discovered
[172.96 - 178.08] epstein-barr
[175.04 - 182.32] right and they discovered it
[178.08 - 184.56] and nobody cared nobody cared
[182.32 - 186.32] that's right all these people getting
[184.56 - 187.52] sick every day chronic illness getting
[186.32 - 189.20] sick every day
[187.52 - 190.72] all these people those people nobody
[189.20 - 194.00] knew epstein-barr
[190.72 - 197.28] did one thing nobody knew it
[194.00 - 201.04] carried on it has a long lasting
[197.28 - 204.08] lifeline in your body epstein-barr
[201.04 - 205.04] isn't just mono because research in
[204.08 - 206.88] science
[205.04 - 208.88] after two brilliant virologists
[206.88 - 209.84] discovered epstein-barr research in
[208.88 - 212.16] science
[209.84 - 215.04] just believed you had mono you get some
[212.16 - 218.16] swollen glands one time only
[215.04 - 221.52] you get a little bit of a fever you get
[218.16 - 224.88] like listlessness malaise
[221.52 - 227.68] right and that's it once it goes away
[224.88 - 230.16] it never it never matters there's no
[227.68 - 233.60] such thing as as epstein-barr
[230.16 - 234.88] medical medium information changed the
[233.60 - 238.08] world of medicine
[234.88 - 240.88] right now it did by the way this is on
[238.08 - 243.92] sale the lowest i've ever seen it's 49
[240.88 - 246.80] off amazon.com us it's 18
[243.92 - 248.08] and some change it's a medical textbook
[246.80 - 250.08] it's already saved millions of lives
[248.08 - 251.60] it's the new edition that's the one you
[250.08 - 252.24] guys the new edition just letting you
[251.60 - 254.96] know
[252.24 - 255.92] an incredible book still saving lives
[254.96 - 258.72] today
[255.92 - 260.48] it's 18 and 72 cents it costs more to
[258.72 - 263.92] print that book and make it
[260.48 - 265.60] it costs more to make it so
[263.92 - 268.00] epstein-barr was just this thing where
[265.60 - 270.80] it was mononucleosis
[268.00 - 272.96] so after after two great virologists
[270.80 - 275.12] discovered epstein-barr
[272.96 - 277.20] they discovered well that was the reason
[275.12 - 279.52] for mononucleosis
[277.20 - 282.24] that was the discovery right there but
[279.52 - 283.60] then you get mono it goes away
[282.24 - 285.52] never to worry about it ever again
[283.60 - 288.32] that's it medical medium
[285.52 - 290.16] changed all that epstein-barr
[288.32 - 292.32] reactivated epstein-barr
[290.16 - 293.76] epstein-barr causing more symptoms
[292.32 - 296.00] neurological symptoms
[293.76 - 297.52] neurological fatigue all this is all
[296.00 - 298.56] this epstein-barr information is all
[297.52 - 301.20] medical medium
[298.56 - 302.40] doctors are using it worldwide that's
[301.20 - 304.16] right
[302.40 - 305.60] they talk about it on podcasts they talk
[304.16 - 307.68] about it all over the place
[305.60 - 310.00] and it originates from the publication
[307.68 - 312.80] right here and also 35 years
[310.00 - 313.68] of work so why am i even talking about
[312.80 - 314.56] epsilon
[313.68 - 316.08] you're wondering you don't have
[314.56 - 316.96] epstein-barr you're thinking you're not
[316.08 - 319.68] who cares
[316.96 - 320.88] you don't have it everybody has it and
[319.68 - 323.12] it awaits to come out
[320.88 - 324.16] and the plague we're up against today
[323.12 - 326.80] brings it out
[324.16 - 329.92] that's medical medium information it was
[326.80 - 332.24] published first by medical medium
[329.92 - 333.76] and then it's being taken now okay and
[332.24 - 336.88] they're calling it the long haul
[333.76 - 338.72] covid now the long haul covet that's
[336.88 - 342.08] what they call it
[338.72 - 345.12] the long haul is epstein-barr
[342.08 - 348.24] and i've seen bar causing that
[345.12 - 349.84] right getting activated so i just spent
[348.24 - 351.68] years talking about how the flu
[349.84 - 352.00] activates epstein-barr how it lowers the
[351.68 - 354.56] immune
[352.00 - 355.28] immune system and activates epsom bar
[354.56 - 358.40] and then i
[355.28 - 359.52] published about how okay i published
[358.40 - 361.84] about how
[359.52 - 363.12] the plague we're up against today
[361.84 - 365.12] instigates
[363.12 - 366.88] right that's the textbook dr faun md
[365.12 - 369.36] good to see you instigates
[366.88 - 370.80] epstein barr and it comes out of
[369.36 - 373.84] dormancy
[370.80 - 373.84] hiding right
[374.00 - 377.92] and all that one of the secrets to
[376.56 - 381.12] healing
[377.92 - 383.04] so ivan says try to taking little
[381.12 - 384.48] let try taking a little less i was
[383.04 - 387.36] allergic to apple
[384.48 - 388.88] but it went away by chance by changing
[387.36 - 390.24] the liver so by actually
[388.88 - 392.56] helping your liver you're able to eat a
[390.24 - 394.96] little bit more apple
[392.56 - 396.64] anyway which is you know well if you're
[394.96 - 398.08] cleaning up all the toxins and poisons
[396.64 - 399.52] and all that you'd be surprised what you
[398.08 - 401.28] can do once you start getting rid of all
[399.52 - 403.52] those poisons and toxins and everything
[401.28 - 403.52] else
[403.92 - 408.16] so when it comes that dr faun good to
[406.16 - 409.36] see you that it's an incredible textbook
[408.16 - 412.32] really
[409.36 - 412.64] it really is incredible medical textbook
[412.32 - 414.80] and
[412.64 - 416.16] it has advanced medical information good
[414.80 - 419.36] to see you cold white spring
[416.16 - 420.08] ashley kevin kristen says i can't
[419.36 - 422.40] believe
[420.08 - 423.76] i caught you live yay you make my day i
[422.40 - 424.80] can't believe it either i'm so glad to
[423.76 - 426.96] have you here
[424.80 - 428.00] celery juice kills for you is what it
[426.96 - 431.12] does
[428.00 - 432.24] so here we are the whole world is in an
[431.12 - 434.96] uproar
[432.24 - 436.08] the whole world is in fear and chaos and
[434.96 - 439.20] panic right
[436.08 - 440.48] for a year plus right
[439.20 - 442.96] over the plague that we've been up
[440.48 - 444.72] against and then there's something out
[442.96 - 449.36] there
[444.72 - 452.72] that kills bugs kills bugs
[449.36 - 455.52] actually destroys them kills for you
[452.72 - 457.68] doesn't kill you it kills for you that's
[455.52 - 460.16] what's incredible about celery juice
[457.68 - 460.88] that's what's amazing now of course some
[460.16 - 462.80] of you might
[460.88 - 465.04] beg to differ and be like oh you can eat
[462.80 - 466.72] some celery sticks and that's kind of
[465.04 - 467.92] healthy you can have a couple of celery
[466.72 - 468.56] sticks you could chew a few celery
[467.92 - 470.80] sticks
[468.56 - 471.76] that's healthy but celery can't do
[470.80 - 474.80] anything for you
[471.76 - 476.80] it can't do anything right
[474.80 - 478.32] but we've seen something different
[476.80 - 479.84] because millions of people are drinking
[478.32 - 482.88] it getting their lives back
[479.84 - 486.00] and they're using medical devices
[482.88 - 488.88] that they don't need a prescription for
[486.00 - 490.32] right do you need a prescription for
[488.88 - 492.00] celery juice
[490.32 - 493.36] random we'll call this says celery juice
[492.00 - 495.84] lifted me out of
[493.36 - 496.80] hell of insomnia so grateful that means
[495.84 - 499.60] everything
[496.80 - 500.72] that means everything think about that
[499.60 - 502.56] right there
[500.72 - 503.84] dr sherry green good to see you the
[502.56 - 506.00] teaching information
[503.84 - 508.32] here is priceless honored you feel that
[506.00 - 511.76] way incredible doctor
[508.32 - 514.56] dr sherry green so
[511.76 - 515.84] when you really think about it okay
[514.56 - 518.32] would you
[515.84 - 519.76] like celery oh you want some celery
[518.32 - 521.36] juice well i'm going to have to write a
[519.76 - 522.56] prescription out to you
[521.36 - 525.68] i'm going to have to write a
[522.56 - 527.44] prescription you can't have celery juice
[525.68 - 529.84] you know what's crazy about our world is
[527.44 - 533.36] the medical industry
[529.84 - 534.16] with love would love to like keep
[533.36 - 537.36] everything
[534.16 - 537.92] away from you everything like celery
[537.36 - 540.96] juice
[537.92 - 543.60] and supplementation they would love
[540.96 - 544.96] to just keep it all under their watch
[543.60 - 547.76] and then prescribe
[544.96 - 549.20] a crappy version a shittier version if
[547.76 - 549.76] they really wanted to like just
[549.20 - 552.08] prescribe
[549.76 - 554.48] something like that's what they would do
[552.08 - 557.52] they're going to do it to b12
[554.48 - 558.72] they're going to do it to vitamin c in
[557.52 - 559.76] in the future people are not going to be
[558.72 - 560.72] able to get vitamin c they're not going
[559.76 - 561.12] to be able to buy i think it's going to
[560.72 - 564.24] have to be
[561.12 - 566.40] prescribed by a physician if the
[564.24 - 568.08] physician believes that it's okay to do
[566.40 - 571.92] and if the physician isn't
[568.08 - 573.52] watched isn't watched
[571.92 - 575.68] meaning like watched because they're
[573.52 - 576.72] prescribing too much vitamin c
[575.68 - 579.28] so they're going to be they're going to
[576.72 - 581.76] be under limitations where
[579.28 - 584.24] where doctors down the road years down
[581.76 - 586.08] the road mark my word right here
[584.24 - 588.64] years down the road doctors are going to
[586.08 - 592.48] be they're going to be prescribing
[588.64 - 596.00] vitamin c and it's small dosages
[592.48 - 599.20] like okay 250 milligrams a day
[596.00 - 601.12] one tablet here you go
[599.20 - 602.96] big pharma took over the vitamin c they
[601.12 - 605.36] own it now here you go
[602.96 - 606.48] that's how it's going to go no one's
[605.36 - 610.08] going to be able to get better
[606.48 - 612.40] like that but that's how they want it
[610.08 - 613.52] because if you're rogue if you're doing
[612.40 - 617.20] things
[613.52 - 617.60] your way you're rogue that's what you
[617.20 - 620.72] are
[617.60 - 623.04] you're rogue and because right now we're
[620.72 - 624.64] allowed to take vitamin c
[623.04 - 626.64] you know that's what i take is the
[624.64 - 629.12] microc right there
[626.64 - 629.84] but we're allowed to take vitamin c we
[629.12 - 631.92] are
[629.84 - 633.20] i take a whole bunch you can ask your
[631.92 - 634.96] doctor what's right for you i'm just
[633.20 - 639.44] telling you for me and my family
[634.96 - 642.24] we take a lot of it we take a lot of it
[639.44 - 643.44] so but eventually down the road it's all
[642.24 - 644.88] going to be taken away from everybody
[643.44 - 646.08] way down the road
[644.88 - 648.24] and it's going to be under prescription
[646.08 - 649.36] only and it's going to be a real crappy
[648.24 - 650.56] kind
[649.36 - 652.40] and they're going to be like here's
[650.56 - 653.68] here's your prescribed dosage is all you
[652.40 - 654.80] can take right there
[653.68 - 656.64] that's what's going to happen down the
[654.80 - 658.64] road just giving everybody the 4-1-1
[656.64 - 660.24] same thing with b12
[658.64 - 662.48] not going to have the freedom down the
[660.24 - 664.24] road to just have b12
[662.48 - 666.00] because science research and big pharma
[664.24 - 667.44] and powers at b
[666.00 - 669.52] and powers above and all the
[667.44 - 671.52] illuminations
[669.52 - 673.76] the illuminations are going to make sure
[671.52 - 675.44] they have full control over our b12 too
[673.76 - 677.68] so you get the crappy kind and it's
[675.44 - 681.44] prescribed by only prescription
[677.68 - 685.44] probably through shot only b12 shot
[681.44 - 686.00] b12 shot and i told you guys about the
[685.44 - 689.28] b12
[686.00 - 690.56] shots you can do what you want do your
[689.28 - 693.60] doctor tells you
[690.56 - 695.44] but i would never let vitamin b12 go
[693.60 - 696.56] into my arm through an ejection and
[695.44 - 700.96] through an injection
[696.56 - 705.36] ever ever ever vitamin b12
[700.96 - 708.64] that's just me personally and my family
[705.36 - 711.04] and but
[708.64 - 713.12] down the road it's different when it
[711.04 - 714.40] goes into the vein when b12 goes into
[713.12 - 718.08] intravenous
[714.40 - 719.84] vitamins the vein is different so
[718.08 - 723.36] if you're getting intravenous iv
[719.84 - 725.44] vitamins if you're someone like that
[723.36 - 726.80] and you're getting vitamin b through the
[725.44 - 730.08] veins
[726.80 - 733.92] that's different but through an actual
[730.08 - 737.28] injection a shot right
[733.92 - 740.64] i would never get b12 ever
[737.28 - 745.44] injected into the body like
[740.64 - 747.12] from the outside the vein is different
[745.44 - 748.64] go back to what i was saying and because
[747.12 - 749.12] what happens is when you get when you
[748.64 - 752.72] get

[761.20 - 764.88] i've talked about this in the past your
[762.96 - 768.08] body can build an
[764.88 - 773.60] antibody against b12
[768.08 - 776.40] making you in trouble with b12
[773.60 - 778.24] if you had that before it's okay that
[776.40 - 780.00] can be turned around
[778.24 - 781.84] go to your doctor and you say hey i only
[780.00 - 785.52] i only want to be on b12
[781.84 - 787.68] oral b12 you can change

[809.20 - 813.52] in a needle going into the body into the
[811.44 - 817.04] arm into the leg into the butt
[813.52 - 819.12] whatever that's me personally

[819.12 - 824.08] oral b12
[821.60 - 824.88] and as far as vitamin c goes enjoy it
[824.08 - 828.40] why it's

[828.40 - 831.68] but enjoy it why it's here so why am i
[830.24 - 832.40] talking about this a lot of people
[831.68 - 833.84] aren't going to be
[832.40 - 836.72] are going to have the access to vitamin
[833.84 - 839.92] c years down the road

[839.92 - 843.84] still going to have celery access for a
[841.52 - 847.04] while i really believe that
[843.84 - 848.96] and eventually that's going to get weird
[847.04 - 850.88] and they're going to halt the farming
[848.96 - 853.52] productions down they're going to
[850.88 - 854.32] put orders to make sure farms aren't
[853.52 - 857.04] allowed to
[854.32 - 858.56] grow that much celery probably gonna
[857.04 - 861.44] spin some lies
[858.56 - 863.52] that celery crops are damaging the
[861.44 - 866.72] planet

[1093.52 - 1096.48] you guys i want to i want to update
[1095.04 - 1097.84] everybody that just came on austin good
[1096.48 - 1099.28] to see you
[1097.84 - 1101.36] much light and love really good to see
[1099.28 - 1102.88] you too um every now and then when i
[1101.36 - 1103.52] catch your comments in the youtube
[1102.88 - 1106.84] section
[1103.52 - 1108.40] right good to see you guys dr chicken
[1106.84 - 1111.20] marissa
[1108.40 - 1113.04] and so let's go into this a little bit
[1111.20 - 1114.64] more we have information to cover
[1113.04 - 1116.80] they want to erwin says they want to
[1114.64 - 1118.32] keep us sick they have to keep us sick
[1116.80 - 1120.88] the industries have to keep you sick
[1118.32 - 1124.40] that's how it works and
[1120.88 - 1127.20] one way you know is that there are
[1124.40 - 1128.96] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[1127.20 - 1130.24] of healing stories of celery juice
[1128.96 - 1133.92] helping people get out
[1130.24 - 1135.28] of the woods and into the light right
[1133.92 - 1137.68] but the industry they just they don't
[1135.28 - 1141.12] want to know about that they don't
[1137.68 - 1144.16] because because god forbid we hurt their
[1141.12 - 1145.20] pockets we hurt the yachts that they
[1144.16 - 1146.88] ride on
[1145.20 - 1148.24] and we hear about all of it we hurt
[1146.88 - 1151.52] their pockets
[1148.24 - 1154.64] right massive massive mansions all that
[1151.52 - 1156.08] built by people being sick right people
[1154.64 - 1158.32] being sick
[1156.08 - 1159.76] and so celery juice is one of these
[1158.32 - 1161.76] things that's really helpful so here we
[1159.76 - 1164.24] go we got a plague
[1161.76 - 1165.28] circling the planet right everybody's
[1164.24 - 1168.96] worried about it
[1165.28 - 1172.24] right and has been worried about it
[1168.96 - 1175.12] and we have a bug killer
[1172.24 - 1176.96] at the grocery store so we have a bug
[1175.12 - 1180.88] killer at the grocery store
[1176.96 - 1183.28] because celery juice kills
[1180.88 - 1184.08] it kills it's really incredible when you
[1183.28 - 1185.44] think about it
[1184.08 - 1187.12] i just want to look i want to cover a
[1185.44 - 1190.32] couple little things you guys
[1187.12 - 1191.28] first of all the mm-900 hds i don't know
[1190.32 - 1194.96] if you guys
[1191.28 - 1197.92] have seen this user mm-900 hds
[1194.96 - 1198.48] um anyway it's 82 off just letting you
[1197.92 - 1201.60] guys know
[1198.48 - 1204.72] it's still on sale 25 off um
[1201.60 - 1206.08] letting people know so in case someone
[1204.72 - 1207.44] this is their chance or something
[1206.08 - 1209.04] at this time because it's such a break
[1207.44 - 1211.12] on there if you got any juice or use it
[1209.04 - 1213.20] because your juicer is a medical tool
[1211.12 - 1214.72] keep that in mind
[1213.20 - 1216.00] people ask me all the time what juicer
[1214.72 - 1217.52] do i use with juicer what do you mean
[1216.00 - 1218.80] it's a medical tool what do you mean
[1217.52 - 1220.64] the minute i said that everybody's like
[1218.80 - 1221.60] what do you mean it's it's a medical
[1220.64 - 1223.68] tool
[1221.60 - 1225.68] i see it as a medical tool that's my
[1223.68 - 1228.16] opinion
[1225.68 - 1230.48] i i wonder what your your opinion is you
[1228.16 - 1232.48] guys but my opinion is
[1230.48 - 1234.16] it's a medical tool i talk to doctors
[1232.48 - 1236.80] all the time and i'm like
[1234.16 - 1239.12] look it's a medical tool like how is it
[1236.80 - 1242.32] a medical tool
[1239.12 - 1246.48] it's created to extract
[1242.32 - 1250.08] herbal medicine so herbal medicine
[1246.48 - 1251.68] it extracts herbal medicine so we can do
[1250.08 - 1254.88] some healing
[1251.68 - 1257.92] ernest says omega h um omega
[1254.88 - 1259.84] mm 900 hds is the best juicer ever
[1257.92 - 1262.24] it really is it really is i'm going to
[1259.84 - 1263.68] do some juicing in a minute to you guys
[1262.24 - 1265.52] what i like about the juicer is it pays
[1263.68 - 1266.88] for itself i told you that before
[1265.52 - 1268.80] sound like a broken record the other
[1266.88 - 1269.52] reason i like it is because it's not
[1268.80 - 1272.88] dealing with
[1269.52 - 1274.48] metal always touching metal so that's a
[1272.88 - 1277.84] juice there's a lot of juicers out there
[1274.48 - 1279.60] there's so much metal everywhere and so
[1277.84 - 1281.68] and that metal just starts to kind of
[1279.60 - 1283.44] corrode that's what metal does it
[1281.68 - 1285.76] corrodes
[1283.44 - 1287.28] it it eventually starts to break down
[1285.76 - 1289.20] that's what metal does
[1287.28 - 1290.56] and so that's what i don't like you know
[1289.20 - 1292.72] about the other juicers
[1290.56 - 1294.08] this doesn't have that crystal clear
[1292.72 - 1296.48] says
[1294.08 - 1298.40] it really is a miracle i was miserable
[1296.48 - 1300.48] every year with hay fever
[1298.40 - 1302.16] and it made it disappear for real so if
[1300.48 - 1304.96] celery juice
[1302.16 - 1306.08] made something that was keeping you
[1304.96 - 1309.28] miserable
[1306.08 - 1311.52] every single year the worst hay fever
[1309.28 - 1313.44] and it got rid of that what do you think
[1311.52 - 1316.96] is going on there
[1313.44 - 1319.84] one reason is hay fever
[1316.96 - 1320.96] really is something else right you get
[1319.84 - 1324.48] sensitive
[1320.96 - 1327.76] to plants to weeds that are growing
[1324.48 - 1329.36] you get sensitive to pollen you get
[1327.76 - 1333.68] sensitive to dust
[1329.36 - 1337.52] grass dust right it gets sensitive to
[1333.68 - 1339.92] to um pine pollen okay
[1337.52 - 1342.80] oak tree pollen maple pump you get
[1339.92 - 1344.88] sensitive to all the pollen right
[1342.80 - 1346.00] and then but one of the reasons why is
[1344.88 - 1348.00] because there's something else
[1346.00 - 1349.92] underlying so whenever it comes down to
[1348.00 - 1352.16] allergies and stuff like that sinus
[1349.92 - 1352.88] allergies where it's eye related sinus
[1352.16 - 1355.52] related
[1352.88 - 1356.64] hay fever in the head all that stuff in
[1355.52 - 1358.56] the lungs you're dealing with
[1356.64 - 1360.64] streptococcus
[1358.56 - 1362.48] and then you start bringing celery in
[1360.64 - 1365.36] and you start killing the strep
[1362.48 - 1367.20] and when you start killing the strep you
[1365.36 - 1370.88] can all of a sudden handle
[1367.20 - 1374.72] that ragweed you can handle all that
[1370.88 - 1376.16] white ragweed all that hay
[1374.72 - 1378.16] and that's what's incredible about it
[1376.16 - 1381.92] right there
[1378.16 - 1385.04] um love god celery juice stopped my
[1381.92 - 1387.12] colitis symptoms in a week

[1488.72 - 1493.44] you're looking at your adrenals
[1490.64 - 1495.44] and what i love about celery juice is
[1493.44 - 1497.04] celery is used to something absolutely
[1495.44 - 1501.28] amazing
[1497.04 - 1503.52] it helps restore your adrenal glands
[1501.28 - 1505.04] just like it helps to restore your
[1503.52 - 1507.12] stomach lens remember the other day you
[1505.04 - 1508.96] guys
[1507.12 - 1510.16] remember the other day talking about the
[1508.96 - 1513.92] stomach
[1510.16 - 1515.68] right about the stomach and the stomach
[1513.92 - 1517.20] glands that's your hcl
[1515.68 - 1519.12] cellular juice helps to bring your
[1517.20 - 1521.92] depleted stomach glands back
[1519.12 - 1524.32] rebuilding your hcl so your hcl could
[1521.92 - 1528.40] then kill pathogens
[1524.32 - 1530.80] right yeah renata says it's the adrenals
[1528.40 - 1534.08] my poor mom has adrenal cancer
[1530.80 - 1536.80] i'm so sorry to hear that um
[1534.08 - 1539.68] that's really difficult to to i mean she
[1536.80 - 1539.68] must be struggling
[1540.16 - 1545.04] so what happens is these stomach glands
[1543.12 - 1546.80] um
[1545.04 - 1548.32] they restore from that celery juice now
[1546.80 - 1549.92] something else restores from that soy
[1548.32 - 1552.16] juice
[1549.92 - 1553.20] it's your adrenal glands so that's the
[1552.16 - 1555.20] next thing
[1553.20 - 1557.28] so the sodium cluster salts the trace
[1555.20 - 1560.08] mineral salts and celery juice
[1557.28 - 1562.40] go into your stomach glands and help
[1560.08 - 1565.44] restore it
[1562.40 - 1569.12] and then celery juice goes into
[1565.44 - 1571.20] adrenal tissue as well and helps restore
[1569.12 - 1572.64] it because
[1571.20 - 1575.52] that's when they get depleted when they
[1572.64 - 1578.72] get deleted they lose trace minerals
[1575.52 - 1582.32] the cells in your adrenals need
[1578.72 - 1584.88] a certain amount of trace minerals
[1582.32 - 1586.80] and we lose those trace minerals we're
[1584.88 - 1587.60] not getting them in good sources in good
[1586.80 - 1589.44] places
[1587.60 - 1591.28] we're under fight or flight we're
[1589.44 - 1594.56] tanking the caffeine
[1591.28 - 1597.28] we're taking the caffeine guys don't mat
[1594.56 - 1598.80] you guys don't guys don't mind i'm gonna
[1597.28 - 1600.24] do a little coffee break and i'm gonna
[1598.80 - 1602.00] have a little chocolate too
[1600.24 - 1603.28] so you guys are okay with that so let's
[1602.00 - 1604.72] just take everybody
[1603.28 - 1607.04] everybody i'm just gonna take a break
[1604.72 - 1608.08] i'm gonna i'm gonna hold off talking and
[1607.04 - 1610.08] i'm just gonna have a little bit of
[1608.08 - 1613.84] coffee
[1610.08 - 1616.88] gotta have my coffee
[1613.84 - 1616.88] god coffee is good
[1617.20 - 1621.36] guys i'm on coffee break you guys and uh
[1619.92 - 1622.16] i'm about to have a piece of chocolate
[1621.36 - 1624.00] too
[1622.16 - 1626.16] chris chris you seem fine of me you want
[1624.00 - 1629.20] a piece of chocolate with me
[1626.16 - 1629.52] we're on coffee break right now all
[1629.20 - 1632.32] right
[1629.52 - 1634.48] just one more sip i gotta get high i got
[1632.32 - 1634.48] it
[1635.68 - 1640.56] it's actually really good that's really
[1636.88 - 1641.84] good coffee too incredible
[1640.56 - 1643.68] one thing to know about our adrenal
[1641.84 - 1647.60] glands is coffee is like its number one
[1643.68 - 1648.72] enemy chocolate it's it's number one
[1647.60 - 1650.32] enemy too
[1648.72 - 1652.08] so the reason why we lose our adrenals
[1650.32 - 1653.12] over time and women lose their hair
[1652.08 - 1655.68] because women are not supposed to have
[1653.12 - 1658.24] hair loss they lose their hair
[1655.68 - 1659.20] and their skin gets aged before it's
[1658.24 - 1662.08] time
[1659.20 - 1663.44] part of that is the adrenals dying the
[1662.08 - 1666.16] adrenals die
[1663.44 - 1667.20] so what happens is when we're aging
[1666.16 - 1670.40] there's parts of us
[1667.20 - 1673.04] inside of us that are actually dying our
[1670.40 - 1677.12] liver starts to die
[1673.04 - 1678.32] yeah and organs can die before we die do
[1677.12 - 1679.28] you ever guys ever notice that
[1678.32 - 1681.68] why do you think somebody can have a
[1679.28 - 1682.00] heart condition and when someone has
[1681.68 - 1684.24] heart
[1682.00 - 1685.20] failure yeah and they're told they have
[1684.24 - 1686.88] heart failure right
[1685.20 - 1689.12] well it's like when you get diagnosed
[1686.88 - 1692.00] with heart failure what does that mean
[1689.12 - 1693.68] that means you're alive that means
[1692.00 - 1696.80] you're alive
[1693.68 - 1700.48] but your heart's dying right it's sick
[1696.80 - 1702.32] think about that i mean isn't that crazy
[1700.48 - 1705.28] how it works
[1702.32 - 1708.00] we're alive we're living our lives and
[1705.28 - 1711.44] organs in us
[1708.00 - 1714.88] can start to die
[1711.44 - 1717.12] and so what happens with adrenals
[1714.88 - 1720.16] that's one of those glands that
[1717.12 - 1720.16] endocrine system glands
[1720.80 - 1725.04] those start to die slowly but you don't
[1724.40 - 1728.48] want them
[1725.04 - 1730.24] dying before we die you see how it works
[1728.48 - 1732.80] i know this is intense to talk about you
[1730.24 - 1736.08] don't want your adrenal glands
[1732.80 - 1739.84] to putting before you
[1736.08 - 1739.84] ever kaput in your life right
[1740.96 - 1745.44] and so what happens with caffeine
[1744.48 - 1746.96] i know i'm giving you guys a little
[1745.44 - 1747.92] caffeine talk for a couple seconds you
[1746.96 - 1751.84] guys love that
[1747.92 - 1752.96] right caffeine destroys our adrenal
[1751.84 - 1754.32] glands
[1752.96 - 1756.32] i get it you know somebody who drank
[1754.32 - 1757.60] coffee for 30 years they're fine i get
[1756.32 - 1759.04] it
[1757.60 - 1760.32] a lot of people drink coffee for two
[1759.04 - 1762.64] years and they're not fine they blew out
[1760.32 - 1765.52] their adrenals
[1762.64 - 1767.04] yeah a lot of people eat chocolate they
[1765.52 - 1768.64] burn out their adrenals
[1767.04 - 1770.32] but it's the caffeine you know the
[1768.64 - 1774.16] matcha tea or the chocolate
[1770.32 - 1776.32] the coffee that caffeine
[1774.16 - 1777.68] burns out our adrenals so you got to
[1776.32 - 1778.96] think about your adrenals because
[1777.68 - 1780.56] without them we
[1778.96 - 1783.28] really are we're in trouble with outer
[1780.56 - 1786.08] adrenals we're in big trouble
[1783.28 - 1787.20] and if you're drinking your celery juice
[1786.08 - 1787.76] and somebody says why are you drinking
[1787.20 - 1789.12] your celery
[1787.76 - 1791.04] are you drinking celery juice because of
[1789.12 - 1794.00] that crazy medical medium
[1791.04 - 1797.28] because uh that guy who's a medium who
[1794.00 - 1798.72] talks to a spirit
[1797.28 - 1800.80] why are you drinking celery you're
[1798.72 - 1802.32] drinking celery juice
[1800.80 - 1804.88] because you want to keep your adrenals
[1802.32 - 1806.80] strong you want those restored you want
[1804.88 - 1810.48] those recovered
[1806.80 - 1813.28] you want your adrenals to come back
[1810.48 - 1815.28] you want them strong you want them
[1813.28 - 1817.20] strong
[1815.28 - 1818.80] so it's so important so let's talk about
[1817.20 - 1821.60] how celery juice does that i'm going to
[1818.80 - 1822.96] juice a little bit of celery now
[1821.60 - 1824.80] we're going to go into that for a little
[1822.96 - 1826.64] bit you guys
[1824.80 - 1828.56] talking about restoring the adrenals
[1826.64 - 1833.28] we're talking about how celery juice
[1828.56 - 1836.32] kills because it does
[1833.28 - 1839.84] it does it kills the bugs
[1836.32 - 1839.84] that are inside of everybody
[1839.92 - 1843.36] i can't tell you how many years i've
[1842.08 - 1845.04] been teaching about all the different
[1843.36 - 1846.00] viruses and bacteria and what they do
[1845.04 - 1848.32] and what they cause
[1846.00 - 1849.52] and i've i've i've talked to a lot of
[1848.32 - 1851.44] deaf ears
[1849.52 - 1853.04] people just it's gone right it's just
[1851.44 - 1854.40] like they're they're not even hearing it
[1853.04 - 1855.44] professionals i've talked to a lot of
[1854.40 - 1858.48] professionals we're like
[1855.44 - 1860.08] there's no way there's no way pathogens
[1858.48 - 1860.96] have anything to do with anything
[1860.08 - 1863.20] there's no way
[1860.96 - 1864.72] and then and then the whole world shuts
[1863.20 - 1867.76] down
[1864.72 - 1868.40] over a pathogen now you got all these
[1867.76 - 1870.08] people
[1868.40 - 1872.48] they're not being held accounted
[1870.08 - 1873.52] accountable for being so ignorant about
[1872.48 - 1875.52] pathogens
[1873.52 - 1876.56] and now they're they're they're viral
[1875.52 - 1880.72] experts now
[1876.56 - 1882.88] everybody's a virus expert now
[1880.72 - 1884.16] when two years ago they didn't even
[1882.88 - 1885.84] think they existed
[1884.16 - 1887.76] but now they're but no one's holding
[1885.84 - 1889.92] anybody accountable and say hey buddy
[1887.76 - 1892.48] you know what you didn't even think
[1889.92 - 1896.08] pathogens existed a year and a half ago
[1892.48 - 1898.00] why are you such the expert now exactly
[1896.08 - 1899.36] in this world right now you don't have
[1898.00 - 1901.52] to be held accountable
[1899.36 - 1902.40] you can just totally screw up in the
[1901.52 - 1904.48] health realm
[1902.40 - 1906.24] over and over and over again be a
[1904.48 - 1908.40] podcast person
[1906.24 - 1909.28] be you know be be a different health
[1908.40 - 1911.20] authority
[1909.28 - 1913.36] and you can just make mistake after
[1911.20 - 1915.44] mistake no one's saying hey
[1913.36 - 1918.16] you just screwed up because two years
[1915.44 - 1921.36] ago you believed
[1918.16 - 1922.72] that celery juice was you know was
[1921.36 - 1924.40] terrible for you
[1922.72 - 1926.24] now you're thinking it might be helpful
[1924.40 - 1928.24] it's like dude own up to how you were
[1926.24 - 1929.92] ripping it apart all that time
[1928.24 - 1932.16] it goes it goes like that for anything
[1929.92 - 1934.80] though own up how
[1932.16 - 1936.88] you didn't even think viruses existed
[1934.80 - 1939.92] and now you've been pushed into
[1936.88 - 1943.36] pushed into it the media and
[1939.92 - 1945.20] and and the pandemic has made it so now
[1943.36 - 1947.04] you're open to viruses but
[1945.20 - 1948.48] meanwhile you've had patients in your
[1947.04 - 1950.16] office
[1948.48 - 1953.04] for years and you wouldn't even like
[1950.16 - 1956.56] listen about the viral stuff
[1953.04 - 1959.12] so uh patrice bennett says

[2056.16 - 2060.96] so i want to cover a couple of things
[2058.84 - 2063.12] today
[2060.96 - 2065.76] one is about restoring your adrenals how
[2063.12 - 2065.76] critical it is
[2066.80 - 2070.72] it's one of the things that we have to
[2068.24 - 2073.20] be mindful about take care of
[2070.72 - 2074.96] we have to look after if celery juice is
[2073.20 - 2076.88] the only thing you can do when you can't
[2074.96 - 2077.52] do anything else there's nothing you can
[2076.88 - 2079.84] do
[2077.52 - 2081.36] you can't do anything else that then
[2079.84 - 2081.84] then you're doing celery juice it's
[2081.36 - 2083.28] amazing
[2081.84 - 2085.84] it's really incredible you're helping
[2083.28 - 2087.76] your adrenals
[2085.84 - 2090.24] your adrenals are why you can even
[2087.76 - 2093.52] function talk on the phone
[2090.24 - 2097.04] live your life do your house chores
[2093.52 - 2103.84] work work a career talk to friends go
[2097.04 - 2103.84] out your adrenals
[2104.48 - 2108.08] talk about kidney stones for a little
[2105.92 - 2111.44] bit
[2108.08 - 2116.08] do that cover kidney stones
[2111.44 - 2118.64] everybody has kidney stones by the way
[2116.08 - 2119.77] everybody has kidney sediment kidney
[2118.64 - 2121.28] stones
[2119.77 - 2123.28] [Applause]
[2121.28 - 2125.68] it's just how big do you want them to
[2123.28 - 2126.88] get that's the key right how big you
[2125.68 - 2128.96] want them to get
[2126.88 - 2130.00] if you're somebody that it has dealt
[2128.96 - 2131.92] with like the bigger
[2130.00 - 2133.12] kidney stones big ones where they're
[2131.92 - 2137.44] registerable
[2133.12 - 2138.96] they can be seen right through testing
[2137.44 - 2140.64] did you want to stay off the animal
[2138.96 - 2143.68] protein
[2140.64 - 2145.52] i'm not anti-animal protein okay i'm not
[2143.68 - 2147.68] anti-plant-based either
[2145.52 - 2149.92] i support both sides of the aisle always
[2147.68 - 2149.92] have
[2150.56 - 2156.96] i don't judge anybody either way
[2155.20 - 2159.44] i know the animal protein people when
[2156.96 - 2160.95] they get irritated they'll say the vegan
[2159.44 - 2163.04] mommies are starving their kids
[2160.95 - 2165.92] [Music]
[2163.04 - 2167.20] i know starving of a protein i know the
[2165.92 - 2169.84] plant-based
[2167.20 - 2171.20] people will get mad at the animal
[2169.84 - 2172.88] protein people
[2171.20 - 2174.48] say they have a lack of understanding
[2172.88 - 2178.08] about you know
[2174.48 - 2178.08] animals having souls and stuff
[2178.16 - 2182.00] but too much protein kills the kidney
[2180.24 - 2182.48] and you can kill the kidneys too as a
[2182.00 - 2183.60] vegan
[2182.48 - 2185.84] you can kill your kidneys as a
[2183.60 - 2187.20] plant-based person you can do too many
[2185.84 - 2190.16] nut butters
[2187.20 - 2191.68] right you can kill your kidneys with too
[2190.16 - 2193.52] much fat
[2191.68 - 2194.88] definitely too much protein we can kill
[2193.52 - 2196.80] our kidneys but
[2194.88 - 2198.96] the thing is right i'm gonna take this
[2196.80 - 2200.96] kidney apart you guys
[2198.96 - 2202.32] okay those kidney stones they started
[2200.96 - 2204.24] really tiny and they sit in the nooks
[2202.32 - 2205.92] and crannies of your kidney
[2204.24 - 2207.04] right in the little nooks and crannies
[2205.92 - 2208.00] that's what they do they start out
[2207.04 - 2209.76] really tiny
[2208.00 - 2211.44] and they start to grow kidney stones
[2209.76 - 2213.84] actually grow
[2211.44 - 2215.36] they become like a magnet actually and
[2213.84 - 2218.64] they collect more sediment
[2215.36 - 2221.28] and more sediment and more sediment
[2218.64 - 2222.32] but the kidney stones are really an
[2221.28 - 2225.52] indication
[2222.32 - 2226.88] that you got two options you got calcium
[2225.52 - 2227.76] based stones you got protein based
[2226.88 - 2229.52] stones
[2227.76 - 2231.44] you can have a mix you can have calcium
[2229.52 - 2233.60] protein-based stones
[2231.44 - 2235.20] but let me give you like a couple of
[2233.60 - 2236.56] takeaways just right off the bat this
[2235.20 - 2238.00] might be worth the price of admission
[2236.56 - 2240.64] even though all this is free
[2238.00 - 2241.52] it's always free here at medical medium
[2240.64 - 2243.28] but
[2241.52 - 2244.64] if you're dealing with a calcium-based
[2243.28 - 2248.24] stone
[2244.64 - 2250.16] the caffeine the vinegar
[2248.24 - 2252.56] that will take you down that road
[2250.16 - 2256.40] because the caffeine and the vinegar
[2252.56 - 2257.44] will suck the life out of your bones and
[2256.40 - 2260.96] teeth
[2257.44 - 2261.84] it'll pull in pull pull but actually
[2260.96 - 2264.40] pull out
[2261.84 - 2265.92] all that good calcium okay it's one
[2264.40 - 2267.52] thing that happens too
[2265.92 - 2269.44] another thing that happens is if you're
[2267.52 - 2271.60] eating dairy products
[2269.44 - 2272.48] if you're eating eggs if you're eating
[2271.60 - 2275.60] too much dairy
[2272.48 - 2278.16] milk cheese butter then you can also get
[2275.60 - 2279.68] a calcium stone from all of that
[2278.16 - 2281.44] but you can get a calcium stone from
[2279.68 - 2282.56] either calcium being removed from your
[2281.44 - 2284.56] bones
[2282.56 - 2285.92] and teeth and it ends up piling up in
[2284.56 - 2287.68] the kidneys
[2285.92 - 2289.04] so when you're doing your caffeine when
[2287.68 - 2292.24] you're doing your coffee
[2289.04 - 2293.52] when you're doing your chocolate
[2292.24 - 2298.72] right when you're doing your coffee and
[2293.52 - 2300.80] you're doing your chocolate
[2298.72 - 2301.84] you're actually removing calcium from
[2300.80 - 2303.60] your bones
[2301.84 - 2305.28] so let me get something else for you
[2303.60 - 2308.72] guys you guys are still here
[2305.28 - 2313.52] don't worry still here
[2308.72 - 2316.16] still mashing it we're still here
[2313.52 - 2317.84] okay right here i got a jaw for you tik
[2316.16 - 2318.48] tok can you guys see this clubhouse i'm
[2317.84 - 2321.36] holding
[2318.48 - 2324.32] a jaw that's a big tongue right here so
[2321.36 - 2327.44] if you guys could see that big tongue
[2324.32 - 2330.48] so that's the lower jaw
[2327.44 - 2331.36] okay that's the bone the jaw bone that's
[2330.48 - 2333.60] your teeth
[2331.36 - 2336.80] okay guys so when you're doing your cat
[2333.60 - 2339.68] when you're doing your caffeine
[2336.80 - 2340.08] you're drawing calcium from inside your
[2339.68 - 2343.12] teeth
[2340.08 - 2344.64] and your jaw that calcium that gets
[2343.12 - 2345.28] drawn out ends up piling inside your
[2344.64 - 2347.60] kidneys
[2345.28 - 2349.28] i'm pointing to your kidney now so it
[2347.60 - 2350.88] ends up becoming little calcium stones
[2349.28 - 2352.56] inside your kidney
[2350.88 - 2354.00] calcium stones that can't be seen on
[2352.56 - 2356.16] testing tiny
[2354.00 - 2358.08] ones lots of tiny ones and you pee them
[2356.16 - 2359.68] out
[2358.08 - 2360.96] a lot of them don't build up they don't
[2359.68 - 2363.20] get caught in there and they don't
[2360.96 - 2364.72] become a big old calcium kidney stone
[2363.20 - 2366.80] they get caught in there and then you
[2364.72 - 2368.00] build them up build them up build them
[2366.80 - 2370.16] up because they get caught in there you
[2368.00 - 2373.20] guys and caught in there right
[2370.16 - 2374.48] so what's happening is you keep on doing
[2373.20 - 2375.84] your caffeine you keep on doing your
[2374.48 - 2377.12] chocolate you keep on doing your plant
[2375.84 - 2378.24] medicine chocolate you keep on doing
[2377.12 - 2379.92] your matcha tea
[2378.24 - 2383.20] what you do is you keep on drawing
[2379.92 - 2386.80] calcium from your teeth and your jaw
[2383.20 - 2390.32] and your bones right
[2386.80 - 2391.92] you keep on drawing that and then
[2390.32 - 2393.36] it ends up in the kidney now when it
[2391.92 - 2395.44] ends up in the kidney you get these tiny
[2393.36 - 2396.08] little calcium deposits crystallized
[2395.44 - 2397.92] calcium
[2396.08 - 2399.12] in your kidneys and you urinate them out
[2397.92 - 2400.88] most of them out
[2399.12 - 2402.72] you think hey i'm pretty good right now
[2400.88 - 2403.84] i don't have i don't have any kidney
[2402.72 - 2405.84] stones
[2403.84 - 2408.00] nothing that seeable but you have the
[2405.84 - 2410.96] everyday kidney stones
[2408.00 - 2412.64] which nobody talks about nobody talks
[2410.96 - 2414.16] about the crystallizations that form
[2412.64 - 2414.88] there every single day because of the
[2414.16 - 2416.56] caffeine
[2414.88 - 2418.80] because of your chocolate because of
[2416.56 - 2420.56] your tea and
[2418.80 - 2423.28] all those little crystallizations they
[2420.56 - 2425.68] all deposit inside that kidney
[2423.28 - 2427.84] and here's what's sad about it you're
[2425.68 - 2431.12] pissing out
[2427.84 - 2433.20] your critical needed your your calcium
[2431.12 - 2434.64] your own calcium the calcium that holds
[2433.20 - 2436.32] your bones together you're peeing your
[2434.64 - 2439.44] own calcium out
[2436.32 - 2442.56] you're you're pissing out that's
[2439.44 - 2443.92] how it goes so okay i don't have a
[2442.56 - 2445.36] kidney stone right now everything's all
[2443.92 - 2446.48] clear it looks good no kidney stones
[2445.36 - 2447.92] than me
[2446.48 - 2449.76] meanwhile you're peeing out lots of
[2447.92 - 2450.96] kidney stones every single day lots of
[2449.76 - 2452.24] kidney stones you're peeing out all your
[2450.96 - 2453.84] calcium stones
[2452.24 - 2456.64] calcium stones that are created because
[2453.84 - 2460.56] it's just being sucked out of your jaw
[2456.64 - 2461.84] being sucked out of your lower jaw
[2460.56 - 2463.84] being sucked out of your bones that's
[2461.84 - 2467.28] why women go to osteopenia it's why they
[2463.84 - 2470.64] head there just letting you guys know so
[2467.28 - 2470.64] your coffee every day
[2470.80 - 2476.96] slowly draws the calcium out
[2474.56 - 2478.08] and then we do too much fat and too much
[2476.96 - 2480.72] protein and we
[2478.08 - 2482.88] kill our kidneys it's another thing too
[2480.72 - 2484.48] we kill our kidneys
[2482.88 - 2486.24] then too much fat and protein can bring
[2484.48 - 2488.56] some calcium out of your bones as well
[2486.24 - 2490.32] but now let's go into the vinegar really
[2488.56 - 2490.88] quick the apple cider vinegar or any
[2490.32 - 2492.40] kind of
[2490.88 - 2494.88] vinegar red wine vinegar balsamic
[2492.40 - 2498.96] vinegar whatever vinegar you want
[2494.88 - 2500.32] vinegar draws acetic acid draws calcium
[2498.96 - 2503.20] from your bones and teeth too
[2500.32 - 2504.64] and then this tires your kidneys out so
[2503.20 - 2506.40] when i see somebody eating vinegar i'm
[2504.64 - 2508.24] like you're tiring your kidneys out
[2506.40 - 2510.16] sure you don't see it in the moment but
[2508.24 - 2511.68] you're going to see it 30 years from now
[2510.16 - 2513.68] 20 years from now you're going to see it
[2511.68 - 2515.04] somewhere down the line
[2513.68 - 2516.64] and one thing spirit of compassion
[2515.04 - 2518.16] taught me when i was younger is how to
[2516.64 - 2518.88] have that foresight how to see
[2518.16 - 2521.44] everything
[2518.88 - 2523.04] how to like know and see so again you
[2521.44 - 2524.48] see somebody and spirit of compassion
[2523.04 - 2526.80] will tell me well yeah they have
[2524.48 - 2528.88] about eight crystals in their kidneys
[2526.80 - 2531.84] today they have to pee and urinate those
[2528.88 - 2531.84] eight crystals out today
[2532.08 - 2534.48] and then what i'd say spirit of
[2533.20 - 2535.76] compassion well what's gonna happen down
[2534.48 - 2537.36] the road well they're going to keep on
[2535.76 - 2538.64] urinating those crystals out and keep on
[2537.36 - 2540.16] losing and depleting their calcium in
[2538.64 - 2541.68] the bones that person's going to get an
[2540.16 - 2542.32] osteoporosis diagnosis that person's
[2541.68 - 2544.56] going to go
[2542.32 - 2546.08] to get osteopenia diagnosis that person
[2544.56 - 2547.68] is going to need jaw work
[2546.08 - 2549.04] bone graft that person's going to need
[2547.68 - 2550.24] bone graft that person is going to lose
[2549.04 - 2551.92] all their teeth that person
[2550.24 - 2554.32] i i heard this ultimate that person's
[2551.92 - 2557.04] skull is going to shrink
[2554.32 - 2557.60] that one's terrible i want to cover that
[2557.04 - 2560.40] real quick
[2557.60 - 2562.56] too that's important we're juicing
[2560.40 - 2565.52] celery we're using the mm-900 hds
[2562.56 - 2569.20] incredible medical device
[2565.52 - 2569.20] it's it's an amazing medical device
[2569.52 - 2573.20] so you guys see this right here in
[2571.52 - 2576.88] clubhouse i'm holding a brain
[2573.20 - 2576.88] a head a skull
[2577.20 - 2582.96] so here's what happens as you get older
[2580.00 - 2586.08] you lose the calcium in your skull
[2582.96 - 2587.68] your skull shrinks and when you get
[2586.08 - 2591.28] older your skull is like
[2587.68 - 2592.80] half the size because we have these
[2591.28 - 2596.48] practices in our life
[2592.80 - 2599.36] to draw calcium out of our body we do
[2596.48 - 2600.00] all the caffeine we do all the vinegar
[2599.36 - 2603.20] and we
[2600.00 - 2606.00] are removing calcium from our skull
[2603.20 - 2606.72] it's ever so mildly done it's like it's
[2606.00 - 2610.48] really
[2606.72 - 2613.04] minor yeah you don't see it fast
[2610.48 - 2615.28] but it happens but then that day when
[2613.04 - 2616.64] you're 65 years old and you slip on some
[2615.28 - 2618.32] ice outside and you
[2616.64 - 2620.32] land on the back your head and doctor
[2618.32 - 2622.32] says well you shouldn't have cracked
[2620.32 - 2623.92] your skull open
[2622.32 - 2626.24] you shouldn't have fractured your skull
[2623.92 - 2627.92] but you're getting older
[2626.24 - 2629.44] so you got more kind of a little bit
[2627.92 - 2630.32] more feeble a little bit more you're
[2629.44 - 2632.48] delicate
[2630.32 - 2633.68] you got older what happened is the
[2632.48 - 2635.92] reason why your skull
[2633.68 - 2638.88] fracture's so easy versus when you were
[2635.92 - 2640.64] 20 and you bend your head
[2638.88 - 2642.00] you were at a pool party when you're 20
[2640.64 - 2644.08] years old
[2642.00 - 2645.60] right you slip on the deck and you bang
[2644.08 - 2649.68] your head on the deck but your
[2645.60 - 2651.20] your skull doesn't fracture
[2649.68 - 2653.44] because you got enough calcium in your
[2651.20 - 2654.16] skull right you're 65 years old you slip
[2653.44 - 2655.92] on a deck
[2654.16 - 2657.84] you bend your head you're in the you're
[2655.92 - 2658.96] in the hospital you've got a fractured
[2657.84 - 2661.60] skull
[2658.96 - 2662.00] because the calcium's been depleting
[2661.60 - 2663.84] throughout
[2662.00 - 2665.20] the years nobody talks about cranial
[2663.84 - 2667.52] calcium no one
[2665.20 - 2669.76] it's medical medium information linda
[2667.52 - 2671.68] says why don't doctors tell us all this
[2669.76 - 2673.04] they're too busy writing prescriptions
[2671.68 - 2673.44] and the functional medicine doctors are
[2673.04 - 2674.96] too
[2673.44 - 2677.68] too busy bankrolling with the highest
[2674.96 - 2679.04] prices i've ever seen these days
[2677.68 - 2680.56] i've seen some functional medicine
[2679.04 - 2682.72] doctors people got to see them it's
[2680.56 - 2685.52] twenty two hundred dollars
[2682.72 - 2687.60] to see them they got a huge waiting list
[2685.52 - 2689.12] but it's like twenty two hundred dollars
[2687.60 - 2691.44] and here's what they get here's your gut
[2689.12 - 2693.84] health product here's your fish oil
[2691.44 - 2694.72] here's your other gut health probiotic
[2693.84 - 2696.32] here's your
[2694.72 - 2698.32] apple cider vinegar chewie's here's your
[2696.32 - 2699.92] calcium supplement
[2698.32 - 2702.56] here's your whatever supplement here's
[2699.92 - 2705.12] this here's that here's this here's that
[2702.56 - 2706.48] all junk all garbage make sure you go on
[2705.12 - 2708.40] the keto diet
[2706.48 - 2710.40] and we're going to draw the life out of
[2708.40 - 2712.48] you we're going to suck every last
[2710.40 - 2714.32] drop of blood out of you and take 14
[2712.48 - 2714.72] vials of blood and make sure we do all
[2714.32 - 2718.40] this
[2714.72 - 2720.24] useless testing because a lot of it is
[2718.40 - 2721.52] it's not the stuff people need to be
[2720.24 - 2723.20] looking at like for all
[2721.52 - 2725.60] all the viral panels and stuff that's
[2723.20 - 2726.72] what they really need to be looking at
[2725.60 - 2729.52] it's like and then we're going to take
[2726.72 - 2732.56] 14 to 20 vials out of you
[2729.52 - 2733.84] and then 2200 what's your bill was
[2732.56 - 2735.84] insurance covering it
[2733.84 - 2737.52] you're lucky you got insurance your
[2735.84 - 2739.20] lucky one it's twenty two hundred
[2737.52 - 2740.96] dollars ma'am
[2739.20 - 2743.36] mrs ferguson that's twenty four hundred
[2740.96 - 2743.36] dollars
[2744.84 - 2747.84] next
[2748.40 - 2757.52] all right you guys i got the mm-900 hds
[2754.16 - 2759.52] just lost my chocolate bar um
[2757.52 - 2760.72] you got to strain the juice here's one
[2759.52 - 2765.44] thing just
[2760.72 - 2768.88] this is ridiculous ridiculous
[2765.44 - 2768.88] this is almost stupid
[2769.28 - 2772.48] look at that do you see that it's dry to
[2771.92 - 2776.24] the bone
[2772.48 - 2778.08] and i'm holding a little tuft of pulp
[2776.24 - 2779.44] a little tough of celery pulp look at
[2778.08 - 2781.60] that
[2779.44 - 2784.00] do you guys see this this is a dry
[2781.60 - 2785.92] container that's dry
[2784.00 - 2788.24] there's there's no there's no moisture
[2785.92 - 2790.32] in this container
[2788.24 - 2791.60] i just juiced and there's no moisture in
[2790.32 - 2794.16] this container
[2791.60 - 2795.44] and i just juiced there's no juicer out
[2794.16 - 2797.36] there that's done that yet i haven't
[2795.44 - 2800.00] seen one yet and i've had them all
[2797.36 - 2801.20] i've tried them all that's the pulp
[2800.00 - 2804.00] right there
[2801.20 - 2807.52] do you see this you know what that means
[2804.00 - 2811.04] i just saved myself a ton of money
[2807.52 - 2812.16] ton of money because i only had to use a
[2811.04 - 2815.44] little bit of celery
[2812.16 - 2817.52] for all this juice this is insane
[2815.44 - 2819.60] you gotta strain your celery juice i've
[2817.52 - 2821.44] said this a thousand times
[2819.60 - 2823.36] you guys if it look i know some of you
[2821.44 - 2824.72] guys are total vets
[2823.36 - 2825.92] when it comes down to celery juice you
[2824.72 - 2826.48] guys been doing it for a while you've
[2825.92 - 2828.08] been
[2826.48 - 2829.68] following the medical medium information
[2828.08 - 2830.64] spirit of compassions books and stuff
[2829.68 - 2832.24] and you've been
[2830.64 - 2833.76] you've been like diligently doing your
[2832.24 - 2835.20] celery juice you strain it all the time
[2833.76 - 2837.04] and i know i sound like a broken record
[2835.20 - 2838.56] probably but i can't tell you how every
[2837.04 - 2839.20] day i see people they're just juicing
[2838.56 - 2840.64] celery
[2839.20 - 2843.52] they're not straining it and it's a
[2840.64 - 2846.56] no-no you have to strain it you guys
[2843.52 - 2847.92] you have to i'm just being straight up
[2846.56 - 2850.24] about that
[2847.92 - 2851.44] you've got to strain it i'm kind of
[2850.24 - 2854.16] doing this in a weird way so i'm
[2851.44 - 2855.68] spilling a few drops
[2854.16 - 2857.28] but that's only because i'm being sloppy
[2855.68 - 2858.80] because i'm actually doing this in front
[2857.28 - 2862.00] of juicer my arm's all wrapped around
[2858.80 - 2862.00] and i'm not even like looking
[2862.48 - 2866.08] so i spilled a couple of tiny drops
[2864.08 - 2870.80] there which really is sad
[2866.08 - 2870.80] because i don't normally do that at all
[2870.84 - 2874.08] okay so
[2874.96 - 2878.48] look what you have right there and what
[2876.64 - 2879.92] you can do is too you'll have a little
[2878.48 - 2881.92] bit of pulp in the strainer
[2879.92 - 2883.52] and you can squeeze that out right till
[2881.92 - 2887.84] it's dry to the bone which i do
[2883.52 - 2891.20] i do i love that but look at this
[2887.84 - 2892.00] that's your pulp i've never seen that
[2891.20 - 2896.48] anywhere
[2892.00 - 2898.80] and that's my juice which is incredible
[2896.48 - 2901.12] which is incredible which is incredible
[2898.80 - 2904.88] it really is um
[2901.12 - 2907.76] this is the mm-900 hds it's 82
[2904.88 - 2909.04] off but it's the mm-900 hds i told you
[2907.76 - 2910.08] guys i'm working with the company on
[2909.04 - 2912.80] this because
[2910.08 - 2913.60] when they told me that they had this
[2912.80 - 2916.88] idea
[2913.60 - 2919.12] where they can they can literally
[2916.88 - 2920.72] squeeze as much juice as we can out of
[2919.12 - 2922.80] celery i was like i'm on board
[2920.72 - 2924.56] i'm on board how do we keep this thing
[2922.80 - 2926.96] here so it doesn't go away i need people
[2924.56 - 2930.72] to have an opportunity
[2926.96 - 2932.08] um 32 ounces of celery juice
[2930.72 - 2933.44] is what i drink every single morning
[2932.08 - 2934.64] sometimes i'll drink more sometimes i'll
[2933.44 - 2938.60] drink a little less
[2934.64 - 2941.28] anyway it's omegajuicers.com omega omega
[2938.60 - 2944.40] juicers.com omegajuicers.com
[2941.28 - 2948.56] they have a sale right now it's 25 off
[2944.40 - 2951.52] mm-900 hds 82. you save
[2948.56 - 2952.16] but what's incredible you have to strain
[2951.52 - 2955.52] it
[2952.16 - 2956.24] you have to because the pulp and the
[2955.52 - 2958.00] fiber
[2956.24 - 2960.16] get in the way of the medicine this is
[2958.00 - 2962.56] an herbal extraction
[2960.16 - 2963.92] it's just like an herbal tea you have to
[2962.56 - 2965.20] strain the tea
[2963.92 - 2966.88] it's an herbal extraction but the
[2965.20 - 2968.64] difference with celery juice you really
[2966.88 - 2971.84] have to strain it
[2968.64 - 2971.84] okay really important
[2972.32 - 2976.40] you can you know and and here's how it
[2975.36 - 2977.84] goes
[2976.40 - 2980.40] pulp and fiber get in the way of the
[2977.84 - 2981.20] sodium cluster salts we're doing herbal
[2980.40 - 2984.24] medicine
[2981.20 - 2986.48] so you're witnessing a medical tool and
[2984.24 - 2990.16] what it's doing is it's extracting
[2986.48 - 2993.04] herbal medicine it's extracting medicine
[2990.16 - 2994.32] from celery that's how you have to look
[2993.04 - 2996.56] at it that's how i look at it every
[2994.32 - 2999.28] single morning that's how i see it
[2996.56 - 3000.88] then it really is what it is right and
[2999.28 - 3002.72] if the pulpit fiber is in the way it
[3000.88 - 3003.92] interferes with the sodium cluster salts
[3002.72 - 3006.16] and i know i've been showing you guys
[3003.92 - 3006.16] this
[3007.60 - 3015.76] what's in what's in celery salt
[3011.28 - 3019.36] right the healthy form the macro
[3015.76 - 3021.52] sodium right okay
[3019.36 - 3022.64] but what's around there at least is the
[3021.52 - 3024.96] subgroup of sodium
[3022.64 - 3028.32] sodium cluster salts they float around
[3024.96 - 3028.32] and suspend in a living fluid
[3028.40 - 3032.08] that's the subgroup of sodium sodium
[3031.20 - 3034.00] cluster salts
[3032.08 - 3035.36] that's it trace mineral salts and what
[3034.00 - 3037.84] happens is that
[3035.36 - 3038.80] when you have fiber and pulp it gets in
[3037.84 - 3041.92] the way of this
[3038.80 - 3045.12] you have to extract this from the
[3041.92 - 3047.20] stalks of celery in order for this to
[3045.12 - 3051.44] kill for you
[3047.20 - 3053.28] celery juice kills it does
[3051.44 - 3055.68] so here's what happens let me just show
[3053.28 - 3058.48] you guys right here okay
[3055.68 - 3060.32] here's a pathogen right here so here's a
[3058.48 - 3064.32] pathogen
[3060.32 - 3064.32] i'm gonna do a little drawing here
[3066.16 - 3071.84] that's a pathogen okay you guys see that
[3069.12 - 3074.96] in tic toc you guys see that
[3071.84 - 3076.48] that pathogen when it goes when it goes
[3074.96 - 3080.00] near
[3076.48 - 3081.76] this sodium cluster salt living fluid
[3080.00 - 3083.92] living base this trace mineral living
[3081.76 - 3085.12] base that that harbors like a solar
[3083.92 - 3088.96] system around
[3085.12 - 3092.24] the sodium in celery
[3088.96 - 3095.52] when this little solar system
[3092.24 - 3097.52] there's thousands of these solar systems
[3095.52 - 3100.88] inside your celery juice
[3097.52 - 3103.52] thousands thousands
[3100.88 - 3105.68] so when that solar system runs across a
[3103.52 - 3108.08] pathogen
[3105.68 - 3109.76] it kills it it starts to break it down
[3108.08 - 3110.48] it starts to destroy it starts to weaken
[3109.76 - 3114.16] it
[3110.48 - 3116.08] celery juice kills
[3114.16 - 3118.96] that's what's incredible and what's
[3116.08 - 3121.44] better is it kills for you
[3118.96 - 3125.36] that's what it does there's a membrane
[3121.44 - 3127.36] on the pathogen right there
[3125.36 - 3128.72] and it's these little tiny things right
[3127.36 - 3130.32] there you see these things the membrane
[3128.72 - 3130.88] it's a slipcover like a pillowcase you
[3130.32 - 3133.60] guys
[3130.88 - 3135.20] imagine your pillowcase right over your
[3133.60 - 3138.64] pillow
[3135.20 - 3141.04] that pillowcase is your pillow's
[3138.64 - 3142.23] protector right protects the pillow the
[3141.04 - 3144.00] pillow can stay clean
[3142.23 - 3145.68] [Music]
[3144.00 - 3147.28] your pillowcase gets dirty you wash your
[3145.68 - 3149.68] pillowcase because your pillowcase gets
[3147.28 - 3149.68] dirty
[3150.08 - 3155.76] well the virus and the pathogens
[3153.12 - 3157.44] all have a membrane a slip cover around
[3155.76 - 3159.52] it like a pillowcase cover
[3157.44 - 3162.48] and it keeps it safe just like your
[3159.52 - 3165.12] pillowcase keeps your pillow safe
[3162.48 - 3166.08] and that membrane starts to break down
[3165.12 - 3167.76] and dissolves
[3166.08 - 3170.48] when it runs across that's the pathogen
[3167.76 - 3174.00] right here when it runs across
[3170.48 - 3177.04] the sodium cluster dissolves right there
[3174.00 - 3178.16] i mean isn't that like incredible what
[3177.04 - 3180.24] it does
[3178.16 - 3182.48] deb says i've been drinking celery juice
[3180.24 - 3185.44] daily for nine months and have healed
[3182.48 - 3186.80] chronic tendinitis and vertigo is that
[3185.44 - 3190.08] worth it
[3186.80 - 3192.56] like does somebody want tendonitis
[3190.08 - 3195.20] no right no way it's brutal somebody
[3192.56 - 3198.72] want tendonitis somebody want
[3195.20 - 3201.04] vertigo no it's brutal nobody wants that
[3198.72 - 3201.76] and celery juice turn that around for
[3201.04 - 3205.68] you
[3201.76 - 3207.76] what's that worth um the juicer is 82
[3205.68 - 3209.44] off when i think about i have a friend
[3207.76 - 3212.16] that's sick right
[3209.44 - 3213.12] a friend that's sick and my friend's
[3212.16 - 3216.40] addictions
[3213.12 - 3218.16] stop my friend from healing right
[3216.40 - 3219.52] my friend has a lot of food addictions
[3218.16 - 3223.28] can't break the fats
[3219.52 - 3225.92] at all um you know i still love them
[3223.28 - 3226.48] i still love them you know i'm not gonna
[3225.92 - 3227.84] hate them
[3226.48 - 3229.20] i'm still gonna love them and be like
[3227.84 - 3229.84] man it's hard to break those food
[3229.20 - 3232.16] addictions
[3229.84 - 3233.36] my friends got all the food addictions
[3232.16 - 3236.80] right
[3233.36 - 3238.88] and the whole bit
[3236.80 - 3240.72] and just gets sick he gets sick he gets
[3238.88 - 3242.08] sick he gets sick he calls me up i want
[3240.72 - 3244.16] help i tell him what to do
[3242.08 - 3246.56] he says i can't do it my addictions are
[3244.16 - 3246.56] too much
[3247.12 - 3251.36] and i'm like get a juicer and he's like
[3249.68 - 3252.64] get a juicer because you've got to do
[3251.36 - 3254.32] celery juice
[3252.64 - 3256.48] i can't spend the money i can't spend
[3254.32 - 3258.72] the money i can't spend the money
[3256.48 - 3260.88] i need my money for other things i'm
[3258.72 - 3262.56] like look
[3260.88 - 3264.48] bill says i was juicing every morning
[3262.56 - 3265.92] for about a month and i started to
[3264.48 - 3269.68] develop age spots
[3265.92 - 3272.48] on my face not a disbeliever
[3269.68 - 3273.92] want to find out why my body reacted
[3272.48 - 3275.84] that way
[3273.92 - 3279.20] bill it's not the juicing that does that
[3275.84 - 3281.12] it's they were coming anyway
[3279.20 - 3283.36] coming anyway your celery juice is
[3281.12 - 3285.60] working on other things inside your body
[3283.36 - 3287.04] right it's working on everything it's
[3285.60 - 3288.80] working on cleaning out these kidney
[3287.04 - 3290.96] stones i'm talking about it's work
[3288.80 - 3292.72] it's working on restoring your adrenals
[3290.96 - 3293.52] it's killing off pathogens inside your
[3292.72 - 3295.04] body
[3293.52 - 3298.08] so your celery juice is doing all this
[3295.04 - 3300.64] work it's cleaning up a dirty liver
[3298.08 - 3302.80] it's doing all this stuff but those age
[3300.64 - 3305.04] spots would have been a lot worse
[3302.80 - 3306.96] i've said that to people in the past
[3305.04 - 3308.08] don't do celery juice and watch how bad
[3306.96 - 3310.32] they get
[3308.08 - 3311.68] would be a lot worse don't do celery
[3310.32 - 3312.40] juice and people's other problems get a
[3311.68 - 3314.56] lot worse
[3312.40 - 3316.56] and would have been a lot worse people
[3314.56 - 3318.56] already have
[3316.56 - 3320.64] a whole bunch of stuff coming on their
[3318.56 - 3321.12] way they got a track record of all this
[3321.12 - 3324.48] that's in their system and all these
[3322.88 - 3325.44] things that have happened and all the
[3324.48 - 3327.28] bad foods
[3325.44 - 3329.04] and all everything else they got a track
[3327.28 - 3331.12] record of it
[3329.04 - 3332.84] lots of bad meals lots of all kinds of
[3331.12 - 3335.92] stuff lots of eggs
[3332.84 - 3338.48] like you know what happens is
[3335.92 - 3339.76] people are eating a lot of eggs all
[3338.48 - 3341.20] through the years
[3339.76 - 3342.88] and then they do caffeine and they're
[3341.20 - 3344.40] doing caffeine too and then they're
[3342.88 - 3345.68] doing chocolate yeah they might have
[3344.40 - 3348.32] chocolate just once in a while
[3345.68 - 3349.76] but that chocolate once in a while what
[3348.32 - 3352.08] happens is that caffeine in that
[3349.76 - 3355.12] chocolate is what brings about age spots
[3352.08 - 3355.84] then they got chemicals they got cologne
[3355.12 - 3359.20] perfume
[3355.84 - 3360.56] in their life they got scented candles
[3359.20 - 3362.88] they get all kinds of stuff they get
[3360.56 - 3364.56] exposed to and then those age spots are
[3362.88 - 3366.08] on their way because caffeine is the big
[3364.56 - 3368.08] age spot cause or
[3366.08 - 3369.92] it's one of the big ones they got it on
[3368.08 - 3370.96] the way thank god you're doing celery
[3369.92 - 3372.48] juice bill
[3370.96 - 3374.32] because then main spots would have been
[3372.48 - 3375.84] a lot worse and now you've got a chance
[3374.32 - 3377.28] of getting those age spots cleaned up
[3375.84 - 3380.24] down the road too
[3377.28 - 3382.80] ernest says age spots can go away just
[3380.24 - 3384.80] continue drinking your cj
[3382.80 - 3387.20] it's really good advice incredible
[3384.80 - 3387.20] advice
[3387.36 - 3393.28] i would i would definitely
[3391.44 - 3394.72] stay away from eggs if you guys can i
[3393.28 - 3396.24] would stay with my caffeine i understand
[3394.72 - 3399.28] everybody has a caffeine
[3396.24 - 3399.28] um totally get it
[3401.60 - 3405.12] angel says my age spots have failed
[3404.64 - 3409.92] since
[3405.12 - 3409.92] juicing celery so
[3410.16 - 3414.80] oh faded so they faded since juicing
[3413.12 - 3418.08] celery
[3414.80 - 3419.60] typos are funny so yeah
[3418.08 - 3422.40] okay so let's go back into a little bit
[3419.60 - 3423.52] adrenal talk for a couple minutes but
[3422.40 - 3425.84] and before i go in there i'm talking
[3423.52 - 3426.56] about like why juice celery why'd you
[3425.84 - 3427.84] celery
[3426.56 - 3430.08] i've heard that before of the time
[3427.84 - 3431.04] ernest says my age spot on my nose
[3430.08 - 3433.20] disappeared
[3431.04 - 3435.36] i was blown away drinking your celery
[3433.20 - 3438.40] juice incredible
[3435.36 - 3439.92] so i look at the celery juicer as a
[3438.40 - 3442.56] medical device
