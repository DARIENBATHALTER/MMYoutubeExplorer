62
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,040
funny

63
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,920
um live in concert um

64
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,600
joanne moore says hair loss for years

65
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,240
for women's hair loss it's a lot

66
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,640
different than

67
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,640
it's entirely different than men's hair

68
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,680
loss women's adrenals

69
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,520
have a hormone in them

70
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,599
that is what keeps hair on

71
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,720
your head and that so that's what what

72
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,959
happens there and so

73
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,760
women lose that hormone inside their

74
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,319
adrenals that one specific hormone

75
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,840
that keeps the hair follicles alive and

76
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,440
they lose it because of years of

77
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,319
caffeine from years before

78
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,360
so years of caffeine of all kinds

79
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,640
chocolate

80
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,680
coffee tea whatever and and even if it's

81
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,080
green tea

82
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,599
and so no one tells you the caffeine

83
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
industry and i talk about this medical

84
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,480

how to heal chronic pancreatitis the

244
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,520
first thing i would do if i had chronic

245
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,919
pancreatitis

246
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,120
if i had that first thing i would do is

247
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,360
lower fats

248
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,360
you've got to lower fats and then i

249
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
would bring in like kabocha squash i

250
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
would bring in delicata squash i would

251
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,560
bring in some potato

252
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,400
i would bring in all that i would bring

253
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,319
in some fruit i would bring in

254
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,720
of course some leafy greens but what i

255
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,440
what i would do is not bring in the nut

256
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
butters

257
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,879
not bring in the oils not bring in the

258
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,440
chicken

259
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,160
meat chronic pancreatitis get off animal

260
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,800

261
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,919
and i'm not anti-animal products i mean

262
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280

263
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,520
i'm pro-plant-based for sure for pro

264
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,960
plant-based and pro-vegan but i'm also

265
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
i'm pro-animal products

266
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,039
diets if you if that's what someone

267
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,280
wants to do but when i'm not pro

268
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
is doing everything wrong and people do

269
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,919
vegan diets wrong

270
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,800
plant-based diets wrong animal protein

271
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:32,080

272
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,479
and but if i had chronic pancreatitis

273
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,839

idea but um

302
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,440
but yeah so lucas says

303
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,560
can you explain function of tonsils

304
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,839
please

305
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,519
mine are swollen very often any idea

306
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,760
thank you much anthony

307
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,080
um that well first of all your your

308
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,440
tonsils are part of your immune system

309
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,600
right there that they're part of your

310
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,399
immune system so your lymphatic system

311
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,600
and tonsils are hand in hand okay that's

312
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,160
to protect you right

313
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,320
but what happens is the tonsils get

314
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
inflamed when we get streptococcus that

315
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
are

316
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,720
that's chronic doesn't mean you're gonna

317
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,600
see it so when the doctor does a swab on

318
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,440
your throat

319
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,880
on your tonsils doesn't mean they're

320
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
gonna they're gonna be able to culture

321
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,519
that

322
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
because it gets deep in the tonsils not

323
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,040
on the surface

324
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,399
streptococcus epstein bar mono all those

325
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,240
things those are the things

326
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,079
that keep tonsils swollen but they go in

327
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
undiagnosed doctors don't know

328
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,360
so if you were a family member or

329
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
somebody they can because i had a family

330
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,399
member come to me last month with

331
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,079
swollen tonsils

332
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,680
and a cousin and i was like look

333
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,480
that's that's low grade viral and

334
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,920
streptococcus go to your doctor

335
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,160
talk to them about it but that's what

336
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,200
that is and so what i would do if

337
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,320
my tonsils were swollen is is i would do

338
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,720
um some some epstein-barr protocols or

339
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
some

340
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,160
you know anything in the medical mean

341
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
books i would heck you know what i would

342
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
do

343
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,839
is um i would go back into all the

344
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,480
different symptoms and conditions back

345
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,800
here

346
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,640
and i would look at the mono one or

347
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,880
anything like that i would go back there

348
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,399
and look at that

349
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,760
that that's something that i would do

350
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,560
take it to your doctor you could talk to

351
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,720

eyes okay so that you know

387
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,760

known me

389
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,920
because a lot of uh people who know the

390
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,959
medical medium information and know

391
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,800
about me and stuff

392
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,240
i could see fine i could read all your

393
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,240
comments just like this

394
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
there's there's nothing wrong there what

395
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
happens is

396
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,560
i hear a voice and when i hear that

397
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,440
voice

398
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
that voice is very hard on me and i hear

399
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,279
it very

400
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,760
loud and then because all you guys are

401
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,320
on

402
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,160
all right i'm getting information so

403
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,200
information just comes through while i'm

404
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,279
here with you

405
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,040
then i get what's called snow blindness

406
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,880
because of it since i was age four

407
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,720
when i get the information from spirit

408
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,600
of compassion and i start

409
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,600
getting that the visuals and start the

410
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
the reeds start coming in and all that

411
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
stuff

412
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,120
it squints my eyes i squint them so if

413
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,959
you want to see me squint

414
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,320
you're going to see me squint this way

415
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,839
if you put the glasses on you're not

416
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
going to see me squint so much the

417
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,920
glasses kind of hide it

418
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,959
it's a technique i've used my whole life

419
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,360
don't need them

420
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,800
you know i don't have to have them but

421
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,560
then my whole life people are going to

422
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
see me and once i get the reads

423
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
once spirits talking to me once that

424
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,920
white light is coming down

425
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,000
i'm going to start squinting a little

426
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,560
bit like this you see this that's how it

427
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,639
works

428
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
so when that happens it's better when

429
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,639
these are on when that's happening

430
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,040
that's how it works i don't need to heal

431
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,800
my eyes i got the best vision there is

432
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
actually that anybody can have

433
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,680
so i'm just letting you know right there

434
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,639
and how it works for squinting and

435
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,000
everything

436
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,000
lorraine l um i'm so you know you know

437
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,240
lorraine l says i'm still in love with

438
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
all the meditations nothing else like

439
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,040
them so i mean i could read perfectly

440
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,880
fine

441
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,560

don't need the glasses

445
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,000
and i people have said that before but

446
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,760
when you learn about medical medium

447
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,480

448
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,079

449
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,360
you won't have questions like that or

450
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,360
concerns or however

451
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,600

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,320
garbage that's been attached to your
