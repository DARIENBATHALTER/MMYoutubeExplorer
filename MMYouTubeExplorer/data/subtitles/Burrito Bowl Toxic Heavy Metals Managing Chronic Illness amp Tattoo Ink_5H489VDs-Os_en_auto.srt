but that's what i use in mine and what i

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,959
tell family and friends because people

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,519
say how like how can i remove metals

89
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
what's my

90
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,959
best chance of removing all that

91
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,120
copper from all those copper toxic

92
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
sources removing all the mercury

93
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
removing all the aluminum i'm asset all

94
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,360
the time my family friends

95
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,560
doctors what's my best chance and

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
they'll say something like

97
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,599
i got some krill i'm like that's not

98
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,200
going to do it they won't

99
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,440
then they'll say oh i got this other

100
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,680
kind of spirulina i'll be like uh

101
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
that spirulina is not coming from a good

102
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,599
place or a good source

103
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
and if you know when people say what's

104
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,959
my greatest chance of getting the medals

105
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,799
out and i'm like look

106
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,799
this is what i do if you want to know

107
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,480
what i do so it's the bemidji spirulina

108
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,400
barley grass juice powder

109
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,599
wild blueberry powder because it's

110
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,040
important i mean

111
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,280
it's either you do it or you don't

112
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,400
meaning like you have the best there is

113
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,640
or you do it half ass and that's okay i

114
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,319
mean people do that they'll do it like

115
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,920
now this is enough i could just do this

116
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,920
i got enough i'll just use a little

117
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
cilantro and i'm good but

118
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
it's like look do you really got some

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
stuff going on if you're really worried

120
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,040
about your tattoos and i got to talk to

121
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,159
you guys about the tattoos while we're

122
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,680
cooking

123
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,080
if you're really worried about all the

124
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,640
different metals that we have you just

125
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
i tell my friends my family let's do it

126
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,760
right

127
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,200
do it right because we can't avoid all

128
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,280
the medals they're out there we get

129
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,599
exposed to it every day we're exposed to

130
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
it

131
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,439
in every way possible all the time and

132
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,320
that's fine

133
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,160
that's fine but we got to do something

134
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,799
about it at least be proactive

135
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,919
in removing more than what's coming in

136
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,960
so it's about removing

137
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,280
more metals than what's coming in it's

138
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
like

139
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,800
i want more metals coming out of me than

140
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,880
what's coming in all the time

141
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
so that's really important right there

142
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,280
and

143
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,800
metals settle in your brain that's the

144
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,280
number one place they

145
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,520
all go so if you're doing

146
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,000
pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals got all

147
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,479
metals

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,320
in them if you're doing pharmaceuticals

149
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,240
they go to the brain

150
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,240
all the metals go to the brain all that

151
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,199
titanium

152
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,919
all of it on the mercury all of that

153
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
stuff

154
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,560
all the barium barium is in

155
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,720
pharmaceuticals lots of barium

156
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,960
goes to the brain and then your brain

157
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,360
becomes a magnet

158
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,039
for because of the electricity panel

159
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
that's in your brain

160
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,400
that electricity panel that's in your

161
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,639
brain right

162
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,639
becomes a magnet for more metal more

163
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,120
metal it can't get enough it just starts

164
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,320
to stick to all the deposits and spots

165
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,000
right

166
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,919
anyway we'll talk about that we got a

167
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,840
lot to cover on all of it

168
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,919
so if you don't have frozen wild

169
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,440
blueberries substitute with two

170
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,080
tablespoons

171
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,560
of the wild blueberry powder so that's

172
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,639
what you can do substitute

173
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,880
see guys i'm here let's start making

174
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,120

i'm gonna throw them in the food

180
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,720
processor

181
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
okay so i'm just kind of cutting these

182
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,840
back a little

183
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,440
so i'm going to pop them in here and

184
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,919

tattoo ink

186
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,759
really important that's a question that

187
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,639

many of you guys saw the video my tick

189
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,680
tock video right

190
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,160
and i rolled up my sleeves and um

191
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,680
and it's important to be proactive if

192
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,960
you got ink

193
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,240
it really is because ink

194
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,360
is a delivery system for toxic heavy

195
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
metals

196
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
to go to your brain and liver your whole

197
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,120
lifetime your whole lifetime so once you

198
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
get inked that's it

199
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
you got it you got the ink whole

200
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840
lifetime right

201
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,400
so all that metal and then i'm going to

202
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,440
talk about

203
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,680
oh wait i don't i don't have the toxic

204
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,160
my ink my my tattooist my artist

205
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,199
he says that mine is it's it's cruelty

206
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
free

207
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,759
it's animal product free it's vegan

208
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,520
my ink is vegan it's non-toxic

209
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,440
so anthony you're just i don't know what

210
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,240
kind of tattoo ink you're talking about

211
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,280
anthony

212
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,240
is not mine my tattoo artist would never

213
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,199
do that to me no he said it's cruelty

214
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,880
free it's animal free it's non-toxic

215
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,160
it's sterile it's sterile ink

216
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,599
certified sterile and so you'll hear

217
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,919
that right

218
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,120
but i'm sorry to say it's got toxic

219
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,960
heavy metals in it

220
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
and a whole variety of toxic heavy

221
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
metals because i'm going to drop the

222
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,160
bomb on you right now

223
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,720
really important to know and ink

224
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,919
reflects off the sun and light

225
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,120
because of toxic heavy metals they can't

226
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,680
put ink in your arms

227
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,520
okay like you saw in my video they can't

228
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,080
put ink in your arms

229
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,759
in your neck in your side if they put a

230
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,039
little scripture on your side you know

231
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,280
like some kind of like

232
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,879
some kind of some scripture from buddha

233
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,199
or something some scripture

234
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,639
and then whatever you got on you right

235
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,240
or some kind of you know

236
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,400
some kind of feathers or whatever is

237
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,039
going on that you have

238
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,440
in order for it to show up really good

239
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,280
and

240
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,599
pop through the skin it has to have

241
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,520
metals to reflect the light that's

242
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,520
coming down to your skin

243
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,039
so when you roll up your sleeves you

244
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,479
pull up whatever you're wearing shorts

245
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,759
you have them on your ankles wherever

246
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,479
you got your ink

247
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,800
for when light hits it in order for it

248
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,919
to

249
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,560
pop it has to hit the metals

250
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,080
in the ink you see how it works that's

251
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,680
how it pops

252
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,560
and in all makers of ink

253
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,159
because ink we're rich all the products

254
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,320
from inc comes from china so it all

255
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,600
comes from china it's all made out there

256
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,360
then it gets shipped overseas to the us

257
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,040
and then you know and then and they make

258
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,560
it in the u.s too but most

259
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,959
inks come from there at least a lot of

260
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,680
the supplies come from there so they

261
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,480
make it in the u.s but the supplies for

262
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,000
the inc

263
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,000
come from from china it's where they

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,279
come from right and

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,040
where you know we're where most

266
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,839
everything comes from right you guys but

267
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,680
what happens

268
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,399
is that that these this ink

269
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,399
okay is filled with metals and it's

270
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,320
filled with a variety of metals

271
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,760
and it has to be so that the ink pops

272
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,000
and you're a happy customer

273
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,560
so it's like whoa that looks so good i

274
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
got some colors in there it looks great

275
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,720
you're a happy customer and it's to make

276
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,720
it so it pops for years

277
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,560
eventually you get older of course and

278
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,880
the ink starts to not look as great

279
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,600
doesn't pop as much because your skin

280
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
kind of

281
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,959
what happens is it gets buried deeper

282
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
into the derma it goes deeper into the

283
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,080
derma and it sinks deeper into the derma

284
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,560
but what happens is

285
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,480
these metals leach into your bloodstream

286
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,320
for your entire life

287
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,959
and hey that's all right i mean that's

288
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,720
okay i'm not i'm not trying to scare you

289
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,640
that's not it i'm just saying

290
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,959
that that you got to be proactive

291
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
because all that metal goes to your

292
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,800
brain i don't care who tells you

293
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,160
no it's non-toxic no there's no heavy

294
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,120
metals in my ink

295
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
um it's it's cruelty free it's non-toxic

296
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
no

297
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,760
it's got solvents in it it's got other

298
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,880
poisons and chemicals in it

299
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,640
the best ink there is on the market has

300
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,360
solvents and poisons in it it does

301
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,399
it's okay it just does it's got toxic

302
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
heavy metals in it

303
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,680
it just does and so

304
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,600
keep in mind that that's all right it's

305
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,800
not about getting rid of your tattoos

306
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
it's not about trying to get your

307
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,040
tattoos removed no not at all

308
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,800
i don't recommend that i don't i don't

309
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,399
recommend you trying to get them removed

310
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
i don't recommend you try to do anything

311
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,640
like that that's not it

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
it's just what i recommend is being

313
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,959
proactive

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,959
get your metals out of your bloodstream

315
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,079
get them out of your organs and your

316
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,720
skin

317
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,760
is one of those organs and so you're

318
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,519
working on

319
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
basically making sure you're removing

320
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,880
metals that are coming out of the skin

321
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
from the bottom

322
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,240
down so from the bottom down from your

323
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,120
derma

324
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,880
down and those those metals they leach

325
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,320
over time and they drop down

326
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,880
and that's what happens they go from

327
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,240
your skin on down deeper to the derma

328
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,120
until they finally get to all kinds of

329
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
blood vessels

330
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,760
and they leech like a leech field over

331
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,880
time so when we get our ink

332
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,320
it's leech fields of toxic waste

333
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,839
because that's what ink is made out of i

334
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,959
don't care when they say it's non-toxic

335
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,240
that's not true

336
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,959
that's not true because all ink is toxic

337
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,440
so

338
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,880
and that's okay and i don't want you to

339
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
go run and try to get rid of your

340
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,760
tattoos i don't want you to worry about

341
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,600
that if you're somebody who loves

342
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,720
tattoos and you've been really wanting

343
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,399
to get another one

344
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,079
you do what you want get another one

345
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,640
whatever but

346
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
be proactive and work on getting the

347
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,640
metals

348
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,240
out that's the key it's about you know

349
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
it's about the information you know

350
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
having that information it's so

351
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,079
important

352
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,320
and um so you don't want to do the re

353
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,440
remove i i don't recommend removing them

354
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,839
because trying to remove them through

355
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,399
laser techniques and stuff because

356
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,560
when you do that um they leach quicker

357
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,360
they leach even more they leach in a

358
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,399
large amount i'd rather have ink

359
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,000
sitting on me let's just say

360
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,800
okay or anyone i'd rather had have ink

361
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,360
sit there and leech slowly year after

362
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,880
year

363
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,480
month after month for the rest of your

364
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,200
life because you can

365
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,600
when you're proactive and you're doing

366
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
your heavy metal detox smoothie

367
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
um and you're doing your spirulina

368
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,959
you're doing your barley you're doing

369
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,959
your dolls you're doing your cilantro

370
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,399
you're gathering whatever's leeching

371
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,240
you're gathering your gathering you're

372
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,440
taking it out and you're sweeping it out

373
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
right

374
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,279
and that's what you want i don't

375
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
recommend really removing any because

376
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,560
when you do the removing

377
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,760
of any kind of way they do it laser is

378
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,040
the most uh

379
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,040
common right now it's your your all of

380
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,120
it's dumping into your system then you

381
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,399
you can't get a control over that too

382
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,839
easy so a lot of it can go to the brain

383
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,440
let's work on this right here for a

384
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,279

what do you suggest about being

430
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,440
proactive

431
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,040
hi diane i'm glad you're on here i'm

432
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,760

433
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,760
cauliflower

434
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,519
getting the metals out being proactive

435
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,079
and removing toxic heavy metals

436
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,040
and other toxins that that are in the

437
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,399
ink that

438
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,160
you've gotten a lot of people who have

439
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,120
older ink they have ink

440
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,079
that was even higher in toxic heavy

441
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,880
metals

442
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,720
but all ink whether it's vegan whether

443
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,600
it's you know with cruelty free

444
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,079
whether it says it's non-toxic is high

445
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
in toxic

446
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,399
heavy metals no matter what because they

447
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,320
have to that's how it's seen through

448
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,279
your skin i'm just giving you the 4-1-1

449
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
on that now i know

450
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,480
a tattoo artist might be upset when they

451
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,839
hear that and they may like he's not

452
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,720
right that's not true

453
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,120
my supplier says this or i got this but

454
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,880
what

455
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,560
they don't realize remember they're the

456
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,440
artist it doesn't mean they're an

457
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,160
expert at the chemical composition of

458
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,120
where

459
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,959
and how these inks are made and that's

460
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,079
really important to know you know

461
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,120
regardless of what they're told in in in

462
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,480
order

463
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,440
for your ink to pop through your skin

464
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,839
it there has to be metal in the ink

465
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,199
that's

466
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,000
what reflects off the light it's the

467
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,880
metals in the

468
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,720
ink that will send out that red that

469
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,680
will send out that yellow that will send

470
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,160
out the orange

471
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,839
that will send out the purple the blue

472
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,720
that will send out the black

473
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,639
it that's the reflection that it needs

474
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,240
it's about that so talking about being

475
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,480
proactive here

476
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,480
so i made the rice proactive is actually

477
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,839
doing the heavy metal detox smoothie

478
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,519
that's what i have friends i have

479
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,880
friends that have ink got lots of

480
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,880
friends that are loaded with ink

481
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,000
okay they got them everywhere they got

482
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,000
an ink on their neck

483
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
they got ink on their legs they got ink

484
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
everywhere and

485
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,639
um and they're doing the heavy metal

486
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,000
detox smoothie so the medical medium

487
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,680
heavy metal detox smoothie so they're

488
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,160
being proactive in that way

489
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,800
they're doing uh vimergy spirulina the

490
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,039
memory

491
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,120
barley grass so they're using the right

492
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,959
stuff i mean you could use whatever

493
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,959
you want to find a spirulina you like go

494
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
use it you want to find a barley grass

495
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,760
juice powder you like go use it that's

496
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,039
what i recommend my friends and family

497
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,360
that's what i use

498
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,559
um i don't i mean personally i don't

499
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,079
have a lot of faith in the other

500
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,919
products out there when it comes down to

501
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,880
those i'm not sponsored by

502
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,880
by bimergy um but anyway terry says

503
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,559
misinformation

504
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,559
um yeah i mean

505
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,080
it's not misinformation and i love how

506
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,400
you use my word

507
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,840
because that's that's funny because all

508
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,880
these years that's what i've always used

509
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,720
is misinformation

510
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,160
unless that's for someone else that

511
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,320
might have been for someone else

512
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,559
um but anyway it's interesting though as

513
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,400
far as uh stuff goes

514
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,840
if it was for someone else thanks

515
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,960
exactly but you know

516
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,679
but yeah it the metals have to be in the

517
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,480
ink

518
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,440
in order to reflect the light that's how

519
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
you get your

520
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,679
greatest maximum color out of there and

521
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,000
that's how it works

522
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,360
um so let's just keep on making this

523
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,960
here's the rice i'm gonna put the rice

524
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,840

528
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,000
this is just one of them i'm going to

529
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,679

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,280
whatever it is it's great for that too

560
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,120
because when people are sick with

561
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,640
viruses like epstein-barr virus and

562
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,440
shingles virus and all that

563
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,360
viruses feed off of toxic heavy metals

564
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
so that's that's a reason why to do it

565
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,240
too all on its own

566
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,760

657
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,960
misinformation out there on tomatoes

658
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,480
always has been

659
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,640
hanging there we're about to talk about

660
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,200
copper in a minute too but i wanted to

661
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,559
cover the

662
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,480
ink as much as i could right now

663
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,120
i know a lot of you guys have ink i

664
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,559
totally get it

665
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,640
but we're gonna go into the copper

666
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,600
that's next let me just dice up some

667
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,039
tomatoes

668
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,400
so there's a trend happening right now

669
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,280
and

670
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,720
it's a trend of copper's good for you

671
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,559
dear lord

672
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,440
that's a nightmare okay it's far from

673
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,480
good for you copper thermoses

674
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,240
copper water

675
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:52,159
storage units copper

676
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:55,200
anything like that copper jewelry

677
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,640
copper wear the reason why

678
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,559
copper wear people swear by it sometimes

679
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,720
is because it's it's um it's support

680
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,600
is what it is so it's actual supports

681
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,480
compression

682
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,240
compression support so it can be without

683
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,120
the copper and someone's going to swear

684
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,880
by it okay

685
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,720
so it doesn't it doesn't matter any kind

686
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,440
of compression

687
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,159
sleeves compression knee braces

688
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,799
compression

689
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,679
socks compression elbow braces

690
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,799
compression

691
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,960
wrist bands rich wrist braces

692
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,960
any kind of compression therapy is

693
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,200
helpful and people swear by it

694
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,360
they didn't have to stick copper in it

695
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,960
copper's toxic so then people get copper

696
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,240
leaching through their skin

697
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,799
copper is not anti-inflammatory it never

698
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,600
was

699
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,159
and anybody who thinks copper's

700
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,919
anti-inflammatory

701
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,679
it's coming from a place any kind of

702
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,279
professional any kind of authority or

703
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,600
health authority that thinks

704
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,039
copper's anti-inflammatory they don't

705
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,640
know what's causing inflammation to

706
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,159
begin with so you got to remember that

707
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,679
so it's coming from sources that don't

708
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,279
know why anybody's sick

709
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,360
before i released the truth about

710
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,960
epstein-barr no one even knew

711
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,200
that there was even a possibility that

712
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,480
viruses caused any kind of inflammation

713
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,279
so the medical media books have brought

714
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,039
that out there okay and

715
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,720
copper is toxic copper's in pesticides

716
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,520
it's one of the leading reasons why

717
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,760
pesticides are so bad and we get sick

718
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,960
it's because of copper copper's in

719
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,240
fungicides

720
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
pesticides fire retardant it's it's

721
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,000
actually

722
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,039
it's actually a toxin it's dangerous to

723
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,320
us

724
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,760
copper pennies are bad for us to be in

725
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,600
our hands and you play around

726
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,919
if you ever counted a jar of old pennies

727
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,520
and you counted them by hand and wrapped

728
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,520
them in you know the little

729
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,559
the little you know coin sleeves and you

730
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,120
put them in there right

731
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,240
your hands will smell like straight

732
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,559
metal like straight

733
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,640
copper and it absorbs into your system

734
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,640
anybody who's counted pennies

735
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,840
you know and they put the 50 pennies in

736
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,679
the sleeve and

737
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,960
you know and you make and you make do a

738
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,159
bunch of them because you have a jar of

739
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,320
pennies kicking by

740
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,840
you get copper poisoning from that it's

741
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,520
critical to get that copper out of your

742
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,039
body because it leads to eczema and

743
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,840
psoriasis dermatitis

744
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,159
rosacea it leads to so many problems it

745
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,279
just leads to skin skin conditions

746
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:17,200
uh galore it just leads to them so

747
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,520
because copper is responsible for

748
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,320
excellent psoriasis a huge part of it so

749
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,240
here we go

750
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,640
let's just do copper thermoses let's

751
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,159
just do copper mugs let's just do copper

752
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,520
everything and um and

753
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:35,200
it's really a toxic toxic heavy metal

754
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,080
copper pipes the reason why family lines

755
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,240
are sick

756
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,279
and riddled with skin conditions like

757
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,840
eczema psoriasis

758
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,600
and other autoimmune conditions is from

759
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,720
copper pipes

760
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,919
and so now we got this trend that

761
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,600
believes

762
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,440
when they don't even know why anybody's

763
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,120
sick because science research doesn't

764
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,960
know anybody why anybody's sick so why

765
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,840
would the copper trend people know why

766
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,720
anybody is sick

767
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,039
um so so the copper trend people are

768
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,960
like

769
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,520
making products out there and people got

770
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,000
their water sitting in that

771
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,960
dear lord i mean it's really bad like

772
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,799
really bad

773
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,240
it's just gonna lead to sickness it's

774
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,600
gonna poison their livers it's gonna

775
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,080
poison their brain

776
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,919
but it really is you keep that water

777
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,640
inside that copper unit

778
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,360
and your water is now contaminated

779
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,480
that's

780
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,240
just yeah that's just a few things i can

781
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,399
say about it so i'll talk about copper a

782
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,039
little bit more on how trace copper's

783
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,440
different

784
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,039
in the soil and even that is not

785
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,480
something we want lots of

786
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:38,000
just so you know copper

787
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,120
is not something that we are

788
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,880
lacking of we have too much

789
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,080
copper all of us there's copper

790
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,360
in the foods we eat too much

791
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,919
there's too much copper in avocado

792
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,760
that's a high copper food too much

793
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,399
copper and avocado

794
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,600
all right because avocado trees tend to

795
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,440
absorb copper more than others

796
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,520
alex says the copper trend comes from

797
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,200
ayurveda for thousands of years

798
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,640
there might be more to it than just the

799
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,000
trend well

800
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,399
here's how it works okay i know what

801
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,120
you're saying because okay airbag so

802
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,760
here's how it works with water there

803
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,159
wasn't

804
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,600
fresh water supplies okay there weren't

805
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,480
fresh water supplies

806
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,320
and a high amount of copper can destroy

807
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,360
an amoeba so in a meat because it's

808
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,240
toxic

809
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:33,039
so amoeba okay certain water parasites

810
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,399
actually get destroyed from copper

811
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,520
poisoning

812
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,200
you see how it works alex so the the

813
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,080
whole thing it went back years ago they

814
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,320
didn't have running

815
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,080
fresh water running water an ayurvedic

816
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,480
in ayurvedic medicine they know this

817
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,880
that going back thousands of years okay

818
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,399
they knew that it was hard to get fresh

819
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,240
water back then you didn't have

820
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,240
fresh water pipes you didn't have spring

821
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,000
water coming out of places it was rare

822
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,559
you can find something like this

823
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,200
villages would be just out of water so

824
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,360
whatever

825
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,640
rain water came down they would keep it

826
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,000
in copper

827
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,960
barrels because the copper poisoning

828
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,559
would kill off not everything you still

829
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,720
can get the worst dysentery

830
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,720
you can still get sick but it would kill

831
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,360
off certain amoeba

832
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,200
certain parasitic um you know

833
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,520
microorganisms that's what it would do

834
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,960
okay and that's what it was used for it

835
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,399
was used for a

836
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:30,399
partly for a war water sanitation

837
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:33,760
control okay because you can poison

838
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:37,200
a microorganism with copper

839
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,080
see how it works that's all it was and

840
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,919
kind of kind of think about stuff okay

841
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,840
does those thousands of years of

842
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,200
smartness that you're talking about

843
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,440
does that fix all the millions of people

844
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,799
with chronic illness um

845
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,559
i'm not gonna pick on different

846
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,520
countries and different places

847
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,559
but disease is rampant rampant and

848
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,240
america

849
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:00,880
disease is rampant here it's rampant

850
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,000
everywhere okay just in the u.s alone

851
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,679
250 275 million americans in the u.s

852
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,240
alone have symptoms they can't get rid

853
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,480
of

854
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,240
symptoms they can't get rid of millions

855
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,360
of children are sick okay

856
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,360
and i get it you want to find some kind

857
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,120
of mysterious thing that's thousands of

858
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,559
years old that might have an

859
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,399
answer but when babies are riddled with

860
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,600
eczema psoriasis and they got ticks and

861
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,120
spasms

862
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,760
and severe tourettes and severe ocd and

863
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,480
autism and everything else it just so

864
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,520
you know

865
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,600
copper makes those conditions worse so

866
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,640
does ayurvedic medicine know that no

867
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,880
they don't

868
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,360
so i get i get it though you want to

869
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,080
kind of you want that nostalgic like

870
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,080
whoa

871
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,000
say your vatic there must be something

872
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,760
to it going all the way back

873
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,760
they must know so much they must know

874
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,320
everything and i understand that

875
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,000
i totally understand that survival

876
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,200
doesn't equal healthy

877
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,840
a survival technique to keep your water

878
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,480
from getting

879
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,120
too riddled with a certain microorganism

880
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,840
by using

881
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,919
copper to control it doesn't mean it's

882
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,480
necessarily healthy and going to give

883
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,679
you

884
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,679
good standing health but see that's more

885
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,159
advanced information than thousands of

886
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,600
years

887
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:18,720
of of um you know antiquated information

888
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,880
you have to think about something a

889
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,880
thousand years ago 2000 years ago they

890
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,440
thought you can fix your brain by eating

891
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,559
brain

892
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,039
that was 2 000 years ago it's antiquated

893
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,519
it doesn't work but am i supposed to

894
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,200
like respect it to the point where

895
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,200
i'm supposed to be like bowed down to

896
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,799
whoa i better bow down to that because a

897
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,880
thousand years ago

898
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,039
they said they said that if you ate

899
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,880
brain you fix your brain i better stitch

900
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,880
a thousand years old alex i better

901
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,960
i better bow down to that aerobatic

902
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,279
medicine well you copper

903
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,279
you can use copper and water to control

904
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,559
bad microorganisms so we better get lots

905
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,919
of copper in our water

906
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,440
because that must be the reason why

907
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,240
we're sick we'll just we'll just drink

908
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,200
the copper

909
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,480
i better bow down to that and here's

910
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,600
another thing too

911
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,200
um mercury elixirs right for thousands

912
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,840
of years

913
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,039
mercury elixirs were big they were big

914
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,120
all around the planet

915
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,880
you drink mercury tonics i better bow

916
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,960
down to it they were right

917
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,080
two thousand three thousand years ago

918
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,799
okay and

919
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,840
in the east okay it was mercury elixirs

920
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,880
mercury elixirs

921
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,519
emperors would take mercury elixirs and

922
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,000
you know

923
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,600
uh presidents would take mercury elixirs

924
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,840
just in the 1800s

925
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,600
are we supposed to bow down to the

926
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,880
mercury elixirs because it's two

927
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,080
thousand three thousand four thousand

928
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,960
years old

929
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,760
i'm curious is does that make sense yeah

930
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,600
i get it

931
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,279
you know there's some things that travel

932
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,919
a long way like massage

933
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,960
like acupressure and they travel

934
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,200
thousands of years

935
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,720
and those are great things but you can't

936
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,320
just all of a sudden assume

937
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,760
that every single thing that comes from

938
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,880
two thousand three thousand years ago is

939
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,519
a great idea

940
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,039
because it's not and fermented foods was

941
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,039
a survival technique

942
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,799
not right there because fermented foods

943
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,880
comes from two thousand three thousand

944
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,360
four thousand years ago that it must be

945
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,240
the panacea to heal us it must actually

946
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,760
be the cure

947
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,399
the cure but you gotta understand

948
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,559
fermented foods are just decomposing

949
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,679
it's it the microorganisms in fermented

950
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,919
foods are the

951
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,080
microorganisms of death that are feeding

952
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,320
off of something that's decomposing

953
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,480
right but that's not the microorganisms

954
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,240
that give you life inside of you

955
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,240
that those microorganisms are only on

956
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,679
living foods when you have cilantro in

957
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,440
your garden

958
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,919
the microorganism that's sitting on the

959
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,440
cilantro why it's sitting there floating

960
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,640
around in the sun and the wind there's a

961
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,480
microorganism in that

962
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,559
that's the one that gives you life so

963
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,080
when you eat that that cilantro that

964
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,000
came out of your garden

965
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,840
that elevated biotic is what gives you

966
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,399
life not

967
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,559
the bacteria that's on something that's

968
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,159
decaying and dying when an animal dies

969
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,360
in the woods it gets engulfed by

970
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,360
bacteria

971
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,799
microorganisms that go to it because

972
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,399
it's dead

973
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,720
when we when we pass on and we start to

974
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,279
go

975
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,399
stale fast after passing on

976
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,519
microorganisms start to devour our body

977
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,919
that's not the microorganism that we get

978
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,560
life from so when the reason why they

979
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,720
did this

980
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,919
is they fermented vegetables was a

981
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,760
survival technique

982
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,520
technique because they had no fresh food

983
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,960
delivered there weren't stores

984
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,800
there weren't grocery stores there

985
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,440
wasn't fresh food grown around the

986
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,839
planet

987
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,079
that can be delivered you know through

988
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,760
plane travel and truck travel

989
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,119
right so what happened was they were in

990
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,599
these little villages

991
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,040
thousands of years ago in the hills and

992
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,480
when your garden ran out

993
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,720
you were you were you were in big

994
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,839
trouble you had your chicken eggs

995
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,440
you had your you had your goat's milk

996
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,800
and you had whatever vegetables that

997
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,200
were left over and you know what you had

998
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,560
to do

999
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,440
you had to take those vegetables and you

1000
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,679
had to throw them in a vat a big old vat

1001
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,520
and throw a lid on it and hope that god

1002
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,240
they just did their natural decaying

1003
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,440
process

1004
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,800
fermented and broke down and

1005
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,880
because you needed to eat that slob

1006
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,280
all winter long in order to keep you

1007
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,680
alive see how it works this is important

1008
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,280
information this is advanced information

1009
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,200
and i teach this to doctors i've been

1010
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,800
teaching this stuff for years okay

1011
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,359
so that fermented foods was a survival

1012
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,880
tactic

1013
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,560
to try to preserve the food long enough

1014
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,920
to get you to the spring

1015
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,040
because you would starve to death

1016
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,560
because you had no freezers and

1017
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,359
refrigerators

1018
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,839
and you had no fresh food coming in

1019
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,960
that's

1020
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:32,000
what happened but we take these old

1021
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,680
things a long time ago and we think

1022
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,920
they must be so good for us and but yet

1023
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,760
there's better things for us fermented

1024
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,119
foods not better than this butter leaf

1025
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,640
lettuce that's fresh and alive and

1026
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,960
filled with enzymes right now

1027
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,560
okay and it's certainly not better than

1028
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,680
butter leaf lettuce that you grew out of

1029
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,599
your garden this year that has

1030
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
microorganisms all over it the kind that

1031
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,079
gives us life

1032
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,880
and fermented food can't beat

1033
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,240
lime right here a lime with the vitamin

1034
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,480
c and the calcium in it

1035
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,440
and it can't be the power of what the

1036
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,400
sun can do and

1037
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,119
and what goes in this orange here and so

1038
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,599
but

1039
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,880
i get it we think thousands of years ago

1040
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,160
ayurvedic medicine

1041
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,320
ayurvedic ayurvedic information um

1042
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,200
copper in the water it must mean it's

1043
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,480
good for us

1044
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,400
that's funny because i talked to the

1045
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,440
best ayurvedic doctors that contact me

1046
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,400
around the planet

1047
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,440
and they don't know why anybody's sick

1048
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,599
they don't

1049
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,359
they have they have their their your

1050
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,760
their guesses about maybe it's

1051
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,760
too much dampness in the body and maybe

1052
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,280
it's the liver acting up somehow or

1053
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,079
maybe it's something

1054
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,280
but they don't know why you have eczema

1055
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,280
raging

1056
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,920
air vedic doctors don't know why

1057
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,880
someone's sick with severe

1058
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,920
chronic fatigue syndrome me but i

1059
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,160
respect them

1060
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,680
greatly i have great respect for the

1061
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,760
best doctors on the planet functional

1062
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,480
medicine doctors ayurvedic doctors

1063
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,680
chinese medicine doctors conventional

1064
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,680
medical doctors

1065
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,359
on the plan great respect for all of

1066
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,200
them i have respect for all of them

1067
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,640
because they're helping people and they

1068
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,920
do help and they do have a lot of

1069
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,280
knowledge but what i'm trying to tell

1070
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,640
you is

1071
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,160
is they don't have answers to why

1072
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,599
anybody's chronically ill they don't

1073
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,359
science research believes it's the body

1074
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,079
destroying itself or it's genes

1075
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,520
that's it so i guess we could package it

1076
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,079
up be like just because

1077
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,440
you know copper holding water back

1078
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,040
thousands of years ago must be the

1079
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,760
fantasy of answers

1080
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,200
just so you know you get you put your

1081
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,480
water in copper

1082
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,839
and you're going to be sicker than ever

1083
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,560
before down the road you're going to get

1084
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,720
so much copper in your system

1085
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,079
in your organs and you're telling me

1086
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,720
everybody just stayed alive and all

1087
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,320
happy no one was ever sick

1088
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,760
you don't know how that stuff was making

1089
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,720
people sicker and sicker and sicker and

1090
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,720
sicker and sicker

1091
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,720
no one's watching that no one's watching

1092
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,480
how how much water did you drink out of

1093
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,839
that copper vat a thousand years ago

1094
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,680
who knows how the person died of a

1095
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,839
horrible death years later

1096
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,920
is anybody studying that no one's

1097
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,680
studying any of that you can't study it

1098
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,000
it's all guesswork it's all guessing

1099
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,320
games so let's make a trend let's make a

1100
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,400
new trend off of some old outdated

1101
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,040
thing that wasn't great so let's make

1102
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,480
copper thermoses so we can poison women

1103
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,000
because that's going to be real good for

1104
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,599
their babies when their babies get all

1105
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,960
that copper in their brain

1106
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,640
can you think about pregnant what about

1107
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,839
pregnant women doing all the copper

1108
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,440
stuff

1109
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,440
if you're going to wear jewelry i would

1110
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,000
wear gold plated because it's protect

1111
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,640
it's going

1112
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,599
over the copper or i would wear gold i

1113
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,839
don't wear jewelry

1114
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,599
but if you're into jewelry i would wear

1115
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,359
gold that's what i would do

1116
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,040
there's always a little copper in gold

1117
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,800
unless it's 24 karat there's always

1118
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,240
alloyed in there but the point is it's

1119
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,599
very much less

1120
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,520
but i wouldn't wear straight copper

1121
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,760
jewelry i wouldn't wear that

1122
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,359
i wouldn't wear copper copper items i

1123
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,119
wouldn't wear copper clothing

1124
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,960
i wouldn't do copper and water god

1125
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,400
forbid if i was a pregnant woman or

1126
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,079
wanting to have a baby

1127
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,000
i certainly wouldn't do any of that

1128
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,680
copper stuff without there's no doubt

1129
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,400
about that unless

1130
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,480
the baby's just gonna get copper uh

1131
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,200
copper in the baby system

1132
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,720
um all the stuff's important so but alex

1133
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,000
i get it and i really appreciate you and

1134
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,960
i appreciate you talking about that

1135
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,079
i actually um wanted to talk about that

1136
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,920
too

1137
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,599
okay plastic pvc i want to talk about

1138
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,520
that that's important too

1139
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,320
is it healthier than copper pipes oh big

1140
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,839
time that's not the leaching plastic

1141
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,680
pcv the hard pcv they use in plumbing

1142
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,880
okay the hard stuff the pvc they use

1143
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,680
in in plumbing is not the leaching

1144
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,599
plastic

1145
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,280
and i would rather in a million years

1146
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,040
have leaching plastic

1147
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,000
any day because plastic comes out of the

1148
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,760
body easy just like lowering your fats

1149
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,440
you know lowering your fats not on too

1150
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,160
much milk cheese butter bringing all

1151
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,680
that down

1152
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,359
making you sure you do the heavy metal

1153
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,800
detox smoothie because spirulina does

1154
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,880
remove plastic

1155
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,359
there's an anti-plastic tee in this book

1156
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,839
right here so um in the new edition but

1157
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,920
the point is plastic comes out easy

1158
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:54,560
and hardened pvc piping

1159
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,280
doesn't leach up anything practically

1160
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,880
practically

1161
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,040
nothing it's it's a whole different

1162
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,440
story than other types of plastic right

1163
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,480
that's one thing the other thing is

1164
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,680
copper pipes

1165
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,040
that's poisoned families for years the

1166
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,280
amount of damage

1167
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,240
copper pipes have done to families and

1168
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,599
their health

1169
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,480
is catastrophic it causes green

1170
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,160
green that green corrosion that goes in

1171
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,319
all the sinks in the toilets if you

1172
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,079
don't have your water softened

1173
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,960
and even if you have your water softened

1174
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,000
you're still going to get copper

1175
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,280
leaching now you may not

1176
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,040
have any control over that if you got

1177
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,720
copper pipes but yes you do

1178
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,319
okay you do have control over that first

1179
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,839
of all make sure your water is filtered

1180
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,119
don't drink it out of the tap that's one

1181
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,640
thing you can control

1182
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,000
the second thing you can control is

1183
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,040
making sure you're doing a heavy metal

1184
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,400
detox smoothie

1185
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,480
so you're proactive in getting the

1186
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,480
copper out faster than it comes in

1187
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,000
so if you're taking your shower and you

1188
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,599
think there could be some copper stuff

1189
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,040
going on in the water

1190
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,240
you can do that check with your doctor

1191
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,359
and see what you're do what's right with

1192
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,960
your doctor you know if you want to do

1193
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,000
the heavy metal detox smoothie some day

1194
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,839
in your life if you want to learn

1195
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,119
about it if you want to find the recipe

1196
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,359
in the book or on the blog

1197
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,640
ask your doctor if it's right for you

1198
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,040
and see how they feel okay if your

1199
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,160
doctor says don't do it don't do it

1200
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,200
but the point is is that you can be

1201
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,119
proactive

1202
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,319
but yes what they're trying to tell you

1203
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,200
now is they're trying to tell you this

1204
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,599
copper pipes

1205
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,319
those are good for you and it's a bad

1206
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,119
trend

1207
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,160
it's a dangerous one i think it's really

1208
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,040
ignorant

1209
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,000
really negligent and it's sad that the

1210
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,160
guessing games have

1211
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,079
to go on in alternative health over and

1212
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,520
over again because in alternative health

1213
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,599
nobody knows why anybody's sick they

1214
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,760
never did and so it's back to the

1215
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,760
guessing games let's go try this now

1216
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,160
okay let's try this now

1217
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,400
you know let's take tons of vinegar and

1218
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,400
destroy all our teeth let's

1219
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,520
you know and and and give us and give us

1220
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,760
osteopenia

1221
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,000
and you know like it's always a guessing

1222
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,760
game and it's so sad you guys

1223
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,680
and if anybody here is watching this

1224
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,640
doesn't believe me and you're like oh no

1225
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,960
he doesn't no

1226
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,880
fine fine do whatever it is you want to

1227
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,960
do do whatever it is you think is right

1228
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,720
do all the copper you want do all

1229
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,720
whatever you want do all the fermented

1230
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,160
foods you want perfectly fine with that

1231
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,599
if you're sick down the road remember

1232
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,720
this information is here for you down

1233
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,839
the road you might have a different

1234
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:09,200
opinion 10 years from now

1235
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,200
you guys are making some salsa

1236
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,079
so much sherry says so much

1237
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,640
contradiction information

1238
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,440
with fat everyone does different i guess

1239
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,440
on different diets no one size fits all

1240
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,920
sure i wish that was true that's not

1241
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,560
true here's how it works

1242
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,160
we're all human beings and our livers

1243
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,280
don't like a lot of fat

1244
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,040
period but we react differently

1245
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,480
because some of our livers are better

1246
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,560
how in better health than

1247
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,920
other people's liver livers okay

1248
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,599
someone's liver

1249
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,119
could be less toxic in the moment in

1250
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,160
their life so they can handle more fat

1251
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,760
and then all of a sudden you're thinking

1252
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,000
well that person's just different

1253
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,359
they're different than me and one one

1254
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,520
size doesn't fit all

1255
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,079
and you know but that's not how it works

1256
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,920
it does fit all if it's all as a huge as

1257
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,160
human the human race

1258
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,640
our pancreases hate a lot of fat in our

1259
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,720
diet and one person's pancreas

1260
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,640
that can get weakened over time can go

1261
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,520
into pancreatitis faster than someone

1262
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,920
else okay

1263
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,520
someone else's liver can get fatty liver

1264
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,240
and get more fat built up in it than

1265
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,480
someone else

1266
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,880
faster than someone else but in the end

1267
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,880
every body gets something

1268
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,200
you can be the one someone can be the

1269
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,960
one that just seems like they do fat

1270
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,560
fine with all that high fat and then

1271
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,359
later on they get their heart attack at

1272
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,200
75

1273
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,560
they get their heart attack at 72. they

1274
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,839
did good all those years

1275
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,680
they were eating all that fat and

1276
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,640
finally all that fat builds up inside

1277
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,960
their arteries

1278
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,480
that fat build up inside their heart and

1279
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,160
boom they got their heart attack just

1280
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,800
like that you know

1281
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,880
so it's important to know okay and like

1282
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,040
all that fat that we're told to eat

1283
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,160
whether it's nuts and seeds and avocados

1284
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,880
and milk cheese butter

1285
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,560
and whatever it is right chicken fat

1286
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,240
gets built up in these arteries

1287
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,839
over time it gets built up inside the

1288
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,319
veins and what

1289
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,720
fat does is it pulls the toxin in and

1290
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,680
then becomes plaque plaque

1291
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,240
is rancid fat hardened on the inside of

1292
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,839
the

1293
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,599
the inside of the heart in arteries and

1294
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,880
veins and blood vessels

1295
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,920
and it's infused with toxins or toxins

1296
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,640
are infused in it

1297
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,119
okay these are radical fats milk cheese

1298
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,200
butter

1299
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,119
eggs coconut oil canola oil olive oil

1300
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,720
all different oils avocados now i'm not

1301
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,079
saying they're not healthy fats i'm not

1302
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,560
saying avocado

1303
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,359
and coconut's not a healthy fat it is

1304
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,520
but what i am

1305
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,920
saying is we inundate ourselves with so

1306
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,880
many fats of all kinds it all becomes

1307
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,480
one in the end

1308
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,400
you're doing chicken too much chicken

1309
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,079
every single day you're doing 10 000

1310
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,920
chickens in 15 years

1311
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,680
it's and then you're still doing coconut

1312
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,040
oil and you're still doing avocado and

1313
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,960
you're still eating nuts

1314
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,720
it builds up and it builds up and you're

1315
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,920
still doing oils and it builds up and

1316
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,440
you're still doing chocolate and it

1317
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,000
builds up and guess what you get the

1318
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,839
plaque

1319
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,160
and you need the stints later on you're

1320
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,160
55 years old you're 65 years old and

1321
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,760
they're running a scope up your arteries

1322
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,560
and intervenes and they're putting

1323
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,640
stints in to keep them from collapsing

1324
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,520
because so much fat build up inside

1325
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,440
those arteries

1326
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,119
meanwhile no one's going to pay the

1327
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,680
price you think all those gurus that

1328
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,960
told you

1329
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,800
tons of fat do you think they're going

1330
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,839
to pay the price and when you're 62

1331
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,960
years old and you're laying on the

1332
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,520
operating table

1333
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,880
no they're not going to care about you

1334
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,560
no one's going to care about you

1335
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,000
all the trend setters that are like

1336
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,480
they're they're like parroting each

1337
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,400
other

1338
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,760
and everybody's afraid to speak up about

1339
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,480
anything and they're all like no no

1340
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,960
fat's great

1341
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,560
lots of fat okay lots of fat too over

1342
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,000
there you think any of them are going to

1343
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,599
care when you're on the operating table

1344
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,440
again you're getting your valve replaced

1345
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,440
because it was just lined with total

1346
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,200
fat and corrosion and all kinds of

1347
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,040
plaque they're not going to care

1348
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,640
but you're going to pay the price 10 15

1349
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,880
years 20 years later

1350
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,680
that's how it works they don't care

1351
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,880
about you all the trendsetters and gurus

1352
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,880

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,839
okay you can always ask your doctor

1479
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,119
what's right for you but that's what i

1480
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,920
recommend friends and family

1481
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,559
to do is lowering their fat intake so

1482
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,559
try not to eat too many fats

1483
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,760
what that means is that you're keeping

1484
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,920
your fats like

1485
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,680
say chicken or beef if you're eating

1486
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,880
animal products to once a day maybe at

1487
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,960
the end of the day

1488
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,640
during the day you're not having a lot

1489
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,680
of avocado you're not having a lot of

1490
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,200
oils oils

1491
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,640
really get the diabetics i'm just going

1492
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,920
to be straight out if there's one thing

1493
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,280
you can do and you can ask your doctor

1494
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,240
what your doctor thinks

1495
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,200
the one thing you can do is minimizing

1496
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,079
your oils

1497
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,480
right there that that alone is a big

1498
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,200
deal

1499
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,640
so i'm going to make this salsa what's

1500
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,839
going to do

1501
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:59,040
and the other thing is it's it's sugar

1502
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:00,720
isn't the demon when it comes down to

1503
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,480
diabetes okay

1504
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,640
uh you shouldn't be on table sugar you

1505
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,800
shouldn't be on unprocessed sugar

1506
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,800
i'm talking about fruit is not the

1507
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,160
problem with diabetics

1508
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,400
it's fats so here's how it works when

1509
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,000
you eat too much fat and fats in your

1510
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,960
bloodstream

1511
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,079
it stops the sugar from getting into

1512
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,359
your cells

1513
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:26,480
we only live function from

1514
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,760
sugar entering our cells that's how we

1515
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,119
can talk walk

1516
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:34,000
hence blood sugar is why we're alive

1517
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,359
right it's blood sugar but the more fat

1518
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,839
you eat

1519
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,520
the more your pancreas gets stressed out

1520
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,800
more your liver is probably gets more

1521
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,280
problematic

1522
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,000
and the more insulin the more fat you

1523
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,000
eat the more

1524
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,119
insulin your pancreas has to release

1525
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,520
that hormone

1526
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,640
in order to bind onto sugar to enter it

1527
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,440
into your cells right

1528
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,640
you lower your fats less insulin needs

1529
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,559
to be produced

1530
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,800
and type 2 diabetes i can't tell you how

1531
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,359
many cases reversed reversed 100 percent

1532
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,520
they don't even have type 2. i i know so

1533
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:06,400
many people that had type 2

1534
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,040
including using insulin with their type

1535
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,319
2

1536
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,559
and other drugs and drugs and they beat

1537
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,920
it

1538
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,599
their type 2 diabetes free for life

1539
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,280
they just had to lower their fats learn

1540
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,640
how to heal you know i mean

1541
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,000
it's just it's great information all

1542
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,920
right let's just make the salsa right

1543
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,599
here we're doing that

1544
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,839
um need a clove of garlic it's one thing

1545
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,960
you can do less garlic you can do a

1546
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,640
little bit of garlic i'm just going to

1547
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,839
use a small clove of garlic

1548
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,839
okay you guys don't mind

1549
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,440
so dark good to see you um you gotta you

1550
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,040
gotta

1551
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,920
you got a thought there question well

1552
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,200
the heart primarily runs on fat the

1553
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,559
heart's a muscle

1554
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,240
it runs on sugar that's how

1555
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,640
misinformation works i'm putting a

1556
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,240
little

1557
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:59,520
garlic inside this this salsa

1558
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,359
your heart is a muscle

1559
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,720
insulin drive sugar into your heart

1560
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:06,400
cells

1561
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,960
that's how it works um

1562
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,119
why do you think doctors still are

1563
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,160
worried about too much red meat

1564
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,319
why do you think doctors

1565
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,520
were worried about too many eggs and too

1566
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,839
much red meat

1567
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,800
because it'll get you a heart attack

1568
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,359
because

1569
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,280
fat here's how it works okay the more

1570
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:27,680
fat you put in your bloodstream

1571
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,960
the harder your heart has to work now

1572
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,640
they didn't know that part that's

1573
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,520
medical medium information

1574
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,440
but the more fat in your bloodstream see

1575
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,400
doctors just believe

1576
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,079
that in the medical the surgeon general

1577
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,760
many many years ago

1578
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,200
many years ago decades ago believed

1579
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,640
and they taught us at the medical

1580
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,640
universities that too much red meat

1581
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,119
and it's going to lead to a heart attack

1582
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,720
and they're right about that

1583
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,440
all that fat's going to plack up and

1584
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,599
build up inside your heart right

1585
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,680
so all that fat running through your

1586
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:04,079
heart okay

1587
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,359
is going to build up inside your heart

1588
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,119
right

1589
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,839
fat thickens the blood and when the

1590
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,599
blood gets thick

1591
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,040
heart has to kill itself to pump it

1592
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,640
through

1593
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,359
it's like it's like sucking a milkshake

1594
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,160
through a straw versus water through a

1595
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,720
straw

1596
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,880
so when your heart's pumping so so dark

1597
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,760
right so dark check this out when your

1598
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,599
heart's pumping

1599
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,079
it's killing itself to suck that fat

1600
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,119
through the the veins to draw that fat

1601
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,760
up through the veins

1602
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,680
the heart is killing itself whoa there's

1603
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,000
so much fat in that blood it's so thick

1604
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,680
i

1605
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,599
can't that's why they give you blood

1606
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,960
thinners you start getting all those

1607
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,319
problems and heart problems and blood

1608
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,680
vessel problems they're just like oh my

1609
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,480
god they start giving you blood thinners

1610
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,920
is what they do

1611
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,920
they're trying to thin out your blood so

1612
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,079
your heart can even pump that stuff

1613
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,079
see so no fat kills your heart

1614
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,079

if you want

1847
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,440
so i got some garlic going here what i

1848
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,720
would do if i had acne i'd be doing the

1849
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,359
369

1850
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,240
clean advanced cleanse repeatedly as an

1851
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,760
option

1852
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,760
that's what i would do so i'd do the

1853
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:03,200
advanced 369 repeatedly

1854
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,880
as an option if i had acne or i would do

1855
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,240
a mono eating cleanse in there i'd be

1856
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,319
doing 32 ounces

1857
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,319
of celery juice if i had acne

1858
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:18,799
okay guys i'm gonna get some garlic in

1859
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:20,720
here making some guacamole as we speak

1860
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,240
and i would make sure there's no grains

1861
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,640
including oatmeal

1862
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,839
oatmeal won't feed strep it won't but

1863
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,839
it's a grain

1864
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,960
that that takes up space and you could

1865
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,079
be eating something else it could be

1866
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,720
more healthful like potato

1867
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,640
or something okay so i'm making the

1868
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,839
guacamole i put some garlic in there and

1869
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,480
