00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
friend of mine was at a yard sale

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,620

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,080

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,439

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,859
one day we Short Circuit

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,380
We Just Lose It We short circuit so many

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,199

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,039
