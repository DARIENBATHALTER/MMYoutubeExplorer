[270.00 - 275.72] your body loves you
[273.08 - 279.72] unconditionally your body will never
[275.72 - 283.64] turn against you your body is working
[279.72 - 288.80] hard for you every day it's fighting for
[283.64 - 293.00] you not fighting against you you can
[288.80 - 294.52] heal your immune system is not attacking
[293.00 - 298.04] your organs and
[294.52 - 302.36] glands it's not your fault that you are
[298.04 - 306.64] sick it's not your fault you're not a
[302.36 - 311.40] bad person you're not a terrible person
[306.64 - 314.44] you didn't do anything wrong you're not
[311.40 - 319.16] faulty you're not sick because you want
[314.44 - 322.28] to be sick you don't have a fear of
[319.16 - 325.40] healing you're not lazy you're not
[322.28 - 328.36] trying to trick anyone you're not trying
[325.40 - 331.12] to trick everyone you're not pretending
[328.36 - 333.76] to be sick you're not doing this on
[331.12 - 337.76] purpose and you're not doing it to try
[333.76 - 340.72] to get attention you're not a weak
[337.76 - 344.12] person you're the opposite you're the
[340.72 - 347.60] opposite of a weak person you are truly
[344.12 - 350.96] a strong person you have a strong light
[347.60 - 354.52] inside of you one that can never be
[350.96 - 358.16] taken away from you you Harbor a life
[354.52 - 360.96] force you have a soul it is more
[358.16 - 363.68] powerful than you know know and no one
[360.96 - 365.04] can ever take that power away from you
[363.68 - 367.60] not even
[365.04 - 370.24] sickness there weren't answers out there
[367.60 - 373.40] for chronic illness all these decades
[370.24 - 376.20] before and because there weren't any
[373.40 - 379.76] answers one of the cornerstones people
[376.20 - 382.96] were told was people had a fear of
[379.76 - 385.40] healing they were sick because they did
[382.96 - 389.72] not want to heal because they were
[385.40 - 393.44] afraid let's face it there is no one I
[389.72 - 396.72] repeat no one who is sick physically
[393.44 - 399.52] emotionally or mentally that doesn't
[396.72 - 401.84] heal because they are afraid to get
[399.52 - 404.60] better that they're scared to
[401.84 - 408.24] heal they could be afraid of something
[404.60 - 412.56] else they could be nervous or scared
[408.24 - 415.96] about the path the journey what it may
[412.56 - 418.92] entail and what it may be about the
[415.96 - 421.48] process or how they may be feeling
[418.92 - 424.16] through the time they are healing but
[421.48 - 427.60] there is no world where they are afraid
[424.16 - 430.12] to heal and that's why they are sick or
[427.60 - 433.96] chronically ill because they're scared
[430.12 - 437.20] there's no place for that people want to
[433.96 - 440.24] heal they want to feel good or at least
[437.20 - 443.88] just good enough any equality of life is
[440.24 - 446.68] sacred and people know this how many
[443.88 - 450.68] people who got sick were told that they
[446.68 - 453.24] were lazy that their fatigue wasn't real
[450.68 - 456.48] they were just struggling with a lack of
[453.24 - 458.96] motivation they had no passion for life
[456.48 - 460.08] their fatigue and tiredness was a lack
[458.96 - 464.32] of
[460.08 - 467.68] Interest a lack of caring and maybe just
[464.32 - 470.72] depression Meanwhile your legs they felt
[467.68 - 475.04] like sandbags and your arms they felt
[470.72 - 477.88] like lead and your body felt so heavy
[475.04 - 481.56] even lifeless like gravity was pulling
[477.88 - 484.72] you down it was not just you being lazy
[481.56 - 489.24] and just plain tired or
[484.72 - 492.52] unmotivated your fatigue was real and is
[489.24 - 495.20] real and you are a warrior to push
[492.52 - 499.60] through each and every day no one
[495.20 - 502.04] realizes that because you are so strong
[499.60 - 505.32] they just don't realize it and they take
[502.04 - 507.48] for granted what you're going through
[505.32 - 511.76] and there are real reasons why you are
[507.48 - 514.44] so sick you're not a weak person instead
[511.76 - 517.52] you are a strong person no matter what
[514.44 - 520.60] you're ailing with when we get sick here
[517.52 - 524.96] on planet Earth we default to thinking
[520.60 - 528.72] we are a bad person it can automatically
[524.96 - 531.48] happen because we feel we aren't as
[528.72 - 535.24] useful sometimes many people feel they
[531.48 - 538.24] are in the way they lost their purpose
[535.24 - 541.68] we are a burden and something is wrong
[538.24 - 545.40] with our body so we start believing that
[541.68 - 548.56] we are a bad person but this is so far
[545.40 - 552.52] from the truth just because we get sick
[548.56 - 555.60] isn't any reason to believe that you or
[552.52 - 558.64] anyone are a bad
[555.60 - 561.64] person when people get sick they've
[558.64 - 565.44] heard this before at some point on their
[561.64 - 567.80] Journey your body has turned against you
[565.44 - 571.48] that's the words that have rolled off of
[567.80 - 574.68] many tongues an answer that brings
[571.48 - 578.72] people no relief it brings people into a
[574.68 - 581.80] darker Place how is it ever possible to
[578.72 - 585.36] really heal believing that your body has
[581.80 - 589.04] betrayed you and won't let you heal and
[585.36 - 591.96] instead is making the opposite happen
[589.04 - 594.64] your body is making you sick the
[591.96 - 597.68] powerful truth is your body will never
[594.64 - 600.84] turn against you instead it's working
[597.68 - 603.64] for you every day and it wants to
[600.84 - 605.88] thrive maybe you know somebody maybe
[603.64 - 609.04] you've been through it yourself people
[605.88 - 612.36] who care for others that are really sick
[609.04 - 615.64] can understand pain and suffering too
[612.36 - 618.56] they see it and they can realize it they
[615.64 - 621.24] watch the person suffer and struggle
[618.56 - 624.20] they watch it and they know how hard it
[621.24 - 627.60] must really be on their friend their
[624.20 - 631.24] loved one their family member they may
[627.60 - 634.88] not be sick themselves or struggling or
[631.24 - 637.92] struggling is bad but they witness it
[634.88 - 641.84] they see it there's something you need
[637.92 - 645.80] to know everyone has the god-given right
[641.84 - 649.16] to heal healing is etched and carved
[645.80 - 652.16] deep within their soul and so many have
[649.16 - 653.96] access their healing powers they just
[652.16 - 657.20] need to learn
[653.96 - 661.56] information that changed everything for
[657.20 - 664.00] them it's possible for all and never
[661.56 - 668.16] doubt your healing strength and healing
[664.00 - 672.04] wisdom because all can heal and never
[668.16 - 675.12] forget you deserve to heal so many
[672.04 - 678.12] people believe they don't deserve to
[675.12 - 682.16] heal and that they never deserved to
[678.12 - 686.36] heal ever but that's not true they do
[682.16 - 689.60] deserve to heal you deserve to heal and
[686.36 - 692.92] live free of sickness you did not miss
[689.60 - 696.36] out on your chance because it's more
[692.92 - 699.44] than just a chance chance comes and goes

[702.12 - 707.80] awaits

[707.80 - 716.28] and around you go high and then down

[716.28 - 721.32] hopes are up when your hopes are down

[721.32 - 730.68] impossible feels like your time is up
