[0.03 - 4.29] are you talking about foods that get us
[1.74 - 6.45] in trouble and how important this is
[4.29 - 9.15] foods that get us in trouble and what
[6.45 - 10.71] it's all about so we're you know on the
[9.15 - 13.23] medical medium number one New York Times
[10.71 - 15.93] bestselling author of the medical medium
[13.23 - 17.76] book series on healing people around the
[15.93 - 19.50] globe books are all over the globe
[17.76 - 21.24] helping people heal today I'm going to
[19.50 - 24.39] talk a little bit about thyroid healing
[21.24 - 25.83] and the epstein-barr virus too so I'm
[24.39 - 28.38] covering deep into the epstein-barr
[25.83 - 30.18] virus information no one's ever heard
[28.38 - 33.03] before information that since I were
[30.18 - 35.46] healing plus some other little tidbits
[33.03 - 38.61] about it but I'm gonna go into foods -
[35.46 - 40.29] foods that get us in trouble and why
[38.61 - 42.18] they get us in trouble because it's so
[40.29 - 43.77] important when you're sick and you're
[42.18 - 45.11] struggling and you're suffering with so
[43.77 - 49.08] many different symptoms and conditions
[45.11 - 52.17] it's critical to know you guys what
[49.08 - 54.60] foods can make it worse not because of a
[52.17 - 56.64] theory not because of a theory out there
[54.60 - 58.65] like avoid gluten because you know
[56.64 - 61.50] inflammation but that nobody knows
[58.65 - 63.93] anything about it or avoid dairy
[61.50 - 66.24] products because of lactose intolerance
[63.93 - 69.08] or it's mucus forming we're gonna go
[66.24 - 71.82] into like the real reasons the true
[69.08 - 75.03] causes to why foods get us in trouble
[71.82 - 76.95] and how we stay sick and how that
[75.03 - 78.87] affects our lives and where that gets us
[76.95 - 81.03] in all of it so this is really an
[78.87 - 82.86] important important show in episode
[81.03 - 84.39] probably one of the most critical
[82.86 - 86.88] episodes so we're gonna go into the
[84.39 - 90.06] epstein-barr virus is responsible for a
[86.88 - 91.53] lot of things and this is a critical
[90.06 - 93.24] aspect of it because when you know what
[91.53 - 95.40] its responsible for then you can
[93.24 - 97.26] actually learn and how to heal it's the
[95.40 - 99.00] most comprehensive book as I read
[97.26 - 101.61] healing about the epstein-barr virus out
[99.00 - 104.19] there this is the virus with over 60
[101.61 - 106.17] varieties of mutations and strains so
[104.19 - 109.65] what does that mean that means it's not
[106.17 - 112.32] just one virus one pathogen that's what
[109.65 - 115.62] it means it means that we have lots of
[112.32 - 117.42] one kind see how it goes so that's an
[115.62 - 119.55] important thing to know right there
[117.42 - 121.92] because what that means is it's hard to
[119.55 - 124.26] detect hard to find hard for doctors to
[121.92 - 126.90] see it hard for bloodwork to even show
[124.26 - 128.94] it all of the above it also means that
[126.90 - 132.31] they're not on the radar of research and
[128.94 - 135.01] science so when viruses mutate in
[132.31 - 136.87] homes they actually become a little
[135.01 - 138.40] different form of themselves creating
[136.87 - 141.91] different illnesses and they have
[138.40 - 144.10] different appetites towards foods that's
[141.91 - 147.37] why what I was saying is foods that get
[144.10 - 149.80] us in trouble because bugs actually eat
[147.37 - 152.26] food so we're gonna cover all of this in
[149.80 - 153.91] detail and you know and this is powerful
[152.26 - 155.47] information you don't want to miss this
[153.91 - 158.02] you want to stay on for this this is
[155.47 - 160.24] gonna be really important so look
[158.02 - 162.07] epstein-barr is responsible for a lot of
[160.24 - 162.67] symptoms and conditions Hashimoto's
[162.07 - 166.69] Graves
[162.67 - 169.51] CFS ms hypothyroidism all of the next
[166.69 - 172.12] most rises that'll I go anxiety even
[169.51 - 175.21] depression and you know symptoms vertigo
[172.12 - 177.97] tinnitus brain fog PCOS endometriosis
[175.21 - 178.57] and that's just that's just a little bit
[177.97 - 180.82] of it
[178.57 - 182.02] EB V is responsible for a lot of
[180.82 - 184.15] different things people are going
[182.02 - 185.68] through so if you're saying to yourself
[184.15 - 186.91] hey wait a minute I have balance issues
[185.68 - 188.89] I have a little bit of her to go I have
[186.91 - 191.02] some tinnitus I have different died
[188.89 - 193.60] popping in the ears I have twitches and
[191.02 - 195.10] tingles and numbness and I have fatigue
[193.60 - 196.72] that the doctors not sure what it's
[195.10 - 198.96] about they think it's my adrenals or
[196.72 - 201.88] they're not sure I've seen bars
[198.96 - 203.62] responsible for these and so much more
[201.88 - 206.86] and that's why it's so it's so important
[203.62 - 208.87] many people think I just believe evb
[206.86 - 210.97] causes everything and they take issue
[208.87 - 212.74] with that and I completely understand I
[210.97 - 213.97] do I completely understand and it comes
[212.74 - 216.85] down to one thing
[213.97 - 218.65] so when critics skeptics think that I'm
[216.85 - 221.02] all about epstein-barr and epstein-barr
[218.65 - 223.84] only comes down to one thing those
[221.02 - 226.51] critics haven't read the medical medium
[223.84 - 228.97] books they haven't read the books it's
[226.51 - 230.92] so important and many people think of
[228.97 - 232.75] the celery juice guy and that's what it
[230.92 - 235.66] is so it's all about celery juice and
[232.75 - 238.03] celery juice only by the way okay come
[235.66 - 240.63] buy celery juice right here and it's not
[238.03 - 242.98] a real big one today but that's alright
[240.63 - 244.42] so many people think I'm just a celery
[242.98 - 246.37] juice guy to the guy that started the
[244.42 - 249.64] celery juice movement around the world
[246.37 - 251.56] and sure okay that's that that's true
[249.64 - 254.11] but it's not that's not what I just
[251.56 - 257.47] damned so what they don't understand is
[254.11 - 260.62] that epstein-barr is not just one virus
[257.47 - 262.17] creating people sicknesses it's the over
[260.62 - 264.87] 60 varieties
[262.17 - 267.81] and they haven't read the medical medium
[264.87 - 269.37] books to learn that information so it's
[267.81 - 270.87] easy for a critic to just pop that out
[269.37 - 272.70] there and say oh he's all about I've
[270.87 - 275.22] seen but I don't even know about the 60
[272.70 - 278.13] varieties and strains and mutations and
[275.22 - 280.44] so it's really important seeing each
[278.13 - 282.96] mutation does different things it's a
[280.44 - 284.34] different beast so every mutation is a
[282.96 - 286.05] different beast causing different
[284.34 - 288.36] symptoms and conditions and that's
[286.05 - 290.49] what's so important to know this means
[288.36 - 293.85] that there's over 60 different pathogens
[290.49 - 297.12] under the label epstein-barr so that's
[293.85 - 301.23] why not just one virus not just one
[297.12 - 304.20] pathogen under the label epstein-barr so
[301.23 - 306.26] and each one has a different appetite it
[304.20 - 308.76] likes to feed off of different foods
[306.26 - 310.86] they all like the feed off of eggs and I
[308.76 - 312.54] talked about that earlier so I tucked
[310.86 - 314.13] that with why eggs make you sick in the
[312.54 - 315.87] last you tube but you've got to see the
[314.13 - 318.06] last one and I have an egg in front of
[315.87 - 319.44] me right here but there's a lot of
[318.06 - 320.70] different varieties of epstein-barr they
[319.44 - 323.55] feed off of different foods and
[320.70 - 324.39] everybody has different varieties that's
[323.55 - 327.33] how it works
[324.39 - 329.52] and so for example some varieties of
[327.33 - 332.28] epstein-barr really love toxic heavy
[329.52 - 334.23] metals so they like copper so here's how
[332.28 - 336.15] it goes with eczema and psoriasis and
[334.23 - 337.77] these I discussed these in thyroid
[336.15 - 339.18] healing I discuss all these different
[337.77 - 340.35] symptoms conditions and illnesses and
[339.18 - 342.39] thyroid healing if you don't have this
[340.35 - 343.98] book get it and educate yourself and and
[342.39 - 346.98] be able to protect yourself and your
[343.98 - 348.51] family it's so important so when the
[346.98 - 351.30] Epstein when a variety of epstein-barr
[348.51 - 354.45] virus likes copper sets the toxic heavy
[351.30 - 356.79] metal that sits inside our liver it it
[354.45 - 358.95] actually consumes it feeds off of it
[356.79 - 361.20] releases it and when it releases it it
[358.95 - 362.97] releases a powerful Dermott oxen that
[361.20 - 364.41] floats through the bloodstream unknown a
[362.97 - 367.35] research in science floats through the
[364.41 - 368.97] bloodstream its services to skin and
[367.35 - 370.74] when it surfaces to the skin the body
[368.97 - 373.35] tries to push it out and that's what
[370.74 - 377.10] causes eczema and psoriasis and that's
[373.35 - 379.08] one variety of epstein-barr and so you
[377.10 - 380.79] know what they what the race bridge
[379.08 - 382.17] research in science loves to say is that
[380.79 - 383.76] your body's attacking itself that your
[382.17 - 385.53] body's attacking its own skin which is
[383.76 - 387.03] impossible the body doesn't work like
[385.53 - 388.68] that I can go into that a little bit
[387.03 - 391.47] more later some varieties of
[388.68 - 392.73] epstein-barr you guys likes mercury and
[391.47 - 395.31] everybody has
[392.73 - 397.17] in them everybody has certain levels of
[395.31 - 398.88] mercury the toxic heavy metal mercury in
[397.17 - 401.88] them is why I love the heavy metal detox
[398.88 - 404.43] movie so I'm not just all about the
[401.88 - 406.53] epstein-barr all about celery juice the
[404.43 - 409.68] heavy metal detox loubies critical if
[406.53 - 411.78] you want to heal it's so important and I
[409.68 - 413.91] want you to know that so the medical
[411.78 - 416.19] medium heavy metal detox movie is so
[413.91 - 418.11] important and I could talk about that a
[416.19 - 421.20] little bit later too so when a virus
[418.11 - 423.78] like epstein-barr loves mercury when it
[421.20 - 426.95] feeds off of it it releases instead of a
[423.78 - 430.02] derma stalks in so much it releases a
[426.95 - 431.64] neurotoxin so when it consumes the foods
[430.02 - 433.47] it likes which I'm going into it why
[431.64 - 436.11] foods get us in trouble I'm gonna go
[433.47 - 439.11] into that a little bit it consumes the
[436.11 - 440.79] foods it likes releases it eliminates it
[439.11 - 443.46] goes to bathroom like we go to bathroom
[440.79 - 445.35] when we eat okay viruses have to go to
[443.46 - 447.15] bathroom pathogens have to go to the
[445.35 - 449.82] bathroom and when it goes to the
[447.15 - 453.03] bathroom it releases a potent powerful
[449.82 - 455.25] neurotoxin and that neurotoxin floats
[453.03 - 458.97] around in the bloodstream and wreaks
[455.25 - 461.94] havoc on what its neurotoxic so it
[458.97 - 465.03] wreaks havoc on the nervous system a
[461.94 - 467.01] central nervous system now most of these
[465.03 - 469.05] Epstein bars release a little bit of
[467.01 - 471.15] derma tox ins along with it if you have
[469.05 - 473.25] a little copper inside of you if you
[471.15 - 475.40] have a little aluminum inside of you and
[473.25 - 478.44] so you may get the combination of
[475.40 - 481.80] neurological symptoms like fatigue which
[478.44 - 484.41] is a neurological symptom or you may get
[481.80 - 486.93] fatigue and a little bit of rashing
[484.41 - 490.20] which could be very mild axilla or
[486.93 - 492.48] patches rashes like lupus like when
[490.20 - 494.07] people get diagnosed with lupus not just
[492.48 - 495.90] the butterfly rashes but the different
[494.07 - 498.09] rashes that's because you have the
[495.90 - 499.68] neurotoxin surfacing and the derma
[498.09 - 502.11] stalks in so that variety of
[499.68 - 504.15] epstein-barr releases these especially
[502.11 - 505.92] the neurotoxin it gives you the fatigue
[504.15 - 506.97] it gives you problems like that you can
[505.92 - 508.95] get diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
[506.97 - 511.23] Lyme disease lupus chronic fatigue
[508.95 - 513.44] syndrome and me so that's what the virus
[511.23 - 516.81] does so this is powerful information
[513.44 - 519.42] this empowers you this can take you out
[516.81 - 521.13] of literally the hell of suffering this
[519.42 - 523.83] information because it has it already
[521.13 - 525.06] has for millions of people globally for
[523.83 - 527.01] over 30 years
[525.06 - 528.36] been doing this for 35 years helping
[527.01 - 531.09] people get better with this information
[528.36 - 533.04] that comes from my source so it's
[531.09 - 535.14] important to have this so you can
[533.04 - 537.54] actually move forward is this an about
[535.14 - 540.33] anything else besides you healing it's
[537.54 - 542.67] critical to know that so some varieties
[540.33 - 545.28] of epstein-barr virus like the feed off
[542.67 - 547.53] of cell tissue itself so they like the
[545.28 - 549.09] feed off of cell tissue so instead of
[547.53 - 552.06] just feeding off of a toxic heavy metals
[549.09 - 554.15] like mercury or aluminum the virus likes
[552.06 - 556.41] to feed off of your cell tissue so
[554.15 - 558.33] thyroid disorders Hashimoto's
[556.41 - 560.31] thyroiditis the inflammation that's
[558.33 - 562.59] caused inside the thyroid and I talked
[560.31 - 566.82] about that really really clearly if I
[562.59 - 568.65] were healing okay and that what happens
[566.82 - 571.29] is that variety of virus feeds off of
[568.65 - 573.75] cells cells inside your thyroid and it
[571.29 - 576.18] causes inflammation see it's not your
[573.75 - 578.37] body attacking itself like they want you
[576.18 - 579.87] to believe because that disempowers you
[578.37 - 582.39] want to go into that a little later how
[579.87 - 584.01] that that body shames and disempowers
[582.39 - 586.26] and just really makes people feel like
[584.01 - 587.82] the faulty really makes people feel like
[586.26 - 591.00] they're worthless so I'm going to go
[587.82 - 594.03] into how that works later on so when a
[591.00 - 595.83] virus feeds off of cell tissue in like
[594.03 - 597.99] forensic example feeds off of your
[595.83 - 599.64] thyroid cell tissue you can get the
[597.99 - 601.86] thyroid asaurus hyperthyroidism
[599.64 - 604.38] Hashimoto's thyroiditis you get the
[601.86 - 606.44] beginning stages of hypothyroidism and
[604.38 - 609.03] you can be you could get the stages of
[606.44 - 611.37] nodules you can get the stages of cysts
[609.03 - 613.17] thyroid cancer so that's one variety of
[611.37 - 614.61] epstein-barr many of them go to the
[613.17 - 616.11] thyroid so many of them go to the
[614.61 - 618.99] thyroid and do different things in the
[616.11 - 620.55] thyroid so the viruses have mutated over
[618.99 - 623.40] time there's over 60 varieties like I
[620.55 - 626.07] talked about before but that's one type
[623.40 - 627.84] and then you've got the aluminum feeding
[626.07 - 629.85] viruses which is the epstein-barr
[627.84 - 632.19] variety that loves aluminum and guess
[629.85 - 635.85] where that goes to guess what happens
[632.19 - 639.42] when that virus has an aluminum you know
[635.85 - 640.95] desire and it eats aluminum and what
[639.42 - 643.29] happens there is you end up with
[640.95 - 645.69] vitiligo you end up with the white spots
[643.29 - 649.02] the discoloration because here's how it
[645.69 - 651.24] works so important to know this and the
[649.02 - 653.16] virus feeds off of aluminum which sits
[651.24 - 655.18] inside the liver that's where all our
[653.16 - 656.86] toxic heavy metals go in that's why
[655.18 - 658.48] say hey you guys you got to get rid of
[656.86 - 661.87] your toxic heavy metals it's so
[658.48 - 664.03] important and it matters so much that's
[661.87 - 665.92] why I want you to do that really huddle
[664.03 - 668.23] up look good good spirulina I always
[665.92 - 670.30] talk about all the good stuff that you
[668.23 - 672.07] need and and how the heavy metal detox
[670.30 - 673.90] smoothie and the wild blueberries and
[672.07 - 675.40] all of it because you've got to get rid
[673.90 - 677.53] of the toxic heavy metals out of your
[675.40 - 679.42] liver because when aluminum is sitting
[677.53 - 681.70] inside the body and sitting inside the
[679.42 - 684.01] liver you guys what happens is that
[681.70 - 686.05] variety of epstein-barr loves to feed
[684.01 - 687.94] off of it and when it eliminates it goes
[686.05 - 690.52] to the bathroom and releases it it
[687.94 - 692.44] floats around it surfaces to the skin
[690.52 - 694.87] and it kills the melanin pigment cells
[692.44 - 697.00] it destroys them and that's why you get
[694.87 - 700.66] the spots the white spots everywhere
[697.00 - 703.60] that's that variety of virus so you know
[700.66 - 705.61] these are some examples of you know
[703.60 - 707.32] foods that these different varieties of
[705.61 - 708.43] epstein-barr like to feed on in the
[707.32 - 710.50] moment I'm going to show you some other
[708.43 - 712.33] foods and that's that's that's gonna be
[710.50 - 714.28] a big one today - a big part of today so
[712.33 - 715.63] you want to stay on for this this is you
[714.28 - 718.24] don't want to miss this this is gonna be
[715.63 - 721.48] really fun - look we eat to stay alive
[718.24 - 724.21] we have to stay alive or we die okay
[721.48 - 727.24] that's how it works here so does every
[724.21 - 730.24] single packaging every single micro
[727.24 - 732.76] organism on the planet living organism
[730.24 - 734.35] has to eat something so when science
[732.76 - 735.64] research keeps that all from you and
[734.35 - 738.19] they don't tell you that they use
[735.64 - 741.60] Mercury to keep these things alive in
[738.19 - 744.22] labs that they feed all these bugs eggs
[741.60 - 745.60] okay like I said and why eggs make you
[744.22 - 747.19] sick if you haven't seen them and you
[745.60 - 748.90] got to go back to that one and look at
[747.19 - 752.35] that YouTube you know when you can at
[748.90 - 755.41] that episode after this but so because
[752.35 - 757.63] these these bugs need food so critical
[755.41 - 759.82] to know every single living
[757.63 - 761.14] microorganism viruses and different
[759.82 - 763.09] varieties of viruses like different
[761.14 - 765.04] foods this is advanced medical
[763.09 - 766.69] information straight from my source that
[765.04 - 769.39] public research and science is unaware
[766.69 - 770.89] of yet and it's so important so when I'm
[769.39 - 772.36] talking about what foods get us in
[770.89 - 774.58] trouble and how foods get us in trouble
[772.36 - 777.16] and all that one I talk about that later
[774.58 - 779.02] it's advanced food information that
[777.16 - 780.43] isn't out there because no one knows
[779.02 - 781.81] they're all playing guessing games and
[780.43 - 784.45] they don't know why foods really make
[781.81 - 786.61] you sick so this is so great to notice
[784.45 - 790.66] Nathan's been delivering it for years
[786.61 - 793.75] and years okay so viruses take different
[790.66 - 795.85] pathways so I'm going to talk about the
[793.75 - 798.04] pathways where they go from the liver to
[795.85 - 800.25] the thyroid to the ovaries different
[798.04 - 803.44] areas okay one variety of epstein-barr
[800.25 - 805.30] goes from the liver to the thyroid so
[803.44 - 807.49] let's talk about that now we're heading
[805.30 - 811.03] we're gonna head into that and then
[807.49 - 814.66] what's left of that virus goes to the
[811.03 - 817.66] ovaries and creates PCOS so PCOS a
[814.66 - 820.24] reproductive condition okay a cystic
[817.66 - 822.61] reproductive condition is caused by
[820.24 - 826.09] epstein-barr that's what creates assist
[822.61 - 828.55] assist a fluid-filled cysts cannot be
[826.09 - 831.13] created on its own it doesn't work like
[828.55 - 833.41] that I know they want people to believe
[831.13 - 835.36] that it's the woman's body that's faulty
[833.41 - 839.05] if something must be wrong with her and
[835.36 - 841.93] then she's causing it I know this is the
[839.05 - 844.66] medical system big pharma and you know
[841.93 - 847.18] whoever else wants women to believe that
[844.66 - 849.13] but see a fluid-filled cysts can't
[847.18 - 852.52] develop on its own it doesn't work that
[849.13 - 854.71] way there has to be a cause and there is
[852.52 - 856.03] the epstein-barr virus and does go to
[854.71 - 858.37] the ovaries it goes a reproductive
[856.03 - 859.66] system it causes a lot of reproductive
[858.37 - 863.38] problems I'm going to talk about that a
[859.66 - 865.24] little later too so then also the the
[863.38 - 866.80] epstein-barr virus it's inside the liver
[865.24 - 868.36] and it goes straight to the fiber it
[866.80 - 870.64] goes to travels to the thyroid it
[868.36 - 872.92] creates hypothyroidism later for women
[870.64 - 874.93] and and it can create it years later
[872.92 - 876.57] somebody could have a milder form of
[874.93 - 879.16] epstein-barr virus and it could create
[876.57 - 880.72] hyperthyroidism years later somebody
[879.16 - 882.58] could have a much more much more
[880.72 - 884.38] aggressive variety on the 60 varieties
[882.58 - 886.27] and it could create problems even more
[884.38 - 888.04] aggressively coughs and bam you get the
[886.27 - 889.36] worst Hashimoto's thyroiditis you're
[888.04 - 890.86] really sick you're at the doctor's
[889.36 - 892.36] office doctors telling you it's your
[890.86 - 894.67] body attacking itself it's listed under
[892.36 - 896.74] not on the in condition when really you
[894.67 - 898.24] have a viral infection and that's what
[896.74 - 900.79] it really is talking about thyroid
[898.24 - 901.81] healing - incredible book to have if you
[900.79 - 903.55] don't have it you got to go to
[901.81 - 904.96] amazon.com and get it or go to the
[903.55 - 906.94] library and get it for free I tell
[904.96 - 908.35] people get it for free doesn't matter to
[906.94 - 908.74] me I just want everybody to have being
[908.35 - 912.28] from
[908.74 - 914.50] and he'll so okay so let's talk about
[912.28 - 916.00] other things here while another variety
[914.50 - 917.86] of epstein-barr will go to the thyroid
[916.00 - 919.57] but it'll also stay in the liver most
[917.86 - 921.34] all varieties of epstein-barr do you
[919.57 - 923.29] stay back into the liver a little bit
[921.34 - 925.06] where they feed off of copper like I
[923.29 - 926.95] said they feed off of other pollutants
[925.06 - 929.59] inside the liver the livers a garbage
[926.95 - 932.83] dump and that's why you know I wrote the
[929.59 - 934.42] book liver rescue okay that's why I
[932.83 - 935.95] wrote the book liver rescue livers a
[934.42 - 938.17] garbage dump it harbors all these
[935.95 - 939.88] different toxins so you know and and so
[938.17 - 941.83] these viruses like the stay back into
[939.88 - 943.66] the liver in the whole bit and they like
[941.83 - 946.63] the feed off of copper to create eczema
[943.66 - 949.30] and psoriasis viruses like the
[946.63 - 951.13] epstein-barr love to create eye problems
[949.30 - 953.47] they love to create floaters in the eyes
[951.13 - 955.27] they even love to create glaucoma that's
[953.47 - 957.70] one thing that happens
[955.27 - 959.92] Epstein Marcos the breast tissue creates
[957.70 - 961.72] breast cancer another variety of
[959.92 - 963.91] epstein-barr will cause lupus will cause
[961.72 - 966.21] multiple sclerosis another variety will
[963.91 - 968.53] cause Lyme disease Lyme disease our
[966.21 - 970.57] neural basically Lyme disease is
[968.53 - 973.27] neurological Lyme it's neurological
[970.57 - 975.70] condition it's basically neurological
[973.27 - 978.19] fatigue and different tics and spasms
[975.70 - 980.80] and twitches and weak nervous systems
[978.19 - 982.78] and like you feel like your legs or
[980.80 - 984.34] cement bags and it can be listed under
[982.78 - 985.84] Lyme disease it dr. be like well you
[984.34 - 987.28] probably got Lyme disease another doctor
[985.84 - 988.51] might be like whoa you got a little bit
[987.28 - 990.01] of this you got a little bit of that
[988.51 - 993.28] everybody gives it different diagnosis
[990.01 - 995.38] but so let's go into like that as we can
[993.28 - 997.72] doctors are finally learning now because
[995.38 - 999.82] of this information that Lyme disease is
[997.72 - 1001.26] viral so we're gonna cover that for a
[999.82 - 1002.85] minute if you got if you guys got a
[1001.26 - 1005.13] second I'm gonna drink a little bit of
[1002.85 - 1008.55] this because I'm I'm seeking out the
[1005.13 - 1011.79] information got a little bit of celery
[1008.55 - 1014.49] juice I hope you're doing your celery
[1011.79 - 1017.63] juice I hope you are so important
[1014.49 - 1020.28] okay so Lyme disease is no longer
[1017.63 - 1022.41] bacterial sure the doctors will still
[1020.28 - 1023.88] call it bacterial some of them still
[1022.41 - 1025.77] think it's many of them still think it's
[1023.88 - 1029.01] still bacterial but it's it was a
[1025.77 - 1033.12] bacterial theory is what it was so all
[1029.01 - 1036.15] that bombardment of antibiotics to women
[1033.12 - 1038.78] mostly women and some men
[1036.15 - 1042.15] over the decades the amount of
[1038.78 - 1046.26] antibiotic abuse the negligence
[1042.15 - 1050.34] over the decades I mean the Lyme trail
[1046.26 - 1051.42] is brutal the line past is brutal it's
[1050.34 - 1053.73] unbelievable
[1051.42 - 1055.71] it's still not much better but because
[1053.73 - 1058.02] of the medical medium information
[1055.71 - 1059.76] because it went worldwide in all the
[1058.02 - 1062.76] books around the globe and people got
[1059.76 - 1065.25] wise and they learned that Lyme disease
[1062.76 - 1068.10] was viral it's all changing now
[1065.25 - 1070.41] that's how cats claw the herb is now
[1068.10 - 1071.82] being used in doctors offices across the
[1070.41 - 1073.74] globe and around the country
[1071.82 - 1076.68] that's from original medical medium
[1073.74 - 1079.08] information going back many years and so
[1076.68 - 1081.60] there's a reason for that because it was
[1079.08 - 1083.16] always viral and I'm gonna tell you
[1081.60 - 1085.68] something that's really interesting if
[1083.16 - 1088.08] you're like okay there's no way that's
[1085.68 - 1091.38] not what it says out there he's wrong oh
[1088.08 - 1094.56] yeah they secretly moved Lyme disease
[1091.38 - 1097.59] into the autoimmune disease category
[1094.56 - 1099.90] okay now in order to move Lyme disease
[1097.59 - 1103.56] into the autoimmune disease category
[1099.90 - 1105.57] it can't be bacterial that's how it
[1103.56 - 1107.76] works the medical medium books and
[1105.57 - 1110.76] information has pushed the medical
[1107.76 - 1113.88] system into the direction of putting it
[1110.76 - 1116.73] in to autoimmune they wanted to classify
[1113.88 - 1118.92] that now because it protects them is
[1116.73 - 1121.08] what it does it also determines that
[1118.92 - 1123.21] they don't know the true cause because
[1121.08 - 1125.70] autoimmune disease causes are all
[1123.21 - 1127.11] unknown by research and science the Lyme
[1125.70 - 1129.69] disease was put into the autoimmune
[1127.11 - 1132.66] category so that means they just decided
[1129.69 - 1134.88] behind everybody's back basically they
[1132.66 - 1137.31] just decided that bacteria is not the
[1134.88 - 1138.75] cause that causes unknown for Lyme
[1137.31 - 1140.28] disease so you got all these doctors and
[1138.75 - 1142.14] all these decades of work and they're
[1140.28 - 1144.30] all been told as bacteria and you got
[1142.14 - 1146.49] the line labs all kind of working with
[1144.30 - 1148.08] that and I could say well why does the
[1146.49 - 1151.13] line lab come up with this and that the
[1148.08 - 1154.68] line labs they work on a basis of
[1151.13 - 1156.72] inflated inflammation so they work on
[1154.68 - 1159.15] inflammation so when they say a Borrelia
[1156.72 - 1161.40] and they say you have art nella and they
[1159.15 - 1163.02] see it the B Ziya they don't see the
[1161.40 - 1165.21] Bartonella they don't see them Ibiza
[1163.02 - 1166.82] they don't see the Borrelia they just
[1165.21 - 1168.89] see inflammation
[1166.82 - 1170.45] system just like an anti-nuclear antigen
[1168.89 - 1173.45] antibody test just like c-reactive
[1170.45 - 1176.96] protein tests they're all inflammation
[1173.45 - 1179.81] detecting tests so it's the whole thing
[1176.96 - 1181.43] has been a scam and a sham for so long
[1179.81 - 1183.20] with Lyme disease and they've been
[1181.43 - 1185.15] making billions because of it on
[1183.20 - 1187.16] antibiotics cuz that's the whole point
[1185.15 - 1188.30] it was to make billions and billions and
[1187.16 - 1189.92] billions and billions and hundreds of
[1188.30 - 1194.15] billions of dollars off antibiotics for
[1189.92 - 1195.56] decades and that's how it works so so
[1194.15 - 1198.08] Lyme disease was placed into the
[1195.56 - 1200.33] autoimmune category which they know they
[1198.08 - 1202.34] don't have an answer now that's how it
[1200.33 - 1203.90] works but you got all these you got all
[1202.34 - 1205.49] these old dogs meaning they've been
[1203.90 - 1207.50] doing it for so many years of pumping so
[1205.49 - 1209.60] many antibiotics and so many people for
[1207.50 - 1211.25] decades and they just you know they're
[1209.60 - 1212.69] already married to their system that
[1211.25 - 1214.79] they've been that they've been involved
[1212.69 - 1216.62] with that was created by by the theory
[1214.79 - 1219.32] to begin with and it's hard to come out
[1216.62 - 1220.82] of that but the younger doctors doctors
[1219.32 - 1223.94] have want people to heal they're
[1220.82 - 1225.71] learning now about this information and
[1223.94 - 1227.00] and some of the older doctors too and
[1225.71 - 1228.83] have a lot of experience of learning
[1227.00 - 1231.50] about it and it pushed it into the
[1228.83 - 1232.16] different category so it's so important
[1231.50 - 1235.49] to know this
[1232.16 - 1237.62] um Borrelia Babesia Bartonella they're
[1235.49 - 1239.75] not superbugs they can be killed off by
[1237.62 - 1241.40] antibiotics extremely easy
[1239.75 - 1245.00] they're not superbugs they're not like
[1241.40 - 1246.86] MRSA nurses got a much higher rate of
[1245.00 - 1248.81] healing through antibiotics is an
[1246.86 - 1251.60] incredible mercy so much Merces a
[1248.81 - 1254.21] superbug literally a superbug
[1251.60 - 1257.90] but for some reason mercer can be healed
[1254.21 - 1260.00] with antibiotics so why why can why
[1257.90 - 1263.09] cannot be healed without the antibiotics
[1260.00 - 1265.19] but yet Borrelia Bartonella can because
[1263.09 - 1266.93] it can cause it does get killed off
[1265.19 - 1269.93] because when you're viral
[1266.93 - 1272.03] antibiotics do not stop viruses so
[1269.93 - 1274.16] that's what happens you got a whole wake
[1272.03 - 1276.29] of people suffering from Lyme disease
[1274.16 - 1278.12] even today right now and getting Lyme
[1276.29 - 1279.83] disease diagnosis and they were
[1278.12 - 1281.66] bombarded with antibiotics that's why
[1279.83 - 1283.58] Lyme doctors now are doing less and less
[1281.66 - 1286.25] antibiotics and smaller amounts and
[1283.58 - 1288.86] smaller dosages and milder forms of it
[1286.25 - 1290.24] and then they're bringing in supplements
[1288.86 - 1292.25] and all kinds of herbs and different
[1290.24 - 1294.50] things because they know they're
[1292.25 - 1296.96] learning because the antibiotics wreaked
[1294.50 - 1298.68] havoc and broke people down made them
[1296.96 - 1301.17] sicker for so many
[1298.68 - 1303.06] decades I'm not against antibiotics I'm
[1301.17 - 1304.62] not against antibiotics in the use
[1303.06 - 1307.08] they're needed for for certain things
[1304.62 - 1309.66] that's not what this is about but for
[1307.08 - 1311.73] Lyme disease this huge mistake was made
[1309.66 - 1313.20] see Lyme disease in early 1970s when it
[1311.73 - 1314.88] was discovered there was a group of very
[1313.20 - 1317.49] smart intelligent doctors and for 'allah
[1314.88 - 1320.01] gist that believed it was viral but you
[1317.49 - 1321.36] can't make money back then in the 70s or
[1320.01 - 1323.79] the 80s because there were no
[1321.36 - 1325.53] medications for viruses when a doctor
[1323.79 - 1327.57] attorney when diagnosis was viral or
[1325.53 - 1330.27] they believed a diagnosis was viral
[1327.57 - 1332.07] there was no answer so no money was made
[1330.27 - 1333.60] ever except for the doctor's appointment
[1332.07 - 1336.18] itself but there were no drugs being
[1333.60 - 1338.49] sold so they classified it as bacteria
[1336.18 - 1340.80] so Big Pharma classified it as bacteria
[1338.49 - 1343.41] to make sure they can sell tremendous
[1340.80 - 1346.50] amounts of antibiotics that's how the
[1343.41 - 1348.24] business runs so it was put so all these
[1346.50 - 1350.61] doctors were indoctrinated to believe it
[1348.24 - 1352.29] was bacterial so they bombarded people
[1350.61 - 1354.87] on the MARTA people for decades made a
[1352.29 - 1357.45] wake of hell and and I mean so many
[1354.87 - 1359.34] lives were lost over this and it wasn't
[1357.45 - 1361.86] the doctors fault I mean that's not what
[1359.34 - 1363.96] it is the system creates this bacteria
[1361.86 - 1365.19] cannot cause neurological symptoms I'm
[1363.96 - 1367.35] gonna go into that for a little bit
[1365.19 - 1370.50] right here thank you for coming on my
[1367.35 - 1372.51] new youtube channel little bit covering
[1370.50 - 1374.16] serious topics so you can learn and
[1372.51 - 1375.84] he'll talk about thyroid healing you
[1374.16 - 1377.85] don't have the book at amazon.com and
[1375.84 - 1379.32] get it it's you won't make a mistake
[1377.85 - 1381.12] getting that book when you read it
[1379.32 - 1382.50] you'll be blown away I can't cover even
[1381.12 - 1385.98] a fraction of the information in that
[1382.50 - 1387.84] book so let's go into the whole bit here
[1385.98 - 1390.42] of where we're heading now bacteria
[1387.84 - 1393.87] cannot cause neurological symptoms
[1390.42 - 1395.91] bacteria does not cause the aches and
[1393.87 - 1397.65] pains it does not cause the tangles in
[1395.91 - 1399.72] numbness does not cause the ringing in
[1397.65 - 1401.10] the ears does not cause all the
[1399.72 - 1403.02] different neurological symptoms the eye
[1401.10 - 1404.73] floaters two twitches the spasms the
[1403.02 - 1406.77] burning pain all over the body the
[1404.73 - 1409.19] neuropathy burning pain on a feet
[1406.77 - 1411.66] burning pain on the hands all of that
[1409.19 - 1413.37] bacteria doesn't cause all of the
[1411.66 - 1415.20] neurological impatient conditions
[1413.37 - 1416.67] including that neurological fatigue the
[1415.20 - 1418.26] eye floaters like I said the vertigo the
[1416.67 - 1420.93] dizziness the tinnitus the severe
[1418.26 - 1423.51] anxiety bacteria can't cause severe
[1420.93 - 1425.49] anxiety so important to know they cannot
[1423.51 - 1426.11] create neurotoxins see this is how it
[1425.49 - 1429.08] works
[1426.11 - 1431.93] bacteria when feeding off of food
[1429.08 - 1435.59] can't release a neurotoxin only a virus
[1431.93 - 1436.70] can so when bacteria eats the foods that
[1435.59 - 1438.11] I'm going to show you guys if you guys
[1436.70 - 1439.76] just came on and everything and you're
[1438.11 - 1441.50] here right now I can't wait to show you
[1439.76 - 1443.51] the foods and we're gonna talk about why
[1441.50 - 1445.85] foods get us in trouble which foods get
[1443.51 - 1448.61] us in trouble you won't believe it you
[1445.85 - 1451.91] will be very happy about this episode so
[1448.61 - 1453.77] when bacteria feeds off of foods then it
[1451.91 - 1455.36] likes it can't release a potent
[1453.77 - 1457.88] neurotoxin remember what I was saying
[1455.36 - 1459.80] before a neurotoxin creates damage to
[1457.88 - 1462.77] the neurological system it creates
[1459.80 - 1465.08] damage in a way where it hampers it down
[1462.77 - 1466.88] it dampers it down it brings it down and
[1465.08 - 1468.71] he'd get fatigued and your legs feel
[1466.88 - 1470.84] kind of heavy and you feel fatigued why
[1468.71 - 1473.27] am i slept all these hours last night
[1470.84 - 1475.10] why am I still tired I slept a zillion
[1473.27 - 1477.17] hours last night why am I still tired
[1475.10 - 1478.58] and that's what happens where you're
[1477.17 - 1480.08] like what's going on and then you get
[1478.58 - 1481.52] diagnosed a little bit of dream fatigue
[1480.08 - 1483.11] then you get told your hormones are off
[1481.52 - 1485.30] because the doctors have no idea why you
[1483.11 - 1486.65] have T then you think well loss of
[1485.30 - 1488.48] libido fatigue and all these other
[1486.65 - 1490.52] things it must be my hormones it must be
[1488.48 - 1491.87] something else and that's it happens and
[1490.52 - 1493.55] if the fatigue sticks around too long
[1491.87 - 1495.95] after they've played around with all
[1493.55 - 1497.48] your different step stuff after if it
[1495.95 - 1499.10] sticks around too long you might get a
[1497.48 - 1500.54] final you might finally get a lot of
[1499.10 - 1502.16] disease diagnosis you might get some
[1500.54 - 1503.15] kind of other diagnosis then all of a
[1502.16 - 1505.16] sudden they're looking for other things
[1503.15 - 1507.32] so many women around the country mostly
[1505.16 - 1509.33] women and then now this fatigue is
[1507.32 - 1511.46] neurological fatigue and it's not
[1509.33 - 1513.47] bacteria bacteria can't create a
[1511.46 - 1514.94] neurotoxin which hampers and weakens the
[1513.47 - 1517.01] nervous system you guys should watch
[1514.94 - 1518.96] this whole thing all over again I'm not
[1517.01 - 1520.67] even halfway done here but you gotta
[1518.96 - 1522.76] watch this whole episode all over again
[1520.67 - 1526.31] the information is really intense and
[1522.76 - 1527.96] and I understand that so the body aches
[1526.31 - 1529.67] and pains nerve pain all through the
[1527.96 - 1532.10] body the fibromyalgia the tics the
[1529.67 - 1535.10] spasms twitches these are all viral
[1532.10 - 1537.44] symptoms you guys and people suffer with
[1535.10 - 1539.27] it and it breaks my heart to know people
[1537.44 - 1540.83] suffer that bad they don't have answers
[1539.27 - 1542.21] they've been to ten neurologists so even
[1540.83 - 1544.07] if you go to one neurology so you go to
[1542.21 - 1545.63] your internist you go to your GP you go
[1544.07 - 1547.76] to one a neurologist it's just too much
[1545.63 - 1549.35] you know making appointments making
[1547.76 - 1550.79] having your life all I've seen with
[1549.35 - 1551.75] younger people to twenty years old and
[1550.79 - 1553.40] nineteen years old and their life is
[1551.75 - 1556.04] already about doctor's appointments I
[1553.40 - 1557.42] mean what kind of world are we in right
[1556.04 - 1558.41] now where science of research just
[1557.42 - 1562.10] doesn't have the back
[1558.41 - 1564.67] of people for with chronic illness when
[1562.10 - 1567.74] there are answers it's amazing really so
[1564.67 - 1569.78] look fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis
[1567.74 - 1571.19] lupus PCOS reproductive problems and
[1569.78 - 1573.62] then we Teresa's all these things all
[1571.19 - 1575.42] these things that people go through the
[1573.62 - 1577.34] hot flashes the heart palpitations so
[1575.42 - 1579.86] many different systems it's symptoms
[1577.34 - 1583.64] it's based on viruses it's based on
[1579.86 - 1585.08] viruses releasing poisons and causing
[1583.64 - 1586.76] problems this is why so many people's
[1585.08 - 1589.79] Lyme disease get them to get the thyroid
[1586.76 - 1592.19] test I mean their thyroid problem okay
[1589.79 - 1594.32] they're one of the reasons why they were
[1592.19 - 1596.30] put they pushed Lyme disease into the
[1594.32 - 1598.85] autumn the autoimmune category is
[1596.30 - 1600.83] because it was getting kind of
[1598.85 - 1602.30] suspicious too with the medical medium
[1600.83 - 1603.98] information going out there teaching
[1602.30 - 1605.51] people about the thyroid problem being
[1603.98 - 1606.83] viral and the thyroid problem being
[1605.51 - 1609.20] epstein-barr because that information
[1606.83 - 1612.14] came from the medical medium information
[1609.20 - 1614.00] stats came from this source only that
[1612.14 - 1616.07] your thyroid problem and your
[1614.00 - 1618.23] Hashimoto's thyroiditis is caused by
[1616.07 - 1619.91] epstein-barr and now you'll see data out
[1618.23 - 1621.11] there because what they do is you know
[1619.91 - 1622.73] they don't want the medical medium
[1621.11 - 1624.74] getting all the credit all the time so
[1622.73 - 1626.42] then they try to put they try to put
[1624.74 - 1628.07] articles out there as if it came from
[1626.42 - 1630.47] somewhere else but this this was way
[1628.07 - 1632.09] before all of that I mean it's that well
[1630.47 - 1634.28] document to be way before all of that
[1632.09 - 1637.04] and what happens is the the epstein-barr
[1634.28 - 1638.51] virus that causes thyroid problems for
[1637.04 - 1639.95] the when they noticed everybody with
[1638.51 - 1642.41] Lyme disease was getting thyroid
[1639.95 - 1644.21] problems so that was another thing so
[1642.41 - 1647.12] doctors are like scratching your head
[1644.21 - 1648.83] they're like well you know what I mean
[1647.12 - 1650.03] it's everybody has the thyroid problems
[1648.83 - 1652.10] everybody has these other issues
[1650.03 - 1654.35] everybody all the Lyme people have
[1652.10 - 1656.72] fibromyalgia so just starting to belief
[1654.35 - 1658.61] wait a minute we're off here because
[1656.72 - 1661.07] bacteria doesn't cause any of that so
[1658.61 - 1661.67] it's viral so it's so important to know
[1661.07 - 1663.86] these things
[1661.67 - 1666.47] that's why a majority of people have not
[1663.86 - 1669.32] gotten better that's why a majority of
[1666.47 - 1671.30] people have not gotten better on
[1669.32 - 1673.55] antibiotics what I mean in majority I
[1671.30 - 1676.10] mean the majority and antibiotic
[1673.55 - 1678.92] treatments for Lyme disease that's why
[1676.10 - 1681.14] they haven't gotten better because it's
[1678.92 - 1682.70] viral so I'm just trying to spell it out
[1681.14 - 1685.46] for you see you have you're empowered
[1682.70 - 1686.99] you have the information you have the
[1685.46 - 1688.91] strength all of it
[1686.99 - 1690.44] and so many have suffered terribly I
[1688.91 - 1691.77] mean it's it's devastating they lost
[1690.44 - 1693.78] their lives they lost
[1691.77 - 1695.13] likelihoods careers all these different
[1693.78 - 1696.51] things people suffer with and they're
[1695.13 - 1698.01] going through that now even when they
[1696.51 - 1699.54] don't get a Lyme disease diagnosis and
[1698.01 - 1700.86] you just got fatigued and you're broken
[1699.54 - 1703.92] down I've seen people lose their
[1700.86 - 1706.05] relationships I've seen I've seen so
[1703.92 - 1708.69] many women lose their relationships you
[1706.05 - 1710.70] know their fiance's and their you know
[1708.69 - 1712.74] their husbands and so much going on
[1710.70 - 1714.54] because cousins like well scratching
[1712.74 - 1716.97] their head wall wait a minute how did I
[1714.54 - 1718.83] did I buy into this this what is this
[1716.97 - 1719.37] hush modus thyroiditis cuz you know how
[1718.83 - 1721.20] guys are
[1719.37 - 1724.47] I mean heads are like what is this
[1721.20 - 1726.87] Hashimoto's thyroiditis what is this
[1724.47 - 1729.15] what are these symptoms come on get out
[1726.87 - 1730.80] of bed let's get moving what do you mean
[1729.15 - 1731.34] you're tired and you can't you can't
[1730.80 - 1734.55] function
[1731.34 - 1736.29] I've seen people literally in tears you
[1734.55 - 1737.55] know over the years crying to doctors
[1736.29 - 1739.92] that are friends of mine the doctors
[1737.55 - 1741.69] telling me about these stories and and
[1739.92 - 1743.52] I've heard it myself too over the years
[1741.69 - 1748.47] it's just unbelievable how it how it
[1743.52 - 1753.42] works so so uh so uh the bottom line is
[1748.47 - 1755.10] is Lyme disease is not what people think
[1753.42 - 1757.88] it is what's going to the another
[1755.10 - 1761.28] category here let's go let's talk
[1757.88 - 1762.30] everybody has at least one EBV who's
[1761.28 - 1765.48] sick
[1762.30 - 1768.42] anybody who's sick doesn't just have one
[1765.48 - 1770.79] variety it's easy to get two varieties
[1768.42 - 1772.11] it's easy to get more it all depends on
[1770.79 - 1774.21] what's happening in your life that's why
[1772.11 - 1775.95] you want arm yourself know the truth
[1774.21 - 1777.84] know how to he'll know what to do and
[1775.95 - 1781.11] and and what you need to do to heal it's
[1777.84 - 1782.25] so important so listen on this topic
[1781.11 - 1784.44] today and everything else we're gonna
[1782.25 - 1786.96] talk about the foods that get us in
[1784.44 - 1789.09] trouble what that means how that gets us
[1786.96 - 1790.95] in trouble what happens and I'm talking
[1789.09 - 1793.35] about the epstein-barr epstein-barr
[1790.95 - 1795.18] virus talking about this thyroid healing
[1793.35 - 1798.36] book the whole bit so we're going into
[1795.18 - 1800.97] it almost every person on the planet has
[1798.36 - 1804.00] one variety of epstein-barr one variety
[1800.97 - 1805.89] of epstein-barr it lives in the organs
[1804.00 - 1808.14] it lives in the liver in the organs
[1805.89 - 1810.03] going undetected by tests and
[1808.14 - 1811.62] undiagnosed from doctors for years this
[1810.03 - 1813.12] information I'm sharing with you is
[1811.62 - 1814.62] still unknown to medical research and
[1813.12 - 1815.07] science doctors do not know where to
[1814.62 - 1818.46] look
[1815.07 - 1821.25] for epstein-barr it's hard tests cannot
[1818.46 - 1822.71] detect EBV in the liver or organs
[1821.25 - 1824.87] there's no test
[1822.71 - 1827.33] can detect epstein-barr in your liver or
[1824.87 - 1830.57] organs that's how it works and they do
[1827.33 - 1832.58] have tests for at EBV but not in the
[1830.57 - 1836.39] liver and organs see doctors are looking
[1832.58 - 1837.68] for symptoms and linking it to EBV now
[1836.39 - 1839.54] because of the medical medium
[1837.68 - 1841.52] information they're looking for symptoms
[1839.54 - 1843.20] okay here's how it worked in the old
[1841.52 - 1844.85] biggest Epstein Barr because some of you
[1843.20 - 1847.10] might say well you didn't come up with
[1844.85 - 1849.28] the ethene bar diagnosis or to figure
[1847.10 - 1852.59] out like the Epstein bar no I didn't
[1849.28 - 1856.07] Anthony Epstein you know that doctor
[1852.59 - 1858.43] okay that genius found that virus okay
[1856.07 - 1860.96] he did but see that viruses only
[1858.43 - 1863.12] contributed to one thing back in the day
[1860.96 - 1865.58] called yuppies disease that's that's
[1863.12 - 1868.31] what it was contributed to malaise a
[1865.58 - 1870.29] little bit of fatigue a little bit of
[1868.31 - 1871.70] listlessness for a little bit in your
[1870.29 - 1874.49] life and that's it
[1871.70 - 1877.58] but it's that that's not what it causes
[1874.49 - 1881.54] it causes that times a hundred in
[1877.58 - 1883.70] everybody that's how it works so here's
[1881.54 - 1885.05] here's the thing doctors I've worked
[1883.70 - 1888.74] with over the decades
[1885.05 - 1891.53] I help them troubleshoot their cases so
[1888.74 - 1893.57] I spent years and years and years
[1891.53 - 1895.52] helping out doctors with their
[1893.57 - 1897.50] troubleshooting cases doctors have
[1895.52 - 1899.45] compassion and they want information no
[1897.50 - 1900.80] matter what because when they realized
[1899.45 - 1902.09] after they come out of medical school
[1900.80 - 1903.68] when I talk to doctors all the time
[1902.09 - 1905.33] about this and the information isn't
[1903.68 - 1906.95] there what they need why people are
[1905.33 - 1909.11] filing in with all these symptoms and
[1906.95 - 1911.24] conditions they want more and want more
[1909.11 - 1913.82] and a lot more because they got into the
[1911.24 - 1916.67] medical industry to get people better so
[1913.82 - 1919.37] fatigue and listlessness and malaise of
[1916.67 - 1921.98] the old days of Epstein Barr then that's
[1919.37 - 1923.78] not how it works Epstein Barr causes so
[1921.98 - 1925.46] much more look expand it be up see more
[1923.78 - 1927.17] information and thyroid healing in this
[1925.46 - 1929.69] book go to amazon.com or to go to the
[1927.17 - 1932.48] library and get it for free this is the
[1929.69 - 1935.39] Epstein Barr book of all time tyreq
[1932.48 - 1938.09] healing medical medium series now
[1935.39 - 1940.97] doctors around the world are using this
[1938.09 - 1942.77] book so right here this book is in their
[1940.97 - 1944.48] practice around the world and when
[1942.77 - 1946.49] people find a doctor that's using that
[1944.48 - 1948.65] book it's like a reprieve
[1946.49 - 1950.42] it's like what so my body is not
[1948.65 - 1951.67] destroying itself so if body's not
[1950.42 - 1953.95] destroying the thyroid
[1951.67 - 1955.03] actually can heal this is a virus and we
[1953.95 - 1957.88] could work on trying to get some
[1955.03 - 1960.28] antiviral protocols going and and
[1957.88 - 1962.14] something changes in the person they
[1960.28 - 1965.26] know they can heal so important to know
[1962.14 - 1967.26] so look let's let's talk about some
[1965.26 - 1970.24] other things why are there so many
[1967.26 - 1972.01] epstein-barr mutations how did this
[1970.24 - 1974.83] happen and how did these varieties of
[1972.01 - 1976.78] epstein-barr get into our bodies so so
[1974.83 - 1979.90] many people everybody has one variety
[1976.78 - 1983.61] okay around the world basically but many
[1979.90 - 1986.83] of us have two varieties three varieties
[1983.61 - 1988.36] epstein-barr was raised in labs long ago
[1986.83 - 1989.89] I'm gonna go into a big food thing
[1988.36 - 1991.45] pretty soon I got a whole bunch of foods
[1989.89 - 1992.68] here I'm gonna talk about what foods get
[1991.45 - 1995.14] us in trouble so you've got to stay on
[1992.68 - 1997.12] for that here's an egg that's a theme it
[1995.14 - 1999.04] gets us in trouble you see you saw some
[1997.12 - 2000.75] of you saw the why eggs make us sick if
[1999.04 - 2003.03] you haven't go back to that one after
[2000.75 - 2005.34] this one watch that YouTube learn learn
[2003.03 - 2007.41] how to heal so epstein-barr was raised
[2005.34 - 2010.05] in labs on chicken eggs that was one of
[2007.41 - 2012.03] the fuel sources so chicken eggs the
[2010.05 - 2013.32] hormones inside chicken eggs the natural
[2012.03 - 2015.75] occurring ones not talking about the
[2013.32 - 2018.30] agate ones that the industries do now
[2015.75 - 2020.34] you know free-range organic whatever the
[2018.30 - 2021.69] natural occurring hormone okay and the
[2020.34 - 2024.63] natural current proteins
[2021.69 - 2027.42] fed viruses raised in the labs that's
[2024.63 - 2030.42] what they did okay somehow these viruses
[2027.42 - 2032.34] escaped erasing labs and they escaped to
[2030.42 - 2034.89] the public so you know we could use your
[2032.34 - 2036.39] imagination on that many of you like to
[2034.89 - 2036.96] think where could how could that have
[2036.39 - 2039.45] happened
[2036.96 - 2042.45] but they did and it happened the
[2039.45 - 2045.30] original epstein-barr existed before
[2042.45 - 2047.28] this the old epstein-barr before the 16
[2045.30 - 2049.95] mutations the original epstein-barr
[2047.28 - 2052.14] existed well before this and that was so
[2049.95 - 2054.30] much it was so less aggressive it wasn't
[2052.14 - 2055.89] problematic you guys but since that new
[2054.30 - 2059.07] newer varieties that are severe and
[2055.89 - 2061.97] potent very strong powerful and
[2059.07 - 2065.19] neurotoxic have submerge or emerged
[2061.97 - 2066.45] these strains have mutated over the
[2065.19 - 2068.13] decades and now we're dealing with the
[2066.45 - 2070.11] over 60 varieties I just want to cover
[2068.13 - 2071.94] that really little deeper and they're
[2070.11 - 2074.13] going to continue to me you take and
[2071.94 - 2076.23] grow as the years move on why do you
[2074.13 - 2077.53] think we have so much chronic illness
[2076.23 - 2080.27] around the war
[2077.53 - 2080.99] literally out of pace no one's ever seen
[2080.27 - 2082.88] before
[2080.99 - 2085.22] when I talk to doctors did like they're
[2082.88 - 2087.11] like even with all of the health minded
[2085.22 - 2089.06] information and no gluten and then this
[2087.11 - 2090.83] and the bad and all the supplements out
[2089.06 - 2093.38] there and those stores shelves pack of
[2090.83 - 2097.58] supplements it's rising like never
[2093.38 - 2099.59] before and so because the viruses are
[2097.58 - 2101.42] tough they're tough to deal with and
[2099.59 - 2102.58] they're passing from person to person so
[2101.42 - 2105.38] let's talk about how that stuff
[2102.58 - 2107.48] relationships body fluids that's how you
[2105.38 - 2109.58] be these passed around a lot that's a
[2107.48 - 2111.26] big one so I'm just saying so you know
[2109.58 - 2112.67] you wanna you want to be careful along
[2111.26 - 2114.80] the way is you're meeting people and
[2112.67 - 2117.05] everything else because body bodily
[2114.80 - 2119.06] fluids that can happen and and okay if
[2117.05 - 2120.41] it happens and it happens and you get a
[2119.06 - 2121.82] beat in the epstein-barr and they're
[2120.41 - 2123.35] sick two years later or three years
[2121.82 - 2124.79] later you work on healing it and you
[2123.35 - 2126.23] work on healing it you get getting rid
[2124.79 - 2128.21] of it and moving forward with your life
[2126.23 - 2130.34] bottom line restaurants is a big place
[2128.21 - 2132.65] to restaurants now I'm not trying to rip
[2130.34 - 2135.65] down restaurants you know the industry's
[2132.65 - 2136.97] a you know it's a it's industry you know
[2135.65 - 2139.70] the sort of food and make people happy
[2136.97 - 2141.50] so and a lot of people have the heart
[2139.70 - 2144.35] soul in the restaurants but restaurants
[2141.50 - 2146.03] are also place its Forks utensils that
[2144.35 - 2147.26] aren't washed or sterilized properly
[2146.03 - 2148.97] it's shrinking glasses that aren't
[2147.26 - 2151.76] washed or sterilized properly if you got
[2148.97 - 2153.95] lipstick on a glass it wasn't wiped off
[2151.76 - 2156.35] completely and that and it's still there
[2153.95 - 2158.03] it can contain and hold the epstein-barr
[2156.35 - 2159.68] virus within the lipstick so if you've
[2158.03 - 2161.48] got a coffee cup and you got old some
[2159.68 - 2163.94] old lipstick on it that didn't kind of
[2161.48 - 2166.40] scrub off you know in that diner or
[2163.94 - 2168.26] somewhere or that place that holding
[2166.40 - 2171.38] contains an Epstein bar virus very
[2168.26 - 2172.94] easily this is how across I'm not trying
[2171.38 - 2174.17] to make you phobic about it I'm not
[2172.94 - 2176.39] trying to make you feel like you can't
[2174.17 - 2179.03] ever eat out it's not it I'm just
[2176.39 - 2181.25] letting you know it's easy to get the up
[2179.03 - 2183.16] steam barbwire sharing plates of foods
[2181.25 - 2185.54] to you know sharing plates of food
[2183.16 - 2187.31] drinking down to somebody's clacks and
[2185.54 - 2190.19] everything you know it's with a friend
[2187.31 - 2192.02] and I was out in a restaurant and I
[2190.19 - 2195.68] didn't finish I didn't finish my the
[2192.02 - 2197.30] food I had in my plate and and and and
[2195.68 - 2198.53] you know that with a few friends when
[2197.30 - 2199.73] the friends grabbed my plate you know
[2198.53 - 2201.14] we're really hungry and I go what are
[2199.73 - 2203.54] you doing then they're just finishing it
[2201.14 - 2205.19] off and what are you doing and they go
[2203.54 - 2207.29] well with you I'm not worrying about it
[2205.19 - 2211.04] maybe with you I'm not worried about it
[2207.29 - 2213.11] but it's easy to actually get something
[2211.04 - 2215.54] passed you know from one person to
[2213.11 - 2217.34] another because that's how it's done
[2215.54 - 2219.44] bodily fluids that's how the bug gets
[2217.34 - 2221.45] around public bathrooms that's another
[2219.44 - 2223.22] way this is important information it all
[2221.45 - 2226.04] sounds innocent but the door handles on
[2223.22 - 2228.83] public bathrooms you know I mean put
[2226.04 - 2230.48] paper on the seat whatever you do I use
[2228.83 - 2232.58] you should ship with paper on the seat
[2230.48 - 2234.29] you know that's one thing here's a tip
[2232.58 - 2236.66] in the public bathrooms to try not to
[2234.29 - 2238.73] get things as you you know always have
[2236.66 - 2240.11] some handy wipes in public bathrooms you
[2238.73 - 2242.06] know washing your hands at the sink
[2240.11 - 2243.68] everybody else does just kind of like
[2242.06 - 2244.73] everybody else just went to the bathroom
[2243.68 - 2246.80] now they're at the same touching
[2244.73 - 2248.27] everything well you know what I like to
[2246.80 - 2249.97] do is keep some handy wipes on me I
[2248.27 - 2252.53] think that's actually a better option
[2249.97 - 2254.12] but the other thing too with the public
[2252.53 - 2256.70] bathroom thing that's one way that's
[2254.12 - 2259.13] really popular with with transmitting
[2256.70 - 2261.59] with actually getting the epstein-barr
[2259.13 - 2263.45] virus is you want you in a public
[2261.59 - 2265.43] bathroom flush the toilet before you
[2263.45 - 2267.02] even start going to bathroom even if it
[2265.43 - 2269.12] looks like it was flushed before
[2267.02 - 2270.86] just give it a flush so whatever could
[2269.12 - 2273.11] gremlin says could go in there and hold
[2270.86 - 2274.79] it and throw some paper on the seat yeah
[2273.11 - 2277.16] it sounds silly to a lot of you a lot of
[2274.79 - 2280.31] you don't care like I get it and I have
[2277.16 - 2280.67] respect for you 100% but that's what I
[2280.31 - 2282.83] do
[2280.67 - 2284.36] ok that's what the medical medium does
[2282.83 - 2287.48] and he does it for a reason a good
[2284.36 - 2289.46] reason so let's go into the four stages
[2287.48 - 2291.65] of epstein-barr and we're almost to the
[2289.46 - 2293.48] food part two no it's gonna be fun let's
[2291.65 - 2295.43] go to four stages epstein-barr I've seen
[2293.48 - 2298.01] bars four stages researches Sciences
[2295.43 - 2299.87] unaware of it completely doctors are
[2298.01 - 2301.49] aware of it now because of the medical
[2299.87 - 2303.20] medium information you know if I were
[2301.49 - 2305.36] healing book make sure you get it go to
[2303.20 - 2307.22] amazon.com make sure you have that book
[2305.36 - 2311.21] I can't I can't cover a fraction of that
[2307.22 - 2313.01] book it's not even possible so stage one
[2311.21 - 2315.65] the early stage you get up scene bar and
[2313.01 - 2317.42] it incubates it sits in you that's one
[2315.65 - 2319.58] of the stages you can get it passed down
[2317.42 - 2321.05] from parents you can get your Epstein
[2319.58 - 2323.45] bar passed down from parents you can get
[2321.05 - 2326.54] it from other family members too you can
[2323.45 - 2328.40] get it from other family members and so
[2326.54 - 2329.84] it's important to know that meaning just
[2328.40 - 2332.12] living in the house so you've got
[2329.84 - 2334.02] brothers and sisters and you know and
[2332.12 - 2335.49] they get it somewhere out there and
[2334.02 - 2337.29] they bring it back and everybody's
[2335.49 - 2339.84] sharing food and sharing this and
[2337.29 - 2341.82] sharing that and absolutely so it's easy
[2339.84 - 2345.06] to it's so easy to get different
[2341.82 - 2347.40] projects but the early stage it can but
[2345.06 - 2349.14] what happens is it sits in the bodies
[2347.40 - 2350.76] person isn't it sits in the bloodstream
[2349.14 - 2353.25] sorry about that sits in the bloodstream
[2350.76 - 2355.26] and it lays dormant so that's what it
[2353.25 - 2356.58] does that's the first stage you get you
[2355.26 - 2357.96] pick it up somewhere you get it in
[2356.58 - 2360.63] bodily fluids you get it at a restaurant
[2357.96 - 2362.16] and get in a relationship and now it's
[2360.63 - 2363.69] sitting in there incubating that's what
[2362.16 - 2365.34] it does but things going to happen in
[2363.69 - 2367.23] life you can be under a lot of stress
[2365.34 - 2369.84] you can go through a lot you can you can
[2367.23 - 2372.12] be you can go through something in your
[2369.84 - 2374.79] life it's very difficult that causes
[2372.12 - 2376.29] your immune system to weaken so it could
[2374.79 - 2377.73] be a loss it could be a betrayal it
[2376.29 - 2379.08] could be trust breakage it could be
[2377.73 - 2380.52] somebody stabbing you in the back it
[2379.08 - 2382.62] could be a relationship that went wrong
[2380.52 - 2384.99] it could be somebody broke up with you
[2382.62 - 2386.94] it could be maybe you're just a
[2384.99 - 2388.86] miserable person because you're just to
[2386.94 - 2391.05] your beer you just you're just been
[2388.86 - 2393.36] through so much so much whatever it is
[2391.05 - 2395.67] that's going on and and you've had a
[2393.36 - 2397.74] hard time and you've had a hard life or
[2395.67 - 2400.53] whatever the hardship is even if it's
[2397.74 - 2403.11] not that hard to one person but it's if
[2400.53 - 2406.71] it could be hard to you it could be a
[2403.11 - 2407.82] big deal to you and you know people go
[2406.71 - 2410.25] through so many different things and
[2407.82 - 2411.96] they take things to heart and personal
[2410.25 - 2414.51] ways that another person might not have
[2411.96 - 2416.19] and that's everybody's right to feel and
[2414.51 - 2419.04] have their emotions and all that but
[2416.19 - 2421.17] heartbreak and betrayal all of that is
[2419.04 - 2423.66] painful can weaken the immune system so
[2421.17 - 2425.31] if you have that incubating epstein-barr
[2423.66 - 2426.81] that you caught somewhere and it's just
[2425.31 - 2429.09] been sitting in your system for a year
[2426.81 - 2430.83] or two years three years five months a
[2429.09 - 2432.48] month and then you go through some
[2430.83 - 2434.19] adrenal stress you go through some
[2432.48 - 2435.87] fight-or-flight you get some heartbreak
[2434.19 - 2438.21] you get some betrayal your immune system
[2435.87 - 2442.71] drops down a little bit it looks for
[2438.21 - 2444.27] this and then there's the poor diet the
[2442.71 - 2445.92] poor night we're going into that right
[2444.27 - 2449.31] now let's talk about foods and the whole
[2445.92 - 2453.00] bit a little bit why someone can eat
[2449.31 - 2456.41] gluten or dairy or corn and not have a
[2453.00 - 2459.99] problem and be fine when someone else
[2456.41 - 2461.88] can eat that and get really sick or it
[2459.99 - 2463.01] makes them sicker over time whether they
[2461.88 - 2464.54] know it or not what
[2463.01 - 2468.50] symptoms and conditions so let's go into
[2464.54 - 2470.24] foods and food talk hope everybody is
[2468.50 - 2473.84] doing good I got my celery juice right
[2470.24 - 2475.61] here heading into a new part of this the
[2473.84 - 2477.65] next part of this I see a lot of
[2475.61 - 2480.59] comments and I really appreciate that
[2477.65 - 2484.16] because all that's good so start with
[2480.59 - 2487.52] right here so I got some milk right here
[2484.16 - 2489.20] all right now they're all good companies
[2487.52 - 2490.46] every every company I'm showing right
[2489.20 - 2491.75] here it's all good companies but it's
[2490.46 - 2494.78] not about that so I'm just covering
[2491.75 - 2498.02] labels and you know I'm not ripping down
[2494.78 - 2499.79] any brands or anything of course I'm
[2498.02 - 2501.44] supportive of everybody trying to
[2499.79 - 2503.75] survive out there in the world but milk
[2501.44 - 2505.70] milk is actually a problem just so you
[2503.75 - 2509.39] know so I'm gonna let you know milk
[2505.70 - 2510.89] feeds the epstein-barr virus it does and
[2509.39 - 2513.14] what happens is people think lactose
[2510.89 - 2515.00] intolerance they think wait a minute you
[2513.14 - 2516.59] know lactose intolerance is my problem
[2515.00 - 2518.69] that's why I can't drink milk that's why
[2516.59 - 2520.70] I have to stay away from milk but that's
[2518.69 - 2522.56] fear so lactose intolerance is it
[2520.70 - 2524.36] actually is an actual theory just so you
[2522.56 - 2527.21] know what's really happening is the
[2524.36 - 2530.96] epstein-barr virus feeds off of lactose
[2527.21 - 2533.66] it feeds off of proteins in milk it
[2530.96 - 2535.37] feeds off of sugars and no so it's
[2533.66 - 2537.83] really important to know there's also
[2535.37 - 2539.84] natural occurring hormones in organic
[2537.83 - 2542.90] milk and really good milk high-quality
[2539.84 - 2545.12] pasture-raised and so forth and if
[2542.90 - 2547.04] somebody's heart is in creating the best
[2545.12 - 2549.47] milk out there or the best product that
[2547.04 - 2551.18] I'm gonna show I support them in that
[2549.47 - 2553.22] sense because their hearts in it they're
[2551.18 - 2554.81] creating good stuff but I'm talking
[2553.22 - 2556.49] about sickness and the epstein-barr
[2554.81 - 2558.50] virus I'm talking about happens when you
[2556.49 - 2559.94] have the virus in you it's incubating
[2558.50 - 2563.15] it's sitting in you and what happens
[2559.94 - 2565.40] okay so when you're drinking milk see
[2563.15 - 2567.02] none of the other diet systems that say
[2565.40 - 2569.15] stay away from milk if there's one that
[2567.02 - 2571.43] says stay away from milk knows why
[2569.15 - 2573.59] people get sick and they're just playing
[2571.43 - 2576.26] guessing games that's not what this is
[2573.59 - 2578.21] I'm gonna teach you how you get sick
[2576.26 - 2579.65] when you're drinking these things or
[2578.21 - 2580.97] when you're eating certain foods so
[2579.65 - 2583.25] you're really empowered so you have the
[2580.97 - 2585.62] original information a source that
[2583.25 - 2588.38] started basically this kind of stuff
[2585.62 - 2590.89] going back 35 plus years ago so it's so
[2588.38 - 2593.72] important no bugs love to feed off of
[2590.89 - 2596.60] lactose protein and next
[2593.72 - 2600.17] hormones occurring hormones in milk so
[2596.60 - 2601.64] and milk will you'll see you'll hear out
[2600.17 - 2603.08] there all with mucus forming you'll hear
[2601.64 - 2604.34] from the different diet belief systems
[2603.08 - 2606.71] out there well I'll commute this forming
[2604.34 - 2608.57] stay away why is it mucus forming nobody
[2606.71 - 2610.01] knows why it's mucus forming they just
[2608.57 - 2611.36] say stay away from Dairy it's mucus
[2610.01 - 2612.47] forming you'll hear that all the time
[2611.36 - 2614.72] and all the different diet belief
[2612.47 - 2618.17] systems and all that but what they don't
[2614.72 - 2621.17] know is it's mucus forming because it's
[2618.17 - 2623.93] feeding viruses and pathogens of all
[2621.17 - 2624.89] kinds that's what happens with this kind
[2623.93 - 2626.99] of thing when you're doing their
[2624.89 - 2629.12] products you're feeding something when
[2626.99 - 2631.49] you feed something it creates mucus this
[2629.12 - 2633.86] is why so many people can drink milk and
[2631.49 - 2636.86] eat cheese and eat other things and not
[2633.86 - 2639.20] have mucus it's also why people can also
[2636.86 - 2640.85] eat gluten they can take a nude stereo
[2639.20 - 2643.85] they can do whatever they want and they
[2640.85 - 2645.98] don't get sick and they seem okay
[2643.85 - 2648.38] someone else drinks some dairy they're
[2645.98 - 2651.32] in the bathroom because above fed off of
[2648.38 - 2652.76] the lactose released it created
[2651.32 - 2654.62] inflammation and now you're sitting in
[2652.76 - 2657.62] the bathroom with IBS because of a
[2654.62 - 2659.39] pathogen not because of a food because
[2657.62 - 2662.39] of a pathogen this is why somebody else
[2659.39 - 2663.86] can eat the food and not have that see
[2662.39 - 2666.32] how important it is to know these things
[2663.86 - 2668.36] the power of that can do me for you in a
[2666.32 - 2669.95] lot of different ways it's not that you
[2668.36 - 2672.29] have a faulty body it's not that you
[2669.95 - 2674.15] have an enzyme theory there's a theory
[2672.29 - 2676.16] that an enzyme you don't have to in
[2674.15 - 2678.35] order to actually have dairy products
[2676.16 - 2679.88] that's a theory because they don't know
[2678.35 - 2681.23] what causes illness still science
[2679.88 - 2683.03] research has no idea and science
[2681.23 - 2684.77] research knows nothing about food they
[2683.03 - 2686.39] don't know nothing about food when you
[2684.77 - 2687.68] drink it or consuming or eat it and it
[2686.39 - 2690.86] enters in the stomach you think there's
[2687.68 - 2692.84] an actual test or a machine that can
[2690.86 - 2694.61] determine when you eat something what's
[2692.84 - 2696.14] happening is scrambling through the body
[2694.61 - 2697.88] and the body is breaking it apart or
[2696.14 - 2699.95] what's going on they don't have anything
[2697.88 - 2701.63] in science at all there's nothing they
[2699.95 - 2705.59] have they just have theory and guesses
[2701.63 - 2707.48] and so it's so important to know this so
[2705.59 - 2709.01] when it comes down to it that's the no
[2707.48 - 2711.05] when it comes down to and then we got
[2709.01 - 2713.93] some cheese right here okay
[2711.05 - 2716.03] same thing with cheese now remember
[2713.93 - 2718.13] there's also fat in milk and there's
[2716.03 - 2721.55] also fat and cheese there's fat in dairy
[2718.13 - 2723.36] what the fat does is if it strengthens
[2721.55 - 2725.43] the virus more so it strengthens
[2723.36 - 2727.29] hodgins more strengthens epstein-barr
[2725.43 - 2729.48] more so when you're eating the cheese
[2727.29 - 2731.70] you're putting all that fat inside of
[2729.48 - 2733.68] you when you're when your blood gets
[2731.70 - 2735.51] filled with too much fat inside and I've
[2733.68 - 2738.96] been saying this for decades and decades
[2735.51 - 2741.12] when it's when it's when when your blood
[2738.96 - 2743.52] gets so filled with fat your oxygen
[2741.12 - 2746.07] levels drop what do you need to stop
[2743.52 - 2748.76] epstein-barr not just your immune system
[2746.07 - 2751.38] but you need oxygen in your bloodstream
[2748.76 - 2754.32] the higher fat content in your
[2751.38 - 2756.78] bloodstream pushes out and basically
[2754.32 - 2759.48] hampers down oxygen levels inside the
[2756.78 - 2762.93] bloodstream so those oxygen levels are
[2759.48 - 2766.56] how we fight and battle epstein-barr is
[2762.93 - 2769.26] how it works so you know the bottom line
[2766.56 - 2771.42] is when you have epstein-barr incubating
[2769.26 - 2773.91] in you getting ready to fire up and
[2771.42 - 2775.86] start and you're you're eliminating your
[2773.91 - 2777.90] oxygen levels because you're bombarding
[2775.86 - 2779.46] your liver with all this fat intake you
[2777.90 - 2780.81] got the dairy products even if it's good
[2779.46 - 2783.15] dairy even if you're having it once a
[2780.81 - 2784.80] week it's still like it still can get
[2783.15 - 2786.24] you in trouble you'd if you're drinking
[2784.80 - 2788.22] milk and just your coffee or whatever
[2786.24 - 2790.02] you're doing you know it still can get
[2788.22 - 2791.55] you in trouble but these are the things
[2790.02 - 2793.35] these high-fat dairy products or even
[2791.55 - 2794.88] low fat dairy products still can feed
[2793.35 - 2797.76] the epstein-barr from what they have in
[2794.88 - 2799.32] it so here's an example right here some
[2797.76 - 2801.12] feta cheese that's another cheese -
[2799.32 - 2802.80] because some people say why you'd feta
[2801.12 - 2804.99] cheese that's much better it's it's
[2802.80 - 2807.15] lighter I can have it on my salad I can
[2804.99 - 2809.31] have it still feed epstein-barr virus
[2807.15 - 2811.29] and it'll still go off after the
[2809.31 - 2813.12] hormones and the best energy is possible
[2811.29 - 2816.72] and the best cheddar cheese and the best
[2813.12 - 2820.56] Swiss cheese and so forth so you have to
[2816.72 - 2822.84] know that this is why we get sick from
[2820.56 - 2824.16] foods this is why we don't do good with
[2822.84 - 2826.08] food so you be somebody that does great
[2824.16 - 2827.52] with these foods for a little while and
[2826.08 - 2829.35] all of a sudden start getting act and
[2827.52 - 2830.88] you're like what's going on and you
[2829.35 - 2833.79] start getting acne you start getting
[2830.88 - 2835.35] something else they'll feed any pathogen
[2833.79 - 2837.57] like a please caused by streptococcus
[2835.35 - 2840.24] it's caused by that bacteria but this
[2837.57 - 2842.10] will feed any pathogen everybody so you
[2840.24 - 2845.97] need to know that and that's how it
[2842.10 - 2847.74] works so I'm going to show you some more
[2845.97 - 2850.35] foods too in a second so I just want to
[2847.74 - 2852.60] cover that a little bit so when you're
[2850.35 - 2853.91] eating cheese you're actually there's
[2852.60 - 2855.56] hormones in that cheese
[2853.91 - 2857.51] naturally occurring even if it's
[2855.56 - 2858.89] free-range organic sino so many of
[2857.51 - 2860.39] you're like well what if it's work in it
[2858.89 - 2862.61] what if it's pasture-raised what if it's
[2860.39 - 2865.04] that I'm letting you know the natural
[2862.61 - 2868.97] occurring hormones and the proteins okay
[2865.04 - 2871.49] and let the sugar lactose is going to
[2868.97 - 2873.71] feed any pathogen possible so whatever
[2871.49 - 2875.27] you got incubating in you if you have
[2873.71 - 2877.61] strep sitting in you from when you had
[2875.27 - 2880.19] strep throat as a child if you have an
[2877.61 - 2881.81] Epstein bar incubating or an Epstein bar
[2880.19 - 2883.40] that's not incubating that thing's been
[2881.81 - 2885.20] causing you pain and suffering or
[2883.40 - 2887.66] symptoms and conditions or anxiety and
[2885.20 - 2891.38] and fibromyalgia aches and pains and
[2887.66 - 2893.60] fatigue and and and foggy head and brain
[2891.38 - 2896.39] fog and all that if you have all that
[2893.60 - 2898.37] going on absolutely you got to get rid
[2896.39 - 2899.78] of these foods this is why foods will
[2898.37 - 2901.28] get you in trouble but you're not gonna
[2899.78 - 2903.80] hear anywhere else or from any other
[2901.28 - 2905.15] source of why they get you in trouble
[2903.80 - 2906.77] besides the theories maybe you're
[2905.15 - 2910.04] lactose intolerant well that's a great
[2906.77 - 2911.12] guessing game okay you know I mean there
[2910.04 - 2912.89] may have in a way that they don't even
[2911.12 - 2915.26] have a way to tell it's impossible
[2912.89 - 2917.57] literally and so that's how we're so we
[2915.26 - 2919.88] walk around without knowing that we
[2917.57 - 2921.71] actually are viral and we actually are
[2919.88 - 2923.03] getting sicker as the years come on and
[2921.71 - 2924.80] look if you're indestructible and you're
[2923.03 - 2926.06] in that age right now each bracket and
[2924.80 - 2928.25] you feel like yet nothing's really
[2926.06 - 2930.38] happening to unique and that you can
[2928.25 - 2931.73] just get in a gym and exercise and this
[2930.38 - 2933.86] stuff's crazy I'm staying away from
[2931.73 - 2936.56] gluten I'm staying with this anyway I'm
[2933.86 - 2938.51] all fine but if you think but you're not
[2936.56 - 2941.72] if you're untouchable you're wrong
[2938.51 - 2943.97] because every single person is getting a
[2941.72 - 2946.55] symptom no matter what along the way at
[2943.97 - 2948.74] some time in their life or symptoms or
[2946.55 - 2950.87] sickness or disease it's just the way
[2948.74 - 2952.88] it's heading there's no way around it
[2950.87 - 2955.16] unless you know what to do power
[2952.88 - 2956.63] yourself heal the whole day get this
[2955.16 - 2958.40] from the library for free go to
[2956.63 - 2961.85] amazon.com and get a copy it's not
[2958.40 - 2962.45] expensive um so so important so here's
[2961.85 - 2964.34] how it works
[2962.45 - 2965.81] bugs feed off of these things and you
[2964.34 - 2967.52] know here's a book here's butter right
[2965.81 - 2969.61] here okay so I've got some butter high
[2967.52 - 2972.05] quality butter alright so I'm not
[2969.61 - 2976.93] shaming the companies that make this
[2972.05 - 2979.72] food but all dairy these bugs and paths
[2976.93 - 2981.85] yes and dairy puts that high fat and
[2979.72 - 2982.75] burns liver and beats it down so path
[2981.85 - 2985.30] that's a passion
[2982.75 - 2986.89] pathogens can thrive like epstein-barr
[2985.30 - 2988.66] inside the liver and if you have more
[2986.89 - 2990.01] than one epstein-barr virus if you have
[2988.66 - 2991.42] more than one variety to sitting inside
[2990.01 - 2993.91] the liver that's sitting there eating
[2991.42 - 2996.31] and thriving all of those dairy products
[2993.91 - 2998.14] over time you're gonna get the hot
[2996.31 - 2999.67] flashes or heart palpitations you're
[2998.14 - 3001.38] gonna get the sluggish liver you're
[2999.67 - 3002.61] gonna get the waking down the road down
[3001.38 - 3005.19] to yours you can get all these different
[3002.61 - 3007.05] things the liver can't help us when it's
[3005.19 - 3008.82] over burdened with too much fat and it's
[3007.05 - 3010.20] loaded up with poisons because the liver
[3008.82 - 3012.75] is the garbage dump
[3010.20 - 3014.61] and so when you're got pathogens when
[3012.75 - 3015.93] you got sickness when you have all these
[3014.61 - 3017.49] different symptoms you've got a couple
[3015.93 - 3019.77] of different viruses inside the liver
[3017.49 - 3021.27] creating your fibromyalgia lupus your
[3019.77 - 3023.46] your eczema or psoriasis all these
[3021.27 - 3025.92] different conditions your anxiety your
[3023.46 - 3028.92] thyroid disorders all of it then you
[3025.92 - 3032.13] can't detox you can't cleanse and you
[3028.92 - 3034.44] can't detox now it's so important to
[3032.13 - 3036.36] know you listen it's like the lemon
[3034.44 - 3039.39] water thing right you've heard a lemon
[3036.36 - 3041.88] water by now okay see you know medical
[3039.39 - 3043.77] medium information did not create a
[3041.88 - 3045.62] lemon water people have been putting
[3043.77 - 3047.70] lemon in their water for centuries
[3045.62 - 3049.77] they've been putting lemon in their
[3047.70 - 3051.69] water for centuries that said they're
[3049.77 - 3053.85] putting lemon in their tea but the
[3051.69 - 3056.49] information that I did bring to
[3053.85 - 3059.01] everybody through my source okay was
[3056.49 - 3062.52] that when you use lemon water in the
[3059.01 - 3064.14] morning if flushes the liver that comes
[3062.52 - 3066.09] from medical medium information that's
[3064.14 - 3068.70] the original source and it's been out
[3066.09 - 3070.65] there for years now and so there's a
[3068.70 - 3072.93] reason why you want to flush your liver
[3070.65 - 3075.36] with lemon you want to squeeze lemon in
[3072.93 - 3075.78] water and drink it there's a reason for
[3075.36 - 3078.81] that
[3075.78 - 3080.76] because it flushes the liver it flushes
[3078.81 - 3082.05] out the poisons in the morning and
[3080.76 - 3083.67] that's the original medical medium
[3082.05 - 3085.41] information so if you ever heard that
[3083.67 - 3087.63] and everybody's been squeezing lemon to
[3085.41 - 3089.22] flush out their liver or flush out their
[3087.63 - 3091.20] toxins that comes from medical medium
[3089.22 - 3092.61] information and I noticed it's gone
[3091.20 - 3092.97] around the world doctors tell me all the
[3092.61 - 3094.80] time
[3092.97 - 3096.60] thank God you told me that 15-20 years
[3094.80 - 3098.55] ago thank God you put it in all your
[3096.60 - 3100.35] books because it's really helping a lot
[3098.55 - 3101.73] of my patients I hear that all the time
[3100.35 - 3103.26] and if somebody might say well hey you
[3101.73 - 3105.24] didn't start lemon water no of course
[3103.26 - 3105.77] not people are put in lemon lemon in
[3105.24 - 3107.96] water
[3105.77 - 3111.08] or lemon in their teeth long before I
[3107.96 - 3112.46] existed and long before you existed but
[3111.08 - 3114.20] that wasn't to flush out the liver
[3112.46 - 3115.67] nobody knew about that parts and now
[3114.20 - 3117.29] people are doing their large lemon
[3115.67 - 3119.12] waters in the morning I'm so glad you
[3117.29 - 3120.68] guys are doing it too because if you're
[3119.12 - 3123.29] on the high-fat diets and you're putting
[3120.68 - 3124.85] like this should not be consumed in your
[3123.29 - 3126.77] diet if you got symptoms conditions
[3124.85 - 3129.23] issues happening if you got acne
[3126.77 - 3131.21] whatever it is bugs will feed on but
[3129.23 - 3133.19] natural occurring hormones in here bugs
[3131.21 - 3135.23] will feed on the sugars in here bugs
[3133.19 - 3137.12] bugs will actually grow because of the
[3135.23 - 3139.10] amount of fat in here that's naturally
[3137.12 - 3140.30] occurring so it's really important to
[3139.10 - 3142.70] know these things so that's the butter
[3140.30 - 3144.47] butter we'll get in trouble butter
[3142.70 - 3146.39] doesn't make you strong butter doesn't
[3144.47 - 3149.00] make you indestructible butter just
[3146.39 - 3150.92] feeds viruses along the way so you get
[3149.00 - 3153.68] your Lyme disease diagnosis winter 52
[3150.92 - 3155.53] years old or you get your Hashimoto's
[3153.68 - 3158.33] thyroid affect you know thyroiditis
[3155.53 - 3160.22] diagnosis when you're 32 or you get some
[3158.33 - 3161.42] symptoms or you get more acting along
[3160.22 - 3162.77] the way and you're going to doctor the
[3161.42 - 3163.94] doctor and you still don't know why and
[3162.77 - 3165.44] you get off of lutein and you get off a
[3163.94 - 3166.76] couple of foods and your acne starts
[3165.44 - 3168.26] getting a little bit better but then it
[3166.76 - 3170.69] comes back again and then they say well
[3168.26 - 3172.16] it's your hormones and so it's so
[3170.69 - 3173.81] important to know what foods to stay
[3172.16 - 3177.44] away from let's cover more foods this is
[3173.81 - 3180.83] fun so we've got some kefir right here
[3177.44 - 3182.63] so it's keeper all right now people say
[3180.83 - 3184.28] what about kefir Kieffer's good for me
[3182.63 - 3186.53] Kieffer's got the probiotics in it the
[3184.28 - 3187.85] whole bit kefir what the kefir is going
[3186.53 - 3190.19] to do it's going to do a lot more harm
[3187.85 - 3192.59] for you then it's going to do good for
[3190.19 - 3194.48] you critical to understand okay because
[3192.59 - 3197.30] it's still gonna feed any virus or
[3194.48 - 3200.84] pathogen in your body and yes it's
[3197.30 - 3203.33] better than milk in a way but it's still
[3200.84 - 3205.40] going to get you sit down the road
[3203.33 - 3207.23] that's how it works so there's the kefir
[3205.40 - 3208.73] that's something to know so I showed you
[3207.23 - 3210.23] the milk I've got some more foods on the
[3208.73 - 3214.37] way to that I'm gonna show you that are
[3210.23 - 3216.65] really important so sour cream - another
[3214.37 - 3219.02] one - so many people do sour cream
[3216.65 - 3222.38] that's one right there you know there's
[3219.02 - 3224.33] a sour cream people say well that's
[3222.38 - 3225.74] different you know you can do that it's
[3224.33 - 3228.38] a different kind of Derrick and do a
[3225.74 - 3229.05] little lump of sour cream and and that's
[3228.38 - 3230.91] you know but
[3229.05 - 3232.56] gets you in trouble too it feeds it
[3230.91 - 3234.09] feeds all the bugs and everything like
[3232.56 - 3239.31] that so let's talk about some other
[3234.09 - 3241.10] stuff so let's talk about this smells
[3239.31 - 3243.81] good though
[3241.10 - 3246.36] you know it's a bad guy right who
[3243.81 - 3249.51] doesn't like a bad guy it's pretty fresh
[3246.36 - 3252.12] too so alright so the whole thing with
[3249.51 - 3255.33] wheat gluten so everybody knows hey you
[3252.12 - 3256.98] know we wheat gluten celiac problems
[3255.33 - 3260.13] people have people have allergies to
[3256.98 - 3265.23] gluten the protein so we know all about
[3260.13 - 3267.66] that but what no one knows is that why
[3265.23 - 3269.91] does everybody suffer when they have
[3267.66 - 3272.34] gluten not everybody but a lot of people
[3269.91 - 3273.96] do whether they know it or not and when
[3272.34 - 3275.43] they remove it they realize it was the
[3273.96 - 3277.92] gluten that's what I mean because a lot
[3275.43 - 3281.01] of people don't know it how come because
[3277.92 - 3283.32] gluten feeds pathogens see that
[3281.01 - 3286.23] information wasn't out there until the
[3283.32 - 3288.35] medical meeting information now doctors
[3286.23 - 3290.46] are actually putting it out there now
[3288.35 - 3293.31] recently there's been some doctors that
[3290.46 - 3294.57] they have books out there I have a
[3293.31 - 3296.46] feeling they don't like the fact that
[3294.57 - 3298.92] you know millions of medical media books
[3296.46 - 3301.08] have gotten all around the world and in
[3298.92 - 3303.15] doctors offices I think it does hurt
[3301.08 - 3303.93] because look everybody knows I'm not a
[3303.15 - 3306.27] doctor
[3303.93 - 3308.10] everybody knows that and I've never said
[3306.27 - 3310.11] it was a doctor but it does it does hurt
[3308.10 - 3313.80] I think the ego and a lot of people and
[3310.11 - 3316.20] so and they they know the information is
[3313.80 - 3318.27] solid and so they end up start saying
[3316.20 - 3319.83] well no no I knew I knew about you know
[3318.27 - 3322.29] pathogens feeding off of gluten oh yeah
[3319.83 - 3324.42] well no one knew and it never existed
[3322.29 - 3327.33] before the medical medium information
[3324.42 - 3330.45] and so you need to know that gluten
[3327.33 - 3332.91] feeds epstein-barr bars but it feeds all
[3330.45 - 3335.49] pathogens and that's where the problem
[3332.91 - 3337.53] lies why do you think you can be 80
[3335.49 - 3339.48] years old and eat all the gluten you
[3337.53 - 3342.06] want and never have a problem you know
[3339.48 - 3343.77] how many grandparents that can eat all
[3342.06 - 3345.72] the gluten they want and they don't
[3343.77 - 3347.91] understand why their 16-year old
[3345.72 - 3350.04] granddaughter can't have gluten
[3347.91 - 3351.57] because the 60-year old granddaughter is
[3350.04 - 3353.34] dealing with different varieties of
[3351.57 - 3355.65] strep which I'm going to talk about a
[3353.34 - 3357.90] streptococcus or they're dealing with an
[3355.65 - 3359.06] Epstein bar and or they're dealing with
[3357.90 - 3361.52] some some others have
[3359.06 - 3364.64] pathogen that the grandparents don't
[3361.52 - 3366.22] have or didn't add it's the same thing
[3364.64 - 3369.50] it's like why do you think young people
[3366.22 - 3372.23] can't eat gluten but yes unless so many
[3369.50 - 3374.18] older people can because the change of
[3372.23 - 3376.49] the times the different varieties of
[3374.18 - 3378.20] viruses the times are changing the
[3376.49 - 3380.42] mutations the fact that they're getting
[3378.20 - 3382.73] everywhere now the fact that the older
[3380.42 - 3385.61] generation had the older older varieties
[3382.73 - 3387.05] and many of them had no varieties it's
[3385.61 - 3388.82] why you've given nine year old that
[3387.05 - 3390.77] still can go and eat the gluten and so
[3388.82 - 3392.24] forth and what do they usually get they
[3390.77 - 3393.83] just usually get the heart disease
[3392.24 - 3395.81] because the heart disease is caused by
[3393.83 - 3397.34] all the other poor foods and the end of
[3395.81 - 3399.32] standard American diets and all that
[3397.34 - 3401.75] stuff they usually get other things but
[3399.32 - 3402.92] they don't get all the different
[3401.75 - 3404.72] symptoms and conditions and the
[3402.92 - 3406.46] neurological symptoms that these younger
[3404.72 - 3407.57] people that all you guys lived in so
[3406.46 - 3409.58] many people there could even be watching
[3407.57 - 3412.16] this is that I'm getting because the
[3409.58 - 3414.23] gluten feeds the epstein-barr virus it
[3412.16 - 3416.03] feeds the pathogens I'm talking about
[3414.23 - 3417.86] thyroid healing here you might want to
[3416.03 - 3420.71] get this book amazon.com I can't even
[3417.86 - 3422.47] touch us touch all the information it's
[3420.71 - 3427.22] in here it's going to something else do
[3422.47 - 3430.43] so here we are here we've got pasta
[3427.22 - 3433.19] right so we got some pasta so that's
[3430.43 - 3435.83] another one too gluten so that's where
[3433.19 - 3437.00] we get in trouble so you got the pasta
[3435.83 - 3438.95] you got the gluten but so many people
[3437.00 - 3440.18] can eat pasta you know it's with
[3438.95 - 3442.70] somebody and they're just like I was
[3440.18 - 3447.08] with with a really older friend it was a
[3442.70 - 3449.06] retired doctor and he's 79 years old and
[3447.08 - 3450.44] I'm out with him and I'm out with him
[3449.06 - 3452.42] and we're out of place we're getting
[3450.44 - 3455.21] some teens so he gets like a pasta dish
[3452.42 - 3456.89] and it's just straight out pasta it's
[3455.21 - 3459.23] got eggs in it it's got wheat the whole
[3456.89 - 3463.04] bed he's enjoying himself and you know
[3459.23 - 3465.17] and he can but someone else can't some
[3463.04 - 3465.47] reason for that and there's a reason for
[3465.17 - 3467.12] that
[3465.47 - 3468.77] that's how it works I'm trying to give
[3467.12 - 3471.25] you the rundown how viruses work on
[3468.77 - 3474.01] packaging worst and then
[3471.25 - 3474.76] you got the corn chips right there I got
[3474.01 - 3479.92] the corn chips
[3474.76 - 3482.02] so Lauren feed viruses it feeds bacteria
[3479.92 - 3486.81] you have to know this this is why if
[3482.02 - 3489.46] your corn used to be a perfect food a
[3486.81 - 3492.70] life-saving food it used to be an
[3489.46 - 3495.94] unbelievable food wheat was actually a
[3492.70 - 3497.41] good food a long time ago corn was
[3495.94 - 3498.91] actually a good food is the corn
[3497.41 - 3502.18] tortilla this is actually a fun one
[3498.91 - 3504.10] right corn tortillas so anybody just
[3502.18 - 3505.30] logged on its foods why why we get in
[3504.10 - 3506.65] trouble with certain foods and talk
[3505.30 - 3507.82] about the epstein-barr virus and talk
[3506.65 - 3509.35] about sickness I'm talking about all
[3507.82 - 3511.30] these different symptoms conditions
[3509.35 - 3512.35] people are going through struggles are
[3511.30 - 3514.81] going through you want to stay on for
[3512.35 - 3517.78] this talking about thyroid healing my
[3514.81 - 3520.18] book the bottom line is corn will feed
[3517.78 - 3522.31] pathogens though see these foods were
[3520.18 - 3524.71] ruined on us they were like the eggs
[3522.31 - 3528.52] okay so we've got the eggs here the eggs
[3524.71 - 3530.74] it's not your fault that this food that
[3528.52 - 3533.74] was a survival food that people actually
[3530.74 - 3535.45] need it and used and it was an important
[3533.74 - 3537.52] food it's not your fault they took it
[3535.45 - 3539.11] they raised bugs in labs and they let
[3537.52 - 3541.15] the bugs out and that's why sicknesses
[3539.11 - 3543.37] develop to the degree it has and it's
[3541.15 - 3544.72] exploded to the degree it asked and how
[3543.37 - 3546.94] young people are sick with so many
[3544.72 - 3550.72] symptoms and conditions okay this is why
[3546.94 - 3552.22] so it's not your fault okay it's not my
[3550.72 - 3554.83] fault I'm not trying to be the food
[3552.22 - 3557.38] police here they ruin the food not me I
[3554.83 - 3558.85] mean if they didn't ruin it I'd probably
[3557.38 - 3559.42] showing up some of these foods in the
[3558.85 - 3561.94] whole bit
[3559.42 - 3563.95] and then I want to talk about this food
[3561.94 - 3565.81] for a little bit right here there's that
[3563.95 - 3567.37] one you guys this is fun I hope you're
[3565.81 - 3568.84] having some fun it means a lot of
[3567.37 - 3570.28] information it's really intense you want
[3568.84 - 3572.23] to watch this whole thing back again if
[3570.28 - 3573.43] you just hop down you want to you want
[3572.23 - 3575.35] to watch this from the start
[3573.43 - 3577.12] there's no question it's a powerful
[3575.35 - 3579.58] powerful episode to actually help you
[3577.12 - 3581.05] heal this food is an interesting food
[3579.58 - 3583.75] this is bacon now this is what's
[3581.05 - 3584.83] interesting here this won't feed viruses
[3583.75 - 3587.20] but you're going to think hey I could
[3584.83 - 3590.74] eat bacon now no no no no no don't eat
[3587.20 - 3595.21] bacon pork won't feed the epstein-barr
[3590.74 - 3597.01] virus okay so see it's not about hey is
[3595.21 - 3598.24] he vegan is he not is he about
[3597.01 - 3601.21] plant-based is he
[3598.24 - 3604.30] is he is the anti a IP is he is he blood
[3601.21 - 3606.19] type would it what is he I don't I don't
[3604.30 - 3608.32] subscribe to a belief system because
[3606.19 - 3610.45] they're all wrong they're all wrong in
[3608.32 - 3611.89] so many ways every last one of them even
[3610.45 - 3613.75] the vegan diets don't even have the
[3611.89 - 3615.61] right even that even the vegetarian
[3613.75 - 3617.89] diets even than even all the different
[3615.61 - 3620.14] ones the paimio guys because they don't
[3617.89 - 3621.16] know what causes illness see I'm not in
[3620.14 - 3623.77] the food Wars
[3621.16 - 3626.41] I don't fight over the little stuff I
[3623.77 - 3629.53] talk about the real stuff in the food
[3626.41 - 3631.27] wars ok so because what they're doing
[3629.53 - 3633.07] out there they're kept busy like the
[3631.27 - 3634.78] vegans are throwing you know fake
[3633.07 - 3636.13] science that the paleo aliens are
[3634.78 - 3638.29] throwing fake science at the vegans
[3636.13 - 3640.30] because it's all paid for they don't
[3638.29 - 3641.95] realize it and everybody's throwing all
[3640.30 - 3643.81] the stuff back and forth and then you
[3641.95 - 3645.61] have you know diets like the IP and all
[3643.81 - 3648.40] AIP and all these are different diets
[3645.61 - 3650.29] and and it keeps on going but none of
[3648.40 - 3651.94] those diets know what causes illness
[3650.29 - 3654.07] they don't know about that what you're
[3651.94 - 3655.57] learning here they don't they don't know
[3654.07 - 3657.22] about the epstein-barr virus and how it
[3655.57 - 3661.12] works and how it feeds and what foods it
[3657.22 - 3663.34] feeds on and it's sad because because of
[3661.12 - 3665.14] that they flip-flop everybody's playing
[3663.34 - 3666.79] guessing games and the vegans get scared
[3665.14 - 3668.02] and they run to the Palio's again and
[3666.79 - 3669.73] they start eating animal products or
[3668.02 - 3671.86] starting to eat eggs or whatever it is
[3669.73 - 3673.12] and it's sad and then the Palio's they
[3671.86 - 3674.65] all get scared they don't know what
[3673.12 - 3676.12] they're eating they run to veganism and
[3674.65 - 3678.58] they run there and the plant-based and
[3676.12 - 3680.20] nobody realizes it and so everybody's
[3678.58 - 3681.67] confused and nobody really knows what's
[3680.20 - 3682.87] going on and all these different diets
[3681.67 - 3685.00] are made and everybody's trying to
[3682.87 - 3686.53] figure it out and it's sad because we're
[3685.00 - 3687.94] covering it now times but epstein-barr
[3686.53 - 3691.75] what it feeds off of now let's talk
[3687.94 - 3695.29] about bacon bacon doesn't feed FCU bar
[3691.75 - 3697.06] it doesn't feed viruses but you would
[3695.29 - 3698.89] think hey if Anthony's saying that then
[3697.06 - 3699.91] hey maybe it's good to eat no it's not
[3698.89 - 3703.15] that I'll tell you why
[3699.91 - 3705.49] bacon burden is a liver it kills the
[3703.15 - 3707.56] liver and pancreas and that's not good
[3705.49 - 3710.44] if you have epstein-barr that's not good
[3707.56 - 3712.57] if you have a virus that's giving you
[3710.44 - 3714.07] eggs and pains pains tangles numbness
[3712.57 - 3716.38] ringing in the ears tinnitus vertigo
[3714.07 - 3717.88] even if you have past doubts of it but
[3716.38 - 3719.68] you don't have it now that means you got
[3717.88 - 3722.16] the epstein-barr in the system and so
[3719.68 - 3724.72] hot flashes heart palpitations
[3722.16 - 3725.65] thyroid disorders of all kinds all the
[3724.72 - 3727.60] different diagnoses
[3725.65 - 3729.07] talked about Lyme disease behind the
[3727.60 - 3731.17] epstein-barr or more than one
[3729.07 - 3733.03] epstein-barr in your system what can
[3731.17 - 3735.22] happen is if you're eating the bacon
[3733.03 - 3737.11] you're bombarding your liver with so
[3735.22 - 3738.70] much fact that it can't do its job it
[3737.11 - 3740.35] can't even hold up to its own immune
[3738.70 - 3741.76] system delivers own immune system which
[3740.35 - 3743.50] I talked about in the medical media book
[3741.76 - 3745.42] series this is tyreq healing today
[3743.50 - 3747.58] though it's important to know and what
[3745.42 - 3749.74] happens is with all that fat in
[3747.58 - 3751.51] burdening your blood system depleting
[3749.74 - 3752.74] your blood of oxygen like I was talking
[3751.51 - 3754.39] about early like the dairy products
[3752.74 - 3756.58] where your oxygen levels are depleting
[3754.39 - 3758.02] and dropping down okay and the fats
[3756.58 - 3760.54] Werdum in your liver and it's burning
[3758.02 - 3763.21] your pancreas you can't defend yourself
[3760.54 - 3765.55] against the epstein-barr so it grows and
[3763.21 - 3768.10] LIF rates it proliferate and actually
[3765.55 - 3770.05] expands and grows over time it can speed
[3768.10 - 3772.60] your process up to getting sick down the
[3770.05 - 3774.19] road that's what it can do so that's
[3772.60 - 3775.99] what happens when you eat a food that
[3774.19 - 3778.57] doesn't feed the virus but yet puts you
[3775.99 - 3781.81] in another way so important to
[3778.57 - 3786.69] understand so we covered a few we
[3781.81 - 3789.37] covered a few foods right now okay
[3786.69 - 3791.71] here's a really big part right here you
[3789.37 - 3794.17] have to learn about illness because you
[3791.71 - 3798.01] can't blame yourself you can't blame
[3794.17 - 3801.07] your body you can't blame your body
[3798.01 - 3802.57] being faulty that you created it so
[3801.07 - 3804.61] here's the thing that's happening now
[3802.57 - 3807.40] you guys and this is the war I feel like
[3804.61 - 3809.53] this is the worst what's happening is
[3807.40 - 3811.06] the industry's Big Pharma in the medical
[3809.53 - 3812.77] industries all the industry is now
[3811.06 - 3815.41] including alternative industry all
[3812.77 - 3817.39] bought into something they bought into
[3815.41 - 3819.79] the body attacking itself they bought
[3817.39 - 3822.40] into the body the theory that the body
[3819.79 - 3825.49] is attacking itself or the theory that
[3822.40 - 3827.50] genes are behind your condition these
[3825.49 - 3829.72] are theories they're not proven and
[3827.50 - 3831.94] that's the theory of your body attacking
[3829.72 - 3835.93] itself like in celiac like an autoimmune
[3831.94 - 3839.32] see autoimmune means they don't know the
[3835.93 - 3841.72] cause so they say you're the cause
[3839.32 - 3843.43] that's how it works in autoimmune
[3841.72 - 3845.41] diseases of all kinds eczema psoriasis
[3843.43 - 3846.76] and celiac anything any kind of
[3845.41 - 3850.03] autoimmune disease doesn't matter what
[3846.76 - 3852.46] it is they believe that you're the cause
[3850.03 - 3854.89] you see how it's been flipped that's how
[3852.46 - 3855.62] it's done they believe your body's
[3854.89 - 3857.78] attacking
[3855.62 - 3859.49] self so here you are going to dog here
[3857.78 - 3860.90] you are 20 years old or 20 years old are
[3859.49 - 3862.31] 40 years old whatever it is you're going
[3860.90 - 3864.59] to doctor to doctor and they're like
[3862.31 - 3867.29] okay I'm trying a different diet now I'm
[3864.59 - 3869.03] trying to new AMA IP diet no I'm trying
[3867.29 - 3870.62] to new this diet a defog mint diet or do
[3869.03 - 3872.69] whatever it is and you're doing like
[3870.62 - 3874.34] you're trying to do new thing every
[3872.69 - 3875.84] minute and you're trying okay I'm going
[3874.34 - 3877.10] to this alternate practition they say
[3875.84 - 3879.20] get rid of this and I'm trying to this
[3877.10 - 3882.38] and they say this you have to know
[3879.20 - 3883.58] something they all believe your body's
[3882.38 - 3885.05] attacking something you have an
[3883.58 - 3886.58] autoimmune condition if they diagnosed
[3885.05 - 3887.72] you with that autoimmune or been told or
[3886.58 - 3889.37] you've been told that's what it is or
[3887.72 - 3891.56] whatever weather is that some psoriasis
[3889.37 - 3893.96] or so forth and that puts the blame on
[3891.56 - 3896.00] you the system's been setting us up and
[3893.96 - 3897.41] setting women up for a reason I'm gonna
[3896.00 - 3899.87] go into that a little bit it's such an
[3897.41 - 3902.72] important episode right here it sets
[3899.87 - 3904.79] women up for disempowerment that's how
[3902.72 - 3907.07] you keep women weak that's how you break
[3904.79 - 3909.50] them down and you beat them down and you
[3907.07 - 3913.94] break their spirits this is how it's
[3909.50 - 3916.31] done okay because there are real reasons
[3913.94 - 3918.65] why women are suffering and they're sick
[3916.31 - 3921.14] in and - but there's real reasons
[3918.65 - 3923.18] there's the epstein-barr liars wreaking
[3921.14 - 3924.08] havoc there's other viruses to them
[3923.18 - 3925.34] they're going to all the different
[3924.08 - 3926.84] viruses and so forth
[3925.34 - 3929.69] there's real reasons why they're sick
[3926.84 - 3931.76] the system created the situation on this
[3929.69 - 3934.07] theory that there's an auto antibody
[3931.76 - 3936.02] discovered back in the 1950s that's
[3934.07 - 3938.60] responsible for the body turning on
[3936.02 - 3941.24] itself first of all it's impossible look
[3938.60 - 3944.17] at technology in 1950 okay
[3941.24 - 3947.12] trust me medicine 1950 was the dark ages
[3944.17 - 3948.47] dark ages the scariest thing you ever
[3947.12 - 3950.75] want to know how do I know
[3948.47 - 3952.37] I took the plenty of people I took the
[3950.75 - 3954.86] plenty of doctors from the from the
[3952.37 - 3957.38] yesteryear it was a nightmare
[3954.86 - 3959.15] okay testing and medical testing and
[3957.38 - 3964.10] understanding of the body and everything
[3959.15 - 3966.41] was the dark ages in 1948 1949 okay and
[3964.10 - 3969.20] this is remedial at best let me see you
[3966.41 - 3971.69] need to know how it works so here's the
[3969.20 - 3973.04] deal when it comes down to the theory of
[3971.69 - 3975.14] hey it's autoimmune your body's
[3973.04 - 3976.52] attacking itself that was a very design
[3975.14 - 3977.21] because people were streaming into
[3976.52 - 3979.25] doctor's office
[3977.21 - 3982.10] nobody know what made them sick women
[3979.25 - 3983.36] were piling in to doctors offices all
[3982.10 - 3985.79] across the globe I talked to a doctor
[3983.36 - 3988.25] really old doctor who had a practice
[3985.79 - 3990.77] back then to retire really old doctor
[3988.25 - 3993.11] had practice back then and he said and
[3990.77 - 3995.36] he said it was like something they've
[3993.11 - 3997.61] never seen before and they were shoved
[3995.36 - 4000.01] by the medical industry this theory of
[3997.61 - 4001.66] the body attacking itself as being the
[4000.01 - 4003.10] blame and doctors knew it couldn't be
[4001.66 - 4004.90] possible he knew the body wasn't
[4003.10 - 4006.82] attacking itself but they had a they had
[4004.90 - 4009.07] to be trained that from there on out in
[4006.82 - 4011.56] the medical universities and the medical
[4009.07 - 4014.26] schools so what happens is its ultimate
[4011.56 - 4017.56] disempowerment it's body shaming it's
[4014.26 - 4019.09] body shaming is what it's doing so I'm
[4017.56 - 4020.71] gonna talk talk to you about how it
[4019.09 - 4024.10] works okay about a few other things with
[4020.71 - 4026.11] that so it's not genetics it's not the
[4024.10 - 4028.45] autoimmune theory of the body attacking
[4026.11 - 4030.19] itself that's messing people up it's not
[4028.45 - 4034.39] you creating it either
[4030.19 - 4037.24] okay it's not that what happens is we
[4034.39 - 4039.49] become deficient over time we're not
[4037.24 - 4041.41] getting the right foods in us we're not
[4039.49 - 4043.66] getting the things we need our immune
[4041.41 - 4046.00] systems we can do stress due to other
[4043.66 - 4049.03] problems heartbreak and so forth and all
[4046.00 - 4049.51] kinds of things poor diet occurs too as
[4049.03 - 4050.98] well
[4049.51 - 4052.18] so you're got the bacon in there and
[4050.98 - 4054.01] you're knocking out the oxygen so
[4052.18 - 4055.45] there's no option to stop any viruses or
[4054.01 - 4057.40] pathogens you've got the gluten in there
[4055.45 - 4058.72] you're feeding pathogens you're feeding
[4057.40 - 4060.22] things that's what you're doing you're
[4058.72 - 4061.60] drinking some kefir because you think
[4060.22 - 4063.22] that's the answer and you're doing that
[4061.60 - 4065.05] you're eating some eggs and you're
[4063.22 - 4066.81] actually feeding the viruses and the
[4065.05 - 4069.28] pathogens is what you're doing and
[4066.81 - 4070.66] you're doing that and at the same time
[4069.28 - 4072.82] you're weakening your immune system
[4070.66 - 4075.28] you're lowering your immune system and
[4072.82 - 4076.96] the diet gets the diets poor along the
[4075.28 - 4078.82] way you're losing trace minerals like
[4076.96 - 4080.59] zinc because of stress and because of
[4078.82 - 4082.12] life there's all kinds of iron mental
[4080.59 - 4083.56] toxins coming in you're getting broken
[4082.12 - 4084.88] down you're getting heck toxic heavy
[4083.56 - 4086.59] metals you might have already started
[4084.88 - 4089.14] out in soil for toxic heavy metals and
[4086.59 - 4092.02] that's what's happening and then boom
[4089.14 - 4093.67] you end up getting mononucleosis or your
[4092.02 - 4095.59] first doubt of it that's not discovered
[4093.67 - 4098.53] stage 2 happens and you get this your
[4095.59 - 4100.03] first mononucleosis and it's hasn't even
[4098.53 - 4101.71] discovered because you just tired for a
[4100.03 - 4103.45] week and then it goes away it could be a
[4101.71 - 4106.00] real mild one or it could be a severe
[4103.45 - 4107.01] one either way that's how the virus
[4106.00 - 4108.99] moves into state
[4107.01 - 4110.13] - so I talked about the foods I talked
[4108.99 - 4112.77] about how that works I've talked about
[4110.13 - 4115.47] how women are being disempowered because
[4112.77 - 4117.60] women on this planet or world changers
[4115.47 - 4119.39] their powerful world changers and they
[4117.60 - 4121.29] just wanted to tell you that last part
[4119.39 - 4124.38] but when you get run down
[4121.29 - 4125.76] and you stand you get the flu and you're
[4124.38 - 4127.71] not eating good and you're getting
[4125.76 - 4129.72] deficient and you're not taking care of
[4127.71 - 4130.53] yourself and all these other things are
[4129.72 - 4131.97] happening because you're not being
[4130.53 - 4133.62] taught to take care of yourself or you
[4131.97 - 4136.05] just got too much going on in your life
[4133.62 - 4137.46] and then you get heartbreak or something
[4136.05 - 4139.71] else and you throw it all in or just
[4137.46 - 4141.39] stress of every day everything the
[4139.71 - 4143.37] immune system starts to weaken and break
[4141.39 - 4144.93] down is what happens and you end up
[4143.37 - 4146.25] going to the doctor with the diagnosis
[4144.93 - 4148.02] it's not even the right one
[4146.25 - 4149.67] it's not even hey you're viral now we
[4148.02 - 4151.50] have to get some antivirals in you we
[4149.67 - 4152.91] have to get you better instead it's wait
[4151.50 - 4154.26] a minute you might have autoimmune and
[4152.91 - 4155.58] your body's attacking itself and now
[4154.26 - 4157.08] you're driving home from the doctor's
[4155.58 - 4159.51] office thinking your body's worthless
[4157.08 - 4161.13] and it's faulty so with all that else we
[4159.51 - 4164.28] have going on this is how this
[4161.13 - 4166.38] empowerment for everybody goes so the
[4164.28 - 4168.15] body's immune system is that war with
[4166.38 - 4169.80] epstein-barr in stage 2 I want to go
[4168.15 - 4171.69] into that a little bit there's a stage 2
[4169.80 - 4173.34] with epstein-barr so first of all stage
[4171.69 - 4177.18] 1 is about it incubating in the body
[4173.34 - 4179.48] stage 2 is about the war that occurs
[4177.18 - 4181.74] with epstein-barr time our thyroid
[4179.48 - 4183.78] healing the most comprehensive Epstein
[4181.74 - 4186.57] Barr book on the planet now make sure
[4183.78 - 4188.70] you get it there's over 60 varieties of
[4186.57 - 4190.35] Epstein Barr remember that so everybody
[4188.70 - 4192.60] could have a different one different one
[4190.35 - 4194.73] some could be more severe so it could be
[4192.60 - 4196.59] let much less of the earth some another
[4194.73 - 4197.94] person's immune system might be stronger
[4196.59 - 4199.62] than another person's they might have
[4197.94 - 4201.15] less toxins they might have less issues
[4199.62 - 4203.79] going on their life so they're they're
[4201.15 - 4205.44] mononucleosis is really mild somebody
[4203.79 - 4207.42] else had mononucleosis could be really
[4205.44 - 4209.13] severe they got much more of a severe or
[4207.42 - 4211.47] aggressive form of Epstein Barr really
[4209.13 - 4214.20] important to know but the body's at war
[4211.47 - 4216.24] with the epstein-barr stage two is when
[4214.20 - 4217.56] there's a war going on so that's what's
[4216.24 - 4219.99] happening there so that's the stage
[4217.56 - 4221.82] stage two is stage two is your immune
[4219.99 - 4222.90] system so that's your white blood cells
[4221.82 - 4224.46] right here so you got all these
[4222.90 - 4226.68] different white blood cells going on me
[4224.46 - 4228.99] guys so hang in there for this little
[4226.68 - 4233.10] show get lymphocytes she got monocytes
[4228.99 - 4234.60] you got neutrophils you got you got the
[4233.10 - 4236.64] whole bit okay I'm trying to make it
[4234.60 - 4238.77] interesting anyway you're in me to get
[4236.64 - 4239.98] your killer cells right we just say that
[4238.77 - 4242.89] your
[4239.98 - 4245.11] so we have those they're there and they
[4242.89 - 4247.27] become the they basically go into war
[4245.11 - 4248.53] with the bad guys is what happens so
[4247.27 - 4250.84] here's your virus the epstein-barr virus
[4248.53 - 4253.21] that stage 2 comes out of incubation and
[4250.84 - 4258.45] now boom there's a war happening but the
[4253.21 - 4261.49] virus over time realizes realizes that
[4258.45 - 4264.19] it's going to lose the war because your
[4261.49 - 4268.00] immune system tags it your immune system
[4264.19 - 4270.31] releases a hormone a chemical compound
[4268.00 - 4271.65] your immune system releases is it what
[4270.31 - 4274.24] it does so your white blood cells
[4271.65 - 4276.91] releases chemical compound chemical
[4274.24 - 4278.50] compound attaches itself to the virus is
[4276.91 - 4280.30] what it does so the chemical compound
[4278.50 - 4281.83] released by your immune system by your
[4280.30 - 4284.83] lymphocytes okay
[4281.83 - 4287.47] tagged the virus so then when they tags
[4284.83 - 4290.35] the virus the virus knows it can't be in
[4287.47 - 4292.51] the body in the bloodstream fighting too
[4290.35 - 4294.37] much longer because that means you're
[4292.51 - 4296.41] gonna win the battle so there's this
[4294.37 - 4298.03] battle going on in stage 2 epstein-barr
[4296.41 - 4299.41] happens to everybody in anybody's life
[4298.03 - 4300.82] it doesn't matter if they felt like they
[4299.41 - 4302.17] thought they just had the flu for three
[4300.82 - 4303.73] weeks or the flu for two weeks and it
[4302.17 - 4305.46] wasn't the flu or it was a flu trigger
[4303.73 - 4308.32] off their epstein-barr or whatever it is
[4305.46 - 4309.61] what happens is they have their white
[4308.32 - 4312.31] blood count their white blood count
[4309.61 - 4314.29] releases a phytochemical compound I mean
[4312.31 - 4316.24] sorry chemical compound for the body it
[4314.29 - 4317.86] goes right on to the virus sticks to the
[4316.24 - 4320.65] virus and now the viruses days are
[4317.86 - 4322.96] numbered okay you start winning the war
[4320.65 - 4324.85] so that's how it works you start winning
[4322.96 - 4326.56] the war your your spit your mono
[4324.85 - 4328.24] symptoms start to die down you start
[4326.56 - 4330.10] getting your strength back your sore
[4328.24 - 4331.24] throat your fever or headache and rashes
[4330.10 - 4333.79] whatever it could be happening
[4331.24 - 4335.77] whatever's going on could start to die
[4333.79 - 4337.54] down and that's how it works okay
[4335.77 - 4339.01] symptoms can come and go over time but
[4337.54 - 4341.68] it starts to die down because your white
[4339.01 - 4343.30] count is winning but then your virus has
[4341.68 - 4345.13] to go somewhere so the Epstein virus
[4343.30 - 4347.05] actually has to go somewhere so it picks
[4345.13 - 4348.91] a home is what it does it heads
[4347.05 - 4350.65] somewhere it heads for the liver is
[4348.91 - 4352.51] where it loves to go it can head to the
[4350.65 - 4354.43] spleen to but the spleen but the liver
[4352.51 - 4355.99] is where it loves the most and it's the
[4354.43 - 4358.45] most important spot because it has the
[4355.99 - 4360.46] most fuel has the most food it has all
[4358.45 - 4360.73] that food I'm talking about stored up in
[4360.46 - 4363.13] it
[4360.73 - 4364.15] how's that bacon fat in there it has the
[4363.13 - 4366.16] gluten I talked to
[4364.15 - 4368.20] it has the milk in there it has toxins
[4366.16 - 4370.24] it has toxic heavy metals as mercury and
[4368.20 - 4372.64] they're defeated it's got aluminum it's
[4370.24 - 4374.44] got cadmium nickel arsenic it's got lead
[4372.64 - 4376.87] it's got all these different copper it's
[4374.44 - 4378.61] got metals in there and so the virus
[4376.87 - 4381.21] likes to sit inside the liver inside
[4378.61 - 4383.47] that garbage dump and it goes to sleep
[4381.21 - 4385.51] feeds and then sleeps just like
[4383.47 - 4387.49] Thanksgiving right you're getting a big
[4385.51 - 4389.38] turkey and then you hop on this finan
[4387.49 - 4392.11] you hop on the couch and now you're
[4389.38 - 4394.03] going to sleep you know and it just sits
[4392.11 - 4396.37] inside the liver and it has that that
[4394.03 - 4397.48] Thanksgiving meal and then it goes to
[4396.37 - 4398.86] sleep and then it has another
[4397.48 - 4400.99] Thanksgiving meal and it goes to sleep
[4398.86 - 4404.05] and then it start to reproduce itself is
[4400.99 - 4406.09] what it does because it still reproduces
[4404.05 - 4408.31] itself it grows its numbers it
[4406.09 - 4411.22] proliferate s-- over time causing
[4408.31 - 4413.14] problems and unfortunately that's where
[4411.22 - 4414.76] we go into like the ant we go into them
[4413.14 - 4416.20] and if you're not doing it to a virus
[4414.76 - 4418.15] and if you're not taking away the foods
[4416.20 - 4419.53] that it loves to feed on and if you're
[4418.15 - 4422.68] not cleaning up your toxic heavy metals
[4419.53 - 4424.12] it grows inside the liver and get us in
[4422.68 - 4426.19] trouble and that virus gets in trouble
[4424.12 - 4428.41] and the immune system doesn't even know
[4426.19 - 4430.78] it's there anymore the immune systems
[4428.41 - 4432.82] going around the body and doesn't see it
[4430.78 - 4435.82] in the bloodstream anymore and thinks it
[4432.82 - 4437.50] won the war so your immune system kind
[4435.82 - 4440.02] of goes back into dormancy to not
[4437.50 - 4442.93] dormancy back into the usual grind the
[4440.02 - 4446.38] everyday grind of life is what it does
[4442.93 - 4447.91] and this virus FC Morra stays inside the
[4446.38 - 4451.00] liver and incubates in there that's how
[4447.91 - 4453.81] it works okay going into another part
[4451.00 - 4456.28] here okay we're going into stage three
[4453.81 - 4460.60] epstein-barr so let's do that then it
[4456.28 - 4462.16] happens a lot of information gonna have
[4460.60 - 4466.54] to have some celery juice right there
[4462.16 - 4469.24] but--my back up so stage three a lot of
[4466.54 - 4471.40] people experience mono but don't get it
[4469.24 - 4472.99] diagnosed with mono so they experience
[4471.40 - 4474.91] mono so so many people experience
[4472.99 - 4476.25] symptoms they get rundown in college for
[4474.91 - 4478.63] a little bit they don't go to a doctor
[4476.25 - 4480.61] they get it running down not everybody
[4478.63 - 4483.55] goes to a doctor doctor does even look
[4480.61 - 4485.86] for mono so what there's millions and
[4483.55 - 4487.93] millions and millions of people who had
[4485.86 - 4490.21] mono that didn't even know they had mono
[4487.93 - 4492.64] but yet they have little Iran symptoms
[4490.21 - 4495.01] they have stage 3 because they don't
[4492.64 - 4495.92] know they even had stage 1 because they
[4495.01 - 4497.21] were never even guys
[4495.92 - 4498.68] and even if they weren't diagnosed
[4497.21 - 4500.09] there's no information out there but the
[4498.68 - 4503.66] medical meeting information that tells
[4500.09 - 4506.36] you how the stages work so Stage three
[4503.66 - 4508.34] is when the virus leaves the liver and
[4506.36 - 4510.11] heads to the thyroid so it goes to the
[4508.34 - 4511.76] thyroid masque what happens so the virus
[4510.11 - 4513.08] starts to go up the thyroid that's what
[4511.76 - 4514.67] it does it goes up to the thyroid to say
[4513.08 - 4516.65] this tortilla your thyroid the virus
[4514.67 - 4520.40] swings up the thyroid enters the thyroid
[4516.65 - 4523.16] and you start getting your slowly start
[4520.40 - 4524.87] getting your thyroid conditions and it
[4523.16 - 4526.49] could range in any of them so you're 38
[4524.87 - 4526.82] years old you're a woman you're 38 years
[4526.49 - 4529.31] old
[4526.82 - 4531.86] you get discovered that there's a little
[4529.31 - 4533.39] nodule on your thyroid that's because
[4531.86 - 4535.64] I've seen bars been there for a long
[4533.39 - 4537.02] time working on it that's how it works I
[4535.64 - 4539.90] talk about this information all in
[4537.02 - 4541.58] thyroid healing so maybe you're getting
[4539.90 - 4543.05] hypothyroidism it's not going to show up
[4541.58 - 4544.70] on a blood test it's not going to show
[4543.05 - 4546.80] them there because you've already had
[4544.70 - 4549.74] mono once before so here you go
[4546.80 - 4551.21] the virus can actually travel to the
[4549.74 - 4553.46] thyroid it's not going to show up on a
[4551.21 - 4555.29] blood test this is how it's escaped
[4553.46 - 4555.80] their medical system this is how it's
[4555.29 - 4558.14] worked
[4555.80 - 4560.06] doctors will most likely see antibodies
[4558.14 - 4561.74] to a past infection that's how
[4560.06 - 4563.24] indicating you had a past infection if
[4561.74 - 4564.86] they're really looking hard but they
[4563.24 - 4567.23] won't believe your thyroid problems or
[4564.86 - 4569.00] know their thyroid problems they believe
[4567.23 - 4570.56] it when they learn so many doctors are
[4569.00 - 4572.27] learning this information now from
[4570.56 - 4574.31] medical medium book series but they
[4572.27 - 4575.87] won't know that that's what's causing a
[4574.31 - 4577.64] thyroid problems your hypothyroidism
[4575.87 - 4579.05] your hyperthyroidism these your
[4577.64 - 4580.34] different writers of epstein-barr you
[4579.05 - 4583.07] can have hypothyroidism and
[4580.34 - 4584.48] hyperthyroidism all at the same time you
[4583.07 - 4585.80] can actually have them both because you
[4584.48 - 4587.90] can have two varieties of I've seen bar
[4585.80 - 4590.51] inside your thyroid that's how it works
[4587.90 - 4592.76] this is where the mistake happens
[4590.51 - 4594.44] meanwhile the virus becomes active again
[4592.76 - 4596.30] it travels from the liver to the thyroid
[4594.44 - 4597.95] causing problems and it fills your
[4596.30 - 4599.42] thyroid with toxins and poisons and it
[4597.95 - 4601.82] fills your liver with toxins and poisons
[4599.42 - 4603.71] and your lymphatic system gets all
[4601.82 - 4606.32] clogged up with these toxic the toxic
[4603.71 - 4608.51] poisons your lymphocytes get weak your
[4606.32 - 4609.74] lymphocytes around your thyroid get weak
[4608.51 - 4611.39] and they're not doing the job they're
[4609.74 - 4613.70] not even able to actually knock down
[4611.39 - 4615.53] epstein-barr because we're still eating
[4613.70 - 4617.00] the wrong foods we still have to toxic
[4615.53 - 4618.47] heavy metals we're still not cleaning or
[4617.00 - 4620.33] system up we're still not doing all the
[4618.47 - 4621.65] right things for ourselves medical
[4620.33 - 4623.51] research in science
[4621.65 - 4625.58] yet detected this information or
[4623.51 - 4628.04] detected the epstein-barr your thyroid
[4625.58 - 4629.18] has its own immune system research the
[4628.04 - 4631.49] science doesn't know that your thyroid
[4629.18 - 4633.98] has its own immune system well what
[4631.49 - 4635.93] happens is over time the virus will
[4633.98 - 4637.64] distract and wear down your overall
[4635.93 - 4638.81] body's immune system so I want to talk
[4637.64 - 4639.95] about this next part you got to watch
[4638.81 - 4641.89] this whole thing over again this
[4639.95 - 4645.59] information is really intense
[4641.89 - 4647.63] over time the virus has in stage four it
[4645.59 - 4649.19] wants to go to stage four okay that's
[4647.63 - 4650.36] what it wants to do that's a viruses
[4649.19 - 4654.14] want to do they always want to go to
[4650.36 - 4656.06] stage four and so this stage what they
[4654.14 - 4658.22] do is the viruses leave the liver and
[4656.06 - 4661.04] they start to break down the immune
[4658.22 - 4662.33] system they start to wear it down they
[4661.04 - 4663.92] stay in the liver and wear down the
[4662.33 - 4665.27] immune system the livers immune system
[4663.92 - 4666.65] they go out and they leave they wear
[4665.27 - 4669.47] down the immune system they release a
[4666.65 - 4671.21] tremendous amount of by-product toxic
[4669.47 - 4673.58] byproducts so these viruses release
[4671.21 - 4675.65] toxic by-product and that toxic
[4673.58 - 4677.27] by-product starts to break down the
[4675.65 - 4678.65] immune system throughout the entire body
[4677.27 - 4680.06] and that's when people start getting
[4678.65 - 4681.47] some different symptoms you start
[4680.06 - 4683.15] getting hot flashes and they start
[4681.47 - 4684.71] getting different heart palpitations
[4683.15 - 4686.24] because they got all this viral
[4684.71 - 4688.76] by-product floating around through their
[4686.24 - 4691.31] body and this is how this is how they
[4688.76 - 4693.41] start getting brain fog so what happens
[4691.31 - 4695.30] is you get the brain fog because you're
[4693.41 - 4697.04] on the edge of stage three stage for
[4695.30 - 4698.78] epstein-barr nobody knew it's been
[4697.04 - 4700.64] traveling throughout the body over the
[4698.78 - 4703.49] years it might have one or two varieties
[4700.64 - 4705.77] because the viruses that viruses are
[4703.49 - 4707.27] releasing a battery of poisons and
[4705.77 - 4709.37] toxins so that's what the epstein-barr
[4707.27 - 4711.80] does it releases a battery of poisons
[4709.37 - 4713.54] and toxins and as these poisons and
[4711.80 - 4716.15] toxins are floating around and floating
[4713.54 - 4718.55] around they weaken the immune system the
[4716.15 - 4720.11] reason why is because they need the weak
[4718.55 - 4722.51] in the immune system because they want
[4720.11 - 4725.45] to get to that next level they want to
[4722.51 - 4727.61] take your lymphocytes and distract them
[4725.45 - 4729.80] that's what the viruses want to do they
[4727.61 - 4732.77] want to distract your immune system so
[4729.80 - 4734.84] the thyroid becomes naked so it's there
[4732.77 - 4736.76] for more viruses to feed into your
[4734.84 - 4738.44] thyroid to go into the thyroid to feed
[4736.76 - 4741.02] on it so there's an action strategy
[4738.44 - 4742.79] viruses use that may sound scary but not
[4741.02 - 4744.23] if you have the right information not if
[4742.79 - 4745.73] you know how to heal that if you're not
[4744.23 - 4746.90] going to heal like so many thousands and
[4745.73 - 4748.58] hundreds of thousands of people all over
[4746.90 - 4750.68] the planet that use them books and heal
[4748.58 - 4752.78] you can actually arm yourself and
[4750.68 - 4754.10] actually heal you can heal your head
[4752.78 - 4755.57] and you could reverse it you could
[4754.10 - 4757.10] reverse all these different symptoms
[4755.57 - 4760.52] conditions all the stuff is really
[4757.10 - 4762.53] important so Stage four occurs when the
[4760.52 - 4765.65] body's immune system has been distracted
[4762.53 - 4766.97] and then the virus deals with the
[4765.65 - 4768.98] nervous systems that's when all the
[4766.97 - 4771.14] neurological symptoms start the eggs the
[4768.98 - 4772.61] pains the neurological fatigue all the
[4771.14 - 4774.98] different symptoms people get
[4772.61 - 4778.25] neurologically the anxiety the anxiety
[4774.98 - 4779.81] is caused by toxins being released by
[4778.25 - 4781.91] the epstein-barr virus floating around
[4779.81 - 4783.32] getting into the brain short-circuiting
[4781.91 - 4785.39] neurotransmitters a neurotransmitter
[4783.32 - 4787.28] camera holes weaken they start to
[4785.39 - 4788.03] dehydrate electrical impulses start to
[4787.28 - 4790.07] short-circuit
[4788.03 - 4792.23] that's what the virus does in stage four
[4790.07 - 4794.03] and so you start getting neurological
[4792.23 - 4795.23] symptoms your vagus nerve gets affected
[4794.03 - 4796.46] and I want to go into the vagus nerve
[4795.23 - 4797.81] for a couple of minutes you guys I know
[4796.46 - 4800.09] there's a lot of information and
[4797.81 - 4803.87] probably surprised you today with this
[4800.09 - 4805.40] live but it's so important so vagus
[4803.87 - 4806.87] nerve that's you're nervous that runs
[4805.40 - 4808.34] that he comes out of the brain it runs
[4806.87 - 4809.72] right down through your neck it runs
[4808.34 - 4811.69] right down your chest right down to your
[4809.72 - 4815.09] stomach right there that's the ultimate
[4811.69 - 4816.29] anxiety creating nerve it's not because
[4815.09 - 4817.76] your faulty it's not because you're
[4816.29 - 4819.11] mental it's not because you've got all
[4817.76 - 4820.85] these problems not because you're a bad
[4819.11 - 4822.05] person stuff because you're creating it
[4820.85 - 4825.29] with bad thoughts it's not because of
[4822.05 - 4827.81] any of that none of that helps if you
[4825.29 - 4829.91] got bad thoughts of course none of that
[4827.81 - 4831.56] helps but if you have a weakened vagus
[4829.91 - 4833.45] nerve that's already slightly inflamed
[4831.56 - 4835.58] from neurotoxins being produced in stage
[4833.45 - 4837.05] four by epstein-barr virus you're gonna
[4835.58 - 4838.22] have more of a sensitive baby star if
[4837.05 - 4839.60] you're gonna get tightness of chest
[4838.22 - 4841.40] you're gonna get panic attacks easy
[4839.60 - 4842.66] you're gonna get on and off in your life
[4841.40 - 4844.37] you're gonna have anxiety you're gonna
[4842.66 - 4845.51] feel all kind of like jittery you're
[4844.37 - 4846.77] gonna get shakes you're gonna get
[4845.51 - 4849.74] tingles and numbness you're gonna get
[4846.77 - 4851.96] different things all of this is symptoms
[4849.74 - 4853.55] of epstein-barr including you have
[4851.96 - 4855.14] ringing in the ears on and off and I
[4853.55 - 4856.61] know that a lot of you are like wait
[4855.14 - 4858.43] there's ringing in my ear someone's
[4856.61 - 4860.09] talking about me no that's not how it is
[4858.43 - 4862.22] ringing in the ears
[4860.09 - 4864.41] on and off intermittently on and off is
[4862.22 - 4866.36] an early sign that you got some EBV and
[4864.41 - 4867.65] you have to address it now because 20
[4866.36 - 4868.79] years from now you won't be saying hey
[4867.65 - 4870.38] somebody's talking about me anymore
[4868.79 - 4872.57] you'll be out of 10 doctors trying to
[4870.38 - 4874.07] get rid of your tinnitus it's important
[4872.57 - 4875.72] to have this information the one thing I
[4874.07 - 4877.40] don't play around with is fake
[4875.72 - 4879.52] information that's out there that just
[4877.40 - 4881.87] travels around and all of the healing
[4879.52 - 4883.70] modalities and all the healing movements
[4881.87 - 4884.36] that's all just I don't even know where
[4883.70 - 4886.49] this stuff
[4884.36 - 4889.04] from you have to deal with real
[4886.49 - 4890.87] information in order to heal and not get
[4889.04 - 4891.44] tricked in full this is just the way it
[4890.87 - 4894.44] goes
[4891.44 - 4896.24] ringing the ears periodically you gotta
[4894.44 - 4898.58] know you want to catch that early before
[4896.24 - 4899.96] it turns into odds not a lot of tinnitus
[4898.58 - 4902.24] down the road you got to know that
[4899.96 - 4904.28] tangles have numbness tingling numbness
[4902.24 - 4905.84] is sure you know when you're talking
[4904.28 - 4907.70] about ghost stories and it's at night
[4905.84 - 4909.77] and you're watching a lady outside of a
[4907.70 - 4911.42] ghost story show or something like that
[4909.77 - 4912.59] you might get the tingles up the back of
[4911.42 - 4914.15] the neck and the goosebumps and
[4912.59 - 4915.74] everything but I'm talking about tingles
[4914.15 - 4918.38] and numbness that comes periodically for
[4915.74 - 4920.75] no reason whatsoever you know connect
[4918.38 - 4922.55] restless leg syndrome tics spasms
[4920.75 - 4925.85] twitches floaters in the eyes and
[4922.55 - 4927.47] buzzing buzzing in the ears sounds in
[4925.85 - 4930.10] the ears popping in the ears heart
[4927.47 - 4932.96] palpitations plantar fasciitis brain fog
[4930.10 - 4936.02] confusion anxiety depression all start
[4932.96 - 4937.55] to occur with stage for epstein-barr you
[4936.02 - 4942.29] can have stage for epstein-barr at age
[4937.55 - 4944.36] 13 14 15 16 whatever age 25 age 30 age
[4942.29 - 4947.54] 40 the whole bit should just even know
[4944.36 - 4949.25] that neuro fatigue fatigue where your
[4947.54 - 4950.66] legs feel like cement you know it breaks
[4949.25 - 4952.82] my heart when I know people even go
[4950.66 - 4954.35] through any of this it kills me because
[4952.82 - 4956.33] especially when they've gone to doctors
[4954.35 - 4957.47] and you know they're yeah playing around
[4956.33 - 4958.79] with diets and things are getting a
[4957.47 - 4961.01] little better here and there and whatnot
[4958.79 - 4963.26] but they're not safe until they know
[4961.01 - 4965.36] what to do and he'll wash it for too
[4963.26 - 4967.25] many times I talk to too many doctors so
[4965.36 - 4969.83] the neuro fatigue the legs feel like
[4967.25 - 4971.45] bags of cement on them you know or you
[4969.83 - 4973.61] just feel like you can't push through
[4971.45 - 4975.23] you got to take naps during the day you
[4973.61 - 4976.73] need a nap in the middle of the day you
[4975.23 - 4977.63] got to lay down on the couch you got to
[4976.73 - 4979.79] close your eyes
[4977.63 - 4981.38] and and that's really hard for so many
[4979.79 - 4983.09] people and then you can't function you
[4981.38 - 4984.32] can't work or you you're working but
[4983.09 - 4985.91] you're not working at the peace and you
[4984.32 - 4988.01] get the brain fog with it all of it is
[4985.91 - 4989.30] so difficult and they can't get it man
[4988.01 - 4991.10] what about the people they can't get out
[4989.30 - 4992.51] of bed at all you guys and some of you
[4991.10 - 4994.67] probably know that are and some of you
[4992.51 - 4997.49] are them then you can even get out to
[4994.67 - 4999.41] get out of the bed in the morning and
[4997.49 - 5001.63] you have the deep neurological fatigue
[4999.41 - 5003.10] that's medical medium information
[5001.63 - 5005.53] neurological fatigue that's the whole
[5003.10 - 5007.03] point it's not just fatigue neurological
[5005.53 - 5008.86] fatigue it's your nervous system and
[5007.03 - 5010.84] there's a way to heal that's the stage
[5008.86 - 5012.55] for epstein-barr so many some people get
[5010.84 - 5014.89] a three Epstein bars foot around our
[5012.55 - 5015.84] system and it could be releasing these
[5014.89 - 5019.17] neurotoxins
[5015.84 - 5022.02] get out of bed and then Shannon Denham
[5019.17 - 5023.55] you're eating butter you're drinking
[5022.02 - 5025.62] coffee and having butter in your coffee
[5023.55 - 5027.39] to make you sicker and then you're doing
[5025.62 - 5029.22] eggs because you know no one's taught
[5027.39 - 5030.90] you that eggs actually feed the viruses
[5029.22 - 5034.16] nobody tells you that it is viruses so
[5030.90 - 5037.07] this is how you get in trouble and
[5034.16 - 5040.05] everybody is getting these symptoms
[5037.07 - 5042.75] decades before their grandmothers got
[5040.05 - 5045.87] the symptoms they're getting it decades
[5042.75 - 5048.57] before you know what I mean that here's
[5045.87 - 5050.46] how it works look what I mean by decades
[5048.57 - 5053.54] before the grandmothers that means their
[5050.46 - 5057.18] grandmothers didn't get the symptoms and
[5053.54 - 5060.06] in their life until later on in their
[5057.18 - 5063.83] life the grandmothers got the symptoms
[5060.06 - 5068.19] later on in their life most of them and
[5063.83 - 5071.76] now younger women are getting it at all
[5068.19 - 5073.20] ages and when they have a window where
[5071.76 - 5074.73] they're not having it and they're able
[5073.20 - 5076.56] to go to school they're able to go to
[5074.73 - 5077.82] college and able to graduate and they're
[5076.56 - 5079.56] able to start a career and they're able
[5077.82 - 5081.30] to go out to restaurants and drink wine
[5079.56 - 5082.32] and do whatever they want and go out
[5081.30 - 5084.24] with friends and all this other stuff
[5082.32 - 5087.21] and go travel around the world and all
[5084.24 - 5089.40] this it's only a short window it's
[5087.21 - 5091.35] wholly a short window it's this
[5089.40 - 5095.52] information they should take the heart
[5091.35 - 5098.40] it's only a short window unless you know
[5095.52 - 5100.29] what creates illness what creates
[5098.40 - 5102.36] chronic symptoms and conditions because
[5100.29 - 5104.28] it sneaks up on everybody no matter what
[5102.36 - 5105.23] I'm watching it I have watched you for
[5104.28 - 5108.48] over 35 years
[5105.23 - 5110.07] doctors watch it every day it's no one's
[5108.48 - 5112.59] getting away with it unless you know
[5110.07 - 5115.11] what the heck is going on and know how
[5112.59 - 5116.40] to heal it know what you need to do know
[5115.11 - 5118.53] how to heal it get the fiber and
[5116.40 - 5121.92] information get know what foods to stop
[5118.53 - 5124.80] know what all of it and other stuff too
[5121.92 - 5127.98] listen it's getting worse than ever once
[5124.80 - 5129.99] before and faster it's getting worse and
[5127.98 - 5131.40] faster EBD is more aggressive than ever
[5129.99 - 5133.92] was before and people are collecting
[5131.40 - 5136.92] them like collecting stamps and
[5133.92 - 5139.56] collecting coins look I get it if you're
[5136.92 - 5141.81] a critic or a skeptic and you don't
[5139.56 - 5143.25] understand how epstein-barr works and
[5141.81 - 5145.26] you don't understand
[5143.25 - 5148.02] how it's the blame for a huge part of
[5145.26 - 5149.76] our populations illness I get it you
[5148.02 - 5152.07] know you're gonna be like hey no way
[5149.76 - 5156.36] this doesn't make sense I get it I get
[5152.07 - 5159.75] it but it's actually the way it is you
[5156.36 - 5162.06] know this live is critical for you to
[5159.75 - 5164.61] know if you're a skeptic watch this live
[5162.06 - 5166.08] a couple of times be open-minded be
[5164.61 - 5167.82] open-minded for the people that need the
[5166.08 - 5170.82] help it's really important
[5167.82 - 5173.37] Epstein Barr is a blame for our
[5170.82 - 5175.38] population sickness a huge part don't
[5173.37 - 5177.11] get me wrong I talk about other viruses
[5175.38 - 5179.52] and I'm gonna go into that a little bit
[5177.11 - 5181.44] regardless of anyway the Epstein bars
[5179.52 - 5183.15] and entered your body through areas of
[5181.44 - 5185.31] the body fluids or any other way
[5183.15 - 5187.11] it runs these four stages and you can
[5185.31 - 5188.55] stop it and you can heal and you can
[5187.11 - 5189.90] move forward that's why people heal from
[5188.55 - 5191.70] the Lyme disease I'm medically in the
[5189.90 - 5193.38] information multiple sclerosis on there
[5191.70 - 5194.94] and medical medium information all these
[5193.38 - 5196.14] different symptoms conditions on it
[5194.94 - 5198.30] that's why they get their lives back
[5196.14 - 5201.03] that's why they lose weight the stories
[5198.30 - 5203.52] everywhere Women's World magazine that
[5201.03 - 5205.92] publication showcases it has a spread in
[5203.52 - 5208.02] the magazine every month every other
[5205.92 - 5210.15] month medical meeting people actually
[5208.02 - 5212.16] healing from all the stuff they did they
[5210.15 - 5213.60] would never pay to do it they did it on
[5212.16 - 5215.64] their own they did it with the books
[5213.60 - 5218.43] they get it with the information first
[5215.64 - 5219.87] for women always also talk about that so
[5218.43 - 5221.61] these different publications that know
[5219.87 - 5223.50] the informations healing people they see
[5221.61 - 5226.41] if they see these miraculous stories you
[5223.50 - 5229.56] guys see it every day so let's talk
[5226.41 - 5232.95] about some different things epstein-barr
[5229.56 - 5234.24] is different because it runs through
[5232.95 - 5236.43] different parts of the body
[5234.24 - 5238.53] EB V goes through all kinds of different
[5236.43 - 5240.21] parts of the body causes different
[5238.53 - 5242.22] problems I've explained so I've seen
[5240.21 - 5244.23] Barker go to the thyroid it can go to
[5242.22 - 5246.27] others it goes to the liver it goes to
[5244.23 - 5248.04] the reproductive system it can go to the
[5246.27 - 5249.66] brain it can do a lot of different
[5248.04 - 5251.04] things neurotoxins and float around and
[5249.66 - 5253.32] go to the brain so let's talk about why
[5251.04 - 5255.09] a woman for a couple of minutes why
[5253.32 - 5256.65] women in such greater numbers are
[5255.09 - 5257.97] getting affected with chronic illness
[5256.65 - 5259.59] and getting epstein-barr to such a
[5257.97 - 5261.72] degree one of the biggest physical
[5259.59 - 5263.49] differences is the menstrual cycle when
[5261.72 - 5264.75] a woman has her menstrual cycle eight
[5263.49 - 5267.33] percent of her immune system gets
[5264.75 - 5269.46] knocked down okay so when 80 percent of
[5267.33 - 5273.21] our immune system gets knocked down once
[5269.46 - 5274.27] a month it leaves everything open for a
[5273.21 - 5276.16] virus of pathogen
[5274.27 - 5277.84] anything else so say a woman has two
[5276.16 - 5279.40] varieties of streptococcus and they got
[5277.84 - 5281.26] they got acne all the time or they had
[5279.40 - 5283.66] strep throat in their life and they have
[5281.26 - 5284.65] acne okay or they had ear infections
[5283.66 - 5285.76] when they were younger when they have
[5284.65 - 5287.80] their menstrual cycles when they're
[5285.76 - 5290.77] getting older their immune system drops
[5287.80 - 5293.08] down 80% of the immune system drops down
[5290.77 - 5295.84] because each month the reproductive
[5293.08 - 5298.12] system in a woman demands a tremendous
[5295.84 - 5300.82] amount of energy and resources it
[5298.12 - 5302.56] demands full attention for it for
[5300.82 - 5304.96] resources is what it does the
[5302.56 - 5308.92] reproductive system needs almost its
[5304.96 - 5311.50] entire immune system governing over it
[5308.92 - 5314.41] so that she could prepare her body to
[5311.50 - 5315.70] having a baby so what happens is that
[5314.41 - 5318.07] when you have your reproductive system
[5315.70 - 5319.63] coming up it's the body puts be
[5318.07 - 5320.92] preparing that's the body preparing
[5319.63 - 5323.41] itself to have babies the menstrual
[5320.92 - 5325.81] cycle is critical so what happens here
[5323.41 - 5327.82] is 80% of the immune system drops down
[5325.81 - 5331.03] and goes to the reproductive system is
[5327.82 - 5333.16] where it goes and it goes towards the
[5331.03 - 5335.56] womb it's critical that it goes towards
[5333.16 - 5338.71] the womb and there's a reason for this
[5335.56 - 5341.29] because it's preparing it's guarding and
[5338.71 - 5345.67] preparing cleaning and prepping the
[5341.29 - 5347.35] reproductive system to to you know pass
[5345.67 - 5349.15] on generations and generations and
[5347.35 - 5350.74] generations to start generations it's
[5349.15 - 5354.67] our way to survive and live so the
[5350.74 - 5357.13] immune system drops down so ok so that
[5354.67 - 5359.56] means once a month just with that alone
[5357.13 - 5361.60] a woman's immune system drops down and
[5359.56 - 5363.16] weekends so if there's an Epstein bar
[5361.60 - 5365.23] just caught recently through a
[5363.16 - 5367.54] relationship or through a friendship or
[5365.23 - 5368.89] through anything or through any kind or
[5367.54 - 5371.05] in a restaurant all the different things
[5368.89 - 5372.49] or a public bathroom or a family member
[5371.05 - 5375.43] and Epstein bar is passed on to one
[5372.49 - 5377.20] person to another and that menstrual
[5375.43 - 5378.79] cycle is happening and then also stress
[5377.20 - 5380.14] is happening in that person's life in
[5378.79 - 5381.40] that woman's life and stress and
[5380.14 - 5383.29] different things or hardships or
[5381.40 - 5384.97] whatever it is the immune system can get
[5383.29 - 5387.19] kicked down a lot throughout the body
[5384.97 - 5389.47] and the virus can actually proliferate
[5387.19 - 5392.92] because of that reason alone and then
[5389.47 - 5394.84] there's ovulation where 40% of the
[5392.92 - 5396.70] body's immune system has to go to the
[5394.84 - 5399.76] reproductive system during ovulation
[5396.70 - 5401.86] once again preparing the woman for
[5399.76 - 5405.61] conception and the whole bit this means
[5401.86 - 5407.28] twice a month a woman's immune system is
[5405.61 - 5410.22] weakened down one of the men's
[5407.28 - 5412.65] man's immune system is not that's why
[5410.22 - 5415.62] men don't get chronic illness to the
[5412.65 - 5417.93] degree women do okay so that's one of
[5415.62 - 5420.06] the big reasons it's also why women get
[5417.93 - 5422.61] acne during the menstrual cycle because
[5420.06 - 5423.27] since our immune system lowers after
[5422.61 - 5424.53] being accursed
[5423.27 - 5427.32] because acne is caused by streptococcus
[5424.53 - 5430.32] not hormones C hormones was the old
[5427.32 - 5431.79] blame game it started out with hormones
[5430.32 - 5433.86] and it started out with the body's
[5431.79 - 5436.92] attacking itself now it's now it's going
[5433.86 - 5438.87] to genes these are all blame games on
[5436.92 - 5441.27] women and their bodies trying to train
[5438.87 - 5443.28] them their bodies were faulty that their
[5441.27 - 5445.71] bodies were weak or they create it and
[5443.28 - 5447.90] that's what it's all to sell hormones
[5445.71 - 5449.67] it's all to sell different drugs it's
[5447.90 - 5451.44] all to sell things and that's why that
[5449.67 - 5454.79] whole system was created back in the day
[5451.44 - 5458.07] but what causes acne during during
[5454.79 - 5460.17] menstruation during a cycle causes acne
[5458.07 - 5462.90] is streptococcus so that's what causes
[5460.17 - 5465.00] it strike strep bacterias and strep
[5462.90 - 5466.50] bacteria streptococcus is a cofactor to
[5465.00 - 5468.54] epstein-barr that means it's trucks
[5466.50 - 5469.89] around epstein-barr lives in the body to
[5468.54 - 5471.66] always remember that so if you have
[5469.89 - 5473.73] strep as a child that means there's an
[5471.66 - 5475.80] Epstein bar in in in the child too
[5473.73 - 5478.44] that's how it works there's over 50
[5475.80 - 5480.57] groups of strep with multiple strains
[5478.44 - 5482.82] per group and science research is
[5480.57 - 5486.09] unaware of this there's way more way
[5482.82 - 5488.73] more letters in a group than alpha that
[5486.09 - 5490.26] than the alphabet has for streptococcus
[5488.73 - 5491.88] that's how many varieties of
[5490.26 - 5493.83] streptococcus and streptococcus is
[5491.88 - 5495.36] becoming superbug now it's becoming
[5493.83 - 5496.68] antibiotic resistant that's why
[5495.36 - 5498.03] everybody gets the acne that's why
[5496.68 - 5499.62] there's so many problems it's why people
[5498.03 - 5501.06] get infections why kids getting there
[5499.62 - 5502.92] from ear infections and you're doing the
[5501.06 - 5504.09] so you're doing the antibiotics and it
[5502.92 - 5505.59] can't get rid of the ear infection it
[5504.09 - 5507.30] keeps them coming back that's why UTIs
[5505.59 - 5510.63] urinary tract infections bladder
[5507.30 - 5512.91] infections bacterial vaginosis all of
[5510.63 - 5514.14] these things are streptococcus related
[5512.91 - 5515.94] the reason why they don't get better
[5514.14 - 5517.44] with antibiotics or they get temporarily
[5515.94 - 5519.63] and it's on and off because it gets more
[5517.44 - 5520.71] resistant and there's ways of healing
[5519.63 - 5522.24] this and they talk about all the
[5520.71 - 5523.68] different conditions and chronic
[5522.24 - 5525.81] symptoms conditions in the book you
[5523.68 - 5529.05] should get the thyroid healing book men
[5525.81 - 5530.40] suffer from prostate cancers and and
[5529.05 - 5533.07] prostate problems because of
[5530.40 - 5534.26] epstein-barr virus and streptococcus
[5533.07 - 5536.64] something to know about
[5534.26 - 5537.77] epstein-barr treats prostate cancer and
[5536.64 - 5539.96] men's
[5537.77 - 5542.06] all of that breast cancer I've seen Bart
[5539.96 - 5544.22] causes breast cancer miscarriages
[5542.06 - 5547.04] infertility preeclampsia caused by
[5544.22 - 5550.10] breast caused by epstein-barr buyers so
[5547.04 - 5551.87] miscarriages not all miscarriages don't
[5550.10 - 5554.27] get me wrong on that a lot of
[5551.87 - 5556.10] miscarriages are caused by reproductive
[5554.27 - 5557.60] issues created by epstein-barr virus a
[5556.10 - 5559.12] lot infertility issues not all
[5557.60 - 5561.71] infertility but a lot of infertility
[5559.12 - 5565.49] mysterious mysterious miscarriages
[5561.71 - 5567.01] mysterious infertility those are much of
[5565.49 - 5570.14] those are caused by epstein-barr virus
[5567.01 - 5571.46] so there's something no preeclampsia
[5570.14 - 5573.32] that's symptoms of epstein-barr virus
[5571.46 - 5575.21] because the immune system drops when a
[5573.32 - 5576.26] woman's pregnant and so because it drops
[5575.21 - 5577.85] if you have a certain variety of
[5576.26 - 5579.83] epstein-barr you can get a lot of signs
[5577.85 - 5583.28] of preeclampsia and so that's really
[5579.83 - 5586.25] important to know so let's go a little
[5583.28 - 5587.69] bit further here I have look I have a
[5586.25 - 5589.25] whole section in thyroid healing on
[5587.69 - 5590.54] these topics really important remember
[5589.25 - 5593.39] there's over 60 varieties of Epstein
[5590.54 - 5595.31] Barr not just 160 varieties of pathogens
[5593.39 - 5597.38] is what it means not just one type of
[5595.31 - 5598.85] virus if you're a critic skeptic watch
[5597.38 - 5601.04] this whole thing all over again if you
[5598.85 - 5602.69] haven't seen it from the beginning make
[5601.04 - 5604.46] your own judgment call I'm totally fine
[5602.69 - 5605.75] with that critics are smart they're
[5604.46 - 5608.00] smart they know what they're saying you
[5605.75 - 5609.77] know haters are different but critics
[5608.00 - 5611.96] critics are smart intelligent people
[5609.77 - 5613.64] that want to learn and know and they
[5611.96 - 5615.20] want to have an open mind so make sure
[5613.64 - 5616.79] you look at this look at the book if I
[5615.20 - 5618.41] was a critic get the book and read it
[5616.79 - 5621.17] you don't want to pay for it go to the
[5618.41 - 5624.02] library get it out for free blaming our
[5621.17 - 5625.73] bodies on being autoimmune and our body
[5624.02 - 5627.89] attacked in itself blaming our genes
[5625.73 - 5629.90] blaming the facts the fact that we think
[5627.89 - 5631.52] we created it because of some emotional
[5629.90 - 5633.35] thing that's deep down inside is a
[5631.52 - 5635.45] really dangerous situation especially
[5633.35 - 5637.28] for young people it's kind of it's it's
[5635.45 - 5639.86] bad enough for older people like in
[5637.28 - 5641.42] their fifties in 60s and 40s telling
[5639.86 - 5644.33] them that they can handle it a little
[5641.42 - 5646.37] better but telling people that are 15 16
[5644.33 - 5647.72] years old 17 years old 18 years old that
[5646.37 - 5649.99] their body is attacking itself when it's
[5647.72 - 5653.48] not when it's an outdated theory and
[5649.99 - 5655.67] it's really devastating beyond
[5653.48 - 5658.52] devastating telling a 15 year old that
[5655.67 - 5661.16] it's their genes is devastating when
[5658.52 - 5663.68] it's not their genes it's devastating I
[5661.16 - 5665.99] mean don't you think so or or do I live
[5663.68 - 5667.13] in a bubble it's just unbelievable
[5665.99 - 5668.91] it's the greatest body shaming
[5667.13 - 5670.53] techniques I've ever seen
[5668.91 - 5671.88] by Big Pharma and it's right under
[5670.53 - 5673.56] everybody's noses and I'm the only
[5671.88 - 5674.91] person talking about it literally the
[5673.56 - 5676.38] only person talking about it and that
[5674.91 - 5678.63] breaks my heart alone because well
[5676.38 - 5680.82] because it's just that's how literally
[5678.63 - 5682.50] full people are you want a body shame
[5680.82 - 5683.82] somebody tell them that their body's
[5682.50 - 5686.85] immune system is destroying your own
[5683.82 - 5688.68] glands when it's not when it's not the
[5686.85 - 5690.18] body's body doesn't work like that
[5688.68 - 5691.23] when it's a theory that was created
[5690.18 - 5693.27] because they didn't know what causes
[5691.23 - 5694.89] illness when autoimmune disease they
[5693.27 - 5697.20] have no they have no car they don't know
[5694.89 - 5699.18] the causes of it so just remember that
[5697.20 - 5702.06] or it's attacking the skin like eczema
[5699.18 - 5703.65] psoriasis so that you know when you do
[5702.06 - 5705.42] that you're really but you're really
[5703.65 - 5707.49] hurting people kicking them down body
[5705.42 - 5710.55] shame shaming them disempowering them
[5707.49 - 5712.11] and that's what even they do that so
[5710.55 - 5714.15] that the industry's Bank on women's
[5712.11 - 5716.52] suffering and keep them down because
[5714.15 - 5717.63] their world changers never forget that
[5716.52 - 5718.98] because that's what they're doing so
[5717.63 - 5722.19] don't get fooled don't get pushed into
[5718.98 - 5723.99] it still critical you know somebody just
[5722.19 - 5725.64] said I was one of the 14 year-olds when
[5723.99 - 5727.41] psoriasis and depression started and
[5725.64 - 5729.33] skin disease and they said it was her
[5727.41 - 5732.51] genes I just saw that comment come up
