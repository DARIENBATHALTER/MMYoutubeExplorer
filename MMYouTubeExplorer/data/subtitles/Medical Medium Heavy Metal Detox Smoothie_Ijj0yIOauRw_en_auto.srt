little while now I've been busy working

485
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,679
on all kinds of stuff this hits the spot

486
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:01,600
like nobody's business it hits the spot

487
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,640
but it really

488
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,120
does think about that

489
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,080
okay when we heal depression anxiety

490
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,000
depersonalization OCD bipolar out there

491
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,279
so many people have that when we're

492
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,720
struggling all kinds of different aches

493
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,799
and pains and different symptoms and we

494
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,120
reverse this what what does that mean

495
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:22,400
someone was asking about ingredients

496
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,600
which ones are in it I saw that too and

497
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,159
I have to go and run run by this again

498
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,360
if you guys don't mind barley grass

499
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,919
juice powder that's one of of the

500
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,760
five barley grass juice powder now don't

501
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,080
get this confused with barley grass cuz

502
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,480
people just go to the store they buy

503
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,919
barley grass that ain't going to do it

504
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,919
uh uh uh it's not going to do it it's

505
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,720
not has to be the barley grass juicee

506
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,880
pattern that this is the vimergy barley

507
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,559
grass juicee pattern it's the one I

508
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,120
endorse it's the one I work with and

509
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,480
endorse because it's incredible it's

510
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,159
that good so I stand behind it

511
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,960
wholeheartedly stand behind it I know

512
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,039
how good it is I know there's no binders

513
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,120
in here there's no agents hidden in here

514
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:00,760
did you know they do that in all the

515
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,279
powders out there they have all these

516
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,039
secret binders that aren't on the

517
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,960
ingredient list did you guys know that

518
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,960
they so so that it doesn't Clump up do

519
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,360
you know like no one realizes this they

520
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,600
go and they buy powders and different

521
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,919
things and it's all got these

522
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,480
anti-caking agents in there so that it

523
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,600
doesn't Clump up I don't care about a

524
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,480
clump I don't want garbage in my

525
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,039
products I don't care if there's a clump

526
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,880
like if barley grass cheese powder

527
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,039
clumped together and so what who wants

528
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,400
anti-caking agents that no one even

529
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,919
knows what it is it could be anything it

530
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,760

00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:53,480
propolis is right there it is liquid

1113
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,839
gold it's hard to say okay total immune

1114
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,200
is so good such in first of all I take

1115
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:00,640
take total immune every single day okay

1116
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,520
but I'm just telling people if they can

1117
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,440
only take one thing and one thing only I

1118
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,880

1119
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,680
propolis and

1120
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:13,960

fine it's so powerful it's also so

1122
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,640
