1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,520
We're talking about how the chemtrails

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,960
kill the birds. Ducks flying at 10,000

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,920
ft will match a chemtrail plane flying

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,120
at 10,000 ft. So, simplifying it a

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,760
little bit, birds fly high, chemtrail

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,320
planes fly low, birds get caught into

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,279
the chemtrails themselves and get

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,279
snuffed out and then die. And we're not

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,680
just talking about a few birds. We're

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,199
talking about thousands of birds. tens

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,960
of thousands in just a flock migrating.

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,719
We're talking about a massive amount of

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,440
birds dying close to death almost at

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,320
exactly the same time. And keep in mind,

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,160
every batch lot in the plane, every

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
group of chemicals that they have that

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,079
they're dumping, whether it's

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,399
geoengineering planes or a chemtrail

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,760
plane, can be different at any given

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,079
time. So, some concoctions could be

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,640
instantly deadly, while some are

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,039
intoxicating and dangerous enough to

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,440
weaken the birds, causing their flight

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,000
pattern to be disturbed, causing them to

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,400
weaken and have to drop out of the sky,

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,119
disturbing the process of nature,

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,640
destroying the very birds we love. So,

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,520
how do 10,000 birds die at a clip? How

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,520
does it really happen?

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,260
