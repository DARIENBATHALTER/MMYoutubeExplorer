information from above s so lots of

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,640
questions I asked lots of questions that

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,719
I thought about other people have asked

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,200
me and what happens is it turns into the

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,600
situation where you're saying okay but

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
wait a minute how does it work with

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,079
demons what happens with demons are

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,840
demons even real what is a demon what

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,399
does a demon

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,680
do what happens to somebody's Soul when

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,440
they pass where does it go what happens

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,800
with that and the question is just roll

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,400
into one question after another after

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,799
another you if you don't know what I'm

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,119
talking about I'm talking about angels

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,000

Angels demons and spiritual Tools in

29
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,560
Amazon Apple it's there too uh I think

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,400
it's on Spotify I think it's there too

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,240
but so what would happen is I'm like

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,520
okay Spirit okay what is a demon like

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,320
for real though people say this and

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,799
people say that and people do this and

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,960
people what is what's really what is

36
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,079
what is a

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,520
demon and

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,680
so it's information that I think you got

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,560
to be ready for you have to be ready for

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,719
the information I'm going to be honest

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,360
and you might want to like keyate it a

42
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:56,560
little bit you might want to decant it a

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,680
little bit you might want to increment

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,960
it a little bit if that's even a word if

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,759
any of those are words you might want to

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,320
just kind of ease into it the seven and

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,640
a half hours you might start with a half

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,560
an hour you listen to that half an

49
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,280
hour and then you go okay okay okay all

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,239
right all right and then you back away

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,720
from it because there's so much to

52
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,360
digest because I actually have a

53
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,879
source that understands what Angels what

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:31,319
demons are what kind of spiritual tools

55
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:35,480
to use and information about yes hell

56
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,440
yes hell and other information too so

57
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,680
when it's real information from above

58
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,920
the game Changes Everything Changes it's

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,239
not like oh theories and theorizing and

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,720
theologists you know going into some

61
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,720
scripture and you know looking into here

62
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,040
and looking into here but this says this

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,319
and this is that and then summary you

64
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,800
know summarizing what they think it

65
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:03,879
could be when you hear it from s so and

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,200
you hear about demons and you hear about

67
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,599
angels and you hear about things like

68
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,959
hell and you hear about and then you

69
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,400
hear what it really is and what's

70
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,040
happening it's something that's a whole

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,879
another level of understanding it's a

72
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,200
whole another level of all kinds of

73
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,280

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,599
that's that's I'm actually like nervous

161
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,639
nervous I mean look I I've done a

162
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:36,080
trillion lives trillion lives right I

163
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,240

164
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,039
been live a lot of times over the years

165
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,240
right and I've done different things but

166
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm nervous just talking about the

167
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,520
angels and demons and spiritual tools

168
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,720
just talking about angel Steven

169
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,919
spiritual tools because it's so intense

170
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,919
and it's so jam-packed but it's not just

171
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,520
jam-packed it's not like it's different

172
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,919
than the medical medium books the other

173
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,120
medical medium books it's different than

174
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,280
cleanse to heel it's different than

175
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,919
brain saver it's different than you know

176
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,680
medical medium books because it's the

177
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,120
spiritual end of things and there's

178
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,240
spiritual information in these medical

179
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
medium books the spirit of compassion

180
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,879
has given a lot of spiritual about the

181
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,639
soul about lots of things in the medical

182
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,319
medium books but

183
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,680
then if you like is the Grim Reaper real

it let's get down to

467
00:20:50,480 --> 00:21:01,080
it bird flu think it's stupid no it's

468
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:04,720
not bird flu think it's funny no it's

469
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,600
not right now something's happening and

470
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,400
people are not aware of it oh but I'm

471
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,159
aware of the bird flu aw have heard

472
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,200
about the bird flu many times different

473
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,039
than any other bird flu it's a bird flu

474
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,679
that's out there on

475
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,640
purpose is that a crappy job that one

476
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,480
right there it's a bird flu that's

477
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,480
actually out there on

478
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,799
purpose and it's out there for reason

479
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,240
and and it's like there's a bad flu out

480
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:35,240
there now right it's out there for a

481
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,440
reason so that the bird flu and the flu

482
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:42,679
come together and they produce something

483
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,000
else like a mutation of a bird flu

484
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,919
that's the

485
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,960
goal anyway don't eat chicken is the

486
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,400
name of this episode or you know stay

487
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,440
away from chicken or whatever you want

488
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,799
to call it keep chicken away so let's go

489
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,679
into it a little

490
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,679
bit I got a roasted chicken right here

491
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,320
as you can see I also have some others

492
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,720
chicken too I got some chicken tenders

493
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,279
or whatever you want to call them I

494
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,480
don't know what you call them I got some

495
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:10,279
Buffalo WIS here as well just going to

496
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,840
place them in front of us right here I

497
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,640
got the white board we're going to talk

498
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,159
about this stick around for this little

499
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,559
talk cuz it's critical it is it's

500
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,360
critical the bird flu was designed and

501
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,679
manufactur it in a lab that's what it

502
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,600
was it's not a natural occurring thing a

503
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,120
bird can't catch a flu a bird doesn't

504
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,320
produce a flu it doesn't work like that

505
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,000
so it's not like a bird just suddenly

506
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,039
came down with the flu the flu the Aven

507
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,320
bird flu the bird

508
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,520
flu the different strains of bird flu

509
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,880
they just don't produce themselves they

510
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,919
don't come out of nowhere they're put

511
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,240
out there they're put out there in the

512
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,960
crops and I'm just hinting to something

513
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,720
but you

514
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,320
know

515
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,840
drones

516
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,320
drones yeah sorry I don't know if you

517
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,720
heard that right

518
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:06,640
there but I have a bad cough I got the

519
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
bird flu just kidding I don't have a bad

520
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,880
cough how did that bird flu get out

521
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,480
there

522
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,440
um so the bird flu is put out there

523
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,600
purposely so Birds catch it wild birds

524
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,159
are catching it right now wild birds are

525
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,799
they're falling out of the sky in droves

526
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,080
geese are falling out of the sky in

527
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:32,159
droves Just landing on highways right

528
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,080
now people just don't realize this but

529
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,720
it but it's happening geese are falling

530
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,520
out of the

531
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:44,840
sky ducks are falling out of the sky

532
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,360
Robins are falling out of the sky yes

533
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,440
Robins because the bird flu is designed

534
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,440
to kill the bird it's not designed for

535
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:57,240
the bird to survive birds don't normally

536
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,039
survive a bird flu not this one now and

537
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,240
not this one here

538
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,200
when the bird catches the bird flu the

539
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,559
bird dies the bird dies not because the

540
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:11,559
bird's adrenals explode just like other

541
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:13,799
flu and so forth and like ca right and

542
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:16,640
the adrenals

543
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:20,520
explode but bird the birds die from the

544
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:25,159
bird flu because the bird flu virus goes

545
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,360
after the cells of the bird after the

546
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,640
organ

547
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,799
cells after the muscle

548
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:37,440
cells after the fat

549
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:40,919
cells so the virus is designed to go and

550
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,960
eat to go and feast on these cells to

551
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,960
attack the cells on the deepest level

552
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,640
the bird flu is designed that virus is

553
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,200
designed to attack the bird's nervous

554
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,120
system it's designed to attack the

555
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,720
bird's brain and nerves that's why the

556
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,200
birds suddenly get the bird flu and with

557
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,360
an hour the bird just

558
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,600
dies that's what's

559
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,880
happening the reason why they're

560
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,080
executing and killing so many birds

561
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,720
right now so many different p in the

562
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,360
poultry World agricultural the poultry

563
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,919
world

564
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,880
right the reason why they're killing so

565
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,600
many is because they're watching the

566
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,120
birds die that fast and it's scaring the

567
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,159
crap out of everybody it's not like the

568
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,960
birds are sick and you put these birds

569
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,480
over here they're sick maybe these birds

570
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,600
didn't catch the flu yet put them over

571
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,440
here maybe in this you know in this pen

572
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,240
here the birds didn't get it we just

573
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,960
have Birds getting sick in this pen

574
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,279
because they're dropping dead so fast

575
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,480
it's scaring the crap out of people so

576
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,520
they're killing millions and millions

577
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,200
and millions of chickens right now

578
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,200
you're seeing the egg prices go up

579
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,520
you're seeing eggs get scarce and

580
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,640
they're going to get scarcer and

581
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,120
scarcer so the bird flu is interesting

582
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,399
because it is jumping to humans to some

583
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,760
degree but for a bird flu of this

584
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:08,720
magnitude to do damage in a human in a

585
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,279
human which it does when it does get

586
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:17,000
into a human it needs another flu

587
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:18,600
present so it needs two flu right needs

588
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,600
another flu

589
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,600
present so let's see what we got

590
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:29,520
here so you got one

591
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,760
I don't know if you guys could see this

592
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,960
or

593
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:41,600
not got another one okay that's one flu

594
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,080
virus that's the human flu virus right

595
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,399
there then you got the bird flu virus

596
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,399
right

597
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:54,360
there okay so the goal of the evildoers

598
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:56,880
is to make sure the bird flu enters the

599
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,720
body and has a good chance of being in

600
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,320
the body at the same time time whether

601
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,000
or not at the tail end but at the

602
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,279
beginning of a human flu virus in the

603
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,799
same

604
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,799
body this is the

605
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,039
goal you might not be able to see it too

606
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,799
easily there you go how about

607
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,760
that yep there we

608
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,440
are what happens is they Spar for a

609
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,679
little bit that's right they do a little

610
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,679
bit of sparring

611
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:37,039
okay they check each other out they size

612
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,279
each other

613
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:43,840
up they both don't want to

614
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:47,519
die and they both want to challenge and

615
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,519
trick out the human immune

616
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:55,000
system so instead of one killing the

617
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,679
other they

618
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,200
transmute they connect they sequence

619
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,600
because they're all about reproducing

620
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,679
because that's what happens if you get

621
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,080
one flu

622
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:10,360
cell viral cell in

623
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,360
you how does it

624
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,880
work it reproduces

625
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,919
itself to turn into a

626
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,919
thousand to turn into hundreds of

627
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,320
thousands so that when you sneeze you're

628
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:29,240
spreading

629
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:32,159
it it's out there right so it's done

630
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,960
but these two

631
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,720
viruses eventually will bond together so

632
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,679
that's what the evildoers want they want

633
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,279
them to bond together and then

634
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:47,840
sequence what that means is they bond

635
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:50,640
together and they reproduce a hybrid out

636
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,919
of the human flu and the bird

637
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:58,799
flu now that hybrid has information in

638
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:02,039
it to destroy bird flesh

639
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:06,519
to destroy bird flesh bird cells bird

640
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:10,559
brain cells bird nerve cells that's the

641
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:14,159
goal yes of the virus it's been

642
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:18,480
engineered manufactured and raised in

643
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:22,200
eggs to do so and then Place into birds

644
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,120
in labs and they see enough Birds die

645
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,440
they see birds die quick they want like

646
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:33,039
a 90% death rate they want a 90 5% bird

647
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,000
death rate when they see that then they

648
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,960
get it out there they got different

649
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,960
means of getting the bird flu out

650
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:50,399
there different means of doing

651
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:52,679
it so the goal is for people to carry a

652
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,000
bird flu maybe without

653
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,600
knowing and then pick up the flu that's

654
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,240
going around

655
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,880
yeah that they put out there

656
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:09,640
too so they put both of them out

657
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,640
there the goal

658
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,960
is the goal

659
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,679
[Laughter]

660
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,919
is just

661
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:26,679
laughing the goal is to get these two to

662
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,480
se sequence and get them to cause a

663
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:31,399
problem so what happens when the

664
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,200
mutation starts we have a new bug that's

665
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:36,200
the goal the mutation has a really high

666
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,120
rate of killing

667
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,039
people because it's with the human flu

668
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,000
and it's the bird flu put together the

669
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:48,519
ratio of the death rate will most likely

670
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,080
be at 50% that's the goal so if you look

671
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,679
at what 8 billion people on the planet

672
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,559
or don't quote me on the number of the

673
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,760
people on this Earth but say 8 billion

674
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,120
roughly give or take

675
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,320
four billion die that's the goal I'm not

676
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,960
saying it's going to happen and I'm not

677
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:09,159
saying it's happening

678
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,880
now and I'm not saying God won't step in

679
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:16,480
and I'm not saying the Angels won't step

680
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:20,000
in and derail it and I'm not saying the

681
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:25,279
light won't come in and derail it but

682
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,279
that's what they're trying to do right

683
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,279
now pretty crazy crap

684
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,519
so I'm not saying don't eat chicken

685
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:39,320
because I'm a person of vegan nature a

686
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,360
vegan connoisseur plant-based person and

687
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,080
I got all kinds of different propaganda

688
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,320
lined up to try to get you guys to stop

689
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,399
eating chicken you want to eat chicken

690
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,559
eat

691
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,120
chicken but I'm going to go into why we

692
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,519
shouldn't eat chicken so we're going to

693
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:57,279
head into that okay all

694
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,480
right cooking the chicken doesn't help

695
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,000
cook your chicken chicken cook your

696
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:09,240
chicken I'll say that 100 times do not

697
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,320
eat raw chicken do not eat raw chicken

698
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,480
cook your chicken whatever you

699
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:19,480
do Deborah I'm a nurse in hospital are

700
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:23,720
full of influenza A and B by the

701
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,760
way flu a patients right now so Deborah

702
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,799
says she's a nurse and the hospitals are

703
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,880
filled with influenza A

704
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:34,519
Yep they're also filled with B they're

705
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,720
also filled with

706
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:41,480
Co and a few bird

707
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,559
flu they release some bad flu that's why

708
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,880
everybody's sick right now but the

709
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,080
timing is

710
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:52,080
purposeful they released some bad bird

711
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:56,279
flow bird

712
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,159
flu so they released you know more than

713
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:01,919
one it g gives a greater chance for

714
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,760
somebody get to get that bird flu not

715
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,120
just somebody hundreds and hundreds of

716
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,880
people and at the same time getting

717
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,320
hundreds and hundreds of that flu the

718
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,960
human flu the goal is to get those two

719
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,880
to bond and mutate and make a deadly

720
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:22,080
flu people say I can just eat the

721
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,120
chicken and it will be okay how does

722
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,600
that work does it work that way it's

723
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:33,080
like this the more chicken you eat

724
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,240
the more chances you're going to keep

725
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,840
the bird

726
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,159
flu

727
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,480
active strong and

728
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,120
Alive because pretty soon a lot of

729
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:47,080
people are going to have the bird flu

730
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,039
because it's jumping into people you

731
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,559
don't want that chance for it to jump

732
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:55,320
and then proliferate fast and not be

733
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,639
killed off by your immune

734
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,200
system the more bird flu gets around and

735
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:04,000
spreads because it's feeding on chicken

736
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,039
inside people's bodies the more chances

737
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,480
it's going to get stronger and stick

738
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:11,480
around longer to eventually make the

739
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,960
sequence occur between the human flu and

740
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,599
the bird flu cooking the chicken doesn't

741
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,720
stop the problem that has nothing to do

742
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,679
with it this isn't about eating a bad

743
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,359
chicken that happens to have the bird

744
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,919
flu this isn't about

745
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,200
eating a roasted chicken right there

746
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:29,359
like what's sitting there it's a buffalo

747
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,159
chicken when wings or whatever it's not

748
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,760
about eating those and saying well it

749
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,520
was cooked good enough so the virus is

750
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,800
dead it's not what it is I'm not talking

751
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,200
about eating a chicken that has a virus

752
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,040
that's not it at all the flu virus feeds

753
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,839
on chicken flesh the bird flu virus

754
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,200
feeds off of chicken flesh that's why

755
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,040
the chickens are

756
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,040
dying because it attacks every cell in

757
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,359
the chicken and feeds off of it it eats

758
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,839
it so when we have chicken in our livers

759
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,320
Chicken in our bloodstream chicken in

760
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,880
her guts chicken sitting in her colon

761
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,960
for weeks and weeks and weeks for eating

762
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,000
chicken three times a week twice a week

763
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,000
once a week for eating chicken once a

764
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,400
month if you eat chicken once a month

765
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,119
you still have chicken in you that's it

766
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,640
it it's not going to leave you if you

767
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,040
eat chicken once a month just CU you

768
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,599
went to the bathroom and you think you

769
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,839
saw it on the way out doesn't

770
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,160
mean you don't have chicken in your

771
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:28,079
cells and inside your liver and chicken

772
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:31,599
fat inside your body building inside

773
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,680
your body it doesn't work that way so

774
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,839
it's best to be free from chicken for

775
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,320
quite a long time I'm not saying you

776
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,400
can't eat a piece of chicken it's a good

777
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,160
chance sure you'll be fine whatever you

778
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,359
may not get the bird flu but there is

779
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,760
going to be a

780
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,680
mutation it is going to happen at some

781
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,119
point is it going to be a real deadly

782
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,640
deadly one very well could

783
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:59,839
be is is there a possibility it won't be

784
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,760
a real deadly one God intervenes yeah

785
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,400
it's it's very possible but the chicken

786
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,960
that's in your bloodstream and in your

787
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,680
organs because so many people eat

788
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,599
chicken talking about a

789
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:17,200
crop that everybody just eats all the

790
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,800
same it's crazy what's for dinner what's

791
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,319
chicken okay well I'm having some

792
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,640
asparagus but chicken I'm having some

793
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:26,240
broccoli but it's chicken what you have

794
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,680
for lunch Chicken on salad chicken salad

795
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,960
you got chicken on your pizza heads it

796
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,960
Chicken on my

797
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,160
pizza anyway but the point is is that

798
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,880
what people don't realize is everybody

799
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,800
should stop eating chicken right now

800
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,960
every single person should stop it's

801
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,680
critical because a they're not going to

802
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,240
stop no one's going to stop how many

803
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,599
people are going to see this not

804
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,800
probably the whole world isn't going to

805
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,640
see this although the medical meem

806
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,640
podcast reached a lot of people so the

807
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,839
bird flu episode of the medical medum

808
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:02,599
podcast reached a trrap ton of people

809
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,560
around the world and that is still being

810
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,760
listened to right now every single day

811
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,440
every hour right now that one that one

812
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,800
did really crazy out

813
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:18,560
there all right so let's just let's just

814
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:20,200
do a quick little um run through okay

815
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,800
there's a bird flu released by The

816
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,760
evildoers classified medical research

817
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,040
and science they put the bird flu out

818
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,920
there various different ways of

819
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,599
contamination so Birds would get it

820
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,359
birds Don't naturally get the bird flu

821
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,400
it's impossible it's not possible for a

822
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,160
bird to get the bird flu a bird can't

823
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,640
just come down with the flu but for some

824
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,359
reason they figured out ways of putting

825
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,119
it out there drones drones nobody knew

826
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,520
what the drones are

827
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,400
for and they got it out there somehow

828
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,319
whatever it is it's out there birds are

829
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,079
getting it wild birds are dying all the

830
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:52,720
time right now in massive droves and

831
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,079
crops everywhere from both the crops of

832
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,240
birds and Agland that are happening like

833
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,839
the poultry and so forth the foul all

834
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,760
that turkeys included are all dying out

835
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,440
there but wild birds are dying like

836
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,960
Robins crows and other birds

837
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,760
too pretty soon at this rate the bird

838
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,480
flu is taking over the planet there's a

839
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,400
good chance if God doesn't intervene or

840
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,599
it doesn't stop at some point in 3 to 5

841
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,800
years all birds can be gone yes all

842
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,200
birds can be gone on the

843
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,640
planet all birds

844
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,839
gone evildoers are putting the bird flu

845
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,400
out there because they know it'll jump

846
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,280
to humans they've actually designed it

847
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,720
to have the ability to jump to a human

848
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,800
even though it's not the normal process

849
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,480
in which that virus works but people are

850
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,079
getting that virus evildoers put out the

851
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,440
other flu that's out there now there's a

852
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,480
reason why hospitals are filled with

853
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,760
that flu the timing is actually lined up

854
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,280
perfectly that's what the evildoers did

855
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,280
they put the bird flu out there they put

856
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,119
the regular flu out there the human flu

857
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,440
because there's a fantastic chance

858
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,359
someone with the human flu is going to

859
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,440
get the bird flu here and there and

860
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,040
everywhere including yes men and women

861
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,240
women working at bird

862
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,560
factories chicken

863
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,480
factories egg

864
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,200
factories those people pick it up first

865
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,800
they end up picking up the bird flu from

866
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,040
the birds then they pick up the human

867
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,640
flu and they know that the amount of

868
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,160
chicken factories around the world and

869
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,560
bird factories around the world they

870
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,359
know there's going to be an incredible

871
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,280
chance for that to happen from the

872
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,599
workers working in these places that

873
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,040
they're going to eventually pick up the

874
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,839
human flu

875
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,359
somewhere and they're going to pick up

876
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,920
that human flu and they're going to pick

877
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,200
up the bird flu at the same time and

878
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,760
those are going to be the first people

879
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,800
sending out the mutations it's going to

880
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,520
be the people working in the bird

881
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,119
factories in the chicken factories and

882
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,040
so forth hen houses and everything else

883
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,720
for egg production and everything else

884
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,440
those people are going to go out one

885
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,119
night to a bar whatever they going to do

886
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,599
on Friday night they're going to pick up

887
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,160
the influenza that's actually going

888
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,920
around right now then they're going to

889
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,200
go back to work on Monday and they're

890
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,400
going to pick up the bird flu and

891
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,720
they're going to have both those flu

892
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,680
inside of them and evildoers know this

893
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,000
eventually a mutation is going to be

894
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,640
sprung because both these viruses don't

895
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,800
want to kill themselves they want to

896
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,560
work together so they Spar they learn

897
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,000
about each other and then boom they

898
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,839
sequence when they

899
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,240
sequence that's when the mess happens

900
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:18,680
they create a virus that a wants to kill

901
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,160
every chicken and bird there is in the

902
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,560
world and now wants to kill humans more

903
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,040
than ever before so now the flu becomes

904
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,520
something different between the bird flu

905
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,400
and that flu put together it becomes a

906
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:36,960
bug that wants to kill people at

907
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,960
probably a 50% die off

908
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,800
rate that's the goal and that's what

909
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,720
they're doing what I recommend is stop

910
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,760
eating chicken completely stop I think

911
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,880
everyone on the planet should stop

912
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:58,040
eating turkeys and chickens and quails

913
00:40:51,880 --> 00:41:00,079
and pheasants and Ducks who eats ducks

914
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:04,160
you always find somebody in a restaurant

915
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,160
fine dining like I'll have the

916
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,079
duck and yes there are some people that

917
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:14,119
have contracted the bird flu like I said

918
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,640
before already and you just got to line

919
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,200
it up just right what I'm talking about

920
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,000
is the mutation that is coming not the

921
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,000
bird flu that's out there in the moment

922
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,839
but the mutation between the bird flu

923
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,440
and the human flu and that mutation and

924
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:29,000
what's coming now there's a chance that

925
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,200
not come and there's a chance that it

926
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,400
just might not happen and I would say

927
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,400
for sure that's God's

928
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,160
intervention but it could happen still

929
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,200
all the same the reason why you want to

930
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,839
stop eating chicken or any kind of birds

931
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,720
is because you don't want that inside

932
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,720
your cells you don't want chicken in

933
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,640
your cells yes it doesn't just go in

934
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,200
your mouth and your stomach down your

935
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,920
dadum and your small intestinal tract

936
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,800
your colon and out the other end and

937
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,480
it's

938
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,839
gone it actually sits in your body it

939
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,960
takes months to get get it out months

940
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:03,520
you should do a cleanse maybe go to Cafe

941
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,240
Gratitude do a wellness reset cleanse

942
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,200
maybe pick up a medical medium book do

943
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,400
one of those cleanses 369 and get the

944
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,119
chicken out of your bloodstream get it

945
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,920
out of your liver get it out of your

946
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,560
cells get it out of your

947
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,520
bones so that you're free from that

948
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,160
being in you and the best thing could

949
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,680
have ever ever happened right now is

950
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,520
eggs being scarce and egg prices going

951
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,119
up unless it's the only food you can eat

952
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,880
for some reason cuz you have a medical

953
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:31,920
condition and so all you can eat is eggs

954
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,319
Blended in a blender or something like

955
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,000
that but the point is is it's a good

956
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:40,800
thing eggs are getting

957
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,880
scarcer and it's hard to get

958
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,000
eggs because nobody should be eating

959
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,960
eggs or chicken right now because of

960
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,119
what the plan is and what they're

961
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,680
doing and if you think it sounds crazy

962
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:53,280
or anything like okay good just think of

963
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,559
it as just a fun story we're just having

964
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,559
fun today that's fine with me

965
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,119
anyway so what I recommend is get rid of

966
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,880
the

967
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:05,880
chicken so here's how it

968
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,839
works you guys like my art

969
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:31,160
skills I'm an artist

970
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:32,839
here's how it works you eat the

971
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,680
chicken

972
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:37,760
okay some of the chicken fat gets

973
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,920
absorbed through the mouth yeah believe

974
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,440
it or not lots of different chemicals

975
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,280
and hormones in the chicken you don't

976
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,240
eat chicken with hormones but yes you do

977
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,800
every single chicken has hormones in it

978
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,640
every single chicken does hormones get

979
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,440
absorbed into your

980
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,760
mouth from eating the chicken already

981
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,440
you got the hormones what the bird flu

982
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,160
loves is the hormones now actually

983
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,160
occurring hormones in organic chicken

984
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,160
whatever free range chicken it's one

985
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,200
thing that occurs the virus will feed

986
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,200
off those hormones you swallow the

987
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,920
chicken it's in your stomach right

988
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,720
now okay your HCL is breaking it apart

989
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,520
starting to dissolve and break the

990
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,680
proteins down cuz that's what your HCL

991
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,200
does if you got strong HCL if you don't

992
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,040
the proteins just sit there rot in your

993
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,440
gut and then you're fermenting got

994
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,760
fermented putrified chicken carcass in

995
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,040
your gut and that's what's happening

996
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,599
this isn't vegan propag has nothing to

997
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,559
do with that I would if you're somebody

998
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,319
that's eating chick chicken all the time

999
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,200
and you need you you feel like you need

1000
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:41,319
an animal protein to move on to beef

1001
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,480
grass-fed beef that flu virus that bird

1002
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:46,800
flu virus doesn't want

1003
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,119
beef chicken's in here and it breaks

1004
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,960
down it starts breaking down okay and

1005
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,280
then it moves down the dadum into the

1006
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,319
small intestinal tract and breaks down

1007
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:01,119
even more and then

1008
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:02,559
that chicken part of it Li liquifies

1009
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,160
gets into the liver through the paddock

1010
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,800
portal Highway goes right up into the

1011
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,520
liver right here and it sits in the

1012
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:15,040
liver fat from the chicken is dispersed

1013
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:16,920
by guess what your bile reserves your

1014
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,599
bile actually starts to break down the

1015
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:22,920
fats and disperses the fats that goes

1016
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,280
all through the body gets into the

1017
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,240
liver and then gets through into

1018
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,640
everywhere else as well so so when

1019
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,359
you're when you're sitting there and you

1020
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,440
got chicken now inside your gut and it's

1021
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,839
being dissolved by your gastric juices

1022
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,559
and dissolved by your

1023
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:45,559
bile it ends up everywhere in your body

1024
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:48,680
your brain your nervous system something

1025
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:51,480
from that chicken ends up somewhere

1026
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:54,960
everywhere your bone marrow your liver

1027
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,960
and it takes time to get it

1028
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:03,800
out when the day comes that these two

1029
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:06,760
viruses become one and mutate and we

1030
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:10,480
have a deadly bird

1031
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,480
flu you're going to

1032
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:15,440
want you

1033
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,000
know I think we have a tech problem with

1034
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,400
Tik Tock I think they boot at me

1035
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,520
again you're going to want chicken out

1036
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,520
of your body you'll have the greatest

1037
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,640
chance to push that virus out of your

1038
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,520
body the greatest chance and you'll have

1039
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,920
a

1040
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:39,440
survival opportunity as

1041
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,960
well the evildoers are relying on the

1042
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,280
amount of chicken people eat the amount

1043
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,480
of chicken people eat we guarantee that

1044
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,640
the virus will be even more hungrier and

1045
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,640
deadlier and cause more

1046
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,720
damage anyway

1047
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,839
so

1048
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,640
you guys got to watch this from the

1049
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:40,160
beginning definitely have to watch it

1050
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:44,440
from the beginning without a doubt

1051
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,440
okay and I think the phone is

1052
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,119
ringing um

1053
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,079
but anyway about the bird flu and stuff

1054
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,960
that's only if the viruses mutate like I

1055
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:19,200
said God's intervention will definitely

1056
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,520
kick in and it's probably not going to

1057
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,119
happen but I'm just saying that's how it

1058
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,240
works with the bird flu talked about it

1059
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,240

know as far as what people have to you

1086
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,319
have to understand something about the

1087
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,440
chicken and everything else you keep it

1088
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:09,880
away and that literally right there

1089
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,920

saw somebody saying ah it's vegan

1100
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:39,000

hope nothing happens and that's the

1105
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,839
whole point there's a good chance it

1107
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,760

00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,839

before the covid pandemic I talked about

1221
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,119
long flu and how it works you get the

1222
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,039
flu and then the flu lowers the immune

1223
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:00,079
system and the immune system

1224
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:02,240
system gets dropped and then it allows

1225
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:06,520
EP bars and all these other things just

1226
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,520

just want to say okay Charlie said that

1404
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,240
I didn't give Charlie any chance to talk

1405
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:48,480
at all

1406
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:50,680

1407
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,680

01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,760
here just waiting for Dr n to call right

1411
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,200
here Charlie I haven't been able to say

1412
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,440
a lot of things that you're saying

1413
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,920
because a lot of the things you're

1414
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,160
saying are just quite crazy you're

1415
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,079
talking about Donnie the donkey and

1416
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:28,839
you're talking talking about Piggy and

1417
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:30,520
you're talking about all the crazy stuff

1418
01:07:28,839 --> 01:07:32,079
that happens between Donnie the donkey

1419
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,760
and piggy because you hang out with them

1420
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,000
and Dr nbut doesn't hang out with them

1421
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,599
anymore because he's doing too many

1422
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,960
surgeries so I understand that so what

1423
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:43,200
do you want to say about

1424
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:47,240
piggy piggy poos

1425
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:49,520
everywhere even in your your house so

1426
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:51,200
piggy comes and poos right on the floor

1427
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,559
and then then

1428
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:56,520
what you have to ask for help to clean

1429
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:57,920
it up okay okay you wanted to tell them

1430
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,839
that that's what you really wanted to

1431
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,640
say and that's why Dr Nesbit might be a

1432
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:06,960
better fit he has to get better from the

1433
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:11,200
bird flu what else and Donnie the

1434
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,520
donkey he overeats really and he threw

1435
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,039
up in the car

1436
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:17,679
again Don donkey threw up in the car

1437
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,640
again and piggy poops all over the floor

1438
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:21,600
at Charlie's house so Charlie just

1439
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,239
wanted that across because Charlie's

1440
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:27,239
hoping to embarrass them to get them

1441
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:27,239
back

1442
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:35,719

1443
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:36,719
