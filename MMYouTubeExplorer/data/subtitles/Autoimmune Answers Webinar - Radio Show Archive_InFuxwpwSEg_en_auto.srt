00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,759
hello it's Anthony William medical

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,000
medium great to be here at autoimmune

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,360
answers live webinar and uh thank you

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,080
for being here uh absolutely this is

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,480
really exciting it's important because

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,400
when it comes down to our health there's

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,560
some pitfalls and things in our way

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,599
barriers and other things that if we

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,400
don't learn about it's hard to get past

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,519
our conditions or symptoms or illnesses

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,119
so when it comes to Healing information

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,160
means everything now the information

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,640
you're going to learn on the webinar and

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,000
and you know our future webinars and uh

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,440
the webinars of the past the information

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,920
you're going to learn it's it's

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,640
important to know where it's coming from

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,879
it's coming from a Pure untampered

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,440
Source a clean source and if you're

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,960
someone who just you know you never knew

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,079
who I was or you don't know my story or

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,879
history um what that means is is that I

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,120
was given a gift since childhood start

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,680
started with the age four at age four

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,119
and I was given a gift to hear a voice

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,080
perfectly clear to provide a clean

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,960
source of information help out people

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,799
have dedicated my entire life to decades

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,600
and decades now to helping people heal

30
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,280
um and overcome their illnesses and get

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,479
the answers they need and I'm saying

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,920
this because it's important to

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,040
understand the information here doesn't

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,600
come from interest groups or medical

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,119
funding with strings attached or botched

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,759
research with lobbyists medical

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,880
lobbyists inter Al Kickbacks persuaded

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,759
belief systems persuaded belief systems

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,479
that's serious private panels of

40
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,079
influencers that no one knows about in

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,680
the world of medicine I'm talking about

42
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,960
Alternative Health and health field

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,000
payoffs both of conventional alternative

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,719
medicine or trendy traps you know when

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
when you deal with fads and trends that

46
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,840
that are out there but they're really

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,119
sand traps and I'm saying this because

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,799
it's important to know that the

49
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,840
information we're going to cover is not

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,320
involved in any any of that it's a clear

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,960
clean source of information and why is

52
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,360
this important because I'll tell you why

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,879
because when and this is you always have

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,800
to know this the one of the reasons why

55
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,120
we're not healing and and why there's

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,680
hundreds of millions of sick people

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,160
billions of sick people on planet Earth

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,519
right now is because we're kept from

59
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,760
knowing about certain truths because

60
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,120
there's a reason for that there's a big

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,640
reason for that and I'm going to cover

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,040
and to go into it a lot deeper and when

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,720
science and research does their studies

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,800
both alternative and conventional

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,680
conventionally there's funding and money

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,640
behind it and they have to come out and

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,800
in many ways the studies have to land a

68
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,000
certain way they have to land on all

69
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,519
four feet and there and many times

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,840
there's a thumb on the scale if you know

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,640
what I mean if you know what I'm talking

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,959
about that thumb on the scale because

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,319
you don't want to piss off an interest

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,080
group or somebody's interest somebody's

75
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,599
money that went was funded into

76
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,840
something and you want to make sure

77
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,959
outcomes come out the way they're

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,080
intended to come out regardless if it's

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,799
good for you or bad for you and that's

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,920
the problem even the truths that we have

81
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,000
from leading experts right now the

82
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,560
information's tampered it's tainted so

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,799
even good-hearted good-hearted really

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,680
amazing you know immunologists and and

85
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,959
every and different people in the field

86
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,080
of medicine whether it's oncologist when

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,799
it comes down to can or or you know our

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,640
science and research are best people

89
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,200
their hearts in it and our doctor's

90
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,760
hearts are in it and we have some

91
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,760
amazing things scientifically uh you

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,519
know discovered now that are helping

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,040
people but when it comes down to chronic

94
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,720
illness it's separated I'm going to tell

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,159
you right now it's it's an entirely

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,840
different situation and when it comes

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,760
down to autoimmune autoimmune disease

98
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,239
autoimmune symptoms and conditions and

99
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,319
the whole term autoimmune when it comes

100
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,480
down to that that's a whole different

101
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,519
ballpark from heart surgery that's a

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,920
whole different ballpark from you know

103
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,280
science and research in so many

104
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,079
different fields of medicine that are

105
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,400
doing incredible things that we that we

106
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:16,000
rely on that we love that we need and

107
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,560
but there's there's two two You Know

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,359
Places there's two places one place is

109
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,840
chronic illness and we don't have

110
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,000
answers we don't one place is chronic

111
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,880
illness the other place is you know uh

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,479
black and white black and white medicine

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,320
science and research where it's black

114
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,960
and white where we rely on so much of

115
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,039
that so and the bottom line is when it

116
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,120
comes down to chronic illness and

117
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,919
autoimmune and all the different labels

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,360
that's a different story that's where

119
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:49,520
we're in the dark and the information

120
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,680
that is out there is contaminated most

121
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,600
of the information out there is

122
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,759
contaminated now ho ho ho how can I say

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,320
that that's a big deal to say it's just

124
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,919
the truth and I'm going to cover why

125
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,240
it's the truth and how it works and how

126
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,639
we can protect you that's the whole

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,160
point you know when I was given the gift

128
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,479
to have this clean source of information

129
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,840
a source that isn't persuaded by all the

130
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,880
things I just talked about right there

131
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,880
and and that's real that stuff I just

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,120
talked about everything I mentioned is

133
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,800
in alternative and conventional medicine

134
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,319
both you may say well it's not in

135
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,080
alternative medicine that's he's talking

136
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,880
about conventional medicine where you

137
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,800
got the internal Kickbacks and you know

138
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,800

attached and everything else that must

142
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,759
be conventional he's talking about no

143
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm talking about alternative to

144
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:44,319
absolutely in both fields of medicine

145
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,080
when it comes down to chronic illness

146
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,440
chronic illness autoimmune chronic

147
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,600
illness and

148
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,080
autoimmune so and and that we're going

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,440
to we're going to go into all of it now

150
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,520
I really mean it when I say fasten your

151
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,680
seat bels because this is going to be a

152
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,840
ride um so let's get into it so

153
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,960
get ready cuz we're starting now and

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,039
we're going now if you you know if you

155
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,479
live in an apartment you or House or

156
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,759
wherever you live kak condo apartment

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,479
house everybody lives in different

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,800
places some people just live over you

159
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,680
know they live in their their their you

160
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,360
know sisters or brothers basement they

161
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,639
live wherever they can live you know

162
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,240
wherever we

163
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,000
live and um or our friend's house or

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,000
wherever we live and live our life if

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,560
paint was starting to flake off the

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,599
walls okay just for some strange reason

167
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,599
you know the paint's recent it's meaning

168
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,560
the paint is not old it's a new paint

169
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:47,160
but it's starting to flake off the

170
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,880
walls and and you call a carpenter and

171
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,880
the carpenter comes he says I don't know

172
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,800
I don't know why that that paint is

173
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,120
flaking off the walls there and then all

174
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,000
of a sudden say your ceiling started

175
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,400
leaking and it was leaking water

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,960
but there was no really answer to it

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,000
because all the piping and all the

178
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,199
plumbing seemed fine and it was just

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,240
okay the plumbing was fine everything

180
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,960
was good but the leak was just always

181
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,960
there seeping through the

182
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,319
ceiling and then the

183
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,919
floors the floors started to get weird

184
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,800
where they're starting to move a little

185
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,680
and the floors were moving because you

186
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,919
know it was just kind of

187
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,919
crumbling so the apartment you're living

188
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,639
in or the house you're living in was

189
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,800
kind of falling apart when it's not

190
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,720
supposed to be and you got your your

191
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,080
Carpenter or contractor whoever in there

192
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,479
and they're in there and they're looking

193
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,199
at it and they don't know

194
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,159
why because it's kind of a mystery it's

195
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,319
it's a it's it's a serious mystery

196
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,120
because we can't find the water leak so

197
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,280
there's no plumbing leaking but yet you

198
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,960
got water seeping through the

199
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,759
ceiling the floors are crumbling

200
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,960
but everything seems to be sturdy

201
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
underneath there and there's no reason

202
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,599
why the floor should be

203
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,120
crumbling the walls the paint is flaking

204
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,120
off the

205
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,360
walls now if the landlord if you're

206
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,599
renting and the landlord said look I

207
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,280
don't know what this is this is a

208
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,759
mystery I don't understand what's

209
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,639
happening you got to be doing something

210
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,800
wrong so you're living in here what are

211
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,720
you doing that's making this happen what

212
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,440
are you doing that's making the paint

213
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,519
flake off the

214
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,719
walls because I don't know why it's

215
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,120
flaking off the walls so obviously

216
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,640
there's something you're doing I've

217
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,080
never seen this before so a landlord

218
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,720
would be saying I've never seen this

219
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,440
before I've had lots of apartment

220
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,640
buildings and I've never seen this

221
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,760
happen it's got to be something you're

222
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,120
doing and I'll call the carpenter

223
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,160
carpenter came down there I says yeah I

224
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,839
agree there's no there's no leaks the

225
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,480
plumber says there's no leaks leaks the

226
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,320
piping looks good but the ceiling's

227
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,040
getting wet it's got to be your

228
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,000
fault and whether you live in a home or

229
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,920
an apartment it's your fault that this

230
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,200
is

231
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,680
happening now would that make a lot of

232
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,240
sense would that make a lot of

233
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,519
sense well they don't know what's wrong

234
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,480
they don't know what's wrong or what's

235
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,160
going on with your house or your your

236
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,079
apartment or where you're

237
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,160
living so would it be right if it was

238
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:33,399
blamed on you if it's a mystery leak if

239
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,440
it's a mystery

240
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:39,079
problem but that's what's happening with

241
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,760
autoimmune you start getting

242
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:44,360
symptoms and you can't figure it out you

243
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,240
got a mystery rash you got mystery

244
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,760
symptoms you got mystery

245
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,279
fatigue mystery

246
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,600
dizziness and mystery

247
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,240
inflammation well it's got to be it's

248
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,800
got to be something going on with your

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,360
body it's got to be you and you're going

250
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,680
to be saying well hey it's not my fault

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,320
I'm not doing anything to create my

252
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,720
sickness I don't think I'm living my

253
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,399
life and I just started getting sick

254
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,800
things started

255
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,839
happening but when we have

256
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,800
autoimmune we get told something we get

257
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,800
told our body is attacking

258
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,440
itself that our body is attacking

259
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:29,519
itself that's what we get

260
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,720
told so it becomes our fault so miss

261
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,320
conditions that happen in our health

262
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,839
that happened in your health it happened

263
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,600
in your life are they're your

264
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,480
fault it's your body's fault that's what

265
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,399
we're

266
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:48,920
told and here we are come on now I mean

267
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,720
look what year it is look how far we are

268
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,000
and look where science and research is

269
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,920
look at the technology that's out

270
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,519
there and the best the best that can

271
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,240
come out right now the best that can

272
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,680
come out right now in

273
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,560
medicine your body is still attacking

274
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,120
itself so autoimmune we're told

275
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,639
autoimmune means our body is destroying

276
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,639
itself it's going after

277
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:17,399
itself our B's targeting

278
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,079
us and that's autoimmune and that's

279
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,600
where we are today and you have to think

280
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,399
about that I mean is that where you want

281
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,720
to be is that where you want to be in

282
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,279
your life you want to know your body's

283
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,959
attacking itself whether it comes down

284
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,639
to

285
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,720
Hashimoto's we're told our body is

286
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,000
targeting our thyroid

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,680
tissue so our immune system is screening

288
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,200
antibodies antibodies are actually going

289
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,560
after our tissue and destroying our

290
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,680
cells and destroying our our

291
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,720
thyroid our immune system is basically

292
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,320
going after and targeting our

293
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,959
thyroid when it comes down to

294
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:56,160
Hashimoto is that where you want to be

295
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,320
because it's not the truth by the way

296
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,920
that's not the

297
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,800
truth and it's like that that with exmos

298
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,040
orasis it's like that too the body's not

299
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,079
attacking the body's not attacking the

300
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,839
skin even though the Skin's inflamed the

301
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,880
body's not turning against the skin but

302
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,800
we're told that systemic

303
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,440
lupus we're inflamed throughout the body

304
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,399
mysteriously inflamed throughout the

305
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,360
body we're told our body's attacking

306
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,839
itself that's what lupus is it's an

307
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,199
autoimmune problem and we're going to

308
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,360
cover a whole bunch of different things

309
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,680
whole bunch of different illnesses and

310
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,399
autoimmune this is as we're in

311
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,240
here cuz this is a big deal look I take

312
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,959
this serious I take autoimmune so

313
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,320
serious it's it's it's I mean I really

314
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,480
really really take it to heart I take it

315
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,760
personally I take it

316
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,560
seriously when it comes to Healing our

317
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,199
health I'm going to tell you right now

318
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,320
that if you believe your body is

319
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:56,120
attacking

320
00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,360
itself you got a barrier in your way a

321
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:03,120
major barrier in your way

322
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,680
a huge barrier in your way so when it

323
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,800
comes to our healing our health I'm

324
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,880
going to tell you right now and if you

325
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,560
believe your body is attacking itself on

326
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,880
any level and there's no

327
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,000
cure it's a huge

328
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,320
barrier we can talk to the leading

329
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,160
experts and they say well there's no

330
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,399
cure to autoimmune we can just control

331
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,040
it there's no cure to autoimmune that's

332
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,480
not true the problem is nobody knows

333
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,000
what autoimmune is they don't know what

334
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,279
it's caused they don't know what these

335
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,880
symptoms and conditions and these labels

336
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,480
that are given to

337
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,880
people

338
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:46,079
ra you know systemic lupus Ms Celiac fgo

339
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,480
alcia psoriasis colitis Hashimoto

340
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:53,040
Addison's Graves disease Su disease type

341
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,079
1 diabetes hepatitis A B C

342
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,360
D sertic

343
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,800
arthritis and it goes on and on

344
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,160
they don't know what's causing those

345
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,000
conditions those conditions get

346
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,600
labels because of the different symptoms

347
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,079
and the different you know things that

348
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:15,600
people are going through they get

349
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:18,360
labels but it's all a mystery complete

350
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,360
mystery so what science and research

351
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,839
chalks it up to when it comes down to

352
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,800
Healing your health it's your body

353
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,079
attacking itself and that's what it is

354
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,120
and there's no cure and that's where we

355
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,639
are right now in this time in history

356
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,839
when you would think we would be so far

357
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,040
along and so further into healing than

358
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,680
ever

359
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,320
before and we're not I was told by my

360
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,680
source when I was a child that you're

361
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,959
going to see some things

362
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,320
happen and I said what does that mean

363
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,800
and spirit said you're going to see some

364
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,800
things happening I said what spirit says

365
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,160
you're going to see people getting

366
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,240
sicker and sicker and sicker and and and

367
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,839
I'll tell you right now when I look back

368
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,160
from Child childhood to now it's

369
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,320
unbelievable of what's

370
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,440
happening and how many people are

371
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,920
suffering from symptoms if you look at

372
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,320
how many people are in the US alone just

373
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,920
say three roughly 325 million or

374
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,480
whatever it is 325 million people in the

375
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,920
US alone

376
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,600
280 of them are dealing with real

377
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,199
symptoms and

378
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,639
conditions 20 million more are dealing

379
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,079
with some kind of symptom that's also a

380
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,920
mystery there's virtually 10 or 20

381
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:39,399
million people only in the

382
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,240
US that are not seeing too many symptoms

383
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,720
meaning symptoms that come and go here

384
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,440
and there depending on what it is and

385
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,399
really have okay enough Health we are at

386
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,079
a place and time that's unbelievable in

387
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,639
history never

388
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,240
before and one of the biggest problems

389
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,199
and one of the biggest barriers in the

390
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,440
way is it's all going to be chalked up

391
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,920
to autoimmune one way or another that's

392
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,199
where it's going to be chalked up to and

393
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,160
it's going to be

394
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,680
also right in front of everybody where

395
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,639
it's your body's fault it's your body's

396
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,440
fault your body's letting you down it's

397
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,880
your fault that's what's going wrong

398
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,360
that's what's happening your body is

399
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,759
destroying itself so when it comes down

400
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,360
to our healing and our health I'm going

401
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,560
to tell you right now if you believe

402
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,199
your body's attacking itself and there's

403
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,040
no cure that's a massive barrier in your

404
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,680
way we're going to crush that barrier

405
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
destroy that barrier we're going to

406
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,800
knock it down we're going to push it

407
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
down in the ground we're going to clear

408
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,480
the way for you because if we don't

409
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,880
clear the way for

410
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,759
you whether you're getting benefits or

411
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,360
not from from an expert anywhere or

412
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,480
whatever it's still going to be in the

413
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,240
back of your mind and it becomes poison

414
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm going to tell you right now that

415
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,279
it's poison and it's injected into our

416
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,000
thinking into our thoughts into our

417
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,920
beings into our

418
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,919
Souls is what it

419
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:10,559
is we live inside our body just like

420
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,959
when we live inside our apartment or our

421
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,799
house you have to understand something

422
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,480
when you're living in your house and

423
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,120
paint's peeling off the walls and

424
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,079
leaking ceilings are happening and

425
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,640
there's no real answers and you're stuck

426
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,400
inside of it and someone's telling you

427
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,600
that it's your fault or it's your your

428
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,919

answers then that's bad enough but see

432
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,799
when it's our body itself and our soul

433
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:49,360

495
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,679
information is out there and it is

496
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,440
poison and it seeps into us when we deal

497
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,280
with anything autoimmune the term

498
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,799
autoimmune itself is that poisonous

499
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,159
because it means turning against you

500
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,480

experts in the in the health world and

508
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,039
books and internet and everything else

509
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,600
that autoimmune is still attacking still

510
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,240
autoimmune is still you know your body

511
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,080

what I'm telling you and that's the

517
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,919
difference right there in what I meant

518
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,240
at the beginning no interest groups and

519
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,799
medical funding with strings attached

520
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,520
and everything else of Bot research and

521
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,000
kickbacks and persuaded beliefs systems

522
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,520
I meant it because what I'm trying to

523
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,600
tell you guys right now is that is

524
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,720

everything including thyroid and

527
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,080
everything else and it is Tainted it

528
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,559
whether the practitioner or the doctor

529
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,360
or the good-hearted person knows about

530
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,080
it and I get that I get that you know we

531
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,640
only can do what we can do but I'm

532
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,799

533
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,799

for now if you know the truth if you

538
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,480
know the truth and your body isn't

539
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,039
attacking itself if you know the truth

540
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,880
it's attacking something else your body

541
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,480
is attacking something else it's not

542
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,200

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,559
your glands it's not attacking your skin

544
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,840
it's not attacking your body if it's

00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,760
body you will have the greatest chance

547
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:04,279
of of really healing the barrier starts

548
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:07,200
to come down the barrier starts to break

549
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:09,799
down the barrier the barrier that's been

550
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,120
put in our way back in the

551
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:17,039
1950s put in our way in the

552
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,840
1950s that's the barrier that was set up

553
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,799
old grandfathered law the barrier of

554
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,640
your body attacking itself because signs

555
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,320
and research still isn't up to par on

556
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,760
what causes your symptoms and conditions

557
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,520
you guys because science and research is

558
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,360
not up to level to what's happening and

559
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,400
why you feel like you do and why you

560
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,440
have those pains and why you have that

561
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,320
fatigue and why your Skin's inflamed and

562
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,480
why you have the butterfly rash and why

563
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,720
your thyroids inflamed thyroiditis and

564
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,480
everything

565
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,760
else because science and research isn't

566
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,440
there yet at

567
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,440
all it's grandfather in and rooted to

568
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,400
these old thought processes that get in

569
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,400
your way because funding when into them

570
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,320
at the time and no one wants to break it

571
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,360
it's like estate planning it's like

572
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,760
trusts it's like the trust you can't

573
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,679
break

574
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,799
it it's like massive corporate trusts

575
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,760
and different things in that category

576
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:17,080
you can't break them they're written in

577
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,720
papers those papers are in vaults vaults

578
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:24,000
those papers are protected and a lot of

579
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,039
these old laws in the medical field have

580
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,440
to be passed on even to your greatest

581
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:30,360
expert that's alternative right now that

582
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,600
he or she still has to believe the body

583
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,159
is attacking itself because it's it's

584
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,880
grandfathered in with trust it's

585
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,919
grandfathered in back in the 50s or 60s

586
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
or 70s and it can't be broken because

587
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,039
interest groups paid for it they paid

588
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,799
for

589
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,559
it I'm telling you how it

590
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,600
works so then you carry the poison and

591
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,919
your children carry the poison so when

592
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,120
your child has a thyroid problem that's

593
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:00,880
your child's body attacking itself

594
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:04,080
that's how poison this is it's it's it's

595
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,200
dark it's dark just going to say it I

596
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,720
told you to fasten your seat pulse

597
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,960
today

598
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,400
and so you need to know to protect your

599
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,520
children your

600
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,600
children to know that it's not your body

601
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,640
attacking

602
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,039
itself and it's so incredibly important

603
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,360
and to know that labels are just

604
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,080
names they might make us feel a little

605
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,760
better they might give us identification

606
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,880
so we can you know we could if we we

607
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,720
need disability we got a name that the

608
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,520
insurance company will accept all that's

609
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,760
important but the label still don't cut

610
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,039
it they don't cut it as far as knowing

611
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,799
what's going on and what's wrong but if

612
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,360
you know the truth and your body is not

613
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,039
attacking itself and not destroying

614
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,200
itself your body is not going after your

615
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,520
thyroid it's attacking something else

616
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,720
something else it's going after

617
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,320
something else in your

618
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:00,120
body if you know

619
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,919
this you just took it to a new level

620
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,799
you're extracting that poisonous

621
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,159
grandfathered law that sits in there

622
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,720
that sits in there to take you down

623
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,320
because I'm going to tell you right now

624
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,960
because research and science doesn't

625
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:18,000
know what's going on with your health

626
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,240
deep inside with your bodies it's better

627
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,919
to blame it on you it's not good to

628
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,360
blame it on research and science we're

629
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,840
not allowed to do that you're not

630
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,159
allowed to blame it on research and

631
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:32,080
science not at all not at all

632
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,919

633
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,919

the Fall Guy you got to be the one your

635

children have to be the ones that take

636
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,360
the hit they have to be the ones because

637
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,200
research and science don't know what's

638
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,880
going

639
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,000

640
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,960
your fault so hey when you have a

641
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,520

office it's your

644
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,840
fault whether you know that consciously

645
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,120
or not in the moment it is going to be

646
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,120
subconsciously in there and creep out

647
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,960
and creep out over time and then you're

648
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,840
going to be like what is my body doing

649
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,679

got whatever it is you got going

688
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:46,960
on there's a real cause to why it's

689
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,000
happening there's a real cause there's

690
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,799
something really going on there now

691
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,360
here's the next level if you know that

692
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,279
your body is not only not only loves you

693
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,640
and is on your side and is working for

694
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,760
you and is there for you and is is

695
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,880
working hard and not giving up on you

696
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,159
and is connected to you and connected to

697
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,720
God and connected to everything and your

698
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,720
body's there and it's after something

699
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,840
else though it's after an Invader it's

700
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,039
after an Invader because here's what

701
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,399
autoimmune really is it's something

702
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:19,440
that's in our system that invaded our

703
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,559
system that our bodies out to destroy

704
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,840
and out to kick its butt and out to move

705
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,440
it out of the body and that's what's

706
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,200
going on and it takes it to a new

707
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,559
level

708
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:35,279
so when it comes down to lupus for

709
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:38,159
example lupus is a viral Condition it's

710
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,600
a virus the body's not attacking itself

711
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,880
the body's not going after itself the

712
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,320
body's not attacking kidneys it's not

713
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,799
attacking any part of the

714
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,919
body it's a viral Condition it's a virus

715
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,000
that wants to attack a kidney or the

716
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:56,360
virus that wants to attack tissue it's a

717
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,279
virus that causes the trouble it's a

718
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,880
virus that

719
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:04,720
that actually eliminates poison too so

720
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,320
it eliminates poison it creates poison

721
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,960
it's a virus that causes the attacking

722
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,880
now you might think that's scary but

723
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,799
it's not scary I'm going to tell you why

724
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,919
because when you know you got an

725
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,919
unwanted house guest that your body's

726
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,120
kicking

727
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,080
out it's a whole new game it's a whole

728
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,720
new game you start winning the game fast

729
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,399
I've watched thousands of people win the

730
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,080
game over and over again over the

731
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:35,440
Decades of my life I've watched

732
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,960
thousands of people heal from the worst

733
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,120
stuff you could imagine I don't care

734
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,360
what it is from the worst situations

735
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,279
from being in wheelchairs sick with

736
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,720
mystery conditions mystery multiple

737
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,559
sceris mystery everything and get up and

738
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,120
walk and live their life and they're out

739
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,919
there gardening and they're driving in

740
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,360
their

741
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,880
cars I've seen people with the worst

742
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,519
symptoms and the worst conditions

743
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,399
recover over the years because they knew

744
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:10,360
information that was finally real not

745
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:13,000
grandfathered in and and hidden under

746
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,240
bureaucracy of of the medical world

747
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,679
hidden

748
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,799
under funding old funding and old trusts

749
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,159
and everything else involved and then

750
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:24,279
poisonous information spread to the

751
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,279
leading Health experts right now that

752
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:28,279
that use fruits and vegetables and say

753
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:29,919
stay away from gluten talk about

754
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,080
triggers and they talk about great stuff

755
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,240
but they still are they still are

756
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,279
missing the greatest point that stops so

757
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,880
many people from healing the greatest

758
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,519
point of all time for us for our

759
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,399
children which is the body does not

760
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,720
attack itself it's attacking something

761
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:49,440
else it's going after something else you

762
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,200
see right

763
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,159
right and and it's important to know

764
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,919
this so what happens is with say

765
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,240
Hashimoto thy itis your thyroids

766
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,840
inflamed because there's a little bug in

767
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,720
there there's a little bug in the

768
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,480
thyroid that got in there happens to be

769
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,639
the Epstein barv virus that slipped into

770
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,720
the

771
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:14,440
thyroid and that's what's creating the

772
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:18,039
inflammation not the body the body

773
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,000
creates antibodies to go after the virus

774
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:22,960
itself to be working with the immune

775
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,440
system itself hand in hand to go after

776
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,360
the virus the body does not create one

777
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,679
harmed cell

778
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:34,480
there's nothing the immune system can do

779
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:37,039
to create one cell that will harm your

780
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,159
body on any level your immune system

781
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,919
will not harm a single cell of yours

782
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,279
that has to be known that has to be

783
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:48,519
impregnated within your soul in your

784
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:51,799
mind it has to be there you have to have

785
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,880
access to that you have to have access

786
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,919
to

787
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,320
that so what's happening like with

788
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:00,240
hashimotos thyroiditis you're your

789
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,360
bodies after a virus that's the virus

790
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,360
Epstein bar that gets into the thyroid

791
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,039
now leading Health experts that that

792
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,880
actually recently took my information

793
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,840
over the years of how Epstein bar causes

794
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,720
the thyroid problem they're still too

795
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,480
afraid to admit that that autoimmune

796
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,840
isn't the body attacking itself they're

797
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,880
still too afraid to leave those

798
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,480
grandfathered laws because they're

799
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,600
afraid it's going to it's going to get

800
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,080
them to look bad out there maybe they'll

801
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,480
hinder the careers or something like

802
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,559
that don't want to leave that thought

803
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,039
process but what they do is they do say

804
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,039
well Epstein bar could be a little bit

805
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:36,320
of a trigger oh so can this and so could

806
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:38,559
be no that's not it it's the virus

807
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,679
itself that gets into the thyroid this

808
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,960
is way more advanced this is way more

809
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,159
serious and when it comes down to your

810
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,919
health do you want to know the truth do

811
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,000
you want to know the truth or you just

812
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,360
want to know like just the skewed

813
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,080
tainted versions that or the nontruth or

814
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,440
misinformation or misconceptions would

815
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,440
you rather have those would you rather

816
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,720
have all those and that's a people live

817
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,360
by that's what they're using that's what

818
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,240
they're out there doing I think you

819
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,760
would like to have the truth I want the

820
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,080
truth I would love the

821
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,159
truth so when it comes down to

822
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,679
Hashimoto's the virus gets into the

823
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,000
thyroid and it's wreaking the Havoc

824
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,360
that's causing the

825
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,360
inflammation and then your body's trying

826
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,679
to your body's not

827
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,480
inflaming or or attacking it's meaning

828
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:26,360
your own tissue it's going after the

829
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,960
virus the virus is inflaming the virus

830
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,960
causes

831
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,639
inflammation when it comes to aer's

832
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:38,480
danow syndrome connective tissue

833
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:41,279
problems that's a viral condition as

834
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,440
well that's not a genetic condition

835
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,880
where the body is attacking itself it's

836
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,639
not a genetic condition where the body

837
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,440
is attacking

838
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:51,960
itself that's a virus condition too so

839
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,559
I'm trying to give you examples ra

840
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,159
rheumatoid arthritis is a viral

841
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,000
condition your swollen joints your

842
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,919
swollen nerves stats of virus

843
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,240
fibromyalgia which is now being chalked

844
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,880
up to be autoimmune is Epstein bar

845
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,240
creating

846
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,520
inflammation in the

847
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,560
nerves you know I saw a commercial

848
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,599
recently and it was like oh fibromyalgia

849
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,440
it's it's um research in science we uh

850
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:21,760
we believe that it's just overactive

851
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,639
nerves here we are what year are we in

852
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,919
and

853
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,720
fibromyalgia is just it's is

854
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:31,320
overreactive nerves that's that's what

855
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,800
it is meaning that's what research and

856
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,720
science believe it

857
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,240
is Fibromyalgia is caused by one bug

858
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:41,040
only it's caused by the Epstein bar

859
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,000
virus now not every every autoimmune

860
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,200
condition is caused by Epstein bar no I

861
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,280
mean there's the shingles viruses

862
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,960
there's hhv6 there's all the different

863
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,440
viruses that cause these there's heavy

864
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,359
metals combined with them we're going to

865
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,079
cover a little bit of that there's toxic

866
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,000
heavy metals there's chemical agents

867
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,839
there's other triggers but these other

868
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,720
triggers feed viruses and that's another

869
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:05,760
problem no one understands yet is that

870
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:08,520
viruses eat they eat viruses feed off of

871
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,640
food research and science will not

872
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,480
showcase that information they haven't

873
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,720
discovered it and if they do Discover it

874
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,079
they sure as heck aren't going to let us

875
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,599
know because it will prove everything

876
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:22,480
wrong to what they've already funded

877
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,400
before in the past back to that silly

878
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,119
thing I have to tell you guys is once

879
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,400
those strings are attached and once that

880
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:31,920
research is funded a long time ago once

881
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,359
it's been grandfathered in you get

882
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,280
totally shaked

883
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:39,359
over you get totally shaked over that's

884
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,440
what happens here once all that's

885
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,440
happened once those internal Kickbacks

886
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,400
happened 50 years ago 40 years ago 80

887
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,920
years ago whenever it was that research

888
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,920
was done and someone said viruses don't

889
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,160
eat anything that's not how they

890
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,960
recreate once that was put out there

891
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,599
it's hard to

892
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,839
change so even if research and science

893
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,560
discovers that a virus feeds off of

894
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:07,359
mercury it feeds off of mercury they're

895
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,880
not going to tell you it has to be me

896
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,400
that tells you because I'm the only one

897
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,800
that released that information out there

898
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,800
yet in

899
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,960
history but that's the whole point what

900
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:22,400
was the gift I was

901
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,560
given I was given that gift so I can

902
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,200
give you this information I'm relying on

903
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:32,319
getting that information to

904
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:35,119
you so triggers are things that feed a

905
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:38,400
virus that causes autoimmune so if

906
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,440
you're eating gluten gluten is something

907
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,960
that a virus will feed on that's Unknown

908
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,839
by research and Science and no expert

909
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,200
knows that yet and if someone did speak

910
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,680
of it it came from originally from this

911
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,040
Source it's important to

912
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,400
know that it's the triggers that feed

913
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,520
and instigate and break down the immune

914
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,400
system system allowing the virus to get

915
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,319
stronger so like in Lupus if you're

916
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,640
eating gluten and gluten is flaring up

917
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:07,319
more butterfly rashes that's because the

918
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,720
gluten feeding the virus that's

919
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:14,599
releasing a poison causing the butterfly

920
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:19,160
rashes see the virus feeds off of food

921
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:22,359
creates poison causes the rash exmos

922
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,319
orasis that takes the virus inside the

923
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:27,280
liver it's a liver problem where the

924
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:29,680
virus resides Xmen psoriasis is not the

925
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,599
body attacking the skin it's attacking

926
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,599
the Derma attacking it's not doing that

927
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,960
what xoras is is that's a toxin it's

928
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,839
called a dermatoxin and I'm not talking

929
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,720
about the dermatoxin where science of

930
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:44,760
research classifies a dermatoxin say

931
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,119
when you get something poisonous put on

932
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,040
top of the surface of your skin and your

933
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,200
skin reacts that's called a

934
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,000
dermatoxin I'm talking about an internal

935
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,359
dermatoxin that Spirit has provided me

936
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,280
with the information with that doesn't

937
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:57,800
exist somewhere so if you go on you're

938
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,280
and you're on the internet and you're

939
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,920
looking okay dermatoxin oh wait what's

940
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,319
this no that's not the dermatoxin we're

941
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,040
talking about so it's important to know

942
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:09,079
this so you don't get lost out there the

943
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,960
dermatox that I'm talking about is when

944
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:15,359
a virus feeds off of certain foods that

945
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,079
create a different poison that leeches

946
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,040
out from the liver goes into the

947
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:21,359
bloodstream and surfaces through the

948
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,920
skin causes ex and

949
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,359
psoriasis in this case there's a couple

950
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,359
different viruses mainly the epine bar

951
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:32,359
those sits inside the liver feeds off of

952
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:34,839
high levels of copper old levels of DDT

953
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:37,040
cuz DDT is still everywhere still in the

954
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:38,680
it's still in in the reservoirs still in

955
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,480
everybody's drinking water just so you

956
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,200
know DDT still in everybody's drinking

957
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,000
water I hate to say it but it's true in

958
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,760
life changeing Foods I talk about the

959
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,480
unforgiving for maybe some of you are

960
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,079
familiar with it maybe maybe a bunch of

961
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,960
you haven't seen that book yet but the

962
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,079
unforgiving four one of them is DDT and

963
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,560
its cousins pesticides that's one

964
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,680
another one is heavy metals that's

965
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,200
another one the other one is the viral

966
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,280
explosion which we're talking about now

967
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,000
the

968
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,520
viruses and the other one is

969
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,280
radiation what happens is viruses like

970
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,720
an Xmen psoriasis you have a virus

971
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,480
inside the liver it's feeding off of

972
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,079
high levels of copper old DDT some other

973
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,160
garbage it's producing a dermatoxin

974
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,920
specifically that irritates seriously

975
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:25,319
irritates skin inflames it devastatingly

976
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,880
and it's it's it surfaces up to the skin

977
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:31,280
and inflames Flames the skin really

978
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,960
bad and that's with exus Isis but it

979
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,160
takes a virus feeding off of something

980
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,880
is what I'm trying to tell you and

981
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,359
that's that's so far ahead of science

982
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,599
and research right now it's it's not

983
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,119
even funny it's so far ahead years ago

984
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,520
when I was younger I told spirit I

985
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,079
laughed at Spirit and I said spirit I

986
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,640
don't I don't believe you science of

987
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:50,000
research they got it all under

988
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,800
wraps I mean we're talking science and

989
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,240
research because you know why because on

990
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,440
TV when I was a child I saw a rocket

991
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,960
ship heading to the Moon you know that

992
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,040
whole thing

993
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,760
Nassau now I was like there's nothing

994
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,200
Spirit there's nothing you can tell me I

995
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,079
mean there there's a rocket ship going

996
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,560
up into space we went on the moon

997
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,040
there's there's you know there's there's

998
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,440
space

999
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,480
shuttles and I said to Spirit there's

1000
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,680
nothing you can tell me I said to Spirit

1001
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,040
I was I was trying I was being you know

1002
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,839
silly I said there's nothing you can

1003
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,119
tell me that's Advanced that isn't here

1004
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,560
there's nothing in health that they

1005
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,599
haven't figured out they got it all

1006
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,119
wrapped up they got a cure for AIDS they

1007
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,960
they'll find a cure for AIDS tomorrow

1008
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,040
they got it wrapped up spirit said no no

1009
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,200
no no no silly silly

1010
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:40,920
boy silly boy you have no idea and

1011
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,760
spirit taught me and spirit said no

1012
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,960
that's not how it's going to

1013
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,280
be

1014
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,280
and I mean look at the technology we

1015
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,599
have today but yeah children are sick

1016
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,040
with autoimmune moms are sick they can't

1017
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,640
feed their kids take care of their kids

1018
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,960
they can't even hop in cars and drive

1019
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,720
because they're too dizzy to drive

1020
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,760
because you know and they have all these

1021
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,040
different

1022
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,319
diagnoses including Lyme disease Lyme

1023
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,160
disease wasn't classified autoimmune

1024
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,079
because of the fact that they they they

1025
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,319
singled out a bacteria which by the way

1026
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,800
is still really flawed and anybody who

1027
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,200
knows book one of medical medium read

1028
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,240
the lime chapter and you'll know about

1029
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,160
lime more than any anybody

1030
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,400
will but the bottom line is it's going

1031
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,839
to be all falling into categories into

1032
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,839
autoimmune because as years go

1033
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:31,200
on research and Science and medical

1034
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,319
communities are going to be like well

1035
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,720
you know Ms is now autoimmune cuz we

1036
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:36,359
really don't have our hands on it we

1037
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,400
don't have our finger on the pulse

1038
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:41,800
Celiac is autoimmune you know vitil Lego

1039
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,359
any Vio anything to do with skin

1040
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,119
anything to do with you know lupus

1041
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:47,920
anything type 1 diabetes we don't have

1042
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:49,280
our we don't have our handle on it so

1043
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,880
it's all got to get filed into

1044
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,040
autoimmune

1045
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,920
category and it's going to keep on filed

1046
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,319
in then new labels will be created too

1047
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,880
and keep on filed in because it's it's

1048
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,880
got to be your fault it's your fault

1049
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,520
it's your body attacking itself it's

1050
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,240
nothing else than that it's your body

1051
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,599
attacking itself and leading experts in

1052
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,440
the alternative field to be like well

1053
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,440
you know it's immune system problems

1054
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,599
because you know and it's triggers and

1055
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,560
and all this no it's more than that it's

1056
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:15,880
it's what I'm telling you right

1057
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,359
now but the foundation has to be in your

1058
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,200
hands you guys it has to be where you

1059
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,720
know your body isn't destroying itself

1060
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,760
when you know you got an Invader that

1061
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,280
you want to kick out of your home and

1062
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,720
when you want to kick that Invader out

1063
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,040
of your home something changes and

1064
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,520
something

1065
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,400
happens something happens with your

1066
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,559
immune system it gets the strength it

1067
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,440
needs your thoughts in your mind and in

1068
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:40,440
your head and in your brain in your soul

1069
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,280
your thoughts go to your immune system

1070
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,000
and you say haha I knew you were you

1071
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,520
were your immune my immune system was

1072
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,599
working for me I knew you guys were

1073
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,280
working for me I knew my body wasn't

1074
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,880
harming myself I knew something else was

1075
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,440
inside of me that was going on that I

1076
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,920
want out and kicked out I I knew it this

1077
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,880
Foundation is critical for you to heal

1078
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,720
it means everything I promise you that

1079
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,920
it means

1080
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,599
everything seriously I promise you

1081
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,359
that so when that message transfers to

1082
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,400
your thoughts to your brain to your to

1083
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:19,559
your soul to your immune system it gets

1084
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,280
your body to eliminate the poison that

1085
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,400
virus starts to break down it starts to

1086
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,800
break down because it gets a message

1087
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,720
fast

1088
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,319
you know what it

1089
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,079
is that you know what it

1090
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:37,880
is and if you start robbing food from

1091
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:40,240
the viruses that create autoimmune tags

1092
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,359
and labels these illnesses and

1093
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,440
conditions when you start robbing food

1094
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:49,119
from these viruses so they can't

1095
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,720
multiply so they can't continue to

1096
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,319
poison

1097
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,040
you in the thyroid healing book there's

1098
00:43:53,319 --> 00:44:00,680
over 80 symptoms and conditions like EXP

1099
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,400
exp laain in detail and about how it's

1100
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,599
occurring it's very important to

1101
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,480
understand and we're going to cover a

1102
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,240
lot of that right now

1103
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,680
too so with Xmen orasis I covered a

1104
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,160
little bit about how that works with the

1105
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,319
virus with lupus lupus is the Epstein

1106
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,200
bar Epstein bar we talked about before

1107
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:20,480
you heard that comes in different shapes

1108
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,559
and sizes different strains different

1109
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,520
mutations different varieties different

1110
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,720
groups I've been able to classify these

1111
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:30,119
groups cuz I can't rely on science to do

1112
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,319
it so we classified these

1113
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:36,200
groups and with

1114
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:37,599
lupus which is completely not even

1115
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,680
diagnosable you have to understand it's

1116
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,319
diagnosed by the eye all the different

1117
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,440
in inflammatory markers that we use for

1118
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:47,359
testing lupus and

1119
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,240
ra those those are just inflammation

1120
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,240
markers testing levels of

1121
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:56,079
inflammation that's what those are for

1122
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,359
um cative protein you know Ana an the

1123
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,400
nuclear antigen all those are just

1124
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:03,599
they're just for testing for levels of

1125
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,200
inflammation but the mystery is still

1126
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,559
there and with lupus it's Epstein bar

1127
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,839
and the problem is with how it works is

1128
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,000
I've said this before that almost every

1129
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:14,839
autoimmune disease is eventually going

1130
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,280
to be filed into just Lyme disease

1131
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:18,359
category because that's how confused

1132
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,040
everybody is they're so confused it's

1133
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:21,760
going to be pushed off I bet you some of

1134
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,559
you listening have been diagnosed with

1135
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,319
lupus M and Ms and then finally lime it

1136
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,280
just gets pushed off into Li I'm not

1137
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,040
saying that's right either it's not

1138
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,599
right but the point is it gets pushed

1139
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,880
off everything's going to be pushed off

1140
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,839
into it and that's how it's been that's

1141
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,680
how it's

1142
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:43,640
going so with lupus it's about also high

1143
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:46,280
levels of heavy metals Mercury lots of

1144
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,240
mercury having the virus epsteen bar

1145
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,079
feeding off of mercury creating a lot of

1146
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,200
neurotoxins in you know causing

1147
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:55,520
butterfly rashes causing damage to

1148
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,880
tissue in the body causing weakness

1149
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,079
causing fatigue causing reactions all of

1150
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,720
that multiple sclerosis that's also I'm

1151
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:04,680
covering the Epstein bar varieties

1152
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,000
anyway multiple

1153
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,640
sclerosis 100% Epstein bar coupled with

1154
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,119
toxic heavy

1155
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,720
metals and you know and and with

1156
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,559
multiple sclerosis you can get the

1157
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,400
lesions on the brain most of the time

1158
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,160
almost all the time that's not even

1159
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,960
what's causing people symptoms is is

1160
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,359
some of the different dark spots there's

1161
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,960
a lot of people with all kinds of

1162
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,119
different spots inside their brains I'm

1163
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,040
talking about people that are walking

1164
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,400
around every day that don't even know

1165
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,640
there there's so much going on inside

1166
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,319
people's brains there's all kinds of

1167
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,119
calics there's crystallizations there's

1168
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:38,200
uh dark spots brown spots there's white

1169
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:41,440
spots there's there you know deposits of

1170
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:44,119
heavy metals there's deposits of of of

1171
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,520
um MSG there's deposits of chemical

1172
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,119
solvents there's all kinds of different

1173
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,839
things in everybody's head and a lot of

1174
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,240
times it comes up whether somebody has a

1175
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:54,440
symptom or not in a CAT scan say someone

1176
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,960
can't tell you how many times people who

1177
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,440
have come to me over the years say yeah

1178
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:01,680
I banged my head I banged my head on my

1179
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,880
car door pretty hard so I thought I'd

1180
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,000
get a an MRI my doctor recommended an

1181
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,079
MRI cuz it banged my head pretty hard

1182
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,720
and they found a little spot in there

1183
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:14,640
that spot apparently was there all this

1184
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:17,079
time I can't tell you how many people

1185
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,160
have different spots in their head and

1186
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,480
and but it's not causing it's not

1187
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,960
causing their symptoms what happens with

1188
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,040
multiple sclerosis you get a whole bunch

1189
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,480
of people with mystery multiple

1190
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,599
sclerosis with nothing showing up in

1191
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,839
their brain you get a whole bunch of

1192
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,800
people with stuff showing in the brain

1193
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:34,240
but it's Epstein bar and deposits of

1194
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,240
heavy metals that are involved it's a

1195
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,960
virus and deposits of heavy

1196
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,520
metals

1197
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,839
um and you know alopecia is an

1198
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,520
interesting one because that's an

1199
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:46,440
adrenal condition where there's

1200
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,800
different hormones in the adrenals that

1201
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,200
are undiscovered by research and Science

1202
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,040
and one of the hormones undiscovered by

1203
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,720
research and Science in the adrenals um

1204
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,240
is responsible for keeping your hair on

1205
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,599
your head and when that diminishes and

1206
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,079
science research will never know it

1207
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,319
diminishes CU they've never tagged it

1208
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:07,000
they've never discovered the the hormone

1209
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,640
so so that's how hair falls off with

1210
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,960
alopecia and alopecia can come back when

1211
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,359
you keep on you know healing your

1212
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,640
adrenals and all the different stuff we

1213
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:18,400
do for adrenals here at Medical medium

1214
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,280
um we keep on going Hashimoto like I

1215
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,040
said before that's a virus entering into

1216
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,839
the thyroid and there's a way of

1217
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,000
cleaning that out I don't like just

1218
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:32,000
management management is taking away

1219
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
some triggers like gluten and so forth

1220
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,280
and living a better lifestyle which of

1221
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,839
course we all want to do I don't like

1222
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,400
just relying on those for

1223
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:45,240
managing conditions I like knowing we're

1224
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,160
going after something I like knowing

1225
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,920
we're going after something and in the

1226
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,559
back of my mind I'm not thinking my

1227
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,400
body's you know betrayed

1228
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:58,559
me because that's what we're taught

1229
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,240
instead I like knowing we're going after

1230
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,480
something because I like the truth the

1231
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,400
truth matters I like knowing we're going

1232
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,319
after a bug so like with Hashimoto it's

1233
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,559
not about just getting symptoms better

1234
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:13,200
that's that's great we want that but we

1235
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,240
want to make sure that 10 years down the

1236
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,640
road it doesn't flare up again no matter

1237
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,079
what fancy expert showed us a new pull

1238
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,040
away triggers protocol and some you know

1239
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,720
New Tricks about how to minimize or

1240
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,200
break down hashimotos or anything I want

1241
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,000
to go past that I want to go way past

1242
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,799
that you guys I want to do what I've

1243
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,040
done all these years I want to go after

1244
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:39,160
the virus inside the thid kill it off

1245
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:42,240
kill it off so that down the road your

1246
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:44,760
Hashimoto can't come back so your

1247
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,680
thyroid doesn't fall apart like that

1248
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,040
house that mystery house condition I'm

1249
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,960
talking about at the beginning of this

1250
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,720
whole webinar where the Pain's peeling

1251
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,240
off the walls but it's brand new paint

1252
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,960
the water's leaking the ceiling but the

1253
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:58,119
Plumbing's fine I don't want want that

1254
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,440
happening 10 years down the road I want

1255
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:04,319
to go after that virus and kill

1256
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:07,520
it yeah I know it sounds pretty pretty

1257
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,839
tough sounds pretty tough but that's

1258
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,599
what happens when you know that's what

1259
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,200
it is you can go and do it so then you

1260
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:14,280
can come up with your plan you can come

1261
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,040
up with your game plan so not only is it

1262
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:20,799
it taking away

1263
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:23,040
triggers removing triggers that feed a

1264
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,880
condition we're going way above and

1265
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,640
beyond that we're realizing that the

1266
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,400
virus can feed on things that causes

1267
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,839
Hashimoto and that that's so far

1268
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,720
advanced in ahead of everybody it's not

1269
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:35,000
even funny I'm saying that so you don't

1270
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,480
get lost I'm not saying that because I'm

1271
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,680
trying to be Mr big man I'm saying that

1272
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,079
because you don't get lost because you

1273
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,559
can you can leave here and be like oh

1274
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,480
look at this and and that's what anybody

1275
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,640
can do that's normal human nature I

1276
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,920
totally understand it's so easy to do

1277
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,280
that but I don't want you getting lost

1278
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,720
you have to know that you're going after

1279
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,000
a bug and you're going after and you're

1280
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,720
killing it and that's the whole point

1281
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,640
that's what it's about so that you don't

1282
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,680
have a thyroid with nodules long down

1283
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,839
the road that keep on growing because of

1284
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,920
Epstein bar causing Scar Tissue so you

1285
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:11,960
don't and calcification so you don't

1286
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,520
have a condition let eating away your

1287
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,960
thyroid down the

1288
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,640
road and in one year sure you got your

1289
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,839
your numbers better at the doctor's

1290
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,760
office doesn't mean you don't have the

1291
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:26,119
virus cleaned up that's the whole point

1292
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,680
it can come back but it can't come back

1293
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,240
and it can't haunt you when you know the

1294
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,720
truth that your body's not attacking

1295
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,119
itself because if you don't know that

1296
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,839
down the road two years from now you be

1297
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,880
like oh here it goes my body's my body's

1298
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:40,079
attacking itself again because my loose

1299
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,520
blus symptoms are back my thyroid

1300
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,440
symptoms my numbers are off again even

1301
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,799
though I got great results from the last

1302
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,960
expert that told me to remove some

1303
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:50,720
triggers and I got great results but all

1304
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,720
of a sudden my numbers are climbing

1305
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:57,000
again because hey my my body might be

1306
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:59,000
attacking itself again

1307
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,359
right I mean I bet you some of you have

1308
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,599
been through that already some of you

1309
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,720
I'm not probably not all of you but some

1310
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,640
of you have probably been through that

1311
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,920
already you're probably nodding your

1312
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,559
head like yep I've seen that you don't

1313
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,040
want that happening you don't want it

1314
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,599
coming back you don't want it creeping

1315
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,200
back up and you don't want that whole

1316
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,839
poisonous thought saying well you know

1317
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,599
here goes my body again betraying itself

1318
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,400
I had it under control now my body's

1319
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,160
betraying itself again no your body's

1320
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:25,440
not betraying itself it's not attacking

1321
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:28,160
itself can't say that enough and we're

1322
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,319
going after the problem that's what

1323
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:34,720
we're going we're going after the

1324
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:37,319
problem so when it comes down to it

1325
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,799
comes down to like Celiac right Celiac

1326
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:42,880
or remove gluten you got this genetic

1327
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:46,559
problem chocked up the be genes it's not

1328
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:49,480
genes it's not genes Celiac is

1329
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,240
inflammation in the intestinal lining

1330
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,440
from bacteria and

1331
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,760
viruses that's what that is and if you

1332
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,880
eat certain foods protein from certain

1333
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,079
foods like gluten and so forth it can

1334
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:04,079
feed the virus or the bacteria and

1335
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:07,640
create a mysterious

1336
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:09,559
inflamation and throw everything off I

1337
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:12,720
mean it's just it's that

1338
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:14,440
simple it's that simple so it's

1339
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,319
important to understand these

1340
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,799
things colitis is the shingles virus

1341
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,559
that's the shingles virus sitting inside

1342
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:22,440
the lining of the intestinal tract

1343
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,160
that's what kitis is the colon It's the

1344
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,799
shingles virus sitting inside the lining

1345
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,599
of the intestinal tract

1346
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:30,480
it's a virus sitting

1347
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,079
there and that's a colitis is so when we

1348
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,319
take away dairy products and we take

1349
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,720
away gluten we stop feeding the virus we

1350
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,359
start getting it better but you need to

1351
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,760
know that colitis isn't your body

1352
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:45,319
destroying its own colon that is in the

1353
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,079
way of healing knowing that instead you

1354
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:50,119
got a viral condition that you're

1355
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:51,799
working on killing off and

1356
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:56,040
healing

1357
00:53:51,799 --> 00:54:01,880
see it matters to know your your game

1358
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:05,440
the goal the goal end game it matters to

1359
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,160
know where you're going to win winning

1360
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,640
matters when it comes down to health and

1361
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,640
heck you don't even have to think about

1362
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,200
winning if you have the right

1363
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:14,720
information you just start to heal it

1364
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:18,799
happens along the way type 1 diabetes is

1365
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,319
an injury to the pancreas not your body

1366
00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:24,079
attacking the pancreas type one type

1367
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:26,960
1.5 it's not your body attacking the

1368
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,480
pancreas it's not an autoimmune

1369
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,599
condition instead it's a viral condition

1370
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:36,880
or it's injured tissue from a viral

1371
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:39,839
condition at one point or even a toxic

1372
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,160
bacteria that injured the pancreas at

1373
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:45,119
one

1374
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:48,119
point and that tissue in the pancreas is

1375
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:51,520
injured and that's how type one

1376
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:54,400
occurs it's an injury to the pancreas

1377
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,520
not caused by your body very important

1378
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,760
to understand you you could always

1379
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,880
listen to my my diabetes show can always

1380
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,559
listen to

1381
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:07,799
that um so that's important to know too

1382
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:10,440
hepatitis hepatitis A Hepatitis B C D is

1383
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:13,599
all viral they're just different stages

1384
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,400
of what the virus is doing to the liver

1385
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,359
so all the hepatitis that's not

1386
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:21,359
autoimmune autoimmune liver conditions

1387
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:23,039
hepatitis A B C and D and the term

1388
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,480
autoimmune

1389
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,359
hepatitis is a mistake All In its own

1390
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:31,319
with research and science they don't

1391
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:33,240
even know what virus hepatitis C virus

1392
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:35,680
or Hepatitis B virus is they have no

1393
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:40,319
idea cuz they've never found it they

1394
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:42,680
only find inflammation and markers and

1395
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:45,000
those antibodies that aren't destroying

1396
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,720
the liver antibodies the immune system

1397
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,680
is creating for

1398
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:53,160
you to go after a virus involving going

1399
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:56,400
after a virus the virus that causes all

1400
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:59,520
hepatitis is varieties of the herpetic

1401
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,680
family and you know mainly the Epstein

1402
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,480
bar does the

1403
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,839
hepatitis skin rashing

1404
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,440
Mysteries most of the skin rashing

1405
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:11,920
Mysteries are shingles variety exer and

1406
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,799
psoriasis is can be a hash Posh of a

1407
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,839
couple different viruses the Epstein bar

1408
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:17,920
and the shingles both inside the liver

1409
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,359
feeding off of high levels of copper and

1410
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,200
DDT but a lot of different mystery skin

1411
00:56:20,359 --> 00:56:25,000
rashing conditions including lupus are

1412
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,720
you know different you know you know

1413
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,200
like lupus is is the Epstein bar

1414
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,319
releasing a lot of neurotoxin a lot of

1415
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,400
Dermot toxin but a lot of people have

1416
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:35,280
both shingles virus and epine Bar in

1417
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,359
their system creating a lot of

1418
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,440
dermatoxin and a lot of different you

1419
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:42,680
know varieties of of neurotoxins a lot

1420
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,400
of these mystery shingles varieties

1421
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,319
family of shingles but they won't

1422
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,240
diagnose with shingles because it

1423
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:51,240
doesn't have that textbook one

1424
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,000
grandfather textbook law you have to

1425
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,200
understand like

1426
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
shingles basically research search and

1427
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,520
science believe shingles is just this

1428
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,760
one type of shingles the one you see on

1429
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,400
on the TV commercials they don't know

1430
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,480
there's over 31 varieties that that that

1431
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,039
spirit and I have sourced 31 varieties

1432
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,039
meaning s I've sourced from Spirit that

1433
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:11,760
have helped people with it's in book one

1434
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:14,760
too I talk about it in book one medical

1435
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,440
medium but instead let's blame it on you

1436
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,319
that's the whole point let's blame it on

1437
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:22,920
you guys that's the fall Fallout it's

1438
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:25,720
all blamed on us all mystery illness is

1439
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:29,240
blamed on us that's where it

1440
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,640
goes and then not only blamed on us but

1441
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,960
if you go to the best alternative

1442
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:37,480
practitioners it's blamed on what we're

1443
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:39,680
doing that's not good enough either look

1444
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,079
you're hearing it from me I tell people

1445
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,920
if you're doing this and you're eating

1446
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:46,119
dairy products and you're eating

1447
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,599
eggs and you're eating gluten and you

1448
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:49,160
know and you're doing this and that it's

1449
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,240
not good you're going to hear that from

1450
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,160
me but you're going to hear something

1451
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,319
else because you're going to be feeding

1452
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,280
something inside of you that is causing

1453
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,200
this condition I condition you're going

1454
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,920
to hear the truth and it's not your body

1455
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,280
destroying itself but research and

1456
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:04,640
science wants you to believe your genes

1457
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,799
are faulty you got bad jeans jeans are

1458
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:11,440
so seductive in a way because they suck

1459
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:14,520
you in jeans are so

1460
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,359
tantalizingly you know like alluring

1461
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,440
because it's genes it's like it's it's

1462
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:21,079
science hey hardcore science we we're

1463
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,000
made of genes we got these hereditary

1464
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:24,920
traits we're but you need to know on

1465
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,440
none of these illnesses I have mentioned

1466
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:29,760
here have anything to do with genes and

1467
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,319
many more don't have anything to do with

1468
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,480
genes on any level but genetic science

1469
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:37,039
is grandfathered in going all the way

1470
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,520
back with the genome projects of the old

1471
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:42,400
days of the

1472
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:44,799
1940s 1950s 19 late 1930s it's

1473
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,400
grandfathered in by law there are

1474
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:50,000
documents piled so high up in somebody's

1475
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,720
Vault that makes it so you're going to

1476
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,119
think genes are going to be the reason

1477
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,799
why you and your children are sick and

1478
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:58,280
your grandchild children is sick for the

1479
00:58:55,799 --> 00:59:00,760
years to come and it's your body and

1480
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,400
it's you and it's your own faulty genes

1481
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,359
and they're going to have the answers to

1482
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,960
how to fix your jeans it's one of the

1483
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:11,039
greatest greatest mistakes of all time

1484
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:13,520
and it falls into the ballpark of your

1485
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,839
body's attacking itself as

1486
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,240
well so how do we clean up these

1487
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,920
autoimmune diseases and conditions and

1488
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,799
and illnesses how do we clean these

1489
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,319
things up how do we do what we need to

1490
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:28,280
do what's right taking triggers away is

1491
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:30,160
critical but knowing what you're doing

1492
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,760
and why you're doing it is more critical

1493
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,839
with it making sure you're eliminating

1494
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,920
toxic heavy metals because they feed the

1495
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:40,960
viruses that cause these conditions so

1496
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,319
you want to remove these toxic heavy

1497
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,720
metals that's important you want to

1498
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:47,760
start bringing in foods like the wild

1499
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,359
blueberries you can get the Frozen wild

1500
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,359
blueberries you bring those in because

1501
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:54,799
they start pulling out heavy metals you

1502
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:58,039
want to bring in some spirulina I said

1503
00:59:54,799 --> 01:00:01,000
it before in book one and I think in

1504
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:04,200
book two life-changing foods that

1505
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,599
carella is not as good as spirulina

1506
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:11,039
spirulina removes metal holds on to it

1507
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,680
longer and helps get it out of the body

1508
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,480
carella drops it

1509
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,839
instantly I said this in the books and

1510
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,680
then I recently saw on the internet

1511
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:25,119
somewhere someone who

1512
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:27,280
even read my book still saying

1513
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:30,640
that no Corella is better it's way

1514
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,880
better the science behind it you name it

1515
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,480
I don't care about science and research

1516
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,880
I care about it in a lot of ways but I

1517
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,440
don't care about it when it comes down

1518
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,920
to your chronic illness because it never

1519
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,400
has it right when it comes down to your

1520
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,200
chronic illness I'm just being honest it

1521
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,400
never has it

1522
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:50,000
right and you want what's going to work

1523
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,119
s sparina really takes out the metals

1524
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,359
it's not sloppy it doesn't drop the

1525
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:58,160
metals cilantro is a great one

1526
01:00:55,359 --> 01:01:01,119
but you want the metals out so that's

1527
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:03,280
one thing you want to do but always keep

1528
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:06,000
in mind that when you're dealing with

1529
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,160
autoimmune just any sense of it

1530
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,079
regardless of what it is meaning you get

1531
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,520
a diagnosis whatever that could be

1532
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,839
whether it's Hashimoto or anything or

1533
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,319
anything else we discussed already um

1534
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:17,760
the different names and labels and

1535
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,280
diseases and illnesses whether it's

1536
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,559
eamus rasis Hashimoto whether it's lupus

1537
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:25,160
whether it's rheumatoid arthritis always

1538
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,200
keep in mind that heavy metals

1539
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:30,280
they're not the cause of Lupus they're

1540
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:33,280
not the cause of

1541
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,599
Hashimoto and they're not the cause of

1542
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:38,160
different things they're just they're

1543
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,839
they're a food heavy metals are a food

1544
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:43,359
and always keep that in mind that it's

1545
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:44,119
it's a food just like when you're eating

1546
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:47,000
a

1547
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:50,640
food it's the same thing so when you're

1548
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,960
eating the eggs that feed an Invader

1549
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:57,079
that feed a pathogen that feed a virus

1550
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,880
causing lupus causing Hashimoto being

1551
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:02,240
able to get that strength and causing

1552
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:05,039
Hashimoto when you're feeding that virus

1553
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:07,319
with a food it likes to feed off of or

1554
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:10,160
it likes to eat when you're doing that

1555
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:13,880
realize that there's also other foods

1556
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,039
and heavy metals are that food and

1557
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,839
that's you know that's the whole thing

1558
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:21,559
is the heavy metals the Mercury the AR

1559
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:23,160
arsenic um cadmium lead nickel nickel's

1560
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:25,279
another one that's really out there it's

1561
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,680
inner system alloy

1562
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:30,400
um steel actually steel you know what is

1563
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,880
steel it's steel can be a different

1564
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,400
blend of different things but it's the

1565
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,839
it's literally these things can get into

1566
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:42,240
US Mercury being the worst aluminum and

1567
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:46,240
um and so and as far as when it comes

1568
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:49,119
down to uh labels like meaning labels we

1569
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:53,640
get given we were given for you or

1570
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:55,240
diagnosis for a condition and realize

1571
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,880
that whatever it may be that's in the

1572
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,720
autoimmune field or Arena that we want

1573
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:04,039
the heavy metals out of our system we

1574
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,960
want the heavy metals out of our body

1575
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:08,119
because it's an additional food is what

1576
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,920
it is like the copper like you know too

1577
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:13,200
high of copper inside the liver when it

1578
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:15,799
comes down to examon psoriasis for a

1579
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,559
pathogen to feed off of for a virus to

1580
01:03:15,799 --> 01:03:21,160
feed off of so that virus will feed off

1581
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:23,920
that copper so you want that you want to

1582
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,920
lower your metal load so not just lower

1583
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,079
your spiral load like I always say with

1584
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,799
all the different things it's lowering

1585
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,039
your metal load lowering lowering your

1586
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:34,720
heavy metal load and when you're doing

1587
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,559
that I like the heavy metal detox

1588
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,839
smoothie that I've always recommended

1589
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:41,000
it's on the blog I got a Blog with it

1590
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:43,319
you know the whole bit you guys know um

1591
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,599
sure many of you might have known that

1592
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:49,359
and you know it's the spirulina it's the

1593
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:52,000
vimer barleygrass juice powder um it's

1594
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:53,119
the Atlantic uh sea vegetables the

1595
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,680
Atlantic

1596
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,119
douls that that's also incredible to

1597
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,440
have in there the

1598
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:03,760
cilantro and the Frozen wild blueberries

1599
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:07,599
all of these work together they all work

1600
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:09,480
together it's just one doesn't do all

1601
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,319
it's they all work together because they

1602
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,279
hold on to the metal and take it to a

1603
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:15,720
certain degree certain part of of

1604
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:17,640
eliminating out of the body that takes

1605
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,640
it to a certain degree of eliminating it

1606
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:23,359
out of the body and then that next thing

1607
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:25,760
grabs onto it that's how it works that

1608
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,559
next um like the barley grass then grabs

1609
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,240
on to it then the dols takes it down to

1610
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:31,200
the end you know and the cilantro is

1611
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,880
extracting it from organs then the wild

1612
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,520
blueberries extracting it from the brain

1613
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:39,720
all these things matter and so the heavy

1614
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:42,000
metal detox is a great a great um way to

1615
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:44,119
pull these Metals out over time doesn't

1616
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,279
happen in one day although metal leaves

1617
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:49,319
in one day heavy metals toxic heavy

1618
01:04:46,279 --> 01:04:50,880
metals are leaving in one day they they

1619
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:52,960
they're leaving the body in one day when

1620
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,920
you start drinking that they start to

1621
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:58,279
leave the body in that one day but they

1622
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,599
they it's a slow process a slow process

1623
01:04:58,279 --> 01:05:02,160
and then the body needs its time to heal

1624
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:04,359
and the virus needs to be the viruses

1625
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,119
and pathogens need to have their cut off

1626
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:08,200
where they're not getting fed anymore

1627
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:10,920
all this matters and it all helps to

1628
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,920
eliminate autoimmune something to just

1629
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,799
be focused on to something to really

1630
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,839
think about the other thing is you you

1631
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:18,559
don't want foods that feed the viruses

1632
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:22,200
that create autoimmune you don't want

1633
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:24,799
Foods doing that you don't want eggs I

1634
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:28,160
know eggs are considered a perfect food

1635
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:30,000
I mean I have to tell you how many times

1636
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,880
how much information I put out about

1637
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,599
eggs feeding viruses they're literally

1638
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,760
they incubate a virus that's what they

1639
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:41,200
do I don't care if they're free range

1640
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:44,319
pasturised in your backyard I mean free

1641
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:46,279
pasture past pasture you know like

1642
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:49,839
they're just able to walk in grass and

1643
01:05:46,279 --> 01:05:52,720
Peck away it's all better better than a

1644
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:55,200
conventional egg that's contaminated 10

1645
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,440
time 10 with it injected hormones and

1646
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,680
aluminum God forbid everything else but

1647
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:04,559
the point is is that eggs in general no

1648
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:08,000
matter what and where they feed all the

1649
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:10,319
viruses they really instigate lupus PCOS

1650
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,079
they're really terrible for PCOS

1651
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:15,559
it's it it's sad when I see some of the

1652
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:17,920
best doctors out there like no you got

1653
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:20,119
to eat eggs if you got PCOS you got to

1654
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:25,480
eat lots of protein lots of eggs it's

1655
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:28,319
disastrous for ovary issues dis asterus

1656
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:31,599
it also feeds every virus that creates

1657
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:34,480
literally every different virus every

1658
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,599
different bacteria that creates every

1659
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,760
autoimmune condition that's labeled

1660
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:39,760
autoimmune out there with

1661
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:47,240
confusion and those eggs can really

1662
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,559
feed the viruses so we have to think

1663
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,079
about that we have to be cautious about

1664
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,079
it try to keep them out the best we can

1665
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:54,200
now if it's the only thing you can eat

1666
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,680
and you got no money and you got no way

1667
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,359
to survive and you got a friend that

1668
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,079
gives you eggs and that's your survival

1669
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:01,880
I'm on board 100% then we do other

1670
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:04,640
things we do other things along with it

1671
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,200
I'm on board 100% we'll do other things

1672
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,119
but if you can and you have the

1673
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:11,079
resources and you have the ability to

1674
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,960
keep eggs out of the diet you got to do

1675
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:18,240
it how it works is the virus looks for

1676
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,880
egg material what's egg material

1677
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,079
hormones that are naturally in eggs

1678
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,760
natural hormones natural hormones that

1679
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,520
are in eggs not n injected ones not

1680
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:29,359
foreign ones natural ones that are from

1681
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:31,799
the chicken inside eggs looks for those

1682
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:35,240
and it feeds off of

1683
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:38,440
those and it uses it as fuel it turn

1684
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:39,760
it's a steroid to a virus that's what

1685
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:43,160
it's like it's like us doing human

1686
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:45,960
growth hormone it's a steroid literally

1687
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:48,400
to a virus that's how it works dairy

1688
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:52,039
product same thing it's very similar

1689
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:53,440
keep away from all Dairy so yeah sure I

1690
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:54,520
mean there's practitioners out there now

1691
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,000
that know better better they've learned

1692
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,799
over the years that okay we got to take

1693
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,599
away Dairy we'll get your Hashimoto

1694
01:07:57,799 --> 01:08:02,839
better we'll take away Dairy too but no

1695
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:05,119
it takes more than that it takes knowing

1696
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:07,319
everything I talked about it takes it

1697
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:09,880
all you don't want to feed once you know

1698
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:12,000
you're starving out the bug that's

1699
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:14,559
creating your lupus your aer's dandro

1700
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,440
syndrome your ra rart arthritis your

1701
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:19,799
your Ms multiple sclerosis your Celiac

1702
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:21,960
your vido your alopecia your psorisis

1703
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:24,920
your your eczema your colitis your

1704
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:28,520
Hashim Modas your Addison your Addison

1705
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:33,080
by the way which is also a condition

1706
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:35,440
that's that's viral 100% Graves

1707
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,239
hyperthyroidism is not the body

1708
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:40,199
attacking the thyroid it's it's the

1709
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:43,040
Epstein BS one of the mutated versions

1710
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:46,159
of the Epstein bar that's recreating

1711
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:50,000
that's actually causing inflammation and

1712
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:52,359
then the thyroid the thyroid is being is

1713
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
being scarred from it from the virus

1714
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:56,880
itself scarring up the thyroid thyroid

1715
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,400
and that you need to know that's how it

1716
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,199
works with Graves I'm going explain it

1717
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,920
in more detail over time shog syndrome

1718
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:07,759
type 1 diabetes hepatitis A B C D lyan

1719
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:10,400
sclerosis stic arthritis and more all

1720
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:12,120
these different conditions there's bugs

1721
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,560
that are feeding off of stuff and once

1722
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,199
you starve the bugs once you starve the

1723
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,359
bugs of what they like to eat and then

1724
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:21,880
you go after the bugs and you build up

1725
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:25,359
your immune system and you also go after

1726
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:26,279
the bugs you really become freed from

1727
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,279
the

1728
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:32,960
autoimmune confusion you become freed

1729
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,799
from it over time and you heal over time

1730
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,839
your neurological conditions your

1731
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:40,839
neurological symptoms get

1732
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:43,560
better all of them start getting better

1733
01:09:40,839 --> 01:09:45,679
tingles numbness aches and pains

1734
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:49,080
floaters in the

1735
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,600
eyes all of it can start getting better

1736
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:54,360
anxiety

1737
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:57,400
depression inflammation rashes

1738
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,400
severe fatigue all of it can start

1739
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,080
getting

1740
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,480
better so let's talk about um what we

1741
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,960
can do secret weapons here you know

1742
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:07,840
supplements are critical they are

1743
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:10,120
critical a lot of people though that are

1744
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,679
so inflamed they can only handle so much

1745
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,360
I mean go to your doctor go to your

1746
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,159
practitioner that you love and Trust

1747
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,760
bring them this information bring them

1748
01:10:15,159 --> 01:10:19,239
the supplement information if you need

1749
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:22,000
to ask them about it you know work with

1750
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:24,600
somebody that you love and that's always

1751
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,120
the best way to do it anyway

1752
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,480
but but there's a lot of things that

1753
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,600
need to be understood one is severe zinc

1754
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:35,199
deficiencies zinc

1755
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:38,199
deficiencies is be is caused

1756
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:40,760
by the viral issues that cause the

1757
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:42,400
autoimmune labels and diseases and

1758
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,760
conditions so getting your zinc in a

1759
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:47,679
better place is a huge step huge step

1760
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,560
makes a big difference talk here

1761
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,880

they don't have they're the right kind

1771

that work it's a big that's a big thing

1772
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:15,560
I do have to say that supplements matter

1773
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,400
the kind they are the ones that spirit

1774
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,640

the best so people get the best results

1776
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:24,239
so on the page you'll see you can you

1777
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,679
know click to find the right supplements

1778
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:29,120
for this webinar that you know are safe

1779
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:30,080
and then know that work the right ones

1780
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,360
but you could always talk to your

1781
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:35,120
practitioners about anything about

1782
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:38,840
dosages or anything else but you need to

1783
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:40,360
know um you need to know that zinc is

1784
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,840
critical for

1785
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:45,040
autoimmune anything

1786
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,800
autoimmune that means all the conditions

1787
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,800
symptoms all that zinc is is important

1788
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:53,320
because what zinc does is it shuts down

1789
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:55,440
viruses it slows down viruses it slows

1790
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,760
them down when you put a little bit of

1791
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:00,639
zinc the right kind that we that we have

1792
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:04,040
listed a little bit of zinc in your

1793
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:06,400
mouth the right kind it goes to the

1794
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:08,239
thyroid and the upam bar that's sitting

1795
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,880
in there causing hashimotos thyroiditis

1796
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:15,159
or any kind of hypothyroidism or any

1797
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:17,600
hyperthyroidism that virus gets hit hard

1798
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:19,920
hit real hard we can't function with

1799
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,280
with the right kind of zinc in the body

1800
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,719
not to mention the zinc increases your

1801
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:29,199
immune system's ability to fight fight

1802
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:32,400
more for you so that's one thing the B12

1803
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:34,400
the B12 is is important now hey you're

1804
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,040
going to say well I know about B12 hey

1805
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:38,400
this expert said about B12 I'm talking

1806
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:40,520
about the right kind still to this day I

1807
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:43,560
don't think the best practitioners are

1808
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:45,440
us even using the adenos sil cobalamin

1809
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,520
the methyl cobalamin with adenos Sil

1810
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,719
cobalamin when it comes down to

1811
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,320
autoimmune any conditions any symptoms

1812
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:54,960
that we talk about all of this when it

1813
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:57,960
comes down to it you have to have the

1814
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:01,040
methyl and the adino they have to be

1815
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:03,719
both that's what matters the adino silab

1816
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:06,560
balamin has everything to do with

1817
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:09,239
something that goes wrong which is the G

1818
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:12,800
mutation thing it's not a g mutation

1819
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:14,800
okay methylation is not a gene mutation

1820
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,719
you can listen to the show um you know

1821
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:19,719
the radio show on that next time you you

1822
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:21,440
know you have a chance but methylation

1823
01:13:19,719 --> 01:13:24,520
problems are caused and the gene

1824
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,560
mutations that occur on on blood work

1825
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,199
it's which is really just an

1826
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,600
inflammatory test it's not even a real

1827
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:32,040
gene mutation you have to understand

1828
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:35,440
it's caused by a viral condition viruses

1829
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:38,360
cause methylation problems in order to

1830
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:42,239
heal a methylation problem it's not just

1831
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:44,800
the methyl folate you need you need the

1832
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:47,760
adinos silab balamin combined this is a

1833
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:50,840
secret weapon to stopping and healing

1834
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,800
autoimmune problems is you need the

1835
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,520
adinos sil cobalamin mixed with the

1836
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,840
methab follow in is something that

1837
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:59,360
nobody knew about I mean literally I've

1838
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:01,440
been I I waited for the first one to

1839
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,400
ever come out and then I've been the

1840
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,480
person to get the information out about

1841
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:09,679
it it's so important and what that does

1842
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:13,800
is it helps to repair methylation issues

1843
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:16,400
methylation issues or is a liver problem

1844
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,760
because someone's been viral so long

1845
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:21,000
creating autoimmune symptoms and

1846
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:23,360
conditions that's really I'm going to

1847
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,159
give you the nutshell on methylation

1848
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:30,800
it's a liver condition it's when a liver

1849
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:34,159
cannot um cannot

1850
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:39,080
redesign chemical compounds to make them

1851
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:41,120
more available for our body to use to

1852
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:44,080
help heal and get the nervous system

1853
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,280
stronger get the immune system stronger

1854
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:49,679
so that's what's happening and everybody

1855
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:51,639
with ra and lupus and Ms and Celiac and

1856
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,679
even Lyme disease and Vigo and

1857
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:56,320
everything we got here everybody body

1858
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:59,800
has a condition where there's a lowgrade

1859
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:02,719
viral issue deep inside the body or a

1860
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:06,600
pathogen deep inside the body and it

1861
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:10,280
usually resides in the liver many times

1862
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:12,960
causing methylation problems over time

1863
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:16,159
and this gets completely misconstrued

1864
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:19,320
completely um um thrown off by the

1865
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:21,560
medical research and science people and

1866
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:24,320
they don't understand that it's because

1867
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:26,639
of this viral condition Crea creating a

1868
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,080
tremendous amount of poison toxins in

1869
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:33,080
the liver so the liver

1870
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:35,480
cannot do what it needs to do meaning

1871
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:37,440
rearrange chemical compounds create new

1872
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:39,840
chemical compounds that attach to other

1873
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,000
chemical compounds that we ingest or eat

1874
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,679
and combine and make methylation

1875
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,199
possible in a

1876
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:48,600
nutshell so the denal cobalamin the

1877
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:50,480
methab balamin is great way these are

1878
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,040
great starting

1879
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,600
points for doing what you need to do if

1880
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,600
you you may you may say hey I've been on

1881
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:00,159
B12 I'm not better no no it's got to be

1882
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,400
it's got to be the this kind this be the

1883
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:06,120
dino soab balaman comined okay so that's

1884
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:09,280
important to know um so that's one

1885
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:10,639
secret weapon if you can handle sparina

1886
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,679
you know a lot of people are sensitive

1887
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:13,159
they can't handle any kind of

1888
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,600
supplements where they get sensitive and

1889
01:16:13,159 --> 01:16:16,320
they don't like it or it doesn't feel

1890
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,920
good in their stomach or they feel like

1891
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,960
they don't feel good from it you know

1892
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:23,199
spiralen is really good that's another

1893
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:25,679
great one vitamin C now if you're into

1894
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:27,600
animal products if you're into you know

1895
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,280
make sure it's the cleanest animal meats

1896
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,040
you know and whatever you eat I would

1897
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,440
stay away from chicken um if you're an

1898
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,080
into animal products I would probably

1899
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,600
keep it a little salmon if you're if

1900
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:39,880
you're okay with that and uh maybe some

1901
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,880
grass-fed beef if you really like that

1902
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,600
and maybe some you know some wild game

1903
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:46,080
or something if you really like that but

1904
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,719
here's the deal if you're into animal

1905
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:51,679
products don't over eat the animal

1906
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:53,320
Foods because you need room for all the

1907
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:55,000
other secret weapons for all the fruits

1908
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,760
and vegetables you need room for the

1909
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,840
celery you need room for the celery

1910
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,480
juices you need room for the smoothies

1911
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,880
you need room for the fruits you need

1912
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:05,360
room for the berries you need room for

1913
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,320
the greens you need more room for the

1914
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:10,960
cauliflower the

1915
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:12,760
vegetables do not be afraid of I can't

1916
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,360
believe till this day

1917
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:18,280
still there's all these alternative guys

1918
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:20,120
out there and gals talking about how

1919
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:22,159
stay away from cabbage stay away from

1920
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:24,719
broccoli stay away from broccoli Rob

1921
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:27,560
stay away from col flower stay away from

1922
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,800
um kale with a thyroid condition

1923
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,440
meanwhile what's in those actually kills

1924
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,239
off the virus and that's that's an

1925
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,600
example right there of what happens when

1926
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:37,400
you don't know what's causing a problem

1927
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,400
so with Hashimoto thyroiditis if you

1928
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,040
don't know there's a virus actually

1929
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,199
causing the problem and you're still in

1930
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:47,400
the dark in Antiquity land back in in in

1931
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:49,840
antique times of of information back

1932
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,440
where it's outdated already I mean this

1933
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,440
new literature coming out is already

1934
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,719
outdated right off the press and and

1935
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,480
right there believe stay away from these

1936
01:17:55,719 --> 01:18:00,120
gorog genic Foods these compounds that

1937
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:02,800
are in these Foods don't they don't even

1938
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:04,280
realize that what's in that food kills

1939
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,000
off the very virus that's causing your

1940
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:09,239
Hashimoto thyroiditis you don't have to

1941
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,719
worry about the quen compound once once

1942
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:13,760
you know these people they don't know

1943
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:16,360
that you get in trouble you keep away

1944
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,520
from kale which is incredible for any

1945
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,199
kind of condition autoimmune condition

1946
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:23,080
incredible for any kind of viral

1947
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:25,840
condition so kale and broccoli you you

1948
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,199
can't be afraid of those you have to

1949
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,880
bring those

1950
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:31,600
in but it give you some simple basic you

1951
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:34,480
know powerful ways you know cucumber

1952
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,960
juice a great way of healing from any

1953
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,679
condition that's especially like all

1954
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,960
these different autoimmune conditions

1955
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:43,679
because it helps flush out toxins that

1956
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:45,080
the viruses are creating that's another

1957
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,600
reason why people are so sick they get

1958
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:49,120
the combination of the neurological

1959
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:52,440
fatigue the combination of the fatigue

1960
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:54,719
and the rashes and the head spins and

1961
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,440
the balance issues and the floaters in

1962
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,040
the eyes and the tingles and numbness

1963
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,639
and the anxiety and they get all these

1964
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,520
different combinations and the weight

1965
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:02,679
gain and the adrenal fatigue and

1966
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,760
everything else they get all these

1967
01:19:02,679 --> 01:19:07,000
different combinations of

1968
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,520
problems a lot of it is because you have

1969
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,159
the pathogen and you have all the poison

1970
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,920
it's creating that's creating all these

1971
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:15,560
different symptoms it's completely a

1972
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,400
mystery to all medical research and

1973
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:20,080
Science and the best experts telling you

1974
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,880
right now and one way of flushing out a

1975
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,960
lot of the poison to make it simplistic

1976
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,960
and make it easy for you so this doesn't

1977
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:27,719
so this isn't overwhelming as you get

1978
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:29,719
your cucumber juice going every single

1979
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:31,280
day and you get a celery juice going

1980
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:32,920
every single day you start removing

1981
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,440
those poisons the celery juice the

1982
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,000
mineral salts and the celery juice start

1983
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,880
to clean up the liver they start to

1984
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,199
build up your hydrochloric acid start to

1985
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:42,400
strengthen the bile so you can break

1986
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:45,159
down bacteria and viruses that are

1987
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:48,120
inside the intestinal tract that cause

1988
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:49,679
colitis it all matters so you get the

1989
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:52,120
celery juice you got the cucumber juice

1990
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,360
it's one example right there and you got

1991
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,199
the Smoothie where we're going to we're

1992
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:59,760
going to talk about that we got for you

1993
01:19:56,199 --> 01:20:01,159
as well that you'll see later and so

1994
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,159
these are some of the things to be you

1995
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:05,560
know to work with so some other things

1996
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:07,880
with with autoimmune that are really

1997
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:11,719
helpful just just basic founded

1998
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:15,040
foundational pieces nettle leaf tea

1999
01:20:11,719 --> 01:20:18,960
nettle leaf and lemon balm nettle Leaf

2000
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:21,280
capsules are fine um lemon balm tea is

2001
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,719
really good these are powerful things

2002
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:27,920
now remember when you drink a cup of

2003
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:30,480
lemon balm tea when you drink a cup of

2004
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:34,000
that and you think your body's attacking

2005
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:37,920
itself it's not going to Harbor the

2006
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,920
power as much as it Harbors when you

2007
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:43,440
drink that lemon balm tea knowing that

2008
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:46,760
there's a phytochemical in the lemon

2009
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:49,239
balm itself that's going after the virus

2010
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:52,040
that's attacking your body it's not you

2011
01:20:49,239 --> 01:20:54,760
or your body attacking it's the virus

2012
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:58,120
and that lemon bomb tea is killing it

2013
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:01,120
that lemon bomb tea is actually killing

2014
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:03,199
off the bug or whatever bug you have or

2015
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:05,360
pathogen that you have that's causing

2016
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:07,320
your multitude of symptoms and diagnosis

2017
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:09,639
and millions of doctor bills and

2018
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:11,199
everything else and and sadness and

2019
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:13,880
depression and and everything you've

2020
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:16,600
been through there's a bug in there and

2021
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:18,800
when that lemon bomb has a phytochemical

2022
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:21,639
and it's destroying and killing that

2023
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:23,280
virus in that bug

2024
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:25,480
directly

2025
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:29,000
Everything

2026
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:34,400
Changes Everything

2027
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:36,400
Changes being straight out everything

2028
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,000
changes right

2029
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,440
there so you got to have that in your

2030
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
hand you have the power of that in your

2031
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:45,360
hand so I like I like for you know I

2032
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,120
like the lemon balm I like the nettle

2033
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,360
Leaf nettle Leaf is an anti-inflammatory

2034
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,400
do you know why it's an

2035
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:53,400
anti-inflammatory you know why if you go

2036
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,840
and look up like herbal stuff out there

2037
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,320
and some top herbalist they'll be like

2038
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,320
oh it's

2039
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,800
anti-inflammatory it's anti- this why

2040
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,840
why is it anti-inflammatory because

2041
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,000
nobody knows you know why it's

2042
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,679
anti-inflammatory because it kills

2043
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,800
something it kills

2044
01:22:06,679 --> 01:22:14,679
something it's killing the

2045
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:19,000
bug that's trying to bother you invade

2046
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:22,239
you that's why that's how it works

2047
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,520
that's how it works you know turmeric

2048
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:27,760
same with turmeric why is turmeric

2049
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,960
anti-inflammatory how's that possible

2050
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,199
why is it anti-inflammatory well it's

2051
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,520
got a flight of chemicals in there

2052
01:22:30,199 --> 01:22:33,480
science researchers looking into

2053
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,440
turmeric they're finding different

2054
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:36,560
alkaloids in turmeric they're finding

2055
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:38,000
different you know different things that

2056
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:41,800
can actually get inflammation down

2057
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,560
that's not it no it's got phytochemicals

2058
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:46,960
that are poisonous to bugs that keep

2059
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:50,440
people's joints inflamed that keeps

2060
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:52,639
their backs inflamed like shingles going

2061
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:54,320
after somebody's back and sciatic neres

2062
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:56,040
sciatica caus you know it's deep

2063
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:58,239
shingles in there you don't even have to

2064
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:59,560
have the rash at all I talk about that

2065
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:02,280
there's there's non- rashing and there's

2066
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:05,639
rashing and that's the turmeric

2067
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:09,679
phytochemicals going in and killing off

2068
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:13,600
lowering a viral load lowering a viral

2069
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:16,400
load man it's a whole new world it's a

2070
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:19,920
whole new world when you connect the

2071
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:21,480
dots when you have the truth it's a

2072
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,159
whole new

2073
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:25,360
world

2074
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:27,159
so Foods I want you guys to you know I

2075
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,840
want you guys to work on squash having

2076
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:30,639
that in your diet winter squash is

2077
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,560
really good Buttercup Butternut get

2078
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,560
those in there very important pumpkin is

2079
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,679
actually amazing for people you get

2080
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,360
pumpkin seeds are good too don't be

2081
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:41,080
afraid of pumpkin seeds they're very

2082
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:42,080
supportive for um for antiviral stuff

2083
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:45,320
because they do have a little bit of

2084
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:46,800
zinc in them and that's supportive but

2085
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,400
when it comes down to autoimmune you

2086
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,920
want the solid

2087
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:53,320
Basics you want to pull out the heavy

2088
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:55,719
metals you want cilantro an herb in your

2089
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:57,719
diet you want the Frozen wild

2090
01:23:55,719 --> 01:23:59,280
blueberries Frozen wild blueberries are

2091
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:00,880
a miracle on their own because they not

2092
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,239
only pull out heavy metals out of the

2093
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,719
brain and out of the liver and out of

2094
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:07,920
the body but Frozen wild blueberries the

2095
01:24:05,719 --> 01:24:10,679
wild blueberries not the cultivated kind

2096
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:13,199
the wild blueberries have antiviral

2097
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:15,920
Inhibitors in them that means

2098
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:18,960
phytochemicals that don't kill a virus

2099
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:21,280
necessarily but stop it from functioning

2100
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,920
dumbing it down that's the power of the

2101
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,639
wild blueberry and you want want to dumb

2102
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,920
down the viral issues you want to dumb

2103
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:29,320

it's going to change the game it's that

2127
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:17,920
important it's that

2128
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:21,080
critical so on on foods and different

2129
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:23,840
supplements herbs like rosemary thyme

2130
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:26,040
thyme tea is really good for any kind of

2131
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,520

don't be afraid of that rose hips rose

2133
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:33,560
hip tea great for autoimmune as well we

2134
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,440
talked about the liposomas that's

2135
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:37,800
important if you can't you know get the

2136
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:39,719
liposomas we'll do the

2137
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:42,360
Esty but you can do a little bit of

2138
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:44,880
liposomas C to get a little bit in you

2139
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:46,520
every day vitamin C improves your immune

2140
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,840
system we know that and improves the

2141
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:52,320
white count we know that but here's what

2142
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:55,480
else it does vitamin C helps pull out

2143
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:57,639
out all the poison that the viruses in

2144
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:00,239
the pathogens and even bacteria are

2145
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:02,159
creating all that poison that's creating

2146
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:04,600
rashes and dermato toxins creating

2147
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:06,119
butterfly rashes creating problems all

2148
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,840
all in the body creating fatigue

2149
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:09,920
neurological fatigue from all that

2150
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,119
neurotoxin all that poison that's

2151
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,880
involved with

2152
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:17,560
autoimmune and vitamin C helps grab on

2153
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:19,920
to that and and Pull It extracted out of

2154
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:22,320
the body pulling that poison out of the

2155
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,080
body you guys and getting it out of your

2156
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,560
system so vitamin C is really important

2157
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,840
and vitamin c does one more thing

2158
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:32,520
somebody doesn't know about one more

2159
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:36,239
thing it's starves a virus it gets in

2160
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:38,520
the way of a virus feeding on what it

2161
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:39,920
wants so let's go back to Foods if

2162
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,520
you're plant-based and you're on all

2163
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,880
fruits and vegetables it's incredible

2164
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,239
from when when you're dealing with

2165
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,080
autoimmune it's incredible so if you're

2166
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:49,000
somebody that's plant-based and you're

2167
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:51,360
worried that you're you're not getting

2168
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,960
enough protein don't go that direction

2169
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:55,239
realize that being plant-based is really

2170
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,800
helpful for autoimmune now if you're

2171
01:26:55,239 --> 01:26:58,400
somebody who's not plant-based and you

2172
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,840
have autoimmune and you're doing the

2173
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,119
animal products like I said keep away

2174
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,679
from dairy keep away from eggs keep your

2175
01:27:02,119 --> 01:27:06,280
you know keep at the highest quality

2176
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:08,920
leanest uh protein you can find animal

2177
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:11,159
protein you can find you know make sure

2178
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:13,320
you do that and keep it down to a

2179
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:15,440
minimum don't have protein three times a

2180
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:17,000
day unless it's the only thing you got

2181
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:20,000
and and you feel it's the only thing you

2182
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,679
can eat but the point is is try not to

2183
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,920
do it three times a day cuz you need to

2184
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:26,760
make room for those wild blueberries you

2185
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:30,000
need to make room for the wild blueberry

2186
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:32,000
smoothie you need to make room for the

2187
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,600
other Foods you need to make room for

2188
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,239
the lettuces which are incredible for

2189
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:38,320
autoimmune red leaf lettuce butterleaf

2190
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:40,719
lettuce that's amazing for autoimmune

2191
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:45,040
that alone right there

2192
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:46,360
radishes dear Lord I think I I think I

2193
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,080
heard from somebody that there's

2194
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:50,119
something out there that radishes are

2195
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,520
bad for autoimmune or radishes or bad

2196
01:27:50,119 --> 01:27:53,520
for thyroid or something like that I

2197
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:56,639
think it was bad for for thyroid that is

2198
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:59,520
absurd that is absolutely insane

2199
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:02,840
radishes are a miracle food the radish

2200
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:05,080
greens kill all viruses the radishes

2201
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:07,679
themselves push out poison out of the

2202
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:10,480
body the radishes themselves help heal

2203
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,480
thyroids all this is important so think

2204
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:15,639
about radishes make salads if you're

2205
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:18,320

partially in there too that's really a

2232
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:11,040
great great great thing to do think

2233

about some different fruits to try if

2234
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,960
you're afraid of fruit and you have

2235
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:16,000
fruit fear and you're trapped in the

2236
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:18,159
fruit fear because of the misinformation

2237
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,199

01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:04,639
sure that you have the salads going on

2255
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:07,159
and make sure you bring in some fruit

2256
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:09,040
somewhere in there just don't eat a big

2257
01:30:07,159 --> 01:30:11,159
fruit pie right after you had a big

2258
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:14,480
steak that doesn't really work that way

2259
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:15,719
make sure your steak is you know try

2260
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,920
well you know it's like you're not

2261
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:19,800
supposed to put a chocolate cake after

2262
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,480
after a steak either okay you're not

2263
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:24,880
supposed to put too much after a steak

2264
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:27,840
um just when I tell people if they eat a

2265
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:30,199
big old they be eat big old steak for

2266
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,840
dinner they should just be sipping tea

2267
01:30:30,199 --> 01:30:33,560
sipping tea for the rest of the night

2268
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,040
because you just you don't have a lot of

2269
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:38,280
room there's not a lot of room and with

2270
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:41,719
fruit it fruit has a lot of water

2271
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:43,360
content so you need more stomach space

2272
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:45,119
so you need more stomach space

2273
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,480
vegetables have water content so you

2274
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:49,719
need more stomach space I tell people

2275
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:51,880
keep your your proteins lean try to have

2276
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:53,800
4 ounces and then this way you can have

2277
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:55,920
room for a salad if you have 12 ounces

2278
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:58,159
of animal protein it's there's not a lot

2279
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,600
of stomach space for a salad salad takes

2280
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:02,719
a lot of space is what I'm saying it's

2281
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,400
high water content where is the medicine

2282
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:06,719
the medicine whether you're animal

2283
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,639
protein or your non-an animal protein

2284
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:10,560
the medicine is in the fruits and the

2285
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:11,880
vegetables always remember that and the

2286
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,600
leafy

2287
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:16,159
greens um and that's how you combat

2288
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,719
autoimmune and what you'll see now is

2289
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:20,440
the experts they've changed their their

2290
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:21,560
Foods they've changed their food laws 10

2291
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:24,360
years ago you wouldn't believe what it

2292
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:26,159
was like now you know their food laws

2293
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:28,840
are they have these healthy avocados in

2294
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:30,719
there coconut oil they have salads

2295
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,280
whether they like animal proteins or not

2296
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:34,679
and they're getting people results but

2297
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,760
let me tell you something it's even

2298
01:31:34,679 --> 01:31:38,400
though they're getting people some

2299
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,320
results this is the information you need

2300
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:43,960
this is the information you need to

2301
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:45,960
really conquer some serious problems to

2302
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:47,880
really conquer some serious autoimmune

2303
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,239
to understand it and what's going on and

2304
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:51,159
about the truth about your body not

2305
01:31:49,239 --> 01:31:53,040
attacking itself because this takes it

2306
01:31:51,159 --> 01:31:55,880
to a whole another level this is way

2307
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:58,400
more way more ahead of the curve this is

2308
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:01,480
way more ahead of the

2309
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:03,719
curve when you're driving you want to

2310
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:06,320
know what's in front of you you want to

2311
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:08,080
know what's around the corner you don't

2312
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:10,840
want to just be driving

2313
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:13,040
blind you don't you don't want to drive

2314
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:16,320
blind it's one thing you don't want to

2315
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:18,520
do and that's what this is about this is

2316
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:21,199
about being armed this is about being

2317
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:23,639
armed with truth with knowledge this is

2318
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:25,760
about having a shield this is about

2319
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:27,719
having information that's powerful this

2320
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,960
is about this is about knowing what's

2321
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:31,520
around the bend so you can actually

2322
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,000
what's around the bend so you can

2323
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,960
actually protect your family your

2324
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:41,480
children yourself so you're not driving

2325
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:44,040
blind so you can see so you can

2326
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:45,880
see and seeing is important when it

2327
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:47,199
comes down to healing and seeing what's

2328
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,199
going on behind

2329
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,679
autoimmune and seeing what's happened

2330
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:52,239
with it all make sure you get other

2331
01:32:50,679 --> 01:32:54,360
berries into your diet too make sure you

2332
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:56,320
get the raspberries make sure you get

2333
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:58,600
the if if you only have conventional

2334
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,880
blueberries if you only have the big old

2335
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,560
I call them the big old silly

2336
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:03,320

some walnuts these are all good foods

2401
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:18,719
they don't feed the viruses that cause

2402
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:21,679
autoimmune you can have them in there

2403
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:24,239
but make sure you got the leafy greens

2404
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:27,360

2405
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:29,920
diet dandelion greens really great for

2406
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:31,560
autoimmune they help with the liver they

2407
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,679
push out poisons that create all the

2408
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,520
different autoimmune symptoms so Danny

2409
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:38,119
lion

2410
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:40,199
greens I still call it autoimmune in a

2411
01:35:38,119 --> 01:35:41,920
sense of saying autoimmune you guys know

2412
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:43,840
the truth about it right now you

2413
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:45,840
understand right now what's going on I

2414
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:48,280
mean I still use the term because

2415
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:52,400
everybody knows it by that

2416
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:54,600
term but really you know it should be

2417
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:57,320
called called something else it should

2418
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:59,600
be called virus immune not autoimmune it

2419
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:01,719
should be called virus immune I talk

2420
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:03,480
about that in the thyroid healing book

2421
01:36:01,719 --> 01:36:06,280
you guys I promise you this book isn't

2422
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:07,880
just like a concept and a couple hundred

2423
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:09,679
pages and you read it and you put it

2424
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:13,320
down and that's it that's not what this

2425
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:17,199
is this is packed jam-packed with so

2426
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:19,119
much truth I talk about the th if you

2427
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:21,600
don't have a thyroid anymore you can

2428
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:22,800
still heal they can still heal if you

2429
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,159
don't have a thyroid anymore I talk

2430
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,239
about if your thyroids been killed off

2431
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:28,760
radioactive the Isotopes radioactive

2432
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:30,960
iodine or if your vir if you had your

2433
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:33,920
thyroid removed that there's still

2434
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:35,520
tissue left in your that's left because

2435
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,159
they can't remove all your thyroid and

2436
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:39,080
it's still working for you and I talk

2437
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:40,400
about the Undiscovered hormones science

2438
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,600
of research has discovered that the

2439
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:44,560
thyroid produces that's only in thyroid

2440
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:46,800
healing and those undiscovered hormones

2441
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,239
are in what's left over in tissue if you

2442
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,719
had your thyroid removed and still

2443
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:52,000
communicate with the

2444
01:36:49,719 --> 01:36:54,360
body so you can still still heal even

2445
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,040
when you're missing a thyroid even when

2446
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:59,080
you're missing half your thyroid or your

2447
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:01,280
thyroid was removed you can still heal

2448
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:03,040
and here's the thing all in all it's the

2449
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,360
virus that caused the thyroid problem to

2450
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:06,840
begin with and that's what's giving you

2451
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:09,280
your symptoms anyway so we go after the

2452
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:10,920
upstein bar that caused your virus to

2453
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,960
have a that caused your thyroid to have

2454
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:15,080
a problem for it to be removed so you

2455
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,280
can still heal I can't tell you how many

2456
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:19,159
people over the years that were missing

2457
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,480
a thyroid that had all their symptoms

2458
01:37:19,159 --> 01:37:21,639
and the doctor be like well because

2459
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,280
you're missing a thyro thyroid you're

2460
01:37:21,639 --> 01:37:25,000
still going to have all these symptoms

2461
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:27,800
we got rid of all the symptoms as if

2462
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,639
they didn't even have a thyroid problem

2463
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:33,040
anymore because it was something else

2464
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:34,320
something else that nobody knows and

2465
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,719
that's what this is all about with

2466
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,320
autoimmune it's like that with all

2467
01:37:35,719 --> 01:37:40,440
autoimmune it's something else in there

2468
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:43,040
that nobody knows about in research and

2469
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:46,239
science so if you're missing your

2470
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:49,080
thyroid you still have a way to heal and

2471
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:51,760
all these foods and supplements matter

2472
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:55,920
when it comes down to that

2473
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:58,639
um MSM a high quality MSM um that's also

2474
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:01,880
really important so high quality MSM

2475
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:03,880
that's important for um um for any kind

2476
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:05,840
of autoimmune a little bit of that is a

2477
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,360
good thing silica that's an important

2478
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,320
supplement for any kind of autoimmune

2479
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,560
that people are going through silica is

2480
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:13,599
really

2481
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:16,639
important that's a great one so always

2482
01:38:13,599 --> 01:38:19,520
you know consider that licorice licorice

2483
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:22,159
is very anti- epscene bar very

2484
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:27,040
antiviral excuse me licorice can really

2485
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:28,560
help knock out and kill off um viruses

2486
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,719
so licorice can actually really knock

2487
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:33,800
off and kill off viruses it's

2488
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:36,199
really uh you know an

2489
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:37,719
antiviral in one of the greatest senses

2490
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:40,119
so you know you can try some licorice

2491
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:42,080
too it's fantastic for so many different

2492
01:38:40,119 --> 01:38:45,480
varieties of of

2493
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:49,159
autoimmune lysine lysine a basic

2494
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:50,880
Foundation a foundational amino acid

2495
01:38:49,159 --> 01:38:54,960
which hinders and stops the herpetic

2496
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:57,320
family family viruses Len alone I've

2497
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,760
seen get rid of so many different

2498
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:01,320
symptoms and people that are dealing

2499
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:02,880
with mystery autoimmune with different

2500
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:06,159
labels and everything else attached to

2501
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:08,400
it so elene is another thing to consider

2502
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:10,000
too along the way you can take a little

2503
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,040
bit of it even if you took some vitamin

2504
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,599
C consistently every day a decent amount

2505
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:15,840
of it if you wanted to lysine a decent

2506
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:17,400
amount of it you can up your dosage you

2507
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,440
can talk to your doctor you can up it

2508
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,760
very

2509
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:23,960
high lysine

2510
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,480
and you got the vitamin C you got a

2511
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:26,920
little bit of licorice you got a little

2512
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:28,920
bit of

2513
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:31,560
zinc and some of the other things we

2514
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:33,880
talked about and the methyl cabalin

2515
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,159
dinos cobalamin B12 we talked about and

2516
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:37,760
you have some of the different things

2517
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:39,440
you're already building your foundation

2518
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:42,119
powerful

2519
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:45,040
Foundation to turning the tide you're

2520
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:46,520
attaching that powerful Foundation along

2521
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:48,679
with the truth about what you now know

2522
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:50,719
about autoimmune and what your body's

2523
01:39:48,679 --> 01:39:52,280
really doing for you and how it stands

2524
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:56,440
behind you and it's not trying to harm

2525
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:56,440
you or hurt you and it's there for you

2526
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:04,440
100% And that's the power of how it

2527
01:40:01,159 --> 01:40:06,760
works so other Foods zucchini is really

2528
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:09,440
good summer squash is really good very

2529
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:11,159
good for autoimmune keep those in there

2530
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:13,800
you know like incorporate these wherever

2531
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:15,800
you can steam cooked vegetables are fine

2532
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:17,480
that's good too you don't have to be raw

2533
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:20,719
steam cooked vegetables are good if you

2534
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:23,480
really like those that can work if you

2535
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:26,719
are are afraid of grains because the

2536
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:29,639
world's anti-rain right now but you want

2537
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:34,400
grains or you still eat grains keep it

2538
01:40:29,639 --> 01:40:37,520
to Millet and quinoa Millet and quinoa

2539
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:39,400
those are the two that are the least

2540
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,239
antagonistic see what happens is that

2541
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:44,639
all grains have been lumped together as

2542
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:46,080
being Sinister because what alternate

2543
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:49,360
practitioners are discovering is that

2544
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:51,400
the gluten is is is is uh worsening

2545
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:53,800
symptoms in people so so they find that

2546
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,760
gluten is worsening symptoms in people

2547
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,119
so they think gluten is the responsible

2548
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,639
they don't realize that gluten is

2549
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:00,880
feeding a virus or a pathogen that's

2550
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:02,679
causing the person to have their

2551
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,800
symptoms conditions their rashes there

2552
01:41:02,679 --> 01:41:07,639
whatever is going on so then they deem

2553
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,440
all grains

2554
01:41:07,639 --> 01:41:13,840
Sinister so it's an anti-rain

2555
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:16,880
world now I don't like a lot of grains

2556
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:18,960
what I'm saying is if your symptoms you

2557
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,520
know if you're not severely autoimmune

2558
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,119
symptom you know symptomatic where

2559
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:24,880
you're getting so you're so viral you're

2560
01:41:22,119 --> 01:41:26,599
not so viral immune that's what I'd

2561
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:30,080
rather call it really you guys is viral

2562
01:41:26,599 --> 01:41:32,719
immune you're not so viral immune then

2563
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:34,599
you can do probably quinoa you can do

2564
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:36,560
probably a really good steel cut oat

2565
01:41:34,599 --> 01:41:40,119
maybe you could Pro meaning if if you

2566
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:43,080
like that you can do um some

2567
01:41:40,119 --> 01:41:44,320
Millet as a possibility and you can try

2568
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:46,360
those incorporate those if you really

2569
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:48,239
want have those with vegetables and so

2570
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:50,360
forth and that could be okay you can

2571
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:52,320
also get away with some black beans you

2572
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:55,800
can also get get away with some lentils

2573
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:58,159
so lentils and black beans so those two

2574
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,760
are good things too so whether you eat

2575
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:01,159
animal protein or you don't eat animal

2576
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:04,199
protein whatever you know whether you're

2577
01:42:01,159 --> 01:42:06,400
vegan vegetarian or you eat you know uh

2578
01:42:04,199 --> 01:42:09,719
animal protein you can incorporate these

2579
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,320
in if you're really viral IM immune you

2580
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:12,840
know you don't have to bring these in

2581
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:15,159
you bring in more fruits and vegetables

2582
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:18,440
and be better but these are still a

2583
01:42:15,159 --> 01:42:21,440
