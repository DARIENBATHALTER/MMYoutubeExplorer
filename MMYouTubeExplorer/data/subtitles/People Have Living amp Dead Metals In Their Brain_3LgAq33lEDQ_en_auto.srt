00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,759
migraines and headaches and migraines

368
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,360
and

369
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,040
headaches I say that over and over again

370
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,959
because people go from migraines to

371
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,360
headaches to headaches to bad migraines

372
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,480
back to migraines to headaches and they

373
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
live with their headache and then turns

374
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,399
into a big migraine

375
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,360
again and then there's people with all

376
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,600
kinds of skin conditions they got eczema

377
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,199
really bad and psoriasis really bad and

378
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,519
other types of skin conditions too and

379
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:41,399
Vio as well and then there's the people

380
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,040
that are emotionally and mentally

381
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,480
struggling like there's a battle in

382
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,759
their mind and a battle in their head

383
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,120
and they got the

384
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,639
OCD and the dep personalization where

385
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,079
they're so disconnected and they feel

386
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,000
numb but they don't know why and then

387
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,880
there's people who feel like they have a

388
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,480
decent life my life is good my life can

389
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,600
be better

390
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:06,079
I want to be productive my life is is is

391
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,959
going good but I am disconnected and

392
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,439
numb numb and I don't feel anything

393
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,079
there's so bunch of people that just

394
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,319
don't feel

395
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,799
anything where they're just like they

396
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:22,280
don't feel anything nothing excites them

397
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,240
nothing feeds into passion or turns into

398
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,280
passion nothing they can't even find

399
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,080
compassion they have it somewhere they

400
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,720
can't even find compassion for for

401
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,280
someone or for something that's

402
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,360
happening at there they can't find

403
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,760
compassion because they're so numb and

404
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,679
they're they're so disconnected they

405
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,880
feel they have this deep

406
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,520
depersonalization that they can't they

407
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,480
can't connect and they can't make that

408
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,520
connection and bypass it they can't

409
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,760
overcome it and they can't supersede it

410
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,520
and they live with it and they wake up

411
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,559
the morning and it's back to that again

412
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,320
they're numb they wake up in the morning

413
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,320
and they're disconnected and numb and

414
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,799
it's back to that every single day they

415
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,400
go to bed depressed and sad or they get

416
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:09,640
angry as the night goes on do you know

417
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,760
any of those

418
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,799
people as the night goes on something

419
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,640
can trigger them and they get

420
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,919
angry or

421
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,760
angrier here it is midnight and they're

422
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:27,840
angry now and they can't shake it before

423
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,520
they go to bed anybody ever seen that or

424
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,000
gone through that or over there says on

425
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,200
YouTube is profuse sweating from weak

426
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,280
adrenals or Metals let's get into that a

427
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,880
little bit you see this right here why

428
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,159
is this

429
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,200
here oh why is this

430
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,559
here because I was going to talk about

431
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,640
how toxic heavy metals weaken adrenals

432
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,880
because they put pressure on the nervous

433
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,880
system forcing the adrenals to react all

434
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,919
the time creating a sweating problem for

435
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,799
a lot of people hyperhydrosis

436
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:07,880
bunch of sweating problem profuse

437
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:10,640
sweating yes also adrenaline surges

438
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,640
happening all the time heart rate

439
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,799
increasing happening all the time toxic

440
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,559
heavy metals inside the brain can make

441
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:24,080
it so it's putting stress on the central

442
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,400
nervous system causing

443
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,360
problems causing

444
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,640
problems stress on the nervous system

445
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,400
causing

446
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,679
problems making it so the adrenals are

447
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,600
pumping too much so the adrenals are

448
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,799
cranked up too

449
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,159
much so what happens with a lot of

450
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:47,159
people they get this nervousness from

451
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:50,120
the toxic heavy metals the nervosus all

452
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:53,120
all falls into adrenals pumping like

453
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:57,200
crazy adrenaline pouring

454
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:00,280
out pouring out every day feet sweating

455
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,000
hands sweating it's not even just that

456
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,000
heart going a little

457
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,720
faster okay let's get into it a little

458
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,000
bit the battle in our

459
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,360
brains your brain is

460
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,520
electricity and within that

461
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,640
electricity we have

462
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,200
obstacles a lot of people have a lot of

463
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,159
obstacles to to overcome with

464
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,880
electricity in the brain let's hit it

465
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,880
for a second

466
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:31,159
here put a little board right do a

467
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,400
little brain stuff really quick okay you

468
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,400
guys let's get a brain

469
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,480
going all

470
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,960
right get a little bit of a mid midline

471
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:48,520
Canal okay and then we got a

472
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:53,280
brain instant brain here we

473
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:56,039
go okay we got our brain let's go let's

474
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,919
get some metal deposits can you see this

475
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:02,559
got a metal deposit Mercury a aluminum

476
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:07,159
cadmium lead

477
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:08,600
arsenic copper copper is a bad one real

478
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,840
real bad

479
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,440
one it is okay we got electricity

480
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,559
running through the

481
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,799
brain electricity runs through the brain

482
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,919
see this you

483
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:26,080
guys okay electricity is energy it

484
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,799
radiates off your

485
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,919
head electricity in your brain has

486
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,840
energy radiating off your head that's

487
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,679
why this electricity is radiating

488
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,440
somewhere out here you see

489
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:44,080
this okay here's a metal deposit here's

490
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:48,080
an electrical impulse here it is

491
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:52,360
electricity boom it hit the metal

492
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:56,640
deposit right there short circuit

493
00:21:52,360 --> 00:22:00,039
happens and then the adrenals so let's

494
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,279
get some adrenals going really quick

495
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,279
all

496
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,960
right then we got some adrenals down

497
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,960
here you guys see

498
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,679
this right

499
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:17,600
electricity hits the metal

500
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:20,279
deposit the neurons are under stress a

501
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,520
signal goes to the

502
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:26,679
adrenals here the adrenals are and then

503
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,520
the adrenals release

504
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,520
adrenaline there it is

505
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,279
Metals in the brain can cause anxiety

506
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:41,080
fear panic panic

507
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:44,720
attacks depression

508
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,480
anxiousness all in one go or even just

509
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,799
little bits and pieces of that from

510
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:55,520
toxic heavy metals in the

511
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:58,120
brain toxic heavy metal aluminum Mercury

512
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,200
electrical electricity running through

513
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,919
the brain

514
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,720
hits the copper deposit yep copper

515
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,480
deposit you see this puts stress on all

516
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,360
the neurons and gleo

517
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,880
cells and then the adrenals release more

518
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,360
adrenaline do you guys see this there it

519
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,600
is okay and that's just

520
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,880
something that happens right there

521
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,600
that's just something that

522
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,760
happens all

523
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,440
right we're going to hit something

524
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,840
really serious

525
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,919
here

526
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,039
living

527
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:37,720
Metal Dead

528
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:39,840
metal living Metal Dead

529
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:44,760
metal in your

530
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,400
brain lies living Metals metals that are

531
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,840
alive

532
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,679
vital soft

533
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,679
metals good

534
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:58,440
Metals even tiny

535
00:23:53,679 --> 00:24:02,440
traces of heavy metal that's not toxic

536
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:07,799
toic it's in Trace forms like

537
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:11,919
gold gold inside our brains tiny Trace

538
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:15,200
forms of gold that come from our food

539
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,200
sources and Gold's a heavy metal that

540
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,200
resides in our

541
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,600
brain but it's a living

542
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,880
metal it's coming from the food we grow

543
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,080
it's in its Trace form and it's a living

544
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,159
metal and then

545
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,399
you have dead Metals industrialized

546
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,880
Metals copper that was industrialized

547
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:40,440
Mercury that was industrialized aluminum

548
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,320
that was industrialized people say he

549
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,320
doesn't know what he's talking about

550
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:49,799
aluminum is not a heavy metal it's

551
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,960
light i s first of all since science is

552
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,440
taking lots of medical medium

553
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,559
information for instance right long flu

554
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,559
you guys years ago I did a video all

555
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,320
about how the flu can knock the immune

556
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,320
system down creating chronic illness

557
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,760
long after the flu is gone and I talked

558
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,520
all about that the medical medium

559
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,880
information by the way and now science

560
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,880
is doing articles they're talking about

561
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,440
it where it's long flu right they just

562
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,440
took it from medical medium that's just

563
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,640
one example life expectancy I

564
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:26,559
predicted Spirit of compassion

565
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,039
did predict it that we were dropping in

566
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,320
life expectancy the numbers were

567
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:33,960
dropping dropping the years someone

568
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,919
lives was dropping everybody ignored it

569
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,520
out there the industry science all of it

570
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,760
ignored it they thought we were living

571
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,840
longer and that the expectancy was going

572
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,559
longer and longer turns out they're

573
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,360
wrong so they went to Medical meme

574
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,240
information published information they

575
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:53,480
remove the part where life expectancy is

576
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,480
dropping so because of this and long flu

577
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,760
is in medical medium book one by the

578
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,799
way right here the new

579
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,679
addition because of this science keeps

580
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,880
on stealing and robbing information from

581
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,679
medical medium books including the cause

582
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,440
of multiple sceris which is epen

583
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:14,720
bar so what happened

584
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,640
was Spirit of compassion deemed aluminum

585
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,039
Heavy

586
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,799
Metal the reason why is because of the

587
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:23,640
extensive damage it does in someone's

588
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,760
life for one too much aluminum in the

589
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,760
brain can cause a problem creating a

590
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,279
situation where their body doesn't

591
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,240
function like it should creating a

592
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,240
situation where people feel like their

593
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,799
legs are made out of lead and their body

594
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,399
can barely

595
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,200
function it's heavy damage substantial

596
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:44,960
damage on people's body and

597
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,720
brains all kinds of different issues in

598
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,840
the brain that people have different

599
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,240
conditions they have because of aluminum

600
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,559
aluminum is dangerous when it sits

601
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,559
inside of our brain and

602
00:26:53,559 --> 00:27:00,039
corrodes and outp

603
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,799
pockets and leeches

604
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:06,880
so medical me books have deemed aluminum

605
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,120
a toxic heavy metal versus a light metal

606
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,000
because of the substantial damage it

607
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,039
does and probably 5 years from now or

608
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,600
seven years from now they're just going

609
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:17,840
to call it a toxic heavy metal which I

610
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,440
actually saw they've already done that

611
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,159
recently anyway the whole point I'm

612
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,440
trying to say is that we have living

613
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,320
Metals inside of our head and we have

614
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,399
dead Metals inside of our head and these

615
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,000
dead

616
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:33,679
Metals interact and they battle the

617
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,520
living

618
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:42,159
Metals so we have metals that are useful

619
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,399
in their form they're soft

620
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,519
Metals they're heavy

621
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,399
metals but we have them in Trace forms

622
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,240
from our

623
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:55,080
food and they actually sit inside of our

624
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,240
brain and they help to make up a

625
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,399
neurotransmitter they help to support a

626
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,640
neurotransmitter and they help to feed

627
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,640
and keep alive neurons and allow neurons

628
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,240
to have electricity run through them so

629
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,760
here's how it

630
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,760
works

631
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,480
okay if you

632
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:17,720
have right if you have a

633
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,080
neuron right here there's lots of

634
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,399
neurons in our brain you guys all know

635
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,399
that you have a neuron so I'm just

636
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:27,120
making a big

637
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:29,320
neuron okay if that

638
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,039
neuron

639
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,799
if that neuron is

640
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:37,159
filled with living

641
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:39,840
Metals soft Metals heavy metals but

642
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,559
living metals that come from your food

643
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,880
supply if you got living Metals in here

644
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,919
in this neuron that neuron is going to

645
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,960
do this when electricity goes to it

646
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,919
ready here's electricity again here we

647
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,640
go there's an electricity right here it

648
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,559
is Boom it hit that neuron that neuron's

649
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,919
packed with living Metals it hits the

650
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,440
neuron the neuron takes that

651
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,200
electricity places information on that

652
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,279
electrical impulse travels to another

653
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,120
neuron that is also filled with all

654
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,320
these living Metals the living metals

655
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,960
are the conductors they're the

656
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,200
conductors of that electricity inside

657
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,039
the neuron so they can travel with

658
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:25,159
information from neuron to neuron but

659
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:27,640
when our neurons are lacking living

660
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:30,039
metals and they're filled with dead

661
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,720
metals

662
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,159
that's when we're in really big trouble

663
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,120
when they're filled with dead Metals so

664
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,640
what happens when these neurons are

665
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,159
filled with dead metal so let's make a

666
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,360
neuron and we'll put a nice big neuron

667
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,559
right here nice big neuron right there

668
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,200
put one here

669
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:52,600
too all right the neuron is filled with

670
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,480
dead Metals copper Mercury aluminum

671
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,880
arsenic lead

672
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,799
cadmium there's more but we could sit

673
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,640
here all

674
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:04,720
day okay here they are dead metals are

675
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,720
in here get ready when the electricity

676
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,000
heads their way electricity is heading

677
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,279
its way here it is electrical impulse

678
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,120
that's your life force electricity in

679
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,840
your brain here it goes it's going to

680
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,399
hit a neuron neurons filled with all

681
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,279
these dead Metals

682
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:25,080
boom it's like hitting a brick

683
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:28,919
wall and then you're

684
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,799
like I just don't feel good something's

685
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:34,600
off I better make another doctor's

686
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,360
appointment I better sign up to this

687
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,760
course that says they're going to cure

688
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,840
you of every disease for

689
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,640
$5,000 I better just go see this I

690
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,720
better go see this person I better fly

691
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,840
around the world and dip myself in some

692
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,600
crazy hot spring somewhere but something

693
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,200
happens where you just you're just like

694
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,840
something's wrong with me 50 doctors

695
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,159
later nobody knew that you had

696
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,679
a

697
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:07,600
neuron you had nerve

698
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:10,519
cells and they were filled with dead

699
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,519
metals and when the electricity hit the

700
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,159
the the neuron with all those dead

701
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:15,159
Metals in

702
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:21,639
there problems occurred it was like

703
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:26,399
hitting a brick a stone

704
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:28,440
wall see alridge 741 so when they say

705
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,919
lesions are on your brain are they

706
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,120
seeing heavy metal

707
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,440
deposits all right let's go into the a

708
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,039
little

709
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,360
bit when they when they see lesions on

710
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:42,320
the brain they don't know what they're

711
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,200
seeing they could be Heavy Metal

712
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,919
deposits that have been um leeching

713
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,600
causing tissue damage gal cell damage

714
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,919
and so forth brain tissue damage it

715
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,760
could be an MSG deposit you know many

716
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,279
people have MSG deposits in their brain

717
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,600
it leaves all kinds of marks now and

718
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,919
these better

719
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,360
MRIs and the way they scan brains now

720
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,799
they're starting to see stuff all the

721
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,440
time I called this shot a long time ago

722
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:13,000
they're seeing all kinds of different

723
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,600
white spots dark spots brown spots gray

724
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,559
spots and I talk about it I have a whole

725
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,639
chapter in it in brainsaver right here

726
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,840
so if you guys want to know what book

727
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:24,039
I'm in I'm in brainsaver make sure you

728
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,960
get this book amazon.com us go to the

729
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,519
library get it for free whatever but

730
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,159
that's the book right there bring the

731
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,039
information to your doctor ask your

732
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,000
doctor if it's right for you take the

733
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:35,600
book to your doctor show your doctor

734
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,080
whatever you're looking at in here

735
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,559
including the protocols but it's very in

736
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,559
depth about toxic heavy metals

737
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,039
extremely

738
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,799
comprehensive really really

739
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:51,480
comprehensive a lot of people have MSG

740
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,480
deposits in their

741
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,639
brain a lot of people have salt deposits

742
00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:00,360
in their brain you ready for this all

743
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:03,120
that excess salt people are eating they

744
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,200
eat so much salt a lot of the road salt

745
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,880
they eat because they're at restaurants

746
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,720
and they think it's a healthy meal and

747
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,799
there's a lot of road salt meaning

748
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,519
really cheap processed

749
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:18,039
salt and even if you overdo it with like

750
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,440
too much of the higher quality salts and

751
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:22,039
you're overdoing it it's got to go

752
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,320
somewhere you

753
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:28,720
guys it can become like a salty soup

754
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,399
inside your body and then your liver

755
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,200
can't handle that much

756
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,159
salt and yeah your bile can't handle

757
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,919
that much salt your HCL can't handle

758
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,880
that much salt you have so much salt in

759
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,159
you this isn't like celery juice that's

760
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,960
different that's an entirely different

761
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,919
sodium right and then you got all this

762
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,080
salt in you but high concentrations of

763
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,320
it because you wouldn't believe how much

764
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,080
salt you can throw on food it's insane

765
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,679
how much salt you can just bury in food

766
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,279
restaurant food they pack it in Salt

767
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,760
right pizzas packed in salt took all the

768
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,039
salt off the pizza you'd be like why am

769
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,519
I eating this You' be like this is

770
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:07,080
terrible that's how much salt is on a

771
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,440
pizza so what happens is salt deposits

772
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,399
grow and they collect inside the brain

773
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,800
and they

774
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,240
crystallize and crystallizations from

775
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,639
salt deposits show up on the MRIs and

776
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,800
they're like what is this they don't

777
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,879
know and they're not going to cut your

778
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,280
brain in half they're not going to say

779
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:22,760
we're going to experiment and cut your

780
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,520
brain in half and we're going to go try

781
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,879
to find out what this is and they're not

782
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,599
going to go and look for that salt

783
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:31,280
deposit that MSG deposit salt deposit or

784
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,440
that scar tissue or that

785
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,879
calcification that's another thing too

786
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,399
we're on such acidic diets that we lose

787
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,240
so much calcium out of our bones the

788
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:45,240
calcium ends up hoarding inside brain

789
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,839
tissue and becomes

790
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,040
calcifications and then we get an MRI

791
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:54,280
when we're in our

792
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,720
50s 40s or 6s and on the MRI there's

793
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,040
this calcification they don't even know

794
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,960
what it is they're like we don't know

795
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,240
what this is Mr

796
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,920
Jones and you have this calcification

797
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,160
that's in the brain it's a

798
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,599
calcification it's

799
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,040
calcium that had nowhere to go that

800
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:14,320
leeched out of your bones that stored up

801
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,760
in the brain tissue you can have you can

802
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,440
be someone that has literally like it's

803
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,240
it's a whole smor sporg of all these

804
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,240
different spots in your brain from an

805
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,760
MRI you can have brown spots in the

806
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,320
crystallizations you could have white

807
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,480
spots you could have what looks like

808
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,839
Crystal

809
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,599
you all this stuff and then lesions what

810
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:37,160
looks like lesions dark spots black

811
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:41,720
spots and it's like MSG deposit sodium

812
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:45,079
deposit yeah calcification Scar Tissue

813
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,520
Mercury and copper that's that's how

814
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:50,720
crazy it is right

815
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,560
there so we got these dead Metals we got

816
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,800
these living Metals but there's a battle

817
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,800
that

818
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,119
happens yeah

819
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
okay now if your brain is full of

820
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,200
electrical currents what must be

821
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,599
involved Metals that's right so good

822
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,240
metals like I said they're part of the

823
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,040
electrical currents but what happens is

824
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,400
these good Metals include these

825
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:19,000
beneficial non-industrialized forms of

826
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,440
gold calcium copper calcium soft metal

827
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,920
copper pottassium but the good stuff

828
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:29,000
from our Foods magnesium chromium

829
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,079
padium right and more one reason these

830
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,960
beneficial metals are Theirs to control

831
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,680
electrical currents so we have all these

832
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,319
crazy minerals that are living metals

833
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,160
that reside in our neurons inside our

834
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:43,040
brain and they're there to protect us

835
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,400
because that's how our electricity just

836
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,960
swims along right it's incredible Rogue

837
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,480
toxic heavy metals residing in our brain

838
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,440
with the good Metals wreak havoc they

839
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,640
create a battle in our brains and that

840
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,079
battle can be like the battle we have in

841
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,599
our mind I hate myself I don't trust

842
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,760
myself you know I can't stop these

843
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:07,760
impulsive actions I know I have good

844
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,160
intentions but I'm suffering and people

845
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,079
think I have bad intentions I got so

846
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,000
much fear I can't get out I'm just lost

847
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,240
I got sadness coming out from the pit of

848
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,400
my gut and I don't know what it is or

849
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,240
what why I'm so sad I don't do anything

850
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,800
right I can't get anything

851
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,520
done and it's just this battle in our

852
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,200
brains right there it's good medals and

853
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,440
bad metals and it's this battle that's

854
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:39,079
happening from having this in our

855
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,240
brain yeah which one of your books are

856
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:43,480
you working with right now I think Mary

857
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,040
said I'm working with brain saver right

858
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,880
here okay I know I don't put there's no

859
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,480

be my own Advertiser okay here you go

867
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,319
you got the brain saver right

868
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,119
there these are the toxic heavy metal

869
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:15,760
books right here brain saver and the

870
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,839
protocols books you should have these

871
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,560
right

872
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,119

clear podcast listening without a bunch

875
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:32,720
of commercial on there I just that's how

876
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,200
I feel okay by the way medical medum

877
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,520
podcast at Apple podcast I just want to

878
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,200
tell you there's a food poisoning

879
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,680
episode on there underrated food

880
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,560
poisoning is undercovered food poisoning

881
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,680
under

882
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,480
appreciated under respected food

883
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,640
poisoning is under reported and

884
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,119
underrated so what people don't realize

885
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,119
with food poisoning is it's killing

886
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,040
people every single day out there people

887
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,359
aren't being worn

888
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,720
they're not being warned they're not

889
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,640
being educated about food poisoning it's

890
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,000
like Russian Roulette out there it's

891
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,560
like ticking time bombs out there people

892
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,280
go into restaurants and yes they can die

893
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,400
how many people have died from food

894
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,720
poisoning a year a lot you couldn't even

residing in the brain with the good

917
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,480
Metals wreak havoc they create a battle

918
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,720
in our brains a battle in our mind I

919
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,800
can't wait to read one thing to you

920

00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,119
okay bad Metals ready

976
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,440
evil

977
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,440

00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,079
good right

979
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:17,000
there

980
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:20,160
okay on a physical level there is good

981
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,359
versus evil inside our

982
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,839
brain you don't think that can play a

983
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:24,839
role in

984
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:32,359
anything it can play a massive role is

985
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,720
it possible that when metals are so bad

986
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:37,400
in somebody's brain they go and they

987
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:42,839
stab 10

988
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:45,720
people is it possible metals are so off

989
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:49,559
putting in a bad way in somebody's

990
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:52,520
brain where they do something that they

991
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:58,599
no one thought they would ever

992
00:43:52,520 --> 00:44:00,000
do is it possible that metals

993
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,760
in somebody's

994
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,440
brain right the good and evil battle

995
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,440
that's happening can get somebody to

996
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,680
hate

997
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:15,760
themselves

998
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:20,119
terribly H despise themselves yes

999
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:23,520
definitely because what you have is good

1000
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:26,520
versus evil industrialized

1001
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,559
Metals right here Mercury aluminum

1002
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,200
copper

1003
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:30,800
that got into us through all kinds of

1004
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,760
different Avenues including Pharm

1005
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:39,160
pharmaceutical exposure to our waterways

1006
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,160
to the trails falling out of the

1007
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,480
sky

1008
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:48,960
evil and then good Metals trace minerals

1009
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:52,920
from our foods from celery juice from

1010
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,559
the heavy metal detox trace minerals and

1011
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,319
our food that we

1012
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:02,000
eat right there

1013
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,920
Encompass good and then Mercury

1014
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,760
aluminum cadmium lead copper

1015
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,680
industrialized that got into our body in

1016
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,240
ways that it's not supposed to but it

1017
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:16,000
did and it got in here

1018
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:20,160
evil short circuits neurons and you got

1019
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:24,079
OCD OCD can create

1020
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,480
thoughts that don't stop making somebody

1021
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:30,680
literally suffer a terrifying suffer

1022
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,800
u a suffering people can't explain or

1023
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,760
understand unless they've gone through

1024
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,960
it themselves with OCD alone and then

1025
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,520
same thing with bipolar being like okay

1026
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:43,200
for one minute and then feeling so lost

1027
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:47,119
and sick and feeling so like so sick in

1028
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,319
their body the feeling of being so ill

1029
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:53,240
and then feeling better for a minute and

1030
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:55,400
then not feeling better and then

1031
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,160
depression anxiety

1032
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,599
attacks because that industrialized

1033
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,240
metal right there am I yelling loud

1034
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,800
enough that industrialized metal right

1035
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,200
there is causing

1036
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:12,680
pain and that's the

1037
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:14,599
evil yep the Mercury demon and so forth

1038
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,559
and then the good is the minerals we got

1039
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:21,640
to get inside our brain to sustain us

1040
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:25,440
and someday override so that the Battle

1041
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:28,119
of evil and good is not so much of a

1042
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,480
thing where it's less and less and this

1043
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:34,400
battle is not

1044
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,839
so massive it becomes a little battle

1045
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,800
instead and a little battle because the

1046
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:40,520
more good minerals you have right here

1047
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,760
the

1048
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,760
battle you

1049
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,559
win Terry Johnson dead medals would be a

1050
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,640
great name for a rock

1051
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,760
band it

1052
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,839
would I wouldn't doubt it if there

1053
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,359
wasn't one out there at some point in

1054
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,400
time

1055
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,559
throughout our history I know the

1056
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,079
Grateful Dead is one that uses the dead

1057
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:04,680
and I know there's a lot of metal bands

1058
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:07,880
out

1059
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:11,559
there okay so check this

1060
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:14,040
out it's a physical battle going on

1061
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:16,040
inside our brain on top of the battle of

1062
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,760
Life on this planet it's the problem

1063
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:21,920
that was never meant to be here was what

1064
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,559
you see right here this battle right

1065
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,559
here was never meant to be here on

1066
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,599
planet Earth is it somewhere else on

1067
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,200
another

1068
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,599
planet is there another planet out there

1069
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,520
where there's a

1070
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,880
humanoid

1071
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,839
species civilization on another planet

1072
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,960
out there in the

1073
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:45,119
galaxy in the universe or in some Galaxy

1074
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,040
in some solar system is there another

1075
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:52,240
planet that's harboring a species of

1076
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,680
people are they battling the same thing

1077
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,119
is evil on their Planet making sure

1078
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:00,559
Metals get into everything from children

1079
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:04,079
to everyone to women is there an evil

1080
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:06,520
evil doer Force hierarchy illumination

1081
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,040
somewhere on another planet doing this

1082
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,319
to those people and those humanoids

1083
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,400
versus here or is it just here it's

1084
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,319
question I've asked Spirit of compassion

1085
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,920
and I do have the

1086
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:23,000
answer over there on

1087
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:25,680
IG lady bear says is there any way to

1088
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,960
test to see how much of good medals and

1089
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,079
bad Metals metals we have the problem is

1090
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,280
with

1091
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:33,880
that okay is that everybody has

1092
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,480
exposures every single day so when they

1093
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,440
take blood from you they're getting that

1094
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,960
new

1095
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,680
exposure metal deposits can stay in your

1096
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,960
brain and very little ever be in the

1097
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,880
bloodstream metal deposits can stay in

1098
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,440
your liver and very little be in your

1099
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,000
bloodstream testing is never accurate

1100
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,520
when it comes down to chronic illness

1101
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,760
derived from toxic heavy metals so guess

1102
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,720
what is accurate though

1103
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,760
guess what the accurate thing is Guess

1104
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,359
How guess what the best test there ever

1105
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:08,160
was and ever will be it's when something

1106
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,839
works but I mean Works You've Been

1107
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,160
Everywhere you tried everything you've

1108
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,400
done

1109
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,720
everything you learn you got metals

1110
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,760
because you're learning this information

1111
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,240
of what creates your symptoms conditions

1112
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:22,359
and then you use the heavy metal

1113
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:25,079
detox three out of the five ingredients

1114
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,480
minimum or five of the ingredients five

1115
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:31,040
out of the five ingredients of the heavy

1116
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:34,400
metal detox right here out of this

1117
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,520
book and in these books that heavy metal

1118
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,520
detox you use and you watch your

1119
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,799
problems go away and as your problems go

1120
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,440
away that is right there that's how we

1121
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:45,920
do it we do it where you're riding your

1122
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,880
problems that is the example that is the

1123
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,160
street cred That's The credibility where

1124
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,400
the problem goes because sure you can

1125
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,799
get your your different tests and hey

1126
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,000
you might have medals you might not have

1127
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:57,760
Metals but are you getting better what

1128
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,559
are you doing get better and when you

1129
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,799
use something that works and it makes it

1130
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:03,799
go away that's the ultimate test because

1131
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:05,640
we're exposed to every day they can't

1132
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:08,760
test organs they can't cut open your

1133
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,920
liver and dig out the metal and say oh

1134
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,880
you got this much metal in your liver it

1135
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,599
stays embedded in there and then your

1136
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,599
bloodstream can be somewhat

1137
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,280
clean where the metals aren't really

1138
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,040
floating around but your liver's

1139
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,240
compacted in metal because it's your

1140
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,640
filter it's holding the metal down in

1141
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,440
there it is your

1142
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,640
filter

1143
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,400
we can't just test an organ and cut the

1144
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,960
darn thing open I've said this for

1145
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,720
decades they're just now starting to

1146
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,640
share that information the medical me

1147
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,520
information they've taken it poached it

1148
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,040
and now guess what so-called brand new

1149
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,960
metal experts in the last year in the

1150
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,440
last 6 months one even running ads 247

1151
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,680
to the medical meme Community is stolen

1152
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,160
medical meme information yeah totally

1153
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,680
taken it and there L like you you can't

1154
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,960
test for Metals in the blood it's

1155
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,720
interesting cuz you weren't saying that

1156
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,520
a few years ago ago in anything you were

1157
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,960
doing and you weren't saying that 5

1158
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,520
years ago in anything you were doing

1159
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,400
interesting but you're saying it now in

1160
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,480
the last 6 months for the first time

1161
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,240
ever in your career and they're like

1162
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,079
yeah you can't test for Metals in the

1163
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,880
blood cuz they're in the organs that was

1164
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,280
just poached recently and then it's

1165
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,319
being like slammed at the medical me

1166
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,319
Community every single day in

1167
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:25,640
ads yep your lab test will not be able

1168
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,480
to determine if you have high medals

1169
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,200
because they're in the organs in the

1170
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,040
brain that's medical medium information

1171
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,839
right there and so to answer that

1172
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,640
question no it's not easy but you know

1173
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:40,000
how you know you got Metals is when you

1174
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,680
actually do something for those Metals

1175
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,760
longterm or even shortterm like the

1176
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,680
heavy metal detox the medical meme heavy

1177
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,799
metal detox and you're watching these

1178
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,559
symptoms dissipate and go away and

1179
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:52,920
that's right because your metals are

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,520

against living medals right residing in

1261
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:31,559
our brain neurons that get contaminated

1262
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:34,839
they they leech they outp poet they

1263
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:36,880
become a problem electrical impulses

1264
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:38,880
that swim through the brain so

1265
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,880
electrical impulses that go through the

1266
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,839
brain right an electrical impulse goes

1267
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:49,400
through and it hits one of these

1268
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:52,160
deposits it blows up it it it um it

1269
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,880

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:47,000
tissue it's putting more back in more of

1290
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:50,880
the good stuff back in it's actually not

1291
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,200
just cleaning up and cleaning out but

1292
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,319
it's restoring and putting back in

1293
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,000
that's what has to happen that's why

1294
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:59,520
people heal

1295
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,200
metals have to come out but everything

1296
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,000
has to be restored at the same time

1297
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,640
right so that's why it's so incredible

1298
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,799
that's why the five ingredients in the

1299
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,119
heavy metal detox are so powerful and

1300
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,520
you can check them out in the medical

1301
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,039
medium books

1302
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:17,000
right it's it's so powerful because it's

1303
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:20,240
restoring tissue as it's

1304
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,960
removing and guess

1305
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,760
what the heavy metal detox is the

1306
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,920
ultimate

1307
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,200
binder the ultim

1308
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,039
binder it's got the wild blueberry in

1309
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,400
there and nobody even talked about the

1310
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,400
wild blueberry nobody even talked about

1311
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,760

1312
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,000

00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,400
did it wasn't on the

1314
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,920
scene medical medium information had to

1315
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,760
make sure people knew that the wild

1316
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,319

1317
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,839
it's part of the heavy metal detox and

1318
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,720
it's the ultimate binder and that's part

1319
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:52,839
of

1320
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:55,960
