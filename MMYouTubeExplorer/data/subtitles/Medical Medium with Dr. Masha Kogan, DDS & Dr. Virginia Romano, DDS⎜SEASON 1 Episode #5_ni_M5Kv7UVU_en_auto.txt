[113.76 - 119.85] pain burning gums fat you know you know
[117.33 - 122.61] you know the fast shot all that the the
[119.85 - 125.28] jaw jaw pain we're gonna talk about that
[122.61 - 128.73] too we're even going to talk about the
[125.28 - 130.71] plant-based movement you know how or why
[128.73 - 132.87] everybody who's vegans believe the
[130.71 - 134.97] minute they get a tooth problem
[132.87 - 137.76] it's blamed on their diet and how that's
[134.97 - 139.74] a misconception so if your plant-based
[137.76 - 141.00] or big supporters of you
[139.74 - 142.62] you know we're supporters of everybody
[141.00 - 143.58] whether they need animal protein or not
[142.62 - 146.43] or whatever we're supporters of
[143.58 - 147.78] everybody but we're big supporters of if
[146.43 - 149.79] you're a plant-based person and you're
[147.78 - 152.16] scared and running because you've got a
[149.79 - 154.29] cavity and you think maybe it's your
[152.16 - 156.69] diet we're going to talk about how that
[154.29 - 157.71] works why that happens so hey thank you
[156.69 - 159.54] for coming you guys
[157.71 - 161.28] thank you for having I'm even clapping
[159.54 - 161.82] today because this is really cool thank
[161.28 - 164.49] you
[161.82 - 167.25] this is really cool so so basically
[164.49 - 168.33] let's talk about let's talk about that
[167.25 - 170.10] whole thing with the plant-based
[168.33 - 172.80] movement right off the run um because
[170.10 - 175.86] that's a big deal because I always say
[172.80 - 178.35] that when somebody on a plant-based diet
[175.86 - 180.27] gets the first symptom say it's not even
[178.35 - 182.58] dental but they get the first symptom
[180.27 - 184.71] they get scared they think I don't have
[182.58 - 186.33] protein somebody tells me you got to go
[184.71 - 188.19] back to animal products and they start
[186.33 - 190.92] freaking out and they drop everything
[188.19 - 193.59] and they just go running out of fear and
[190.92 - 196.77] everything so and I always say that that
[193.59 - 198.69] you know it's sad because so what does
[196.77 - 201.36] that mean no one with a paleo diet ever
[198.69 - 203.52] had a symptom nobody with an a really
[201.36 - 206.37] high quality keto diet nobody with you
[203.52 - 208.59] know however had symptom so where do
[206.37 - 210.90] they run and they don't run in hide I
[208.59 - 213.33] noticed they don't meaning because their
[210.90 - 214.83] diets never blamed their diets never
[213.33 - 216.66] blames if you're on the keto diet a
[214.83 - 219.36] healthy keto diet or a new name-brand
[216.66 - 221.28] keto diet high-fat diet you're you know
[219.36 - 223.62] when you get your first cavity or you
[221.28 - 225.45] get your first symptom it's never going
[223.62 - 226.98] to be blamed on that keto diet it's
[225.45 - 228.57] never gonna be blamed on that high
[226.98 - 230.58] protein diet the minute your plant-based
[228.57 - 232.86] though the minute you're there and
[230.58 - 234.75] damned if you just your your whole your
[232.86 - 237.51] whole days ruined your life is just your
[234.75 - 240.30] your your shifting your gears and all
[237.51 - 242.25] that it's really sad because you know
[240.30 - 243.51] what I've seen all these years and I'm
[242.25 - 246.54] talking about three and a half decades
[243.51 - 248.64] of this you know is that it has nothing
[246.54 - 250.26] to do with the fact that your
[248.64 - 252.87] plant-based that you got a cavity
[250.26 - 255.63] occurring and we're gonna cover like all
[252.87 - 258.21] that and in in that whole area and stuff
[255.63 - 258.96] of what happens there and then the root
[258.21 - 261.09] canals we're going to
[258.96 - 262.92] about that a little later too and so you
[261.09 - 265.38] guys see this you hear about this though
[262.92 - 268.29] when people are plant-based right yes I
[265.38 - 270.33] mean when I was in dental school you
[268.29 - 271.74] know people who were vegan who ate a lot
[270.33 - 273.81] of sugar a lot of fruit it was always
[271.74 - 275.70] that you know it's because of their diet
[273.81 - 277.44] this and that but I've been out of
[275.70 - 279.68] dental school for a while and I see it
[277.44 - 283.08] in practice it has nothing to do with
[279.68 - 285.30] sugar it has to do with your digestive
[283.08 - 287.49] how you're digesting food things that
[285.30 - 289.26] are coming back up things that you know
[287.49 - 291.15] we speak about so it's definitely not
[289.26 - 292.02] definitely not the vegan or the
[291.15 - 293.94] plant-based diet
[292.02 - 295.98] yeah which leads me to this thing which
[293.94 - 298.53] you know I think I talked about this you
[295.98 - 301.14] guys know this but our teeth are time
[298.53 - 302.85] capsules and I mean you're like the only
[301.14 - 306.03] dentist out there that truly know that
[302.85 - 308.34] that time capsules means it's not what
[306.03 - 310.38] you're doing even in the moment of why
[308.34 - 312.99] you have a problem with your gums your
[310.38 - 314.67] teeth your jaw you know it's what
[312.99 - 316.59] happened in the past what were you
[314.67 - 318.06] eating 20 years ago what were you doing
[316.59 - 320.64] 15 years ago what kind of stress were
[318.06 - 324.36] you under did you have acid reflux for
[320.64 - 325.80] ten years roading the gums and acid
[324.36 - 329.34] reflux is one of the biggest thing you
[325.80 - 331.80] guys we see all the time people with
[329.34 - 333.78] digestive issues have acid coming up
[331.80 - 336.14] when they're sleeping and just washing
[333.78 - 338.82] away the enamel destroying the teeth
[336.14 - 340.50] digestive issues for us equals teeth
[338.82 - 343.41] problems and it's actually the hardest
[340.50 - 346.20] to treat because anything you put on the
[343.41 - 350.70] teeth if you're not fixing your GI it's
[346.20 - 352.26] just yeah and then when you're laying -
[350.70 - 354.96] you're laying down at night you're
[352.26 - 356.37] sleeping everything creeps up so it
[354.96 - 358.59] creeps up the canal you know there's
[356.37 - 360.81] something that I always say is ammonia
[358.59 - 363.81] permeability and and it's rotting
[360.81 - 365.25] protein it's rotting fats in the linings
[363.81 - 366.72] of the testicle track they're sitting on
[365.25 - 368.79] the linings of the testing on track and
[366.72 - 370.59] it's sitting there and it's putrifying
[368.79 - 372.39] and you got a you know got all these
[370.59 - 374.40] microorganisms feeding off that it's
[372.39 - 376.86] putrifying and what you get you get
[374.40 - 378.84] these ammonia gasses that creep up and
[376.86 - 381.21] they're just getting into the mouth you
[378.84 - 382.62] know the whole halitosis thing which I
[381.21 - 384.66] didn't even talk to you guys know right
[382.62 - 386.79] the whole halitosis things down breath
[384.66 - 388.71] right and and people think it's because
[386.79 - 389.40] of the mouth they think it's all because
[388.71 - 392.01] of the mouth
[389.40 - 394.32] it's the gut it's the good lives in the
[392.01 - 396.51] gut it's all that ammonia coming up and
[394.32 - 398.34] so and then you got the acid reflux
[396.51 - 400.29] you've got the assets coming up to of
[398.34 - 403.59] roading the gums starting to take out
[400.29 - 405.12] the gums and you know in the thing is
[403.59 - 406.95] it's one of the reasons why I say you
[405.12 - 408.39] got to do your celery juice you have to
[406.95 - 410.07] do your celery juice so you start your
[408.39 - 412.20] celery juice now it's going to help you
[410.07 - 414.57] later on because you're restoring your
[412.20 - 417.42] hydrochloric acid when you restore your
[414.57 - 419.91] hydrochloric acid you lose that acid
[417.42 - 423.30] reflux because you know acid reflux
[419.91 - 426.60] they're bad acids produced by
[423.30 - 429.03] microorganisms and bad bacteria that are
[426.60 - 432.84] in the liver better'n anywhere in the
[429.03 - 435.21] gut and that's what's coming up the
[432.84 - 437.58] celery juice three months three months
[435.21 - 438.96] in how the doses will be gone you guys
[437.58 - 441.75] will see the difference right away
[438.96 - 443.76] you'll be it'll be incredible okay and
[441.75 - 446.67] you'll see it and talk to your friends
[443.76 - 448.44] they'll tell you you have no bad smell
[446.67 - 454.11] coming out because we see it all the
[448.44 - 455.94] time if you're not if you have that
[454.11 - 458.43] ammonia coming up it's bringing the pH
[455.94 - 460.86] down yeah when you bring a pH down you
[458.43 - 462.93] allow bacteria to kind of grow and
[460.86 - 465.57] that's you know you have to kind of get
[462.93 - 467.91] the GI to a better position and deliver
[465.57 - 476.70] to a better position in order to to kind
[467.91 - 477.99] of lemon water yes so that's important
[476.70 - 480.99] to you the lemon water
[477.99 - 482.76] you know lemon water originally was all
[480.99 - 484.74] about you know you put lemon in water to
[482.76 - 487.29] make lemonade you make a tasty drink you
[484.74 - 489.15] have lemon squeeze in water and and it
[487.29 - 490.74] was hydrating that's the kind of
[489.15 - 492.42] consensus that was years ago and then
[490.74 - 494.61] what happened was spirit of compassion
[492.42 - 495.99] new medical medium information they told
[494.61 - 498.72] me at the lemon water when I was younger
[495.99 - 500.79] flushed out the liver so it flushed out
[498.72 - 502.83] the liver and it flushed out the toxins
[500.79 - 504.57] and someone said to me recently said you
[502.83 - 505.86] didn't start lemon water like oh no
[504.57 - 508.35] people been putting lemon in the water
[505.86 - 510.87] for centuries yeah I didn't start any
[508.35 - 512.85] lemon water thing but what spirit didn't
[510.87 - 514.92] do spirit of compassion didn't do was
[512.85 - 516.75] teach people the lemon water for the
[514.92 - 519.30] first time taught people had flushed out
[516.75 - 521.56] the liver and flushed the liver out of
[519.30 - 523.00] all those toxins that waited there to be
[521.56 - 524.74] first thing in the morning because your
[523.00 - 527.41] livers working all night long it's got
[524.74 - 529.33] people you got people with all these
[527.41 - 531.07] toxins building up all night long we got
[529.33 - 532.93] a stagnant sluggish liver they're
[531.07 - 534.82] getting the acid reflux they're getting
[532.93 - 537.01] ammonia coming up from rotting peat
[534.82 - 538.99] refined proteins and fats in their gut
[537.01 - 540.97] and it's it's Glee Qing in their mouth
[538.99 - 542.83] it's coming up they're burning out their
[540.97 - 544.48] gums because of it
[542.83 - 546.16] you see it every day every day and then
[544.48 - 548.26] what happens is all those toxins build
[546.16 - 550.90] up if you do that lemon water every
[548.26 - 552.49] morning and you flush out the liver and
[550.90 - 554.53] you flush out those toxins from the
[552.49 - 556.36] liver you sweep that out and it's gonna
[554.53 - 558.79] help you get there you know closer then
[556.36 - 561.49] you bring in your celery juice which is
[558.79 - 563.92] a big one too and I want to ask you guys
[561.49 - 565.87] about mineral deficiencies like what do
[563.92 - 566.74] you think about that like what do you
[565.87 - 569.38] think about the whole mineral
[566.74 - 571.12] deficiencies you know our teeth are made
[569.38 - 573.16] of minerals we you know the whole bit
[571.12 - 576.37] like like what you were saying basically
[573.16 - 578.20] people could be on a specific diet 5 7
[576.37 - 580.39] 10 years and everything is great and
[578.20 - 582.52] then they switch to diet that they now
[580.39 - 583.72] believe was better and all of a sudden
[582.52 - 585.13] they're like oh my teeth are falling
[583.72 - 587.23] apart they have all these cavities I
[585.13 - 588.19] have gum disease I have all this
[587.23 - 590.19] happening to me
[588.19 - 592.63] I gotta drop this new diet right away
[590.19 - 594.94] because when I was doing the other diet
[592.63 - 596.53] nothing was happening no it takes time
[594.94 - 598.93] for the mineral silly child
[596.53 - 602.80] it takes time for things to break down
[598.93 - 604.84] teeth are such a complex tissue it
[602.80 - 607.69] actually is said that it's the longest
[604.84 - 609.34] to be made in utero when our moms are
[607.69 - 612.13] pregnant with us did she take the
[609.34 - 615.19] longest to form it takes a long time to
[612.13 - 617.17] break them down so it's as empty I'm
[615.19 - 620.50] saying it's a time capsule it will catch
[617.17 - 622.24] up with you but later so don't see it
[620.50 - 623.68] like in the moment what you're doing is
[622.24 - 625.84] what's causing the problem it's what
[623.68 - 627.25] you've done in the past yeah see people
[625.84 - 630.52] people come into this world to begin
[627.25 - 633.07] with mineral deficient okay because how
[630.52 - 636.19] was mom eating how was dad eating right
[633.07 - 638.23] and then they have emails yeah you know
[636.19 - 640.42] I've always found that the metals and
[638.23 - 643.18] I'm not just the the mercury fillings
[640.42 - 645.61] those metals not just that the metals
[643.18 - 647.92] that we come into this world with and
[645.61 - 649.68] then we collect through certain ways you
[647.92 - 650.97] guys can use your imagination
[649.68 - 653.73] and you can get Nettles I talked about
[650.97 - 655.74] it there's there's you know metals and
[653.73 - 657.36] pharmaceuticals there's metals and other
[655.74 - 659.31] places there's all kinds of stuff like
[657.36 - 661.29] that but we can get metals and its
[659.31 - 663.66] antibiotics have metals in them you know
[661.29 - 665.58] I talk about that all the time so you
[663.66 - 666.87] know when we have when we when we
[665.58 - 668.94] receive all these we build all these
[666.87 - 671.67] metals in her life I always find that
[668.94 - 673.86] that breaks down the mouths immune
[671.67 - 675.21] system and not even the metals being in
[673.86 - 677.76] the mouth just through the body
[675.21 - 679.26] lymphatic system our immune system
[677.76 - 680.94] starts to break down from having high
[679.26 - 683.52] amounts of metals in our liver and other
[680.94 - 686.07] places in the body but when we have
[683.52 - 687.99] these elevated metals it weakens teeth
[686.07 - 690.06] and weakens teeths ability to stay
[687.99 - 693.24] strong you know to keep the mineral
[690.06 - 695.97] strong because metals basically cancel
[693.24 - 697.92] out minerals in us minerals get affected
[695.97 - 701.07] because water minerals there trace
[697.92 - 702.93] metals but good ones minerals are trace
[701.07 - 705.00] metals but good ones so you got all this
[702.93 - 706.92] mercury you got all this aluminum you
[705.00 - 711.27] got all these other toxic metals in us
[706.92 - 714.54] and they react to our own trace minerals
[711.27 - 716.73] we trace metals metals and and then
[714.54 - 719.73] those trace those trace minerals are
[716.73 - 721.29] actually part of our teeth and then and
[719.73 - 722.79] then we get the mercury fillings when we
[721.29 - 725.31] have you know and all that but we can go
[722.79 - 727.89] in a little bit but the bottom line is
[725.31 - 729.60] it's a time capsule to how a mineral
[727.89 - 739.11] deficient you were when you were younger
[729.60 - 740.76] exactly and your parents to when you
[739.11 - 743.64] guys are pregnant you're making another
[740.76 - 745.68] skeletal system a lot of minerals are
[743.64 - 748.80] getting pulled to make that system so it
[745.68 - 750.78] can kind of steal from your system so
[748.80 - 754.14] something will suffer yeah your baby's
[750.78 - 756.57] teeth or bones whatever more your bones
[754.14 - 758.10] and teeth so eat some fruit when you're
[756.57 - 759.99] pregnant yeah you know I don't see I
[758.10 - 761.37] don't see dentist saying this out there
[759.99 - 762.84] and it's really sad to me because
[761.37 - 765.36] they're they're out of touch because
[762.84 - 768.72] this is really powerful information you
[765.36 - 770.64] know because it's it's not just about in
[768.72 - 773.04] the moment because then just think right
[770.64 - 775.26] in the moment what you're doing that's
[773.04 - 777.03] what they always go after so if you go
[775.26 - 778.83] to a dentist and you're plant-based and
[777.03 - 781.38] you you're going there and they spot a
[778.83 - 781.80] cavity oh you got to stop that plant
[781.38 - 784.29] babe
[781.80 - 786.33] right away you got to stop it right away
[784.29 - 787.83] that's what they'll say and they'll be
[786.33 - 789.36] like you you're obviously protein
[787.83 - 792.48] deficient you're getting too much sugar
[789.36 - 794.58] and but sugar isn't the cost that's the
[792.48 - 797.82] whole thing and I want to I want to dive
[794.58 - 799.83] into that a little bit so you're told at
[797.82 - 803.10] the dentist office that sugar in general
[799.83 - 805.44] like candy sugar like all that kind of
[803.10 - 807.51] sugar is the problem with teeth problems
[805.44 - 809.97] and then the other thing you're told is
[807.51 - 811.95] citrus so I want to cover that a second
[809.97 - 813.30] students of citrus so these are the two
[811.95 - 814.98] things you'll get it that the D you'll
[813.30 - 818.31] get at the dentist's office is yeah
[814.98 - 820.95] you'll get the candy bad sugars fruit
[818.31 - 822.66] sugar the lump it all together we don't
[820.95 - 824.49] want to be on bad sugars you don't want
[822.66 - 825.57] to be uncanny you guys we know that I
[824.49 - 827.01] mean if you're dealing with a chronic
[825.57 - 829.38] illness or anything you don't want to be
[827.01 - 831.15] eating candy but fruit sugars an
[829.38 - 833.19] entirely different thing you know that's
[831.15 - 834.90] a whole nother a whole nother game it
[833.19 - 837.69] creates glucose in the body it feeds
[834.90 - 840.51] every cell but the bottom line is that
[837.69 - 843.09] was a theory going all the way back then
[840.51 - 845.10] sugar caused teeth problems because you
[843.09 - 851.76] guys seen people eat sugar their whole
[845.10 - 854.55] like bad sugar no problem no property I
[851.76 - 856.77] mean we always tell our patients eat the
[854.55 - 858.72] fruit sugar yeah the fruit is great for
[856.77 - 862.53] you it's good for your teeth it's good
[858.72 - 863.88] for your body you will not enroll your
[862.53 - 866.37] teeth with sucking and lemons or oranges
[863.88 - 867.96] is that there is no amount of water
[866.37 - 869.28] ingest you can suck on to destroy your
[867.96 - 870.99] teeth this just doesn't happen you know
[869.28 - 872.70] there's fake truth out there and then
[870.99 - 873.93] there's real truth out there that's how
[872.70 - 875.58] the world works you know you mean
[873.93 - 877.29] there's theories that create a fake
[875.58 - 879.75] truth and then everybody runs around
[877.29 - 881.07] with it and then you got real truth
[879.75 - 883.20] right here and I paid dearly for
[881.07 - 885.51] bringing real truth out you guys know
[883.20 - 887.61] that I can't last you know kicked a lot
[885.51 - 889.05] you you know the whole deal out there
[887.61 - 890.91] but when you're bringing a real truth to
[889.05 - 893.25] people so they actually stop feeding the
[890.91 - 895.44] medical system so they start healing
[893.25 - 898.32] that's powerful you know it's funny
[895.44 - 901.16] real truth is real truth right here is
[898.32 - 903.81] exactly that that we've seen I've seen
[901.16 - 906.54] years and years of years and years you
[903.81 - 909.96] have helped out over 250,000 individuals
[906.54 - 913.02] like one on one over the last 35 years
[909.96 - 913.95] look what many years ago and I've seen
[913.02 - 918.36] people the
[913.95 - 920.01] and E junk cakes sugar sugar cubes and
[918.36 - 923.46] their teeth be fine
[920.01 - 925.47] clearly you did sugar cubes oh I'll have
[923.46 - 927.78] four more sugar cubes here and sucking
[925.47 - 930.18] on sugar kids I've known people who
[927.78 - 931.62] sucked on sugars that's a big yeah they
[930.18 - 933.96] would pop the cubes and they did that
[931.62 - 936.63] all day long teeth were perfectly fun
[933.96 - 939.48] perfectly solid including like in every
[936.63 - 942.09] way shape a but how come you won't
[939.48 - 944.25] hear that from the dentist
[942.09 - 946.41] how can you won't hear that like is it
[944.25 - 947.27] because they just want to go with the
[946.41 - 950.58] flow of what
[947.27 - 953.82] you know whatever it's what they teach
[950.58 - 957.00] us in dental school and then we see
[953.82 - 958.53] ourselves what works and what is true so
[957.00 - 960.39] it's like medical school you go to
[958.53 - 962.10] America you come out you don't know why
[960.39 - 963.78] somebody has fibromyalgia you don't know
[962.10 - 965.46] why they have eczema psoriasis you don't
[963.78 - 966.66] have any answers there's no answers
[965.46 - 968.37] taught in medical school and all the
[966.66 - 970.41] autoimmune conditions there's no answers
[968.37 - 972.45] talked about lupus there's no answers on
[970.41 - 974.16] anything you just kind of go to school
[972.45 - 976.56] you learn the nuts and bolts you come
[974.16 - 979.38] out they stamped out and then you have
[976.56 - 981.24] to be you have to rise above with with
[979.38 - 983.73] with something inside of you that's why
[981.24 - 985.68] they are the best dentists there are
[983.73 - 987.51] hands down that's why I'm like you know
[985.68 - 990.24] you know out of line it just does
[987.51 - 991.83] because it's so powerful the information
[990.24 - 994.71] is powerful that you guys got well I
[991.83 - 996.66] think as dentists and as physicians
[994.71 - 998.07] after you get out of med school in
[996.66 - 1000.62] dental school you kind of have to decide
[998.07 - 1003.44] what's right for you um dental school
[1000.62 - 1005.12] taught taught me the basics but once
[1003.44 - 1006.56] you're in it and you start seeing that
[1005.12 - 1008.06] you know sugar doesn't cause the
[1006.56 - 1009.89] cavities and you kind of have to make up
[1008.06 - 1011.51] your own mind that way
[1009.89 - 1014.50] I think the dental community is starting
[1011.51 - 1016.73] to come around I was just added
[1014.50 - 1021.68] you're saying that just does not
[1016.73 - 1024.23] cause which is that's something it was
[1021.68 - 1025.91] if you had erosion on like the outside
[1024.23 - 1027.53] parts of your teeth it happy were
[1025.91 - 1030.14] sucking on lemons it was the orange it
[1027.53 - 1032.60] was that but it not anymore so I mean
[1030.14 - 1034.07] we're coming around and I know with your
[1032.60 - 1036.53] help and just kind of getting the word
[1034.07 - 1039.11] out there but it takes time you know
[1036.53 - 1042.77] it's you have to change an old way of
[1039.11 - 1044.96] thinking you know citrus is so high in
[1042.77 - 1046.67] calcium so high in calcium it's
[1044.96 - 1049.19] ridiculous because wherever citrus has
[1046.67 - 1051.92] grown like if you got Florida citrus
[1049.19 - 1054.53] that all that sand that it's grown out
[1051.92 - 1056.63] of is calcium based okay so everybody's
[1054.53 - 1059.66] worried about calcium calcium right
[1056.63 - 1062.96] anywhere where citrus grows the the dirt
[1059.66 - 1066.35] is high in calcium so citrus is your
[1062.96 - 1071.69] teeth restore her this restore or work
[1066.35 - 1073.61] your teeth restore okay it actually is
[1071.69 - 1075.92] your that's how we can restore tea the
[1073.61 - 1078.56] citrus it's sucking on oranges it's
[1075.92 - 1080.03] sucking on lemons it's that kind of you
[1078.56 - 1083.90] know and that's what I mean it's like
[1080.03 - 1086.54] and that information I mean is powerful
[1083.90 - 1088.10] because that will protect you so your
[1086.54 - 1089.84] teeth aren't falling out down the road
[1088.10 - 1091.37] you think have these problems now you
[1089.84 - 1092.66] think do you think he got the root
[1091.37 - 1094.79] canals now you think you got teeth
[1092.66 - 1096.44] problems now gum issues and you're
[1094.79 - 1098.72] afraid to you know have lemon water
[1096.44 - 1100.49] you're afraid to suck on an orange it's
[1098.72 - 1104.09] just gonna get you in trouble leader
[1100.49 - 1107.90] because the other part of gum health and
[1104.09 - 1112.76] deep health is vitamin C good vitamin
[1107.90 - 1115.19] C's huge industry and huge what happens
[1112.76 - 1116.99] what happens when okay what happens when
[1115.19 - 1118.94] somebody comes in with an abscess and
[1116.99 - 1120.89] they're like oh my god and they come in
[1118.94 - 1123.77] through the abscess and it's like and in
[1120.89 - 1125.48] the hole big vitamin C right it's like
[1123.77 - 1127.94] you first of all you gotta be on a lot
[1125.48 - 1129.65] of vitamin C yeah vitamin C is huge I
[1127.94 - 1131.90] mean you can get it obviously in fruit
[1129.65 - 1134.51] you can get it with supplements good
[1131.90 - 1137.27] supplements with quality supplements but
[1134.51 - 1139.64] vitamin C's one of these essentials
[1137.27 - 1141.14] parts of dental health yeah remember
[1139.64 - 1142.79] when I was 14 years old and I was
[1141.14 - 1144.32] working on clients in the grocery store
[1142.79 - 1145.70] I stocked shelves in right
[1144.32 - 1147.05] you guys know the story I talked about
[1145.70 - 1149.21] in the celery juice medical medium
[1147.05 - 1152.00] celery juice book and I was juicing
[1149.21 - 1153.50] celery in the back for clients walking
[1152.00 - 1155.90] around the store with the carriages and
[1153.50 - 1158.36] stuff and a number one one person one
[1155.90 - 1160.04] individual had a you know whole thing
[1158.36 - 1162.41] and they said it was puffed out to here
[1160.04 - 1164.39] they had a bad abscess I said you gotta
[1162.41 - 1166.34] have the vitamin C I said you got to
[1164.39 - 1168.14] squeeze all these oranges all these
[1166.34 - 1170.60] oranges and you got it you got to get an
[1168.14 - 1172.46] orange juice orange juice squeezer
[1170.60 - 1173.99] machine right I have something that time
[1172.46 - 1176.42] and you can hand do it and everything
[1173.99 - 1178.04] and it recommended lots of oranges every
[1176.42 - 1179.81] day and the person said to me wait a
[1178.04 - 1181.76] minute that's citrus it's gonna do
[1179.81 - 1183.77] something to my gums and teeth and they
[1181.76 - 1187.01] did the oranges they did this celery
[1183.77 - 1189.11] juice and an abscess was going down when
[1187.01 - 1191.12] no antibiotic touched it they were about
[1189.11 - 1194.00] to literally go into surgery and avoid
[1191.12 - 1196.79] they avoided their their surgery I mean
[1194.00 - 1198.23] yeah and I'm not anti antibiotics when
[1196.79 - 1200.12] we need them for certain things I'm
[1198.23 - 1202.19] about making sure we are but we never
[1200.12 - 1203.99] have to get there or we never have to
[1202.19 - 1207.14] rely on them all the time we never have
[1203.99 - 1209.66] to try to don't work but so those
[1207.14 - 1213.52] accesses vitamin C is so important
[1209.66 - 1213.52] that's why I like the very G vitamin C
[1215.92 - 1221.45] it's a good quality product so it's it's
[1218.78 - 1222.68] you know what the bottom line is is when
[1221.45 - 1224.03] it comes down to the vitamin seeds
[1222.68 - 1225.65] that's one thing you need you need the
[1224.03 - 1228.35] minerals like in citrus you need the
[1225.65 - 1230.57] calcium you got that you can I sort of
[1228.35 - 1233.33] like you guys are like experts in
[1230.57 - 1235.49] mercury removal mercury filling removal
[1233.33 - 1241.64] like you guys pop those out we do have
[1235.49 - 1243.14] them which is how I even got to know you
[1241.64 - 1245.35] know because you're getting exposed
[1243.14 - 1248.51] because I was getting exposed to so
[1245.35 - 1251.18] mercury level was like off the charts
[1248.51 - 1253.43] probably still is off the charts cuz we
[1251.18 - 1255.32] remove them broken amalgam City move
[1253.43 - 1256.82] every single day takes time to remove
[1255.32 - 1259.13] mercury out of your body when you're
[1256.82 - 1261.05] getting it in every day every day we
[1259.13 - 1263.30] take them out every day and people who

[1339.56 - 1344.78] of chronic illness get those teeth
[1341.63 - 1346.97] removed we don't believe in that I don't
[1344.78 - 1349.01] think it's necessary I mean I don't know
[1346.97 - 1351.59] how you feel about that you know what
[1349.01 - 1354.32] what happens is this is that your I
[1351.59 - 1356.51] always I always see it this way if you
[1354.32 - 1360.98] don't get a root canal what's your other
[1356.51 - 1363.44] option an implant or bridge which
[1360.98 - 1365.84] sometimes you end up with implant do you
[1363.44 - 1367.46] get the bolts for the bridge yeah you
[1365.84 - 1371.63] know I forget they're calling the stems
[1367.46 - 1373.64] or so yeah yeah like for the bridge and
[1371.63 - 1376.25] then you need you need also the brackets
[1373.64 - 1378.11] not the brackets but you know what if
[1376.25 - 1385.22] the bridge yeah I mean you need the
[1378.11 - 1386.42] framework I mean I agree and we talk
[1385.22 - 1388.55] about this all the time people always
[1386.42 - 1390.29] ask us they come in should we get my
[1388.55 - 1392.12] root canals out what should I do
[1390.29 - 1394.67] I mean sometimes you need to take them
[1392.12 - 1397.28] out and get affected yeah they're some
[1394.67 - 1398.75] reasons but I mean most of the time you
[1397.28 - 1400.46] say you know you want to keep your tooth
[1398.75 - 1401.08] because your other option is an implant
[1400.46 - 1403.99] sometime
[1401.08 - 1405.73] the plan won't work you know and not
[1403.99 - 1408.16] having a tooth can be detrimental to
[1405.73 - 1410.32] your oral health to your health all
[1408.16 - 1413.98] around it help it affects occlusion and
[1410.32 - 1417.61] mastication muscle tone so we both agree
[1413.98 - 1419.53] you know we're bound to keep them if you
[1417.61 - 1421.45] can if you guys come and see the dentist
[1419.53 - 1422.50] and find a dentist who you trust and
[1421.45 - 1426.79] we're not your enemy
[1422.50 - 1430.12] but good people really here to help come
[1426.79 - 1432.82] in find the dentist who you connect with
[1430.12 - 1434.77] who you trust and that you won't get to
[1432.82 - 1436.93] the root canal you won't need it because
[1434.77 - 1438.85] you cavity won't grow you'll be taken
[1436.93 - 1441.31] care of yeah you'll get it before the
[1438.85 - 1443.59] cavity gets down - exactly yeah down to
[1441.31 - 1445.32] the pulp of the root there and you know
[1443.59 - 1448.06] the thing is with the root canals is
[1445.32 - 1451.93] what I find all these years all the
[1448.06 - 1454.72] people have helped is mystery jaw pain
[1451.93 - 1456.52] can lead to a couple of things it can
[1454.72 - 1459.52] lead to a root canal that shouldn't have
[1456.52 - 1464.76] been done correct right it can also lead
[1459.52 - 1464.76] to blaming a root canal that was done
[1466.14 - 1469.33] yeah exactly
[1467.80 - 1472.36] they remove the tooth you still have the
[1469.33 - 1473.74] jaw pain you know you dig it out clean
[1472.36 - 1476.59] it still happens you know you redo it
[1473.74 - 1478.30] you still have the jaw pain so this is
[1476.59 - 1479.86] something that I've run into all these
[1478.30 - 1481.75] years because I've gotten to my source
[1479.86 - 1484.36] I've been fortunate to have the source
[1481.75 - 1485.74] that I listen to and if many of you
[1484.36 - 1487.42] people don't know what that is you can
[1485.74 - 1489.07] research me and so forth and whatnot
[1487.42 - 1492.13] maybe I'll do a YouTube all about that
[1489.07 - 1495.19] someday but the bottom line is is that
[1492.13 - 1497.08] when you're there so many people have
[1495.19 - 1498.73] suffered with something that later on
[1497.08 - 1501.52] gets diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia
[1498.73 - 1502.93] yes any might not even be diagnosed as
[1501.52 - 1504.91] that you know they'll have the pain
[1502.93 - 1507.46] that's I've seen people with perfectly
[1504.91 - 1511.63] good teeth you guys perfectly good teeth
[1507.46 - 1513.97] right just have pain and they go to the
[1511.63 - 1520.66] dentist and they're drilling good teeth
[1513.97 - 1522.88] and doing root canals I'm good in and so
[1520.66 - 1524.74] you need a good dentist to kind of catch
[1522.88 - 1526.21] wait a minute is there a real problem
[1524.74 - 1527.98] with this tooth or do we have something
[1526.21 - 1530.47] going on and I just you want to go to
[1527.98 - 1533.63] different dentists if you can't get to
[1530.47 - 1535.78] them I understand wherever you might be
[1533.63 - 1537.65] and but you want you want to go to
[1535.78 - 1539.54] different dentists and get different
[1537.65 - 1541.07] opinions because you might catch a
[1539.54 - 1543.04] dentist that's like look I don't want to
[1541.07 - 1545.83] I don't want to break into these teeth
[1543.04 - 1548.21] because this jaw pain could be
[1545.83 - 1550.01] mysterious stuff going on that's still
[1548.21 - 1554.63] going to be there after the fact yeah
[1550.01 - 1556.43] absolutely there's so much virus yeah
[1554.63 - 1557.84] it's yeah the whole thing with
[1556.43 - 1559.16] trigeminal neuralgia it's the shingles
[1557.84 - 1561.02] virus I've talked about that it's
[1559.16 - 1562.97] medical medium information I put that
[1561.02 - 1565.34] out there a long long time ago still
[1562.97 - 1567.77] putting it out there that there's over
[1565.34 - 1570.02] 30 varieties of shingles so you can't
[1567.77 - 1572.06] get confused by shingles meaning in the
[1570.02 - 1574.85] sense where if you get a rash or not
[1572.06 - 1577.46] because there's non-rational
[1574.85 - 1579.62] viruses you can get a rash you can get
[1577.46 - 1581.84] the shingles and then it still become
[1579.62 - 1584.00] trigeminal neuralgia eventually but
[1581.84 - 1586.31] either way there's non ration for
[1584.00 - 1588.53] machine goals so you got a unit you got
[1586.31 - 1590.03] to know that this is behind it even if
[1588.53 - 1593.09] you didn't have the rash that's the
[1590.03 - 1595.04] trigeminal neuralgia can go and shave
[1593.09 - 1596.90] iris can affect all the facial nerves
[1595.04 - 1598.52] they can give you Bell's palsy it cannot
[1596.90 - 1600.32] beat him up I think he could just give
[1598.52 - 1603.08] you neuralgia it could give you burning
[1600.32 - 1605.90] burning gums did you ever hear about the
[1603.08 - 1607.67] burning dog man I heard
[1605.90 - 1609.92] years and years and years of helping
[1607.67 - 1611.81] people yeah and they go to 20 doctors
[1609.92 - 1614.48] they go to a whole bunch of it then he
[1611.81 - 1616.25] finally found me and and then I would be
[1614.48 - 1617.99] like that that's the shingles virus and
[1616.25 - 1619.43] you need an antiviral protocol and I
[1617.99 - 1621.20] talked about that in the medical medium
[1619.43 - 1622.58] books I mean I talked about that in the
[1621.20 - 1624.62] first book right here I talk all about
[1622.58 - 1631.22] the shingles in the first book the metal
[1624.62 - 1634.36] being a first book yeah and so course I
[1631.22 - 1639.01] got to pull a medical medium book out
[1634.36 - 1639.01] there you know everything is there
[1640.84 - 1646.15] sometimes you have to be you're not okay
[1642.93 - 1648.07] have to just put it's a knife in there
[1646.15 - 1650.43] it's in there I mean the liver recipe
[1648.07 - 1653.41] book I will say I started with that one
[1650.43 - 1655.30] there's a lot of information in there it
[1653.41 - 1657.03] will completely change your outlook and
[1655.30 - 1661.47] everything that was my first kind of
[1657.03 - 1661.47] eye-opener but this book is great too
[1661.50 - 1665.77] well I think spirit passion because
[1664.36 - 1668.35] that's that's the medical information
[1665.77 - 1672.31] it's it's untampered with it's untouched
[1668.35 - 1674.32] by by the industry that pays for things
[1672.31 - 1676.24] they get done so misinformation gets out
[1674.32 - 1678.64] there both alternative and conventional
[1676.24 - 1680.62] it's free from that it's it's for the
[1678.64 - 1682.60] people to heal it's the truth that gets
[1680.62 - 1684.19] something heal you know it's it's the
[1682.60 - 1688.66] thing is with the trigeminal neuralgia
[1684.19 - 1690.70] the hard part about that is is that the
[1688.66 - 1693.16] agony people feel with that whole
[1690.70 - 1695.80] syndrome and so you want a good dentist
[1693.16 - 1698.59] so things don't get worse and going to
[1695.80 - 1700.93] the into the wrong direction yeah you
[1698.59 - 1702.91] know what's your general neurology it's
[1700.93 - 1704.14] tricky to diagnose you have those you
[1702.91 - 1706.51] have to know what you're looking for is
[1704.14 - 1708.70] that you know people jump to conclusions
[1706.51 - 1710.50] it's teeth and gums know it could be
[1708.70 - 1712.99] something else let's wait a minute let's
[1710.50 - 1715.30] not start working on the teeth just yet
[1712.99 - 1717.46] we're not sure why it's happening let's
[1715.30 - 1718.84] think about it yeah there's antiviral
[1717.46 - 1721.48] protocols you can do for trigeminal
[1718.84 - 1723.79] neuralgia I talked about that you know I
[1721.48 - 1725.65] actually have I have a new book coming
[1723.79 - 1728.02] out I'm trying to finish up I'm working
[1725.65 - 1729.76] on it's gonna have you know things like
[1728.02 - 1732.61] that for different conditions so you
[1729.76 - 1734.32] know what to do what to take so that is
[1732.61 - 1735.70] on its way I mean I'm I'm doing
[1734.32 - 1737.95] everything I can to get everybody to
[1735.70 - 1741.01] help I can in any way possible but it's
[1737.95 - 1742.18] like so the whole thing with with I want
[1741.01 - 1746.44] to cover a little bit more with root
[1742.18 - 1749.74] canals I think so the bottom line with a
[1746.44 - 1752.26] root canal is every not almost every
[1749.74 - 1755.20] dentist will will blame bacteria
[1752.26 - 1757.78] somewhere hidden down in a root canal do
[1755.20 - 1761.29] you hear that sometimes we do we do hear
[1757.78 - 1763.33] a lot yes a lot of information about you
[1761.29 - 1765.63] know saying that fast root canal that
[1763.33 - 1768.85] have been already done harbor bacteria
[1765.63 - 1769.65] inside that's causing all these chronic
[1768.85 - 1772.27] illnesses
[1769.65 - 1774.52] all right now I want to cut into this
[1772.27 - 1776.11] yeah this is really a good point okay
[1774.52 - 1777.97] first of all I want to tell everybody
[1776.11 - 1780.10] your chronic illnesses are not caused by
[1777.97 - 1782.95] a little bit of bacteria buried deep
[1780.10 - 1785.29] down in a root canal it's not possible
[1782.95 - 1787.93] first of all that's bacteria that
[1785.29 - 1789.91] actually sits down there if anything and
[1787.93 - 1792.13] that can't create neurotoxins for
[1789.91 - 1793.66] fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome it
[1792.13 - 1795.43] can't create all these different issues
[1793.66 - 1797.89] they can't create multiple sclerosis
[1795.43 - 1800.05] Rufus eczema psoriasis rheumatoid
[1797.89 - 1801.97] arthritis it can't create you know any
[1800.05 - 1804.04] chronic fatigue syndrome and can't
[1801.97 - 1805.42] create tangles numbness aches and pains
[1804.04 - 1808.47] all these different things throughout
[1805.42 - 1811.60] the body all you know tics spasms
[1808.47 - 1814.63] anxiety depression if you want when the
[1811.60 - 1818.80] root canal is blamed on depression
[1814.63 - 1820.63] it's what I've seen this is called this
[1818.80 - 1822.58] is throwing darts at a barn door I think
[1820.63 - 1824.41] that's that or it's just a crapshoot or
[1822.58 - 1826.66] a guessing game musical chairs whatever
[1824.41 - 1828.49] you want to call it that's what it ends
[1826.66 - 1830.92] up being and people get really in
[1828.49 - 1833.20] trouble from that whole philosophy or
[1830.92 - 1834.70] theory that got around somehow in
[1833.20 - 1836.91] dentistry that's really pissed me off
[1834.70 - 1839.56] because I've seen so many people hurt
[1836.91 - 1841.54] because of it when there are real
[1839.56 - 1842.74] answers to why you have while you're
[1841.54 - 1844.54] diagnosed with an autoimmune condition
[1842.74 - 1846.13] there's really interesting why you have
[1844.54 - 1849.04] problems and it's not because of a
[1846.13 - 1850.66] little bit of bacteria that supposedly
[1849.04 - 1852.10] could be at the bottom of your root
[1850.66 - 1854.32] canal so we got to rip all your root
[1852.10 - 1855.79] canals out people to get rid of your
[1854.32 - 1857.56] enemy chronic fatigue syndrome and your
[1855.79 - 1859.48] lupus and your Hashimoto's thyroiditis
[1857.56 - 1860.95] and that's your thyroid problem and your
[1859.48 - 1863.29] thyroid problem is because of your root
[1860.95 - 1865.18] canals grave mistake your Lyme disease
[1863.29 - 1867.49] now is because your root canals grave
[1865.18 - 1868.87] mistake I'm telling you right now if
[1867.49 - 1871.15] you're running into that out there I'm
[1868.87 - 1873.85] so sorry you are this is a massive
[1871.15 - 1876.10] mistake in dentistry I know so these
[1873.85 - 1880.24] these to know this I mean right is that
[1876.10 - 1883.24] this is just you not me and if I'm off
[1880.24 - 1885.73] you know this is huge I'm still happy
[1883.24 - 1887.80] just said that because we people call
[1885.73 - 1889.54] and come in with exactly that let me
[1887.80 - 1891.52] move my teeth that have been root canals
[1889.54 - 1896.65] in the past because it's causing my ABC
[1891.52 - 1897.94] and D no it's not yeah and so so this is
[1896.65 - 1900.58] important information
[1897.94 - 1902.26] I mean you share this YouTube share it
[1900.58 - 1902.89] out there send it to people you know
[1902.26 - 1904.90] that
[1902.89 - 1905.98] problem said that you know they go to
[1904.90 - 1907.84] their dentist and they have all these
[1905.98 - 1910.24] questions just that I would pass this
[1907.84 - 1914.23] one around because it's that powerful
[1910.24 - 1916.18] and it's rare they flew out here okay
[1914.23 - 1918.34] this is really rare they flew out here
[1916.18 - 1920.02] okay from the East Coast
[1918.34 - 1922.60] and they're out here on the west coast
[1920.02 - 1924.88] right now okay and they flew out here to
[1922.60 - 1926.83] do this they took time on their schedule
[1924.88 - 1929.29] their schedules so busy they're working
[1926.83 - 1933.01] on a zillion people and then and they
[1929.29 - 1935.02] shut it down there's no practice to get
[1933.01 - 1936.61] out here to help you guys and remember
[1935.02 - 1937.99] being on the phone with you guys and you
[1936.61 - 1940.54] guys are like look we just want to help
[1937.99 - 1942.49] people we do that's really we just want
[1940.54 - 1945.40] to help people like you know and it's
[1942.49 - 1948.07] compassion that that matters to me and
[1945.40 - 1950.47] they have it and so just know what you
[1948.07 - 1952.87] got right here yeah I'm just saying no
[1950.47 - 1954.94] that this is a really really important
[1952.87 - 1956.47] day an important time and and we're all
[1954.94 - 1958.63] lucky I'm lucky that they're here right
[1956.47 - 1960.49] now you guys are lucky because there's
[1958.63 - 1963.04] so much information so let's go into I'm
[1960.49 - 1965.56] are you going to some other stuff teeth
[1963.04 - 1968.29] sensitivities okay so I want to go into
[1965.56 - 1972.22] that whole thing teeth sensitivities
[1968.29 - 1974.08] doesn't mean the tooth has a problem you
[1972.22 - 1976.83] know that's what I've learned you know
[1974.08 - 1979.95] from my information from my source and
[1976.83 - 1983.53] it's more of gum it's more of nerve
[1979.95 - 1985.54] sensitivities that's what it is and it's
[1983.53 - 1987.49] not the food that causes a teeth
[1985.54 - 1989.56] sensitivity you know that's another
[1987.49 - 1992.17] thing too it's not lemon water that
[1989.56 - 1994.66] causes teeth sensitivity it's not yeah
[1992.17 - 1996.25] it's it's not foods that cause teeth
[1994.66 - 1998.50] sensitive it's like sugar or something
[1996.25 - 2001.71] else it's just it's it's sensitive
[1998.50 - 2004.97] nerves you know we see that a lot as
[2001.71 - 2007.14] well okay and it's it's important to
[2004.97 - 2010.89] antiviral protocol we think everybody
[2007.14 - 2012.96] should be on it okay that's just even if
[2010.89 - 2014.58] you feel great and it takes time I mean
[2012.96 - 2017.04] you have to give I mean if you're in
[2014.58 - 2018.24] pain and sometimes we can't really
[2017.04 - 2019.89] there's nothing wrong with your teeth
[2018.24 - 2022.23] it's you know something viral it takes
[2019.89 - 2023.94] time to for it to build up I mean it
[2022.23 - 2027.03] took time to get the pain so you have to
[2023.94 - 2029.46] be patient we do use the viral load do
[2027.03 - 2031.50] the medical medium interim protocol
[2029.46 - 2034.05] there's so much you can do so so
[2031.50 - 2035.23] basically a lot of problems we get in
[2034.05 - 2036.46] dentistry
[2035.23 - 2038.11] a lot of problems would get with people
[2036.46 - 2040.90] going to dentists because they're sick
[2038.11 - 2042.88] is because they got low-grade viruses
[2040.90 - 2044.53] more high-grade viruses they got the ups
[2042.88 - 2045.91] to one of the epstein-barr virus as I
[2044.53 - 2047.83] talked about one of the over 60
[2045.91 - 2050.05] varieties that's out there mutations and
[2047.83 - 2051.79] strains they got that they got one of
[2050.05 - 2053.26] the over 30 varieties of shingles virus
[2051.79 - 2055.24] out there and if you guys think you
[2053.26 - 2057.04] don't have bugs in yet I hate to break
[2055.24 - 2058.60] it to you everybody's got bugs in them I
[2057.04 - 2060.61] don't care if you're 20 years old if
[2058.60 - 2062.35] you're 18 years old if you're 25 years
[2060.61 - 2064.42] old if you're 35 years old if you got
[2062.35 - 2066.49] bugs in you and you'll get symptoms down
[2064.42 - 2068.11] the road I've always tried to be the
[2066.49 - 2069.61] person to get that information out there
[2068.11 - 2071.80] and since because I want people to know
[2069.61 - 2073.72] now so you can stop it later and get
[2071.80 - 2076.30] better and protect yourself so you don't
[2073.72 - 2078.28] get something too so but the whole thing
[2076.30 - 2080.95] is is what Masha is saying
[2078.28 - 2083.89] magine are saying is antiviral protocols
[2080.95 - 2086.17] you want to be on antiviral protocols to
[2083.89 - 2088.66] protect yourself so that you don't get
[2086.17 - 2091.36] sick because what's behind everything
[2088.66 - 2093.73] the teeth sensitivities the nerve pain
[2091.36 - 2096.31] all of this other conditions we're
[2093.73 - 2099.52] talking about what's behind it is viral
[2096.31 - 2103.45] loads viruses than the hhv-6 deciding
[2099.52 - 2105.73] Begler virus in the HH v 7h h v 10 11 12
[2103.45 - 2107.56] 13 working undiscovered all these
[2105.73 - 2109.09] viruses undiscovered many of them many
[2107.56 - 2111.91] other mutations because i always talk
[2109.09 - 2114.01] about in virology it's under funded
[2111.91 - 2116.20] because virology holds the answers to
[2114.01 - 2117.61] get people healthy so that no one seam
[2116.20 - 2120.37] spends money in the medical system
[2117.61 - 2122.14] anymore so that's why viruses are just
[2120.37 - 2124.36] you know it's all it's instead it's
[2122.14 - 2126.85] talked about out microbiome now or oh
[2124.36 - 2129.34] it's Candida or oh it's something else
[2126.85 - 2130.93] and around where you go every decade to
[2129.34 - 2134.05] the young people that come up into
[2130.93 - 2136.15] health right let's treat each them about
[2134.05 - 2138.70] food combining again so we go nowhere
[2136.15 - 2139.87] let's teach them about microbiome again
[2138.70 - 2141.70] and even though they did it over and
[2139.87 - 2143.17] over again for decades and everybody
[2141.70 - 2145.00] still stays sick and they don't know it
[2143.17 - 2147.13] let's teach the young people about
[2145.00 - 2149.08] Candida again let's teach them about
[2147.13 - 2151.99] this and what happens is this whole
[2149.08 - 2153.19] circle is on purpose and then all the
[2151.99 - 2155.83] practitioners they just become
[2153.19 - 2158.62] innocently used for this whole thing and
[2155.83 - 2160.81] then everybody each generation has the
[2158.62 - 2163.00] same old crap information and it's
[2160.81 - 2164.34] regurgitating it's recycled and no one
[2163.00 - 2166.50] gets better and we
[2164.34 - 2168.30] right that that's the whole point you
[2166.50 - 2170.22] know we need to break that and so it's
[2168.30 - 2171.81] about having a viral load it's about
[2170.22 - 2173.34] knowing that it's knowing why you're
[2171.81 - 2174.93] tired now it's knowing why you got
[2173.34 - 2176.58] floaters in the eyes and you're getting
[2174.93 - 2179.52] tingles or some numbness you're getting
[2176.58 - 2180.96] an unfit its the low-grade viral stuff
[2179.52 - 2182.55] it's so important for you guys to
[2180.96 - 2184.17] understand if you're first you know
[2182.55 - 2187.80] locking on to this so let's cover some
[2184.17 - 2189.45] more dental stuff too why not
[2187.80 - 2193.20] we give those questions everything else
[2189.45 - 2194.79] yeah yeah yeah ran over not to remove it
[2193.20 - 2197.67] I'd love to talk about that you guys are
[2194.79 - 2199.62] open to we yeah absolutely we caught a
[2197.67 - 2201.60] lot of how patients come in to us and
[2199.62 - 2206.79] they've had these mercury fillings
[2201.60 - 2209.28] placed 15 20 25 30 35 years ago that
[2206.79 - 2211.86] length of time in the mouth which is
[2209.28 - 2213.81] acidic environment heavy bacterial
[2211.86 - 2216.63] environment they will corrode they will
[2213.81 - 2218.79] break down over about ten year period so
[2216.63 - 2222.09] we see a lot of these fillings corroding
[2218.79 - 2224.79] pulling away from the tooth leaking
[2222.09 - 2227.13] saliva underneath and decaying the teeth
[2224.79 - 2228.63] underneath so if you have a defective
[2227.13 - 2230.34] filling honestly you have to have it
[2228.63 - 2232.17] removed if you have a fillings that's
[2230.34 - 2238.56] fully intact we won't touch it we'll
[2232.17 - 2241.32] leave it especially the person who has
[2238.56 - 2242.73] symptoms and is chronically ill of
[2241.32 - 2246.48] something again we don't want to push
[2242.73 - 2250.02] him over I'll never forget 1991 1991
[2246.48 - 2253.26] I'll never forget this okay I think was
[2250.02 - 2256.17] my first I think was my first person
[2253.26 - 2258.80] that came to see me that had a whole
[2256.17 - 2261.30] mouth of mercury at one time right
[2258.80 - 2263.79] nothing was wrong with them they meaning
[2261.30 - 2265.29] they were they were there they weren't
[2263.79 - 2268.32] corroding okay
[2265.29 - 2270.69] they were pretty fresh right you know
[2268.32 - 2272.22] whole mouth of it and they got told this
[2270.69 - 2274.38] is right at the beginning you know you
[2272.22 - 2276.69] know about the early 90s was right when
[2274.38 - 2278.25] you get get him drilled out Mercury's
[2276.69 - 2281.94] fillings are behind all of your sickness
[2278.25 - 2286.20] right and this is poor woman ice why I
[2281.94 - 2288.27] just I feel bad till today today so she
[2286.20 - 2290.64] went to you knows before she came to me
[2288.27 - 2293.61] to see me she before she came to my
[2290.64 - 2295.80] office she had them all taken out they
[2293.61 - 2299.16] were all drilled out everywhere
[2295.80 - 2300.42] of them at the same time something I say
[2299.16 - 2302.55] you've never been the same yeah I
[2300.42 - 2304.26] remember you never you never made all
[2302.55 - 2305.76] your hurt my feelings drilled out at the
[2304.26 - 2307.53] same time you guys have been saying this
[2305.76 - 2310.74] for years I said it long before anybody
[2307.53 - 2313.83] knew it and so um she had a ball drilled
[2310.74 - 2315.75] out right and then she had I guess I
[2313.83 - 2317.79] guess at that time in 91 she had the
[2315.75 - 2319.26] replacement that wasn't mercury and in
[2317.79 - 2322.20] the early 90s it was a different kind of
[2319.26 - 2324.27] strike composite the composite right so
[2322.20 - 2326.07] the composites done but she was sicker
[2324.27 - 2327.48] than ever she was sick to begin with she
[2326.07 - 2329.40] had a ball drilled out because she had
[2327.48 - 2331.26] the chronic fatigue syndrome which is
[2329.40 - 2332.70] epstein-barr virus but nobody knew that
[2331.26 - 2334.38] then they still don't know that now
[2332.70 - 2337.23] unless I keep on bringing that
[2334.38 - 2339.48] information out and all that mercury
[2337.23 - 2341.19] vapor went into her system so all the
[2339.48 - 2342.93] vapors for the mercury went into her
[2341.19 - 2345.18] system from the drill Alex everything
[2342.93 - 2348.30] like that it fed the virus or chronic
[2345.18 - 2350.52] fatigue syndrome got worse because it
[2348.30 - 2352.89] was so much mercury at once they didn't
[2350.52 - 2355.20] even need to be drilled out at the time
[2352.89 - 2357.24] there weren't any breaking down there
[2355.20 - 2359.64] were none corroding but get this
[2357.24 - 2364.11] so she's sicker now she's got the
[2359.64 - 2365.70] composites in then another dentist at
[2364.11 - 2367.17] the time said we need to drill out all
[2365.70 - 2368.79] your composites you're sick because you
[2367.17 - 2372.03] need mercury fillings put back through
[2368.79 - 2375.57] they drilled all our composites out poor
[2372.03 - 2377.34] woman god bless her I swear to god she
[2375.57 - 2379.44] went through hell and back they drilled
[2377.34 - 2382.35] every one out they refilled them with
[2379.44 - 2385.35] all Mercury's like 1991 refill refilled
[2382.35 - 2387.66] them all with mercury again I mean it
[2385.35 - 2390.12] was an unbelievable process I had to
[2387.66 - 2392.55] help her clean up the viruses because it
[2390.12 - 2395.58] was her only chance at that point to
[2392.55 - 2398.19] make sure we don't really get messed up
[2395.58 - 2400.59] yeah and I was just like just antiviral
[2398.19 - 2402.00] anti-federal celery juice yeah I was
[2400.59 - 2403.98] recommending salaries you said early
[2402.00 - 2405.33] absolutely I mean it came from it came
[2403.98 - 2408.06] from spirit that's just celery juice
[2405.33 - 2409.80] celery juice have you metal detox all of
[2408.06 - 2412.08] it we pulled out as much mercury as we
[2409.80 - 2414.36] can that was floating around and then we
[2412.08 - 2415.74] went for the antiviral stuff we attacked
[2414.36 - 2417.15] the virus all the different herbs I
[2415.74 - 2418.98] talked about like lemon balm you guys
[2417.15 - 2421.56] know about so that the chronic fatigue
[2418.98 - 2423.99] syndrome that virus right there behind
[2421.56 - 2425.13] it the epstein-barr was knocked down so
[2423.99 - 2427.41] it wasn't gonna feed off of anymore
[2425.13 - 2429.84] mercury but she went through
[2427.41 - 2433.65] so you guys are not into like drilling
[2429.84 - 2436.83] everything at once all of it breaking up
[2433.65 - 2440.37] and if the patient is healthy has no
[2436.83 - 2442.44] symptoms is completely nothing is going
[2440.37 - 2451.08] on we can do maybe to two or three at a
[2442.44 - 2453.96] time because your stuff it's something
[2451.08 - 2456.09] you kind of play it by ear you see how
[2453.96 - 2457.14] you're feeling and even afterwards you
[2456.09 - 2459.33] know sometimes you have to push up
[2457.14 - 2463.44] putting taking out more for a month or
[2459.33 - 2464.61] so cilantro in the wild blueberries and
[2463.44 - 2466.23] have all of that
[2464.61 - 2469.02] yeah that's why that's why a good
[2466.23 - 2471.54] dentist matters because it's like you
[2469.02 - 2474.45] got a it you're gonna be up against
[2471.54 - 2476.07] situations as a dentist that are you
[2474.45 - 2477.90] know the the cavities were in a certain
[2476.07 - 2479.52] spot you got teeth close together you
[2477.90 - 2481.41] got all these things you guys got a call
[2479.52 - 2483.39] that's when you call the shots where you
[2481.41 - 2485.58] use like your intuitive abilities you
[2483.39 - 2487.32] use your experience you use everything
[2485.58 - 2489.33] you got and that's when a good dentist
[2487.32 - 2490.92] really counts like you guys where you
[2489.33 - 2492.75] guys are like you really know how to
[2490.92 - 2494.31] work around that because you're trying
[2492.75 - 2496.08] to you're trying to not create a
[2494.31 - 2498.33] landmine you're trying to fix landmines
[2496.08 - 2499.95] you guys are dying out fires and so it's
[2498.33 - 2502.17] Pat it's powerful work you're doing I
[2499.95 - 2510.03] mean you know I'm blown away to have you
[2502.17 - 2511.65] here you know the whole thing so so is
[2510.03 - 2513.75] with the mercury fillings and everything
[2511.65 - 2514.74] so I've always said look you get one out
[2513.75 - 2516.87] at a time
[2514.74 - 2519.51] the most two out of time depending
[2516.87 - 2521.31] whatever the situation shore but I've
[2519.51 - 2523.38] always said that that's the best to do
[2521.31 - 2525.03] if they're fine and nothing's wrong with
[2523.38 - 2526.29] them work on getting mercury out of you
[2525.03 - 2527.88] everywhere else in the body
[2526.29 - 2530.91] you're the heavy metal detox throughout
[2527.88 - 2533.31] the body you leave that alone for now
[2530.91 - 2535.26] you know and depending on what symptoms
[2533.31 - 2537.30] a person's dealing with are they dealing
[2535.26 - 2539.07] with any viral symptoms you guys want to
[2537.30 - 2541.56] know what viral symptoms are tingles
[2539.07 - 2544.11] numbness aches and pains spasms twitches
[2541.56 - 2546.78] floaters of the eyes numbness I said
[2544.11 - 2550.20] tang and the tingles ringing in the ears
[2546.78 - 2552.33] popping in the ears black spots in the
[2550.20 - 2557.07] eyes that are because of the retina
[2552.33 - 2558.87] you're detaching fibromyalgia that's
[2557.07 - 2560.97] viable right there 100% chronic fatigue
[2558.87 - 2564.24] syndrome fatigue that's
[2560.97 - 2566.31] mysterious that's my role these are just
[2564.24 - 2572.15] some of them neuropathy viral plantar
[2566.31 - 2577.20] fasciitis viral Morton's neuroma viral
[2572.15 - 2578.49] PCOS viral endometriosis PCOS so these
[2577.20 - 2580.56] are see if you guys want to know what
[2578.49 - 2583.92] viral are anxiety
[2580.56 - 2587.79] got a viral load and some metals that
[2583.92 - 2589.65] right there you know depression okay so
[2587.79 - 2593.16] you're that's you know and then if you
[2589.65 - 2595.98] guys want labels for things like our AMS
[2593.16 - 2598.59] lupus Lyme disease viral I talked about
[2595.98 - 2600.18] if you guys are new to knowing the truth
[2598.59 - 2602.91] about Lyme disease because you might not
[2600.18 - 2605.10] Lyme disease was snuck recently because
[2602.91 - 2606.54] of medical meeting information powerful
[2605.10 - 2608.64] of millions of the books millions of
[2606.54 - 2610.95] medical media books going globally it
[2608.64 - 2613.17] freaked out the industry so the lime
[2610.95 - 2615.20] industry changed their game because of
[2613.17 - 2618.18] medical media so just so you know
[2615.20 - 2620.31] literally and their game new business
[2618.18 - 2621.60] what they did because I brought it to
[2620.31 - 2622.95] the world with more the millions of
[2621.60 - 2625.11] books getting out there and everything
[2622.95 - 2626.91] because people were healing and I didn't
[2625.11 - 2628.62] get the books all these books didn't get
[2626.91 - 2630.27] out there because I had help it was
[2628.62 - 2632.40] because people were healing and they
[2630.27 - 2634.41] spread the word it's know the difference
[2632.40 - 2636.27] you know I didn't have money behind
[2634.41 - 2638.13] these books like all the money that's
[2636.27 - 2639.78] behind all the other you know authors
[2638.13 - 2642.09] and stuff this is about people healing
[2639.78 - 2644.55] is why these books got around and what
[2642.09 - 2646.14] happened is it the woods of truth I
[2644.55 - 2648.18] wrote about the truth about Lyme disease
[2646.14 - 2649.86] and the industry decided to take Lyme
[2648.18 - 2651.51] disease now and take it out of the whole
[2649.86 - 2653.61] bacteria theory and stick it in the
[2651.51 - 2655.71] autoimmune theory group so it's now
[2653.61 - 2657.24] listed as an autoimmune disease which
[2655.71 - 2658.86] means it's mysterious so they don't know
[2657.24 - 2660.09] what causes Lyme anymore they actually
[2658.86 - 2662.31] thought it was bacteria now they don't
[2660.09 - 2664.32] know how to do it because of me and so
[2662.31 - 2666.99] which is it which is which I'm actually
[2664.32 - 2668.40] proud of I'm really right absolutely
[2666.99 - 2671.13] because it's gonna heal that many more
[2668.40 - 2673.35] people but the bottom line is is Lyme
[2671.13 - 2675.48] disease right there that's a viral load
[2673.35 - 2677.37] right there eczema psoriasis that's a
[2675.48 - 2678.75] viral load so why is the viral load so
[2677.37 - 2679.98] important it has everything to do with
[2678.75 - 2682.05] teeth everything to do with teeth
[2679.98 - 2683.97] problems too because when you got high
[2682.05 - 2685.74] viruses you lose your immune system you
[2683.97 - 2687.78] lose your minerals you lose all these
[2685.74 - 2689.91] things you get your liver gets stagnant
[2687.78 - 2692.46] sluggish you get low bile your acid
[2689.91 - 2694.17] reflux happens low hydrochloric acid and
[2692.46 - 2695.55] you're burning out your tea
[2694.17 - 2697.05] you get problems and you think it's
[2695.55 - 2699.87] because you're plant-based and then
[2697.05 - 2704.25] whatever and I always say look you know
[2699.87 - 2705.63] I'm Pro plant-based provegan ISM I mean
[2704.25 - 2708.21] if that's term they even use anymore
[2705.63 - 2709.92] veganism vegan and pro all that I'm Pro
[2708.21 - 2711.69] also animal protein people that eat
[2709.92 - 2715.17] animal protein good animal protein I'm
[2711.69 - 2717.33] Pro all of it but I've always said you
[2715.17 - 2722.25] know I've always said no matter what you
[2717.33 - 2724.71] know that in dentistry the dental chairs
[2722.25 - 2726.57] are not filled of vegans across the
[2724.71 - 2729.06] globe because there's only this many
[2726.57 - 2730.50] vegans there's only this many because I
[2729.06 - 2732.84] know there's vegan youtubers out there
[2730.50 - 2734.37] that that are out there and they're you
[2732.84 - 2735.84] know they're into the propaganda of
[2734.37 - 2737.64] veganism they don't like the animal
[2735.84 - 2739.38] protein people and I know there's
[2737.64 - 2740.91] youtubers out there that are vegan I get
[2739.38 - 2742.17] it you guys got it seems like big
[2740.91 - 2744.75] followings but just so you know there's
[2742.17 - 2747.63] this many vegans it's this tiny it's a
[2744.75 - 2750.06] grain of rice compared to a silo of rice
[2747.63 - 2751.77] that's how many vegans are the rest are
[2750.06 - 2753.27] animal protein people and guess what the
[2751.77 - 2755.52] dental chairs are filled with they're
[2753.27 - 2757.02] filled with animal protein people but
[2755.52 - 2759.06] for some reason it's never blamed on
[2757.02 - 2760.50] their diet you g1t from it's never
[2759.06 - 2762.30] blamed on a diet but it's blamed on the
[2760.50 - 2764.28] vegans diet so if you're vegan stay
[2762.30 - 2766.32] strong and stay vegan your animal
[2764.28 - 2768.42] protein hey Sam protein I'm just saying
[2766.32 - 2770.28] that's what happens and I want it I want
[2768.42 - 2772.50] people and I want people to know who are
[2770.28 - 2774.84] vegan and play a base that I got their
[2772.50 - 2776.49] back 100% because I know what they
[2774.84 - 2778.56] really go through I know what they
[2776.49 - 2780.54] really go through because they get they
[2778.56 - 2782.22] get tricked peer pressure in the ways
[2780.54 - 2783.87] like never before even when it seems
[2782.22 - 2785.61] like they're strong as an ox tur it
[2783.87 - 2787.56] meaning I'm emotionally strong about
[2785.61 - 2789.54] being vegan for three straight years the
[2787.56 - 2791.52] minute they get that first symptom and
[2789.54 - 2793.08] they their blood Sugar's off a little
[2791.52 - 2794.43] bit and they go to a doctor or some of
[2793.08 - 2796.38] them they're gone they're out of the
[2794.43 - 2798.30] vegan thing they're gone and I feel bad
[2796.38 - 2800.55] for people like that because I want you
[2798.30 - 2801.72] back into what where you were because it
[2800.55 - 2804.27] wasn't your problem
[2801.72 - 2805.83] it wasn't your your problem was viruses
[2804.27 - 2808.38] your problem was that kind of stuff
[2805.83 - 2810.66] strep bacteria that people get acne from
[2808.38 - 2813.27] your problems were these other problems
[2810.66 - 2814.56] your liver being congested and tired of
[2813.27 - 2816.27] the fact that you weren't as a
[2814.56 - 2818.46] plant-based person or a vegan person you
[2816.27 - 2820.65] weren't drinking celery juice or lots of
[2818.46 - 2822.24] it and don't fall for those people on
[2820.65 - 2822.70] YouTube that say I drank celery juice
[2822.24 - 2828.00] for five
[2822.70 - 2828.00] it didn't help me you guys know you
[2840.12 - 2844.30] changes but it takes time you have to
[2842.98 - 2846.10] give it time and I try and tell people
[2844.30 - 2849.28] at all the time you don't see results
[2846.10 - 2851.26] right away but I mean even small changes
[2849.28 - 2853.72] I've seen changes and my husband myself
[2851.26 - 2856.45] my girlfriends who doing so I'm just
[2853.72 - 2858.79] stay strong and trying to keep course
[2856.45 - 2862.30] and you'll you'll see changes 100
[2858.79 - 2865.63] percent yeah you know the thing is the
[2862.30 - 2867.07] thing is with the dental work is when
[2865.63 - 2868.48] someone's sick with chronic illness and
[2867.07 - 2870.22] you guys know there's so many of you
[2868.48 - 2872.11] sick with Roenick illness right you're
[2870.22 - 2874.06] visiting already your internist or visit
[2872.11 - 2876.22] visiting already your doctor you're near
[2874.06 - 2878.23] your GP you're visiting your specialist
[2876.22 - 2881.08] you're visiting your neurologist you're
[2878.23 - 2883.39] visiting your endocrinologist right and
[2881.08 - 2885.96] then on top of that you gotta go see
[2883.39 - 2890.11] your day you're getting dental work
[2885.96 - 2891.64] you're doing that - well when you learn
[2890.11 - 2893.86] about how to give your health in all
[2891.64 - 2895.99] these other ways you can see the dentist
[2893.86 - 2897.49] last see the doctors less and that's
[2895.99 - 2899.08] what it's about I mean that's what we
[2897.49 - 2900.43] want people to do and want you guys not
[2899.08 - 2901.93] to have your whole life based around
[2900.43 - 2903.54] doctor's appointments in right
[2901.93 - 2906.16] unless it's checkups at your dentist
[2903.54 - 2907.75] lots of checkups or cleanings right or
[2906.16 - 2909.28] clean as good I just always want there's
[2907.75 - 2910.90] a question that always pops up that I
[2909.28 - 2912.55] hear all the time like or too many
[2910.90 - 2914.83] cleanings good how many like cleanings
[2912.55 - 2917.20] do you get a year you know like that's a
[2914.83 - 2919.30] question I always them always asks again
[2917.20 - 2921.70] find the dentist who you can trust and
[2919.30 - 2924.25] we will we assess our patients and we
[2921.70 - 2925.54] propose the timeline for cleanings some
[2924.25 - 2927.52] people come twice a year
[2925.54 - 2928.96] some people come three times a year and
[2927.52 - 2932.50] other people need to come four times a
[2928.96 - 2935.41] year if you have heavy load of bacteria
[2932.50 - 2938.20] and viruses and your gut health is not
[2935.41 - 2939.97] great we see your teeth and gums
[2938.20 - 2941.82] deteriorating so we need to monitor it
[2939.97 - 2944.62] when we see that everything has improved
[2941.82 - 2946.93] you don't have to come in as often yeah
[2944.62 - 2950.89] you can come in twice a year I mean yeah
[2946.93 - 2953.31] the main thing is just to come in is
[2950.89 - 2955.11] amazing it feels changing in
[2953.31 - 2957.24] we do want to help I mean that's why we
[2955.11 - 2958.86] became dentists so you have to in our
[2957.24 - 2960.96] office or I'm sure it's kind of you know
[2958.86 - 2963.51] you want that trust with our patients
[2960.96 - 2967.07] we'll find somebody that you trust and
[2963.51 - 2969.60] go see them because it's not that scary
[2967.07 - 2971.79] you know like I have people throwing
[2969.60 - 2974.19] this at me all the time they're like hey
[2971.79 - 2975.78] aw I don't have any I don't have any
[2974.19 - 2977.97] toxic heavy metals in me
[2975.78 - 2979.20] there's no toxic heavy metals I mean
[2977.97 - 2981.57] that you know what I say is say did you
[2979.20 - 2983.31] have a fluoride treatment did you ever
[2981.57 - 2984.78] yeah I had a fluoride treatment at tons
[2983.31 - 2986.16] of them or no I don't get fluoride
[2984.78 - 2988.50] treatments but did you have ten of them
[2986.16 - 2990.30] when you were a kid and you're like
[2988.50 - 2991.65] right and you're like yeah yeah we
[2990.30 - 2993.39] shouldn't use to give everybody drops
[2991.65 - 2995.67] yeah exactly right
[2993.39 - 2998.34] fluoride byproduct of our aluminum right
[2995.67 - 3000.44] the severe neurotoxin but it's aluminum
[2998.34 - 3002.69] just because it's a byproduct doesn't
[3000.44 - 3004.13] mean it's not aluminum aluminum takes
[3002.69 - 3006.29] different forms that's how chemistry
[3004.13 - 3007.79] works so you know fluoride is actually
[3006.29 - 3010.54] aluminum it's just in a different form
[3007.79 - 3013.22] and so when you're getting aluminum
[3010.54 - 3014.78] treatments you have a lot of them a lot
[3013.22 - 3016.58] of heavy metal in you so I've had people
[3014.78 - 3018.65] say anything I don't have Meyers isn't
[3016.58 - 3020.87] me yeah you do you you do because this
[3018.65 - 3022.67] is business this happened to you do you
[3020.87 - 3024.74] know Anthony I don't have you know I
[3022.67 - 3025.34] don't have heavy metals in me yeah you
[3024.74 - 3027.14] do
[3025.34 - 3029.12] how many fluoride treatments have you
[3027.14 - 3032.42] had you know and that's just one aspect
[3029.12 - 3033.74] of getting metal in you so what do you
[3032.42 - 3035.57] guys do do you guys like do the
[3033.74 - 3038.27] traditional fluoride for everybody there
[3035.57 - 3040.49] or do no no no so you're basically
[3038.27 - 3042.71] groundbreakers you're just you just yet
[3040.49 - 3044.36] everybody everybody is trying to move
[3042.71 - 3048.35] away from them everybody's heading there
[3044.36 - 3050.69] I think so yeah everybody was
[3048.35 - 3052.70] prescribing high fluoride toothpaste
[3050.69 - 3055.52] they were doing floor treatments every
[3052.70 - 3056.63] six months for months and the results
[3055.52 - 3057.92] are there it's not really changing
[3056.63 - 3059.81] anything so I think a lot of people are
[3057.92 - 3061.69] stepping away from that which is huge in
[3059.81 - 3066.68] the deaf community because before I was
[3061.69 - 3068.90] the end you know when I fought fluoride
[3066.68 - 3070.70] back in the early days see no one
[3068.90 - 3072.56] realizes when they just get into health
[3070.70 - 3074.21] now if you get into health now you're an
[3072.56 - 3075.56] influencer in health because you're like
[3074.21 - 3076.87] you're eating better and you want to
[3075.56 - 3078.97] show your videos and you're in
[3076.87 - 3080.26] Lewin sir and you got your first acne
[3078.97 - 3082.51] and you want to like get it better by
[3080.26 - 3085.72] getting off of gluten you don't know
[3082.51 - 3088.15] with what would some of our open some of
[3085.72 - 3089.98] us old dogs you guys are young but some
[3088.15 - 3090.73] of us old dogs have gone through in the
[3089.98 - 3092.50] old days
[3090.73 - 3094.84] like for instance I went up against the
[3092.50 - 3096.82] fluoride thing back when and I was
[3094.84 - 3099.10] almost crucified for it I fought for
[3096.82 - 3100.66] where we are today in fact what I've
[3099.10 - 3101.74] done helped us get to where you are and
[3100.66 - 3103.93] I don't think a lot of people realize
[3101.74 - 3106.33] this or appreciate it and I understand
[3103.93 - 3109.09] why I totally get it but the whole thing
[3106.33 - 3112.21] man I remember being screamed at
[3109.09 - 3114.67] screamed at but people come in to see me
[3112.21 - 3118.18] their dentists calling me saying how
[3114.67 - 3119.82] dare you question fluoride I mean you
[3118.18 - 3122.59] don't know what we went through is
[3119.82 - 3124.81] unbelievable I mean it was like every
[3122.59 - 3127.24] day was you help and save lives but you
[3124.81 - 3129.25] get your ass kicked along the way every
[3127.24 - 3132.91] day all day long because you're up
[3129.25 - 3135.61] against old grandfathered laws that are
[3132.91 - 3137.35] evil and dark and that's the whole thing
[3135.61 - 3138.91] they're evil and dark because science
[3137.35 - 3140.41] and research thought they were on top of
[3138.91 - 3141.55] their game now but they weren't science
[3140.41 - 3144.13] research thinks they're on top of their
[3141.55 - 3146.17] game now but they're not because even
[3144.13 - 3148.12] though fluoride isn't so used so much
[3146.17 - 3149.98] science research believes your body's
[3148.12 - 3151.54] attacking itself your autoimmune is
[3149.98 - 3152.98] caused by your body which isn't true
[3151.54 - 3154.90] they believe your genes is all your
[3152.98 - 3157.06] problem but that's not true your
[3154.90 - 3159.28] problems or viruses and heavy metals and
[3157.06 - 3162.58] that's just two things there's other
[3159.28 - 3166.39] problems too but but basically the floor
[3162.58 - 3168.79] I think what oh my god the stuff I heard
[3166.39 - 3171.37] when when I would get when I would try
[3168.79 - 3174.10] to protect people or I would tell a mom
[3171.37 - 3176.65] just yeah if your child's got the worst
[3174.10 - 3178.45] case of Epstein Barr this is really bad
[3176.65 - 3180.55] things are bad or your child has a
[3178.45 - 3182.77] really bad case of strep you can't do
[3180.55 - 3184.24] fluoride right now you do a floor they
[3182.77 - 3186.10] do a fluoride treatment and then
[3184.24 - 3187.51] everything goes down you know downhill
[3186.10 - 3189.58] doctors are leavin everything's
[3187.51 - 3192.34] happening you just the thing is that the
[3189.58 - 3194.86] fluoride the fluoride business it was
[3192.34 - 3197.35] such an industry of just bankroll and
[3194.86 - 3199.90] there's so many still left you can't
[3197.35 - 3201.91] think we're safe because we're figuring
[3199.90 - 3204.13] things out now like that there's so many
[3201.91 - 3205.93] other landmines and potholes and traps
[3204.13 - 3208.15] that are grandfathered in that we're up
[3205.93 - 3209.87] against today floor I don't in fluoride
[3208.15 - 3211.34] still you know they're still using
[3209.87 - 3213.23] you're still using it they're still
[3211.34 - 3216.05] using mercury goings they're still using
[3213.23 - 3217.79] so using mercury cooling so yeah so the
[3216.05 - 3220.91] war is still on but it's nothing like it
[3217.79 - 3222.62] was but and then and then there's you
[3220.91 - 3224.75] know that was the whole floor I thing I
[3222.62 - 3226.67] find that when you use neurotoxins like
[3224.75 - 3229.07] fluoride and your viral you just go
[3226.67 - 3231.68] downhill quick so just don't ever do
[3229.07 - 3233.75] them fluoride treatments and don't get
[3231.68 - 3236.96] tricked into the natural fluoride
[3233.75 - 3239.03] concept because that's still not even
[3236.96 - 3243.28] the answer that's based off the old
[3239.03 - 3246.86] fluoride concept so what about that
[3243.28 - 3248.75] natural natural fluoride it's not that
[3246.86 - 3250.46] it's not the aluminum based ones it's
[3248.75 - 3252.32] like the more natural concept of
[3250.46 - 3254.36] fluoride the you know of the lake on
[3252.32 - 3256.16] that level and they they talk about they
[3254.36 - 3258.68] put it in natural toothpastes I think
[3256.16 - 3261.52] now they do other stuff so it's not the
[3258.68 - 3264.74] real toxic you know high neuro
[3261.52 - 3266.39] antagonistic level of aluminum so I mean
[3264.74 - 3268.31] I'm hearing some dentist was telling me
[3266.39 - 3270.74] about natural fluoride and he was saying
[3268.31 - 3273.44] how natural fluoride is it's safer it's
[3270.74 - 3283.01] it's got you know I wouldn't just buy
[3273.44 - 3293.24] into it no good it's because people are
[3283.01 - 3295.07] so there so that's what they teach you
[3293.24 - 3298.04] when you get out fluoride for it you
[3295.07 - 3299.90] know the president before our treatments
[3298.04 - 3301.25] that's what they tell you and you know
[3299.90 - 3303.44] it's kind of drilled in so it's hard to
[3301.25 - 3306.53] let go those old concepts but yeah it's
[3303.44 - 3307.76] really not doing anything for you so so
[3306.53 - 3309.50] what about gum disease
[3307.76 - 3311.99] ok so some of the people out that out
[3309.50 - 3313.49] there and they're gonna watch this they
[3311.99 - 3315.26] deal with gum disease in different ways
[3313.49 - 3316.85] and you know they get told if they're
[3315.26 - 3318.59] developing gum disease like what's your
[3316.85 - 3321.02] recommendations when you're dealing with
[3318.59 - 3322.97] gum disease - like how to keep your gums
[3321.02 - 3327.01] clean how to stop them from progressing
[3322.97 - 3329.84] is avoiding certain foods helpful I
[3327.01 - 3333.26] think gum disease is definitely related
[3329.84 - 3336.86] to God health we do see it all the time
[3333.26 - 3339.71] I mean gum recession just deteriorating
[3336.86 - 3341.60] gums deteriorating bone that's correlate
[3339.71 - 3343.23] to your gut health if you're eating a
[3341.60 - 3345.42] lot of processed food
[3343.23 - 3348.36] a lot of other foods that are not great
[3345.42 - 3349.98] for you we do see it and then you how
[3348.36 - 3354.93] doses comes back and all of that is
[3349.98 - 3356.94] intertwined if you lower the pH lower
[3354.93 - 3360.39] the acid from eating a lot of processed
[3356.94 - 3361.68] people drink six cups of coffee in the
[3360.39 - 3363.39] Shu drinking coffee
[3361.68 - 3364.47] I noticed a younger crowd still drinking
[3363.39 - 3366.87] coffee they walk around with different
[3364.47 - 3368.82] coffee coffee drinks all the time and
[3366.87 - 3370.80] they try to try to use it as their
[3368.82 - 3372.51] intermittent fasting weapon so what they
[3370.80 - 3374.34] do is they drink coffee all day so they
[3372.51 - 3376.65] don't eat all day so then they eat once
[3374.34 - 3377.79] and once once you know once a day so to
[3376.65 - 3379.53] try to pull the intermittent fasting
[3377.79 - 3381.24] game using coffee all the time and
[3379.53 - 3384.27] they're running around but are they
[3381.24 - 3386.16] causing problems for the future future
[3384.27 - 3388.23] because you're so acidic everything is
[3386.16 - 3390.48] breaking down in your mouth and it'll
[3388.23 - 3392.28] you know maybe not today they won't see
[3390.48 - 3395.76] it but in a couple of years they'll see
[3392.28 - 3397.62] it when they eating great food and they
[3395.76 - 3400.14] like my great food that's causing my
[3397.62 - 3402.72] countries it was the coffee which
[3400.14 - 3404.88] drinking for two years in the wrong yeah
[3402.72 - 3406.23] I believe in hundred percent what about
[3404.88 - 3408.72] this is a tricky one what about
[3406.23 - 3413.46] chocolate though you know I always tell
[3408.72 - 3414.84] people that's a tough one it I know it's
[3413.46 - 3416.73] yummy I know it's good I know people
[3414.84 - 3418.44] like chocolate I mean I'm not anti
[3416.73 - 3420.96] chocolate entirely I just know though
[3418.44 - 3422.73] for adrenals for you know spiking the
[3420.96 - 3425.61] adrenals it's really intense you got the
[3422.73 - 3427.83] caffeine right and so that's really hard
[3425.61 - 3431.79] but what happens is that I always find
[3427.83 - 3432.99] is adrenaline can also cost teeth damage
[3431.79 - 3434.91] and that's one thing I don't even know
[3432.99 - 3437.46] if I talked about it recently on a show
[3434.91 - 3439.23] or anything but adrenaline causes teeth
[3437.46 - 3441.96] damage the reason why I say that is
[3439.23 - 3443.76] because maybe then you see that people
[3441.96 - 3446.37] who are stressed out whether they have a
[3443.76 - 3448.77] loss in their life or just stressed
[3446.37 - 3451.68] around work or whatever it's happening
[3448.77 - 3453.36] stress people manifest prompts with
[3451.68 - 3456.36] teeth and gums for sure and we always
[3453.36 - 3458.34] say listen you under stress yes somebody
[3456.36 - 3460.95] just passed away I'm so upset I'm
[3458.34 - 3464.58] grieving and we see it we see it every
[3460.95 - 3466.71] day stress will break down temporarily a
[3464.58 - 3469.23] lot of times it's it comes it's in waves
[3466.71 - 3471.42] and then they'll come down eventually
[3469.23 - 3472.75] thank you thing is because it's rental
[3471.42 - 3474.52] in is gross
[3472.75 - 3477.40] it's the probably one of the most
[3474.52 - 3479.86] corrosive substances and so you know I
[3477.40 - 3480.97] talk about medical medium book 1 this is
[3479.86 - 3482.62] so cool that I got the books right here
[3480.97 - 3484.90] I just love this I love this YouTube
[3482.62 - 3487.48] live thing I mean I love it it's really
[3484.90 - 3489.43] cool and I don't know and so in this
[3487.48 - 3490.78] book I talk about the 56 different
[3489.43 - 3492.70] blends of adrenaline and what does that
[3490.78 - 3494.77] mean science research has no idea about
[3492.70 - 3497.26] this but adrenaline just isn't it isn't
[3494.77 - 3499.90] your cortisol and epinephrine it's not
[3497.26 - 3502.12] it's not that it's worse it's when you
[3499.90 - 3504.49] have a loss or you been through hell and
[3502.12 - 3506.05] back or you something's going on or
[3504.49 - 3508.02] financial problems something is really
[3506.05 - 3510.64] pushing you or you've been betrayed
[3508.02 - 3513.55] backstabbed maybe a best friend betrayed
[3510.64 - 3515.80] you because betrayal is is is really
[3513.55 - 3517.48] brutal it's so brutal and hard I'm sorry
[3515.80 - 3518.62] if you guys anybody ever experienced
[3517.48 - 3520.36] that I just want to tell you that I'm
[3518.62 - 3522.58] sorry and I understand because betrayal
[3520.36 - 3524.50] is really rough I mean everybody
[3522.58 - 3525.85] experiences at one point sometimes some
[3524.50 - 3528.25] people experience it worse than others
[3525.85 - 3530.74] is brutal trust when we get her trust
[3528.25 - 3532.24] broken when that happens and something
[3530.74 - 3533.98] that someone just breaks us back and
[3532.24 - 3535.84] breaks our back of trust you know and
[3533.98 - 3538.60] we're just like we're just we're spirit
[3535.84 - 3540.31] gets down and we get hit you know you
[3538.60 - 3541.72] you have a losses and everything else
[3540.31 - 3543.01] and what happens is when you're going
[3541.72 - 3546.07] through that there's a different blend
[3543.01 - 3547.78] of adrenaline to these things and and so
[3546.07 - 3549.55] adrenaline sports you got to be careful
[3547.78 - 3551.20] you're going for you know more highs
[3549.55 - 3552.61] with adrenaline sports I mean I love
[3551.20 - 3554.08] sports is the greatest thing ever but if
[3552.61 - 3555.82] it becomes this thing where you're
[3554.08 - 3558.91] obsessed and it becomes an adrenalin
[3555.82 - 3560.95] based you know direction you had to it
[3558.91 - 3562.39] aren't you you shorten your duration
[3560.95 - 3565.45] about you'll get other problems because
[3562.39 - 3568.15] adrenaline is so aggressive it's so
[3565.45 - 3569.74] abrasive that it works the bones it
[3568.15 - 3571.57] works on our bones it'll get you the
[3569.74 - 3573.34] osteopenia I mean especially if you have
[3571.57 - 3575.77] toxic heavy metals and high adrenaline
[3573.34 - 3578.14] you get the osteopenia you get different
[3575.77 - 3581.53] problems get the osteoporosis adrenaline
[3578.14 - 3582.70] is one of those acid dissolved basically
[3581.53 - 3585.67] it's a dissolvent
[3582.70 - 3588.46] and a solvent in a way to because it can
[3585.67 - 3590.44] run through bones and so and and teeth
[3588.46 - 3593.77] teeth are credibly that are susceptible
[3590.44 - 3595.78] to this so when there's a so so we can't
[3593.77 - 3597.91] we can't protect yourselves from every
[3595.78 - 3599.41] loss and from every betrayal and from
[3597.91 - 3600.94] every trust breakage and from all the
[3599.41 - 3603.25] how we go through whether you're young
[3600.94 - 3604.81] or older and we can't you know we can't
[3603.25 - 3605.94] protect yourselves from every bit of
[3604.81 - 3608.10] those things and really
[3605.94 - 3611.49] in ships and everything I mean I've seen
[3608.10 - 3612.87] I've had stories of you know a newly
[3611.49 - 3614.79] weds getting married they're
[3612.87 - 3616.50] 20-something years old and the 31 years
[3614.79 - 3618.66] old or something in that realm and they
[3616.50 - 3620.19] get married and then the girl comes down
[3618.66 - 3622.38] with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and the
[3620.19 - 3624.30] boys like I didn't buy into this I don't
[3622.38 - 3625.71] know what this is and it scares that you
[3624.30 - 3627.06] this used to happen and over the decades
[3625.71 - 3629.34] I've watched this for years and I'll
[3627.06 - 3632.10] suddenly break up and then it's like
[3629.34 - 3634.14] it's like it's it's a it's what happens
[3632.10 - 3636.42] is it hurts so much you can't avoid all
[3634.14 - 3639.27] these different things and I get this
[3636.42 - 3641.13] happens but I gotta tell you that when
[3639.27 - 3642.66] you take care of yourself you can defend
[3641.13 - 3644.07] yourself from that adrenaline you can
[3642.66 - 3646.38] defend yourself from that stress so that
[3644.07 - 3648.72] your adrenaline doesn't start taking
[3646.38 - 3650.04] down your teeth over time I've seen
[3648.72 - 3653.13] people go through a really trying time
[3650.04 - 3655.05] and a hard time and then the teeth
[3653.13 - 3657.90] become time capsules to what happened
[3655.05 - 3660.12] four years ago the adrenaline really was
[3657.90 - 3662.40] high then whipping them whipping you
[3660.12 - 3664.62] really hurting them and then four years
[3662.40 - 3667.17] later they're thinking it's everything
[3664.62 - 3669.12] else they're doing right but their teeth
[3667.17 - 3671.07] are falling when it was four years ago
[3669.12 - 3673.20] from a breakup they had a relationship
[3671.07 - 3674.58] or some kind of problem they had four or
[3673.20 - 3676.83] five six seven years ago
[3674.58 - 3678.36] and that's how it works and I don't you
[3676.83 - 3679.95] know and so this information is so
[3678.36 - 3682.62] powerful to help you guys and they're
[3679.95 - 3683.97] they're aware of it so basically there
[3682.62 - 3685.50] are things you can do like the celery
[3683.97 - 3687.42] juice to help protect you against your
[3685.50 - 3689.94] ear and hear the adrenaline from
[3687.42 - 3691.56] hardship and the wild blueberries and a
[3689.94 - 3693.15] lot of the medical medium information
[3691.56 - 3694.68] the different foods I talked about and
[3693.15 - 3696.90] and here's the last thing I want to talk
[3694.68 - 3701.85] about the no foods what foods to stay
[3696.90 - 3703.71] away from you guys are food experts you
[3701.85 - 3705.81] guys are doctors you guys know how the
[3703.71 - 3707.94] world works you guys all you know what
[3705.81 - 3710.49] what foods like are you thinking about
[3707.94 - 3716.52] on your end I mean well we personally
[3710.49 - 3718.17] implemented no eggs that was a personal
[3716.52 - 3721.40] choice everybody comes to it on their
[3718.17 - 3724.20] own time but we we've seen differences
[3721.40 - 3726.36] subtle differences bigger differences of
[3724.20 - 3730.50] deployments that have in my family with
[3726.36 - 3732.96] my kids my husband definitely celery
[3730.50 - 3735.63] juice and the detox heavy-metal smoothie
[3732.96 - 3737.97] is amazing it's really great I think if
[3735.63 - 3738.45] you stick with it for at least 30 days
[3737.97 - 3741.51] which
[3738.45 - 3744.78] so easy you will see the difference I
[3741.51 - 3745.95] know that's incredible because um I mean
[3744.78 - 3747.48] because you guys have witnessed it
[3745.95 - 3750.18] yourself that's the whole point we have
[3747.48 - 3751.89] and we you know we walk the walk we do
[3750.18 - 3755.73] it every morning I'd better start
[3751.89 - 3762.78] walking I'd better and this is the
[3755.73 - 3765.54] better uh please when I first started
[3762.78 - 3768.06] doing your protocols I was all about low
[3765.54 - 3769.47] carb no fruit egg whites every morning
[3768.06 - 3772.05] cuz that was what my trainer was having
[3769.47 - 3774.09] me go I mean that's what you need and it
[3772.05 - 3775.50] took time I've been doing celery juice
[3774.09 - 3776.19] now with my husband every morning for
[3775.50 - 3780.21] two years
[3776.19 - 3782.31] did I see results right away no but it's
[3780.21 - 3784.32] it's just changed our life my husband
[3782.31 - 3786.09] used to suffer from eczema he doesn't
[3784.32 - 3788.01] have that anymore I used to have just
[3786.09 - 3789.87] like bloating issues everything is gone
[3788.01 - 3791.49] it helps with like whenever you're
[3789.87 - 3792.41] anxious about something it just kind of
[3791.49 - 3795.93] calms you down
[3792.41 - 3797.79] it's little subtle changes and but start
[3795.93 - 3802.53] small start with the celery juice and
[3797.79 - 3804.99] get rid of eggs to eat the eggs will
[3802.53 - 3806.52] feed the viruses that's why you know the
[3804.99 - 3808.32] dairy products that feed the buyers is
[3806.52 - 3810.18] okay the gluten will feed the viruses
[3808.32 - 3812.07] nobody knew gluten fed anything until
[3810.18 - 3814.23] medical medium information came to town
[3812.07 - 3817.35] they just thought gluten created in
[3814.23 - 3819.69] fluent inflammation somehow but that's
[3817.35 - 3821.64] not how it works the gluten has to feed
[3819.69 - 3823.80] above the bug has to produce a poison
[3821.64 - 3825.39] then you get inflammation and that's
[3823.80 - 3826.74] information that only came from medical
[3825.39 - 3828.00] medium originally and I hear doctors
[3826.74 - 3829.38] talking about it now because that's how
[3828.00 - 3832.29] many books got out there but the point
[3829.38 - 3834.15] is is that the no foods is critical for
[3832.29 - 3835.71] dental issues for dental problems for
[3834.15 - 3837.54] keeping yourself healthy for making sure
[3835.71 - 3839.25] you don't fall apart down the road no
[3837.54 - 3840.93] foods is critical so whatever if you
[3839.25 - 3842.34] believe in some animal proteins you know
[3840.93 - 3844.80] eat them if you believe in being
[3842.34 - 3846.72] plant-based you to go that route or
[3844.80 - 3848.31] anything in between but just remember
[3846.72 - 3850.56] keep away your eggs your dairy products
[3848.31 - 3852.21] keep away of course your gluten duh but
[3850.56 - 3853.77] you know I say Doug because you know
[3852.21 - 3855.78] somebody we like oh well he you know
[3853.77 - 3857.58] somebody else knew that pride before him
[3855.78 - 3859.38] let me tell you I was telling people to
[3857.58 - 3862.41] get off gluten when I was four or five
[3859.38 - 3864.78] years old four five six years old and
[3862.41 - 3869.78] I'm an old dude and that was a long time
[3864.78 - 3871.68] ago I'm just letting you know and so a
[3869.78 - 3873.42] lot of concepts
[3871.68 - 3875.04] there now that have been out there
[3873.42 - 3877.35] because you know I spread them out I
[3875.04 - 3879.45] mean I've delivered that information a
[3877.35 - 3880.74] long time ago and now they're out there
[3879.45 - 3881.28] and people are trying to teach it back
[3880.74 - 3883.05] to me
[3881.28 - 3885.21] we're just hilarious and I love that
[3883.05 - 3887.82] it's good news it's so glad I'm so glad
[3885.21 - 3889.98] it got out there but the bottom line is
[3887.82 - 3891.87] that no foods is important so keep that
[3889.98 - 3894.06] in mind so you can stay healthy not feed
[3891.87 - 3897.27] your pathogens not feed your viral viral
[3894.06 - 3899.88] load not not cause any problems but uh
[3897.27 - 3904.89] this was incredible you guys I'm blown
[3899.88 - 3907.14] away I'm honored and anyway you can find
[3904.89 - 3909.18] these guys you know their name okay it
