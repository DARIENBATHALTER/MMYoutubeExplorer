1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
even if someone seems like the most

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,400
confident person their confidence is

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,620
over the top even if someone's ego is

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,660
just way up here they're still

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,700
soul-searching is there an end to the

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,260
soul searching and how many lifetimes

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,240
are we soul-searching people don't

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,300
realize it but we take all of our

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,000
experiences all of our knowledge we take

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,160
it with us when we leave here because

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,859
the physical brain isn't the only place

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,260
that harnesses information the neurons

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,680
and the glial cells isn't the only place

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,260
that's harboring information the soul is

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,860
harboring but experiences and

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,440
information our soul that resides here

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,420
is harboring information from every

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,860
single lifetime I hope that no one's

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,480
offended if I even say that because

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,480
someone might say no there's only one

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,640
lifetime that's it I pose a question to

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,100
you with tremendous respect and no

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,920
judgment if someone believes it's only a

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,620
one-time thing we're here we're gone we

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,660
have no soul everybody has their right

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,540
to believe in anything they believe in

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,060
but keep in mind we're in the present

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,280
time right now how is it possible we're

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,200
all here on the front line think about

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,200
that for a minute how is it possible

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,060
that we are on the front line of time

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,680
itself right now think about it every

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,080
minute that clicks forward every second

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,360
that clicks forward is the front line we

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,280
are on the front line right now you're

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,680
not in the past right now 500 years ago

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,619
you're not in the future 500 years from

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,680
now you're on the brink The Edge you're

39
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,200
on the front line pushing forward into

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,299
the future second by second by second by

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,240
second well how did you manage to end up

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,820
here after billions of years and

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
katrillions of people that have passed

44
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,000
and gone their life they died they're

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,579
gone centuries and centuries of people

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,460
thousands of years of civilizations how

47
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,200
is it possible with all that you think

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,520
we were just chosen to be on the front

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,619
line right now

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,540
at the very second that's pushing

51
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,040
forward into time out of all the

52
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,899
trillions of people the billions and

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,060
billions of people and the centuries and

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,920
the thousands of years Civilizations for

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,259
some reason were just picked to be on

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,980
the front line of time aren't we special

57
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:17,280
no it's because we came around again

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,500
which means we've most likely been here

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,959
before and before and before our soul

60
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,000
carries information you might not be

61
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,459
able to tap into it and tap into your

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,319
soul and the information that you've

63
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,120
taken over from Lifetime to lifetime

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,280
I've learned all this from Spirit of

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,160
compassion by the way you may not be

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,800
privy to the information that's passed

67
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,920
on over and over and over again meaning

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,180
into boom another body your soul you

69
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,099
live a life you get all these

70
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,019
experiences in for information you die

71
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,120
your soul contains that spiritual

72
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,760
information all that knowledge and you

73
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,099
may not be able to tap into it that you

74
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,099
think we're all here by chance just by

75
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,500
chance with all those people who have

76
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,760
been on this plan it alone never mind

77
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,140
how many people have been on other

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,379
planets you think

79
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,840
we've just suddenly have all just we're

80
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,400
here right now by a fluke registration

81
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,800
is open for the collecting Stones

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,840

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,459
part of your soul in such a good way
