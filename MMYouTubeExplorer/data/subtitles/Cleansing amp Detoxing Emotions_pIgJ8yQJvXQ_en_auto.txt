[0.24 - 6.54] before I start talking about cleansing
[3.54 - 9.60] and emotions what happens when we're
[6.54 - 12.66] cleansing cleansing out toxins and
[9.60 - 14.10] poisons out of our bloodstream out of
[12.66 - 16.32] our organs
[14.10 - 18.60] and all that poison and all that toxin
[16.32 - 20.94] comes out how it can trigger us
[18.60 - 23.28] emotionally how we can feel things

[196.20 - 200.58] but I do want to cover some cleansing I
[198.66 - 202.20] want to talk about that I don't know if
[200.58 - 204.96] you have this book I'm just reading a
[202.20 - 207.36] little bit of about that here
[204.96 - 210.02] all right
[207.36 - 210.02] so
[211.26 - 216.60] Heather says so do we pick out our own
[214.44 - 218.70] Stones ahead of time
[216.60 - 220.62] I would pick them out tomorrow on the
[218.70 - 223.26] first day of the collecting Stones
[220.62 - 224.82] meditation Journey you can pick them out
[223.26 - 227.34] before tomorrow you can pick them out
[224.82 - 230.28] today you can pick them out yesterday
[227.34 - 231.96] if you have to if you have no choice and
[230.28 - 234.30] you're available like you're available
[231.96 - 237.42] to do it like you have the option you
[234.30 - 239.52] have the the time whatever you can do
[237.42 - 241.08] that but tomorrow is the best day for it
[239.52 - 243.84] but I understand if you had to do it
[241.08 - 245.64] earlier you had to do it today
[243.84 - 249.00] everybody has a different set of
[245.64 - 251.22] experiences the Betrayal one person went
[249.00 - 253.68] through might have been substantially
[251.22 - 256.62] different from someone else's
[253.68 - 259.56] not everybody's betrayal is the same not
[256.62 - 262.08] everybody's pain suffering and
[259.56 - 262.92] experience from being betrayed is the
[262.08 - 266.04] same
[262.92 - 268.08] everyone is different
[266.04 - 270.12] the Betrayal that you may have had in
[268.08 - 272.64] your life is different than what someone
[270.12 - 275.76] else has gone through
[272.64 - 278.28] keep that in mind it's so important and
[275.76 - 281.58] yet maybe the negative impact it had on
[278.28 - 284.70] their lives could in some sense be equal
[281.58 - 286.86] someone could be betrayed
[284.70 - 289.02] in one way
[286.86 - 291.42] and somebody else can be betrayed in
[289.02 - 293.58] another way
[291.42 - 295.14] they won't seem equal when you hear
[293.58 - 297.54] about the Betrayal
[295.14 - 301.62] but yet it could affect us equally like
[297.54 - 304.74] we can still feel that experience I you
[301.62 - 306.54] let me down you broke my trust you
[304.74 - 310.40] betrayed me
[306.54 - 310.40] you stabbed me in the back
[310.62 - 315.78] sometimes people experience much more
[313.02 - 318.78] hardship more losses a lot of people
[315.78 - 321.12] experience hardship on planet mess
[318.78 - 323.22] more breakups as they look for love in
[321.12 - 325.14] their life how many people have
[323.22 - 328.10] experienced a lot of breakups a lot of
[325.14 - 332.16] relationship issues divorces
[328.10 - 334.14] relationship breakups separations
[332.16 - 336.00] so many people go through that and
[334.14 - 338.64] they're hurt and it builds up and it
[336.00 - 340.74] gets stored up inside
[338.64 - 342.48] hence why it's so important to do the
[340.74 - 344.88] collecting Stones meditation journey to
[342.48 - 346.98] pull that stuff out so it's not sitting
[344.88 - 349.44] in there and it's not festering and it's
[346.98 - 352.14] not in there and it's not rotting and
[349.44 - 355.68] festering because our hurt can actually
[352.14 - 356.52] sit in ourselves and just fester in
[355.68 - 358.62] there
[356.52 - 361.52] and so we want to get that drawn out
[358.62 - 361.52] like a Venom
[362.82 - 367.50] business relationships that are hurtful
[365.10 - 370.14] rather than fruitful so many people
[367.50 - 371.94] partner up with people going to Biz with
[370.14 - 374.64] people try to start something with
[371.94 - 376.80] people and instead of it being fruitful
[374.64 - 379.44] it becomes hurtful
[376.80 - 382.50] and as people find their way find their
[379.44 - 384.42] true calling they crawl out of the
[382.50 - 387.00] depths of a hardship they thought was
[384.42 - 389.46] their fault and in reality was the
[387.00 - 391.86] depths of Darkness
[389.46 - 394.56] some people see Darkness for what it is
[391.86 - 397.32] and many don't
[394.56 - 399.84] many people choose to kind of like
[397.32 - 401.58] put the blinders on they don't want to
[399.84 - 404.58] see the darkness
[401.58 - 407.22] they kind of just don't want to admit or
[404.58 - 409.26] have the realization that
[407.22 - 412.62] there was something dark going on there
[409.26 - 414.60] with that person or however and they
[412.62 - 416.52] just don't really see it so they don't
[414.60 - 418.86] they put the blinders on they don't want
[416.52 - 421.76] to drop the blinders they don't want to
[418.86 - 421.76] be able to see
[422.52 - 426.90] they have different ways of handling
[425.10 - 428.76] difficult memories and experiences
[426.90 - 430.98] that's a whole other difference between
[428.76 - 434.46] so many people
[430.98 - 438.68] so many have difficult
[434.46 - 438.68] way they have difficult experiences
[438.90 - 444.60] Korean says what book are you reading
[441.00 - 446.76] from please page 458 if you don't have
[444.60 - 448.56] cleanse the heel you're missing out
[446.76 - 450.72] it's one of the most powerful books of
[448.56 - 454.44] all time in health
[450.72 - 457.56] millions of these books got around the
[454.44 - 459.84] world and have changed people's lives in
[457.56 - 462.06] such a way like getting like getting
[459.84 - 465.48] them out of the darkest situations with
[462.06 - 467.34] their health pulling them out of hell
[465.48 - 470.04] that they were in and suffering and
[467.34 - 473.18] struggling and taking them into such a
[470.04 - 473.18] great place of healing
[475.50 - 480.62] the information in this book is just so
[477.78 - 480.62] powerful by the way
[481.32 - 485.58] so this is a really
[483.48 - 487.86] powerful piece of information I'm
[485.58 - 489.78] reading right here
[487.86 - 491.70] so many people have different ways of
[489.78 - 493.98] handling difficult memories and
[491.70 - 496.44] experiences
[493.98 - 497.94] we have a glitch I see on IG it looks
[496.44 - 499.74] like the connection is just going and
[497.94 - 502.02] going and going
[499.74 - 504.18] but so many people
[502.02 - 507.90] they handle memories and experiences
[504.18 - 511.26] differently some people just wall It Off
[507.90 - 513.18] it's like a mechanism that occurs where
[511.26 - 515.88] they can wall it off they can put a wall
[513.18 - 517.32] up some people are in in a place where
[515.88 - 519.54] there's so much PTSD and they're
[517.32 - 520.92] struggling so much they can't put that
[519.54 - 524.34] wall up
[520.92 - 526.74] it's not possible for them
[524.34 - 529.92] there's they feel so vulnerable they
[526.74 - 531.12] feel so exposed with that experience and
[529.92 - 533.82] that memory
[531.12 - 536.04] Walling off Walling it off becomes very
[533.82 - 538.92] difficult and they're trapped in the
[536.04 - 541.16] PTSD of whatever that experience was or
[538.92 - 541.16] is
[543.36 - 546.84] they have different different ways of
[544.98 - 549.24] handling hardships memories and
[546.84 - 551.40] experiences releasing as much as they
[549.24 - 553.26] safely can while some memories become
[551.40 - 555.36] buried in the subconscious so this is
[553.26 - 558.60] what happens with people you go through
[555.36 - 561.72] an experience you move forward
[558.60 - 563.34] and it's buried in the subconsciousness
[561.72 - 565.50] that hardship
[563.34 - 567.12] that hard time that struggle something
[565.50 - 569.40] they went through
[567.12 - 572.84] it's now buried
[569.40 - 572.84] in their subconsciousness
[573.48 - 576.84] well we're all different our experiences
[575.28 - 578.64] there is still a Sisterhood and
[576.84 - 580.26] Brotherhood to what we go through in
[578.64 - 582.96] this life so even though we all have
[580.26 - 586.44] different experiences
[582.96 - 588.90] some of us can bury it into our
[586.44 - 591.42] move forward some of us are trapped in
[588.90 - 594.18] the PTSD in in the moment and just can't
[591.42 - 598.32] seem to shake it can't seem to push it
[594.18 - 600.18] off anywhere but regardless We're All in
[598.32 - 602.66] This Brotherhood and Sisterhood as we go
[600.18 - 602.66] through life
[603.36 - 607.76] if you're having problems on IG head to
[605.40 - 607.76] Telegram
[608.28 - 612.42] the chronically you'll often find power
[610.32 - 614.64] in numbers when they connect over their
[612.42 - 616.20] shared suffering and that's the thing
[614.64 - 617.76] the chronically ill have been swept
[616.20 - 620.78] under the carpet they've been beaten
[617.76 - 620.78] down through the generations
[620.88 - 626.22] they've been treated like lepers even in
[623.88 - 627.66] the world of health and wellness and
[626.22 - 629.22] what you'll notice now with chronic
[627.66 - 631.08] illness
[629.22 - 633.60] is that chronic illness is getting some
[631.08 - 636.36] more respect the medical medium books
[633.60 - 639.44] the last decade of putting information
[636.36 - 642.24] out there for the chronically ill
[639.44 - 644.16] information that's been life-saving and
[642.24 - 646.32] moving them forward and validating the
[644.16 - 648.60] real symptoms and conditions has changed
[646.32 - 650.40] and shaped the health and wellness world
[648.60 - 653.76] right now
[650.40 - 655.26] where now it's becoming a little trendy
[653.76 - 658.08] for people in the health and wellness
[655.26 - 659.70] and influencers to acknowledge the
[658.08 - 661.62] chronically ill a little bit even if
[659.70 - 664.28] they don't understand
[661.62 - 664.28] or know
[675.00 - 679.28] the one thing about doing going live
[684.48 - 691.70] when it happens and you can't avoid
[687.96 - 691.70] anything else but I think we're here
[692.64 - 696.24] so the chronically you'll often find
[694.38 - 699.26] power in numbers when they connect over
[696.24 - 699.26] they're shared
[702.60 - 706.70] we're having a tech problem
[709.56 - 712.46] check one two
[722.70 - 727.46] this is when you're not live you can be
[724.38 - 727.46] like let's edit this out
[732.02 - 736.92] even if some of these physical symptoms
[734.46 - 739.08] vary with one person experience
[736.92 - 740.94] migraines anxiety or depression in
[739.08 - 745.52] another person going through back pain
[740.94 - 745.52] and neck pain or insomnia
[747.78 - 752.46] everybody who's chronically sick who's
[750.36 - 754.68] really suffered and struggled and
[752.46 - 756.12] understands what it's like to go through
[754.68 - 759.12] what they're going through
[756.12 - 761.16] can relate to another person who's going
[759.12 - 763.98] through it
[761.16 - 766.14] that's what's incredible about
[763.98 - 767.88] the chronically ill about people who
[766.14 - 769.14] have struggled and suffered and been
[767.88 - 772.14] through a lot
[769.14 - 774.36] they can relate
[772.14 - 775.92] to someone else who's struggling and
[774.36 - 778.50] suffering and I think that's what makes
[775.92 - 781.26] the medical meme community so powerful
[778.50 - 783.54] and that's what people don't understand
[781.26 - 786.00] out there
[783.54 - 788.58] including the haters and the critics and
[786.00 - 790.62] stuff like that they don't know why
[788.58 - 792.78] there's such a strong bond in the
[790.62 - 794.28] medical medium Community with people who
[792.78 - 796.02] care about each other
[794.28 - 797.94] because when they've been through
[796.02 - 799.68] something
[797.94 - 801.54] they
[799.68 - 804.06] understand
[801.54 - 806.40] and they recognize that someone else
[804.06 - 808.86] could be going through the same
[806.40 - 812.34] someone else
[808.86 - 814.68] could be going through something similar
[812.34 - 818.06] and it's this connection
[814.68 - 818.06] it's really powerful
[819.30 - 826.10] it's being able to understand what the
[821.94 - 826.10] other person is going through
[828.84 - 832.74] we've all experienced relationships
[830.82 - 834.78] whether with friends family members
[832.74 - 838.02] spouses or others that became difficult
[834.78 - 840.72] or even harmful in some way many of us
[838.02 - 843.18] have had experience physical injury that
[840.72 - 844.92] went along with emotional injury we've
[843.18 - 847.26] all been let down
[844.92 - 850.08] either way physically or emotionally
[847.26 - 851.76] even when the details are different we
[850.08 - 853.86] can find enough similarities to one
[851.76 - 855.72] another's hurt to identify with each
[853.86 - 858.54] other
[855.72 - 860.28] if you've been hurt emotionally
[858.54 - 862.32] and you know somebody else who's been
[860.28 - 865.62] hurt emotionally
[862.32 - 867.72] there's a way to identify and connect if
[865.62 - 869.34] you've been hurt physically or you're
[867.72 - 870.36] sick physically with chronic illness and
[869.34 - 872.46] you're really struggling like
[870.36 - 873.66] neurological problems
[872.46 - 875.76] and you have all the different
[873.66 - 878.04] neurological symptoms and you've been to
[875.76 - 879.90] 50 doctors
[878.04 - 882.66] and you talk to somebody else who has
[879.90 - 885.90] neurological problems
[882.66 - 887.82] there's this similar experience even
[885.90 - 891.48] though they're different
[887.82 - 894.80] that's what makes the chronically ill
[891.48 - 897.84] truly like bond in numbers
[894.80 - 899.46] especially if they're people
[897.84 - 901.32] who have been sick and they've gone
[899.46 - 903.66] through so much not being validated
[901.32 - 905.52] being told they're crazy being told that
[903.66 - 907.68] it's all in their head being told that
[905.52 - 910.38] it's their fault of why they're sick
[907.68 - 912.54] being told that they maybe manifested
[910.38 - 914.94] their sickness being told that
[912.54 - 917.04] it's their fault they're a faulty person
[914.94 - 918.12] being told that it's their genes or
[917.04 - 920.76] genetic
[918.12 - 923.84] makeup of their body
[920.76 - 923.84] all these things
[926.46 - 930.00] if we're not isolated from those who
[928.50 - 932.60] have gone through similar situations
[930.00 - 935.64] sometimes we feel completely alone
[932.60 - 937.80] especially when the experts we consult
[935.64 - 940.14] or the people in our lives imply or
[937.80 - 942.00] outright tell us that we've imagined or
[940.14 - 943.86] created our illness do you know anybody
[942.00 - 945.00] that's ever been told they created their
[943.86 - 947.46] illness
[945.00 - 950.88] do you guys I don't ask you guys enough
[947.46 - 952.62] like questions around that do you know
[950.88 - 954.60] anybody
[952.62 - 956.34] that they were told they must be
[954.60 - 959.58] creating their sickness
[956.34 - 962.64] they must be creating their illness
[959.58 - 964.32] I'm not sure if any of you guys have run
[962.64 - 967.22] into anybody like that or you know
[964.32 - 967.22] anybody like that
[967.32 - 972.36] because so many people
[969.72 - 973.32] are told they created it it's their
[972.36 - 975.48] fault
[973.32 - 977.34] they're the reason
[975.48 - 979.32] they're thinking
[977.34 - 981.96] their thought process
[979.32 - 983.70] they haven't figured out how to correct
[981.96 - 986.66] their thought process
[983.70 - 986.66] to stop it
[986.82 - 992.16] there's still a stigma Around The
[988.92 - 994.62] Chronic suffering a result of how little
[992.16 - 998.66] it's understood it can be hard to find
[994.62 - 998.66] true help from someone who gets it
[999.06 - 1004.34] that's another thing too is how many
[1001.64 - 1008.08] people have been seeking help for their
[1004.34 - 1008.08] chronic illness seeking help
[1008.36 - 1014.42] for their pain and suffering
[1010.70 - 1015.68] and they can't find a professional that
[1014.42 - 1017.42] gets it
[1015.68 - 1019.40] they can't find a professional that
[1017.42 - 1021.80] understands it
[1019.40 - 1024.50] maybe they do and maybe it takes 10
[1021.80 - 1026.48] professionals maybe it takes 15 20
[1024.50 - 1030.44] health professionals
[1026.48 - 1032.54] maybe it takes 30. but finding someone
[1030.44 - 1035.12] to understand what they're going through
[1032.54 - 1036.44] and that gets it is
[1035.12 - 1040.00] so
[1036.44 - 1040.00] so hard for so many
[1040.58 - 1045.74] it can be hard to find true help from
[1043.04 - 1048.02] someone who gets it rest assured even if
[1045.74 - 1050.00] you believe that you are the only one to
[1048.02 - 1052.52] know the particular pain of fighting for
[1050.00 - 1054.92] your life well those around you look at
[1052.52 - 1057.20] you with skepticism that your muscle
[1054.92 - 1058.58] stiffness or brain fog or fatigue is
[1057.20 - 1062.90] really that bad
[1058.58 - 1065.24] others who Bend through near nearly the
[1062.90 - 1068.30] exact same struggle are out there and
[1065.24 - 1072.56] that leads us to this whole thing
[1068.30 - 1073.94] even if you can't find someone that
[1072.56 - 1075.50] truly believes what you're suffering
[1073.94 - 1078.56] with and what you're going through even
[1075.50 - 1081.86] if you can't convince someone
[1078.56 - 1084.74] that what your symptoms are are real
[1081.86 - 1087.20] like the chronic fatigue that you have
[1084.74 - 1089.00] all the twitching and the Tremors and
[1087.20 - 1090.74] the pain and the panic attacks and the
[1089.00 - 1093.44] anxiety and the headaches and the
[1090.74 - 1096.74] migraines even
[1093.44 - 1098.90] if you can't find someone or you don't
[1096.74 - 1101.36] know someone that really gets it that
[1098.90 - 1102.98] really understands your struggles and
[1101.36 - 1104.60] your suffering and the pain you're in
[1102.98 - 1106.82] and your symptoms
[1104.60 - 1108.80] just know there's somebody out there
[1106.82 - 1110.30] that's going through it as well there's
[1108.80 - 1113.30] somebody out there that understands
[1110.30 - 1116.38] that's going through
[1113.30 - 1116.38] what you're going through
[1118.52 - 1122.78] the emotions that went along with
[1120.56 - 1124.82] fighting to be heard are some of what we
[1122.78 - 1126.44] release when we cleanse so this goes
[1124.82 - 1127.34] into the cleansing a little bit I wanted
[1126.44 - 1129.92] to
[1127.34 - 1134.36] head to the cleansing aspect
[1129.92 - 1136.52] of this Courtney says the
[1134.36 - 1138.50] the migraines are brutal for you the
[1136.52 - 1140.60] margarines
[1138.50 - 1142.96] so I'm reading out a cleanse the heel
[1140.60 - 1142.96] right here
[1143.18 - 1146.62] migraine I see that
[1146.96 - 1152.60] I'm reading out a cleanse the heel I'm
[1149.24 - 1154.46] talking about cleansing And the emotions
[1152.60 - 1157.60] involved a little bit
[1154.46 - 1157.60] so that's where we are
[1162.56 - 1165.92] the emotions that went along with
[1164.12 - 1167.84] fighting to be heard are some of what we
[1165.92 - 1171.14] release when we cleanse
[1167.84 - 1173.30] so when we start to heal and we start to
[1171.14 - 1174.98] cleanse
[1173.30 - 1176.78] emotions
[1174.98 - 1181.70] are releasing
[1176.78 - 1185.20] Trish on Facebook it's page 459.
[1181.70 - 1185.20] so 4 59.
[1187.34 - 1192.98] we release
[1189.02 - 1195.86] a lot of our old hurt when we cleanse
[1192.98 - 1198.32] we release information that's in our
[1195.86 - 1200.80] cells that's in our organs when we
[1198.32 - 1200.80] cleanse
[1202.52 - 1207.44] those struggles also lead to emotional
[1205.58 - 1209.30] based adrenaline that flowed through our
[1207.44 - 1210.56] veins and got stored in our cells and
[1209.30 - 1212.54] this leads to something that's really
[1210.56 - 1214.70] important anytime we go through an
[1212.54 - 1217.06] emotional experience an adrenaline surge
[1214.70 - 1217.06] occurs
[1217.34 - 1222.14] a surge of adrenaline
[1219.80 - 1225.20] fires up
[1222.14 - 1226.88] if you hear bad news your adrenals start
[1225.20 - 1228.86] to pump
[1226.88 - 1231.20] and they're releasing all of this
[1228.86 - 1233.90] corrosive adrenaline
[1231.20 - 1235.64] and all of that adrenaline is flooding
[1233.90 - 1237.44] every cell inside your body it's going
[1235.64 - 1239.96] through your bones it's going into your
[1237.44 - 1241.94] bones the cells of the inside your bones
[1239.96 - 1243.38] the cells inside your organs your
[1241.94 - 1245.18] connective tissue
[1243.38 - 1247.82] it's going it's rushing through your
[1245.18 - 1249.50] lymphatic system it's going into your
[1247.82 - 1252.50] nervous system it's going into your
[1249.50 - 1254.48] brain it's going throughout your body
[1252.50 - 1257.60] so in any time we go through something
[1254.48 - 1259.40] any kind of experience
[1257.60 - 1262.28] we get this
[1259.40 - 1265.22] surge of adrenaline
[1262.28 - 1267.44] firing up into our bloodstream
[1265.22 - 1270.26] and all that adrenaline has to find its
[1267.44 - 1273.32] way either out of the body or it stores
[1270.26 - 1277.76] itself into fat cells
[1273.32 - 1283.12] it stores itself into organ tissue
[1277.76 - 1283.12] and that adrenaline harbored information
[1283.22 - 1288.50] because when we go through a difficult
[1285.26 - 1290.12] time like fear or betrayal or some kind
[1288.50 - 1291.68] of chaos that happens in our life
[1290.12 - 1295.72] whatever that is
[1291.68 - 1295.72] or we're just upset about something
[1296.18 - 1300.98] that information
[1298.40 - 1303.86] this gets transmuted it gets transmuted
[1300.98 - 1307.58] into that adrenaline and infuses itself
[1303.86 - 1309.86] into cells and it sticks around into our
[1307.58 - 1312.50] fat storage in our body into our fat
[1309.86 - 1315.04] cells in our body into tissue and organ
[1312.50 - 1315.04] tissue
[1317.24 - 1322.46] so struggles that we have lead to
[1319.10 - 1324.44] emotional based adrenaline that flowed
[1322.46 - 1329.36] through our veins and got stored in our
[1324.44 - 1335.44] cells now get ready for this as we detox
[1329.36 - 1335.44] as we start to cleanse and detox to heal
[1336.98 - 1342.68] some of the feelings may come back up
[1339.44 - 1344.24] that were in that adrenaline going all
[1342.68 - 1345.92] the way back
[1344.24 - 1348.62] so if you had something happen to you
[1345.92 - 1351.50] last year or six months ago
[1348.62 - 1353.54] or two years ago or ten years ago or
[1351.50 - 1355.16] even further in your life if you went
[1353.54 - 1356.84] through some abuse if you went through
[1355.16 - 1358.82] some kind of hardship
[1356.84 - 1361.22] some kind of
[1358.82 - 1363.02] difficult time a relationship a
[1361.22 - 1367.52] situation
[1363.02 - 1369.32] and it created an adrenaline surge
[1367.52 - 1372.08] throughout your body
[1369.32 - 1373.58] that adrenaline was released during that
[1372.08 - 1376.40] hard time
[1373.58 - 1378.08] so adrenaline is coded it's got
[1376.40 - 1380.12] information in it
[1378.08 - 1383.56] it'll have information of that hard time
[1380.12 - 1383.56] that you went through information
[1383.66 - 1388.82] of that difficult time that betrayal
[1385.88 - 1392.54] that hardship that loss in there
[1388.82 - 1395.06] and then it stores deep in your cells so
[1392.54 - 1397.64] as we detox
[1395.06 - 1400.94] we might get some feelings that come
[1397.64 - 1403.82] back in different ways
[1400.94 - 1405.62] so when you're cleansing those poisons
[1403.82 - 1407.30] and toxins and you're restoring your
[1405.62 - 1409.34] physical body and you're bringing
[1407.30 - 1410.90] yourself back and you're working on your
[1409.34 - 1413.78] healing
[1410.90 - 1415.58] you may experience
[1413.78 - 1417.20] some sadness some different feelings
[1415.58 - 1420.74] some different experiences and different
[1417.20 - 1423.14] emotions that are coming out of
[1420.74 - 1425.84] the cells coming out of the fat cells
[1423.14 - 1428.60] coming out of the fat storage bin
[1425.84 - 1430.82] coming out of the liver
[1428.60 - 1432.44] coming out of the spleen
[1430.82 - 1434.66] if you guys want to know I'm in cleansed
[1432.44 - 1437.18] Hill right now I'm reading about detox
[1434.66 - 1439.76] and cleanse and emotions
[1437.18 - 1441.62] sharianna says on YouTube no wonder I
[1439.76 - 1443.66] can't lose weight yes struggles from a
[1441.62 - 1444.94] death of the family dealing with family
[1443.66 - 1447.02] members
[1444.94 - 1449.92] actors ship
[1447.02 - 1449.92] detectorship
[1451.88 - 1455.78] one person may find themselves with
[1453.92 - 1457.64] nostalgia
[1455.78 - 1459.50] that's almost uncomfortable in a way
[1457.64 - 1461.78] where they feel like something's going
[1459.50 - 1464.60] on what's this nostalgic feeling the
[1461.78 - 1467.12] sense I'm getting what is this
[1464.60 - 1468.20] so some people will have that come over
[1467.12 - 1471.26] them
[1468.20 - 1473.54] when they're cleansing and detoxing
[1471.26 - 1477.26] Pearl said wow I'm always amazed by the
[1473.54 - 1479.12] information thank you for being here
[1477.26 - 1481.10] Saints who says
[1479.12 - 1483.38] might want to try the anger shifter
[1481.10 - 1485.60] brain shot works better than any calming
[1483.38 - 1490.00] medication it has changed my life I used
[1485.60 - 1490.00] to be told I was born angry not anymore
[1491.18 - 1494.96] so one person can find themselves with
[1493.22 - 1498.08] that nostalgia
[1494.96 - 1501.92] another may go through intense dreams so
[1498.08 - 1505.46] when we're cleansing and detoxing
[1501.92 - 1507.86] we can go through some serious streams
[1505.46 - 1509.84] dreams of running away from people
[1507.86 - 1513.44] dreams of
[1509.84 - 1516.14] being chased dreams that don't make
[1513.44 - 1518.30] sense on any level dreams that are a
[1516.14 - 1520.54] little bit scary a bumpy ride dreams
[1518.30 - 1520.54] that
[1520.82 - 1528.32] that feel unsettling but we may dream a
[1524.42 - 1530.12] lot when we're cleansing and detoxing
[1528.32 - 1532.82] the reason why is because when you're
[1530.12 - 1535.04] cleansing and detoxing adrenaline is
[1532.82 - 1538.94] loosing up in those fat cells adrenaline
[1535.04 - 1540.74] is loosening up in the organ tissue and
[1538.94 - 1542.90] the cells in the organ
[1540.74 - 1544.70] and adrenaline is starting to leave and
[1542.90 - 1545.96] get into the bloodstream and it floats
[1544.70 - 1549.26] around and it's got these messages
[1545.96 - 1551.42] inside of it which is you hurt me a long
[1549.26 - 1553.46] time ago you didn't understand me a long
[1551.42 - 1555.68] time ago you didn't validate me a long
[1553.46 - 1557.90] time ago I was suffering I was going
[1555.68 - 1559.82] through a hard time
[1557.90 - 1562.70] and you didn't understand no one
[1559.82 - 1565.34] understood I had a loss I had a hardship
[1562.70 - 1567.80] something happened to me I had a breakup
[1565.34 - 1569.54] I had a bad divorce whatever it is that
[1567.80 - 1571.40] adrenaline is floating through the
[1569.54 - 1573.32] bloodstream in the veins and just
[1571.40 - 1576.38] swimming around and that adrenaline has
[1573.32 - 1578.78] information in it for when you had a
[1576.38 - 1580.40] difficult time in your life or a time
[1578.78 - 1583.76] that you didn't think was difficult at
[1580.40 - 1585.86] the time but it was difficult
[1583.76 - 1588.44] you were just in survival mode you might
[1585.86 - 1590.60] have been someone that was in survival
[1588.44 - 1594.62] mode
[1590.60 - 1597.32] and when you were in survival mode you
[1594.62 - 1599.60] didn't really know at the time and that
[1597.32 - 1601.28] moment how difficult things were you
[1599.60 - 1604.60] didn't know in that moment or at that
[1601.28 - 1604.60] time how hard it was
[1604.64 - 1610.82] it was really hard but you just were in
[1609.26 - 1614.72] survival mode and you had to move
[1610.82 - 1617.36] forward and Forge ahead but adrenaline
[1614.72 - 1619.58] was occurring during that time and it's
[1617.36 - 1621.62] stored inside the cells of the body it's
[1619.58 - 1625.76] stored inside the cells of your tissue
[1621.62 - 1628.82] your organs in your bones and then
[1625.76 - 1630.68] you started cleansing and detoxing you
[1628.82 - 1632.48] started doing it
[1630.68 - 1634.40] the right way
[1632.48 - 1636.44] that's safe for the body
[1634.40 - 1638.90] you started doing it in a powerful way
[1636.44 - 1641.72] that actually really does detox and
[1638.90 - 1644.96] cleanse and purify
[1641.72 - 1647.66] and you started doing that
[1644.96 - 1650.60] and then lo and behold
[1647.66 - 1652.82] something was being released
[1650.60 - 1656.24] something toxic something that was there
[1652.82 - 1658.28] for a long time something that was there
[1656.24 - 1660.56] when you were living your life years ago
[1658.28 - 1662.24] may not even realize how bad things were
[1660.56 - 1665.78] in that moment in your life
[1662.24 - 1668.00] maybe it was just a quick Moment In Time
[1665.78 - 1670.40] someone texted you something bad 10
[1668.00 - 1673.52] years ago whatever it was and it gave
[1670.40 - 1676.64] you a surge and boom it soaked into
[1673.52 - 1678.92] those cells and then it's coming out and
[1676.64 - 1680.26] some people have a lot of that inside of
[1678.92 - 1682.70] them they have a lot of hardship
[1680.26 - 1686.42] betrayal emotional
[1682.70 - 1688.48] distrust from broken trust and as
[1686.42 - 1690.62] they're cleansing
[1688.48 - 1693.74] that toxic
[1690.62 - 1696.38] information that's inside the cells that
[1693.74 - 1698.96] were stored there deep there from the
[1696.38 - 1703.10] adrenaline being so toxic started to
[1698.96 - 1706.22] release and dislodge and break out
[1703.10 - 1708.92] of its catacombs and start to release
[1706.22 - 1710.48] and go into the bloodstream and as it's
[1708.92 - 1712.46] circulating in the bloodstream you're
[1710.48 - 1714.32] having strange dreams
[1712.46 - 1716.12] you're having dreams that don't make
[1714.32 - 1718.34] sense you're having scary dreams
[1716.12 - 1721.34] uncomfortable dreams
[1718.34 - 1723.80] and then when you're awake you feel like
[1721.34 - 1725.96] some kind of nostalgia some kind of
[1723.80 - 1727.22] sadness comes over you you're thinking
[1725.96 - 1730.72] about things you haven't thought about
[1727.22 - 1734.72] in years you're emotionally detoxing
[1730.72 - 1734.72] emotionally detoxing
[1735.08 - 1739.52] is what you're doing
[1737.18 - 1742.04] that makeup chick over there in IG says
[1739.52 - 1745.28] I wonder if my friend's murder and all
[1742.04 - 1746.78] the grief has anything to do with all my
[1745.28 - 1750.28] health issues
[1746.78 - 1750.28] so sorry to hear that
[1750.50 - 1756.56] but when we go through something
[1753.92 - 1758.48] so intense
[1756.56 - 1760.16] where you go through something so
[1758.48 - 1762.20] catastrophic where a friend gets
[1760.16 - 1764.38] murdered or something happened in your
[1762.20 - 1764.38] life
[1764.60 - 1768.86] or a friend
[1766.52 - 1771.50] lost her life in a car crash or however
[1768.86 - 1773.42] it is if you've gone through something
[1771.50 - 1775.22] like that and it affected you
[1773.42 - 1778.16] emotionally then that means an
[1775.22 - 1780.74] adrenaline surged occurred
[1778.16 - 1784.58] and it was the fear
[1780.74 - 1787.94] the loss adrenaline it's the blend and
[1784.58 - 1789.80] that had to go somewhere and it tends to
[1787.94 - 1791.48] store inner cells especially if we're
[1789.80 - 1794.24] doing Comfort Foods at the time because
[1791.48 - 1797.36] we are we're doing Comfort Foods
[1794.24 - 1799.52] we end up doing comforting foods and we
[1797.36 - 1801.26] capture it in the comfort food it soaks
[1799.52 - 1803.54] up that adrenaline and then it stores it
[1801.26 - 1806.30] deep in her liver into the fat cells
[1803.54 - 1809.60] deep down in there
[1806.30 - 1813.44] Edith C on YouTube yes I just finished
[1809.60 - 1816.74] 369 cleanse that's aim here actually
[1813.44 - 1818.92] and had a lot of weird dreams now I
[1816.74 - 1818.92] understand
[1820.28 - 1824.72] Margaret Hurst says wow my dreams are
[1822.92 - 1827.36] crazy I have forgiven a lot of people
[1824.72 - 1829.28] after messages in my dreams
[1827.36 - 1830.78] this is the kind of healing that occurs
[1829.28 - 1832.94] when you're taking care of yourself when
[1830.78 - 1834.68] you're doing some cleansing Rachel Jones
[1832.94 - 1837.20] says I do the morning cleanse every day
[1834.68 - 1839.30] since February and have healed my gluten
[1837.20 - 1842.96] intolerance psoriasis nerve inflammation
[1839.30 - 1845.68] and I am so much happier as a result
[1842.96 - 1845.68] incredible
[1849.56 - 1853.58] it can be hard to find true help from
[1851.54 - 1855.20] someone who gets it out there
[1853.58 - 1857.30] and that's what I love about the medical
[1855.20 - 1859.58] meme community
[1857.30 - 1861.68] because people get it
[1859.58 - 1863.60] they get it here
[1861.68 - 1866.24] they get it now I know there's a lot of
[1863.60 - 1868.34] posers that come into here that pretend
[1866.24 - 1869.90] they get it they just want to take
[1868.34 - 1871.40] advantage of the medical meme Community
[1869.90 - 1872.24] I've seen this over and over and over
[1871.40 - 1874.52] again
[1872.24 - 1876.80] or they were really never that sick
[1874.52 - 1878.96] they don't understand that
[1876.80 - 1880.64] what real struggles are with their their
[1878.96 - 1881.72] health yet they're just not there
[1880.64 - 1884.48] they're just
[1881.72 - 1885.68] had a little bit not so sick stuff going
[1884.48 - 1887.42] on
[1885.68 - 1888.74] but man when you've been there you've
[1887.42 - 1890.78] been there and you know what it is and
[1888.74 - 1892.76] you know how to identify it Kim Miller
[1890.78 - 1895.16] says my mom said she never used to dream
[1892.76 - 1896.96] when she was on caffeine for years she
[1895.16 - 1898.22] got off the coffee and started dreaming
[1896.96 - 1900.32] again
[1898.22 - 1906.62] all coffee is another thing that
[1900.32 - 1906.62] suppresses emotions and berries emotions
[1907.64 - 1911.54] we walk around we spend a lifetime
[1909.70 - 1914.36] suppressing and suppressing and
[1911.54 - 1916.64] suppressing we spend a lifetime burying
[1914.36 - 1920.06] and burying
[1916.64 - 1922.22] goes into the old trash bin
[1920.06 - 1925.64] we spend a lifetime pushing it down
[1922.22 - 1928.22] shoving it down shoving it down
[1925.64 - 1931.84] right deep into the cells in the organs
[1928.22 - 1931.84] right down deep in there
[1931.88 - 1935.78] Diana
[1932.98 - 1939.02] says what is the best thing to do when
[1935.78 - 1940.76] you're detoxing this old adrenaline
[1939.02 - 1943.66] did you sign up to the collecting Stones
[1940.76 - 1943.66] meditation Journey
[1944.66 - 1949.10] it's a free
[1946.34 - 1950.78] incredible seven day healing Journey
[1949.10 - 1954.10] that starts tomorrow link is in
[1950.78 - 1954.10] description link is in a profile
[1955.82 - 1960.02] and when you recognize the emotions and
[1957.98 - 1961.94] you recognize the adrenaline
[1960.02 - 1963.50] if you recognize
[1961.94 - 1965.06] what these emotions are and where
[1963.50 - 1966.56] they're coming from they're coming from
[1965.06 - 1968.96] that Old adrenaline storage it's
[1966.56 - 1972.74] surfacing and coming out that's one way
[1968.96 - 1974.60] to help see you later alligator bye and
[1972.74 - 1976.84] have it leave the system and leave the
[1974.60 - 1976.84] system
[1978.08 - 1983.06] we spend decades in our life shoving it
[1981.26 - 1985.16] all down
[1983.06 - 1986.42] but when we let it out we can let it
[1985.16 - 1988.70] pass
[1986.42 - 1991.16] if we do a medical medium cleanse we can
[1988.70 - 1993.38] get it out and have it leave instead of
[1991.16 - 1995.54] recirculate
[1993.38 - 1997.28] and that leads me to the next thing I
[1995.54 - 1999.62] wanted to say
[1997.28 - 2002.98] if you're somebody that
[1999.62 - 2005.08] has a lot of toxic emotion stored from
[2002.98 - 2008.02] toxic adrenaline deep inside your cell
[2005.08 - 2010.72] tissue in your cell walls deep inside
[2008.02 - 2011.68] your connective tissue every part of
[2010.72 - 2014.62] your body
[2011.68 - 2016.18] deep in your liver what happens is that
[2014.62 - 2018.82] if you're not
[2016.18 - 2020.56] cleansing it out properly it recycles
[2018.82 - 2022.36] and recirculates and goes right back
[2020.56 - 2024.10] into fat storage or right back into
[2022.36 - 2026.92] liver storage
[2024.10 - 2029.02] so it kind of taunts you for years to
[2026.92 - 2031.36] come there's something in there that
[2029.02 - 2033.28] never was let out there's something in
[2031.36 - 2035.92] you that's been trapped in there for so
[2033.28 - 2038.14] many years and never got out
[2035.92 - 2040.84] and then it just kind of like haunts you
[2038.14 - 2043.00] and haunts you and you relive it a
[2040.84 - 2044.62] little bit not really unsure not sure
[2043.00 - 2046.60] what you're reliving but you're reliving
[2044.62 - 2048.40] it you're feeling it it's giving you
[2046.60 - 2050.86] that sense of like what's wrong with me
[2048.40 - 2052.60] what's wrong with me emotionally I must
[2050.86 - 2054.16] see another therapist I'm gonna have to
[2052.60 - 2056.76] see another therapist and another
[2054.16 - 2056.76] therapist
[2058.00 - 2063.10] a therapist shopping
[2061.18 - 2065.32] educating myself
[2063.10 - 2068.02] nothing like waking up to a bitter
[2065.32 - 2070.06] poison of utter and total betrayal
[2068.02 - 2072.34] educating myself
[2070.06 - 2074.62] yes indeed
[2072.34 - 2076.72] I concur greatly as you would probably
[2074.62 - 2078.52] know from the information
[2076.72 - 2081.12] and fall cities that are always swimming
[2078.52 - 2081.12] around out there
[2081.76 - 2088.24] Melanie Foss survival since 2013
[2084.58 - 2090.88] greetings from Germany at the moment
[2088.24 - 2092.74] I'm in the Netherlands incredible
[2090.88 - 2095.26] greetings
[2092.74 - 2097.42] Gina says if we have OCD is it okay to
[2095.26 - 2099.64] wear gloves when collecting and cleaning
[2097.42 - 2101.10] Stones until they are cleaned indeed it
[2099.64 - 2104.52] is
[2101.10 - 2104.52] indeed it is
[2111.34 - 2114.82] even if you believe that you are the
[2113.38 - 2118.42] only one
[2114.82 - 2121.18] to know the particular pain of fighting
[2118.42 - 2123.28] for your life well those around you look
[2121.18 - 2124.90] at you with skepticism
[2123.28 - 2128.10] that your muscle stiffness and your
[2124.90 - 2128.10] brain fog and your fatigue
[2246.10 - 2250.00] an experience where they're just
[2248.32 - 2252.34] bringing their lives back from so much
[2250.00 - 2254.32] they've been through
[2252.34 - 2256.60] this means that even as cells release
[2254.32 - 2258.76] old adrenaline
[2256.60 - 2262.06] that carries difficulties from our past
[2258.76 - 2264.16] it's not a reckless process
[2262.06 - 2267.16] your brain is getting critical glucose
[2264.16 - 2269.98] and mineral salts to give you grounding
[2267.16 - 2272.14] that you need
[2269.98 - 2274.00] you don't need to engage or process the
[2272.14 - 2275.68] emotions or feelings that come up on a
[2274.00 - 2277.36] cleanse and that's another thing too and
[2275.68 - 2278.74] need people to understand that when
[2277.36 - 2280.78] you're cleansing
[2278.74 - 2282.76] and emotions are coming out it doesn't
[2280.78 - 2285.34] mean you have to process them for them
[2282.76 - 2288.58] to leave and go
[2285.34 - 2290.08] that's something that's really important
[2288.58 - 2292.12] because when you're cleansing it's
[2290.08 - 2296.02] usually not the time or space to go deep
[2292.12 - 2298.96] into emotional grit you want it to pass
[2296.02 - 2302.76] through and go you want to you want it
[2298.96 - 2302.76] to leave the system and Purge out
[2307.72 - 2311.32] it's usually not the time or space to
[2309.64 - 2312.58] deal with emotions that are really
[2311.32 - 2315.24] intense when you're cleansing or
[2312.58 - 2315.24] detoxing
[2316.12 - 2320.86] but what I love about the medical medium
[2318.16 - 2323.74] cleanses Spirit of compassions cleanses
[2320.86 - 2325.42] is that it allows it to leave
[2323.74 - 2326.86] and that's why so many people are
[2325.42 - 2331.50] getting their lives back too because
[2326.86 - 2331.50] they feel they can stay on the cleanse
[2333.70 - 2337.96] everyone is different in how or when
[2335.92 - 2340.72] they need to process life sometimes
[2337.96 - 2344.14] mirror sometimes
[2340.72 - 2345.70] Miracle states of emotion or healing can
[2344.14 - 2347.14] happen actually during one of these
[2345.70 - 2349.84] cleanses
[2347.14 - 2352.00] and I see that a lot a great lifting of
[2349.84 - 2354.78] energy could occur a sensation of weight
[2352.00 - 2354.78] off your back
[2355.12 - 2359.38] I see the tech demons are after us today
[2357.40 - 2363.94] by the way they're just messing up our
[2359.38 - 2365.80] Tech in any way possible the tech devils
[2363.94 - 2368.26] Tech betrayal too laugh out loud
[2365.80 - 2370.68] educating myself yeah let's not forget
[2368.26 - 2370.68] that
[2371.02 - 2375.60] I think they just wait for me to go on
[2372.82 - 2375.60] and go live
[2376.54 - 2381.76] there's nothing better than a sensation
[2378.82 - 2383.86] that was so heavy Weighing on your back
[2381.76 - 2387.42] getting lifted
[2383.86 - 2387.42] lift it for good
[2389.20 - 2392.98] there's no rule about how our emotional
[2391.18 - 2393.70] processing is supposed to happen by the
[2392.98 - 2395.26] way
[2393.70 - 2398.56] everybody's different everybody
[2395.26 - 2400.66] everybody processes different
[2398.56 - 2403.12] usually the shift that they can have
[2400.66 - 2404.98] occurs after the cleanse is over when
[2403.12 - 2407.50] we've had enough time to gain insight
[2404.98 - 2410.50] into what's surfaced during the cleanse
[2407.50 - 2412.30] after the cleanse we become wiser in the
[2410.50 - 2414.90] emotional area in so many ways that
[2412.30 - 2414.90] leads me to this
[2415.18 - 2420.70] you're sick
[2417.94 - 2422.56] you find the answers
[2420.70 - 2424.84] you do one of the most powerful cleanses
[2422.56 - 2427.12] there is to heal that has a track record
[2424.84 - 2430.02] of people healing
[2427.12 - 2430.02] you get better
[2431.74 - 2438.34] and you get better and wiser for it
[2435.94 - 2440.26] and emotionally stronger
[2438.34 - 2443.28] you get sick
[2440.26 - 2443.28] you cleanse
[2444.70 - 2449.22] you heal you become wiser
[2450.94 - 2456.22] as we release poisons and toxins that
[2453.46 - 2459.28] were deeply embedded into cells of all
[2456.22 - 2463.12] kinds including fat cells that are now
[2459.28 - 2464.92] bursting and draining while we cleanse
[2463.12 - 2468.16] you know when you cleanse you guys fat
[2464.92 - 2471.10] cells are bursting and draining
[2468.16 - 2473.74] no one talks about that
[2471.10 - 2479.28] been talking about that for years
[2473.74 - 2479.28] we cleanse and fat cells are bursting
[2479.56 - 2484.72] they're bursting and draining while we
[2482.32 - 2486.34] cleanse those poisons and toxins that
[2484.72 - 2489.16] are now flowing through a bloodstream
[2486.34 - 2492.82] are on their way out of our body and it
[2489.16 - 2494.74] can affect our taste and smell as well
[2492.82 - 2497.20] sometimes while cleansing someone will
[2494.74 - 2498.52] taste a manufactured food they ate when
[2497.20 - 2499.66] they were a child they wanted to ask you
[2498.52 - 2501.88] guys that question do you ever
[2499.66 - 2503.74] experience that
[2501.88 - 2506.26] do you ever experience when your cleanse
[2503.74 - 2507.10] isn't when you're doing a cleanse in any
[2506.26 - 2509.74] way
[2507.10 - 2511.84] that you all of a sudden like I remember
[2509.74 - 2513.46] the taste that food when I was a kid
[2511.84 - 2514.96] that's a cheeseburger
[2513.46 - 2517.36] that I used to eat at this restaurant
[2514.96 - 2519.16] that's a chocolate cake I used to eat at
[2517.36 - 2521.80] this restaurant or
[2519.16 - 2523.60] that's just some candy I used to like
[2521.80 - 2526.00] years ago whatever it is there's
[2523.60 - 2527.86] something that comes up maybe some
[2526.00 - 2530.14] cookies that used to eat some packaged
[2527.86 - 2532.78] cookies from a long time ago and they
[2530.14 - 2534.28] surface and you can taste you can
[2532.78 - 2536.80] actually taste
[2534.28 - 2539.44] those cookies yes you've had dreams and
[2536.80 - 2540.78] chowing down on Fried Chicken Hannah
[2539.44 - 2544.72] totally understand you're on YouTube
[2540.78 - 2547.60] yeah you can have dreams

[3305.82 - 3310.38] million times over the last 35 years and
[3308.10 - 3312.62] I can still mess up the word while we're
[3310.38 - 3312.62] live
[3314.54 - 3319.10] this is who would have known
[3319.44 - 3322.22] seriously
[3323.94 - 3326.78] old hurt
[3327.42 - 3331.14] okay ready this doesn't mean that you
[3329.28 - 3333.78] become more emotional emotional after
[3331.14 - 3335.22] cleansing rather that you can become
[3333.78 - 3337.32] more emotionally protected and
[3335.22 - 3340.02] emotionally sound
[3337.32 - 3342.92] you cleanse properly you cleanse with
[3340.02 - 3342.92] powerful cleanses
[3344.10 - 3347.64] and you become emotional sound
[3345.84 - 3351.56] emotionally sound

[3352.38 - 3356.70] George Hughes over there on YouTube
[3353.76 - 3358.68] cigar smoker still once a month
[3356.70 - 3359.82] and I don't judge you for it I'm not

[3364.38 - 3369.78] years I got your back I got your back
[3366.78 - 3372.72] smoking is tough on the body it tips the
[3369.78 - 3375.96] scale in the wrong direction
[3372.72 - 3378.18] it's hard on the body but I do not shame
[3375.96 - 3380.34] or blame or
[3378.18 - 3383.84] judge anyone
[3380.34 - 3383.84] who's still burning coals
[3385.74 - 3391.56] old hurt can create such a brain fog
[3388.26 - 3393.42] allowing us to make the same mistake
[3391.56 - 3396.60] over and over again I read that wrong
[3393.42 - 3397.74] let's do it again old hurt can create a
[3396.60 - 3399.60] fog
[3397.74 - 3401.64] that's what it is not a brain fun
[3399.60 - 3403.92] allowing us to make the same mistake
[3401.64 - 3405.78] over and over again just as when we're
[3403.92 - 3407.10] in pain from burning our hand on the
[3405.78 - 3408.90] stove I got to tell you something so

[3434.28 - 3440.04] many of us dealt with secondhand smoke
[3437.58 - 3443.00] trust me many of us have dealt with
[3440.04 - 3443.00] secondhand smoke
[3444.84 - 3449.64] old hurt can create such a fog allowing
[3447.96 - 3451.80] us to make the same mistake over and
[3449.64 - 3453.72] over again just as when we're in pain
[3451.80 - 3456.78] from burning our hand on the stove we
[3453.72 - 3460.88] may turn away in fear and inner haste
[3456.78 - 3460.88] accidentally back into the fireplace
[3461.10 - 3466.32] when we aren't filled with poisons and
[3463.26 - 3468.86] fear-based betrayal-based harm-based
[3466.32 - 3468.86] adrenaline
[3470.22 - 3473.76] when we're not filled with all that crap
[3471.96 - 3475.56] anymore all that adrenaline and
[3473.76 - 3477.72] fear-based and harm-based adrenaline
[3475.56 - 3480.06] when it's out of our cells and out of
[3477.72 - 3482.46] our fat cells and out of our organs and
[3480.06 - 3485.82] out of our body and our bloodstream the
[3482.46 - 3488.22] door opens up old hurt can leave it can
[3485.82 - 3490.50] leave and you do the collecting Stones
[3488.22 - 3494.54] meditation Journey
[3490.50 - 3494.54] forget it wait till you do that
[3498.36 - 3502.62] we're going to be able to see the
[3500.10 - 3505.14] momentary pain clearly rather than find
[3502.62 - 3507.42] ourselves in a fog of old percolating
[3505.14 - 3509.58] hurt and that's going to let us take
[3507.42 - 3511.32] care of ourselves properly rather than
[3509.58 - 3514.62] hurt ourselves even more by making
[3511.32 - 3518.06] mistakes out of desperation
[3514.62 - 3518.06] you know your decision making
[3518.12 - 3522.12] comes clear
[3520.62 - 3523.62] comes clear
[3522.12 - 3525.90] you're cleansing you're getting the junk
[3523.62 - 3528.24] out you see the truth you know what's
[3525.90 - 3530.76] going on your healing your body's
[3528.24 - 3533.70] healing and things come clear and more
[3530.76 - 3536.28] clear and more clear Clarity happens and
[3533.70 - 3538.08] that's incredible Saint Suey says I
[3536.28 - 3540.42] can't believe I'm still alive after so
[3538.08 - 3542.54] many decades of abusing my body I'm a
[3540.42 - 3546.02] walking Miracle to be able to heal now
[3542.54 - 3546.02] drop the mic
[3546.06 - 3549.02] drop the mic
[3551.82 - 3557.28] so many don't realize that out there
[3554.76 - 3559.98] so many don't realize that
[3557.28 - 3564.74] after cleansing the right way you often
[3559.98 - 3564.74] become wiser beyond your years
[3567.00 - 3571.28] after cleansing the right way
[3571.92 - 3578.58] we often become wiser
[3575.64 - 3581.34] beyond our years
[3578.58 - 3584.00] Becca Johnson said 369 cleanse made me a
[3581.34 - 3584.00] lot wiser
[3585.80 - 3591.06] you may find yourself a little more
[3588.54 - 3592.92] guarded in a good way
[3591.06 - 3595.38] you may find yourself a little bit more
[3592.92 - 3597.98] guarded in a good way you're more
[3595.38 - 3600.90] cautious about when to be vulnerable
[3597.98 - 3603.06] make better decisions about whom to
[3600.90 - 3604.62] involve yourself with and whom to
[3603.06 - 3606.90] confide in
[3604.62 - 3609.54] and you're more intuitive about when to
[3606.90 - 3612.06] drop off your guard and open the door
[3609.54 - 3615.12] for a healthier friendship or
[3612.06 - 3617.28] relationship you become more keen
[3615.12 - 3618.96] you clear out the junk and garbage in
[3617.28 - 3620.82] the old emotions that have been sitting
[3618.96 - 3622.98] there rotting and festering and you
[3620.82 - 3626.46] don't recreate the same patterns over
[3622.98 - 3629.34] and over again you break the patterns so
[3626.46 - 3631.26] you're not a slave to those patterns so
[3629.34 - 3633.42] you're not stuck in that so you're not
[3631.26 - 3635.64] getting in another toxic relationship
[3633.42 - 3637.80] that takes you down so you're not
[3635.64 - 3639.66] getting into another bad friendship that
[3637.80 - 3642.66] takes you down so you know make another
[3639.66 - 3644.70] Wrong Turn you get clarity you cleanse
[3642.66 - 3647.34] you get rid of the junk the old crap
[3644.70 - 3649.68] that's stored inside every cell and
[3647.34 - 3652.14] inside every every organ in your body
[3649.68 - 3654.60] and you clear that out you get rid of it
[3652.14 - 3656.70] and you open the door you open the door
[3654.60 - 3659.34] to Clarity and what happens is you
[3656.70 - 3661.44] become more keen less reactive more
[3659.34 - 3663.84] mindful because when you rid yourselves
[3661.44 - 3665.94] of enough toxins and poisons and viruses
[3663.84 - 3667.98] and unproductive bacteria and old
[3665.94 - 3670.32] adrenaline that harbored past emotions
[3667.98 - 3673.34] you become better able to avoid
[3670.32 - 3673.34] repeating mistakes
[3673.98 - 3681.20] those are my words
[3677.04 - 3681.20] those are SOC words right there

[3909.60 - 3913.38] yes 100 percent
[3911.64 - 3916.08] on point aw
[3913.38 - 3918.30] I can attest to that
[3916.08 - 3920.58] as a former professional downhill
[3918.30 - 3925.10] mountain bike racer
[3920.58 - 3925.10] by the way me tube787 that blew my mind
[3926.04 - 3931.74] former professional downhill mountain
[3928.38 - 3934.86] bike racer no Training Day
[3931.74 - 3937.98] no Sprints no physical injury no
[3934.86 - 3941.94] completion can compare with the struggle
[3937.98 - 3945.12] and challenges of chronic illness it's a
[3941.94 - 3947.52] whole other level in my case brain fog
[3945.12 - 3951.48] neurological fatigue chronic fatigue leg
[3947.52 - 3954.30] pain Etc if I didn't have the experience
[3951.48 - 3956.46] of competing at the elite level I would
[3954.30 - 3958.62] have thought and believed that I was
[3956.46 - 3961.62] just weak and I've definitely thought
[3958.62 - 3963.66] that many many times as I was going from
[3961.62 - 3966.30] Doctor to sport doctor to Alternative
[3963.66 - 3968.64] doctor to Alternative sport doctor etc
[3966.30 - 3971.46] etc etc
[3968.64 - 3973.62] all training and competition seems like
[3971.46 - 3977.64] a walk in the park compared to the
[3973.62 - 3981.12] torture of chronic illness your word 787
[3977.64 - 3982.56] I often think how easy a heavy gym day
[3981.12 - 3985.94] is
[3982.56 - 3985.94] yeah people right
[3987.18 - 3993.90] I often think how easy a heavy gym day
[3990.00 - 3996.06] is or Sprints or com competition in
[3993.90 - 3997.68] comparison to the constant chronic
[3996.06 - 4000.38] illness suffering
[3997.68 - 4002.18] I'm definitely not as impressed as I
[4000.38 - 4004.64] used to be with the athletic
[4002.18 - 4006.74] achievements as I am with the
[4004.64 - 4010.54] achievements of the ones that are
[4006.74 - 4010.54] struggling with chronic illness
[4021.98 - 4026.60] and their strength to keep going and
[4023.78 - 4028.88] going forward and healing regardless of
[4026.60 - 4030.92] what the world around them might tell
[4028.88 - 4032.66] them
[4030.92 - 4035.06] I'm going to read that last line because
[4032.66 - 4037.88] I kind of messed it up are definitely
[4035.06 - 4039.92] not as impressed I'm definitely not as
[4037.88 - 4042.56] impressed as I used to be with the
[4039.92 - 4044.54] athletic achievements as I am with the
[4042.56 - 4046.94] achievements of the ones that are
