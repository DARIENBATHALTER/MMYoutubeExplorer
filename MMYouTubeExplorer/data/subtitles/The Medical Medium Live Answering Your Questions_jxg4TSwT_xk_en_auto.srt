00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,040
hypothyroidism which book should i start

156
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,360
with

157
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
okay look i mean i gotta i got the

158
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
thyroid healing book an incredible book

159
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
because it

160
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,440
covers everything from a to z about the

161
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,000
thyroid but you can do it in cleanse the

162
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
heel because

163
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,440
i talk about the thyroid and the

164
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,960
supplementation in cleansing heal i'd

165
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,800
probably go with cleanse to heal

166
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,080
maybe get both but cleansing heal would

167
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,440
be good because you can look in there

168
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,919
you'll see supplementation about

169
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,639
hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism nodules

170
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,759

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
know all medical medium information is

230
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,160
unique

231
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,440
original and from source for 35 years so

232
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,720
if you hear bits and pieces of it out

233
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,479
there you think it's already been out

234
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,840
there like it's crazy like i see people

235
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,039
out there saying things like

236
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,840
toxic heavy metals cause anxiety

237
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,080
dude that only comes from one source

238
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,840
there's no research in science that came

239
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,120
out with a paper saying metals heavy

240
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,400
metals cause anxiety

241
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,319
it only comes from medical medium

242
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,840
information it always has

243
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,520
there's nothing there's no study out

244
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
there that shows that but yet people

245
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,560
like even

246
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,199
practitioners out there will say anxiety

247
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,400
uh

248
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,479
you know metals have something to do

249
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,599
with anxiety are you kidding uh

250
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,680
that only comes from the source so

251
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,840
why don't you cite it please because

252
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,520
that's not from a research study paper

253
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,000
it's kind of funny how it goes um and um

254
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,360
so the thing is is that with this with

255
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800

feel like you're coming down with

335
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,200
something or something's going on but if

336
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,440
you use the wrong zinc it could have

337
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,600
citric acid in it could have some kind

338
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
of preservative in it so just make sure
