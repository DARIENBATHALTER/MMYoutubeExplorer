00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
How come people have low sodium in many

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,920
situations? They have low sodium because

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,400
they're not getting any of the correct

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,679
vital real sodium they need to be

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,880
getting from celery juices, from lemons.

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,279
Yes, lemons, from spinach. Yes, spinach.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,920
Even a cilantro has a little bit in

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,080
there. They're not getting it from

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,439
tomatoes. Tomatoes have a little bit of

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,920
natural occurring sodium in it, which is

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,320
incredible. Tomatoes. So these are

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,160
things that are critical for people for

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,280
their healing. That's the kind of sodium

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,280
that resets everything.
