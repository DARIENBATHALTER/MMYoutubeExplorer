[22.20 - 26.72] most advanced healing information
[24.72 - 28.88] decades ahead of what's out there now
[26.72 - 30.24] very important show we have going on
[28.88 - 32.84] this is a big one right here it's all
[30.24 - 34.40] about fasting all about fasting we're
[32.84 - 36.04] going to be talking about fasting juice

[36.04 - 38.80] fasting we're going to be talking about
[37.52 - 40.84] dry fasting we're going to be talking
[38.80 - 42.24] about all of it and it's it's a really
[40.84 - 44.52] it's really an important show I think it
[42.24 - 46.04] is because there's a lot of people doing
[44.52 - 48.24] different kinds of things out there and
[46.04 - 49.88] trying different kinds of things and and
[48.24 - 51.20] are they good are they bad do they work
[49.88 - 52.24] do they not work the whole bit
[51.20 - 53.84] everybody's different we're going to
[52.24 - 55.84] talk about why and how and what's the
[53.84 - 58.64] safest way to go about things and and
[55.84 - 61.40] what we can do so I mean this is really
[58.64 - 62.84] a good show because um because there's a
[61.40 - 64.40] lot of confusion out there and I want to
[62.84 - 66.72] air out that confusion and I want to
[64.40 - 68.72] make sure I want to make sure that
[66.72 - 71.80] everybody has the best opportunity to
[68.72 - 74.08] heal on all levels now what you're going
[71.80 - 76.00] to find out is that I don't have this
[74.08 - 79.08] belief system I'm not swallowed up into
[76.00 - 81.04] a belief system that's that's also
[79.08 - 83.96] supported with all kinds of excuse me
[81.04 - 86.16] that's also supported with all kinds of
[83.96 - 88.00] supplements that you know packages you
[86.16 - 90.12] have to buy and you have to buy a
[88.00 - 92.44] package from me or you have to buy you
[90.12 - 94.92] know hey here's part of my fasting kit
[92.44 - 97.28] here's part of my fasting thing oh here
[94.92 - 99.92] you know do this do my fasting course
[97.28 - 102.24] pay this pay $1,400 pay
[99.92 - 103.92] $5,000 you know like you're not going to
[102.24 - 105.72] get any of that from me there's nothing
[103.92 - 109.40] there's no belief system sucked into a
[105.72 - 110.88] moneymaking machine on this end so
[109.40 - 112.76] that's something everybody needs to know
[110.88 - 114.44] with all my shows all my information all
[112.76 - 117.08] the information I put out everything
[114.44 - 118.96] else and so it's very critical to
[117.08 - 121.36] understand that I don't even sell my own
[118.96 - 123.36] book it's a publisher book that's that's
[121.36 - 124.76] the whole thing people know how it works
[123.36 - 126.84] with books when when you have a
[124.76 - 128.28] publisher and they go out and the
[126.84 - 131.00] printing and everything else and all the
[128.28 - 132.72] work involved and you know it's not the
[131.00 - 134.28] same thing as if you publish yourself or
[132.72 - 135.80] you have your own ebook and you make all
[134.28 - 137.88] the money and all the stuff that people
[135.80 - 139.28] do so there's there's really it's
[137.88 - 141.04] important to understand when you're and
[139.28 - 142.72] the reason why I'm saying all this is
[141.04 - 143.92] because when you're dealing with fasting
[142.72 - 145.56] and you're dealing with different belief
[143.92 - 147.48] systems and Trends and different stuff
[145.56 - 149.32] like that misinformation there's a lot
[147.48 - 151.04] of stuff behind them they don't know
[149.32 - 152.16] that's happen that you get tricked into
[151.04 - 153.96] and you're not going to get that here
[152.16 - 156.12] you're going to get literally you're
[153.96 - 158.12] going to get you know the truth the
[156.12 - 160.36] information that's not swallowed
[158.12 - 162.28] swallowed up by some investor or some
[160.36 - 165.04] belief system or somebody invested into
[162.28 - 166.96] like you know $500,000 in supplements
[165.04 - 168.72] and put all these kits together so they
[166.96 - 170.24] can tell you how to dry fast and then
[168.72 - 171.64] make sure you take these herbs and make
[170.24 - 173.28] sure you take this and make sure you
[171.64 - 175.36] take that and then they try to train you
[173.28 - 177.00] to also be one of these people so then
[175.36 - 178.36] you go it's like a pyramid scheme and
[177.00 - 180.56] you go and try to get other people on
[178.36 - 182.40] board and whatever nothing like that
[180.56 - 183.76] nothing like that is happening and on
[182.40 - 185.80] the beginning of the show you'll notice
[183.76 - 188.04] there isn't a 15minute infomercial on
[185.80 - 189.76] selling kind of some kind of diet system
[188.04 - 191.12] or selling kind of some belief system or
[189.76 - 192.76] some whatever you're not going to hear
[191.12 - 195.28] that either and I have to just make that
[192.76 - 196.56] clear for anybody who first came on here
[195.28 - 198.88] who's never heard the medical medium
[196.56 - 200.64] radio show it's all about you and that's
[198.88 - 203.04] what it's really about and that's what
[200.64 - 204.64] it's really really really about it's
[203.04 - 205.96] about your healing process about your
[204.64 - 207.24] family it's about your loved ones it's
[205.96 - 210.68] about the people you care about it's
[207.24 - 214.00] about all of that and you just you know
[210.68 - 217.32] what happens is we get so brainwashed by
[214.00 - 221.16] all all the propaganda and all the sales
[217.32 - 224.28] and all the systematic selling of things
[221.16 - 226.12] and products and belief systems and diet
[224.28 - 228.52] systems and all this other stuff that we
[226.12 - 230.44] just get numb to it and then we think
[228.52 - 231.80] everybody does that that's that's a
[230.44 - 233.12] public figure or somebody who's out
[231.80 - 235.04] there whatever it is we think everybody
[233.12 - 237.68] does that it's not true we don't do that
[235.04 - 239.72] here I don't do that and that has to be
[237.68 - 241.36] clear so when it comes down to fact
[239.72 - 243.36] fasting and water fasting and dry
[241.36 - 246.04] fasting and intermittent fasting or any
[243.36 - 248.20] kind of fasting whatever it is you just
[246.04 - 251.92] know it's free what we're talking about
[248.20 - 254.24] is free from some you know Bowl that's
[251.92 - 255.84] behind it from some some agenda that's
[254.24 - 258.20] behind it so you always have to know
[255.84 - 259.92] that and that's important that's really
[258.20 - 261.52] important to understand so look let's
[259.92 - 263.28] get into the show let's do this I think
[261.52 - 266.08] I've you know held you guys out enough
[263.28 - 268.40] with that right now and I just I just
[266.08 - 270.72] you know it's just it's important stuff
[268.40 - 273.32] believe me is important you need to know
[270.72 - 276.16] that the information you get is free
[273.32 - 278.16] from you know something that shouldn't
[276.16 - 279.92] be involved in it it's just it's just
[278.16 - 281.64] it's really it would matter to me it
[279.92 - 284.48] would matter to me so if I was looking
[281.64 - 286.80] for help it would matter to me so I so I
[284.48 - 288.96] I Pro so I'm just thinking I'm assuming
[286.80 - 292.12] that would matter to everybody else too
[288.96 - 293.76] um so so here's the bottom line here's
[292.12 - 296.40] the bottom line there's all these
[293.76 - 297.84] different fasts out there and and all
[296.40 - 299.28] these different programs and all these
[297.84 - 301.28] different kits and all this different
[299.28 - 304.24] stuff
[301.28 - 305.92] and there's really no there's nothing
[304.24 - 307.56] behind this as far as you know when you
[305.92 - 308.92] think about the different there's
[307.56 - 312.04] there's not there's there's people's
[308.92 - 314.12] theories there's uh theories there's you
[312.04 - 315.56] know belief systems there's things that
[314.12 - 316.80] people tried on themsel and it might
[315.56 - 318.12] have worked for them but it didn't work
[316.80 - 320.88] for somebody else there's a lot of
[318.12 - 323.80] things mixed up and matched into it and
[320.88 - 327.16] you got to be careful um you know with
[323.80 - 329.92] Liver Rescue with Liver Rescue uh my
[327.16 - 332.80] latest book Liver Rescue I talk about
[329.92 - 334.48] how the liver doesn't like to be pushed
[332.80 - 336.48] it doesn't like to be pushed it's like a
[334.48 - 338.80] child about to jump into the swimming
[336.48 - 342.00] pool off the diving board for the first
[338.80 - 345.12] time ever and is standing um at the end
[342.00 - 347.64] of the diving board okay standing there
[345.12 - 349.36] and getting the courage and getting the
[347.64 - 352.00] the faith and the courage and getting
[349.36 - 354.52] that willpower and building that Spirit
[352.00 - 357.64] to want to make that plunge on her or
[354.52 - 360.28] his own and jump into the water you know
[357.64 - 363.08] and and that child if you got on the
[360.28 - 364.76] diving board and you pushed the child in
[363.08 - 366.44] without the child realizing or knowing
[364.76 - 369.28] it and the child was thrown into the
[366.44 - 371.04] water and got a gulp of water and was
[369.28 - 373.92] choking and gasping on the water on the
[371.04 - 376.24] side of the pool and all trust would be
[373.92 - 379.56] broken all trust would be broken it
[376.24 - 381.48] would be it would be a pushed event or a
[379.56 - 383.08] forced event when it shouldn't be it
[381.48 - 386.36] should be something that naturally
[383.08 - 388.24] occurs with the child's own you know
[386.36 - 390.04] being and Consciousness and everything
[388.24 - 392.04] else to jump off that diving board for
[390.04 - 394.84] the first time into a swimming pool you
[392.04 - 397.24] know and I remember I remember being a
[394.84 - 398.76] child and I was I was you know I was at
[397.24 - 400.60] a a friend's house and there was
[398.76 - 403.16] everybody was swimming there and I was I
[400.60 - 405.20] was um 8 years old and I remember that's
[403.16 - 406.96] what happened and I saw that I saw a
[405.20 - 410.44] child that was on the diving board for
[406.96 - 413.24] the first time ever a little girl and
[410.44 - 416.24] she was she was on the diving board and
[413.24 - 418.40] an adult was behind her and then pushed
[416.24 - 420.56] her in just pushed her in thought that
[418.40 - 423.36] that would be the best way to do it and
[420.56 - 426.48] I'll never forget it because I I was I I
[423.36 - 429.20] saw it was wrong totally wrong and I
[426.48 - 431.20] knew why it was wrong in every way and
[429.20 - 432.68] um and spirit did knew why it was wrong
[431.20 - 435.16] in every way and I'll never forget that
[432.68 - 437.00] and I I and I and I talked about that in
[435.16 - 440.16] Li rescue because what happens is when
[437.00 - 443.36] you cleanse and you fast you may be
[440.16 - 446.48] pushing a part of your body that doesn't
[443.36 - 448.24] want to be pushed and that is really
[446.48 - 450.36] what happens and we have to be careful
[448.24 - 452.56] so when we're we're doing different
[450.36 - 454.24] fasts and we just we're trying different
[452.56 - 457.20] things and we're going jumping into
[454.24 - 461.16] things we don't know what our organs are
[457.20 - 463.52] feeling we have no idea and have no clue
[461.16 - 465.08] you know which organ is that little girl
[463.52 - 467.56] on the end of the diving board that gets
[465.08 - 469.64] thrown into the water instead of having
[467.56 - 471.64] to do the process properly or the right
[469.64 - 473.72] process of jumping in and building up
[471.64 - 475.24] you know building up that faith and
[473.72 - 477.88] everything else and you know would
[475.24 - 479.56] happen in that trust and what happens is
[477.88 - 482.80] there's an organ in our body called the
[479.56 - 486.40] liver and that liver of ours and yours
[482.80 - 489.68] doesn't like stupid fasting meaning
[486.40 - 493.12] stupidly done fasting it doesn't like it
[489.68 - 496.04] at all and a and it's really important
[493.12 - 497.72] to know this because no one knows what's
[496.04 - 499.12] happening inside the body out there it's
[497.72 - 500.56] amazing what happens I mean it's just
[499.12 - 502.56] got tons of practitioners out there and
[500.56 - 505.52] doctors and all these different people
[502.56 - 507.56] and and what not and no one really knows
[505.52 - 510.24] what's happening inside the body it's
[507.56 - 513.80] all hit or miss out there it really is
[510.24 - 515.60] and that's that's what's scary so so but
[513.80 - 518.60] this organ that we have which is the
[515.60 - 520.68] liver it it doesn't like to be what it
[518.60 - 522.32] does is it holds on to poisons for a
[520.68 - 524.80] reason it holds on to toxins for a
[522.32 - 527.92] reason and if it's pushed too hard it's
[524.80 - 530.84] going to release all of them not all of
[527.92 - 532.76] them a large amount of them into the
[530.84 - 536.04] bloodstream and it's not going to leave
[532.76 - 538.04] your body it's not it's only some are
[536.04 - 540.04] going to leave the body the rest are
[538.04 - 540.96] going to float around cause causing harm
[540.04 - 542.60] and they're going to float around
[540.96 - 544.16] causing harm to the brain they're going
[542.60 - 546.04] to float around causing harm to the
[544.16 - 547.56] pancreas and they're going to float
[546.04 - 548.88] around causing harm to the spleen
[547.56 - 550.88] they're going to float around causing
[548.88 - 553.36] harm to other parts of the body to the
[550.88 - 554.84] nervous system especially and they're
[553.36 - 557.36] even going to float around causing harm
[554.84 - 560.00] to the adrenals so when it's about
[557.36 - 561.96] cleansing no one's thinking about
[560.00 - 563.56] something inside of them no one's
[561.96 - 565.20] thinking about that whatever kind of
[563.56 - 566.88] cleansing it is meaning whatever kind of
[565.20 - 569.84] cleansing whatever kind of fast whatever
[566.88 - 572.36] kind of whatever it is no one's thinking
[569.84 - 574.20] about wait a minute you know what is my
[572.36 - 575.76] liver really going to do and how does my
[574.20 - 578.88] liver really work and what's really
[575.76 - 581.32] happening here and this is why we have
[578.88 - 582.72] so many mistakes in the industry and and
[581.32 - 584.36] and people get sucked into so many
[582.72 - 586.16] things and yeah some things work some
[584.36 - 588.20] things don't but
[586.16 - 590.16] regardless everybody's different
[588.20 - 591.56] something might work for someone someone
[590.16 - 592.76] someone might something might not work
[591.56 - 593.92] for another person I'm going to I'm
[592.76 - 595.68] going to talk about that I'm going to
[593.92 - 598.60] discuss all that and talk about that as
[595.68 - 601.96] we're going through the show um so what
[598.60 - 604.00] happens is our liver likes to release a
[601.96 - 607.92] certain amount of poison that it doesn't
[604.00 - 610.32] have to soop back up so what happens is
[607.92 - 613.08] if we push it and we just jump into some
[610.32 - 615.40] fast or we do something like a dry fast
[613.08 - 617.12] or we do something whatever Poison's
[615.40 - 619.16] been inside our liver it you know
[617.12 - 620.60] everything all the different chemicals
[619.16 - 622.64] all the different toxins all the
[620.60 - 625.48] different heavy metals all the different
[622.64 - 627.40] solvents Pharmaceuticals all throughout
[625.48 - 629.92] life from starting from the beginning
[627.40 - 632.40] everything that's in there and then some
[629.92 - 634.72] pesticides DDT herbicides that believe
[632.40 - 637.48] it it the liver has it all in there
[634.72 - 639.40] Plastics petroleum tons of petroleum
[637.48 - 642.72] based stuff I mean it's amazing what's
[639.40 - 644.56] inside the liver and so if we the liver
[642.72 - 646.72] just likes to release a little bit of
[644.56 - 650.28] this at a time and a little bit of this
[646.72 - 652.00] at a time and that's why you know spirit
[650.28 - 653.68] and you know gave me the 28 day cleanse
[652.00 - 656.16] so it releases a little bit at of the
[653.68 - 658.44] time a little bit at a time because what
[656.16 - 659.64] happens is if you jump into some crazy
[658.44 - 660.76] fast
[659.64 - 662.36] yeah I know some of you are probably
[660.76 - 664.12] like upset because you you're in totally
[662.36 - 666.40] into fasting and you still can fast but
[664.12 - 667.96] I'm going to talk about why we have to
[666.40 - 669.92] be careful in different levels and and
[667.96 - 672.56] different things for different people if
[669.92 - 675.92] you're toxic if you're ready already
[672.56 - 678.48] really really toxic fasting is not what
[675.92 - 681.96] you want to do meaning water fasting
[678.48 - 684.56] straight water fasting um dry fasting um
[681.96 - 687.04] you know you've got to be really careful
[684.56 - 689.44] because what happens is if you have a
[687.04 - 692.52] really toxic liver and it's f and it's
[689.44 - 695.32] sluggish and it's loaded with poison and
[692.52 - 697.92] you push that liver off the diving
[695.32 - 699.60] board okay when you push it off the
[697.92 - 702.00] diving board into the
[699.60 - 703.72] pole there's going to be a problem
[702.00 - 705.96] there's going to be a major problem it's
[703.72 - 707.36] going to release too much poison even
[705.96 - 709.44] though it's not going to release all of
[707.36 - 710.88] it there's no way because it's it's it
[709.44 - 712.88] because when livers are toxic they're
[710.88 - 714.96] loaded and it takes takes takes a lot
[712.88 - 716.32] while to get your livers cleaned up I'm
[714.96 - 718.36] going to tell you right now and I talk
[716.32 - 720.00] all about that in Liver Rescue but what
[718.36 - 722.48] happens is
[720.00 - 725.08] that the liver will release more poison
[722.48 - 729.16] than it wants to release and then that
[725.08 - 730.84] poison won't leave the body only a
[729.16 - 733.52] little bit will hit the kidneys and
[730.84 - 736.84] leave the body the rest of it will wreak
[733.52 - 739.12] havoc what I mean wreak havoc it will
[736.84 - 741.08] get into the brain it will get into the
[739.12 - 744.80] nervous system and it will get into the
[741.08 - 747.80] pancreas it'll get into places and and
[744.80 - 750.84] on top of that the liver has to sop it
[747.80 - 754.12] all back up it has to work 10 times
[750.84 - 756.88] harder to stop all that toxic poison
[754.12 - 759.40] poisonous debris back up cuz the liver
[756.88 - 762.88] has to suck it all back up and that's
[759.40 - 765.92] that's you know that's how it works so
[762.88 - 767.64] we have to be we have to be responsible
[765.92 - 770.36] which I just don't see that out there
[767.64 - 773.20] with all the different Frills and chills
[770.36 - 775.16] packages all the different fasting stuff
[773.20 - 777.56] all the different whatever it's
[775.16 - 781.28] literally it's literally like I mean
[777.56 - 784.80] it's unbelievable on how not
[781.28 - 787.80] responsible it is out there so so the
[784.80 - 789.96] bottom line is it's all about protecting
[787.80 - 791.32] something when you're fasting and I'm
[789.96 - 792.72] going to tell you how to do it I'm going
[791.32 - 793.92] to tell you what you should do you know
[792.72 - 794.88] depending and everybody's a little
[793.92 - 796.52] different so I'm going to try to give
[794.88 - 799.60] you as much information on the
[796.52 - 801.44] differences you may have yourself that
[799.60 - 803.16] can you know that can be the difference
[801.44 - 804.80] there now to begin with if you're really
[803.16 - 806.92] toxic you've been eating standard
[804.80 - 808.92] American for the most part you haven't
[806.92 - 810.32] really done any fruits and vegetables
[808.92 - 812.44] you've been eating a lot of animal
[810.32 - 814.00] products or you even been eating a lot
[812.44 - 815.16] of animal products and still eating
[814.00 - 816.60] fruits and vegetables and you're not
[815.16 - 818.20] eating that you know bad and you're
[816.60 - 820.84] eating pretty clean you still could be
[818.20 - 822.64] highly toxic toxic for years and years
[820.84 - 824.92] and years the liver could be totally
[822.64 - 826.28] filled with tons of poison because
[824.92 - 827.84] that's what that's the organ that gets
[826.28 - 829.36] filled with that much poison and then
[827.84 - 831.80] someone convinces you to go on some
[829.36 - 834.88] fasting program
[831.80 - 837.32] wrong wrong to do wrong to do what
[834.88 - 839.68] you'll do is you'll just you'll hurt the
[837.32 - 841.52] adrenals you'll you'll you'll saturate
[839.68 - 844.32] the brain with poison which the brain
[841.52 - 846.32] does not need you'll weaken the pancreas
[844.32 - 848.36] and you'll over tax and over stress and
[846.32 - 849.92] overwork the liver and make it harder
[848.36 - 852.76] for the liver to heal later so what
[849.92 - 854.76] happens is we have to do things a little
[852.76 - 856.32] differently you know like the 28 day
[854.76 - 859.00] cleanse in the first book medical media
[856.32 - 861.04] I mean 28 day cleanse is because that
[859.00 - 863.24] that is to make sure that anybody who is
[861.04 - 865.44] already healthier gets even healthier
[863.24 - 867.80] and cleaner so that if they did do a
[865.44 - 870.00] fast or a two-day water fast or a 7-Day
[867.80 - 872.56] water fast or they did something it
[870.00 - 875.52] wouldn't be a disaster and it wouldn't
[872.56 - 877.16] be it wouldn't be hard on the liver it
[875.52 - 879.04] wouldn't be super hard on the liver and
[877.16 - 881.52] so that's something to really understand
[879.04 - 883.48] and so what happens though if you're if
[881.52 - 885.08] you're toxic and you're coming into
[883.48 - 886.44] you're coming into something say you're
[885.08 - 887.72] just you've been eating the way you're
[886.44 - 889.44] eating and that's how you've been eating
[887.72 - 891.28] all these years it's not that good you
[889.44 - 893.36] got or you're or you've been eating
[891.28 - 895.72] pretty good but your liver's loaded and
[893.36 - 898.52] nobody knows nobody knows and your liver
[895.72 - 900.76] loaded with poison loaded with toxins
[898.52 - 901.76] and and and then you go and you jump
[900.76 - 903.96] into a
[901.76 - 906.20] fast and and that's not what you do
[903.96 - 908.00] that's not what you should do and in the
[906.20 - 910.84] end you know we get hurt because of that
[908.00 - 912.28] later on in different ways it's in and
[910.84 - 914.80] so I mean that's that's kind of an
[912.28 - 917.72] example right there there's something
[914.80 - 919.88] about gradually eating better and better
[917.72 - 922.76] and better gradually eating better and
[919.88 - 925.84] better and better so you know so you
[922.76 - 929.12] don't end up so there's this you adapt
[925.84 - 931.24] so your liver can actually adapt so so
[929.12 - 933.24] and that's the key that's one of the big
[931.24 - 934.80] keys let say you're somebody who's been
[933.24 - 936.52] doing everything you've been doing all
[934.80 - 938.24] these different foods but have you been
[936.52 - 940.60] doing everything have you been doing
[938.24 - 942.68] celery juice for 5 years have you been
[940.60 - 945.44] doing celery juice for three years have
[942.68 - 947.16] you I mean think about it totally
[945.44 - 949.40] cleansing recovering your pancreas
[947.16 - 951.52] totally cleansing recovering your your
[949.40 - 953.88] your spleen totally cleansing recovering
[951.52 - 955.36] your uh liver your nervous system you
[953.88 - 958.72] know what's funny is there's people out
[955.36 - 960.84] there there's so many people now that
[958.72 - 963.24] have um that have the the medical medium
[960.84 - 966.16] books go around the world right you're
[963.24 - 968.72] probably bumping into them and stuff and
[966.16 - 970.08] and you know and at the same time is
[968.72 - 971.88] people hop on board on the internet
[970.08 - 973.08] they'll hop on Instagram they'll hop on
[971.88 - 975.64] Facebook or they'll hop on different
[973.08 - 977.48] forums and oh yeah no I tried that it
[975.64 - 980.00] wasn't really helping but when you look
[977.48 - 982.08] at it I mean you look at it they didn't
[980.00 - 983.76] even do the celery juice for two weeks
[982.08 - 985.84] what did they try you know what happens
[983.76 - 989.20] every day I see it out there and you
[985.84 - 991.60] know did someone do 32 oz of celery
[989.20 - 994.64] juice for the liver for their body for
[991.60 - 996.68] their health and you know or even 16
[994.64 - 999.88] ounces of celery juice every single
[996.68 - 1002.00] morning for a year did they and remove
[999.88 - 1003.76] the no Foods remove the eggs the dairy
[1002.00 - 1006.80] the wheat and you know other things like
[1003.76 - 1009.16] that did they do that and you know like
[1006.80 - 1011.36] so that's the whole point is there's
[1009.16 - 1013.20] different way there's different levels
[1011.36 - 1015.44] of getting to a point where if you want
[1013.20 - 1017.44] to do a fast were you doing at least the
[1015.44 - 1019.16] other things to get yourself ready for
[1017.44 - 1021.88] one so what I'm saying is is if you if
[1019.16 - 1024.84] you get tied into some fast out there
[1021.88 - 1026.44] tied into some cleanse tied into
[1024.84 - 1027.96] something and it's selling you a bag of
[1026.44 - 1029.60] goods and it's making you buy like
[1027.96 - 1031.20] thousands of dollars of stuff and then
[1029.60 - 1033.16] telling you you can sell thousands of
[1031.20 - 1034.80] dollars of stuff whatever it's doing you
[1033.16 - 1037.36] know some do that some don't some just
[1034.80 - 1039.36] make you buy stuff some whatever whether
[1037.36 - 1041.32] it's by you know uh crazy people that
[1039.36 - 1042.76] created the cleanse some mad man that
[1041.32 - 1044.52] created the cleanse whatever it is
[1042.76 - 1047.20] that's out there whatever you're doing
[1044.52 - 1049.08] out there make sure you get yourself
[1047.20 - 1050.80] ready for it because if it's not a good
[1049.08 - 1052.96] cleanse and if it's not a good fast if
[1050.80 - 1054.48] it's not a good situation you got your
[1052.96 - 1056.84] body in a place that could possibly
[1054.48 - 1058.24] adapt to it and protect you and the
[1056.84 - 1060.20] whole thing about the medical medium
[1058.24 - 1062.16] information and what what uh spirit and
[1060.20 - 1064.44] I been doing is making sure you have all
[1062.16 - 1066.00] the foundation to protect you to heal no
[1064.44 - 1067.88] matter what you do so even if you make
[1066.00 - 1069.76] mistakes even if you fall into a belief
[1067.88 - 1071.52] system even if you fall into something
[1069.76 - 1075.08] even if you whatever you'll be better
[1071.52 - 1076.92] off and still safer because because it's
[1075.08 - 1078.72] it's all about protecting things inside
[1076.92 - 1080.20] the body that nobody understands and I'm
[1078.72 - 1082.28] just saying this because it's got look I
[1080.20 - 1083.84] got to tell I got to say the truth
[1082.28 - 1085.32] that's all I have that's all I have to
[1083.84 - 1087.88] do you know Spirit told me so was a
[1085.32 - 1090.16] little little boy just tell the truth
[1087.88 - 1092.20] just tell the truth and the truth is
[1090.16 - 1094.16] this information and say it and don't be
[1092.20 - 1096.64] afraid to say it so I promise Spirit
[1094.16 - 1098.04] since the day day day I got the the gift
[1096.64 - 1099.68] and spirit was talking to me that I'm
[1098.04 - 1102.20] always going to say it like it is and
[1099.68 - 1104.36] not be afraid of hurting someone's
[1102.20 - 1105.72] feelings and that was the key I remember
[1104.36 - 1107.12] when I was a little boy I'd be like well
[1105.72 - 1108.68] I'm going to hurt somebody's feelings if
[1107.12 - 1110.16] I if I tell them what you're telling I'm
[1108.68 - 1111.84] going to hurt their feelings because
[1110.16 - 1114.04] they believe in something else spirit
[1111.84 - 1116.36] said doesn't matter you have to tell
[1114.04 - 1118.92] them what it is they have to hear the
[1116.36 - 1120.80] truth and so and so with the fasting
[1118.92 - 1122.24] thing you know it's important to know
[1120.80 - 1123.88] that if you're yeah if you're really
[1122.24 - 1126.08] highly toxic if your liver is really
[1123.88 - 1127.20] overburden which most likely probably
[1126.08 - 1128.76] especially if you've been sick for a
[1127.20 - 1130.68] long time and you got viral issues and
[1128.76 - 1132.36] everything inside the liver you want to
[1130.68 - 1133.88] you want to do something like a 28 day
[1132.36 - 1136.40] cleanser you want to do the cleanse and
[1133.88 - 1137.84] Liver Rescue you want to do the cleanse
[1136.40 - 1140.24] and Liver Rescue so you'll see the
[1137.84 - 1142.28] cleanse and Liver Rescue it's it it
[1140.24 - 1144.80] literally is above the rest because it's
[1142.28 - 1147.28] it's about making sure your liver gets
[1144.80 - 1148.88] cleaned up to the end like cleaned clean
[1147.28 - 1150.16] cleaned up without hurting your liver
[1148.88 - 1152.28] hurting your bloodstream and everything
[1150.16 - 1155.36] else okay so let's go into some some
[1152.28 - 1158.08] water fasting talk okay have I water
[1155.36 - 1162.12] fasted have I water fasted yes I have
[1158.08 - 1165.12] have I water fasted a long time yes I
[1162.12 - 1168.36] have I've water fasted an extremely long
[1165.12 - 1170.80] time one that probably is way too
[1168.36 - 1173.16] dangerous for so many people you know
[1170.80 - 1175.84] you know I I when I water fasted for a
[1173.16 - 1178.44] long I did a lot of water fast in my day
[1175.84 - 1181.08] and I did water fast for Spiritual
[1178.44 - 1182.80] reasons okay and you know with with
[1181.08 - 1184.64] struggling with spirit and struggling
[1182.80 - 1186.72] with with with having what what I called
[1184.64 - 1189.20] the curse all these years which was the
[1186.72 - 1192.60] gift of hearing spirit so I you know I
[1189.20 - 1195.04] did spiritual fasts with um with water
[1192.60 - 1197.84] fasting you know throughout my life
[1195.04 - 1201.24] starting at age 12 I you know my first
[1197.84 - 1204.20] water fast was at age 12 I water fasted
[1201.24 - 1207.08] for 7 days straight with just water at
[1204.20 - 1209.64] age 12 I'm not recommending that I'm not
[1207.08 - 1213.80] and no 12-year-old should be doing that
[1209.64 - 1217.04] okay I did it I was lucky I had Spirit
[1213.80 - 1219.76] okay so I had spirit to guide me and I
[1217.04 - 1221.40] had Spirit to also tell me I I shouldn't
[1219.76 - 1223.48] have been doing it either but I did it
[1221.40 - 1226.52] anyway but I had Spirit guiding me and
[1223.48 - 1229.60] helping me through it I did a 7-Day fast
[1226.52 - 1232.60] at 12 years old okay okay at 18 years
[1229.60 - 1234.84] old I did a 21-day fast at 18 years old
[1232.60 - 1236.68] of straight water and I'm not even going
[1234.84 - 1238.28] to tell you how many days I've done even
[1236.68 - 1240.40] after that because I don't want to
[1238.28 - 1244.32] influence anyone thinking they could
[1240.40 - 1247.36] water fast too long okay but I have done
[1244.32 - 1249.96] longer than 21 days in water fasting and
[1247.36 - 1251.88] I mean a lot longer and it's stupid it
[1249.96 - 1255.56] was stupid and I was spiritually doing
[1251.88 - 1259.76] it for my own emotional spiritual
[1255.56 - 1261.64] reasons being a human being and uh and
[1259.76 - 1264.12] at the same time dealing with what I had
[1261.64 - 1266.84] to deal with growing up which was you
[1264.12 - 1270.16] know which was with spirit so it was
[1266.84 - 1272.32] pretty intense time for me now have I
[1270.16 - 1274.20] helped people water fast over the water
[1272.32 - 1275.52] fast over the years if people you know
[1274.20 - 1277.44] would come to me and they really truly
[1275.52 - 1278.92] wanted to and they wanted me to guide
[1277.44 - 1280.28] them I have helped people so they
[1278.92 - 1281.52] wouldn't make mistakes or it was the
[1280.28 - 1284.16] right thing for them or the right way
[1281.52 - 1286.92] for them you know I've seen all that is
[1284.16 - 1290.40] water fasting okay some water fasting is
[1286.92 - 1293.20] okay for people some sometimes it is but
[1290.40 - 1295.68] I like water fasting for people that
[1293.20 - 1298.36] have already gotten to a certain point
[1295.68 - 1300.24] you know so the liver isn't traumatized
[1298.36 - 1304.24] so they've already been eating good I've
[1300.24 - 1305.52] been eating good since I was 8 years old
[1304.24 - 1307.28] and that's how long I've been eating
[1305.52 - 1308.76] good even a little before that but
[1307.28 - 1312.32] around 8 years old so I've been eating
[1308.76 - 1315.08] clean since 8 years old and that eating
[1312.32 - 1317.16] clean since 8 years old has allowed me
[1315.08 - 1318.04] to keep my liver clean so I'm giving you
[1317.16 - 1319.56] a little bit of private information
[1318.04 - 1320.88] information about me because you know I
[1319.56 - 1322.84] always want to tell you guys everything
[1320.88 - 1324.16] about me but every time I talk about me
[1322.84 - 1327.32] then everybody starts yelling on the
[1324.16 - 1329.48] internet stop talking about yourself and
[1327.32 - 1331.68] talk about talk about you know us and
[1329.48 - 1334.36] our problems and our illnesses so I try
[1331.68 - 1335.56] not to excuse me I try not to talk about
[1334.36 - 1340.76] myself so
[1335.56 - 1342.32] much so so the whole thing is is that is
[1340.76 - 1343.68] that when you when you're getting to a
[1342.32 - 1344.84] point of being clean enough and you're
[1343.68 - 1346.24] cleaning out your liver and you're
[1344.84 - 1347.52] cleaning out your body and cleaning out
[1346.24 - 1349.40] your organs and your bloodstream and
[1347.52 - 1351.24] everything's coming out of you enough
[1349.40 - 1356.76] gradually over time cuz you've been
[1351.24 - 1359.32] eating good for a while what happens is
[1356.76 - 1360.96] you know you can do things like that for
[1359.32 - 1362.76] your health so if you were sick or you
[1360.96 - 1365.32] had a problem or something happened and
[1362.76 - 1366.80] you want to heal something quicker or a
[1365.32 - 1368.80] sickness comes over you and you want to
[1366.80 - 1370.48] heal something quicker you catch
[1368.80 - 1372.56] something you catch somebody's strap a
[1370.48 - 1374.96] caucus you catch somebody's you catch
[1372.56 - 1376.84] somebody's you know whatever or you just
[1374.96 - 1378.76] you know you get a bad flu or whatever
[1376.84 - 1381.16] happens in your life you know you want
[1378.76 - 1383.52] to be able to also be able to fast but
[1381.16 - 1385.60] you don't want to be Force forcing your
[1383.52 - 1387.80] liver and forcing yourself into such a
[1385.60 - 1389.28] such a difficult situation where your
[1387.80 - 1391.32] body's fil filling up with so many
[1389.28 - 1393.36] toxins and poisons that you get affected
[1391.32 - 1396.84] by it in negative ways and believe me it
[1393.36 - 1400.36] can so so if you're someone who wants to
[1396.84 - 1404.28] water fast I support it I don't support
[1400.36 - 1406.92] long water fasts I don't think they're
[1404.28 - 1409.32] necessary because a lot of people go
[1406.92 - 1412.32] into fasts water fasts being
[1409.32 - 1414.56] nutritionally deficient being completely
[1412.32 - 1416.20] deficient with deficient of zinc
[1414.56 - 1418.56] deficient of different minerals but yet
[1416.20 - 1421.08] they're sick and they have viruses so
[1418.56 - 1424.16] what happens is when you water fast too
[1421.08 - 1427.00] long your immune system starts to weaken
[1424.16 - 1430.16] and viruses like the shingles and the
[1427.00 - 1431.84] EBV and hhv sixs and the cytom magler
[1430.16 - 1433.60] viruses and all the herpetic viruses
[1431.84 - 1435.36] that create Lyme disease that create all
[1433.60 - 1436.68] these different illnesses that I talk
[1435.36 - 1438.68] about all the time in my books and
[1436.68 - 1441.36] everything else all these viruses have a
[1438.68 - 1444.92] way of being able to jump out and and
[1441.36 - 1447.20] come out I know fast fasting experts
[1444.92 - 1449.40] that don't even understand how viruses
[1447.20 - 1452.64] work and how how viruses affect and make
[1449.40 - 1454.52] people sick and they fast their people
[1452.64 - 1456.12] and and these people come out of fasts
[1454.52 - 1458.12] and some of them can can all of a sudden
[1456.12 - 1459.60] get really sick and they got a whole
[1458.12 - 1461.44] thing of shingles running down their
[1459.60 - 1462.84] side a whole thing of this going down
[1461.44 - 1464.20] after it it's like doesn't and they're
[1462.84 - 1466.48] always like oh it's cuz you're cleansing
[1464.20 - 1468.72] you're cleansing you're cleansing no cuz
[1466.48 - 1470.80] you went into a deficient you've been
[1468.72 - 1472.84] sick all this time you went into a
[1470.80 - 1474.32] deficient and you know you're you're
[1472.84 - 1476.80] mineral deficient your other kinds of
[1474.32 - 1478.08] deficiencies and then you fasted and it
[1476.80 - 1480.40] was just too hard in the system the
[1478.08 - 1483.88] immune system took a little bit of a hit
[1480.40 - 1489.08] and so you know so there's different so
[1483.88 - 1493.60] I support water fasting I do you know
[1489.08 - 1495.44] but it has to be it has to be not too
[1493.60 - 1496.68] long for certain people there's some
[1495.44 - 1499.04] people they could do it a little bit
[1496.68 - 1500.88] longer some people people shorter you
[1499.04 - 1503.64] know what I like for water fasting is
[1500.88 - 1505.92] like a two-day water fast the most I
[1503.64 - 1509.60] like two-day water fasts if someone
[1505.92 - 1512.44] really wants to do one 2day is actually
[1509.60 - 1514.12] perfect it doesn't freak out the liver
[1512.44 - 1515.68] to such a degree where the LI is
[1514.12 - 1517.20] actually dumping everything at once and
[1515.68 - 1519.08] then having to pay the price by sucking
[1517.20 - 1520.76] it all back up and then weakening itself
[1519.08 - 1523.36] and getting sluggish afterwards because
[1520.76 - 1524.84] that's what happens some people who fast
[1523.36 - 1526.28] and they fast for a while regardless of
[1524.84 - 1528.16] what kind of fast they shock the liver
[1526.28 - 1530.80] so much that they gain weight after
[1528.16 - 1532.56] they're fast later on regardless of what
[1530.80 - 1534.48] diet they're on and everything like that
[1532.56 - 1536.72] they gain all their weight like all this
[1534.48 - 1539.08] weight because they liver totally took a
[1536.72 - 1541.28] hit from the F fast so you don't want it
[1539.08 - 1543.52] so two days I like it's a more
[1541.28 - 1545.36] protective to the liver depending on who
[1543.52 - 1547.52] you are it's more protective it's more
[1545.36 - 1549.16] safer it's more better so it would be a
[1547.52 - 1551.28] two-day water fast and you have to be
[1549.16 - 1553.68] drinking water you have to be drinking
[1551.28 - 1555.52] water so you know so I like those
[1553.68 - 1557.00] because you can do a two-day water fast
[1555.52 - 1558.92] and I don't want you doing a two-day
[1557.00 - 1560.60] water fast while driving around dropping
[1558.92 - 1564.04] the kids everywhere dropping the kids
[1560.60 - 1567.84] off everywhere um going here going there
[1564.04 - 1570.48] you should never in in in my opinion and
[1567.84 - 1572.56] in in my experience when you water fast
[1570.48 - 1573.96] you might get a dizzy spell some toxins
[1572.56 - 1575.76] might come out your blood sugar is going
[1573.96 - 1577.52] to drop you're going to you might get
[1575.76 - 1579.16] weak you might get all these different
[1577.52 - 1580.80] things now I know there's supersonic
[1579.16 - 1582.60] people out there that can water fast for
[1580.80 - 1583.64] 3 days and they're like oh my God I feel
[1582.60 - 1585.40] great and they're driving around in
[1583.64 - 1588.80] their car they're driving around in the
[1585.40 - 1589.96] car but still anything could happen so
[1588.80 - 1591.84] it's the kind of thing where you do your
[1589.96 - 1595.20] two-day water fast on the weekend you do
[1591.84 - 1596.52] it at home and you know you you can you
[1595.20 - 1598.44] know do what you need to do while you're
[1596.52 - 1600.52] doing it some you know and that's okay
[1598.44 - 1602.16] now here's the deal when you're dealing
[1600.52 - 1603.88] with neurological problems people that
[1602.16 - 1606.80] have neurological illnesses and they
[1603.88 - 1609.64] they're really weak nervous systems and
[1606.80 - 1611.04] because of EBV and neurotoxins floating
[1609.64 - 1613.24] around in the bloodstream things that
[1611.04 - 1614.80] fasting experts don't even know about
[1613.24 - 1617.76] they don't even have an idea about all
[1614.80 - 1619.56] that kind of stuff and so so what
[1617.76 - 1621.92] happens is once you have all that and
[1619.56 - 1623.88] you do a fast it could be really hard on
[1621.92 - 1625.44] somebody's central nervous system could
[1623.88 - 1626.92] shut down their central nervous system
[1625.44 - 1629.20] weaken it so that when they come out of
[1626.92 - 1631.64] the water fast they're they have to work
[1629.20 - 1634.32] 20 times harder that's why I don't like
[1631.64 - 1636.16] long water fasts because so many PE
[1634.32 - 1637.96] people have neurological issues they
[1636.16 - 1638.80] have anxiety they have depression they
[1637.96 - 1641.16] have headaches these are all
[1638.80 - 1643.12] neurological they have fibromyalgia
[1641.16 - 1644.76] aches and pains they have fatigue it's
[1643.12 - 1646.60] all neurological they have all these
[1644.76 - 1648.84] different things going on so when you go
[1646.60 - 1651.04] into a long water fast you get screwed
[1648.84 - 1653.40] totally screwed you end up being that
[1651.04 - 1654.92] one person that can't come out of it so
[1653.40 - 1656.56] you're at a water fasting place and
[1654.92 - 1658.72] you're just and you can't come out of
[1656.56 - 1660.28] your water fast everybody else is
[1658.72 - 1661.68] they're recovering and they're drinking
[1660.28 - 1663.00] and they're eating and they're they're
[1661.68 - 1664.96] recovering they're eating a little bit
[1663.00 - 1666.48] of food every two hours you out of the
[1664.96 - 1668.68] fast or eating a little bit of food but
[1666.48 - 1670.44] you're but you're like you're dogging it
[1668.68 - 1672.32] or a couple of people are dogging it and
[1670.44 - 1673.80] they're not really recovering and it's
[1672.32 - 1675.48] taking them literally two weeks to
[1673.80 - 1678.12] recover because of neuro fatigue because
[1675.48 - 1680.08] of neurological symptoms neurological
[1678.12 - 1681.40] issu giving you every Edge I can
[1680.08 - 1682.84] possibly give you with this so if you're
[1681.40 - 1685.56] going to have a water fast I mean I
[1682.84 - 1687.04] would do two-day water fasts the most
[1685.56 - 1689.72] and in fact if you're ever going to
[1687.04 - 1691.56] water Fest from here wait until you have
[1689.72 - 1693.72] a copy of Liver Rescue in your hands go
[1691.56 - 1695.80] get a copy of Liver Rescue and have it
[1693.72 - 1697.16] in your hands and just make sure you
[1695.80 - 1698.60] read all that about the liver and
[1697.16 - 1701.56] cleansing liver and cleaning it up
[1698.60 - 1704.04] because I have a cleanse in there that's
[1701.56 - 1706.36] protects your liver and can really get
[1704.04 - 1709.48] you healthy so without you having to tax
[1706.36 - 1711.00] your body or jump into another thing
[1709.48 - 1712.76] with the water fasting is once you go
[1711.00 - 1714.24] two or three days and you're and you're
[1712.76 - 1715.96] working with somebody on it or doing
[1714.24 - 1717.48] your own you tend to put a lot of people
[1715.96 - 1718.84] tend to go their fourth day fifth day
[1717.48 - 1721.44] and they don't stop and it becomes an
[1718.84 - 1723.44] addiction it becomes an addiction it
[1721.44 - 1725.20] really does and it's hard to break that
[1723.44 - 1726.80] addiction where you don't even want to
[1725.20 - 1728.28] break it you're just in it and you just
[1726.80 - 1730.84] want to keep going and then like a
[1728.28 - 1732.48] Madness occurs and a Madness occurs when
[1730.84 - 1734.96] you're water fasting too just so you
[1732.48 - 1736.84] know when you're like in your five six
[1734.96 - 1739.00] seven eight days you got moments of oh
[1736.84 - 1740.60] my God I'm having Clarity it's euphoric
[1739.00 - 1742.76] and then you're like but there's Madness
[1740.60 - 1744.16] that occurs throughout the whole process
[1742.76 - 1746.52] and that Madness could be like I don't
[1744.16 - 1748.68] want to break my fast I'm on my 14th day
[1746.52 - 1751.80] I don't want to break my water fast it's
[1748.68 - 1753.72] like it it just it yeah what I'm saying
[1751.80 - 1755.32] is you have to be careful I I would say
[1753.72 - 1759.04] if you're doing water fast you do
[1755.32 - 1760.72] two-day water fasts and and you can do
[1759.04 - 1762.80] you can do them periodically you can do
[1760.72 - 1764.28] it once a month two-day waterfest if you
[1762.80 - 1766.12] really want to do it and that's somebody
[1764.28 - 1767.60] without neuro fatigue that's somebody
[1766.12 - 1769.80] without neurological fatigue that's
[1767.60 - 1771.76] somebody without lots of viral issues
[1769.80 - 1773.12] and neurotoxins and Dermot toxins and
[1771.76 - 1774.40] everything else that I would say do a
[1773.12 - 1777.00] two-day water fast that's somebody
[1774.40 - 1779.40] without all of that and so let's talk
[1777.00 - 1781.72] about dry fasting you do you want to
[1779.40 - 1784.80] know about dry fasting it's called never
[1781.72 - 1787.64] do it ever ever ever ever I'm going to
[1784.80 - 1789.80] say this right now and I I can't help it
[1787.64 - 1792.52] but anybody who actually any
[1789.80 - 1795.68] professional any professional or any
[1792.52 - 1798.56] expert that believes in dry fasting is
[1795.68 - 1800.88] completely completely in the dark and
[1798.56 - 1802.64] had doesn't really understand the body
[1800.88 - 1804.36] and that scares the hell out of me I'm
[1802.64 - 1806.36] just going to tell you right now I don't
[1804.36 - 1808.16] care what war I'm starting and I don't
[1806.36 - 1809.48] care what issues I'm starting I don't
[1808.16 - 1811.92] care whatever I don't care whose
[1809.48 - 1813.16] feelings that hurt I'm telling you that
[1811.92 - 1814.80] and I I'll tell you why I'm telling you
[1813.16 - 1816.40] that because if it's to stop somebody
[1814.80 - 1818.36] from dry fasting so they don't hurt
[1816.40 - 1819.64] themselves and and anybody that's around
[1818.36 - 1821.60] them their loved ones and stuff like
[1819.64 - 1824.32] that then then darn right I'm going to
[1821.60 - 1825.44] say this because it matters okay I don't
[1824.32 - 1826.88] care about the pitchforks and the
[1825.44 - 1827.96] shovels and the Torches that might be at
[1826.88 - 1830.76] my door
[1827.96 - 1832.56] dry fasting is idiotic it's not the
[1830.76 - 1834.44] person who's doing it's idiotic it's the
[1832.56 - 1837.32] it's it's whatever experts who talk
[1834.44 - 1840.40] about it are being good or whatnot it's
[1837.32 - 1842.76] absolutely idiotic I have to say this I
[1840.40 - 1844.52] know it sounds really you know I sound
[1842.76 - 1848.64] obnoxious saying this like this but I'm
[1844.52 - 1851.60] just telling you and so dry fasting no
[1848.64 - 1853.76] off the table never never never it's a
[1851.60 - 1855.60] great way to traumatize the kidneys it's
[1853.76 - 1857.24] a great way to shut down the kidneys
[1855.60 - 1860.04] it's a great way to put your kidneys in
[1857.24 - 1862.68] in shock it's a great way to just
[1860.04 - 1865.72] literally like fill your bloodstream up
[1862.68 - 1867.84] with so much poison like so much poison
[1865.72 - 1871.32] you can go into like almost sepsis it's
[1867.84 - 1873.84] literally a an idiotic move for for
[1871.32 - 1875.96] experts to be into dry fasting at all if
[1873.84 - 1877.92] you're in a program and they have in
[1875.96 - 1879.20] that program some of it is dry fasting
[1877.92 - 1880.92] you should be out of that program I
[1879.20 - 1882.24] don't care what you paid for it I don't
[1880.92 - 1883.84] care what you paid for it or what it's
[1882.24 - 1886.32] selling you or what it's trying to teach
[1883.84 - 1888.52] you you should be doing I would get out
[1886.32 - 1890.12] of it and if you're getting upset
[1888.52 - 1892.40] because you're totally into it or you
[1890.12 - 1893.96] support somebody who you know supports
[1892.40 - 1895.20] somebody who believes in entirely and
[1893.96 - 1896.28] they sell it and everything else and
[1895.20 - 1897.48] they're selling it out there whatever
[1896.28 - 1899.52] and you you you bought into it and
[1897.48 - 1901.96] you're getting mad at me I'm sorry I'm
[1899.52 - 1904.64] really really sorry but it's for your
[1901.96 - 1907.68] own good it's for your own good I
[1904.64 - 1910.32] promise that I promise that am I selling
[1907.68 - 1913.80] anything no okay am I trying to make
[1910.32 - 1916.64] money off the show no all right so am I
[1913.80 - 1919.72] selling some kit no am I trying to help
[1916.64 - 1921.28] you yes yes I'm trying to help you so
[1919.72 - 1924.52] that that's what you have to understand
[1921.28 - 1927.48] um so with dry fasting off the table not
[1924.52 - 1929.32] even in option it's really destructive
[1927.48 - 1932.40] it hurts the kidneys it hurts the liver
[1929.32 - 1937.16] it hurts the nervous system it literally
[1932.40 - 1940.48] can cause serious brain problems kills
[1937.16 - 1942.20] brain cells we're at a place on planet
[1940.48 - 1945.72] Earth right now we can't lose brain
[1942.20 - 1947.60] cells we can't we're losing them rapidly
[1945.72 - 1949.72] as the human race right now
[1947.60 - 1952.80] in in where we are and where we stand on
[1949.72 - 1955.72] planet Earth brain cells go like never
[1952.80 - 1957.88] before and and and yeah and that's I
[1955.72 - 1960.24] mean it's unbelievable what's happening
[1957.88 - 1963.68] that's why brain diseases are on the
[1960.24 - 1967.00] rise an alltime rise it's hard to keep
[1963.68 - 1969.00] our brain cells good what I mean by that
[1967.00 - 1971.76] is high production purification of brain
[1969.00 - 1974.24] cells going on what I mean by healthy
[1971.76 - 1976.44] brain cells not not unhealthy brain
[1974.24 - 1978.96] cells and you know it in and so what
[1976.44 - 1981.08] happens with d fasting it it destroys
[1978.96 - 1983.12] and takes out a lot of brain cells
[1981.08 - 1986.12] unnecessarily and and that's not good
[1983.12 - 1987.96] either so keep that off the table that's
[1986.12 - 1990.00] not even in here so juice fasting we'll
[1987.96 - 1992.44] talk about that a little bit too juice
[1990.00 - 1994.16] fasting is is a good one too I mean it
[1992.44 - 1995.68] is some people but remember for
[1994.16 - 1997.44] everybody it's a little different
[1995.68 - 1999.84] everybody it's a little different some
[1997.44 - 2003.20] people have adrenal issues some people
[1999.84 - 2005.12] have um um some people have weak
[2003.20 - 2006.48] constitutions because of adrenal issues
[2005.12 - 2008.28] maybe their nervous system isn't that
[2006.48 - 2012.36] strong maybe they too many toxic heavy
[2008.28 - 2013.96] metals uh maybe they have um um their
[2012.36 - 2015.12] heart isn't that strong a lot of people
[2013.96 - 2017.48] there's a lot of people that walk around
[2015.12 - 2019.56] their hearts aren't that strong they're
[2017.48 - 2020.96] they're just they have weaker hearts and
[2019.56 - 2023.28] there's a lot of different things going
[2020.96 - 2025.52] on in each one of us and every every
[2023.28 - 2027.24] person some people have different levels
[2025.52 - 2029.92] of bacteria some people have different
[2027.24 - 2033.68] levels of viruses some people have both
[2029.92 - 2036.40] um and so we have all this happening so
[2033.68 - 2037.84] juice fasting uh you know is something
[2036.40 - 2040.32] you can do with what I always say with
[2037.84 - 2042.32] juice fasting is you don't go long term
[2040.32 - 2045.44] even with juice fasting because when you
[2042.32 - 2046.88] juice fast long term you if you jump
[2045.44 - 2050.52] into a juice fast and you go into it
[2046.88 - 2052.16] long term you could be putting a lot of
[2050.52 - 2053.40] pressure on the liver you could be
[2052.16 - 2055.24] putting a lot of pressure on the liver
[2053.40 - 2057.72] you could be pushing the little girl off
[2055.24 - 2059.16] the diving board and you could be
[2057.72 - 2060.64] literally pushing that liver off the
[2059.16 - 2063.36] diving board and you it's something to
[2060.64 - 2066.92] really kind of think about and take in
[2063.36 - 2070.48] consideration um juices are amazing and
[2066.92 - 2072.36] incredible but juice fasting also means
[2070.48 - 2074.16] that you know you're not it depends on
[2072.36 - 2077.08] what's in your juices if you're juice
[2074.16 - 2079.44] fasting and there's a carbohydrate in
[2077.08 - 2080.76] your juice it's much better it's much
[2079.44 - 2084.00] better so if you're going to jump into a
[2080.76 - 2085.68] juice fast I'm okay with it but it it
[2084.00 - 2087.96] has to have something in there you know
[2085.68 - 2091.60] like apples have to be in there too it
[2087.96 - 2094.16] has to be something that gives you some
[2091.60 - 2096.16] calories and that's important because
[2094.16 - 2097.80] that'll slow down your cleanse it'll
[2096.16 - 2099.24] slow down your cleanse so your liver's
[2097.80 - 2100.88] not going into shock so your liver is
[2099.24 - 2102.56] not dumping a tremendous amount of
[2100.88 - 2104.92] poison into your bloodstream so your
[2102.56 - 2107.96] liver is not actually you know like
[2104.92 - 2109.56] saturating your bloodstream by releasing
[2107.96 - 2111.08] too much and if you think that's good
[2109.56 - 2112.84] it's not good because your liver sucks
[2111.08 - 2115.44] it all back up and only a little bit
[2112.84 - 2118.72] leaves it's better off that the liver on
[2115.44 - 2121.08] its own literally jumps off the diving
[2118.72 - 2124.28] board on its own by releasing a little
[2121.08 - 2127.08] at a time a little at a time that's it
[2124.28 - 2128.44] that's it and this way the body can
[2127.08 - 2129.84] process it this way the kidneys can
[2128.44 - 2131.12] handle it this way the body can take
[2129.84 - 2132.24] care of it cuz the liver is going to
[2131.12 - 2133.36] protect your kidneys it's going to
[2132.24 - 2135.68] protect your pancreas so when it
[2133.36 - 2137.72] releases all when it's pushed to release
[2135.68 - 2140.04] all that poison that I talk about in
[2137.72 - 2141.20] Liver Rescue when it Le when it releases
[2140.04 - 2143.64] all of that
[2141.20 - 2147.04] junk into the
[2143.64 - 2149.04] bloodstream it doesn't it doesn't damage
[2147.04 - 2151.60] adrenals it doesn't damage the pancreas
[2149.04 - 2154.60] it doesn't damage you know other aspects
[2151.60 - 2156.88] of it doesn't damage your kidneys so
[2154.60 - 2159.52] when you're juice fasting it wouldn't do
[2156.88 - 2162.20] just green juice only I wouldn't do
[2159.52 - 2166.44] something like just green juice only I
[2162.20 - 2169.08] wouldn't do kale and spinach and um and
[2166.44 - 2171.28] celery juice Believe It or Not only if
[2169.08 - 2173.48] it's going to be longterm I wouldn't do
[2171.28 - 2176.08] that I would have cucumbers in there I
[2173.48 - 2178.84] would have apples in there I would have
[2176.08 - 2182.16] pears in there I would have other things
[2178.84 - 2185.44] in there I would even do oranges I would
[2182.16 - 2187.96] have oranges in there and that kind of
[2185.44 - 2190.12] juice fast ensures your brain is getting
[2187.96 - 2193.00] glucose it's getting glucose it's
[2190.12 - 2197.00] getting sugars critically needed
[2193.00 - 2198.44] sugars so it doesn't get injured and
[2197.00 - 2200.60] that's a whole another thing critical
[2198.44 - 2202.64] needed sugars and and another thing so
[2200.60 - 2205.24] this way even your liver gets critically
[2202.64 - 2207.16] needed sugars it gets glucose and that's
[2205.24 - 2208.68] important too and your liver can still
[2207.16 - 2210.88] cleanse so if you're doing a juice fast
[2208.68 - 2214.12] make sure there's carbohydrates in those
[2210.88 - 2215.80] juices that's really important and it
[2214.12 - 2217.40] doesn't have to be in every juice if
[2215.80 - 2219.28] you're doing a juice fast F if you're
[2217.40 - 2220.76] doing a juice Fest for more than a
[2219.28 - 2222.68] couple of days you're going to be
[2220.76 - 2224.64] cleansing a lot more yes you're going to
[2222.68 - 2226.28] be pushing your liver a lot harder but
[2224.64 - 2228.48] like I said before you jump into any big
[2226.28 - 2230.76] cleanses or any big fasts you should
[2228.48 - 2233.20] just get a copy of Liver Rescue and
[2230.76 - 2235.96] consider it just consider the section of
[2233.20 - 2237.52] fasting and how I talk about that too
[2235.96 - 2239.08] before you do anything and if you don't
[2237.52 - 2240.92] like it what you're seeing or whatever
[2239.08 - 2243.64] it is and go to somewhere else and do
[2240.92 - 2247.12] something absolutely but I'm giving you
[2243.64 - 2248.72] the what not to do to keep you safe
[2247.12 - 2250.44] if you are out there doing different
[2248.72 - 2251.76] fasts and stuff like that so if you're
[2250.44 - 2254.64] somebody that has a pretty strong
[2251.76 - 2256.76] Constitution and I mean not that Viral
[2254.64 - 2259.00] feeling pretty strong can handle not
[2256.76 - 2260.68] even eating for a little while can even
[2259.00 - 2263.08] handle not even
[2260.68 - 2264.84] eating and you know like like going
[2263.08 - 2266.40] without food and you know your blood
[2264.84 - 2268.12] sugar doesn't crash hard and you don't
[2266.40 - 2269.36] need a nap and you you you can get
[2268.12 - 2271.36] through your day and you can do a
[2269.36 - 2273.72] million things if you're one of those
[2271.36 - 2276.28] people you know yeah you can do a juice
[2273.72 - 2278.08] fast for a little while longer yeah you
[2276.28 - 2279.44] can I mean you're still it's possible
[2278.08 - 2280.60] you'll still be pushing the liver too
[2279.44 - 2283.28] hard and it'll be dumping a lot of
[2280.60 - 2284.96] poison out but if you're doing a juice
[2283.28 - 2286.84] fast with the carbohydrate I'm talking
[2284.96 - 2288.68] about by having the apples in there the
[2286.84 - 2290.80] with all the greens and having some
[2288.68 - 2292.64] orange in there with all the greens and
[2290.80 - 2295.08] by doing our pears in there with all the
[2292.64 - 2297.12] greens now if you're doing that and some
[2295.08 - 2298.68] even some watermelon in there with with
[2297.12 - 2302.20] everything like just you know juicing
[2298.68 - 2304.80] some watermelon with all of that you
[2302.20 - 2307.16] know you can you can definitely be much
[2304.80 - 2308.92] easier on the liver not so harsh on the
[2307.16 - 2310.88] liver it won't have to dump all this
[2308.92 - 2314.20] poison at once and it can protect you
[2310.88 - 2316.84] for the Long Haul so 3 years down the
[2314.20 - 2318.96] road five years down the road you're not
[2316.84 - 2320.48] hitting the wall and not realizing why
[2318.96 - 2322.32] it's because you did all these crazy
[2320.48 - 2324.04] fasts or did these dry fasts or did
[2322.32 - 2326.92] these other things three years ago four
[2324.04 - 2329.64] years ago and then your brain it ran out
[2326.92 - 2331.20] of glycogen storages that's what happens
[2329.64 - 2334.08] your brain starts running and running
[2331.20 - 2336.04] out of glycogen storage so then she just
[2334.08 - 2337.60] start kind of hitting the wall and you
[2336.04 - 2340.12] start getting confusion and you just
[2337.60 - 2343.32] don't know why it's because you did you
[2340.12 - 2345.20] did a a 10-day dry fast three years ago
[2343.32 - 2348.04] you did you know you did a water fast
[2345.20 - 2349.68] for 14 days you did too many of this you
[2348.04 - 2351.96] did too many of that and you never
[2349.68 - 2354.36] restored and that's a problem too you
[2351.96 - 2357.00] can go to you can do you can do
[2354.36 - 2358.32] different fasts out there and different
[2357.00 - 2359.84] programs and stuff like that but it
[2358.32 - 2361.32] doesn't mean they know how to make sure
[2359.84 - 2363.44] you restore what you lost because they
[2361.32 - 2365.24] don't even know what you lost I mean
[2363.44 - 2367.00] I've talked to some experts in all these
[2365.24 - 2369.36] fields over the years and they don't
[2367.00 - 2371.68] even know like the brain is actually uh
[2369.36 - 2374.08] made of glycogen storage they don't even
[2371.68 - 2376.52] know that it loses all that carbohydrate
[2374.08 - 2378.12] soft tissue it starts to atrophy when
[2376.52 - 2379.80] you're fasting dry fasting and other
[2378.12 - 2381.44] kinds of fasts and they don't even know
[2379.80 - 2383.00] this so they don't know that how you
[2381.44 - 2385.36] have to restore it you have to restore
[2383.00 - 2387.48] it with lots and lots of celery juice
[2385.36 - 2389.40] and that's another thing too none of the
[2387.48 - 2392.28] programs out there fast out there are
[2389.40 - 2394.08] ever using plain straight celery juice
[2392.28 - 2396.84] just they're never using that as a
[2394.08 - 2399.04] recovery tool or even a fasting tool in
[2396.84 - 2401.00] the juice fasting and that's a mistake
[2399.04 - 2402.12] all on its own so they have all these
[2401.00 - 2403.88] different juices but they don't even
[2402.12 - 2405.32] have straight celery juice so you can
[2403.88 - 2406.76] protect your brain so you can protect
[2405.32 - 2410.04] your liver so you can protect what's
[2406.76 - 2412.00] right rightfully yours you see why I'm
[2410.04 - 2415.48] frustrated and you see why I had to do
[2412.00 - 2418.08] the show and so it it these are all the
[2415.48 - 2419.68] things to to to consider all the things
[2418.08 - 2421.96] to consider I'm not trying to make it
[2419.68 - 2424.96] complicated if you're if you're a strong
[2421.96 - 2428.00] person and you've already if you've
[2424.96 - 2430.64] already been eating good good for a
[2428.00 - 2432.32] while eating clean for a while maybe
[2430.64 - 2433.84] even the 28 day cleanse for a while
[2432.32 - 2437.40] maybe just eating
[2433.84 - 2439.76] clean for a while not a lot of junk not
[2437.40 - 2441.44] so much fats not so much fats and not a
[2439.76 - 2443.00] lot of junk and you're eating clean for
[2441.44 - 2444.24] a while more fruits and vegetables more
[2443.00 - 2446.24] fruits and vegetables and you're doing
[2444.24 - 2447.60] your lemon water because your lemon
[2446.24 - 2449.28] water is cleansing your liver every
[2447.60 - 2451.32] single day a little bit and you're doing
[2449.28 - 2456.44] all of that and you're doing some celery
[2451.32 - 2458.72] juice every single day so then you want
[2456.44 - 2461.76] to jump into a little bit of a water
[2458.72 - 2463.12] fast okay you know what I'm on board you
[2461.76 - 2465.32] want to jump if that's what you really
[2463.12 - 2469.32] want if you want to jump into a juice
[2465.32 - 2474.80] fast done right yeah okay I'm on board
[2469.32 - 2476.92] I'm on board so but what I recommend is
[2474.80 - 2478.80] you do the celery juice but you really
[2476.92 - 2480.12] do it there's people out there I see it
[2478.80 - 2481.68] all the time they don't even do their
[2480.12 - 2484.48] celer jues but then they get pushed into
[2481.68 - 2486.96] some fasting program and in that fasting
[2484.48 - 2489.00] program they also sell like a zillion
[2486.96 - 2491.36] herbs with alcohol in them I'm gonna
[2489.00 - 2495.36] have to cover that for a second okay if
[2491.36 - 2497.64] you're running into like some kind of
[2495.36 - 2500.60] some guy or some gal's
[2497.64 - 2501.92] program that that has supplements in it
[2500.60 - 2504.96] and they're recommending all the stuff
[2501.92 - 2506.88] and there's alcohol in those supplements
[2504.96 - 2507.84] then you're in the wrong place you're in
[2506.88 - 2512.28] the wrong
[2507.84 - 2515.16] place absolutely 100% the alcohol it it
[2512.28 - 2517.20] kills all of your internal bacteria in
[2515.16 - 2521.08] your intestinal tract in your gut
[2517.20 - 2523.28] destroys all of your good bacteria and
[2521.08 - 2525.20] microorganisms so if you're doctor
[2523.28 - 2526.64] practitioner you're expert your Guru
[2525.20 - 2528.72] doesn't know that and they're selling
[2526.64 - 2532.24] you kits with alcohol in
[2528.72 - 2535.08] them that's right there should tell you
[2532.24 - 2537.08] back out because what happens is that
[2535.08 - 2538.72] that that's what one of the most oh my
[2537.08 - 2541.16] God I can't even tell you how important
[2538.72 - 2543.88] that is all that alcohol all that
[2541.16 - 2546.24] alcohol gets inside the liver all that
[2543.88 - 2547.80] tincture alcohol gets inside the liver
[2546.24 - 2549.40] all that tinure alcohol wipes out all
[2547.80 - 2551.00] the microorganisms in the gut all that
[2549.40 - 2553.00] tincture alcohol blows out your
[2551.00 - 2555.60] hydrochloric acid
[2553.00 - 2558.08] reserves and that's just that's just to
[2555.60 - 2560.00] start with that's just to start with I
[2558.08 - 2562.48] don't care if it's grape alcohol I don't
[2560.00 - 2564.00] care what kind of alcohol it is so you
[2562.48 - 2566.00] have to know that and I noticed that
[2564.00 - 2567.84] there's fasting fasting you know kits
[2566.00 - 2569.76] and fasting things out there and gurus
[2567.84 - 2571.12] and stuff promoting that and then they
[2569.76 - 2572.40] have that in there and you spend all
[2571.12 - 2574.04] this money and you're you're dumping
[2572.40 - 2576.32] straight alcohol tinctures and straight
[2574.04 - 2578.84] alcohol in your system I've never seen
[2576.32 - 2583.00] anything just so ridiculous so just look
[2578.84 - 2584.72] out for that look out for that okay um
[2583.00 - 2586.96] so if you're somebody that if you're
[2584.72 - 2590.12] somebody look I would I would do the
[2586.96 - 2592.12] celery juice I would really do it I
[2590.12 - 2592.92] would really do it and I would really
[2592.12 - 2596.88] eat
[2592.92 - 2598.84] clean and then you can do a juice fast
[2596.88 - 2601.96] but first before you do anything I would
[2598.84 - 2602.72] look at the Liver Rescue and just look
[2601.96 - 2605.48] at
[2602.72 - 2607.36] that and feel it out and see how you
[2605.48 - 2609.52] feel about it
[2607.36 - 2611.16] and because honestly it's and it's it's
[2609.52 - 2613.24] really easy to do too it's really easy
[2611.16 - 2618.04] to do when you get it you'll see it but
[2613.24 - 2620.44] the bottom line is is um I do I do yes I
[2618.04 - 2622.52] do support water fasting small
[2620.44 - 2624.20] increments for the right people that
[2622.52 - 2626.72] have already gotten themselves clean
[2624.20 - 2628.76] enough so they don't shock their liver
[2626.72 - 2631.72] shock their bodies fill it up with
[2628.76 - 2633.68] poison and then go backwards later on
[2631.72 - 2636.76] including hurting their adrenals later
[2633.68 - 2638.16] on so I do support water fast testing if
[2636.76 - 2639.52] you've you know when if you've gotten to
[2638.16 - 2641.36] a point where you've done the celery
[2639.52 - 2643.24] juice for a year you've done the celery
[2641.36 - 2644.80] juice for 6 months you've been working
[2643.24 - 2647.12] on healing you've been doing all your
[2644.80 - 2650.00] you've been really cleaning yourself up
[2647.12 - 2651.84] fast tracking out of the fact that
[2650.00 - 2654.28] people feel like they just don't have it
[2651.84 - 2656.84] in them to do any of the work and they
[2654.28 - 2658.80] want to FastTrack something that's scary
[2656.84 - 2660.48] so they just jump into some fasting kits
[2658.80 - 2662.56] some fasting program whatever it is just
[2660.48 - 2664.08] be careful
[2662.56 - 2667.24] um
[2664.08 - 2668.84] and juice fasting the same thing but
[2667.24 - 2670.20] juice fasting you want to do a long-term
[2668.84 - 2672.56] juice faster you know like you want to
[2670.20 - 2674.84] be a long long-term juice faster there
[2672.56 - 2677.92] better be a carbohydrate in that juice
[2674.84 - 2682.00] it can't just be only
[2677.92 - 2685.20] only um non-starchy vegetables and green
[2682.00 - 2686.80] leafy greens has to be there has to be
[2685.20 - 2688.36] always celery involved but you have to
[2686.80 - 2689.48] also have the carbohydrate ones you have
[2688.36 - 2692.00] to have the apples you have to have the
[2689.48 - 2693.40] Cucumbers you have to have these options
[2692.00 - 2695.32] you have to have peirs you have to have
[2693.40 - 2696.56] oranges and even you can be creative you
[2695.32 - 2698.72] can you other other things too you could
[2696.56 - 2700.72] have watermelon whatever it is that has
[2698.72 - 2702.44] to be in there that's really important
[2700.72 - 2704.44] if you're doing juice fast along with
[2702.44 - 2707.88] the greens along with lots of celery
[2704.44 - 2710.04] juice by itself by itself and then other
[2707.88 - 2712.28] juices with the carbs in there with the
[2710.04 - 2714.68] the healthy the healthy carbs in there
[2712.28 - 2716.60] so your brain does an atrophy so you can
[2714.68 - 2717.88] actually get the electrolytes strong so
[2716.60 - 2719.44] you can actually do what you need to do
[2717.88 - 2721.52] while you're fasting and removing
[2719.44 - 2724.76] poisons and removing toxins let's talk
[2721.52 - 2728.24] about intermittent fasting now first of
[2724.76 - 2730.72] all most most of you probably know about
[2728.24 - 2732.76] the the adrenal snacks I always promote
[2730.72 - 2736.64] you should be eating every couple of
[2732.76 - 2738.24] hours okay you know that and um and that
[2736.64 - 2740.24] that's a critical thing to understand
[2738.24 - 2742.04] that you that what happens is that
[2740.24 - 2744.12] people that people have these weak
[2742.04 - 2746.16] nervous systems most of the people that
[2744.12 - 2748.16] have ever come to me and have ever you
[2746.16 - 2749.40] know gotten the medical medium books
[2748.16 - 2752.92] they're dealing with a lot of
[2749.40 - 2754.96] neurological problems anxiety depression
[2752.92 - 2758.36] migraines of all different kinds neck
[2754.96 - 2761.52] pain back pain pain body pain Tremors
[2758.36 - 2764.04] shakes Twitches severe fatigue
[2761.52 - 2767.64] neurological fatigue brain
[2764.04 - 2769.20] inflamation um tingles numbness ringing
[2767.64 - 2770.48] in the ears they're dealing with
[2769.20 - 2773.16] everything
[2770.48 - 2776.04] neurological everything neurological
[2773.16 - 2777.80] burning Burning Sensations you know
[2776.04 - 2779.52] everything under the sun and it's the
[2777.80 - 2781.36] people that have always they're always
[2779.52 - 2783.24] seeking real answers they're seeking the
[2781.36 - 2785.00] truth so they can move forward and heal
[2783.24 - 2786.64] and and that's that's that's what it's
[2785.00 - 2791.44] all about that's that's what it's all
[2786.64 - 2793.84] about and um and with that th this large
[2791.44 - 2796.28] group of people that we have that's out
[2793.84 - 2799.84] there in the world and that needs help
[2796.28 - 2801.96] it's if they go too long without eating
[2799.84 - 2805.76] their adrenals and their nervous system
[2801.96 - 2808.16] and their neuro fatigue can get worse so
[2805.76 - 2811.24] the every the every couple of hours and
[2808.16 - 2813.00] eating is to protect this to protect
[2811.24 - 2814.36] everyone so it's like you and you don't
[2813.00 - 2816.40] have to eat a large meal every couple
[2814.36 - 2818.64] hours it's just once you go go 2 three
[2816.40 - 2820.12] hours without food once you go 2 three
[2818.64 - 2821.84] hours without food your blood sugar
[2820.12 - 2823.44] drops and you're running on adrenaline
[2821.84 - 2824.88] now so now your adrenals are running and
[2823.44 - 2826.76] you're running on adrenaline adrenaline
[2824.88 - 2828.84] makes more neuro fatigue and it makes
[2826.76 - 2830.68] more adrenal fatigue and it makes more
[2828.84 - 2834.04] liver problems and it makes more blood
[2830.68 - 2836.48] sugar problems so always always
[2834.04 - 2839.20] advocated you know to to make sure you
[2836.48 - 2840.96] you have snacks throughout the day and
[2839.20 - 2842.56] you're not pulling that whole thing that
[2840.96 - 2844.12] we're taught when we're younger when we
[2842.56 - 2846.04] go to college or anything else even
[2844.12 - 2847.44] though I never went to college and we go
[2846.04 - 2849.24] to college and we're doing whatever
[2847.44 - 2851.16] we're doing it's you know you're just
[2849.24 - 2853.48] like you're running on empty all day
[2851.16 - 2854.84] long with ad with adrenaline running and
[2853.48 - 2856.68] you know it's like that kind of thing
[2854.84 - 2858.68] and we kind of carry that out to the
[2856.68 - 2861.12] workforce and when we get older and
[2858.68 - 2862.60] everything and then when you're sick and
[2861.12 - 2863.84] you can't get out of bed and you got the
[2862.60 - 2867.32] neuro fatigue and you're sick and
[2863.84 - 2869.24] everything the the you you also can't go
[2867.32 - 2871.24] too long without getting some fuel in
[2869.24 - 2872.40] you so that's why you that's another
[2871.24 - 2874.24] thing too it's important to have the
[2872.40 - 2876.36] every two hours but intermittent fasting
[2874.24 - 2878.48] I do also support
[2876.36 - 2880.44] so there's some people where it is
[2878.48 - 2883.48] helpful where they they don't eat
[2880.44 - 2886.12] anything in the morning a part of that a
[2883.48 - 2887.84] part of that um you know H happens
[2886.12 - 2890.28] because if they do eat in the morning
[2887.84 - 2892.72] they feel kind of thrown by everything
[2890.28 - 2894.24] they feel thrown they don't feel right
[2892.72 - 2896.52] or they just feel like their digestion
[2894.24 - 2899.52] can't handle it yet so I totally totally
[2896.52 - 2901.56] totally support intermittent fasting too
[2899.52 - 2903.80] and there are people out there that I've
[2901.56 - 2906.00] had to say hey look why don't you just
[2903.80 - 2908.84] do why don't you why don't you do your
[2906.00 - 2910.08] lemon water in the morning and just go
[2908.84 - 2912.96] that go until
[2910.08 - 2914.44] 11:00 and then at 11:00 you know have
[2912.96 - 2916.72] your first
[2914.44 - 2920.16] snack and you know and there's there you
[2916.72 - 2923.92] know or you know you can go longer but
[2920.16 - 2926.44] it's only it's not a forever thing for
[2923.92 - 2928.04] people so always remember that if it it
[2926.44 - 2929.96] could work for you in that moment in
[2928.04 - 2931.48] your life it can work for you for that 6
[2929.96 - 2933.60] months it could work for you for that
[2931.48 - 2936.48] year but always but
[2933.60 - 2938.24] never never fall into to the to the
[2936.48 - 2940.04] feeling that that's the way it always
[2938.24 - 2942.88] has to be and you always have to do
[2940.04 - 2945.12] intermittent fasting where you you don't
[2942.88 - 2947.60] eat for half a day or you don't eat for
[2945.12 - 2950.04] 3/4 of a day don't feel that that's a
[2947.60 - 2952.56] forever thing that might be a moment in
[2950.04 - 2954.20] your life might be a moment in your life
[2952.56 - 2955.84] where you're doing that and then you're
[2954.20 - 2958.28] eating later in the afternoon and you're
[2955.84 - 2960.48] eating at the end of the day and and
[2958.28 - 2962.60] that feels good for you and that feels
[2960.48 - 2965.28] like it eases off your digestion so what
[2962.60 - 2968.48] happens is a lot of people a lot of
[2965.28 - 2971.60] people have inflamed intestinal tracts
[2968.48 - 2973.40] inflamed dadums they even have hypers
[2971.60 - 2975.12] sensitive nerves and their stomach
[2973.40 - 2976.44] Linings and in their small intestinal
[2975.12 - 2977.96] tract and their large intes they have
[2976.44 - 2981.00] highly sensitive nerves so when they put
[2977.96 - 2984.52] food in every anytime they eat they put
[2981.00 - 2986.28] food in it it it rubs on everything so
[2984.52 - 2987.88] it goes through the stomach through the
[2986.28 - 2989.72] dadum down into the small intestinal
[2987.88 - 2991.96] tract and it rubs on all the nerves and
[2989.72 - 2993.60] they feel like they can't digest they
[2991.96 - 2995.56] feel like they're in pain and they feel
[2993.60 - 2997.00] like they're hurting so they don't want
[2995.56 - 2999.16] to eat and they feel better if they
[2997.00 - 3000.12] don't eat for like half a day or eat for
[2999.16 - 3003.04] a little
[3000.12 - 3005.52] while and and then they you know until
[3003.04 - 3008.56] they finally have to eat so I mean I
[3005.52 - 3011.08] total look I'm supportive of it totally
[3008.56 - 3013.08] supportive of it if you can't eat the
[3011.08 - 3014.64] every 2 hours to keep your blood sugar
[3013.08 - 3016.08] stable to protect your liver protect
[3014.64 - 3017.68] your adrenals so they don't run and
[3016.08 - 3021.12] flood the body if you can't eat every
[3017.68 - 3023.84] two hours try every 3 hours you know if
[3021.12 - 3026.60] you can't eat every 3 hours yeah try
[3023.84 - 3029.68] every 4 hours if you have to something
[3026.60 - 3032.08] like that but you but the but the point
[3029.68 - 3035.04] is the point is is that you can
[3032.08 - 3039.12] intermittent F you can do that that's
[3035.04 - 3041.28] okay if that feels good I I have
[3039.12 - 3045.20] recommended that for a lot of people
[3041.28 - 3047.76] over the years I have and but it's not
[3045.20 - 3048.88] longterm too you try it out you see
[3047.76 - 3050.40] there's going to be times in your life
[3048.88 - 3051.92] where you feel like you can do it and
[3050.40 - 3054.56] you feel like it makes you feel good and
[3051.92 - 3056.40] it eases things up and and it gives you
[3054.56 - 3057.64] more clarity during the day and stuff
[3056.40 - 3059.28] like that then that there's some people
[3057.64 - 3061.92] that feel that way and then there's
[3059.28 - 3063.80] times where it may you may not be in a
[3061.92 - 3065.32] place in your life where all of a sudden
[3063.80 - 3066.64] now you're under some different stress
[3065.32 - 3068.84] and you got to do this or you got to
[3066.64 - 3071.80] work or something has to happen and you
[3068.84 - 3073.76] can't run like that and you need to do
[3071.80 - 3075.40] the adrenal snacks you need to do the
[3073.76 - 3077.56] adrenal snacks you need to do the blood
[3075.40 - 3079.52] sugar support snacks you need to make
[3077.56 - 3080.96] sure you're getting some fuel to your
[3079.52 - 3082.64] brain you're making sure you're getting
[3080.96 - 3085.88] some sugars to your brain so you can
[3082.64 - 3090.20] function and so it could it could very
[3085.88 - 3092.80] at different times in your life um so
[3090.20 - 3095.36] what do I like I like juice fasting I
[3092.80 - 3098.84] like water fasting I like intermittent
[3095.36 - 3103.16] fasting I do I do I do I do I don't like
[3098.84 - 3105.20] dry fasting but in the in the way I'm
[3103.16 - 3107.32] saying I like the try I in the way I'm
[3105.20 - 3108.76] saying I like the water fasting and I
[3107.32 - 3111.68] like the juice fasting intermittent
[3108.76 - 3114.12] fasting okay in the way I'm saying and
[3111.68 - 3115.96] um I know a lot of people they can't go
[3114.12 - 3118.24] without they can't go without a snack
[3115.96 - 3120.56] for out a couple of hours and if they do
[3118.24 - 3123.00] they start falling apart I've had people
[3120.56 - 3124.44] contact me recently where they were so
[3123.00 - 3125.72] busy and they were running around all
[3124.44 - 3127.24] day long and they're dropping their kids
[3125.72 - 3129.48] off at soccer and they're doing this and
[3127.24 - 3132.20] they just all like they started just
[3129.48 - 3134.44] getting shaky and shaking every day and
[3132.20 - 3137.40] feeling weaker and and when you really
[3134.44 - 3139.52] looked at it they ran about seven hours
[3137.40 - 3142.40] during the day six seven hours during
[3139.52 - 3145.60] the day without one thing without eating
[3142.40 - 3146.64] one thing one thing and their blood was
[3145.60 - 3149.60] literally
[3146.64 - 3151.96] crashing and like crashing and and and
[3149.60 - 3154.96] they were out of glucose and their
[3151.96 - 3156.52] nervous system was getting weaker and so
[3154.96 - 3159.32] you know intermittent fasting doesn't
[3156.52 - 3162.12] work for everybody but there is a small
[3159.32 - 3165.12] crowd that can try it and it can help
[3162.12 - 3168.32] them until things change and they get a
[3165.12 - 3170.04] little stronger or or things change and
[3168.32 - 3171.84] they feel like they can eat more and
[3170.04 - 3173.20] their inflammation drops down in their
[3171.84 - 3175.04] intestinal tract from all the other
[3173.20 - 3177.92] things they're doing and eating clean
[3175.04 - 3180.04] and not eating um the wrong Foods so
[3177.92 - 3181.84] yeah so intermittent fasting I support
[3180.04 - 3183.76] too so these are these are the three
[3181.84 - 3187.44] different options three different
[3183.76 - 3188.80] options if you're you know getting told
[3187.44 - 3191.44] if you're getting something tells you to
[3188.80 - 3195.28] jump into a long water fast I would just
[3191.44 - 3197.32] wait and at least get Liver Rescue in
[3195.28 - 3199.44] your hands so you can understand more
[3197.32 - 3201.48] about fasting more about how the liver
[3199.44 - 3203.12] works so you're not paying a price down
[3201.48 - 3205.36] the road with the liver it it's
[3203.12 - 3207.56] important because we got to care care
[3205.36 - 3210.48] for our liver and care for and get it
[3207.56 - 3212.56] cleaned up safely so that if you do a
[3210.48 - 3214.40] juice fast longer you know how to
[3212.56 - 3215.68] protect yourself if you do a water fast
[3214.40 - 3217.48] longer because that's what you want to
[3215.68 - 3219.48] do spiritually or something then you
[3217.48 - 3222.24] know how to protect you could protect
[3219.48 - 3223.52] yourself more and that's the key so
[3222.24 - 3225.56] right now I'm basically what I'm saying
[3223.52 - 3227.40] is gradually go from like doing the
