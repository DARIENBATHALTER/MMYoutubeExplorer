[63.84 - 67.28] question hello
[64.80 - 68.32] what are your thoughts about coffee so
[67.28 - 71.92] okay
[68.32 - 74.80] my real thoughts about coffee matcha tea
[71.92 - 75.52] chocolate the caffeine industry the
[74.80 - 77.84] caffeine this
[75.52 - 78.72] industry just they really want to
[77.84 - 81.12] control
[78.72 - 82.48] people and that's their like that's
[81.12 - 84.80] their mission
[82.48 - 86.40] it's get people addicted get people
[84.80 - 88.08] hooked and own their soul
[86.40 - 90.24] that's what the caffeine industry wants
[88.08 - 92.00] to do and i'm not talking about really
[90.24 - 94.88] good heartache good intentioned
[92.00 - 95.28] people who start up you know a coffee
[94.88 - 97.84] shop
[95.28 - 99.28] a coffee business um you know whatever
[97.84 - 100.40] they want to sell a really good matcha
[99.28 - 103.20] tea i'm
[100.40 - 105.12] not talking about that that kind of
[103.20 - 106.80] thing where it's that i'm talking about
[105.12 - 109.60] the industry above them that gets
[106.80 - 110.96] them addicted too it's it's an addiction
[109.60 - 113.20] caffeine's a drug
[110.96 - 115.60] okay it sounds harsh it's all good but
[113.20 - 118.16] what happens is women get hair thinning
[115.60 - 118.64] and it comes from years of caffeine not
[118.16 - 120.40] every
[118.64 - 121.84] not everybody the hair thinning can
[120.40 - 123.76] happen for a few other reasons a couple
[121.84 - 126.24] of other reasons but
[123.76 - 127.28] but for the most part the caffeinated
[126.24 - 129.84] beverages
[127.28 - 131.76] the chocolate what it does is it beats
[129.84 - 134.24] down women's adrenals and women
[131.76 - 135.36] need their adrenals super strong for
[134.24 - 137.84] pregnancies
[135.36 - 138.72] for birthing babies for the reproductive
[137.84 - 140.56] system
[138.72 - 142.16] for the fact that they handle so much
[140.56 - 144.96] and they do more do more
[142.16 - 146.88] they do so much more than even men do in
[144.96 - 148.16] so many cases women are actually
[146.88 - 150.64] you know they have it much harder in
[148.16 - 150.96] many ways um i mean i know women they
[150.64 - 154.88] have
[150.96 - 156.80] 20 jobs i mean 20 jobs and
[154.88 - 158.08] and they're doing 20 jobs from the
[156.80 - 159.12] minute they wake up in the morning to
[158.08 - 160.32] the minute they go to bed
[159.12 - 161.76] they're raising children taking care of
[160.32 - 163.20] their family they're working you know
[161.76 - 163.92] two jobs they're doing all these things
[163.20 - 166.56] combined
[163.92 - 168.24] and the caffeine is kind of like it's a
[166.56 - 169.28] scary thing because it burns out the
[168.24 - 171.44] adrenals it gets
[169.28 - 172.48] it actually starts to beat down the
[171.44 - 175.44] adrenals
[172.48 - 176.80] hormone blend the one that keeps hair on
[175.44 - 180.24] women's heads
[176.80 - 182.16] and and so you know caffeine is a big
[180.24 - 184.40] part of that another thing it does it
[182.16 - 186.48] causes chronic dehydration over time
[184.40 - 188.32] it beats down the liver it breaks down
[186.48 - 189.60] the liver it gets it weak it gets its
[188.32 - 192.80] stagnant and sluggish
[189.60 - 194.64] um and it causes adrenaline surges for
[192.80 - 195.92] people to be in fight and flight every
[194.64 - 197.36] day so that's that's the whole thing so
[195.92 - 198.56] what do i think about coffee
[197.36 - 200.16] if you're look if you've got nothing
[198.56 - 202.08] going on there's no so you have no
[200.16 - 205.28] symptoms you have nothing wrong
[202.08 - 206.72] you feel great everything's good and you
[205.28 - 207.76] want to do coffee drinks and you want to
[206.72 - 209.20] do much tea and you want to eat
[207.76 - 210.56] chocolate vine i mean
[209.20 - 212.24] it's you know it's not that i'm like
[210.56 - 214.16] freaking out or anything about it
[212.24 - 215.68] it's just if you got fatigue if you have
[214.16 - 217.60] symptoms if you got
[215.68 - 218.88] some some brain fog if you have issues
[217.60 - 220.80] of all kinds of different kinds let's
[218.88 - 222.40] get down to the bottom of those issues
[220.80 - 225.68] let's get down to the bottom of fatigue
[222.40 - 228.32] and brain fog and anxiety and depression
[225.68 - 229.36] and you know and but the chains of
[228.32 - 231.52] addiction
[229.36 - 232.56] or the the caffeine industry it's a
[231.52 - 234.96] monster
[232.56 - 236.48] that has shareholders at the top and
[234.96 - 240.16] those shareholders want to make sure
[236.48 - 243.76] every girl and every woman every
[240.16 - 247.12] man too is addicted in every way
[243.76 - 248.64] possible to caffeine that's the industry
[247.12 - 250.88] they want them all hooked and they
[248.64 - 253.12] wanted to own the person's soul
[250.88 - 255.44] and they wanted to the caffeine industry
[253.12 - 256.24] knows that if they can just control
[255.44 - 259.52] women
[256.24 - 261.20] on a caffeine addiction they got them
[259.52 - 262.88] they're set they're set and they can
[261.20 - 264.72] they can make trillions off of
[262.88 - 266.48] off of caffeine you know caffeine from
[264.72 - 269.52] there on out it's it's really
[266.48 - 272.32] it's a really important topic um lisa
[269.52 - 275.04] says coffee is my biggest obstacle
[272.32 - 276.88] because it's it's it's a tough one it's
[275.04 - 279.92] like it's it's an addiction
[276.88 - 282.32] and i listen i don't blame you one bit
[279.92 - 284.72] you need to know this like when when the
[282.32 - 286.48] industries get us hooked on something
[284.72 - 288.48] and they don't teach us otherwise and
[286.48 - 289.92] they don't give us opportunities and
[288.48 - 291.36] we don't get these opportunities to find
[289.92 - 293.36] out what's going on with why we have
[291.36 - 294.64] brain fog or why we got fatigue and why
[293.36 - 296.64] we don't feel good
[294.64 - 298.80] and the industries don't want us to know
[296.64 - 301.44] how to fix those things they want us
[298.80 - 301.92] hooked on that coffee so lisa it's not
[301.44 - 303.44] like
[301.92 - 305.04] it's not like it's your fault on any
[303.44 - 306.32] level and plus it tastes good when you
[305.04 - 308.48] put sugar in it
[306.32 - 310.56] and you put you know you know if you put
[308.48 - 312.40] sugar in coffee and you put whatever
[310.56 - 313.68] soy cream or soy you would have soy
[312.40 - 314.32] creamer or cream in it or whatever you
[313.68 - 317.04] want to do
[314.32 - 318.16] it tastes good right and so that's the
[317.04 - 320.56] whole thing on its own
[318.16 - 321.92] but but it's not your fault if it's your
[320.56 - 323.36] biggest obstacle
[321.92 - 325.84] you're a good person you didn't do
[323.36 - 328.48] anything wrong not at all
[325.84 - 330.64] it's it's the industry is evil i'm just
[328.48 - 333.84] gonna be straight out the coffee
[330.64 - 334.56] matcha tea caffeinated industry i don't
[333.84 - 337.04] care how
[334.56 - 339.36] woke or evolved it all seems with the
[337.04 - 342.56] cutest coffee you know
[339.36 - 344.00] um like coffee campaigns and matcha tea
[342.56 - 346.16] campaigns out there
[344.00 - 347.60] i have respect for for owners of these
[346.16 - 350.00] companies as far as not the
[347.60 - 352.32] not the industry itself but respect for
[350.00 - 354.16] coffee shop owners and uh
[352.32 - 356.16] majesty brands that are trying to get
[354.16 - 358.00] their first match of tea out to
[356.16 - 359.52] for people like high quality i got
[358.00 - 360.32] respect for everybody good chocolate i
[359.52 - 361.92] got respect for
[360.32 - 364.00] people who want to get their first you
[361.92 - 365.92] know what they wanna they wanna
[364.00 - 367.20] get into you know start a company in a
[365.92 - 368.72] business and sell chocolate i get
[367.20 - 370.72] respect for everybody
[368.72 - 372.32] that's not it that's not the people i'm
[370.72 - 375.44] talking about above them
[372.32 - 378.16] is this hierarchy is this evil giant
[375.44 - 380.08] and that evil giant is downright
[378.16 - 384.32] despicable and
[380.08 - 387.04] that giant needs women especially women
[384.32 - 388.88] hooked on coffee they want them hooked
[387.04 - 390.32] on caffeine they want them hooked on
[388.88 - 392.24] you know the teas they want them hooked
[390.32 - 394.48] on everything and
[392.24 - 395.44] it's really sad and they want to own
[394.48 - 396.88] women's souls
[395.44 - 398.56] and that's what that industry wants to
[396.88 - 401.68] do i know this for a fact
[398.56 - 403.68] this is what they do and um
[401.68 - 404.72] and it's you know it's one of those
[403.68 - 407.44] things
[404.72 - 408.64] hey brandi you're awesome too um there
[407.44 - 410.72] you know
[408.64 - 412.64] so i briefly saw something you talked
[410.72 - 413.68] about with the dangers of diatomaceous
[412.64 - 415.84] earth by the way
[413.68 - 416.72] so diastomace diatomaceous earth
[415.84 - 419.92] particles
[416.72 - 421.68] um and someone said i didn't know this
[419.92 - 422.00] but i took it i took it for about two
[421.68 - 424.72] weeks
[422.00 - 426.24] straight as did my sister now we both
[424.72 - 427.76] have issues with their joints being way
[426.24 - 430.08] too loose and they feel like they could
[427.76 - 432.32] easily just come out of their sockets
[430.08 - 434.08] plus my knees start to feel like they're
[432.32 - 436.08] tearing for no reason just
[434.08 - 437.60] walking and standing makes them hard
[436.08 - 440.16] start start to tear
[437.60 - 441.28] um have to sometimes wear a knee brace
[440.16 - 443.60] now shoulders hurt
[441.28 - 445.68] and everything pops will this ever fully
[443.60 - 448.16] heal is there something i can do
[445.68 - 448.72] with the whole diatomaceous earth thing
[448.16 - 450.08] and
[448.72 - 452.00] and the side effects so that's
[450.08 - 455.36] diatomaceous i've
[452.00 - 458.40] i've i've been anti-diatomaceous earth
[455.36 - 459.76] particles from the beginning um not a
[458.40 - 462.56] big fan of it
[459.76 - 464.16] from you know what i've seen and what
[462.56 - 466.96] spirit of compassion some
[464.16 - 467.92] say soc right spirit of compassion has
[466.96 - 469.84] told me is
[467.92 - 472.08] it's just not great for the immune
[469.84 - 473.84] system not great for the immune system
[472.08 - 475.28] and it's hard on the digestive tract so
[473.84 - 476.72] it's those two things here so if you
[475.28 - 478.96] have something going on like
[476.72 - 480.00] an epstein barr and your sister has an
[478.96 - 481.60] epstein bar
[480.00 - 483.44] and you've got the sepsis bar sitting
[481.60 - 485.04] inside of you and it's probably about to
[483.44 - 486.88] come out and do its thing
[485.04 - 488.40] and low-grade viral infection i talk
[486.88 - 489.68] about you know and cleanse the heal when
[488.40 - 491.20] people have the epstein bars they have
[489.68 - 491.68] fibromyalgia and they have all these
[491.20 - 493.84] other
[491.68 - 495.04] you know joint pain and all these
[493.84 - 496.56] different symptoms
[495.04 - 497.84] and you take the diatomaceous earth
[496.56 - 499.60] particles or you take you know what
[497.84 - 500.16] however in what form or you breed them
[499.60 - 503.92] in
[500.16 - 504.72] it it it kind of it's hard on the immune
[503.92 - 506.56] system
[504.72 - 508.16] and when it's hard on the immune system
[506.56 - 511.36] anything else can creep up
[508.16 - 513.68] anything can creep up so um everybody
[511.36 - 515.52] has a chance to heal everybody has an
[513.68 - 517.04] opportunity to get past whatever
[515.52 - 518.56] you know adversities they're up against
[517.04 - 520.96] their health and have a chance to heal
[518.56 - 521.60] you know and the angels are always on
[520.96 - 523.52] our side
[521.60 - 525.28] they're always looking out for us you
[523.52 - 527.04] know um and i'm going to talk more about
[525.28 - 530.00] that every now and then too
[527.04 - 531.20] but yeah there's but but i just i always
[530.00 - 532.64] tell people you know stay away from
[531.20 - 534.00] diatomaceous earth
[532.64 - 536.40] but i tell people to stay away from a
[534.00 - 537.44] lot of things the caffeine i tell them
[536.40 - 538.48] because that will knock
[537.44 - 540.72] knock the immune system i've seen
[538.48 - 543.60] caffeine make people so sick
[540.72 - 544.80] so sick and and you know it's
[543.60 - 547.20] unbelievable really
[544.80 - 548.00] and then the same i tell people stay
[547.20 - 549.36] away from nutritional
[548.00 - 551.68] yeast i tell people to say a lot of
[549.36 - 553.44] thing away from things that people
[551.68 - 554.72] don't know about bentonite clay stay
[553.44 - 556.48] away from bentonite clay
[554.72 - 558.40] stay away from apple cider vinegar i bet
[556.48 - 559.60] you i just angered a whole bunch of
[558.40 - 562.16] people just now right
[559.60 - 563.92] you guys are probably like all upset but
[562.16 - 566.48] stay away from apple cider vinegar
[563.92 - 568.16] it'll just pickle your liver it'll
[566.48 - 571.04] stress out your system all that talk
[568.16 - 571.04] about all what it does
[571.84 - 576.24] so going through the questions right now
[574.48 - 577.76] deborah says i'm so addicted
[576.24 - 580.00] you know what you know the thing is with
[577.76 - 582.00] the caffeine industry
[580.00 - 583.36] it which is really sad is even when you
[582.00 - 585.60] know you're addicted
[583.36 - 586.80] and you can't break it that's how
[585.60 - 589.36] powerful that is
[586.80 - 591.12] and chocolate's all fun and all you know
[589.36 - 592.40] you see influencers eating their healthy
[591.12 - 594.00] chocolates wanting to put their healthy
[592.40 - 596.08] chocolates out their cacao
[594.00 - 597.92] and they're just they're sucked in
[596.08 - 599.44] they're sucked into the madness
[597.92 - 600.96] to the industries controlling them in
[599.44 - 605.28] their soul so it's all about
[600.96 - 608.80] like it's amazing how it works
[605.28 - 611.68] um so here's a question here
[608.80 - 612.24] charlene i just want to i just want to
[611.68 - 614.48] thank you
[612.24 - 616.56] the divine and the angel compassion for
[614.48 - 618.24] turning us onto celery juice
[616.56 - 619.68] i i think spirit of compassion all the
[618.24 - 621.84] time about celery juice
[619.68 - 622.96] once i began doing the protocol
[621.84 - 626.16] correctly
[622.96 - 627.44] the course correction was fast anthony i
[626.16 - 629.28] thank you for being a
[627.44 - 630.72] superb instrument and helping us bless
[629.28 - 632.32] your heart so you're working on the

[654.32 - 661.28] therapy specifically to treat lyme or
[658.08 - 664.88] other chronic diseases okay
[661.28 - 669.20] so my opinion on that any opinion
[664.88 - 672.56] on that sorry on the uh venom therapy so
[669.20 - 674.88] um here's the thing with b venom therapy
[672.56 - 676.72] okay i'm not trying to take away
[674.88 - 679.12] somebody's therapy
[676.72 - 680.64] if they really find relief or they
[679.12 - 682.48] really find something out of that they
[680.64 - 682.96] really like but i can talk about it here
[682.48 - 684.80] on
[682.96 - 686.16] what i know about it and what spirit of
[684.80 - 688.16] compassion has taught me about it and
[686.16 - 691.36] what i teach doctors about it too
[688.16 - 693.44] is that what's happening is with with it
[691.36 - 696.48] it's an adrenaline response is what
[693.44 - 698.56] occurs so when you get stung by a bee
[696.48 - 700.64] when you get stung by a bee on your leg
[698.56 - 700.96] or on on your body somewhere and usually
[700.64 - 703.68] with
[700.96 - 704.16] uh with with b therapy when they do this
[703.68 - 706.24] is
[704.16 - 707.20] they you sting the thigh or you sting
[706.24 - 710.72] the knee
[707.20 - 712.64] and in the arm too but but what happens
[710.72 - 715.28] is it prompts the adrenals
[712.64 - 716.96] to flood so instantly your adrenals are
[715.28 - 719.36] flooding and flooding and flooding it's
[716.96 - 721.60] it's a it's a serious adrenal surge
[719.36 - 722.96] when you get stung by a bee adrenaline
[721.60 - 725.28] is pouring in
[722.96 - 727.36] just from your adrenals okay and so when
[725.28 - 730.16] that's happening you guys
[727.36 - 732.32] what you do is you get steroid relief so
[730.16 - 734.72] you're getting steroidal relief
[732.32 - 737.04] so that's how the therapy works so when
[734.72 - 739.28] you have neurological conditions
[737.04 - 740.64] like any kind of neurological condition
[739.28 - 744.00] you have aches and pains
[740.64 - 746.32] tingles and numbness ticks and spasms
[744.00 - 747.36] you know like you you know uh limb
[746.32 - 748.96] weaknesses
[747.36 - 751.20] you know people with multiple sclerosis
[748.96 - 752.72] or they have ms or they have als or they
[751.20 - 753.04] have other kind of condition whatever it
[752.72 - 755.12] is
[753.04 - 756.72] and they're doing the bee sting therapy
[755.12 - 759.92] it's prompting their adrenals
[756.72 - 760.80] their self-treating themselves with with
[759.92 - 763.36] steroids
[760.80 - 765.20] they're using their own steroid to treat
[763.36 - 766.64] their condition now what i don't like
[765.20 - 770.00] about this
[766.64 - 773.12] is that the adrenaline is corrosive
[770.00 - 774.64] and it's it's agitating so we have
[773.12 - 776.64] somebody with multiple sclerosis or
[774.64 - 778.56] somebody with a neurological condition
[776.64 - 780.56] that the doctors don't know why they're
[778.56 - 781.76] sick medical research and science
[780.56 - 782.88] doesn't know why people are sick they
[781.76 - 784.48] don't have answers
[782.88 - 786.48] if you want to know why people are sick
[784.48 - 787.84] well these autoimmune conditions you
[786.48 - 789.60] get cleansing heal so you can read the
[787.84 - 790.88] true causes medical medium information
[789.60 - 792.16] this only source that has that
[790.88 - 793.92] information out there
[792.16 - 796.48] other than that everywhere else is just
[793.92 - 800.16] a game of like a cryptic game of
[796.48 - 802.48] nonsense but anyway the bottom line is
[800.16 - 804.88] that when your adrenals are flooding
[802.48 - 807.44] because you're doing bee sting therapy
[804.88 - 808.48] you're self-treating using your own
[807.44 - 811.60] adrenaline
[808.48 - 813.12] as a rush as a steroid
[811.60 - 814.64] and then what it does is it gives you
[813.12 - 816.56] relief it's the same thing with
[814.64 - 818.08] like the same thing with some other
[816.56 - 819.76] things that occur now
[818.08 - 821.36] um it could be a temporary fix but
[819.76 - 823.04] you'll notice with neurological
[821.36 - 825.12] conditions it's only temporary
[823.04 - 827.20] it only the relief only lasts for an
[825.12 - 829.92] hour or half a day
[827.20 - 830.48] or a quarter of a day or a day or two
[829.92 - 832.08] days
[830.48 - 834.24] depending on how much adrenaline was
[832.08 - 835.52] released and so if you had a lot of
[834.24 - 837.68] adrenaline released
[835.52 - 838.80] i noticed that bee sting therapy when
[837.68 - 840.96] you first get it
[838.80 - 842.72] gives you some relief because a lot of
[840.96 - 843.76] adrenaline gets released but on your
[842.72 - 846.72] 10th therapy
[843.76 - 848.72] or your 50th bee sting you don't get the
[846.72 - 850.88] response is the same and you need more
[848.72 - 853.44] bee stings and you need more bee stings
[850.88 - 855.28] i'm not a fan of it i don't recommend it
[853.44 - 857.60] i don't recommend bee sting therapy
[855.28 - 859.04] i never did and i'm not a fan of it um
[857.60 - 860.64] but that's that's what i know about it
[859.04 - 863.76] if it helps
[860.64 - 865.20] anna gosh i started to drink a little a
[863.76 - 867.20] little of coffee again
[865.20 - 868.72] and my alopecia started to get worse but
[867.20 - 871.36] i didn't see the link i
[868.72 - 872.56] you know it's incredible that you you
[871.36 - 873.76] understand this now
[872.56 - 875.76] because of the medical medium
[873.76 - 877.04] information about that but that's what
[875.76 - 880.08] it does it's it's the
[877.04 - 882.24] the industry actually is training
[880.08 - 883.28] women to be addicted to the to the
[882.24 - 885.60] caffeine
[883.28 - 886.80] the caffeine kills women's adrenals and
[885.60 - 888.80] nobody cares
[886.80 - 890.00] nobody cares and then you get these like
[888.80 - 891.44] fake doctors that
[890.00 - 893.36] that have their podcast and they're just
[891.44 - 895.44] like oh yeah matcha tea is great it's
[893.36 - 897.28] got healing benefits and it's got
[895.44 - 899.04] oh you know it's like you know your
[897.28 - 900.56] dummy you know it's like
[899.04 - 902.80] you don't get it you want to keep women
[900.56 - 904.24] addicted too and then they just burn out
[902.80 - 905.52] their adrenals and then when it's
[904.24 - 907.44] pregnancy time
[905.52 - 908.96] you don't have it here's the here's what
[907.44 - 913.20] caffeine does
[908.96 - 916.32] caffeine um makes pregnancies
[913.20 - 917.28] harder and makes birth burn giving birth
[916.32 - 920.48] harder
[917.28 - 921.52] because you blow out your adrenals early
[920.48 - 924.40] on in your life
[921.52 - 925.28] and then then you get pregnant and then
[924.40 - 927.28] you have a baby
[925.28 - 929.20] and you in in the giving birth process
[927.28 - 930.16] is much harder because your adrenals are
[929.20 - 932.96] maxed out
[930.16 - 934.00] and sometimes shot from coffee and all
[932.96 - 935.28] that and this is medical medium
[934.00 - 936.80] information nowhere else is this
[935.28 - 938.16] information like all the information on
[936.80 - 939.28] here if you're new here it's all medical
[938.16 - 940.72] medium information
[939.28 - 942.32] it's not somewhere else it's not
[940.72 - 942.96] somewhere at so-and-so's it's not
[942.32 - 944.64] wherever
[942.96 - 945.84] and if it is they took little tidbits
[944.64 - 947.44] and didn't incite it back to medical
[945.84 - 950.24] medium information
[947.44 - 952.56] um cindy after eight years of whole
[950.24 - 955.52] foods and clean eating
[952.56 - 956.08] i cannot lose weight i need help losing
[955.52 - 958.48] weight
[956.08 - 959.20] 30 pounds to get me back to pre-baby
[958.48 - 960.80] weight
[959.20 - 962.16] and i have autoimmune issues please
[960.80 - 964.00] please please help the first thing is
[962.16 - 965.92] autoimmune issues you can go to the
[964.00 - 967.44] autoimmune section and cleanse the heal
[965.92 - 969.20] and you can see back there
[967.44 - 970.64] and you can see there's a protocol you
[969.20 - 972.48] could take that protocol to your doctor
[970.64 - 973.76] or practitioner if you want or just work
[972.48 - 974.80] with it if you want to do
[973.76 - 976.64] and you'll see there are different
[974.80 - 978.08] supplements what to do take it slow one
[976.64 - 981.12] little thing at a time but what you
[978.08 - 982.08] learn is what was your autoimmune
[981.12 - 984.32] disease name
[982.08 - 986.00] that a doctor gave you too and you can
[984.32 - 987.68] just go straight into autoimmune or you
[986.00 - 988.16] can find that name specifically in the
[987.68 - 991.28] book
[988.16 - 991.76] but the point is is that what they don't
[991.28 - 994.40] know
[991.76 - 995.36] is what's behind autoimmune is a viral
[994.40 - 997.04] condition and
[995.36 - 999.44] i talk to doctors about this all the
[997.04 - 1001.44] time and you know and i teach doctors
[999.44 - 1002.96] this information if it's classified
[1001.44 - 1005.20] under autoimmune
[1002.96 - 1007.04] that's a viral issue and where do
[1005.20 - 1009.20] viruses go and where are they
[1007.04 - 1010.16] throughout a person's lifetime inside
[1009.20 - 1011.84] their liver
[1010.16 - 1014.32] and their liver gets stagnant and
[1011.84 - 1015.36] sluggish and has this viral these viral
[1014.32 - 1016.72] issues in there
[1015.36 - 1018.72] and then when it gets stagnant and
[1016.72 - 1020.32] sluggish and you can eat clean
[1018.72 - 1022.40] you can eat whole foods your whole life
[1020.32 - 1022.96] but it's not fixing the problem what i
[1022.40 - 1024.40] would
[1022.96 - 1025.76] what i would do is i would look in i
[1024.40 - 1026.96] would go to the library get the book for
[1025.76 - 1029.92] free if you want or
[1026.96 - 1031.12] on sale at amazon right now and an
[1029.92 - 1033.04] amazing sale actually
[1031.12 - 1034.80] and what i would do is i would look at
[1033.04 - 1038.00] the 369 cleanse
[1034.80 - 1040.48] maybe the 369 advance cleanse maybe
[1038.00 - 1042.48] the mono eating cleanse one of the mono
[1040.48 - 1045.68] eating cleanses take your time to look
[1042.48 - 1047.28] and what you're doing is first of all
[1045.68 - 1049.36] you're getting rid of fats what i would
[1047.28 - 1051.04] do if i was somebody that was battling
[1049.36 - 1053.44] weight for many years
[1051.04 - 1054.88] i would bring down those fats bring them
[1053.44 - 1056.88] down in the diet you can learn about
[1054.88 - 1057.92] that in here give your liver a chance to
[1056.88 - 1059.76] recover
[1057.92 - 1061.20] and clean things up and if you got the
[1059.76 - 1064.16] autoimmune issue learn
[1061.20 - 1066.80] what the causes of that issue learn what
[1064.16 - 1069.68] viral issue with viruses responsible
[1066.80 - 1071.12] for your autoimmune problem so then you
[1069.68 - 1072.64] can take action
[1071.12 - 1074.40] start getting the liver better start
[1072.64 - 1076.88] lowering the viral uh
[1074.40 - 1078.32] load start dropping the viral issue down
[1076.88 - 1080.40] and boom all of a sudden the weight
[1078.32 - 1081.60] starts coming off maybe did 369
[1080.40 - 1082.32] periodically just give me any
[1081.60 - 1084.80] suggestions
[1082.32 - 1086.24] are you doing lemon water 32 ounces of
[1084.80 - 1088.08] lemon water every morning
[1086.24 - 1090.32] that's something to consider are you
[1088.08 - 1091.04] doing 32 ounces of celery juice every
[1090.32 - 1093.60] morning
[1091.04 - 1095.76] are you keeping fats down throughout the
[1093.60 - 1097.68] morning maybe do the morning cleanse
[1095.76 - 1100.24] all these things matter you can get
[1097.68 - 1104.80] weight off you can

[1116.80 - 1123.52] um so
[1120.16 - 1125.60] manic mike uh monique my my daughter
[1123.52 - 1127.52] is suffering from chronic headaches and
[1125.60 - 1129.60] blurry eyes with burning
[1127.52 - 1131.92] so chronic headaches and blurry eyes
[1129.60 - 1133.84] with burning stabbing pain for
[1131.92 - 1135.44] past few months which book is best for
[1133.84 - 1137.20] healing um
[1135.44 - 1139.36] so when it comes to chronic headaches
[1137.20 - 1141.04] you can
[1139.36 - 1142.64] you can look at the headache section
[1141.04 - 1143.44] right here so if you look at cleanse the
[1142.64 - 1145.04] heel
[1143.44 - 1146.48] what i like about cleanse the heel it's
[1145.04 - 1148.84] so comprehensive
[1146.48 - 1151.52] there's so much information to customize
[1148.84 - 1154.24] protocols take the book to the doctor
[1151.52 - 1155.68] to your pediatrician or to to you know
[1154.24 - 1157.28] whoever your caregiver is for your
[1155.68 - 1159.76] daughter to and show the book
[1157.28 - 1160.96] but headaches um and migraines that
[1159.76 - 1162.80] little section it talks about
[1160.96 - 1163.76] supplements and dosages that's one thing
[1162.80 - 1165.44] you can do
[1163.76 - 1166.96] the other thing is you got all the
[1165.44 - 1169.12] different cleanses
[1166.96 - 1170.08] what i would do okay if she was my
[1169.12 - 1172.96] daughter i would
[1170.08 - 1175.12] i would be focused on toxic heavy metals
[1172.96 - 1177.52] maybe do the heavy metal detox smoothie
[1175.12 - 1179.52] heavy metal detox cleanse in here i
[1177.52 - 1181.04] would consider that as a possibility i
[1179.52 - 1181.92] would look at the headache section in
[1181.04 - 1184.08] the back
[1181.92 - 1185.12] and you don't have to jump right in you
[1184.08 - 1187.12] can just do
[1185.12 - 1189.20] 16 ounces of celery juice in the morning
[1187.12 - 1190.80] on an empty stomach every morning that's
[1189.20 - 1191.76] all you have to do just start with that
[1190.80 - 1194.24] some lemon water
[1191.76 - 1197.92] and you take it from there slow and and
[1194.24 - 1197.92] you can just take one step at a time
[1201.28 - 1204.48] how can i speed up the healing so i
[1203.20 - 1206.80] don't get bloated
[1204.48 - 1207.92] at all anymore so what happens with the
[1206.80 - 1211.52] bloating
[1207.92 - 1212.72] um jubilee is that um
[1211.52 - 1214.88] there's a couple things you're doing
[1212.72 - 1215.84] like what are you doing like what are
[1214.88 - 1217.04] your foods
[1215.84 - 1218.32] you're staying away from the dairy
[1217.04 - 1219.92] products staying away from the eggs
[1218.32 - 1221.44] right staying away from the gluten those
[1219.92 - 1224.16] three are so important
[1221.44 - 1225.60] because bloating for many people and i
[1224.16 - 1227.52] talk about it in the books
[1225.60 - 1228.96] is the streptococcus bacteria that sits
[1227.52 - 1232.48] inside the intestinal tract
[1228.96 - 1234.00] okay and that coupled with low hcl so
[1232.48 - 1235.84] the gastric glands get burned out
[1234.00 - 1237.04] another thing back to the caffeine thing
[1235.84 - 1238.16] for one second
[1237.04 - 1239.92] well that's another thing all the
[1238.16 - 1241.04] caffeine beverages do when the chocolate
[1239.92 - 1242.88] does the caffeine
[1241.04 - 1244.80] it burns out the stomach glands so then
[1242.88 - 1246.48] you get bloating later on in life that's
[1244.80 - 1247.36] another thing too so not only do women
[1246.48 - 1250.08] get their hair loose
[1247.36 - 1250.72] lost later on they get their adrenals
[1250.08 - 1252.96] get shot
[1250.72 - 1255.28] so they have difficulty giving birth
[1252.96 - 1256.96] they get bloating later on down the road
[1255.28 - 1258.00] i mean the caffeine industry just does a
[1256.96 - 1261.20] number on women
[1258.00 - 1263.68] it's it's despicable really
[1261.20 - 1265.20] but you want to get the hcl the stomach
[1263.68 - 1266.32] glands build up you want to get your
[1265.20 - 1268.64] liver bile function
[1266.32 - 1270.32] better it sounds like it's hard but no i
[1268.64 - 1271.92] mean you can literally just take cleanse
[1270.32 - 1274.00] of heal look at the liver section there
[1271.92 - 1277.60] work on getting that going on there
[1274.00 - 1281.84] um and
[1277.60 - 1282.56] so ann margaret um oh my i am a clinical
[1281.84 - 1285.92] nutritionist
[1282.56 - 1286.40] amazing and i cannot believe what i am
[1285.92 - 1289.84] seeing
[1286.40 - 1291.92] all these questions on things don't work
[1289.84 - 1293.28] on all these questions on things don't
[1291.92 - 1295.68] work so many of this not
[1293.28 - 1298.24] evidence-based folks be careful oh
[1295.68 - 1301.76] really really good question right there
[1298.24 - 1303.28] um so you know
[1301.76 - 1305.04] did you do you don't think any of the
[1303.28 - 1306.32] folks here went to two three four five
[1305.04 - 1308.56] doctors
[1306.32 - 1309.92] um doctors not just clinical
[1308.56 - 1311.84] nutritionists but actual
[1309.92 - 1312.96] specialists and neurologists and medical
[1311.84 - 1314.80] doctors
[1312.96 - 1316.00] that's one thing ann i wanna i wanna ask
[1314.80 - 1317.20] you so i wanna ask you a couple
[1316.00 - 1318.88] questions because
[1317.20 - 1320.88] a lot of people most people the medical
[1318.88 - 1321.36] medium community they've actually been
[1320.88 - 1324.64] through
[1321.36 - 1327.44] 20 doctors and three specialists
[1324.64 - 1329.04] three neurologists psychiatrists because
[1327.44 - 1329.52] they get told to go to there for for
[1329.04 - 1331.12] things
[1329.52 - 1333.28] because their neurological symptoms are
[1331.12 - 1334.72] driving them crazy and
[1333.28 - 1336.56] all of that and they've seen also
[1334.72 - 1337.44] nutritionists and they tried different
[1336.56 - 1340.40] things and
[1337.44 - 1341.68] i think that insults people so it's not
[1340.40 - 1343.76] going to insult me
[1341.68 - 1345.36] i like you saying that because it gives
[1343.76 - 1346.40] me a chance to just talk about the topic
[1345.36 - 1350.40] in general
[1346.40 - 1353.76] and but you're insulting people who
[1350.40 - 1355.92] they're not stupid so and um people
[1353.76 - 1356.88] go to doctors and they've been to a lot
[1355.92 - 1358.24] of doctors
[1356.88 - 1360.24] and they're still stuck with all their
[1358.24 - 1361.84] different symptoms and conditions
[1360.24 - 1363.52] so and they're suffering and they're
[1361.84 - 1366.16] struggling so i would say ann
[1363.52 - 1367.04] have some respect and they've seen their
[1366.16 - 1368.88] nutritionists
[1367.04 - 1370.88] and they've seen their health coaches so
[1368.88 - 1373.36] i would just say
[1370.88 - 1374.56] consider them and maybe not just think
[1373.36 - 1378.00] about yourself
[1374.56 - 1380.00] and think about me kind of what i do is
[1378.00 - 1381.36] i'm thinking about them so i'm thinking
[1380.00 - 1382.80] of the person who's suffering with the
[1381.36 - 1384.24] worst trigeminal neuralgia where they
[1382.80 - 1386.16] want to kill themselves
[1384.24 - 1387.52] okay i'm thinking about the 20 year old
[1386.16 - 1388.80] who can't go to college
[1387.52 - 1390.80] and can't even look at the computer
[1388.80 - 1392.88] screen because she can't
[1390.80 - 1394.40] see properly because she has brain fog
[1392.88 - 1397.04] and blurry eyes
[1394.40 - 1397.60] i worry about and fatigue and she's and
[1397.04 - 1400.64] her mom
[1397.60 - 1402.72] has taken her already to 20 doctors
[1400.64 - 1404.08] i'm worried about them and i'm worried
[1402.72 - 1405.52] about the people who have
[1404.08 - 1406.88] you know who can't get into a car
[1405.52 - 1408.48] because their anxiety is so bad they
[1406.88 - 1409.12] have a seizure before they get to their
[1408.48 - 1411.04] car
[1409.12 - 1412.56] and they can't even leave the house um i
[1411.04 - 1413.36] worry about the people that are going
[1412.56 - 1415.28] through all this
[1413.36 - 1416.56] and the thousand and and here's in the
[1415.28 - 1418.24] thousands and thousands of people that
[1416.56 - 1420.16] are going through this
[1418.24 - 1421.76] so and what i would do is instead of
[1420.16 - 1424.88] being concerned about
[1421.76 - 1426.16] your credentials and my no credentials
[1424.88 - 1428.96] okay because i never said it was a
[1426.16 - 1430.24] doctor be concerned about all the people
[1428.96 - 1433.20] that can't find answers in their
[1430.24 - 1435.04] suffering and then be open-minded to the
[1433.20 - 1436.88] thousands of healing stories
[1435.04 - 1438.08] that medical medium information is
[1436.88 - 1439.68] brought and
[1438.08 - 1441.44] and think about the street cred if you
[1439.68 - 1441.84] look at the gold level label on this
[1441.44 - 1444.96] book
[1441.84 - 1447.92] okay you won't see that gold label on
[1444.96 - 1448.80] um other books in health and and if you
[1447.92 - 1450.64] look at the gold
[1448.80 - 1452.16] label it says millions of copies sold in
[1450.64 - 1454.24] the medical medium series
[1452.16 - 1456.24] worldwide millions of copies and
[1454.24 - 1459.28] millions of people with the street cred
[1456.24 - 1460.96] and have reported that millions have
[1459.28 - 1462.80] been healing and healed of medical
[1460.96 - 1465.28] medium books so
[1462.80 - 1466.64] i i'm just saying i hope you're doing
[1465.28 - 1468.16] good with your doing and the work you're
[1466.64 - 1470.72] doing in your practice
[1468.16 - 1472.16] but just so you know i'm about to sick
[1470.72 - 1475.04] and the suffering and people who
[1472.16 - 1475.04] can't get answers
[1475.60 - 1480.00] kelsey would like help understanding why
[1478.16 - 1483.28] i get debilitating panic attacks
[1480.00 - 1486.24] randomly triggered by fear or not
[1483.28 - 1488.48] um being able to sleep once i start a
[1486.24 - 1489.04] panic attack then it's nearly impossible
[1488.48 - 1490.32] to stop
[1489.04 - 1492.72] without taking conventional
[1490.32 - 1495.44] pharmaceuticals i've been healing with
[1492.72 - 1496.00] mm for two years and i got the panic
[1495.44 - 1497.76] attack
[1496.00 - 1500.08] and i got the panic attack shortly after
[1497.76 - 1503.44] trying the advanced 369
[1500.08 - 1504.40] for two days was off b12 for two months
[1503.44 - 1507.28] recently
[1504.40 - 1507.92] maybe that could be related so a couple
[1507.28 - 1511.12] of things too
[1507.92 - 1514.88] so um you get debilitating panic attacks
[1511.12 - 1516.24] they're triggered and and been nearly
[1514.88 - 1518.40] impossible to stop without taking
[1516.24 - 1520.08] conventional pharmaceuticals so
[1518.40 - 1522.64] the thing is with panic attacks is
[1520.08 - 1524.88] that's with panic attacks and anxiety
[1522.64 - 1526.88] you get all that is your trigeminal
[1524.88 - 1529.44] nerve stuff so phrenic nerves trigeminal
[1526.88 - 1531.12] nerve you got your you got your um
[1529.44 - 1532.88] trigeminal nerve you got your phrenic
[1531.12 - 1534.88] nerves you got your vagus nerve
[1532.88 - 1536.88] so all those nerves work together so
[1534.88 - 1538.56] they're all part of panic attacks vagus
[1536.88 - 1539.28] nerve is the big one for panic attacks
[1538.56 - 1541.36] right there
[1539.28 - 1543.92] all on its own and so what happens is
[1541.36 - 1545.76] that nerves get inflamed
[1543.92 - 1548.00] and they get hypersensitive and when
[1545.76 - 1550.24] they get hypersensitive
[1548.00 - 1551.92] then you know you can be susceptible to
[1550.24 - 1555.68] a panic attack at any point
[1551.92 - 1557.44] any time and and fear can trigger one
[1555.68 - 1559.60] at any moment i know when people have
[1557.44 - 1562.72] severe anxiety and they got
[1559.60 - 1563.92] they got um they're very sensitive they
[1562.72 - 1566.48] can have a panic attack
[1563.92 - 1568.56] really easily anything can trigger it it
[1566.48 - 1570.96] could even be trying something new
[1568.56 - 1572.72] i've seen people try something new for
[1570.96 - 1573.92] the first time no matter what that is
[1572.72 - 1576.00] i've seen people say well i'm going to
[1573.92 - 1577.68] try coconut oil but i never tried it
[1576.00 - 1579.12] before let me try it they have a panic
[1577.68 - 1581.68] attack as they're trying it
[1579.12 - 1582.88] or someone who's trying something new or
[1581.68 - 1584.32] someone who's trying even a new
[1582.88 - 1585.12] pharmaceutical they have a panic attack
[1584.32 - 1586.24] while they're trying a new
[1585.12 - 1589.12] pharmaceutical
[1586.24 - 1590.12] and what happens is when the vagus nerve
[1589.12 - 1592.32] gets so
[1590.12 - 1593.92] hypersensitive and you end up getting
[1592.32 - 1595.92] ptsd because of it
[1593.92 - 1598.00] so you end up getting the whole ptsd
[1595.92 - 1599.92] issue then we we run
[1598.00 - 1602.24] into trouble so then it's like a vicious
[1599.92 - 1603.92] cycle we got the hypersensitive nerves
[1602.24 - 1604.80] the vagus nerve and phrenic nerves and
[1603.92 - 1607.60] then
[1604.80 - 1608.64] we have the ptsd associated with it
[1607.60 - 1610.64] because then we get
[1608.64 - 1612.56] we it just it turns into a vicious cycle
[1610.64 - 1614.40] it's so hard for people and i'm so sorry
[1612.56 - 1615.92] you're suffering with that and all that
[1614.40 - 1617.44] so if you go into the book if you go
[1615.92 - 1618.80] into medical medium you can take the
[1617.44 - 1620.88] book to your doctor you'll see that
[1618.80 - 1624.56] there's an anxiety section there
[1620.88 - 1627.84] and that's a great place to start and
[1624.56 - 1631.20] um and another thing too is
[1627.84 - 1632.88] is that with anxiety you can also have a
[1631.20 - 1633.76] low-grade viral infection with toxic
[1632.88 - 1636.40] heavy metals
[1633.76 - 1638.00] creating that inflammation with the
[1636.40 - 1639.44] vagus turbine phrenic nerve so with the
[1638.00 - 1640.00] vagus nerve and phrenic nerves you can
[1639.44 - 1641.84] have
[1640.00 - 1643.20] the toxic heavy metals mercury's the big
[1641.84 - 1645.44] one so
[1643.20 - 1647.36] mercury is definitely the big one with
[1645.44 - 1649.60] anxiety that's a huge
[1647.36 - 1650.72] huge piece of a lot of people's
[1649.60 - 1652.72] anxieties
[1650.72 - 1654.32] and then anxiety conditions and then the
[1652.72 - 1655.04] other things low-grade virus is like the
[1654.32 - 1656.96] epstein-barr
[1655.04 - 1658.08] what happens is epstein-barr tends to
[1656.96 - 1660.08] feed off of mercury
[1658.08 - 1662.08] tends to release a neurotoxin the
[1660.08 - 1664.48] neurotoxin floats around
[1662.08 - 1666.24] it saturates itself on a nerve once it
[1664.48 - 1668.16] saturates itself on a nerve like
[1666.24 - 1669.92] like a vagus nerve or phrenic nerves
[1668.16 - 1673.28] they get hypersensitive
[1669.92 - 1675.04] and then we have a panic attack so if i
[1673.28 - 1676.24] had anxiety i'd be in the anxiety
[1675.04 - 1678.88] section i
[1676.24 - 1679.76] there's so many ways to go about it what
[1678.88 - 1682.08] i would do
[1679.76 - 1683.84] is i would do the model eating cleanse
[1682.08 - 1687.44] that's what i would do something really
[1683.84 - 1688.64] simple because um when it's simple and
[1687.44 - 1690.40] basic like that
[1688.64 - 1692.48] and you keep your fats low and you're
[1690.40 - 1694.80] doing the mono eating cleanse
[1692.48 - 1696.72] like the potato monowing cleanse of the
[1694.80 - 1699.20] celery juice and then you have
[1696.72 - 1700.80] then you have the steamed potatoes and
[1699.20 - 1702.56] then you have the smoothie and so forth
[1700.80 - 1704.64] and the lemon water and
[1702.56 - 1706.16] and when you do you know when you do
[1704.64 - 1707.52] that kind of thing
[1706.16 - 1710.16] when you're doing like the moderating
[1707.52 - 1712.16] cleanse it's so easy and gentle on
[1710.16 - 1714.24] sensitive nerves and that's what i would
[1712.16 - 1716.16] recommend for myself if i had anxiety or
[1714.24 - 1717.76] a friend or a loved one had that
[1716.16 - 1719.20] go to your doctor ask them what they
[1717.76 - 1722.32] think about the book
[1719.20 - 1724.88] and and i don't know what you have been
[1722.32 - 1726.96] doing for the last couple years or so
[1724.88 - 1728.56] you know and what's happening so i don't
[1726.96 - 1730.24] know like what what you've been up to in
[1728.56 - 1732.16] the last two three years what you're
[1730.24 - 1733.68] eating what you're not eating
[1732.16 - 1735.36] all of these things play a role if you
[1733.68 - 1737.44] do nutritional yeast that's it
[1735.36 - 1739.44] that could really really build up in
[1737.44 - 1740.88] your system with all that msg
[1739.44 - 1742.88] create a lot of anxiety because the
[1740.88 - 1744.96] nerves can't handle msg
[1742.88 - 1746.08] um you could also you know there's also
[1744.96 - 1748.40] different bugs we we
[1746.08 - 1749.68] share and we pick up and and you know we
[1748.40 - 1752.24] we just end up
[1749.68 - 1754.00] in contact with that along the way but
[1752.24 - 1755.76] what i but i what i would recommend with
[1754.00 - 1757.60] anxiety you see the anxiety section
[1755.76 - 1759.28] take a look at the supplements you can
[1757.60 - 1759.92] customize it for yourself you can talk
[1759.28 - 1762.16] to your
[1759.92 - 1762.96] doctor about it too and a little bit at
[1762.16 - 1765.04] a time
[1762.96 - 1766.72] maybe do a mono eating cleanse 369
[1765.04 - 1768.48] cleanse is still amazing for that of
[1766.72 - 1770.88] course a lot of people heal
[1768.48 - 1772.00] that from another thing too you know
[1770.88 - 1775.60] when you're doing
[1772.00 - 1778.32] something new did you know
[1775.60 - 1779.44] it's coming out of it what are you going
[1778.32 - 1781.76] back to
[1779.44 - 1782.72] to eating something to where you used to
[1781.76 - 1785.04] eat are you
[1782.72 - 1786.56] what are you doing forging ahead and all
[1785.04 - 1787.68] these things matter i talk about it in
[1786.56 - 1791.44] detail here
[1787.68 - 1792.40] but for anxiety though i talk about what
[1791.44 - 1795.36] supplements
[1792.40 - 1796.80] what is that are really critical you can
[1795.36 - 1799.84] customize your protocol
[1796.80 - 1801.28] for it i talk about the heavy metals um
[1799.84 - 1803.04] another thing too you can just do the
[1801.28 - 1804.96] heavy metal detox cleanse
[1803.04 - 1806.64] so that's another thing i was talking to
[1804.96 - 1808.64] a doctor a couple of weeks ago
[1806.64 - 1810.56] this doctor's all about anxiety just
[1808.64 - 1813.12] nothing about anxiety just nothing else
[1810.56 - 1814.64] all about anxiety panic attacks and
[1813.12 - 1816.72] different rides of anxiety and
[1814.64 - 1818.48] they're really intrigued and invested in
[1816.72 - 1819.44] the medical medium information and they
[1818.48 - 1820.56] want to learn
[1819.44 - 1822.64] and they were saying you know what
[1820.56 - 1824.24] what's really helping with my patients
[1822.64 - 1826.56] they were telling me is the heavy metal
[1824.24 - 1828.40] detox cleanse because i told this doctor
[1826.56 - 1830.16] toxic heavy metals like mercury
[1828.40 - 1832.00] are responsible for so many anxiety
[1830.16 - 1834.08] cases and
[1832.00 - 1835.84] his doctor said it's doing wonders for
[1834.08 - 1837.52] so many different cases of anxiety and
[1835.84 - 1840.80] panic and everything else so maybe that
[1837.52 - 1840.80] would be helpful too information
[1847.84 - 1851.28] okay here's the question here please i
[1849.44 - 1853.36] pray you could talk about numbness in
[1851.28 - 1857.04] body from insect bites like spiders
[1853.36 - 1860.40] absolutely terrified um if you
[1857.04 - 1862.56] did you have it a spider bite did you
[1860.40 - 1864.00] have one i mean i know the black widow
[1862.56 - 1866.64] can cause
[1864.00 - 1868.24] full body paralysis if it's not taken
[1866.64 - 1869.52] care of if you don't get emergency
[1868.24 - 1871.52] medical attention
[1869.52 - 1873.36] or or medical attention you know black
[1871.52 - 1876.08] widow spider can be really annoying
[1873.36 - 1877.20] and and cause that you know when you do
[1876.08 - 1878.72] get bit over time
[1877.20 - 1880.08] the brown will wreck loose is really
[1878.72 - 1881.52] annoying too these these fighters are
[1880.08 - 1882.64] annoying i mean were you diagnosed with
[1881.52 - 1885.44] a spider bite
[1882.64 - 1887.04] was it an official spider bite or are
[1885.44 - 1888.80] you just getting numbness in the body
[1887.04 - 1890.08] and nobody knows but you thought you had
[1888.80 - 1890.88] a bite like there's so many different
[1890.08 - 1892.64] avenues and
[1890.88 - 1894.32] i'm not trying to insult you at all or
[1892.64 - 1896.08] throw you off that's not it you might
[1894.32 - 1897.12] have got you might even seen this by
[1896.08 - 1899.44] spider bite you
[1897.12 - 1900.56] and then and then the doctor said yes
[1899.44 - 1902.88] you had a
[1900.56 - 1904.80] a brown recluse spider by yes you had a
[1902.88 - 1906.72] black widow spider bite yes you had a
[1904.80 - 1909.76] wolf spider bite
[1906.72 - 1912.00] so that's one thing there but spider
[1909.76 - 1914.72] bites yeah they can be really annoying
[1912.00 - 1916.80] they haven't they have a neurotoxic
[1914.72 - 1919.28] effect so you get numbness
[1916.80 - 1920.00] that could last for years or just last
[1919.28 - 1922.08] for the moment
[1920.00 - 1923.36] you get numbness because of neurotoxins
[1922.08 - 1926.56] because spider bite venom
[1923.36 - 1927.52] is neurotoxic to some degree in a lot of
[1926.56 - 1929.12] cases so
[1927.52 - 1930.64] meaning like to some people they're not
[1929.12 - 1932.16] that sensitive some people are more
[1930.64 - 1934.08] sensitive i've seen people get spider
[1932.16 - 1936.00] bites it's like it didn't even happen i
[1934.08 - 1937.68] i got a friend who can have a black
[1936.00 - 1939.68] widow bite their hand and
[1937.68 - 1941.44] they're just aggravated for a week and
[1939.68 - 1942.48] then it's gone but but no but it's
[1941.44 - 1946.00] serious stuff
[1942.48 - 1947.52] and but numbness you know it's
[1946.00 - 1949.04] no matter what the trigger was say it
[1947.52 - 1950.40] was a spider bite then i would go into
[1949.04 - 1952.08] tingles and numbness neurological
[1950.40 - 1954.24] symptoms and cleanse the heal
[1952.08 - 1956.32] because you got sensitive nerves i would
[1954.24 - 1957.60] go into neurological symptoms take a
[1956.32 - 1958.64] look talk to your doctor
[1957.60 - 1960.64] you can take a look at the different
[1958.64 - 1963.28] supplements to help with it
[1960.64 - 1964.08] maybe focus on the foods i would i would
[1963.28 - 1966.56] focus on
[1964.08 - 1967.60] um maybe the anti-bug cleanse and so
[1966.56 - 1971.52] forth in the book
[1967.60 - 1971.52] but yeah there's but i understand
[1972.16 - 1977.60] danielle says i healed my severe anxiety
[1975.28 - 1979.28] and panic attacks thanks to mm danielle
[1977.60 - 1980.48] that's really inspiring for anybody with
[1979.28 - 1983.84] panic attacks
[1980.48 - 1986.80] anybody going through so much um
[1983.84 - 1987.28] you know all that that's michelle just
[1986.80 - 1989.20] said
[1987.28 - 1990.56] that's a really that was a really good
[1989.20 - 1993.12] one for michelle right there
[1990.56 - 1994.48] we have soc no bogus studies here well
[1993.12 - 1995.04] you know what michelle you know you're
[1994.48 - 1997.84] not
[1995.04 - 1998.32] you're you're not you're not green at
[1997.84 - 2001.36] this
[1998.32 - 2002.40] okay you know that you can have all the
[2001.36 - 2004.96] studies
[2002.40 - 2006.72] out there all the food studies all the
[2004.96 - 2007.84] whatever studies and you can have all
[2006.72 - 2011.04] that galore
[2007.84 - 2012.48] but there are 250 million people in the
[2011.04 - 2013.44] u.s alone that have symptoms that
[2012.48 - 2015.36] doctors can't
[2013.44 - 2016.48] figure out how to get rid of or they
[2015.36 - 2018.64] can't get rid of
[2016.48 - 2020.32] and and then you get you can there's the
[2018.64 - 2021.44] not so sick with some symptoms and then
[2020.32 - 2024.72] they're really sick
[2021.44 - 2027.52] and they've been to 50 doctors and um
[2024.72 - 2028.64] and with all the studies that you can
[2027.52 - 2030.88] find and do
[2028.64 - 2032.80] so you know this i don't michelle what's
[2030.88 - 2035.36] weird is i don't know why
[2032.80 - 2036.08] it's just some of the people don't know
[2035.36 - 2038.40] this that are
[2036.08 - 2039.92] professionals like how do they not know
[2038.40 - 2041.52] that like is it because they've never
[2039.92 - 2043.20] been sick yet and they just don't
[2041.52 - 2044.64] understand what it's like to be sick so
[2043.20 - 2047.28] they just believe
[2044.64 - 2048.96] in this very land tale that the answers
[2047.28 - 2049.92] are out there i don't know how they can
[2048.96 - 2051.52] do that
[2049.92 - 2053.44] you know you know the difference you
[2051.52 - 2055.44] know what it's like to be sick
[2053.44 - 2056.64] stay sick after 20 doctors and 20
[2055.44 - 2059.44] nutritionists
[2056.64 - 2060.40] and then not have answers until you find
[2059.44 - 2062.56] answers
[2060.40 - 2063.76] but you know what that's like it's the
[2062.56 - 2068.08] bubble people are in
[2063.76 - 2071.92] it's confusing me it still does um
[2068.08 - 2075.12] actually what helps with acid reflux um
[2071.92 - 2076.08] you know first of all i mean you can go
[2075.12 - 2078.80] really simple
[2076.08 - 2079.76] actually you can go so so gentle and
[2078.80 - 2081.68] simple you can
[2079.76 - 2084.16] you can go with eight ounces of celery
[2081.68 - 2086.00] juice just eight ounces of celery juice
[2084.16 - 2087.20] you can do aloe vera and i talk about
[2086.00 - 2088.00] that in here you can do a little bit
[2087.20 - 2090.24] maybe aloe
[2088.00 - 2091.52] water you can just do the aloe water
[2090.24 - 2093.92] where you blend a little bit of the
[2091.52 - 2096.16] inside gel to a fresh aloe leaf
[2093.92 - 2097.68] and i talk about that in here and you
[2096.16 - 2098.72] could do just a little aloe water each
[2097.68 - 2101.44] day and see what
[2098.72 - 2103.04] moves it because what happens is we get
[2101.44 - 2104.64] a little bacteria in our gut
[2103.04 - 2106.72] we get a little bit of that the old
[2104.64 - 2108.72] strep in our system everybody has it
[2106.72 - 2110.64] nobody doesn't have strep we all have it
[2108.72 - 2113.04] and a little bit of strep in my system
[2110.64 - 2114.72] and then you know and then the liver
[2113.04 - 2116.24] gets a little stagnant and sluggish even
[2114.72 - 2119.68] in younger people
[2116.24 - 2121.12] um stomach glands get get tired even in
[2119.68 - 2121.68] younger people all these different
[2121.12 - 2124.48] things
[2121.68 - 2126.16] but it's really simple as like okay let
[2124.48 - 2127.28] me just start out with maybe a little
[2126.16 - 2129.68] bit of celery juice
[2127.28 - 2131.44] eight ounces maybe start out with 16
[2129.68 - 2134.08] ounces which would be ideal
[2131.44 - 2135.76] every single morning 16 ounces of celery
[2134.08 - 2138.48] juice on an empty stomach
[2135.76 - 2140.00] and take it from there one day at a time
[2138.48 - 2141.04] and talk to your practitioner tell them
[2140.00 - 2143.52] what you're doing
[2141.04 - 2146.08] but that's something just to start with
[2143.52 - 2148.40] and do a little bit of aloe water and
[2146.08 - 2150.48] you don't you know and and of course
[2148.40 - 2150.96] stay away from processed foods of course
[2150.48 - 2154.32] i mean
[2150.96 - 2158.32] everybody's doing that right now but
[2154.32 - 2162.80] um but yeah so
[2158.32 - 2165.52] me tube 787 i have been to over 25
[2162.80 - 2166.72] doctors and spent tens of thousands of
[2165.52 - 2170.48] dollars over the past
[2166.72 - 2172.40] 17 years and i'm now and i'm now i'm
[2170.48 - 2173.68] finally healing thanks to medical medium
[2172.40 - 2176.64] information thank you
[2173.68 - 2178.00] so me tube i'm a monitor here i'm
[2176.64 - 2178.72] honored you found the medical medium
[2178.00 - 2180.72] information
[2178.72 - 2183.44] god bless you i'm so happy i'm proud of
[2180.72 - 2184.40] you 17 years of going through hell and
[2183.44 - 2186.16] back i call it
[2184.40 - 2187.60] hell and back and i caught and now
[2186.16 - 2189.60] you're rising out of the ashes
[2187.60 - 2192.08] that's what that is exactly and what's
[2189.60 - 2195.52] strange youtube is that
[2192.08 - 2197.20] isn't that strange that but yet a couple
[2195.52 - 2198.48] of nutritionists or some dietitian or
[2197.20 - 2200.64] some other doc doesn't know
[2198.48 - 2201.84] like that exists they don't know that
[2200.64 - 2203.36] and that tells me they're just not
[2201.84 - 2204.40] experienced or something and they live
[2203.36 - 2206.88] in a bubble
[2204.40 - 2209.28] but exactly you've been through hell and
[2206.88 - 2212.64] back well that's the world i live in
[2209.28 - 2214.40] i live in the world of 35 years and even
[2212.64 - 2216.00] going back before that with my gift
[2214.40 - 2218.08] of receiving information spirit of
[2216.00 - 2219.04] compassion hearing his voice as of age
[2218.08 - 2220.96] four
[2219.04 - 2222.08] and knowing people suffer that when i
[2220.96 - 2224.80] was age six seven
[2222.08 - 2225.20] eight years old told people suffer every
[2224.80 - 2227.12] day
[2225.20 - 2228.48] from spirit of compassion told how many
[2227.12 - 2230.64] people are suffering
[2228.48 - 2231.92] and how they can't find answers and how
[2230.64 - 2233.52] they're on mattress island
[2231.92 - 2235.60] and some are losing their lives and
[2233.52 - 2236.72] nobody cares and how science research
[2235.60 - 2238.40] doesn't have answers
[2236.72 - 2240.16] i've been taught that by spirit of
[2238.40 - 2243.04] compassion since i was a child
[2240.16 - 2244.80] okay and so it's amazing someone just of
[2243.04 - 2247.04] course wants to discriminate against me
[2244.80 - 2249.04] and step on right on my face and walk on
[2247.04 - 2250.56] over all the people chronic and spit on
[2249.04 - 2252.64] all the people with chronic illness
[2250.56 - 2256.40] it's amazing how it works it's actually
[2252.64 - 2260.64] really sad
[2256.40 - 2260.64] um so
[2261.20 - 2267.44] okay rowan france aloe water considered

[2292.08 - 2295.52] i'm hearing a voice here perfectly clear
[2294.00 - 2297.28] like someone's yelling in my ear or
[2295.52 - 2299.20] talking my ear loud i
[2297.28 - 2301.04] you know it's like having an earpod in
[2299.20 - 2304.40] of of of

[2304.40 - 2308.08] something somebody talking and so i have
[2306.40 - 2311.04] to do that and read comments
[2308.08 - 2313.20] and deliver my information all combined

[2341.28 - 2346.88] incredible i'm proud of all you guys too
[2344.56 - 2350.80] like all you guys are working hard
[2346.88 - 2352.48] um so natasha
[2350.80 - 2354.08] help me prevent migraine during my
[2352.48 - 2356.08] period what can i do
[2354.08 - 2357.68] natasha i'd love to talk about that for
[2356.08 - 2359.84] a second because what happens is the
[2357.68 - 2362.96] reason why the migraines come
[2359.84 - 2366.16] during menstruation is because are
[2362.96 - 2369.28] not our because i'm a man but women's
[2366.16 - 2372.56] immune systems drop all women this isn't
[2369.28 - 2374.64] you but all women's immune systems drop
[2372.56 - 2376.56] eighty percent of their immune system
[2374.64 - 2377.92] goes to the reproductive system so when
[2376.56 - 2380.56] you have your period
[2377.92 - 2383.20] eighty percent of your immune system
[2380.56 - 2385.36] goes to your reproductive system
[2383.20 - 2386.88] to protect it that's that's and that's
[2385.36 - 2387.92] medical medium information it's it's not
[2386.88 - 2389.44] out there you can't google it or
[2387.92 - 2391.52] whatever nobody knows that
[2389.44 - 2393.04] 20 of your immune system is left
[2391.52 - 2394.32] covering the rest of the body
[2393.04 - 2396.80] taking care of everything else in the
[2394.32 - 2400.64] body so that means if your
[2396.80 - 2401.84] uh migraines okay or are because of a
[2400.64 - 2403.36] little bit of strep that's in your
[2401.84 - 2405.20] system all these years a little bit of
[2403.36 - 2407.68] strep inside the sinuses
[2405.20 - 2409.28] um a little bit of epstein bar inside
[2407.68 - 2411.20] the liver or however or
[2409.28 - 2412.96] nerves are sensitive or a little bit of
[2411.20 - 2414.48] toxic heavy metals all of it that i talk
[2412.96 - 2415.12] about through migraines and things like
[2414.48 - 2417.12] that
[2415.12 - 2418.32] and sensitive nerves like vagus nerve
[2417.12 - 2419.68] frantic nerves
[2418.32 - 2420.80] trigeminal nerves and you get the
[2419.68 - 2422.32] headache you get them like the
[2420.80 - 2424.80] neurological migraines
[2422.32 - 2425.68] so when it happens that happens during
[2424.80 - 2427.28] menstruation
[2425.68 - 2429.04] and because and it could happen during
[2427.28 - 2431.28] ovulation a little bit too so it can
[2429.04 - 2433.12] happen there too because 40
[2431.28 - 2434.72] of a woman's immune system goes directly
[2433.12 - 2436.16] to the reproductive system during
[2434.72 - 2439.12] ovulation leaving
[2436.16 - 2439.60] only 60 percent everywhere else so it's
[2439.12 - 2441.84] it's
[2439.60 - 2443.36] because of that you're not when women go
[2441.84 - 2445.36] into their cycles and ovulation they're
[2443.36 - 2447.04] not running on 100 immune system
[2445.36 - 2448.88] and then anything they have that's what
[2447.04 - 2450.64] happens with women that's why acne
[2448.88 - 2451.28] breaks out that's streptococcus during
[2450.64 - 2454.40] cycles
[2451.28 - 2456.32] or shortly after cycles or so that's why
[2454.40 - 2458.00] when women have fatigue they get more
[2456.32 - 2459.60] fatigue during their cycles because
[2458.00 - 2461.28] they're dealing with something else
[2459.60 - 2463.36] and their immune system is going all the
[2461.28 - 2465.60] way to the reproductive system instead
[2463.36 - 2467.12] of watching everything else it's it's
[2465.60 - 2468.48] the difference between men and women
[2467.12 - 2470.16] it's one of the
[2468.48 - 2472.32] one of these differences between men and
[2470.16 - 2474.16] women men's immune systems just
[2472.32 - 2475.52] unless they burn themselves out their
[2474.16 - 2478.32] immune system stays
[2475.52 - 2479.76] just level it stays level it's it's so
[2478.32 - 2481.84] unfair to women women
[2479.76 - 2483.28] their immune system has to has to
[2481.84 - 2484.80] actually juggle
[2483.28 - 2486.80] and and take care of the reproductive
[2484.80 - 2488.72] system which is how life is going to
[2486.80 - 2492.88] move forward here in planet earth
[2488.72 - 2496.08] um um yeah so and
[2492.88 - 2497.44] um so what i would do is like when you
[2496.08 - 2498.24] look at the book take the book to your
[2497.44 - 2499.84] doctor
[2498.24 - 2501.52] with the migraines too you can take the
[2499.84 - 2503.20] book to your doctor you can look at the
[2501.52 - 2504.88] protocol for supplements in the back of
[2503.20 - 2506.16] the doctor for headaches and migraines
[2504.88 - 2507.28] you can look in the back
[2506.16 - 2508.64] of the book you can see all the
[2507.28 - 2510.16] different supplements you can see the
[2508.64 - 2512.00] protocols you can take that
[2510.16 - 2513.04] i mean i would if i was getting the
[2512.00 - 2515.20] migrants i would consider the
[2513.04 - 2518.24] mono-eating cleanse for sure and look at
[2515.20 - 2518.24] the supplements in the back
[2519.36 - 2524.32] um shelly ann i've healed chronic acid
[2522.24 - 2525.20] reflux with drinking celery juice every
[2524.32 - 2527.52] morning
[2525.20 - 2529.60] i had it really bad so that's incredible
[2527.52 - 2531.28] so your chronic acid reflux already got
[2529.60 - 2532.00] better you healed it you're drinking
[2531.28 - 2533.76] every morning
[2532.00 - 2536.16] and i've been drinking it for two and a
[2533.76 - 2536.96] half years now oh my god shelly that's
[2536.16 - 2539.44] incredible
[2536.96 - 2540.80] that's incredible two and a half years
[2539.44 - 2543.36] drinking celery juice
[2540.80 - 2544.16] you healed your acid reflux i'm like so
[2543.36 - 2545.84] proud of you
[2544.16 - 2547.92] it's like you know what it is you like
[2545.84 - 2549.52] you you and you probably went to a lot
[2547.92 - 2550.32] of doctors for that acid reflux you
[2549.52 - 2552.24] probably went
[2550.32 - 2554.00] went through a lot and sometimes it
[2552.24 - 2555.44] takes time to heal some people
[2554.00 - 2557.04] shelly some people want to be healed in
[2555.44 - 2557.76] one week you know they want to be healed
[2557.04 - 2559.68] in one week
[2557.76 - 2562.32] but then they don't do enough of the
[2559.68 - 2563.84] protocols or customize it right like you
[2562.32 - 2566.56] did and
[2563.84 - 2566.56] it's amazing
[2567.04 - 2578.88] so i'm looking through more questions
[2568.48 - 2582.32] you guys
[2578.88 - 2583.84] so staccata oh my goodness thank you for
[2582.32 - 2586.88] the period answer
[2583.84 - 2589.52] so for exa right suffered for
[2586.88 - 2590.80] a very long time with different things
[2589.52 - 2592.32] but that's what happens when you have
[2590.80 - 2593.92] your periods and then all these
[2592.32 - 2595.60] different problems happen and when your
[2593.92 - 2597.52] periods are coming
[2595.60 - 2598.80] everything feels worse because you have
[2597.52 - 2600.32] these other conditions
[2598.80 - 2602.08] and then the immune system can't be
[2600.32 - 2604.08] taken care of all that so it
[2602.08 - 2605.68] it goes to your cycle only and when it
[2604.08 - 2607.20] goes to your cycle only oh my god
[2605.68 - 2610.00] everything that you deal with
[2607.20 - 2610.96] rises up that's what i you know and i
[2610.00 - 2613.36] like trying to
[2610.96 - 2614.96] get people and women to work on their
[2613.36 - 2616.40] conditions get down to the bottom of
[2614.96 - 2617.60] their conditions so when their periods
[2616.40 - 2620.16] come they're not
[2617.60 - 2621.44] they're not mortified or scared or ptsd
[2620.16 - 2621.92] out that their period is going to come
[2621.44 - 2624.56] and cause
[2621.92 - 2624.56] more trouble
[2629.04 - 2633.52] folklore family you and spirit helped me
[2631.60 - 2635.36] recover from lung cancer
[2633.52 - 2636.96] bless your heart i'm proud of you you
[2635.36 - 2640.40] worked hard for it
[2636.96 - 2642.32] nothing um hi anthony my mom's nails are
[2640.40 - 2644.08] going brown and coming off do you know
[2642.32 - 2647.52] what this could be
[2644.08 - 2649.12] so um good question nothing
[2647.52 - 2651.04] what happens with fingernails they're a
[2649.12 - 2653.68] big indication of the liver
[2651.04 - 2654.24] so big indication of the liver so what
[2653.68 - 2656.64] would
[2654.24 - 2658.80] you know what would mom like to do would
[2656.64 - 2660.40] she do a little bit of celery juice
[2658.80 - 2662.24] you know it's funny with her with her
[2660.40 - 2665.20] mom's you know it's like
[2662.24 - 2666.72] it's like you know it's some moms out
[2665.20 - 2668.00] there they'll do everything and some
[2666.72 - 2669.52] will just be like well i'll do a little
[2668.00 - 2671.36] bit of celery juice now and i don't
[2669.52 - 2673.44] really want to do this but i'll try that
[2671.36 - 2674.88] i would consider a little bit of celery
[2673.44 - 2677.28] juice because instantly that's going to
[2674.88 - 2681.12] start going to the liver a little bit
[2677.28 - 2682.56] and i would consider you know some b12
[2681.12 - 2684.64] you know that's you know one thing i
[2682.56 - 2685.28] would consider but when it comes down to
[2684.64 - 2688.64] nails
[2685.28 - 2690.08] um and and she can go to the doctor she
[2688.64 - 2692.16] can take the information
[2690.08 - 2694.16] too so nothing she can go to the doctor
[2692.16 - 2695.76] she can take the information
[2694.16 - 2697.04] and see what the doctor wants to do or
[2695.76 - 2698.64] anything and you can look in the back of
[2697.04 - 2701.28] the different stuff back there
[2698.64 - 2702.40] but but foods are a great way to start
[2701.28 - 2704.88] and you can talk to the doc
[2702.40 - 2705.60] talk to your mom's doctor and find out
[2704.88 - 2707.28] what
[2705.60 - 2708.96] which you know find out what your doctor
[2707.28 - 2711.60] feels like for different things
[2708.96 - 2713.20] i know that's spinach and i talked to
[2711.60 - 2714.16] another doctor recently about nails and
[2713.20 - 2716.72] stuff
[2714.16 - 2718.32] i recommended spinach and spinach soups
[2716.72 - 2720.00] so you take raw spinach
[2718.32 - 2721.52] you put in a blender you make a spinach
[2720.00 - 2722.96] soup i talk about the recipes and all
[2721.52 - 2725.68] the medical medium books
[2722.96 - 2727.44] and the spinach soup really does help
[2725.68 - 2727.76] with that with the liver and the nails
[2727.44 - 2729.12] and
[2727.76 - 2731.12] coupled with a little bit of celery
[2729.12 - 2733.52] juice and you know
[2731.12 - 2735.20] aloe water lemon water these are just
[2733.52 - 2736.24] little basics and she can talk to her
[2735.20 - 2740.56] doctor about what she
[2736.24 - 2740.56] likes or not to do what the doctor likes
[2740.96 - 2746.88] carolyn says i bought all the books yay
[2744.00 - 2747.92] you're awesome thank you thank you you
[2746.88 - 2749.12] know because i know that if you're
[2747.92 - 2750.48] buying all the books then you're going
[2749.12 - 2752.16] to tell somebody else
[2750.48 - 2753.68] hey look you know then you can give
[2752.16 - 2754.96] information and you can help somebody
[2753.68 - 2756.08] you can help a family member you can
[2754.96 - 2758.48] help a friend
[2756.08 - 2759.68] and then it's all that matters it's like

[2781.52 - 2784.72] by and decades go by
[2782.72 - 2786.32] no one everybody forgets what happens
[2784.72 - 2787.60] you don't forget you know what you've
[2786.32 - 2789.44] been through in your life but
[2787.60 - 2791.44] i noticed that the younger people that
[2789.44 - 2792.64] aren't so sick and they don't know what
[2791.44 - 2794.24] everybody went through
[2792.64 - 2796.08] and they're just kind of experimenting
[2794.24 - 2798.80] for fun on all these fun things and
[2796.08 - 2801.84] doing their health channels i get it and
[2798.80 - 2802.88] but honestly i mean ever the history
[2801.84 - 2805.76] gets forgotten
[2802.88 - 2807.36] like history like just who cares if
[2805.76 - 2808.88] millions of people suffered from lyme
[2807.36 - 2809.52] disease many of them lost their lives
[2808.88 - 2812.16] because of bad
[2809.52 - 2812.96] treatments who cares if people suffered
[2812.16 - 2815.36] the worst
[2812.96 - 2816.08] endometriosis and and periods like all
[2815.36 - 2817.84] of a sudden you know

[2825.76 - 2831.68] on for liking uh plano players so
[2829.04 - 2833.04] um i'm not look the funny thing is
[2831.68 - 2834.08] someone will say well he likes celery
[2833.04 - 2836.56] juice for everything that's
[2834.08 - 2837.60] it's one of the medical medium tools and
[2836.56 - 2838.72] millions of people
[2837.60 - 2840.80] hundreds of millions of people are
[2838.72 - 2842.32] drinking celery juice now and there's a
[2840.80 - 2844.80] reason because it really does
[2842.32 - 2845.60] it is one of those incredible medical
[2844.80 - 2847.44] medium tools
[2845.60 - 2850.32] that spirit of compassion brought here
[2847.44 - 2852.40] and it should never be underestimated so
[2850.32 - 2854.40] anything with like in plano planaris
[2852.40 - 2855.68] polaris it's great you could use a
[2854.40 - 2857.28] little bit of celery juice that's one
[2855.68 - 2859.12] aspect what i like to do with that
[2857.28 - 2859.92] condition personally if i had that
[2859.12 - 2862.48] condition
[2859.92 - 2864.16] is i would be on low fats really low fat
[2862.48 - 2865.60] so if you're an animal protein person
[2864.16 - 2867.52] and you like animal protein
[2865.60 - 2869.84] maybe once a day only do animal protein
[2867.52 - 2871.36] once a day and i would
[2869.84 - 2873.52] i would do it at the end of the day i
[2871.36 - 2875.44] would never do eggs i would stay away
[2873.52 - 2878.40] from eggs i would stay away from
[2875.44 - 2879.20] dairy products completely butter milk
[2878.40 - 2881.84] cheese
[2879.20 - 2883.20] kefir yogurt i would get rid of if i had
[2881.84 - 2885.20] that condition
[2883.20 - 2887.04] and so and i would stay off of the
[2885.20 - 2888.64] caffeine if i had the condition if you
[2887.04 - 2889.84] possibly can so these are some of the
[2888.64 - 2891.52] things i would do i would stay off of
[2889.84 - 2892.48] fermented foods if i had that condition
[2891.52 - 2895.44] so i'm just giving you
[2892.48 - 2896.08] what to stay away from what to bring in
[2895.44 - 2899.04] um
[2896.08 - 2900.00] well leafy greens are important can you

[2928.88 - 2932.48] you can take it one step at a time with
[2930.96 - 2933.04] that condition you can really look at

[3011.28 - 3017.60] okay uh michaela
[3014.48 - 3021.20] derman i eat only raw fruits
[3017.60 - 3022.96] vegetables and greens from over for
[3021.20 - 3024.80] over a year now but i'm bloating every
[3022.96 - 3026.16] time i eat
[3024.80 - 3028.16] so you must been dealing with uploading
[3026.16 - 3030.16] problem for years and years and years
[3028.16 - 3031.68] and what i would do to begin with is i
[3030.16 - 3033.60] would look and cleanse the heel
[3031.68 - 3035.04] get the book free at the library just go
[3033.60 - 3035.92] to library don't even buy the book get
[3035.04 - 3037.52] it for free
[3035.92 - 3039.12] um of course you can get it on sale at
[3037.52 - 3041.92] amazon right now
[3039.12 - 3043.52] an incredible sale for this book
[3041.92 - 3045.44] personally for this book whatever
[3043.52 - 3046.80] specifically i mean but bloating go in
[3045.44 - 3049.60] the bloating section
[3046.80 - 3051.12] and take a look and you can start there
[3049.60 - 3053.04] but what i like to do for
[3051.12 - 3055.20] it's not about fruits and vegetables
[3053.04 - 3058.56] like raw fruits and vegetables
[3055.20 - 3060.00] is not an answer and i think there's a
[3058.56 - 3061.84] confusion out there
[3060.00 - 3063.04] people will say like american means raw
[3061.84 - 3064.00] fruits vegetables are fruits and
[3063.04 - 3065.60] vegetables it's like
[3064.00 - 3067.68] no medical medium is a thousand
[3065.60 - 3069.60] different protocols and
[3067.68 - 3071.92] customizing for the specific condition
[3069.60 - 3074.24] of what's going wrong so you're bloating
[3071.92 - 3075.12] what's going on with that bloating well
[3074.24 - 3076.96] find out what
[3075.12 - 3078.48] causes bloating so you read that in the
[3076.96 - 3080.24] back here and you find out what causes
[3078.48 - 3082.80] bloating to begin with okay
[3080.24 - 3084.24] and then um you learn that it's low
[3082.80 - 3086.80] hydrochloric acid
[3084.24 - 3088.32] so low hydrochloric acid from years ago
[3086.80 - 3090.80] from your whole life
[3088.32 - 3092.96] so your stomach glands just have not
[3090.80 - 3094.80] returned to the where they need to be
[3092.96 - 3096.64] yet they haven't got to that place of
[3094.80 - 3098.80] where they need to be the other can
[3096.64 - 3100.48] the other thing that happens is low bile
[3098.80 - 3102.64] reserves in your liver
[3100.48 - 3104.32] so you can be on only raw fruits and
[3102.64 - 3106.48] vegetables and leafy greens
[3104.32 - 3108.56] but are you doing fats are you burdening
[3106.48 - 3109.44] your liver how much avocado are you
[3108.56 - 3112.24] doing so
[3109.44 - 3113.92] really bad bloating cases and i teach
[3112.24 - 3115.92] doctors this all the time
[3113.92 - 3117.60] you want to get the liver back so you
[3115.92 - 3119.20] want to get the bile reserves back and
[3117.60 - 3120.00] one way of doing that is you drop the
[3119.20 - 3122.80] fats
[3120.00 - 3124.64] you drop the fats get those fats down
[3122.80 - 3126.24] and when you do that you drop you get
[3124.64 - 3127.36] rid of the nuts and seeds for a while
[3126.24 - 3130.48] you get rid of the
[3127.36 - 3132.16] avocado you get rid of the oils and if
[3130.48 - 3132.72] you're doing animal proteins get rid of
[3132.16 - 3134.56] the animal
[3132.72 - 3137.04] proteins for a while get rid of all the
[3134.56 - 3138.48] fats whether plant-based or animal-based
[3137.04 - 3140.16] whether you're a plant-based or animal
[3138.48 - 3141.84] baser and
[3140.16 - 3144.00] and what happens is you have all these
[3141.84 - 3145.92] old rotting proteins on lining the
[3144.00 - 3147.52] intestinal tract all these old rancid
[3145.92 - 3148.64] fats that have been there for years 10
[3147.52 - 3150.16] 20 30 years
[3148.64 - 3152.32] they're on the inside you know the
[3150.16 - 3153.12] intestinal tract lining they need to
[3152.32 - 3154.88] finally get
[3153.12 - 3156.16] cleaned out and they will over time so
[3154.88 - 3157.84] it takes a little time
[3156.16 - 3159.36] then you build up your hydrochloric acid
[3157.84 - 3159.92] in your stomach land you build up your
[3159.36 - 3161.92] liver
[3159.92 - 3164.48] all these things matter you clean out
[3161.92 - 3166.72] bacteria that's hiding in the gut
[3164.48 - 3168.24] streptococcus hiding in all that and
[3166.72 - 3168.88] then you do you look at the book and you
[3168.24 - 3170.24] look hey
[3168.88 - 3172.16] you know what's going on the cause of
[3170.24 - 3173.12] bloating and then you look mono eating
[3172.16 - 3174.88] cleanse
[3173.12 - 3176.80] celery juice is something you bring in
[3174.88 - 3178.96] 32 ounces once a day
[3176.80 - 3180.00] so fruits and vegetables is not enough
[3178.96 - 3182.24] that's all great
[3180.00 - 3183.84] and and raw fruits and vegetables is not
[3182.24 - 3185.20] enough that's the difference between if
[3183.84 - 3186.32] you find somebody on youtube and they're
[3185.20 - 3188.16] just a raw
[3186.32 - 3189.84] raw foodie or something and they're
[3188.16 - 3190.40] doing raw fruits vegetables and that's
[3189.84 - 3192.08] their thing
[3190.40 - 3194.00] that don't mean anything when you're
[3192.08 - 3196.96] sick what means when you're sick
[3194.00 - 3197.92] is what's wrong what's the answer to
[3196.96 - 3200.16] whatever you're doing
[3197.92 - 3201.12] and then how to use your fruits and
[3200.16 - 3204.32] vegetables
[3201.12 - 3207.52] how to use them as tools you know is the
[3204.32 - 3209.76] is the bloating severe bloating and and
[3207.52 - 3211.20] mono eating is something i look at when
[3209.76 - 3212.96] it's severe bloating so like
[3211.20 - 3213.44] gastroparesis severe bloating all these
[3212.96 - 3214.96] different
[3213.44 - 3216.48] conditions mono eating is really
[3214.96 - 3218.40] important so
[3216.48 - 3219.52] i hope that that helps in celery juice
[3218.40 - 3221.36] like 32 ounces
[3219.52 - 3222.64] every single morning you can do fruits
[3221.36 - 3224.24] and vegetables but if you're not doing
[3222.64 - 3225.68] 32 ounces every single morning and
[3224.24 - 3228.40] you're aloe water
[3225.68 - 3230.00] and and doing and knowing what's wrong
[3228.40 - 3230.64] so you can do that say the monolithing
[3230.00 - 3232.32] cleanse
[3230.64 - 3233.76] see how all these things matter all the
[3232.32 - 3234.56] different ways you can heal and the
[3233.76 - 3237.04] different
[3234.56 - 3238.32] tools you can use and somebody could be
[3237.04 - 3239.92] like raw fruits and vegetables it
[3238.32 - 3241.68] doesn't mean anything
[3239.92 - 3243.12] but but i'm proud of you though that
[3241.68 - 3244.80] you're eating that clean
[3243.12 - 3246.40] it's just what i mean but it doesn't
[3244.80 - 3247.12] mean anything it means you have to know
[3246.40 - 3249.04] what's wrong
[3247.12 - 3250.96] then be able to customize it using
[3249.04 - 3251.44] healing tools the only place i've seen
[3250.96 - 3253.12] that
[3251.44 - 3254.40] still to this day whether anybody likes
[3253.12 - 3257.04] it or not is the medical medium books
[3254.40 - 3259.12] and information
[3257.04 - 3260.64] but that's from spirit of compassion not
[3259.12 - 3262.88] because i'm smart i tell you guys all
[3260.64 - 3264.40] the time i'm not a smart guy
[3262.88 - 3266.16] you know yeah i talk to doctors every
[3264.40 - 3267.84] single day and i teach doctors every day
[3266.16 - 3270.48] for years and years but i'm not a smart
[3267.84 - 3272.48] guy it comes from up here
[3270.48 - 3273.68] um so it's all about knowing the cost so
[3272.48 - 3275.44] it's like well

[3275.44 - 3278.40] vegetable expert out there on youtube

[3300.00 - 3302.16] to get it for free if they can with the
[3301.28 - 3304.16] library
[3302.16 - 3305.20] um stacy can you talk about detox
[3304.16 - 3307.20] reactions
[3305.20 - 3308.88] whoa it's a question right there detox
[3307.20 - 3309.36] reactions i've been drinking celery
[3308.88 - 3311.20] juice
[3309.36 - 3312.80] for four weeks and it just had a nasty
[3311.20 - 3315.92] bat of shingles pop up
[3312.80 - 3317.28] can this happen not from celery juice um
[3315.92 - 3318.88] like there's people with shingles and
[3317.28 - 3320.00] they use celery just to get rid of
[3318.88 - 3322.72] shingles that's there's people
[3320.00 - 3324.40] out there that they they have conditions
[3322.72 - 3326.64] caused by the shingles
[3324.40 - 3328.40] so um if you weren't doing your celery
[3326.64 - 3331.12] juice the shingles were still coming
[3328.40 - 3332.72] um that's this is how it works it's just
[3331.12 - 3335.84] if you were doing
[3332.72 - 3336.64] if you were doing oil pulling for a
[3335.84 - 3338.08] month
[3336.64 - 3339.92] and you had your shingles it would be
[3338.08 - 3340.72] the oil pulling that caused it it's just
[3339.92 - 3342.88] a normal
[3340.72 - 3344.48] assist life it's like it's like that's
[3342.88 - 3345.84] how we think when we're trying something
[3344.48 - 3347.28] new or anything and it happens to be
[3345.84 - 3349.44] around a time when something's already
[3347.28 - 3350.96] out in order for shingles to come out
[3349.44 - 3353.44] it had been in the works for the last
[3350.96 - 3353.92] six months to a year so shingles doesn't
[3353.44 - 3356.88] just
[3353.92 - 3357.52] come out it's in the process of coming
[3356.88 - 3360.00] out so
[3357.52 - 3361.28] it's in the process it's usually you get
[3360.00 - 3363.68] it a year before
[3361.28 - 3365.04] you get it six months before and then
[3363.68 - 3366.72] it's in you
[3365.04 - 3368.40] and it stays in you until it
[3366.72 - 3369.68] proliferates and proliferates and then
[3368.40 - 3372.88] you have the rash
[3369.68 - 3374.72] so so um four weeks
[3372.88 - 3376.64] and the shingles coming out well it's
[3374.72 - 3377.76] more like four months and the shingles
[3376.64 - 3379.12] comes out
[3377.76 - 3381.12] so stacey what i would do is look into
[3379.12 - 3381.52] the shingle section here and jump on
[3381.12 - 3383.68] this
[3381.52 - 3385.04] because get the book out for free at the
[3383.68 - 3387.60] library
[3385.04 - 3389.36] jump on it in a sense where you want to
[3387.60 - 3390.88] take the protocols to your doctor
[3389.36 - 3392.48] that's in the shingles protocol so you
[3390.88 - 3394.32] can protect yourself from
[3392.48 - 3396.48] post shingles post shingles is the
[3394.32 - 3399.52] problem celery juice is helpful
[3396.48 - 3401.60] uh i i just i wouldn't i mean i wouldn't
[3399.52 - 3403.44] stop the seller issues
[3401.60 - 3404.88] but there's so many things you can do
[3403.44 - 3405.68] for your immune system and what else are
[3404.88 - 3407.60] you eating
[3405.68 - 3408.96] were you eating something else you're
[3407.60 - 3410.48] drinking celery just but were you eating
[3408.96 - 3411.60] something else that feeds shingles
[3410.48 - 3414.24] because aids
[3411.60 - 3415.44] because eggs feed shingles so it you
[3414.24 - 3417.60] know that's what happens with eggs
[3415.44 - 3419.20] they feed shingles and what they also do
[3417.60 - 3421.36] they feed all the different bugs
[3419.20 - 3422.48] so that's what they do so when it comes
[3421.36 - 3424.88] down dairy products
[3422.48 - 3427.36] feeds shingles you know eggs feed
[3424.88 - 3427.36] shingles
[3428.88 - 3433.04] so breezy hi i am wondering what to do
[3430.96 - 3435.28] for whole body twitching
[3433.04 - 3437.28] most in the chest thighs and head any
[3435.28 - 3439.76] suggestions would be great
[3437.28 - 3441.36] so all the years i mean 35 years of
[3439.76 - 3443.60] helping so many people
[3441.36 - 3445.92] and helping so many people to doctors
[3443.60 - 3447.68] doctors patients and so forth because i
[3445.92 - 3448.64] was always the guy was the bizarre
[3447.68 - 3451.68] symptoms guy
[3448.64 - 3452.72] that's what it was so um back going back
[3451.68 - 3454.48] 35 years
[3452.72 - 3456.64] he's the bizarre symptom guys if you
[3454.48 - 3457.52] have a guy and what happens is doctors
[3456.64 - 3461.12] would be like
[3457.52 - 3463.28] okay i know this guy um
[3461.12 - 3464.72] talk to him let's get him on the phone
[3463.28 - 3465.84] so doctor would contact me have a
[3464.72 - 3468.00] patient on the phone
[3465.84 - 3470.24] we'd all be on the phone together and go
[3468.00 - 3471.92] ahead tell anthony your bizarre symptoms
[3470.24 - 3474.08] and let's see what spirit of compassion
[3471.92 - 3475.84] has to say and so spirit of compassion
[3474.08 - 3477.68] would give information to the doctor and
[3475.84 - 3478.40] what happens is with twitches and spasms
[3477.68 - 3479.92] and all that
[3478.40 - 3481.92] would always would come through for the
[3479.92 - 3483.60] most part outside of some different
[3481.92 - 3485.60] viral issues and other things
[3483.60 - 3486.64] would be the toxic heavy metals so
[3485.60 - 3489.68] mercury
[3486.64 - 3490.32] that's a big one for twitches and spasms
[3489.68 - 3492.16] and
[3490.32 - 3493.60] all that stuff so you know what take
[3492.16 - 3495.68] take the book to your doctor look at the
[3493.60 - 3497.20] heavy metal detox cleanse
[3495.68 - 3499.36] and take a look and you can go to the
[3497.20 - 3500.96] neural neurological section and you can
[3499.36 - 3505.28] see twitches spasms
[3500.96 - 3507.52] all that jerking all that so yeah
[3505.28 - 3507.52] um
[3511.60 - 3516.80] so so many great questions just reading
[3513.28 - 3518.40] questions along the way
[3516.80 - 3530.40] such a great night to have you guys on
[3518.40 - 3531.60] here tonight a cup
[3530.40 - 3534.32] janet's got an interesting question
[3531.60 - 3535.12] right here if i don't if i don't plant
[3534.32 - 3536.72] based fat
[3535.12 - 3539.68] so that means i think you're saying if i
[3536.72 - 3542.16] don't eat plant-based fats
[3539.68 - 3542.88] my blood sugar is not balanced what do
[3542.16 - 3545.52] you suggest
[3542.88 - 3545.92] well it's it's like this it's if that
[3545.52 - 3549.20] means
[3545.92 - 3552.64] here's how it works if you it
[3549.20 - 3554.96] okay if you stop your plant-based fats
[3552.64 - 3556.16] that'd be nuts seeds avocado and all
[3554.96 - 3558.64] that your most
[3556.16 - 3560.56] those are high-calorie foods you're most
[3558.64 - 3562.96] likely stopping those and not getting
[3560.56 - 3565.36] enough calories on the opposite end
[3562.96 - 3567.28] so here's how it goes so you're eating
[3565.36 - 3570.72] your plant-based diet
[3567.28 - 3572.96] you stop the highest calorie part of
[3570.72 - 3574.96] your diet which is the fats
[3572.96 - 3576.24] so you stop eating two avocados a day
[3574.96 - 3578.48] you stop eating uh
[3576.24 - 3579.76] you know handfuls of cashews you stop
[3578.48 - 3582.64] eating oils
[3579.76 - 3584.00] you stop those high calories okay once
[3582.64 - 3585.84] those are gone
[3584.00 - 3588.00] you're under calorie now without
[3585.84 - 3590.48] realizing so you don't know how to like
[3588.00 - 3593.68] all of a sudden bring in enough potatoes
[3590.48 - 3596.32] enough sweet potatoes winter squash
[3593.68 - 3597.28] enough bananas enough you know a few
[3596.32 - 3599.68] dates or
[3597.28 - 3600.80] you know and you have to also get in the
[3599.68 - 3604.00] mineral salts
[3600.80 - 3607.20] critical so you can't just go off
[3604.00 - 3608.48] of all these fats and then not get some
[3607.20 - 3610.24] mineral salts in
[3608.48 - 3612.24] you'll go under calories you won't get
[3610.24 - 3613.92] enough mineral salts plus you'll have
[3612.24 - 3614.32] fats in your system so here's how it
[3613.92 - 3616.08] works
[3614.32 - 3618.80] you've been eating your fats all your
[3616.08 - 3621.36] life the minute you stop your fats
[3618.80 - 3622.32] you know the fats don't go away they're
[3621.36 - 3623.68] in the liver
[3622.32 - 3625.84] they're in they're in the bloodstream
[3623.68 - 3627.52] for three straight days after that
[3625.84 - 3629.20] then they're in the bloodstream for
[3627.52 - 3631.76] quite a while because you start
[3629.20 - 3633.04] you start getting rid of toxic fat
[3631.76 - 3634.88] storages
[3633.04 - 3636.48] so then you get all of sudden you got
[3634.88 - 3637.28] still more fat going into the
[3636.48 - 3639.28] bloodstream
[3637.28 - 3641.28] so what it is is what i'm suggesting
[3639.28 - 3644.00] which is probably what's happening is
[3641.28 - 3644.32] you're going off your high calorie fats
[3644.00 - 3646.64] and
[3644.32 - 3648.08] you're under calorie for the moment and
[3646.64 - 3649.28] you're getting a swing because you're
[3648.08 - 3650.64] under calories so then you're getting a
[3649.28 - 3652.00] little bit of a blood sugar drop
[3650.64 - 3653.84] so you want to consider you want to make
[3652.00 - 3655.20] sure you're doing enough of the
[3653.84 - 3657.12] you know enough things like you're doing
[3655.20 - 3658.88] the celery juice for the mineral salts
[3657.12 - 3660.08] you're getting enough in your smoothie
[3658.88 - 3661.20] you're getting the wild blueberries
[3660.08 - 3661.76] you're getting the bananas in your
[3661.20 - 3663.60] smoothie
[3661.76 - 3665.76] you're doing the steamed potatoes and
[3663.60 - 3668.96] leafy greens and you're not
[3665.76 - 3671.12] like giving up calories
[3668.96 - 3672.96] and that's what happens to try that
[3671.12 - 3675.12] that's one angle right there it could be
[3672.96 - 3677.52] really helpful i love that food question
[3675.12 - 3678.24] um you know papaya banana more of that
[3677.52 - 3680.24] in there
[3678.24 - 3681.44] more the celery juice more of the
[3680.24 - 3683.52] lettuce is and you
[3681.44 - 3685.68] keep that balance while you're getting
[3683.52 - 3686.80] rid of that old fat storage and the fat
[3685.68 - 3688.56] that's been in your bloodstream
[3686.80 - 3690.24] for three days because it's still going
[3688.56 - 3691.44] to be in your bloodstream for days after
[3690.24 - 3692.88] you go off the fats so you're going to
[3691.44 - 3695.28] be swinging you're going to be like what
