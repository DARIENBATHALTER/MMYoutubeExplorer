1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
they have chronic illness they think

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:08,040
that one or two symptoms that they're

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,340
having chronically isn't an illness of

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,160
any kind because maybe it did not make

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,199
them bedridden maybe they're in a place

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,720
where their symptoms aren't setting them

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,699
back maybe they're in a place where

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,100
their symptoms aren't

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,019
stopping them from working and being

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,760
productive maybe they're in a place

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,160
where their symptoms they just push

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,619
through they're not really in the way

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,600
but when it gets to a point where your

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,460
symptoms get worse and worse how about

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,680
you like have you ever experienced this

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,700
where you have the fatigue and the brain

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,140
fog

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,579
and the acne and the body pain and all

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,379
kinds of other symptoms with it the

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,719
dizziness or the vertigo or the tinnitus

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,899
and then it's getting to a point where

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,219
more fatigue more brain fog and you're

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,739
visiting doctors and you're getting

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,820
blood drawn left and right and now

25
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,320
you're just declining and declining

26
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,059
chronic illness right that's where

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,100
people think well then maybe that's a

28
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,240
chronic illness but no it's not just

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,780
that it is any symptom that is

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,299
persisting that's not going away that's

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,979
just staying there day after day or

32
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,240
intermittent where it's like it's here

33
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,680
for a little while then a week later

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,540
it's gone it's here for a little while

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,140
then a week later it's gone

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,060

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,280

tinnitus right so we'll talk about

128
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,479
tonight for a second little lie though

129
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,520
something we can talk about too

130
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:47,220
villago is a combination of the

131
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,160
Epstein-Barr virus inside the liver

132
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,259
okay this is important

133
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,880
feeding off of

134
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,780
toxic heavy metals like aluminum

135
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,000
releasing

136
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:03,660
a neurotoxin

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,740
that neurotoxin damages the melon in the

138
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,419
pigment

139
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,699
in the skin

140
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:11,600
creates

141
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,600
vitiligo

146
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,800
detail

147
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,259
so you have to understand

148
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,360
inside the liver

149
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,960
lives a bug

150
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,720
the bugs happy happy is a clam inside

151
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,620
the liver feeding off of garbage and

152
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:41,100
[ __ ] and junk and junk and garbage

153
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:47,160
feeding on all that toxic crap and then

154
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:49,319
it runs across a Wellspring of aluminum

155
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,740
that Wellspring of aluminum

156
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,259
feeds the bug the virus the virus eats

157
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:59,220
it eats it eats it then it shits and

158
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:03,900
pisses that toxin out and that toxin is

159
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,660
a dermatoxin that dermatoxin is lethal

160
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,460
to pigment

161
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,960
and that's how you end up getting all

162
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,060
the white spots in the middle eye going

163
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,280
it starts going crazy Linden Forrester

182
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,560
when people don't know what is in my

183
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,900
hand it's like having an answer having

184
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,639
something that's so valuable but

185
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,120
nobody's gonna know

186
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:09,120

192
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,280

quick you guys just bear with me for a

195
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,139
second we're going to talk about

196
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,520
symptoms conditions I'm here I'm here to

197
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,840
help I want to go through stuff with you

198
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,419
guys

199
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,099
four reasons why energy is better you

200
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,320
know how you hear high quality or

201
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,599
quality good quality

202
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,700
and supplements are like good quality we

203
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,200
got the quality control no there's

204
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,200
different levels of quality there's

205
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,260
different tiers vmrt they do something

206
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,880
no one else does they go to the top tier

207
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,200
where no one wants to spend their money

208
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,060
and supplement companies don't want to

209
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,399
spend their money they don't want that

210
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,640
option you can get like for instance

211
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,620
just ashwagandha you can get

212
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,540
um okay you can get a good quality

213
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,160
ashwagandha you can get another good

214
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,899
quality ashwagandha you can get another

215
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,279
good quality ashwagandha you get another

216
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,200
good quality

217
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,959
but they're not as good as the quality

218
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,420
at the top and you keep on climbing up

219
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,700
right the bottom quality is not as good

220
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,940
as the top quality this is so important

221
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,120
to say memory goes to The toppest

222
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,519
quality and the tapest quality is

223
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,260
expensive and some little companies

224
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,580
won't do that they don't need to they'll

225
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,740
just buy

226
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,140
you know ashwagandha put it in their

227
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,600
supplement and Bank on the bottom line

228
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,620
right remember she says no we won't do

229
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,899
that this is huge huge Bemidji goes and

230
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,339
asks for the highest quality and if they

231
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,399
don't have the highest quality of energy

232
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,600
we'll go and find it somehow no one does

233
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,279
that

234
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,260
that's one thing let's go to another

235
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,760
thing ready no alcohol no natural

236
00:09:52,260 --> 00:10:00,180
flavors no citric acid no

237
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,940
titanium dioxide no all that junk no

238
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,700
gluten obviously no soy but better than

239
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,500
that they knew better at the start not

240
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,140
to put natural flavors natural Berry

241
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,180
flavor which is all MSG they knew not to

242
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,580
put any of the flavors in this stuff so

243
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,380
you know what other supplement companies

244
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,180
will try to copy them and they'll leave

245
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,060
out natural flavors I can actually

246
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,940
mention one that's actually out there

247
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,800
like yeah man ours is the best yeah dude

248
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,019
you had natural flavors in yours and

249
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,080
citric acid in yours forever until you

250
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:33,899
copied themergy so

251
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,899
they're the only ones though it has none

252
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,760
of all that stuff in there none right so

253
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,980
that's that's the next thing so let's go

254
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,440
to the part three which is incredible

255
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,079
into three points okay

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,260
they don't put hidden stuff supplement

257
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,079
companies are allowed to legally keep a

258
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,120
secret from you guys they're allowed to

259
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,440
legally put a certain percentage of

260
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,959
hidden ingredients in your

261
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,940
supplementation and I can guarantee you

262
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,940
if you're doing other supplements out

263
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,260
there you're eating hidden ingredients I

264
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:09,959
can freaking guarantee that

265
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,120
will not put that undisclosed hidden

266
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,860
ingredient in their supplements dude you

267
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,399
can't get that and I don't care who it

268
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,380
is they're all putting in binders anti

269
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,959
whatever or binding agents they're

270
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,480
putting all kinds of stuff in there

271
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,740
that's how insane that is that sounds

272
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,320
insane

273
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:33,420
and so these alone are reasons why and

274
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,300
the list goes on there's so many other

275
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,279
reasons too I could talk about it but

276
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
I didn't want to make it about this I

277
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,279
just I want to talk about symptoms

278
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,140
conditions I want to talk about tinnitus

279
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,740
next we'll go into that we'll go we'll

280
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,660
dig into the book right

281
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,240
take advantage of the sale while it's

282
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,540
happening though okay so vimergy.com

283
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,220
these in Victor I am as Mary

284
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,779
ergy.com all right because people ask me

285
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,420
about when they're having a sale over

286
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:03,180
and over again how many DMs I get about

287
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:07,320
that it's insane they're having a sale

288
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:10,680
now but like I said even more than that

289
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,120
it's what this is right here that I

290
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,339
think

291
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,200
so many people will never have an

292
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,480
opportunity to understand or experience

293
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,480
it or to know how it moves the needle

294
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,720
they will never ever experience that

295
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,880
but what is in my hand is something

296
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,260
extremely special

297
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,740
extremely special

298
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:35,279
and I live by that propolis right there

299
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,839
How It's Made has specific bees they use

300
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,959
everything

301
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,959
it is no joke no joke anyway all right

302
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,740
let's cook

303
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:54,180
let's cook with pork

304
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,740
no and don't you pork don't do pork

305
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,300
unless your doctor's telling you to do

306
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,279
pork don't get don't go against your

307
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,639
doctor's advice your doctor wants to do

308
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,639
work

309
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:08,100

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,980
so let's talk about it a little bit

407
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,779
The Usual Suspects right here

408
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,639
let's get into that

409
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,260

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:27,179
are things that medicine can find things

418
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:31,340
that many times

419
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:34,380
MRIs can find many times doctors

information comes from above

428
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:55,080
if you've gone through the battery of

429
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,780
tests reviewed your medical history

430
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,419
with your doctors and rolled out the

431
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,700
elements on the list above then you're

432
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,620
in the mystery realm if you hear me

433
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,780
yelling

434
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,299
because some people are like I can't

435
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,940
hear you speak louder

436
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,559
what follows are explanations of

437
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,720
migraine triggers that medical

438
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:18,900
communities don't fully yet understand

439
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,820
unless they stole it poached it taken it

440
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,640
from the medical medium books

441
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,039
long ago along with triggers that I'm

442
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,600
disclosing Here For the First Time

443
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,280
Epstein-Barr virus and shingles doctors

444
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,260
don't know that millions of people

445
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,299
suffer from migraines as a result from

446
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,780
Epstein-Barr virus or even a shingles

447
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,780
virus

448
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,620
and I go into that alternatively

449
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,299
shingles can inflame your trigeminal or

450
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,520
phrenic nerves which go into it a little

451
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:46,520
bit so trigeminal and phrenic nerves

452
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,020
herpes simplex one the virus behind the

453
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:58,260
common fever blister

454
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,919
the virus behind the common fever

455
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,919
blister

456
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,100
I don't know what I'm doing I'm just

457
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,980
pointing to something

458
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,160
I don't know what I'm pointing to

459
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,400
I don't know what I'm pointing to

460
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:18,059
my arm just won't stop pointing stop arm

461
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:22,820
stop stop pointing stop stop playing

462
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:22,820
it's funny herpes simplex one

463
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,059
the virus behind the common fever

464
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,220
blister can also Nest within the

465
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:32,280
trigeminal and phrenic nerves elevating

466
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,840
their inflammation ever so slightly just

467
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,840
enough to be a trigger

468
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,000
to learn if you're being afflicted by

469
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,799
the Epstein-Barr virus read these books

470
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,120
this one's incredible all on its own

471
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,799
okay

472
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,460
here's another one for migraines that

473
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:54,419
people don't know about micro Tia attack

474
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:56,039
and Trigger micro tias it's a big one

475
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:58,320
right there people have no idea they

476
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:01,580
have let's just go into the sinus

477
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,580
related migraines

478
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,500
some migraines stem from chronic

479
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:14,220
streptococcal infections that sit in the

480
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:17,580
Linings of the sinus cavity

481
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:23,179
strep sitting in the line line I'm sorry

482
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,179
sitting in the sinus cavity linings

483
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,179
craving headaches all the time for

484
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,000

488
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,500
I just

489
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,700
got a strep infection it never goes away

490
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,700
that nobody knows about

491
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,820
right there

492
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,900
show this is book one there's protocols

493
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,640
in here

494
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,020
you can take a look at these protocols

495
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,120
they're incredible so it's not just

496
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,740
information there's protocols in this

497
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,400
book this is medical medium new edition

498
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,400
book one

499
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,320
some migraines stem from streptococcal

500
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,679
and these K in these cases ears nose and

501
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,720
throat specialists offer often recommend

502
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,120
sinus surgery to remove scar tissue

503
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,340
because they don't know it but strep is

504
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,020
difficult to remove they don't know

505
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,059
that's why they're doing it people get

506
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,220
scar tissue removed out of their sinuses

507
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,440
surgeries

508
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,480
out of the sinus Linings but then it

509
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,620
comes back again because they had strep

510
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,200
this whole time

511
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,419
if these surgical procedures work at all

512
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,400
then the relief they gave patients is

513
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,679
only temporarily until the strep comes

514
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,360
back a better way to address sinus

515
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,840
related migraines is to strengthen the

516
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:49,940
immune system so that the body can

517
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,940
naturally fight infection

518
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:56,700
um okay over there on uh Instagram my

519
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,679

520
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,840
after following your diet thank you so

521
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,140

my choice of foods good handle great

523
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,620
handle

524
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,539
all right so let's move it into a little

525
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,220
bit of other permeability trigger that's

526
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,740
really cool

527
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,720
while blueberry dreams says on IG I used

528
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,520
to get chronic sinus infections and was

529
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,440
on antibiotics twice a year until I

530
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,960
found medical medium information no

531
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,539
doctors could help me now I haven't had

532
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,980
one since starting medical medium it was

533
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,980
the strep all along

534
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,020
incredible

535
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:38,880
[Music]

536
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,440
another major migraine culprit is

537
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,440
burning gut

538
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,159
medical communities don't know that when

539
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,620
your digestive system isn't working

540
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,960
properly ammonia gas can drift out from

541
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,600
your gut to your vagus and phrenic nerve

542
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,400
and trigeminal nerves ammonia can cross

543
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,020
the blood-brain barrier and find its way

544
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,860
into all parts of the central nervous

545
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,340
system

546
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,620
as the gas deprives the brain of some of

547
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,480
its needed oxygen tension can arise and

548
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,640
you end up going into spasm and you're

549
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,500
in a migraine so it's ammonia

550
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,360
permeability

551
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,980
medical meme information by the way and

552
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,179
I see somebody stealing it out there a

553
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,500
couple of people stealing the whole

554
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,620
ammonia thing and now you see

555
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
influencers like ammonia

556
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,600
yeah it's like yeah yeah okay you got it

557
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,740
from the medical mean books and then

558
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,480
you'll see a couple of bigger

559
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,280
influencers with their stuff trying to

560
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,980
sell their stuff like yeah ammonia

561
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,200
permeability in your liver and your HCL

562
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,580
it's like dude you never spoke like that

563
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,580
that's mm info

564
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,820
ammonia gas

565
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,000
all right let's move on there's tons of

566
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,760
info here just talked about migraines

567
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,919
and triggers let's see what we can do

568
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,620
electrolyte deficiency trigger

569
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,620
boom to remain healthy your body must

570
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,240
maintain a certain level of electrolytes

571
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,039
these electrolytes are used to maintain

572
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,840
neurotransmitter strengthened neurons

573
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,419
and send the electrical nerve impulses

574
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,340
that run your body and your brain

575
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,919
so here's the thing

576
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,980
people are they don't have the

577
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,360
electrolytes needed to sustain what

578
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,260
they're up against the stress are up

579
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,059
against

580
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,900
lots of things in their life they're up

581
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:19,500
against

582
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,120
their current diet all of it though and

583
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,720
they don't have that so that's another

584
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,940
section there stress I talk about how

585
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,919
that happens

586
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,260
menstrual cycle trigger

587
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,360
for migraines that's incredible

588
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,520
information right here menstrual cycle

589
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,140
triggered

590
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,179
can we run into that for a little bit

591
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,640
let's go

592
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,460
many female migraine sufferers notice

593
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,880
that their migraines come on right

594
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:50,820
before during or after their menstrual

595
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,700
cycle because when the menstrual cycle

596
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,980
happens the immune system drops

597
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,299
and when a woman's immune system drops

598
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,400
men don't have to go through the

599
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,900
menstrual cycle so their immune system

600
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,640
doesn't get

601
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,220
challenge

602
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,720
at all it doesn't get challenged at all

603
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,860
when a woman's going through

604
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,860
menstruation menstrual cycle the immune

605
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,140
system is focused on the reproductive

606
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:20,400
system leaving

607
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:23,480
all these other places alone without an

608
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,760
immune system and so streptococcus

609
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,100
Epstein-Barr other impedements toxic

610
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,919
heavy metals whatever it is

611
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,840
can easily bring on that

612
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,240
that headache

613
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,640
the Divine Lilith says can you also

614
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,919
explain why hot weather triggers

615
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,400
migraines

616
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:47,039
expansion of nerves nerve tissues

617
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,580
so hot weather

618
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,860
creates swelling if you have any

619
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,080
inflammation you're going to feel it

620
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,760
like no other

621
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,100
so you're going to see one person it's

622
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,460
like I love hot weather

623
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:05,039
I really love hot weather I could best I

624
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,440
could bask in it all day long I could

625
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,320
lay out in the sun I don't care how

626
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,900
humid it is I can work in the garden I

627
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,580
could go out and shop I can do all kinds

628
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,260
of things in the hot weather you've got

629
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,100
another person that's suffering in the

630
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:23,640
hot weather they feel so sticky and

631
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:26,700
swollen and don't feel good and they're

632
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,799
swelling internally and the heat also

633
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,020
puts pressure on the nerves there's a

634
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,720
combination of all that the same goes

635
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,460
with really really cold weather it's

636
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,159
hard for somebody too who's struggling

637
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,640
for a lot of reasons

638
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,860
Barbara Carbone on YouTube yeah the

639
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,679
propolis is good for immune system

640
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:49,140
definitely you guys if you just got on

641
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:52,440
here I was talking about how I wish

642
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,299
people knew what this was in my hand I'm

643
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,400
not insulting anybody I'm not saying

644
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,860
that they don't know what propolis is or

645
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,179
ever heard a propolis that's not it so

646
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,860
if you're somebody and you're like well

647
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:03,419
he's insulting me because he doesn't

648
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,520
think I don't know I've never heard

649
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:09,480
about propolis that's not it this

650
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,299

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:16,860
people only knew what was in my hand the

652
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:20,159
quality the the process of how this is

653
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:24,120
even made and how incredible it is and

654
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,740
how I live by this look live by this

655
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,080
propolis

656
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,840
anyway Germany has a sale you guys don't

657
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,940
endorse these guys

658
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,159
um but I the reason why I endorse these

659
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,440
guys is because stuff like this

660
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,799
stuff like that

661
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,559
that's why huge huge reason

662
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,360
okay so let's move into some other stuff

663
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:48,179
someone was talking about tinnitus

664
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:52,159
tinnitus you can you can get tinnitus

665
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:52,159
information all through these books

666
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,820
and here's the thing you guys

667
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,799
I don't want to see this disappear

668
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,360
it would be

669
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:05,159
a sin

670
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,820
a true sin

671
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,640
if this disappeared if the company

672
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,140
didn't make it anymore if this wasn't

673
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,600
available anymore

674
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,340
it would be

675
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,620
devastating

676
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,900
because people

677
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,120
it's an opportunity

678
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:28,559
for good health and people don't know

679
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,279
this but yeah it's just anyway so

680
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,740

we can we can go to either book but I'm

702
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:28,159
looking here well

703
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,940
um and I wanna I wanna read about it a

704
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,679
little bit too

705
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,179
let me see

706
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,899
I could also read about it in brain

707
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,899
saver too

708
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:45,059
these are medical textbooks

709
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,620
if you have these you know how hard this

710
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:49,020
hard is I mean there's so much

711
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,740
information it takes a second is what I

712
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,380
mean

713
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,299
that's not one of these thin books these

714
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,000
thin paperback books these you know

715
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:59,640
there's not much in there there's just

716
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,799
some weird marketing plan in there along

717
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,600
with some Diet that's trying to be

718
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:06,059
trendy you know that's not what this

719
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,860
stuff is

720
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,539
Robin over there on YouTube why do

721
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,679
symptoms get worse before they get

722
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,679
better while healing

723
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:18,779
so why do symptoms get worse before

724
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:22,919
getting better while healing okay

725
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:25,799
a lot of people it goes like this

726
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,960
your healing you go three steps up two

727
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:29,640
steps back three steps up two steps back

728
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,740
three steps up and you get stronger and

729
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,899
stronger and stronger right

730
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,460
a lot of people

731
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:39,659
okay

732
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:42,360
they start taking advantage of their

733
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:44,279
healing so they start doing more than

734
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,539
they have in six months more than they

735
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:48,419
have in a year

736
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:49,740
and they push themselves kind of off the

737
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,440
cliff

738
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,600
because they're getting better and

739
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,059
they're able to do more I can't tell you

740
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,039
how many people are they're starting to

741
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,360
heal and they want to go back to life

742
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,360
the way it was

743
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,520
when they weren't sick many years ago

744
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,419
and they just start doing all kinds of

745
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,659
stuff

746
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:12,179
physically emotionally mentally and they

747
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,460
get a setback because they went

748
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:18,120
all of a sudden went into full speed in

749
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,460
life because they were like woohoo

750
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,260
I'm getting better and they got full

751
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,179
speed so there's a bunch of them that

752
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,059
are out there it happens

753
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:29,520
and then there's a group of people too

754
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:31,740
that get exposed but don't even know it

755
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,899
they're working on their healing process

756
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,580
they're doing good and then they get set

757
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:37,260
back because they got exposed to

758
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,580
something something somewhere don't even

759
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,200
realize it

760
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,520
and they're set back for a little while

761
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,779
because of it maybe they're taking

762
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,760
something that's tough maybe they're

763
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:47,159
taking charcoal which is really toxic

764
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,539
maybe they're taking you know sodium

765
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,919
bicarbonate maybe they're doing apple

766
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,899
cider vinegar maybe they're doing

767
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,520
something and finally it tips the scale

768
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,960
and it sends them backwards so I'm just

769
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,240
giving you a few options maybe they're

770
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,340
doing the alkaline ionizer water

771
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,399
machines which literally is destructive

772
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,559
to it just sets people back maybe

773
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,480
they're doing something that's setting

774
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,000
them back maybe they're doing the Rife

775
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,860
machine which will set people back

776
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,320
so

777
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:16,399
um so that's the whole thing too people

778
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,020
that had bad symptoms coming on already

779
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,059
and by the time they started working on

780
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,380
healing they was already coming on so

781
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,120
there's that group of people too let's

782
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,919
hit that for a second there's a bunch of

783
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,260
people that we're going to get so darn

784
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,000
sick it was heading there and they

785
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:33,179
started working under healing process

786
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,320
when they were already going downhill

787
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:36,120
fast

788
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,399
and as they started the healing process

789
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,840
it could not catch up to it enough to

790
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,360
bring it back do you guys know what I'm

791
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,580
saying this is huge right here they

792
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,700
couldn't get enough done with their

793
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:50,460
healing process in enough time to stop

794
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,039
the bleed and literally

795
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,500
send themselves backwards to stop it

796
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,200
right

797
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,760
instead they were going down anyway

798
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,000
it's like

799
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,880
[ __ ] I'm getting sick I better try this

800
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,580
I better try that I'm getting sicker

801
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,100
they're just going down anyway and it's

802
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,779
going to take time for them to do the

803
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,240
right things to do the right protocols

804
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:18,659
and heal and climb back up because they

805
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,580
were already heading down there boom

806
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:22,620
they're already going down

807
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,899
there's that group of people

808
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,140
and then there's a group of people that

809
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:30,720
aren't doing what they need to do

810
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:33,240
they're dabbling they're inter mixing

811
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,740
things they're doing sodium bicarbonate

812
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,240
tearing up their intestinal tract

813
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,299
weakening their immune system while

814
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,500
doing celery juice and something else

815
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:45,360
they're doing charcoal and fish oil and

816
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,580
probiotics that are probably a toxic

817
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,840
variety versus

818
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:54,600
doing enough of the other things

819
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,159
right they're getting blood drawn they

820
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,899
think they're working on their healing

821
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,899
process and then they just had five more

822
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,519
blood uh vials of drawn they're working

823
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:04,679
under healing process and I know I

824
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,360
showed you this before but I have to

825
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,720
show you again because I think it's

826
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,720
important

827
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,260
so

828
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,700
and they get five more vials four more

829
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,619
vials

830
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,240
10 more vials

831
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:23,820
they're working on their healing process

832
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,339
and they just had 15 vials of blood

833
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,159
drawn from a specialist and then a month

834
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:31,500
later they tank and they're like what is

835
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,540
going wrong I'm working on my healing

836
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,119
process I'm doing the heavy metal detox

837
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,040
I'm doing the celery juice I'm watching

838
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,159
now I'm not eating the pork I'm not

839
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,200
eating the you know the tuna I'm not the

840
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,419
Mercury and the tuna I'm not eating the

841
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,820
cheese I'm not eating the eggs

842
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:49,619
and they go downhill because they just

843
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,540
had 10 vials of blood drawn and their

844
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,580
immune system was removed and their

845
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,919
immune system was cleaning up the mess

846
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,200
trying to keep them healthy there's that

847
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:02,720
group of people and there's a ton of

848
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,720
those people a ton of those people

849
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,020
and then there's those people that get a

850
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,020
bad medical treatment it just happens

851
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,260
boom now it's about fighting

852
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:18,839
to stay alive or fighting to get better

853
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,240
another another group of people get food

854
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,920
poisoning they should get food poisoning

855
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,980
there's a whole food poisonings every

856
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,599
day it's out there rampant out there

857
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,820
and there's you know and that's another

858
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,900
thing too they get food poisoning or

859
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,940
something it triggers off their

860
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,000
pathogens or they get a bad medical

861
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,460
treatment or something else

862
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,980
relationships uh um mental emotional

863
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,619
abuse a loss and that lowers their

864
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,119
immune system either way people are up

865
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,980
against a lot of different things think

866
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,140
about how many different triggers there

867
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,940
are I'm giving you a lot of different

868
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,460
scenarios but that's how many there are

869
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,079
because people in their lives and what

870
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,500
they're doing there's a lot of things

871
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,500
going on

872
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,720
so I don't know if I've given you 10

873
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,940
scenarios really common or whatever five

874
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,880
scenarios that are really common but

875
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,920
that's what happens with people as

876
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,460
they're trying to heal

877
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,260
and just quick reiteration here

878
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,079
there's that person who's healing but

879
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,720
wants to now go back to life 100 and

880
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,200
jump into something and just go full

881
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,420
force and they get beaten down

882
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,520
I mean there's just there's so many

883
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,020
that's just one out of so many I just

884
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,420
gave you and I could reiterate the rest

885
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,940
of them but I think you guys got the

886
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,579
point and I'm missing some too

887
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,740
I'm actually missing some I know I'm

888
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:42,780
missing a few that's how many things

889
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,119
tinnitus

890
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:49,380
said there for a little bit

891
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,760
when decibel damage has been rolled out

892
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,480
you haven't been to a lot of rock

893
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,800
concerts you don't play the bass super

894
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,300
loud

895
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,140
you're not somebody that's working

896
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,760
around construction and stuff like that

897
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,680
and you haven't worked around heavy

898
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,780
machinery for many years worked in the

899
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,060
music industry around live concerts or

900
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,920
had physical injury to the ear where

901
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,240
something happens here here and it was a

902
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,240
physical slam and hit

903
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,680
right and then when you receive a

904
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,420
tinnitus diagnosis because you have

905
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,880
ringing or humming in the ear you're

906
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,640
someone who's living with something else

907
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,079
than if you weren't injured if it wasn't

908
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,119
something like that when you were

909
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,740
injured it was an obvious thing you were

910
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,680
in the music industry you were in the

911
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:39,420
construction industry you had a reason

912
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:43,640
to have decibel damage in the inner ear

913
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,640
and this little bones in the air right

914
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,200
nerve damage and so forth if you don't

915
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,280
have any of that and that's not

916
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,460
happening

917
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,619
you're talking about viral inflammation

918
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,040
now we're talking about viral

919
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:01,440
inflammation

920
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,420
tinnitus you guys say tinnitus or do you

921
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,060
say tinnitus

922
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,220
tinnitus someone said tinnitus the other

923
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:11,280
day and I was like huh what that's right

925
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,540
have to be ringing in the ear it could

926
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,359
be humming buzzing vibrating popping

w-h-o-o-s-h-i-n-g whooshing

932
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,850
when someone has the high-pitched

933
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,180
ringing in the ear

934
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,400
[Music]

935
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,420
right the high [ __ ] see if I can get

936
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,760
higher than that I don't think I can

937
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,099
higher than that it can change and alter

938
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,040
and dance about when a fan or an air

939
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:50,040
conditioner is on it's like

940
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,040
right

941
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,300
all right

942
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:58,079
let's see

943
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,660
when someone has the high-pitched

944
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,700
ringing near it's not funny if they do

945
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,119
I'm just for some reason cracking myself

946
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,119
up

947
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,740
um can we edit that out no we can't

948
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,359
because we're live

949
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,579
when someone has that high-pitched

950
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,200
ringing in the ear it can change alter

951
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,540
and dance about what a fan or air

952
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,940
conditioner is on or when music is

953
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,579
playing some people experiencing the

954
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:26,359
experience with sounds like air rushing

955
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,359
through their ear

956
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,839
some people experiencing popping

957
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,300
like they're they're popping popcorn in

958
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,640
their ear tinnitus can vary from mild to

959
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,200
extreme often people get small moments

960
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,660
when they hear a ringing in their ear

961
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,880
and then it goes away like

962
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,920
is somebody talking about me I think

963
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,820
somebody honey is somebody talking about

964
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,780
me

965
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,359
is my friend talking about me

966
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,880
right is that an angel that was speaking

967
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:07,680
in my ear my ear rang is that a spirit

968
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,900
guide like what is that ringing the ear

969
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,359
this has been passed off as someone

970
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,099
speaking about you or Angelic forces are

971
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:17,220
speaking to you what most of these

972
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:19,920
people and you'll see what most this is

973
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:22,260
important this is why the words in the

974
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,960
medical medium books are so they're

975
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,640
detailed in their meaning

976
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,099
they're detailed in their understanding

977
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:33,060
this is incredible information right

978
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:36,660
I just said this has been passed off

979
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:40,500
as someone speaking about you when your

980
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,720
ear rings or Angelic forces are speaking

981
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,980
to you if you get a temporary like quick

982
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,119
earring

983
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,680
what most of these people why did I say

984
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,079
most

985
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,839
because it's possible

986
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,920
that an angel

987
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:02,820
is communicating it's possible that

988
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,540
someone is talking about you it is and

989
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:10,579
it's possible that could actually create

990
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,579
some frequency to your ear

991
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,040
but what most of these people who

992
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,660
experience passing tinnitus discovers

993
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,720
that eventually the ringing sticks

994
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:26,400
around a little longer and a little

995
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:31,160
longer and a little longer and a little

996
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,160
longer and then permanent Boop

997
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:36,540
and the whole time I thought someone was

998
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,040
just talking about me when it was

999
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,380
intermittent

1000
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,359
and the whole time I thought it was an

1001
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,640
angel trying to communicate because it

1002
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:46,619
was intermittent once in a blue moon I

1003
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,760
got a little ringing in the air but now

1004
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:54,680
five years later hot damn I got tinnitus

1005
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,680
it's ringing all the time

1006
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,760
they get to a point where they're past

1007
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,160
the whole phase of it must be a ghost or

1008
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,260
a spirit or an angel or someone talking

1009
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,400
about me and they realize they're

1010
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,400
developing a condition

1011
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,180
sometimes it takes years of intermittent

1012
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,220
ringing in the ears to be diagnosed with

1013
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,380
tinnitus many times hearing loss can

1014
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,440
occur with tinnitus because the ringing

1015
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,900
is so dominant in many situations even

1016
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,140
if the ringing isn't dominating hearing

1017
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,460
can also be lost I've seen bar is the

1018
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,500
number one reason why people have

1019
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,240
mystery tinnitus I talk about how it

1020
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,839
occurs yes I'm just trying to cut

1021
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,839
through some of this

1022
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,839
yep

1023
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:40,800
Lorraine now says mine is like a random

1024
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,880
movement in my left ear but has improved

1025
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,960
lately

1026
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,940
good good if your body's healing

1027
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,520
and you're doing things to heal your

1028
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:54,000
body they're really powerful

1029
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:56,700
other things are in the works of healing

1030
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,440
and sometimes some symptoms are left

1031
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,119
high and dry for a while

1032
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,060
important critical piece of information

1033
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,619
for anybody who's got chronic illness

1034
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,480
here

1035
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:08,400
anybody you know who has chronic illness

1036
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,680
Dr fine good to see you

1037
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,300
MD

1038
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,300
this is critical to know

1039
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:21,000
when your body's healing your immune

1040
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,900
system is taking care of business

1041
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,780
if it's given the tools it needs

1042
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:30,960
especially it's taking care of business

1043
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:33,300
if it's given tools it needs especially

1044
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,980
it's taking care of business right

1045
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,240
and when your immune system is taking

1046
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,280
care of business

1047
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,960
it's working on things you may not even

1048
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,960
know exist inside your body that are

1049
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,819
symptom or it's working on two or three

1050
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,000
symptoms and problems and sometimes some

1051
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:55,079
symptoms are going to be left alone for

1052
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,440
a while and high and dry or your immune

1053
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,900
system is fixing the problem fixing the

1054
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,200
ear ringing issue but the nerve has been

1055
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,500
injured by the Epstein-Barr virus and so

1056
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,440
now the Epstein-Barr virus is gone

1057
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,780
out of the ear

1058
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,359
because your immune system gobbled it up

1059
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:18,300
and your protocols killed it off

1060
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,420
but then you still got some tinnitus

1061
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,880
left over because the nerve channel has

1062
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,220
to heal the Damage Done to the nerve

1063
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,319
channel the inflammation that damaged

1064
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,780
the nerve channel from the virus has to

1065
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:34,440
heal so now it could take a long time

1066
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,900
for the body to repair repair the damage

1067
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,700
and what if you don't know the medical

1068
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,619
medium information good enough and you

1069
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,560
don't know other tools to use within it

1070
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:45,119
to repair damaged nerves so that's

1071
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,060
another reason why it takes longer for

1072
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,960
some people to heal because there's it's

1073
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:54,680
in here the secret sauce is in here in

1074
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,680
these books

1075
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,060
so yeah

1076
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,240
all right

1077
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:06,060
keep on rolling

1078
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:09,180
we're rolling

1079
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:12,000
okay anyway the protocol for tinnitus is

1080
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,380
inside brain saver protocol so I just

1081
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,859
want to get to that to the moment there

1082
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:19,140
it is what's that brainstorm circles

1083
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:22,099
juggling some books around right now

1084
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,099
there it is

1085
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:29,940
so

1086
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:32,099
I got a surprise coming up for you guys

1087
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,140
not going to say anything right now

1088
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:37,920
because I just have to make sure it's

1089
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:39,480
actually happening but I got a surprise

1090
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,579
that's gonna be cool

1091
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,560
it's gonna be something fun we could all

1092
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,940
do together

1093
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,359
that is

1094
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,280
incredibly life changing

1095
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:53,460
some of you are familiar with it already

1096
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,819
and may have partaken in it in the

1097
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:59,460
medical medium book series but I want to

1098
00:45:56,819 --> 00:46:01,380

we were working on it trying to make it

1116
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,260
happen

1117
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:47,280
in some so I want to talk about this for

1118
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,760
a second in some instances there is die

1119
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,160
off from pathogens that people feel

1120
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,839
you need to have a decent High viral

1121
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,940
load

1122
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,520
right and I see a lot of people out

1123
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,319
there that have

1124
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,760
um they don't really know what's

1125
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:06,300
happening they don't know they're really

1126
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:09,060
having a die off they don't know

1127
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,880
what's going on so that's something two

1128
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:14,640
I saw a question pop up about die off

1129
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,800
if someone is extremely

1130
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,060
viral

1131
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,040
right

1132
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,140
and people overuse the word detox so

1133
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,000
we're back on detox a little bit

1134
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,800
because I've been working on this detox

1135
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,300
podcast episode that eventually want to

1136
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,579
get out to you guys I'm just I'm not

1137
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,260
done with it but

1138
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:33,119
and you're gonna need some patience for

1139
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,180
that one because that one ain't no one

1140
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,599
hour podcast episode that one is gonna

1141
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:41,220
be like a three hour I don't know like

1142
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,920
it's insane

1143
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,800
so because anyway but the word detox is

1144
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,780
so abused and so misused

1145
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,060
and I told you the last time we did

1146
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,500
write this get-together right here in

1147
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,780
the Q a

1148
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,579
it's so misused

1149
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,619
because people don't know why people are

1150
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:01,140
sick and they don't know what's going on

1151
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:03,359
inside their body so it's the perfect

1152
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,640
out for a lot of people too oh you're

1153
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,920
detoxing oh you're getting much sicker

1154
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,859
and sicker sicker oh you're detoxing

1155
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,420
right and so and then the whole detox

1156
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:14,220
pathway thing oh you just don't know

1157
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,839
about the detox Pathways that you don't

1158
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:18,540
know about the detox Pathways either

1159
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:22,440
like you'll hear that out there

1160
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:24,660
but people have to understand that

1161
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,780
it all depends

1162
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:30,900
like you won't you'll rarely ever hear

1163
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:33,480
me use the word detox because I use the

1164
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,880
word cleansing because what you're

1165
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,400
really doing is you're cleansing out

1166
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,920
those impurities

1167
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,780
and you're doing it in a way that you

1168
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,880
can feel the least amount of symptoms if

1169
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,859
it's done properly and correctly and

1170
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,079
medical medium information does that

1171
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:51,300
because it's not man-made

1172
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:55,099
it's not like someone's saying take this

1173
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:57,900
take this I Got Dirt in here and I got

1174
00:48:55,099 --> 00:49:00,900
geophobic in here and I got and I got

1175
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,300
probiotics in here and I got you know I

1176
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,819
got bentonite clay in here I got clay in

1177
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,339
here and I even threw a little bit of

1178
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:10,680
Ayahuasca in here for emotional detox go

1179
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:12,720
ahead and take that down oh you're sick

1180
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:16,140
oh you're detoxing that's why we're sick

1181
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,780
from drinking that you're detoxing

1182
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:22,079
there's so much stupidity out there

1183
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:25,859
it's it's incredible so the whole point

1184
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,720
is is that is detox is thrown around as

1185
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:30,599
if it's just like this answer to

1186
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:33,359
everything no one understands and that's

1187
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:35,760
the sad part about detox but if you're

1188
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:37,680
really toxic in the sense where you're

1189
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,680
high viral load

1190
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:43,520
you're loaded with poisons and toxins in

1191
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,760
a sluggish stagnant liver

1192
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:49,020
if you do like protocols right cleansing

1193
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,540
right

1194
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:53,940
you might get some lethargy

1195
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,680
and I talk about that symptoms in the

1196
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,859
medical medium books

1197
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:01,319
but you're not going to get so sick and

1198
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:04,200
develop all of a sudden some crazy rash

1199
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:06,660
or some other thing that's

1200
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,700
because you were getting sick you were

1201
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,980
actually getting sick people don't

1202
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:13,440
realize they got a lot going on inside

1203
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,300
of them they're already heading to a

1204
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,980
place where they're getting sick they're

1205
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:20,880
already been sick

1206
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:23,160
and it's ketchup time and it's hard to

1207
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,319
catch up with a lot of people fast

1208
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,180
instant and overnight

1209
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:29,880
so that's a whole nother point that I

1210
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,740
didn't mention the other day

1211
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,579
here's something you never want to

1212
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,579
forget

1213
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:38,579
and I've seen this information used

1214
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:41,400
and it's not correct

1215
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:44,280
right is

1216
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,700
the medical medium cleanses are hard on

1217
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:51,420
the adrenals they're not hard on the

1218
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:53,400
adrenals that's misinformation what is

1219
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,040
hard on the adrenals

1220
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,380
is water fasting

1221
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,000
I'm not against and I talked about this

1222
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,119
short term

1223
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,819
short-term water fast if necessary

1224
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,460
for crises I've talked about that in the

1225
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:11,819
medical mean books but water fasting

1226
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:15,300
hard on these renals

1227
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:17,940
straight juice fasting only hard on the

1228
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:21,960
adrenals

1229
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:24,599
not getting enough calories

1230
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,280
okay is hard on the adrenals that's why

1231
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,900
medical medium information has the

1232
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,640
adrenal stacks

1233
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:35,339
that's why eating regularly

1234
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:38,160
is critical to sustain the adrenals

1235
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:41,599
that's why medical medium cleanses don't

1236
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,599
take away food

1237
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,700
because you take away food completely

1238
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,859
from somebody

1239
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:53,099
especially for so many reasons and boom

1240
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:56,579
that's hard on the adrenals

1241
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:58,859
so medical medium cleanses are designed

1242
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:01,440
from above

1243
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:04,020
to protect the adrenals that's the whole

1244
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,599
point to protect

1245
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:09,420
the adrenals

1246
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,000
and it's critical to know that

1247
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,700
chocolate

1248
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,880
destroys adrenals

1249
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:20,780
cacao hurts the adrenals caffeine hurts

1250
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,780
the adrenals

1251
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,559
Ayahuasca destroys and annihilates the

1252
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,300
adrenals

1253
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,119
I'm just saying these are some things

1254
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:33,300
right there okay

1255
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:36,540
high doses of apple cider vinegar hurt

1256
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:39,359
the adrenals by burning out the stomach

1257
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:42,180
glands and into and and in turn killing

1258
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:44,940
off your HCL which makes your adrenals

1259
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,940
work harder like there's so many things

1260
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:51,359
that injure adrenals Every Day High high

1261
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:54,079
fat diets every single day hurt the

1262
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,079
adrenals

1263
00:52:54,859 --> 00:53:01,559
betrayal hurts the adrenals

1264
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,319
emotional losses hurt the adrenals being

1265
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:06,420
stabbed in the back hurts the adrenals

1266
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:09,000
being emotionally triggered hurts the

1267
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,740
adrenals

1268
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,480
so

1269
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,740
these are all important things to

1270
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,260
understand MSG hurts the adrenals

1271
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:21,540
MSG

1272
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,640
hurt so these are all important things

1273
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:27,059
to know because what you'll see out

1274
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,440
there you'll say oh 369 cleanse it's too

1275
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:30,000
much on my it's too much in your

1276
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,000
adrenals it's designed to protect your

1277
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,920
adrenals restore that

1278
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,819
so when I hear this this is a little

1279
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,020
tough

1280
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:39,020
a little tough

1281
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:47,720
the monocleanse restores someone's

1282
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:51,180
damaged and burnt outage renals the 369

1283
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:54,000
protects and restores adrenals it's a

1284
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:56,220
big part of how someone recovers the

1285
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,119
heavy metal detox cleanses helps restore

1286
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:02,220
adrenals they're adrenal Savers adrenal

1287
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:05,160
restorers

1288
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:07,140
bring your backers

1289
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:10,079
but somebody might feel high and happy

1290
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:12,900
for a bit when they start tanking fats

1291
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:16,500
again where was where was this my whole

1292
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:19,020
life I was on the 369 for two months and

1293
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,720
I was just feeling lethargic

1294
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:24,720
what you're doing is you were healing

1295
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:27,720
deep deep deep inner core stuff your

1296
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,540
body was in the healing mode you're on

1297
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,760
the 369 if you do it correctly your body

1298
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:35,220
was in the healing mode

1299
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,559
chipping away at all those things that

1300
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:40,140
are freaking wrong inside the body and

1301
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,480
you're you're in the healing mode and

1302
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:45,000
then when you shut off that cleansing

1303
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,099
healing mode you were cleansing and

1304
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,940
healing and when you shut that cleansing

1305
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:52,559
and healing mode down that's a new move

1306
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:54,000
when you shut in that cleanse and

1307
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,099
healing mode down

1308
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,640
what happens is

1309
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:03,420
you get high high as a kite you're

1310
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:06,960
flying oh my God I had a slice of pizza

1311
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:09,960
I'm bringing in two avocados a day I

1312
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,900
just had some beans I just had beans and

1313
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:15,000
avocado I just had some oil I just had

1314
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:18,180
and what happened was you're hot

1315
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,640
freaking high as a kite buying Hezekiah

1316
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:24,260
because your adrenals were restored so

1317
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:29,220
much they were restored they're so

1318
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:31,440
jamming strong that when you dumped fat

1319
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:34,980
into your bloodstream

1320
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:38,819
or cacao into your bloodstream your

1321
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:41,220
adrenals were loaded and were like boom

1322
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:44,880
and you were like oh my God I'm euphoric

1323
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:49,500
I'm high you know screw that diet what

1324
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:52,260
the 369 was hard what meanwhile the 369

1325
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:55,500
restored those adrenals it did deep

1326
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:57,300
cleansing and deep healing

1327
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,700
and then

1328
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,980
you threw in all the fat

1329
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,900
and you threw in the cacao and your

1330
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:06,300
adrenals just freaking released a ton of

1331
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,160
adrenaline because the whole time you

1332
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,079
were burnt out all these years and

1333
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,059
you're doing the 369 and you're doing

1334
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,160
the cleanses in the 2018 cleanse because

1335
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:16,619
you're so freaking burnt out that your

1336
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,020
adrenals were fried

1337
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:21,240
and they restored and they restored

1338
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:23,040
Weeks Later months later they restored

1339
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,140
six months later they restored they

1340
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:28,559
finally restored and so when you went

1341
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:30,660
off the wagon and jumped into that slice

1342
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:33,300
of pizza that vegan pizza and those

1343
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:35,339
avocados heavy avocados and that tahini

1344
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,140
on your salad and those bean burritos

1345
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:39,540
and when you went into that you were

1346
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,460
high as a kite and you were feeling the

1347
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:45,260
effects of what you did for yourself

1348
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:45,260
healing and restoring yourself

1349
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,660
I'd be able to do that forever

1350
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:54,359
you might be somebody that needs more

1351
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:58,140
healing and you can only do it so long

1352
00:56:54,359 --> 00:57:02,339
before father time or father Christmas

1353
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:04,020
says Ah you were really sick years ago

1354
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:06,059
and you better get back on your

1355
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:08,599
protocols and your and your you know

1356
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:13,640
cleanses and you better get going

1357
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:13,640
because yeah you still got more to go

1358
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,460
can't tell you how many I see do that

1359
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,020
and they even hide

1360
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,700
what's going down because they don't

1361
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,740
want to be embarrassed so they can't be

1362
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,960
honest about stuff I'm not saying that

1363
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,280
no judgment it's just I've seen a lot of

1364
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,160
different stuff out there

1365
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:43,440
nerves need time to restore and heal

1366
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,720
central nervous systems need time to

1367
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,660
restore and heal

1368
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:53,660
adrenals need time to restore and heal

1369
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:53,660
but no way and nowhere

1370
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:59,400
our medical medium cleanse is actually

1371
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,140
there to harm an adrenal it's there to

1372
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,240
restore them and make them Rock Solid

1373
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:04,380
and I've witnessed it myself throughout

1374
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,440
the decades

1375
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:09,540
for a lot of people that literally were

1376
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,300
on steroids

1377
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:15,180
because they had no adrenals left and

1378
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,680
they had to do the 369 day in and day

1379
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,059
out and restore their adrenals until

1380
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:21,059
their doctor was like you don't even

1381
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:23,579
need injections anymore and boom

1382
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:25,559
so it's the opposite when people are

1383
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:27,900
immobile and lose a lot of their

1384
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:30,420
Mobility it can be harder to come back

1385
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:33,420
because they can't get

1386
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:38,299
they can't get you know where they need

1387
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:38,299
to be fast takes time

1388
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,480
when someone is bedridden or stuck in a

1389
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,460
wheelchair they can lose a lot of

1390
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,740
mobility and muscle and connected tissue

1391
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:53,579
and have a lot of problems

1392
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:55,260
from not being able to move much

1393
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:57,540
and that's something that happens to a

1394
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:00,180
lot of people so it takes time to heal

1395
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:02,940
and cleanse and rebuild nerves and get

1396
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:05,460
them strong enough to to rehab physical

1397
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,839
therapy and very sick people and when

1398
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,520
you do the medical medium stuff because

1399
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,920
medical medium stuff is for the really

1400
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:14,599
sick people so they can rehab and

1401
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,599
restore it takes time

1402
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,920
well anyway

1403
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,440
I'm speechless

1404
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:34,680
speechless

1405
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:37,500

brand saver

1409
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:46,520
protocols let's try to find it here

1410
00:59:46,859 --> 00:59:50,540
curious very curious

1411
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,020

keep up with everything the best I can

1415
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,880
but there's so much going on

1416
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,520

1417
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,319

together with Spirit of compassion's

1419
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,359
information of one human being

1420
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,960
trying my best

1421
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:23,599
seriously

1422
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,599
um

1423
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:30,500
and um all right so let's get into it

1424
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,500
right now

1425
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:34,200
and I'll apologize for flipping through

1426
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,099
me

1427
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,099
Pages here

1428
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:46,040
this is one chapter right there

1429
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:46,040
you guys have to read supplement gospel

1430
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,640
so I'm going to look into neurological

1431
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,980
symptoms like chest heightening throat

1432
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,940
tightening throat tightening okay we're

1433
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,940
going to go into that a little bit

1434
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,799
but

1435
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,780
um

1436
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:02,280
it there's another thing that pains me

1437
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,559
out there when someone says you don't

1438
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,160
need supplements

1439
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,160
dude

1440
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,720
there are people out there walking right

1441
01:01:10,859 --> 01:01:16,260
now and living their life because of

1442
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:18,240
supplementation added to their protocols

1443
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,160
without it

1444
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,859
baby screwed

1445
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:25,020
totally screwed

1446
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:27,660
there are people that if they didn't

1447
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:31,619
have the right tools

1448
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:34,920
they'd be riddled in pustules in their

1449
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:40,079
mouth their throat their vaginal area

1450
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:44,000
like if it wasn't for supplementation

1451
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,000
if it wasn't for supplementation

1452
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:47,059
forget it

1453
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,720
I don't

1454
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,400
appreciate blatant

1455
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,280
ignorance

1456
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,619
on the matter out there

1457
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:01,880
just because someone or somebody out

1458
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,880
there doesn't personally like me

1459
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,420
they don't like

1460
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:08,460
my tude or

1461
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,540
me as a person or they heard rumors and

1462
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,799
stories that aren't even real and

1463
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:13,819
they've convinced themselves they are

1464
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,819
whatever it is

1465
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:21,599
there are supplementation that freaking

1466
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:23,160
turn people's lives and it's critical

1467
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,319
so

1468
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,140
it

1469
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:30,359
biased personal

1470
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:33,420
vendettas or whatever and influencers

1471
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:35,099
all through social media or wherever I

1472
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,200
don't like medical medium whatever it

1473
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:38,819
has whatever it is

1474
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,000
that don't

1475
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:44,160
actually say that it's not all

1476
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,140
supplements that are bad

1477
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,359
there's so many that have all this red

1478
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,799
dye and all this garbage and gluten and

1479
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:51,480
soy and everything else and that's just

1480
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:53,640
some and there's some that just have all

1481
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,260
the gelatin and all that garbage in it

1482
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,299
whatever then there's some that are just

1483
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,920
that don't have that in there but are

1484
01:02:57,299 --> 01:03:00,480
just straight out bad like bentonite

1485
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,420
clay and charcoal and all that other

1486
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,700
stuff but no one's no one's kind of like

1487
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,400
breaking that down so people can learn

1488
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:10,020
these are all supplements are bad you

1489
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,540
don't need it you just need food really

1490
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,619
you just need food because yeah there

1491
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:15,839
are people out there that just need

1492
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:17,099
celery juice and their acid reflux is

1493
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,839
gone forever

1494
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:20,640
but then that's that person there's that

1495
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:22,319
Mom that's bedridden that has kids and

1496
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,720
they they and the kids are like Mommy

1497
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:27,240
why are you in bed for eight hours a day

1498
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,480
and there's those moms that if they

1499
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:33,799
didn't have the right tools they'd still

1500
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,799
be bedridden God forbid

1501
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:40,380
so

1502
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:42,780
the whole kind of like misunderstanding

1503
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,760
the attack on supplementation is

1504
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:46,980
completely the confusing process of that

1505
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:49,579
is just unbelievable

1506
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,579
so

1507
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:05,540
there are times you need it time Stone

1508
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:11,540
I'm going to read a little bit of this

1509
01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:11,540

like you're talking about like why I'm

1514
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,740
acting like hanging because I haven't

1515
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,740

but some of you guys are like what

1518
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,260
happened to him and why is he going into

1519
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,359
what he's going into why is he talking

1520
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:44,940
like I'm just saying it's because of the

1521
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:46,200
celery Force I haven't been taking it in

1522
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,760
a while

1523
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:51,420
I ran out

1524
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:54,119
and then I took a bunch before I came on

1525
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,740
this live and it kicked in I took it

1526
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:58,079
right before I came on and it finally

1527
01:04:55,740 --> 01:05:01,380
kicked in I don't know about you but for

1528
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:03,000
me it makes my brain go into a different

1529
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:06,140
place

1530
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,140

1531
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,180
okay

1532
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:13,680
because of the vagus nerves size and

1533
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,780
reach

1534
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,180

the whole than other cranial nerves

1546
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:51,240
these vagus nerve symptoms that result

1547
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:54,980
from an inflamed brain stem could

1548
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,980
include tightness of the chest

1549
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:58,940
tightness of the throat

1550
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,859
I feel bad for anybody going through any

01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:05,339
of this

1552
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:07,680
just kills me mild dizziness and

grape vine

1561
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,660
when vagus nerve inflammation is

1562
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:40,400
stemming from higher up like this from

1563
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,400
the brain stem itself

1564
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:47,010
from the brain stem itself

[Music]

1566
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:57,420
maybe I didn't have to take you apart

1567
01:06:54,180 --> 01:07:00,660
from the brain stem itself

1568
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:04,260
it could be a little bit of everything

1569
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:06,720
if the inflammation is in the brain stem

1570
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:08,160
itself it could be a little a little bit

1571
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,200
of everything difficulty swallowing

1572
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,420
digestive problems anxiety pressure in

1573
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,220
the chest imbalance feeling mild

1574
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:17,119
dizziness tightness of the throat

1575
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:17,119
tightness of the chest

1576
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,260
I shouldn't have taken that much celery

1577
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:29,160
for us before coming on

1578
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:31,319
I just threw an extra bunch in

1579
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,119
who's counting

1580
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:34,980
when vagus nerve inflammation is

1581
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,780
stemming from higher up like that it can

1582
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:40,140
do that

1583
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:42,720
as inflammation Ebbs and flows in the

1584
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,280
brain stem from mild to more severe some

1585
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,900
of the inflammation will lessen are

1586
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:48,720
intensified on the Vegas they're a great

1587
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,220
fine inflammation can come and go based

1588
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,280
on whether someone was getting more

1589
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:55,520
sleep or lacking sleep

1590
01:07:53,280 --> 01:08:00,180
because when you sleep

1591
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:02,480
your vagus nerve calms down it calms

1592
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,480
down

1593
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:09,839
just so much Vegas Urban I'll do a Vegas

1594
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:12,180
nerve show

1595
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:15,299
or a podcast or whatever eventually but

1596
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:17,940
yeah so back to that question

1597
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:21,960
someone's dealing with tightness of the

1598
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:24,500
throat tightness of the chest

1599
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,500
yep

1600
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:31,679
information that's critical you guys

1601
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,960
oh wait we got another question here IG

1602
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,839
how to stay a little positive and

1603
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:40,140
motivated to keep healing after breaking

1604
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:42,060
some rolls in bad conditions that you're

1605
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:45,380
bringing some rules

1606
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:48,900
you mean breaking protocol

1607
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:50,160
breaking cleanse

1608
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,500
um

1609
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:56,040
first of all critical to know no

1610
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,540
judgment ever ever

1611
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,940
no judgment

1612
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:01,199
okay life is hard

1613
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:04,440
life

1614
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:07,739
is hard if it

1615
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:10,500
if someone doesn't believe life is hard

1616
01:09:07,739 --> 01:09:11,940
they're either totally bullshitting

1617
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,779
themselves

1618
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,779
or

1619
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:25,040
more money than God they have

1620
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:25,040
with very little stress if any

1621
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,980
either or life is hard there's a lot of

1622
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:34,319
Temptations around us there's peer

1623
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:36,500
pressure there's hard times we're up

1624
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,500
against

1625
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,460
a lot of people go through a lot

1626
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:46,980
and that's that's on all accounts

1627
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:49,199
for anyone and everyone

1628
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:50,759
I've seen spiritual gurus throughout the

1629
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:53,580
decades

1630
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:55,679
that anyone would think they have it all

1631
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:59,219
down and nothing could ever harm them or

1632
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:02,520
happen to them meanwhile

1633
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:05,699
the crap they go through as they keep it

1634
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:08,880
quiet is unbelievable there's

1635
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:10,380
life isn't easy

1636
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,739
but that's okay

1637
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:16,520
we Forge ahead we stay strong and fight

1638
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:18,960
for it the key the key is to be

1639
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,219
compassionate and realistic about what

1640
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,219
happened

1641
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:25,020
don't be upset don't get upset if you

1642
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,760
get a little set back from it get right

1643
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:29,340
back on track when you get a chance but

1644
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:32,719
the keys to be compassionate

1645
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:32,719
and easy on yourself

1646
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,580
look

1647
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:44,100
let me get right back on it

1648
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:47,159
look I I look I'm guilty of a lot of

1649
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:49,860
things one of the things I'm guilty of

1650
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:53,340
is if I'm working too hard on something

1651
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:58,100
for too many hours I won't

1652
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:58,100
get something I need to eat

1653
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:06,179
so that's kind of like a mistake that I

1654
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:09,060
make even with SOC in my ear saying you

1655
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:11,280
just passed another two hours without

1656
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:12,960
getting some glucose in your bloodstream

1657
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,960
for your brain because you're thinking

1658
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,840
like intensely you're you're working on

1659
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,940
a project and you're so involved in that

1660
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,500
project you just literally it's four or

1661
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:24,900
