[2.88 - 7.62] foreign
[4.86 - 8.64] we're talking about how to protect your
[7.62 - 10.62] brain
[8.64 - 13.14] which I think is a very important thing
[10.62 - 15.06] when you think about it because we live
[13.14 - 17.22] in a world where
[15.06 - 19.62] no one really cares about protecting
[17.22 - 22.38] people's brains well you know we don't
[19.62 - 24.72] want to get hit in the head
[22.38 - 27.06] so there's always that right
[24.72 - 28.32] football players wear helmets
[27.06 - 31.98] right
[28.32 - 34.92] boxers wear gloves even though you could
[31.98 - 36.66] mess up somebody really bad the boxing
[34.92 - 38.64] arena either way
[36.66 - 41.10] the point is is protecting your brain
[38.64 - 43.86] it's more than that it's more than just
[41.10 - 47.04] our head getting clobbered on a ski
[43.86 - 48.18] slope because of an accident or anything
[47.04 - 49.98] else
[48.18 - 52.20] I'm talking about protecting our brain
[49.98 - 53.58] in so many other ways
[52.20 - 54.78] you guys we're also talking about the
[53.58 - 56.16] life last a little bit because I just
[54.78 - 57.78] want to give you the forewarning right
[56.16 - 61.38] now
[57.78 - 64.74] tomorrow 12 o'clock Eastern nine o'clock
[61.38 - 67.32] Pacific you're gonna get the invite
[64.74 - 70.38] so you're going to get the link to sign
[67.32 - 73.26] up to the light blast
[70.38 - 74.76] there's only going to be 20 000 people
[73.26 - 77.16] allowed
[74.76 - 81.12] at this light blast event
[77.16 - 82.32] the only way to receive that invite or
[81.12 - 84.60] that link
[82.32 - 85.98] is to be signed up to the medical medium
[84.60 - 87.54] newsletter
[85.98 - 88.80] so I want you to know that's how it
[87.54 - 91.62] works
[88.80 - 94.26] so that's tomorrow so sign up to the
[91.62 - 96.24] medical medium newsletter now so you can
[94.26 - 98.46] be there alive
[96.24 - 101.52] for that light blast but you're going to
[98.46 - 104.76] get the invite tomorrow and only 20 000
[101.52 - 109.08] people are going to be allowed to sign
[104.76 - 111.84] up for this light blast event
[109.08 - 113.70] now an important question because people
[111.84 - 115.74] are asking that how much is it going to
[113.70 - 117.90] cost how much is it going to cost it's
[115.74 - 120.00] free it's free
[117.90 - 121.74] the question is how much is it going to
[120.00 - 123.42] cost for me
[121.74 - 125.40] and that's the question
[123.42 - 127.38] I have a team of people working I have
[125.40 - 128.16] to pay them it's costing thousands of
[127.38 - 130.26] dollars
[128.16 - 132.96] I have to get the whole system set up
[130.26 - 136.14] for it it's a major Endeavor it's a
[132.96 - 139.02] major project it's going to cost me a
[136.14 - 142.98] lot of money I still don't even know
[139.02 - 145.44] that's how much it costs it's free
[142.98 - 146.94] for everybody else that that's attending
[145.44 - 149.58] this light blast
[146.94 - 151.02] so I want to make that clear
[149.58 - 152.58] um it's going to cost me tens of
[151.02 - 155.04] thousands actually
[152.58 - 157.68] so but the thing is it's just like all
[155.04 - 159.48] medical meme information it's free get
[157.68 - 161.76] the book of the library
[159.48 - 163.98] it's like all medical the podcast it's
[161.76 - 167.58] another thing it's free and that's what
[163.98 - 169.08] we do it's a mission that I have in my
[167.58 - 172.38] heart and soul
[169.08 - 174.00] it's critical that I can do as much free
[172.38 - 176.46] as possible
[174.00 - 179.22] whatever I can in this lifetime
[176.46 - 181.80] the light blast will not be tomorrow
[179.22 - 183.12] I just want to make that clear the light
[181.80 - 185.64] blast
[183.12 - 187.86] will be another time it's the
[185.64 - 190.14] registration is tomorrow
[187.86 - 191.64] so you have to be on the medical medium
[190.14 - 194.04] newsletter you have to sign up for the
[191.64 - 196.44] medical name newsletter so you can
[194.04 - 199.08] receive the invite
[196.44 - 202.80] keep that in mind the invite is tomorrow
[199.08 - 204.48] and I'm only going to allow 20 000
[202.80 - 205.98] people because that's all our system can
[204.48 - 208.44] actually hold that we're building and
[205.98 - 211.14] doing right now the system that's
[208.44 - 213.24] costing thousands of dollars for me to
[211.14 - 213.96] get done so I can do this lifeblast for
[213.24 - 215.10] free
[213.96 - 217.74] now
[215.10 - 219.60] I'm not trying to throw
[217.74 - 221.88] like a guilt thing about it's costing me
[219.60 - 225.24] a lot of money that's not it at all it's
[221.88 - 228.06] because people are expecting to pay
[225.24 - 231.24] and I want them to know they don't have
[228.06 - 233.52] to pay it's free so I want them to know
[231.24 - 236.04] that that's important but yeah it's not
[233.52 - 238.74] free for me of course I mean that's just
[236.04 - 241.08] the way it works but
[238.74 - 242.64] anyway so there's all kinds of questions
[241.08 - 245.04] coming through
[242.64 - 247.20] what is the light blast so that's a
[245.04 - 249.96] question a meditation
[247.20 - 251.10] please let me know so if you've learned
[249.96 - 254.88] okay
[251.10 - 258.60] if you've been following medical medium
[254.88 - 259.92] for years you'll know that during Live
[258.60 - 262.32] Events
[259.92 - 265.68] I would do a light blast
[262.32 - 269.82] now the light isn't coming from me
[265.68 - 273.60] on the messenger I'm guiding it I'm
[269.82 - 276.54] helping the process the light comes from
[273.60 - 278.46] Spirit of compassion so when we would do
[276.54 - 280.56] lectures where there would be thousands
[278.46 - 283.08] of people in the audience
[280.56 - 286.50] we would actually Spirit of compassion
[283.08 - 287.94] and I do a light Blast for everybody so
[286.50 - 290.22] everybody's sitting down in the audience
[287.94 - 291.96] or standing up in the audience would
[290.22 - 293.94] receive this light
[291.96 - 296.64] and it would hit the top of their head
[293.94 - 299.10] and come down from above so if you have
[296.64 - 304.62] a question about what is the light blast
[299.10 - 307.44] now it is a it is a tool from above that
[304.62 - 309.24] I have been taught to be a part of since
[307.44 - 311.46] I was a child
[309.24 - 313.74] going all the way back as a child
[311.46 - 314.88] if I would come across a wounded
[313.74 - 316.98] creature
[314.88 - 318.66] like a turtle that got hit on the side
[316.98 - 321.66] of the road
[318.66 - 324.96] or an animal that was injured or a
[321.66 - 327.42] grasshopper with a broken leg when I was
[324.96 - 329.34] a child Spirit of compassion taught me
[327.42 - 331.62] how to do this light blast
[329.34 - 333.48] and that and the how Spirit of
[331.62 - 336.60] compassion would send the light down on
[333.48 - 339.36] the grasshopper on the injured turtle
[336.60 - 342.72] I'm the injured creature and so forth
[339.36 - 345.36] or on the person when I got a little
[342.72 - 347.04] older and I was working on people
[345.36 - 348.96] one-on-one
[347.04 - 351.12] in my office
[348.96 - 353.94] many many years ago
[351.12 - 355.32] I would even I swear to compassion do
[353.94 - 358.50] the light blast
[355.32 - 360.84] on specific people in the office
[358.50 - 363.42] for what was ailing them and and hurting
[360.84 - 366.60] them emotionally mentally spiritually
[363.42 - 369.60] and physically and so that late last
[366.60 - 371.34] would happen in the office now
[369.60 - 373.74] I would do it also at lectures
[371.34 - 374.70] throughout the years too that was the
[373.74 - 377.52] other thing
[374.70 - 380.52] so and some of you guys might have been
[377.52 - 385.56] around long enough to attend a lecture
[380.52 - 387.84] that I've done in 2013 or 2014 or 2010
[385.56 - 391.74] or whatever and you might have been
[387.84 - 393.60] there to one of these events where
[391.74 - 396.30] Spirit of compassion sent the light down
[393.60 - 397.26] during that event on top of thousands of
[396.30 - 399.06] people
[397.26 - 401.88] and then people have these profound
[399.06 - 403.92] experiences because of this light
[401.88 - 405.12] so that's the light blast now but I just
[403.92 - 406.92] wanted to because I'm seeing more and
[405.12 - 409.62] more people come on right now
[406.92 - 411.12] the only way to actually be a part of
[409.62 - 412.62] this light blast
[411.12 - 414.48] is you have to sign up to the medical
[412.62 - 416.76] medium newsletter the link is in the
[414.48 - 418.62] profile link is in the description so
[416.76 - 420.18] sign up to the medical medium newsletter
[418.62 - 422.46] I'm saying this because here's what's
[420.18 - 425.58] going to happen and here
[422.46 - 427.26] here's the sad part A whole bunch of
[425.58 - 429.36] people are going to miss it and they're
[427.26 - 430.26] not going to be there and it breaks my
[429.36 - 432.90] heart
[430.26 - 434.16] because this is not like this easy thing
[432.90 - 436.50] to do
[434.16 - 439.74] it's going to take a lot of energy out
[436.50 - 441.54] of me I'm going going to go blind during
[439.74 - 443.58] the process so I don't know if you guys
[441.54 - 445.92] know medical meme information
[443.58 - 449.10] I don't know if you know medical medium
[445.92 - 452.22] books right that's the uh I talk a
[449.10 - 455.22] little bit about how things work

[455.22 - 461.46] an expanded New Edition
[458.28 - 464.04] but so it's really intense but the sad
[461.46 - 466.20] part and this is not a public event
[464.04 - 469.20] very important to know
[466.20 - 472.92] it will not be broadcasted on my normal

[499.44 - 507.90] channels and there will not be a replay

[507.90 - 510.96] moment

[510.96 - 514.38] the light down on everybody who has
[513.30 - 516.60] signed up

[516.60 - 523.38] so in my profile and in my my bio my uh

[556.02 - 560.58] I do know because because one of the
[558.54 - 563.16] reasons why it's so costly because I
[560.58 - 564.06] don't want to charge I don't want to
[563.16 - 566.16] charge
[564.06 - 567.78] and I know that there's a lot of people
[566.16 - 569.46] in the spiritual movement there's a lot
[567.78 - 570.84] of people out there and authors and
[569.46 - 572.88] things and people and they charge for
[570.84 - 574.98] everything everything doesn't matter
[572.88 - 576.60] what it is and they do groups of people
[574.98 - 578.22] and they charge for this and that all
[576.60 - 580.86] that stuff and I get it
[578.22 - 585.96] but this we're talking about the

[765.78 - 768.72] see the mission
[766.92 - 770.40] that's been the mission
[768.72 - 772.92] that's what it's about
[770.40 - 776.04] and very important to know
[772.92 - 778.02] I think Dr nesbitt's page is actually Dr
[776.04 - 780.48] nesbit's thing is frozen there so we'll
[778.02 - 782.82] take a look at that but anyway
[780.48 - 784.32] so let's let's talk about um the medical
[782.82 - 787.50] meme podcast for a couple of seconds
[784.32 - 789.48] more it's a swelling episode which is
[787.50 - 792.72] really important it's body swelling
[789.48 - 795.24] fluid retention edema lymphedema tissue
[792.72 - 797.54] expansion so what you'll hear on that
[795.24 - 797.54] episode
[797.76 - 802.62] is it's not just about when we get
[801.06 - 806.64] bloated
[802.62 - 807.72] it's not just about when we have weight
[806.64 - 809.52] gain
[807.72 - 812.82] and there's a lot of confusion with that
[809.52 - 815.16] we're talking about tissue expansion
[812.82 - 816.84] that's medical medium information just
[815.16 - 818.52] so you know so it's not like oh I can
[816.84 - 821.16] hear about swelling or bloating
[818.52 - 823.56] somewhere else or let me go look online
[821.16 - 825.66] and find something about oh 10 ways to
[823.56 - 827.22] de-swell or whatever that's not what
[825.66 - 829.32] we're talking about first of all medical
[827.22 - 831.18] meme information does all that
[829.32 - 832.62] so you can actually get rid of a lot of
[831.18 - 834.60] people heal their bloating they heal
[832.62 - 836.76] their sibo they heal all their different
[834.60 - 838.26] problems they heal their HCL problems
[836.76 - 840.60] and all that
[838.26 - 842.82] but what this episode is and it's a
[840.60 - 844.86] mind-blowing episode information from
[842.82 - 848.42] Spirit to compassion of course it's all
[844.86 - 850.32] original unique info is in that episode
[848.42 - 852.24] that you're going to hear a medical meme
[850.32 - 853.68] podcast at Apple podcast
[852.24 - 856.80] is that
[853.68 - 859.68] it's about tissue expansion
[856.80 - 861.30] I talk about how everything enlarges in
[859.68 - 863.40] us as we get older
[861.30 - 866.22] we enlarge
[863.40 - 867.72] we're not supposed to enlarge and then
[866.22 - 869.34] people will pass that off as being
[867.72 - 872.34] overweight now you can have weight
[869.34 - 875.22] issues and be overweight and have tissue
[872.34 - 878.88] expansion so you can still have tissue
[875.22 - 882.30] expansion and be overweight
[878.88 - 884.34] but what the health professionals do not
[882.30 - 885.54] know and doctors and other health
[884.34 - 886.74] professionals out there all kind
[885.54 - 888.60] alternative health professionals
[886.74 - 891.72] everybody what they don't know
[888.60 - 894.78] is that there's an actual deep rooted
[891.72 - 897.54] tissue expansion
[894.78 - 899.16] and that's happening inside our body and
[897.54 - 900.90] it's not doesn't even have to be linked
[899.16 - 903.30] to inflammation you might be like oh
[900.90 - 905.40] that's inflammation no it doesn't
[903.30 - 909.00] doesn't actually equate to inflammation
[905.40 - 910.92] it's real physical tissue expansion
[909.00 - 913.08] occurring
[910.92 - 914.82] and so when you listen to the medical
[913.08 - 917.96] meme podcast
[914.82 - 920.82] okay talking about lymphedema edema
[917.96 - 922.02] tissue expansion all of it when you
[920.82 - 924.06] listen to that
[922.02 - 926.28] you're going to hear information that
[924.06 - 929.58] nobody knows and it's mind-blowing it's
[926.28 - 931.32] important to know this is why people
[929.58 - 934.02] get bigger
[931.32 - 936.18] even if they're not even overweight they
[934.02 - 938.34] get bigger everything gets bigger
[936.18 - 940.98] Everything grows on them as they get
[938.34 - 942.60] older this is critical information that
[940.98 - 944.22] is new and original from Spirit of
[942.60 - 946.92] compassion about how the lymphatic
[944.22 - 948.84] system and fluid actually works inside
[946.92 - 949.68] the body and that's mind-blowing too so
[948.84 - 951.48] what you're going to hear about
[949.68 - 953.70] lymphatic information you don't hear
[951.48 - 955.08] anywhere else is going to be in this
[953.70 - 956.70] episode
[955.08 - 958.14] so if you just came on here to see a
[956.70 - 960.36] bunch of new people coming on right now
[958.14 - 962.58] I'm talking right now about the medical
[960.36 - 964.92] mean podcast a new episode I released
[962.58 - 967.02] about tissue expansion swelling
[964.92 - 969.36] lymphedema all of it
[967.02 - 971.22] but what's really incredible is I talk
[969.36 - 973.32] about the lymphatic system information
[971.22 - 975.78] nobody knows about the lymphatic system
[973.32 - 978.42] that when you hear it you'll go like it
[975.78 - 981.18] makes so much sense Happy Lemon healing
[978.42 - 982.86] says on IG right now the podcast was
[981.18 - 984.30] amazing
[982.86 - 987.06] incredible

[987.06 - 992.88] joints connective tissue tendons
[990.42 - 994.56] ligaments
[992.88 - 998.18] your head
[994.56 - 1001.22] all of it such important information
[998.18 - 1003.38] says I learned a lot about swelling such
[1001.22 - 1005.00] an important info explained beautifully

[1015.62 - 1019.46] medical name podcast at Apple Apple
[1017.30 - 1021.32] podcast Sophie says should we prepare
[1019.46 - 1023.72] for the light blast somehow
[1021.32 - 1026.54] you don't have to prepare
[1023.72 - 1028.70] I mean you can do look you can do a lot
[1026.54 - 1030.62] it doesn't it's
[1028.70 - 1033.32] the kind of thing where you don't of
[1030.62 - 1037.28] course want to
[1033.32 - 1038.60] be out of your head before it meaning in
[1037.28 - 1041.00] a sense where you just rolled in off the
[1038.60 - 1042.32] road you're
[1041.00 - 1043.70] you know you just came from the store
[1042.32 - 1045.02] you're putting away groceries while
[1043.70 - 1046.76] you're trying to do the white while
[1045.02 - 1048.86] you're trying to receive the light blast
[1046.76 - 1050.48] you can do that if you want you can be
[1048.86 - 1052.52] rolling right through the door putting
[1050.48 - 1054.50] away groceries while it's happening and
[1052.52 - 1056.96] you're listening you can do that what
[1054.50 - 1059.18] I'm saying is preparing would be
[1056.96 - 1062.24] probably just really basic stuff
[1059.18 - 1064.64] it would be relaxing
[1062.24 - 1067.40] sitting down and chilling
[1064.64 - 1069.86] whatever getting your your lemon balm
[1067.40 - 1072.32] getting your lemon balm out you know
[1069.86 - 1074.06] like the lemon balm tea that I always do
[1072.32 - 1075.44] now which is this way instead it's
[1074.06 - 1078.92] taking the lemon balm and actually
[1075.44 - 1081.14] putting it right in uh water like that
[1078.92 - 1083.18] that's what I'm going to be doing you're

[1583.52 - 1587.36] people
[1584.54 - 1589.94] that did not even know about it or
[1587.36 - 1592.34] thought they didn't have to sign up
[1589.94 - 1594.86] it's sad right
[1592.34 - 1596.60] okay our brains and bodies have not
[1594.86 - 1599.24] betrayed us they've they've been
[1596.60 - 1601.58] betrayed by industrial chemicals and
[1599.24 - 1603.98] other contaminants in our everyday lives
[1601.58 - 1606.26] that have only accelerated in
[1603.98 - 1609.08] development in recent years so just in
[1606.26 - 1610.64] recent years the air fresheners have
[1609.08 - 1612.86] gotten deadly
[1610.64 - 1615.14] people don't realize this if you're
[1612.86 - 1616.76] somebody who really is sensitive that
[1615.14 - 1619.16] you have been sick already and
[1616.76 - 1621.20] struggling and you're breathing in the
[1619.16 - 1622.82] air fresheners that have been created by
[1621.20 - 1625.88] the chemical Labs that are happening
[1622.82 - 1629.18] today I can't even tell you how bad that
[1625.88 - 1632.54] stuff is it is horrendous on our nervous
[1629.18 - 1634.96] system on our central nervous system
[1632.54 - 1636.98] it is
[1634.96 - 1638.24] horrifying on our central nervous system
[1636.98 - 1639.86] very important to know the air
[1638.24 - 1643.28] fresheners and then they're making
[1639.86 - 1646.10] detergents now that last extra long
[1643.28 - 1648.98] oh you don't have to worry our detergent
[1646.10 - 1652.22] even gets stronger when you touch your
[1648.98 - 1655.64] garment when you touch your shirt then
[1652.22 - 1658.94] you get a smell it all over again these
[1655.64 - 1661.88] chemical concoctions are unreal and
[1658.94 - 1664.40] we're under assault right now from these
[1661.88 - 1667.16] chemical concoctions
[1664.40 - 1668.48] the detergents the air fresheners the
[1667.16 - 1669.92] scented candles you know what happened
[1668.48 - 1672.44] with the whole thing
[1669.92 - 1674.12] right a couple years ago scented candles
[1672.44 - 1677.18] have always been out there poisoning
[1674.12 - 1680.48] people but what I noticed is they
[1677.18 - 1683.30] exploded on Instagram they exploded on
[1680.48 - 1685.64] social media platforms scented candles
[1683.30 - 1687.02] Galore exploded everybody was just
[1685.64 - 1689.00] burning them because they were all felt
[1687.02 - 1691.40] like they were stuck at home
[1689.00 - 1692.66] right in the last couple years and
[1691.40 - 1693.86] they're burning their scented candles
[1692.66 - 1696.20] and what they're doing is they're
[1693.86 - 1697.10] burning out their brain they don't know
[1696.20 - 1699.98] it
[1697.10 - 1701.66] they don't know it but they are
[1699.98 - 1704.18] literally burning their scented candles
[1701.66 - 1705.32] and taking years off their life for down
[1704.18 - 1709.04] the road
[1705.32 - 1710.42] years of quality living off their life
[1709.04 - 1713.36] and they're burning all their scented
[1710.42 - 1715.70] candles so our brains are under this
[1713.36 - 1719.66] attack this assault
[1715.70 - 1722.36] it's not our brains and bodies that have
[1719.66 - 1724.46] betrayed us it is the industrial
[1722.36 - 1726.40] chemicals and other contaminants in our
[1724.46 - 1729.50] everyday lives that have only
[1726.40 - 1731.12] accelerated the problem in the recent
[1729.50 - 1733.10] years
[1731.12 - 1734.96] what we're going to explore in this
[1733.10 - 1736.82] chapter ahead in these chapters ahead
[1734.96 - 1739.64] are the brain betrayers we're up against
[1736.82 - 1743.60] every day the ones that challenge and
[1739.64 - 1746.00] defy our immune systems like killing our
[1743.60 - 1747.98] immune systems the one thing isn't oh
[1746.00 - 1750.08] low immune system oh you need immune
[1747.98 - 1751.46] system support oh immune system immune
[1750.08 - 1754.82] system how about
[1751.46 - 1758.48] we're killing our immune cells they die
[1754.82 - 1760.46] they explode they die they can't handle
[1758.48 - 1763.34] the load and that's what's happening too
[1760.46 - 1765.38] is people are under siege their immune
[1763.34 - 1767.54] systems are their white blood cells are
[1765.38 - 1769.88] dying their lymphocytes are dying their
[1767.54 - 1772.40] monocytes their neutrophones they're all
[1769.88 - 1774.68] of it is dying in people and then the
[1772.40 - 1776.48] bone marrow can't produce it enough and
[1774.68 - 1777.86] then when you're sick what do you do you
[1776.48 - 1779.42] go to the doctor and you get more blood
[1777.86 - 1781.40] drawn and you weaken your immune system
[1779.42 - 1784.16] more this is Advanced information only
[1781.40 - 1786.38] in brain saver brain saver protocols
[1784.16 - 1788.30] right here
[1786.38 - 1789.68] guess what's on the menu today I know
[1788.30 - 1791.42] many times we have all kinds of
[1789.68 - 1794.12] different wild foods and fruits and
[1791.42 - 1795.80] herbs all placed in the front of the
[1794.12 - 1797.84] medical medium lives but on the menu
[1795.80 - 1800.18] today is brain saver we have brain saver
[1797.84 - 1802.48] and brain saver protocols they're very
[1800.18 - 1806.30] delicious I hope you enjoy them
[1802.48 - 1808.04] wait till you sink a fork into those you
[1806.30 - 1809.66] will be
[1808.04 - 1811.58] and you guys there's a lot of
[1809.66 - 1813.44] information in here it's too much it's
[1811.58 - 1815.30] incredible too much it's just absorbing
[1813.44 - 1816.74] one day you can be reading these books
[1815.30 - 1819.68] for years
[1816.74 - 1822.98] Sophie said I just spent two weeks
[1819.68 - 1824.96] with my dad he's a nutritionist and he
[1822.98 - 1827.72] thinks that weight gain is only due to
[1824.96 - 1829.28] excess calories and lack of exercise he
[1827.72 - 1831.98] thinks I eat too much
[1829.28 - 1834.86] that is a common mistake
[1831.98 - 1836.36] made by so many people nutritionists and
[1834.86 - 1838.64] RDS
[1836.36 - 1841.10] right that registered dietitians I love
[1838.64 - 1843.38] when registered dietitians say uh you
[1841.10 - 1845.72] shouldn't drink celery juice celery
[1843.38 - 1848.54] juice is not good for you offers nothing
[1845.72 - 1850.28] because science never whatever science
[1848.54 - 1853.10] doesn't know I mean science hasn't done
[1850.28 - 1855.80] a study on celery juice yet so how is in
[1853.10 - 1857.48] a registered dietitian even able to say
[1855.80 - 1860.18] anything about celery juice when science
[1857.48 - 1862.22] has even done a study that's a whole
[1860.18 - 1863.84] other story but it's really a joke when
[1862.22 - 1865.10] you think about all of it
[1863.84 - 1866.90] all right
[1865.10 - 1868.94] let's go into it
[1866.90 - 1870.50] the ones that take up residence in our
[1868.94 - 1872.06] brain tissue the ones that contaminate
[1870.50 - 1873.50] our neurons and neurotransmitters so
[1872.06 - 1874.94] we're talking about is brain betrayers
[1873.50 - 1877.58] the ones that destroy our immune system
[1874.94 - 1879.32] and blow it up and kill it
[1877.58 - 1881.90] the brain betrayers that get into our
[1879.32 - 1883.28] neurons and absolutely short-circuit and
[1881.90 - 1884.60] Destroy neurons that actually kill
[1883.28 - 1886.52] neurons
[1884.60 - 1890.18] rainbow traders that get into our
[1886.52 - 1892.84] central nervous system as well just
[1890.18 - 1892.84] incredible information
[1892.88 - 1897.80] if he says after two weeks of taking the
[1894.98 - 1900.62] brain shots for nerve shifter and Trauma
[1897.80 - 1902.90] shock loss stabilizer incredible I am
[1900.62 - 1905.84] proud to finally be free of my addiction
[1902.90 - 1907.22] to psychedelics like mushrooms in
[1905.84 - 1909.88] ayahuasca
[1907.22 - 1913.88] thank you mm
[1909.88 - 1918.20] that made my day to be free from the
[1913.88 - 1922.10] chains of drugs
[1918.20 - 1924.62] to be not a slave to drugs
[1922.10 - 1927.70] oh my God and don't be telling me
[1924.62 - 1927.70] ayahuas is not a drug
[1927.80 - 1932.84] I'm not judging anybody for being on it
[1930.08 - 1935.06] I'm just saying it actually is the point
[1932.84 - 1938.24] is is you're free from it
[1935.06 - 1941.30] that is worth every Blood Sweat and
[1938.24 - 1943.88] Tears that went into these books getting
[1941.30 - 1946.10] information from SOC making sure you
[1943.88 - 1949.04] have those brain shot therapies so you
[1946.10 - 1952.58] can be free of Ayahuasca I have heard
[1949.04 - 1954.80] stories from moms and dads about their
[1952.58 - 1957.08] teenagers getting their brains blown out
[1954.80 - 1958.94] from Ayahuasca and some psychedelic
[1957.08 - 1961.28] mushrooms where the kids just sit in
[1958.94 - 1963.20] their rooms and they're so depressed
[1961.28 - 1965.60] they can't even formulate words because
[1963.20 - 1967.52] of an ayahuasca ceremony done by us you
[1965.60 - 1969.38] know whatever by a really carefully done
[1967.52 - 1972.14] by carefully by a shaman or something
[1969.38 - 1973.58] the point is and no no offense on
[1972.14 - 1976.52] anything I'm not saying Shaman's this
[1973.58 - 1979.78] whatever I'm just saying that I have
[1976.52 - 1983.36] seen over and over again moms and dads
[1979.78 - 1985.76] complaining over Ayahuasca damage on
[1983.36 - 1987.92] their 16 year old 17 year olds 18 year
[1985.76 - 1989.06] olds you name it and no one talks about
[1987.92 - 1993.08] it

[1993.08 - 1996.68] gotta read the psychedelics you've got
[1995.06 - 1998.30] to read the micro dosing chapter inside
[1996.68 - 2000.22] brain saver
[1998.30 - 2002.86] if you want to make a judgment call on

[2034.66 - 2039.64] please don't miss the light blast
[2037.12 - 2041.92] even though we're only taking in 20 000

[2046.06 - 2048.72] don't miss out
[2049.84 - 2055.54] these brain betrayers can also defy our
[2052.72 - 2057.58] brains from afar as in the case with
[2055.54 - 2059.26] viruses that take up Residence at cider
[2057.58 - 2061.18] liver so what that means is a virus can
[2059.26 - 2063.52] take inside residents inside your liver
[2061.18 - 2066.28] release their neurotoxin the neurotoxin
[2063.52 - 2068.38] go whoop up to your brain and get to
[2066.28 - 2070.54] there and then we got brain fog and then
[2068.38 - 2072.46] we don't feel good and then we don't you
[2070.54 - 2074.14] know and then including balance issues
[2072.46 - 2075.70] we feel like we're on a boat we feel
[2074.14 - 2077.50] like we're rocking we feel like we got
[2075.70 - 2079.78] the vertigo we feel like all of that
[2077.50 - 2081.58] because those neurotoxins are shooting
[2079.78 - 2083.92] out of the liver and getting to our
[2081.58 - 2085.80] central nervous system our vagus nerves
[2083.92 - 2088.12] and making us dizzy and feeling
[2085.80 - 2089.98] imbalanced and all that brain betrayers
[2088.12 - 2091.84] cause all this
[2089.98 - 2093.94] you can't get that information anywhere
[2091.84 - 2098.34] by the way like every second it's like
[2093.94 - 2098.34] boom like boom boom boom
[2099.64 - 2104.44] we're talking about the brain betrayers
[2101.56 - 2106.24] that whether from near or far scatter
[2104.44 - 2107.82] our brains
[2106.24 - 2110.26] you know anybody that's scatterbrained
[2107.82 - 2113.56] fog our brains do you know anybody with
[2110.26 - 2115.36] brain fog they got a foggy brain inflame
[2113.56 - 2117.28] our brains
[2115.36 - 2118.72] how many people go into the doctor's
[2117.28 - 2120.04] office neurologist's office and
[2118.72 - 2122.38] everything and the doctor doesn't even
[2120.04 - 2124.06] know their brains are inflamed they have
[2122.38 - 2126.64] no idea there's inflammation of the
[2124.06 - 2128.40] brain it's so mild it's so discreet but
[2126.64 - 2131.56] it's there
[2128.40 - 2133.24] undermine our brains yes these brain
[2131.56 - 2135.72] betrayers these toxic chemicals and
[2133.24 - 2139.48] everything else can undermine your brain
[2135.72 - 2141.58] disrupt your brain fatigue our brains
[2139.48 - 2143.98] any fatigue going on neurological
[2141.58 - 2145.42] fatigue that's a medical medium phrase
[2143.98 - 2147.10] that's a medical medium understanding
[2145.42 - 2149.74] and a medical medium
[2147.10 - 2152.80] um definition is neurological fatigue
[2149.74 - 2154.96] see before that definition doctors of
[2152.80 - 2157.54] all kinds both alternative conventional
[2154.96 - 2160.42] signs of research did not know that
[2157.54 - 2162.82] fatigue was actually neurological they
[2160.42 - 2165.34] thought you were tired and they thought
[2162.82 - 2170.20] you were faking it in the 1950s and 60s
[2165.34 - 2172.60] and 70s and 80s and 90s and 2000s I hear
[2170.20 - 2174.70] it today people are told women are told
[2172.60 - 2176.50] that they're faking their fatigue
[2174.70 - 2178.12] because they can't see anything on an
[2176.50 - 2179.14] MRI
[2178.12 - 2181.24] but there's something called
[2179.14 - 2182.44] neurological fatigue meaning it's an mm

[2331.66 - 2340.54] here your productive guide page 187 your
[2336.28 - 2342.52] protective guide right here in my hand
[2340.54 - 2345.88] the chapters to come are not meant to
[2342.52 - 2349.00] make you fear life here on planet Earth
[2345.88 - 2351.94] we can't avoid everything that isn't
[2349.00 - 2353.98] great for our brains and our life we
[2351.94 - 2356.20] have to live in this world I understand
[2353.98 - 2358.12] that we do have to live in this world
[2356.20 - 2360.82] there's no question
[2358.12 - 2363.58] these chapters also aren't here so you
[2360.82 - 2366.40] can accept everything listed and move on
[2363.58 - 2370.84] with life ignoring these brain
[2366.40 - 2374.02] portrayers as if they don't exist
[2370.84 - 2376.00] we can make life in this world better by
[2374.02 - 2377.44] learning to stay away from even a
[2376.00 - 2378.58] handful of these brain portrayers in
[2377.44 - 2381.10] here so what I'm saying is you don't
[2378.58 - 2382.06] have to change your whole life in one
[2381.10 - 2384.22] minute
[2382.06 - 2386.26] but you can be aware of some of these
[2384.22 - 2388.74] and the differences that can happen is
[2386.26 - 2388.74] powerful
[2392.98 - 2397.90] all right
[2395.32 - 2400.42] Heidi Floyd The Heavy Metal detox
[2397.90 - 2403.72] changed my life no one ever talks about
[2400.42 - 2405.70] that except for you brought in celery
[2403.72 - 2407.62] juice supplements no more chronic
[2405.70 - 2411.16] sinusitis keep on doing what you're
[2407.62 - 2412.66] doing so Heidi chronic sinusitis so my
[2411.16 - 2414.88] guess
[2412.66 - 2417.04] would be or my estimate would even be
[2414.88 - 2419.14] you went to a lot of doctors
[2417.04 - 2421.84] you went to a lot of ears nose and
[2419.14 - 2423.40] throats doctors right you went to a lot
[2421.84 - 2425.08] of different practitioners and probably
[2423.40 - 2427.30] Healers
[2425.08 - 2429.46] and somewhere along the way you found
[2427.30 - 2431.62] medical medium
[2429.46 - 2432.52] whether it was an angel that led you
[2431.62 - 2437.56] there
[2432.52 - 2441.58] or a spiritual Source or a magical force
[2437.56 - 2444.94] or anything right or God
[2441.58 - 2446.98] or the or Heaven above whatever it is

[2451.90 - 2455.38] that was at the store when you were
[2453.64 - 2457.12] getting stuff you needed it could have
[2455.38 - 2458.62] been anything but you found the
[2457.12 - 2461.14] information and now your chronic side

[2461.14 - 2464.74] to use the heavy metal detox

[2508.60 - 2513.28] were the most detrimental
[2511.36 - 2515.44] you may be able to say I'm not gonna
[2513.28 - 2517.96] like the scented candle anymore because
[2515.44 - 2520.00] it's doing some bad stuff I can go into

[2522.64 - 2526.48] things in your life that are the most
[2524.14 - 2529.18] obvious and the most important in the
[2526.48 - 2531.40] moment there's so many
[2529.18 - 2533.26] or you may be someone that looks at the
[2531.40 - 2537.04] category of brain betrayers which is in
[2533.26 - 2538.78] this book Brain betrayers means bad crap
[2537.04 - 2541.60] I'm just just straight out let's just
[2538.78 - 2544.42] put it in a nutshell brain betrayers
[2541.60 - 2547.24] means your freaking brain was betrayed
[2544.42 - 2549.64] by bad crap created by the industries
[2547.24 - 2552.12] and I'm reading about that in this book
[2549.64 - 2552.12] right now
[2552.76 - 2558.58] for example the domestic Invasion brain
[2556.60 - 2560.92] betrayers is a category called domestic
[2558.58 - 2562.32] invasion
[2560.92 - 2565.06] foreign
[2562.32 - 2566.62] ways to replace or cut them out what's a
[2565.06 - 2568.48] domestic invader
[2566.62 - 2571.66] let me give you a little window into it
[2568.48 - 2574.18] it's that plug-in air freshener that
[2571.66 - 2577.00] you've got to unplug out of the wall
[2574.18 - 2579.96] and you gotta throw out
[2577.00 - 2579.96] Gotta Throw It Out
[2580.00 - 2583.96] sometimes we can't stop ourselves from
[2582.16 - 2586.00] being exposed to brain betrayers it's
[2583.96 - 2589.06] true we can't stop it
[2586.00 - 2593.04] but we can sure clean some of it up and
[2589.06 - 2593.04] then do some healing around it
[2593.22 - 2599.02] viruses especially we can still take
[2595.84 - 2601.06] steps to lessen exposure and kill off
[2599.02 - 2604.72] those viruses with medical medium
[2601.06 - 2606.82] information to get better
[2604.72 - 2608.62] when we do get exposed we can do plenty
[2606.82 - 2611.74] About It by strengthening our immune
[2608.62 - 2614.56] system removing viral fuel from our body
[2611.74 - 2615.94] and staying hydrated
[2614.56 - 2619.12] rather than
[2615.94 - 2623.58] being here to scare you the chapters

[2637.84 - 2642.82] not from mm info but from the medical
[2640.78 - 2644.50] establishment from the alternative
[2642.82 - 2646.84] establishment
[2644.50 - 2648.52] from other sources
[2646.84 - 2650.82] they were told they would never walk
[2648.52 - 2650.82] again

[2826.90 - 2832.24] make them pay
[2829.36 - 2833.38] and that's the attitude that's what it
[2832.24 - 2834.82] is
[2833.38 - 2838.24] I know
[2834.82 - 2841.12] because I know the people out there
[2838.24 - 2842.76] I know of them they don't like medical
[2841.12 - 2846.04] medium information

[2878.92 - 2883.00] they change they morph they shape-shift
[2881.56 - 2884.98] into something else and then they're
[2883.00 - 2886.96] shape-shifting to something else they're
[2884.98 - 2888.52] all anti-fruit now they let you eat a
[2886.96 - 2890.44] little fruit they were all this now they
[2888.52 - 2891.82] let you do that in other words all
[2890.44 - 2893.38] changing because they're making mistakes
[2891.82 - 2895.90] and they're trying to learn along the
[2893.38 - 2898.24] way on your dime and they're trying to
[2895.90 - 2900.28] learn all the way they're along the way
[2898.24 - 2902.74] on your pain and your suffering
[2900.28 - 2904.30] nothing's consistent medical medium
[2902.74 - 2906.82] information was consistent from the
[2904.30 - 2909.10] start all the way back it was still
[2906.82 - 2911.50] consistent it doesn't contradict itself
[2909.10 - 2913.00] and it stays like that they change their
[2911.50 - 2914.56] writings they change their books they
[2913.00 - 2916.54] change their courses they change their
[2914.56 - 2918.40] Direction two years later they change
[2916.54 - 2920.14] something else they say oh it's this now
[2918.40 - 2922.30] that's causing a problem or it's this
[2920.14 - 2924.28] and it keeps on going and that's how
[2922.30 - 2928.14] it's done out there and that's the Cults
[2924.28 - 2928.14] that's what it is right there
[2930.04 - 2934.48] and their attitude is exactly like that
[2932.50 - 2935.92] they can't we don't care suckers you pay
[2934.48 - 2937.90] we don't care you pay that's
[2935.92 - 2941.50] their attitude and that's what they do
[2937.90 - 2944.44] because I know and I know many of them
[2941.50 - 2947.02] out there and how it works
[2944.44 - 2949.78] what you will find is medical medium is
[2947.02 - 2953.62] consistent only grows
[2949.78 - 2956.50] with new information and it builds upon
[2953.62 - 2959.56] itself where it's just more unknown
[2956.50 - 2961.78] never before information more details in
[2959.56 - 2965.32] depth and it never could contradicts
[2961.78 - 2967.42] itself that's how it works but if and
[2965.32 - 2970.24] I'm under the microscope if they were
[2967.42 - 2972.34] under the microscope oh my God every
[2970.24 - 2974.08] book's different everything about it's
[2972.34 - 2976.12] different every belief system they take
[2974.08 - 2977.62] in is different every podcast they do is
[2976.12 - 2979.18] different and then when you look at it
[2977.62 - 2980.86] all
[2979.18 - 2982.24] it's all the same thing everybody's
[2980.86 - 2984.04] doing out there because it's one big
[2982.24 - 2986.68] coal and here's how you know it is when
[2984.04 - 2989.50] you get too sick
[2986.68 - 2990.58] game over because they don't have the
[2989.50 - 2993.40] answers
[2990.58 - 2996.78] you get too sick game over
[2993.40 - 2996.78] that's how it works out there
[2999.10 - 3003.00] so
[3000.48 - 3004.62] the thing about mm is just like when I
[3003.00 - 3006.30] just read in this one little paragraph
[3004.62 - 3007.20] there's so many paragraphs in here to
[3006.30 - 3009.24] read
[3007.20 - 3011.96] rather than being here to scare you the
[3009.24 - 3014.16] chapters ahead are your protective guide
[3011.96 - 3016.38] why are we trying to protect everybody
[3014.16 - 3017.46] why aren't we trying to just protect
[3016.38 - 3019.50] them
[3017.46 - 3021.24] and give them the answers they need in
[3019.50 - 3023.04] Direction like really protect them oh
[3021.24 - 3024.66] that's right they don't know what to do
[3023.04 - 3026.10] to protect people
[3024.66 - 3028.62] because they don't have the information
[3026.10 - 3031.74] from above so I have to give them that
[3028.62 - 3033.84] credit they don't know
[3031.74 - 3035.94] it's a guide to a better life with
[3033.84 - 3038.16] little with a little knowledge about
[3035.94 - 3041.22] what we're exposed to on it on an
[3038.16 - 3043.80] occasion or constant basis and the role
[3041.22 - 3046.32] that plays in harming us even if it's a
[3043.80 - 3048.36] simple thing as aspartame triggering a
[3046.32 - 3050.70] migraine we're so much better equipped
[3048.36 - 3052.86] to live the lives we see for ourselves
[3050.70 - 3055.22] rather than get sidelined by symptoms or
[3052.86 - 3055.22] illness
[3055.38 - 3058.44] if this is your personal copy of the
[3057.66 - 3062.58] book
[3058.44 - 3064.68] feel free to Mark the crap out of it get
[3062.58 - 3067.08] your pen out get your highlighter out
[3064.68 - 3069.72] highlight what you can what you want
[3067.08 - 3072.36] what's what calls out to you
[3069.72 - 3074.16] and if you highlighted the book so much
[3072.36 - 3075.90] because there's so much information in
[3074.16 - 3078.42] these books that blows your mind and you
[3075.90 - 3081.00] highlighted everything to death like you
[3078.42 - 3083.76] just highlighted all get another one
[3081.00 - 3085.92] and highlight that one too
[3083.76 - 3088.08] and be like all right well that book
[3085.92 - 3090.18] has this in here this book has this in
[3088.08 - 3092.48] here and that's a really good thing to
[3090.18 - 3092.48] do
[3095.28 - 3099.66] maybe for instance you're finally ready
[3097.80 - 3101.88] to remove the air fresheners and the
[3099.66 - 3103.38] scented candles in your home and you can
[3101.88 - 3105.90] switch to a natural fragrance free
[3103.38 - 3107.88] laundry detergent then in a few months
[3105.90 - 3109.56] maybe you'll be able to check off a few
[3107.88 - 3111.12] more items in these brain betrayers
[3109.56 - 3113.88] right here
[3111.12 - 3115.44] it's these simple yet powerful steps
[3113.88 - 3117.30] that can protect your friends your
[3115.44 - 3120.24] family your pets your children and your
[3117.30 - 3121.62] own future and that matters
[3120.24 - 3123.72] that's what it's about
[3121.62 - 3126.54] Karen Hartman says I have worked 35
[3123.72 - 3129.42] years in the medical systems hard to
[3126.54 - 3132.38] watch Anthony's info saved me

[3136.86 - 3140.40] here this is interesting viruses and
[3138.66 - 3142.02] viral waste matter well first of all
[3140.40 - 3144.84] science research didn't know viruses
[3142.02 - 3148.14] created waste matter
[3144.84 - 3150.60] that alone is MM info right
[3148.14 - 3152.46] Julie I brain I've been brainwashed
[3150.60 - 3154.08] after having worked 10 years as a
[3152.46 - 3156.60] neurologist whoa you're a neurologist
[3154.08 - 3158.22] that's incredible a lot of relearning
[3156.60 - 3160.74] when I got to Medical medium information
[3158.22 - 3162.72] Julie what's incredible is
[3160.74 - 3164.82] you're actually here you're learning the
[3162.72 - 3167.28] information you got the books obviously

[3167.28 - 3171.66] and I just want to lay down this for a
[3169.56 - 3173.58] minute I got respect for all doctors I
[3171.66 - 3176.40] got respect for people who are working
[3173.58 - 3177.72] on you know on on helping people the
[3176.40 - 3179.34] compassion's there they want to get
[3177.72 - 3181.32] people's lives better and I got the
[3179.34 - 3183.60] ultimate respect for you
[3181.32 - 3186.48] as a neurologist to come in here and to
[3183.60 - 3190.26] get the information and to read it
[3186.48 - 3193.02] I got tremendous respect for you
[3190.26 - 3194.88] so here's the brain betrayers list she's
[3193.02 - 3196.86] the short list this all the information
[3194.88 - 3200.58] it's all in here right we could sit here
[3196.86 - 3202.68] for days days with this information
[3200.58 - 3205.56] viruses and viral waste matter like I
[3202.68 - 3207.42] mentioned Pharmaceuticals that's a brain
[3205.56 - 3208.80] betrayer right there now I get it I'm
[3207.42 - 3210.18] not anti-pharmaceutical for certain
[3208.80 - 3211.98] occasions and for certain things if
[3210.18 - 3213.36] doctor the doctor says this is what you
[3211.98 - 3214.74] need whatever listen to your doctors
[3213.36 - 3217.68] right
[3214.74 - 3219.78] but there's a lot of pharmaceutical that
[3217.68 - 3221.78] shouldn't be in a lot of people I talked
[3219.78 - 3223.92] about the stadium with 80 000 students
[3221.78 - 3226.46] watching college football game and
[3223.92 - 3229.14] cheering and the majority on
[3226.46 - 3232.04] antidepressants anti-anxiety meds and
[3229.14 - 3232.04] Adderall right
[3232.14 - 3237.78] Pam says let's see what that went up
[3235.26 - 3241.08] Amanda says after two years on your
[3237.78 - 3243.48] protocols my Eczema is fully gone
[3241.08 - 3246.18] incredible
[3243.48 - 3247.86] that's that's actually incredible and
[3246.18 - 3249.84] that matters if somebody knows with
[3247.86 - 3252.90] eczema and psoriasis with the suffering
[3249.84 - 3254.70] that occurs it's not just itching you
[3252.90 - 3256.68] know when I see like a commercial or
[3254.70 - 3259.62] advertisement somewhere on social media
[3256.68 - 3261.60] or something from Big Pharma right doing
[3259.62 - 3264.18] a commercial on somebody's eczema
[3261.60 - 3266.40] psoriasis it's like uh you don't even
[3264.18 - 3267.90] know what they're going through
[3266.40 - 3269.16] big Pharma doesn't even know what
[3267.90 - 3270.60] they're going through the kind of Agony
[3269.16 - 3272.16] we're talking about the pain they're
[3270.60 - 3274.86] acting like a little discomfort and they
[3272.16 - 3278.52] show this huge huge slosh right this
[3274.86 - 3280.14] whole spot of right psoriasis or eczema
[3278.52 - 3281.82] but they don't even know what the
[3280.14 - 3283.26] person's suffering but they have no idea
[3281.82 - 3285.84] what the person's actually really
[3283.26 - 3288.84] suffering with how bad it could be
[3285.84 - 3292.14] I learned from SOC but you know
[3288.84 - 3295.14] frankly and said I was gonna die
[3292.14 - 3297.00] medical medium saved my life no medical
[3295.14 - 3298.26] information can do
[3297.00 - 3300.00] that
[3298.26 - 3302.46] that they're big time Cults so you
[3300.00 - 3304.50] understand the Cults out there
[3302.46 - 3305.46] incredible and and you got your life
[3304.50 - 3308.94] back

[3308.94 - 3314.46] Tara Appleman when people say medical
[3311.70 - 3316.80] medium info is fear-mongering I could
[3314.46 - 3319.14] only think that person doesn't know what
[3316.80 - 3322.40] it's like to Suffer Without answers and
[3319.14 - 3322.40] lose all control of your life
[3328.44 - 3334.14] foreign
[3330.12 - 3336.36] I need some lemon balm

[3359.28 - 3364.38] that is not MediCal medium contradicts
[3362.40 - 3367.86] itself you see it all the time Erica
[3364.38 - 3372.90] it's unbelievable and then you wonder
[3367.86 - 3374.22] how like people don't notice it
[3372.90 - 3376.14] hmm
[3374.22 - 3377.04] it's just unbelievable by the way you

[3395.76 - 3401.28] so all right
[3398.34 - 3403.32] toxic heavy metals no one cared about
[3401.28 - 3406.86] toxic heavy metals they spent 35 years
[3403.32 - 3408.90] teaching about it nobody cared
[3406.86 - 3412.98] I practically got dragged out of a
[3408.90 - 3414.66] dental conference over 30 plus years ago
[3412.98 - 3416.88] because I was talking about how the
[3414.66 - 3419.64] Mercury fillings were bad and it was an
[3416.88 - 3422.04] alternative Dental con conference that
[3419.64 - 3423.90] actually still appreciated Mercury
[3422.04 - 3426.86] fillings
[3423.90 - 3426.86] unbelievable
[3427.88 - 3432.32] alternative

[3610.16 - 3616.08] internally because that light blast is
[3613.14 - 3618.00] no joke including I go blind when I'm
[3616.08 - 3619.26] doing it and if you guys know medical
[3618.00 - 3621.54] medium
[3619.26 - 3625.62] um Origins you'll know what that means
[3621.54 - 3628.50] so anyway don't miss the light blast
[3625.62 - 3630.84] please another thing too if you don't
[3628.50 - 3634.92] mind since you know I gotta let you know
[3630.84 - 3638.06] incredible swelling lymphedema
[3634.92 - 3640.80] tissue expansion episode
[3638.06 - 3642.84] Apple podcast please listen to that
[3640.80 - 3645.00] episode and what you'll find on there is
[3642.84 - 3646.62] no advertisers no commercials no
[3645.00 - 3649.38] advertisements
[3646.62 - 3651.42] it is the only podcast on that level
[3649.38 - 3653.82] meaning a number one podcast in health
[3651.42 - 3656.58] that has no advertisers
[3653.82 - 3660.54] and advertisements and commercials
[3656.58 - 3663.24] and I'm hated for it by the industries
[3660.54 - 3666.24] Margarita says I believe ew being in
[3663.24 - 3668.40] health field and health care provider I
[3666.24 - 3672.26] have realized it's all about the money
[3668.40 - 3674.64] yet aw guides Us for free
[3672.26 - 3676.32] so I want to talk about brain saturation
[3674.64 - 3678.18] for a couple minutes since we're in mm
[3676.32 - 3680.40] school for a few more minutes here
[3678.18 - 3682.50] any of these toxins and poisons I've
[3680.40 - 3684.96] mentioned in any amount can reach and
[3682.50 - 3686.64] saturate any aspect of the brain some
[3684.96 - 3688.62] more commonly ending up in certain
[3686.64 - 3689.70] places in the brain than others so all
[3688.62 - 3691.26] those different things I mentioned
[3689.70 - 3693.66] Pharmaceuticals everything else I
[3691.26 - 3695.52] mentioned right Chemtrails radiation EMF
[3693.66 - 3697.14] right all of it harmful foods supplement
[3695.52 - 3700.02] chemicals harmful supplements right
[3697.14 - 3702.30] chemical dust industry Invaders toxic
[3700.02 - 3704.76] heavy metals fragrances Pharmaceuticals
[3702.30 - 3706.68] right I mentioned that again all of that
[3704.76 - 3707.76] can go in different areas of the brain
[3706.68 - 3709.62] that I was just showing you here
[3707.76 - 3713.28] different aspects different areas I mean
[3709.62 - 3716.10] different locations is what I mean
[3713.28 - 3718.08] for example petrochemicals often end up
[3716.10 - 3721.44] in the cerebral cortex
[3718.08 - 3723.90] in outer layer of the brain although
[3721.44 - 3726.54] some petrochemicals can also end up
[3723.90 - 3729.36] deeper within the brain
[3726.54 - 3731.88] the amount of exposure has an influence
[3729.36 - 3734.10] if it's a fair amount of exposure at
[3731.88 - 3735.66] once or extended exposure meaning for
[3734.10 - 3737.88] more than just a few minutes you could
[3735.66 - 3739.80] get deeper saturation of petrochemicals
[3737.88 - 3742.26] or other brain betrayers entering the
[3739.80 - 3744.30] brain when exposure is small tiny
[3742.26 - 3747.24] occasionally here and there you may not
[3744.30 - 3749.16] reach or experience symptoms you may not
[3747.24 - 3751.32] react or experience symptoms if you are
[3749.16 - 3753.24] not sensitive can I read can I read
[3751.32 - 3754.62] Spirit compassion's information correct

[3814.64 - 3818.06] for real right
[3821.82 - 3826.62] I mean seriously
[3824.22 - 3829.68] we've we've never had books like this
[3826.62 - 3831.54] out there in the health world or the
[3829.68 - 3834.54] other medical medium book Brett winter
[3831.54 - 3837.36] says I wish they were longer goat
[3834.54 - 3840.30] g-o-a-t
[3837.36 - 3844.10] you wish these were longer
[3840.30 - 3844.10] that's like 12 pounds right here
[3844.92 - 3851.00] is they're not small books too they're
[3847.26 - 3851.00] big books greatest books of all time
[3852.02 - 3857.76] someone might say like hey he's biased
[3854.64 - 3860.64] he wrote the books uh no
[3857.76 - 3863.22] I get the information from SOC I'm a
[3860.64 - 3865.62] messenger and I could judge the book I
[3863.22 - 3868.26] have an opinion just like anybody else
[3865.62 - 3870.78] Malin says they are so rich I haven't
[3868.26 - 3872.88] been able to go through them yet but
[3870.78 - 3875.54] what I've read is mind-blowing a modern
[3872.88 - 3875.54] truly
[3879.12 - 3884.78] uh
[3880.80 - 3884.78] they are the greatest incredible
[3886.56 - 3891.32] all right so I want to read a little bit
[3887.88 - 3891.32] more if you guys got a second right
[3891.48 - 3895.26] someone may be on a pharmaceutical for a
[3893.70 - 3897.18] month or they have been on
[3895.26 - 3899.46] Pharmaceuticals for 10 years someone may
[3897.18 - 3900.84] be exposed to fumes for a few minutes at
[3899.46 - 3903.36] a gasoline pump
[3900.84 - 3904.44] or they may have some gasoline spilled
[3903.36 - 3906.54] on their skin that they're also
[3904.44 - 3909.08] breathing in as fumes everybody has
[3906.54 - 3912.12] different exposures and that's why
[3909.08 - 3913.74] penetration of the brain varies smaller
[3912.12 - 3915.18] amounts built up over time larger
[3913.74 - 3916.74] amounts speed up the process and
[3915.18 - 3919.08] sensitivity I'm just reading a couple of
[3916.74 - 3921.66] different things when brain betrayers
[3919.08 - 3923.58] settle in the cerebral cortex they may
[3921.66 - 3925.68] not affect critical brain functions
[3923.58 - 3927.90] right away unless someone is already
[3925.68 - 3930.42] sensitive and living with brain betrayer
[3927.90 - 3932.94] complications such as a low-grade viral
[3930.42 - 3934.80] infection and symptoms in that case the
[3932.94 - 3937.08] smell of fresh paint you guys fresh
[3934.80 - 3938.58] paint the smell of fresh paint could set
[3937.08 - 3940.74] them back for days or weeks I've seen
[3938.58 - 3943.80] people paint like
[3940.74 - 3945.66] a friend of mine they're they're
[3943.80 - 3948.36] um college student son
[3945.66 - 3949.86] is repainting his dorm room
[3948.36 - 3951.96] and
[3949.86 - 3953.82] just you know sat in those fumes just
[3951.96 - 3955.02] repainting it real all that paint and
[3953.82 - 3957.12] everything right
[3955.02 - 3960.42] and it was just for three weeks was like
[3957.12 - 3962.16] fatigued and basically bedridden
[3960.42 - 3964.68] because it's all it took to tip the
[3962.16 - 3969.38] scale for that for that um person it's
[3964.68 - 3969.38] all it took to you know to tip the scale
[3970.02 - 3975.00] on the other hand someone who isn't on
[3973.14 - 3976.32] the verge of that Tipping Point that I
[3975.00 - 3978.42] was just saying who hasn't been
[3976.32 - 3979.98] saturated with brain betrayer toxins
[3978.42 - 3981.96] isn't dealing with low-grade viral
[3979.98 - 3983.64] activity or doesn't have a diminished or
[3981.96 - 3985.38] challenged immune system won't
[3983.64 - 3987.00] necessarily see immediate effects from
[3985.38 - 3989.40] exposure so that's that person like I
[3987.00 - 3991.02] could do anything I want I can get any
[3989.40 - 3993.06] exposure I want it doesn't matter their
[3991.02 - 3994.68] scale hasn't been tipped yet you see how
[3993.06 - 3996.60] it works you guys this is MM school for
[3994.68 - 3999.08] a little bit their scale hasn't been
[3996.60 - 3999.08] tipped
[3999.60 - 4005.48] but don't don't take that the wrong way
[4002.84 - 4007.10] it eventually does get ticked if you
[4005.48 - 4009.50] don't do things about it like cleansing
[4007.10 - 4011.18] and doing the right stuff
[4009.50 - 4012.92] you know what's really disheartening is
[4011.18 - 4016.00] when someone
[4012.92 - 4016.00] gets really sick
[4016.46 - 4020.42] they've tried everything out there they
[4018.56 - 4023.48] tried the vegan diet
[4020.42 - 4025.46] they tried a raw food diet a vegan diet
[4023.48 - 4026.60] they tried an animal protein diet that's
[4025.46 - 4028.04] what they came from
[4026.60 - 4029.36] they tried different supplements they
[4028.04 - 4031.58] went to naturopaths they went to
[4029.36 - 4033.26] acupuncturists they went to registered
[4031.58 - 4035.36] dietitians they went to neurologists
[4033.26 - 4037.04] they went to whoever
[4035.36 - 4038.96] and then they find medical medium
[4037.04 - 4040.64] information
[4038.96 - 4042.14] and medical medium information is
[4040.64 - 4045.74] different
[4042.14 - 4048.38] it uses wild Foods
[4045.74 - 4050.54] and fruit and leafy greens differently
[4048.38 - 4052.82] it uses the combinations differently it
[4050.54 - 4056.06] uses supplements that are actually
[4052.82 - 4058.16] really good for the healing process in
[4056.06 - 4059.00] specific ways designed in certain ways
[4058.16 - 4060.92] right
[4059.00 - 4062.90] and then they find out how they were
[4060.92 - 4064.52] sick and why they were sick and then
[4062.90 - 4069.28] they found out that they can customize
[4064.52 - 4069.28] what they want to heal and then
[4070.10 - 4074.62] they want to pretend it wasn't medical
[4071.66 - 4074.62] medium after all
[4074.84 - 4079.22] they want to do their own thing
[4077.30 - 4080.36] I get it they want a health coach or
[4079.22 - 4082.28] they want to do something they want to
[4080.36 - 4084.56] do their own thing
[4082.28 - 4086.60] and they pretend it wasn't medical media
[4084.56 - 4088.94] and they boil it down to it was just
[4086.60 - 4090.80] some fruits and vegetables
[4088.94 - 4092.72] that happens all the time
[4090.80 - 4095.12] it's funny when people
[4092.72 - 4097.28] you know it's it's it's really actually
[4095.12 - 4098.90] heartbreaking meanwhile
[4097.28 - 4101.54] they wouldn't have found that
[4098.90 - 4104.42] information understood did you know just
[4101.54 - 4106.40] knowing what caused your problem and
[4104.42 - 4108.38] your sickness to begin with is a huge
[4106.40 - 4110.84] massive part of your healing process to
[4108.38 - 4112.82] Discount that is insane
[4110.84 - 4114.86] to actually say
[4112.82 - 4117.02] oh yeah no it really wasn't medical
[4114.86 - 4119.60] medium he's just fruits and vegetables a
[4117.02 - 4122.36] vegan whatever I I found my own way of
[4119.60 - 4124.22] doing it with vegetables now and I don't
[4122.36 - 4125.24] even want to mention his name anymore I
[4124.22 - 4127.22] don't even want to mention medical
[4125.24 - 4128.96] medium anymore I found my own
[4127.22 - 4130.22] supplements that I want to do in the way
[4128.96 - 4131.96] I wanted you and then I want to teach
[4130.22 - 4133.40] all that out there because it wasn't
[4131.96 - 4135.44] medical medium and I'm not going to say
[4133.40 - 4139.04] it's medical medium anymore
[4135.44 - 4142.10] it's it's actually insane to think
[4139.04 - 4143.66] that just finding out what was wrong
[4142.10 - 4146.84] with you
[4143.66 - 4149.84] is a huge part that's a huge part of how
[4146.84 - 4151.94] you even heal it gives you peace of mind
[4149.84 - 4153.62] like nothing else when you're out there
[4151.94 - 4155.18] and you're struggling and suffering and
[4153.62 - 4156.86] you tried everything and then you find
[4155.18 - 4159.32] medical medium and the first thing you
[4156.86 - 4161.00] learn is why you're sick healing starts
[4159.32 - 4163.94] to happen from that alone to actually
[4161.00 - 4165.62] discredit that is insane
[4163.94 - 4168.02] just because you want to do your own
[4165.62 - 4169.22] thing and do your own stuff and not be
[4168.02 - 4171.38] part of the medical medium Community
[4169.22 - 4173.54] anymore you want to be doing your own
[4171.38 - 4175.52] thing I get it I understand that but to
[4173.54 - 4177.50] then throw medical medium kind of like
[4175.52 - 4179.72] as if it's oh that would have happened I
[4177.50 - 4181.22] would have healed anyway even though I
[4179.72 - 4182.30] tried everything out there I would have
[4181.22 - 4184.16] healed anyway
[4182.30 - 4186.50] he's just fruits and vegetables and I
[4184.16 - 4188.12] would have figured it out anyway
[4186.50 - 4189.56] I get it you want to be somebody in
[4188.12 - 4190.88] health probably or you want to be
[4189.56 - 4192.62] somebody this or you want to be a life
[4190.88 - 4195.02] coach or whatever it is and you don't
[4192.62 - 4197.54] want to give claim to Medical medium
[4195.02 - 4201.20] information anymore
[4197.54 - 4203.66] and so whatever
[4201.20 - 4205.46] but healing happens by first knowing
[4203.66 - 4207.80] what's wrong with you that's how
[4205.46 - 4209.90] something occurs instantly if you've
[4207.80 - 4213.02] been out there bearing you know out
[4209.90 - 4214.88] there in the desert wanting to know why
[4213.02 - 4216.86] you're finally sick like wanting to know
[4214.88 - 4218.36] what's wrong and you finally get the
[4216.86 - 4221.18] answer that's part of the healing
[4218.36 - 4224.12] process you can't deny that as being
[4221.18 - 4225.74] something that helps you heal
[4224.12 - 4228.68] all right
[4225.74 - 4231.20] then it's also not just a vegan diet
[4228.68 - 4234.34] medical medium is not vegan
[4231.20 - 4236.84] it's not about vegan
[4234.34 - 4238.88] unbelievable the vegan doctors out there
[4236.84 - 4240.02] how they say oh medical medium's just
[4238.88 - 4243.38] vegan you know everybody knew that
[4240.02 - 4245.66] information medical medium is for animal
[4243.38 - 4247.82] protein people you can still keep your
[4245.66 - 4250.22] animal protein if you want it's for
[4247.82 - 4251.90] vegans who can't get better either who
[4250.22 - 4253.34] can that have been doing their vegan
[4251.90 - 4256.04] diet wrong
[4253.34 - 4258.56] then nobody had answers for it's for the
[4256.04 - 4261.20] vegetarians that do other stuff like
[4258.56 - 4263.36] fish it's for everybody it's medical
[4261.20 - 4266.90] medium information is the tool so you
[4263.36 - 4268.94] can heal and still do what you're doing
[4266.90 - 4271.22] and one of the parts of healing is
[4268.94 - 4272.60] knowing what the heck went wrong why are
[4271.22 - 4274.46] you sick because let me tell you what
[4272.60 - 4276.62] that does for your soul and your brain
[4274.46 - 4279.44] and your peace of mind when you know
[4276.62 - 4281.84] what's wrong you instantly start to get
[4279.44 - 4284.60] peace and you instantly start to heal
[4281.84 - 4286.70] and start to sleep and start to know
[4284.60 - 4288.68] okay
[4286.70 - 4291.32] but the people out there get it they get
[4288.68 - 4293.24] greedy they want to take credit for
[4291.32 - 4296.00] medical medium information but their own
[4293.24 - 4297.74] credit I get it they want to cheat other
[4296.00 - 4300.32] people from finding the information
[4297.74 - 4301.94] anymore they don't want to like cite
[4300.32 - 4303.26] medical medium anymore they want to make
[4301.94 - 4306.56] it look like it's all been out there in
[4303.26 - 4309.20] the vegan movement all the info
[4306.56 - 4310.88] it's so sad
[4309.20 - 4313.28] Becky Lynn says they get this
[4310.88 - 4316.58] information and then they use it all to
[4313.28 - 4320.00] put out their their own version but
[4316.58 - 4323.20] don't want to anymore say medical medium
[4320.00 - 4323.20] they want to do their own version
[4323.84 - 4330.38] lupus free with celery33 says I get the
[4327.08 - 4333.26] comment he is not saying anything new
[4330.38 - 4335.48] the medical journals I cited about EBV
[4333.26 - 4338.12] now say it has been known for decades
[4335.48 - 4341.08] that EBV blah blah blah it hasn't been
[4338.12 - 4341.08] known for decades
[4341.24 - 4345.74] the true cause of Lupus was never
[4343.24 - 4348.20] Epstein-Barr in any medical form
[4345.74 - 4349.82] anywhere it was published first by
[4348.20 - 4353.12] medical medium
[4349.82 - 4357.26] it never said anywhere anyhow that the
[4353.12 - 4360.44] cause of Lupus hypothyroidism
[4357.26 - 4362.84] multiple sclerosis Ra was Epstein-Barr
[4360.44 - 4365.30] that never existed
[4362.84 - 4367.76] that was post-published material and
[4365.30 - 4370.76] backdated material they backedated
[4367.76 - 4373.64] material that never said it was the
[4370.76 - 4375.02] cause reactivated Epstein-Barr wasn't
[4373.64 - 4378.08] even a thing
[4375.02 - 4380.66] until medical medium
[4378.08 - 4382.64] the medical Arena both alternative and
[4380.66 - 4384.92] conventional medicine believe that once
[4382.64 - 4387.20] you got Epstein-Barr it went away and it
[4384.92 - 4390.50] was mono and that was it they never knew
[4387.20 - 4392.18] it caused the problem post mono
[4390.50 - 4395.18] it's only medical medium information
[4392.18 - 4397.82] that put it out there that Epstein-Barr
[4395.18 - 4400.34] reactivates and causes problems years
[4397.82 - 4402.20] later giving you ra
[4400.34 - 4404.54] and a whole bunch of other conditions in
[4402.20 - 4407.38] fibromyalgia that's original medical
[4404.54 - 4407.38] medium information
[4409.04 - 4413.18] foreign
[4410.14 - 4415.10] verse taught first understood first and
[4413.18 - 4416.72] nothing else existed for that if you
[4415.10 - 4418.70] were sick all these years you would know
[4416.72 - 4421.88] that if you were sick for many years
[4418.70 - 4425.50] before you would know it didn't exist
[4421.88 - 4425.50] and no one had answers
[4425.84 - 4429.56] but when millions of people go to their
[4427.88 - 4431.90] doctors every day because guess what
[4429.56 - 4433.70] millions of medical medium books went
[4431.90 - 4435.14] around the world and they people
[4433.70 - 4437.96] millions of people went to their
[4435.14 - 4440.24] doctor's offices asking them to test
[4437.96 - 4441.92] them for me for actually Epstein-Barr
[4440.24 - 4443.78] because of medical medium and they
[4441.92 - 4445.28] brought their medical medium books in
[4443.78 - 4446.90] millions of people around the world
[4445.28 - 4450.02] brought them to their doctors right
[4446.90 - 4452.18] there and then
[4450.02 - 4454.82] everybody started learning the true
[4452.18 - 4457.70] cause of their conditions and then
[4454.82 - 4460.82] science research got very upset because
[4457.70 - 4463.70] they were looking like idiots science
[4460.82 - 4465.74] and research and the clinics looked like
[4463.70 - 4468.74] they didn't know why people were sick
[4465.74 - 4471.44] and they started now saying well maybe
[4468.74 - 4475.22] it's Epstein-Barr maybe it's possibly
[4471.44 - 4477.56] Epstein-Barr way post medical medium
[4475.22 - 4479.42] laughs
[4477.56 - 4481.10] the books go into depth on The
[4479.42 - 4482.72] Housewives and what the information is
[4481.10 - 4484.64] in the details and they still don't have
[4482.72 - 4486.26] that today there's no article there's no
[4484.64 - 4488.30] anything there's no nothing out there
[4486.26 - 4490.54] that actually shows you the details of
[4488.30 - 4493.28] how it works and it does in these books
[4490.54 - 4496.52] and that's how it works
[4493.28 - 4498.02] guys we're having some fun today
[4496.52 - 4500.30] just a reminder don't miss the light
[4498.02 - 4502.70] blast watch this replay from the
[4500.30 - 4504.80] beginning this is a live right now but
[4502.70 - 4506.42] watch it from the beginning
[4504.80 - 4508.34] centauri's healing says absolutely
[4506.42 - 4509.96] breaks my heart so many people miss out
[4508.34 - 4512.12] on their chance to heal because of
[4509.96 - 4514.16] people doing this yes and they will
[4512.12 - 4515.12] continue to miss out and continue to
[4514.16 - 4517.94] miss out
[4515.12 - 4520.04] and that's what's gonna happen
[4517.94 - 4521.42] right but they still got to go through
[4520.04 - 4523.16] all the torture they have to swallow
[4521.42 - 4525.38] charcoal they have to do butter in their
[4523.16 - 4527.18] coffee they have to do what what else do
[4525.38 - 4528.86] they have to do uh diatomaceous earth
[4527.18 - 4530.72] particles that destroy their gut lining
[4528.86 - 4532.52] what else do they have to do oh they
[4530.72 - 4534.32] have to do ionized water alkaline
[4532.52 - 4536.00] ionizer water and get nettles in their
[4534.32 - 4537.44] brain what else do they have to do
[4536.00 - 4539.30] before they find medical medium
[4537.44 - 4541.34] information oh they have to dissolve all
[4539.30 - 4543.56] their teeth with apple cider vinegar
[4541.34 - 4545.78] oh no it's medical medium information it
[4543.56 - 4547.58] makes your teeth go bad not all the
[4545.78 - 4550.16] vinegar you had and the caffeine you had
[4547.58 - 4551.72] all these years
[4550.16 - 4553.34] and everything else
[4551.72 - 4555.86] hmm
[4553.34 - 4559.24] I have all my teeth
[4555.86 - 4559.24] I have all my teeth
[4559.46 - 4563.66] all the podcast doctors by the way that
[4561.92 - 4566.00] are younger than me and older than me
[4563.66 - 4567.38] don't have their teeth
[4566.00 - 4569.72] half their mouths are filled with
[4567.38 - 4572.62] implants but they're green tea they say
[4569.72 - 4572.62] is sure helpful
[4572.66 - 4576.08] you know it's kind of crazy when you
[4574.28 - 4579.26] think about it all
[4576.08 - 4581.72] all of it when you think about it
[4579.26 - 4584.42] hmm
[4581.72 - 4587.06] but what do people go through
[4584.42 - 4589.70] apple cider vinegar gummies which
[4587.06 - 4591.74] totally annihilates their stomach acid
[4589.70 - 4594.08] their stomachs actually destroys their
[4591.74 - 4595.64] stomach glands to Charcoal right
[4594.08 - 4597.56] destroys our Linings and makes them
[4595.64 - 4600.14] deficient what else nutrient deficient
[4597.56 - 4600.98] just keep on going down the path of that
[4600.14 - 4602.72] like
[4600.98 - 4604.04] but that's the Colts out there and
[4602.72 - 4606.20] that's what people do
[4604.04 - 4608.06] and then they destroy their bodies with
[4606.20 - 4610.82] all the stuff out there
[4608.06 - 4612.98] and have no idea
[4610.82 - 4614.54] and they'll never know to go to Medical
[4612.98 - 4617.12] medium information because the Cults
[4614.54 - 4620.00] have them so controlled the goal for all
[4617.12 - 4622.64] the Cults out there okay
[4620.00 - 4625.28] in the medical industry is death by a
[4622.64 - 4627.56] Thousand Cuts and then to discredit
[4625.28 - 4629.00] Medical medium information because it
[4627.56 - 4631.52] would take over
[4629.00 - 4633.92] medical medium info would take over if
[4631.52 - 4635.84] people actually knew why they were sick
[4633.92 - 4638.18] and knew they can heal think about that
[4635.84 - 4640.52] people knew why they were sick and they
[4638.18 - 4642.32] can heal it would actually go like
[4640.52 - 4645.04] really crazy
[4642.32 - 4645.04] what's up
[4645.26 - 4647.98] all right
[4649.64 - 4656.12] some lemon balm in my hot water there so
[4653.18 - 4658.58] good oh you guys were reading out of
[4656.12 - 4661.40] brain saver what did today turn into
[4658.58 - 4664.04] because I'm trying to figure it out now
[4661.40 - 4667.88] it was about the late blast it was about
[4664.04 - 4669.44] also the episode on medical meme podcast
[4667.88 - 4671.78] at Apple podcast the swelling episode
[4669.44 - 4674.30] you guys gotta check it out
[4671.78 - 4675.98] you you gotta see that episode you gotta
[4674.30 - 4677.72] hear it I mean you have to hear it it's
[4675.98 - 4679.76] mind-blowing right medical meme podcast
[4677.72 - 4682.04] at Apple podcast
[4679.76 - 4685.28] so what they do is they put out bad
[4682.04 - 4687.32] articles out there and then talk about
[4685.28 - 4689.72] like talk bad about medical medium in
[4687.32 - 4693.02] the Articles right
[4689.72 - 4694.70] so they can discredit medical medium and
[4693.02 - 4698.18] then say medical means information
[4694.70 - 4701.12] already was out there which is not
[4698.18 - 4703.52] it's not I have a team of people
[4701.12 - 4705.80] that monitor that
[4703.52 - 4707.96] to look for it
[4705.80 - 4709.76] they screed shoot everything in the
[4707.96 - 4711.50] article land going all the way back they
[4709.76 - 4714.44] know when someone backdates something
[4711.50 - 4716.12] they know when there's trickery they
[4714.44 - 4718.94] know when something like is published
[4716.12 - 4721.40] things you know like oh yeah sure uh we
[4718.94 - 4723.86] knew that they actually did it
[4721.40 - 4725.78] it's crazy how it works all right you
[4723.86 - 4727.84] guys
[4725.78 - 4727.84] um
[4728.30 - 4732.50] I think we had a good time I don't know
[4730.10 - 4734.66] I had a good time
[4732.50 - 4736.34] Jody says just knowing the root causes
[4734.66 - 4738.32] of things have given me such peace of
[4736.34 - 4739.52] mind right there and empowerment now I
[4738.32 - 4740.66] want to talk about that it's worth more
[4739.52 - 4742.52] than gold
[4740.66 - 4744.74] so what happens is there's people in the
[4742.52 - 4747.20] medical immune community that were out
[4744.74 - 4748.58] there in the sea of confusion right they
[4747.20 - 4749.72] were out there in the Cults they were
[4748.58 - 4752.60] sick
[4749.72 - 4754.88] and then they found mm info
[4752.60 - 4756.40] and then they used mm like
[4754.88 - 4759.86] supplementation
[4756.40 - 4763.64] info they used mm
[4759.86 - 4767.78] food info right detailed information all
[4763.64 - 4770.54] of it they used it to heal and then they
[4767.78 - 4773.60] were like well I want to do my own thing
[4770.54 - 4775.70] I don't want to cite mm anymore I don't
[4773.60 - 4777.98] want to say mm did it
[4775.70 - 4780.56] so I'm gonna kind of curtail my own way
[4777.98 - 4782.96] of doing it and hey and them didn't
[4780.56 - 4784.10] create a fruit or vegetable fruit and
[4782.96 - 4785.78] vegetables have been out there in the
[4784.10 - 4787.16] vegan movement so I'm just gonna say
[4785.78 - 4790.34] whatever
[4787.16 - 4791.96] but what happened is the person found
[4790.34 - 4793.76] answers to why they were sick and it
[4791.96 - 4795.32] gave them so much peace and relief it
[4793.76 - 4797.42] already ignited their healing process
[4795.32 - 4798.56] right there just like you're saying Jody
[4797.42 - 4799.58] just like you're saying I know you're
[4798.56 - 4800.96] not doing what they're doing I'm just
[4799.58 - 4802.82] saying you said just knowing the root
[4800.96 - 4804.68] causes of things have given me such
[4802.82 - 4806.72] peace of mind and empowerment it's worth
[4804.68 - 4809.00] more than gold
[4806.72 - 4810.50] and then they got that peace of mind and
[4809.00 - 4814.58] they started healing and then they
[4810.50 - 4817.22] applied the tools that weren't out there
[4814.58 - 4819.86] celery juice wasn't even in the vegan
[4817.22 - 4822.50] movement no one was doing it
[4819.86 - 4824.18] I know the vegan doctors out there I
[4822.50 - 4826.46] know the vegan people out there they
[4824.18 - 4827.90] weren't doing 16 32 ounces of straight
[4826.46 - 4830.00] celery juice they didn't even know it
[4827.90 - 4832.34] restored anything they didn't know
[4830.00 - 4835.34] anything about it the point is is then
[4832.34 - 4838.10] they apply the medical medium tools and
[4835.34 - 4840.08] they start healing but because celery is
[4838.10 - 4841.58] a vegetable which is an herb it's not
[4840.08 - 4843.74] even a vegetable they're like wait a
[4841.58 - 4845.96] minute hidden Creed celery celery
[4843.74 - 4848.30] existed out there I need to do my own
[4845.96 - 4850.22] thing now meanwhile they're canceling
[4848.30 - 4851.60] out the fact that they healed by finding
[4850.22 - 4852.50] the peace in their heart of what was
[4851.60 - 4854.96] wrong
[4852.50 - 4856.40] and then they applied the tools that
[4854.96 - 4857.96] didn't exist in the vegan movement I'm
[4856.40 - 4859.40] sorry but they didn't
[4857.96 - 4861.50] you know what existed in a vegan
[4859.40 - 4865.10] movement chocolate lots of chocolate
[4861.50 - 4867.08] lots of vegan fat lots of nut Butters
[4865.10 - 4869.90] you know whatever lots of vegan cheese
[4867.08 - 4871.04] so and trust me these people tried all
[4869.90 - 4872.96] that and the whole point is they come
[4871.04 - 4875.00] into medical medium they learn how to
[4872.96 - 4877.40] really navigate
[4875.00 - 4879.68] and heal
[4877.40 - 4882.32] and then they want to stab medical
[4879.68 - 4884.60] medium information in the back they want
[4882.32 - 4887.30] to stick the knife in
[4884.60 - 4889.10] and they don't want to they just want to
[4887.30 - 4890.54] do their own thing stick the knife in
[4889.10 - 4892.76] and twist it
[4890.54 - 4894.86] and I get it
[4892.76 - 4897.68] the traps are everywhere pay attention
[4894.86 - 4900.32] to the details
[4897.68 - 4902.72] it's in the books good information here
[4900.32 - 4904.10] brain shot therapies are really powerful
[4902.72 - 4906.68] you guys
[4904.10 - 4910.70] the brain shot therapies come from above
[4906.68 - 4912.92] all the information comes from above
[4910.70 - 4914.48] and I've been in this for over 30 plus
[4912.92 - 4916.64] years
[4914.48 - 4920.66] I have fed
[4916.64 - 4924.52] the good stuff into the vegan movements
[4920.66 - 4924.52] for over 30 plus years
[4924.56 - 4930.50] what you won't find that I do is I don't
[4927.44 - 4931.70] attack people by their name
[4930.50 - 4935.56] right
[4931.70 - 4938.66] because as much as I want to say
[4935.56 - 4941.18] what happened and what's going on
[4938.66 - 4945.44] I don't want to do that
[4941.18 - 4948.02] but I can tell you this okay
[4945.44 - 4950.00] you wouldn't believe
[4948.02 - 4951.74] what
[4950.00 - 4954.08] they were doing
[4951.74 - 4956.90] in the vegan movement
[4954.08 - 4959.42] along the years that I had to be like no
[4956.90 - 4961.10] you got to do that because that's not
[4959.42 - 4963.56] good no you got to do that you wouldn't
[4961.10 - 4965.96] believe how much correcting
[4963.56 - 4968.12] and fixing to get the vegan movement to
[4965.96 - 4970.04] where it is today and it's still cracked
[4968.12 - 4971.84] out there it's still cracked
[4970.04 - 4973.94] and they're not doing what they need to
[4971.84 - 4976.34] do if you want to be vegan but you can
[4973.94 - 4978.80] be animal protein and heal
[4976.34 - 4980.60] I welcome all animal protein people in
[4978.80 - 4982.70] fact medical mean Community is what like
[4980.60 - 4985.22] probably 60 animal protein people or
[4982.70 - 4987.08] something 70 and they heal with all the
[4985.22 - 4988.88] information and the tools
[4987.08 - 4991.06] and I've never attacked animal protein
[4988.88 - 4993.80] ever
[4991.06 - 4994.94] if you knew the people I helped it would
