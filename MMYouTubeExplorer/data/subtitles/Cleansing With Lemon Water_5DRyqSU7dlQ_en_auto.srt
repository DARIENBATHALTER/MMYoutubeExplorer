and ruined them that's what you hear all

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,280
the time the dentist is like whoa you

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,440
you need five cavities here and

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,239
how much lemons are you doing well i had

70
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,239
a lemon like a year ago what do you mean

71
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
lemon right

72
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,520
another thing too is if you're doing

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,720

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,080

right there okay now look

79
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,640

so you can just take a glass right there

81
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,599

82
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,280

83
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,840

little bit of that lemon juice just

126

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,919
better if you do this

137
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,880
right you squeeze more of it out and

138
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
then

139
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,960
it'd be even better if you took the

140
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,479
other part and you did that

141
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,000
that's better

142
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,759
much better there you go now you got a

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,759
glass of lemon water do that first thing

144
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,600
in the morning and flush out that poison

145
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
and toxin load which we're going to talk

146
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
about

147
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,160
jojo i see a question right there why

148
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,160
not hot water number one question that's

149
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,240
sweeping the nation right there it is

150
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,080
and i'll tell you why because people do

151
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,320
it in hot water now

152
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,280
you're allowed to do your lemon juice

153
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,960
from your lemon in hot water

154
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,880
but you're not gonna get the same

155
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,280
results you're not gonna get the

156
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,360
flushing action now you want a cup of

157
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,759
hot tea in the morning

158
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
or you got you got a flu

159
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,320
or something and you you want to drink

160
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,440
lemon and honey hot tea and you need it

161
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,720
hot on your throat right you can do that

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,479
and that's fine you're still going to

163
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,639
get medicinals

164
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,800
from that lemon if you do hot water but

165
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,840
this is what's going to go wrong

166
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,639
if you do it for flushing the liver and

167
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,160
flushing toxins it has to be

168
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:03,280
raw alive and living you go wrong when

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,240
it's hot or in hot water when you put it

170
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,080
in hot water like a mug of hot hot tea

171
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,240

about

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,880

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,880

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,279
protect your enamel drink through a

331
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,880

people don't realize you don't have to

333
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,880
protect your enamel with lemon i go into

334
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,279
it in detail on the episode okay

335
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,480
lemons don't hurt your teeth they help

336
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,160
your teeth they help prevent gum disease

337
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,519
they're

338
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,720
antibacterial so that's a key right

339
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,079
there people are loaded with bacteria in

340
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,480
their mouth

341
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,279
multiple kinds of bacteria the bacteria

342
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,200
is eating away at the gums the bacteria

343
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,920
is eating away at the teeth

344
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,560
and so lemon water helps to get rid of

345
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,040
that bacteria helps to clean

346
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,040
the palate it helps to clean the mouth

347
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,440
clean the teeth that's important all in

348
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,200
its own and the misconception out there

349
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,920
is well you can't do lemon on your teeth

350
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,839
but how many people really do lemons how

351
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,519
many people do that much lemon water i

352
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,000
know the medical medium community uses

353
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,880
it as a healing tool you guys you drink

354
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,279
your lemon water 16 to 32 ounces on an

355
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,920
empty stomach and you're using your your

356
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,279
lemon water tool every morning

357
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,440
and then you move on from there and you

358
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,920
do your celery juice right but you're

359
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,000
doing your lemon water but in the world

360
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,079
of dentistry in the world of patients

361
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,880
seeing their dentist there's millions of

362
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,880
people in there in the dentist chair

363
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,160
getting their teeth rolled getting root

364
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,360
canals getting implants getting bridges

365
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,279
getting fillings getting crowns right

366
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,720
getting veneers because their teeth are

367
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,040
so shot

368
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,920
so shot and a big part of their teeth

369
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,600
being so shot is mineral deficiencies so

370
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,839
people don't realize when you're doing

371
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,240
your lemon water you're putting minerals

372
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,560
back into your teeth you're not hurting

373
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,120
your enamel you're not messing your

374
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,600
teeth up you're helping your teeth

375
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,000
because you're actually putting calcium

376
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,519
back into the teeth so that's something

377
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,560
that's really important to know right

378
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,399
there

379
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,240
jeanette says i've been drinking lemon

380
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,720
juice first thing in the morning per

381
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,480
year instructions i have not had any

382
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,199
cavities or teeth problems for a few

383
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,360
years and jeanette the reason why is

384
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,519
because it's helping to stave off

385
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,600
cavities now a lot of people they may

386
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,320
start lemon water and their teeth fall

387
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,720
apart because they were already falling

388
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,639
apart because teeth are like time

389
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,720
capsules and i go into this in detail on

390
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
the medical medium podcast you guys on

391
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,360
this episode you got to watch got to

392
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,959
listen to this episode what happens is

393
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,199
our teeth become these mineral deficient

394
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,399
time capsules that through life because

395
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,480
of our deficiencies

396
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,279
and all the acidic foods and all the

397
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,600
vinegar we do right

398
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,240
all the vinegars in our food

399
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,959
all of that we break down the teeth we

400
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,160
destroy them over time vinegar not only

401
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,639
corrodes erodes the enamel off the teeth

402
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,040
but when you have vinegar go into your

403
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,759
body and it's in your bloodstream it's

404
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,680
so acidic that your your teeth throw the

405
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,759
calcium out of it

406
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,920
your bones throw the calcium out of it

407
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,160
and this is really important to know so

408
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,480
here's how it works

409
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,399
the more acidic we are inside our body

410
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,800
the less alkaline we are inside our body

411
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,279
and the more acidic we have to take

412
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,839
calcium from the bones to neutralize it

413
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,839
so the more vinegar you do even if it's

414
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,160
just in a dressing every single day or

415
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,920
in a salsa or something else what's

416
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,160
happening is the calcium inside your

417
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,079
bones is starting to deplete as you're

418
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,079
doing vinegar another one is coffee

419
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,360
right if you're doing your coffee every

420
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,279
single day

421
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,959
what's happening is your body has to

422
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,920
throw calcium reserves into the

423
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,160
bloodstream to buffer it a straw is not

424
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,680
going to save you so if you drink your

425
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,360
coffee with a straw you drink your

426
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,880
vinegar with a straw you drink your

427
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,399
lemon water well lemon water you don't

428
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,399
need a drink with a straw anyway

429
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,959
regardless but if you're drinking with

430
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,240
the straw thinking that's your best bet

431
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,759
you're not going to save your teeth

432
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,199
because it's about what's going into the

433
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,040
bloodstream it's not about what's

434
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,800
touching the teeth so much

435
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,639
vira good to see you let's see i noticed

436
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,320
my teeth get sensitive after drinking

437
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,759
lemon water for a while so let's cover

438
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,040
that right now that's important all of

439
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,079
its own

440
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,720
okay

441
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,480
so what happens elvira is that when

442
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
people have sensitive teeth they already

443
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,519
have sensitive teeth lemon water doesn't

444
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,360
make it sensitive it's already sensitive

445
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,199
so if you have a nerve problem a gum

446
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,279
problem a tooth problem any kind of

447
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,160
issue with your teeth mouth trigeminal

448
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,160
neuralgia or just just a nerve that's

449
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,919
had it's been jabbed too many times at

450
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,760
the dentist so it becomes sensitive

451
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,839
because you had the novocaine the

452
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,240
numbing agent the needle went into your

453
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,720
nerve in the jaw right and it just made

454
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,360
it it made it sensitive over the years

455
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,559
so if lemon water you feel it with the

456
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,480
lemon water

457
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,160
you're probably feeling it with other

458
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,919
things too so it's not like you're

459
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
living your life and you never had a

460
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,559
tooth sensitivity and all of a sudden

461
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,640
you have lemon water and now you have

462
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,039
one it doesn't work like that i'm sure

463
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,280
that you have sensitivity somewhere

464
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,360
around your tooth with other things that

465
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,080
you either eat or drink because

466
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,520
everybody does right now

467
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,679
the other thing too is people get

468
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,440
sensitive teeth they have sensitive

469
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,160
teeth automatically they get sensitive

470
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,039
if it's cold water going down or if it's

471
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,360
really hot and no ha that'll ring the

472
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,000
bell on a sensitive nerve but lemons

473
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,880
don't make a sensitive nerve lemons help

474
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,559
heal a sensitive nerve susan broon says

475
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,559
i use limes in my water which i have

476
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,280
right here susan cool i use lime in my

477
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,840
water do they work the same as lemons

478
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,520
yes they do incredible if you love lime

479
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,200
that's the way to go

480
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,960
that's a great way to go wendy says my

481
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,200
teeth actually stopped being sensitive

482
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,039
with medical medium protocols amazing

483
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,720
and that i hear that all the time that

484
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,120
people's nerves get stronger in their

485
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,440
mouth because medical medium protocols

486
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,960
so they end up healing so that they're

487
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,039
less sensitive in their mouth which is

488
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
incredible all on its own you guys if

489
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,320

you've got to check it out

516
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,799
so when it comes down to

517
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,320
acid versus alkaline let's hit that

518
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,000
really quick this is important

519
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,880
information that you might want to know

520
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,919
right

521
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,960
lemons

522
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,200
yes

523
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,760
it's got some citric acid the natural

524
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,640
kind the right kind right so it's got

525
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,679
the acid in here but it's alkaline the

526
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,919
lemon is an alkaline fruit lime two for

527
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,039
the ones that like lime right these are

528
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,520
alkaline what happens is that when those

529
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,360
minerals those alkaline minerals enter

530
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,000
in

531
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,799
okay when they enter in the body these

532
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,200
alkaline minerals an amazing process

533
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,039
occurs

534
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,919
they go alkaline

535
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,559
everything in the lemon goes alkaline so

536
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,640
if it feels like it's not

537
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,880
alkaline because it's acidic that's the

538
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,480
fruit acid that you're experiencing

539
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,559
right

540
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,559
but the minerals in here

541
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,559
turn alkaline because they are alkaline

542
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,000
they change the chemistry of your body

543
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,360
immediately so lemon water is alkalinity

544
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,760
so first thing in the morning you're

545
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,440
getting an alkaline flesh

546
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,919
that's critical to know

547
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,640
so lemon may seem acidic but it's

548
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,760
neutralizing acids it's making you

549
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,919
alkaline internally which is a game

550
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,159
changer for people who are sick and have

551
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,960
problems and all these other issues

552
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:42,559
so when it comes down to restoring

553
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,000
minerals back into deficient teeth the

554
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,840
lemon water brings alkaline minerals

555
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,799
like calcium because it's high in

556
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,960
calcium back into your teeth to help

557
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,919
restore your teeth

558
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,559
that's

559
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,080
where the money's at right there

560
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,240
because you're actually bringing your

561
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,400
teeth back when you do lemon water

562
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,640
that's how it works i've had thousands

563
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,039
of lemons in my life thousands upon

564
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
thousands and i still have every one of

565
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,840
my own teeth

566
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
okay

567
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,600
which is incredible

568
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,760
so that's important to know right and

569
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,840
yeah okay they're not perfectly straight

570
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,480
but i never had braces or anything but

571
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,640
whatever i don't have veneers i know all

572
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,720
the podcast doctors they all got veneers

573
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,480
they all got implants you know but you

574
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,240
know who cares if someone has implants

575
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,200
or veneers or some people that have

576
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,640
crowns and root canals i get it and i

577
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,480
totally understand but what i'm saying

578
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,240
is with the podcast doctors is here they

579
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,039
are they're the ones saying these days

580
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,799
watch the lemons watch the lemon on your

581
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,120
teeth meanwhile these guys are just been

582
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,520
drinking coffee all their life

583
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,440
doing whatever vinegar everything else

584
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,720
all their teeth are gone they all got

585
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,039
veneers

586
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,039
you know and at my age

587
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,559
i got all my teeth every last one of

588
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,559
them they're there and they're in top

589
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,960
shape bottom line

590
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,080
and i've done thousands of lemons

591
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,120
thousands upon eaten lemons do the lemon

592
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,120
water

593
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,440
clearly nature says my teeth are so much

594
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,320
stronger with medical medium no more

595
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,000
thin chipping teeth exactly so many

596
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,120
people have the thin chipping teeth

597
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,400
because teeth crumble from the inside

598
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,400
out they are the time capsules manual

599
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,600
says does fermented food also have the

600
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,360
same acidic effect like vinegar

601
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,360
fermented food it all depends on what's

602
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,720
going on with that fermented food a lot

603
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
of fermented food has it is acidic okay

604
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,280
it is acidic naturally fermentation

605
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,120
becomes that but it doesn't have the

606
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,960
same effect

607
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,480
kim miller says my teeth were falling

608
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
apart

609
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,039
doing acv regularly

610
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,400
doing your protocols have saved my teeth

611
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,400
and they've never been healthier now

612
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,960
here's the funny thing

613
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,360
exactly so you'll see professionals and

614
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,360
health professionals and dietitians and

615
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,919
podcast doctors or whoever out there and

616
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,240
they're promoting the acv they want all

617
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,559
their people to buy their acv brand

618
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,480
right apple cider vinegar meanwhile

619
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,240
they're just promoting people to lose

620
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,480
and destroy their teeth

621
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,720
there's a big difference right there all

622
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,679
on its own you know how much confusion's

623
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,120
out there

624
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,360
um by the way in the fermented food

625
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,559
question that was there earlier actually

626
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,520
just so you know

627
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,400
the kombucha tea right kombucha tea that

628
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,880
is

629
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,600
highly acidic that's got the caffeine in

630
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,000
it that re and it's really acidic that

631
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,559
fermentation process that does hurt

632
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,919
teeth bad so kombucha tea does hurt

633
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,080
teeth really bad

634
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,039
so kim miller says my teeth are falling

635
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,559
apart doing acv regularly doing your

636
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,440
protocols oh you said that incredible

637
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,320
and they're healthier amazing um smokey

638
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,360
mountain paradise i've healed a cracked

639
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,760
tooth

640
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,120
split right down the middle on medical

641
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,720
medium

642
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,720
drop the mic

643
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,480
that's amazing that's incredible

644
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,679
incredible um

645
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,640
gina says

646
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,520
my broken enamel grew back i consume

647
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,799
around 10 pounds of lemons each week

648
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,520
yeah

649
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,440
right and people don't know this

650
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,080
they're in fear every day out there

651
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,200
jeannette says citric acid is not citrus

652
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,799
correct citric acid in supplementation

653
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
is corn

654
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:22,080
it's a byproduct of corn

655
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,159
it's not good either and it's always gmo

656
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,320
citric acid this is different this is an

657
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,320
entirely different kind of citric acid

658
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,960
entirely different sabby says i heard

659
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,039
the episodes they are boring and the

660
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,720
same repeat of the information you have

661
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,559
already mentioned in your lives books

662
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,000
and blogs that's interesting sad because

663
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,279
i'm wondering what episodes you heard

664
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
then i think you were listening to

665
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,760
somebody else's podcast

666
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,559
because it was all new information

667
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,200
the whole episode is is like cranking

668
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,760

669
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,000

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,880

tracy lynn lemon and lime water ghost

690
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,200
thing

691
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,840
i'm the morning's game changer and no

692
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,840
more erosive esophagealitis and all

693
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,000
these years the doctor said to me stay

694
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,159
away from lemons and tomatoes no pain

695
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,159
and teeth are great

696
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,320
incredible well that's what happens

697
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,520
right doctors don't know why we're sick

698
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,960
i want you guys to have doctors but

699
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,600
doctors don't know why we're sick with

700
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,520
chronic illness they don't it's sad but

701
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,600
they don't because scientists don't know

702
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,039
why we're sick with chronic illness so

703
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,480
medical universities don't know why

704
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,559
we're sick with mysterious chronic

705
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,840
illness we know that right

706
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,600
and at the same time they're like

707
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,600
telling you what to do or don't do or

708
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
not do meanwhile they don't have any of

709
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,039
the real teeth i know because i know so

710
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,880
many doctors

711
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,080
they don't have their teeth right and

712
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,360
next thing you know they're doing all

713
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,720
the chocolate and they're doing

714
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,159
everything else they're telling people

715
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,559
lots of chocolate that's a great way to

716
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,600
lose your teeth too

717
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,960
so

718
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,559
my teeth have been getting strong so

719
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
nisha says my teeth have been getting

720
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,880
stronger with medical medium information

721
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,480
i can actually see how strong my teeth

722
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,360
are now they used to be transparent the

723
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,880
transparent teeth look exactly now they

724
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,279
are solid

725
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
boom you're getting all your minerals

726
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,880
back

727
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,679
lamb tails says the sarcasm used to put

728
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,000
me off because i was too serious

729
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,480
and heavy-hearted and you taught me to

730
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,400
lighten up in many ways my inner light

731
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,400
is brighter than ever and getting

732
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,159
stronger

733
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,400
you're actually you're actually getting

734
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,400
me emotional because to think that you

735
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,400
you know that you're okay with my

736
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,679

762
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,200
minute or do you mean how science took

763
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,600
medical medium information that fcmr

764
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,440
causes multiple sclerosis so just so you

765
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,679
know when you say peer-reviewed studies

766
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,320
to medical medium please know science

767
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,799
takes medical mediums information

768
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,640
and they use it and they do it illegally

769
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,080
and we know that because it's already

770
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,120
been published in all the medical medium

771
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,520
books and science takes it later so try

772
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,600
that for your peer review

years god bless you

812
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,200
everything like my stomach and thyroid

813
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,840
issues got a lot better but my teeth not

814
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,880
my dentist wants me to use fluoride and

815
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,559
i don't know what to do okay

816
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,520
so okay

817
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,200
look

818
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,440
i've always listened to your doctors but

819
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,760
i would nev me personally would never

820
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,880
touch fluoride ever in a million years

821
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,799
okay

822
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,320
fluoride's a neurotoxin doesn't

823
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,000
strengthen the teeth it destroys teeth

824
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,000
my opinion fine so so i always tell my

825
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,240
family and my friends when they're at

826
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
the dentist you avoid

827
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,080
that fluoride treatment

828
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,600
always tell my family and my friends

829
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,880
don't let them put that poison in your

830
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,880
mouth

831
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,720
teeth are time capsules you can be doing

832
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,039
medical medium for three years and

833
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,960
medical medium during those three years

834
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,440
could be stopping your teeth from really

835
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,120
falling apart

836
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,360
see your teeth

837
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,440
all these years being a time capsule

838
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,279
already had the deficiencies already

839
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,520
been damaged by vinegar all along the

840
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,640
way maybe even caffeine chocolate

841
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,640
products coffee products already damaged

842
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,720
along the way you might have come into

843
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,519
this world mineral deficient so your

844
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,799
teeth were already on the trajectory of

845
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,640
falling apart for the future right

846
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,640
then you got onto medical medium and

847
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,200
it's slowing the process down it's

848
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,200
slowing the teeth from really collapsing

849
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,720
and falling apart

850
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,159
because the medical medium information

851
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,159
is like putting on the brakes like

852
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,399
it's like putting on the brakes of a

853
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,799
real problem happening

854
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,240
but you still got work to do lots of

855
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,240
work for restoring and re-mineralizing

856
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,159
and that's important to know you're

857
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,000
doing the celery juice what protocol are

858
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,279
you using medical medium are you doing

859
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,519
the lemon award the cellar juice the

860
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,440
heavy metal detox movie people who have

861
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,279
a lot of heavy metals

862
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,360
in their body

863
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,399
have teeth problems

864
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,399
are they getting all the metals out

865
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,159
you know are they getting the metals out

866
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,320
of their body are they getting the

867
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,399
metals out of their liver

868
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,840
all these things matter

869
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:05,760
because those time capsules

870
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,919
are a historic history of the past in

871
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,840
your life from all kinds of toxins

872
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,760
poisons coming in here mineral deficient

873
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,840
having toxic heavy metals in your system

874
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,880
all of

875
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,720
this so when you're doing the mm

876
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,960
protocol and everything else is getting

877
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,240
better your thyroid this that your

878
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,679
stomach everything's getting better

879
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,600
everything's getting better think about

880
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,360
how many problems you got right well

881
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,159
your your body's using all those

882
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,760
reserves man your teeth they're just

883
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,720
like time capsules that are deficient

884
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,880
from you being sick all these years too

885
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,880
so it matters that you're even doing

886
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,480
medical medium protocol because not only

887
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,320
are things getting better but you're

888
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,600
halting you're stopping the teeth from

889
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,600
getting worse and worse faster until the

890
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,880
breaks can hit and then it's about now

891
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,880
the teeth are getting better

892
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,480
