00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,759
How many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health? Chances are, whether

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,559
they show it or not, most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,240
in your life do. And chances are, you're

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,640
one of them.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,320
Whether you're dealing with anxiety,

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,000
depression, endometriosis, acne, eczema,

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,400
autoimmune, thyroid, lime, brain fog,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,320
fatigue, or any other symptom or

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,120
condition, you're far from alone.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,040
Living with symptoms has become the new

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,840
normal. So, no more guessing games. It's

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,320
time to get answers. Welcome to the

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,520
Medical Medium Podcast. I'm Anthony

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,680
William.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,600
We're talking about your body's ability

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,600
to heal. And you have an audience. God

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,680
and the angels are watching. That's

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,120
right. When we go through chronic

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,600
illness, we're not really alone. When

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,840
people get sick, they feel that way.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,400
Even when they have people around them,

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
it's easy to feel lonely when you're

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,040
struggling with a sickness, with a

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,080
chronic illness, cuz in the end, you

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,240
just focus on the symptoms. And how come

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,560
everybody else out there looks like

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,960
they're living their lives? They feel

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,680
like they're fine. They look like

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,360
they're normal. But are they? Pretty

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,600
much everybody's getting sick out there

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,680
and they're getting their turn. But if

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,840
you're already struggling, if you

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,240
already have chronic illness, keep in

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,320
mind that you're spiritually strong.

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,360
You're emotionally strong more than you

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,680
even know. You're just being rebuilt

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,200
from the bottom to the top. You're just

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,360
being restored, renewed. Your body wants

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,640
to heal and you're in that process of

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,200
healing. In this episode, just relax,

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,000
get a good comfortable spot. We got some

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,159
ground to cover. Are you ready? Let's

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,159
get started.

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,040
A lot of people are going through it.

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,920
They're going through a challenge, a

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,000
health challenge. They go to a doctor.

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
They're trying to get answers. They

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,400
think they get answers and maybe they

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,440
do, but yet they're still stuck with the

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,760
symptom. Doesn't really go away or it

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,879
comes and goes or they're better for a

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,520
little while naturally just heals and

54
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,080
then it's back but back worse than it

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,200
was before. Then it's back to another

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,520
doctor and another doctor. Some people

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,599
see dozens of doctors throughout the

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,000
course of years. There are people out

59
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,480
there that see up to a 100 doctors,

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,640
practitioners, health professionals

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,959
looking for answers. Their hope is

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,440
strong at first, but then it can dwindle

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
over time. And it gets harder and harder

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,080
to get out of the house, to get to

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,400
appointments. No one understands unless

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,720
they've been there, unless they've felt

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,280
it themselves, experienced it

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,760
themselves. It's not easy. There's

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,080
nothing easy about getting sick. There's

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,480
nothing easy about having a mystery

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,599
chronic illness. There's nothing easy

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,840
about pain. There's nothing easy about

73
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,080
suffering and struggles. And then

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,200
another hard part is relaying the

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,159
message, relaying what you're going

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,200
through. People who are sick, they don't

77
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,480
have it easy for so many reasons and so

78
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,440
many ways. One is expressing themselves,

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,159
being able to communicate their pain,

80
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,720
being able to talk about it, being able

81
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,640
to tell somebody else, being able to

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,760
have the confidence behind them as

83
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,640
they're telling someone because PTSD

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,959
comes along for the ride, and even OCD

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,799
can come along for the ride. And then

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,360
something people just don't talk about

87
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,120
in the health field enough or at all

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,080
even is that most all illnesses chronic

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,480
mystery illness is neurological. There's

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,720
neurological symptoms involved and

91
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,080
neurological symptoms being involved

92
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,680
means expressing themselves talking

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,879
about the problem. Communicating is

94
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,799
difficult because neurological symptoms

95
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,200
lead to the inability to express the

96
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,959
suffering someone's going through. And

97
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,959
when somebody heals from a chronic

98
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,919
mystery illness, a neurological

99
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,040
condition, or any health condition, they

100
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,000
become a treasure trove of experience, a

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,639
treasure trove of knowledge. Knowledge

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,520
that's much different than everyday

103
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,800
knowledge, than everyday wisdom.

104
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,600
wisdom that's above other wisdom.

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,320
Because when you come from ground zero

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,960
in your health and you rise out of the

107
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,840
ashes, the pain and suffering is left

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,560
behind. But not the experience of the

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,600
pain and suffering that stays within

110
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,720
you. It's instilled within you. It

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,840
becomes a force, a holy force. And one

112
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,520
of the reasons it becomes a holy force

113
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,560
is because God was there all along. God

114
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,080
was watching with every single struggle.

115
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,720
With all your pain, all your sorrow, God

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,880
was there all through it. Whether you

117
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,560
knew or you did not know, God was by

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,680
your side. God was watching over you.

119
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,639
God was seeing you sleep at night while

120
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,600
dreaming. God was seeing you sleep at

121
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,080
night knowing you were struggling. God

122
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,880
saw you wake up in the morning knowing

123
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,440
you were sad because your symptoms were

124
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,720
still there because your condition was

125
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,039
still the same. God knew. And if you're

126
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,160
somebody going through any symptoms or

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,960
chronic illness or struggles now, God

128
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,840
knows. That's why your recovery and what

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,320
you're going through is holy. That's one

130
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,800
of the reasons why it's spiritual and

131
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,440
should never be looked down upon. Should

132
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,560
never be disrespected. What you've gone

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,919
through, your healing, your sickness,

134
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,800
your chronic illness, your experiences,

135
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,520
your struggles should never be frowned

136
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,720
upon. They should never be demeaned.

137
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,000
They should never be judged by anyone.

138
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,400
You deserve to heal, but maybe you don't

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,240
think you do. When you're sick too long,

140
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,560
you start believing you don't deserve

141
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,880
it. That there's a reason why you're not

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,199
getting better. And that reason is

143
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,720
you're a bad person or you did something

144
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,120
wrong or you put yourself into this. You

145
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,600
got yourself sick. You did all the wrong

146
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,319
things. But that's not how it works.

147
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,960
That's not the truth. It's easy to get

148
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,680
conditioned here on earth believing that

149
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,000
you don't deserve to heal, that you're

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,319
supposed to be stuck that you don't

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,960
deserve to get better. And the minute we

152
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,000
get sick, the minute we get a symptom

153
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,319
and it doesn't resolve fast, the minute

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,560
we're not well, we start doubting

155
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,280
everything. And everything means our

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,080
body. We doubt our body's ability to

157
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,759
heal. We doubt we did the right thing to

158
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,400
heal. We doubt our own confidence. We

159
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,800
doubt our own hope. We doubt our own

160
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,440
faith. It's easy to believe when you

161
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,680
have chronic illness long enough that

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,840
you don't deserve to heal. And it's easy

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,960
to start questioning what kind of person

164
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,759
you are, especially that people around

165
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,240
you are wondering why you're still sick.

166
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,120
It happens all the time. The lack of

167
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,080
understanding can occur around you.

168
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,800
People don't understand what it's like

169
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,440
to be sick unless they've been really

170
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,000
sick themselves. Unless they've been in

171
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,160
your shoes or in the same position of

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,280
somebody who's been chronically ill for

173
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,000
a long enough time. The truth is is that

174
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,240
everybody at some point in their life is

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,280
going to experience some form of

176
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,400
sickness. whether it's acute, whether

177
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,240
it's severe, whether it's mild, but

178
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,919
long-term, but they're going to

179
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,919
experience it. Now, if you're

180
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,400
experiencing it now and you look outside

181
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,800
and you see people living their lives

182
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,720
and everybody looks like they're fine,

183
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,319
they're driving around, they're doing

184
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,800
things, young people look

185
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,080
indestructible, older people are walking

186
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,120
around, nothing's wrong. Keep in mind

187
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,199
that they may get their turn or they may

188
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,319
not be as healthy as they look from a

189
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,199
distance or they seem. Some of them may

190
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,760
be struggling like you. If you're sick

191
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,599
now, if you're struggling with symptoms,

192
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,039
if you got chronic illness and you're

193
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,919
younger, you're a young person, then you

194
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,880
got sick earlier. You earned your

195
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,120
stripes. You're obtaining knowledge.

196
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,360
You're growing spiritually. You're

197
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,440
becoming a stronger soul. You're

198
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,000
becoming a seer.

199
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,440
You can see things other people cannot

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
see. You got life experiences other

201
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,959
people do not have yet. You may feel

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,920
weaker physically, but you're stronger

203
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:09,600
spiritually. And when the day comes that

204
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,920
you heal, when you recover, you're going

205
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,519
to take all of that with you. And as

206
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
you're living your life, people are

207
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,440
going to walk up to you and they're

208
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,519
going to see it and feel it. They're not

209
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,920
going to know what it is, but they're

210
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,240
going to sense it that there's something

211
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,279
different about you. And as you're

212
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,480
standing there, God is going to be

213
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,440
watching. An angel is going to be

214
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,560
seeing. And they were there the whole

215
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,040
time when you were sick. They were there

216
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,320
throughout your entire struggle, whether

217
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,040
you were aware of it or not, because you

218
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,760
weren't alone when you struggled. You

219
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,920
weren't alone when you were sick. It may

220
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,480
have felt that way, but God and the

221
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,920
angels knew what you were going through.

222
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,320
They were watching, seeing your courage,

223
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,240
admiring your strength, understanding

224
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,200
your battle. And if you're in that

225
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,320
battle of chronic illness now and you're

226
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,040
not healed yet, they're watching. You

227
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,279
have an audience and you're not alone.

228
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,720
People think when they get sick and

229
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,920
they're struggling and they're not

230
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,200
getting better that they are weak. But

231
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,560
that's not true. It's the opposite. They

232
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,160
are strong. Really strong. The

233
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,360
strongest.

234
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,000
Just because they can't run 10 miles, do

235
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,440
a backflip, lift heavy weights for 2

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,560
hours, athletically compete in a sport,

237
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,120
doesn't mean they're weak on any level.

238
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,360
Sure, physically they're struggling,

239
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,399
physically they're not there, but

240
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,120
mentally they're stronger than anyone.

241
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,120
Spiritually stronger than anyone.

242
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,600
Because what it takes to sustain

243
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,600
yourself when you're chronically sick is

244
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,279
like no other. What it takes to talk to

245
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,480
your mind, to talk to yourself, to walk

246
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,720
yourself through it every single day is

247
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,600
like no other. Everything gets

248
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,399
challenged. Your confidence, your

249
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,560
consciousness, your subconsciousness,

250
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,519
who you are as a person, it gets

251
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,839
deconstructed. It gets purified. And

252
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:22,079
then it gets reconstructed. Before you

253
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,320
heal or as you're healing, you rebuild

254
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,000
your soul, your consciousness, your

255
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,079
subconsciousness.

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,839
Being in the woods for a long time can

257
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,560
do that to a person. Reshape them in a

258
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,880
way that's unmatched. And that person

259
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,279
out there who's athletic or they're

260
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,399
strong or they can exercise every single

261
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,839
day or they're in a sport, they won't

262
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,160
know what that is. They just won't. Just

263
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,839
because they're free will and they're

264
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:56,240
using their willpower to exercise or

265
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,560
perform doesn't mean they're stronger in

266
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,560
every single way than someone who's

267
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,079
chronically sick. They're used to

268
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,320
battling gravity, battling tiredness

269
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,639
because of overexertion.

270
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,240
People who are chronically sick are

271
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,800
battling mercury, metals, pathogens,

272
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,880
toxins. They're battling a lot of

273
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,680
things. They're battling an inner

274
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,959
struggle that can't be seen. Weakened

275
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,399
nervous systems, mystery, inflammation,

276
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,279
PTSD, OCD, things that come with

277
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,360
illnesses. They come for the ride

278
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,000
because it's so difficult. And the

279
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,160
battle is every single day. And the

280
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,639
strength they have when they're sick,

281
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,160
the strength you have when you're

282
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,560
chronically ill and sick, is unmatched.

283
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,360
It's unlike any other. Over the years,

284
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,360
I've seen athletes become ill, get

285
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
chronic inflammation, brain

286
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,959
inflammation,

287
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,440
or some kind of other chronic illness,

288
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,480
and it hits them hard. And they're like,

289
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,720
"Wow, I didn't know that this kind of

290
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,160
challenge is different than the other

291
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,200
kind of challenge I do every day

292
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,079
athletically. I didn't know that it

293
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,680
takes everything I got. Everything

294
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,079
mental, emotional, spiritual, physical,

295
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,160
and how difficult it really is. And

296
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,200
that's what they say. And the same goes

297
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,959
for somebody who isn't an athlete. Maybe

298
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,680
they're just somebody that never got

299
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,639
sick yet. They're not there yet. Maybe

300
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,920
they're in their 20s, their 30s, maybe

301
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,160
early 40s. Nothing really happened. It's

302
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,480
really small stuff. They're living their

303
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,399
life. They're doing what they want and

304
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,399
suddenly it all stops. They get sick and

305
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,360
now they're chronically ill. They're

306
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,600
going doctor to doctor to doctor and

307
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,480
they're realizing it's a different

308
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,120
world. It's a different part of them.

309
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,760
They have to dig deeper than they've

310
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,000
ever dug before. They have to get to

311
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,320
know themselves because that's what

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,399
happens. You have to get to know

313
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,040
yourself. You learn things about

314
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,440
yourself you would have never learned if

315
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,800
it wasn't for getting sick. And do they

316
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,839
have what it takes? Do they have what

317
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,320
you have? Can they sustain themselves

318
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,279
emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and

319
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,600
physically before they find the

320
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,120
information, before they find the

321
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,839
knowledge, the keys to how to heal, to

322
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,000
how to move forward? And they will they

323
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,639
will sustain themselves. They will

324
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,279
discover that inner strength. Whatever

325
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,360
guilt you hold, whatever guilt you have,

326
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,560
whatever guilt that sits deep down

327
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,160
inside of you during the process of your

328
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,600
healing,

329
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,320
it's time for it to shed away. It's time

330
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,639
to leave it behind. You didn't create

331
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,880
your chronic illness. You didn't bring

332
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,360
yourself to this place of chronic

333
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,639
illness. You didn't bring yourself

334
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,959
purposely to a place of sickness. It's

335
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,600
not something you wanted. It's not

336
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,720
something you did on purpose. You didn't

337
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,360
do it at all. You didn't purposely do

338
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,839
this to become unwell. It's not a

339
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,160
contract you signed before you were

340
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:18,560
born. You became unwell, sick. You

341
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,519
became chronically ill for reasons that

342
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,639
were not in your control. But what is in

343
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,480
your control is your healing. No matter

344
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:32,000
what, you can heal. It is in your

345
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,079
control. And you are going to heal. As

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,639
each day goes by, you're getting closer

347
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,839
to healing. Your body's repairing

348
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,240
itself. Your body's recovering. Your

349
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,360
body wants to heal. It's working hard

350
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,440
for you every single day. So each

351
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,680
moment, each hour, each day, you're in

352
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,240
the healing process. And you have to

353
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,120
remember that you have to know that you

354
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,079
are healing and you didn't cause your

355
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,480
sickness and it's not mistakes that you

356
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,480
made. Never believe in any way that it's

357
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,800
because of you and because of any

358
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,279
mistakes you made along the way because

359
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,959
that's not true. That's not how chronic

360
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:18,160
illness works. We cannot judge ourselves

361
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,360
for why we're sick. We cannot beat

362
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,399
ourselves up for why we're sick. We have

363
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,959
to be gentle about it. We have to be

364
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,680
easy on ourselves. We have to have

365
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,639
compassion for ourselves. And you have

366
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,600
to know that every day your body is

367
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,440
getting closer to healing. If you get a

368
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,839

376
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,639
Many blessings and God bless you.

377
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,440
Your body is fighting for you every day

378
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,400
and loves you unconditionally. Your body

379
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,480
wants to heal and it will heal. And it

380
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,520
is healing. And it's healing every

381
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,640
single hour of every single day. This is

382
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,839
a truth you can hold on to and never let

383
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,280
it go. Let it be a healing seed, a seed

384
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,039
that's planted, a seed that grows with

385
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,360
every little thing you do for your

386
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,799
health. Always remember you're a good

387
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,520
person. And this is your time to heal.

388
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,400
Never be hard on yourself. Never judge

389
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,160
yourself. Every single morning you wake

390
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,760
up, gently pat yourself on the shoulder.

391
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,480
Tell yourself you're working hard. Tell

392
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,039
yourself you're working for God. Tell

393
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,520
yourself God sees you and understands

394
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,880
your struggles. And tell yourself your

395
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,600
body just did more healing. And when you

396
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,640
lay down to go to bed at night, keep in

397
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,600
mind you have an audience. Keep in mind

398
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,400
the angels are there. Call upon them.

399
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,200
Ask them to sit by your bedside. You

400
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,360
deserve it. You're worthy. You're worth

401
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,760
it to the angels. They see your

402
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,559
struggles. They know what a good person

403
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,039
you are. They know the good works you're

404
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,520
going to do when you're healed. They

405
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,520
know the good works you're doing now.

406
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,720
And the angels know what kind of soul

407
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,120
you have, what kind of soul you are. And

408
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,080
never doubt who you are. You're a good

409
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,480
soul. It's not your fault you got sick.

410
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,600
You didn't create it. You didn't cause

411
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,799
it. It wasn't a form of punishment God

412
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,160
was placing upon you. And you can heal

413
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,360
and you will heal. This is your time.

414
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,520
And always keep in the back of your mind

415
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,760
that good days are coming. And you're

416
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,520
going to look back in the past and

417
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,480
you're going to see how far you have

418
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:59,640
come, how far along you have gone with

419
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,640
your healing.

420
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Original

421
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,919
published medical medium information

422
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,919
gets stolen and poached by podcast

423
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,840
doctors, social media doctors,

424
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,600
influencers, and medical clinics.

425
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,440
Medical medium information has never yet

426
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,440
been proven wrong by medical science and

427
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,120
research. Instead, the opposite, only

428
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,039
proven right and then taken from medical

429
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,720
medium published material and used in

430
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,720
the conventional and alternative health

431
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,720
communities. Medical medium information

432
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,240
continually sets the stage for medical

433
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
science to understand chronic illness

434
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,160
better. If you choose to share or use

435
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,080
the original unique content from the

436
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,400
Medical Medium podcast, books, or

Medical Medium social media, please site

438
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,360
where this information comes from so

439
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,880
others who see and learn of this

440
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,400
information have a chance to know where

441
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,160
it all originates to give them an

442
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,919
opportunity to heal so they don't end up

443
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,919
losing years of their life searching for

444
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,760
answers like so many have before them.

445
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,760
The medical medium information here on

446
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,679
this podcast doesn't come from broken

447
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,679
science, interest groups, medical

448
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,400
funding with strings attached, botched

449
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,480
research, lobbyists, internal kickbacks,

450
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,559
persuaded belief systems, private panels

451
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,240
of influencers, health field payoffs,

452
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
trendy traps, or gathered bits and

453
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,000
pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because

454
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,919
chronic illness is exploding like never

455
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
before in our modern-day history, it

456
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,600
takes a greater force than us down here.

457
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,360
It takes a helping hand from above.

458
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,039
Medical medium information has street

459
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,240
cred. It's an organic movement of

460
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,000
countless people around the world

461
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,840
healing more healing stories of real

462
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
people not being paid to tell their

463
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,600
life-changing experiences of rising out

464
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,679
of the ashes of sickness and entering

465
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,360
into the light of full recovery, getting

466
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,880
their lives back and finally healing

467
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,320
when nothing else in the world of health

468
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,400
could move the needle and get them

469
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,720
better. The information on this podcast

470
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,559
is not man-made. It comes from above,

471
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,559
from a higher source. Whatever you

472
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,400
believe in, whether God, the universe,

473
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,760
the light, or the creator, or if you

474
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,039
believe in nothing at all, that we're

475
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,799
just floating through space together on

476
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,559
this rock, know that the information you

477
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,320
hear on this podcast is separate from

478
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,000
all the other noise out there. It comes

479
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,559
from a different place. A pure

480
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,520
untampered with advanced clean

481
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:25,840
uncorrupted original primary source. A

482
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,840
higher source, spirit of compassion.
