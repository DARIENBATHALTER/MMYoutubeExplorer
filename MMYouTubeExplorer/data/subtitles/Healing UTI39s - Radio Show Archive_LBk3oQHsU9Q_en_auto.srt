there' be this process where it takes a

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
little time you know all of a sudden you

58
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,599

great um so it's really important to

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
know so listen I just got to tell you

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
something this is I say this at the

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
beginning of every show for a real real

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,080
important reason you know the

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,040
information on this show here you can't

67
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,040
get anywhere else it's not possible and

68
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,519
if you did get it anywhere else it came

69
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,640
from me originally whether anybody likes

70
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,680
it or not so it's really important to

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,159
understand the information here doesn't

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,840
it's not backed by interest groups it

73
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,440
doesn't come from in interest groups it

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,360
doesn't come from medical funding with

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,000
strings attached it doesn't come from

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,920
botched research with the thumb on the

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,400
scale because there's money behind it

78
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,319
because that's what happens with almost

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,159
every study I hate to say it you guys

80
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,480
when it comes down to chronic illness

81
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,080
when it comes down to chronic illness

82
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,599
especially any s any study that's done

83
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,959
there's somebody putting a thumb on the

84
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,040
scale I'm sorry it's just the way it

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,159
works I know this for a fact I know

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,519
people in the field in the Science World

87
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,720
I know you name it and I've heard and

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,480
seen it all I know how it works there's

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,640
no persuaded belief systems with the

90
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,440
information that I'm giving you there's

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,319
no private panels of influencers that

92
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,440
you guys have no idea exist in

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,720
alternative medicine all throughout

94
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,280
alternative medicine to have something

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,400
come out a certain way so it can then be

96
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,959
to Al used in a certain way it's just

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,720
how it works investors invest in all

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
aspects of alternative medicine and

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,640
conventional medicine and guess what we

100
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,200
are free from it you need to know this

101
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,560
if you're a first-time listener it's

102
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,760
that critical to know trust me it is

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,760
that critical to know because it's

104
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,599
important no private panels of

105
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,480
influencers no health field payoffs and

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,920
no trendy traps those nasty trendy traps

107
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,079
that confuse people to stop them from

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,319
healing taking advantage of their

109
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,959
vulnerabilities of being sick for a long

110
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,400
time and not knowing what direction to

111
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,360
go and sucking them in with trendy traps

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,200
there are so many of them at this point

113
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,040
it is endless and it is actually

114
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,840
sickening so that's a whole thing there

115
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,479
so I'm just telling you this Joe does

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,079
not have any of that it's the only

117
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:22,160
Health show out there in the world

118
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,720

119
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,800

00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,840
you know or if it's BV or if it's a

167
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,360
yeast infection and yeast infections

168
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,280
being thrown in there left and right

169
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,400

170
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,759

00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,599
really knows how do you like that isn't

173
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,560

178
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,880
you know hey nobody really knows I'm

179
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,720
just being honest that's just how it

180
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,880
works I've talked to a lot of urologists

181
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,639
over the years too talked to a lot of

182
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,919
them and you know that basically the

183
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,000
protocol is is basically the bottom line

184
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,879
is here just take this antibiotic and

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,400
and go off in your way and we'll see

186
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,960
what the lab says or we'll see what a

187
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,400
culture says and and but what kind of

188
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,240
bacteria is really going on for a UTI

189
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,639
for real urinary tract

190
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,479
infection and is it just yeast as yeast

191
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,879
infection these are all the important

192
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,639
questions and it's all important to know

193
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:26,319
how things work so let's cut into it a

194
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,240
UTI is bacterial you ready for this you

195
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,360
ready for

196
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,199
this a yeast infection no this isn't

197
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,120
someone's going to say oh okay duh it's

198
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,440
bacterial UTI okay isn't it bacterial

199
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,960
you can just hop on line and look a

200
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,599
yeast infection is

201
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,479
bacterial that's right that's right a

202
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,120
yeast infection is bacterial if you know

203
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,639
that already it came from me originally

204
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,960
I'm the first person that actually put

205
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,759
that out there years

206
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:55,520
ago exactly a yeast infection is

207
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,400
bacterial bacterial that's right really

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,240
important to know this really important

209
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,360
yeast will be present many times when

210
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,520
bacteria is jacking up when bacteria is

211
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,639
is you know working its way up to the

212
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,680
surface when when bacteria is flowing

213
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,800
when it's growing when it's

214
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,599
proliferating when it's

215
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,479
evolving that's right and what will

216
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:25,240
happen is yeast will try to beat it out

217
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:28,039
it will try to beat it out because yeast

218
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,039
its job is to gobble everything that

219
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,599
shouldn't be around so that bacteria

220
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,599
doesn't take over so when you have

221
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,599
symptoms of a yeast infection and you go

222
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,760
on to the doctor and you're on a yeast

223
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,880
infection um treatment what's really

224
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,959
happening is there's a bacterial

225
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,240
infection that's

226
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,720
underlying and that is the problem right

227
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,360
there that there's that's why the yeast

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,040
infection comes and comes and it keeps

229
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,560
on coming and it over and over get

230
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,000
another yeast infection n another yeast

231
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,519
infection that's because bacteria is not

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,600
being dealt with another yeast infection

233
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,760
that's because it's bacterial it's

234
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,000
bacterial there's a a bacteria involved

235
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,000
another yeast infection there it goes

236
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,079
that's how it works that's how it works

237
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,519
and you know for years for years you

238
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,800
know UTI have always been a mystery a

239
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,000
mystery to research in science I'm just

240
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
telling you right now they got a couple

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,200
of treatments they pump you up with

242
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,120
steroids if it gets really bad and they

243
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,920
pump you up with tons of antibiotics

244
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,040
whether they do it IV both steroids or

245
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,720
antibiotics IV or whether they they

246
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,519
administer it orally that's that's

247
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,600
basically the treatment and whatever Hit

248
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,240
or Miss whatever happens if it finally

249
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,560
subsides and it eases

250
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,160
off and you know you're able to you're

251
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,000
able to get through it it it could come

252
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,320
back again you could get the bleeding

253
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,880
the whole bit we're going to talk about

254
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,839
why the bleeding comes what the bleeding

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
is of course it can run into the kidneys

256
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,480
it could be it could start from the

257
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,240
kidneys it could start from the urea

258
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,200
thre the Ura it can start from it can

259
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,200
start from

260
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,720
anywhere and can start from the bladder

261
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,640
you know bladder infection of course

262
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,399
could be all three areas could be just

263
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,920
one area nobody really knows I mean a

264
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,839
real serious kidney infection a

265
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,160
bacterial serious bacterial kidney

266
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,560
infection doctors can most most of the

267
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,240
time be like okay no this is in the

268
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,160
kidney it's actually the kidney this is

269
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,720
it this is severe let's do you know lots

270
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,079
of antibiotics let's do a treatment of

271
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,120
steroids let's try to get this under

272
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,120
control but what is that bacteria that

273
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,120
even gets to that point for some so many

274
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,560
people out there what is it in what kind

275
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,880
it's strep it's strep a cacus it's strep

276
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,240
that's what it is it's the strep throat

277
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,760
that we had at one time in our lives

278
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,160
it's the strep that gets in the sinuses

279
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,560
it's the same strep that causes

280
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,240
sinusitis for so many people it sits in

281
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,639
the cavities and the sinus cavities and

282
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,000
sits in there and it gets in it just it

283
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,480
works in the it works in the canals of

284
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,320
the sinus passages it gets in there and

285
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,279
it stays in there for years for so many

286
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,320
people who get chronic sinusitis chronic

287
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,760
allergies sinus infections and and

288
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,480
anything can tip it over you got some

289
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,399
hay fever anything that triggers it

290
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,920
anything out there Foods or whatever it

291
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,639
could feed the bacteria the bacteria

292
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,440
your immune system can be you know

293
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,440
overrun by so many contaminantes out

294
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,399
there that the bacteria can just start

295
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,279
taking

296
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,680
over and so and that happens really

297
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,959
common with sinusitis people with

298
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,560
sinuses sinus problems but that same

299
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,959
bacteria that's in our system and it

300
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,800
just isn't strap a through

301
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:32,000
H okay it used to be a and b

302
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,200
now we've come to a place where at least

303
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,519
science and research is at least at

304
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,560
least acknowledging more groups of strep

305
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,639
I was telling people about more groups

306
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,839
of strep when I was eight years old

307
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,480
hearing it from Spirit okay I was also

308
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,880
told by Spirit at 8 years old that there

309
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,720
would be so many groups of strep that

310
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,279
you couldn't even fit it in the alphabet

311
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,519
you would need more than one alphabet to

312
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:02,959
actually fit it all in

313
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,480
okay and guess what we're up to H and

314
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm going to tell you right now we're

315
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,720
far past H and maybe they're already

316
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,440
tacking on a couple more hi JK maybe

317
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,600
they're about to head there but that's

318
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,600
how many different groups of strep never

319
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,720
mind the mutated varieties in every

320
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,959
single group that science and research

321
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,959
have no idea

322
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,560
about so many varieties of strep and

323
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,560
it's everywhere it's on public toilet

324
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,680
seats it's on the public toilet handle

325
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,120
it's on restaurant door knobs it's you

326
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,320
know you walk into a restaurant you know

327
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,560
what I do when I walk into a restaurant

328
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,399
you know what I do a first thing I ask

329
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,920
Spirit if there's anything on the handle

330
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,959
that's the first thing I do I say to

331
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,360
Spirit there's anything on the door

332
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,000
handle spirit says no if there's no flu

333
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,079
virus or there's no nothing on the door

334
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,320
handle um then then I'll just I'll grab

335
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,079
the door handle but I'll always grab the

336
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,040
door handle underneath the door handle

337
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,160
in a spot that not everybody thinks to

338
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,279
grab it and then I also asked Spirit did

339
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,760
someone think to be kind of like tricky

340
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,680
too where they can you know grab the

341
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,880
underneath the door handle did someone

342
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,760
already do

343
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,000
that you know and and it you know I'll

344
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,760
get the first thing I'll ask is Spirit

345
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,480
okay and you know and I'll grab the

346
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,480
underneath or I'll take my pinky I'll

347
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,760
open the door with my pinky underneath

348
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,720
it because the last thing I need right

349
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,399
now is another variety of strep or some

350
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,079
other variety of strep or anything you

351
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,440
know that could have got could get into

352
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,480
me or whatever the last thing I need is

353
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,040
is any variety of strep and I've been

354
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,279
fortunate and I'm strep free and I've

355
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,480
been very happy and fortunate about it

356
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,360
but he gets in almost everybody and

357
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,800
everybody everybody everybody in so many

358
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,199
different ways and not just UTI not just

359
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,480
sinusitis and sinist problems but strep

360
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:41,160
throats sore throats that aren't

361
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,560
diagnosed as strep throat because they

362
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,199
can't find the strep on the surface

363
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
because it's not your first strep throat

364
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,480
so then you still have these sore

365
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,120
throats you get these random sore

366
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,519
throats you get run down which also

367
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,519
means there's an Epstein bar present

368
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,480
somewhere in the body

369
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,759
somewhere and so it's easy to pick up

370
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
strap they can pick it up anywhere so

371
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,519
you can pick it up with physical contact

372
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,680
with people and and everything like that

373
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,880
and that's another thing too is that so

374
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,759
many people have different varieties of

375
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,040
strep and it's and here's the problem so

376
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,360
many people have been on so many

377
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,639
different antibiotics and different

378
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,279
kinds of

379
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:15,720
antibiotics that they their strep could

380
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,399
be antibiotic resistant that's another

381
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,320
thing too so you can have all these

382
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,600
different antibiotic resistant streps

383
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,320
floting around where they're they're

384
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
resistant to one type of antibiotic but

385
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,639
maybe not to another but then you got

386
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,160
people that have had strep in their

387
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,199
system all all through their lives

388
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,759
causing all all kinds of symptoms like

389
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,720
lots of acne cuz strep is actually

390
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,399
behind acne cystic acne is caused by

391
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,240
strep I'm just going to tell you right

392
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,240
now and you know when you have this kind

393
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,519
of strep in the system and it's in there

394
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,399
cooking people take antibiotics they

395
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,079
take antibiotics for a flu virus they

396
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,279
take antibiotics for bronchitis and all

397
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,160
of a sudden the strep gets fed a new

398
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,800
antibiotic then it upgrades itself this

399
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,360
is how it works and sometimes we have to

400
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,720
use antibiotics we're in crisis Zone

401
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,680
we're not taking care of ourselves we're

402
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,120
not taking the right supplements to take

403
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,759
care of our immune systems we're not

404
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,680
eating the right foods and so we end up

405
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,519
just like in an emergency situation or

406
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,000
like oh my God dear Lord I got this

407
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,360
infection or some my eyes blown up sty

408
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,680
sty are strep that's what causes a sty

409
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:21,680
you know the IAI that's

410
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:24,560
strep and not only that you guys sibo

411
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,639
that's strep that's strep in the gut

412
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,240
that's not just overgrowth of bacteria

413
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,519
that's overgrowth of strep that was fed

414
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,319
antibiotics along the way from childhood

415
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,199
on in some capacity and if it wasn't

416
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,440
antibiotics actually literally

417
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,319
administered treatment from a doctor

418
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,600
prescribed and you've taken it was

419
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:46,440
antibiotics you received from the water

420
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,160
supply or antibiotics you received from

421
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,440
food I mean not every single person has

422
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,360
eaten a piece of chicken that's organic

423
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,399
antibiotic free I'm sorry but that was

424
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
just recently that it's mostly out and

425
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,839
still all the restaurants Stock the

426
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,199
regular chicken that's loaded win

427
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,160
antibiotics so nowh no matter what you

428
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:09,000
get the antibiotics in you so they're in

429
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,120
there and they feed strep and then we

430
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,880
end up with something like a

431
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,720
UTI a lot of time also sexual contact

432
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,839
you know a new partner or something and

433
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,759
you know and and bugs bug normal bugs

434
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,519
like strep that that are everywhere they

435
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,160
just pass along and then a person gets

436
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,480
their first

437
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,360
UTI or their second kind after they

438
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,160
haven't had them for too many

439
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,720
years so it's just around and you know

440
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,959
sorry about the story I know I did that

441
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,560
long story about the grabbing the door

442
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,839
handle but that's true and then the

443
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,240
bathroom handle I actually just take my

444
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,000
wrist and kind of use my wrist around

445
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,680
the door handle or something you know to

446
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,880
try not to touch the bathroom handle I

447
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,560
mean maybe it's I'm I'm a little too

448
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,399
much with that but the thing is is I

449
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,319
know what where bugs are anyway cuz

450
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,199
Spirit tells me when I sit on the plane

451
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:01,920
I know if there's merca on my my plane

452
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,199
seat I know if there's you know I know

453
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,439
if there's tuberculosis you know cuz

454
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,439
someone coughed and sneezed tuberculosis

455
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,760
all over my my airline seat and I can

456
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,799
ask spirit so you know it so yeah of

457
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,319
course it's something that had been

458
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,079
given as a gift to know through

459
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,839
throughout my life and it it's helped me

460
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,799
but I realize you guys don't have that

461
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,880
so you know to bring handy wipes and

462
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,799
stuff like that bring handy wipes always

463
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,199
have the handy wipes it's really

464
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,720
important but the bottom line why does

465
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,039
it matter because you can get strep on

466
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,919
your finger and stick it in your eye and

467
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,320
have a sty and it could be your first

468
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:37,240
sty for the first time and then after

469
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,880
that a year later you have a UTI and

470
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,360
have no idea why or how you got that

471
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,760
UTI because what it was it started with

472
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,559
the sty and it went into the body and

473
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,240
into the system and it got down to where

474
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,760
it got down to this is how it

475
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,960
works so it's not about fearing life

476
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,480
it's not about that at all it's about

477
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,039
knowledge is power it's about knowing a

478
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,720
lot it's about knowing everything it's

479
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,600
about knowing all the things you need

480
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,159
cuz guess what's worse than not not

481
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,520
knowing what you need to know I'll tell

482
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,720
you what's

483
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,400
worse is not knowing what you need to

484
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,880
know gu that's what I'm trying to

485
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,760
say so you need to know what's what's

486
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,120
going on I think I mixed it up there a

487
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,440
little bit just bear with me you need to

488
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,640
know what's going on because there's

489
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,640
nothing worse than not knowing that's it

490
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,559
that's it that's it talking too fast

491
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,880
talking way too fast somebody I think

492
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,720
someone did a comment while back was on

493
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,320
social media and they said he talks too

494
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,720
slow he talks too slow and so I was like

495
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,159
oh God you know it's the second time I

496
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,559
heard I talks too slow and then and then

497
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,919
I picked it up a little bit it just

498
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,360
naturally happened I guess and someone

499
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:45,880
say he talks too fast I can't listen to

500
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,960
him all right okay go back to yeast

501
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,440
infections yeast infections candida

502
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,640
other types of yeast there's a lot of

503
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,120
different varieties of yeast there's a

504
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,880
lot of different varities of fungus some

505
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,799
some are really mean and nasty and some

506
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,640
are just friendly and nice and great

507
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,880
some friendly nice cute special fluffy

508
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,640
light and Airy fungus which isn't bad is

509
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,000
there to stop

510
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,600
bacteria it's there to stop bacteria it

511
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
could be irritating could be agitating

512
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,520
could be problematic but it's there to

513
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,720
try to gobble up

514
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,480
proteins and other things like that

515
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,679
other things like bad hormones and

516
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,039
proteins that are in eggs and other

517
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,720
things and all this that find their way

518
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,559
into the bladder and they find their way

519
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,600
into the vaginal area and they just find

520
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,000
their way all over the place and and the

521
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,919
yeast wants to just start eating it up

522
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,280
and gobbling it up because if it doesn't

523
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,200
guess what's going to feed off of it

524
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,799
it's going to be strep that's what's

525
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,720
going to feed off of it when yeast is

526
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,799
present strp is present it's in there

527
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,960
somewhere it's in the

528
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:51,880
system that's the whole thing when

529
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,240
someone is exploding with candida in

530
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,080
their intestinal track that means strep

531
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,880
is rampant Pro proliferating and going

532
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,559
crazy also in there

533
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,720
too so that's why the candid is freaking

534
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,720
out because it's trying to gobble all

535
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,640
the bad fats everybody's eating on these

536
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,000
high trendy fat diets it's trying to

537
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,280
gobble all this crazy

538
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,120
stuff it's not trying to gobble fruit

539
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,360
it's not trying to gobble

540
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,640
vegetables but it's gobbling all this

541
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,440
other stuff because it's trying not to

542
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,120
let the shrep like ignite and

543
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,240
proliferate and grow and just and and

544
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,320
and move and vastly you know Cruise

545
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,440
through the

546
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,360
system so very important to know how it

547
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,880
works same thing yeast infection same

548
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,080
thing with BV it's all strep related yes

549
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,039
it is and the groups of strep are now

550
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,799
way past the alphabet we have including

551
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,480
two alphabets but science and research

552
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,919
is so behind it's unbelievable

553
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,559
especially with chronic illness anything

554
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,679
to do with chronic illness it's so

555
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,760
behind don't get science confused don't

556
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,640
get don't get confused about the good

557
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,600
parts of science don't get confused

558
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,760
about what they do with with like like

559
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,799
mathematics and they try to create uh

560
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,520
parts and they try to they try to build

561
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,159
things and they try to create better

562
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,880
equipment for diagnosis and everything

563
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,280
else don't get confused by that science

564
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,799
versus chronic illness where science

565
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
research knows nothing about I'm sorry

566
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,039
they know nothing about chronic illness

567
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,919
we got over 250 million sick people in

568
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,279
the US alone 250 million with symptoms

569
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,760
and

570
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,360
conditions okay and I'm just going to be

571
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,360
straightforward science of research

572
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,880
doesn't even have their finger on the

573
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,159
pulse they still think autoimmune is the

574
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,799
body attacking itself it's unbelievable

575
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,320
if you want to learn more about that get

576
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,880
thyroid healing my book thyroid healing

577
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,120
if you don't have my books here's some

578
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,600
someone said this the other day that

579
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,480
said why do I need your books I can

580
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,360
listen to your radio shows I that that's

581
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,760
that's that's unbelievable because the I

582
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,200
can't cover a fraction of what's in the

583
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,760
books in these radio shows I just can't

584
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,360
it's not even possible so thyroid

585
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,320
healing talks about the autoimmune great

586
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,559
mistake that we have right now that's

587
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,279
going on that that you know someone I

588
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,840
think someone was saying to me like I

589
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm kind of upset at you and I said what

590
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,400
are you talking about you're upset at me

591
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,799
what do you mean and they said well my

592
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,320
body is attacking itself I said what and

593
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:09,960
they go my body is attacking itself and

594
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,799
you're wrong because my body's attacking

595
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,200
itself I was diagnosed with an

596
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,360
autoimmune disease and my body is

597
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,960
attacking itself how dare you say your

598
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,559
body's not attacking

599
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,240
itself and it it would it just blew me

600
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:26,400
away actually it blew me away it totally

601
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,760
did the body attacks a virus not the

602
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,039
body tissue not the not the body cells I

603
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,159
talk about it in great detail in thyroid

604
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,679
healing and I've talked about it on

605
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,520
shows too it's not attacking a single

606
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,080
cell in the body your immune system is

607
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,880
working for you it's not working against

608
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,640
you on any level it gives people

609
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,200
tremendous tremendous tremendous relief

610
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
and gets them healing especially what

611
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,559
they know what to do with their automine

612
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,240
especially when they know how to heal

613
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,520
their thyroid finally especially when

614
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,919
they know how to heal themselves from

615
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,200
lupus especially when they know how to

616
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:56,679
heal themselves from ra and everything

617
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,200
else so when someone gets all upset

618
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,000
because they they like the fact that

619
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,000
their body's attacking itself I I don't

620
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,640
get that

621
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,480
one I don't get that one I really don't

622
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,400
so I was just like okay okay all right

623
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
fine sorry sorry your body's hacking

624
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,159
itself okay

625
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,000
fine you know you know the thing is is

626
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,600
is is

627
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,640
uh the thing is that when it comes down

628
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,320
to chronic illness like I was saying

629
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,799
very little is known about any of it

630
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,480
there's plenty of fancy

631
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,480
names okay and but you have to

632
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,279
understand something the science and

633
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,039
research behind chronic illness and what

634
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,720
is out there and the studies and whatnot

635
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,919
that are out there and everything they

636
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,320
are paid for and they are funded for all

637
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:36,520
the wrong directions for all the wrong

638
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,760
reasons that's the way the system is

639
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,919
built and guess what it funnels itself

640
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,799
down to UTI and urinari tract infections

641
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:47,039
you better believe it it really does

642
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,000
where are we today with UTI you either

643
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,679
get an antibiotic or you get a steroid

644
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,440
and see you later hopefully it goes away

645
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,000
someday that's where we are chronic

646
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,279
illness with science and research go to

647
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,480
an alternative doctor he might give you

648
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,960
an herb or two he might give you some

649
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,960
cranberry extract he might give you

650
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,840
something might she might give you this

651
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,360
whatever but in the end they're still

652
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,120
not going to know it's really strep and

653
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,640
it's it's in it's in it's in the system

654
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,679
and it's deep in the system and it has

655
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,159
to be warded out it has to be weeded out

656
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,720
it has to come out of your system you

657
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,159
got to kill off the strep you got to not

658
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,600
feed it and that's another thing you got

659
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,400
to learn to not feed the strep in order

660
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,960
to get better from UTI

661
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,039
UTI okay that keep on coming and coming

662
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,360
and coming the bacteria is feeding off

663
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,840
of something it really likes whether

664
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,600
it's feeding off of something it really

665
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,240
likes inside the liver whether it's

666
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,640
feeding it's feeding off of something it

667
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,080
really likes it's coming from other

668
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,720
places the kidneys you know and and

669
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,480
because it's it's all getting through

670
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,799
osmosis all you know the way the body

671
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,640
eliminates both the intestinal tract and

672
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:46,480
the kidneys and there's fuel for the

673
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,840
bacteria to

674
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,640
thrive and here's the

675
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,799
thing the yeast with yeast infections is

676
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,760
just kind of a little outer

677
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:02,760
sign then you got strep ins inside okay

678
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,480
inside the reproductive system then you

679
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,679
got it inside the

680
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,679
gut and it that's how it

681
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,919
works and then you have a little bit

682
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,120
inside the liver and and that's how it

683
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,679
works it's not scary there's nothing

684
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,159
scary about it in fact it's great

685
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,799
because when you know what's up we're

686
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
going to do some strep killing we're

687
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,919
going to kick its butt we're going to

688
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,240
knock it out of the system you're not

689
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,600
going to have to deal with the sty

690
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,799
anymore you're not going to have to deal

691
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,440
with the sinus infections anymore you're

692
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,399
not going to have to deal with the UTI

693
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,559
all that will minimize and minimize and

694
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:35,360
minimize and be less and less and less

695
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:37,480
you'll get the antibiotics out of your

696
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,320
system you'll get them out of your your

697
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,960
your um your liver you'll get them out

698
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,200
of your spine the antibiotics will start

699
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,080
leaving your system so they won't even

700
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,480
be able to feed the different varieties

701
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,039
of strep that are mutated that that are

702
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,360
actually mutated because of antibiotic

703
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,919
use for you know over the century so all

704
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,279
this is really

705
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,480
important and you know so let's talk

706
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,440
about severity of UTI okay um sometimes

707
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,360
it's just a burning sometimes it's just

708
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,919
a burning

709
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,159
itching um sometimes it's a little bit

710
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,360
of pain um urinating in general with the

711
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,799
bladder sometimes you can have like

712
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,799
bladder spasms going on where you're

713
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,000
feeling bladder spasms sometimes you can

714
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,360
have achy kidneys you could have

715
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,960
achiness all over the body you could

716
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,320
have a fever and different levels and

717
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,279
different kinds and different kinds of

718
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,679
strep cause different kinds of UTI and

719
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,760
then you could have the bleeding too

720
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,440
which is

721
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:30,360
rupturing rupturing of tiny micro blood

722
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,799
vessels cap lares that are rupturing and

723
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,360
they're rupturing because of a bacterial

724
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,919
overload and so the bacteria is causing

725
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,159
rupturing in the little blood vessels

726
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,000
next thing you know you're urinating

727
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,159
blood

728
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,240
everywhere so there's different levels

729
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,760
of of how this could work some people

730
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,799
they can also just get a really bad

731
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,240
kidney strep infection for the first

732
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:51,840
time it comes along with the worst case

733
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,039
Amano they ever had and maybe they're in

734
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,279
college or something or it's summer time

735
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,200
and you know after after college is over

736
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,600
and it's summertime and then a lot of

737
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,679
women young women go through this where

738
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,960
they have the worst the first UT UTI in

739
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:05,559
their life it's the worst there's

740
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,799
bleeding there's kidney infection

741
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:09,880
there's fever they're they're at their

742
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,960
pediatrician and if they still have a

743
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,320
pediatrician most most people keep their

744
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,600
pediatricians all the way until they

745
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,320
like 20 now and then you know and or

746
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,200
they end up at the ER they end up with

747
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,760
an antibiotic some steroids they'll stay

748
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,640
a night in a hospital if the fever's

749
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,279
High um and then they'll go home and

750
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,600
then that's their first you know kind of

751
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,279
weird UTI with that weird UTI is that's

752
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,240
a strep infection

753
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:34,440
100% so I'm trying to give you all the

754
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,159
different scenarios before you know we

755
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,600
got a little time we got a little time

756
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,279
to burn as far as the I got plenty of

757
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,360
things we're going to do for UTI but we

758
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,679
have a little time to talk about the

759
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,960
different scenarios the different

760
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,519
severities and levels and then there's

761
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,360
just regular like I said before it's

762
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,039
just a little pain a little twitch a

763
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,720
little nerve twitch um um little spasm

764
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:57,679
when urinating a little itch a little

765
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,200
burn um you know there's that too and

766
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,640
there's that rundown feeling you can get

767
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,440
with it too you can get kind of run down

768
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,600
your throat gets a little kind of horse

769
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,399
it gets a little uh little sore while

770
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,640
you're getting like a

771
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,320
UTI um happens with women a lot when

772
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,159
they have their cycle right after right

773
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,399
before their cycle they they get a UTI

774
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,039
and it could happen each month and it

775
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,799
can happen every six months but it does

776
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,640
happen and it happens more than anybody

777
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,960
knows and it happens all the time it's

778
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,840
it's like if you if you can count how

779
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,240
many from mild to severe UTI are

780
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,840
occurring or East infection UTI are

781
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,760
occurring just across the country at any

782
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,200
given time you wouldn't believe what it

783
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,960
would be it would be it would blow your

784
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,039
mind and then if you know tack on sinus

785
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,799
infections and also lung infections too

786
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,519
there's a lot of lung problems people

787
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,919
have where they have a chronic cough

788
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,480
they go to doctors they take tons of

789
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,000
antibiotics and they haven't had a flu

790
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,640
they haven't had a cold or anything and

791
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,640
they got this chronic wheezing chronic

792
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,200
cough chronic lung problems that's also

793
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,399
strep that sits inside the lungs for a

794
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,320
lot of different people and that's a

795
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,039
different variety of strep

796
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,519
and that strep just incubates in lungs

797
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,320
while you're taking antibiotics for it

798
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,799
and whatever and it get just doesn't get

799
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,559
it's becomes immune to different

800
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,080
antibiotics and that's a different kind

801
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,799
of strip but those people also get U

802
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,360
periodically throughout life it's it's

803
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:16,279
it's it's just all in our system and so

804
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,919
now it's time what do we do and how do

805
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:18,679
we you know fix this how do we get

806
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,240
things

807
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,039
better why does

808
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,159
cranberry why does cranberry work why

809
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:28,559
does cranberry work it must have worked

810
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,559
at one point for

811
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,880
someone right cranberry juice or

812
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,519
Cranberry extract or cranberry pills or

813
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,440
something it must have worked at one

814
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,080
point for

815
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,919
somebody keep in mind cranberry is a

816
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:47,480
fruit cranberry is a fruit keep that in

817
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:51,360
mind really important any fruit helps a

818
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:54,360
UTI any fruit there's a reason for that

819
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,159
the sugars and fruits can't feed any

820
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,320
bacteria can't feed any virus can't feed

821
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,880
any any yeast can't feed anything the

822
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,399
sugars and

823
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:09,440
fruits they can't feed anything bad but

824
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:14,320
what they do is those sugars bond to

825
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,279
bacterial killers they bond to bacterial

826
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,320
killers and that

827
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:22,880
bond is what knocks out bacteria that's

828
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,240
what knocks out bacteria so for instance

829
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,919
Elderberry syrup incredible for UTI

830
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,960
taking Elderberry syrup got to get a

831
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,440
really good one high quality one and you

832
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,960
know you you get an Elderberry syrup you

833
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,159
take a tablespoon Elderberry syrup you

834
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,559
know one one tablespoon twice a day one

835
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,480
tablespoon three times a day to help

836
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,679
knock that UTI but that's not the only

837
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,240
thing you could use it that it's a

838
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:48,559
really mild UTI that could probably

839
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:50,919
work and but the sugar in Elder

840
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,480
berries is what does

841
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:57,799
it the sugar wild blueberries work

842
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,679
better for UTI than cranber

843
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:05,279
does wild blueberries do they work

844
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:08,240
better any fruit helps um knock out

845
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,919
bacteria any fruit any all the way up to

846
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,600
bananas so the fruit hating world is out

847
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,919
of control more than ever before in

848
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,440
history right now for no reason for no

849
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,679
reason you know listen to the fruit fear

850
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,799
show listen to that so you know what's

851
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:23,679
going on it's actually it's Sinister

852
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,159
it's actually Sinister so but that's

853
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,799
cranberry knocks out

854
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,559
bacteria and because antoin and not just

855
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:33,000
that other phytochemical compounds that

856
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:35,559
are

857
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,600
antibacterial attach themselves to the

858
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:40,399
sugar and it's this this sugar and the

859
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,679
antoin or the phytochemical that kills

860
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:48,559
off bacteria attached to the sugar enter

861
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:50,559
cells easily they enter organs easily

862
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,840
they enter hard to reach places where

863
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,519
strep hides and

864
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,960
incubates and that's how it works strep

865
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,039
tries to burn burrow itself in the

866
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,960
urethra it tries to burrow itself in the

867
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,559
urinary tract it tries to burrow itself

868
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,200
in the in the in the inner sides of the

869
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:11,159
of the gallbladder nobody knows that

870
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,320
nobody knows a strep makes pockets and

871
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,360
that becomes

872
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,440
cystitis down the road intercal

873
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,440
cystitis that's just that's from years

874
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,320
of having strep years and years and

875
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,760
years of having strep in the wrong diet

876
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,600
and having the wrong diet and the strep

877
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,639
feeding off of dairy and feeding off of

878
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,559
eggs or feeding off of a P of cheese on

879
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:31,559
a pizza from 20 years or feeding off of

880
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,440
you know goodies or feeding off of high

881
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,399
fat foods even if it's healthy trendy

882
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,919
high fat fat even if it's just straight

883
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:40,639
keto high fat that's somewhat healthy

884
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,799
whatever it is Strep loves lots of fats

885
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:45,600
it loves lots of fat and it loves lots

886
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,039
of it loves lots of also other things

887
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,639
that are in Foods it loves what's in

888
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,600
eggs it loves what's in that stuff it

889
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:52,440
loves what's in corn it loves what it

890
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,600
actually loves Woodson actually with in

891
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,039
corn that's different than fruit

892
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,559
entirely different corn is different

893
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,039
than fruit it loves Woodson

894
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:02,639
um a lot of these things loves what's in

895
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,039
pork and so you know so when you have

896
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:05,360
pork when you have bacon and you think

897
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:08,200
Bacon's healthy or something you're

898
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,120
having bacon that's just that just keeps

899
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,799
strep around forever and eventually you

900
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,360
get the you get the cystitis you get the

901
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,919
interstial cystitis and this the

902
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,320
bacteria build little pockets from

903
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,399
Little Scar Tissue Pockets start

904
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,919
building and the strep hides and these

905
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:22,600
are cells that are hard to reach for

906
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,559
anything and then when you dump in

907
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,799
Cranberry you dump in Wild blueberry you

908
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,039
dump in Elderberry in your system and it

909
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:34,600
and and it goes into cells in hard to

910
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:37,720
reach places excuse me hard to reach

911
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,559
places and it gets in there deep and it

912
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,240
starts pushing out the bacteria starts

913
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,240
knocking it out it starts getting it out

914
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,399
of there another thing that's in fruits

915
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,480
like cranberry W blueberry and

916
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,880
Elderberry and I'm just saying those

917
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,240
three never mind a whole bunch of others

918
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,159
I could be saying just tons of fruit

919
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,480
whatever papaya whatever you know what's

920
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,840
in there lots of vitamin C heavy loads

921
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,480
of vitamin C guess what bacteria hates

922
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,760
it hates vitamin C with avengeance with

923
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,960
everything it's got it hates vitamin C

924
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,320
because vitamin C not only feeds your

925
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,080
lymphocytes your basophils your

926
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,679
monocytes your neutrophils not only does

927
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,040
it feed your immune system to go after

928
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:15,280
strep and identify it tag it and and bag

929
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,440
it not only does it have that ability to

930
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,839
do all

931
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,679
that but What vitamin c does it's

932
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,240
poisonous it's a toxin to bacteria it's

933
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,000
actually highly toxic to bacteria only

934
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,440
That's What vitamin C is highly tox

935
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,040
toxic to bacteria so when you have

936
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,800
cranberry juice what's in cranberry

937
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,200
juice you got this this this special

938
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,679
vitamin C that's just just in

939
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,440
cranberries that's just in Wild

940
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,560
blueberry that's just an Elderberry that

941
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,320
vitamin C is a toxin highly toxic to

942
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,760
bacteria so these are some of the

943
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,240
reasons why it works because people

944
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,560
don't know why it works and they just

945
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,879
don't

946
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,520
know so that's what's happening there

947
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,879
that's what's going on okay so another

948
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,639
thing to understand when you're dealing

949
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,720
with um when you're dealing with

950
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,720
bacteria strep causing UTI is you don't

951
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,599
want to feed it so back to those Foods

952
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,920
you got to be on the no Foods if you're

953
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,040
in you know if you're into uh if you're

954
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,119
a big animal protein person then try to

955
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,119
do the animal proteins that that that

956
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,960
don't feed strep and try to keep it

957
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,560
lowfat lots of leaner versions and not

958
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,920
too many I would honestly if you're

959
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,400
somebody dealing with UTI I would try to

960
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,000
get off the animal protein for a little

961
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,680
while and try to do something like the

962
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,160
28 day cleanse or try to do something

963
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,240
you know my first book or try to do

964
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,680
something and listen if if you're a

965
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,880
vegan and you're plant-based and you got

966
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,760
UTI get off the nuts just limit them

967
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,839
they're really healthy but limit them

968
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,760
limit your fat content don't eat so many

969
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:43,400
avocados don't eat so many nuts and

970
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,280
seeds don't me eat too many oils and and

971
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,839
you know be cautious also of strange

972
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,280
grains you know a lot of vegetarians

973
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:52,560
they eat you know they still eat um

974
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,760
different you know they eat like um

975
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,440
Sprite of Buckwheat and they eat all

976
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,880
kinds of other things that they eat and

977
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,160
and that's fine but it's it's at the

978
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,119
same time too many grains too much of it

979
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,400
is not great for a UTI so that's another

980
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,079
thing too so if you're a macrobiotic you

981
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,640
know and all you do is eat GRS you know

982
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,359
try to bring in more fruit and

983
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,520
vegetables and leafy

984
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:17,240
greens and limit the grains um

985
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,319
especially the bad grains especially the

986
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,800
bad ones all the gluten all the gluten

987
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:23,200
varieties but here's the thing though

988
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,359
it's it's it's like this and if you're a

989
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,839
vegetarian just don't eat the eggs don't

990
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,160
eat the eggs don't eat the cheese time

991
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:30,400
to be if you're vegetarian you don't

992
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,680
like meat and you're afraid to eat meat

993
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,400
or it's not in your belief system or

994
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,760
whatever it is then you you should go

995
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,240
all the way plant-based I I'm you just

996
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,880
should you should be getting rid of the

997
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,720
eggs and get rid of the dairy if you

998
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,000
have

999
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,880
UTI if you're dealing with sinusitis if

1000
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,359
you're dealing with lung issues if

1001
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,480
you're dealing with sty if you're

1002
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,400
dealing with

1003
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:55,480
sio get off the eggs get off the dairy

1004
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,000
go plant-based if you're vegetarian I'm

1005
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,319
just being honest it's it's not about

1006
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,640
what side I'm picking on it's about

1007
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:01,160
what's right for the problem and that's

1008
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,720
what I'm trying to say I'm I don't I

1009
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,720
don't I'm not sucked into a belief

1010
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,640
system I'm not sucked into a belief

1011
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,040
system where you can't eat a grain or

1012
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,000
you you you you you can't eat a piece of

1013
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,200
chicken if your heart desires or if you

1014
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,760
or if you're all plant-based or all raw

1015
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,119
I don't I all you whatever you want to

1016
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,880
do but I'm going to tell you right now

1017
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,680
what you should do when it comes down to

1018
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,359
what's wrong with you in that moment and

1019
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,400
with UTI animal products keep them down

1020
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:28,200
low none of the dairy none of the eggs

1021
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,680
all that just throw all that out if

1022
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,760
you're eating meat I would probably

1023
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,599
consider just knocking that back keep it

1024
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,839
down to real small portions at different

1025
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,359
times and try to do other things and you

1026
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,800
know bring in other Foods bring in sweet

1027
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,359
potatoes bring in more of those bring in

1028
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,240
Winter squash bring in regular potatoes

1029
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:46,079
because guess what those don't feed

1030
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,119
strep either none of that feeds strep

1031
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,200
but if you have a high high fat diet

1032
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,200
really high fat content what you're

1033
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,119
every what's a high fat diet it's high

1034
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,640
protein just look out look out for that

1035
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,839
it's hidden under the word high protein

1036
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,040
then that's a high fat diet so you just

1037
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,800
got to look out you're having more fats

1038
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,480
than you even know and they're in the

1039
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,680
bloodstream they're in the body and they

1040
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,240
take on the intestinal lining they they

1041
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,119
Harbor strep and you just got to min

1042
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,760
minimize if you're vegan and plant-based

1043
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,040
you can't be doing four avocados a day

1044
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,480
unless it's the only food you have then

1045
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,440
it's totally fine if you got meaning

1046
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,520
like you can do four avocados a day but

1047
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,480
if you got UTI and you got strep and you

1048
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,280
got all the strep related stuff then

1049
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,119
back it down to one avocado a day back

1050
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,400
it down to one and a half AV as a day

1051
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,200
unless you're having a get together in a

1052
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,079
party then you know go to go go crazy

1053
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,240
with the guacamole if you're paleo or

1054
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,599
you're somebody that's totally in high

1055
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,400
protein animal protein you shouldn't be

1056
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,400
eating animal protein three times a day

1057
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,839
no way you if you got strep if you got

1058
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,680
UTI if you got all these different

1059
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:45,240
problems sorry it's never going to go go

1060
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,880
go go away completely 100% you got to

1061
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,760
you got to lower your animal proteins I

1062
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,319
hate saying that I'm sorry but it's true

1063
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,079
I don't care what fancy doctor what

1064
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:53,920
fancy belief system or trend is out

1065
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,240
there right now saying you know stay

1066
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,720
away from all fruit you should just be

1067
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,200
eating tons of animal protein I don't

1068
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,200
care what it is if you got UTI they

1069
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,920
don't know what the hell they're talking

1070
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,000
about and guess what that's is how it

1071
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,040
works in the industry nobody knows what

1072
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,520
they're talking about so here's the deal

1073
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,440
is yeah I'm sarcastic a little snarky

1074
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,599
today you know but here but but like I

1075
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,760
said I I like having people not having

1076
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,560
the pressure on them I like people being

1077
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,040
being getting the relief I want people

1078
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,119
better I want people to not have to

1079
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,599
worry about that UTI that's going to

1080
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,319
sneak up on them during their wedding

1081
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,040
day you know I'm I'm just you know I'm

1082
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:27,240
I'm or when they're the most important

1083
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,319
moment in life they're about to give a

1084
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,240
speech somewhere and they're getting the

1085
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:31,960
worst UTI they've ever had I've seen it

1086
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,280
over and over year after year out there

1087
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,240
in the old days I've seen it and even

1088
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,119
now people getting those UTI and they

1089
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,920
sneak up on them and and it just messes

1090
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,359
them up they can't have fun they they're

1091
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,960
going to a movie theater with friends

1092
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,200
and they got a UTI that's a problem and

1093
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,920
they're just they're not even watching

1094
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,160
the movie because they're in agony

1095
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,800
whatever I've seen it I've seen it all

1096
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,400
including some severe cases that got

1097
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,440
really bad in people and they've lived

1098
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,680
like that and they didn't have to

1099
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,640
anymore cuz they got the answers they

1100
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,440
knew what to do so with the diets you

1101
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,440
lower your animal protein to once a day

1102
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,280
that's what I would do if you're a big

1103
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,319
animal protein person big animal Pro you

1104
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,000
lower it down to once a day keep it

1105
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,359
small portion bring in more fruits bring

1106
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,480
in more vegetables leafy greens and

1107
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:11,680
we're going to talk about some herbs and

1108
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,160
vitamins too if you're if you're plant-

1109
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,440
paste and you're vegan um or raw just

1110
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,079
lower the fats don't do the oils maybe

1111
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,000
just a few hemp seeds are fine maybe

1112
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,720
just one and a half avocados a day maybe

1113
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,240
a teaspoon of coconut oil somewhere in

1114
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,599
there on on a salad or whatever it is

1115
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,000
you can you can heat it up and put it on

1116
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,920
a salad but you know just try to do much

1117
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,240
more fruit try to do more fruit

1118
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,560
different kinds of fruits try to do

1119
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,000
other things too um if you're Raw it's

1120
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,160
going to be all raw if you're a vegan

1121
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,960
that eats cooked it's going to be some

1122
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,359
Cooks to too the vegetables and

1123
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,760
everything

1124
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:46,920
else I'm not picking

1125
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:49,160
sides I'm seeing what's really going on

1126
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,800
from what has been given to me as a gift

1127
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,280
so that people can find their way and

1128
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,160
have the answers and know what's causing

1129
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,680
problems and know how to heal them and

1130
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,119
let me tell you something okay you know

1131
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,400
Spirit told me when I was younger that

1132
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,119
that was really important it was

1133
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,440
important to have that sight but I

1134
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,880
didn't think I was the only one in the

1135
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,720
industry to have that sight and it's

1136
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,200
still to this day with with everything

1137
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,760
that I'm seeing out there day and day

1138
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,839
out and the new books coming out and the

1139
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,480
new literature and what's on the

1140
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,520
Internet it's like oh my God everybody's

1141
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,480
still blind and I want you to be able to

1142
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,920
see and know what to do for each

1143
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,079
condition and these these radio shows

1144
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,280
we're going to be doing there these are

1145
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,640
going to get really intense and we're

1146
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,200
going to do more and more of them and

1147
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,599
we're just going to be rocking the truth

1148
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,200
and putting the truth out more and more

1149
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,920
like never before

1150
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,000
for so the bottom line is this what else

1151
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,000
can we do for UTI one thing is

1152
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,640
everybody's got a zinc deficiency yes

1153
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,119
they have a zinc deficiency and the zinc

1154
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,680
attacking zinc is also been a trend oh

1155
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,000
it's going to get rid of all your copper

1156
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,240
oh you're not going to have any copper

1157
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,440
oh you can't take zinc you're going to

1158
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,240
lose all your copper first of all I

1159
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,480
can't tell you how wrong that is number

1160
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,440
one we have so much copper in our system

1161
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,800
it's the one mineral we can't get away

1162
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,520
from we have so much of it it even gets

1163
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,720
us sick there's so much copper in food

1164
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,560
I'm talking about levels of toxic copper

1165
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,280
in food not to mention good copper in

1166
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,480
food there's so much of it abound you

1167
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,760
can't even lose it if you want it to in

1168
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,839
fact you need to get rid of some because

1169
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,119
it can keep you sick and knock down your

1170
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:19,520
immune system and it hurts you copper

1171
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:22,160
actually hurts you it doesn't help you

1172
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,480
it hurts you it's an IT copper is

1173
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,839
riddled on every conventional piece of

1174
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,839
of food that exists on the Planet

1175
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:32,359
riddled in Copper never mind even

1176
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:35,240
organic food has copper in it naturally

1177
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:38,520
copper is not deficient in our soil in

1178
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,839
fact it is it is overabundance and

1179
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,240
copper is a serious problem too when you

1180
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:44,280
have too much copper your liver builds

1181
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,079
up all this copper it causes eczema

1182
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,000
psoriasis it causes all these problems

1183
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,800
with people so when people out there

1184
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,400
would you hear it from everybody oh

1185
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,640
watch the zinc oh it's going to get rid

1186
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,920
your copper another another theory that

1187
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,839
was paid for somewhere with some thumb

1188
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,520
on the scale while back and some study

1189
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,880
put out there why because if you become

1190
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,000
zinc deficient you get sick and I I

1191
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,599
believe I

1192
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,240
believe that keeping everybody sick is

1193
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,760
probably on somebody's agenda out there

1194
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,440
in the world and I have good reason to

1195
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,400
believe CU I got a source that tells me

1196
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,119
and it's

1197
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,480
spirit Spirit tells me and not just that

1198
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,240
I got other sources too and anyway the

1199
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,079
bottom line is the bottom line is copper

1200
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,800
it you know when you take zinc and you

1201
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,480
take the right kind of zinc the zinc I

1202
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,640
talk about the zinc that's on my website

1203
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,640
if you go to my website and you go to

1204
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,359
the supplemental directory I don't I

1205
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,640
it's not that I'm selling supplements I

1206
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,000
don't I try to get you there where you

1207
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,640
need to go you go to my supplement um uh

1208
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,319
directory you find the right kind of

1209
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,319
zinc you build your immune system up and

1210
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:51,160
you'll have less UTI and less UTI

1211
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:53,480
because guess what when you when you

1212
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,160
have the zinc in your system the strep

1213
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,440
is going to lower and lower and

1214
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,440
naturally lower it's not going to be

1215
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,599
able to function it's not going to be

1216
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,280
able to do what it needs to

1217
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,680
do and that's what I'm talking

1218
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,119
about guess what strep can feed off of

1219
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,760
though can feed off high amounts of

1220
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,200
copper so it's it you shouldn't be

1221
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,640
afraid of a little bit of zinc the very

1222
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,880
thing that actually helps stop strep and

1223
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,440
stop the UTI I've seen it save people

1224
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,760
from Agony actual Agony it's one it's

1225
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,359
it's deficient in the soil there's no

1226
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,760
zinc in the soil I don't care if it's

1227
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:30,000
the best organic farm there's no zinc in

1228
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,760
the soil oil there isn't zinc is gone

1229
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,960
been

1230
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,920
obliterated been obliterated because of

1231
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,359
f Fallout from World War II from the

1232
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,640
from the you know the

1233
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,000
bomb okay that's still in the air coming

1234
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,200
down every day every day it never came

1235
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,599
down it's still up there just floating

1236
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,880
around the atmosphere just floating

1237
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,800
around just floating around floating

1238
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,599
around and dropping slowly Non-Stop and

1239
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,280
what it does is that Fallout in the in

1240
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,079
the minute forms that it's dropping

1241
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,520
non-stop in all the fields and all all

1242
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,960
the even the organic fields and

1243
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,880
everything else what it does is it

1244
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,280
cancels out zinc gets in the soil and it

1245
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,040
cancels out zinc science and research

1246
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,040
doesn't realize that that Fallout is is

1247
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,880
diminishing zinc to the point of of not

1248
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,160
being in our in our in our food supply

1249
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,119
so don't be afraid of taking a little

1250
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,240
bit of zinc if you're sensitive just try

1251
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,720
to switch off maybe to a good capsule I

1252
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,760
got a I got a capsule zinc on the

1253
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,480
directory too the liquid one is the one

1254
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,559
I like the liquid ones the right

1255
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:29,359
kind so and just don't run off and get

1256
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,319
any old zinc it might be loaded with

1257
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,240
citric acid or something they put like

1258
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:34,599
two parts citric acid in some of those

1259
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,440
zinc bottles it's the worst thing I've

1260
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,480
ever seen or it might be loaded with

1261
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,200
something else or it might not be a zinc

1262
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,520
supplement it might be a zinc with 20

1263
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,319
other minerals so you're getting like

1264
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,160
this much zinc but 20 other minerals

1265
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:47,400
just try not to get confused and pick up

1266
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,319
the wrong thing CU it's not going to

1267
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,640
help but you need that for the UTI you

1268
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:53,960
need the zinc okay so that's number one

1269
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,880
number two let's do some herbs I

1270
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:59,440
Bright's a great one for UTI ibite is a

1271
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,319
great one propolis that's a great one so

1272
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,040
ibrite propolis okay lemon balb that's

1273
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,000
amazing that's a that's amazing one for

1274
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,119
maintenance you could be on that as a

1275
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,240
maintenance to actually fend off strep

1276
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:12,720
so that you don't get a UTI or any other

1277
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,119
type of thing I'm talking about so

1278
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,640
that's a great one all right I like

1279
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,400
licorice root on and off you can do that

1280
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,000
for

1281
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:24,040
UTI that does help with strep it does

1282
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,599
help and then and then um let's see what

1283
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,040
else olive leaf that's a great one to

1284
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,599
have the Elderberry I talked about

1285
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,240
before Oregon grap root Oregon grape

1286
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,760
root that's a good one for

1287
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,839
UTI couple of dropperfuls of that twice

1288
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,000
a day and dosages wise you can go look

1289
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,480
you can talk to your practitioner talk

1290
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,800
to your practitioner about dosages talk

1291
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,079
to your practitioner whatever but I mean

1292
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,480
if if it was me and I had a UTI which

1293
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:50,280
I've never had in my life but if I had

1294
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,720
one okay and and I you know and I hope I

1295
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,359
never get one and you know if I but if I

1296
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,319
did have one I'd be doing like two

1297
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:58,240
dropper FS twice a day

1298
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,920
of the orgon graef rooot I would do

1299
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,359
probably when if I had the UTI in the

1300
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,760
moment I'd probably be doing like four

1301
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,200
dropper fulls of golden seal golden seal

1302
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,079
three times a day I'd do three dropper

1303
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,000
fulls twice a day a lemon balm I would

1304
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:13,000
do you know olive leaf two dropper FS

1305
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,839
twice a day I would do one tablespoon of

1306
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,680
Elderberry three times a day yeah sure

1307
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,400
i' I'd probably take a cranberry extract

1308
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,000
why not I'll probably be eating up in my

1309
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,559
wild blueberries

1310
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,440
too vitamin C I'd be doing six eight

1311
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,720
capsules of Ester SE twice a day and if

1312
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,400
you're sensitive and you can't do these

1313
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,280
dosages of course I'm not saying to do

1314
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,599
these dosages at all this is just what I

1315
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,880
would do but if you're sensitive

1316
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:37,720
whatever you go to your practitioner you

1317
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,520
take one capsule of vitamin C you take

1318
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:44,400
five drops of of lemon bomb if you

1319
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,839
want but but I would be doing all those

1320
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,240
so so you're getting the list down I'm

1321
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,359
trying to think is there anything else

1322
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,119
in the list that'd be really good you

1323
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:52,800
got the vitamin C that's a big

1324
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:54,599
deal that's a a big one you can do monol

1325
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,800
Lauren sometimes that helps sometimes it

1326
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:57,000
doesn't but it's worth throwing in in

1327
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,079
there if you're really dealing with or

1328
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,680
suffering with UTI in a bad way you can

1329
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:07,640
definitely do that throw some monolaurin

1330
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:09,480
in there that's okay um sure absolutely

1331
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,960
nettle leaf that has a maintenance to

1332
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,520
help keep strep back nett Leaf is great

1333
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,040
that's a good one um turmeric that's a

1334
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,359
great one for UTI too it can help keep U

1335
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,880
Back turmeric is a great one ccin or

1336
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:24,640
cumin or however you want to say it

1337
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,040
that's a great one also for

1338
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:31,200
UTI so these are some of the options um

1339
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,160
I like Oregon grape root like I said and

1340
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,559
um I like the golden seal I like the

1341
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,680
olive leaf I like the lemon bomb I like

1342
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,319
the

1343
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:42,160
ibrite okay and the Elderberry you know

1344
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:44,079
bring all those in and they can really

1345
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,200
help the propolis that's a big one too

1346
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,880
like I said earlier that's a big one and

1347
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,839
you know what happens is it if you have

1348
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,559
one coming on you just Hammer everything

1349
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,200
you bring it in you bring it in and then

1350
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,480
you when when it's gone you can keep a

1351
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,799
maintenance of a little bit of zinc a

1352
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,319
maintenance a little bit of zinc maybe a

1353
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:03,480
little bit of Elderberry and some lemon

1354
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,839
balm keep maintenance as you're cleaning

1355
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,559
your Foods up making sure you're not

1356
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:07,720
eating Foods if like I said make sure

1357
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,839
you're not eating too much fat if you're

1358
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,280
on a high protein animal diet lower them

1359
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,680
bring in more fruits and

1360
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,760
vegetables okay I love it how the

1361
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,400
experts now the other experts out there

1362
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,240
whatever so-called experts I love how

1363
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,440
they pull this where they're starting to

1364
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,200
see finally for the first time ever in

1365
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,119
the history of their their practices and

1366
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,559
what they're doing they're seeing that

1367
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:28,839
people are getting better by remove

1368
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:31,079
first of all they see when you remove

1369
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,359
the dairy and the and and the gluten and

1370
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,880
they see people getting a little better

1371
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:35,680
but then they realize they're lowering

1372
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,160
the animal proteins a little bit some

1373
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,680
some belief systems are shifting and

1374
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,559
they're actually lowering the animal

1375
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,440
proteins and they're bringing in just

1376
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,160
more more more vegetables and leafy

1377
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,480
greens but they're lowering the animal

1378
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,119
proteins and and Eureka they think they

1379
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:52,079
struck gold because people are getting a

1380
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,640
little better and a little better yep

1381
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,119
you know what I was doing that 30 years

1382
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,880
ago 30 years ago

1383
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:01,000
there are people out there right now at

1384
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,559
the age 60 65 that have lived great

1385
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,599
lives because they got that information

1386
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,920
30 35 years ago from me okay you you the

1387
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,400
thing is the experts don't know it's

1388
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,599
because they're lowering the fats they

1389
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,599
don't understand it when you lower the

1390
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:16,079
fats the fats the high fat feed bacteria

1391
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,920
and viruses and they hide bacteria and

1392
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,920
viruses so what I'm saying is if you

1393
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,079
still want to be on high protein just

1394
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,960
lower the amounts if you still want to

1395
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,119
be plant-based lower the amounts of nuts

1396
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,880
and seeds lower the amounts of um of

1397
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:29,359
fats in other ways and oils and stuff

1398
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,079
like just lower bring it down bring in

1399
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,920
more fruits bringing more leafy greens

1400
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,319
bringing if look if you're if you're if

1401
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,559
you're not all raw and you're cooked

1402
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:39,359
then bring in cooked vegetables bring in

1403
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,920
potatoes and they could be really

1404
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:46,640
helpful and keep the bacteria down so it

1405
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,640
can't eat and Thrive it can't eat and

1406
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,680
Thrive so look the bottom line is it's

1407
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,799
about you getting stronger healthier

1408
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,960
about you avoiding calamity

1409
00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:01,880
it's about you know avoiding adversity

1410
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:05,160
in your life it's about just getting

1411
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:08,200
away from the bad lands and getting into

1412
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,400
the good lands and moving forward and

1413
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,680
knowing what to

1414
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,640
do so you know when it comes down to ETI

1415
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,440
and when it comes down to yeast

1416
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,240
infections too you still want to do

1417
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,559
these things you still want to do these

1418
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,400
things because the this because there's

1419
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,760
an underlying strep Factor going on with

1420
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,799
bacterial vaginosis yeah it you know

1421
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,720
that that too you want to do these

1422
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:32,240
things to get that bacteria down and you

1423
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:35,160
want to do the foods and get the foods

1424
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:38,920
better and better the the most the most

1425
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:42,359
bug feeding food there is is eggs it's

1426
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:47,280
the most bug feeding food on the planet

1427
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:50,240
it feeds every bug that isn't good is

1428
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,440
what it does it feeds every single

1429
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,119
variety of

1430
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:58,240
strep it the strep was actually raised

1431
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,920
in Labs a long time ago and somehow got

1432
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,480
out of the labs and into our bodies

1433
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:06,559
that's interesting that's

1434
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,319
interesting that that strep was raised

1435
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:12,280
and guess what it was raised on it was

1436
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:14,280
raised on egg that's what it was raised

1437
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,640
on that was his food

1438
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,640
Choice guess what's in some antibiotics

1439
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,839
egg believe it or

1440
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,119
not and there's all kinds of things in

1441
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,240
antibiotics petroleum you know engine

1442
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:27,680
oil you name it that's all that's

1443
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,960
actually all in antibiotics the

1444
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,319
petroleum the engine oil you name it

1445
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,160
it's not that you can't take an

1446
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:35,119
antibiotic in a crisis situation because

1447
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,079
you've gotten there it's about doing

1448
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,440
everything else so eventually that

1449
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:41,480
crisis situation doesn't come and hit

1450
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,200
you and goes away and you see it go by

1451
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:47,000
and you You Kiss It Goodbye you said bye

1452
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,200
and you wave It Goodbye so it's gone and

1453
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,040
gone for

1454
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,440
good and that's what you want to do

1455
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,119
that's what you want to do and if you're

1456
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,559
worried about getting a UTI someday and

1457
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,920
you've never had one and you might have

1458
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,760
something else cooking like a little bit

1459
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,240
of sibo you think your doctor thinks or

1460
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,000
believes or you got something else going

1461
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,640
on like a little bit of gastritis

1462
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,400
because gastritis is also something

1463
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,240
that's caused by strep some of the it's

1464
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,720
chronic gastritis and bloating

1465
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:15,640
constipation bloating gastritis all that

1466
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,520
has strep behind it if you think that's

1467
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,000
what's going on let's start going

1468
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:23,720
anti-strep and start knocking this stuff

1469
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,480
down and we can do it simply if this is

1470
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,880
too overwhelming and I've given you too

1471
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,200
much you start small and you start with

1472
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,599
the good stuff you take away one thing

1473
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,240
you take away the dairy you take away

1474
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,920
the eggs you you take away the gluten of

1475
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,640
course you take away you know you lower

1476
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,559
your you lower your intake your fat

1477
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,000
intake whatever side of whatever side of

1478
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,280
the world you're on in the food belief

1479
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
system Wars whatever side you're in

1480
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,440
you're stuck in or you want to be in or

1481
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,520
you feel good in whichever one some

1482
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,960
people they don't feel good in it

1483
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,319
they're just stuck in it some people

1484
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,520
feel amazing in there now I talk to

1485
00:53:53,319 --> 00:53:56,200
plant-based people and they're like I've

1486
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,480
never felt better in my entire life I've

1487
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,359
been sick for 30 years I went

1488
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,720
plant-based I can't believe it I've

1489
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,880
gotten everything better it's the

1490
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,280
greatest thing in the world so they

1491
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,720
don't feel stuck in it and then you got

1492
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,200
people that are in some other belief

1493
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,720
system or they're in a belief system and

1494
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,920
they're they're not feeling good they

1495
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,040
did feel good for a little while and

1496
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,359
they're not feeling good anymore and

1497
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,559
they're stuck in it because they can't

1498
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:19,720
get out of it whatever it is just lower

1499
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,440
the fat intake so that the strep can't

1500
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:24,520
feed off of that hide or pilate

1501
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,599
underneath perate I can't say the word

1502
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:31,200
now can't you know

1503
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:33,960
grow underneath underneath those

1504
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,760
layers underneath that fat that gets

1505
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,359
Caked Up in the intestinal tract in the

1506
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,720
walls and turns rancid and putrid it

1507
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:43,960
gets inside the bladder we urinate fat

1508
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:46,960
out of our body we urinate fat out of

1509
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,200
our body we actually do and what happens

1510
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,839
is it builds up in the bladder lining

1511
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,160
and it Shields strap all the time

1512
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:55,760
something to think about okay just one
