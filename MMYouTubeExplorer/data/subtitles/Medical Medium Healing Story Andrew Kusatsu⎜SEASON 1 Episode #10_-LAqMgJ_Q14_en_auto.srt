00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,840
of healing story inspirational some

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,100
people are suffering from skin problems

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,960
too dear friend of mine we're sitting

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,689
here and hey it's great to have you here

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,000
really nice though it's really and so

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,320
the whole thing that I've always seen

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,690
out there with all these years of

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,600
decades is is that when people are

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,340
suffering from skin conditions and

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,500
whether it's eczema the psoriasis or

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,719
another skin condition that they get a

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,430
diagnosis of or don't get a diagnosis

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,250
whether it's a dermatitis or even a

22
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,020
vitiligo or anything and like its

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,489
grossest whatever it may be skin

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,770
relieved it it's one of the hardest

25
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,170
struggles that we have for so many

26
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,579
reasons because we can I mean there's so

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,010
many people they can't even put clothes

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,660
on it hurts so bad and the rashes can be

29
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,840
so difficult they can crack and they

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,280
bleed and and what I've always seen all

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,770
these years going back since I was

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,130
younger is people who probably they

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,920
can't get answers and it hasn't changed

34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,100
you know 40 years ago when I was a

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,299
little kid and people would actually ask

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,460
you know they would say well does he

37
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,380
have answers for eczema psoriasis and I

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,970
would say well yeah Semler juice is part

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,270
of it and there's other parts of it too

40
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,720
but what would happen is you would think

41
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,549
40 years leader signs of research would

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,220
have solved it and that's what everybody

43
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,250
believes they believe that science

44
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,450
research has an answer in ten years for

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,430
everything what are we going to be in

46
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,630
five years do you ever feel that like

47
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,420
you don't I mean with other things like

48
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,920
it's like where are we gonna be and and

49
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:55,229
for some reason for some reason it's

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,579
it's unbelievable how it works I'm gonna

51
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:03,259
actually do some point you have a

52
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,259
feeling yeah mother Laurie lens

53
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:16,540
hey we're live totally unscripted so um

54
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,569
but you know hey everybody's looking for

55
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,540
answers they still are and and we get

56
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:24,849
comfortable thinking hey you know if I

57
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,459
ever do get something happened to me if

58
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,540
I ever do get some type of interruption

59
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,830
in my life where I'm dealing with

60
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,260
something because that's what it always

61
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,849
feels like it's like okay well now I got

62
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,230
a skin problem and now I have to go see

63
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,730
a doctor now let's go see another doctor

64
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:41,319
now you know and and deal with in the

65
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,540
discomfort of it all we always think

66
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,579
that if I was if I was to ever have

67
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,690
something science and research surely

68
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,980
would have the answers by then the

69
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,329
doctor must have an answer at the

70
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,519
doctor's office but what happens to

71
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:53,620
people with excellent psoriasis they

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,170
don't they end up bumping into walls

73
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:01,299
with this you had like some serious

74
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:06,519
stuff going on with it it's pretty so

75
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:09,959
like for us this was spring 2015 I had a

76
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,790
little looked like a spider bite or a

77
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,519
mosquito bite yeah that's persisting on

78
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:18,670
my calf and weeks were going by which

79
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,709
turned into months and then it started

80
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,870
it wasn't going away and I was getting a

81
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,660
little worried and then it started

82
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,639
getting a little like fussy like red

83
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,819
spots around it and that freaked me out

84
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,099
so I went to my primary physician look

85
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:36,549
at a bunch of ten tests biopsies blood

86
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:38,200
work everything came back inconclusive I

87
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,540
wasn't allergic to anything the biopsies

88
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:45,190
came back negative so she sent me to a

89
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:48,190
dermatologist and went to the

90
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,910
dermatologist he without testing right

91
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:55,840
with this his eyeball test said it's

92
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:59,230
ringworm and that freaked me out gave me

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,450
a bunch of antibiotics with two went

94
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,840
home got two antibiotics within a

95
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:08,799
12-hour window my whole block body blew

96
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,680
up yeah in in spots and I freaked out

97
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,390
called him told me to get off it I went

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,530
back into his office that same day the

99
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:19,380
following day

100
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:22,810
initially of seeing him put me on more

101
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:27,570
antibiotics and then that kind of set in

102
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:30,600
motion this four and a half year journey

103
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,210
that I've included seeing three

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,380
dermatologists one in Encino and in

105
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:40,510
Westlake one in Beverly Hills

106
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:43,090
I saw one dermatologist in Tokyo I saw

107
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,070
two allergists I saw a pathologists I

108
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:51,250
saw two acupuncturists my primary

109
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:56,590
physician and they basically all told me

110
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:58,090
that there was no cure that my body was

111
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,360
attacking himself it was some type of

112
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,880
blanket autoimmune situation happening

113
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,130
well that's a thing so you've heard that

114
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,560
your body's attacking itself hmm I mean

115
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,410
definitely from pretty much from all of

116
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,330
all the doctors I hope they said yeah

117
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,460
and that the only treatment for it was

118
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,840
steroids

119
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,580
one one of the doctors went so far as to

120
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,680
say I might like to wear loose clothes

121
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,050
that it might be the materials in my

122
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,620
clothes that to stay away from extreme

123
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,500
hot and cold weather situations humidity

124
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,030
you know not humidity you know dry here

125
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,890
too you know that's something you

126
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,050
probably always throw you know I noticed

127
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,680
none of it made sense it was it was it

128
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:42,280
was a very I was kind of thrust into

129
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,930
this vicious cycle of just confusion it

130
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,880
created more questions and answers and

131
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,710
that kind of set me on this path of I

132
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,510
was sick of using the steroids but I was

133
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,380
still using it to levy eight the

134
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,640
discomfort and pain of it and that kind

135
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,530
of sent me on this path of trying to

136
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,750
figure out some alternative methods so

137
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,550
that was I tried doing a gluten-free

138
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,919
diet but I didn't really know why to go

139
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,130
gluten-free because I Paul my allergy

140
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,770
panels came out negative to it so I did

141
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,450
that for six months I went sober for two

142
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,070
separate six months things thinking

143
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:19,090
maybe alcohol was playing a role in the

144
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:24,010
operations on my immune system I did a

145
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,000
blood type diet ultimately none of those

146
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,000
things were working with

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,410
I wasn't it wasn't attacking with the

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,710
root cause with because no one knew what

149
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:40,330
it was so fast forward from spring 2015

150
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:41,980
to this past fall of 2018 I got some

151
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:46,360
more flare ups they were persisting I

152
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:51,280
was using the steroid cream wasn't going

153
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:55,750
away January of this year I went to

154
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:59,100
Paris for work and the flare-ups got a

155
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:03,010
little worse they started intensifying a

156
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:06,520
few weeks prior to leaving overseas my

157
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:09,850
friend Karina had put me on to your

158
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:13,840
information and I bought the liver

159
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,600
rescue book brought it to Paris with me

160
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,460
hoping I could kind of read it during my

161
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,370
travels but I was too busy with work but

162
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,950
on the on the trip home at 11 hours to

163
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,810
kill so I figured I'd break into the

164
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,180
book you can crack the book with 11

165
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,440
hours my whole thing was I'm gonna read

166
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:35,740
a couple of them I'm gonna read a couple

167
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:41,110
chapters and pass out and was I read the

168
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:43,630
entire book I was up for 11 hours was

169
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:50,700
moved to tears you're fast reader it's a

170
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:50,700
big book with like jaundice and pandas

171
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:58,330
so it was like the introduction wrapped

172
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,130
me in yeah the high cholesterol

173
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,810
situation is something I've been dealing

174
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,580
with up in dealing with strap which

175
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,530
isn't particularly mentioning in

176
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,580
chapters but there's the supplement

177
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,680
regimen you to help with strap and then

178
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,540
the eczema obviously so I was able to

179
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,820
kind of fast-forward through a lot of

180
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,479
pages in the middle of the book because

181
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,770
it didn't apply to me and so that's how

182
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,750
I was able to kind of work through it

183
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,290
but I had my phone next to me the book I

184
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:29,950
was taking notes I was in sensing pages

185
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:33,280
it triggered me it make sense it made

186
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:36,550
all the sense in the world it was I had

187
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,530
never gotten an explanation what was

188
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,250
happening internal

189
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:44,850
yeah it was only it's autoimmune your

190
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,980
body's not explained how he's attacking

191
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,690
it was the three of your pillars of what

192
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,840
they were your body is attacking the

193
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,060
skin that's what you get out there and

194
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,620
the problem is with that even with the

195
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,540
best functional medicine doctors the

196
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,360
best alternative doctors conventional

197
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,890
doctors they still go with even if they

198
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,980
believe in a different modality of

199
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,830
healing mm-hmm okay they still believe

200
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,330
in the old grandfathered law that was

201
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,710
wrong to begin with that your body's

202
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,420
attacking itself that it's autoimmune

203
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,000
that your body is actually attacking the

204
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,670
skin that was a massive mistake in 1950

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,140
and it wasn't even proven there was no

206
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,510
science research proving it it was to

207
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,180
protect science it was to protect

208
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,590
literally science not the person because

209
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,260
they put the blame on you so you go to

210
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,650
the doctor you got you got a condition

211
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,240
you need help for help from and it's not

212
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,160
the doctors fault he doesn't know but

213
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,950
what happens is that you leave what's

214
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,530
just the answer is your body's attacking

215
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,060
its own and then in top of being in pain

216
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,070
that doesn't help because you're

217
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,450
wondering why is my body doing that you

218
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,430
know I mean that's what happens

219
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,250
well the inflammation thing kind of

220
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,800
triggered me I was taking Dragon's Blood

221
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,820
which sounds nefarious but it's a tree

222
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,860
sap yeah Amazon yeah we always look for

223
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,630
something in the Amazon we always look

224
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,130
for the new thing we always look for

225
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,020
something that's out there that's what

226
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,570
usually happened and we get told hey

227
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,180
someone says this let's try this let's

228
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:13,940
try that thank you awesome no no no it's

229
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:16,200
this is incredible I was doing neem oil

230
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,700
yeah that's one that's always play

231
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,250
that's getting thrown around out there

232
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,400
these are the trendy things that are

233
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,320
backed by some money and agenda the

234
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,060
trends that get thrown into the system

235
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,940
John I've seen trying this world and

236
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,390
you're trying that away and exactly but

237
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,180
it was all topical so what really kind

238
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,540
of resonated with me when I cracked in

239
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,890
the liver rescue and also I'd listen to

240
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,280
Anthony's to podcast episodes there's

241
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:46,270
one in 2016 I think another 2018 on

242
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,010
eczema psoriasis acne

243
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,690
and those are extremely well informative

244
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,500
but that was the whole point

245
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,150
everything was this topical thing and

246
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,670
the podcast and in the liver recipe

247
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,740
chapter on eggs I'm going to attack the

248
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,720
internal root of what's happening and

249
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,930
that's kind of exactly what I was

250
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,640
searching for when all this confusion

251
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,510
was getting stoked by the doctors that I

252
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:13,730
was I was seeing so when I finally had

253
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:18,620
gotten these answers reading this on the

254
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:20,330
plane it completely changed everything

255
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,060
for me in my life it changed the

256
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:26,030
trajectory in my life I ended up a week

257
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,070
later getting home I went to Japan for

258
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,750
two weeks so I couldn't institute the

259
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,460
protocols right away but I ended up

260
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:36,140
bringing some dulse with me and some

261
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,970
spirulina barley grass powder - do you

262
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,230
have your do you have some of this stuff

263
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,480
cause it's so you brought a bag I

264
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,450
brought of it okay I'm also paranoid

265
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:59,000
about leaving like my laptop in my car

266
00:11:43,450 --> 00:12:02,710
but yeah every morning I this is some

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,710
tumor you're better at this than I am

268
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,970
stack them up there that's that's

269
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,590
unbelievable so it's like you prepare

270
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,680
that in the morning I prepare this in

271
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,850
the morning so my morning routine

272
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,720
[Music]

273
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,040
essentially I've been starting to do

274
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,330
some breathing exercises in the morning

275
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:24,200
for the past couple like six weeks I do

276
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:26,180
a cold shower and then I drink 40 ounces

277
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,120
of lemon water after the shower nice

278
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,890
nice and prettier direction waiting 30

279
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,140
minutes after you drink the lemon water

280
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,820
that have anything else

281
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,610
it's the perfect 30 minute window to

282
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,530
make all these and once these are all

283
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,020
made after that 30 minute give or take

284
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,430
window I make 20 ounces of celery juice

285
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,370
yeah

286
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:51,610
clean up the juicer do the dishes got my

287
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:57,080
stuff up and head out but all of these

288
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:58,910
are basically being a vessel for me to

289
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,690
take in as much fruit and

290
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,400
vegetables without I don't want to say

291
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:08,720
the burning but I could never eat this

292
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:13,190
much yeah vegetables in leafy greens and

293
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,130
fruits this is a know you're busy too

294
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,670
for sure you know I mean you're really

295
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:22,640
on the run you're working you're doing a

296
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,060
lot so having this blended up in

297
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,130
tinnitus this design is incredible and

298
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,980
and really helpful for I mean and maybe

299
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,200
other people try it to this way if you

300
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,000
can't do it this way you just try to you

301
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,560
get the book you learn you learn the

302
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,390
food see you try to get the heavy-metal

303
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:46,040
detox movie in you I have oh yeah I mean

304
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,650
this is this is incredible right here

305
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,200
when I see this I get blown away and and

306
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,900
I can't even tell you because he's

307
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,130
actually doing everything to the letter

308
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:02,630
and I mean what were you with your

309
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:05,030
condition to how to how bad it was where

310
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:07,790
I mean how uncomfortable it was to where

311
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,010
you are now these days I mean we're in

312
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,530
the past when it was at its height and

313
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,180
state what was it like because it'll

314
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,370
help people with Pima they're also

315
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,320
dealing with that now does they feel

316
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,850
they feel like they're alone and they

317
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,860
feel like they're the only ones going

318
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,510
through it and that there's no hope and

319
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,650
I know so many people and so many of you

320
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,020
guys have so many different skin

321
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,670
conditions and it gets so bad where you

322
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,780
can't even put clothes on and you're

323
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,910
just an agony and everything else and

324
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,580
you know and so by knowing that you went

325
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,610
through this you had that skin condition

326
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,080
to that degree and I maybe it just tell

327
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,910
me what kind of where were you at when

328
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,250
it was really at its all-time work

329
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:49,310
there's an all-time worst was actually

330
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:51,380
when I was detoxing prior to that it was

331
00:14:49,310 --> 00:15:00,140
bad I mean it was blowing up all over my

332
00:14:51,380 --> 00:15:02,270
body my legs my back arms but to the to

333
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:06,650
the weight of how of the worst it ever

334
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:08,510
got when I actually started detoxing and

335
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,260
I'm getting it out of you attacking the

336
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,990
pathogen

337
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,520
metals and having the state of the

338
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,900
topical steroid withdrawal all those

339
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:20,210
things compounded to make the flare-ups

340
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:23,060
that much worse and crazy I mean it was

341
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:26,330
literally all over my torso my back

342
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,710
shoulders arms legs and I want to talk

343
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,360
about that for a second to why that

344
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,760
happens because I don't even think I got

345
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,370
a chance to tell you about that is is as

346
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,930
there's a pathogen called epstein-barr

347
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,330
okay there's over 60 varieties of

348
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,010
Epstein Barr everybody has Epstein Barr

349
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,270
that's why you want to learn how to take

350
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,270
care of yourself because you can have an

351
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,530
Epstein bar that creates an eczema

352
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,300
psoriasis condition you can have an

353
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,400
eczema you can have an Epstein bar that

354
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,510
creates a bit of LIGO situation you can

355
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,310
have one that creates chronic fatigue

356
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,500
syndrome one that creates Hashimoto's

357
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,720
it's the reason why because there's over

358
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,760
60 varieties of mutations of Epstein

359
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,170
Barr we all have them in us that's what

360
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,210
we have to take care of ourselves it's

361
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,520
no joke that's why you need to know what

362
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,140
the truth is so you don't end up 10

363
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,880
years from now or 20 years from now with

364
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,590
a diagnosis and a doctor telling you you

365
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,660
have autoimmune and then you think it's

366
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,280
genes or your body attacking itself and

367
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,810
then nobody has answers and you're

368
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,730
looking for neem oil and then all of a

369
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,380
sudden you're looking for something else

370
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,230
and next thing because that's what

371
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:24,470
everybody does and and so the bottom

372
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,230
line is is that what's what's happening

373
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,350
here is that the liver gets built up

374
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,630
with all this toxic matter that toxic

375
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,940
matter is created from epstein-barr

376
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,250
feeding off of copper when it's eczema

377
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,560
psoriasis so when it's eczema or

378
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,900
psoriasis those two conditions that you

379
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,300
could get diagnosed with that's the

380
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,370
pathogen epstein-barr the variety of

381
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,960
epstein-barr there's over 60 varieties

382
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,610
when someone says wow he thinks that

383
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,800
I've seen bars everything no there's

384
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,050
over 60 varieties of epstein-barr

385
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,880
unknown to research in science the

386
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,870
really important a really key thing to

387
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:02,210
know and and so one of those bugs that

388
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,940
we all have everybody's got these bugs

389
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,650
in them bottom line it's not like andrew

390
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,380
has this bug oh wait a minute no

391
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,940
everybody's got it so I need you to know

392
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,920
so you can protect yourself so you can

393
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,260
actually make sure that you don't get in

394
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,699
trouble or anything and you heal so what

395
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:20,060
that virus does it the feeds off of

396
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:21,920
copper and he has high copper so where

397
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,740
did the copper come from

398
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,819
and that's the thing that I was kind of

399
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,620
perplexed on yeah

400
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,530
tell everybody about that whole thing I

401
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,660
was like where's the copper coming from

402
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,330
if Anthony's family thinks he's got

403
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,980
copper and the book says well you got

404
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,799
eczema psoriasis where'd the copper come

405
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,559
I mean I just honestly had chopped it up

406
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:44,090
to it being part of my diet with

407
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,520
whatever the herbicides pesticides

408
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:50,330
fungicides if it was there's copper

409
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,640
let's eat foods that I was eating in the

410
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,380
water so shower there's a lot of copper

411
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,780
and fungicides pesticides herbicides

412
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,760
rodenticides all that stuff we get in us

413
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,890
all the time if the neighbor spraying

414
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,809
something that's that's copper getting

415
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,160
in it and someone spraying something if

416
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:05,510
you live in a condo if you live in

417
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,150
apartment building and they're spraying

418
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,350
things pesticides whatever it is or the

419
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,510
highway you're driving down the highway

420
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,040
and your windows open and they're

421
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,600
spraying the sides of the highway you

422
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,100
just get the copper in you so you're

423
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,410
chalking it up to maybe some of them

424
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:22,059
that's what I had assumed it was after I

425
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:25,790
had kind of gone through what my second

426
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:28,370
369 liver cleanse I was kind of just

427
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,080
thinking and it kind of dawned on me at

428
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,770
my old house that I lived in for about

429
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,059
eight years

430
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:37,790
I had a copper sink the copper saying

431
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:39,950
literally a copper sink and this is

432
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,380
before the eczema this was before the

433
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,720
exec Simone exactly so I had lived in

434
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,740
this house starting in 2000 summer of

435
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:52,130
2010 so summer 2010 fast forward to

436
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:55,490
spring 2015 is when I got this little

437
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,950
bump which ended up becoming what the

438
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:02,030
eczema brake was so that's about a five

439
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:04,669
year window of me living in this house

440
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,530
that had I don't know if it's that

441
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:10,610
specifically but it makes a lot of sense

442
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:14,030
of getting exposed to that much it does

443
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:16,460
a toxic copper sink yeah because a

444
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,200
copper sink is oxidizing is what's

445
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,990
happening so that copper sink is

446
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,470
constantly oxidizing even the fumes from

447
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,520
that copper sink mmm the fumes alone

448
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,620
inhaling it getting into the bloodstream

449
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,910
then going up into the liver that could

450
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,530
be a problem that you may not have a

451
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,850
copper sink don't get that confused

452
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:36,190
because coppers everywhere it's in every

453
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,870
we're high in copper all of us and if

454
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,730
you have a variety of epstein-barr that

455
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,800
feeds off of copper you're gonna end up

456
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,870
with eczema and a lot of people with

457
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,130
women and men are ended young that women

458
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,750
and men are ending up with their first

459
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,490
sex bun the first thing that happens at

460
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,260
the doctor's office because here's

461
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,390
science and research the first thing

462
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,400
that happens is it's ringworm that's

463
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,650
that all the time I've heard this really

464
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,090
hurt deck decades as well I did here at

465
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,130
the dermatologist they think it's

466
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,630
ringworm you're out the doctor and the

467
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,550
interest he thinks it's ringworm right

468
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,130
at the beginning when it's really really

469
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:08,230
on how many look like it I mean I have

470
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,020
the pictures it was literally a ring of

471
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,660
spots yeah because it exactly because

472
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,880
and and so because it's so confusing

473
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,240
eczema when it starts or what it becomes

474
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,890
it can easily come a process we'll wait

475
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,140
a minute maybe it's a brain worm maybe

476
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,240
this is something else maybe this is

477
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,940
scabies maybe this is some dermatitis

478
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,580
maybe this is you know and that's what

479
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,530
happens and the family you can have

480
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,530
answer so for dermatitis and other stuff

481
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,120
anyway but the causes of course but you

482
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,970
know or some of these other things but

483
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,040
it's usually that that start up where

484
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,200
you get the diagnosis of that you know

485
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,960
ringworm could be this or it could be

486
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,790
Lyme did you get bit by a tick did you

487
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,850
get bit by a spider these are the places

488
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,650
they go and I get it because they just

489
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,200
don't understand the x-men's rises so

490
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,760
much but the copper the copper sink yeah

491
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,370
that's that's a great way of getting

492
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,340
toxic copper in us but copper pans

493
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,530
copper pots I've seen it all around if

494
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,510
you go to a restaurant and you don't

495
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:11,260
know but they have an old copper pot in

496
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,880
the back and you know and then they made

497
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,610
something in this copper pot in this

498
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,810
restaurant that you just got infused

499
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,820
with a whole bunch of copper and they're

500
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,950
scraping the bottom of that pot and it

501
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,260
went in the restaurant and that's how it

502
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,720
works you just the water supply

503
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,390
literally the talents the city water

504
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,850
supplies load it with copper a lot of

505
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,920
times elevated way too much copper than

506
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,480
it should and then we end up drinking it

507
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,920
we end up getting it in the restaurants

508
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,200
we get it and we get it in all kinds of

509
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,270
different places so we need to know

510
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,160
we're not it's all of us are high in

511
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,950
copper we deal with it it's a toxic

512
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,520
heavy metal you know it's why I drink

513
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,050
the heavy metal detox movies so

514
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,300
you said to me like you don't need to do

515
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,970
these things you Anthony you got

516
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,679
everything out of you whatever no that's

517
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,990
not true if I gotta eat in a restaurant

518
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,300
if I got to do something I'm like okay

519
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:04,460
when's my next copper load gonna happen

520
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:06,590
and but the bottom line is is that you

521
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,059
have to have that that bug like the

522
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,950
epstein-barr and you have to have the

523
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,020
metal copper in order to create eczema

524
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,570
psoriasis and this is lightyears ahead

525
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,150
of science and research light-years

526
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,730
ahead because they want it they want it

527
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:22,250
to be your body is attacking itself

528
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:24,890
because it disempowers people especially

529
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,679
women it disempowers be blend men you

530
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,720
know it disempowers you I mean and in

531
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,720
and there's a reason for this because

532
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,570
science research is there not the blame

533
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,809
squeaky clean squeaky clean that's how

534
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,940
it works and and that's the problem they

535
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:44,210
should just come out and be honest and

536
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,640
just be like we don't know so let's be

537
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,800
open to things that are working let's be

538
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,870
open to things that are working because

539
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,390
lives are critical they're important and

540
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:56,030
when you suffer and you struggle I've

541
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,429
seen babies with head-to-toe of eczema I

542
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,920
mean can you imagine a child head-to-toe

543
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:02,750
about what you had absolutely not born

544
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:13,030
with it dealing with at a young age

545
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:15,650
because you actually not know for sure

546
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,450
but I think back to the kind of yeah

547
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,470
empowerment thing I mean I think that's

548
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,640
that is kind of the main thing that

549
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:26,140
Anthony's information and reading his

550
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:30,140
books was podcasts following his

551
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:34,070
suggestions and his protocols has really

552
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:37,990
anchored me in a sense of getting that

553
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:43,160
empowerment back and taking control of

554
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:45,710
my health of sorts it's translated even

555
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,530
into some dealings with strep I used to

556
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:53,450
get strep throat pretty consistently in

557
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:54,890
my 20s then it went away I was every

558
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,180
time I would just go to the doctor get

559
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,790
amoxicillin

560
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,950
whatever the other antibiotic was would

561
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:06,200
do the full regiment the five seven or

562
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:09,510
ten days I forget and it would be gone

563
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,330
then about a year and a half ago this

564
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:14,700
was around summer fall of 2018

565
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:17,940
I got strep again for the first time in

566
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,100
years that have been a really long time

567
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,100
seven eight some odd years since I've

568
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,850
gotten a case of strep throat same

569
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:32,220
routine went down to the urgent care got

570
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:36,360
amoxicillin and within a few days or

571
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:39,180
within that week it's gone then fast

572
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:45,960
forward to this past April I got it

573
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:49,440
again and this time around I had

574
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:53,280
listened to Anthony's podcast episode on

575
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,900
streptococcus so I decided I made a

576
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,720
conscious decision to try to institute

577
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:02,190
some of his suggestions in there and

578
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:04,770
treating the strep throat and if it

579
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,450
wasn't gonna work I had prefaced that by

580
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:09,090
calling my doctor and scheduling a

581
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,130
meeting you'll get antibiotics the the

582
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:15,800
following three days so it was about a

583
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,800
Wednesday night I was feeling sick and

584
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:21,120
didn't really know what's going on then

585
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,980
that following Thursday

586
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,220
I started getting spots on my throat and

587
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,960
I knew immediately what it was so I

588
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,940
called the doctor told him I was gonna

589
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,760
come in on Monday so I was gonna be out

590
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:36,000
of town to schedule an appointment to

591
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,340
get on the antibiotics so but between

592
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,700
that thursday in that monday i had

593
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:47,790
loaded up on garlic thyme aromatic herbs

594
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:50,970
oregano sage honey garlic ginger i was

595
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:53,340
doing all my juices here i was taking a

596
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,010
lot of the supplements that he suggested

597
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,560
that crossover between the supplements

598
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,270
that he suggests for strep or have a lot

599
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,890
of crossover with the supplements he

600
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,120
suggested for eczema the reason why

601
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,340
because the reason why is because

602
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,380
epstein-barr and strep go hand-in-hand

603
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,150
the reason why you had this

604
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,890
was because you had this epstein-barr

605
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,410
since childhood because everybody has

606
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:16,930
strep and epstein-barr they work.they

607
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,030
the strep piggybacks on the epstein-barr

608
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,830
that's what it does they work off of

609
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,720
each other and and they live together

610
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,630
and there's a reason for this because

611
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,520
the distrib tends to break down the

612
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,380
immune system so the epstein-barr can

613
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,540
cause more trouble that's they work off

614
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,490
of each other so what you are doing now

615
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,080
you were you're knocking down the

616
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,060
epstein-barr through information and

617
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,250
liver rescue book you're cleaning up

618
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,470
your copper and then the strep was like

619
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,720
you're not now it's my turn basically

620
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:46,300
you were it was like wait a minute rest

621
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,400
the party's over and it was it was

622
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,720
looking for a fight and that's what

623
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,180
happened now it was time to actually

624
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,620
start kicking kicking it a lot is what

625
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,790
you were gonna do you've had it in your

626
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,890
system all these years you've been

627
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:59,020
getting bouts of it and now you're like

628
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,510
okay let me go after it we also said in

629
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,940
the podcast episode the antibiotics

630
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,590
actually strengthen dis Rankine it so in

631
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,410
this Franklin every time you take an

632
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,900
antibiotic it strengthens both the virus

633
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:14,020
in the bacteria streptococcus is the

634
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,820
bacteria the viruses epstein-barr those

635
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,580
both get strengthened from it from

636
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,050
antibiotics it's why the eczema blew up

637
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,660
remember when it was starting you only

638
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:25,720
they need to be anyway and then it just

639
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,270
blew it exploded right because it first

640
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,130
of all that antibiotic feeds both those

641
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,420
things that feeds the strep in the

642
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,850
epstein-barr but especially the

643
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,880
epstein-barr antibiotics have copper in

644
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,640
them antibiotics have metals in them

645
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,500
that's another thing too I'm not against

646
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,140
totally against antibiotics for certain

647
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,450
things but when it's used for the wrong

648
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,100
thing it can make things worse right

649
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,650
that's why the phone issue is that I was

650
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,410
doing with yeah these particular so it

651
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,879
took me three days so Thursday Friday

652
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:58,759
Saturday of doing a heavy regiment

653
00:27:55,879 --> 00:28:00,259
the aromatic herbs of the garlic of my

654
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,149
juices I was eating a lot of bananas

655
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:05,539
which you suggested a lot of words

656
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:09,440
outside of the juices I woke up Monday

657
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:12,249
morning to go to my ten o'clock doctor's

658
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,169
appointment and I looked in the mirror

659
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:17,719
getting ready and the spots were gone in

660
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:21,469
this without any without any antibiotics

661
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:27,289
all using aromatic herbs juices fruit

662
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:31,309
and zinc selenium metal mall in all the

663
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:32,989
various supplements listed on what did

664
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,589
it feel like to take control over you're

665
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:36,199
helpless

666
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:37,999
you got your drive in the machine you're

667
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:41,239
driving it now you're driving your car

668
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:43,519
you're you took control you know content

669
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:46,549
the full context of it so that was in

670
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:50,419
April of this year I'm jumping around

671
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:54,259
here but I had attacked the eczema three

672
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:56,839
months prior so in January when I read

673
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:59,899
the book was in overseas read the book

674
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:02,299
came back then I went to Japan we might

675
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:06,019
a last-ditch effort at used doing a

676
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:09,259
conventional path and saw a doctor in

677
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:12,379
Tokyo she said the same thing loaded me

678
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:17,449
up with steroids but for the sake of

679
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:19,489
having a livable trip I was using the

680
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:21,019
steroids so then when I got back I

681
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:23,359
actually bought a juicer in Tokyo as

682
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:26,389
well I was doing celery juice every

683
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,229
morning so when I've gotten back in

684
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:30,339
mid-february

685
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:35,809
I started my first three six nine I

686
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:38,479
lowered my radical fat intake I bought

687
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:42,109
some of the supplements I did the lemon

688
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:46,489
water and the celery juice and the first

689
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:49,399
three six nine I did I didn't notice a

690
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:51,169
huge change I thought I was gonna be

691
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:55,069
leaps and bounds like detoxing like

692
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:58,009
crazy but what ended up happening was

693
00:29:55,069 --> 00:30:00,829
was it was getting worse I was the spots

694
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:03,379
were getting worse and I listened to his

695
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:06,859
podcast about signs of signs and

696
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:08,130
symptoms of detox and it just made all

697
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:10,110
the sense in the world that my body

698
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,940
actually healing itself by pushing this

699
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,670
stuff out yeah this is how it this is

700
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:17,330
how it happens and and actually cut

701
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:22,010
myself off earlier so so going into that

702
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:22,010
nothing you know a lot of moving parts

703
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,150
it's the only way to do it you gotta be

704
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,260
dealing you gotta be you gotta be you

705
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,120
just got to be real and make sure

706
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,120
everybody we get to help them eat the

707
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,670
bottle yeah the bottom line is when the

708
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,650
liver gets built up with with the

709
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:39,450
pathogen yeah that's where I was earlier

710
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,090
it was the pathogen epstein-barr and the

711
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:44,430
copper when the pathogen I've seen bars

712
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:48,270
feeding off of copper inside the liver

713
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:51,210
it's releasing a derma talkin inside the

714
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:54,240
liver before you get eczema before you

715
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:57,480
get your first signs of sickness or for

716
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,040
this condition and so your liver starts

717
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,870
getting built up with more and more

718
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,210
Dermott oxygen your livers trying to

719
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:05,220
protect you so it holds on to it it's

720
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,320
keeping it there it's putting it in

721
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,680
storage bins it's putting it in pockets

722
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,210
is what it's doing and as it keeps on

723
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,610
building up and keeps on building up the

724
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:16,320
liver finally says okay I can't handle

725
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,030
this anymore what happens is people are

726
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,670
these on hunt on these high-fat diets

727
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,830
they think they have the Holy Grail when

728
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:25,020
they're on the high fat keto high-fat

729
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,880
you know whether it's whether it's

730
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,020
plant-based or not playing a bass and

731
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,150
they're doing these really high fat

732
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,650
diets what they don't realize they're

733
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,120
beating down their livers so if they

734
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,590
have the epstein-barr inside the liver

735
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,030
and they're doing all these high fats

736
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,260
and they think that's the answer because

737
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,550
they took away processed foods and they

738
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,010
took away clue and then they took away

739
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:43,110
or whatever and which is all helpful but

740
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,850
there's still really high fat diet

741
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,200
they'll end up and they're doing the

742
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,570
bone broth and all these things and it's

743
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,340
all high fat they'll end up with a

744
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,810
problem where they're weakening the

745
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,510
liver waking the liver and the liver

746
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:57,180
can't hold on to that

747
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,160
Dermott oxidant protect you anymore and

748
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,330
it can't fight the epstein-barr anymore

749
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,060
because the liver has its own immune

750
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:06,630
system so we all beat our livers down so

751
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:09,150
so our liver gets congested stagnant

752
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,800
sluggish but filled with that Dermott

753
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,620
oxen it's the epstein-barr

754
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,420
feeding off of copper and then releasing

755
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,370
a Dermott on st. so what does that mean

756
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,820
the epstein-barr is going to bathroom it

757
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,920
goes the bathroom in our box

758
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,420
that's how it works when you have lupus

759
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,480
it's going to bathroom releasing

760
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:27,010
chemical toxins for neurotoxins for

761
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,800
lupus when you have excellent psoriasis

762
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:31,840
it goes about the releases copper toxins

763
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,180
Dermot oxen so when it's vitiligo it

764
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,860
releases aluminum toxins but I'll maybe

765
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,930
I'll talk about that a little later so

766
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,020
here's the deal when you're detoxing

767
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:42,460
when you're cleansing this so you start

768
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:45,340
doing something about it

769
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,290
your liver is filled with this stuff

770
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,150
it's filled with it and before anybody

771
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,610
cleanses or does anything about it

772
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:53,410
little bits of it you guys little bits

773
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,240
of it are leaking out of the liver

774
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,980
because it's overburdened because we're

775
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,390
doing the high-fat diets all the time

776
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,130
because we're not taking care of

777
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:02,500
ourselves and hey it's nobody's fault

778
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,090
it's just it's just life you know it's

779
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,230
how it works nobody knows nobody knows

780
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,480
how to take care of their health down

781
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,100
here and it's all guessing games no

782
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,140
matter who's a professional out there I

783
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,910
still don't know it's unbelievable so

784
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,010
the liver gets filled up with these

785
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,870
copper toxins the derma stalks and it

786
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,700
starts to leach out of the liver and you

787
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,350
start getting your first signs just say

788
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,820
you're a girl and you get your first

789
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,260
signs of eczema you're like why am I

790
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,760
getting these little bits of x-men you

791
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,950
go to your dermatologist and they take

792
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,420
go off gluten you go to your your doctor

793
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,860
and they're like go off of this maybe

794
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,420
you do a clean keto diet and you're

795
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,620
getting a little better but then it

796
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,620
comes back once in a while

797
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:38,770
that's your liver being overloaded and

798
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:41,290
then releasing little bits of this

799
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,640
copper toxin this Dermott oxen into your

800
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,110
bloodstream science research does know

801
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,240
anything about this is all medical

802
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,850
medium information from my source if you

803
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,560
guys that are that are new here just you

804
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,830
can look into my books and look into the

805
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,800
source you'll learn how it goes but so

806
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:59,080
and then when you want to clean this up

807
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,870
finally when you want to do something

808
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,630
about it and really heal and it's the

809
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:07,450
right way to heal you're gonna end up

810
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,669
releasing a lot of that Dermott oxen

811
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,800
because you have no choice and you're

812
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:14,320
gonna clean it out or cleanse it out and

813
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,270
so that Dermott oxen is gonna flush out

814
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,370
of the liver and it's gonna float around

815
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,750
and it's going to end up going to her

816
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,580
skin and we're gonna feel like we're

817
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,010
getting worse before we get better and

818
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,169
that's the that's it's a problem with

819
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,179
eczema psoriasis because it's no fun it

820
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:29,830
throws us off track sometimes and it's

821
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:32,410
also a problem because there's protocol

822
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:35,340
out there or there's modalities out

823
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:39,550
there or belief systems that actually

824
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:41,890
make it worse and it's not detoxing out

825
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:44,770
it just makes it worse and that's the

826
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:49,570
problem too and so I understand that

827
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:51,640
like the the the fight out there for

828
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:55,210
wanting to heal and find things that

829
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:58,150
work because you can try a new diet or a

830
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:01,120
new way to heal or an AIP diet for your

831
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:03,250
excellent psoriasis and you can try

832
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,570
something and it could make it worse and

833
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,730
you could think you're getting better

834
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:10,060
because you're detoxing no it's actually

835
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:11,800
a diet and making it worse sometimes you

836
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,150
know a diet like AIP will help it make

837
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,740
it get a little bit better but you'll

838
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,890
still be in the zone of it never getting

839
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:20,920
better because what happens is like an

840
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,780
AI P diet the makers or the or the the

841
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,100
system that's built around it doesn't

842
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,300
even know what causes your illness to

843
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,830
begin with they think you have

844
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,360
autoimmune and your body's attacking

845
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,670
itself anyway they believe in the same

846
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,050
thing everybody else does so until you

847
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,760
can get away from that and realize

848
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,590
there's four answers and real answers

849
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,570
like with excellent psoriasis it's

850
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,490
epstein-barr feeding off of copper

851
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,530
coppers in your liver the Epstein bars

852
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,150
in your liver it produces a derma stalks

853
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:45,010
in that dirty toxin builds up in your

854
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,630
liver it leeches out a little bit as we

855
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,060
break our liver down and stagnate and

856
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,860
get excited and stagnant sluggish and as

857
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,840
it leeches out we get our first bouts of

858
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,670
excellent psoriasis all on our body and

859
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,950
we're getting our first little patches

860
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,510
wherever it might be and then you know

861
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,980
that's how it works and then if we want

862
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,410
to really heal it and heal it the right

863
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,610
way it's it's a little it's it can be

864
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,290
confusing when you're healing it the

865
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,030
right way because all of a sudden you're

866
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,950
cleaning up that liver and that's what

867
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,810
happened you're cleaning it up and it's

868
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,120
flushing all those Dermott auxins out

869
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:16,630
and now you got kind of a bigger bout of

870
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:18,880
it as you're chewing yeah well it was

871
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:22,720
seemingly confusing on why I was getting

872
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:25,810
worse it actually was the sign that it

873
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,530
was actually working so so maybe when I

874
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:31,960
first did I did my first 369 I didn't

875
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,760
start off the supplement excuse me

876
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,130
regimen that he suggest in the book

877
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:42,790
right away I really incorporated that

878
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:43,750
after my first 369 then I tried having

879
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,510
my normal day

880
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:49,180
they diet according to the first three

881
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:51,130
days of deliver rescue three six nine

882
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,990
which are basically just removing your

883
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,700
radical fat intake lowering your animal

884
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,740
protein so once if you're gonna do it

885
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,810
for dinner preferably and to bring in

886
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:03,160
more fruits and vegetables throughout

887
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:06,610
the daytime so I pretty much molded my

888
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,730
day my daily routine around that then

889
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:12,550
the flare-ups were getting worse of

890
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:14,200
sorts so I decided to my second three

891
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:17,500
six nine the following month in March

892
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,830
this past March and that really

893
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:24,400
accelerated things because I was doing

894
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:26,320
the supplements that's the book right

895
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,260
there so if you go open the book so you

896
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:33,930
were doing I mean I was doing like a

897
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:38,170
child I see nettle mowing analyzing

898
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:43,120
licorice root spirulina barley grass

899
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:44,800
powder so so like on here you'll see in

900
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,940
the liver rescue book excellent

901
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,860
psoriasis right there I don't know if

902
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,630
you can see it there I'm sorry guys I'm

903

00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:15,700
dosage recommendation and I was

912
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:19,150
basically operating on this how do I

913
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:21,160
like fully optimize myself to get rid of

914
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:24,070
this as soon as possible I was just

915
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,590
completely fed up and over it so I was

916
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,360
gonna sacrifice and do whatever it took

917
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,700
well you know like in the book it'll say

00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,040

because you know it's I try to I try to

937
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:19,119
make it as easy to read as possible but

938
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,980
I when I get in this book this book Evie

940
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,810
calm parents do something get into drink

941
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,310

942
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:33,070
you went to the supplements I mean I

943
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:34,660
didn't help them I didn't help you first

944
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,670
of all we know each other

945
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,339
second of all I mean I want everybody to

946
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,380
know clear here that yeah we didn't have

947
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:43,660
a consultation because I don't do the

948
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,160
consultations because I had to just

949
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:48,099
write the books and all this and also

950
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,540
I'm praying that people knew that they

951
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:52,300
would know that the information is in

952
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:55,260
here but I mean you're obviously guided

953
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,630
because by your internal source or

954
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,070

mean and that was one of the biggest

979
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:05,440
kind of eye-opening experiences that I

980
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,150
had when I read the liver rescue for the

981
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,040
first time when I started really diving

982
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,990
into his social media and looking on all

983
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,480
the information on his

984
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:15,150
website was that all of this stuff was

985
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,369
for free and it's out there whereas all

986
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,200
these doctors and specialists are

987
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:21,420
requiring you to have a subscription or

988
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,980
they have a serum or a powder or a

989
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,350
tincture that they're selling or some

990
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,369
other websites always have you gotta you

991
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:31,560
gotta get your credit cards now then you

992
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:33,660
know look I don't even want

993
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,340
advertisements in front of this video

994
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,470
you need good YouTube you gotta wait 30

995
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,810
seconds and then click you got to click

996
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:42,360
the button saying you know what does it

997
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:44,820
go to stop the iPad or something it's

998
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:48,000
like no we don't want to do that because

999
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,530
isn't this about you healing that's what

1000
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,600
it's about you know is it and that was

1001
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:54,390
the genuine nature and it was well

1002
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,220
received on my hand so that's what was

1003
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,690
the easy part so like when you said that

1004
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,060
you weren't there to directly help me

1005
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:03,090
you actually were because you provided

1006
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:05,040
all this information and the onus was

1007
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:08,220
really on me to kind of take control and

1008
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,130
to really Institute the things one of

1009
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,660
the big things that I had when I was

1010
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:15,300
exposed to the information and really

1011
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,119
dived into it was the source of it I was

1012
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:22,320
a complete skeptic I mean man's talking

1013
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,730
to a spirit and what is it what is it

1014
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,440
what is he talking to is he talking to a

1015
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,930
ghost is you know I get to experience he

1016
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,900
talking to an angel is he talking to a

1017
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:33,960
dead physician in a thousand years

1018
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,190
confusing that's my initial reaction I

1019
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,230
mean just on a human level it was a

1020
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:44,730
little like wait we're used to these

1021
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:46,920
analytical scientific empirical that's a

1022
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,260
thing I mean you're yep you're highly

1023
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,970

an amazing amazing individual and being

1031
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,290
and but but it but it took it took you

1032
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,119
to be like wait a minute how do i well

1033
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,980
yeah I mean it took because you know is

1034
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,829
this guy talking to right

1035
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,180
and I grappled with it a little bit it

1036
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:25,300
like was hard for sometimes when I was

1037
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,010
suggesting and referencing Anthony's

1038
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:30,520
material to friends and family it was

1039
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:32,770
like he's not a doctor right okay I

1040
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:36,220
can't tell my mom I can't tell he's a

1041
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:38,500
doctor he's not and my mom I mean she

1042
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,690
when I was going through the worst of

1043
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,540
this so this was like in March of this

1044
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:46,329
year I mean she lost her her noodle I

1045
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,099
mean she was ready to take me to see our

1046
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:49,630
cousin who works at one of the best

1047
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:53,910
hospitals in like Philadelphia or

1048
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:56,349
something and I just tried to convince

1049
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,589
convince her that this was part of the

1050
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:00,760
process of the healing process that

1051
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:01,440
they're getting worse before it got

1052
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,589
better

1053
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,710
so yeah just back to receiving the

1054
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:11,079
information and kind of instituting it

1055
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,720
so when I had done when I had finally

1056
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:16,030
gotten all the supplements and I decided

1057
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:19,420
to do the second liver cleanse the

1058
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:24,040
following month in March that's when the

1059
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:26,109
real the weight of how much of the

1060
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,329
flare-ups and the intensity of it was at

1061
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:31,660
its all-time high I mean I was having

1062
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:33,250
sleepless nights my I would wake up in

1063
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:37,000
the morning and my sheets were bloody

1064
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:39,849
from from scratching it was highly

1065
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,859
uncomfortable one measure of comfort

1066
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:44,589
that I was able to find was taking

1067
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:46,630
oatmeal baths that's something that kind

1068
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:52,020
of just calmed me down and it alleviated

1069
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:52,020
some of the pain temporarily came back

1070
00:44:53,130 --> 00:45:00,130
during the detox process it was very

1071
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,960
helpful but so my own thing was like

1072
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:04,020
fully optimizing so taking all the other

1073
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,750
supplements so I'd done my second 369

1074
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:10,780
and then it got worse and then finally

1075
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:14,109
it started subsiding in about early

1076
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,660
April of this year and then I decided a

1077
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:19,660
few weeks then two weeks after that I'm

1078
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:22,800
sorry is when that strep story I told

1079
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,640
you about happen and I instituted

1080
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,660
Anthony's suggestions from the

1081
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,540
streptococcus podcast episode and within

1082
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:33,550
three and a half days the strep is gone

1083
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:36,610
spots the swollen asana tonsils in my

1084
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:39,040
throat when you can beat strep with that

1085
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:42,160
in any biotic the positive thing about

1086
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,190
that is it wasn't saying it it means

1087
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,460
that the strep really did weaken because

1088
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:50,440
the strep gets immune to antibiotics

1089
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,970
that's how it works that's why acne gets

1090
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,640
worse in people because acne is caused

1091
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:57,250
by streptococcus that's why you know son

1092
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,550
strep sinus infections UTIs bladder

1093
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:03,400
infections all strep related all of that

1094
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:05,440
can get worse with me with antibiotics

1095
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,970
over time but yet we meet anyone it's

1096
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,620
because people get so bad and is so out

1097
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,990
of control they have to take one in

1098
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:14,440
order to survive did you try to reflect

1099
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:16,720
but if we could learn to actually break

1100
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,950
down that strep naturally like you did

1101
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,360
and that's the whole thing the

1102
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,130
information is there and the medical

1103
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,830
medium information is there what happens

1104
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:26,410
is if you get a win one win with strep

1105
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:30,250
without the antibiotic you're now ahead

1106
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:31,720
of the game because it's the antibiotic

1107
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,310
that gets us in trouble with strep so

1108
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,930
now we're ahead of the game we did you

1109
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:36,940
did that with your own immune system you

1110
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:39,340
did that with your own with the with the

1111
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,780
right healing tools and when you knock

1112
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:42,340
that down that's amazing what did you

1113
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,810
feel like what you didn't have to go and

1114
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,420
get the anyone how did you feel like

1115
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:49,120
again and it's kind of circles back I

1116
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:51,310
mean it was a major trigger and it also

1117
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,960
part of the skepticism that I had and

1118
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:55,450
kind of the waffling back and forth rows

1119
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,460
like it's not it's definitely true but

1120
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,570
the source is just bothering me of sorts

1121
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:04,960
just kind of like it's hard for me to

1122
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:08,670
reason but when I all of these things

1123
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,560
kind of happen together where the heavy

1124
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:14,020
detoxing of the eczema eczema was

1125
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,850
happening in that march in leading into

1126
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,680
the April and then that's when I got

1127
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,750
this other thing happened with strap and

1128
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,300
once I was able to cure that and heal

1129
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:24,460
that without any drugs just aromatic

1130
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,110
herbs supplements fruits and vegetable

1131
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:31,120
the right kind the right kinds of water

1132
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:34,560
and so forth yeah it sees that really

1133
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,550
really reinforced that what he was

1134
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,620
knowledge that he was putting out there

1135
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:41,410
for these specific instances that I was

1136
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:44,460
dealing with was strep and eczema were

1137
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:47,400
completely accurate and on point

1138
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:49,710
so after that lap that bout of strap of

1139
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,660
couple like a week or two later I did my

1140
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:56,070
third three six nine to really try to

1141
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:58,800
nail this because I was gonna be

1142
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:00,540
traveling in May overseas I tell people

1143
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,610
that repeats three six nine you do it

1144
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,530
repeats on it exact right that's that's

1145
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,060
yeah so you did your third one

1146
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:10,500
I did three so I did one in February

1147
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:13,890
when in March and one in April and by

1148
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,540
the time I did my third it was pretty

1149
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:20,460
much cleared up I mean I still have some

1150
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:24,000
flare-ups here and there but the the

1151
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:26,070
intensity and the pervasiveness of how

1152
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,800
much is that's completely gone I mean I

1153
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:33,860
have pictures I don't know to show them

1154
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,860
kind of where I'm at now and past but

1155
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:40,530
after that third 369 it was really a

1156
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,480
matter of kind of maintenance and how do

1157
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:44,910
I make sure that I'm continuing the

1158
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,560
protocol so that this never comes back

1159
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,900
something I never wanted to do with ever

1160
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,550
yeah yeah and you know when you keep on

1161
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,250
getting rid of the copper inside your

1162
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:56,730
liver and inside your body and then you

1163
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:59,990
break down the epstein-barr then you

1164
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:02,700
know sure you probably could go back to

1165
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:04,140
eating foods that you used to eat you go

1166
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,820
back to things I always tell people

1167
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,620
don't eat all the fruits and vegetables

1168
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,930
get the right stuff do for three six

1169
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:11,820
nine because you know something could

1170
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,070
happen you can get more we can get

1171
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,170
another epstein-barr you can literally

1172
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,940
get one you can be in a public bathroom

1173
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,400
and get one off of a toilet seat people

1174
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:22,530
laugh at that but it's just the true you

1175
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,480
can get an Epstein bar you can get an

1176
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:26,130
Epstein bar in any relationship you know

1177
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,780
I mean I have people that have over the

1178
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,180
years have come to me all the time and

1179
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:32,300
they and you know they got sick right

1180
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,560
when they were they were on a loved hi

1181
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,900
they were on a loved high of a brand-new

1182
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:39,750
relationship and and everything was so

1183
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,640
excited then boom mano hit right away

1184
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,230
and then you've got a new Epstein bar

1185
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,610
and said why why do you think the mono

1186
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,560
is called the kissing disease you know

1187
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:48,690
that's why we but that's why they named

1188
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,880
it that but the point is is so we're

1189
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:55,170
good work we're gonna get epstein-barr

1190
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,880
along the way everybody's got it and you

1191
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:57,550
know the point is is you still want to

1192
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,840
take care of

1193
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:01,090
you still want the answers you still

00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,950
want to know what to do you know they in

1195
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,900

that I had had in over a year and a half

1226
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:20,860
was in April this past October I noticed

1227
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:23,430
to a tee because I was was Wednesday it

the night before step that Tuesday

1230
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,710
before that Wednesday game I was feeling

1231
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,050
a little sick thought it was the

1232
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:34,660
changing seasons something allergies say

1233
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:38,050
men wins whatever I woke up that

00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:41,590
following Wednesday and was completely

1235
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:43,420
knocked out I mean body aches swollen

1236
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:45,310
throat looked in the mirror and of

1237
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:48,130
course I had I started to get spots I

1238
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:51,100
heard up going to the game that

1239
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:54,610
following night and was that full day

1240
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:56,050
leading up to the game I was again added

bananas to alleviate the pain I was like

1245
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:11,140
drinking tea and the one new thing that

1246
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,480
I did

1247
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:16,529
in this last bout that I had last month

1248
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:19,059
of strep was I bought elderberry syrup

1249
00:52:16,529 --> 00:52:22,359
and talked about that which was

1250
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:26,640
incredible it super helped alleviate the

1251
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:32,200
pain that code in my throat so Wednesday

up that Saturday morning and the spots

1257
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:47,220
were completely gone the body aches were

1258
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:49,599
gone and it was just another

1259
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:51,400
reinforcement was of late another

1260
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,950
formation and it would talk about

1261
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,089
empowering and heart going back to the

1262
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:58,480
things you were talking about with that

1263
00:52:55,089 --> 00:53:00,609
but it was really kind of taking this

1264
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,559
into your own hands and it just proved

1265
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:06,009
to me that my bodies are meant to heal

1266
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:09,579
themselves yeah I've read somewhere that

1267
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:14,140
our gut lining re-established itself

1268
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:16,509
every three days so we're in constant

1269
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:18,069
motion of healing ourselves so adding

1270
00:53:16,509 --> 00:53:20,049
aromatic herbs and supplements and

1271
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,369
fruits and vegetables it's just another

1272
00:53:20,049 --> 00:53:27,720
thing to help accelerate the healing

1273
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:31,839
process and right now as it stands you

1274
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:36,190
know my eczema is subsided significantly

1275
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:39,329
I had the last time I saw my general

1276
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:42,609
physician when I got blood work done was

1277
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:44,859
2018 I think spring of 2018 and my

1278
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:46,930
cholesterol level bad cholesterol in my

1279
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:50,440
family and my cholesterol reading was

1280
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:53,289
304 and my LD 8 March eggless

1281
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:56,019
triglyceride panel there was it was

1282
00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:57,549
unknown and I asked I inquired with my

1283
00:53:56,019 --> 00:53:59,309
doctor and why there was no number

1284
00:53:57,549 --> 00:54:02,019
attached to that he said my

1285
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:03,880
triglycerides were so high that it

1286
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:06,579
didn't register there was no a number to

1287
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:11,440
register I haven't gotten blood work

1288
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:13,299
done since that but I have to imagine my

1289
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,890
mind my cholesterol I can't wait and

1290
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:17,589
I'll definitely follow up with you but

1291
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:19,480
there's just there's no way you know why

1292
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:20,539
it was off the chart like this because

1293
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,189
I'll tell you

1294
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:24,890
I thought it was just a genetic thing

1295
00:54:22,189 --> 00:54:28,339
because my family it runs in my family I

1296
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:30,140
didn't have the best diet for a long

1297
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:33,400
time I'm just kind of eating whatever I

1298
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:36,979
wanted partying doing the whole thing

1299
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,529
sure isn't really mindful of course the

1300
00:54:36,979 --> 00:54:40,339
reason why is because that's your liver

1301
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:42,619
cholesterol is all about the liver

1302
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:44,239
that's the whole point and even talking

1303
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:47,269
about that in the liver rescue book with

1304
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:50,479
the but that's the cholesterol producer

1305
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:53,239
that's the cholesterol container so

1306
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:56,029
basically that cholesterol liver gets

1307
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:58,459
weak sick stagnant sluggish bad

1308
00:54:56,029 --> 00:55:00,859
cholesterol it's the producer of good

1309
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:02,959
cholesterol that's all the liver right

1310
00:55:00,859 --> 00:55:04,849
there trick this arise all the liver

1311
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:07,489
right there it's all about that and

1312
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:10,039
insulin resistance and blood fat and all

1313
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:12,289
the things they talk about and so your

1314
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:12,739
liver was just in and you got copper in

1315
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:14,380
the liver

1316
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:16,819
you got the epstein-barr on the liver

1317
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,259
the liver is gonna be all clogged up

1318
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:19,910
with all that Dermott oxen that was

1319
00:55:18,259 --> 00:55:21,709
given you all the rashes of course

1320
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:22,969
you're going to be having liver problems

1321
00:55:21,709 --> 00:55:24,979
other kinds of liver problems

1322
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:25,939
cholesterol you're gonna have that issue

1323
00:55:24,979 --> 00:55:27,229
you're gonna have the end of the

1324
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:30,019
tracklist right you're gonna have other

1325
00:55:27,229 --> 00:55:32,029
you're gonna have other liver issues and

1326
00:55:30,019 --> 00:55:35,299
that's the thing with eczema psoriasis a

1327
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:37,459
lot of people actually have other liver

1328
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:38,839
issues it's in different ways and a lot

1329
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,919
of different ways not just cholesterol

1330
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:41,299
they might not have the cholesterol

1331
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:43,669
problem but they'll have something else

1332
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:45,739
but they'll have liver saw signs of

1333
00:55:43,669 --> 00:55:48,859
liver condition you know liver condition

1334
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:50,749
in so many other ways so but that's

1335
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:52,909
incredible where you get another win

1336
00:55:50,749 --> 00:55:54,589
like that where your your body is meant

1337
00:55:52,909 --> 00:55:56,089
to heal itself when we give it the right

1338
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:57,469
things when we know what we're doing

1339
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:58,969
when we're not playing do you feel like

1340
00:55:57,469 --> 00:56:01,069
you do you feel like you're playing a

1341
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:03,199
guessing game anymore if you like it

1342
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:06,049
honestly feel like I have the cheat code

1343
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:08,509
to life right now so it's not a guessing

1344
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:12,529
yet the password I have a password I

1345
00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:16,130
have the cheat code it's um and it's

1346
00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:17,659
been transformative I mean it's pretty

1347
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:19,999
much been the anchor I mean I've

1348
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:21,919
incorporated a lot of other things in my

1349
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:23,359
lifestyle I do cold showers I do

1350
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:24,890
breathing or yeah I want people to do

1351
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,569
that you know somebody said to me hey is

1352
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:28,189
it okay if I'm out there and I'm deep

1353
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:28,850
breathing in the morning at five in the

1354
00:56:28,189 --> 00:56:31,340
morning

1355
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:33,230
and praying to the Sun I'm like yeah did

1356
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:36,170
you do it go do it is it okay if I do

1357
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:38,990
yoga everyday for now yeah go do it but

1358
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:41,690
that here's the thing this is the hard

1359
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:43,520
core answers though right because you

1360
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:45,200
could do all the yoga you want and you

1361
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,310
can do all the other practices you want

1362
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,800
you can do all the things that I believe

1363
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:51,680
in in love you can do all these things

1364
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:54,130
but if you don't have the answers right

1365
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,270
so that the real the the guessing game

1366
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:57,920
problem that happens when we're sick

1367
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:59,510
with things because if people they're

1368
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,490
doing all the different stuff they do

1369
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:03,500
the meditations they do this they do the

1370
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:04,730
rewiring of the brane meditations with

1371
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,140
how they think and they're thinking

1372
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,550
positive and they're doing this and then

1373
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,520
I'm doing the yoga now all the things

1374
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:12,830
that I love out there but you can be

1375
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:15,490
really sick because I've had a waiting

1376
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:18,590
list of millions of people back in 2014

1377
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:20,360
that all did that kind of stuff they had

1378
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,490
all these things they went to retreats

1379
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,230
they did this they did they were in the

1380
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:25,670
hot springs they were in the Cold

1381
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:28,850
Springs they were doing all these

1382
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:31,070
different things and and it didn't fix

1383
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:32,240
him it was great and they were also

1384
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:33,680
doing and even while they were doing

1385
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,170
this and everything else that it didn't

1386
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,730
like so because they needed the answers

1387
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:39,620
the science of research doesn't have

1388
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:41,120
other than that's a guessing game don't

1389
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:44,930
feel like you got the cheat code I got

1390
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,700
the money another huge aspect of this

1391
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:48,530
one when I was going through the worst

1392
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:51,970
of this this is the months of February

1393
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:55,100
March in April of this year I was

1394
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:57,200
completely knocked down helpless and

1395
00:57:55,100 --> 00:58:00,140
thankfully I was able to rely on

1396
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,920
Anthony's repost with testimonials of

1397
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:08,170
various people you guys had appealed and

1398
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:10,520
I had nothing to lose so I slid in and

1399
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:12,740
message them on their Instagram teams

1400
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,450
and kind of told them my story and what

1401
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:17,720
was happening to me and they had any

1402
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:19,400
suggestions on how to kind of deal with

1403
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,440
it as I was going through this process

1404
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,300
literally every single one of them

1405
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:29,300

comfort and reinforcement when I was

going through the whole process I mean

1428
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:26,130
one of the people that stands out is a

1429
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,920
woman named what spirit says she had

1430
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,730

1434
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:42,690
husband and wife in Australia I think in

1435
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:46,680
down the line but also one of the main

1436
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:49,010
things that I've tried to when I've kind

1437
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:52,050
of told my friends and family about

1438
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:54,090
Anthony and his suggestions and his

1439
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:56,100
protocols is that none of these things

1440
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,290
are like mutually exclusive like you

1441
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:02,430
can't I couldn't just do celery juice

1442
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:05,550
and not lower my fat intake and do the

1443
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:07,830
lemon water for this connection run need

1444
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:09,390
it you need it the whole puzzle right

1445
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:11,610
because they know that all the card

1446
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:13,170
oh it's accelerator slot and all be

1447
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:14,550
that's a thing on YouTube I've seen this

1448
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:16,080
on YouTube where people like I did

1449
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:18,660
celery juice for five days and now I'm

1450
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,000
gonna give Anthony a bad report that

1451
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,500
every part and they'll do that because

1452
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,150
they don't realize wait a minute no

1453
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:27,240
medical medium information is the whole

1454
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:28,800
package but yeah you can you can fix a

1455
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,600
lot of things with celery juice on its

1456
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,100
own which so does use by itself I had

1457
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,600
people say hit my blood pressure's fixed

1458
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,430
head right my aches and pains are fixed

1459
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,890
hey this is fixed this is fixed all day

1460
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:40,260
long people drinking celery alone by

1461
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:42,810
itself with a crappy standard American

1462
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,970
diet they still can fix things but with

1463
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:46,320
a lot of conditions like this were the

1464
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:48,660
ones I'm talking

1465
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,830
you know with this yeah and it's you you

1466
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,750
want to make sure you do the whole

1467
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:53,460
package because that's a thing the

1468
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:54,960
medical medium information correct me if

1469
01:00:53,460 --> 01:01:01,530
I'm wrong you can totally do that

1470
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:03,930
you can set me straight you set me

1471
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:05,610
straight all right but the bottom line

1472
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:08,070
is with the medical medium information

1473
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:10,770
what I always thought from my source ok

1474
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:13,380
spirit of compassion was that it can

1475
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:15,840
take you as far as you want to go that

1476
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:18,750
it can keep on taking you as far as you

1477
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,610
want to go that's what it can do if you

1478
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:22,380
need to go deeper the answers are in

1479
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:25,110
these books they're in the medical

1480
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:27,390
scripture from my source so it can take

1481
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:29,160
you further and further along

1482
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,600
everybody's different to what's

1483
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,280
happening with their conditions and

1484
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,920
there's an answer in the books for

1485
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,570
everybody and for their conditions you

1486
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,580
just got to know how to read them and

1487
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:40,680
know how to actually get through them

1488
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:42,480
and get through the material and find

1489
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:46,910
your answers they're in there they were

1490
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:51,410
designed from my source for this you

1491
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:54,330
that's major facts and that's completely

1492
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:59,010
my personal experiences that's exactly

1493
01:01:54,330 --> 01:02:01,230
what that is what anthony's knowledge

1494
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:03,390
and what liver rescue and his podcast

1495
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:06,480
episodes and what his instagram and

1496
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:08,730
social media provided for me is a

1497
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,160
complete anchor so everything else that

1498
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:14,730
I'm doing with the breathing exercises

1499
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:17,490
in the mornings with cold showers trying

1500
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:22,140
to just to be active surfing so the song

1501
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:26,880
sort of all of that is rooted and

1502
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:29,280
fostered because of this regimen that

1503
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:35,130
I've been able to incorporate in my life

1504
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:38,310
as a result of Anthony's information and

1505
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:39,810
one other thing that I think is worth it

1506
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:40,980
was were part of my experience that I

1507
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:44,100
think might be worth mentioning that

1508
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:45,630
people can relate to is when I had a

1509
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:48,360
ridge below I hadn't been exposed to

1510
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:50,100
Anthony's information I stopped eating

1511
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:54,120
gluten or tried to stop eating gluten

1512
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:55,830
for I think about a six month window it

1513
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,700
didn't help because obviously there was

1514
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,230
all these other things that were

1515
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,589
happening it was never attacking the

1516
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:01,410
intro

1517
01:02:58,589 --> 01:03:05,420
thing but when Anthony offered the

1518
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:08,670
information that lutein and dairy

1519
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:11,430
actually are the food sources of

1520
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:13,380
pathogens that knowledge and another

1521
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:15,239
that knowledge is not out there I mean

1522
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,940
if it is it came from this source right

1523
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:20,130
because I we put it out there but it

1524
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,809
wasn't out there and I'm saying that

1525
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:24,150
because it mattered to you right there's

1526
01:03:21,809 --> 01:03:26,009
matter no I always hope it matters to

1527
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:28,259
people that they know that because that

1528
01:03:26,009 --> 01:03:30,269
piece of truth can sit I mean it can

1529
01:03:28,259 --> 01:03:32,999
save people's lives it can keep them on

1530
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:34,559
track yeah it's good not to think you it

1531
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:37,079
provided a sense of purpose

1532
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:39,210
okay I'm removing gluten and dairy for

1533
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:41,339
because of this specific thing it's not

1534
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:44,519
throwing darts at a board like it might

1535
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:46,499
be an allergy it might be I have to

1536
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:48,450
interject with this right here because

1537
01:03:46,499 --> 01:03:50,640
when people think out there is that

1538
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,229
gluten causes inflammation and that's

1539
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,529
why you remove it but that's nonsense

1540
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:57,450
because that that you only get

1541
01:03:55,529 --> 01:03:58,910
inflammation if you have a pathogen

1542
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:01,710
that's feeding off of the gluten

1543
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:03,690
creating the inflammation because that's

1544
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:05,880
why there I know nine year olds they can

1545
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:08,430
eat all the pizza they want pizza the

1546
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,559
the bread they want all of them donuts

1547
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:11,609
everything wheat base and everything

1548
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,430
everything

1549
01:04:11,609 --> 01:04:16,710
they not only I know people all over the

1550
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:18,479
world that eat all the wheat they want

1551
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:20,700
here in the US they eat it wherever they

1552
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:22,769
go all of it and it doesn't even affect

1553
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,150
them because they don't have a pathogen

1554
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:25,619
they don't have the strep and they don't

1555
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:28,319
have the epstein-barr the feed off of

1556
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:29,670
the gluten that information it comes

1557
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,229
from my source that's where it

1558
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:33,089
originated because science research

1559
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:35,249
doesn't know that pathogens eat things

1560
01:04:33,089 --> 01:04:36,719
in order to make people sick they would

1561
01:04:35,249 --> 01:04:38,339
rather think it's your genes they would

1562
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:40,410
or tell you you it's your genes they

1563
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:42,569
would rather tell you it's it's your

1564
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:44,489
body attacking itself so all I mean I

1565
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:46,140
see it on YouTube choose if my friends

1566
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:47,609
tell me I have friends that watch all

1567
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,170
the youtubes out there in health and

1568
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:51,749
they try to tell me what's going on out

1569
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:53,069
there like aw there's there's this

1570
01:04:51,749 --> 01:04:54,599
person on there an influencer and

1571
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:55,710
they're saying you know they're glutens

1572
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,849
causing their inflammation because

1573
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:58,619
they're reading this book or whatever

1574
01:04:56,849 --> 01:05:00,329
and they don't even know that it's

1575
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:02,519
because it's feeding the strep causing

1576
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:04,529
their acne and that's why they're

1577
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:07,019
getting their acnes because the strep is

1578
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:08,670
feeding off of gluten so there's you

1579
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:09,280
know no one they're all guessing right

1580
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:11,080
there

1581
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,340
the vegans and the Palio's or the vegans

1582
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,410
of the animal protein people they're all

1583
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:16,660
slinging science at each other and they

1584
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:18,430
all they don't even know what causes it

1585
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,290
conditions and illnesses and people tell

1586
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,790
me that all the time they say aw they

1587
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:23,170
don't even know what causes anything but

1588
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:24,970
there's all these experts constantly

1589
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:27,160
putting feeds out there saying this and

1590
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:29,200
this and this and the whole point I'm

1591
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:32,230
trying to say is it didn't feel good to

1592
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,730
be free from that because most matters

1593
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:35,680
in freedom and that's that one atoms

1594
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,970
life yeah medical medium information was

1595
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,410
always about freedom you know when

1596
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,820
spirit told me when I was younger and

1597
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:42,400
said you're gonna free a lot of people

1598
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:44,080
and I'm like how when I was young when I

1599
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,400
was a kid I was like how in what way

1600
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,470
like what do you how do you want me to

1601
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,990
free anywhere you're gonna you're gonna

1602
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:52,840
be able to message the source of it that

1603
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:54,880
the information that you don't have to

1604
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:57,120
be a prisoner to all of the belief

1605
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,350
systems that are built on misinformation

1606
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:01,090
and I was big words for me when I was

1607
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:02,890
younger I was like what I believe system

1608
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:05,560
what just information I was like what

1609
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:07,330
and you know and it took a while to

1610
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:11,080
figure that out I mean that how they

1611
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:13,210
think that works but I just wanna I feel

1612
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:15,430
good knowing you're freed from that

1613
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:19,030
stuff yeah and not just being like why

1614
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:20,260
stop gluten why stop dairy lactose

1615
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:22,420
intolerance first of all it's not

1616
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:25,420
lactose intolerance that doesn't exist

1617
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:28,000
it's bugs that feed off of lactose and

1618
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:29,590
create inflammation and science

1619
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,260
researchers and know this this is

1620
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:33,970
advanced information it's probably 30 40

1621
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,820
50 years ahead of science and research

1622
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:38,740
now yeah well I'm dead and gone

1623
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:41,380
hopefully is a long time from now what

1624
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:47,770
do you say unless someone gets mad at me

1625
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:49,600
yeah and picks me off my pajamas out

1626
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:51,670
there dumping the garbage out there yeah

1627
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,140
in the aliens ooh but anyway your

1628
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:55,630
information is gonna live forever that's

1629
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:58,690
one thing that's funny but the bottom

1630
01:06:55,630 --> 01:07:01,450
line is the bottom line is I gotta tell

1631
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:02,230

the talking I want I can do all the

1635
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:12,100
talking I want because I got a big mouth

1636
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:15,520
right that's what I hear

1637
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:18,430
and but you did the work you under you

1638
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:21,280
read the book you not only did that you

1639
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:23,140
looked for help you went to you guys you

1640
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:26,290
know me Andrew went to you guys

1641
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:28,030
for help and you guys got back to him it

1642
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:30,640
blows me out of the water

1643
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:33,520
I adore you for that you don't even know

1644
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,560
and because you're warriors - because

1645
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,820
you guys are like because you you see

1646
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,770
the flak out there and you see the

1647
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:40,570
negativity because of everything because

1648
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:43,150
of my source and all that because you

1649
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:45,340
know no one likes a smarty aleck that

1650
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:46,210
has all the answers out there and so and

1651
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:49,510
I got it

1652
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:51,760
but you guys are staying strong and you

1653
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:53,470
were helping him you helped him and then

1654
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,030
and then you you're making all your

1655
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:56,320
stuff you're doing the heavy metal detox

1656
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:58,240
movie you understood the books you

1657
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:01,810
understand the supplements you also

1658
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:05,200
suffered through your condition which I

1659
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:07,540
mean like honestly you know that part

1660
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:10,390
gets me welled up inside because knowing

1661
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:13,180
that I didn't even know you mmm but yet

1662
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:15,520
knowing you were suffering like that in

1663
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:18,130
that agony it was it was debilitating it

1664
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:23,400
was the most trying those difficult

1665
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:26,680
times in my life that's 100% true but

1666
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,660
being able to dig myself out of that and

1667
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,790
being empowered and weaponized with this

1668
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:32,800
information I like that weaponize has

1669
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:34,810
been something that's leaps and bounds

1670
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:38,620
change the course of trajectory in my

1671
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:41,230
life and it just took some sacrifice and

1672
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:43,810
just as much as Anthony sacrificing so

1673
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:45,370
much of his time and his effort and

1674
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:47,050
doing all the providing all this

1675
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:49,330
information writing books doing speaking

1676
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:52,900
engagements doing podcasts doing these

1677
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:54,840
interviews you know I'm trying to

1678
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,800
measure up to that in a sense by

1679
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:59,470
instituting some more discipline in my

1680
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:02,290
life and sticking to these these this

1681
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:05,740
regimen with things one quick thing that

1682
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:07,870
just I just realized one thing that

1683
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:09,820
really gravitated to me that I

1684
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:13,210
gravitated to in the liver rescue book

1685
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:15,160
was when to take supplements to take

1686
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:17,500
them with a glucose source not to just

1687
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:21,040
take them on it oh my god it's it's yeah

1688
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,480
that's so critical no tell us about how

1689
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:25,480
big that was kind of like a big light

1690
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,860
bulb that went off in my head was I've

1691
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,630
been taking supplements without a

1692
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:31,210
glucose or I don't know if my body was

1693
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:32,710
absorbing it is that this is how it

1694
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:34,060
works so everybody out there and they're

1695
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,900
afraid of sugar they're afraid of fruit

1696
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:39,470
sugar so you got fruit in here I

1697
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:42,290
I mean I though their fruit fear is fear

1698
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:43,900
yeah I was I fell victim to that same

1699
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:47,570
misinformation up there there was

1700
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:49,940
there's too much sugar in apples and in

1701
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:51,980
pineapples and all the various fruits

1702
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:53,870
that I've now reincorporated into my

1703
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:55,580
regimen yeah that's that's another

1704
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:57,620
that's another misconception out there

1705
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:59,660
holding people back and that's that's

1706
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:00,980
that's how it works it's be fruit fear

1707
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:02,600
afraid of fruit and all the different

1708
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,740
modalities take on that fruit fear

1709
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,110
because they all kind of attach

1710
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:08,840
themselves to the same misdirected

1711
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:10,400
belief system and it's just gets people

1712
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,020
in trouble because here's how it works

1713
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,270
if you're taking a supplement you guys

1714
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,960
you say you don't like me you don't like

1715
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:17,060
what I'm saying

1716
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,800
regardless listen to this if you're

1717
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,360
taking a supplement and it's not even

1718
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,550
recommend it by me or anything and

1719
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,720
you're taking one out there you're only

1720
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,880
going to receive what's in that

1721
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,230
supplement if you have enough glucose if

1722
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,700
you're eating fruit in your diet if

1723
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:30,890
you're eating something with sugar in

1724
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:33,530
your diet meaning healthy sugar because

1725
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:34,970
it takes sugar to bind on to that and

1726
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,530
drive it into the self so if you're

1727
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:38,300
taking a supplement it takes sugar to

1728
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:39,770
bind on to that and pull it into a cell

1729
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,950
and that's what Andrews talking about

1730
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:44,870
right now and and it's that critical so

1731
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:46,940
nutrients and vitamins and minerals were

1732
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:48,950
taking or anything you believe in that's

1733
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,720
not on the medical medium directory or

1734
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:52,490
or whatever the only way you're gonna

1735
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,840
get something good out of it is you're

1736
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:56,300
gonna be able to draw it into yourself

1737
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,830
through sugar the very thing all the

1738
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,770
different belief systems are afraid of

1739
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:02,600
it's incredible how and worse celery

1740
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:04,520
juice is the other helper because it's

1741
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,470
so sodium cluster salts that bind on and

1742
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,390
also drive the bay bind on the sugar too

1743
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:10,130
and go to your brain they go to your

1744
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:11,570
cells it's how we build muscles and

1745
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:13,280
don't judge my muscles I'm not in the

1746
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:15,590
gym every day I'm not in the gym ever

1747
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:19,100
I've never gone into a gym and for a day

1748
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:21,710
like that ever never been in a gym but I

1749
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:26,390
ride my bicycle once in a while my

1750
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:28,040
spirits talking about okay but I'm not

1751
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:30,500
in the gym I'm working on the books I'm

1752
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:33,100
getting everybody what they need but the

1753
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:35,630
bottom line is it's the celery juice

1754
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:42,110
it's a celery juice there's something in

1755
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:44,180
this celery and you know and so yeah so

1756
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:45,860
it's really that was a really good point

1757
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:47,180
that you were saying before I threw

1758
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:48,360
something it's nice and helpful because

1759
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,700
I cannot take

1760
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:52,290
my daily regimen of supplements which

1761
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,570
I've scaled back a little but I'm still

1762
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:57,300
taking a vast majority I'm taking Molly

1763
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:59,520
I'm taking Mullen House roof take

1764
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,380
register Steve taking cats claws

01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,480
get hang on and be here for this is

1768
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:07,830
really critical so just throw it at me

01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:18,600
quick I'm taking off my daily because of

1773
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,990
my daily kind of usage of this I can

1774
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,360
take

1775
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:22,710
you know three three stuff supplements

1776
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,480
and then drink my juice and this is

1777
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:26,880
glucose source to help to low so it's

1778
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:29,220
it's easier on a regimented basis

1779
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:32,460
incredible yeah anyway that's in comes

never thought in a million years when I

1823
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:15,210
was a kid I would be on YouTube live

1824
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:19,990

ever start doing my ratings up until 14

1830
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:32,770
years old there and and I never thought

1831
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:38,410
it'd be on YouTube live in 2019 June I

1832
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:39,970
was 19 and this is just how incredible

1833
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:43,540
is talking about your x-men how you

1834
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:45,550

1835
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:47,110
thing it's a magical thing I want to

1836
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:50,710
think like your food your dinners yes

1837
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:53,050
yes so this is obviously my daily

1838
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:57,520
regimen and then for dinners I've just

1839
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:59,200
pretty much followed the 369 protocol as

1840
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,440
much to a tea as possible and that's

1841
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:04,930
been reducing my animal by-product

1842
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:07,290
intake altogether pretty much we're

1843
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:10,230
moving it out I don't really eat dairy I

1844
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:13,510
don't really eat eggs anymore it's good

1845
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:15,010
feed the virus that creates eczema

1846
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:16,090
psoriasis I'm sure that's something I've

1847
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,620
asked well you know I see that in

1848
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:19,030
YouTube to lick someone's tell me hey

1849
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:20,260
there's somebody eating eggs with their

1850
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:21,430
xmas rice is something like well there

1851
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:24,910
goes that option and getting better

1852
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:26,830
because you can't well that's you know

1853
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:28,510
one of the things like for eczema

1854
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:30,670
specifically it's like you can't pluck

1855
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:32,230
out like celery juice all a car and

1856
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:35,980
think that that's gonna heal you I mean

1857
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:37,510
you got to do kind of yeah he's gotta

1858
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,800
bring in the fruit there's no there's a

1859
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:40,660
note I want to tell you that's

1860
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,880
interesting with with celery juice

1861
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:44,800
whatever good you do in your life so

1862
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,720
you're doing all these other good pieces

1863
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,670
of medical medium information so reduce

1864
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,810
even makes it even stronger right if

1865
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:51,490
you're doing something that's not

1866
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:53,470
medical medium information that has any

1867
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:55,120
value to it and not a lot does out there

1868
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:57,100
if it has any value to it some of the

1869
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,360
juice will make that value rise up and

1870
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,580
whatever else you're doing in their life

1871
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,800
always remember that it enhances

1872
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,910
everything so but it's not the fix all

1873
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,010
for certain problems but it enhances

1874
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:08,560
everything you're doing making it more

1875
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:11,110
powerful that you're doing good yeah so

1876
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,310
so but so your dinners go back to that

1877
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:14,710
right so I

1878
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:16,810
a lot of those things and I've brought

1879
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:19,540
in I've been making a lot of like soups

1880
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:21,910
i steamed sweet potatoes i steamed

1881
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,660
aggressive potatoes i make like a salad

1882
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,480
on the side

1883
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:27,160
i've been doing a lot of like a

1884
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,650
Mediterranean kind of inspiration with

1885
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:31,690
like based with a tomato Persian

1886
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:33,640
cucumber onion and then I'll add like

1887
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:36,130
some olives or some artichoke hearts

1888
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:38,050
some avocado to switch it up because it

1889
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:40,900
get kind of boring or whatever but so

1890
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:43,450
that I do steamed potatoes yams sweet

1891
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:46,120
potatoes and then I'll make like soups I

1892
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:48,970
did a zucchini soup last night super

1893
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:53,440
easy it was garlic onion zucchini some

1894
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:55,510
vegetable stock some coconut milk I've

1895
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,780

1896
01:16:55,510 --> 01:17:02,350
kombucha or kombucha kombucha squash to

1897
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:05,440

01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:07,210
you want actually heal an ailment I have

1899
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,070
nothing against kombucha tea but it's

1900
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:12,010
it's it's not it doesn't help people

1901
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:14,230
heal actual conditions and yeah real

1902
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:17,050
conditions so I use your recipe for that

1903
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:18,610
squash soup and then I did another one

1904
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:21,090
like a week or two later and just did

1905
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:27,250
butternut squash instead of the common

1906
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:29,520
kombucha squash it's gonna be confused

1907
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:31,870
yeah you got kombucha squash delicata

1908
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,580
toppling all the squashes to the winter

1909
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:36,340
squash and you know everybody up in

1910
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:38,050
North in North America or wherever were

1911
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,380
any luck I mean different parts of the

1912
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:40,450
country

1913
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:41,800
planet did the winter squash is out

1914
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:43,180
right now right yeah I mean it's

1915
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:47,470
everywhere it's and caps and all the

1916
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:49,030
Trader Joe's Buttercup butternut what

1917
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:53,710
else about doing like vegetable stir

1918
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:55,540
fries you know I do eat meat once in a

1919
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:57,130
while but I've really kind of made a

1920
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:58,600
conscious effort to really just kind of

1921
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:00,340
limit that I want it's awesome talk

1922
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,080
about that for a second t you know and

1923
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,760
medical medium information isn't just

1924
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,910
one way it's not just all plant-based

1925
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:08,470
it's not just all raw plant-based vegan

1926
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:10,510
vegetarian it's not just all paleo or

1927
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:12,220
animal protein or keto or all that so

1928
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:13,630
it's not any of that it's about the

1929
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,340
right information you could bring into

1930
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:16,990
what you're doing when to deal with

1931
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:19,030
eczema psoriasis you do want your animal

1932
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:20,350
products lower bottom line you want them

1933
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:21,760
low you don't want the dairy products

1934
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:22,960
you don't want the eggs you don't want

1935
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,710
the milk the butter cheese you don't

1936
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,840
want any

1937
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:27,580
bad for it you know and you want your

1938
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,340
fats down lower it's not even about

1939
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:31,870
animal products being bad you just want

1940
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:33,699
a lower animal products you want to

1941
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:35,380
lower your plant fats your animal fats

1942
01:18:33,699 --> 01:18:37,570
because that's what it is if you're

1943
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:39,550
eating an animal protein it's animal fat

1944
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:42,130
so that's what that is it's animal fat

1945
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:44,199
if you're eating a plant protein usually

1946
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:46,600
a lot of that is just powders that are

1947
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:48,429
that are designed off whatever but plant

1948
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:51,880
fats if you're eating too many avocados

1949
01:18:48,429 --> 01:18:53,469
olives olive oil nut butter sesame oils

1950
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,150
peanut butters almond butters if you're

1951
01:18:53,469 --> 01:18:56,500
doing too many of that with the vegan

1952
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:58,270
diet you're not going to get your

1953
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,820
psoriasis but your excellence rises

1954
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:02,350
better if you're doing animal products

1955
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,060
and it's too much animal print get the

1956
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:05,650
pork just too much fat in it too much

1957
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:08,140
chicken too much chicken fat so you just

1958
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:09,909
want to keep down your fats if you're

1959
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:11,469
gonna get excellence rises better that's

1960
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:13,420
one of the key components see there's no

1961
01:19:11,469 --> 01:19:15,040
belief system here it's not about that

1962
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:17,830
it's just about the right information

1963
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,870
it's not about the diet belief system

1964
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:21,489
that everybody banks on and starts

1965
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:22,330
believing and then they fight for when

1966
01:19:21,489 --> 01:19:23,620
they don't even know why they're even

1967
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:26,199
fighting for it about what causes

1968
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:27,909
illness so it's not about that it's

1969
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:29,500
about making sure your fats come down

1970
01:19:27,909 --> 01:19:32,290
when it comes down to healing something

1971
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:39,790
like this and and then it's been crazy I

1972
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:42,070
mean I'm I'm about to be 37 I just met
