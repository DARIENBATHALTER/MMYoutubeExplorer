negative energy

exposure why do we do negative energy

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,659
exposure because it's the beginning of

34
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,960
the cleanse and we got to make sure the

35
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,960
energy is right because people spew

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,780

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,599
store right after somebody was in there

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,959

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,640
so negative so negative and they sit

44
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,879
there in the store and they talk to the

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,099
checkout person and they just spew that

46
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,020
negativity on that checkout person and

47
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,300

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,460
to drive right to the brain really fast

190
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,139
designed to be highly absorbable in the

191
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,020
mouth that's what it is did you hear

192
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,419
that you guys designed to be highly

193
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,160
absorbable in the mouth think about that

194
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,919
for a minute not everything's highly

195
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,699
absorbable in the mouth

196
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,199
not even water is highly absorbable in

197
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,959
the mouth did you know that like water

198
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,539
has a process

199
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:39,839
water itself has a process it has to

200
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:43,279
find its way into your stomach and

201
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,899
really get absorbed that way

202
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,240
these are designed to be highly

203
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,120
absorbable in the mouth that's the way

204
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,300
they're designed from above

205
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,459
because when you put orange with these

206
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,899
if you put orange and wheatgrass

207
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,360
together it's not going to be highly

208
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:03,600
absorbable in the mouth

209
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,060
it's orange wheatgrass Sage sunflower

210
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,180
grains garlic then

211
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,279
that's when something happens we don't

212
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,140
know we don't have the science food

213
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,120
science we don't know anything down here

214
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,399
about what happens with that but from

215
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,160
above

216
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,140
I got the promise that that will do what

217
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,180
it does and it does

218
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,860
like the medical medium books and the

219
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,360
information always have that's always

220
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,760
pulled through but this is something

221
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,200
really important to know

222
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,200
it's the combination

223
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,860
and what it is and then that makes the

224
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,140
difference

225
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,420
so designed to be highly absorbable in

226
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,779
the mouth these brain shots

227
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:49,019
valuable healing components within them

228
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:51,660
can reach the brain fast it could reach

229
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,940
the brain quick that's why these brain

230
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,279
shots also work that's a big part of it

231
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,019
because they're designed so when you

232
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:02,279
guys take these brain shot therapies

233
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:06,600
that it reaches the brain quickly

234
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:09,240
that's a huge huge

235
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,440
huge aspect of your healing that's why

236
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:16,860
we get that relief that instant relief

237
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,260
so important these these specially

238
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,240
formulated shots have the ability to

239
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,640
reset and rewire the brain think about

240
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,040
that for a little bit

241
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,459
do we need a rewire

242
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,220
do we need a reset

243
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,440
you could ask yourself that

244
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:38,040
because these brain shots have the

245
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,720
ability to rewire and reset

246
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,839
the incredible part about from

247
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,880
information from above to reset and

248
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,640
rewire

249
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,380
and then the absorption level of driving

250
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,180
it right in the mouth it's already

251
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,220
absorbing

252
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,220
to the brain

253
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,320
already absorbing to the brain

254
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,399
just incredible when you think about it

255
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,500
okay these specially formulated shots

256
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,040
have the ability to reset and rewire the

257
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:17,279
brain but get this you guys to shock it

258
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,720
out of patterns while at the same time

259
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,600
reducing triggers you guys hear about

260
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,000
triggers you can be triggered easy

261
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,320
and when you have the negative energy or

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,120
you're getting negative energy from

263
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,380
somebody else you can trigger really

264
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,640
easy

265
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,640
it's easy to be triggered

266
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,019
and the thing is is these brain shot

267
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,820
therapies are all anti-trigger

268
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,399
that's what they are it's another reason

269
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,860
why they work

270
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,740
really work though

271
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,399
like with confidence they work

272
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:53,279
with Precision they work

273
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,399
Angela I felt that change explanation

274
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,920
points I gave the anger and the mood

275
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,200
shifter shots to my husband that was

276
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,860
having a bad night and it completely

277
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,339
changed his mood from Angry to happy and

278
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,339
joking incredible

279
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,640
here's the amazing part

280
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,640
it's ingredients from the Earth

281
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:23,160
but no one knew that there has to be one

282
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,440
ingredient that works with another

283
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,120
ingredient nobody knew that I would

284
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,120
never know that in a million years

285
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,399
nobody does there's no Alchemist there's

286
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,360
no person in health that would ever know

287
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,320
this nobody knows that when you take

288
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,019
that Sage

289
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,579
and you take that and you combine Sage

290
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,800
with wheatgrass

291
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,899
and then you combine those sunflower

292
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,200
greens with the wheatgrass and the sage

293
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,000
and then you combine that garlic with

294
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,980
the sunflower greens the sage and the

295
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,440
wheatgrass and then you combine that

296
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,660
orange or Tangerine juice with it nobody

297
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,360
knew ever

298
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,800
that that would knock the heck out of

299
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,680
negative energy

300
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,839
or any of the other brain shot recipes

301
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,620
were the anger

302
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,320
or the EMF exposure or the mold exposure

303
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,360
are all the different ones Kim says I

304
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,760
was already feeling a change after doing

305
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,519
the nerve gut acid stabilizer after just

306
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,180
two days in a row and that one by the

307
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,579
way

308
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,019
that one just compiles on itself and

309
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,500
just gets stronger and stronger and

310
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,500
stronger

311
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,560
on with the miracle of that you know

312
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,820
honestly

313
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,940
like when I was telling Spirit of

314
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:42,260
Kardashians like these are Miracle shots

315
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,260
these are Miracle shots

316
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:49,500
really really profound

317
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:52,440
so it's about anti-triggers it's about

318
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,839
shifting and rewiring with this but we

319
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,000
would never know no one would know that

320
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,800
these are you you cannot just put Foods

321
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,480
together and think that it's going to

322
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,100
stop a trigger

323
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,019
but that's why the information from

324
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,959
above is so critical and how this works

325
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,240
it's really really special

326
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,639
so

327
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,380
I'm in the brain saver book

328
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,779

329
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,000

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,060

Out of Rain saver

344
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,240
the onslaught of domestic chemical

345
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,180
warfare

346
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,579
in our homes in our schools in our

347
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,100
institutions in our society today has

348
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:08,040
reached

349
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,760
an unbelievable level never seen before

350
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,760

subconsciousness to purify

460
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,700
how insane is that allowing you to

461
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:43,559
achieve enlightenment in a world of

462
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,360
toxic corruption that keeps us from

463
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,120
Enlightenment how do we achieve

464
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,059
enlightenment if we have so much crap up

465
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,600
here and so much crap in here

466
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:57,780
and that's the home for our soul when we

467
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,740
purify and we clean and we cleanse and

468
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:04,020
we shock that junk out of our brain we

469
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,700
are creating Enlightenment we're opening

470
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,280
the door so Enlightenment can even

471
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,880

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,820

wow

475
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,480
Enlightenment is not about being

476
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,059
all-knowing

477
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,340
Enlightenment is the freedom to be at

478
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:28,740
peace because you have full control over

479
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,320
what resides in your brain

480
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,360
Enlightenment isn't just about all

481
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,580
knowing

482
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,559
it isn't just about knowing everything

483
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,960
that's not what enlightenment is it's

484
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,080
about having the freedom

485
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,660
the freedom inside our brain

486
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,480
the peace and knowing we have full

487
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,340
control empowerment Enlightenment is

488
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,080
full empowerment when we have full

489
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,340
control of what's Happening inside our

490
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,419
brain

491
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,419
that's powerful

492
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,760
that's powerful

493
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:04,320
since we don't have control about what

494
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,520
resides around us to the world think

495
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,080
about it you guys we don't control

496
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,000
everything that's happening around us in

497
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,160
the world we don't but we can control

498
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,039
What's Happening Here

499
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,760
and we can use our free will

500
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:21,740
and we can actually clean and purify the

501
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,740

563
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,620
I just want to make that clear

564
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,240
and spirit of compassion said yes you're

565
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:08,220
not me I said not me them

566
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,500
of course them

567
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,539
I said okay okay I'm sorry I'm getting

568
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,460
the information down and it says in this

569
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:17,159
book you're intuitive so you're

570
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,799
intuitive you're psychic that's right

571
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,539
all you guys all your psychic abilities

572
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,340
all of you

573
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,659
you're telepathic that's right you don't

574
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,140
think you're telepathic all your

575
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,940
telepathic right and you're Clairvoyant

576
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,679
skills

577
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,260
will grow

578
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,080
by the way sunflower sprouts you can use

579
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:40,080
another micro green Sprout like Spirit

580
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,260
of compassion says that line can be that

581
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,240
Line's okay right there so if you can't

582
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,720
get the sunflower Sprout you can use

583
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,419
another micro green Sprout until you can

584
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,640
find a sunflower Sprout they're easy

585
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,320
also to grow yourself sunflower sprouts

586
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,020
on your counter

587
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,059
but there's there's very little leeway

588
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,000
in these shots that's the one of the

589
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,840
only places where you can have that

590
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,580
little

591
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,500
curve

592
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,500
because there's something in a sunflower

593
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,840
Sprout that really amplifies it but a

594
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,419
micro green still has enough of that

595
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,740
chemical compound structure but it

596
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,120
doesn't happen like that with all the

597
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,900
shots and ingredients they have to be

598
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,900
what they have to be

599
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,860
yes you your Clairvoyant skills you're

600
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,360
intuitive you're psychic your telepathic

601
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,799
skills will start to surface when you're

602
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,299
doing these brain shot there because you

603
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,240
do these brain shot therapies on a

604
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:39,720
regular basis and all of that starts to

605
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,580
come out and starts to surface

606
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,760
oh man

607
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,760
you will be able to see truth easily and

608
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:51,200
clearly and be able to express yourself

609
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,580
increase creativity how cool is that

610
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,039
inexperienced joy in the simplest things

611
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,919
that others would not realize are joyful

612
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:01,679
that's the whole thing experiencing Joy

613
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,840
on any level in ways that others would

614
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,480
never think is even joyful that takes

615
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,860
you to another level right there that

616
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,760
starts to happen when you're doing these

617
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,760
brain shot Therapies

618
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:17,279
you can use a micro green if you can't

619
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,779
find the sunflower Sprout but really you

620
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,419
have to eventually get the sunflower

621
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,860
Sprout and you can use another Sprout if

622
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,320
you really have to

623
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,080
if you can't get a micro green but

624
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,039
that's the only way we have for the

625
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,039
negative energy shot

626
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,559
it's just incredible

627
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,559

748
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,840
time I'm gonna make another later boom

749
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,640
let it build on itself I'm gonna make

750
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,260
another one later boom I'm gonna do

751
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,080
three for myself

752
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:27,419
I'm excited about that truly

753
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,399
the negative energy exposure shot is

754
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,960
what I'm doing today you guys are doing

755
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,820
that with me if you're in the cleanse

756
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,520
it's a great way to start the 10-day

757
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,679
cleanse because we're gonna rock all

758
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,140
that negative energy out of us because

759
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,480
we can collect it anywhere you don't

760
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,279
think you can collect it

761
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,500
here's how it works

762
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,840
you may not be the original source of

763
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,580
negative energy

764
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,440
no

765
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,580
are you the original source of negative

766
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,580
energy no

767
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,640
you're not

768
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,760
someone else can be the original source

769
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:04,559
of negative energy

770
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,299
and their whole life's purpose is

771
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,320
disputing negative energy you guys don't

772
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,320
know but that's possible

773
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:16,159
an industry spreads negative energy a

774
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:16,159
person can spread negative energy

775
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:23,880
any kind of entity or force can spread

776
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,940
negative energy

777
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,340
a group of people can you guys know this

778
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,500
a group of people can just boom boom

779
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,299
boom get together even on social media

780
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,519
and they can spread so much negative

781
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:38,940
energy it's unbelievable look what has

782
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,519
happened when I put out my PCOS post

783
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,919
like the true cause or my true cause of

784
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,260
something else like ADHD look at it the

785
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,120
people they come in like wolves and

786
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,679
vultures and they're just spewing

787
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,679
negativity because they want to stop

788
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,200
everybody from healing right either way

789
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,059
you you may not be and you're not the

790
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,279
source of negative energy

791
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,960
but other sources out there are the

792
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,580
source of negative energy you have to

793
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,580
figure this out you have to know this

794
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,080
you can be surrounded by negative energy

795
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,419
you can be surrounded by other people's

796
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,359
demons

797
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:17,760
where they got a demon going on inside

798
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,260
their head and they're saying rotten

799
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,119
terrible things to you and they're

800
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,119
texting rotten terrible things to you

801
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:31,619
but it's important to understand

802
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:34,740
that you are not the source and the

803
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:37,080
creator of negative energy someone else

804
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:39,179
could be something else could be

805
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,399
but you need to protect yourself and

806
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,919
being able to actually shed any that

807
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:46,080
could be inside of you Susan says I

808
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,300
tried the burnout stabilizer and it was

809
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,940
mind-blowing

810
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,820
I felt the electricity running through

811
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,820
my brain it felt like my brain was

812
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,339
working at a higher level Susan

813
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,140
because it does after that because it

814
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:03,240
does work at a higher level after that

815
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,400
shot that's the difference that's how

816
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,080

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,599
detail that's critical don't drink all

your water your 50 ounces of water after

860
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,740
you've

861
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:51,240
shot you know taken that shot down

862
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:53,400
don't take the shot down wait 15 minutes

863
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,320
wait 20 minutes

864
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,839
even a half an hour is fine

865
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,339
you send your shot down don't just all

866
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,260

869
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,940
important detail

because I want you guys to experience

871
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,540

00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,800
incredible

874
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,740
now

875
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,320
why did I pick the negative energy

876
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,500
exposure shot

877
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,140
because I want you to be able to feel

878
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,900
what happens when you release anything

879
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:34,500
we collect

880
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,780
because we collected it's easy

881
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,700
so there's other reasons let's go into

882
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,700
the negative energy exposure shot now

883
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:52,530
[Music]

884
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:57,260
lost my music

885
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,520
all right

886
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,700
let's go into this now

887
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,560
let's find our negative energy shot

888
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,460
now let's go and let's talk about this

889
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,859
for a little bit this is actually

890
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,119
interesting

891
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:14,119
that was a little intermission

892
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,320
exposure shots that's the category we're

893
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,180
in right now we're in exposure shots

894
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,160
okay

895
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,099
negative energy exposure shot is the one

896
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,560
we're doing it's day one right now

897
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:35,040
let's talk about this these exposure

898
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:38,220
shots can be administered before an

899
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,619
exposure during an exposure shortly

900
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,960
after an exposure or even days weeks or

901
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:45,000
months after an exposure here's the

902
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,740
thing you can have exposure to some

903
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,260
serious negative energy not even know it

904
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,359
now things are going wrong in your life

905
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,680
it's like you're just you're off beat

906
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,680
something's going wrong

907
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,420
you don't remember the negative energy

908
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,920
that you've been exposed to that was two

909
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,020
weeks ago

910
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,260
that was three weeks ago

911
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:11,220
but it hangs with us

912
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,900
so if you do know what exposure you had

913
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,540
you're like oh my God that person I

914
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,400
talked to they were just like

915
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,260
they had to dump all their stuff on me

916
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,960
they had to dump all their stuff on me

917
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,119
it was like I had to absorb it all and

918
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,859
then they finally were cleared but what

919
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,480
did they dump on me did they dump all

920
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:30,540
this negative energy and they dumped it

921
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,420
all on me and I took it all in

922
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:36,420
well that was two weeks ago though well

923
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:39,060
you can still do this negative energy

924
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,300
exposure shot

925
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:44,820
you can do it shortly after an exposure

926
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,040
say you're driving a car and someone's

927
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,859
like flips you the bird

928
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,660
and throws your game off

929
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:54,180
right you're driving down the road

930
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,920
someone gives you the finger right some

931
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,560
road rage happens or anything see

932
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,359
someone cuts you off because they're

933
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,980
psycho in the moment like something's

934
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:04,020
wrong with them and they just they're

935
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,119
just angry or something happens and they

936
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,560
cut you off and throws you off you

937
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,000
almost get into like a little car

938
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,119
accident

939
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,820
it's time to do that shot

940
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,280
Sammy says oh my God I'm gonna need this

941
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,859
shot 20 times a day when I go home for

942
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,859
the holidays laugh out loud actually

943
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:24,420
that's actually a really good time for

944
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:26,700
the negative energy exposure shot

945
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,800
because I hear it all the time people go

946
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,680
home for the holidays people come over

947
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,680
family comes over and then your siblings

948
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,260
are all negative and stuff or somebody's

949
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,839
all negative right and you just you just

950
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,400
need to protect yourself that's a major

951
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,839
exposure so you want to do something

952
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,640
about it

953
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,500
yeah

954
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,359
so I'm going through the exposure shots

955
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,579
now now there's 10 different exposure

956
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:52,859
shots to choose from but we are at the

957
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:55,440
negative energy exposure shot right here

958
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:59,180
I'm excited

959
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,180
because I'm gonna start making it

960
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,680
and then we can talk a little bit about

961
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,079
other stuff about negative energy while

962
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,579
we're drinking it so let's do it guys

963
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,579
brand saver books right here

964
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:20,520
I'm nervous I'm actually nervous

965
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:23,579
my god I've never been really nervous

966
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,780
but why am I so nervous

967
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,700
it's crazy

968
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,400
but I am

969
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,859
actually nervous

970
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,420
I'm nervous because I don't know what

971
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:35,220
negative energy I might have collected

972
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,359
because I'm dealing with so much stuff

973
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:41,700
but man I'm gonna see it leave and I'm

974
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,160
excited so you're gonna juice the

975
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,740
ingredients in order that's an important

976
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,359
way to do this now if for some reason

977
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,880
you skip a beat and I want you to know

978
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:54,000
this if you skip a beat

979
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,680
and you juice it out of order

980
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,079
we're still okay

981
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,680
but you do want to juice it in order if

982
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,020
you can that does help okay so it starts

983
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,420
out with a quarter cup of tightly packed

984
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,400
fresh Sage I'm just going to gauge it

985
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,020
because I usually have my own methods to

986
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,820
gauge you know what's a quarter cup and

987
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,339
everything else so I have some Sage

988
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,859
right here

989
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:18,540
here it is

990
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,680
so I'm going to do is get my quarter cup

991
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,740
ready

992
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:26,180
so I'm taking the leaves

993
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,180
with the little stems

994
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,200
Lisa do you use the celery attachment

995
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,880
with the mm-1500 for these shots I most

996
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,079
certainly do

997
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,640
you guys this is 20 off CMM 1500

998
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:41,160
I'm just going to mention it for a

999
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,320
moment because the reason why I leave

1000
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:47,220
the celery juice attachment on in this

1001
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:50,400
because it squeezes every last drop out

1002
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:52,260
of that it extracts those phytochemical

1003
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,640
compounds like no other juicer does

1004
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,800
that's why these juicers are that

1005
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,960

and the whole system is so amazing

1029
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,660

so I'm gonna do a quarter cup of the

1035
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,700
sage tightly packed grabbing a little

1036
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,420
bit more

1037
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,420
right here

1038
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,240
I'd say it's about quarter cup right

1039
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,880
there and we're making a shot so I'm

1040
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,280
going to stick that in here

1041
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,260
the next ingredient is going to be the

1042
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,020
quarter the sorry the half cup of

1043
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,700
tightly packed sunflower greens

1044
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,920
so I'll get that ready as I'm running

1045
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,720
this

1046
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,819
and then we'll keep on moving through it

1047
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,819
all right I'm gonna fire this up

1048
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:37,880
and you can use the Sprouts as well I

1049
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,880
talked about that earlier get ready

1050
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,079
dropping a sage in there first

1051
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,700
boom

1052
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:50,460
now I'm doing quarter cup tightly packed

1053
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,839
sunflower greens if you want if you you

1054
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,900
could use a

1055
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,339
I mean a half cup you can use a micro

1056
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,440
green

1057
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,700
you can use a sprout if you don't have a

1058
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,000
sunflower green but that's the only

1059
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:05,760
leeway we have in this this combination

1060
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,460
or it's not going to work

1061
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,460
so I'm knocking this in so a half a cup

1062
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,300
of those

1063
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,440
I'm gonna put a little bit more because

1064
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,740
I want to when you tightly pack them

1065
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:26,480
it's a whole other game

1066
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,480
okay next ingredient

1067
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:35,220
wheatgrass so here's how it works

1068
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:37,859
I'm using Frozen wheatgrass

1069
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:39,960
for this one

1070
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,880
the best frozen wheatgrass is on my

1071
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,020
directory at medicalmedium.com and just

1072
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,560
letting you know

1073
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:49,440
and I'm adding it at the end

1074
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,480
okay if you have fresh wheatgrass like

1075
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,700
this I want to show you

1076
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,319
you can juice the fresh wheatgrass right

1077
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,720
here

1078
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:00,000
so I got the fresh wheatgrass

1079
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,720
so if you guys have that on hand use

1080
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,720
that for sure

1081
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,319
I have a frozen option too because what

1082
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,780
happens is most of you and I want to

1083
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:11,760
just talk about this for a second most

1084
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,680
of you don't have the option for

1085
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,780
wheatgrass for fresh wheatgrass like I

1086
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,300
do you don't have that option

1087
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:21,480
so it's so what you want to do is you

1088
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,579
want to use a frozen one the best frozen

1089
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,980
one like I said is on my directory at

1090
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:29,099
medicalmedium.com

1091
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:32,060
okay now we're going into it half a

1092
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:32,060
clove of garlic

1093
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:37,260
so I'm just gonna clean this garlic up

1094
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:40,260
for a second knock out a clove

1095
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,260
foreign

1096
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,619
got a little knife behind here I'm just

1097
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,619
getting it ready

1098
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,119
nice

1099
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,460
small garlic cloves so I'm going to cut

1100
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,800
this one in half because this was a

1101
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,079
really big garlic clove dropping that in

1102
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,760
this is the negative energy exposure

1103
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,579
shot if you guys just got here it's the

1104
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,980
brain shot therapy cleanse we're day one

1105
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:16,339
anybody new coming on I want you to know

1106
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,339
what's up

1107
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,220
okay if you don't have the wheatgrass

1108
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,260
okay the week the fresh wheat grass

1109
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,780
and you can you can definitely use the

1110
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,160
Frozen for sure

1111
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,780
but

1112
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,819
you have to have all these ingredients

1113
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,220
when you do this so you can always try

1114
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:36,960

1115
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,880

this feels so good it feels so good it's

1210
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:40,500
why

1211
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,880
that's why I've been just walking around

1212
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,800
with these

1213
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,380
because

1214
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:49,520
that's why I take these everywhere I

1215
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,520
take them into the bathroom

1216
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,880
take them to the kitchen of course

1217
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,880
I have them in the bedroom

1218
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,780
I just have to have them with me

1219
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:07,800
incredible wait 15 to 30 minutes before

1220
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:09,839
you do any kind of food eating or water

1221
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,839
drinking wait a little bit wait 15

1222
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:15,660
minutes give it time let it go to the

1223
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:19,500
brain and that's what it's doing

1224
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:21,960
I could feel it right away it absorbs

1225
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,180
into the mouth because of the

1226
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,640
ingredients and what they are and the

1227
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:31,520
amounts that they are

1228
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,520
they enter into the blood vessels quick

1229
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:38,760
right into the blood vessels they get to

1230
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:41,460
the brain fast

1231
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:44,579
and they're working on the physical and

1232
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:47,040
metaphysical aspect of your life of your

1233
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:49,559
brain and your body

1234
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,740
they're working on your soul and your

1235
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:54,599
subconscious mind and conscious mind

1236
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:57,240
that's what they're doing

1237
00:54:54,599 --> 00:55:00,599
when these brain shots go in they absorb

1238
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,520
quickly it's how they work

1239
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:05,839
and then the combination of what they

1240
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,839
are well that's age

1241
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,640
combination of what they are

1242
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,440
allows for high absorption rates

1243
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:23,520
into the bloodstream up into the brain

1244
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:25,440
look I'm whispering now

1245
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,780
I'm not even yelling anymore I'm

1246
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,980
whispering what did that shot do to me

1247
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,980
I'm actually whispering

absolutely incredible
