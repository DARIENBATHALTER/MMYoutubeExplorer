sister are doing a podcast and they were

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,740
talking about the people they want to

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,930
get on the show and one of them was

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,430
going to be Anthony Williams and of

32
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,930
course you know my fingers were crossed

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,689
himself I saw this happened this would

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,590
be incredible Kate was really curious um

35
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,080
and we were so fortunate for him to come

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,090
on the show and do the podcast and kind

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,040
of get a little insight on who you are

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,780
as a person and just your whole story

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,390
and everything and it was amazing and

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,600
incredible and of course I wanted to be

41
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:44,869
there and I got the chance to meet him

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,860
and truly it was because of Elizabeth

43
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:49,020
and I couldn't believe it was really

44
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,570
happening but I did get to meet him and

45
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,579
see how and you know just genuine and

46
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,560
kinda incredible he was and immediately

47
00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:01,170
the first person that I called was

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,439
Elizabeth because you can call me 30

49
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,439
years

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,300
oh my gosh you know I got to meet

51
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,820
Anthony Williams and the reason I was so

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,940
excited it was because she had

53
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:19,230
introduced me to him years ago when she

54
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:22,050
was going through an extremely dark and

55
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:26,460
scary time and as a very close friend of

56
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,320
hers it was hard it was hard as a friend

57
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,550
feeling so helpless seeing your friend

58
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,980
in so much pain and discomfort and the

59
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,500
unknown and the fear of what was

60
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,680
happening to her and her diagnosis of

61
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,530
Lyme and how it was affecting her and

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,830
seeing her you know go through all these

63
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,900
different phases and and things that she

64
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,080
was trying out anyways eventually a

65
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:57,990
little tiny shift happened and there was

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,580
a little hope in her voice and I was so

67
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,830
relieved and so I remember her saying

68
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,720
it's this book and it's the medical

69
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,690
medium and and this was years ago this

70
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:14,970
was 2015 no one early two-thousands was

71
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:24,120
talking about it and it wasn't getting

72
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:26,489
in the fight for truth I always say the

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:32,430
trends don't they don't save lives it's

74
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:36,780
it's it's one of you know my smartest

75
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,810
most passionate you know friends that I

76
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,520
know and extremely smart when it comes

77
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,220
to nutrition and healing and that's her

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,280
background for her to find something

79
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,410
that really resonated with her and gave

80
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,850
her a glimpse of hope I was like what is

81
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,030
this and send it to me and I want to

82
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,920
hear about it so I was lucky enough or

83
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,160
not lucky enough but I wasn't dealing

84
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,690
with anything as severe but I was having

85
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,310
pretty significant GI issues which is

86
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:08,840
the loveliest thing to talk about but

87
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,840
like I don't have it

88
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,969
fine and it takes over everything

89
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,370
because anything that you're eating and

90
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:18,680
anywhere you go you're constantly like

91
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,019
oh no how's this gonna affect me and oh

92
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,380
I can't go to this and you know you're

93
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,970
just I was you know I naturally fin

94
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,460
anybody that knows me from growing up I

95
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,310
like crap I've wonderful genetics I'm

96
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,849
thank God but I have this distended

97
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,620
crazy stomach that no matter what I ate

98
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:40,039
I thought oh I'm gonna shift and start

99
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,930
to eat healthy but I was eating this you

100
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,000
know kale salads and you know trying to

101
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,130
not eat the junk food and it was

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,620
actually making my stomach worse I was

103
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,630
finally diagnosed with SIBO which is

104
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,449
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth

105
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,550
and this was about eight years ago and

106
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,470
there wasn't a ton of information out

107
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,810
there I kind of just grasp onto it

108
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:04,400
because of a few of the symptoms that I

109
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:06,530
had and anyways she I eat have started

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,280
reading his book after she had told me

111
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,080
and it was this page turning I couldn't

112
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,490
put it down

113
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,490
highlighting stuff I'm waking up Oliver

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,729
my one small area that I was dealing

115
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:31,880
with and it really it shifted the game

116
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:34,430
for me when I saw her starting to heal

117
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,039
and the things that she would tell me

118
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,849
and the belief that I had because I was

119
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,590
witnessing it firsthand and so of course

120
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,710
for me I said well my gosh I'm going to

121
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:50,150
try this this is and after years of

122
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:52,219
struggling and nothing sticking and kind

123
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,050
of just settling into the idea that okay

124
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:56,240
this is going to be this is it this is

125
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,130
my my battle and of course it's not the

126
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,419
end of the world but I'm gonna have to

127
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:06,919
deal with it and then I tried celery

128
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:13,449
juice in my blender with a nut milk in

129
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:13,449
the earlier crazy yes sir

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,240
and it was a big you know juicer was

131
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,060
expensive I was like I'm gonna try this

132
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,530
out anyways it was such a game changer

133
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,990
for me it and it was instant and so I

134
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,220
like it's one of those things where you

135
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,870
know people say oh that's hilarious and

136
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,760
I want to try it and I'm gonna you know

137
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,050
do this and that when you really have

138
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,700
something that is an ailment that

139
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,370
nothing else is working for and it seems

140
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,320
so simple yeah yeah it's not simplistic

141
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,320
because the book breaks it down and what

142
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,640
it's doing and what it's replacing and

143
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,620
replenishing and if that really made

144
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,960
sense to me for SIBO but it was instant

145
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:04,520
and it was amazing and I committed I was

146
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:07,190
pretty good more people that just it was

147
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,580
it was so simple meaning I didn't have

148
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,500
to do some crazy you know take all this

149
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,300
out and only do this and do that it it

150
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:22,250
was tangible does that makes sense

151
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:23,930
and of course yeah coming up in February

152
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:31,760
will be a year he was announcing his new

153
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:33,800
book which was coming out and so in the

154
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,640
title if you can see it does some Siebel

155
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,110
on it it was the first thing that came

156
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,000
in my direction yeah you know we'll see

157
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,460
what information on it and that got in

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,990
healing and deliver and so when I got

159
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,220
went on to order my book of course it

160
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:56,060
said oh it's not coming out until

161
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:58,669
October and I was you know pre-ordered

162
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:03,860
it and it came and into Christmas

163
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:04,700
literally yeah I know every book on here

164
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,430
I've read them all they're all

165
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,070
incredible this one really resonated

166
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,600
with me and I know there's the new one

167
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,430
coming on I can't wait for that I feel

168
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,590
like there's just more information and

169
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,990
more knowledge and people want it that's

170
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:23,590
a little bit of my story which obviously

171
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,590
led me to to your story which

172
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,159
you know with the in the digestive

173
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:36,650
problems and it it can take over your

174
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,500
life like really people don't realize it

175
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,090
dress and you know lack of sleep and

176
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,669
you're worried about it and what am i

177
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:48,410
eating and what am i not even and I also

178
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,790
ended up doing the detox movie as well I

179
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,520
always have to have one cuz I always

180
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:57,820
have one every day again super easy to

181
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,180
make super tangible and really good and

182
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:05,360
that for me and like those two I would

183
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,710
say together was a game changer and a

184
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,350
lot of the stuff that happened along the

185
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,410
way I can talk with Beth too but it just

186
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,030
made sense and so for me it was let me

187
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,820
read this book does it resonate with you

188
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:20,590
are you you know where are you in your

189
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:23,780
journey I wasn't in the depths of where

190
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:26,750
but I was struggling and it was hard and

191
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,480
there weren't a lot of answers and but

192
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,880
we don't want a person to go into the

193
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,710
depths of work Elizabeth you know where

194
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,970
Beth was we don't want anything that's a

195
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:40,490
thing you're struggling as it was that's

196
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,740
a thing if we don't get the answers we

197
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,480
need we can go backwards more and then

198
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,190
something else happens and some you know

199
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,170
and it all kind of falls apart one thing

200
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,580
when you're doing one thing you know you

201
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,890
you want people to pay attention to

202
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,350
their bodies what when symptoms start to

203
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,970
come up and not sort of you know ignore

204
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,440
them and just you know stay on the

205
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,940
standard American diet and not do

206
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,800
anything these are warning signs that

207
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,860
your body is giving you that it's

208
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,730
unhappy with the status quo or you know

209
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,800
your current diet and so for me mine you

210
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:17,120
know if I really look at it I was sort

211
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,890
of set up for being taken out by disease

212
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:25,280
I was sort of emotionally spiritually

213
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:27,860
mentally and physically broken down and

214
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,530
and then it just kind of woke up

215
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,260
something in me and overnight I was in a

216
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,580
completely different body but I look at

217
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,890
people that are dealing with you know

218
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,790
things that were you know painful and

219
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,760
uncomfortable and you know

220
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,620
Sol and I really want to implore people

221
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,350
to pay attention pay attention to your

222
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,380
body now before you end up in bed like I

223
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:52,710
was oh yeah that's no way to live yeah I

224
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,900
mean that's like real like yeah here's

225
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,370
what you went through it's unbelievable

226
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,430
and if you want to share with everybody

227
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:02,940
and I think I think it's it's the Lyme

228
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:05,100
disease world yes would always when when

229
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:09,090
you're talking to me about it it just

230
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,600
brought me back to Lyme disease being

231
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:16,230
still nothing but a confusion out there

232
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,900
a wake of 40 years almost of people

233
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,580
suffering yeah and not getting answers

234
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:25,740
and getting bombarded with antibiotics

235
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:28,620
and so I had to get the truth out I

236
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,850
risked my life doing it but then people

237
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,370
don't realize that but you know you know

238
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,190
and now it's actually changed the

239
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,200
movement so ingre in a great way the

240
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,180
people human but I'd love for you to

241
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,700
tell a story because I think people can

242
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,620
learn from your healing experience and

243
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,320
your story how it started when you just

244
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,510
got hit with it yeah it's so

245
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,640
overwhelming and I don't I'm aware of

246
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,890
how much time it would take to tell the

247
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:01,320
whole story but I'm going to try to try

248
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:05,460
to focus well I think it really started

249
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:10,820
when I was an exhausted mom with a baby

250
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:14,580
who was one and a half at home and I

251
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:18,960
found myself pregnant again and I went

252
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:21,600
through a miscarriage and I had to have

253
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,910
a surgery following it and I was really

254
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,100
down at that point I was really I was

255
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:29,300
exhausted I was still you know nursing

256
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,890
my baby I found myself like pregnant was

257
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,400
you know another pregnancy and then I

258
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:37,080
lost it and I you know I'm I was a whole

259
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,960
I was already a holistic health coach

260
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,240
and a nutritionist I barely ever took it

261
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,860
I'd film before and all of a sudden I'm

262
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,810
getting this surgery you know I'm you

263
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,059
know having all these drugs pumped into

264
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,629
me and stuff in

265
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:54,199
and I'm really sad and grieving and just

266
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:57,349
kind of upset you know mad at the world

267
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:59,539
that this happened and it that parts a

268
00:12:57,349 --> 00:13:01,909
little hard to talk about but I know

269
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:02,929
that when I woke up the next day I was

270
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:06,289
in a different body

271
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:09,769
I had pins and needles and I had heart

272
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:14,769
palpitations and I had massive anxiety

273
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:18,469
and you know insomnia and burning skin

274
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:19,849
just a different a completely different

275
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:22,309
body and I thought oh this is just like

276
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:23,869
you know I'm everyone says like oh

277
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,459
you're grieving you know you're you're

278
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,319
anxious you know it's hormones your

279
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,929
hormones you know I had had hot flashes

280
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:31,969
I had night sweats it's just it's gonna

281
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:34,639
go away it's gonna go away when you know

282
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:38,209
the drugs wear off it's gonna go away

283
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,799
when you you know you just need to cry

284
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,569
about this loss that you went through

285
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:45,379
and you know just get back to your life

286
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:47,239
and it didn't happen I spent about a

287
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:50,989
year running around to different doctors

288
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:53,509
I went to you know all sorts of doctors

289
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:57,739
and then about at the end of the year I

290
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:59,569
got a Lyme diagnosis and I had had Lyme

291
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:02,659
disease when I was a college student at

292
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:05,059
21 and I had had a diagnosis then and

293
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:07,969
but I've been it been dormant for you

294
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:10,999
know 18 years and I'd lived a really

295
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:12,319
normal life so it was really kind of

296
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:14,449
surprising to me I was like well there's

297
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,039
no tick I didn't get bit again is it a

298
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:17,419
reinfection was it there the whole time

299
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,739
you know I didn't really have the

300
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:24,679
answers but I know that for the next

301
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:28,999
really you know several months I was

302
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:30,859
running around everywhere searching

303
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:32,089
going to different doctors going to

304
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:34,879
different Lyme doctors going to

305
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:37,359
different healers you know New York LA

306
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,979
like different parts of California just

307
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:42,469
the way that I can describe it is just

308
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,609
panic just you know can you help me can

309
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:46,159
you help me can you help me can you help

310
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:48,379
me and I would get these large protocols

311
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,079
back of things that I was supposed to

312
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:53,059
take and I I couldn't put it together I

313
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,669
didn't have the mental capacity to

314
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:58,159
follow it and I know that sounds crazy

315
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:00,320
but I I couldn't like follow the

316
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:06,889
doctor's orders because

317
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:09,709
I needed something very simple and I did

318
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:12,980
eventually go on one protocol that

319
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:16,430
really really made me go downhill very

320
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,380
very quickly and I wasn't really able to

321
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,680
use my legs in the way that I always had

322
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,360
I couldn't get out of bed and I would

323
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,069
just sit there I had to have someone

324
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,089
come take care of my daughter

325
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:31,250
I had a cane at one point briefly but

326
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:34,610
you know there was to help just to help

327
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,199
walk but I I it was really getting that

328
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,480
getting the cane and look seeing at my

329
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,630
house that I was like instinctively

330
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,240
thinking you know I'm a young woman and

331
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,399
I would see people in the doctor's

332
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,290
office like that were you know stage for

333
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,060
a neurological line which was what I had

334
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,259
and I remember my doctor saying like oh

335
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,800
you're not in a wheelchair yet you're

336
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:54,949
fine

337
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,100
and I remember thinking oh there's so

338
00:15:54,949 --> 00:16:01,339
many things but I remember saying like

339
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,690
okay you know there's there's got to be

340
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:04,339
another way there's got to be something

341
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,899
I can do and I think because it was I

342
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,850
had already gone to nutrition school and

343
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,399
I already like you know already love to

344
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,500
cook and stuff I I was just sort of

345
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,760
praying I guess for something else and

346
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,040
then they never dry joining this um

347
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,579
Ellie Lyme support group and there was

348
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,529
this guy on line and in the support

349
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,569
group that was very controversial and

350
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,310
people were fighting about it and

351
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:31,819
they're probably still fighting about it

352
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:33,170
but I just remember you know I kind of

353
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:35,690
had that personality of like when

354
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,110
something is frisky I want to know about

355
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,579
it

356
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,920
you know what is it I just want to

357
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:42,170
decide for myself and sort of bring in

358
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,670
the information and go how do I feel

359
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,639
about this does this make sense or can I

360
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,040
read between the lines or you know so I

361
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,779
that's how I you know started searching

362
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,339
a little bit and so I just I bought this

363
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:59,930
book this was the first book but if I

364
00:16:52,339 --> 00:17:03,949
say the guy online controversial I'm

365
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:05,540
sorry but so so I just I Amazon this

366
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:08,240
book and I remember reading it and

367
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,260
literally crying and telling my husband

368
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,959
same thing like

369
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,520
No oh my god no yes yes this sort of

370
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,669
intuitive knowing of like this is

371
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,880
explaining what I am feeling inside and

372
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:24,350
I don't care what anybody thinks I don't

373
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,380
care what's normal I don't care what's

374
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,419
being taught or told I know that what

375
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm doing right now is making me go down

376
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:35,120
down down and I would call my Lyme

377
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,130
doctor and say I really don't think this

378
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,080
is right and he would say you get you

379
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,549
get much worse before you get better

380
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,740
you're gonna get worse before you get

381
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,049
better and maybe there there is you know

382
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,059
detoxing and stuff on any protocol but

383
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:47,809
you're not you're not supposed to get

384
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,030
much worse

385
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:57,020
we have to get better that's only

386
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:59,809
because they don't know anything you

387
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:03,710
know I had to basically shut out all of

388
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:06,260
that and just go I know my body I've

389
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,210
been in this body for you know a long

390
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:12,260
time and I know this is not right

391
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:15,350
and maybe that work for someone and

392
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,280
that's their story but this is not

393
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,500
working for me and I remember literally

394
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,840
like walking and going like God give me

395
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,330
a sign if I'm supposed to get off the

396
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,580
you know standard protocol and get on

397
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:31,309
this give me a sign and I had I was

398
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,470
taking a walk and I went back to my car

399
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:36,500
where I was walking and one of my best

400
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,880
friends Chris had texted me a picture of

401
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,350
this book and was like I was just

402
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,940
thinking about you have you checked out

403
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,220
this guy I think you should check it out

404
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,700
and they just asked for a sign so it's

405
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,559
like okay I am getting it on getting off

406
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,929
of that today and I'm switching to this

407
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:58,160
and within about four weeks I was out of

408
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:59,630
bed I I was making I started slow it was

409
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,770
like you know okay I can start my

410
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:05,929
kitchen I'm just going to do the celery

411
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:08,870
juice I'm just gonna do this purple

412
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:11,390
murky looking it's actually quite

413
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,850
delicious oh yeah um I made it

414
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,429
religiously for two years actually and I

415
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,650
just like I was like autopilot I just

416
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:19,840
got up and I did

417
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,860
because you knew you knew you knew the

418
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,930
truth was there

419
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,360
you knew somewhere in your heart that

420
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,640
this is yes this is the right track but

421
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,770
I had to stay with the face of it like I

422
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,270
had to faithfully kind of make it even

423
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,190
when I wasn't feeling like it I had to

424
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,170
just faithfully make it and my healing

425
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,059
really came in shifts you know there was

426
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,410
an immediate like oh my gosh I have more

427
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,970
energy oh my gosh I can get out of bed

428
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,380
oh my gosh I can make stuff in my

429
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,450
kitchen but you know when you lay in bed

430
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,760
for a long time and he tells so many

431
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,140
people this that yeah once you start

432
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,820
getting better though you're gonna get

433
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,410
tired again because you're using all

434
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,880
these muscles you didn't use yeah now

435
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,280
you're in the kitchen and you're being

436
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,320
able to function but then BOOM

437
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,900
whoa now I'm doing so much more than a

438
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,520
happen I'm not yet ridden but you know

439
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,290
yeah then you get kind of kicked back

440
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,270
and it gets scary but then you're moving

441
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,340
forward even more did that happen oh

442
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,080
yeah there was at least a year

443
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,490
if I'm honest there was Italy because my

444
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,429
healing was like two and a half three

445
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:17,140
years there there was at least a year

446
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:19,330
where I my my mind it was like I woke up

447
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,750
from a 20-year nap my mind was sharp and

448
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,190
clear my spirit was so excited to get

449
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,500
out there and do the things that I

450
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:29,050
wasn't able to do even before I got sick

451
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,660
and you know I think I was like you know

452
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:34,210
just didn't know you know and and my

453
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:37,150
body was just like nope you're not doing

454
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,320
it today like you so I was sort of and I

455
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,809
think that kind of helped me because

456
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,730
mentally and spiritually once I had that

457
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:46,540
hope for healing I could kind of like

458
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,429
vision myself in the future like just

459
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,679
one in college stuff I'm gonna travel

460
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:52,450
I'm gonna you know when you're in bed or

461
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:59,740
even just not feeling well for so long

462
00:20:52,450 --> 00:21:04,809
it's like you're in your own prison if

463
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:07,720
you have amazing which I did but you

464
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:10,270
still it was this feeling of like I'm so

465
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,950
lonely because no one else knows like

466
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,570
what my body's feeling you have the

467
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,720
elements that we're going on and you

468
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,790
don't you let your soup or something

469
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,250
that people would be like we look good

470
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,140
yeah you're standing up yeah you look

471
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,270
good in a photograph

472
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,580
actually just took me six hours to get

473
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,679
up and out of bed and function to get

474
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,000
myself showered and dressed and I have

475
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,620
like a good like three hours a day

476
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,870
before have to go take a nap and come

477
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,549
back do you know any like it wears when

478
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,350
you were you were on a clock and that

479
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:40,840
clock was wait a minute what can I do in

480
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,460
this 45 minutes in this one hour before

481
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,770
I'm flatlined in the bed for a while

482
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,960
yeah and the nervous system is shutting

483
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,610
down and you're just you just know

484
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,080
you're not you know you know you can't

485
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,240
push yourself cuz you you've probably

486
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,580
learned that if you did you just really

487
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,799
flat low it my nervous game is collapsed

488
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,559
yeah in my dream everything you know if

489
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,480
I did too much and the adrenals start

490
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,640
kicking in everything I would literally

491
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,100
not sleep for three days and you know my

492
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,960
husband would be like did you know maybe

493
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,940
two or three days just because when I

494
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,280
was stuck the nervous system gets that

495
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,820
weak and when you're dealing with this

496
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,140
and what happens is it gets that weak to

497
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,450
the point where you can't sleep

498
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,630
regardless of how tired you are it's

499
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,650
hell and doctors don't understand how

500
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,570
this works they don't know why the

501
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,830
patient isn't sleeping or not don't say

502
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,770
oh maybe it's a Hertz heimer

503
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,419
or maybe it's this or they have no idea

504
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,190
it's not the doctors fault but it's it's

505
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:35,350
the industry science the research has no

506
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,380
idea about anything this is just in with

507
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:40,809
this and so when you push yourself too

508
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,730
hard too it could even get worse where

509
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,350
you don't sleep even more even though

510
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:49,910
you're exhausted because every nerve in

511
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:53,019
the body hurts too for example or buzzes

512
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,019
[Music]

513
00:22:53,790 --> 00:23:02,860
it was it was it forces you and I told

514
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,210
people to in the past or it forces you

515
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,760
have told a lot of professionals this

516
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:10,030
because they just don't understand how

517
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,250
you're feeling I said it's a prison when

518
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:15,190
you're laying in bed if you don't relax

519
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,559
the nerves and let them calm down yeah

520
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:20,140
for all the buzzing and the humming just

521
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:22,540
if you don't do that you will you will

522
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,429
be in real trouble yeah you you won't be

523
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,960
able to just get into the bathroom I

524
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:27,610
remember I went to someone's wedding in

525
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,380
New York and just getting on the plane

526
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,930
and land

527
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,630
I was like I looked at my husband and

528
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:36,390
every part of my body was like vibrating

529
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,470
and I was like I'm like the lights were

530
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,050
shutting out yeah

531
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,790
it was really really scary and I spent

532
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,170
the entire trip and went to the wedding

533
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,520
and they spent the entire trip in New

534
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,930
York in bed while my husband went and

535
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,670
did all this fun New York stuff that I

536
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,110
planned this with my daughter I mean

537
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,280
when you're young like this you're

538
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,130
dealing what does he must have thought

539
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,250
you were dying I for sure thought I was

540
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,440
dying I mean I yeah I told my husband

541
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,060
there were many nights that I said I

542
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,410
don't know if I'm gonna make it through

543
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:06,090
the night I think I'm gonna die tonight

544
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:07,710
that my symptoms were so bad and I would

545
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,210
just look at my daughter sleeping and

546
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,940
just say like I don't know how much time

547
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,530
I have with you but I love you and so

548
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,590
glad I got to be here with you and when

549
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,540
I was lying in bed listening to someone

550
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,640
else laugh and take care of her whether

551
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,130
it was my mother-in-law who was a saint

552
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,190
to come all the time or we hired someone

553
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,600
at one point to help us and or my

554
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,740
husband like they would take her to the

555
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,630
park all I wanted was to be the one to

556
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,310
be the one to take her to the park to be

557
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:40,740
the one to push the stroller to be the

558
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:42,780
one to make her dinner and and I I at

559
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,870
one point really said to my husband like

560
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't I think this is it and I just I

561
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:52,470
don't know what to do I want to be here

562
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,810
for that and so my being a mommy was my

563
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,000
motivator and it's still my motivator I

564
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:59,490
mean I am now at the point where I can

565
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,200
eat almost anything so I just want if

566
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,730
anyone can't eat anything I want you to

567
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,040
know that three years ago I couldn't eat

568
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,800
anything no gluten no dairy no sugar no

569
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,270
alcohol no processed food no nothing I

570
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:14,060
know you're not supposed eat eggs I'm

571
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:17,520
not good thing but I do eat and enjoy

572
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:20,310
everything but I know that I'm gonna end

573
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,130
right back up where I started if I'm not

574
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:26,820
careful so now this died all these books

575
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:29,100
I have all of these books and you know

576
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,480
sometimes it's 20% of my diet sometimes

577
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,760
it's a hundred percent of my diet

578
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,410
sometimes it's 80% it's always there I'm

579
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,570
always working in the stuff but you

580
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:39,050
worked hard at the beginning no you

581
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,050
wouldn't

582
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,049
you knew it was right at the beginning

583
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,390
when you were getting those results you

584
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:47,500
just had to stay with it and yeah and

585
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,850
the thing is is to do that while

586
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,400
emotionally I mean you already went

587
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,870
through emotional I mean hell and back

588
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,760
yeah or them

589
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:59,270
I mean you already went through so much

590
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:02,679
and then to have a sickness come at the

591
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:05,750
same time yeah you know and you probably

592
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:08,270
I think my my defences were sort of

593
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:12,620
immune system came down absolutely yeah

594
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:14,780
we the goal is to know what to do so we

595
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,480
have the right to be emotional and we

596
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:20,510
have the right to experience a tragedy

597
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,179
or a loss or a hardship that we have the

598
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,429
right for that because it's it's it's

599
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,890
worse than salt in the wound if you if

600
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:29,929
you if you have to experience something

601
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:32,000
that's happening in our lives and then

602
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:34,429
we get kicked down with sickness on top

603
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,620
of it and then that's one salt round of

604
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:38,600
salt in the wound and then the doctors

605
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,580
don't know what's going on in going on

606
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,919
in your body the professionals

607
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,110
that's another round of salt and as

608
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,570
fears people around us don't know what's

609
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:49,700
going on so thank God you have a friend

610
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,419
like there and because that's when you

611
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:56,000
find out who your friends are - oh yeah

612
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:59,720
true oh yeah I I have to thank my

613
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,570
girlfriends and my family were amazing

614
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,299
they you know Aaron's been my like you

615
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:09,110
know sister and earthly guardian angel

616
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:10,910
for thirty years and you know just she

617
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,890
all of my friends all my girlfriends

618
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,540
really walked through it with me and my

619
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:19,370
mother and my mother-in-law my sisters

620
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:21,650
my husband went through so much and you

621
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,690
know you do realize who your who your

622
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,400
people are and who gets it and who

623
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,860
doesn't get it at the same time it's a

624
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,169
really personal journey and the only way

625
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,750
that I got well was to really block

626
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:36,679
everyone out and and it taught me

627
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:39,500
boundaries of deciding what was going

628
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:41,330
going in instead of looking outside for

629
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,100
answers like just being here with my

630
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,470
book and being with my like I have a

631
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:49,820
little like supplement apothecary now

632
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:52,100
and my my frigerator and you know just

633
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,799
if I could do nothing else I could eat

634
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,109
it

635
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,539
and that would be like a healing healing

636
00:27:56,109 --> 00:28:00,999
thing for me I know once when spirit of

637
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:03,340
compassion when I was younger said you

638
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:05,799
know in these books when when we're able

639
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,269
to do these books cuz it I had to help

640
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,950
so many people for so many decades

641
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:12,580
before I could even do the books to get

642
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:15,070
this to you and Spirit said to me this

643
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,230
is medical Scripture and I was like well

644
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,539
what do you mean as I was writing this

645
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,879
down and spirit said people are going to

646
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:25,239
they're going to hold on to this and

647
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:29,759
read these words and it's going to get

648
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:32,999
them through a hard time and so I

649
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,200
realized even then right there that okay

650
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:36,879
this you know this is what it's about

651
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,009
it's about making sure that when you

652
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:40,809
were your alone in the world of sickness

653
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,669
because even if we have family around us

654
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:44,950
and we have friends around us and we

655
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:48,489
have good physicians around us yeah it

656
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,769
doesn't mean we can be saved when you're

657
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:51,909
that sick because you just where do you

658
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:54,369
go what do you do

659
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:57,070
even yeah and that's and and I said I

660
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:59,649
remember I said I my Lyme doctor one of

661
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,600
three that I went to I went in and I

662
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:03,460
started I must have been healing because

663
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,529
I was trying to get pissed off and when

664
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,879
you are you know suffering and you're

665
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:09,309
down and then you start to get a little

666
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:11,619
like fight and you a little like anger a

667
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:13,539
little you know that's actually you're

668
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:15,399
moving up the emotional guidance scale

669
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:17,409
and you're getting towards like you're

670
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:19,299
fighting for yourself and I remember

671
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:21,820
going in and going you know what you

672
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,769
need you need to treat forget about Lyme

673
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,249
you need to treat my fear disease

674
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:28,899
because now I'm in fear I'm in this

675
00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:30,820
scary Lyme world and there's just so

676
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:31,840
much noise and they know how to block it

677
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,769
all out and I don't know what I'm

678
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,879
supposed to be doing and you're not

679
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:35,489
telling me what I'm doing and I'm not

680
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:37,929
feeling better and it was just like

681
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:41,200
fighting for myself and being excited

682
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:44,169
myself in my life and you know you don't

683
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,570
have all the answers and I was off about

684
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:47,619
it and I think that helped does your

685
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,850
same fighting for yourself because the

686
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,350
truth is you were really lucky to have

687
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,700
people around you they were supportive

688
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,909
and I think a lot of people don't

689
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:57,549
yeah because or whatever it is we're

690
00:29:54,909 --> 00:30:00,759
grow up or who's around that people

691
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:02,790
believe they don't believe people don't

692
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,470
believe they think it's in their head

693
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,240
Oh case they don't get what's going on

694
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,430
they just don't understand as you say

695
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,060
you know medical medium a lot of people

696
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:15,390
want to be skeptical skeptical but for

697
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:17,640
me I was like this is you know you

698
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,860
you've learned yourself and you know

699
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,720
your body and if it's working I started

700
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,400
working for you of course and that I was

701
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,050
like and whatever is working for you

702
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,910
couldn't work for anybody that's how I

703
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,490
saw and literally it was like wait a

704
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,780
minute but that's the other thing some

705
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,090
people you don't have the support system

706
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:35,850
you don't have someone fighting for you

707
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,190
or believing your symptoms or you know

708
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,500
it's like just listen to your doctor you

709
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,810
know and of course doctors are there for

710
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,220
a course they're amazing and they're

711
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,810
always you know important I don't want

712
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,850
to say it's not going against but

713
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,680
sometimes thinking outside of the box or

714
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:52,080
trusting your body yeah

715
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,480
Kent helps you can help because you can

716
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,310
get bombarded with oh but this works for

717
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,630
that person and this you know this is

718
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,340
what my doctor says and this with the

719
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,660
other doctor says and there's so much

720
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:09,180
information but at the end of the day

721
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:10,740
like kind of trusting yourself I think

722
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,180
there are plenty of people that have

723
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,320
gotten well with the help of a doctor

724
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:19,470
and for me I I couldn't get organized

725
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,930
around what they were telling me to do

726
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,630
I really couldn't it was this was much

727
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,630
more simple for me and it was manageable

728
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:30,630
and it was it was like I always say to

729
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,940
like it's medicine being in food being

730
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:36,060
your medicine I remember in the very

731
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,970
beginning you telling me I had struggled

732
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,070
with Candida as well for a long time and

733
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:47,520
my kind of healing journey and I was so

734
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:48,960
scared of sugar and yeah you know fruits

735
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,340
and you know I was like she was talking

736
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,720
about the smoothing I was like I can't

737
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,760
really do you know the blueberries and

738
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,290
the thing that she was like no you need

739
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,540
to read this book and like understand

740
00:31:55,290 --> 00:32:05,010
and it really made sense to me you know

741
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:07,560
fruit is one nature and you almost have

742
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:09,690
to you know go against maybe what what's

743
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,910
trendy yes it's trendy to have less

744
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,980
friendly blue berries people are so

745
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,540
scared of you know bananas and this

746
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,790
thing has like what two or three bananas

747
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,679
in it I mean I had just yet three

748
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,900
bananas a day every day for two years

749
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,780
the reason my sugar was okay the reason

750
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,880
why trends don't save anybody from real

751
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,919
sickness is because they were originally

752
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,230
propelled by financial gain their back

753
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:32,880
their back my money and backed by even

754
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,559
studies for a reason they're backed by

755
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,299
things purposely and then put out to

756
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,250
Bank and bankroll and make money okay

757
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:40,530
fine but when you're sick and you're

758
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,929
struggling and you're in your bed and

759
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:44,730
you're you go to three line doctors you

760
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:47,040
think you're gonna die and then the line

761
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:49,770
groups aren't a lot of help sometimes in

762
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,650
the old days to a story everybody's

763
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,990
their own story but when you try to go

764
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,270
against the trend in a line group what

765
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,710
happens you know what happens there

766
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,220
because you know I noticed that people

767
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:03,840
what I mean I think I don't like I

768
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,190
couldn't really share it I think I'd

769
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,330
there were a couple people I did share

770
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:10,950
it with in there yeah I mean there's

771
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,530
people that don't get it and there's I

772
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,210
mean it's so simple so how could this if

773
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,760
you're really suffering how could celery

774
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,799
juice help you how could you know we

775
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,660
just we love to look outside for healing

776
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,480
we like to go to experts and we like to

777
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,549
you know oh this is the top top doctor

778
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,280
and I'm I think that works for some

779
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:31,950
people it just didn't work for me

780
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:34,799
because it was it was too complicated

781
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,840
and my body's really sensitive and you

782
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,820
get since I got reactions from every

783
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,250
system and you get when you get lime

784
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,559
yeah thanks ultra sensitive and I would

785
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,299
call me though nobody has ever had that

786
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,799
reaction I've heard that so many times

787
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,020
no one's ever had that reaction I mean I

788
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,090
couldn't handle you know even food

789
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,169
nevermind like you know a drug or

790
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,540
something that was new that I was

791
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:57,059
introducing so you have to know and what

792
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,340
I liked about this was I could control

793
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:01,200
it I could kick it up if I wanted a

794
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,570
little more cleansing and detoxifying or

795
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,309
I could pull it back and like the you

796
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:08,129
know the killer stuff the stuff that

797
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:10,980
kills like the you know cats call and

798
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:13,320
the licorice root and lemon balm stuff

799
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,619
like that I could kind of ease off that

800
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,270
for a while and I would just you know do

801
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:19,830
the supportive things like if I did

802
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:21,929
nothing else I just took the support of

803
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:24,300
supplements and food it's like how could

804
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,760
but when it's the right things when it's

805
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,950
the right things it all counts that

806
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,330
when it really counts yeah when it's the

807
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,010
right things that's what you were doing

808
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:37,770
you were doing the licorice root and the

809
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:40,139
cat's claw yeah because yeah because

810
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:42,720
Lyme disease isn't isn't bacterial it's

811
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,700
not bacterial that's the big mistake

812
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,320
and that's what happens that's why the

813
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,649
licorice and the cat's claw and all

814
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,230
these work because those are antivirals

815
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:55,050
and I really felt like I was viral like

816
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,639
the night sweats you know and I think

817
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,770
that everyone has their own brand of

818
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,110
toxic soup and you know some people have

819
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:04,190
more viral most people probably have

820
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:06,510
more viral and some people have

821
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,970
absolutely have bacteria bacteria

822
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,950
doesn't cause neurological problems and

823
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,960
that's yeah that's where science and

824
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,030
research is either completely in the

825
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,470
dark or can't help anybody out or they

826
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,690
haven't done any of the work yet but

827
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,790
that's that's a thing it's the viruses

828
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,320
that create neurological Lyme so when

829
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,690
you're diagnosed with stage-four

830
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,050
neurological Lyme that's a really high

831
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,210
viral load yeah that's if it is and

832
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:33,060
that's the controversial point too that

833
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:35,310
when I finally cracked the Lyme disease

834
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,420
world and kind of broke it apart because

835
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:41,130
it's shifting now thank God because

836
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,960
because there doctors know now they're

837
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,520
learning that it's viral because of this

838
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,500
information so there they're back and

839
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,710
down on antibiotics and they're trying

840
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,210
to bring in cat's claw yeah but when my

841
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,730
doctor said that actually one of my

842
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,560
doctors said you know people have got I

843
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,810
will say I don't know what's his name

844
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,520
but one of my doctors in California had

845
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,280
the book on his desk and I said we'll

846
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,780
have you read it I would challenge him

847
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,680
he's like no no how do you know what

848
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,640
you're talking about you haven't read it

849
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,080
and he said you know I saw him about six

850
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,820
months after and he says because I would

851
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,410
check in I had to check in and just make

852
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,880
sure he talked but usually I felt like

853
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,000
it was just sort of like a check-in like

854
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,740
what are you are you seeing this and I

855
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,380
would ask like I would ask simple

856
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:25,260
questions like hey you're lying patients

857
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,300
did they all have epstein-barr - or a

858
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,610
past infection for epstein-barr and that

859
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:33,480
he would say yes and I would say oh hey

860
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:35,520
um you know have people taking cat's

861
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,810
claw and gotten better and not taking

862
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,380
care but you know I would like ask him

863
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,590
he's like he told me at one point you

864
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,590
can

865
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:45,540
get better with just cats cloth and I

866
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:48,180
was like why did you tell me that a year

867
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:50,130
ago I was like you know are you reading

868
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,510
the book or you just you don't and I

869
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,950
thought that that was progress and

870
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,220
pretty well a lot of doctors were

871
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:59,220
reading the books but but not letting

872
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,540
people know too because in the early

873
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,160
days now there's lots of doctors that

874
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,230
say yeah I have medical medium books in

875
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,720
my practice because all the patients are

876
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,600
coming in now across the world globally

877
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,670
and in the u.s. especially and so what

878
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,860
happens is they used to privately look

879
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:16,620
at the books and lean from the

880
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,120
information and you know and then they

881
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,470
kind of you know they say well yeah

882
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,810
cat's claw can help

883
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,240
I mean I remember thirty years ago in my

884
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:27,060
office literally my first office thirty

885
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,590
years ago and I had a big jar of cat's

886
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,360
claw drive because she couldn't get a

887
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,550
good quality cats because I had to have

888
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,290
the drive and I would just take it out

889
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,730
when the spirit said take this out for

890
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,170
the person I would say this is what you

891
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,180
need to do for your Lyme disease and

892
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:42,150
they got off the antibiotics and they

893
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,570
took it in there you know well they

894
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:48,240
would make it in a bag and this is what

895
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:51,570
you have to do and and it's finally

896
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,550
taking off now but but you know there's

897
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,950
still there's a lot of problems we have

898
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,900
in the line world one is you know the

899
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:01,320
labs don't want to let go of bacteria

900
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,750
because they just built an empire on it

901
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,790
you got and then you got the antibiotic

902
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,310
sales right Big Pharma they built an

903
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,670
empire off antibiotics for lives Yeah

904
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,230
right

905
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,880
I mean hail if that's the right to do

906
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,170
that's right to do it I'm not I'm not

907
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,400
really cooling it I'm just saying if

908
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,550
that's what you want to do but the

909
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,890
problem is it's viral so we have but but

910
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:22,470
it's falling apart now because the

911
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:24,390
industry the medical industry actually

912
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,770
took big pharma took Lyme disease and

913
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,900
they moved it out of the bacteria

914
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,510
category without telling anybody and

915
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,640
they put it in autoimmune which means

916
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,920
it's not bacterial now it's autoimmune

917
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,540
but they did it in a sly way without

918
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,550
informing too many people without

919
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,290
informing too many doctors it's now

920
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,050
moved it's now considered an autoimmune

921
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,960
disease which means if it's autoimmune

922
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,820
that means that big pharma or whoever

923
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,790
the medical industry or science and

924
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:53,220
research believes that Lyme disease is

925
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,710
your body attacking itself no longer is

926
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,990
it back

927
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,760
Tyrael that's due to the medical medium

928
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:59,680
books because millions of them got out

929
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,839
their doctors are using them across the

930
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,410
globe and they know that it's shifting

931
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,780
whether anybody likes it or not saving

932
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,950
lives but we still have the Lyme disease

933
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,810
groups that are just all about

934
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,760
herxheimer sand bacteria because there's

935
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,859
a lot of old dogs that call them not the

936
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,570
people but the old doctors that don't

937
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:19,089
want to let go of that because they've

938
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:20,500
been if you're proven wrong there's a

939
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:23,320
lot of doctors that say you know what I

940
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,190
was wrong yeah I was wrong I care about

941
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,420
people too much

942
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:30,250
I want them better darn it it's viral

943
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,750
and it takes some time takes personal

944
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,820
thing and then there's some doctors and

945
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,010
I'm like I'm not admitting that that the

946
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,810
20 years I just bombarded people with

947
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,700
antibiotics cuz science and research

948
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:42,520
force them to force them to basically

949
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:45,490
and and they don't want to break them

950
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,200
and I understand I understand if you've

951
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,349
been behind something your whole life

952
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,270
you made it your life and then some guy

953
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:56,140
that's not a doctor coating around the

954
00:39:52,270 --> 00:40:00,339
Titanic it's hard to you know but you

955
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:02,050
know our message is I try to stay away

956
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:04,630
from all that because it overwhelms me

957
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,970
but my message is just listen to your

958
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:10,210
body listen to your know this is really

959
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:11,800
simple stuff I think when I was really

960
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,560
suffering and really looking for answers

961
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I thought about like my plants and my

962
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,869
dogs yeah and my child and just what are

963
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,290
the things that a body needs to heal a

964
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:25,900
body needs this fresh air sunshine

965
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:28,720
adequate hydration and you turn

966
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:31,750
nutrients nutrient-rich foods that it's

967
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,609
kind of really basic and this is we're

968
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:36,190
coming i hope full circle and empowering

969
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:38,170
people to really listen to that and not

970
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,510
be skeptical of it I think not too

971
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:43,270
simple it's what I've ever meant to do

972
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:45,490
and if you can find a healer or a doctor

973
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:48,130
who's supportive who's open-minded all

974
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:50,170
the better you know I would I would love

975
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,400
to have found that and maybe maybe one

976
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,780
of the doctors I was talking about who

977
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,130
is open-minded maybe he's here now I

978
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,930
haven't checked in and you know a year

979
00:40:54,130 --> 00:41:00,130
and a half two years because I don't you

980
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:01,390
know feel good but I I do think yes of

981
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,550
course there's agendas and stuff I

982
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:07,490
really do think that everyone's just

983
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:09,920
trying their best and that people

984
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,500
to help people and and they're not able

985
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,270
to really separate what's story and

986
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,250
what's fact and what's fiction and it's

987
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:18,619
just um well I'm it's just a murky

988
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,300
environment and world for everyone I

989
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:22,820
remember doctor telling me a member

990
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:25,100
doctor friend telling me Anthony you

991
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,500
know do you want to put this information

992
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,420
out there about Lyme do you want that

993
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,940
you know what I said I said what about

994
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:35,810
the mommy that can't get out of bed to

995
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:37,670
take her child to school and he said you

996
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:39,860
know that you're going against the

997
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:42,260
agenda that's out there you're going

998
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,610
you're you're trying to crack it you

999
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:47,210
know you're trying to you're going

1000
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:50,300
against all the rules and he said he

1001
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,410
said I've al you your fight he said you

1002
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,790
sure you want to do this because you

1003
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,400
don't have to do this and I said the

1004
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,900
mommy that can't make food she can't get

1005
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,630
up can make dinner and she has to rely

1006
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,460
on her husband or anything you know and

1007
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,710
then flee and and then and then the

1008
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,930
husband has to then change his whole

1009
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,060
life around and how he's working on his

1010
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,920
life parents move next door to us and

1011
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:15,590
helped us and he's he's losing sleep

1012
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:18,380
over how you feel what's going on yeah

1013
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:21,140
and my doctor friend said my friend said

1014
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,510
you know what I know I see it too I said

1015
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,670
you can't there's there's thousands and

1016
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,619
then hundreds of thousands of mom moms

1017
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,359
with the fatigue and the chronic fatigue

1018
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:31,100
and the buzzing and the ringing in the

1019
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,770
vertigo and dizziness and the high

1020
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:36,590
anxiety and they can't panic and this

1021
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:40,660
any aches and pains and then all their

1022
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:43,280
or rashes when they or the hot flash

1023
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:45,410
yeah and my doctor said it's this and

1024
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,390
your doctor says well you know

1025
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:50,330
experiencing the same things and that

1026
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:53,240
was what really the book really got me

1027
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:55,880
it's just oh there's all these different

1028
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,320
chapters with different like this

1029
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,910
collection of symptoms that's called

1030
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,980
this disease in this collection of

1031
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:03,140
symptoms and then you know talking to

1032
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,390
someone that had something else like ALS

1033
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,880
or aunt or MS or something that was

1034
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:10,100
similar to neurological line I was

1035
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,600
always like I wonder if it's the same I

1036
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,690
wonder if it's the same I wonder if it's

1037
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,550
a cousin of that you know and and I just

1038
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,690
was always asking those questions and

1039
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,730
you know that

1040
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:22,700
like controversial topic people are very

1041
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,290
attached to what their diagnosis is or

1042
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,710
what it's called or what their doctor

1043
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:30,830
said and I think that people I believe

1044
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:33,650
in you know the effect in a way and I

1045
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:37,940
believe that people need to do what they

1046
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:39,860
feel works for them and you know that's

1047
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,720
really really important to me but I

1048
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,310
don't think anyone can go wrong with

1049
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,200
more fruits and vegetables in their diet

1050
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,700
and when I was in nutrition school we

1051
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,610
learned something called crowding out

1052
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,380
and crowding out is just like bringing

1053
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,970
in the fruits bringing in the vegetables

1054
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,770
bringing in the herbal teas and stuff

1055
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:57,260
I'm just kind of crowding out the bad

1056
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,600
stuff and you know you're just naturally

1057
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:02,060
gonna you're naturally gonna eat a lot

1058
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,720
less like cheese chocolate beer and wine

1059
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:07,700
if you are you know I listen I hear I've

1060
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,410
listened to all your stuff so I hear in

1061
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,750
my head now it's like you know

1062
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:14,750
compassion is in your ear you're in my

1063
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:16,070
ear and it's literally like like well

1064
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:26,150
you can have one thought today but you

1065
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:41,690
would be better it's more like this you

1066
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:43,130
know just like annoying mosquito can you

1067
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,480
just steam a little asparagus on the

1068
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,550
side with dinner straight and so I

1069
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,050
always have that like how can I work it

1070
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,670
and how can I make it part of my life

1071
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:52,100
how can I bring it to my families of it

1072
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,510
they don't get sick and and you know to

1073
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,520
people that want to hear it you know

1074
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:58,460
it's the little things that we take for

1075
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,710
granted when were strong and we're

1076
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:04,040
feeling good it's every little thing

1077
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:07,970
it's not can I step out the front door

1078
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:11,150
and get to my little herb garden so I

1079
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:13,580
can maybe pluck some parsley that you

1080
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:15,680
know I couldn't even plant as my husband

1081
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,620
had to plant yes on or there's the

1082
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,990
little things can I can I actually you

1083
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:23,750
know take a shower yeah like how

1084
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:24,550
hardwood or showers enzymes like I got a

1085
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:27,070
lien around

1086
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,660
shots so any kind of hot water I

1087
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:30,850
couldn't breathe in the shower and I

1088
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,380
would feel like just like I was gonna

1089
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:34,690
pass out whenever he took a shower and

1090
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,420
I'd have to kind of like sit down or lay

1091
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:39,850
down I was really happy as laying down

1092
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:42,220
and I know that sounds crazy but just to

1093
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:44,920
get downstairs or to get dressed to hang

1094
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:47,080
out with my family was really hard and

1095
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,810
you know my daughter at the time was so

1096
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,370
so young that you know I think just it

1097
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,950
almost gave me more presents and

1098
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:55,210
attention to be with her in the house

1099
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:58,090
because I obviously couldn't work or

1100
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:00,070
anything but um you know she if she

1101
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,600
wanted to go and do something like I'm

1102
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,320
not going do something that she wanted

1103
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:07,210
to do this daddy

1104
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:10,540
it was my mother-in-law Sarah it was

1105
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:12,250
family or it was Nora the woman who

1106
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:14,620
brought in to help who is supposed to be

1107
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:17,050
like a babysitter for 15 hours a week

1108
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:19,030
ended up becoming like almost full time

1109
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:21,250
or full time at one point because the

1110
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:23,380
sicker I got the more I needed help and

1111
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:25,090
then you know not everyone has that

1112
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,340
luxury

1113
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:30,820
and you know I think if we had continued

1114
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:34,420
going the route that I was it would do

1115
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:37,690
it with every little thing counts when

1116
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,400
you're and then you're your and then you

1117
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:41,620
have to get into a mindset of I'm

1118
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,360
grateful I can shower today I'm grateful

1119
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:45,160
I can get downstairs and probably be on

1120
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,800
the couch for a little while and sit up

1121
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,780
yeah that's another thing too it's like

1122
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,590
how long can I sit up before I have to

1123
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:56,680
lay down that happens to a lot of people

1124
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:58,300
for like there were short hours of the

1125
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,590
day and then like I noticed as I was

1126
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,150
healing like it would get longer and

1127
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,880
longer and then I would like get up and

1128
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:06,310
out the healing to me was just like it

1129
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,260
would come I wasn't like oh I'm healed

1130
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,480
it was just one thing than one thing

1131
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,310
that I could do I could do more is it

1132
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,810
three steps up two steps back like I

1133
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,400
said on my pocket there's a roller

1134
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:17,200
coaster ride and I want to say that for

1135
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,880
people that are doing this right now and

1136
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,740
maybe you're in year one or two I don't

1137
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,330
know some some people you know it takes

1138
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,420
longer some people it takes shorter but

1139
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:27,100
just faithful just faithfully you know

1140
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,290
if you believe it and it resonates with

1141
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,270
you just faithfully do it because then

1142
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,530
you're just gonna get a shift and then

1143
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,180
you get another shift and then you're

1144
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:36,520
gonna have a step back but if you just

1145
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,410
keep getting back on just keep getting

1146
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,900
back on

1147
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:42,450
and believe it then that's when it

1148
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,970
really worked for me and I also think

1149
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:47,960
the emotional part of you know healing

1150
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:49,920
your emotional stuff is it's all

1151
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,570
mind/body/spirit so this is your body

1152
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,190
that you're healing but also your brain

1153
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:56,300
works better when you're eating clean

1154
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:59,880
and you're able to have more hope and

1155
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:09,030
you know just my spirit really when once

1156
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:10,050
I healed my broken spirit I think when

1157
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,360
you're when you're feeling good

1158
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:14,370
physically you can conquer anything

1159
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:17,130
emotionally when you're when the

1160
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:18,960
physical is down yeah that's when the

1161
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:21,120
emotional wounds are hard that's when

1162
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,430
everything is hard because you can't

1163
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,160
even distract yourself from you can't

1164
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:28,350
even do like I'm gonna go and take a jog

1165
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,030
I'm gonna go and take a run you know I'm

1166
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:32,700
gonna go and do this because you can

1167
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:35,280
distract yourself when you're feeling

1168
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:37,080
good to help battle emotional turmoil

1169
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,730
how many people go I'm gonna go and

1170
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,950
meditate I'm gonna go on a hill on a

1171
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:42,930
climb on a hike hike today with my

1172
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,670
girlfriend or my boyfriend and I'm gonna

1173
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,410
go for a hike because I'm battling some

1174
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,420
stuff emotionally I went to an emotional

1175
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,950
counselor this is not the Deacon when

1176
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,260
you're feeling good enough you can

1177
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,540
actually take action you can take action

1178
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,190
you can you can keep yourself busy you

1179
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,660
can distract yourself you can hop on a

1180
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,130
treadmill for a half an hour I have so

1181
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,690
many people that say you know I hop on a

1182
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:03,120
treadmill to burn off my steam and

1183
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:05,760
adjust me and balance me emotionally but

1184
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,010
when you get hit with that the viral

1185
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,310
issues and and you get hit and knocked

1186
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:13,650
down yeah and now you're just laying in

1187
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:16,770
a bed I tell people hang in there

1188
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:19,620
there's a way there's a way up there's a

1189
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,930
way up to heal there's a way out of the

1190
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,850
bed and there's a way to getting back to

1191
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:25,290
doing things you love again whatever

1192
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:27,450
that might be it could be the smallest

1193
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:30,390
things like taking a little walk on the

1194
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:32,640
street yeah I mean anything oh yeah I

1195
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:34,320
mean it was eating like yes that I

1196
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:40,020
couldn't eat for so long I mean it's

1197
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:41,790
that simple sometimes it's heavy but and

1198
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,740
then it becomes social like you never

1199
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:46,870
partake is something with people that

1200
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:50,500
you couldn't do or you know

1201
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:52,810
I'm not nothing but well conversing so

1202
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,610
you're in a social environment you get

1203
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:57,730
together with some friends or even

1204
00:49:54,610 --> 00:50:06,550
family and you can't socialize the way

1205
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:08,290
you want to work stressors I would just

1206
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:09,850
whelmed with the challah just the

1207
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,380
holidays like I wanted to be there for

1208
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:13,270
my family I wanted to cook and have

1209
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,350
people and I would just be like I can't

1210
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,960
handle this I have to be in my room

1211
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:18,850
because my nervous system was collapsed

1212
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,680
and that's around family you know we're

1213
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,330
more comfortable when we're at war when

1214
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,860
we're around family well what about

1215
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:26,280
friends you haven't seen in a while it

1216
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:29,410
could be really difficult because now

1217
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,200
you want more work I mean forget working

1218
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:34,720
it and it takes it to a new level of

1219
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,340
being hard on the nervous system these

1220
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,380
are all things people are going through

1221
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:41,140
with their lime and going through with

1222
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:49,980
their different symptoms and you you you

1223
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:49,980
push through this I know and you know

1224
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:55,570
you got more energy than I do today so

1225
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:57,790
I'm trying to finish up a book

1226
00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:00,580
yeah and I'm killing myself on every

1227
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:03,220
chance I can you got more energy than I

1228
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:06,670
do right now you're like you're popping

1229
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:08,560
with energy no I mean am I am I just

1230
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:11,080
making that up but she's got the energy

1231
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,940
seeing as the friend it was like first

1232
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,250
of all it was just it was a heavy time

1233
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,480
it was dark and it was scary and like we

1234
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,680
know we talked about the fear but it's

1235
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,490
that fear of the unknown what's

1236
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,850
happening to me

1237
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:23,650
no one really knows what does this mean

1238
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:25,090
how am I gonna get better and then it

1239
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,560
was like this little tiny light at the

1240
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:29,380
end of the tunnel and this process and

1241
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,240
the belief and seeing the shifts and

1242
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,670
then literally just you know over time

1243
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,610
there was one day I came to the house

1244
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:39,430
and I said I was like you're back like

1245
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:42,640
it was just a vibrancy and it was a

1246
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:45,190
lightness and you know and and she's

1247
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,680
literally supermom she's literally the

1248
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:49,870
greatest mom in the whole world and but

1249
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,380
you see if you see her energy and her

1250
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:54,630
pouch

1251
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,630
and she doesn't want to miss a minute

1252
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,960
that's the gift if anyone who has

1253
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,790
chronic illness or anyone that's spent

1254
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,990
time down whether you're in bed or you

1255
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,270
know some of the times I was in bed

1256
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:06,850
sometimes I was just at home on my couch

1257
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:08,530
pajamas like wanting to get dressed and

1258
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,840
like you know wanting to get out and

1259
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,920
like participate in life but it's hard

1260
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,170
on the kids

1261
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,030
it's hard on - you're wondering if it's

1262
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:18,100
affecting your children you wonder if

1263
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:19,930
it's a way to take care of your child

1264
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:22,390
but you you have to take care of

1265
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:24,700
yourself and you know that's I think for

1266
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,440
mommies it's the hardest thing because

1267
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,070
you are still even if you have somebody

1268
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,410
helping you

1269
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:31,990
you're still consumed with your child

1270
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:34,000
least I was just annoyingly there all

1271
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:36,010
the time and like unable to let someone

1272
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,260
really do it as much as I you know

1273
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:40,300
should've probably but you can hardly

1274
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:43,330
you can't listen to what you need when

1275
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:46,930
you have a crying baby a or a colicky

1276
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:48,910
baby which I had and you're exhausted

1277
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,680
it's just very hard it's hard you know

1278
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:52,000
in my practice even before this like

1279
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,640
mommy's feeding themselves like a

1280
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,430
nutritious lunch even you know instead

1281
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,110
of like eating like a sugary bar and

1282
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:01,650
going off to do a million things for

1283
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:04,930
their kids work we're a service to our

1284
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:06,490
children that is what the mothers are

1285
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:10,300
absurdist to their children and their

1286
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:13,440
homes and their husbands and and so when

1287
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:15,640
you're sick and you can't provide that

1288
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,730
environment and value levels and that

1289
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:22,480
basic nurturing that you want to it is

1290
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:25,540
very very tough on everybody everyone

1291
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,380
your spouse your kids everybody so so

1292
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:30,910
the gifts of having chronic illness are

1293
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,890
if you've spent time down then when

1294
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:34,060
you're it's the motivation of I want to

1295
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,500
get out I want to do this and this and

1296
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,930
then once you're feeling better you're

1297
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:40,480
like I'm gonna do everything it gives

1298
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:42,160
you like this new zest for life like I'm

1299
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,440
planning on these trips right now and

1300
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:48,280
I'm super excited and I go to concerts

1301
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:50,740
now and I I you know I've taken so many

1302
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,810
road trips since I got well I'm dragging

1303
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,000
my family and you succeed you'll think

1304
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:56,580
about it now like I'm on a road trip I

1305
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,230
could couldn't have done a road trip

1306
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,230
back a few years ago yours ain't easy

1307
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,860
[Music]

1308
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:13,850
this reminds me a point - can you just

1309
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:16,850
let everybody know that because I don't

1310
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:18,650
see anybody anymore okay you know on

1311
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,730
that level and I can't because I'm

1312
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,710
writing the books and everything like

1313
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:23,510
that that the informations in these

1314
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:25,940
books right it's there and all

1315
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,740
everything else because it because of

1316
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:29,240
how to stop helping up people because

1317
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,580
the waiting list was in the millions so

1318
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,680
I had to put it in the books years ago

1319
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:40,880
it's you weren't probably the last yes

1320
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:42,170
and I spoke to yes I applied to win the

1321
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,000
lottery and I had this like weird

1322
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:48,080
feeling I was gonna win which I never

1323
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:52,820
have because I lose but I I did actually

1324
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:55,190
win and it was February of 2016 and I

1325
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:57,140
was one of the last people it was that

1326
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:59,300
was pretty much wouldn't stop it's not

1327
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,950
this right I had to keep up with the

1328
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:06,950
books and get the information to the

1329
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:10,250
world there were there were hundreds of

1330
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:13,760
thousands of mommy's in the waiting list

1331
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:16,310
and hundreds of thousands of children

1332
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,260
win the waiting list and it was it was

1333
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:20,630
breaking my heart and there I had to do

1334
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,820
books cuz I knew there was no way I can

1335
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:29,080
do it alone and get to everybody yeah it

1336
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:29,080
wouldn't happen and so it was a mere

1337
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,980
this has the supplements this has the

1338
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:39,770
supplements in the book but it doesn't

1339
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:41,660
have what I always call your yogi and I

1340
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:44,470
would do like two drops and think that

1341
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,470
was gonna get me well

1342
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:57,020
out the handed ends and it has over 200

1343
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:17,300
different symptoms and conditions and

1344
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:19,250
the dosages right so what you you know

1345
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:29,660
theme I say through all of them is the

1346
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:31,609
same heavy metals because what people

1347
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:34,369
need to know is the viruses feed off the

1348
00:56:31,609 --> 00:56:41,599
heavy metals and and yeah all you need

1349
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:43,609
is a trigger an emotional hardship you

1350
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,349
can really I mean that's also one thing

1351
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,940
I want to say if I won the lottery I got

1352
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:48,560
to consult with them I he was supposed

1353
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:58,970
to only give me 30 minutes he gave me 60

1354
00:56:48,560 --> 00:57:01,460
minutes I did and I never talk to him

1355
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:05,900
again after I just had the books and I

1356
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:10,940
had the internet and I just would listen

1357
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:12,849
to the and I just would take notes and

1358
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:15,740
then I think what happens is I had zero

1359
00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:19,030
intuition about what was good I can help

1360
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:19,030
everyone else to oh I doubt that

1361
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:29,150
no you know even in my practice like I

1362
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:30,349
knew how to help everyone but I just put

1363
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:34,300
my self-care on the bar you mean

1364
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:34,300
intuition on yourself yeah self-care

1365
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:43,190
eating like I mean there were years

1366
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,140
where it was like frosting for breakfast

1367
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:55,520
I mean my friends can say that's right

1368
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:59,830
like old places where all you can do is

1369
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,830
like drink in a basement basically yeah

1370
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:14,900
in a basement with pizza so so no I

1371
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:17,120
didn't have a lot of like it was shut

1372
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,980
down it was disconnected so as I was

1373
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,720
doing it and I couldn't talk to you I

1374
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,800
had those you know three years this is

1375
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,680
the first time I talked to you since

1376
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,780
then so I kind of got better at being

1377
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,370
like ah what do I need today or what you

1378
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:32,750
know I would go with the basic protocol

1379
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:34,460
but I would feel it out and go like

1380
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:36,230
highlighted and I go back and it read

1381
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:47,930
chapters and I get so you did the

1382
00:58:36,230 --> 00:59:05,270
highlighting oh yeah listen because when

1383
00:58:47,930 --> 00:59:16,250
you find something that works there and

1384
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:19,580
he's watching like CNN or something with

1385
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:21,830
your intestinal stuff and I was said

1386
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:24,890
earlier how that could like take over a

1387
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:28,130
person's life and it becomes I mean the

1388
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:38,630
bloating the gas France yeah the just

1389
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:41,840
going to bathroom bathroom is like you

1390
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:43,550
and like where it even can give you like

1391
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,470
aches and pains when I get so bad

1392
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,850
because you're getting you get the look

1393
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,290
great do you get the low-grade viral

1394
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,170
stuff to know if there you get the aches

1395
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:52,359
and pains a little bit

1396
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,730
hands all the time everybody that knows

1397
00:59:52,359 --> 01:00:00,339
me surprising that I can actually be

1398
00:59:54,730 --> 01:00:02,440
facing you guys you know because they

1399
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:04,990
remember being at Kate's house yeah with

1400
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:15,970
you guys and and and we took a little

1401
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:17,500
look and everything you know I don't

1402
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,839
want you guys to think that I'm out

1403
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,579
there doing readings now think they said

1404
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:24,660
you're not leaving yes

1405
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:27,789
you're not leaving Kate's house and they

1406
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:29,650
yeah and they said this and I and no but

1407
01:00:27,789 --> 01:00:32,769
that's but it really was incredible

1408
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:34,750
because there was you know the reading

1409
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:37,450
came out and it was just stuff that no

1410
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:39,279
one knows about anybody and you know

1411
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:41,470
Oliver was job was on the floor and he

1412
01:00:39,279 --> 01:00:44,500
was like what I was this how's this

1413
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:46,599
possible and and it just but first of

1414
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:50,859
all it made sense and and to me I was

1415
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:53,380
like you know this is stuff that for

1416
01:00:50,859 --> 01:01:05,049
years I mean you talk about your ear and

1417
01:00:53,380 --> 01:01:06,940
hearing yelling he was like oh I was

1418
01:01:05,049 --> 01:01:14,859
turning around saying huh what happened

1419
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:22,170
I thought yeah so it was incredible I

1420
01:01:14,859 --> 01:01:24,700
felt like or question to anything it was

1421
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:27,339
yeah and it's really the end no matter

1422
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:29,559
what your ailments are I feel like

1423
01:01:27,339 --> 01:01:31,119
there's something in ya look back I

1424
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:33,789
don't want anybody thinking just because

1425
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:41,079
they can't have that chance exactly that

1426
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:44,619
they can't get the information and I had

1427
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:46,869
my complete experience literally come

1428
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:48,700
just you know watching her heal reading

1429
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:51,730
connecting to it saying oh my gosh this

1430
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:53,880
is a it makes so much sense and be it's

1431
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:56,559
the first thing that worked that really

1432
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,819
worked and I committed to it just as

1433
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,160
hard as I committed to any other

1434
01:01:57,819 --> 01:02:01,930
protocol that I was told in the past or

1435
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:05,410
antibiotics which caused other problems

1436
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:07,090
and this you know was a game-changer but

1437
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:10,210
then and then I got to meet you so it's

1438
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:12,280
the added bonus on top for me and you

1439
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:15,970

people's lives and you know I know

1459
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:30,930
exactly where I would be and it was so

1460
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:41,560
25th

1461
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:43,630
I threw a birthday brunch for myself in

1462
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,610
my garden and in my back like you know

1463
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:47,740
we'll call it garden it's patio and and

1464
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:52,650
I had all my girlfriend's there and had

1465
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:52,650
so much energy to like make the food

1466
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,310
days later

1467
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:07,960
I had like this that's what gave me the

1468
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:12,520
glimpse of hopes I was like well I feel

1469
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:14,920
amazing and I don't know why you

1470
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:17,050
working but it's working you know spirit

1471
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,340
of compassion told me when I was when I

1472
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,780
was younger and spirit of compassion

1473
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:22,120
told me there

1474
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:23,350
this information is going to empower

1475
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,810
people I didn't know what that word

1476
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:28,900
meant okay because I'm not people think

1477
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:30,220
I mean I hear a voice perfectly clear it

1478
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:33,100
gives me this advanced medical

1479
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:36,250
information to save lives but it doesn't

1480
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:38,650
mean I practice the most spiritual or or

1481
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:39,310
talked the most spiritual or anything

1482
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:41,560
like that

1483
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:43,930
and I remember once when spirit told me

1484
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:47,050
this is going to empower women moms

1485
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:48,400
women and everything men too and I

1486
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,960
didn't know what it meant I was like

1487
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,820
what does empowerment mean what does

1488
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,980
empower mean and then I heard it

1489
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:56,440
throughout the years but what it meant

1490
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:58,390
was you know when you're in the depths

1491
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,520
of despair like that and there's no

1492
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:02,050
answers and you can't even have that

1493
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,820
brunch you can't even have that brunch

1494
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:06,280
with family or friends or anything and

1495
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:08,230
you can't even even do anything but then

1496
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,270
you can take control over your life and

1497
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:11,860
you can actually I'm getting choked up

1498
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:12,400
and you can actually do something about

1499
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:14,620
it

1500
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,290
that's real empowerment now that that's

1501
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:19,180
empowerment and that's what spirit was

1502
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:21,490
teaching me like that's what this is

1503
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:23,710
gonna be is gonna be empowerment for

1504
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:26,740
women to be able to just to not be

1505
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:30,130
bullied and spiritually bullied by the

1506
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:32,170
industry by trends in the industry and

1507
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:33,610
somebody might say well celery juice is

1508
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,020
a trend Anthony actually it was never

1509
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:36,670
backed or there was no agenda

1510
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:38,770
besides healing and it wasn't backed by

1511
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:40,660
any funding wasn't back for any science

1512
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:42,820
and research science resources even know

1513
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:44,560
anything about snow and you know and

1514
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,120
it's funny it's like how many millions

1515
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,530
to sell you just have to heal before

1516
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,900
science research so like there's no

1517
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:53,380
starting behind it's not good for you oh

1518
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:55,870
come on Howard right you were in Howard

1519
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:57,850
Howard and it was so full circle for me

1520
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:59,320
and you know somebody said to me once

1521
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:01,420
like I don't know if this was in school

1522
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,210
or work but if you want to know what to

1523
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:06,460
eat like any food that's ever been

1524
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:08,710
advertised is probably something you're

1525
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:11,410
not supposed to eat and all the foods

1526
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:14,230
that nobody talks about that nobody like

1527
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:16,210
you know advertises about those are the

1528
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:17,500
foods those are the foods we should be

1529
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,540
looking at and you're the first person

1530
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,970
like I don't know how you made celery

1531
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:23,380
trendy I don't know how you made like oh

1532
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:25,809
you know I've become a

1533
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:27,460
lover of vegetables wears before you

1534
01:06:25,809 --> 01:06:28,960
know I said she used to talk that beer

1535
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:32,710
and wine where my four food groups

1536
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:35,680
and I you know it's just it's wonderful

1537
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:38,230
to feel to have this much energy and it

1538
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,700
comes from the plans it comes from the

1539
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:41,440
Sun that comes from the plants and then

1540
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,480
it comes into you and you know it's a

1541
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,369
live food from the earth it's one

1542
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,980
ingredient whole businesses of movement

1543
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:50,049
of Whole Foods it's back to basics it's

1544
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:55,079
stuff that my grandmother ate you know

1545
01:06:50,049 --> 01:07:22,109
maybe she wasn't but you know my mom and

1546
01:06:55,079 --> 01:07:24,309
they were picking wild blueberries ya

1547
01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:25,539
know I mean I do think that there was

1548
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:27,400
this connection with nature I mean

1549
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:28,960
growing up in New England that we felt

1550
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,849
with the seasons and we picked apples

1551
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,599
and stuff like that I mean maybe that's

1552
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:36,309
not too far no no you're picking out you

1553
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:38,019
know what's funny you know it's funny

1554
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:41,980
that elevated biotics that i talked

1555
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:43,839
about in the communal that you know is

1556
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:46,690
more advanced than it more advanced in

1557
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:49,210
any way way more advanced and microbiome

1558
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:50,859
talk even today microbiome talk is just

1559
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:52,210
a new trendy word for they don't know

1560
01:07:50,859 --> 01:08:02,529
what's wrong with your guts though and

1561
01:07:52,210 --> 01:08:03,970
you know what spirits are talking to me

1562
01:08:02,529 --> 01:08:08,259
as a child spirit said look we're

1563
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:10,359
picking you I said it on the pot because

1564
01:08:08,259 --> 01:08:13,480
you can probably handle it and you're a

1565
01:08:10,359 --> 01:08:15,279
fighter and no one even knows what I've

1566
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,069
gone through through this journey but

1567
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:21,359
but the point is those those ramps and

1568
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:21,359
everything you're like okay no

1569
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:28,680
I'm just trying to talk to the person

1570
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:35,760
that I was supposed to get to the

1571
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:51,060
information I get in my own way listen I

1572
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:52,620
do get in my own way I know I get fired

1573
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,640
up because you know when people suffer

1574
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:55,140
it's no joke

1575
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,850
that's the whole thing and people who

1576
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,950
hasn't some people who haven't suffered

1577
01:08:56,850 --> 01:09:01,640
yet or been there they don't know what

1578
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:05,010
it's like for the other person and

1579
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:07,860
that's my issue that's my issue not to

1580
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:24,860
the people that don't know my issue is

1581
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:24,860
to the people out there enough to be

1582
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:40,920
funny thing is is if you know the

1583
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:42,660
industry is saying don't drink celery

1584
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,280
juice you need to have all your fiber

1585
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,780
don't juice it all these things they

1586
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:48,270
tell people wrong information but what's

1587
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:49,530
funny is okay you know what no one drink

1588
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:52,020
it anymore I just want it for myself

1589
01:09:49,530 --> 01:10:03,600
because I it was it wasn't in the store

1590
01:09:52,020 --> 01:10:05,250
one time I had some the funny thing is I

1591
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,410
can't go into the store anymore because

1592
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:09,510
I'll be mom bar decor so I can't go in

1593
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:11,640
there and water a celery juice right so

1594
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:14,130
someone has to go and get the celery for

1595
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,810
me I'm like hey aw I'm like what there's

1596
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:20,610
no celery and like no I need my celery

1597
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:22,260
and so so now that I hear it when you

1598
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:23,310
hear an article say Oh celery juice

1599
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,770
there's no science research I believe

1600
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:28,290
good good keep the negative did you know

1601
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:31,280
what I'm like I need my cell you know my

1602
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,280
heart of hearts I wanted

1603
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:36,320
it's one of these things were I feel

1604
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:40,790
like a lot of people say oh celery juice

1605
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:42,710
but it's sorry there's so much behind it

1606
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:45,890
even though it's one of these terms

1607
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:48,320
it's like seems simple yeah

1608
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:54,230
the information in the books is what

1609
01:10:48,320 --> 01:11:02,960
really makes sense and the you know the

1610
01:10:54,230 --> 01:11:08,270
I wanna say the the breaking the making

1611
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:09,830
sense kind of in your body yeah you know

1612
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:12,020
you have to top off the fluency your car

1613
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:28,580
you you know you get low on fluids you

1614
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:32,120
get low on you know I'm not so the zero

1615
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:37,700
diagnosis is just an idea theory that is

1616
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:39,410
bacteria that's what the theory is okay

1617
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:42,290
so the difference or what I discovered

1618
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:45,880
along the way was a lot of kind of GI

1619
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:48,620
issues are in the lower intestine and

1620
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,550
you know it's just a different diagnosis

1621
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,030
and there it's kind of two different

1622
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:51,860
things

1623
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:56,360
talent it was first and it's kind of

1624
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:59,090
where the food lands we sit down it used

1625
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:01,070
to be the Candida theory yeah and I took

1626
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:05,570
a long time I mean I worked hard to

1627
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:07,730
break that one yeah yeah I had to

1628
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:10,100
actually split that world in half laughs

1629
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:11,780
clearly cracking maligne world I had a I

1630
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,900
had a you know the information of the

1631
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:16,760
misinformation I mean just like the

1632
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:19,010
candida right crack that whole thing

1633
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,120
open because Candida you first of all if

1634
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:22,220
you're trying to get rid of your Candida

1635
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,990
that's how we actually absorb our

1636
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:29,150
nutrients we have to have Candida to do

1637
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:33,520
this so that was a theory because that

1638
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:33,520
is my hard work well spirits hard work

1639
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:42,660
yes but now they moved it they moved it

1640
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:44,310
to see Bo yeah okay and but the problem

1641
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:46,410
is with that one they don't know what

1642
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:48,330
bacteria it is that's behind anything

1643
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:50,220
and it's streptococcus that's what it is

1644
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:52,860
and it's caused from your liver being

1645
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:55,200
stagnant sluggish low bio reserves and

1646
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,470
low hydrochloric acid but here's the

1647
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,450
thing

1648
01:12:55,470 --> 01:13:00,090
and then strep we all have strep in us

1649
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:02,250
and then it becomes a gut issue is what

1650
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:03,720
it does now they're trying to shift it

1651
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,220
all to this microbiome thing like

1652
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:07,500
everybody's like oh there's something in

1653
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:11,310
there that special they're still behind

1654
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:13,860
by 2030 years it's it's the elevated

1655
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:21,240
bionics that you know about right did

1656
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:23,880
you hear that I'm not friends with any

1657
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,830
farmers and I don't have okay so okay

1658
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,660
are you able to tell people I know it's

1659
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:29,880
in the boat or the countertop but like

1660
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:32,160
the basics of like if you want the

1661
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:34,320
elevated wrote your own parsley in a pot

1662
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:37,500
in a plant where in your kitchen if you

1663
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,480
need to yeah absolutely if you have to

1664
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:46,830
so you literally just buy like organic

1665
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:48,360
seeds seeds and gigantic soil grows when

1666
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:50,310
you pick that piece of parsley

1667
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,050
it's got bacteria on it it's got

1668
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:53,940
microorganism on it and those those are

1669
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:55,890
the I don't wash it leave it that you

1670
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:57,570
don't have to it's growing in your own

1671
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,370
it's not like you're using some

1672
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:08,840
dangerous this or that or yeah I'm using

1673
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:12,270
some kind of whatever it's true and so

1674
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:14,730
so what happens is that that parsley

1675
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:17,010
just is an example it has the elevated

1676
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:18,930
biotics and on it which science research

1677
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:20,250
doesn't know about either there's not

1678
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:23,190
only signs in research but all the

1679
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:25,530
probiotic companies that that's not what

1680
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:26,730
that is that just dies in your system

1681
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:28,740
you take all those probiotics it just

1682
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:31,410
gets eaten off your stomach acid it just

1683
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:35,190
kills it leaves that never even gets

1684
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:37,710
down there because it's not really no

1685
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:40,740
not in an item probiotic land but not

1686
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:42,480
even in earth you know earth soil borne

1687
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,720
work Michael Rehm ISM probiotic none of

1688
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,430
that

1689
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:48,230
it's the probe it's the it's the

1690
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:48,230
elevated biotic sorry not the end

1691
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:58,060
and it's that it's that microorganism

1692
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:59,590
that someday they'll study about it

1693
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:10,630
because we'll get them to do it and

1694
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:12,880
hopefully this is good well that's that

1695
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:14,800
goes into your gut but deep in it in the

1696
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,440
ileum and that's where you produce your

1697
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,330
b12 everybody's b12 deficient that's why

1698
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:21,370
I want people are like hey eww why

1699
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:23,199
you're pushing the b12 pushing the b12

1700
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:25,630
because no one has those elevated

1701
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:27,760
biotics yeah if you sprout your own

1702
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:29,679
sprouts if you like get a sprouting tray

1703
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,510
and you sprout your own sprouts you'll

1704
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:34,060
get the elevated biotic it will just

1705
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:36,250
literally be on the leaves it's coming

1706
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:39,699
from the Sun it's coming it's coming

1707
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:42,969
from the air the air literally it's like

1708
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:45,219
the it's like the Earth's ability to

1709
01:15:42,969 --> 01:15:47,140
keep us healthy that we haven't even

1710
01:15:45,219 --> 01:15:49,900
tapped into just like we haven't tapped

1711
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:51,550
into the Sun well what the Sun does for

1712
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:54,219
us we still don't even know we talking

1713
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:56,320
about Megane it's it's yeah there's so

1714
01:15:54,219 --> 01:15:57,940
much more than that and so that's what's

1715
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,040
happening with the elevator biotics it's

1716
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:01,630
it's actually in the air and it develops

1717
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,940
literally develops there's some

1718
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:05,770
connection happening around us that

1719
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:08,650
creates that micro organism especially

1720
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:10,330
in the garden especially outside so if

1721
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:12,190
you open your kitchen door

1722
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:14,530
I just in Japan you open your kitchen

1723
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:25,929
door you're letting in outside air and

1724
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:36,610
it's in the outside air you know if you

1725
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:38,440
plant an apple tree on your property if

1726
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:40,330
you if you have a lemon tree and we

1727
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,130
rinse it am I supposed to not if it's

1728
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:52,390
off your own tree you don't rinse it

1729
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:54,820
like okay dirt and you can do a really

1730
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:57,860
laughs you can you can get a light rinse

1731
01:16:54,820 --> 01:17:00,110
if you if you have you will anything

1732
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:02,030
you if it has if you know it hasn't been

1733
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:17,840
sprayed by pesticides right let's say

1734
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:20,810
that it was a fresh squirrel pee pee and

1735
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:29,950
that's what will happen but we are very

1736
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:32,870
disconnected from nature you know

1737
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:36,350
sterilized place with a wrapper well

1738
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:38,030
that squirrel pee has less anything in

1739
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:41,360
it then all the people walking around

1740
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:43,880
with all the shingles in hhv-6 is HB h7

1741
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:46,730
simplex is this that epstein-barr 64 I

1742
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:49,040
do have smart shingles that's hiria 50

1743
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:53,060
groups of strep bacteria all of it

1744
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,920
that squirrel trust me that's only you

1745
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:57,710
got to worry about restaurants bathroom

1746
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:59,480
doors bathroom toilets in the white you

1747
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:18,620
got you carry the spray I'm not worried

1748
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:21,580
about a squirrel that's a good question

1749
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:24,230
the sport listen I'm doing all this work

1750
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:25,850
it's so true it's like we worry about

1751
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:27,170
and it's good you wash things because

1752
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,910
when you go to the store seriously

1753
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:30,350
Elizabeth so important when you go to

1754
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:32,840
the store and you get things you want to

1755
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:35,270
wash them yeah so don't get me wrong

1756
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:38,150
it's yes I'm glad you in the habit you

1757
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:40,040
pump your lemon off the tree yes and you

1758
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:41,240
rinse it stay in that habit because I

1759
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,760
don't want you to not rinse a

1760
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,170
store-bought lemon yeah and and for

1761
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,730
these reasons so seriously so I don't

1762
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:48,890
want people get the wrong message the

1763
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:50,420
other thing is those elevated biotics

1764
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:52,520
they're on an apple and an apple orchard

1765
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:55,010
if you go to pick your own apples like

1766
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:58,010
once a year yeah if you get that

1767
01:18:55,010 --> 01:19:00,770
elevated biotic once a year and you it

1768
01:18:58,010 --> 01:19:05,150
goes into the ileum it stays in there

1769
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:06,800
for years but we never get it in us and

1770
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:08,330
we don't get enough of it and then we

1771
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,250
are the metals and all the other things

1772
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:11,440
we have in our body

1773
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:13,450
that knock them down right but it's the

1774
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:15,430
strongest microorganism that build your

1775
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:17,470
b12 keeps your gut healthy so you don't

1776
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:18,910
get the SIBO which is streptococcus or

1777
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:20,590
anything else but did you have to ask

1778
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:22,780
them if they spray like you have to go

1779
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:23,500
to a place where they're not on organic

1780
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,530
forms now

1781
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:29,020
yeah and a lot of there's a lot of non

1782
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:31,510
spray forms they're not organic but they

1783
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:32,650
don't spray design yeah which is fun

1784
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:34,930
like the whole farmer's market in

1785
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:37,270
California is right yes it's all like

1786
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:38,920
that hole it's hard to get certain oh

1787
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:41,260
that's hard to get certification but it

1788
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:43,200
doesn't mean that they're you know GMO

1789
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:46,230
or spraying and stuff like that I'm

1790
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,230
blown away

1791
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:55,470
powerful stories no I can I'll keep you

1793
01:19:55,470 --> 01:20:01,510

01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,830
are real experiences and you guys have

1795
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:04,690
gone through it there so what would you

1796
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:05,860
say you guys feel like saying anything

1797
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:08,590
to anybody who's struggling right now

1798
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:12,100
who's in a bed right now or they're

1799
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:13,690
there they're functioning but they know

1800
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:15,160
they're not where they need to be and

1801
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:17,920
people don't understand all their

1802
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:19,840
different symptoms or you know what

1803
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,310
they're up against if you have any if

1804
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,650
you have something to say to the women

1805
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:25,780
out there and men too and I worry about

1806
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:30,310
children yes you know I've seen

1807
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:32,350
daughters and sons at 14 15 16 years old

1808
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:34,570
and mom's just frantic because they're

1809
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:36,610
diagnosed with Lyme disease or diagnosed

1810
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:39,130
with autoimmune or a thyroid problem if

1811
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:44,920
you have any words to the moms out there

1812
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:45,760
that anything as a mom you know we you

1813
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,710
know I don't want to get into like

1814
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:49,690
gender roles there were never been a lot

1816
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:55,330

foundation and a base for nutrition and

1821
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:06,220
a lot of its based in this stuff and I

1822
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:08,380
get it in where I can you know my

1823
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:10,510

1826
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:19,000
20% and you know it's just really to

1827
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:22,220

1828
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,170
and you know cold and flu season

give her a little zinc or b12 or you

1831
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:31,250

just I wanted people that kind of like

1872
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:11,060
take ownership of their healing it

1873
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:12,860
doesn't mean that you don't have

1874
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:14,690
supporters and you don't have helpers

1875
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:17,540
you don't have like doctors and you know

1876
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:21,410
healers and friends but it's your

1877
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:23,090
journey whose your journey and when you

1878
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:26,770

1882
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:37,550
wouldn't know without you I mean you

1883
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,469
know for me I never talked about any

1884
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:41,869
kind of stuff going on whether it's the

1885
01:23:39,469 --> 01:23:44,920
fatigue or the you know just issues and

1886
01:23:41,869 --> 01:23:47,510
there's so many these days I always

1887
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,900
recommend it because I say give it a

1888
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:52,909
shot

1889
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:55,400
read it see nothing you know just for

1890
01:23:52,909 --> 01:23:57,409
anyone who's suffering also to surround

1891
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:59,690
yourself with really positive people who

1892
01:23:57,409 --> 01:24:00,560
I always ask myself like a person place

1893
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:01,790
or thing

1894
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,070
do I have a good feeling or a bad

1895
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:06,260
feeling about this person place or thing

1896
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:07,940
and it's really important on your

1897
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:09,920
healing journey to surround yourself

1898
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:11,840
with like the foods that make you feel

1899
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,480
good the people all the places the

1900
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:17,659
things that really give back to you and

1901
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:21,460
and nurture you and don't deplete even

1902
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:23,750
on the smallest levels even the smallest

1903
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:25,699
like dragging you down not making you

1904
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:28,969
feel good making you feel like no gross

1905
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:33,530

1906
01:24:28,969 --> 01:24:41,210
