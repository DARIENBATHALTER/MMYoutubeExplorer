[422.40 - 425.52] I told you guys before when I was
[424.02 - 429.26] sitting on my desk and I was taking the
[425.52 - 429.26] information from Spirit of compassion
[429.78 - 434.52] my mind was being blown
[432.18 - 436.86] every second
[434.52 - 439.98] and when I was getting the information
[436.86 - 442.32] for these brain shot therapies I was
[439.98 - 444.30] promised
[442.32 - 447.06] because I was writing the information
[444.30 - 449.28] down and what I was writing down was and
[447.06 - 452.22] this is what's incredible about this
[449.28 - 454.44] what I was writing down
[452.22 - 456.48] which was so incredible
[454.44 - 458.52] check this out
[456.48 - 462.54] I was writing down medical medium brain
[458.52 - 464.88] shot therapy offers instant relief
[462.54 - 466.26] I wrote that down
[464.88 - 468.84] right
[466.26 - 470.76] because that's what I heard
[468.84 - 474.12] and so what I said to Spirit of
[470.76 - 476.16] compassion was oh wait a minute here
[474.12 - 477.24] I know a lot of people get some instant
[476.16 - 478.74] relief
[477.24 - 480.24] pretty quickly when they're doing their
[478.74 - 482.46] celery juice which has saved a lot of
[480.24 - 484.50] lives around the world
[482.46 - 487.20] I know people have gotten relief within
[484.50 - 489.00] days of the heavy metal detox smoothie
[487.20 - 490.92] I know they've gotten relief on the
[489.00 - 492.48] monocleanse I know they've gotten relief
[490.92 - 494.94] from the medical medium tools and
[492.48 - 497.88] protocols I know they've gotten relief
[494.94 - 499.68] from the zinc shock therapy
[497.88 - 502.44] and the incredible vitamin C shock
[499.68 - 505.98] therapy instant relief
[502.44 - 507.96] I know they've gotten relief before but
[505.98 - 510.00] you're telling me these brain shot
[507.96 - 512.70] therapies are going to provide instant
[510.00 - 515.16] relief but not just instant relief on a
[512.70 - 519.12] way that was just unbelievable
[515.16 - 523.56] miraculous the ability to even
[519.12 - 525.24] push away a hundred symptoms over time
[523.56 - 526.32] so when I heard that from Spirit of
[525.24 - 529.14] compassion
[526.32 - 532.98] I had to stop myself I remember I was in
[529.14 - 536.04] mid flight of writing it down
[532.98 - 538.08] because I hand write the Books
[536.04 - 542.28] so as I'm hearing the information I'm
[538.08 - 544.62] hand so I'm I'm basically like a scribe
[542.28 - 547.98] and I'm just
[544.62 - 550.08] hearing the information right
[547.98 - 551.58] so it's the whole profit thing you're
[550.08 - 554.04] hearing the information and you're
[551.58 - 556.08] writing it down that's what it is and so
[554.04 - 557.70] I'm doing that and spirit of compassion
[556.08 - 559.26] is telling me instant relief and I'm
[557.70 - 561.90] like instant relief
[559.26 - 564.30] more and more more
[561.90 - 567.00] I have to get the chronic Leo better and
[564.30 - 568.56] what happened was
[567.00 - 571.14] I was
[568.56 - 572.40] hearing
[571.14 - 574.26] it's just profound incredible
[572.40 - 576.66] information about the brain shot therapy
[574.26 - 579.18] and I I couldn't get enough
[576.66 - 582.66] just writing it all down
[579.18 - 585.90] and I was promised
[582.66 - 587.82] that people would get that relief
[585.90 - 589.56] so I could not wait for you to have
[587.82 - 590.88] these books so it was like Christmas
[589.56 - 592.92] morning

[592.92 - 597.48] knowing you guys were gonna get

[603.32 - 607.92] for you guys to get the package of your
[606.84 - 609.96] books
[607.92 - 613.56] and for you guys to experience this
[609.96 - 613.56] profound incredible
[614.82 - 619.14] I mean
[616.80 - 621.48] can there even be words for him so we're
[619.14 - 624.24] doing the guilt and shame shifter we're
[621.48 - 626.40] day eight gilton's shame shifter
[624.24 - 629.34] now a lot of people Harbor guilt and
[626.40 - 630.78] shame deep down inside
[629.34 - 633.24] so I want to talk about the brain shot
[630.78 - 635.04] therapy for a couple of seconds right
[633.24 - 637.02] medical medium brain shot therapies
[635.04 - 638.70] Uncharted Territory now all medical
[637.02 - 640.98] medium books are they're all been
[638.70 - 644.22] Uncharted Territory right
[640.98 - 645.96] but this takes it to another level of
[644.22 - 647.54] Uncharted
[645.96 - 650.34] these are special configurations
[647.54 - 653.34] synergistically combined just right to
[650.34 - 656.60] crack the code
[653.34 - 656.60] to crack the code
[656.64 - 659.88] now you can have a Creative Juice
[658.32 - 662.84] concoction but that's not what this is
[659.88 - 666.00] this is medicinals
[662.84 - 667.14] organized in a way that only above can
[666.00 - 670.80] know
[667.14 - 673.14] to crack the code on how to rewire
[670.80 - 674.82] and reset the brain
[673.14 - 676.92] I mean when you think about that it's
[674.82 - 679.02] just like oh my God that's why these
[676.92 - 681.48] books are the best books in history
[679.02 - 683.84] hands down they're the greatest books of
[681.48 - 683.84] all time
[684.36 - 690.06] they are the greatest books of all time
[687.18 - 692.16] you can be the judge go pick yourself up
[690.06 - 694.26] some health books out there from the the
[692.16 - 696.84] best podcast doctors or whoever go pick
[694.26 - 697.98] up some books read those and then read
[696.84 - 699.60] these
[697.98 - 701.40] you'll find those are empty
[699.60 - 703.02] unfortunately and you'll find that these
[701.40 - 704.64] have so much information line for line
[703.02 - 707.22] you've never even heard or read before
[704.64 - 709.14] and your minds will be blown to such a
[707.22 - 711.60] degree it is unbelievable and it's like
[709.14 - 713.52] that with all medical medium books but
[711.60 - 716.34] the point is is these right here it's
[713.52 - 718.32] like I I don't even know what to say
[716.34 - 720.48] so these are special configurations
[718.32 - 724.50] synergistically combined just right to
[720.48 - 728.46] crack the code to reset and to rewire
[724.50 - 731.34] the brain how powerful is that
[728.46 - 733.98] these brain shots
[731.34 - 735.72] are unreal the healing shots of the
[733.98 - 738.00] medical medium brain shot therapy are
[735.72 - 739.26] tools that come from above these brain
[738.00 - 740.82] shots are composed of special
[739.26 - 743.40] combinations of ingredients working
[740.82 - 746.22] together systematically for specific
[743.40 - 747.60] reasons that only a source above can
[746.22 - 749.82] know
[747.60 - 752.16] oh my God
[749.82 - 755.04] the relationships among these
[752.16 - 757.92] ingredients right no one would ever know
[755.04 - 760.32] that guilt and shame can be vanquished
[757.92 - 762.12] just eliminated between these three
[760.32 - 765.06] ingredients
[762.12 - 766.86] Mary Lou says when will you be live on
[765.06 - 770.52] Facebook
[766.86 - 773.78] I'm live on Facebook now
[770.52 - 773.78] but unfortunately
[774.78 - 778.50] yeah
[776.40 - 781.10] I mean it's not your fault you can't see
[778.50 - 781.10] me on Facebook
[781.14 - 785.40] because you're not allowed to heal
[782.58 - 788.40] people that's why
[785.40 - 790.32] um on a level that we do with these
[788.40 - 792.30] books it's just no one's ever seen this
[790.32 - 797.34] before in history
[792.30 - 800.34] so Brett says this shot these shots are
[797.34 - 802.92] my favorite immediate uplifting shift
[800.34 - 805.02] incredible
[802.92 - 807.48] the relationships among these
[805.02 - 809.34] ingredients are intricate and unknown to
[807.48 - 810.96] anyone so that means when you stick our
[809.34 - 813.84] this is just today this shot the golden
[810.96 - 816.60] chain shifter when you stick Orange
[813.84 - 818.10] and spinach and ginger together just
[816.60 - 820.88] those three you put something else in
[818.10 - 820.88] there it doesn't work
[820.92 - 824.28] you have one of those missing it doesn't
[822.60 - 826.44] work
[824.28 - 828.30] think about that
[826.44 - 830.94] you have ginger missing it doesn't work
[828.30 - 834.06] you have orange missing it doesn't work
[830.94 - 835.80] you have spinach missing it doesn't work
[834.06 - 837.84] you have to have these three and only
[835.80 - 839.82] these three in the amount it is to in
[837.84 - 842.88] order for it to actually eliminate the
[839.82 - 845.16] guilt and shame that's deep within us
[842.88 - 847.52] to get relief instantly with guilt and
[845.16 - 847.52] shame
[848.16 - 851.58] you eat a big old chocolate cake and
[850.14 - 853.86] you've got all this guilt about it you
[851.58 - 856.38] get these three ingredients together
[853.86 - 859.88] and you juice them in the form in the
[856.38 - 859.88] way that we're talking about here
[859.92 - 863.28] you got guilt and shame deep within from
[861.84 - 865.38] something you think you did wrong in
[863.28 - 867.48] your life something he did you think
[865.38 - 870.06] that didn't go right in your life
[867.48 - 872.40] whatever it is get these three together
[870.06 - 873.78] if you have a past skeleton shame thing
[872.40 - 875.10] if you have a present guilt and shame
[873.78 - 877.44] thing
[875.10 - 880.26] get these three ingredients together in
[877.44 - 883.02] the order in the way and the amounts
[880.26 - 884.58] because no one would know ever anywhere
[883.02 - 887.28] anyhow
[884.58 - 888.90] any possibility
[887.28 - 891.18] that when you put these three together
[888.90 - 894.24] just right
[891.18 - 898.34] it gets somewhere into here
[894.24 - 898.34] it drives into the brain
[898.80 - 902.64] and you know you know where it goes
[901.02 - 904.26] I'm going to open up this brain right
[902.64 - 907.22] here this cavity
[904.26 - 907.22] create a cavity here
[907.62 - 914.04] into the emotional center of the brain
[911.22 - 915.90] so only a source above would know that
[914.04 - 918.08] when these three come together that
[915.90 - 921.06] Miracle happens
[918.08 - 923.00] where that energy from these three
[921.06 - 925.92] ingredients gets driven directly
[923.00 - 928.74] absorbed into the emotional center of
[925.92 - 931.14] the brain and unlocks
[928.74 - 933.32] a condition
[931.14 - 936.30] in order to heal
[933.32 - 940.46] rewires and resets
[936.30 - 940.46] that's how incredible this really is
[944.04 - 948.18] truly unbelievable
[945.60 - 951.72] says I just watched a retired Air Force
[948.18 - 954.30] pilot sharing about UFO their team saw
[951.72 - 956.64] in the air at night isn't it funny how
[954.30 - 961.10] after the UFO podcast Anthony shared a
[956.64 - 961.10] lot more people did the same
[961.98 - 967.40] it's very funny
[964.80 - 967.40] so
[967.62 - 972.18] yeah check out that aliens podcast when
[969.54 - 974.46] you guys get the chance

[998.58 - 1003.94] Winslow says loving the shots they are
[1001.28 - 1003.94] so powerful
[1004.58 - 1009.02] these shots are really addictive in a
[1006.74 - 1010.88] good way because they give you relief
[1009.02 - 1013.52] and they start moving the needle fast
[1010.88 - 1015.38] and they start getting what needs to be
[1013.52 - 1016.64] done quick and here's the crazy thing
[1015.38 - 1018.50] when you're doing the other medical
[1016.64 - 1019.82] medium tools and you're doing the brain
[1018.50 - 1021.74] shots
[1019.82 - 1023.30] you don't have to do the other medical
[1021.74 - 1024.74] medium tools you just do the brain shots
[1023.30 - 1026.96] you get relief but the point is when
[1024.74 - 1030.86] you're doing the medical medium tools
[1026.96 - 1034.72] and if you're even doing my God
[1030.86 - 1034.72] the shock Therapies
[1035.12 - 1040.94] not just the brain shot therapy the
[1038.18 - 1044.54] actual medical medium shock Therapies in
[1040.94 - 1047.18] here there's nine shock Therapies
[1044.54 - 1049.40] that alone is just unbelievable there's
[1047.18 - 1051.98] nothing out there like that that anybody
[1049.40 - 1054.38] could ever touch or see
[1051.98 - 1055.52] Gigi says the first one gave me instant
[1054.38 - 1057.80] relief
[1055.52 - 1060.34] from a scratchy throat and earache
[1057.80 - 1060.34] incredible
[1060.68 - 1066.68] this is what is needed
[1063.32 - 1068.84] is this type of information for what
[1066.68 - 1072.28] we're up against today
[1068.84 - 1072.28] to get that instant relief
[1072.56 - 1078.14] good morning Margaret instant relief the
[1076.34 - 1081.76] power to that
[1078.14 - 1081.76] is just absolutely incredible
[1082.22 - 1086.42] Gigi says the first one gave me instant
[1084.26 - 1087.74] relief to scratchy throat okay I read
[1086.42 - 1089.30] that one and still they're still coming
[1087.74 - 1090.62] up
[1089.30 - 1092.42] when you think about it and that's
[1090.62 - 1095.26] incredible by the way
[1092.42 - 1095.26] really is
[1095.90 - 1101.06] Jay Moore says all your information got
[1098.60 - 1104.48] rid of my horrendous migraine
[1101.06 - 1105.26] where I projectile vomit the pain was so
[1104.48 - 1107.72] bad
[1105.26 - 1109.40] I am free of migraines this past four
[1107.72 - 1111.02] years
[1109.40 - 1112.70] I mean when you think about that you're
[1111.02 - 1115.64] free of the migraines for the past four
[1112.70 - 1118.76] years what does that mean
[1115.64 - 1121.04] to someone who suffers from a migraine
[1118.76 - 1123.14] condition that means
[1121.04 - 1124.88] that means freedom
[1123.14 - 1128.24] freedom is critical and that's what
[1124.88 - 1131.30] these books are they are freedom
[1128.24 - 1133.10] the greatest books of all time provide
[1131.30 - 1135.68] freedom
[1133.10 - 1137.36] and there's so much to be said about
[1135.68 - 1139.16] that
[1137.36 - 1140.36] what's incredible you guys and I was
[1139.16 - 1142.28] thinking about this this morning I woke
[1140.36 - 1144.14] up five o'clock this morning and what I
[1142.28 - 1146.66] was thinking about was
[1144.14 - 1147.86] if even one podcast doctor or one Health
[1146.66 - 1151.78] Guru
[1147.86 - 1151.78] had even a fraction of this information
[1152.96 - 1156.32] they would probably withhold it and make
[1155.06 - 1159.08] sure they would charge thousands of
[1156.32 - 1161.00] dollars for you to access it a fraction
[1159.08 - 1162.56] of this information it's really
[1161.00 - 1164.30] unbelievable but they don't even have a
[1162.56 - 1166.94] fraction of it anyway
[1164.30 - 1169.22] unless they poach it later which many do
[1166.94 - 1171.68] Susan says I want to do the nerve
[1169.22 - 1174.20] shifter shot again today wow
[1171.68 - 1176.06] it was my favorite so far it gave me a
[1174.20 - 1177.44] sense of clarity and energy that's
[1176.06 - 1179.42] incredible
[1177.44 - 1182.12] of course you can do that one again
[1179.42 - 1184.10] Nicole says I slept super good for the
[1182.12 - 1185.90] third night after the shots I was
[1184.10 - 1187.28] struggling to even get five hours of
[1185.90 - 1188.84] sleep before this now here's how it
[1187.28 - 1192.56] works
[1188.84 - 1194.42] a lot of the like the adrenal right
[1192.56 - 1196.70] the adrenal um
[1194.42 - 1198.02] I mean like there's okay first of all I
[1196.70 - 1200.54] wish you wanted to say wait another one
[1198.02 - 1202.70] too Lake says my teen daughter is being
[1200.54 - 1206.56] transformed before my very eyes with
[1202.70 - 1206.56] these shots I can't believe it
[1207.38 - 1211.78] that means everything
[1213.56 - 1219.14] Jen says oh boy the shot therapies are
[1215.90 - 1220.82] so very powerful loving the results
[1219.14 - 1222.32] results matter
[1220.82 - 1224.48] they matter when it comes down to
[1222.32 - 1227.42] chronic illness

[1261.50 - 1264.80] symptoms conditions in the book and
[1263.06 - 1266.72] protocols powerful protocols there's

[1280.40 - 1284.24] it's critical I'm just letting you know
[1282.80 - 1286.58] right there
[1284.24 - 1288.56] I talk about you know how I fully
[1286.58 - 1291.14] endorsed the vemergy company
[1288.56 - 1293.54] fully endorse them because of the four
[1291.14 - 1295.04] incredible things that they offer and do
[1293.54 - 1297.68] that no supplement companies in my
[1295.04 - 1299.24] opinion ever touched upon or do which is
[1297.68 - 1303.14] mind-blowing
[1299.24 - 1305.84] so check out uh you know my website
[1303.14 - 1308.12] medical medium.com supplements directory
[1305.84 - 1310.16] so if you're embarking into the
[1308.12 - 1311.78] supplement world and you're thinking
[1310.16 - 1313.58] about like medical means shock therapies
[1311.78 - 1315.92] the problem is
[1313.58 - 1318.50] if you use the wrong stuff
[1315.92 - 1320.84] it's just their lack of results occur
[1318.50 - 1323.18] that's one thing that could happen if
[1320.84 - 1325.46] you use the wrong stuff it's also just
[1323.18 - 1327.32] other problems too because
[1325.46 - 1329.60] there's a lot of junky stuff out there
[1327.32 - 1332.06] going to that another day
[1329.60 - 1334.16] but the information in this book and the
[1332.06 - 1335.90] amount of protocols and the amount of
[1334.16 - 1338.00] conditions and symptoms neurologically
[1335.90 - 1340.22] is just through the roof including the
[1338.00 - 1341.72] recipes and the brain shot therapy we're
[1340.22 - 1343.88] doing we're day a of the brain shot
[1341.72 - 1346.06] therapy cleanse and we're on the entry
[1343.88 - 1346.06] level
[1346.40 - 1353.72] mystery chronic guilt here we are
[1349.58 - 1356.96] in the emotional centers of the brain
[1353.72 - 1361.12] certain areas of nerve tissue are partly
[1356.96 - 1361.12] responsible for the way we feel
[1362.18 - 1367.46] it's not only the tissue itself
[1365.90 - 1370.16] this is incredible
[1367.46 - 1374.02] the brain's emotional centers are
[1370.16 - 1374.02] intertwined greatly with our soul
[1375.14 - 1377.78] and the science of research doesn't know
[1376.76 - 1380.72] that
[1377.78 - 1385.28] Neuroscience a brain hack
[1380.72 - 1387.38] nobody they don't know that literally
[1385.28 - 1389.68] that in the emotional centers of the
[1387.38 - 1389.68] brain
[1390.02 - 1394.76] it's not just the brain tissue but in
[1392.96 - 1396.98] the emotional center of the centers of
[1394.76 - 1400.40] the brain it's the brain tissue being
[1396.98 - 1402.68] intertwined with our soul
[1400.40 - 1404.72] if someone feels guilty for something
[1402.68 - 1406.58] they've done
[1404.72 - 1409.58] and that's appropriate for the
[1406.58 - 1412.88] circumstance the soul is tied into this
[1409.58 - 1414.92] emotional response in the brain
[1412.88 - 1417.02] that that's mind-blowing information by
[1414.92 - 1420.40] the way
[1417.02 - 1420.40] when you even think about that
[1420.62 - 1426.62] if someone never feels guilty even when
[1424.10 - 1428.72] they should when it would help them
[1426.62 - 1431.90] learn and grow and give others
[1428.72 - 1434.84] resolution right
[1431.90 - 1437.66] there's a disconnect
[1434.84 - 1439.46] for one there's a disconnect between the
[1437.66 - 1442.52] soul and the brain's emotional centers
[1439.46 - 1444.26] so if someone does something terrible to
[1442.52 - 1446.06] somebody and they don't feel guilty
[1444.26 - 1449.74] there's a disconnect between their soul
[1446.06 - 1449.74] and the emotional center of the brain
[1451.16 - 1456.98] I want to read something really quick
[1453.98 - 1456.98] quote
[1458.72 - 1462.02] right here in the brain saver book
[1460.34 - 1463.64] because it reminds me of what we're
[1462.02 - 1466.34] looking at now
[1463.64 - 1467.06] we all know there are bad people in the
[1466.34 - 1469.88] world
[1467.06 - 1473.24] and these people have no interest in
[1469.88 - 1476.90] protecting us or our brains
[1473.24 - 1480.08] only a great agenda to find ways to hurt
[1476.90 - 1483.38] us and our brains
[1480.08 - 1485.84] we deserve to be wise to this so we can
[1483.38 - 1488.02] look out for ourselves and the ones we
[1485.84 - 1488.02] love
[1488.56 - 1492.98] bad people in the world and they don't
[1490.94 - 1494.06] feel guilty for what they do and what
[1492.98 - 1496.64] they've done
[1494.06 - 1497.90] because there's a disconnect between
[1496.64 - 1501.94] their soul
[1497.90 - 1501.94] and the emotional centers of the brain
[1505.58 - 1510.08] if if someone never feels guilty when
[1508.28 - 1514.18] they should
[1510.08 - 1514.18] when it would help them learn and grow
[1514.82 - 1519.68] and give others resolution
[1518.06 - 1523.54] if you feel guilty about something bad
[1519.68 - 1523.54] that happened it gives others resolution
[1523.64 - 1526.76] there's a disconnect if they don't have
[1525.56 - 1528.26] that for one there's a disconnect
[1526.76 - 1530.66] between the soul and the brain's
[1528.26 - 1534.22] emotional centers the soul has pushed
[1530.66 - 1534.22] away from the brain
[1534.80 - 1539.30] you don't have to be a terrible person
[1537.26 - 1541.58] doing bad things though for that to
[1539.30 - 1543.44] happen so that's important to know there
[1541.58 - 1547.16] are bad people in the world where
[1543.44 - 1549.62] they'll never be resolution for anyone
[1547.16 - 1553.00] but you can also be so injured where you
[1549.62 - 1553.00] don't feel guilty about something
[1553.88 - 1558.44] because you're so injured and your soul
[1556.58 - 1560.18] is pushed away from the brain for
[1558.44 - 1561.86] another there's usually been some sort
[1560.18 - 1563.12] of toxic exposure in the emotional
[1561.86 - 1564.74] centers of the brain causing a
[1563.12 - 1566.90] disconnect and electrical signal so that
[1564.74 - 1568.52] can happen we can get sick we can
[1566.90 - 1570.14] actually have toxic heavy metals inside
[1568.52 - 1572.18] the brain we can have some kind of
[1570.14 - 1573.68] poison or toxin that's actually
[1572.18 - 1577.16] interfering with the Soul's connection
[1573.68 - 1579.20] to the emotional center of the brain
[1577.16 - 1581.12] when toxic heavy metals such as mercury
[1579.20 - 1583.16] and aluminum take up residence there it
[1581.12 - 1585.50] can interfere with the empathy sympathy
[1583.16 - 1590.44] compassion and guilt that are supposed
[1585.50 - 1590.44] to arise upon causing harm to others
[1590.72 - 1595.70] it can mean that someone never
[1592.64 - 1597.62] apologizes for what they've done
[1595.70 - 1599.54] Cody says I've been praying for
[1597.62 - 1601.64] something like this
[1599.54 - 1603.32] I've tried techniques for rewiring the
[1601.64 - 1605.36] brain my brain
[1603.32 - 1606.68] but I'd get so mad at myself for not
[1605.36 - 1608.96] changing
[1606.68 - 1610.82] but I'm seeing changes already from
[1608.96 - 1612.20] these shots it's amazing and Cody you're
[1610.82 - 1613.76] also going to see changes when you read
[1612.20 - 1615.50] the information in these books because I
[1613.76 - 1617.54] talk about that
[1615.50 - 1620.42] I talk about that the brain hacks out
[1617.54 - 1622.82] there for rewiring they don't make us
[1620.42 - 1624.26] feel good about ourselves because the
[1622.82 - 1626.66] brain hacks and the people that create
[1624.26 - 1628.58] them don't know how our body and brain
[1626.66 - 1630.76] even works so all these mistakes are
[1628.58 - 1630.76] made
[1635.00 - 1640.10] incredible Adam says the nerve shifter
[1637.64 - 1643.22] made the pain from my neck and shoulder
[1640.10 - 1646.34] injuries so much better God bless
[1643.22 - 1648.26] that's amazing and you can continue
[1646.34 - 1650.30] if your doctor's happy that you're over
[1648.26 - 1652.22] there on YouTube amazing ask your doctor
[1650.30 - 1654.02] what's right for you guys if if any of
[1652.22 - 1655.70] you are concerned too you could always
[1654.02 - 1658.90] be like I'll take these brain saver
[1655.70 - 1658.90] books to the doctor's office
[1663.20 - 1667.10] that's because heavy metals can derail
[1665.18 - 1668.84] electrical impulses heavy metals have a
[1667.10 - 1672.50] lot to do
[1668.84 - 1676.18] with our ability not to actually have a
[1672.50 - 1676.18] connection to get that disconnect
[1676.52 - 1681.92] the soul connects to nerve tissue inside
[1679.46 - 1685.70] the brain it's part of the brain that
[1681.92 - 1688.76] allows someone to have a heart so
[1685.70 - 1691.48] metals can interfere with our soul and
[1688.76 - 1691.48] our brain's connection
[1692.54 - 1696.14] what about when someone's guilt is
[1694.16 - 1697.34] overactive I want to talk about this
[1696.14 - 1698.96] next part you guys it's really
[1697.34 - 1701.18] interesting
[1698.96 - 1703.46] since drinking these shots Atlanta says
[1701.18 - 1706.34] since drinking these shots I've been so
[1703.46 - 1708.26] relaxed I never remember ever being so
[1706.34 - 1709.94] relaxed and I'm sleeping so deeply I
[1708.26 - 1711.32] want you guys to know sleep can get a
[1709.94 - 1713.00] lot better when you're doing these brain
[1711.32 - 1714.80] shot Therapies
[1713.00 - 1716.42] because that's how much healing is
[1714.80 - 1717.92] happening inside the brain because it's
[1716.42 - 1720.98] actually going directly to the brain
[1717.92 - 1723.02] fast getting there resetting rewiring
[1720.98 - 1725.92] and so healing is going to happen on all
[1723.02 - 1725.92] kinds of different levels
[1727.58 - 1735.44] I mean I waited all year or more
[1731.66 - 1737.66] so you guys can have this information
[1735.44 - 1739.70] countless hours to make sure these books
[1737.66 - 1741.80] got into your hands I can't even I don't
[1739.70 - 1744.98] even know what to say it was worth the
[1741.80 - 1749.62] sacrifice every last bit of it so that
[1744.98 - 1749.62] you guys had answers and tools
[1750.14 - 1754.40] what about when someone's guilt is
[1752.18 - 1756.08] overactive when toxic heavy metals
[1754.40 - 1757.64] saturate a different area of the brain's
[1756.08 - 1759.32] emotional centers they can cause
[1757.64 - 1761.66] electrical impulses to Surge into
[1759.32 - 1764.12] adjacent tissue and if that's the area
[1761.66 - 1765.80] that governs guilt it heightens guilty
[1764.12 - 1767.60] feelings so what happens you guys when
[1765.80 - 1769.28] we have toxins inside the brain like
[1767.60 - 1771.50] toxic heavy metals and it's in the
[1769.28 - 1773.42] emotional centers of the brain it can
[1771.50 - 1774.98] make somebody overactive with a lot of
[1773.42 - 1776.96] guilt
[1774.98 - 1778.70] so what I love about the guilt and shame
[1776.96 - 1780.86] shifter it's hitting directly to the
[1778.70 - 1782.78] emotional center of the brain
[1780.86 - 1784.34] basically what I'm trying to tell you
[1782.78 - 1786.44] and I'm giving you this really Advanced
[1784.34 - 1789.44] information over here
[1786.44 - 1791.00] is that for whatever reason why and how
[1789.44 - 1792.70] we're experiencing guilt and shame
[1791.00 - 1795.38] whether it's something that happened
[1792.70 - 1797.84] that's justifiable
[1795.38 - 1799.76] and how we feel or we don't know why
[1797.84 - 1801.56] we're feeling this or it's something
[1799.76 - 1803.60] that happened 10 years ago in our life
[1801.56 - 1806.00] 15 years ago in her life 20 years ago
[1803.60 - 1807.74] five years whatever it is and we feel
[1806.00 - 1809.78] this and it creeps up and we have this
[1807.74 - 1812.18] guilt about something or we have this
[1809.78 - 1814.82] feeling of Shame about something the
[1812.18 - 1817.04] guilt and shame shifter can help rewire
[1814.82 - 1819.94] and shift and change that that's how
[1817.04 - 1819.94] incredible this is
[1823.22 - 1830.00] Annette says I am still so surprised I
[1827.60 - 1832.76] have been trying various shots since a
[1830.00 - 1834.74] few days and today I tried the OCD shot
[1832.76 - 1836.42] I got a smile on my face because I know
[1834.74 - 1838.28] you're gonna it's gonna surprise a lot
[1836.42 - 1840.02] of people because they're just they're
[1838.28 - 1842.08] gonna get the results and it was the
[1840.02 - 1845.18] first time that I could eat my supper
[1842.08 - 1847.04] whoa including some cooked peas and
[1845.18 - 1849.92] sweet potatoes sounds yummy actually
[1847.04 - 1852.98] without feeling that I want to overeat
[1849.92 - 1855.14] and without guilt that it was not all
[1852.98 - 1857.72] raw that's amazing I usually only
[1855.14 - 1860.06] include cooked on the weekends and my
[1857.72 - 1862.64] digestion is better than ever I'm still
[1860.06 - 1864.68] in awe and so so thankful that's
[1862.64 - 1867.68] incredible
[1864.68 - 1870.50] that's incredible
[1867.68 - 1873.02] marjorie's uh Marjorie says overly
[1870.50 - 1875.84] emotional does this mean what does this
[1873.02 - 1878.48] mean the books go into great depth about
[1875.84 - 1880.76] that there's an emotional brain chapter
[1878.48 - 1882.20] that goes into depth I'm not even in the
[1880.76 - 1884.92] emotional brain chapter I mean that's
[1882.20 - 1887.78] how much information is is actually
[1884.92 - 1890.36] placed around the books
[1887.78 - 1892.64] Jenny Jenn says I'm having a medical
[1890.36 - 1895.52] procedure next week for a car accident
[1892.64 - 1897.20] and I'm so comforted to know that the
[1895.52 - 1899.84] information in these books will be there
[1897.20 - 1903.02] for me to cleanse after the medical
[1899.84 - 1905.66] procedure that's so incredible I'm so

[1905.66 - 1909.62] that's what I wanted

[1912.02 - 1916.76] incredible one and it helps me tell

[1919.64 - 1924.74] awkward and then bad I didn't do more or
[1923.06 - 1925.82] feel bad that you didn't do more and not
[1924.74 - 1927.20] anymore
[1925.82 - 1930.68] amazing
[1927.20 - 1932.30] this is incredible you guys seriously
[1930.68 - 1934.88] Josh
[1932.30 - 1936.62] the wisdom shot drastically enhanced my
[1934.88 - 1939.74] Consciousness and intuition I love the
[1936.62 - 1942.52] wisdom shot I use that one periodically
[1939.74 - 1942.52] as well
[1942.98 - 1948.38] I need all the wisdom I can get I
[1946.28 - 1950.96] receive the information I put the
[1948.38 - 1952.88] information in the books
[1950.96 - 1956.48] that's what I do but I always told you
[1952.88 - 1958.40] guys I'm not a smart guy I'm just a very
[1956.48 - 1961.40] good listener it's one of the abilities
[1958.40 - 1964.64] I have and I also have another ability
[1961.40 - 1966.32] to hear the voice since age four
[1964.64 - 1969.32] and hang in there
[1966.32 - 1971.24] for the ride because it's been brutal I
[1969.32 - 1973.34] have that other ability
[1971.24 - 1975.50] a certain level of
[1973.34 - 1978.32] I guess
[1975.50 - 1980.72] certain level of strength I don't know
[1978.32 - 1983.12] what someone would call it
[1980.72 - 1985.16] So reading through the comments
[1983.12 - 1988.72] also going through here
[1985.16 - 1988.72] okay so this is interesting
[1991.58 - 1995.84] the littlest thing someone does like
[1994.28 - 1997.22] borrowing a penny from the penny dish
[1995.84 - 1998.66] did you ever do that borrow Penny from
[1997.22 - 2000.88] the penny dish and
[1998.66 - 2002.32] in the store the grocery store there's a
[2000.88 - 2004.66] little pile of pennies there and you go
[2002.32 - 2007.00] and grab one you're like here you go
[2004.66 - 2008.86] grab two pennies here you go
[2007.00 - 2010.90] the littlest thing someone does like
[2008.86 - 2013.24] borrowing a penny from the penny dish at
[2010.90 - 2015.52] a convenience store can fill them with
[2013.24 - 2018.64] regret I've seen that happen the
[2015.52 - 2020.68] emotional center of the brain
[2018.64 - 2022.36] you know needs to be rewired because
[2020.68 - 2024.64] they have that much regret because they
[2022.36 - 2026.62] actually I've seen that actually
[2024.64 - 2028.06] for someone feels guilty and they took
[2026.62 - 2030.10] three pennies out of the penny jar and
[2028.06 - 2031.90] they put three pennies down getting so
[2030.10 - 2034.24] busy one day that they aren't able to
[2031.90 - 2035.98] call back a friend even if that friend
[2034.24 - 2037.54] would completely understand can make
[2035.98 - 2039.64] someone feel terribly guilty like you
[2037.54 - 2041.32] got so busy you can't call back that
[2039.64 - 2042.94] friend or call back that family member
[2041.32 - 2044.38] and you just feel the guilt it's just
[2042.94 - 2046.72] hanging over you
[2044.38 - 2048.34] to the point where it hurts
[2046.72 - 2049.96] and they're saddened and depressed like
[2048.34 - 2051.52] they get depressed over it like the day
[2049.96 - 2053.02] ended and you couldn't get back to
[2051.52 - 2054.88] someone
[2053.02 - 2058.30] then when something happens where guilt
[2054.88 - 2060.22] is is the appropriate response if that
[2058.30 - 2061.84] person makes a particular mistake their
[2060.22 - 2063.46] attempts to learn from it can be
[2061.84 - 2065.26] heightened to the point of obsession or
[2063.46 - 2069.16] danger where you make a mistake and you
[2065.26 - 2071.08] hate yourself you hate your guts over it
[2069.16 - 2072.82] which is really horrible
[2071.08 - 2074.68] that someone feels that way where you
[2072.82 - 2076.78] make a mistake and you hate your own
[2074.68 - 2079.06] guts like you hate yourself over it
[2076.78 - 2081.30] that's brutal so many people go through
[2079.06 - 2081.30] that
[2081.70 - 2085.20] that's really hard
[2086.38 - 2089.62] even approaching harming themselves in
[2088.42 - 2091.36] some cases where you want to harm
[2089.62 - 2093.46] yourself because you feel so guilty
[2091.36 - 2095.20] about some things that's when the guilt
[2093.46 - 2097.30] and shame shifter have to come in we
[2095.20 - 2099.28] need that relief fast because there's
[2097.30 - 2101.92] people out there and I feel so bad for
[2099.28 - 2103.96] them for some of the for some simple
[2101.92 - 2106.18] things too they'll hate themselves so
[2103.96 - 2107.62] much they'll have so much guilt
[2106.18 - 2108.88] or if something happened in their life
[2107.62 - 2110.20] they'll have so much guilt where they
[2108.88 - 2111.76] want to harm themselves because they
[2110.20 - 2112.84] hate themselves that much it's so
[2111.76 - 2117.16] terrible
[2112.84 - 2119.38] we have to not let that happen to people
[2117.16 - 2122.50] Maria says the adrenal shot was my
[2119.38 - 2125.10] favorite the adrenal the adrenal shot is
[2122.50 - 2125.10] one of my favorite
[2125.68 - 2132.28] so far wow I was suddenly so calm yes
[2129.88 - 2136.54] that's what happens with the adrenal
[2132.28 - 2139.66] shot the fight or flight amazing
[2136.54 - 2143.20] I was suddenly so calm and I was not
[2139.66 - 2144.52] into my natural angry mode wow
[2143.20 - 2148.66] mind-blowing
[2144.52 - 2150.40] incredible Marie I I wish the greatest
[2148.66 - 2152.86] and the best
[2150.40 - 2154.66] for you with that because it's so
[2152.86 - 2157.06] incredible when you get that relief I
[2154.66 - 2159.70] want you to have that relief
[2157.06 - 2161.62] if you have to rely on that shot as
[2159.70 - 2164.14] you're healing to rewire and heal and
[2161.62 - 2167.56] reset please do
[2164.14 - 2170.74] KP tree says yesterday shot changed my
[2167.56 - 2173.50] day turned it into it turned it all
[2170.74 - 2176.28] around I was so happy afterwards
[2173.50 - 2176.28] incredible
[2177.70 - 2182.68] if that person's soul is injured from
[2181.00 - 2185.52] abuse so say there's somebody that
[2182.68 - 2188.80] they're injured from abuse right
[2185.52 - 2190.66] hardships betrayal or trust breakage so
[2188.80 - 2193.30] they're they're injured from trust
[2190.66 - 2195.64] breakage hardships they're injured from
[2193.30 - 2197.74] abuse of some kind
[2195.64 - 2201.42] it can compound the situation and make
[2197.74 - 2201.42] the guilt reaction worse
[2201.64 - 2205.78] or the reaction can go the opposite
[2204.22 - 2207.58] direction where the anger numbness
[2205.78 - 2209.32] settle in and displace all feelings that
[2207.58 - 2210.76] go completely until the numbness and
[2209.32 - 2212.26] anger wear off and then the guilt
[2210.76 - 2214.78] returns and that person just hates
[2212.26 - 2216.58] themselves and that's sad we don't want
[2214.78 - 2219.52] that we don't want people experiencing
[2216.58 - 2221.02] that the guilt and shame shifter is one
[2219.52 - 2223.12] of the medical medium tools now
[2221.02 - 2225.10] available to actually help somebody
[2223.12 - 2228.22] shift out of this because you can go
[2225.10 - 2230.92] down a rabbit hole of guilt a rabbit
[2228.22 - 2234.40] hole of Shame
[2230.92 - 2236.98] it's terrifying when you think about it
[2234.40 - 2240.22] and to actually be able to fix that for
[2236.98 - 2243.78] someone to turn that around is is short
[2240.22 - 2243.78] I mean as a miracle
[2246.82 - 2251.32] so I'm in the brain saver books you guys

[2391.00 - 2396.16] many different directions it's easy to
[2392.92 - 2398.62] get confused or stuck in a pattern
[2396.16 - 2400.78] that is not helpful for the healing
[2398.62 - 2402.58] process so when we get the guilt and
[2400.78 - 2404.44] shame and it takes over and it becomes
[2402.58 - 2408.04] like a
[2404.44 - 2409.12] like Madness really because it's such a
[2408.04 - 2410.98] Feeling
[2409.12 - 2413.14] I had one person describe it to me years
[2410.98 - 2415.78] ago where it felt like just someone was
[2413.14 - 2418.18] just taking over them
[2415.78 - 2420.16] the guilt and shame could not just leave
[2418.18 - 2422.56] it just could they could not get it away
[2420.16 - 2424.48] from them or out of them
[2422.56 - 2427.12] these brain shots are designed to help
[2424.48 - 2429.82] shift our Direction fast
[2427.12 - 2431.56] so our body can shift and heal and our
[2429.82 - 2433.30] emotional frame of mind can break a
[2431.56 - 2436.18] pattern
[2433.30 - 2438.34] or confinement that the complications of
[2436.18 - 2440.92] this world has created so if we're like
[2438.34 - 2442.72] confined and stuck in this pattern and
[2440.92 - 2444.46] not able to break it we need that
[2442.72 - 2445.90] shifter and that's what these are
[2444.46 - 2447.94] shifter shots
[2445.90 - 2449.86] there's ten shifter shots we're doing

[2539.44 - 2543.64] the comments are this small on the
[2542.20 - 2545.32] screen
[2543.64 - 2548.70] but that's incredible
[2545.32 - 2548.70] that's absolutely incredible
[2548.98 - 2552.88] seriously I mean that that is just
[2551.50 - 2554.86] amazing
[2552.88 - 2557.74] I'm just so proud of you guys but just
[2554.86 - 2559.96] know that I'm proud of you George says I
[2557.74 - 2564.28] love this book I learned so much and I'm
[2559.96 - 2568.24] only page 92. there's two books so you
[2564.28 - 2569.92] got 1200 plus Pages coming your way so
[2568.24 - 2575.20] let me just think here you're page 92
[2569.92 - 2578.20] you got 1100 Pages coming your way
[2575.20 - 2582.28] incredible when I think about it
[2578.20 - 2583.60] now ready there's six books per book you
[2582.28 - 2586.18] got to think about it that way because
[2583.60 - 2589.96] that's what it is like one book two
[2586.18 - 2591.88] books three books four books five books
[2589.96 - 2595.18] six books
[2591.88 - 2596.44] there's six books in each book
[2595.18 - 2599.92] yes
[2596.44 - 2604.00] there were many times when I was working
[2599.92 - 2608.32] 22 hour days 20 I did a 24-hour day
[2604.00 - 2610.60] which was stupid of me but which was
[2608.32 - 2611.92] definitely reckless in my opinion but I
[2610.60 - 2613.12] knew the deadlines were coming and I
[2611.92 - 2614.56] knew I had to make sure I get this
[2613.12 - 2618.46] information out there
[2614.56 - 2620.62] media mediate says our medial says I
[2618.46 - 2621.64] feel so calm after the energy shifter
[2620.62 - 2624.40] shots
[2621.64 - 2625.90] think they changed my personality what
[2624.40 - 2626.86] they're doing is let's talk about that a
[2625.90 - 2628.96] little bit
[2626.86 - 2630.04] like if you're doing the energy shifter
[2628.96 - 2632.74] shot
[2630.04 - 2637.12] or the obsessive thoughts shifter shot
[2632.74 - 2640.06] or your guilt and shame shifter shot or
[2637.12 - 2641.92] a stabilizer or any of them what's
[2640.06 - 2644.20] happening is they're going into the
[2641.92 - 2646.18] emotional centers of the brain but only
[2644.20 - 2648.16] a source from above would know the
[2646.18 - 2651.04] combination in order to make that happen
[2648.16 - 2654.10] it cannot happen if you just do some
[2651.04 - 2655.96] juicing it will not happen now straight
[2654.10 - 2658.90] celery juice is an incredible Miracle
[2655.96 - 2660.52] tool it is for doing all the things I've
[2658.90 - 2663.52] talked about in the books
[2660.52 - 2665.02] but the brain shots or are another tool
[2663.52 - 2667.30] from above
[2665.02 - 2670.30] so what we're essentially doing is we're
[2667.30 - 2672.22] bringing in more tools that are just so
[2670.30 - 2673.96] profound and when you even put some of
[2672.22 - 2676.66] these together these tools just forget
[2673.96 - 2678.22] it you're moving forward you get out of
[2676.66 - 2679.72] bed you get out of wheelchairs you get
[2678.22 - 2683.38] you get moving through your you know you
[2679.72 - 2686.14] get moving you heal you you grow you
[2683.38 - 2687.46] move forward it's just miraculous and
[2686.14 - 2689.80] amazing
[2687.46 - 2692.76] but what happens is
[2689.80 - 2696.04] this is absorbing really quick instantly
[2692.76 - 2698.38] instantly going to the brain boom but
[2696.04 - 2700.66] it's not just the absorption factor that
[2698.38 - 2702.40] happens it's knowing that if you put
[2700.66 - 2704.56] these three together there's a quick
[2702.40 - 2706.06] absorption rate but it's not just that
[2704.56 - 2708.40] there's something in these three
[2706.06 - 2710.62] ingredients that actually does something
[2708.40 - 2711.88] to certain groups of neurons that no one
[2710.62 - 2713.80] would ever know and science can never
[2711.88 - 2716.14] figure out
[2713.80 - 2721.12] so too says
[2716.14 - 2725.08] Anthony a new study about EBV causing me
[2721.12 - 2727.36] long covet in Sweden really because they
[2725.08 - 2729.88] got it from medical medium
[2727.36 - 2732.40] and it was published first
[2729.88 - 2735.18] medical media where are you where's
[2732.40 - 2735.18] medical medium
[2735.34 - 2738.28] so
[2736.54 - 2740.02] what happens is when they say that
[2738.28 - 2742.18] there's a new study what they're not
[2740.02 - 2743.26] telling you situ is what they're not
[2742.18 - 2746.44] telling you
[2743.26 - 2748.24] is that they took it from a New York
[2746.44 - 2750.40] Times best-selling book in a number one
[2748.24 - 2753.10] New York Times best-selling author and
[2750.40 - 2755.50] they're not giving me credit because the
[2753.10 - 2758.20] information is too mind-blowing and too
[2755.50 - 2759.58] incredible already published first and
[2758.20 - 2762.00] so what they're doing is they're
[2759.58 - 2764.58] illegally
[2762.00 - 2767.92] plagiarizing or taking that information
[2764.58 - 2769.48] trying to get the gold star put on them
[2767.92 - 2771.64] whatever
[2769.48 - 2773.20] about their Discovery and they're not
[2771.64 - 2775.66] saying that it was already published
[2773.20 - 2777.58] first discovered already done
[2775.66 - 2779.14] and put out there
[2777.58 - 2785.28] so
[2779.14 - 2785.28] do you call that evil oh yeah
[2787.48 - 2792.28] Selena says I'm I'm in such a good mood
[2790.24 - 2795.04] since doing the brain shots thank you so
[2792.28 - 2798.04] much aw and SOC the info in the books
[2795.04 - 2800.38] blows my mind I studied psychology and
[2798.04 - 2803.62] medical medium info is way ahead

[2817.60 - 2821.20] done and figured out by medical medium
[2819.34 - 2823.90] published already before or spoke about
[2821.20 - 2824.86] in lectures or podcasts I already put it
[2823.90 - 2827.26] out there

[2985.18 - 2988.54] stuff right after you send your shot
[2986.62 - 2989.59] down so don't send your shot down

[3116.82 - 3121.08] chronic illness like you experience
[3118.86 - 3123.54] insecurity like you feel insecure for
[3121.08 - 3125.10] being chronically sick that's a time to
[3123.54 - 3127.32] use the golden shame shifter too when it
[3125.10 - 3128.64] hits you like waves of it so here you
[3127.32 - 3129.96] are you've been sick for a while for a
[3128.64 - 3131.82] couple years and all of a sudden you get
[3129.96 - 3134.16] a wave of it like I feel like insecure
[3131.82 - 3135.36] about being sick I feel like I don't
[3134.16 - 3137.34] feel good about it I don't feel
[3135.36 - 3141.20] confident about it that's a great time
[3137.34 - 3141.20] to use the guilt and shame shifter
[3142.74 - 3148.26] you're feeling less than or like you are
[3145.80 - 3150.06] not good enough that's a good time to
[3148.26 - 3152.04] actually use the guilt and shame shifter
[3150.06 - 3153.48] where you don't feel good enough you
[3152.04 - 3155.88] feel less than
[3153.48 - 3157.74] I think I'm going to take the guilt and
[3155.88 - 3160.50] shame shifter for that reason for myself
[3157.74 - 3162.12] personally because I feel less than many
[3160.50 - 3164.22] times and I feel like I'm not good
[3162.12 - 3165.96] enough so I will be definitely taking
[3164.22 - 3168.00] that shot shifter
[3165.96 - 3170.28] Terry Appleman I'm still amazed that
[3168.00 - 3172.44] none of the shots have made me nauseous
[3170.28 - 3174.90] with how sensitive my stomach is oh my
[3172.44 - 3179.72] God that's incredible
[3174.90 - 3179.72] that's amazing I'm so proud of you Tara
[3179.94 - 3187.44] so here's one here so Debbie P says to
[3182.58 - 3190.88] hell with alcoholic shots these are way
[3187.44 - 3190.88] better explanation point
[3191.40 - 3195.96] way better 10 explanation points now you
[3194.28 - 3198.50] only did one explanation point but I'll
[3195.96 - 3198.50] put 10 more
[3199.32 - 3202.74] okay
[3200.76 - 3203.88] here's one right here what do you think
[3202.74 - 3206.10] about this one
[3203.88 - 3208.80] is is this a good reason to use it
[3206.10 - 3211.80] you can't forgive yourself
[3208.80 - 3213.42] for something you may believe was your
[3211.80 - 3216.06] fault
[3213.42 - 3218.22] take the guilt and shame shifter if that
[3216.06 - 3220.32] happens
[3218.22 - 3222.42] he showed his healing if someone has
[3220.32 - 3224.88] super inflamed nerves in their stomach
[3222.42 - 3227.58] and can't swallow many of the
[3224.88 - 3230.76] ingredients could they just hold the
[3227.58 - 3234.32] shot in their mouth for the result since
[3230.76 - 3234.32] it absorbs in the mouth yes
[3236.16 - 3240.78] okay so you can't forgive yourself for
[3239.70 - 3243.12] someone
[3240.78 - 3244.38] sure you can't for something you think
[3243.12 - 3246.12] you did wrong
[3244.38 - 3247.38] if that's happening the guilt and shame
[3246.12 - 3249.18] shifter you see how incredible this is
[3247.38 - 3251.64] and listen if there's you can do the
[3249.18 - 3254.10] trauma shock loss
[3251.64 - 3255.66] you can do the guilt shame you can do a
[3254.10 - 3258.18] couple of different ones too you can
[3255.66 - 3259.26] they're just so powerful you can switch
[3258.18 - 3262.26] it up
[3259.26 - 3264.54] here's one right here
[3262.26 - 3268.38] you're feeling guilt or Shame about
[3264.54 - 3271.68] something you said and can't unsay
[3268.38 - 3273.78] now I say all kinds of things
[3271.68 - 3275.46] remember when we were doing a live like
[3273.78 - 3277.44] way back do you guys remember when we
[3275.46 - 3278.82] were doing a live way back and that
[3277.44 - 3281.64] person was saying all those terrible
[3278.82 - 3283.38] things about me like Terrible Things
[3281.64 - 3284.70] they were like trolling and they were
[3283.38 - 3287.52] saying all these terrible things and
[3284.70 - 3290.82] then Dr Nesbitt
[3287.52 - 3294.92] came out and called the person psycho
[3290.82 - 3294.92] I felt really bad for Dr Nesbitt
[3295.26 - 3300.18] Jackie B says you should say mayonnaise
[3297.42 - 3301.80] Clinic I always used to say Manos
[3300.18 - 3304.68] mayonnaise Clinic
[3301.80 - 3306.36] they make a lot of mayo there what else
[3304.68 - 3308.76] are they doing they don't have the
[3306.36 - 3310.98] answers for chronic illness
[3308.76 - 3312.42] I mean no disrespect I'm sure there's
[3310.98 - 3314.40] some good docs there
[3312.42 - 3317.34] but either way I think they're making a
[3314.40 - 3318.78] lot of mayonnaise there is what I think
[3317.34 - 3320.82] Selena
[3318.78 - 3322.68] just my opinion I have every right to
[3320.82 - 3326.34] have an opinion everybody else has an
[3322.68 - 3328.74] opinion against me 24 7 about me
[3326.34 - 3330.84] can't have an opinion one time
[3328.74 - 3333.36] Selena
[3330.84 - 3335.34] psychology is now acknowledging that
[3333.36 - 3337.92] toxic heavy metals are in part behind
[3335.34 - 3341.00] autism oh my God
[3337.92 - 3341.00] oh my God
[3346.38 - 3348.84] let's see what the rest of your comment
[3347.94 - 3351.54] is
[3348.84 - 3353.28] Selena says psychology is now
[3351.54 - 3354.90] acknowledging that toxic heavy metals
[3353.28 - 3356.76] are in part behind autism did you know
[3354.90 - 3359.22] there's no science study that shows
[3356.76 - 3361.62] toxic heavy metals are behind autism
[3359.22 - 3365.28] did you know there's no study or proof
[3361.62 - 3367.92] or any kind of like discovery
[3365.28 - 3370.14] it was published almost a decade ago in
[3367.92 - 3371.82] the medical medium book here and also
[3370.14 - 3374.16] lectured by me many years before but you
[3371.82 - 3376.38] say something else but they won't say
[3374.16 - 3378.30] what to do to heal because they don't
[3376.38 - 3379.56] know and they never knew it was Metals
[3378.30 - 3381.96] anyway they're stealing your information
[3379.56 - 3383.82] and mixing it with BS ridiculous exactly
[3381.96 - 3385.56] that's what they do Selena that's what
[3383.82 - 3387.66] they do it's because millions of these
[3385.56 - 3388.56] went around the world with the answer in
[3387.66 - 3390.00] them
[3388.56 - 3392.52] millions of this New York Times
[3390.00 - 3395.34] bestseller went around the world
[3392.52 - 3398.30] and they had to take the information and
[3395.34 - 3398.30] they won't sign it back
[3398.88 - 3403.68] I hope when they leave this place
[3400.80 - 3407.82] someday I hope
[3403.68 - 3411.02] they can find peace with themselves
[3407.82 - 3411.02] when they're leaving here
[3414.96 - 3420.48] because they really need to because
[3418.62 - 3423.24] that's just some wrong going down
[3420.48 - 3424.92] all right
[3423.24 - 3426.78] you're feeling guilt or Shame about
[3424.92 - 3428.52] something you said and can't unsay like
[3426.78 - 3429.48] you said something and you can't unsay
[3428.52 - 3431.40] it

[3431.40 - 3435.38] great time to use the golden shame
[3432.66 - 3435.38] shifter right here

[3438.36 - 3445.98] being able to Live Your Dream yet

[3445.98 - 3450.90] still do
[3448.14 - 3453.78] because I was forced into this by Spirit
[3450.90 - 3457.32] of compassion at age four I still want
[3453.78 - 3460.98] to do something on my own someday
[3457.32 - 3462.96] um Helene says 50 ounces dot dot dot
[3460.98 - 3464.34] Does it include the 32 ounces of lemon
[3462.96 - 3468.08] water in the morning
[3464.34 - 3468.08] yes includes lemon water in the morning
[3471.30 - 3475.44] my dream is to make sure the chronically
[3472.98 - 3477.42] will get answers and heal that is my
[3475.44 - 3479.52] dream but when I was younger and spirit
[3477.42 - 3481.62] of compassion was
[3479.52 - 3485.10] making me do this
[3481.62 - 3487.32] my dream was to just ride my bicycle and
[3485.10 - 3489.06] do a lot of other fun things when I was
[3487.32 - 3490.80] eight years old five years old six years
[3489.06 - 3492.72] old okay
[3490.80 - 3494.76] and here's another one here
[3492.72 - 3497.40] this is important too you're feeling
[3494.76 - 3499.32] guilt or Shame about not being able to
[3497.40 - 3501.42] help a friend or family member in the
[3499.32 - 3502.80] present moment that's a great time to
[3501.42 - 3505.38] use it too
[3502.80 - 3510.56] here's one you're having difficulty
[3505.38 - 3510.56] forgiving someone else who has hurt you
[3510.66 - 3516.18] so you can't you can't forgive someone
[3512.94 - 3519.38] who has hurt you it's a hard one to do
[3516.18 - 3519.38] guilt and shame shifter
[3519.84 - 3523.50] of someone who's of disappointed you or
[3522.00 - 3526.14] someone who's upset you here's one right
[3523.50 - 3528.36] here you're feeling ashamed or guilty in
[3526.14 - 3530.16] any way this shot can help you
[3528.36 - 3531.42] understand and release emotional wounds
[3530.16 - 3534.36] that are
[3531.42 - 3536.42] actually igniting guilt and shame
[3534.36 - 3541.34] perpetuating
[3536.42 - 3541.34] all right let's work on it now
[3542.16 - 3545.94] I'm excited you guys I'm going to move
[3543.90 - 3548.36] over the brain a little bit here let's
[3545.94 - 3548.36] get going
[3549.50 - 3553.58] it's the mm-1500
[3554.28 - 3557.70] I mean I got a little guilt that I
[3555.78 - 3559.02] haven't been talking about it
[3557.70 - 3560.52] for a while
[3559.02 - 3562.14] because I've been so busy trying to get
[3560.52 - 3564.00] the book done and everything else and
[3562.14 - 3566.64] then the juicer sharks came into the
[3564.00 - 3568.86] community started selling people the MLM
[3566.64 - 3570.00] crap and saying that this is the best
[3568.86 - 3572.64] juice or whatever and they didn't
[3570.00 - 3574.50] realize it but the mm 1500 and the 900
[3572.64 - 3576.54] is what squeezes more juice out of
[3574.50 - 3579.06] everything and it saves you money
[3576.54 - 3582.00] because the cost of produce is going up
[3579.06 - 3584.04] and we want something to pay for itself
[3582.00 - 3585.54] so what I find that my personal
[3584.04 - 3586.98] experience and what I've seen other
[3585.54 - 3589.32] people's experiences
[3586.98 - 3592.62] the savings that happens when you're
[3589.32 - 3595.02] juicing with the mm 1500 or 900 is you
[3592.62 - 3598.32] actually pay for the juicer itself
[3595.02 - 3600.72] so that if you ever get a broken part
[3598.32 - 3603.00] it pays for the broken part over again
[3600.72 - 3604.56] unlike the other juicers when you get a
[3603.00 - 3606.48] broken part
[3604.56 - 3608.52] it's not paying for that broken part
[3606.48 - 3611.16] because all the juicers just break all
[3608.52 - 3613.50] the time all the juicers out there so if
[3611.16 - 3615.48] you ever get like a worn out part and
[3613.50 - 3617.34] you have to get it pays for itself you
[3615.48 - 3619.14] want something that pays for itself all
[3617.34 - 3621.50] the time so you're saving money over and
[3619.14 - 3621.50] over again
[3622.02 - 3625.86] so many amazing comments about your

[3643.62 - 3648.24] shame shifter remember the mm 1500 is 20
[3646.14 - 3650.58] off right now which is incredible keep
[3648.24 - 3653.76] that in mind I endorsed fully endorsed
[3650.58 - 3656.22] the company because of what it does high
[3653.76 - 3658.68] compression saves people money
[3656.22 - 3660.24] the the cool thing which the juicer
[3658.68 - 3661.38] sharks don't know by the way when
[3660.24 - 3663.06] they're trying to rip people off with
[3661.38 - 3665.22] the juicers out there
[3663.06 - 3668.22] they don't realize this makes hummus
[3665.22 - 3670.68] salsa sorbet ice cream
[3668.22 - 3672.72] nut milks nut Butters
[3670.68 - 3675.90] did I say hummus again
[3672.72 - 3676.68] flawlessly it's incredible on top of the
[3675.90 - 3679.08] fact
[3676.68 - 3681.00] that it crushes it in celery juice and
[3679.08 - 3683.94] crushes it by Saving you money when
[3681.00 - 3685.68] you're juicing stuff all right you guys
[3683.94 - 3687.00] so many people asking me what are the
[3685.68 - 3688.86] best juicers and I haven't been
[3687.00 - 3690.84] responding and I feel guilty so I have
[3688.86 - 3692.16] guilt and shame about not responding
[3690.84 - 3694.32] enough to that
[3692.16 - 3695.58] so because I've been too busy but I
[3694.32 - 3697.92] already thought everybody knew about the
[3695.58 - 3700.74] 1500 and 900 but I was wrong not
[3697.92 - 3703.16] everybody knows about it okay so here we
[3700.74 - 3706.56] go let's make this and get it going
[3703.16 - 3710.58] it's a quiet juicer by the way
[3706.56 - 3711.58] so half inch piece of fresh ginger
[3710.58 - 3715.98] pop that in there
[3711.58 - 3717.72] [Music]
[3715.98 - 3720.06] that's first
[3717.72 - 3722.48] half to one cup of tightly packed
[3720.06 - 3722.48] spinach
[3722.70 - 3725.22] so I'm going to tightly pack it in my
[3724.44 - 3728.84] hand
[3725.22 - 3728.84] and I'm going to drop it in here
[3729.24 - 3732.32] so that was about
[3733.92 - 3740.84] half cup there somewhere around there
[3737.82 - 3740.84] get a little bit more
[3743.28 - 3746.12] to make a cup

[3776.88 - 3781.44] spot on your orange like a real soft
[3779.22 - 3784.44] spot and then you end up just putting in
[3781.44 - 3786.72] a rotten orange that can happen Allison
[3784.44 - 3789.66] Saunders says omega's warranty replaces
[3786.72 - 3792.18] my parts for free has done it twice with
[3789.66 - 3794.52] no problem
[3792.18 - 3796.92] and the and the juice you're saving us

[3804.30 - 3807.14] I'm Blown Away
[3808.50 - 3813.36] I just feel bad when the juicer sharks
[3810.84 - 3815.76] and the Sharks come into the community
[3813.36 - 3818.34] because it's like
[3815.76 - 3820.38] they'll run ads 24 7 in the community
[3818.34 - 3822.12] and then they'll get people on board and
[3820.38 - 3824.40] try to do the affiliate feed things so
[3822.12 - 3826.14] that everybody's pushing them and then
[3824.40 - 3830.40] meanwhile people are not saving money
[3826.14 - 3832.32] and produce is expensive foreign it's so
[3830.40 - 3835.14] sad
