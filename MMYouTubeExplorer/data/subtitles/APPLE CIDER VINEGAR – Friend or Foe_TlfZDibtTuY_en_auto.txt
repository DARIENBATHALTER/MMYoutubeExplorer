[170.32 - 175.04] you guys so
[171.84 - 176.80] i talk about how acetic acid
[175.04 - 179.20] does a few things that we don't like
[176.80 - 182.40] that we don't want in somebody's body
[179.20 - 184.48] one thing is is it blows out the gastric
[182.40 - 185.84] glands you got these stomach glands
[184.48 - 188.88] they're in your stomach
[185.84 - 190.32] those stomach glands make or break
[188.88 - 192.48] all kinds of different health conditions
[190.32 - 194.08] when you lose all your hcl
[192.48 - 195.60] because these stomach lands get tired
[194.08 - 197.12] and tired in your stomach and they got
[195.60 - 199.12] tired and they get tired
[197.12 - 200.48] what happens is then we do all this
[199.12 - 201.68] apple cider vinegar
[200.48 - 203.12] it's because we're trying to get rid of
[201.68 - 204.88] acid reflux we're trying to get rid of
[203.12 - 205.76] bloating we're trying to make our skin
[204.88 - 207.92] better
[205.76 - 209.12] apple cider vinegar can get you better
[207.92 - 211.44] it can fix anything

[211.44 - 214.96] vinegar you got gout
[213.04 - 216.08] apple cider vinegar you got eczema
[214.96 - 218.08] psoriasis take
[216.08 - 219.68] two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
[218.08 - 221.68] that will fix everything
[219.68 - 223.20] you got you got and you know what it
[221.68 - 225.60] doesn't work that way
[223.20 - 226.56] it's not what happens it's not how it
[225.60 - 230.08] works
[226.56 - 230.72] it's it's you know it's not it's not a
[230.08 - 233.92] problem
[230.72 - 236.48] solver it's a problem maker
[233.92 - 237.52] for a lot of people along the way as
[236.48 - 240.08] time goes on
[237.52 - 242.64] and i'm gonna explain why like why does
[240.08 - 244.88] it help somebody with acid reflux
[242.64 - 246.00] why does it help somebody with acid
[244.88 - 249.12] reflux but
[246.00 - 250.32] somebody else it gives them really bad
[249.12 - 252.24] acid reflux like
[250.32 - 254.72] they drink it they're like oh my god
[252.24 - 256.16] they're throwing up or they drink it and
[254.72 - 258.24] they're like stomach gets bloated
[256.16 - 260.56] bloated bloated bloated bloated
[258.24 - 262.32] like dear lord what just happened or
[260.56 - 264.24] they drink it they're like i feel sick
[262.32 - 266.96] and nauseous and i'm dizzy
[264.24 - 268.96] you know and there's a reason why
[266.96 - 270.32] someone can drink it and feel that way
[268.96 - 272.48] and then another person
[270.32 - 274.40] can drink it and be like hey i think my
[272.48 - 275.76] acid reflux is improving whoa
[274.40 - 277.44] i think i'm getting a little slimmer
[275.76 - 278.24] around the waistline whoa
[277.44 - 280.72] so i'm going to talk about the
[278.24 - 283.04] differences cindy don
[280.72 - 285.28] hey thank you i listened to this episode

[290.32 - 293.36] is
[290.64 - 294.72] in yeah you know i talked to people over
[293.36 - 295.68] the years and i'm like stay away from
[294.72 - 297.84] vinegar

[297.84 - 300.48] cider vinegar okay
[299.04 - 302.08] if you're not gonna get rid of your
[300.48 - 303.76] vinegar i've had people say

[310.48 - 315.28] the best one
[311.44 - 317.20] for 35 plus years like it's the best one
[315.28 - 318.64] but guess what there's all kinds of
[317.20 - 320.48] pitfalls even with that

[376.08 - 379.20] you're looking out for me
[377.76 - 381.20] you know i'm honored i want to look out
[379.20 - 384.72] for you guys so i want to talk about
[381.20 - 386.56] can you drink can you drink
[384.72 - 388.08] apple cider vinegar or whether diluting
[386.56 - 391.04] water or straight
[388.08 - 392.64] can you do it with a straw first of all
[391.04 - 393.92] you're going to hit the back molars no
[392.64 - 395.28] matter what you stick a straw in your
[393.92 - 397.12] mouth and you suck that stuff
[395.28 - 398.64] up it's going to get somewhere it's
[397.12 - 400.24] going to get on the back molars there's
[398.64 - 401.76] no question it's going to get there
[400.24 - 403.44] so that's number one you guys so
[401.76 - 405.68] important to know number two is
[403.44 - 406.48] unless you jam that straw so far down
[405.68 - 409.76] your throat
[406.48 - 411.60] and you actually try to suck that stuff
[409.76 - 413.76] up from your glass through a straw with
[411.60 - 415.60] a straw halfway down your throat
[413.76 - 417.36] you're really not going to keep it away
[415.60 - 418.32] from your teeth but that's not the
[417.36 - 420.72] problem
[418.32 - 421.76] it's not about it touching your teeth so
[420.72 - 424.72] much
[421.76 - 427.28] it's about it being in the body acetic
[424.72 - 428.00] acid has a chemical reaction so it's not
[427.28 - 431.36] just
[428.00 - 433.76] when it touches something like teeth
[431.36 - 434.80] it's not that it's the chemical reaction
[433.76 - 438.16] that happens
[434.80 - 439.28] inside the body trace mineral calcium we
[438.16 - 441.92] rely on
[439.28 - 443.36] to keep our bones strong so they stay
[441.92 - 445.84] strong throughout the years
[443.36 - 446.96] trace mineral calcium is how we keep our
[445.84 - 449.12] bones strong
[446.96 - 450.72] our teeth strong and what happens when
[449.12 - 452.32] you put that acetic acid
[450.72 - 453.76] i know a lot of people say what's acetic
[452.32 - 455.84] acid what is that
[453.76 - 456.88] well it's vinegar and a lot of people
[455.84 - 458.72] say you know
[456.88 - 460.64] how can i do this let me use a straw
[458.72 - 461.84] that's not it when you dump the acetic
[460.64 - 463.44] acid in your body
[461.84 - 465.12] a chemical reaction happens throughout
[463.44 - 467.36] your entire body
[465.12 - 468.32] and then it starts to leach that's when
[467.36 - 471.12] it could leech
[468.32 - 472.24] calcium it can take your trace mineral
[471.12 - 474.32] calcium away
[472.24 - 476.32] so that that trace mineral calcium isn't
[474.32 - 476.96] going into bones isn't going into place
[476.32 - 480.32] it's like
[476.96 - 481.60] okay you know vinegar use for decades
[480.32 - 484.40] will lead you into
[481.60 - 485.92] problems with your bones and teeth and
[484.40 - 487.76] apple cider vinegar yeah it's from
[485.92 - 490.08] apples and i talked about in the episode
[487.76 - 492.56] why it's good but you gotta listen
[490.08 - 493.36] to the episode to know why apple cider
[492.56 - 494.96] vinegar i say
[493.36 - 497.52] is good but why you still have to worry
[494.96 - 499.68] about the uncensored

[530.16 - 534.24] i'm happier off of it now you got to
[531.68 - 536.40] know something i have nothing to gain
[534.24 - 538.72] to get you off of apple cider vinegar
[536.40 - 541.36] like what motive can i have
[538.72 - 542.96] um get off apple cider vinegar that's
[541.36 - 544.56] going to help me a lot over here
[542.96 - 545.92] anthony william let me tell you what
[544.56 - 548.00] happens when i tell you to get off apple
[545.92 - 551.12] cider vinegar anthony william gets a lot
[548.00 - 552.56] of crap so the only thing i have to gain
[551.12 - 554.16] by getting you off your apple cider
[552.56 - 557.28] vinegar is a whole
[554.16 - 558.64] bunch of noise and crap and so
[557.28 - 560.56] i don't like making my life more
[558.64 - 562.16] difficult than it already is with all
[560.56 - 562.64] the stuff i'm up against for putting out
[562.16 - 565.20] truth
[562.64 - 566.80] all the time constantly and it it goes
[565.20 - 567.92] against the trends that are actually
[566.80 - 570.32] backed by money
[567.92 - 572.32] you guys know how it works but i have
[570.32 - 573.68] nothing to gain by trying to actually
[572.32 - 575.84] say
[573.68 - 577.36] say hey stop doing your two tablespoons
[575.84 - 579.60] apple cider vinegar every morning
[577.36 - 581.68] stop doing this i have nothing what can
[579.60 - 583.52] i gain besides a smack in the head
[581.68 - 585.44] which i get anyway from all this stuff
[583.52 - 587.84] like why do i want that anyway
[585.44 - 590.64] bottom line okay let's go into what it
[587.84 - 592.40] does your gastric glands this is
[590.64 - 593.76] critical michelle l says people are
[592.40 - 597.44] detailed oriented

[608.96 - 612.32] down
[609.68 - 613.68] that's how you keep pathogens down like
[612.32 - 616.64] bad bacteria
[613.68 - 617.12] that's how you break down and digest
[616.64 - 620.32] food
[617.12 - 621.28] properly okay it's that hydrochloric
[620.32 - 624.48] acid that your
[621.28 - 627.52] your stomach glands produce and
[624.48 - 629.76] when you drop in acetic acid like boom
[627.52 - 630.56] i got apple cider vinegar in here two
[629.76 - 632.56] tablespoons
[630.56 - 634.72] it's mixed in water i'm gonna have some
[632.56 - 637.68] now
[634.72 - 638.72] oh god so acidic ah my mouth is
[637.68 - 642.72] puckering
[638.72 - 644.88] mmm ah my stomach feels sick now
[642.72 - 646.32] and this is just straight water but the
[644.88 - 648.00] point is is when you put that apple
[646.32 - 650.72] cider vinegar in
[648.00 - 652.32] what it does okay is the minute it goes
[650.72 - 655.20] into the stomach
[652.32 - 656.56] your stomach the lining of your stomach
[655.20 - 659.04] sees it as a poison
[656.56 - 661.12] so it starts to release mucus so it
[659.04 - 662.48] starts to produce mucus to battle the
[661.12 - 664.24] acetic acid while
[662.48 - 665.68] it's sitting inside your stomach it
[664.24 - 667.44] starts to battle it
[665.68 - 668.72] and then it's one thing the next thing
[667.44 - 671.12] is your
[668.72 - 672.08] gastric glands have to over produce now
[671.12 - 675.04] hcl
[672.08 - 675.92] to try to neutralize this acetic acid
[675.04 - 678.64] because now there's an
[675.92 - 680.08] acid competition going on okay so your
[678.64 - 681.60] gastric glands are trying to literally
[680.08 - 684.48] neutralize the stuff it's
[681.60 - 684.80] pouring out the hcl what happens is you
[684.48 - 687.68] can
[684.80 - 688.32] play that game if you got strong stomach
[687.68 - 691.12] lands
[688.32 - 692.48] you can play that game for years until
[691.12 - 694.24] that game
[692.48 - 696.08] bites you in the butt and then you lose
[694.24 - 697.92] all your hcl and then you're just in bad
[696.08 - 700.16] shape altogether
[697.92 - 702.00] lena says linda says i think it has
[700.16 - 703.84] burned my esophagus
[702.00 - 706.40] i drank it regularly and now i'm
[703.84 - 709.12] wondering what's wrong with my voice
[706.40 - 710.40] it listen i mean you can heal that you
[709.12 - 712.48] can heal things
[710.40 - 715.12] you can work on healing but yes it's
[712.48 - 716.00] that aggressive that acetic acid is that
[715.12 - 718.72] aggressive
