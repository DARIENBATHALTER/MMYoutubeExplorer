[811.80 - 817.08] I'm going to talk about
[814.38 - 821.70] one thing here which is interesting back
[817.08 - 823.92] to the medical medium frame shot therapy
[821.70 - 826.62] now I promise you
[823.92 - 828.96] the medical mean and brain shot therapy
[826.62 - 831.54] that your mind is going to be blown when
[828.96 - 833.34] you use the brain shot therapy
[831.54 - 837.00] so it's 30 shots
[833.34 - 840.00] but what's incredible is the brain
[837.00 - 843.12] shot therapy cleanse
[840.00 - 845.70] that's exciting now I'd say cleanse is
[843.12 - 847.44] there's different levels so there's the
[845.70 - 849.18] cleanse with cleanse is I want to talk
[847.44 - 851.58] about that a little bit
[849.18 - 853.62] so I'm in the brain shots and I know I
[851.58 - 855.36] talked about this yesterday because it's
[853.62 - 857.16] that incredible you got the different
[855.36 - 860.28] brain shots
[857.16 - 862.62] that's the exposure shot right there now
[860.28 - 864.18] be prepared so here's the thing between
[862.62 - 866.76] yesterday when I was talking in today
[864.18 - 868.62] and I'm talking right about it all
[866.76 - 870.06] today I'm just trying to give you guys a
[868.62 - 873.66] little heads up
[870.06 - 877.26] that when you Embark and Venture into
[873.66 - 880.32] these brain shots prepare yourself
[877.26 - 883.26] because people are not used to getting
[880.32 - 887.52] results right away in this world
[883.26 - 889.56] they're not in alternative medicine
[887.52 - 892.92] people and conventional medicine people
[889.56 - 896.40] are not used to results immediately
[892.92 - 899.88] they never they never expected so when
[896.40 - 901.56] you do the brain shot therapy
[899.88 - 903.66] brain shots
[901.56 - 906.24] it's going to surprise you so I'm trying
[903.66 - 907.92] to prepare you
[906.24 - 909.86] because
[907.92 - 912.72] people don't get results
[909.86 - 915.48] right away
[912.72 - 917.76] but they do when you're doing the brain
[915.48 - 919.74] shot therapy
[917.76 - 921.42] so when you Embark into these brain
[919.74 - 925.02] shots
[921.42 - 927.72] get ready so it's not a surprise I don't
[925.02 - 929.70] want it to be a big surprise for you I
[927.72 - 932.76] don't want you to do it and be like what
[929.70 - 935.28] just hit me oh my God
[932.76 - 938.04] I want you to know that
[935.28 - 941.40] this is quick acting relief it happens
[938.04 - 943.92] so actually be ready for it and be
[941.40 - 945.78] prepared prepared for it so there's the
[943.92 - 947.96] pathogen exposure shot talked about this
[945.78 - 950.88] a little bit yesterday toxic fragrances
[947.96 - 952.26] fragrances exposure negative energy
[950.88 - 956.22] exposure
[952.26 - 957.54] mold exposure EMF and 5G exposure so I'm
[956.22 - 958.74] just going through some of them but I'm
[957.54 - 961.28] going to move out of the brain shot
[958.74 - 961.28] therapy
[966.84 - 970.86] well actually let's talk about the
[968.52 - 975.44] different levels there's seven
[970.86 - 975.44] brain shot therapy cleanse levels
[975.96 - 983.28] so the first level is entry level
[980.64 - 985.68] so if you want to Embark into that or
[983.28 - 988.02] try that you do the entry level
[985.68 - 990.78] second one is
[988.02 - 992.88] basic so it's the basic brain shot
[990.78 - 995.52] therapy cleanse
[992.88 - 997.86] third level is simplified brain shot
[995.52 - 1000.86] therapy cleanse
[997.86 - 1002.72] fourth level is intermediate brain shot
[1000.86 - 1005.84] therapy cleanse fifth level is
[1002.72 - 1008.00] performance brain shot therapy cleanse
[1005.84 - 1010.16] sixth level is Advanced frame shot
[1008.00 - 1012.80] therapy cleanse
[1010.16 - 1015.62] seventh level is high powered brain shot
[1012.80 - 1018.68] therapy clouds
[1015.62 - 1020.90] and remember what I was saying before
[1018.68 - 1022.82] even if you're just doing them singly
[1020.90 - 1024.50] like you're not doing the brain shot
[1022.82 - 1025.82] therapy cleanses but you're doing the
[1024.50 - 1029.12] brain shots
[1025.82 - 1032.72] that when you partake in those
[1029.12 - 1035.24] be prepared to actually feel something
[1032.72 - 1037.64] what happens in alternative medicine no
[1035.24 - 1041.00] matter what you do where you go
[1037.64 - 1044.12] getting instant quick
[1041.00 - 1046.04] results or relief is not something
[1044.12 - 1048.86] that's heard of out there
[1046.04 - 1051.74] but this is the medical medium stuff and
[1048.86 - 1054.82] this is the brain saver books
[1051.74 - 1054.82] so look out
[1057.56 - 1060.28] and
[1062.54 - 1068.08] we're in brain saver right here and
[1064.76 - 1068.08] we're braid saver protocols
[1068.48 - 1071.96] so the whole thing about with brain
[1070.10 - 1073.82] shots what are they let's clarify that
[1071.96 - 1076.22] right now I'll give you a little window
[1073.82 - 1078.86] into what they are just so you know
[1076.22 - 1082.16] here's the mood shifter right here if
[1078.86 - 1084.26] you see you see a glass
[1082.16 - 1088.46] that glass is filled with roughly around
[1084.26 - 1090.74] two ounces that's a shot glass
[1088.46 - 1093.62] so they're brain shots because they're
[1090.74 - 1095.96] small quantities
[1093.62 - 1098.00] of medicinals
[1095.96 - 1099.74] medicinal food
[1098.00 - 1101.72] and then what happens is when you
[1099.74 - 1103.52] actually turn it into the shot through
[1101.72 - 1105.14] the recipe that you have here in the
[1103.52 - 1107.12] brain saver book
[1105.14 - 1109.04] it looks something similar to that I'll
[1107.12 - 1111.68] show you another one right here just so
[1109.04 - 1114.80] you're not confused
[1111.68 - 1117.20] this one's the energy shifter right here
[1114.80 - 1119.06] there you go
[1117.20 - 1122.98] so keep in mind that's like a two ounce
[1119.06 - 1122.98] shot glass is what that is
[1124.88 - 1128.38] now I'll show you another one too
[1128.84 - 1134.78] here's a craving shifter right there
[1132.62 - 1136.16] so what I mean quick acting relief I
[1134.78 - 1138.56] mean if you're somebody fighting and
[1136.16 - 1139.94] struggling with Cravings somebody that's
[1138.56 - 1142.28] struggling with cravings and dealing
[1139.94 - 1145.82] with anything like that
[1142.28 - 1148.70] and you do the brain shot
[1145.82 - 1151.90] you get the instant relief
[1148.70 - 1151.90] so it's a big deal
[1153.80 - 1158.54] if you're dealing with frustration if
[1156.14 - 1161.44] you're somebody that's
[1158.54 - 1164.66] gets heated up easy

[1308.12 - 1312.98] that plus other things too compiled into
[1310.94 - 1313.94] it so
[1312.98 - 1317.00] when you're talking about the
[1313.94 - 1319.10] high-powered heavy metal detox cleanse
[1317.00 - 1320.90] that's a whole other level too so many

[1366.68 - 1369.38] the world is changing and that's the
[1368.00 - 1371.60] thing with what's going on with the
[1369.38 - 1374.48] medical medium book series is as the
[1371.60 - 1377.42] world gets more corrupted
[1374.48 - 1380.06] with poisons and toxins on a level that
[1377.42 - 1382.04] we've never seen before
[1380.06 - 1384.56] and everybody's just like a frog and a
[1382.04 - 1386.66] pot of boiling water
[1384.56 - 1388.28] because you're kind of living in it you
[1386.66 - 1390.08] get the exposure you don't know it and
[1388.28 - 1393.62] it gets worse and worse we have to do
[1390.08 - 1396.50] something about it so
[1393.62 - 1399.26] what is offered in the brand saver books
[1396.50 - 1400.46] is to move that needle no matter what it
[1399.26 - 1402.26] takes
[1400.46 - 1405.68] and medical meme information has already
[1402.26 - 1408.68] done that for people but we're coming on
[1405.68 - 1413.06] in history in the next
[1408.68 - 1414.50] five years even now and moving forward
[1413.06 - 1416.00] that
[1414.50 - 1417.98] we're going to be up against so much
[1416.00 - 1420.02] more with our bodies
[1417.98 - 1421.22] so much more corruption in the
[1420.02 - 1426.44] industries
[1421.22 - 1428.96] so much more exposure with pathogens
[1426.44 - 1431.24] that we have to keep up with it and we
[1428.96 - 1433.76] have to make sure that everybody has a
[1431.24 - 1436.76] chance to move the needle
[1433.76 - 1438.44] so it's really an incredible exciting
[1436.76 - 1440.90] moment in time right now for the brand

[1489.08 - 1493.96] here
[1490.16 - 1493.96] I'm really excited for all of you
[1494.72 - 1499.10] you love your mm personal Library
[1497.00 - 1500.90] incredible Lisa you just received the
[1499.10 - 1503.86] books Alexandria
[1500.90 - 1503.86] amazing
[1504.38 - 1507.50] so
[1505.70 - 1508.70] give you a quick rundown on the books a
[1507.50 - 1509.78] little bit if you guys aren't familiar
[1508.70 - 1512.60] with it
[1509.78 - 1515.12] there's over 300 symptoms and conditions
[1512.60 - 1516.98] in these books many of the symptoms and
[1515.12 - 1519.38] conditions explain in detail now there's
[1516.98 - 1522.08] an eating disorder chapter
[1519.38 - 1525.62] that's on a level no one is ever going
[1522.08 - 1529.58] to expect really it's mind-blowing so
[1525.62 - 1532.34] that chapter alone is just
[1529.58 - 1533.96] lots of incredible information so I want
[1532.34 - 1537.62] to give everybody a little window into
[1533.96 - 1539.72] the book there's a blood draw chapter in
[1537.62 - 1541.34] detail of how to protect yourself with
[1539.72 - 1544.72] protocols on how to protect yourself
[1541.34 - 1546.98] before you go for a blood test
[1544.72 - 1550.04] protocols for how to protect yourself
[1546.98 - 1551.84] after you had your blood test or blood
[1550.04 - 1555.98] drawn
[1551.84 - 1557.90] so that's a big big plus inside these
[1555.98 - 1559.46] books all on its own
[1557.90 - 1561.02] and I've talked about it if you're new
[1559.46 - 1564.56] to Medical medium information you might
[1561.02 - 1566.24] not know about what happens when you get
[1564.56 - 1568.58] your blood drawn
[1566.24 - 1570.98] and how it weakens your immune system
[1568.58 - 1574.46] and that your bone marrow has to go in
[1570.98 - 1577.00] overdrive to produce immune cells and as
[1574.46 - 1580.40] we get sicker and have mystery symptoms
[1577.00 - 1583.94] our doctors and Specialists they order
[1580.40 - 1585.98] more blood so they want more blood drawn
[1583.94 - 1588.20] so now you're into a lot more vials of
[1585.98 - 1590.60] blood then you lose more of your immune
[1588.20 - 1592.34] system and then your bone marrow has to
[1590.60 - 1595.76] go into overdrive again
[1592.34 - 1597.62] and then your condition worsens
[1595.76 - 1600.02] so medical meme information has been
