[184.56 - 188.64] who's a doctor right i was trying to
[186.56 - 190.80] reach out to him because he he contacted
[188.64 - 192.88] me and then i reached back out to him so
[190.80 - 194.88] i called his office and was like is he
[192.88 - 196.40] there what's he doing it's anthony i got
[194.88 - 197.60] a couple of minutes he had a question
[196.40 - 200.88] for me
[197.60 - 203.44] and then their personalized dietitian
[200.88 - 206.64] slash nutritionist there
[203.44 - 208.00] at the doctor clinic had me on the phone
[206.64 - 209.68] and said i just want to talk to you for
[208.00 - 211.60] a minute mr william because i have
[209.68 - 213.12] different views on how the body works
[211.60 - 215.04] and i said
[213.12 - 216.72] all right tell me
[215.04 - 219.36] how's it how does it work
[216.72 - 221.76] like how what's your views you really
[219.36 - 224.24] you know you you want people to juice
[221.76 - 226.80] and you want people to cleanse but the
[224.24 - 229.28] body doesn't work like that i've learned
[226.80 - 231.12] that the body cleanses itself you just
[229.28 - 233.52] have to eat in moderation you have to
[231.12 - 235.92] have a balanced diet and i sat there and
[233.52 - 238.16] i was like uh-huh okay my eyes were kind
[235.92 - 240.48] of rolling over and i was like okay my
[238.16 - 242.64] eyes are kind of looking my i was
[240.48 - 244.56] actually like they were like starting to
[242.64 - 247.52] roll over i was flickering my eyes were
[244.56 - 250.40] flickering and i was like okay tell me
[247.52 - 253.12] tell me like yeah and you just have to
[250.40 - 255.76] exercise and then everybody's body
[253.12 - 256.88] handles itself on its own and i said
[255.76 - 260.08] listen
[256.88 - 262.96] i've heard that before many times
[260.08 - 265.12] but what are your patients like well
[262.96 - 266.96] they got all kinds of problems mr
[265.12 - 268.80] william they come in here sick with
[266.96 - 270.64] everything and i'm scratching my head
[268.80 - 272.32] and i go okay well do you think they
[270.64 - 273.20] need to cleanse a little
[272.32 - 274.16] well
[273.20 - 276.16] no
[274.16 - 278.56] their bodies handle that well then how's
[276.16 - 279.84] their body handling anything on its own
[278.56 - 281.84] when they're coming in there they're
[279.84 - 283.76] like the walking dead coming in there
[281.84 - 285.44] she was like yeah they can't walk they
[283.76 - 287.68] got aches and pains
[285.44 - 289.68] some people need to be carried in some
[287.68 - 291.68] people have all these
[289.68 - 293.84] horrendous skin conditions some people
[291.68 - 296.16] have depression so bad some people have
[293.84 - 298.56] all these problems i go yeah and do you
[296.16 - 301.12] think there's something inside of them
[298.56 - 303.20] that needs to come out that shouldn't be
[301.12 - 305.76] there well i don't really know what that
[303.20 - 307.84] could be maybe it's climate change mr
[305.76 - 309.60] william do you think it's climate change
[307.84 - 310.72] that's causing problems with all my
[309.60 - 313.52] patients
[310.72 - 313.52] and i was just like
[313.60 - 318.32] i was banging my head on my desk when i
[316.32 - 320.16] was hearing it
[318.32 - 323.20] and i was like and i was being really
[320.16 - 325.36] nice i wasn't the combative medical
[323.20 - 329.20] medium you know when he's
[325.36 - 331.28] when he's like i am doctor so and so
[329.20 - 333.28] i was like okay listen
[331.28 - 335.28] it's not climate change that's making
[333.28 - 336.96] everybody sick okay
[335.28 - 338.40] it's not
[336.96 - 342.08] it might be
[338.40 - 345.52] everything everybody's doing
[342.08 - 347.84] like burning fake logs all that fake
[345.52 - 349.44] chemical those fake logs you guys know
[347.84 - 351.28] about the fake logs you burn them in the
[349.44 - 353.52] fireplaces because it's coming on
[351.28 - 355.20] christmas and thanksgiving maybe it's
[353.52 - 356.80] from all the air fresheners and the
[355.20 - 358.48] scented candles you guys know
[356.80 - 360.00] everybody's lighting sent the candles in
[358.48 - 361.28] every one of their houses right now and
[360.00 - 362.32] they're poisoning their children and
[361.28 - 364.96] their pets and they're killing
[362.32 - 367.52] themselves they're killing themselves
[364.96 - 370.64] right now with scented candles thousands
[367.52 - 373.28] of chemical soups put into that chemical
[370.64 - 374.40] into that candle to purposely destroy
[373.28 - 375.52] your life
[374.40 - 377.84] and so
[375.52 - 380.56] i sat there telling this person right
[377.84 - 381.60] this dietitian nutritionist for that
[380.56 - 384.40] clinic
[381.60 - 385.84] before the doctor came on and i
[384.40 - 388.16] i said look
[385.84 - 389.44] it's the scented candles
[388.16 - 393.36] it's the
[389.44 - 396.40] burning fake logs it's the fire pits
[393.36 - 399.44] it's not climate change it's all that's
[396.40 - 401.92] making people sick it's the fire pits
[399.44 - 403.72] it's the colognes it's the perfumes it's
[401.92 - 405.68] the toxic heavy metals it's the
[403.72 - 407.92] pharmaceuticals people are taking it's
[405.68 - 409.92] the fungicides it's the pesticides it's
[407.92 - 414.00] the herbicides and it's making their
[409.92 - 416.24] blood toxic it's the pathogens it's all
[414.00 - 417.76] that stuff and she was like well you
[416.24 - 419.68] know i've been reading up about
[417.76 - 421.68] epstein-barr really because what have
[419.68 - 424.08] you been reading i said to her what have
[421.68 - 425.60] you been reading because guess what up
[424.08 - 427.28] until the medical medium book series
[425.60 - 429.60] nobody knew epstein-barr caused one
[427.28 - 431.76] symptom
[429.60 - 434.24] yeah well i thought i saw an article
[431.76 - 435.92] that they say now that science study
[434.24 - 438.48] recently came out that it's linked to
[435.92 - 440.88] maybe a thyroid problem i go yeah and
[438.48 - 443.84] that was medical medium book one
[440.88 - 446.00] yes it was linked to a thyroid problem
[443.84 - 447.84] yes you're just regurgitating
[446.00 - 449.92] information that came from the book
[447.84 - 453.36] originally oh i guess that must be why
[449.92 - 453.36] the doctor wants to talk to you
[453.76 - 457.04] the thing is you guys what's happening
[455.36 - 458.96] out there by the way listen i'm going to
[457.04 - 460.40] be juicing some pomegranate seeds
[458.96 - 463.76] because
[460.40 - 465.84] you need antioxidants to battle what's
[463.76 - 468.24] happening inside the blood you need
[465.84 - 469.00] phytochemical compounds
[468.24 - 472.64] the
[469.00 - 475.12] anti-juicing people out there
[472.64 - 477.52] are really ridiculous at this point oh
[475.12 - 479.52] no juicing is not good you need to just
[477.52 - 481.04] use a blender or a bullet because you
[479.52 - 482.72] want to preserve everything in there
[481.04 - 485.20] okay real smart
[482.72 - 486.40] because it doesn't do the trick it's not
[485.20 - 488.88] enough
[486.40 - 490.40] almost says so no burning wood the
[488.88 - 493.36] burning wood thing
[490.40 - 495.76] is so toxic to the body
[493.36 - 498.24] you're burning all that wood the fire
[495.76 - 501.04] pits the fireplaces i'm not trying to
[498.24 - 504.08] rain on anybody's parade but literally
[501.04 - 505.68] the human nature wants to burn
[504.08 - 508.72] that's what human nature wants to do
[505.68 - 511.60] they want the gas fire like you go to la
[508.72 - 515.12] and they got the gas fire pits every
[511.60 - 518.48] single house in malibu and wherever
[515.12 - 521.36] every single house all over la all the
[518.48 - 523.68] way down everywhere from up north all in
[521.36 - 526.00] california they're all burning
[523.68 - 528.64] they're all burning the gas
[526.00 - 530.88] the gas fire pits you go into some of
[528.64 - 532.88] these houses and they just boom they
[530.88 - 535.20] click a switch and
[532.88 - 537.76] you've got gas burning flames everywhere
[535.20 - 539.92] right oh it's so nice you kick back oh
[537.76 - 541.52] that's so nice isn't it
[539.92 - 544.40] they're contributing to climate change
[541.52 - 546.08] that's for sure you know what's funny
[544.40 - 547.20] everybody's like climate change climate
[546.08 - 549.52] change
[547.20 - 552.48] but yet everybody's burning everything
[549.52 - 554.48] under the sun they're burning gas
[552.48 - 556.96] they're burning like all their fire pits
[554.48 - 559.60] their gas fire pits their wood by fire
[556.96 - 561.60] pits they're pumping perfume cologne air
[559.60 - 563.20] fresheners pumping into the air they're
[561.60 - 564.96] pumping they're burning scented candles
[563.20 - 566.32] you know the whole thing with the plague
[564.96 - 568.48] the whole thing with the plague has
[566.32 - 570.16] literally propelled everybody to buy a
[568.48 - 571.84] scent to candle and poison themselves
[570.16 - 573.28] and kill themselves
[571.84 - 575.60] it's like i'm running away from the
[573.28 - 577.68] plague so i'm now i'm in my house so i'm
[575.60 - 580.08] gonna now kill myself with some scented
[577.68 - 582.00] candles chemicals and kill myself right
[580.08 - 583.68] there you seem fine to me chris you said
[582.00 - 585.36] you love this topic chris do you see
[583.68 - 587.84] that in california
[585.36 - 589.84] i see that everybody's
[587.84 - 591.68] killing the environment with the scented
[589.84 - 594.32] candles killing the environment with the
[591.68 - 596.24] fire pits
[594.32 - 598.40] i mean it was like
[596.24 - 600.48] you gotta worry about climate change
[598.40 - 603.52] that's the reason why everybody's sick

[1065.68 - 1069.20] you look at somebody later on you're
[1067.76 - 1071.04] years late you look at them when they're
[1069.20 - 1073.36] in their 30s look you can even look at
[1071.04 - 1074.80] politicians whatever you see them
[1073.36 - 1076.32] pictures of them when they were 30 you
[1074.80 - 1077.92] see pictures of them when they're 60
[1076.32 - 1079.92] like what happened your head grew three
[1077.92 - 1082.48] times bigger how did your head grow when
[1079.92 - 1083.60] you don't grow anymore
[1082.48 - 1084.80] it's the same thing with some
[1083.60 - 1086.48] celebrities right you see some
[1084.80 - 1088.40] celebrities like when they're 20 years
[1086.48 - 1089.92] old 25 years old then you see them years
[1088.40 - 1091.52] later and their heads are like twice the
[1089.92 - 1095.84] size like what happened
[1091.52 - 1095.84] from being toxic for too many years
[1096.64 - 1101.68] toxic for too many years toxic blood
[1099.28 - 1103.60] does some crazy ass in the body
[1101.68 - 1106.32] that's what toxic blood does it does
[1103.60 - 1108.80] some crazy ass in the body that's
[1106.32 - 1111.44] what toxic blood does i mean it's really
[1108.80 - 1113.68] incredible how it works right
[1111.44 - 1115.84] but no no no you don't need to cleanse
[1113.68 - 1118.24] no you don't need to cleanse you guys
[1115.84 - 1120.08] just eat a balanced diet whatever you
[1118.24 - 1122.00] think is balanced let's do that let's
[1120.08 - 1123.28] trust everybody on what they think is
[1122.00 - 1126.80] balance
[1123.28 - 1126.80] right we can do that
[1126.96 - 1131.04] yeah
[1127.92 - 1135.04] it's not fat i'm talking about their
[1131.04 - 1136.88] heads don't explode because of fat you
[1135.04 - 1139.04] need to know that that's part of it
[1136.88 - 1140.40] because the brain does gather fat so
[1139.04 - 1142.80] there's too much fat in the brain
[1140.40 - 1146.96] meaning additional fat but it's not just
[1142.80 - 1148.56] about its swelling they got so toxic
[1146.96 - 1152.40] that their head
[1148.56 - 1155.20] swelled up it's swollen their head got
[1152.40 - 1158.48] so swollen that it enlarged that's why
[1155.20 - 1160.64] the person's head is twice the size or a
[1158.48 - 1163.76] third size bigger or a quarter size
[1160.64 - 1167.12] bigger than it was back 20 30 years ago
[1163.76 - 1169.84] because the swelling became so chronic
[1167.12 - 1172.40] that the head had to make room for it so
[1169.84 - 1174.96] the head had to expand like the whole
[1172.40 - 1180.24] head expanded to make room for that
[1174.96 - 1180.24] swelling that's from toxic blood right
[1180.40 - 1186.24] ken's ken lewis says i was so swelled up
[1182.80 - 1188.48] but you don't need a cleanse no

[1222.40 - 1226.00] implant in another root canal
[1226.40 - 1231.28] what happens is that we get toxic we
[1228.96 - 1233.84] don't know what a balanced diet is we
[1231.28 - 1237.44] don't know what's going on but we just
[1233.84 - 1238.40] turn into a toxic mess as the decades go
[1237.44 - 1240.32] by
[1238.40 - 1241.68] and that's what happens
[1240.32 - 1243.92] you guys
[1241.68 - 1246.40] and that's what happens
[1243.92 - 1247.44] frederick says wouldn't it be
[1246.40 - 1250.24] head
[1247.44 - 1252.24] lymphatics too
[1250.24 - 1254.32] lymphatic system runs through your head
[1252.24 - 1257.04] not all of your head but it runs through
[1254.32 - 1258.80] a part of it yeah that swells up too
[1257.04 - 1260.16] being toxic
[1258.80 - 1262.72] absolutely
[1260.16 - 1265.12] but it's more than that your spinal
[1262.72 - 1268.48] fluid becomes toxic
[1265.12 - 1270.88] your spinal fluid becomes toxic that's
[1268.48 - 1273.28] two that's the one there too
[1270.88 - 1275.04] you got no room for the spinal fluid
[1273.28 - 1277.92] anymore
[1275.04 - 1281.44] the spinal fluid gets full of so many
[1277.92 - 1283.68] poisons and toxins it slowly graduates
[1281.44 - 1286.32] into everything needs to make room and
[1283.68 - 1288.16] that person's head is now so big
[1286.32 - 1290.72] compared to what it used to be 30 years
[1288.16 - 1292.88] ago their head is big now
[1290.72 - 1295.84] but they stopped growing 30 years ago
[1292.88 - 1298.56] but their head swelled up
[1295.84 - 1300.40] because of the spinal fluid too it's not
[1298.56 - 1302.80] just lymph lymph it's just this much of
[1300.40 - 1305.04] it spinal fluid is a big part of it and
[1302.80 - 1307.84] then there's other stuff too and blood
[1305.04 - 1310.08] is the really big part of it blood being
[1307.84 - 1312.96] toxic for so long that your blood
[1310.08 - 1316.88] vessels just start to swell everything
[1312.96 - 1318.80] expands even your skull starts to expand
[1316.88 - 1320.48] and then it weakens
[1318.80 - 1323.52] so then you're walking along and you're
[1320.48 - 1326.08] 60 years old you're walking along right
[1323.52 - 1328.24] oh and you slip down and then boom you

[1371.04 - 1374.80] blood analysis if you had toxic blood
[1373.12 - 1376.48] nothing because you would see nothing in
[1374.80 - 1378.88] a live blood analysis because they don't
[1376.48 - 1380.48] know what toxins are looking for
[1378.88 - 1382.72] the only thing you can see in the blood
[1380.48 - 1385.20] is what you're actually you can look for
[1382.72 - 1387.52] what you can actually look for
[1385.20 - 1388.40] they can't look for a metal on a live
[1387.52 - 1390.96] analysis
[1388.40 - 1392.72] they can't see it they can't look for
[1390.96 - 1394.56] air freshener chemicals in a live
[1392.72 - 1397.28] analysis they can't look for scented
[1394.56 - 1399.60] candle poisons in a live analysis they
[1397.28 - 1401.76] can't look for smoke you breathe in from
[1399.60 - 1403.84] somebody's chimney next door all night
[1401.76 - 1407.44] long sifting in through your apartment
[1403.84 - 1409.20] in your house they can't see any of that
[1407.44 - 1412.16] they can't
[1409.20 - 1413.52] and that's one of the problems
[1412.16 - 1415.84] blood tests

[1450.72 - 1453.76] say we don't have to cleanse i went to a
[1452.56 - 1455.20] health professional and they said you
[1453.76 - 1456.64] don't have to cleanse you hear that we
[1455.20 - 1459.84] don't have to cleanse right now right we
[1456.64 - 1459.84] don't have to cleanse
[1460.16 - 1464.00] and then
[1461.52 - 1465.84] you're good until you're not
[1464.00 - 1468.40] everything's okay
[1465.84 - 1470.64] until it's not
[1468.40 - 1473.12] you're healthy
[1470.64 - 1475.44] until you're not
[1473.12 - 1478.24] the whole bit frederick says the problem
[1475.44 - 1480.48] is metal in the organs though not the
[1478.24 - 1482.88] blood right correct
[1480.48 - 1485.60] there's still some metal in the blood
[1482.88 - 1488.32] but it settles in the organs
[1485.60 - 1490.88] sits in the organs and rots frederick
[1488.32 - 1493.76] spot on that's exactly the information
[1490.88 - 1493.76] the metal sits
[1495.52 - 1501.28] and the metal sits in the liver too
[1497.92 - 1504.16] builds up builds up builds up and then
[1501.28 - 1506.96] kind of releases a little bit
[1504.16 - 1508.96] right so it does releases a little bit
[1506.96 - 1511.84] gets to the brain and then sits in the
[1508.96 - 1513.52] brain and builds up and builds up
[1511.84 - 1515.52] sometimes there's some highway in
[1513.52 - 1518.56] between
[1515.52 - 1518.56] but it builds up
[1519.28 - 1524.16] just eating moderation
[1521.44 - 1526.80] i'm gonna have more cow
[1524.16 - 1528.72] lots more cow
[1526.80 - 1530.96] well it's moderation i'm gonna have a
[1528.72 - 1533.28] big burger every night a grass-fed beef
[1530.96 - 1535.12] burger every single night
[1533.28 - 1536.96] i'm not anti-animal protein i'm not
[1535.12 - 1539.04] anti-vegan you can same thing with
[1536.96 - 1541.20] vegans i'm gonna have five more avocados
[1539.04 - 1542.40] tonight the liver gets stagnant and
[1541.20 - 1544.64] sluggish
[1542.40 - 1546.64] and then it spills out the poison after
[1544.64 - 1548.08] a while it gets stagnant and sluggish
[1546.64 - 1549.44] it's your filter and it can't filter
[1548.08 - 1551.28] anymore so your liver can't filter
[1549.44 - 1553.28] anymore and it's spilling out the poison
[1551.28 - 1554.96] now because it can't filter anymore so
[1553.28 - 1557.20] your liver is just spilling out poison
[1554.96 - 1560.24] because it can't filter anymore there's
[1557.20 - 1562.48] no way it can filter anymore
[1560.24 - 1564.48] and that's what happens with the liver
[1562.48 - 1566.08] right
[1564.48 - 1567.76] and then we don't know what to do and
[1566.08 - 1570.00] you can't change the filter let me just
[1567.76 - 1571.60] go change the filter
[1570.00 - 1573.36] let me do that
[1571.60 - 1574.88] it's like i'm gonna go to a clinic and
[1573.36 - 1575.84] they're gonna change my filter hold on
[1574.88 - 1578.32] you guys
[1575.84 - 1580.88] just gonna get my filter replaced here
[1578.32 - 1583.60] you can't change this filter
[1580.88 - 1586.16] it's not changeable you have to cleanse
[1583.60 - 1587.20] it we have to get a juice in us once in
[1586.16 - 1588.48] a while
[1587.20 - 1590.48] it's not
[1588.48 - 1591.52] we're up against things we've never been
[1590.48 - 1593.68] up again
[1591.52 - 1596.32] against ever before in our history we're
[1593.68 - 1597.76] up against more poison more problems
[1596.32 - 1600.56] than we've ever been up against in our
[1597.76 - 1603.36] history we can't just change our filter
[1600.56 - 1605.68] we have to clean it we have to clean it
[1603.36 - 1607.12] you guys there's new chemicals man
[1605.68 - 1608.48] there's new chemicals every day they're
[1607.12 - 1610.08] making
[1608.48 - 1611.28] the chemical
[1610.08 - 1613.12] industry
[1611.28 - 1615.28] is sitting there
[1613.12 - 1617.04] making a new chemical
[1615.28 - 1618.16] every day
[1617.04 - 1620.48] right
[1618.16 - 1622.40] it never gets tested
[1620.48 - 1623.36] they don't know if it can kill you or
[1622.40 - 1624.96] not
[1623.36 - 1627.76] and they release it
[1624.96 - 1630.24] and it's in your perfume
[1627.76 - 1632.40] your perfume
[1630.24 - 1635.92] your perfume
[1632.40 - 1638.16] your scented candle your fragrance
[1635.92 - 1641.36] it's in your
[1638.16 - 1643.68] gmo food even
[1641.36 - 1645.36] it's everywhere
[1643.68 - 1647.20] okay
[1645.36 - 1648.88] and
[1647.20 - 1650.72] these things build up our system for
[1648.88 - 1652.00] years and years and years
[1650.72 - 1655.20] they do
[1652.00 - 1657.20] let's do some juicing
[1655.20 - 1658.96] it's critical so what i'm going to do is
[1657.20 - 1660.16] look i'll run a little bit of celery
[1658.96 - 1662.64] through here i think that's what i want
[1660.16 - 1662.64] to do now
[1665.20 - 1670.88] what i love about celery
[1668.96 - 1672.64] they said nobody's drinking it you know
[1670.88 - 1674.64] what i love about celery i'm gonna be a
[1672.64 - 1677.52] little sarcasm here right no one's
[1674.64 - 1678.96] shrinking it nobody all right
[1677.52 - 1680.24] no one wants to talk about it because no
[1678.96 - 1682.24] one's drinking it
[1680.24 - 1684.40] youtubers stop talking about it because
[1682.24 - 1686.00] no one's drinking it no one's drinking
[1684.40 - 1687.44] celery at all
[1686.00 - 1689.28] meanwhile
[1687.44 - 1690.72] a couple of the biggest corporations and
[1689.28 - 1693.04] food on the planet are putting out
[1690.72 - 1695.44] celery juices pretty soon
[1693.04 - 1697.92] because the whole world's drinking it
[1695.44 - 1700.16] it's going to be more popular than soda
[1697.92 - 1702.72] down the road right
[1700.16 - 1704.32] and because everybody is drinking it
[1702.72 - 1706.40] and a lot of people are just hiding that
[1704.32 - 1708.32] they drink it every single juice bar
[1706.40 - 1710.40] it's their number one drink
[1708.32 - 1712.40] every single juice bar on the planet
[1710.40 - 1716.32] right now sells more celery juice than
[1712.40 - 1716.32] anything single juice there is
[1716.48 - 1720.32] there's more celery juice in the
[1718.00 - 1722.16] supermarkets being sold you know the
[1720.32 - 1725.60] fake ones with the hpp not the fresh
[1722.16 - 1728.80] ones every single day it is the largest
[1725.60 - 1731.04] crop in produce on the planet they can't
[1728.80 - 1734.96] grow enough of it
[1731.04 - 1737.04] thousands of farms every single day
[1734.96 - 1739.28] are being like are putting this stuff
[1737.04 - 1741.76] out you don't want hpp what i love about
[1739.28 - 1746.08] doing it this way
[1741.76 - 1748.32] it's this isn't hpp you guys hpp is no
[1746.08 - 1751.44] good for me
[1748.32 - 1754.40] hpp is high pressure past graduation you
[1751.44 - 1755.60] can't use high pressure pasteurization
[1754.40 - 1757.76] with
[1755.60 - 1760.48] celery juice
[1757.76 - 1762.72] you can't do hpp it can't be high
[1760.48 - 1764.40] pressure pasteurization because i'll
[1762.72 - 1767.52] tell you what that is
[1764.40 - 1769.44] it kills the phytochemical compounds so
[1767.52 - 1772.40] you can get healthy
[1769.44 - 1774.56] yes stay away from hpp
[1772.40 - 1776.40] you know what you can probably drink
[1774.56 - 1778.48] something in hpp
[1776.40 - 1780.80] and it'd be okay
[1778.48 - 1782.08] but not celery juice it has to be juiced
[1780.80 - 1784.00] fresh
[1782.08 - 1786.64] it has to be you got your juicer

[2189.20 - 2193.84] very important to do okay
[2191.92 - 2196.40] you have to strain it
[2193.84 - 2198.08] you can't add anything to it it's not
[2196.40 - 2200.00] gonna work
[2198.08 - 2201.76] so you say that the plastic is more safe
[2200.00 - 2204.40] than stainless steel so
[2201.76 - 2206.32] no way i don't trust plastics at all
[2204.40 - 2208.16] it's fine if you don't trust blast lucas
[2206.32 - 2210.24] it's fine okay
[2208.16 - 2211.12] but here's how it works right
[2210.24 - 2212.64] so
[2211.12 - 2214.96] metal on metal so let me show you
[2212.64 - 2216.80] something i don't have
[2214.96 - 2219.36] i don't have
[2216.80 - 2222.08] gears right now in front of me with the
[2219.36 - 2225.20] other juicers okay but i'm gonna make
[2222.08 - 2225.20] two gears for you

[2226.84 - 2232.08] plastic this is bpa free plastic that
[2230.08 - 2233.28] the juice is touching there's a
[2232.08 - 2235.60] difference
[2233.28 - 2237.92] this is not cheap plastic so that's
[2235.60 - 2240.48] important to know okay that's a metal
[2237.92 - 2244.64] gear i just made so i'm making a mock

[2342.64 - 2347.20] you know what metal on metal is
[2344.56 - 2348.84] it's like your brake pads hitting your
[2347.20 - 2350.80] rotor and you hear
[2348.84 - 2353.60] [Music]
[2350.80 - 2356.48] tiny particles of metal are going into
[2353.60 - 2359.04] your juice as each month goes by each
[2356.48 - 2360.56] week goes by each years go by lucas are
[2359.04 - 2363.12] you seeing this

[2365.12 - 2369.92] oh wait there you are yes but what about
[2366.88 - 2371.20] plastic can't wait to tell you
[2369.92 - 2372.72] okay
[2371.20 - 2376.16] metal
[2372.72 - 2378.24] takes a lot to get out of your body
[2376.16 - 2380.32] it gets into your organs into your
[2378.24 - 2382.40] intestinal lining it gets into your
[2380.32 - 2385.44] liver it gets into your brain
[2382.40 - 2387.52] metal doesn't come out of the body easy
[2385.44 - 2390.64] so here you are you're juicing with your
[2387.52 - 2392.80] metal juicers there you go and your one
[2390.64 - 2395.12] more year goes by and you're now eating
[2392.80 - 2397.28] more metal another year goes by oh i'm
[2395.12 - 2399.28] getting healthy i'm drinking my juices
[2397.28 - 2400.64] and you're getting more metal eventually
[2399.28 - 2403.36] that metal is going to build up in your
[2400.64 - 2406.08] liver your brain your intestinal tract
[2403.36 - 2406.08] see how it works
[2406.72 - 2410.28] that's how it works
[2410.32 - 2413.28] and what happens and people don't
[2411.84 - 2415.20] realize
[2413.28 - 2417.28] is that there's a difference this isn't
[2415.20 - 2420.48] cheap plastic
[2417.28 - 2422.16] this is high quality technology plastic
[2420.48 - 2425.20] bpa free
[2422.16 - 2428.24] and any plastic residue from anything
[2425.20 - 2431.28] plastic even bad plastics because this
[2428.24 - 2432.80] isn't bad plastic bad plastic
[2431.28 - 2434.80] still comes out of the body with
[2432.80 - 2436.88] cleansing
[2434.80 - 2440.00] your juice
[2436.88 - 2441.92] literally can take any plastic you've if
[2440.00 - 2444.40] you ate plastic from fast food
[2441.92 - 2446.64] restaurants from 10 years ago and that
[2444.40 - 2448.40] plastic is still in you your juice that
[2446.64 - 2450.56] you're juicing from something high
[2448.40 - 2452.40] quality like this is taking that plastic
[2450.56 - 2454.88] out of your body from 10 years ago but
[2452.40 - 2454.88] get this
[2455.04 - 2459.20] you know how hard it is to get metal out
[2457.44 - 2461.76] you got to do the medical medium heavy
[2459.20 - 2464.56] metal detox smoothie you got to do the
[2461.76 - 2467.20] wild blueberry you got it's hard to get
[2464.56 - 2469.12] metal out
[2467.20 - 2471.52] and here you are with all the different
[2469.12 - 2473.92] juicers with all the metal the
[2471.52 - 2476.48] centrifuge metal
[2473.92 - 2478.00] the the gears of metal
[2476.48 - 2479.60] and that's what people don't really
[2478.00 - 2481.52] understand
[2479.60 - 2482.72] and guess what someone left a comment on
[2481.52 - 2484.64] youtube
[2482.72 - 2486.08] on youtube i think on the last one you
[2484.64 - 2487.68] guys could go look for if you want right
[2486.08 - 2489.68] somebody left a comment
[2487.68 - 2492.08] saying they were using the metal juicers
[2489.68 - 2494.16] for years
[2492.08 - 2496.40] and they couldn't get results and then
[2494.16 - 2498.32] they switched and they got results
[2496.40 - 2500.56] because they were stopping to get metal
[2498.32 - 2502.00] poisoned
[2500.56 - 2504.16] right
[2502.00 - 2507.04] pk good to see you i see you leave
[2504.16 - 2508.48] comments every now and youtube
[2507.04 - 2509.84] so the point is
[2508.48 - 2512.40] is that you got to think about that and
[2509.84 - 2513.84] how that works like the difference
[2512.40 - 2516.16] this isn't even about choosing you know
[2513.84 - 2519.12] what is this is about information that's
[2516.16 - 2521.44] critical when i think about it right
[2519.12 - 2524.48] so these are great if the metal gears
[2521.44 - 2526.24] were fine i'd be having metal gears man
[2524.48 - 2528.80] i'd be like yeah give me the metal gears
[2526.24 - 2531.04] give me the metal gears
[2528.80 - 2533.04] i'll take the metal gears they're fine
[2531.04 - 2533.84] they're safe why wouldn't i use them
[2533.04 - 2535.76] then
[2533.84 - 2538.32] you'd see a juicer here with metal gears
[2535.76 - 2538.32] right here
[2538.48 - 2542.80] but you're not going to see that
[2541.04 - 2545.36] i think i had a little too much celery
[2542.80 - 2550.04] for us today
[2545.36 - 2550.04] sorry you guys what happens is
[2550.40 - 2555.28] i took like six celery force before i
[2552.40 - 2555.28] came on today
[2556.32 - 2559.44] what happens when i'm trying to pour
[2558.00 - 2560.96] this and the juicer's in the way because
[2559.44 - 2562.56] i'm trying to do it on camera right here
[2560.96 - 2563.84] and i don't want to pour it over there i
[2562.56 - 2565.92] want you guys to be able to see it i end
[2563.84 - 2568.00] up spilling a little because
[2565.92 - 2570.88] everything's in my way over here
[2568.00 - 2570.88] just bear with me
[2573.68 - 2577.04] when you guys pour your juice out try
[2575.44 - 2579.36] not to do it jammed up against your
[2577.04 - 2581.28] juicer try to pour like try to give
[2579.36 - 2584.48] yourself room so you just don't knock it
[2581.28 - 2584.48] everywhere like i just did
[2586.16 - 2589.52] you want to strain it you don't want to
[2587.76 - 2591.12] add lemon you don't want to add anything
[2589.52 - 2593.12] you don't want to add water or ice or
[2591.12 - 2594.96] nothing into it let the sodium cluster
[2593.12 - 2596.24] salts flush out the liver and clean the
[2594.96 - 2598.64] body
[2596.24 - 2599.92] that's really important to know
[2598.64 - 2602.32] okay
[2599.92 - 2604.32] blenders don't have metal gears grinding
[2602.32 - 2605.44] against each other keep that i saw that
[2604.32 - 2609.52] question
[2605.44 - 2611.52] blenders don't have metal gears grinding
[2609.52 - 2613.76] against each other
[2611.52 - 2615.60] so blenders don't have metal gears
[2613.76 - 2617.20] grinding against each other i know
[2615.60 - 2618.56] someone said well what about the metal
[2617.20 - 2620.08] in a blender
[2618.56 - 2622.72] i love answering these questions because
[2620.08 - 2624.08] i want to help i really do i want to
[2622.72 - 2625.60] help i want to help get your brain
[2624.08 - 2627.20] cleaned up i want to help get your liver
[2625.60 - 2628.08] cleaned up i want to help get you guys
[2627.20 - 2630.88] better
[2628.08 - 2632.48] is what i want how do you strain your
[2630.88 - 2634.80] juice
[2632.48 - 2636.96] you just use a strainer i'd use a mesh
[2634.80 - 2638.16] strainer right here that's what i do i
[2636.96 - 2640.00] use a mesh
[2638.16 - 2642.40] strainer is what i do you can do
[2640.00 - 2644.16] different ways of trying to strain it
[2642.40 - 2646.40] but it's important to strain it because
[2644.16 - 2648.88] celery juice has to be
[2646.40 - 2650.88] has to be on its own it has to be by
[2648.88 - 2652.56] itself the juice it's an herbal
[2650.88 - 2654.88] extraction so what you're looking at
[2652.56 - 2657.20] here you guys is an herbal
[2654.88 - 2659.44] medicine extractor
[2657.20 - 2660.88] that's what you're looking at
[2659.44 - 2664.40] celery
[2660.88 - 2667.92] is an herb it's not a vegetable when you
[2664.40 - 2672.24] use herbs to heal life changes so what i
[2667.92 - 2673.92] love doing i love juicing parsley
[2672.24 - 2676.40] through this juicer
[2673.92 - 2678.00] i love doing that like i do like one or
[2676.40 - 2680.32] two celery sticks and then i throw some
[2678.00 - 2682.56] parsley in there i love doing parsley
[2680.32 - 2684.08] because you're juicing herbs this is an
[2682.56 - 2685.04] herb
[2684.08 - 2687.60] this is a
[2685.04 - 2689.28] herbal medicine maker right here
[2687.60 - 2691.84] that's what this is which is really
[2689.28 - 2693.20] great let's do some pomegranate seeds
[2691.84 - 2694.96] i don't want to bore you guys with a
[2693.20 - 2697.76] three minute clean out with this so what
[2694.96 - 2697.76] i'm gonna do is
[2698.00 - 2703.40] i'm gonna pop off pop up another one
[2700.16 - 2703.40] real quick

[2707.52 - 2712.08] pomegranate juice for fun we're going to
[2709.60 - 2713.00] talk about toxic blood
[2712.08 - 2716.32] we need
[2713.00 - 2718.40] antioxidants to stop oxidizing so let's
[2716.32 - 2721.44] talk about that right now i think that's
[2718.40 - 2721.44] really important okay
[2723.68 - 2727.12] everybody's slowly dying
[2727.60 - 2731.52] everybody
[2729.44 - 2734.32] is slowly dying
[2731.52 - 2737.52] on the planet
[2734.32 - 2739.92] it's death by a thousand cuts
[2737.52 - 2742.64] they poison us
[2739.92 - 2744.84] the industry is poisonous
[2742.64 - 2749.04] the pharmaceutical companies poison
[2744.84 - 2750.16] us the chemical industries poison us
[2749.04 - 2751.68] right
[2750.16 - 2754.24] the illumination
[2751.68 - 2756.96] flying all the jet planes in the sky
[2754.24 - 2758.88] dropping chemicals down on us is
[2756.96 - 2761.20] poisoning us
[2758.88 - 2762.88] right all the different household
[2761.20 - 2765.44] antagonists
[2762.88 - 2767.20] that we're actually taking and and doing
[2765.44 - 2768.48] and spraying on ourselves and cleaning
[2767.20 - 2770.00] supplies and carpet cleaners are
[2768.48 - 2771.20] poisoning us
[2770.00 - 2774.56] right
[2771.20 - 2777.52] the water supplies are poisoning us
[2774.56 - 2779.28] the smoke in the air is poisoning us
[2777.52 - 2782.00] there's always some pyros that are
[2779.28 - 2783.76] purposely paid to like the worst fires
[2782.00 - 2785.84] in the state of california there's
[2783.76 - 2788.64] always pyros that are that are paid to
[2785.84 - 2790.80] like the worst fires in australia and
[2788.64 - 2793.28] everywhere else so everything just burns
[2790.80 - 2795.52] down and forests burned down and the
[2793.28 - 2797.60] planet just just basically a planet just
[2795.52 - 2800.08] declines and all that with all that
[2797.60 - 2803.28] smoke right
[2800.08 - 2804.56] we go around
[2803.28 - 2806.48] and
[2804.56 - 2809.36] we slowly die
[2806.48 - 2813.76] because of mankind
[2809.36 - 2817.12] evil mankind the evil part of it
[2813.76 - 2818.40] the evil ones at the top the echelon the
[2817.12 - 2821.36] high echelon
[2818.40 - 2824.56] they literally want you to die
[2821.36 - 2826.96] slowly so they kill us slowly with all
[2824.56 - 2826.96] of this
[2827.84 - 2830.56] and then we're not getting enough
[2829.12 - 2833.36] antioxidants
[2830.56 - 2835.68] in us to battle it
[2833.36 - 2839.20] so we're not getting enough antioxidants
[2835.68 - 2839.20] in us to fight
[2839.28 - 2844.72] what i love about the juicer or a juicer
[2842.72 - 2849.04] forget this juicer
[2844.72 - 2851.12] just any juicer you got a juicer use it
[2849.04 - 2853.52] any juicer
[2851.12 - 2854.80] what i love about the juicing like
[2853.52 - 2856.88] juicing
[2854.80 - 2859.44] is you're getting something out of the
[2856.88 - 2861.52] food you can't do if you just eat the
[2859.44 - 2863.28] food and chew it
[2861.52 - 2865.76] you can't get enough if you do it this
[2863.28 - 2867.28] way we're like you can't get enough that
[2865.76 - 2869.28] way
[2867.28 - 2872.16] and so and you can't get enough by
[2869.28 - 2874.08] saying i'm gonna have a pomegranate here
[2872.16 - 2874.80] do you want to share my pomegranate with
[2874.08 - 2875.76] me
[2874.80 - 2877.84] right
[2875.76 - 2880.64] i'm dr jonzo and i learned that
[2877.84 - 2881.84] pomegranates are good for you and hey do
[2880.64 - 2883.92] you want to share this beautiful
[2881.84 - 2885.84] pomegranate with me have a little bit
[2883.92 - 2887.84] here have a slice that should be enough
[2885.84 - 2889.60] antioxidant for you you don't need more
[2887.84 - 2891.68] than that you need my colostrum
[2889.60 - 2894.08] supplement
[2891.68 - 2896.56] you need more than that you need more
[2894.08 - 2897.92] than a little bit of this and a little
[2896.56 - 2900.80] bit of that
[2897.92 - 2902.96] and a little bit of this you need more
[2900.80 - 2904.64] than just a piece of an orange once in a
[2902.96 - 2906.72] while you know what i mean you need more
[2904.64 - 2908.40] than that
[2906.72 - 2911.20] and so what happens is in order to
[2908.40 - 2913.84] battle what the death by a thousand cuts
[2911.20 - 2915.76] are doing out there and then the health
[2913.84 - 2917.60] movement they're doing death by a
[2915.76 - 2919.36] thousand cuts to everybody too they're
[2917.60 - 2921.12] poisoning everybody with the vinegar
[2919.36 - 2922.72] poisoning everybody with the caffeine
[2921.12 - 2924.08] the health movement yeah alternate
[2922.72 - 2925.92] medicine wants everybody dead on
[2924.08 - 2927.68] caffeine they're poisoning everybody
[2925.92 - 2929.76] with caffeine you don't believe me
[2927.68 - 2931.36] it's true the caffeine industry has
[2929.76 - 2933.92] completely taken over the alternative
[2931.36 - 2936.48] health industry they own them now
[2933.92 - 2938.40] they just want you on caffeine 24 7
[2936.48 - 2940.96] right it's there it's death by a
[2938.40 - 2944.08] thousand cuts everywhere you guys so if
[2940.96 - 2946.72] you don't know how to defend yourself
[2944.08 - 2946.72] then what
[2947.28 - 2950.56] what are you gonna do
[2948.80 - 2954.08] and so what i love about the juicing
[2950.56 - 2954.08] it's a way to basically say
[2954.96 - 2958.24] yeah no sorry
[2957.52 - 2959.84] no
[2958.24 - 2962.08] not gonna you know what
[2959.84 - 2964.48] rain all you want on me
[2962.08 - 2966.16] chemicals coming out of the sky
[2964.48 - 2967.36] because you can't say the term anymore
[2966.16 - 2969.52] right
[2967.36 - 2971.52] bringing all you want on me
[2969.52 - 2974.96] all the dioxins
[2971.52 - 2976.56] renal you want on me perfume users
[2974.96 - 2978.08] right because there's pesticides and
[2976.56 - 2979.36] perfumes they're actually made of
[2978.08 - 2981.52] pesticides
[2979.36 - 2984.88] rain all you want on me
[2981.52 - 2987.60] pharmaceutical tap in the tap water
[2984.88 - 2989.76] bring all you want wherever you want
[2987.60 - 2991.68] but i'm going to be battling your ass
[2989.76 - 2994.56] i'm going to be battling you with
[2991.68 - 2996.48] antioxidants antioxidant power because
[2994.56 - 2998.24] here's the problem everybody's dying
[2996.48 - 2999.28] slowly because they're oxidizing did you
[2998.24 - 3001.76] know that
[2999.28 - 3004.64] did you know your brain is oxidizing
[3001.76 - 3007.36] every day it oxidizes that's why
[3004.64 - 3009.44] everybody's brain shrinks that's why
[3007.36 - 3012.08] when i talk to my doctor friends who
[3009.44 - 3013.92] have worked on cadavers they've cut open
[3012.08 - 3015.60] people's heads and they've looked at
[3013.92 - 3017.52] brains they're like oh my god that
[3015.60 - 3019.68] person's brain is half the size it was
[3017.52 - 3024.48] when they were younger what happened
[3019.68 - 3026.56] their brain shrunk it oxidized
[3024.48 - 3029.44] so what happens is the brain just
[3026.56 - 3031.04] reduces in size you get older and did
[3029.44 - 3032.72] you know your brain gets empty in the
[3031.04 - 3034.64] middle of it did you know when everybody
[3032.72 - 3037.04] gets older
[3034.64 - 3038.56] they start getting a hollow brain down
[3037.04 - 3041.52] in here
[3038.56 - 3043.52] a hollow brain they get a gap because as
[3041.52 - 3045.92] they get older everything's oxidizing
[3043.52 - 3049.12] and being eaten on the inside out we
[3045.92 - 3051.44] oxidize so we're all dying slowly here
[3049.12 - 3053.20] while they're poisoning us here and no
[3051.44 - 3056.32] one's really and then you'll hear you
[3053.20 - 3056.32] don't have to juice
[3056.48 - 3060.00] just keep a balanced diet
[3061.92 - 3067.48] let's get a little bit of pomegranate
[3063.76 - 3067.48] juice going you guys
[3068.16 - 3070.56] right
[3071.60 - 3077.12] all right
[3072.96 - 3078.32] dr faun md i see you over there
[3077.12 - 3081.04] amazing
[3078.32 - 3081.04] glad you're here
[3081.28 - 3085.12] you know look i got to tell you guys
[3083.04 - 3087.04] something it's sunday right i'm honored
[3085.12 - 3088.24] you guys are here on your sunday i can't
[3087.04 - 3089.92] even thank you enough for being here
[3088.24 - 3092.08] it's just so great to have you here
[3089.92 - 3096.16] green blue says the head gets bigger the
[3092.08 - 3098.80] brain gets smaller correct 100 percent
[3096.16 - 3101.04] elizabeth right health with liz no one
[3098.80 - 3103.20] talks about that no no one talks about
[3101.04 - 3106.48] that but you know what's funny liz
[3103.20 - 3108.80] on a little personal note right
[3106.48 - 3111.68] all i do is bring new information
[3108.80 - 3113.76] i mean unless i'm wrong unless i'm wrong
[3111.68 - 3115.28] or something and i don't
[3113.76 - 3116.96] but i bring new information and new
[3115.28 - 3118.80] information every single month every
[3116.96 - 3120.72] single week every single year and
[3118.80 - 3123.68] someone will still say he doesn't have
[3120.72 - 3125.12] any new information like what
[3123.68 - 3127.60] what do you think i am the lectin guy
[3125.12 - 3130.24] that only has lectin information for the
[3127.60 - 3132.32] last 10 years and that's all he has
[3130.24 - 3133.84] this is that people don't cite back to
[3132.32 - 3135.20] where the original information comes
[3133.84 - 3137.68] from here
[3135.20 - 3140.00] so then it doesn't seem like i was the
[3137.68 - 3142.40] originator of like these pieces of
[3140.00 - 3144.24] information because it's it gets taken
[3142.40 - 3146.16] out of here so someone takes it and they
[3144.24 - 3150.00] run off with it
[3146.16 - 3150.00] and then they go they run run away
[3150.48 - 3154.88] it's fine the point is is it doesn't
[3153.28 - 3157.20] help others if they don't know where it
[3154.88 - 3159.36] all comes from
[3157.20 - 3161.20] it's just it's really amazing it's
[3159.36 - 3163.20] amazing
[3161.20 - 3166.32] maryland says are you using the green
[3163.20 - 3168.72] ring for prom pomegranate cheese i am
[3166.32 - 3172.16] definitely using it that means you must
[3168.72 - 3172.16] have an mm-900
[3173.04 - 3176.80] so i'm gonna move this celery over here
[3174.96 - 3180.08] and put this on the back here i'm gonna
[3176.80 - 3181.28] get some pomegranate juice going
[3180.08 - 3184.80] right
[3181.28 - 3184.80] you get a little bit of this in here
[3186.00 - 3191.76] i've never heard anywhere in hell
[3188.96 - 3194.32] my whole life 35 years professionally
[3191.76 - 3198.24] doing it i've never heard anybody talk
[3194.32 - 3200.08] about how everybody's heads got bigger
[3198.24 - 3202.56] except ego
[3200.08 - 3204.64] only thing i've ever heard is the ego
[3202.56 - 3206.24] got bigger with somebody's head yeah
[3204.64 - 3208.32] your head's getting too big because of
[3206.24 - 3210.80] your ego that's the only time i've ever
[3208.32 - 3210.80] heard it
[3221.36 - 3225.92] charlie says i've been dabbling with mm
[3223.44 - 3227.84] for three years now hey dabbling's not
[3225.92 - 3229.84] the worst thing to do that's great
[3227.84 - 3231.92] dabbling with mmm for three years now
[3229.84 - 3234.56] and i have reduced many symptoms now i'm
[3231.92 - 3237.76] ready to go all in now and get fantastic
[3234.56 - 3239.20] results charlie lagoa
[3237.76 - 3240.40] cool man
[3239.20 - 3243.92] cool
[3240.40 - 3248.32] listen you're allowed to be a dabbler
[3243.92 - 3250.88] i i welcome medical medium dabblers you
[3248.32 - 3252.72] want to do a little celery juice i stand
[3250.88 - 3255.12] behind you you want to try the medical
[3252.72 - 3256.48] medium smoothies i stand behind you you
[3255.12 - 3258.72] want to you want to look at the
[3256.48 - 3260.80] different angels in the in the medical
[3258.72 - 3263.12] medium first but i stand behind you you
[3260.80 - 3265.36] want to dabble in medical medium i stand
[3263.12 - 3267.44] behind you but whatever you do
[3265.36 - 3269.12] don't write a post one day telling
[3267.44 - 3271.36] anybody that i've been doing medical
[3269.12 - 3274.08] medium for four years and it didn't work
[3271.36 - 3276.72] for me because you're gonna then stop
[3274.08 - 3278.96] someone else from trying medical medium
[3276.72 - 3280.16] and never getting a chance to heal
[3278.96 - 3281.76] and it might have been somebody that
[3280.16 - 3283.44] wasn't gonna be a dabbler they might
[3281.76 - 3285.12] have gone all full in on it and you're
[3283.44 - 3286.80] gonna tell them basically don't do
[3285.12 - 3288.64] medical medium because i did it for four
[3286.80 - 3292.56] years and it didn't fix me
[3288.64 - 3294.32] meanwhile you might have been a dabbler
[3292.56 - 3296.96] basically what i'm saying is it's
[3294.32 - 3299.76] perfectly fine to be a dabbler but thank
[3296.96 - 3301.28] you for actually exactly 100 you i'm
[3299.76 - 3303.28] honored you're here tristan marie said
[3301.28 - 3304.96] my daughter was on here last time
[3303.28 - 3307.92] sending you many hearts
[3304.96 - 3310.48] from her or me all good
[3307.92 - 3310.48] amazing
[3312.08 - 3316.32] it's okay dabbling is fine you guys i
[3314.72 - 3318.88] love you for dabbling
[3316.32 - 3320.32] sounds incredible if anybody wants to go
[3318.88 - 3322.40] full-on they want to go into the
[3320.32 - 3324.24] protocols they want to go deep into it
[3322.40 - 3327.24] i'm i'm totally there
[3324.24 - 3327.24] incredible
[3334.56 - 3337.20] amazing
[3339.12 - 3343.36] so what i'm doing is pomegranate juice
[3340.88 - 3343.36] right now
[3344.48 - 3347.44] what i love about the pot what i love
[3346.08 - 3349.12] about this juicer i'm just going to give
[3347.44 - 3351.92] you a quick run down on the pomegranate
[3349.12 - 3351.92] aspect okay
[3352.80 - 3357.84] that comes out bone dry
[3356.08 - 3359.92] i ran a lot of pomegranate seeds through
[3357.84 - 3362.96] there that comes out bone dry
[3359.92 - 3363.68] okay so that's that's interesting
[3362.96 - 3366.72] so
[3363.68 - 3368.64] that's coming out bone dry
[3366.72 - 3371.52] but here's the difference here's what no
[3368.64 - 3371.52] juicer does
[3371.60 - 3377.20] no juicer
[3374.24 - 3381.20] juices the seed
[3377.20 - 3383.04] they only juice the pulp around the seed
[3381.20 - 3385.84] so that's important to know
[3383.04 - 3387.76] the mm-900 is the only juicer that
[3385.84 - 3389.36] squeezes the chemical compounds the
[3387.76 - 3392.08] fight the antioxidants and phytochemical
[3389.36 - 3393.60] compounds inside the seed
[3392.08 - 3395.28] so keep that in mind
[3393.60 - 3396.80] that means when you drink pomegranate
[3395.28 - 3398.48] juice out there right when you go out
[3396.80 - 3401.20] there and you drink pomegranate juice
[3398.48 - 3402.64] you're not drinking all of the benefits
[3401.20 - 3405.04] you're only drinking
[3402.64 - 3407.20] part of the benefits so when
[3405.04 - 3408.32] pomegranate juice is offered to you out
[3407.20 - 3410.96] there
[3408.32 - 3413.20] it's only half there
[3410.96 - 3414.64] it's not all there
[3413.20 - 3416.00] it's kind of like talking to somebody
[3414.64 - 3417.52] that's lost their mind you know it's
[3416.00 - 3419.20] like they're not all there right you
[3417.52 - 3421.36] ever run into that
[3419.20 - 3423.28] bad things happen they got so much they
[3421.36 - 3425.20] got they got all these
[3423.28 - 3426.56] medals inside their head
[3425.20 - 3427.92] they're getting what people call like
[3426.56 - 3429.60] all old-timers but it's really
[3427.92 - 3432.00] alzheimer's and they're not all there
[3429.60 - 3433.04] it's really sad sad process right which
[3432.00 - 3434.24] happens
[3433.04 - 3435.76] it's like the same thing with
[3434.24 - 3437.52] pomegranate juice you're drinking
[3435.76 - 3440.08] pomegranate juice but only part of it's
[3437.52 - 3441.36] there it's not all there it's just not
[3440.08 - 3442.72] there
[3441.36 - 3444.88] and so what happens is with the
[3442.72 - 3447.52] pomegranate seed you have to juice the
[3444.88 - 3448.72] seed itself and that's how life turns
[3447.52 - 3449.92] around
[3448.72 - 3452.32] to protect you remember i was talking
[3449.92 - 3454.48] about antioxidants battling the you know
[3452.32 - 3458.08] death by a thousand cuts
[3454.48 - 3459.44] all juicers need to be strained
[3458.08 - 3461.20] all juicers
[3459.44 - 3462.96] there's no such thing as well i juiced
[3461.20 - 3464.88] with this juicer but why are you
[3462.96 - 3466.56] straining yours no actually that's a
[3464.88 - 3468.00] technique that all juicers are supposed
[3466.56 - 3469.44] you're supposed to strain the juice
[3468.00 - 3471.12] after every juice
[3469.44 - 3473.04] any juicer you juiced with doesn't
[3471.12 - 3474.88] matter what company what brand
[3473.04 - 3478.08] you have to strain
[3474.88 - 3480.24] the juice you have to strain the celery
[3478.08 - 3482.08] juice you have to so the celery juice
[3480.24 - 3483.84] can work trying to answer questions
[3482.08 - 3486.64] while we're doing some fun stuff and
[3483.84 - 3490.00] talking all right
[3486.64 - 3492.32] let's pour some pomegranate juice out
[3490.00 - 3492.32] here
[3492.96 - 3495.44] there you go
[3497.28 - 3500.80] now the difference with this juicer is
[3499.28 - 3503.92] you're going to squeeze
[3500.80 - 3506.00] much more out of the pomegranate seed
[3503.92 - 3507.20] much more you're going to squeeze the
[3506.00 - 3510.40] seed
[3507.20 - 3512.56] not just the pulp around the seed
[3510.40 - 3516.20] so now you've got a whole other level of
[3512.56 - 3516.20] medicine right here
[3516.32 - 3520.96] and it's a different color
[3519.12 - 3522.40] that's the color pomegranate cheese is
[3520.96 - 3523.68] supposed to be
[3522.40 - 3525.84] so
[3523.68 - 3528.16] keep this in mind if you've ever tried
[3525.84 - 3530.80] pomegranate juice on the shelf
[3528.16 - 3532.40] or anywhere else it's supposed to be
[3530.80 - 3534.16] this color
[3532.40 - 3535.76] it's not supposed to be the fake color
[3534.16 - 3537.84] where it's just
[3535.76 - 3539.92] the part there color
[3537.84 - 3543.12] where it's the color of the juice that
[3539.92 - 3545.28] was around the pulp right
[3543.12 - 3546.64] it's supposed to be the color
[3545.28 - 3550.16] of
[3546.64 - 3552.88] the juice that was inside the seed
[3550.16 - 3555.04] see the seed
[3552.88 - 3556.32] there you go
[3555.04 - 3557.84] that that's an incredible that's
[3556.32 - 3561.28] incredible right there i can't even tell
[3557.84 - 3561.28] you you know when you drink that
[3561.68 - 3565.92] and i got it i got and i got to tell you
[3563.36 - 3568.00] something now
[3565.92 - 3568.96] just know that the pomegranate seeds you
[3568.00 - 3571.28] buy
[3568.96 - 3572.72] that are de-seeded meaning the
[3571.28 - 3574.48] pomegranate you go to the health food
[3572.72 - 3576.64] store go to the grocery store and they
[3574.48 - 3578.96] already have them where the seeds are
[3576.64 - 3580.80] out of the pomegranate like they used
[3578.96 - 3582.40] equipment to get the seeds out of the
[3580.80 - 3584.56] pomegranate
[3582.40 - 3586.56] just know that when you buy it that way
[3584.56 - 3588.88] it's been laced
[3586.56 - 3591.28] with a preservative
[3588.88 - 3593.76] from a chemical company that they give
[3591.28 - 3596.56] these food companies to lace them with
[3593.76 - 3599.20] as a preservative so
[3596.56 - 3602.72] it's best to buy them this way
[3599.20 - 3605.04] if you do buy the seeds by themselves in
[3602.72 - 3606.88] the grocery stores because they already
[3605.04 - 3608.16] were shelled and the seeds were put into
[3606.88 - 3609.84] a package and you're like whoa
[3608.16 - 3612.32] pomegranate seeds already done for me
[3609.84 - 3615.84] and you buy the package
[3612.32 - 3615.84] rinse them really well
[3616.16 - 3619.76] rinse them really well because they're
[3618.56 - 3622.40] sprayed
[3619.76 - 3624.96] with a preservative chemical
[3622.40 - 3628.48] on them that's why i love making sure
[3624.96 - 3631.28] you get them from your pomegranates here
[3628.48 - 3633.12] okay cordina says please help
[3631.28 - 3634.48] love celery juice but makes me so
[3633.12 - 3636.24] nauseous
[3634.48 - 3638.64] so
[3636.24 - 3639.84] is the astringency so you might be
[3638.64 - 3643.52] somebody that doesn't like anything
[3639.84 - 3646.48] bitter would parsley make you nauseous
[3643.52 - 3648.48] probably right anything astringent
[3646.48 - 3651.92] is that what it is like if someone made
[3648.48 - 3651.92] parsley juice you'd probably be like
[3652.16 - 3655.28] i can't drink this
[3654.16 - 3657.52] right
[3655.28 - 3659.36] were you ever nauseous before so your
[3657.52 - 3660.64] whole life so this is something i want
[3659.36 - 3662.88] you to be your own detective were you
[3660.64 - 3663.84] ever nauseous before
[3662.88 - 3665.36] ever
[3663.84 - 3667.52] with anything like were you nauseous
[3665.36 - 3669.44] last week with some other type of food
[3667.52 - 3670.56] were you nauseous yesterday when you had
[3669.44 - 3672.48] some dinner
[3670.56 - 3674.32] were you nauseous the other day when you
[3672.48 - 3676.24] got when you were talking to a friend
[3674.32 - 3677.84] and for some reason you you know
[3676.24 - 3680.32] whatever or something's happening like
[3677.84 - 3682.64] were you nauseous anyway
[3680.32 - 3683.76] did you get the point is is did you go
[3682.64 - 3685.36] through your whole life you're never
[3683.76 - 3686.72] nauseous ever and then you sip some
[3685.36 - 3688.80] celery juice and it was the first time
[3686.72 - 3691.28] ever you got nauseous or you're somebody
[3688.80 - 3693.28] that gets nauseous pretty easy and you
[3691.28 - 3694.96] can get triggered easy so if you had
[3693.28 - 3696.64] something like celery juice because it's
[3694.96 - 3698.40] so astringent
[3696.64 - 3700.16] and the taste is kind of shocking for
[3698.40 - 3701.68] some people it made you nauseous because
[3700.16 - 3703.12] you're already somebody that's sensitive
[3701.68 - 3705.44] and you actually get nauseous all the
[3703.12 - 3707.76] time i want you to be your own detective
[3705.44 - 3710.16] what i would do if i was nauseous from
[3707.76 - 3713.28] it i would start with two ounces then
[3710.16 - 3714.88] two ounces i would do just two ounces
[3713.28 - 3717.36] that would that would be a little little
[3714.88 - 3719.68] shot glass two ounces right i'll go get
[3717.36 - 3722.24] a shot glass right now
[3719.68 - 3723.28] so if i was somebody that was nauseous
[3722.24 - 3726.48] by it
[3723.28 - 3729.36] i would start really small
[3726.48 - 3732.48] that's what i would do
[3729.36 - 3734.96] so cordina says i do have a sensitive
[3732.48 - 3736.80] stomach in general so that's why so it's
[3734.96 - 3739.36] it's just because you have a sensitive
[3736.80 - 3740.48] stomach in general right
[3739.36 - 3741.28] exactly
[3740.48 - 3743.04] so
[3741.28 - 3745.52] what i would do if that's the case is i
[3743.04 - 3747.84] would take a shot class
[3745.52 - 3749.12] and i would just do like one ounce two
[3747.84 - 3751.44] ounces
[3749.12 - 3753.12] maybe just do that and try that
[3751.44 - 3754.80] this has been like so fun you guys i
[3753.12 - 3756.48] love answering questions i want to help
[3754.80 - 3759.28] in any way i can
