00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,000
but that's it right there it's all the

367
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,720
fat can't eat that pizza lots of carbs

368
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,040
man I got to back down on my sugar I'm

369
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,480
backing down on the pizza dude you're

370
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,880
backing down on the

371
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,079
fat that's the point because no one's

372
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,560
just eating sugar no one is eating just

373
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:14,759
sugar it's not happening on any level it

374
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,040
does not happen if you're eating bowls

375
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,639
and bowls of sugar in the morning then

376
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,800
you're the only person on this planet

377
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,920
doing

378
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:26,319
it only person on this planet that's

379
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,319
doing

380
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:34,360
it if you're eating a big old bowl of

381
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:38,839
sugar you're the only one on this entire

382
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:43,000
planet only one and even if some dude is

383
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:45,759
in a sugar cane field and he hacks a big

384
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,680
stock of the fresh sugar cane and he

385
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,880
presses it through a press and it juices

386
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:56,279
the sugar cane into a big old

387
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:59,759
Bowl guess what that's part sugar big

388
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:02,639
part of all water Trace minerals

389
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,559
nutrients phytochemical compounds the

390
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:10,039
sugar is this much everything else is

391
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:13,679
there the sugar is this much everything

392
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:17,000
else is there in there you see no one

393
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,439
eats straight sugar like that in the

394
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,959
morning it doesn't exist but you sure as

395
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,760
hell can think they do if I did not know

396
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,960
anything if I came off of a

397
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:32,400
spacecraft if I was abducted to 20 years

398
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,559
ago by some alien race and I and they

399
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
had me up there and they were

400
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,280
experimenting on me and doing whatever

401
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,799
and they decided to let me go 20 years

402
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,880
later and drop my butt off and I was

403
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,400
dropped off I didn't know nothing or 40

404
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,240
years later didn't know nothing or I 50

405
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,320
years whatever if they abducted me when

406
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,000
I was 2 years old and dropped me off now

407
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,799
I would think everybody was eating tons

408
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,159
and tons of bowls and bowls of sugar I'd

409
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,000
be on the internet like whoa this person

410
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,640
quit carbs whoa this person quit sugar

411
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,280
whoa this person's off their sugar I'd

412
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,640
be like whoa what was everybody doing

413
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,640
eating piles and piles of sugar and

414
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:11,680
that's how ridiculous it is Brad says

415
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,520
no carbs turn fat into

416
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,600
[Music]

417
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:20,320
[Laughter]

418
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:25,159
evil fat turns carbs into

419
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,720
evil yeah that's how it goes all right

420
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,159
so what happens when you put fat and

421
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,960
sugar together

422
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:36,480
together when you put fat and sugar

423
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,400
together you inhibit yourself from

424
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,640
getting something so important which is

425
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,880
the nutrients nutrients I'm taking this

426
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,799
supplement I'm taking this powder I'm at

427
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,360
my doctor's office he gave me this

428
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:53,159
powder I'm taking this supplement I'm

429
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,919
eating this oh I got a superfood here

430
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:59,919
and guess what without sugar

431
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:03,280
useless useless the sugar takes

432
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,080
nutrients into your cells mm info right

433
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,000
there have to say

434
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,120
it I'm been screaming it published it

435
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,080
you name it nutrients don't enter the

436
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,600
cells unless you have sugar to take them

437
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,360
in so the all those nutrients that we

438
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,280
have vitamin B's Vit D this that you

439
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,280
need nutrients to take it in all kinds

440
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,600
of different anthocyanins antioxidants

441
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,280
you need nut you need sugar to take the

442
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,000
nutrients in you need that sugar to

443
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,600
drive it in you want those nutrients in

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,480
you want to get those nutrients to get

445
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,799
into every cell you want them into your

446
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,360
nerve cells you want them into your

447
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,760
brain you want them into your liver you

448
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,280
want them into your pancreas you want

449
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,760
them into every aspect of your body but

450
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,960
those phytochemical compounds those

451
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,320
healing nutrients those polyols those

452
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:57,440
anthocyanins all of it can't enter into

453
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:59,240
a cell unless sugar takes it in so but

454
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,320
everybody's and

455
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,120
sugar and in the end all they do is

456
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,039
because they don't know and haven't been

457
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,360
taught they end up just binging on

458
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:11,600
garbage that has fat and sugar because

459
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,520
they end up starving themselves from

460
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,840
carbs but their brain needs the sugar so

461
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,679
they hold off the carbs and what happens

462
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,400
is they get hungry and then next thing

463
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:25,159
you know what they're eating guess

464
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,480
what they're eating a chocolate bar

465
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,440
that's what they're eating a nice

466
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,159
chocolate bar bar this looks like a good

467
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,080
chocolate bar this is a really good

468
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:37,640
chocolate bar right here that's a good

469
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,559
one then they become like slaves to

470
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,159
Chocolate slaves

471
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:46,120
to to caffeine slaves

472
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:48,520
to that's what they become slaves to

473
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,000
it's terrible and then they're high

474
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,320
because they have to go to Chocolate

475
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,440
every minute because they're hold

476
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,360
withholding all these carbs they're

477
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,039
withholding all these sugars but

478
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,000
ooh what's chocolate

479
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,960
what's a chocolate bar sugar sugar and

480
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,720
fat combined once again sugar and fat

481
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,280
combined and every time we have sugar

482
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,080
and fat combined what you get is insulin

483
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,799
resistance everybody's walking around

484
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:18,000
with insulin resistance every single day

485
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,320
they're walking around with insulin

486
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,720
resistance that's what they're

487
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,200
doing yeah you got it and their A1C gets

488
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,279
driven up over time their A1C gets

489
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,440
driven up they don't know what to eat

490
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,400
they don't know what to do then they

491
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,919
hold off away from carbs they stay away

492
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,600
from fruit they stay away from

493
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,640
everything they're scared to eat

494
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,880
anything and then then they end up

495
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,840
binging cheat days cheat days to make up

496
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,200
for the loss of carbs cheat days to make

497
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,000
up for the loss of

498
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,200
sugar and then those sheat days end up

499
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,640
being fat and sugar combined back to the

500
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,919
evil back to sugar and fat

501
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,400
combined and you see it out there all

502
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,279
the time it's unbelievable so called

503
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,320
glucose experts now influencers seem to

504
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,480
know a lot about glucose influencers

505
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,720
seem to know a lot about type 2

506
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,960
diabetes but they don't they'll sit

507
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,279
there and be like what you need to have

508
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,760
your nuts with um your Apple you need to

509
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:15,960
have a you need to have this with this

510
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,600
and it's like dude you're just making

511
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,840
insulin resistance for the person I go

512
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,559
we got a food plan you can buy buy our

513
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,799
$300 food plan and you'll learn when to

514
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:27,200
eat something and when not to eat

515
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,760
something when you look at that I look

516
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,320
at that stuff I look at that stuff now

517
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,440
and I'm like oh dude you just made an

518
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,679
insulin resistance bomb for that person

519
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,520
that person in two years is going to

520
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,880
have hypoglycemia hyperglycemia they're

521
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,120
going to be all over the map and they

522
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,440
just paid for your your useless $300

523
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,120
program and they're not going to know if

524
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,279
they're coming or going in a year or six

525
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,360
months they're just going to be all over

526
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,840
the food map like what is going on it's

527
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,279
crazy out there what's

528
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,400
happening what I recommend from s so is

529
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,240
you don't have fat in the morning if you

530
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,520
can help it if you're going to eat fat

531
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,000
during the day some sometime so be it I

532
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,440
can't control you I can't stop you you

533
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,039
different stuff the point is is that

538
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,480
people are just stuck on in a place

539
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,360
where they're boo chasing their tail

540
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,679
tail and they got the insulin resistance

541
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,840
bodybuilders have to bulk and cut did

542
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,039
you know that they bulk and cut and did

543
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,000
you know something else

talked about nutrients getting into

609
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:28,159
cells you need the sugar to get it into

610
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,880
cells brain cells need sugar

611
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,320
they do brain cells need sugar your

612
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:39,640
brain right it's upside

613
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:43,120
down your brain needs sugar critical to

614
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,279
keep it alive it dies without

615
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,919
sugar it needs it glucose without

616
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:50,679
glucose going to the brain cells they

617
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,159
die quickly neurons nerve cells

618
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,760
neurotransmitter chemicals won't work

619
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,640

love the celery juice boom yes you need

621
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,600
need oxygen that's why we breathe and we

get oxygen but if you don't have the

623
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,799
sugar that oxygen those trace minerals

624
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,200
aren't going to get you far it has to be

625
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:13,360
sugar which is glucose combined with

Dr fwn good to see you breast Dr fwn

672
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,960
breast milk is mostly sugar that's why

673
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,960
it's so sweet and is the best food for

674
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,880
de developing human brains breast milk

675
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:23,760
isn't made out of corn

676
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:29,440
oil corn oil and soy oil breast milk

677
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:31,720
isn't made out of GMO so soy and corn

678
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,799
like the formula the baby formula I'm

679
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,360
not harping on the baby formula if

680
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:38,080
that's all you got if you're a mommy you

681
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,960
can't breastfeed and you're in a

682
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,559
situation where you don't know how to

683
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,880
make your own breast milk no one taught

684
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,240
you how to make like right the medical

685
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,919
me and breast milk which is an

686
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,519
incredible option for women that can't

687
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,960
breastfeed if you haven't learned and

688
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,519
you don't know about

689
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,799
it and you see you got to use a can of

690
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:03,039
baby formula and that formula is nothing

691
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:05,000
but GMO corn GMO soy I understand but

692
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,039
our breast milk isn't made out of that

693
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,880
it's not made out of whey protein powder

694
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:15,360
mixed with corn oil corn syrup corn

695
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:18,600
sugar and soy oil that's not our breast

696
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,279
milk our breast milk is made out of

697
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:25,039
glucose from anywhere it can possibly

698
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:27,919
your body can possibly get it from and

699
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:31,240
then a small amount of protein and small

700
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,760
a hyper small amount of fat a hyper

701
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,080
small amount of

702
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:39,640
fat breast milk isn't all this fat

703
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,799
breast milk isn't butter in all this oil

704
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,600
and all this grease breast milk isn't

705
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,360
that it

706
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,399
is primarily sugar and water and

707
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,799
minerals women who don't get enough

708
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:55,320
glucose they'll have trouble making

709
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,679
breast milk for their

710
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,440
babies I've helped people one one-onone

711
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,639
for so many years you guys so many

712
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,360
different people over the

713
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:06,559
years and their breast milk would

714
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,399
dwindle down no matter what they they'd

715
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,840
be eating cheeseburgers they'd be eating

716
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,720
whatever eggs and their breast milk

717
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,440
would actually lessen and become weak

718
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,880
with with a lot of women not all women

719
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,279
but a lot of women won't have that

720
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,399
glucose storage

721
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,399
inside and so they're eating all these

722
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:23,639
things and they're they're getting

723
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,320
enough carbs but something's wrong and

724
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:27,279
then you have to switch gears you got to

725
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,200
remove the fats you got to get the fats

726
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,399
down and then the breast milk gets all

727
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,480
juicy and it starts to fill when there's

728
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,120
enough carbohydrate and a little less

729
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,840

733
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,720

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,679
right so let's move into white

743
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,240
lung

744
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:21,120
so

745
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:23,799
look I'm just saying right that if I

746
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,200
caught the mystery

747
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:31,039
pneumonia that if I caught it

748
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,679
I'll tell you what would not be in my

749
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,840
diet I would not be eating

750
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,919
eggs I would not be eating cheese I

751
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,600
would not be eating milk I would not be

752
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,240
eating those there's no way I would be

753
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,480
eating those when there is something

754
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,760
going around that's going around like it

755
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,799
is right I would not be cracking the

756
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,039
eggs

757
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:57,559
open I would make eggs for a family

758
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:00,080
member for a friend if they came over I

759
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:02,960
would go and get some

760
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,880
eggs if I had a guest that liked

761
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:10,480
scrambled eggs and I would literally the

762
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:13,360
medical medium okay has many times many

763
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,919
times a guest coming over a family

764
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:20,080
friend coming over medical medium has

765
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,360
many times went out got the

766
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,760
eggs got the eggs out cracked open the

767
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,039
eggs medical medium didn't make them do

768
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,559
celery juice and make them do the heavy

769
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:33,039
metal detox smoothie and make them do

770
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,279
the spinach soup and the healing broth

771
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,799
no I got some eggs I cracked them open

772
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,639
cooked them right in my pan right in the

773
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,039
kitchen and fed everybody the best

774
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:43,600
scrambled eggs you ever ever could

775
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,120
eat the best stuff you could ever eat

776
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,000
the best scrambled eggs you could ever

777
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,519
eat it doesn't change the fact that the

778
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:58,960
eggs are how the white lung pneumonia is

779
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:58,960
even here is even here

780
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,080
so the white lung

781
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,159
pneumonia pathogen they're not calling

782
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,320
it viral but it's viral it's

783
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,200
viral they'll call it micoplasma

784
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,280
bacteria but it's

785
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:21,240
viral the white lung pneumonia that's

786
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,879
here now was

787
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,560
raised in

788
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:30,720
those was raised in those and labs and

789
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:34,200
then somehow got

790
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,639
out that's why whether egg people and

791
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,399
trainers and all the anti and all the

792
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,800
dieticians on Tik Tok and anybody else

793
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,440
who's talking to anybody else that's a

794
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,560
hater of medical medium sitting there

795
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,960
screaming about eggs and how I'm wrong

796
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,480
and those morons don't realize that

797
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,000
that's how these bugs got even here

798
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,839
because what classified medical research

799
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,200
and science did was they just opened up

800
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,160
the top of the egg and they put the

801
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,079
pathogens in and procreated them and

802
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,000
that's how they make them that's why C

803
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:05,200
is

804
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,160
here that's why pneumonia that's why the

805
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,880
flu that's why whatever colds are still

806
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,440
around that you think are still around

807
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,920
that's why anything and everything is

808
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,920
still here that's why your herpes

809
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,800
simplex

810
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:19,000
one is even here to begin

811
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,240
with that's why your epscene bar is even

812
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,400
here to begin with it was raised in labs

813
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,160
in eggs so what I'm trying to tell you

814
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,920
is first thing I would do I would get

815
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,520

so when white lung is going on out

826
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,480
there I would not eat an egg I don't eat

827
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,920
eggs

828
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,240
anyway but I would not eat an egg cuz I

829
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,680
don't want this in my body feeding that

830
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,680
bug that's going around cuz I don't want

831
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,599
fluid in my lungs and I don't want pus

832
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,200
in my lungs and I don't want my

833
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,359
lymphatic system taken over by fluid and

834
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,160
pus and I don't want my liver beaten

835
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,280
down and so I'm not going to eat an egg

836
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,480
I'm

837
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,160
not another thing I'm not going to eat

838
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,119
because of white lung going

839
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,040
around see if I can find some right

840
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,079
here another thing I would not

841
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,960
eat since white L's going

842
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,640
around

843
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,319
cheese would not eat

844
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,839
cheese you can eat what you want you got

845
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:53,359
your own free will you got your own

846
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,560
doctors you got your own whatever

847
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,079
healthc care providers telling you what

848
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,040
to do you listen to them right

849
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,920
but I'm saying what I wouldn't do I

850
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,560
would stay away from cheese with these

851
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,160
bugs going around because then bugs they

852
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,079
love to eat this and if this is in all

853
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,160
tied up in your lymphatic system the

854
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,160
mucus and the crud from this is all

855
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,040
sitting your L lymphatic system your

856
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,359
lymph it's all sitting in your liver

857
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,119
what's going to happen is it's going to

858
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,720
make it so when white lung comes around

859
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,440
that virus that comes around is going to

860
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,079
spew out so much mucus is going to

861
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,240
produce so much mucus and and it's not

862
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,520
going to have a place to go and that's

863
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,200
why people's lungs fill up it's why

864
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,960
kids' lungs are filling up and they're

865
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,280
in the hospitals right now their lungs

866
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,119
are filling up with fluid because

867
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,079
they're on so many of these things of

868
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,040
course their immune system is also low

869
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,280
for a host of different reasons they

870
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,760
don't know about the protocols you know

871
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,640
you got all these people I see it every

872
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,599
day I hear about I had a doctor friend

873
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,240
tell me there's so many kids in the

874
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,440
hospital with this white lung and the

875
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,119
families don't know about protocols and

876
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,000
what kids need and stuff they they don't

877
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:59,000
bring these to their

878
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,960
doctor and the kids are on cheese the

879
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,839
kids are on

880
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,720
eggs the adults are on cheese adults are

881
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:11,240
on eggs and then it rips through the

882
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,319
family and it knocks people down and

883
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,960
knocks nurses down and knocks everybody

884
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:18,079
down you

885
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,160
know and then it's the craziest thing we

886
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,000
go through life we go through life I

887
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,560
going do it all over again if you

888
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,240
believe that this isn't our only

889
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,319
lifetime do you believe that this isn't

890
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,240
our only lifetime tell me like it's okay

891
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:36,240
if you believe this we got one shot and

892
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,800
one shot only we never come back our

893
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,680
soul is not even there we don't have a

894
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,280
soul our soul doesn't come back into

895
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,920
this lifetime our soul doesn't come back

896
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:48,160
into another body there's no way aw it

897
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,880
doesn't happen we die and that's it well

898
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:55,520
okay okay you die you're gone that's it

899
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,319
then but if you believe we come back

900
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,000
here

901
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:01,839
and we come back here again and we may

902
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,560
come back here again if you believe that

903
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,880
this isn't our only shot here this isn't

904
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,000
our only moment our soul gets to walk

905
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,040
into a physical form

906
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,880
here then you may not want to do what so

907
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:19,280
many people do over and over again they

908
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,280
come back here they're a baby they're

909
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,440
born get older die come back again

910
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,640

1033
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,440
already on the medical medium monoc

1034
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,160

1039
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,240
and this might not be what you want

1040
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,720
right now but for the people who

1041
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,160
actually want something like this is an

1042
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,559
option we got

1043
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:13,240
them all right cheese stay away when the

1044
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:15,839
bugs are out to play okay eggs stay away

1045
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,480
when the bugs are out to play okay

1046
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,720
important to know if you can if it's the

1047
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,000
only food you have and you're going to

1048
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,680
starve eat the eggs then if it's the

1049
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,319
only food you have you have some

1050
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,079
chickens in the backyard you can't get

1051
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:31,040
to a store you're going to starve to

1052
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,520
death eat the eggs if you got nothing

1053
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,240
else but an old piece of cheese in the

1054
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,119
refrigerator and you got nothing to eat

1055
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,960
that day and it's the only thing that's

1056
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:40,640
going to keep you like stable meaning

1057
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,960
something in your body so you have some

1058
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,040
kind of substance something like that

1059
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,960
you can actually function with then eat

1060
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,400
the cheese but I'm saying if you have

1061
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,880
options stay away when you're up against

1062
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,480
the pathogens that are out there right

1063
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,640

so it goes into that but it shows you

1080
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,760
dosages and you can just do maybe three

1081
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:40,440

1134
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,240
sea hpylori

1135
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,799
bacteria like eoli that actually develop

1136
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:15,640
people develop

1137
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:17,319
ulcers diverticulosis

1138
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,920
diverticulitis they have all these

1139
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:23,599
different little bit of bacteria like

1140
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,240
strep eoli sedith staff all sits in

1141
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,799
there in the little pockets inside their

1142
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:31,440
intes track you put the celery juice

1143
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:33,040
down if you're making it fresh that's

1144
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,000
best maybe you're buying some store

1145
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,960
bought one that's HPP and that one might

1146
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,160
be giving you cramps I don't know a lot

1147
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,520
of people do that well they'll tell me

1148
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,920
they're drinking celery juice and

1149
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,559
they're getting the store bought one

1150
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:47,720
it's got all this junk in there it's got

1151
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:50,240
different things mixed in it it's it's

1152
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:53,079
HPP high pressure pasteurization which

1153
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,160
is actually not it means it's not raw it

1154
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:56,640
means it's

1155
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,200
cooked with an an experimental way of

1156
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,440
cooking it which is actually scary if

1157
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,920
you're going to cook something i' rather

1158
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,440
have you put it to heat and cook it but

1159
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,960
whatever it is if you're doing if you're

1160
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,319
getting a little cramped up from celery

1161
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,880
juice are you straining it do you know

1162
00:50:09,319 --> 00:50:14,480
the guidelines do you know the

1163
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:18,119
information are you straining the celery

1164
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,280
juice you got to strain it that bring

1165
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:21,920
dials that down right there that's one

1166
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,040
of the reasons why you have to strain it

1167
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,799
it's critical right and then the other

1168
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,640
thing is you do a little bit at a time

1169
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:29,440
if you could only do 2 O of celery juice

1170
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,040
run a few sticks through and do 2 oz you

1171
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,720
start with that and see how it rolls a

1172
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,160
lot of people have to acclimate they got

1173
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,160
to

1174
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,680
acclimate all right making a

1175
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,319

00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:10,400
fata so what I'm doing

1270
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,960
is I'm peeling the carrot back and I'm

1271
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,119
making this these strips and I'm going

1272
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:17,280
to cut those strips you see you guys

1273
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:19,440
right careful when you use one of these

1274
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,799
I mean you can catch your finger

1275
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,359
and that would not be good and I'm kind

1276
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:28,119
of like I'm kind of like I get a little

1277
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:29,480
intense right here so could easily

1278
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:32,160
happen all right that should be good

1279
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:34,920
right there you can do a whole carrot if

1280
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,920
you want but you'll have a carrot cake

1281
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,880
so you got to look out you don't want a

1282
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:41,680
carrot cake in this situation I think

1283
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,559
that's like a lot I think that's plenty

1284
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,280
okay so I'm going to do a little bit of

1285
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,280
chopping if you don't

1286
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,359
mind and you don't want the strands to

1287
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
be really long inside your muffins right

1288
00:55:52,359 --> 00:55:57,000
there cuz I'm making

1289
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000

1311
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:56,640
carrot cake nothing wrong wrong with a

1312
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:00,440
carrot

1313
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:01,920
cake I mean a healthy carrot cake right

1314
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,799
I want people they're eating a carrot

1318
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:14,839
right zucchini right here let's go so

1319
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,039
I'm just going to cut off the ends of

1320
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:17,039
that

1321
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,960
zucchini now the same thing with

1322
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,799
zucchini okay I'm just going to cut off

1323
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,799
a couple little

1324
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:26,799
pieces

1325
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:31,920
all right just a couple little strange

1326
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,119
pieces you go to the store you buy

1327
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,400
zucchini you'll see that right there

1328
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:37,440
I'll show you in a

1329
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,079
closeup that's somebody's fingernail

1330
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,039
that went through there and it ain't

1331
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:45,200
mine

1332
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:48,240
so if I want to scare the crap out of

1333
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,480
myself I'll ask Spirit of

1334
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,319
compassion whose fingernail was that

1335
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,039
what was under that fingernail what

1336
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:56,640
could potentially be in that zucchini

1337
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:58,319
but I try not to ask Spirit of

1338
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,319
compassion those questions I just know

1339
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,960
that anything could be under somebody's

1340
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,160
fingernail

1341
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:08,119
from the's the strap to everything under

1342
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:11,039
the sun I've talked about this for years

1343
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:12,799
okay so let's chop this up here so not

1344
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,640
only do I wash stuff and I'm going to do

1345
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:18,240
like a whole show on washing produce for

1346
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:21,599
sure so I'm going to slice this in kind

1347
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,599
of like these kinds of slice pieces

1348
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,079
right here now you don't want these

1349
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,880
really big and hunky either in the

1350
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:31,280
mix okay so what I'm going to do is cut

1351
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,280
these

1352
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:38,039
small see

1353
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,839
guys so anyway I wanted to talk about

1354
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:41,720
this pneumonia that's that's rushing

1355
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:45,200
through the us right

1356
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:49,319
now I would say right around Christmas

1357
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,319
time it's going to be in the major

1358
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:54,520
cities a lot of people are going to be

1359
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,359
in the emergency room a lot of people

1360
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,640
take taking a lot of antibiotics and

1361
00:58:56,359 --> 00:59:01,440
hopes to curve it I'm not trying to

1362
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,520
freak you out or anything it's just that

1363
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,880
if I don't say anything about it like

1364
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,680
when the next flu comes through or the

1365
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,559
next mysterious pneumonia comes through

1366
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,359
if I don't remind people to be a little

1367
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:14,839
more cautious like use a handy wipe at

1368
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:17,680
on the shopping carts on the carriage

1369
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:20,839
handle cuz all the Simplex on there and

1370
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,640
all the strap and all the the flu on

1371
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:25,839
there and the white lung flu will be on

1372
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:28,280
there

1373
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,760
so what I'm saying is there's different

1374
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,720
precautions you can take and then of

1375
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,680
course protocols right you want your

1376
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,920
time tea every day you want that cold

1377
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,760
and flu

1378
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:44,599
protocol okay guys getting this in

1379
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,599
here might be like pretty much all I

1380
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,119
need and once this is in the oven we'll

1381
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:53,640
talk about the white flu all

1382
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:56,280
right okay next on the list

1383
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:59,440
onion the only thing with the onion is

1384
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:02,319
I'm just not in the mood to like be all

1385
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,520
teared up from the onion and I'm not in

1386
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,119
the mood for that right now you know the

1387
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,920
watery

1388
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,760
eyes cuz this onion I noticed has been

1389
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,319
kind of sharp I've been using this onion

1390
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,680
lately this yellow onion it's been

1391
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:19,640
pretty darn

1392
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,599
sharp

1393
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,760
okay an

1394
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:27,039
anti-pathogenic power the onion has

1395
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:31,319
that's the kind of stuff you

1396
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:32,920
want okay you want that

1397
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:35,720
anti-pathogenic

1398
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:39,920
Powerhouse which is herbs like onions

1399
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:42,400
and garlic you want that you don't want

1400
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,200
you know cheese cheese is just going to

1401
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:48,400
gum up the works and feed a pathogen

1402
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:52,000
feed a virus that's going around making

1403
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:55,440
it worse then like cheese cheese is

1404
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,039
going to just tie up your lymphatic

1405
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,280
system I love it I love it when haters a

1406
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:02,200
medical medium like say like certain

1407
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,720
dietitians or something they're like

1408
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,240
he's starving people from cheese people

1409
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,400
need their protein they need their

1410
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:12,280
cheese I'm going to have Samantha

01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,079
eventually come um over and make an

1412
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,599
appearance and talk about cheese and

1413
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:20,200
protein and things like that but

1414
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:22,680
Sammy hasn't been feeling good lately

1415
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,599
she's been under the weather herself she

1416
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:29,559

01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:44,119
doing that okay I'm put a little bit

1421
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,079
more onion in here can't help it and

1422
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:48,480
then we're going to do some fresh

1423
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:49,559
squeezed lemon boom might even do some

1424
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,559
other stuff too we're going to do some

1425
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:53,440
red bell

1426
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:56,440
pepper

1427
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,440
so

1428
01:01:56,599 --> 01:01:59,640
so I noticed

1429
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,559
that Spirit of compassion was telling me

1430
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,760
that even though we just dealt with the

1431
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:09,160
whole issue we did with four years ago

1432
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,279
with the bugs going around and stuff

1433
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:14,680
Spirit of compassion has told me that

1434
01:02:11,279 --> 01:02:16,279
we're due for a really bad one not not

1435
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,480
the one that's coming right now that's

1436
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:20,680
already landed in the

1437
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,359
US that one right

1438
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:26,359
now where is my hand

1439
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,359
tow

1440
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:34,119
that one's really annoying for sure but

1441
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:37,440
s so tells me that eventually there's

1442
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:41,480
going to be a really bad Bruiser of a

1443
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,480
brute that's going to be coming to

1444
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:47,880
town and so we want strong immune

1445
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,559
systems we want to be armed and ready we

1446
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,400
want to know what foods to eat we want

1447
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:55,680

01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,680
water that's what we're

1549
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,000
doing but I'm going to be careful with

1550
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,400
the water because you don't want it too

1551
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,920
liquidy so you got to kind of gauge it

1552
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,839
all right here we go there's a

1553
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:59,039

1572
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:52,799
it but if you want to pinch of salt or

1573
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,759
something like that you can put that in

1574
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:57,679

me Linda wolf I was a registered

1658
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,040
dietitian for 33 years so it kills me to

1659
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,760
listen to

1660
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:33,520
Sammy We're so misinformed in our

1661
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,880
profession there is a lot of humor to

1662
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:40,679
Sammy it's just embarrassing for me to

1663
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:44,480
watch sami's 24 years old and Sammy is

1664
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:44,480
going to come on so we'll see all

1665
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:49,880
right getting lost

1666
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:51,760
ready here's what we're doing we got to

1667
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:55,440
put these little paper things in

1668
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,440

1669
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:02,199

01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,480
get this done cuz I want to talk about

1673
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:13,960
pneumonia I'm worried for people if

1674
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:16,880
they're not at least partially prepared

1675
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:19,159
because who wants to be sick in bed who

1676
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,199
wants to be at the hospital with a bad

1677
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:24,280
case of bronchitis and then told they

1678
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:26,679
have Walking Pneumonia

1679
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:30,080
for the next month and pneumonia can

1680
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:33,199
like really Tire people out it can just

1681
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:35,239
linger and linger so many people who get

1682
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:37,080
it they're just like they're just like

1683
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:39,120
in like this place where they've lost

1684
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:41,040
their energy they can't get oxygen in

1685
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,560
their lungs they have too much mucus

1686
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:46,360
drowning out their

1687
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,920
lungs and it's really sad when there's

1688
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,480
things we can do we can protect

1689
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:53,360

1732
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:03,199
you recover you catch another flu knocks

1733
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:05,320

1742
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,120

01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:13,400
just had the pneumonia and almost died

1805
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:13,400
we need to stop World Travel for

1806
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:17,440
real for

1807
01:19:19,239 --> 01:19:24,520
real all

1808
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,000
right

1809
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,000
dummy

1810
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,719
here pH crispy perspective oh my God

1811
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,920
been through that and done that so

1812
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:38,280
you've actually been through that you're

1813
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:39,880
seasoned you know what's up you do right

1814
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,960
now you guys are so much hate and attack

1815
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:44,719
on medical medium it's

1816
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:46,719
unbelievable out there and they're just

1817
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:48,360
so jealous and they're all trying to

1818
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,880
sell all their programs and they're

1819
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:51,880
trying to sell all their build their

1820
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,560
Empires and they're trying to do you

1821
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,960
name it and they're so pissed at Medical

1822
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:57,120
medium they're tired of hearing people

1823
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,520
say medical medium fixed me medical

1824
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,159
medium healed me medical medium

1825
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,560
literally changed my life and I got

1826
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:06,239
better I was bedridden they don't want

1827
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:07,360
to hear that they don't want to hear it

1828
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:10,159
people are

1829
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:13,360
asking and people ask about these bad

1830
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:15,120
bugs you know it's important to answer

1831
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:18,920
and talk about it a little bit so first

1832
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:20,320
of all first thing to know what is it

1833
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:23,440
what is this

1834
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:25,080
bug well

1835
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:28,920
the

1836
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,920
CBC see how I changed the

1837
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:36,800
acrom the

1838
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:41,560
CBC right says oh don't worry it's not a

1839
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:44,199
virus don't worry it is it's viral it's

1840
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:48,520
a virus yes it

1841
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:48,520
is okay it's

1842
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:55,360
another viral issue at hand

1843
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,400
but no one wants to talk about it

1844
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,440
because they think everybody's just

1845
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:02,239
burned out from the last virus so

1846
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,840
they're trying to say oh maybe it's it's

1847
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:06,719
myoplasmic

1848
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:09,159
maybe it's bacteria and that's what

1849
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:13,920
they're going by but it's viral very

1850
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:17,600
important to know okay so here's how it

1851
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,520
works when you catch a

1852
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:23,159
bacteria okay our body does not do the

1853
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:26,760
same thing it does

1854
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:30,960
with viruses so what people are getting

1855
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:33,840
is lung infections so

1856
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:39,280
rapid critical lung

1857
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:41,199
infections those are only caused by cyto

1858
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,560
storms

1859
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:45,320
cyto

1860
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:47,719
storms

1861
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,639
bacteria does not

1862
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:53,400
create a

1863
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:54,600
full-blown cyto storm

1864
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,880
it's one thing if I'm sitting here and

1865
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,320
I'm just going to talk to you guys about

1866
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:01,320
this and say wait long wait long wait

1867
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:03,320
long pneumonia ponia build your immune

1868
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:06,280
system it's another if I can at Le it's

1869
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:08,040
one thing to do that it's another so you

1870
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:10,400
guys know what's going on so you guys

1871
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:13,880
hear it here you hear it here first you

1872
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:16,719
know you learn about it you know the BS

1873
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:18,560
that's happening out there

1874
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:20,280
okay

1875
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:24,800
viruses

1876
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:27,639
Airborne like the flu and like C create

1877
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:32,400
cyto storms whether it's a small cyto

1878
01:22:27,639 --> 01:22:36,600
storm or a large cyto storm the only way

1879
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:39,520
to get pneumatic fluid in the lungs to

1880
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:42,760
this degree is you have to be doing some

1881
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:45,639
type of cyto storm and the only way to

1882
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:48,320
do that cyto storm to this degree is it

1883
01:22:45,639 --> 01:22:50,920
has to be a virus it can't be bacteria

1884
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:54,199
but see that's how you know how foul the

1885
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:57,080
game is played and how the game

1886
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:59,000
is played out there so just be like oh

1887
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:01,560
it's m

1888
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:05,600
micoplasma it's it's you know it's

1889
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:08,239
bacteria no no that that can already be

1890
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:11,560
in you and when your immune system gets

1891
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:15,040
knocked down by a cyto storm from a

1892
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:18,719
virus getting into the lungs then

1893
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:21,040
yeah other bacteria can Thrive and in

1894
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:23,120
some people can Thrive so much that you

1895
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:26,360
end up getting even more fluid in more

1896
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:28,639
problems and more issues another person

1897
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:30,239
they may not have that type of bacteria

1898
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,760
that's really in their system that can

1899
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:33,520
Elevate like they don't have enough

1900
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,520
strap and they don't have enough other

1901
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,360
varieties of bacteria so they don't get

1902
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,800
that elevation of bacteria but they

1903
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:42,920
still get the cyto storm and the fluid

1904
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,920
in the lungs and the

1905
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:48,320
mucus you guys I didn't listen I want

1906
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:50,560
you know I didn't say stop World Travel

1907
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:52,280
that was I was reading a comment of

1908
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,960
someone who said they almost died from

1909
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:58,480
the pneumonia and they said they would

1910
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:02,719
stop World Travel so that wasn't me

1911
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:04,600
saying it what I say is make sure you

1912
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,280
have information wherever you're

1913
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,800
traveling make sure you have protocols

1914
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,320
and understand what's going on so you

1915
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,120
can protect yourself and make sure you

1916
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:14,440
have that while you're traveling and

1917
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:17,719
that's what I

1918
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:20,159
say so the first lesson here in this

1919
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:21,920
exhibit is to know that when you see

1920
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:24,360
somebody going through white lung

1921
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,679
they're going through cyto storm now

1922
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,239
here's the next part that's really

1923
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,120
critical to know this tells you if it's

1924
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:35,280
virus get

1925
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:37,800
ready if it's titled white lung why

1926
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:41,760
they're titling it white lung because

1927
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:47,400
they're seeing scar tissue in the

1928
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:49,600
lung they're seeing scar tissue in the

1929
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:52,840
lung that's

1930
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:58,880
why why is there scar tissue in the lung

1931
01:24:52,840 --> 01:25:04,320
because of a cyto storm only a cyto

1932
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:06,760
storm can create White Scar Tissue seen

1933
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:09,560
on the scans in the

1934
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:12,280
lung because of a

1935
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:14,600
virus that's Advanced information right

1936
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:16,000
there extremely Advanced information

1937
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,760
about what's going on out there and how

1938
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,760
it

1939
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:21,600
works this one thing to be like oh you

1940
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,159
know what is it out there what's going

1941
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,440
on

1942
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:29,840
oh it's another to actually know how it

1943
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:32,400
works virus enters in through your nose

1944
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:34,360
the virus enters in through your mouth

1945
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,320
you eat the virus if you're eating out

1946
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:38,080
you know somewhere out and and somebody

1947
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,159
coughed on the plate you're eating the

1948
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:42,159
virus you're breathing it in if

1949
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:43,760
somebody's sneezing if somebody's

1950
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:46,360
breathing you're breathing it in you get

1951
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,880
it in and when that virus gets in you

1952
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:51,360
goes down into the

1953
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:52,840
lung it gets in the lung and then

1954
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,480
there's a war

1955
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:57,080
a war that

1956
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:59,280
ensues so next

1957
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:01,400
piece next piece been critical

1958
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:05,560
information here it

1959
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:08,239
is right there your white blood cells

1960
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:11,159
your white blood cells

1961
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:14,639
and the virus that's going around right

1962
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:16,760
now they go into battle they fight and

1963
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:18,440
as they're fighting and totally just

1964
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:20,480
pissing each other off and they're after

1965
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:22,880
each other and and the virus is trying

1966
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,159
to kill the immune cell

1967
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,199
that's what the virus is doing he trying

1968
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:27,639
to destroy and kill your immune cells

1969
01:26:26,199 --> 01:26:29,360
and your immune cell is trying to stay

1970
01:26:27,639 --> 01:26:31,480
alive and it's sit you're trying to kill

1971
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:33,480
the virus it's trying to eat the virus

1972
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:36,360
and this war that's

1973
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:39,800
happening is the cyto

1974
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:44,400
storm and if the immune system is

1975
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:46,840
weakened and beat down then the virus

1976
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:49,320
can bypass it and get into lung tissue

1977
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:52,480
and start to eat up some of the lung

1978
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:53,719
tissue cells which creates a scar scar

1979
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:57,199
like

1980
01:26:53,719 --> 01:26:59,639
tissue and that's what the cyto storm in

1981
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:01,800
white lung is and that's what's going

1982
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:04,719
out going around right now so all these

1983
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:07,400
kids and adults are getting these Scar

1984
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:08,800
Tissue markers in their lungs where they

1985
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:11,159
don't really know what it is well that's

1986
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:15,080
what it is it's scar

1987
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:17,520
tissue and that's what's going on there

1988
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:21,119
okay

1989
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:22,880
so a tremendous amount of

1990
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:25,440
lymphocytes

1991
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,119
and white blood cells and killer cells

1992
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:32,320
die from this cyto storm so you're in

1993
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:34,800
crisis with the cyto storm because your

1994
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:37,480
immune system is exploding just like

1995
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,320
this white blood cell just did so it

1996
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:42,080
fell apart it just boom exploded and

1997
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,080
that's what happens so when people are

1998
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:47,320
dealing with this they're actually

1999
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:49,840
losing white blood cells left and right

2000
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:52,159
thousands of them and then your bone

2001
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:54,040
marrows going into overdrive producing

2002
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:56,800
more white blood cells and more immune

2003
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:59,600
killer more immune cells and those are

2004
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:02,080
coming back up to the lungs and the war

2005
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,000
still goes on so finally after things

2006
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:07,719
dumb down a little bit you get a mucus

2007
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,880
an overload of mucus from this process

2008
01:28:07,719 --> 01:28:12,000
it starts out where the mucus doesn't

2009
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:14,480
start the mucus starts out a little

2010
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,840
later so this whole white lung

2011
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:20,000
mysterious pneumonia syndrome is mucus

2012
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:23,440
that starts a little after a little

2013
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:27,280
later on after already The War Began

2014
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:29,239
with the cyto storm and as the War Began

2015
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:32,320
it started to the war started to die

2016
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:36,920
down and finish and what was left is now

2017
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:39,040
the mucus from the byproduct of all of

2018
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:42,639
the viruses that have been killed and

2019
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:46,239
destroyed by your immune system and that

2020
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:51,360
byproduct helps to produce a tremendous

2021
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:54,760
amount of mucus and pus and yellow mucus

2022
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:58,280
and clear mucus and all that mucus

2023
01:28:54,760 --> 01:29:01,119
builds up in the lower sections of the

2024
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:04,119
lung because when it comes down to a bad

2025
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:06,679
virus those are the viruses the bad flu

2026
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:08,960
viruses the bad sea viruses the bad

2027
01:29:06,679 --> 01:29:12,239
white lung

2028
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:15,159
viruses those are the viruses that

2029
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:17,600
actually trigger off lower lung issues

2030
01:29:15,159 --> 01:29:21,159
they go deeper they just don't sit up

2031
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:24,520
here where you have postnasal drip and

2032
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:27,080
you get like cold in the head or a mild

2033
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:29,639
flu in the head and then the drip goes

2034
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:31,159
down into your lung no that's not what's

2035
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:34,920
Happening

2036
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:38,520
Here someone can get a flu the flu goes

2037
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:41,560
into their sinuses gets into their head

2038
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:43,840
it produces a tremendous amount of mucus

2039
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:46,000
the mucus and the sinuses drains down as

2040
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,719
you're sleeping into the night you're

2041
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,080
sleeping and it's draining down into

2042
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:52,840
your lungs but it's draining down into

2043
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:56,080
the upper lungs

2044
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:58,840
upper area of your respiratory and then

2045
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:01,520
that's the cough and the crack and the

2046
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:03,560
cough and the carak and that's what that

2047
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,800
is you're trying to expel you need the

2048
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:07,960
expectorant you need it to come out but

2049
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:10,560
the difference is when it's like the

2050
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:12,400
white lung the mysterious pneumonia bugs

2051
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,719
those viruses they go deeper into the

2052
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:16,679
lung they go into the lower

2053
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:18,639
lungs where they're sitting in there

2054
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:21,639
trying to do

2055
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:23,679
damage and that's the difference and now

2056
01:30:21,639 --> 01:30:26,320
that's where you can't breathe good and

2057
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:29,080
you feel like you're drowning in mucus

2058
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:31,000
and pus and you're drowning in it and

2059
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:34,080
that's what it feels like you see you

2060
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,119
guys and when you're in that position

2061
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:38,600
you're kind of stuck where whoa do I go

2062
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:41,159
to the doctor do I go to the hospital I

2063
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,480
can't breathe good and they're now

2064
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:44,239
they're throwing everything at you

2065
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:46,040
they're throwing you know the seatbacks

2066
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:47,920
at you they're throwing the antibiotics

2067
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:49,639
they throwing you the the steroids the

2068
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:53,719
5-day steroids they throwing everything

2069
01:30:49,639 --> 01:30:56,679
they can at you to dumb went down but

2070
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:58,600
that's what's happening so right now on

2071
01:30:56,679 --> 01:31:01,639
the rise is a

2072
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:04,760
virus tagged out there as white lung

2073
01:31:01,639 --> 01:31:07,840
syndrome something like

2074
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:11,600
that and mysterious pneumonia and what

2075
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:14,000
it is is another pneumatic virus going

2076
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,920
in here creating a cyto storm by

2077
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,880
battling your white blood cells going

2078
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,040
deeper into the lungs the lower part of

2079
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,440
the

2080
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:27,400
lungs and how much mucus is produced

2081
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:27,400
also depends on what you're doing for

2082
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:32,480
Foods if you're coming down with that

2083
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:33,800
baby you don't want to be eating this

2084
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,320
when you're coming down with that

2085
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,560
pneumonia when you're coming down with

2086
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:39,679
any kind of bug flu virus you don't want

2087
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:42,040
to be eating all that cheese and all

2088
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:45,280
that fat you don't want to eat

2089
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:46,679
that and there's there's sea viruses

2090
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,040
going around right now there's flu

2091
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:51,400
viruses going around right now and then

2092
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:52,760
there's boom this virus going around

2093
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,320
right now they're going to name it

2094
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,840
anything they want to name it but right

2095
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:59,119
now they're keeping it everybody from

2096
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:00,440
knowing it's a virus but you never know

2097
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:03,679
maybe in a month they'll be like that

2098
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:06,920
was a virus that wasn't micoplasma that

2099
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:09,400
wasn't this we'll see what

2100
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:11,920
happens but you don't want to be eating

2101
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:15,119
this or too much of

2102
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:17,040
that when this stuff is going around you

2103
01:32:15,119 --> 01:32:18,719
don't want to be eating too much cheese

2104
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,280
you don't want to be eating any cheese

2105
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,360
when this stuff is going

2106
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:26,159
around you don't want to be eating eggs

2107
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:27,880
especially eggs when this stuff is going

2108
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:30,760
around

2109
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:31,679
okay right you don't want to be eating

2110
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:35,600
those

2111
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:39,040
too because these feed the virus that's

2112
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:41,400
going around so what's happening here

2113
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:44,239
okay

2114
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:46,960
is these babies are

2115
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:50,560
feeding that virus that's getting into

2116
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:53,920
people's lungs it loves to eat this and

2117
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:56,800
when it eats this it get gets

2118
01:32:53,920 --> 01:33:00,520
stronger more mucus is

2119
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:02,960
produced a virus going around flu virus

2120
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:05,440
C virus any kind of virus going

2121
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,360
around produces mucus all on its own

2122
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,400
because it's it's it's leaving all this

2123
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:12,080
byproduct talked about that for years

2124
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:14,159
the byproduct from pathogens all that

2125
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:16,560
byproduct that

2126
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:18,960
byproduct saturates the system the

2127
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:20,920
lymphatic system the liver the lungs and

2128
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,400
all that byproduct helps to build up all

2129
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:24,400
that mucus all that

2130
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:28,000
pneumonia yellow

2131
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:33,920
pus same with cheese you don't want to

2132
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:36,440
be doing cheese when these bugs are

2133
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:38,239
around you do the cheese it's the same

2134
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,239
thing you got to look out it's these

2135
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:42,400
things that

2136
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:44,119
matter if it was me and I was coming

2137
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,600
down with something or I knew somebody

2138
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:47,440
there had something I'd be cautious

2139
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,280
making sure there's no cheese there's no

2140
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:52,280
milk there's no dairy products there's

2141
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,920
no eggs I would keep corn out

2142
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:55,679
make sure there's no corn corn syrup I

2143
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:58,800
would keep the fats low make sure

2144
01:33:55,679 --> 01:34:03,040
there's no pork if you're a meat eater

2145
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:05,199
right eat lighter if you're a meat eater

2146
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:07,960
and I would make sure I would have that

2147
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:10,639
protocols book right

2148
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:13,560
there I would make sure that's there

2149
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:15,719
because that's the greatest companion in

2150
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:17,480
times like this you can actually know

2151
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:19,119
what you can do for yourself how you can

2152
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:23,360
arm yourself what you can look out for

2153
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:26,159
yourself with it's for all important and

2154
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:28,199
this is free this is free at the library

2184
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:56,760
read so

2185
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:59,920
um how do we heal the scar

2186
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:59,920
tissue all

2187
01:36:01,159 --> 01:36:05,800
right so our lungs like to regenerate

2188
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:09,159
they like to heal over time what I've

2189
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:14,080
noticed all these years is that the only

2190
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:16,199
way to heal scar tissue in lungs is

2191
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:19,199
antioxidants high amounts of

2192
01:36:16,199 --> 01:36:22,360
antioxidants namely vitamin C is one of

2193
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:25,400
the best ones right there vitamin C is

2194
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:28,760
one of the big ones for healing Scar

2195
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:31,760
Tissue associated with viruses that are

2196
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:33,920
airborne they get into the lungs damag

2197
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:37,360
tissue damag

2198
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:40,119
cells vitamin C is a big one I'm just

2199
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:42,920
giving you one tool there's plenty of

2200
01:36:40,119 --> 01:36:45,520
tools in the brain saver protocols but

2201
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:49,080
I'm giving you one powerful tool all in

2202
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:51,440
its own Michelle says B12 that's that's

2203
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:55,280
important too B12 is important for for

2204
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:58,280
every single cell in the body but if you

2205
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:00,440
can't do any of that make sure you're

2206
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:03,679
staying away from a lot of the foods

2207
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:09,199
that gum up the works and I'm just using

2208
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:13,040
that basic term gums up the works okay

2209
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:14,800
like foods that dog the liver foods that

2210
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,440
slow down the liver foods that actually

2211
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:18,760
create a problem with the liver where so

2212
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:21,520
much mucus is being produced in the

2213
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:25,040
liver that the lymphatic system is is

2214
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:27,800
getting the the like the load the excess

2215
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:30,360
mucus and lymphatic drainage isn't going

2216
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:33,520
to cut it if you keep on dumping all of

2217
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:35,360
this stuff these mucus forming Foods

2218
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:37,960
mucus forming Foods because pathogens

2219
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:39,920
are feeding on these

2220
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:41,480
foods and that's a big reason why

2221
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,639
they're mucus forming because pathogens

2222
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:45,040
feed on these Foods it's a big part of

2223
01:37:43,639 --> 01:37:47,400
it and then the byproduct from the

2224
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:49,599
pathogens and man when this white lung

2225
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:51,880
comes through and it's it's hitting the

2226
01:37:49,599 --> 01:37:53,679
cities now and everybody is coughing

2227
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:56,320
their chest is tight they're all walking

2228
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:58,080
around with walking pneumonia and then

2229
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,199
they go and they eat a slice of pizza

2230
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:03,040
they go and they eat two scrambled eggs

2231
01:38:00,199 --> 01:38:04,159
they go and they have right some cheese

2232
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:06,280
on a

2233
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:07,840
burger if you want to be an animal

2234
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:11,239

the colostrum

2244
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:40,040
out yuck colostrum does nothing for our

2245
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,320
immune system by the way it's probably

2246
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:45,159
one of the biggest

2247
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:47,480
scams in on the market for 20 years now

2248
01:38:45,159 --> 01:38:49,480
is colostrum how many people tried that

2249
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:51,599
and they didn't get out of bed how many

2250
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:52,840
people tried colostrum and they couldn't

2251
01:38:51,599 --> 01:38:55,119
get out of bed and

2252
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:56,760
recover that's this doesn't work but you

2253
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:58,800

2291
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:59,199
now what I like about this book right

2292
01:40:56,599 --> 01:41:01,639
here what I like about all the books

2293
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:04,679
really goes heavy into Epstein

2294
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:07,960
bar a lot of people are in mattress

2295
01:41:04,679 --> 01:41:11,800
Island because of Long

2296
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:14,280
Haul okay medical medium information

2297
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:18,199
before covid put out how

2298
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:22,320
flu Ematic viruses knock down our immune

2299
01:41:18,199 --> 01:41:26,280
system so much that Epstein bar Rises up

2300
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:30,639
up when Epstein bar Rises

2301
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:33,719
up okay it rises up in our system and it

2302
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:37,760
beats us down and we end up in

2303
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:40,840
bed so so many people because of the

2304
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:45,000
bugs going around like C end up on

2305
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:47,400
mattress Island for a very long time

2306
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,880
because of epine

2307
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:52,800
bar and epine bar Rises up in their

2308
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:54,840
system and it keeps them neurologically

2309
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:58,599
sick and they're stuck in bed and stuck

2310
01:41:54,840 --> 01:42:00,840

2311
01:41:58,599 --> 01:42:02,280

down all

2430
01:46:57,119 --> 01:47:01,880
right okay problem with the flu viruses

2431
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:04,000
is they knock our immune systems down

2432
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:06,000
they bring them down to the ground right

2433
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,119
their body has to go into overdrive and

2434
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,679
overload and then other pathogens that

2435
01:47:08,119 --> 01:47:12,960
are sitting inside of her body like the

2436
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:14,440
hhv 6s and the Simplex ones and C cyto

2437
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,440
viruses and everything else in the

2438
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:19,239
Epstein bar all start to rise up and

2439
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,800
they rise up and then he keep us sick

2440
01:47:19,239 --> 01:47:23,560

2441
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,840
herpetic family viruses they rise up and

2442
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:27,040

2443
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:29,760

2444
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:31,480

2445
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:34,080

I've seen with multiple sclerosis is

2562
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,880
they push high

2563
01:53:07,079 --> 01:53:12,000

got the epen bar and that guy was known

2745
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:06,560
as the epen bar guy he's the one that

2746
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:09,040

after you heal maybe check out my stuff

2749
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:16,760
after but no they won't do

2750
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:22,400
that

2751
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,400
because they're sick

2752
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:35,560
bastards

2753
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:35,560
mhm that's right Jenny

2754
02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:44,400
mac oh you want to hear a

2755
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:44,400
story you guys want to hear a

2756
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:53,360
story

2757
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:55,159
okay I know somebody

2758
02:01:53,360 --> 02:02:00,360
personally

2759
02:01:55,159 --> 02:02:00,360
right that was bedridden back in

2760
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:07,480
2011 okay

2761
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:10,560
2011 and they couldn't find

2762
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:13,480
answers so they went to a

2763
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:17,800
chiropractor a chiropractor that knew a

2764
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:22,480
little bit about alternative medicine in

2765
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:22,480
2011 that chiropractor mentioned to

2766
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:28,760
them could be upstein

2767
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:31,159
bar but the chiropractor never mentioned

2768
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:33,920
where the chiropractor got that

2769
02:02:31,159 --> 02:02:37,320
information that chiropractor never

2770
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:40,159
said that they were a client of medical

2771
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:43,599
mediums in

2772
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:46,639
2011 and that to get you out of bed off

2773
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:47,960
of mattress Island you need to get a

2774
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:49,480
hold of that

2775
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:52,800
guy

2776
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:56,800
and start learning how to do

2777
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:58,880
it and then that person stayed bedridden

2778
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:03,199
because that chiropractor wouldn't tell

2779
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:07,000
them that they found out about epine bar

2780
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:07,000
from being a client to Medical

2781
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:12,880
medium yeah so that chiropractor though

2782
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:16,199
didn't want to lose Pride

2783
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:17,960
or ego or whatever the heck it was

2784
02:03:16,199 --> 02:03:19,520
however you want to say it and didn't

2785
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:23,360
want to say to the person who was

2786
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:24,840
bedridden look I talked to a guy he

2787
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:26,679
knows all about what's going on with

2788
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:28,679
your nervous system and he knows all

2789
02:03:26,679 --> 02:03:30,960
about what's going on with epen bar you

2790
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:33,400
need to at least try to contact him and

2791
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:35,440
if not contact him maybe I will because

2792
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:37,199
I'm a client of his and I'll contact him

2793
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:39,159
and tell him about your situation and

2794
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:41,440
maybe get some tips or something so I

2795
02:03:39,159 --> 02:03:42,719
can work through you through him but no

2796
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:45,520
he didn't do that because this

2797
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:47,079
chiropractor did not want to fess up

2798
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:49,119
that he didn't know anything about what

2799
02:03:47,079 --> 02:03:50,920
he was saying but he knew just enough to

2800
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:53,480
make it look like he knew something so

2801
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:56,079
the person who was sick in bed dying had

2802
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:58,440
no way to heal but guess what years

2803
02:03:56,079 --> 02:04:00,559
later that person found me years later

2804
02:03:58,440 --> 02:04:02,679
and told me personally what happened and

2805
02:04:00,559 --> 02:04:05,760
told me the chiropractor's name which

2806
02:04:02,679 --> 02:04:07,639
was a client of mine and it was so sad

2807
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:10,679
because the woman went through years of

2808
02:04:07,639 --> 02:04:13,199
suffering I'm talking years of suffering

2809
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:15,000
she asked him several times what more

2810
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:17,960
could she do and he withheld the

2811
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:19,920
information about me and epin bar and

2812
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:22,760
all that I knew and even working through

2813
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:24,719
me to help her and that is how it works

2814
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:26,400
and that's just one example of the

2815
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:28,400
thousands that's happening right now

2816
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:30,880
with medical medum information because

2817
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:33,199
yeah because it's dark and dirty and the

2818
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:35,480
health movement's dirty and nasty and

2819
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:36,920
stinky and slimy and you see it every

2820
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:38,719
day from the people running the ads to

2821
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:39,960
the medical me Community you see it

2822
02:04:38,719 --> 02:04:41,679
every day with them stealing the heavy

2823
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:42,920
metal detox information and the heavy

2824
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:45,719
metal information they would have never

2825
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:48,599
known you see it every day it's a gnarly

2826
02:04:45,719 --> 02:04:50,000
gnarly gross disgusting world out there

2827
02:04:48,599 --> 02:04:51,920
and people don't give a about The

2828
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,719
Chronic leil but they give a about

2829
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:55,480
the bottom line the money they make and

2830
02:04:53,719 --> 02:04:56,719
they want to reel in The Chronic leil so

2831
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:58,599
they could sell them all their and

2832
02:04:56,719 --> 02:05:01,599
programs and garbage and

2833
02:04:58,599 --> 02:05:01,599
everything

2834
02:05:02,119 --> 02:05:05,280
anyway all

2835
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:12,760
right and Harry says that was very evil

2836
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:16,280
it was very

2837
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:19,079
evil it's sad and it's unfair and what

2838
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:23,920
happened was this person believes that

2839
02:05:19,079 --> 02:05:23,920
God LED them to the first

2840
02:05:24,079 --> 02:05:28,440
book because that chiropractor didn't

2841
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:30,320
and that person suffered on mattress

2842
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:33,199
Island for another four

2843
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:35,440
years and they believe that the angels

2844
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:39,400
and God LED them to the first book and

2845
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:42,119
by chance somehow

2846
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:44,559
someway the door opened

2847
02:05:42,119 --> 02:05:47,639
up and they were able to tell me at a

2848
02:05:44,559 --> 02:05:50,239
live event at a live event when I was

2849
02:05:47,639 --> 02:05:53,360
walking through that that event at a

2850
02:05:50,239 --> 02:05:53,360

2015 they were able to tell me in the

2853
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:07,840

2862
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:33,719
supposed to go live in 10 minutes and

2863
02:06:31,119 --> 02:06:36,079
there was 3,000 people in the audience

2864
02:06:33,719 --> 02:06:38,719
just to see me in

2865
02:06:36,079 --> 02:06:41,840
2015 place was packed tickets were sold

2866
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:43,719
out and I sat down I pulled a chair to

2867
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:46,360
the corner and I sat down with that

2868
02:06:43,719 --> 02:06:48,559
person before going live and I saw

2869
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:50,400
people freaking out I saw the producer

2870
02:06:48,559 --> 02:06:52,040
users freaking out I saw everybody

2871
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:54,559
freaking out saying what the hell are

2872
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:56,599
you doing talking to that person and I

2873
02:06:54,559 --> 02:06:59,320
said just calm down I said wait calm

2874
02:06:56,599 --> 02:07:01,280
down I want to hear this story and I sat

2875
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:04,159
down and I heard that whole story right

2876
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:06,480
there right there about what happened

2877
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:08,159
and that's how screwed up our world is

2878
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:10,159
meanwhile that chiropractor had an

2879
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:12,079
opportunity to do the right thing that

2880
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:13,840
person was led to that chiropractor to

2881
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:16,119
be led back to Medical

2882
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:18,880
medium and the chiropractor made the

2883
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:22,199
wrong choice and that choice is is on

2884
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:24,000
their soul just like I see

2885
02:07:22,199 --> 02:07:25,280
chiropractors constantly like

2886
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,760
advertising to the medical medium

2887
