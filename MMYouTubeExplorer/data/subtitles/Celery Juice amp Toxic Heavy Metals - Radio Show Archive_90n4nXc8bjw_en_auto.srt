2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,760
find out what's making you sick and how

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,080
to heal Anthony William is the medical

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,439
medium hello this is Anthony William

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,560
you're listening to the medical medium

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,880
radio show where each week you hear the

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,679
most advanced healing information that's

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,720
decades ahead of what's out there now if

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,240
we think science and research knows

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,840
everything thing about chronic illness

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,960
we're actually blinded by something and

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,440
I don't know what that is exactly

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,800
besides maybe trust in the medical

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,039
system and maybe that happens when we've

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,719
never been sick we're we're not

16
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,079
struggling we're not suffering we

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,640
haven't gone to 10 neurologists I mean

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,160
I've talked to people over the years

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,440
that have come to me over the years I

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,520
decades ago that have gone to five or

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,399
eight or nine or 10 different

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,600
neurologists looking for answers about

23
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,280
their different symptoms 250 million

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,119
Americans alone in the US don't have

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,680
answers for symptoms they're dealing

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,119
with and if they have an answer it

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,560
doesn't mean it goes away and that's

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,080
what we're up against right now so when

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,119
you think about it you guys the science

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,280
of research know everything about

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,520
chronic illness they don't why would we

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,040
ever think so at this point and and you

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,840
know everything is blamed on us from

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,799
genes and also our bodies attacking

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,680
themselves we're told it's faulty you

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,320
know our bodies are faulty our bodies

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,040
are problematic and this is a example of

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,320
how the industry is because what science

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,439
and research does is it protects itself

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,680
before it protects people that's how it

41
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,040
works now not in every single field but

42
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,920
in chronic illness I'm not talking about

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,360
making Parts you know making nuts and

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,240
bolts nuts and bolts you know that are

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,479
put together so we have braces for our

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,439
legs and we have different kinds of

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,200
pieces of medical basically medical

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,680
equipment we need in all kinds of

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,479
different areas that science is working

50
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,600
hard to try to perfect so we can live a

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,000
better quality of life while we're sick

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm talking about every day aches and

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,800
pains the tingles and numbness the

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,280
vertigo the dizziness the balance issues

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,040
the headaches the migraines the anxiety

56
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,800
the depression I mean everything neck

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,920
pain back pain sciatica from everything

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,400
from planter fasciitis to bladder

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,480
infections constant chronic UTI uh sinus

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,400
infections that never go away to fungus

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,720
on the skin to eczema and psoriasis to

62
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,360
dermatitis to lyan scosi and Vitiligo to

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,920
all kinds of what's deemed autoimmune

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,159
diseases like Lyme disease and

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,640
rheumatoid arthritis and Hashim modus

66
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,120
thyroiditis to all these things we are

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,959
in a bad place and it hasn't gotten

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,239
better and yeah the world has gotten rid

69
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,400
of processed foods not the whole world a

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,319
lot of people are getting rid of

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,760
processed foods they're getting now

72
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,680
cleaner high fat diets versus the

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,720
dirtier high-fat diet so instead of

74
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,920
people getting fried grease with their

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,959
with their bread and you know their

76
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,760
bread and butter they're off their bread

77
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,799
a lot of people are off their bread and

78
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,680
they're off the fried grease and instead

79
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,680
they're eating you know like healthier

80
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,799
grease so they're eating their oils and

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,680
they're eating their nut Butters and all

82
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,879
that and that's actually healthier stuff

83
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,640
but the keto diets and the keto way of

84
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,680
thinking whether you're paleo whether

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,200
you're paleo keto whether you're high

86
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,159
protein keto whether you're plant-based

87
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,080
keto still isn't fixing everybody it

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,680
helps people with mild symptoms who have

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,200
been on all the different diets I mean

90
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,040
actually have you know it's been helped

91
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,400
it it's helped people with milder

92
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,360
symptoms who've eaten all not so great

93
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,319
and don't take care of themselves and

94
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,319
they seem to be okay but anybody else

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,959
chronically ill with real problems the

96
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,840
higher fat diets hasn't been helping and

97
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm going to talk about why cuz Today's

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,040
Show is about toxic heavy metals and how

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,079
the relationship of the higher fat diets

100
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,280
that we're on whether they're clean and

101
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,239
healthier ones right now okay how this

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
doesn't work with toxic heavy metals and

103
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,000
how toxic heavy metals are responsible

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
for all the brain fog the Alzheimer's

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,599
the Parkinson's the anxiety the

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,880
depression the memory issues the OCD and

107
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,359
that's just some of the things and these

108
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,880
toxic heavy metals they feed pathogen

109
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,800
illnesses that are not autoimmune it's

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,080
called fibromyalgia CFS Ms lime disease

111
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,039
these aren't autoimmune these aren't the

112
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,600
body attacking itself these are there's

113
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,320
real problems behind there these are

114
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,960
pathogens behind this has nothing to do

115
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,400
with autoimmune these are actually

116
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,520
viruses and bacteria reproductive system

117
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,960
problems econ rri it's PCOS and so much

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,639
more and in the celery juice book I hope

119
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,039
you guys have that celery juice book by

120
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,400
now because almost 200 symptoms and

121
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,800
conditions in that book I talk about

122
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,320
about what the causes are what causes it

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
and what to do for it this is an

124
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,199
important radio show it's we're going to

125
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,720
talk a little bit about the history on

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,639
heavy metals toxic heavy metals where

127
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,440
they come from and where we're going and

128
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,280
you have to know I love science and

129
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,919
research I love it and here's the funny

130
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,919
thing

131
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,400
hardcore conventional science and

132
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,360
research hates all the other science and

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,759
research so all the different things

134
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,800
everybody's citing around like science

135
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,919
science is behind that science is behind

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,600
that study science is behind what how

137
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,080
the Body Works science is behind this

138
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,319
about autoimmune or this and this and

139
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,440
this and no one

140
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,360
realizes that those sciences that are

141
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,319
all being created right now for even in

142
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,080
alternative medicine thrown every

143
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,000
everywhere like in in different

144
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,160
countries and in the United States and

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,600
everything that hardcore science

146
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,639
conventional science doesn't doesn't

147
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,280
back up any of it on any level so

148
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,800
everybody's throwing throwing around

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,759
different Sciences around every single

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,160
day but we use the word as if

151
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,039
everything's concrete and everybody's

152
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,280
happy and the Science World is all happy

153
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,360
the Science World is at war with itself

154
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,039
right now totally completely at war with

155
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,160
itself they're literally they're

156
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,800
literally battling each other there's

157
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,680
all kinds of different Sciences now and

158
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,039
alternative medicine and someone's

159
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,599
trying to prove the MTHFR G mutation

160
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,000
Theory which was a theory that's all it

161
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,520
was there's no science approve it till

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,639
this day there's not one single bit of

163
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,919
science regular science in conventional

164
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,919
world doesn't believe in the MTHFR gen

165
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,520
mutation they think that that's fake

166
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,599
science isn't that

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,560
incredible and because it actually is

168
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,639
skewed by the way but there's also

169
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,479
hardcore conventional science that's

170
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,479
skewed too because it all is there's a

171
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,919
reason for that in chronic illness

172
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,960
there's a reason for that agendas are

173
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,639
behind every single study they're behind

174
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,560
it all and guess what all the things

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,240
that make us sick are all avoided

176
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,199
everybody just you know has to stay sick

177
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
because of the wars because of the food

178
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,120
War because of the science War

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,919
everybody's got to stay sick that's how

180
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,960
it works the food war is like the the

181
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,560
animal High animal protein people

182
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,440
against the vegans against the plant

183
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,479
based there's that war and everybody's

184
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,800
throwing their F fake Sciences back and

185
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,759
forth you know the Paleo stuff this is

186
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,360
why paleo's better this is why vegan is

187
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,759
better this is why vegetarian's better

188
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,560
it's all being thrown everybody's

189
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,720
throwing their Sciences back and forth

190
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,360
while everybody else has to sit there

191
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,960
and suffer and get sick with their toxic

192
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,759
heavy metals why everybody has to sitck

193
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,599
there sit there and get and stay sick

194
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,400
and get sicker with their pathogens

195
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,000
their Epstein bar their hhv sixs their

196
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,039
um there different varieties of strepto

197
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,319
octus their shingles virus is their

198
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,639
herpes simplex ones and twos all the

199
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,400
mutations all the different varieties

200
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,360
everybody just has to sit around and get

201
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,840
sicker and sicker and sicker while the

202
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,199
animal protein people are against the

203
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,560
vegans vegans are against the animal

204
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,000
protein people they're all thrown away

205
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,400
bogus they're all thrown at each other

206
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,840
bogus bogus fake science and then at the

207
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,919
same time hardcore conventional science

208
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,599
where you know Harvard stands behind it

209
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,919
or whatever they're they're throwing

210
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,319
things they're they're they're doing

211
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:57,879
everything and throwing things at people

212
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,400
too at the at the what they think is the

213
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,800
alternative fake Sciences but they're

214
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,479
all backed by money and funding to try

215
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,039
to prove a point whether it's true

216
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,240
accurate not true whether a thumb is on

217
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,199
the scale they're all in it together and

218
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,800
all these wars are going on why

219
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,680
everybody just keeps on building heavy

220
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,440
metals in their liver and in their brain

221
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,919
doesn't know how to get it out of them

222
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,400
doesn't even know the first thing to get

223
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,919
it out of them and they get all the

224
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,400
different problems and neurological

225
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,080
problems and all the different viral

226
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,479
problems and all our all all the kids

227
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,840
are getting sick now teenagers all the

228
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,520
different young adults are getting sick

229
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,960
sicker than ever before in history we

230
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,599
never saw this 30 years ago and

231
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,240
everybody's busy with their War they're

232
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:36,839
funded Wars just think about that you

233
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,440
guys they're busy with their funded Wars

234
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,039
isn't that interesting don't you think

235
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,120
about it isn't it incredible where do I

236
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,040
sit in the middle of it I work for you

237
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,279
guys I work for God and I work for you

238
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,519
guys and look you may not believe in God

239
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,000
you may believe in something else that

240
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,080
it's a big light in the sky that it's

241
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,320
the universe maybe you believe in Gods

242
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
maybe you believe in something else

243
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,000
maybe you don't think it's a big man

244
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,200
sitting in a chair with a beard maybe

245
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,040
you think it's just this Creator or this

246
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,399
Creator power or whatever whatever you

247
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,240
might believe I I'm just saying whatever

248
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,200
it is you believe I work for that I work

249
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,320
for that and I work for you and that's

250
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,680
what I do and I hear the information

251
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,640
from my source since I was 4 years old

252
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,440
so that it isn't tampered with and isn't

253
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,680
tampered with and the wars don't

254
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,440
interfere with it exactly and we're

255
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,600
going to talk about heavy metals and

256
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,200
that's where we're going right now so

257
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,160
where did all these heavy metals come

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,519
from that are inside our body wreaking

259
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,480
havoc how could heavy metals be in your

260
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,079
body how can it be possible first things

261
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,240
first medications all medications have

262
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,839
Metals in them all medications have

263
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,720
Metals in them they end up in the liver

264
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,880
that's where they end up let's go to

265
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,800
another one fluoride are we getting

266
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,279
fluoride treatments did you have 10 of

267
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
them did you have five of them did you

268
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,600
have one of them did you have a whole

269
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,120
bunch of them when you were younger

270
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,160
fluoride how about that one

271
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,720
what about our water cuz you got to

272
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,040
remember fluoride I'll just first of all

273
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,760
let's back into this a little bit so I

274
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
can clarify medications have Metals in

275
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,120
them yes they have copper in them they

276
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,680
have aluminum in them they got all kinds

277
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,519
of stuff mercury in them they just have

278
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,200
medications have things in them bottom

279
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,480
line fluoride that's aluminum someone

280
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,320
said to me and a trying to debate me on

281
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,880
this and said no no fluoride's not

282
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:30,640
aluminum it's a byproduct I'm like oh my

283
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,640
God can we be any more or whatever you

284
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,240
want to call that I don't know what that

285
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,600
is you know when I get done talking to

286
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,920
somebody like that I say you know what

287
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,240
they just don't know and then in back of

288
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,839
my head I'm like how can they not know

289
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,880
so what is it are they just fighting for

290
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,480
something just to prove themselves right

291
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,920
or something fluoride a byproduct is

292
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,240
methyl aluminum no matter how you slice

293
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,120
the cake look none of us are all

294
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,959
supposed to have the answers I totally

295
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,680
get that we're all working hard together

296
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,120
on the planet and that's not it I'm

297
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,760
talking about health professionals that

298
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,240
deem themselves at the top of their game

299
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,440
and they want to debate me purposely

300
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,440
because I hear a voice and they don't

301
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,839
like the fact that that's where it's

302
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,600
coming from and that's what I'm talking

303
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,920
about I'm not talking about all of us

304
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,360
that you know are just trying to find

305
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,519
our way and get through everything and

306
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,440
we're we're not supposed to know where

307
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,079
medals are or where they come from or

308
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,720
what they are we're just not we're too

309
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,160
busy trying to survive think about that

310
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,639
everybody's too busy trying to survive

311
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,839
and live their life and get through

312
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:31,760
their day and work their job and try to

313
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,160
and try to get through and and through

314
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,040
what struggle and whatever emotional

315
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,360
challenges we get that's what's going on

316
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,360
I'm talking about professionals that are

317
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,880
supposed to be on top of their game and

318
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,639
think they are or say they are you know

319
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,000
and and and look we're all learn you

320
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,560
know I told this professional I said

321
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,839
look if you don't know

322
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,519
fluoride in the end is a toxic heavy

323
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,200
metal to the body then then why don't

324
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,440
you learn about it you no big deal and

325
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,320
if you don't know about it fine but but

326
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,079
no this person was head head hellbent

327
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,560
really just to be like no it's it it's

328
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,519
not toxic to anybody first of all it's a

329
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,399
neurotoxin it's a

330
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,440
neurotoxin and it's you know it's

331
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,839
nobody's it's nobody's fault it's

332
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,079
nobody's fault but the big

333
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,399
Industries it's nobody's fault but the

334
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,199
big big

335
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,920
industry and so there's nobody to blame

336
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:23,079
there's nobody to blame on that level I

337
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,560
mean they're the industries to blame

338
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,959
what about our water too it's a whole

339
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,199
another thing I mean we there's Metals

340
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:30,800
in our water absolutely I mean how many

341
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,519
water guys have I talked to over the

342
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,720
years that are like you know any kind of

343
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,279
apartment I've ever been in or any kind

344
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,839
of different living situation I always

345
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,040
have a water guy come and just do a

346
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,240
little test of my water it's like oh

347
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,000
yeah you're you know what you're you're

348
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,839
doing good something pars per million

349
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,120
lead not actually perfectly agreeable

350
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,760
EPA safe and then you got no just very

351
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,880
little traces of arsenic totally in

352
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,160
range of what we're allowed to have I'm

353
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,240
like are you kidding

354
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,800
me and he was like okay yeah that's her

355
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,560
water stand standard that's like our

356
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,120
water standard there's all that stuff is

357
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,000
in our water I mean it really is it's

358
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,720
like yeah but it's not above the what

359
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,160
you know the APA caus dangerous TOS what

360
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,959
do you mean like this stuff goes in the

361
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,639
liver and builds up and how much water

362
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,240
are you drinking and not drinking I'm

363
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:21,240
sorry for giggling about this I'm just

364
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:25,959
saying that it's almost like so obvious

365
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:29,000
that it just it it hurts it just does um

366
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:31,639
and then our air I mean you know there's

367
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,480
Metals dropping out of the sky in

368
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,360
abundance in

369
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,880
abundance you know I mean I was talking

370
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,320
to somebody in the spiritual movement

371
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,800
and they're like yeah I believe in

372
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,240
abundance this person was telling me and

373
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,320
you I got a lot of respect for this

374
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,839
person they're like I believe in

375
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,760
abundance it's all about an abundance

376
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,440
and I said and they

377
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,720
said and they said to me and they said

378
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,920
to me this person said to me Anthony

379
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,040
like what's your whole Mantra like

380
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,680
what's your whole thing and I'm like

381
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,800
well I just just know that there's an

382
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,160
abundance of toxic heavy metals raining

383
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,079
out of the sky I know it's Doom and

384
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,120
Gloom but if I don't stay aware of it

385
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,040
and teach others so we can get it out of

386
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,360
our body because it's going to be there

387
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,279
I want to get it out of everybody's body

388
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,800
so they can heal you know I can't and

389
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,240
you know it was funny and the spiritual

390
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,440
person spiritual Guru was like you know

391
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,040
I never thought about that they were

392
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,680
like I never thought about that they

393
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,680
like I'm always worried I just always

394
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,000
want abundance to come to me like and

395
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,199
come to me that's what this person was

396
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,399
saying

397
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,199
and I was like I look that's amazing but

398
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,959
I just want the abundance of metals out

399
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,759
of people's bodies that's what I want

400
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,279
and that's what I live for you know it's

401
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,440
like it's you know because that's how

402
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,120
much we're up against aluminum cans have

403
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,240
you have you consumed anything out of an

404
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,839
aluminum can or aluminum foil have you

405
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,680
eaten anything out of aluminum foil I

406
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,959
mean right I I knew somebody that worked

407
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,920
at a restaurant and said the aluminum

408
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,279
foil they use was low grade and I was

409
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,519
like low grade that's right low grade

410
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,000
aluminum foil and they said yeah and

411
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,800
they said every time they would bake

412
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,519
like a macaroni and cheese in the oven

413
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,040
at this restaurant they would put the

414
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,639
foil over the top and they'd bake the

415
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,160
macaroni and cheese and stuff like that

416
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,440
and then they remove the foil and pieces

417
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,959
of foil were just they melt it off of

418
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:20,120
the foil into the macaroni and cheese

419
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,079
and so the bottom line is the bottom

420
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,440
line is so listen I'm telling you all

421
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,959
these things because we get exposed and

422
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,920
how many sticks of gum has everybody

423
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,360
been eating all these years you know the

424
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,639
foil and n it's really incredible what

425
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,680
about pots and pans you know it's like

426
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:38,160
even the stainless steel pots and pans

427
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,759
stainless steel pots and pans that we

428
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,160
deal with in the restaurants I've seen

429
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,600
pots scraped to the Bone a friend of

430
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,399
mine years ago at a restaurant people

431
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,360
were just scraping the pots with metal

432
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,480
utensils where do you think all those

433
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,160
metal shavings went they went in

434
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,279
somebody's meal and they went in lots of

435
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,839
meals I mean restaurants are like one of

436
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:04,480
the most toxic heavy metal providing

437
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,160
Industries for everybody and we fill a

438
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,959
lifetime of up in using you know those

439
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,079
those just feel a lifetime of eating out

440
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,560
in restaurants I'm not trying to keep

441
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,000
you living in a box I'm not trying to

442
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,880
get you guys to just live in a little

443
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,480
box and never experience the world

444
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,480
that's not what I'm trying to do I just

445
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,959
want to get the medals out of you faster

446
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,319
than we're putting them in how about

447
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,959
that I'm just going to repeat that I

448
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:30,240
know it's annoying I'm probably annoying

449
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,839
today but the bottom line is I want to

450
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,040
get the metals out of you faster than

451
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,920
we're putting them in that's the bottom

452
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,600
line and then let's keep on going a

453
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,279
little bit long I'm not even talking

454
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,759
about old metal fillings I'm not even

455
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:48,440
talking about those those silver

456
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:51,120
fillings of the old days I mean how many

457
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,720
how many times did the industry try to

458
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,480
protect those metal fillings how many

459
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,839
times have they protected those metal

460
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,160
fillings to the point where everybody's

461
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,639
getting ceramic right now but they stood

462
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,640
by it the industry stood by it because

463
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,240
Mercury was mandatory in the

464
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,240
conventional standard to get into people

465
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,959
how do you like that it's just

466
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,319
unbelievable we thought we were ahead of

467
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,799
the game long time ago with that one and

468
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,839
that's what I mean science of research

469
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:22,839
proves itself as a bomb every time every

470
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,079
decade it's always wrong but we heralded

471
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:29,720
is this unbelievable thing that's always

472
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,559
right I mean come on are you sick of it

473
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,360
yet and then what about and listen think

474
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,760
about the metal fillings and the Mercury

475
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,120
fillings what we had to deal with and

476
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,559
what people are still dealing with

477
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,760
that's not a problem that went away I

478
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,480
know people with plenty of metal

479
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,039
fillings in their mouth I mean it's not

480
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,799
like it's gone everybody's dealing with

481
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:49,200
it a lot of them have these little these

482
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,880
little metal fillings and big metal

483
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,159
fillings in today just plenty of them

484
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,960
copper pipes yeah copper pipes oh maybe

485
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,320
your house doesn't have copper pipes old

486
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,320
copper pipes pipes but maybe a friend's

487
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,919
house did and you stayed over and had a

488
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,760
couple tea 5 years ago yeah cup of tea

489
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,200
you know it's unbelievable how easy it

490
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,400
is to get all these Metals in us and

491
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,960
that's just one

492
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,280
thing pesticides herbicides fungicides

493
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,559
have you eaten organic since you were

494
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,360
born because pesticides herbicides

495
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,120
fungicides are ladened in Copper ladened

496
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,240
in Copper toxic

497
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,640
copper it it look I can fill the whole

498
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,840
show with all this fun stuff this part

499
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,400
right here

500
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,200
I really can't but let me go a little

501
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,600
further back let me go a little further

502
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,880
back than this let's go into Quicks

503
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,919
silver Quicksilver is a tonic from the

504
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,520
17 and 1800s that everybody drank when

505
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,760
they went to the doctor that's it you

506
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,840
wouldn't go to the doctor and leave

507
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,760
without Quicksilver Quicksilver was

508
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Mercury heated up in a tube with a with

509
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:59,080
a a flame a candle underneath it in

510
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,440
water till the Mercury would kind of

511
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,320
separate itself just enough and out gas

512
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,120
into that into that fluid into that

513
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,640
liquid and then they pour it into a

514
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,159
little cup and you drink it that's what

515
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,360
that's what everybody did didn't matter

516
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,159
what was wrong with you you come in

517
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,520
there the element the the conventional

518
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:22,039
standard the conventional standard was

519
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,280
Quicksilver bottom line a Mercury drink

520
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,960
and all your forefathers drank it I

521
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,640
don't care what anybody says I'm going

522
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,240
to tell you right now I I don't care

523
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,039
what anybody says cuz somebody said to

524
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,559
me there's no way my my grandparents

525
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,080
drank that or my great-grandparents or

526
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:37,000
their grand great grandparents drank

527
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,120
that not in my life there's no way not

528
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,840
in my family line you're wrong I if they

529
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,720
went then they never went to a doctor

530
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,640
once in their life during the 1800s

531
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,320
that's what it means and I would say

532
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,919
that okay so that means that their whole

533
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,480
lifetime they never went to the doctor

534
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:59,080
once not even in their childhood not

535
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,320
even once for a fever back in the 1800s

536
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,559
because that's the only way they can

537
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,679
avoid Quicks over so if you can

538
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,200
guarantee that for me then I will

539
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,280
believe you if you can't guarantee that

540
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,360
I'll never believe you never because

541
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,919
everybody went to the doctor at least

542
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,720
once and drank that tonic children

543
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,280
included that's what was done that was

544
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,640
the that was the standard of science and

545
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,919
research you know what

546
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,440
happened no one would see the doctors

547
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,200
that the medical establishment was

548
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,559
running out of money and

549
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,360
collapsing collapsing down F the House

550
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:33,960
of Cards was falling by the late by the

551
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,240
mid

552
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,080
1800s no one went to the doctor anymore

553
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,600
and I'll tell you why because the word

554
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,240
quack was for the conventional doctor

555
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,880
not for the herbalist down the road not

556
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,559
for the chiropractor down the road that

557
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,159
believes in some kind of energy medicine

558
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,840
not for the naturopathic doctor that

559
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,840
have they have more respect now not for

560
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,840
anybody else not for any kind of person

561
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,440
not for any kind of healer quack wasn't

562
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,080
the word for any of them quack was the

563
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,480
word for the conventional doctor because

564
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,320
by the mid

565
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,279
1850s everybody thought that if you went

566
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,279
to them and drank that tonic you would

567
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:20,240
come home with Madness

568
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,279
Insanity so they called them the Quack

569
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,880
Like quack like a duck you'd come home

570
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,720
in Hyster like an hysterical manner from

571
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,120
the Mercury sometimes there logically

572
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,159
riddled in

573
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,520
Madness and that's how you would come

574
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,039
home and that's why they they deemed the

575
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,159
conventional doctor of the quack but

576
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,520
what happened

577
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,640
was it boomed a business that never was

578
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,840
thought of as anything it boomed the

579
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,480
Alternative Market for the first time

580
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,520
that's why holistic medicine started it

581
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:57,039
exploded Homeopathy

582
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,559
Chiropractic all of it it exploded

583
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,520
naturopathy

584
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,520
herbalism it

585
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,919
exploded it came to life because it was

586
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,840
where everybody went to by the turn of

587
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,200
the

588
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,919
century to stay away from the quacks

589
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,200
isn't it interesting right interesting

590
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,400
and then the quacks needed to take

591
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,960
control so they advertised they no

592
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,919
longer used Quicksilver there was a

593
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,600
massive funding and medical back and

594
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:29,400
funded campaign to save the conventional

595
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,880
model and it was a huge advertising

596
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,080
campaign by the late 1800s we no longer

597
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,360
use Quicksilver please come to us we no

598
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,039
longer use Quicksilver please come to

599
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,039
us that's what would happen the only

600
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,120
people the quacks would be servicing at

601
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,440
that point were the people at the

602
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,880
sanitariums people that were already

603
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,679
having problems with Madness even sane

604
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,799
people that were just stuck in the

605
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,159
sanitariums and that's the only people

606
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,559
that a conventional doctor ever worked

607
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,640
on anymore because no one would go to

608
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,919
the doctor they would go to herbalist

609
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,760
and every everybody

610
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,360
else so just a little history but here's

611
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,400
the problem we all have mercury in us

612
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,279
because of it we all have mercury passed

613
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,640
down to Generation generation through

614
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:15,360
utero all of it that's how we have it

615
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,720
and we still do and it's been building

616
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,480
up and we have mercury in other places

617
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,440
too so there's a little bit of History

618
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,520
just so you know it's important metals

619
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,200
are microscopic they can't be seen

620
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,000
they're they're smaller than

621
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,240
nanoscopic they can't be seen

622
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,799
and what you don't see won't hurt that's

623
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,799
what the industry always thinks we don't

624
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,600
see it you're fine Mr Mrs Jones you're

625
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:41,080
you guys are fine we don't see it so it

626
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,960
can't be a problem toxic heavy metals

627
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,880
are a particular type of toxin that

628
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,320
celery juices sodium cluster salts take

629
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,440
on so we're talking about celery juice

630
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,600
too celery juice helps with toxic heavy

631
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,720
metals we're going to go into that a

632
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,960
little

633
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,880
bit heavy metals have a destructive

634
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,760
active charge to them that causes the

635
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,320
metals to be Dam damaging to the liver

636
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,720
cells brain cells and other cells

637
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,760
throughout the body cluster salts sodium

638
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,279
cluster salts diffuse this charge

639
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,159
rendering them inactive and less

640
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,240
aggressive think about how powerful that

641
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,760
is when you're drinking your celery

642
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,799
juice all the sodium cluster salts are

643
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,000
in C juice that science of research

644
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,080
doesn't know about

645
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,200
yet that doesn't know about yet you

646
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,440
think science of research knows

647
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,640
everything you think they know

648
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,559
everything they don't it's so important

649
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,880
to know that and understand

650
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:31,240
that because you're going to need you're

651
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,360
going to need different information

652
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,399
because this world's not easy to go in

653
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,200
and people already are suffering to a

654
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:41,360
degree that's unbelievable from young to

655
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,399
old so you need Advanced

656
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,679
information and these sodium cluster

657
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:47,840
salts they diffuse the charge rendering

658
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,880
them inactive and less

659
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,679
aggressive they disarm toxic heavy

660
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,919
metals such as copper Mercury and

661
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,760
aluminum and there's other metals too

662
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,840
there's

663
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,840
nickel there's arsenic there's a lot of

664
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,360
different Metals there

665
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,240
cadmium and you know barium there's

666
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,559
different Metals celery juices

667
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,559
antioxidants is another thing that we

668
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,000
need really desperately one of the

669
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,039
functions of the celery juices

670
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,159
antioxidants not just not other

671
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:23,320
antioxidants is to remove fatty deposits

672
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,720
from the heavy metal CU this is what I

673
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,240
was talking about earlier we on these

674
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,919
high fat

675
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,919
diets we on high fat diets all the time

676
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,039
and high fat diets means we saturate our

677
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:38,279
bodies with with with fats that's how it

678
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:40,360
works metals that sit and oxidize inside

679
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:43,320
our body oxidize faster when our

680
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,279
bloodstream is filled with fat so we're

681
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,240
all told to be on these high fat diets

682
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,960
right now that's what we're told all the

683
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,120
vegans and plant-based people they're

684
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,120
just going all to high fat that's what

685
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,679
they do all of the you know the the high

686
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,120
protein people paleo people animal

687
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,640
protein people they all go to high fat

688
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,159
and this is what everybody's doing and

689
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,720
they're all mixing it all up they're all

690
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,320
mixing it all up the nut Butters and

691
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,520
everything else they all that nut

692
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,720
Butters are healthy but you know in just

693
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,559
in small quantities periodically because

694
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,559
we need more other things that are more

695
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,679
critical so we're all heading to the

696
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,640
keto land because it keeps you off of

697
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,200
processed foods it gets you exercising a

698
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,559
little bit gets a few pounds off the

699
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,880
belly for a lot of people not everybody

700
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,240
but for a lot of people when they first

701
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,440
go on it after getting off the standard

702
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,679
American

703
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,159
diet and so they're into the keto thing

704
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:33,840
and they think they found a Holy Grail

705
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,480
the the health professionals today think

706
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,360
the keto thing is a Holy Grail but what

707
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,799
it is it's just no

708
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,880
grains it's no sugar which is bad sugar

709
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,760
cuz no one ever ate fruit

710
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,000
anyway so it's just bad sugar staying

711
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,440
off of bad sugar staying off of

712
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,919
processed food staying off of Grease

713
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,679
staying off of um of high processed

714
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,399
greased fatty fast food and go for the

715
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,159
healthier fats

716
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:01,600
so that's what it means and everybody

717
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,159
does get a little bit better that's why

718
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,399
I don't even I don't even mind the keto

719
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:05,840
diet to some degree because if it'll

720
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:07,799
keep somebody off the standard American

721
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,679
diet and keep them from eating fried

722
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,880
fast food they're going to do better but

723
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,080
when we're chronically ill and we're

724
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,240
suffering and struggling we have

725
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,679
symptoms that won't go away that hasn't

726
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,679
fixed anybody that's not getting those

727
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,399
real real serious pathogen and toxic

728
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,880
heavy metal symptoms to go away in fact

729
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:25,000
it does the opposite when we have the

730
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,600
toxic heavy metals the more fat we put

731
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,520
into our body the more they oxidize the

732
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,919
fats cling to the metals and cause them

733
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,840
to rush and Decay and

734
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:39,440
oxidize and that's what they do and we

735
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,080
faster deteriorate later we age faster

736
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,080
in the brain we deteriorate later and

737
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,240
that's what

738
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,080
happens and those antioxidants and

739
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,320
celery juice help to separate the fat

740
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,760
deposits from the

741
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,519
metal they act like suction cups see

742
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,480
here's how it works fatty deposits cling

743
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,080
to toxic heavy metal deposits like SU

744
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,519
ction cups and when fatty deposits and

745
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,320
toxic heavy metals touch like this it

746
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:09,440
causes the metals to

747
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:11,559
oxidize byproduct of the metal develops

748
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,919
discharge that's what

749
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:18,279
happens a production

750
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,799
occurs toxic heavy metals possess a

751
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,720
destructive charge which is part of what

752
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,840
causes them to reative fatty deposits to

753
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,880
begin with and and other toxic heavy

754
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,559
metals aggressively so that means if you

755
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,000
have other tox heavy metals they mix

756
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:36,240
with other metals they

757
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,200
oxidize they they they discharge toxic

758
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,679
charges essentially we're talking about

759
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,840
heavy metals rusting in the body leading

760
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,960
to corrosive runoff that is damaging to

761
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,360
nearby

762
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,600
tissue think about that that's what

763
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,720
happens that that's what

764
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,919
happens so sure if we're on a really

765
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,519
really toxic high fat diet which is a

766
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:05,080
standard American diet we get we get the

767
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:08,399
Alzheimer's quicker we get um dementia

768
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,559
quicker we get memory problems quicker

769
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,799
we get all kinds of different issues

770
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,440
quicker in the brain we get

771
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,720
crystallizations in the brain we get

772
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,279
calcifications in the brain we get all

773
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,279
kinds of different spots in the brain we

774
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,039
age our brain

775
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,519
shrinks so taking people off the

776
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:25,440
standard American diet and putting them

777
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,440
on a healthy high-fat diet improves them

778
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,840
and slows all that down but by no means

779
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,440
means does it stop the process of the

780
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,360
metals causing dementia Alzheimer's

781
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,000
memory problems crystallizations

782
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,559
calcifications in the

783
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,640
brain it doesn't stop any of this or

784
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,880
liver issues or other toxic issues in

785
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,080
the body like feeding viruses and making

786
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,720
viruses get worse why do you think you

787
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,760
got people on all kinds of diets you got

788
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,000
people on clean paleo diets they're sick

789
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,760
they're sick with chronic fatigue I

790
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,039
thought that I thought the the Paleo

791
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,080
would fix them right wouldn't you think

792
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:00,200
so no people on plant-based diet sick

793
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,600
with chronic fatigue plant-based diet

794
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,600
didn't fix them people on all these

795
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,000
different diets chronically sick with

796
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,679
all kinds of problems different diets

797
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,240
everywhere whether they're on the you

798
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,679
know one side of it or the other side of

799
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,200
it animal non-animal whatever it

800
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:17,440
is and they still suffer everybody's

801
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,880
still dealing with their problems and

802
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,320
symptoms going to different doctors then

803
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,200
the doctors blame the diet like the

804
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,640
vegan diet or they'll blame this and

805
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,919
that and it's back and forth you go to

806
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,159
another doctor it's great when you're

807
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,159
young and you're not really sick and

808
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,840
you're exercising every day and you just

809
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,559
got like little problems like really

810
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,480
little ones but you take a mom who can't

811
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,799
get out of bed with all she's got just

812
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,480
to drive her kids to school because of

813
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:45,120
crippling anxiety or severe fatigue with

814
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,919
no answers abound and she's trying the

815
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,559
best keto diet possible and she's trying

816
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,279
the best plant-based diet possible she's

817
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,919
trying the best animal diet possible and

818
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,240
she's gone to 10 doctors already and two

819
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,159
functional medicine doctors and two

820
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,960
neurologists and two internists and

821
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,600
still can't get to where she needs to be

822
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,200
the keto diet's not going to fix it the

823
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,399
plantbase diet's not going to fix it you

824
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,200
need more than that you need information

825
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:10,600
because you can do plant-based high fat

826
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,320
and still keep yourself sick you can do

827
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,919
keto Paleo High fat animal protein high

828
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,919
fat and keep yourself sick even if

829
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:18,919
you're staying away from bad sugar and

830
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,200
processed

831
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:24,559
foods because the metals oxidize and

832
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,559
feed pathogens that's where we're going

833
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,399
next fatty deposits all throughout the

834
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:33,159
body

835
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:35,320
discharge because they're attached to

836
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,200
heavy metals that are oxidizing and

837
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:43,000
rusting so all of this just throws out a

838
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:46,360
throws out a problem it throws out a

839
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,200
problem as a result the fatty deposit

840
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,000
becomes highly

841
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,120
toxic and it can act as fuel for guess

842
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,480
what so those fatty deposits they're cor

843
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,519
that hold all that corrosive rust and

844
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,120
material and it's holding on to it

845
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:04,279
becomes this powerful food in a bad way

846
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,399
to viruses like gapin bar viruses like

847
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:11,440
the shingles human herpes viral 6 that's

848
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:14,440
hhv6 hhv7 undiscovered hhv 10 11 12 13

849
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,080
14 15 16 yeah that's how many viruses

850
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,720
are out there and their undiscovered

851
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,960
cousins and any other kind of pathogen

852
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,679
that may even reach the brain causing a

853
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,159
myriad of problems and conditions

854
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,080
undiagnosed and so

855
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,240
these

856
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,159
viruses they like to feed off of this

857
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,480
discharge that heavy metals create and

858
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:38,080
remember all this is happening while

859
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,399
everybody's asleep everybody's the food

860
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,600
Wars are going on everybody's throwing

861
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,960
their fake science back and forth

862
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,320
constantly this study here let's site

863
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,919
this but there's really no information

864
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,399
really in it in the end let's site this

865
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,080
let's site that let's keep on throwing

866
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:54,039
these theories around that are funded

867
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,200
and thumbed basically a thumb on the

868
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,120
scale all interest groups behind it

869
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,440
let's keep on let's keep keep the war

870
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,120
going you know let's the vegans keep on

871
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,840
fighting the paleos but no everybody's

872
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,840
sick though everybody's still

873
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,240
sick and so because there's more

874
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,240
information to be had there's more

875
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,399
information to be learned let's keep the

876
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,080
food Wars going let's keep the science

877
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:16,440
Wars going hardcore conventional science

878
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,039
in the in Harvard and and and yeah hard

879
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,679
you know hardcore science all all upset

880
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,200
at the alternative Sciences so

881
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:23,960
alternative science is all upet about

882
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,399
them they're all thrown or all kinds of

883
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,080
stuff around why everybody's sick

884
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:31,120
because everybody's too busy fting each

885
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,159
other and then your Metals they're

886
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,720
oxidizing no one cares no one gives a

887
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,600
heck and then our brains are still

888
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,279
shrinking our brains are still rotting

889
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,880
cells are being filled with Metals

890
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:45,519
pathogens are creating hashimotos

891
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,720
thyroiditis rheumatoid arthritis

892
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,000
fibromyalgia mecfs lime disease multiple

893
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,559
sclerosis that's just a name a few exmos

894
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,679
psoriasis that's just a name a few

895
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,840
that's nothing I mean I can go a 100

896
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,200
illnesses there's lupus there's all of

897
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,120
them them and that's I mean that's just

898
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,840
a few of

899
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,000
them if you if you know a name of one

900
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,119
then yeah it's that and in the book

901
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,480
celery juice book I cover almost 200

902
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,760
different symptoms and conditions and

903
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,800
there what what's happening what the

904
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,240
cause is and what celery juice is

905
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,280
doing severe mental and physical

906
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,560
deterioration such as Alzheimer's ALS

907
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,560
and Parkinson's metals can cause that

908
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,480
metals and

909
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,079
pathogens so this is all important

910
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,480
information it's critical to know how

911
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,760
does celery juice help celery juices

912
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,040
antioxidants help prevent toxic heavy

913
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,079
metals from decaying by removing the

914
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:42,399
fatty deposits from around the heavy

915
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:45,159
metal deposit and then coating the

916
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,000
metals to discourage oxidation that's

917
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,320
what these antioxidants do sodium

918
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,280
cluster salts attached to celery juices

919
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,440
antioxidant diffusing toxic toxic heavy

920
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,960
metals destructive charge toxic heavy

921
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,920
metals have a destructive charge in in

922
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,000
the body rendering these Metals much

923
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,560
less aggressive when you have the sodium

924
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,760
cluster salt involved so toxic heavy

925
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,720
metals have a destructive charge a

926
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:13,320
sodium cluster salt attaches itself to

927
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,000
the antioxidant and celery juice both of

928
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,200
these two chemical compounds diffuse the

929
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,760
top the Mercury and the aluminum and the

930
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,880
copper the destructive charge that

931
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,880
occurs from those rendering them less

932
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,400
aggressive this this isn't any any

933
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,480
information you can find out there this

934
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,160
is from the celeres book this is from my

935
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,040
source this is untampered with this

936
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,760
information it's pure it's clean there's

937
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,040
no agendas behind

938
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:43,359
it so this destructive charge is

939
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:46,480
neutralized celery juice is special

940
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,880
antioxidants can stop oxidation much

941
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,119
more

942
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,000
effectively and that's the difference

943
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,720
between those antioxidants and other

944
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,760
ones let's talk about Alzheimer's let's

945
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,119
talk about dementia let's talk about

946
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,040
memory issues a little bit these are

947
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:04,400
diseases we all fear of falling into as

948
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,839
we age and medical research and science

949
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,760
has no answers to them they don't have

950
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:11,079
any answers to them I know that in it's

951
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,400
really good-hearted people in the

952
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,680
alternative Sciences are actually trying

953
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,280
to get people to eat better with

954
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,119
Alzheimer's and try to reverse some of

955
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,760
the symptoms and then they they wave a

956
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,640
flag like oh my God we did it like by

957
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,440
golly we did it we did it we can do we

958
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,440
can do something now we can do uh series

959
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,359
or a documentary on this or maybe we can

960
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,599
write a new book or maybe whatever we're

961
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,000
getting people a little bit better by

962
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,960
getting them off of processed foods I

963
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,160
mean that's great that's great it still

964
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,480
has nothing to do with what's really

965
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,440
causing the problem how to get the

966
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,480
problem

967
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,520
remedied and not just being on the high

968
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,160
fat diet by just reducing processed

969
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,240
foods because it's not going to end the

970
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:55,200
problem it's not we are just victims to

971
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,599
these diseases that completely can they

972
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,680
strip us of the most precious

973
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,280
memories where we can't even recognize

974
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,079
our own family anymore sure and if we

975
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,800
could reverse that a little bit by E

976
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,400
eating cleaner it's it's a wonderful

977
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,839
thing but we got to do better than that

978
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,839
with all these different illnesses all

979
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,000
of

980
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:14,960
them because we can't just hang our hat

981
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,200
on that where we clean up some diets a

982
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,760
little bit we need this Advanced

983
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,640
information about how metals are rotting

984
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,200
and rusting in the brain and in the body

985
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,680
and in the tissue and in the liver and

986
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,160
other places of the body and how to get

987
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,760
those Metals out that's what we

988
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,880
need and people don't even know metals

989
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,240
are causing these problems out there the

990
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,880
industry doesn't even know they don't

991
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,000
even believe metals are really causing

992
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,880
these problems with the brain it's still

993
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,319
where no one really

994
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,040
knows and that's a devastating place to

995
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:48,000
be memory issues can occur in many

996
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,760
different ways whether in the form of

997
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,280
trouble receiving long-term memories

998
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,920
losing short-term memories or even

999
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,400
fluctuations or short-term and long-term

1000
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:03,400
memory issues flip back and forth it's

1001
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,160
important to know the bottom line is we

1002
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,680
have to get the metals out so we're not

1003
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,880
dealing with problems it's

1004
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,640
critical you know we're talking about

1005
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,000
more than those days when you're busy

1006
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,119
and you're just misplacing your

1007
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,720
belongings your car keys maybe even

1008
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,560
forgetting where you parked at a busy

1009
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:23,839
shopping center although celery juice

1010
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:27,000
helps with that kind of problem

1011
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,880
too you know it does weigh more than

1012
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,280
that it does more than what we forget in

1013
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,960
a day where we have so many different

1014
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,119
tasks and so many things on our plate

1015
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,240
when we talk about memory issues such as

1016
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,040
alz Alzheimer's disease or dementia what

1017
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,240
we're talking about without real

1018
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,440
realizing it is toxic heavy metals are

1019
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,800
inside the brain that's what we're

1020
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,119
talking about without realizing it that

1021
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,280
toxic heavy metals are sitting inside

1022
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,319
the brain that's what's going on with

1023
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Alzheimer's disease and

1024
00:38:54,319 --> 00:39:00,440
dementia the most common being Mercury

1025
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,760
the other one being aluminum close

1026
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:07,319
Runners up copper nickel cadmium lead

1027
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,720
and Arsenic and here's the thing you

1028
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:10,560
guys like this is really important to

1029
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,480
know right here if you want to know a

1030
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,119
really good piece of information I

1031
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,520
nobody knows everybody has a different

1032
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:22,040
volume a different level of toxic heavy

1033
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:24,440
metals in the brain in different

1034
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,880
combinations with some metals directly

1035
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:32,400
Crossing each other's paths which makes

1036
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:34,880
them interact causing depression anxiety

1037
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,720
anxiousness causing

1038
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,599
bipolar causing

1039
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:43,599
Mania causing schizophrenia causing just

1040
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,760
regular mild depression that's

1041
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,319
unexplainable causing unexplainable

1042
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,640
sadness then we end up at a psychiatr

1043
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:53,560
psychiatrist office went up at a psych

1044
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,200
doctor's office and they're just trying

1045
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,000
to like go through a childhood and stuff

1046
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,440
when when are sadness and depression is

1047
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,560
metals that are just basically fusing to

1048
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,880
each

1049
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:06,520
other and you know it's amazing how it

1050
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,599
works we end up taking some you know

1051
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,240
psych meds that we that we need to to

1052
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:12,000
survive because some of these some of

1053
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,200
the people some of these doctors they're

1054
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,640
like I don't I don't know what else to

1055
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,400
offer you and and the people they need

1056
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,200
something to get them by so I don't

1057
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,480
blame anybody for using anything they've

1058
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,000
had to use but then the medications have

1059
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,640
more Metals in them and then they end up

1060
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,280
in in liver and the medications and the

1061
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,960
metals end up in the liver it's just not

1062
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,359
an easy path and I completely understand

1063
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,359
I mean so many people struggle and

1064
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:36,839
suffer it's

1065
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,760
unbelievable memory issues occur when

1066
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:42,720
those Metals oxidize when they Collide

1067
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,000
when they cross when the paths are cross

1068
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,640
oxidizing Metals lead to a discharge a

1069
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,040
very potent one think about a patch of

1070
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:55,599
metal rusting on an old car when cars

1071
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,960
were metal I mean so many young people

1072
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,640
listening to this podcast that you know

1073
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,240
they just think cars aren't you know

1074
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,400
they don't know what cars are cars are

1075
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,200
plastic we drive around with plastic

1076
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,520
cars now they're fiber fiberglass and

1077
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,400
plastic so they're not metal anymore I

1078
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,280
mean they're metal inside the frame and

1079
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,839
the parts but the outside of the cars

1080
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,400
are just basically plastic shells

1081
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,440
fiberglass shells but think about the

1082
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,839
metal rusting on a car becoming crusty

1083
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,319
and bubbling

1084
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:29,000
up if you're old enough to know that

1085
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:33,040
this is essentially what happens in the

1086
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,240
brain but on a microscopic or nanoscopic

1087
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,200
scale and even smaller than that one

1088
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,920
major cause of oxidative reaction is a

1089
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,920
high level fat in the bloodstream so we

1090
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,839
pound down the fats and we get ourselves

1091
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,560
in

1092
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:50,280
trouble sure though if you're on a

1093
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:53,480
really bad diet and you're eating fried

1094
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,640
greasy food with you know rolls with

1095

gluten and you're eating lots of dairy

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,400
that's been you know melted cheese on

1098
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,240
everything and fried in the oven and I

1099
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,680
mean fried on the stove and baked in the

1100
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,400
oven or whatever all these different

1101
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,280
delicious dishes at all these different

fast food restaurants or whatever and

1103
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,560
all this all this fair and you're eating

1104
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,000
all that all this time and you switch

1105
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,920
off of that and you're just eating

1106
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,800
almond butters in your your in your

1107
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,079
shakes almond butter and your shakes and

1108
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,760
you're doing coconut oil and you're

1109
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,640
doing Lots of avocado and you're doing

1110
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,520
Freer range chicken and you're doing you

1111
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,040
know some n different seeds and Seed

1112
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,240
oils and you're doing all these things

1113
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,559
and you're you know your your chia seeds

1114
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,319
and you're doing the hemp seeds you're

1115
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:43,920
doing all of this hemp milk almond milk

1116
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,599
and you're just totally in the high-fat

1117
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,480
diet you got rid of the processed foods

1118
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,359
you got rid of the breads you got rid of

1119
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,559
all of that it's a huge step and that's

1120
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:55,079
where the world's going where it's going

1121
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,839
all there all the diets are going to

1122
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,520
lead everybody that there and we're

1123
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,440
still going to be S we're still going to

1124
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,280
be sick and

1125
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,040
then basically the diet makers to these

1126
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,160
diets are going to be like well you're

1127
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,400
just you know that's just you something

1128
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,839
something else you're doing you're just

1129
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,720
doing something wrong if this diet

1130
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,920
didn't cure you no it's not at all you

1131
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,079
can only go so far when you remove the

1132
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,640
processed foods because you're still

1133
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,559
doing the high fats you're just doing

1134
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,319
them in a healthier way and it may not

1135
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:26,280
be enough for so many people who have

1136
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:29,880
real real issues the Epstein bar and the

1137
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,800
shingles tal neuralgia pler fasciitis

1138
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,319
fibromyalgia you know all the problems

1139
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,480
we get and the reproductive problems

1140
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,920
women get PCOS and fibroids and all that

1141
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,960
that doesn't go away with that we got to

1142
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,839
lower the fats and then the metals don't

1143
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,839
oxidize too I don't care I mean if your

1144
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,920
diet's filled with high quality oils

1145
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,000
nuts and seeds and avocados and and high

1146
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,480
quality age cheese and and and organic

1147
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,520
eggs and chicken and really good fish

1148
00:43:53,480 --> 00:44:00,960
and and and grass-fed beef it's all fat

1149
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,160
all that was fat right there under the G

1150
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,000
or the hidden hidden name of protein all

1151
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,280
under the hidden name of protein all

1152
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,599
somebody's going to think is there is

1153
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,760
protein except for the word oils but

1154
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:11,160
they're just going to think protein with

1155
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,760
every word I just

1156
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,359
said sure there's no hydrogenated oils

1157
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,720
and cakes and cookies anymore in so of

1158
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,760
these people's diets and donuts and

1159
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,400
other fried foods of course there isn't

1160
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,920
and both the vegan side and both the

1161
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,760
animal pro protein side anymore the

1162
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,920
resulting fat though in the bloodstream

1163
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,400
leads to this oxidative reaction with

1164
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,760
the heavy metals in the brain that means

1165
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,640
all these other fats I'm talking about

1166
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,200
the healthy Ones Still oxidize Metals

1167
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,760
whether anybody likes it or not it's

1168
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,359
just the way it

1169
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:45,319
is and all these fats thicken up the

1170
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:47,319
blood lower the oxygen levels in the

1171
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:49,359
blood and get you in trouble with

1172
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:51,000
pathogens like Epstein bar and some of

1173
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,400
these some of these fats feed Epstein

1174
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,760
bar like the cheese and the eggs

1175
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,680
especially the cheese and the eggs they

1176
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,200
just feed the Epstein bar

1177
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,000
keep you sick it's why so many people

1178
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,480
have been just Ring Around the Rosie in

1179
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,200
musical

1180
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,640
chairs I'm not trying to cause all the

1181
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,960
fear around healthy fats a little is

1182
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,240
okay too much can cause problems for

1183
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,400
people that are really struggling look

1184
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,720
I've always been the

1185
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:21,640
person as the messenger as the person

1186
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,800
The Fighter for the chronically ill that

1187
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,079
have tried

1188
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,599
everything and have been there for them

1189
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:28,240
watching their back

1190
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,200
or to make sure people don't get sick

1191
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,760
and get

1192
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,119
worse you know who've never been sick

1193
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,839
before and end up getting sick and

1194
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:37,359
getting worse because they don't know

1195
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,760
this Advanced

1196
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:42,720
information and they just fall they fall

1197
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,200
prey to just a Ring Around The Rosy all

1198
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,640
of all of the same old thing going on

1199
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,359
and no one's telling them we got to get

1200
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,319
the metals deep out of the tissue and

1201
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:54,079
how to do it the right way none of that

1202
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:58,079
I'm not trying to cause the fear around

1203
00:45:54,079 --> 00:46:01,280
it it's just basically your safety

1204
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,920
you're protective protecting you making

1205
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,920
sure I look out for you when these

1206
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,599
Metals rust they change shape and form

1207
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,359
they rupture they even grow they expand

1208
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,240
they run together that's how it works

1209
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:16,280
inside our brains celery juice has an

1210
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,319
electrolyte Source the best one on the

1211
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,559
planet nothing can surpass it it's

1212
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:23,760
helpful it repairs damaged cells it

1213
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:26,359
repairs damaged

1214
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,920
neurons for one thing celery jues

1215
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:31,079
complex blend of trace minerals for one

1216
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,079
thing I'll tell you right now those

1217
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:35,280
trace minerals are powerful they help

1218
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,880
restore neurotransmitter chemicals this

1219
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,640
is critical

1220
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,359
information the blend offers complete

1221
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,079
neurotransmitter chemicals that's the

1222
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,280
blend in celery juice the blend of

1223
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,720
electrolytes it's critical because it

1224
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,400
helps to stop rusting metals from

1225
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,240
oxidizing and running off that's how

1226
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,079
incredible it

1227
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,760
is

1228
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,960
neurotransmitters it cleans them gets

1229
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,480
them less dirty makes them more useful

1230
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,440
rehydrates them because of electrolyte

1231
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,599
power and celery juice for another

1232
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,599
celery for another thing celery juice

1233
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:13,559
does it stops the oxidative

1234
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:16,240
runoff it protects the neurons from the

1235
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:18,280
runoff the gleo cells in the brain all

1236
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,440
this is critical I talk about this in

1237
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,040
the celery juice book way more I cover

1238
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,280
way more in the C juice book than I can

1239
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,720
cover in a radio show like this

1240
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,680
and the thing is you want to get these

1241
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,520
Metals out that's why I've always

1242
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,760
offered the heavy metal detox smoothie

1243
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,160
which has always helped people I like

1244
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,200
offering the celery juice as one of the

1245
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,079
medical medium tools and then the heavy

1246
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,640
metal detox smoothie the medical medium

1247
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,640
heavy metal detox smoothie and that

1248
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,480
Smoothie has the vimergy products in it

1249
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,200
um I'm not sponsored by those guys

1250
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,800
nothing of the sort this isn't an

1251
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,040
infomercial I want you to know that

1252
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,920
because that's what happens is every

single podcast I've ever just heard or

1254
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,040
someone has talked to me about they said

1255
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,960
there's like INF infomercials in

1256
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,400
everybody's podcast now they're like

1257
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,720
nothing but like radio shows of

1258
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:07,000
infomercials left and right like

1259
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,240
continuously all through the podcasts

1260
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,880
it's unbelievable and this person said

1261
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,079
to me you don't do that and I know I

1262
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,680
know I've heard that out there I've

1263
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,000
heard that myself I've listened to some

1264
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,800
podcast I've heard

1265
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,400
that now vimergy products are amazing

1266
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,160
because I that's what I do to get my

1267
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,480
medals out is I put their spin their

1268
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,280
their their um I put their spirulina in

1269
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,760
there their barley grass juice powder

1270
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,240

1380
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,920
thousands of people and even more than

1381
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,480
that over through the last three and a

1382
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,440
half decades information that's Advanced

1383
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,160
and ahead of science and research and

1384
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,000
ahead of the best alternative science we

1385
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:21,160

it and uh and hope that you actually try

1389
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,760
it because so many people have we got to

1390
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,079
get the metals out the Mercury aluminum

1391
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,760
the lead we got to get it out of our

1392
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,040
brains got to get it out of our liver

1393
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,160
got to get it out of our organs our

1394
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,359
intestinal tract our colon got to get it

1395
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:43,160
out of our reproductive system so we

1396
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:45,240
don't have difficulties with

1397
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,559
pregnancies we got to get it out of the

1398
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:50,599
breast milk so you're not breastfeeding

1399
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:51,960
your baby with all the toxic heavy

1400
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,200
metals in

1401
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,839
there that's why the heavy metal detox

1402
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,880
movie is amazing for for women who are

1403
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:00,720
breastfeeding they get the metals out

1404
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,960
and the celery juice is incredible for

1405
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,960
women it's for for breastfeeding because

1406
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,720
you're cleaning the breast milk you're

1407
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,680
cleaning it so the baby's getting clean

1408
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,240
breast

1409
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,559
milk I mean it that's doesn't get any

1410
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,839
better than

1411
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:17,440
