1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,620
foreign

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,639
we're talking about how to protect your

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,620
brain

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,139
which I think is a very important thing

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,059
when you think about it because we live

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,220
in a world where

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,619
no one really cares about protecting

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,380
people's brains well you know we don't

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,720
want to get hit in the head

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,060
so there's always that right

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,320
football players wear helmets

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,980
right

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,920
boxers wear gloves even though you could

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,660
mess up somebody really bad the boxing

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,640
arena either way

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,100
the point is is protecting your brain

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,860
it's more than that it's more than just

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,040
our head getting clobbered on a ski

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,180
slope because of an accident or anything

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,980
else

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm talking about protecting our brain

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,579
in so many other ways

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,780

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,160

up for this light blast event

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,700
now an important question because people

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,740
are asking that how much is it going to

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,899
cost how much is it going to cost it's

50
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,000
free it's free

51
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,740
the question is how much is it going to

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,420
cost for me

53
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,399
and that's the question

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,380
I have a team of people working I have

55
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,160
to pay them it's costing thousands of

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,259
dollars

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,959
I have to get the whole system set up

58
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:16,140
for it it's a major Endeavor it's a

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,020
major project it's going to cost me a

60
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,980
lot of money I still don't even know

61
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,440
that's how much it costs it's free

62
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,940
for everybody else that that's attending

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,580
this light blast

64
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,020
so I want to make that clear

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,580
um it's going to cost me tens of

66
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,040
thousands actually

67
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,680
so but the thing is it's just like all

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,480
medical meme information it's free get

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,760
the book of the library

70
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,980
it's like all medical the podcast it's

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,580
another thing it's free and that's what

72
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,080
we do it's a mission that I have in my

73
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,379
heart and soul

74
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,000
it's critical that I can do as much free

75
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,459
as possible

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,220
whatever I can in this lifetime

77
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,800
the light blast will not be tomorrow

78
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,120
I just want to make that clear the light

79
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,640
blast

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,860

81
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,140

82
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,640
so you have to be on the medical medium

83
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,040
newsletter you have to sign up for the

and I'm only going to allow 20 000

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,980
people because that's all our system can

89
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,440
actually hold that we're building and

90
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,140
doing right now the system that's

91
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,239
costing thousands of dollars for me to

92
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,959
get done so I can do this lifeblast for

93
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,099
free

94
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,739
now

95
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,599
I'm not trying to throw

96
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,879
like a guilt thing about it's costing me

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,239
a lot of money that's not it at all it's

98
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,060
because people are expecting to pay

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,239
and I want them to know they don't have

100
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,519
to pay it's free so I want them to know

101
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,040
that that's important but yeah it's not

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,739
free for me of course I mean that's just

103
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,080
the way it works but

104
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,640
anyway so there's all kinds of questions

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,040
coming through

106
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,200
what is the light blast so that's a

107
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,959
question a meditation

108
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,099
please let me know so if you've learned

109
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,879
okay

110
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:18,600
if you've been following medical medium

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,919
for years you'll know that during Live

112
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,320
Events

113
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,680
I would do a light blast

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,820
now the light isn't coming from me

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:33,600
on the messenger I'm guiding it I'm

116
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:36,540
helping the process the light comes from

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,460
Spirit of compassion so when we would do

118
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,560
lectures where there would be thousands

119
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,080
of people in the audience

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,500
we would actually Spirit of compassion

121
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,940
and I do a light Blast for everybody so

122
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,220
everybody's sitting down in the audience

123
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,960
or standing up in the audience would

124
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,940
receive this light

125
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,639
and it would hit the top of their head

126
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,100
and come down from above so if you have

127
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:04,620
a question about what is the light blast

128
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:07,440
now it is a it is a tool from above that

129
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,240
I have been taught to be a part of since

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,460
I was a child

131
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,740
going all the way back as a child

132
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,880
if I would come across a wounded

133
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,979
creature

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,660
like a turtle that got hit on the side

135
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,660
of the road

136
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,960
or an animal that was injured or a

137
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,419
grasshopper with a broken leg when I was

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,340
a child Spirit of compassion taught me

139
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,620
how to do this light blast

140
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,479
and that and the how Spirit of

141
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,600
compassion would send the light down on

142
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,360
the grasshopper on the injured turtle

143
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,720
I'm the injured creature and so forth

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,360
or on the person when I got a little

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,039
older and I was working on people

146
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
one-on-one

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,120
in my office

148
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,940
many many years ago

149
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,320
I would even I swear to compassion do

150
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,500
the light blast

151
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,840
on specific people in the office

152
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,419
for what was ailing them and and hurting

153
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,600
them emotionally mentally spiritually

154
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:09,600
and physically and so that late last

155
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,340
would happen in the office now

156
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,740
I would do it also at lectures

157
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,699
throughout the years too that was the

158
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,520
other thing

159
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:20,520
so and some of you guys might have been

160
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:25,560
around long enough to attend a lecture

161
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,840
that I've done in 2013 or 2014 or 2010

162
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,740
or whatever and you might have been

163
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,600
there to one of these events where

164
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,300
Spirit of compassion sent the light down

165
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,259
during that event on top of thousands of

166
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,060
people

167
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,880
and then people have these profound

168
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,919
experiences because of this light

169
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,120
so that's the light blast now but I just

170
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,919
wanted to because I'm seeing more and

171
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,620
more people come on right now

172
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,120
the only way to actually be a part of

173
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,620
this light blast

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,479
is you have to sign up to the medical

175
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,759
medium newsletter the link is in the

176
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,620
profile link is in the description so

177
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,180
sign up to the medical medium newsletter

178
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,460
I'm saying this because here's what's

179
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,580
going to happen and here

180
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,259
here's the sad part A whole bunch of

181
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,360
people are going to miss it and they're

182
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,259
not going to be there and it breaks my

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,900
heart

184
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,160
because this is not like this easy thing

185
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,500
to do

186
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,740
it's going to take a lot of energy out

187
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,539
of me I'm going going to go blind during

188
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,580

190
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,099

books right that's the uh I talk a

192
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:35,220
little bit about how things work

193
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,280
in the first book medical meaning right

196
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,199
part and this is not a public event

197
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,199
very important to know

198
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,919
it will not be broadcasted on my normal

199
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,099

like I'm here on YouTube

203
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,099
it's not going to be the normal

204
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,319
situation where it's that kind of thing

205
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,599
where you just kind of wall sign in and

206
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,340
anytime you want you see I'm live or

207
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,900

210
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,440
that at all it's not a public event it

211
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,479
will not be broadcasted on any of my

212
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:27,900
channels and there will not be a replay

213
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,800
this is going to be a live event in the

214
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,960
moment

215
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,300
Spirit of compassion is going to send

216
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,380
the light down on everybody who has

217
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,599
signed up

218
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,200
so this is important to know

219
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:43,380

medical meme newsletter so you don't

230
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,100

live event and I may not do another one

232
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,540
I really don't know

233
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,580
I do know because because one of the

234
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,160
reasons why it's so costly because I

235
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,060
don't want to charge I don't want to

236
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,160
charge

237
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,779
and I know that there's a lot of people

238
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,459
in the spiritual movement there's a lot

239
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,839
of people out there and authors and

240
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,880
things and people and they charge for

241
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,980
everything everything doesn't matter

242
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,600
what it is and they do groups of people

243
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,220
and they charge for this and that all

244
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,860
that stuff and I get it

245
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,959
but this we're talking about the

246
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:49,920
chronically ill and I have made a vowel

247
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:53,100
in this lifetime to offer as much free

248
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,019
healing tools as I possibly can in my

249
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,959
power

250
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:00,720
for the chronically ill

251
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,700
and that's what medical medium's mission

252
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,620
is so if you want to know like what's

253
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,959
behind the mission like what is really

254
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,200
behind it is it putting out incredible

255
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,080
books so people can heal that way is it

256
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,339

257
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,740

free information and free healing tools

the light blast is one of those healing

260
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,519
tools I don't want to charge for

261
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:26,040
and I don't know if it's going to be the

262
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,140
only one I do that um whatever next year

263
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,440

299
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,740

but I wanted to make sure you know this

302
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,620
now

303
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,220
medical medium podcast

304
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,519
uh there's a new episode I released it's

305
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,560
this it's about swelling right

306
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,820
lymphedema all of it and it's an

307
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,500
important episode it's really

308
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,120
enlightening a lot of powerful

309
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,459
information in there you'll be mind

310
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,320
blown when you hear it and since we're

311
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,019
talking about a couple things keep in

312
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,899
mind that my podcast

313
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,660
has no commercials or advertisers and

314
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,459
advertisements keep that in mind

315
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,740
so

316
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:25,200
it's I can actually make millions of

317
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,959
dollars in advertising on the medical

318
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,640
medium podcast at Apple podcast

319
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,220
I'm just letting you know

320
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,519
I refuse to do that

321
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,500
I don't wanna do that I want The Chronic

322
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,700
allele to have an experience when to

323
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,200
listen to the medical meeting podcast

324
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,880
free

325
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,560
of commercials and advertisers and

326
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,779
everything else

327
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,920
do you guys see the mission now do you

328
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,720
see the mission

329
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,399
that's been the mission

330
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,920
that's what it's about

331
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,040
and very important to know

332
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,019
I think Dr nesbitt's page is actually Dr

333
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,480
nesbit's thing is frozen there so we'll

334
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,820
take a look at that but anyway

335
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,320
so let's let's talk about um the medical

336
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,500
meme podcast for a couple of seconds

337
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,480
more it's a swelling episode which is

338
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,720
really important it's body swelling

339
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,240
fluid retention edema lymphedema tissue

340
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,540
expansion so what you'll hear on that

341
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,540
episode

342
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,620
is it's not just about when we get

343
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:26,639
bloated

344
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,720
it's not just about when we have weight

345
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,519
gain

346
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,820
and there's a lot of confusion with that

347
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,160
we're talking about tissue expansion

348
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,839
that's medical medium information just

349
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,519
so you know so it's not like oh I can

350
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,160
hear about swelling or bloating

351
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,560
somewhere else or let me go look online

352
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,660
and find something about oh 10 ways to

353
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,220
de-swell or whatever that's not what

354
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,320
we're talking about first of all medical

355
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,180
meme information does all that

356
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,620
so you can actually get rid of a lot of

357
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,600
people heal their bloating they heal

358
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,760
their sibo they heal all their different

359
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,260
problems they heal their HCL problems

360
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,600
and all that

361
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,820
but what this episode is and it's a

362
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,860
mind-blowing episode information from

363
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,420
Spirit to compassion of course it's all

364
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,320
original unique info is in that episode

365
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,240
that you're going to hear a medical meme

366
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
podcast at Apple podcast

367
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,800
is that

368
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,680
it's about tissue expansion

369
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,300
I talk about how everything enlarges in

370
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,399
us as we get older

371
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,220
we enlarge

372
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,720
we're not supposed to enlarge and then

373
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,339
people will pass that off as being

374
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,339
overweight now you can have weight

375
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:35,220
issues and be overweight and have tissue

376
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,880
expansion so you can still have tissue

377
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:42,300
expansion and be overweight

378
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,339
but what the health professionals do not

379
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,540
know and doctors and other health

380
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,740
professionals out there all kind

381
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,600
alternative health professionals

382
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,720
everybody what they don't know

383
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,779
is that there's an actual deep rooted

384
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,540
tissue expansion

385
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:59,160
and that's happening inside our body and

386
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,899
it's not doesn't even have to be linked

387
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,300
to inflammation you might be like oh

388
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,399
that's inflammation no it doesn't

389
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:09,000
doesn't actually equate to inflammation

390
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,920
it's real physical tissue expansion

391
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,079
occurring

392
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,820
and so when you listen to the medical

393
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,959
meme podcast

394
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,820
okay talking about lymphedema edema

395
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,019
tissue expansion all of it when you

396
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,060
listen to that

397
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,279
you're going to hear information that

398
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,579
nobody knows and it's mind-blowing it's

399
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,320
important to know this is why people

400
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:34,019
get bigger

401
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,180
even if they're not even overweight they

402
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,339
get bigger everything gets bigger

403
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,980
Everything grows on them as they get

404
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,600
older this is critical information that

405
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,220
is new and original from Spirit of

406
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,920
compassion about how the lymphatic

407
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,839
system and fluid actually works inside

408
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,680
the body and that's mind-blowing too so

409
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,480
what you're going to hear about

410
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,699
lymphatic information you don't hear

411
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,079

412
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,699

about the lymphatic system information

421
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,779

medical name podcast at Apple Apple

440
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,320
podcast Sophie says should we prepare

441
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,720
for the light blast somehow

442
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,540
you don't have to prepare

443
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,699
I mean you can do look you can do a lot

444
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,620
it doesn't it's

445
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,319
the kind of thing where you don't of

446
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:17,280
course want to

447
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,600
be out of your head before it meaning in

448
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,000
a sense where you just rolled in off the

449
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,319
road you're

450
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,699
you know you just came from the store

451
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,020
you're putting away groceries while

452
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,760
you're trying to do the white while

453
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,860
you're trying to receive the light blast

454
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,480
you can do that if you want you can be

455
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,520
rolling right through the door putting

456
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,500
away groceries while it's happening and

457
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,960
you're listening you can do that what

458
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,179
I'm saying is preparing would be

459
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,240
probably just really basic stuff

460
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:44,640
it would be relaxing

461
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,400
sitting down and chilling

462
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,860
whatever getting your your lemon balm

463
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,320
getting your lemon balm out you know

464
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,059
like the lemon balm tea that I always do

465
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,440
now which is this way instead it's

466
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:58,919
taking the lemon balm and actually

467
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,140
putting it right in uh water like that

468
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,179
that's what I'm going to be doing you're

469
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,980

medicine that's your brain and body

634
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,539
betrayed you that's what everybody's

00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,539
let's just be honest and let's just face

637
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,460
it

638
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:26,460

okay our brains and bodies have not

697
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,240
betrayed us they've they've been

698
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,580
betrayed by industrial chemicals and

699
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,980
other contaminants in our everyday lives

700
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,260
that have only accelerated in

701
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,080
development in recent years so just in

702
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,640
recent years the air fresheners have

703
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,860
gotten deadly

704
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,140
people don't realize this if you're

705
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,760
somebody who really is sensitive that

706
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,159
you have been sick already and

707
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,200
struggling and you're breathing in the

708
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,820
air fresheners that have been created by

709
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,880
the chemical Labs that are happening

710
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:09,179
today I can't even tell you how bad that

711
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,539
stuff is it is horrendous on our nervous

712
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,960
system on our central nervous system

713
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:16,980
it is

714
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,240
horrifying on our central nervous system

715
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,860
very important to know the air

716
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,279
fresheners and then they're making

717
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:26,100
detergents now that last extra long

718
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,980
oh you don't have to worry our detergent

719
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:32,220
even gets stronger when you touch your

720
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,640
garment when you touch your shirt then

721
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,940
you get a smell it all over again these

722
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,880
chemical concoctions are unreal and

723
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,400
we're under assault right now from these

724
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,159
chemical concoctions

725
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,480
the detergents the air fresheners the

726
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,919
scented candles you know what happened

727
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,440
with the whole thing

728
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,120
right a couple years ago scented candles

729
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,179
have always been out there poisoning

730
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,480
people but what I noticed is they

731
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:03,299
exploded on Instagram they exploded on

732
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,640
social media platforms scented candles

733
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,020
Galore exploded everybody was just

734
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,000
burning them because they were all felt

735
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,400
like they were stuck at home

736
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,659
right in the last couple years and

737
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,860
they're burning their scented candles

738
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,200
and what they're doing is they're

739
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,100
burning out their brain they don't know

740
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,980
it

741
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,659
they don't know it but they are

742
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,179
literally burning their scented candles

743
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,320
and taking years off their life for down

744
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:29,039
the road

745
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,419
years of quality living off their life

746
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,360
and they're burning all their scented

747
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:35,700
candles so our brains are under this

748
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,659
attack this assault

749
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:42,360
it's not our brains and bodies that have

750
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:44,460
betrayed us it is the industrial

751
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,400
chemicals and other contaminants in our

752
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,500
everyday lives that have only

753
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,120
accelerated the problem in the recent

754
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,100
years

755
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,960
what we're going to explore in this

756
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,820
chapter ahead in these chapters ahead

757
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,640
are the brain betrayers we're up against

758
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:03,600
every day the ones that challenge and

759
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,000
defy our immune systems like killing our

760
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,980
immune systems the one thing isn't oh

761
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,080
low immune system oh you need immune

762
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,460
system support oh immune system immune

763
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,820
system how about

764
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:18,480
we're killing our immune cells they die

765
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,460
they explode they die they can't handle

766
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,340
the load and that's what's happening too

767
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,380
is people are under siege their immune

768
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,539
systems are their white blood cells are

769
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,880
dying their lymphocytes are dying their

770
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:32,399
monocytes their neutrophones they're all

771
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,679
of it is dying in people and then the

772
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,480
bone marrow can't produce it enough and

773
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,860
then when you're sick what do you do you

774
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,419
go to the doctor and you get more blood

775
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,399
drawn and you weaken your immune system

776
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,159
more this is Advanced information only

medical medium lives but on the menu

784
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:00,179
today is brain saver we have brain saver

785
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,480
and brain saver protocols they're very

786
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:06,299
delicious I hope you enjoy them

787
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,039

will be

789
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,580
and you guys there's a lot of

790
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,440
information in here it's too much it's

791
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,299
incredible too much it's just absorbing

792
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,740
one day you can be reading these books

793
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:19,679
for years

794
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,980
Sophie said I just spent two weeks

795
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,960
with my dad he's a nutritionist and he

796
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,720
thinks that weight gain is only due to

797
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,279
excess calories and lack of exercise he

798
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,980
thinks I eat too much

799
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,860
that is a common mistake

800
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,360
made by so many people nutritionists and

801
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,640
RDS

802
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,100
right that registered dietitians I love

803
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,380
when registered dietitians say uh you

804
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,720
shouldn't drink celery juice celery

805
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,539
juice is not good for you offers nothing

806
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,279
because science never whatever science

807
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:53,100
doesn't know I mean science hasn't done

808
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,799
a study on celery juice yet so how is in

809
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,480
a registered dietitian even able to say

810
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:00,179
anything about celery juice when science

811
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,220
has even done a study that's a whole

812
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,840
other story but it's really a joke when

813
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,100
you think about all of it

814
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,899
all right

815
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,940
let's go into it

816
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:10,500
the ones that take up residence in our

817
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,059
brain tissue the ones that contaminate

818
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,500
our neurons and neurotransmitters so

819
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,940
we're talking about is brain betrayers

820
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,580
the ones that destroy our immune system

821
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,320
and blow it up and kill it

822
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,899
the brain betrayers that get into our

823
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,279
neurons and absolutely short-circuit and

824
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:24,600
Destroy neurons that actually kill

825
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,520
neurons

826
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,179
rainbow traders that get into our

827
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:32,840
central nervous system as well just

828
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,840
incredible information

829
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,799
if he says after two weeks of taking the

830
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,620
brain shots for nerve shifter and Trauma

831
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:42,899
shock loss stabilizer incredible I am

832
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,840
proud to finally be free of my addiction

833
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:47,220
to psychedelics like mushrooms in

834
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,880
ayahuasca

835
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:53,880
thank you mm

836
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:58,200
that made my day to be free from the

837
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:02,100
chains of drugs

838
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,620
to be not a slave to drugs

839
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:07,700
oh my God and don't be telling me

840
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,700
ayahuas is not a drug

841
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:12,840
I'm not judging anybody for being on it

842
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,059
I'm just saying it actually is the point

843
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,240
is is you're free from it

844
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:21,299
that is worth every Blood Sweat and

845
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,880
Tears that went into these books getting

846
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:26,100
information from SOC making sure you

847
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,039
have those brain shot therapies so you

848
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:32,580
can be free of Ayahuasca I have heard

849
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,799
stories from moms and dads about their

850
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,080
teenagers getting their brains blown out

851
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,940
from Ayahuasca and some psychedelic

852
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,279
mushrooms where the kids just sit in

853
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,200
their rooms and they're so depressed

854
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,600
they can't even formulate words because

855
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,520
of an ayahuasca ceremony done by us you

856
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,380
know whatever by a really carefully done

857
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,140
by carefully by a shaman or something

858
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,580
the point is and no no offense on

859
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,520
anything I'm not saying Shaman's this

860
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:59,779
whatever I'm just saying that I have

861
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:03,360
seen over and over again moms and dads

862
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:05,760
complaining over Ayahuasca damage on

863
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,919
their 16 year old 17 year olds 18 year

864
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,059
olds you name it and no one talks about

865
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,080
it

866
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:15,059
all I know is that's amazing

867
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,679

if you want to make a judgment call on

871
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,500

that's all good please read brain saver

876
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,519
read the micro dose chapter it will blow

877
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,779

889
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,720
don't miss out

890
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,540
these brain betrayers can also defy our

891
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,580
brains from afar as in the case with

892
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,260
viruses that take up Residence at cider

893
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,179
liver so what that means is a virus can

894
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,520
take inside residents inside your liver

895
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,280
release their neurotoxin the neurotoxin

896
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,379
go whoop up to your brain and get to

897
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,540
there and then we got brain fog and then

898
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:32,460
we don't feel good and then we don't you

899
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,139
know and then including balance issues

900
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,700
we feel like we're on a boat we feel

901
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,500
like we're rocking we feel like we got

902
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,780
the vertigo we feel like all of that

903
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,580
because those neurotoxins are shooting

904
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,919
out of the liver and getting to our

905
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,800
central nervous system our vagus nerves

906
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,119
and making us dizzy and feeling

907
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,980
imbalanced and all that brain betrayers

908
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,839
cause all this

909
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,940
you can't get that information anywhere

910
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:58,339
by the way like every second it's like

911
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,339
boom like boom boom boom

912
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,440
we're talking about the brain betrayers

913
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,240
that whether from near or far scatter

914
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,820
our brains

915
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,260
you know anybody that's scatterbrained

916
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:13,560
fog our brains do you know anybody with

917
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,359
brain fog they got a foggy brain inflame

918
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,280
our brains

919
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,720
how many people go into the doctor's

920
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,040
office neurologist's office and

921
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,380
everything and the doctor doesn't even

922
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,060
know their brains are inflamed they have

923
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,640
no idea there's inflammation of the

924
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,400
brain it's so mild it's so discreet but

925
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,560
it's there

926
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,240
undermine our brains yes these brain

927
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,720
betrayers these toxic chemicals and

928
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:39,480
everything else can undermine your brain

929
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,579
disrupt your brain fatigue our brains

930
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,980
any fatigue going on neurological

931
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:45,420
fatigue that's a medical medium phrase

932
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,099
that's a medical medium understanding

933
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,740
and a medical medium

934
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:52,800
um definition is neurological fatigue

935
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,960
see before that definition doctors of

936
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,540
all kinds both alternative conventional

937
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,420
signs of research did not know that

938
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,820
fatigue was actually neurological they

939
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,339
thought you were tired and they thought

940
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:10,200
you were faking it in the 1950s and 60s

941
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:12,599
and 70s and 80s and 90s and 2000s I hear

942
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,700
it today people are told women are told

943
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,500
that they're faking their fatigue

944
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,119
because they can't see anything on an

945
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,140
MRI

946
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,240
but there's something called

947
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,440
neurological fatigue meaning it's an mm

948
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,300
term

949
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,000
pollute our brains yeah we pollute our

950
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,099
brains scramble our brains I know a lot

951
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,079
of people they're like scrambled eggs in

952
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,640
the brain it's like all scrambled in

953
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,560
there everything's scrambled the

954
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,300
information that comes out information

955
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,540
that goes in

956
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,800
distract our brains burn out our brains

957
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,720

heat up our brains Rob our brains scar

960
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,060
our brains did you know you could have

961
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,099
scar tissue in the brain developing from

962
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,920
injuries from brain betrayers that no

963
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:57,240
one understands real physical injuries

964
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,920
inside the brain that science and

965
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,680
research has no idea about

966
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,540

make you fear life here on planet Earth

1019
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,940
we can't avoid everything that isn't

1020
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,980
great for our brains and our life we

1021
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,200
have to live in this world I understand

1022
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,119
that we do have to live in this world

1023
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,820
there's no question

1024
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,579
these chapters also aren't here so you

1025
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:26,400
can accept everything listed and move on

1026
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:30,839
with life ignoring these brain

1027
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:34,020
portrayers as if they don't exist

1028
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:36,000
we can make life in this world better by

1029
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,440
learning to stay away from even a

1030
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,579
handful of these brain portrayers in

1031
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,099
here so what I'm saying is you don't

1032
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:42,060
have to change your whole life in one

1033
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,220
minute

1034
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,260
but you can be aware of some of these

1035
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,740
and the differences that can happen is

1036
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,740
powerful

1037
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,900
all right

1038
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,420
Heidi Floyd The Heavy Metal detox

1039
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,720
changed my life no one ever talks about

1040
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,700
that except for you brought in celery

1041
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,619
juice supplements no more chronic

1042
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,160
sinusitis keep on doing what you're

1043
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,660
doing so Heidi chronic sinusitis so my

1044
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,880
guess

1045
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,040
would be or my estimate would even be

1046
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,140
you went to a lot of doctors

1047
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,839
you went to a lot of ears nose and

1048
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,400
throats doctors right you went to a lot

1049
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,079
of different practitioners and probably

1050
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,300
Healers

1051
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,460
and somewhere along the way you found

1052
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,619
medical medium

1053
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,520
whether it was an angel that led you

1054
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:37,560
there

1055
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:41,579
or a spiritual Source or a magical force

1056
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:44,940
or anything right or God

1057
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:46,980
or the or Heaven above whatever it is

1058
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,839
something LED you to the medical medium

1059
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,900
information

1060
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,640
and it could have been that person

1061
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,380
that was at the store when you were

1062
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,119
getting stuff you needed it could have

1063
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,619
been anything but you found the

1064
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,140
information and now your chronic side

1065
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:03,359
you say this is gone and you learned how

1066
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,740
to use the heavy metal detox

1067
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,839
you learned how to use these

1068
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:10,880
life-changing life-saving tools I just

1069
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,880
want to say just I'm proud of you

1070
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,200
every little bit counts when it comes to

1071
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,579
avoiding or decreasing the saturation of

1072
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,980
your brain with these contaminants you

1073
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:24,180
guys every little bit counts

1074
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:26,760
every little bit you can get counts

1075
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:29,760
mm info is about customizing so you can

1076
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,560
go further and further and further with

1077
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,180
your healing process and learn that

1078
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,920
every little bit does count and ready

1079
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:39,540
and learn that all the details matter

1080
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,640
every little bit counts when it comes to

1081
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,740
avoiding or decreasing the saturation of

1082
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,079
your brain with these contaminants you

1083
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,599
may be able to easily avoid the ones you

1084
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,359
never realized until now

1085
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,280
were the most detrimental

1086
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,440
you may be able to say I'm not gonna

1087
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,960
like the scented candle anymore because

1088
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,000
it's doing some bad stuff I can go into

1089
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,640
detail sometime I got a podcast episode

1090
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,140
about it but you can like get rid of

1091
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,480
things in your life that are the most

1092
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,180
obvious and the most important in the

1093
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,400
moment there's so many

1094
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,260
or you may be someone that looks at the

1095
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,040
category of brain betrayers which is in

1096
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:18,780
this book Brain betrayers means bad crap

1097
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,599
I'm just just straight out let's just

1098
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:24,420
put it in a nutshell brain betrayers

1099
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,240
means your freaking brain was betrayed

1100
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,640
by bad crap created by the industries

1101
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,119
and I'm reading about that in this book

1102
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,119
right now

1103
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,579
for example the domestic Invasion brain

1104
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,920
betrayers is a category called domestic

1105
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:42,320
invasion

1106
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,060
foreign

1107
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,619
ways to replace or cut them out what's a

1108
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,480
domestic invader

1109
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,660
let me give you a little window into it

1110
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,180
it's that plug-in air freshener that

1111
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:57,000
you've got to unplug out of the wall

1112
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,960
and you gotta throw out

1113
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,960
Gotta Throw It Out

1114
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,960
sometimes we can't stop ourselves from

1115
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,000
being exposed to brain betrayers it's

1116
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,060
true we can't stop it

1117
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,040
but we can sure clean some of it up and

1118
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,040
then do some healing around it

1119
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:19,020
viruses especially we can still take

1120
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,060
steps to lessen exposure and kill off

1121
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:24,720
those viruses with medical medium

1122
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:26,819
information to get better

1123
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,619
when we do get exposed we can do plenty

1124
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:31,740
About It by strengthening our immune

1125
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:34,560
system removing viral fuel from our body

1126
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,940
and staying hydrated

1127
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,119

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:43,579

establishment

1138
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,520

happens is

1205
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,819
gotta understand something that in the

1206
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,339
Colts out there they make everybody pay

1207
00:46:56,819 --> 00:47:02,700

is

1213
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,240
I know

1214
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:21,119
because I know the people out there

1215
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,760
I know of them they don't like medical

1216
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,040
medium information

1217
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,200
they want everybody to pay pay for

1218
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,460
everything doesn't matter what it is and

1219
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,740
they try to learn in they make you pay

1220
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,599
pay of course is subscriptions

1221
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,220
description more subscription fees more

1222
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,560
of this more that you just pay you pay

1223
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:40,859
you pay that's how it is and that's how

1224
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,720
they that's how they feel about their

1225
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:45,480
people not everybody but that's how they

1226
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,220
feel about their people

1227
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,079
they're just like no way you're not

1228
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:52,319
escaping that

1229
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,940
no way sucker you're not escaping that

1230
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,400
no way

1231
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,920
that's how they do it

1232
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,560
meanwhile they're not consistent either

1233
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,000
they change they morph they shape-shift

1234
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,980
into something else and then they're

1235
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,960
shape-shifting to something else they're

1236
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,520
all anti-fruit now they let you eat a

1237
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,440
little fruit they were all this now they

1238
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,819
let you do that in other words all

1239
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,380
changing because they're making mistakes

1240
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:15,900
and they're trying to learn along the

1241
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,240
way on your dime and they're trying to

1242
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,280
learn all the way they're along the way

1243
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,740
on your pain and your suffering

1244
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,300
nothing's consistent medical medium

1245
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,819
information was consistent from the

1246
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:29,099
start all the way back it was still

1247
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:31,500
consistent it doesn't contradict itself

1248
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:33,000
and it stays like that they change their

1249
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,560
writings they change their books they

1250
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,540
change their courses they change their

1251
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,400
Direction two years later they change

1252
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,140
something else they say oh it's this now

1253
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,300
that's causing a problem or it's this

1254
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:44,280
and it keeps on going and that's how

1255
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,140
it's done out there and that's the Cults

1256
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,140
that's what it is right there

1257
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,480
and their attitude is exactly like that

1258
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,920
they can't we don't care suckers you pay

1259
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,900
we don't care you pay that's

1260
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,500
their attitude and that's what they do

1261
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:04,440
because I know and I know many of them

1262
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:07,020
out there and how it works

1263
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,780
what you will find is medical medium is

1264
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:13,619
consistent only grows

1265
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:16,500
with new information and it builds upon

1266
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:19,560
itself where it's just more unknown

1267
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:21,780
never before information more details in

1268
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:25,319
depth and it never could contradicts

1269
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:27,420
itself that's how it works but if and

1270
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:30,240
I'm under the microscope if they were

1271
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,339
under the microscope oh my God every

1272
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,079
book's different everything about it's

1273
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:36,119
different every belief system they take

1274
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,619
in is different every podcast they do is

1275
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,180
different and then when you look at it

1276
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:40,859
all

1277
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,240
it's all the same thing everybody's

1278
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:44,040
doing out there because it's one big

1279
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,680
coal and here's how you know it is when

1280
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,500
you get too sick

1281
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,579
game over because they don't have the

1282
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,400
answers

1283
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:56,780
you get too sick game over

1284
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,780
that's how it works out there

1285
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:03,000
so

1286
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,619
the thing about mm is just like when I

1287
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,300
just read in this one little paragraph

1288
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,200
there's so many paragraphs in here to

1289
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,240
read

1290
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,960
rather than being here to scare you the

1291
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,160
chapters ahead are your protective guide

1292
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,380
why are we trying to protect everybody

1293
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,460
why aren't we trying to just protect

1294
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,500
them

1295
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,240
and give them the answers they need in

1296
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,040
Direction like really protect them oh

1297
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,660
that's right they don't know what to do

1298
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,099
to protect people

1299
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,619
because they don't have the information

1300
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:31,740
from above so I have to give them that

1301
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:33,839
credit they don't know

1302
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,940
it's a guide to a better life with

1303
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:38,160
little with a little knowledge about

1304
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:41,220
what we're exposed to on it on an

1305
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,800
occasion or constant basis and the role

1306
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:46,319
that plays in harming us even if it's a

1307
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,359
simple thing as aspartame triggering a

1308
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:50,700
migraine we're so much better equipped

1309
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:52,859
to live the lives we see for ourselves

1310
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:55,220
rather than get sidelined by symptoms or

1311
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:55,220
illness

1312
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,440
if this is your personal copy of the

1313
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:02,579

scented candles in your home and you can

1331
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,900
switch to a natural fragrance free

1332
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,880
laundry detergent then in a few months

1333
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,559

1334
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,119

science research didn't know viruses

1349
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:28,140
created waste matter

1371
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,859
the short list this all the information

1372
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,579
it's all in here right we could sit here

1373
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:22,680
for days days with this information

1374
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:25,559
viruses and viral waste matter like I

1375
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:27,420
mentioned Pharmaceuticals that's a brain

1376
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:28,800
betrayer right there now I get it I'm

1377
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,180
not anti-pharmaceutical for certain

1378
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,980
occasions and for certain things if

1379
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,359
doctor the doctor says this is what you

1380
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,740
need whatever listen to your doctors

1381
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:37,680
right

1382
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:39,780
but there's a lot of pharmaceutical that

1383
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,780
shouldn't be in a lot of people I talked

1384
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,920
about the stadium with 80 000 students

1385
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:46,460
watching college football game and

1386
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,140
cheering and the majority on

1387
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:52,040
antidepressants anti-anxiety meds and

1388
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,040
Adderall right

1389
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,780
Pam says let's see what that went up

1390
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:01,079
Amanda says after two years on your

1391
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,480
protocols my Eczema is fully gone

1392
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:06,180
incredible

1393
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,859
that's that's actually incredible and

1394
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,839
that matters if somebody knows with

1395
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:12,900
eczema and psoriasis with the suffering

1396
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:14,700
that occurs it's not just itching you

1397
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,680
know when I see like a commercial or

1398
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,619
advertisement somewhere on social media

1399
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,599
or something from Big Pharma right doing

1400
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:24,180
a commercial on somebody's eczema

1401
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,400
psoriasis it's like uh you don't even

1402
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,900
know what they're going through

1403
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,160
big Pharma doesn't even know what

1404
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,599
they're going through the kind of Agony

1405
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,160
we're talking about the pain they're

1406
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:34,859
acting like a little discomfort and they

1407
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:38,520
show this huge huge slosh right this

1408
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:40,140
whole spot of right psoriasis or eczema

1409
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,819
but they don't even know what the

1410
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,260
person's suffering but they have no idea

1411
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:45,839
what the person's actually really

1412
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:48,839
suffering with how bad it could be

1413
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:52,140
I learned from SOC but you know

1414
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:55,140
frankly and said I was gonna die

1415
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:57,000
medical medium saved my life no medical

1416
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,260
information can do

1417
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
that

1418
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,460
that they're big time Cults so you

1419
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,500

1420
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,460
incredible and and you got your life

1421
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,940

getting me some teary eyes right now

1423
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:14,460
Tara Appleman when people say medical

1424
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,800
medium info is fear-mongering I could

1425
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:19,140
only think that person doesn't know what

1426
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:22,400
it's like to Suffer Without answers and

1427
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,400
lose all control of your life

1428
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:34,140
foreign

1429
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:36,359
I need some lemon balm

1430
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:38,780
because it breaks my heart

1431
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:42,599
it just does

1432
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:45,599
tomka says you are the only one who

Toma on YouTube

1436
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:56,359
I'm gonna pop in a little bit more

1437
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,359
lemon balm into

1438
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,400
this right here Erica says everything

1439
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,380
that is not MediCal medium contradicts

1440
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,859
itself you see it all the time Erica

1441
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:12,900
it's unbelievable and then you wonder

1442
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:14,220
how like people don't notice it

1443
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,140
hmm

1444
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,040
it's just unbelievable by the way you

1445
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:20,040
guys

1446
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,260
you guys know I endorse uh emerging I

1447
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,420
won't go into it but

1448
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:27,480
these guys are just insane that's all

1449
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:31,339
the products are just insane I mean

1450
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,339
nothing like them exists on this planet

1451
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,280
so all right

1452
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:43,319
toxic heavy metals no one cared about

1453
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,859
toxic heavy metals they spent 35 years

1454
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:48,900
teaching about it nobody cared

1455
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:52,980
I practically got dragged out of a

1456
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,660
dental conference over 30 plus years ago

1457
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,880
because I was talking about how the

1458
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:59,640
Mercury fillings were bad and it was an

1459
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,040
alternative Dental con conference that

1460
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,900
actually still appreciated Mercury

1461
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:06,859
fillings

1462
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,859
unbelievable

1463
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,319
alternative

1464
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,319
holistic

1465
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,520
took a lot a lot of hardship throughout

1466
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,460
the years to to get that info out

1467
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,040
fragrances bacteria and other microbes

1468
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:25,140
yeah streptococcus is wild in people

1469
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,940
right now it's the new superbug I'm

1470
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:29,220
sorry but it is and it's in everybody

1471
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:31,140

it twenty thousand people are only

1533
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,040
allowed in

1534
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:05,460
it's costing me thousands of dollars

1535
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:10,160
to create and do so that and it's

1536
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:13,140

1537
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:16,079
internally because that light blast is

1538
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:18,000

01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,260

01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:28,500
so anyway don't miss the light blast

1543
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:30,839

01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,920
mind since you know I gotta let you know

1545
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:38,059
incredible swelling lymphedema

1546
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:40,799
tissue expansion episode

1547
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:42,839
Apple podcast please listen to that

1548
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:45,000
episode and what you'll find on there is

1549
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:46,619
no advertisers no commercials no

1550
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,380
advertisements

1551
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:51,420
it is the only podcast on that level

1552
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:53,819
meaning a number one podcast in health

1553
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:56,579
that has no advertisers

1554
01:00:53,819 --> 01:01:00,540
and advertisements and commercials

1555
01:00:56,579 --> 01:01:03,240
and I'm hated for it by the industries

1556
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:06,240
Margarita says I believe ew being in

1557
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:08,400
health field and health care provider I

1558
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:12,260
have realized it's all about the money

1559
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,640
yet aw guides Us for free

1560
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:16,319
so I want to talk about brain saturation

1561
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,180
for a couple minutes since we're in mm

1562
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,400
school for a few more minutes here

1563
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:22,500
any of these toxins and poisons I've

1564
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,960
mentioned in any amount can reach and

1565
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,640
saturate any aspect of the brain some

1566
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,619
more commonly ending up in certain

1567
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,700
places in the brain than others so all

1568
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:31,260
those different things I mentioned

1569
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,660
Pharmaceuticals everything else I

1570
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,520
mentioned right Chemtrails radiation EMF

1571
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:37,140
right all of it harmful foods supplement

1572
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:40,020
chemicals harmful supplements right

1573
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:42,299
chemical dust industry Invaders toxic

1574
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:44,760
heavy metals fragrances Pharmaceuticals

1575
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:46,680
right I mentioned that again all of that

1576
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,760
can go in different areas of the brain

1577
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,619
that I was just showing you here

1578
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,280
different aspects different areas I mean

1579
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:56,099
different locations is what I mean

1580
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,079
for example petrochemicals often end up

1581
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:01,440
in the cerebral cortex

1582
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:03,900
in outer layer of the brain although

1583
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,540
some petrochemicals can also end up

1584
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:09,359
deeper within the brain

1585
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:11,880
the amount of exposure has an influence

1586
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:14,099
if it's a fair amount of exposure at

1587
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,660
once or extended exposure meaning for

1588
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:17,880
more than just a few minutes you could

1589
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:19,799
get deeper saturation of petrochemicals

1590
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:22,260
or other brain betrayers entering the

1591
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:24,299
brain when exposure is small tiny

1592
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,240
occasionally here and there you may not

1593
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:29,160
reach or experience symptoms you may not

1594
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,319
react or experience symptoms if you are

1595
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,240
not sensitive can I read can I read

be exposed to fumes for a few minutes at

1654
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,359
a gasoline pump

1655
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:04,440
or they may have some gasoline spilled

1656
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:06,540
on their skin that they're also

1657
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,079
breathing in as fumes everybody has

1658
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:12,119
different exposures and that's why

1659
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:13,740
penetration of the brain varies smaller

1660
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:15,180
amounts built up over time larger

1661
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,740
amounts speed up the process and

1662
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:19,079
sensitivity I'm just reading a couple of

1663
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:21,660
different things when brain betrayers

1664
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:23,579
settle in the cerebral cortex they may

1665
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:25,680
not affect critical brain functions

1666
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:27,900
right away unless someone is already

1667
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:30,420
sensitive and living with brain betrayer

1668
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:32,940
complications such as a low-grade viral

1669
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:34,799
infection and symptoms in that case the

1670
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,079
smell of fresh paint you guys fresh

1671
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:38,579
paint the smell of fresh paint could set

1672
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:40,740
them back for days or weeks I've seen

1673
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:43,799
people paint like

1674
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:45,660
a friend of mine they're they're

1675
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:48,359
um college student son

1676
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:49,859
is repainting his dorm room

1677
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:51,960
and

1678
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:53,819
just you know sat in those fumes just

1679
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,020
repainting it real all that paint and

1680
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:57,119
everything right

1681
01:05:55,020 --> 01:06:00,420
and it was just for three weeks was like

1682
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:02,160
fatigued and basically bedridden

1683
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,680
because it's all it took to tip the

1684
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:09,380
scale for that for that um person it's

1685
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:09,380
all it took to you know to tip the scale

1686
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:15,000
on the other hand someone who isn't on

1687
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,319
the verge of that Tipping Point that I

1688
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,420
was just saying who hasn't been

1689
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,980
saturated with brain betrayer toxins

1690
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:21,960
isn't dealing with low-grade viral

1691
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:23,640
activity or doesn't have a diminished or

1692
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,380
challenged immune system won't

1693
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,000
necessarily see immediate effects from

1694
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:29,400
exposure so that's that person like I

1695
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,020
could do anything I want I can get any

1696
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,059
exposure I want it doesn't matter their

1697
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:34,680
scale hasn't been tipped yet you see how

1698
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:36,599
it works you guys this is MM school for

1699
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:39,079
a little bit their scale hasn't been

1700
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:39,079
tipped

1701
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:45,480
but don't don't take that the wrong way

1702
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:47,099
it eventually does get ticked if you

1703
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,500
don't do things about it like cleansing

1704
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:51,180
and doing the right stuff

1705
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,920
you know what's really disheartening is

1706
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:56,000
when someone

1707
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,000
gets really sick

1708
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,420
they've tried everything out there they

1709
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:03,480
tried the vegan diet

1710
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:05,460
they tried a raw food diet a vegan diet

1711
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,599
they tried an animal protein diet that's

1712
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,039
what they came from

1713
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:09,359
they tried different supplements they

1714
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:11,579
went to naturopaths they went to

1715
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:13,260
acupuncturists they went to registered

1716
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:15,359
dietitians they went to neurologists

1717
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,039
they went to whoever

1718
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,960
and then they find medical medium

1719
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,640
information

1720
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,140
and medical medium information is

1721
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,740
different

1722
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:28,380
it uses wild Foods

1723
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:30,539
and fruit and leafy greens differently

1724
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:32,819
it uses the combinations differently it

1725
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:36,059
uses supplements that are actually

1726
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:38,160
really good for the healing process in

1727
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:39,000
specific ways designed in certain ways

1728
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,920
right

1729
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,900
and then they find out how they were

1730
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,520
sick and why they were sick and then

1731
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:49,280
they found out that they can customize

1732
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,280
what they want to heal and then

1733
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:54,619
they want to pretend it wasn't medical

1734
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,619
medium after all

1735
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:59,220
they want to do their own thing

1736
01:07:57,299 --> 01:08:00,359
I get it they want a health coach or

1737
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,280
they want to do something they want to

1738
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:04,559
do their own thing

1739
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,599
and they pretend it wasn't medical media

1740
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,940
and they boil it down to it was just

1741
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:10,799
some fruits and vegetables

1742
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,720
that happens all the time

1743
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:15,119
it's funny when people

1744
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:17,279
you know it's it's it's really actually

1745
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:18,900
heartbreaking meanwhile

1746
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,540
they wouldn't have found that

1747
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:24,420
information understood did you know just

1748
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:26,400
knowing what caused your problem and

1749
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,380
your sickness to begin with is a huge

1750
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,839
massive part of your healing process to

1751
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,819
Discount that is insane

1752
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:34,859
to actually say

1753
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:37,020
oh yeah no it really wasn't medical

1754
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:39,600
medium he's just fruits and vegetables a

1755
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:42,359
vegan whatever I I found my own way of

1756
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,219
doing it with vegetables now and I don't

1757
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:45,239
even want to mention his name anymore I

1758
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:47,219
don't even want to mention medical

1759
01:08:45,239 --> 01:08:48,960
medium anymore I found my own

1760
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:50,219
supplements that I want to do in the way

1761
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,960
I wanted you and then I want to teach

1762
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:53,400
all that out there because it wasn't

1763
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,440
medical medium and I'm not going to say

1764
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:59,040
it's medical medium anymore

1765
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:02,100
it's it's actually insane to think

1766
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,660
that just finding out what was wrong

1767
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:06,839
with you

1768
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:09,839
is a huge part that's a huge part of how

1769
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:11,940
you even heal it gives you peace of mind

1770
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:13,620
like nothing else when you're out there

1771
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:15,179
and you're struggling and suffering and

1772
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,859
you tried everything and then you find

1773
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:19,319
medical medium and the first thing you

1774
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:21,000
learn is why you're sick healing starts

1775
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:23,940
to happen from that alone to actually

1776
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,620
discredit that is insane

1777
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:28,020
just because you want to do your own

1778
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,219
thing and do your own stuff and not be

1779
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,380
part of the medical medium Community

1780
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:33,540
anymore you want to be doing your own

1781
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:35,520
thing I get it I understand that but to

1782
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:37,500
then throw medical medium kind of like

1783
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,719
as if it's oh that would have happened I

1784
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,219
would have healed anyway even though I

1785
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:42,299
tried everything out there I would have

1786
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:44,160
healed anyway

1787
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:46,500
he's just fruits and vegetables and I

1788
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:48,120
would have figured it out anyway

1789
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,560
I get it you want to be somebody in

1790
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,880
health probably or you want to be

1791
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,620
somebody this or you want to be a life

1792
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,020
coach or whatever it is and you don't

1793
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:57,540
want to give claim to Medical medium

1794
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:01,199
information anymore

1795
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:03,660
and so whatever

1796
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:05,460
but healing happens by first knowing

1797
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:07,800
what's wrong with you that's how

1798
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,900
something occurs instantly if you've

1799
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:13,020
been out there bearing you know out

1800
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:14,880
there in the desert wanting to know why

1801
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:16,860
you're finally sick like wanting to know

1802
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,360
what's wrong and you finally get the

1803
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:21,179
answer that's part of the healing

1804
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:24,120
process you can't deny that as being

1805
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:25,739
something that helps you heal

1806
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:28,679
all right

1807
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:31,199
then it's also not just a vegan diet

1808
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:34,340
medical medium is not vegan

1809
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:36,840
it's not about vegan

1810
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:38,880
unbelievable the vegan doctors out there

1811
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,020
how they say oh medical medium's just

1812
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,380
vegan you know everybody knew that

1813
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:45,659
information medical medium is for animal

1814
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,820
protein people you can still keep your

1815
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:50,219
animal protein if you want it's for

1816
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,900
vegans who can't get better either who

1817
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:53,340
can that have been doing their vegan

1818
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:56,040
diet wrong

1819
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:58,560
then nobody had answers for it's for the

1820
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:01,199
vegetarians that do other stuff like

1821
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,360
fish it's for everybody it's medical

1822
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:06,900
medium information is the tool so you

1823
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,940
can heal and still do what you're doing

1824
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,219
and one of the parts of healing is

1825
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:12,600
knowing what the heck went wrong why are

1826
01:11:11,219 --> 01:11:14,460
you sick because let me tell you what

1827
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,620
that does for your soul and your brain

1828
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:19,440
and your peace of mind when you know

1829
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:21,840
what's wrong you instantly start to get

1830
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,600
peace and you instantly start to heal

1831
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,699
and start to sleep and start to know

1832
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,679
okay

1833
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:31,320
but the people out there get it they get

1834
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:33,239
greedy they want to take credit for

1835
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:36,000
medical medium information but their own

1836
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:37,739
credit I get it they want to cheat other

1837
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,320
people from finding the information

1838
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:41,940
anymore they don't want to like cite

1839
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,260
medical medium anymore they want to make

1840
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:46,560
it look like it's all been out there in

1841
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:49,199
the vegan movement all the info

1842
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,880
it's so sad

1843
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:53,280
Becky Lynn says they get this

1844
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,580
information and then they use it all to

1845
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:00,000
put out their their own version but

1846
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:03,199
don't want to anymore say medical medium

1847
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,199
they want to do their own version

1848
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:10,380
lupus free with celery33 says I get the

1849
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:13,260
comment he is not saying anything new

1850
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:15,480
the medical journals I cited about EBV

1851
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:18,120
now say it has been known for decades

1852
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:21,080
that EBV blah blah blah it hasn't been

1853
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,080
known for decades

1854
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:25,739
the true cause of Lupus was never

1855
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:28,199
Epstein-Barr in any medical form

1856
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:29,820
anywhere it was published first by

1857
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:33,120
medical medium

1858
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:37,260
it never said anywhere anyhow that the

1859
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:40,440
cause of Lupus hypothyroidism

1860
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:42,840
multiple sclerosis Ra was Epstein-Barr

1861
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,300
that never existed

1862
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:47,760
that was post-published material and

1863
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:50,760
backdated material they backedated

1864
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:53,640
material that never said it was the

1865
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,020
cause reactivated Epstein-Barr wasn't

1866
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:58,080
even a thing

1867
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:00,659
until medical medium

1868
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,640
the medical Arena both alternative and

1869
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:04,920
conventional medicine believe that once

1870
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,199
you got Epstein-Barr it went away and it

1871
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:10,500
was mono and that was it they never knew

1872
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:12,179
it caused the problem post mono

1873
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,179
it's only medical medium information

1874
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:17,820
that put it out there that Epstein-Barr

1875
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:20,340
reactivates and causes problems years

1876
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:22,199
later giving you ra

1877
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:24,540
and a whole bunch of other conditions in

1878
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:27,380
fibromyalgia that's original medical

1879
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,380
medium information

1880
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,179
foreign

1881
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:35,100
verse taught first understood first and

1882
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:36,719
nothing else existed for that if you

1883
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,699
were sick all these years you would know

1884
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:41,880
that if you were sick for many years

1885
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:45,500
before you would know it didn't exist

1886
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,500
and no one had answers

1887
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,560
but when millions of people go to their

1888
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,900
doctors every day because guess what

1889
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,699
millions of medical medium books went

1890
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,140
around the world and they people

1891
01:13:53,699 --> 01:13:57,960
millions of people went to their

1892
01:13:55,140 --> 01:14:00,239
doctor's offices asking them to test

1893
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,920
them for me for actually Epstein-Barr

1894
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,780
because of medical medium and they

1895
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,280
brought their medical medium books in

1896
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:06,900
millions of people around the world

1897
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,020
brought them to their doctors right

1898
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:12,179
there and then

1899
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,820
everybody started learning the true

1900
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:17,699
cause of their conditions and then

1901
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:20,820
science research got very upset because

1902
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:23,699
they were looking like idiots science

1903
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:25,739
and research and the clinics looked like

1904
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:28,739
they didn't know why people were sick

1905
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:31,440
and they started now saying well maybe

1906
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:35,219
it's Epstein-Barr maybe it's possibly

1907
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:37,560
Epstein-Barr way post medical medium

1908
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:39,420
laughs

1909
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,100
the books go into depth on The

1910
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:42,719
Housewives and what the information is

1911
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,640

1912
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,260
that today there's no article there's no

1915
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:53,280
how it works and it does in these books

1916
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:56,520
and that's how it works

1917
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:58,020

1918
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,300

on their chance to heal because of

1925
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:14,159
people doing this yes and they will

1926
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:15,120
continue to miss out and continue to

1927
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:17,940
miss out

1928
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:20,040
and that's what's gonna happen

1929
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:21,420
right but they still got to go through

1930
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:23,159
all the torture they have to swallow

1931
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:25,380

ionizer water and get nettles in their

1938
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,440
brain what else do they have to do

1939
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,300
before they find medical medium

1940
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:41,340
information oh they have to dissolve all

1941
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:43,560
their teeth with apple cider vinegar

1942
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:45,780
oh no it's medical medium information it

1943
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,580
makes your teeth go bad not all the

1944
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:50,159
vinegar you had and the caffeine you had

1945
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:51,719
all these years

1946
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:53,340
and everything else

1947
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:55,860
hmm

1948
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:59,239
I have all my teeth

1949
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:59,239
I have all my teeth

1950
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:03,659
all the podcast doctors by the way that

1951
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,000
are younger than me and older than me

1952
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:07,380
don't have their teeth

1953
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,719
half their mouths are filled with

1954
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:12,620
implants but they're green tea they say

1955
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:12,620
is sure helpful

1956
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:16,080
you know it's kind of crazy when you

1957
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:19,260
think about it all

1958
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:21,719
all of it when you think about it

1959
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:24,420
hmm

1960
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:27,060
but what do people go through

1961
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:29,699
apple cider vinegar gummies which

1962
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:31,739
totally annihilates their stomach acid

1963
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:34,080
their stomachs actually destroys their

1964
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:35,640
stomach glands to Charcoal right

1965
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,560
destroys our Linings and makes them

1966
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:40,140
deficient what else nutrient deficient

1967
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,980
just keep on going down the path of that

1968
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,719
like

1969
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:44,040
but that's the Colts out there and

1970
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,199
that's what people do

1971
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:48,060
and then they destroy their bodies with

1972
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:50,820
all the stuff out there

1973
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:52,980
and have no idea

1974
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:54,540
and they'll never know to go to Medical

1975
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:57,120
medium information because the Cults

1976
01:16:54,540 --> 01:17:00,000
have them so controlled the goal for all

1977
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,640
the Cults out there okay

1978
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,280
in the medical industry is death by a

1979
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,560
Thousand Cuts and then to discredit

1980
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:09,000
Medical medium information because it

1981
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,520
would take over

1982
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,920
medical medium info would take over if

1983
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,840
people actually knew why they were sick

1984
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,179
and knew they can heal think about that

1985
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:20,520
people knew why they were sick and they

1986
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:22,320
can heal it would actually go like

1987
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,040
really crazy

1988
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,040
what's up

1989
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,980
all right

1990
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:36,120

brain saver what did today turn into

1993
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:44,040
because I'm trying to figure it out now

1994
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:47,880
it was about the late blast it was about

1995
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:49,440
also the episode on medical meme podcast

1996
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,780

at Apple podcast

2002
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:05,280

things you know like oh yeah sure uh we

2018
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:43,860
knew that they actually did it

2019
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,780
it's crazy how it works all right you

2020
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:47,840
guys

2021
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:47,840
um

2022
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:52,500
I think we had a good time I don't know

2023
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,659
I had a good time

2024
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:56,340
Jody says just knowing the root causes

2025
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:58,320
of things have given me such peace of

2026
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:59,520
mind right there and empowerment now I

2027
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,659
want to talk about that it's worth more

2028
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,520
than gold

2029
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:04,739
so what happens is there's people in the

2030
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:07,199
medical immune community that were out

2031
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:08,580
there in the sea of confusion right they

2032
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,719
were out there in the Cults they were

2033
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:12,600
sick

2034
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:14,880
and then they found mm info

2035
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,400
and then they used mm like

2036
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,860
supplementation

2037
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:23,640
info they used mm

2038
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:27,780
food info right detailed information all

2039
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:30,540
of it they used it to heal and then they

2040
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:33,600
were like well I want to do my own thing

2041
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:35,699
I don't want to cite mm anymore I don't

2042
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,980
want to say mm did it

2043
01:19:35,699 --> 01:19:40,560
so I'm gonna kind of curtail my own way

2044
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:42,960
of doing it and hey and them didn't

2045
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,100
create a fruit or vegetable fruit and

2046
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,780
vegetables have been out there in the

2047
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,159
vegan movement so I'm just gonna say

2048
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:50,340
whatever

2049
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:51,960
but what happened is the person found

2050
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,760
answers to why they were sick and it

2051
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,320
gave them so much peace and relief it

2052
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,420
already ignited their healing process

2053
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,560
right there just like you're saying Jody

2054
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,580
just like you're saying I know you're

2055
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,960
not doing what they're doing I'm just

2056
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:02,820
saying you said just knowing the root

2057
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,679
causes of things have given me such

2058
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:06,719
peace of mind and empowerment it's worth

2059
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:09,000
more than gold

2060
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,500
and then they got that peace of mind and

2061
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,580
they started healing and then they

2062
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:17,219
applied the tools that weren't out there

2063
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:19,860
celery juice wasn't even in the vegan

2064
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:22,500
movement no one was doing it

2065
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:24,179
I know the vegan doctors out there I

2066
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:26,460
know the vegan people out there they

2067
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:27,900
weren't doing 16 32 ounces of straight

2068
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:30,000
celery juice they didn't even know it

2069
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:32,340
restored anything they didn't know

2070
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,340
anything about it the point is is then

2071
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:38,100
they apply the medical medium tools and

2072
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:40,080
they start healing but because celery is

2073
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,580
a vegetable which is an herb it's not

2074
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,739
even a vegetable they're like wait a

2075
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,960
minute hidden Creed celery celery

2076
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:48,300
existed out there I need to do my own

2077
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:50,219
thing now meanwhile they're canceling

2078
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:51,600
out the fact that they healed by finding

2079
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:52,500
the peace in their heart of what was

2080
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,960
wrong

2081
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:56,400
and then they applied the tools that

2082
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,960
didn't exist in the vegan movement I'm

2083
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,400
sorry but they didn't

2084
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:01,500
you know what existed in a vegan

2085
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:05,100
movement chocolate lots of chocolate

2086
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:07,080
lots of vegan fat lots of nut Butters

2087
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:09,900
you know whatever lots of vegan cheese

2088
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:11,040
so and trust me these people tried all

2089
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:12,960
that and the whole point is they come

2090
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:15,000
into medical medium they learn how to

2091
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,400
really navigate

2092
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,679
and heal

2093
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,320
and then they want to stab medical

2094
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:24,600
medium information in the back they want

2095
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:27,300
to stick the knife in

2096
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:29,100
and they don't want to they just want to

2097
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,540
do their own thing stick the knife in

2098
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:32,760
and twist it

2099
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:34,860
and I get it

2100
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:37,679
the traps are everywhere pay attention

2101
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:40,320
to the details

2102
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:42,719
it's in the books good information here

2103
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:44,100
brain shot therapies are really powerful

2104
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,679
you guys

2105
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:50,699
the brain shot therapies come from above

2106
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:52,920
all the information comes from above

2107
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:54,480
and I've been in this for over 30 plus

2108
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,640
years

2109
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:00,659
I have fed

2110
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:04,520
the good stuff into the vegan movements

2111
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:04,520
for over 30 plus years

2112
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:10,500
what you won't find that I do is I don't

2113
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,699
attack people by their name

2114
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:15,560
right

2115
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:18,659
because as much as I want to say

2116
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:21,179
what happened and what's going on

2117
01:22:18,659 --> 01:22:25,440
I don't want to do that

2118
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:28,020
but I can tell you this okay

2119
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,000
you wouldn't believe

2120
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:31,739
what

2121
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,080
they were doing

2122
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:36,900
in the vegan movement

2123
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:39,420
along the years that I had to be like no

2124
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:41,100
you got to do that because that's not

2125
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:43,560
good no you got to do that you wouldn't

2126
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:45,960
believe how much correcting

2127
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:48,120
and fixing to get the vegan movement to

2128
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,040
where it is today and it's still cracked

2129
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,840
out there it's still cracked

2130
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,940
and they're not doing what they need to

2131
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,340
do if you want to be vegan but you can

2132
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:58,800
be animal protein and heal

2133
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:00,600
I welcome all animal protein people in

2134
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,699
fact medical mean Community is what like

2135
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:05,219
probably 60 animal protein people or

2136
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:07,080
something 70 and they heal with all the

2137
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:08,880
information and the tools

2138
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:11,060
and I've never attacked animal protein

2139
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,800
ever

2140
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:14,940
if you knew the people I helped it would

2141
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,500
shock you

2142
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,120
if you knew the people I helped in the

2143
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:20,340
vegan movement

2144
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:24,060
it would shock you

2145
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:26,520

2191
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,739
on

2192

television

2193
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:39,420
Jaime says the reason people steal and

2194
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:42,420
twist medical medium info is because

2195
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:44,280
Anthony doesn't monetize his info and

2196
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:48,300
hasn't created an Empire

2197
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:51,120
Jamie that is 100 correct

2198
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:54,540
don't yell in your ear sorry

2199
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:56,219
maybe that's 100 correct Dr nesbit's

2200
