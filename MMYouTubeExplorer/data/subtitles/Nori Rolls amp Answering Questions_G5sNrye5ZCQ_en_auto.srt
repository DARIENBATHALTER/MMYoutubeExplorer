started in june last year with celery

hey you know christina there's no

137
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,040
scientific studies out there

138
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,000
so for celery juice but you kept with it

139
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,479
you know so you must

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,040
be pretty spiritual because that

141
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,440
information comes from above and

142
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,880
there's no scientific study that fixes

143
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,320
people with chronic illness or chronic

144
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,680
migraines or anything

145
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,520
and that's what people say to be like

146
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,000
well don't drink your celery juice

147
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,120
there's no

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
scientific study oh that's funny that's

149
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,080
a good one

150
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,919
you know i cuz because i didn't know

151
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
scientific studies actually got anybody

152
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,360

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
scientific study that fixed anybody with

156
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
that mysterious chronic illness

157
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,520
but celery juice works but hey

158
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,600
no one wants you on there in the science

159
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,880
world because it wasn't studied so they

160
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,720
don't want you drinking it they would

161
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,120
rather have your migraines christina

162
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,840

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,960
so i'm going to be on tick tock live

173
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,720
later too

174
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,000
um there's no shingles

175
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,880
test just so you know that so

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,360
uh lorraine casey hi anthony what do you

177
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,840
ask

178
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,039
our doctor to test for if you think you

179
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,960
have shingles they

180
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,160
can't test for that it's really hard to

181
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,280
find that shingles virus

182
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,919
really difficult so what happens is with

183
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,880
viruses like shingles and epstein-barr

184
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,440
is they may trigger off the a a they may

185
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,319
trigger off the c-reactive protein test

186
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,000
they may trigger off the mthfr gene

187
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,199
mutation test these are all

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,039
in inflammation markers right

189
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,039

forth an anti-nuclear antigen test

196
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,080

you can call them green onions uh i call

304
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,519
scallion in half if you want to

305
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,360
i like to cut them i also like to leave

306
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,640
them whole it depends on how i'm feeling

307
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
that day i might

308
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,839
with the mood i'm in like what kind of

309
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,800
mood i'm in

310
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,760
so i'm kind of tearing this scallion

311
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,399
apart a little bit

312
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,800
putting it in here so i got the scallion

313
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,880
in there

314
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,079
that's the green onion i got some

315
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,920
sprouts i'm going to put a little bit

316
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,519
more of these alfalfa sprouts these are

317
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,720
healing foods

318
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,640
sprouts are a powerful healing tool

319
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
we got some of this too we got some of

320
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,120
this cilantro

321
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,519
julie i get back pain every time i get a

322
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,519
big

323
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:02,000
upset what happens is that

324
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,200
when you get upset like a big upset like

325
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,519
any kind of stress

326
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,640
or something really triggers you off

327
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,120
adrenaline

328
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,399
can actually up that inflammation

329
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,360
because adrenaline

330
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
could stimulate and feed a virus like

331
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,480
shingles

332
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,160
also adrenaline can lower the immune

333
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
system so if you get a big upset your

334
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,920
immune system lowers

335
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,760
low-grade viral stuff kicks up and then

336
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,720
boom the back has a problem that's how

337
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,399
it works

338
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,880
um this is dulce these are dulce

339
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,880
strips right here i like being generous

340
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,880
with dolls inside these nori wraps this

341
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,440
is the banana nori wrap you can do

342
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,440
banananori wrap you can do uh potato

343
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,279
nori wrap i got potatoes here

344
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,320
so now you can moisten the dull strips

345
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,800
i'm not going to moisten these i'm going

346
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,079
to kind of leave them dry

347
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,720
and flavor is just so packed in that

348
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,959

what else is going on okay first of all

375
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,360
you're doing some incredible things

376
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,600
right there

377
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,480
okay so that's to start with guys i just

378
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,279
rolled up

379
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
anori right here this is the banananori

380
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,720
wrap

381
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,320
um this is one i'm

382
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,600
not going to cut it yet but i'm going to

383
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,240
eventually get there i'm going to roll a

384
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
couple of these

385
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,440
um first of all there's protocols

386
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,480
there's a there's a ra protocol

387
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,440
in cleanse the heal but in this book

388
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,720
here

389
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,480
i mean there's really infra this thing's

390
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,519
packed with ra information with the

391
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,839
protocol

392
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,120
and what ra is diagnosed as an

393
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,959
autoimmune condition

394
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,320
autoimmune condition means they don't

395
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,079
know science research

396
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
doesn't know what's causing it so it's a

397
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,800
mystery i

398
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,240
i reveal that mystery it's viral the

399
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,360
cause of ra

400
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,839
rheumatoid arthritis is epstein-barr so

401
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,680
if you want to heal and you're doing the

402
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,959
celery juice and heavy metal detox

403
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
you're doing lemon water it's a great

404
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,920
start

405
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,399
but it would be good to learn maybe what

406
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,480
foods you shouldn't do because those

407
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,560
foods will feed the epstein-barr virus

408
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
make you sicker or maybe learn a

409
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,399
protocol that's in here

410
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,079
so this is the new addition make sure

411
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,480
it's a new edition that's the way to go

412
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,480
on that

413
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,560
so i'm going to make another one with

414
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,760
you guys we're going to make a bunch of

415
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,079
these i'm going to cut them up in a

416
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,160
little while too

417
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,320
and you guys have been thinking about a

418
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,399
couple different things

419
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,600
you know a friend of mine i haven't

420
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,360
talked to in a long time

421
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,040
right she's pregnant and

422
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,360
she was asking me different things what

423
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,320
can she do for her health

424
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,399
and i found out that she's on caffeine

425
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,720
she was on a lot of caffeine before she

426
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,320
got pregnant

427
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,000
and she's on caffeine while she's

428
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,279
pregnant

429
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,800
now she didn't know she was on caffeine

430
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,720
while she's pregnant but she found out

431
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,839
when i spoke to her she was on a lot of

432
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
caffeine

433
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,880
while being pregnant and i want to talk

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
about

435
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
what happens there because she was

436
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,920
asking me well what can go wrong

437
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,800
what can happen am i okay is my baby

438
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,360
okay

439
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,959
what does this mean so she didn't know

440
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,279
she was on caffeine

441
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,000
but she was she was eating chocolate

442
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,760
every day

443
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,839
she was told by a health practitioner

444
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,920
she's told also by someone else that

445
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,279
chocolate's really good for you when

446
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,399
it's the 70

447
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,959
80 90 the dark chocolate the chocolate

448
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,560
cacao nibs all that stuff

449
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,000
chocolate powder so she was told it was

450
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,920
really good for her so she

451
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,240
was eating it while pregnant

452
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,839
something to really kind of digest there

453
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,800
for a second while i'm making this nori

454
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,839
this next nori

455
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,680
wrap um getting some sprouts here

456
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,959
think about that a little bit she was

457
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,040
asking me well

458
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,120
i didn't know chocolate was packed with

459
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,880
caffeine i go especially that chocolate

460
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,880
it's really packed with caffeine she's

461
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,440
like okay so i've been on caffeine every

462
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,880
day

463
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,839
with my baby i go yeah

464
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,240
your baby's got the caffeine running

465
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,839
through

466
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,000
it you know and

467
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,360
you know and right now she's she so

468
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,279
she's

469
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,800
she's so she got really spooked for a

470
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,720
minute she's like what do i do i said

471
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,560
first of all stop the caffeine

472
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,240
and then she said well what is it doing

473
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,639
to my baby

474
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
what is it doing to my baby and i said

475
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,800
for one

476
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,560
your baby is not going to be able to

477
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,320
rest so easy

478
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,600
because your baby is going to be over

479
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,000
stimulated

480
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,240
and inside the womb basically your baby

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,320
is going to be all jacked up on caffeine

482
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,759
and that's going to be very difficult

483
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,639
for the baby

484
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,839
and she stopped immediately immediately

485
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,800
just stopped

486
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,120
she's a very spiritual person knows a

487
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,920
decent amount of health information

488
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,399
always thought herself to be you know

489
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,360
yeah a health expert in many ways

490
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,199
just a lot of natural things and having

491
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,519
a natural childbirth

492
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:56,240
right and she's got it all planned and

493
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,639
her girlfriends are pregnant they're all

494
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,519
eating chocolate

495
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,440
and what happens is people wonder why

496
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,880
their baby doesn't sleep

497
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,880
when their baby's born

498
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,079
babies going through withdrawal which

499
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,000
all can last a long time for a baby

500
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,760
and it depends on the breast milk too

501
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,319
how much caffeine are you using

502
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,039
that's going into the breast milk all

503
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,400
this stuff

504
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,839
really important information so i want

505
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,360
to keep on going with it i just want to

506
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,360
get this nori rolled up in a second here

507
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,919
caffeine so i was telling her caffeine's

508
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,039
a type of poison

509
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,559
it's a drug and

510
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,240
i'm going to get some i'm actually going

511
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,160
to get some dull strips we're going to

512
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
go inside this nori roll here

513
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
it's delicious this is going to be so

514
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,520
good so she was

515
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,280
she was mortified because she was

516
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,880
wondering

517
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,559
because she's a mama bear you know in a

518
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
sense where she told me she goes i'm a

519
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,640
mama bear

520
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,160
i protect my friends babies i protect my

521
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,400
baby

522
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,480
and that's what she said to me and she

523
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,080
was she was wondering why

524
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
health professionals are saying it's

525
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,200
okay

526
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,280
like she's wondering why her doctor

527
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,000
thinks it's okay she's wondering why

528
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,200
it's on the internet and it's okay and

529
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,960
she's wondering why

530
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,640
health influencers that are pregnant are

531
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,919
thinking it's okay and health coaches

532
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,280
tell health influencers that are

533
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,840
pregnant and other people

534
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:26,640
that it's okay and she's realizing

535
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,600
it's not okay and it was like a huge

536
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,200
awakening

537
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,720
huge awakening just really was

538
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:39,120
and so when you have that much caffeine

539
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,120
running through your baby inside of you

540
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,840
it's it's it's not a good thing

541
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,280
if you don't know you just don't know

542
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,840
it's nobody's fault

543
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,200
not well actually it's not the mom's

544
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,880
fault at all

545
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
it's the fault of the system it's the

546
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,080
fault of the caffeine

547
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,799
industry it's the fault of caffeine

548
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,240
industry

549
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,480
health authorities health hackers

550
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,320
that think they're health experts it's

551
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,360
the fault of all them

552
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,000
and then them telling women it's okay to

553
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
do caffeine

554
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,760
while you're pregnant okay to do

555
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,240
caffeine after pregnancy and everything

556
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,080
else

557
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,240
so so um but

558
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,559
but the thing is is that the bottom line

559
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,960
is when it comes down to that

560
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,480
a lot of things can happen your baby can

561
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,160
not rest

562
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,400
while your baby wants to rest internally

563
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,000
and so that caffeine makes it so if the

564
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
baby wanted to rest

565
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,559
naturally if the baby was going to rest

566
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,559
naturally because there's a resting

567
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,720
there's a whole resting sequence that a

568
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,799
baby has inside the womb

569
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
that this shifts it and it rocks the

570
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,640
boat constantly

571
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,160
so and when that happens then you know

572
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,160
when the baby's born

573
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,919
then there's all kinds of sleep problems

574
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,600
in different ways i mean

575
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
baby could be up all night there's

576
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,679
withdrawal and then

577
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,280
if there's still chocolate happening

578
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,720
dirt that's filling up the breast milk

579
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,799
if you if the breast milk is getting

580
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,159
filled up the coffee drink caffeine

581
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,240
it's getting filled up with chocolate

582
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,840
caffeine matcha tea caffeine

583
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,080
and so they'll say oh matcha tea is good

584
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,919
for pregnant women it's great for women

585
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,440
get a lot of energy after a pregnancy

586
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,640
after giving birth

587
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
so i want to talk about that a little

588
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,280
bit more too so i'm cutting these right

589
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,320
here these two for now

590
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,360
so that's a banana wrap right there

591
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,200
i like them thinner so i do like them

592
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,320
thinner so that's a banana wrap

593
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,840
and i'll show you guys i'm going to make

594
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,840
a lot more i got to make the potato wrap

595
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,000
so women do a lot of caffeine before

596
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,440
they get pregnant

597
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,720
and they wear down their adrenals and

598
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,400
they wear down their adrenals and they

599
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,480
wear down their adrenals

600
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,600
okay and then they have a difficult

601
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,720
difficult uh birth childbirth

602
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,799
because their adrenals weaken so it can

603
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,679
lead into longer labor

604
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,280
a much more difficult time but no one's

605
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,080
teaching women about that

606
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,000
so it could be years of caffeine use

607
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,919
wasting the adrenals so by the time you

608
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,840
have your baby

609
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,679
then you have a difficult childbirth so

610
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:17,600
there's that alone all on its own

611
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:19,679
so that's an issue that happens too um

612
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,440
it takes tremendous amounts of

613
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,520
adrenaline

614
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,200
to give birth it takes like a lifetime

615
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,120
of adrenaline to give birth

616
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,600
that's how the birthing process happens

617
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,000
it's from that adrenaline surge

618
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,919
and it's not just one adrenaline surge

619
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,159
it's many adrenaline surges

620
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,679
it's lots of adrenaline surges through

621
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,679
throughout giving birth

622
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,200
and the adrenals have to be strong for

623
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,840
that and

624
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,280
women's adrenals already are challenged

625
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,280
in so many ways with just

626
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,520
today's world in so many ways in

627
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,000
different for different reasons

628
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:00,080
and so when it comes down to needing all

629
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,480
of that supersonic adrenaline strength

630
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,080
to give birth it's not there so then the

631
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,760
adrenals struggle and they struggle and

632
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,240
they struggle and they struggle

633
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,600
okay so that happens to women a lot

634
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,520
that's one thing right there i'm making

635
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,039
these banana wraps right here you guys

636
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,039
be using some alfalfa sprouts

637
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,039
but keep in mind though

638
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
that the caffeine industry they don't

639
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,679
care about any of this they just want to

640
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,840
make sure that

641
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,200
you get your high no one teaches you

642
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,799
different

643
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,799
and then after birth after birth

644
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,240
a mom can be more exhausted than she

645
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,080
should be because the adrenals aren't

646
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,440
recouping so then you need more caffeine

647
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,240
you need more chocolate you need more

648
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
matcha tea you need

649
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
more green tea you need more coffee

650
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,000
drinks

651
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,799
because you're trying to overcompensate

652
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,200
for that more

653
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,240
loss that more loss and that more loss

654
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,600
you know

655
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,360
and um so that's important to know there

656
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,360
that's something to consider but then

657
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,120
it's after with the breastfeeding that's

658
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,799
the thing too you got to keep in mind

659
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,640
with the breastfeeding

660
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,919
because of the breastfeeding the milk is

661
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,400
contaminated with

662
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,240
caffeine which is a poison and that's a

663
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,720
whole other thing on its own that we got

664
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,880
to be

665
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,880
mindful about putting some dolls in here

666
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:19,280
um guys making another one

667
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,280
another banana roll right here

668
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,200
so these are all things that kind of

669
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,640
keep to keep an eye on

670
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,640
so i'm rolling this one right here

671
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,960
so you guys if you just got here

672
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,600
i'm making these bananas nori wraps

673
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,120
so that's what i'm making so here they

674
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,919
are it's in the medical medium new

675
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,159
edition

676
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,600
i'm going to make potato wraps too so

677
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:51,840
i'm in the process

678
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,840
um going to make another

679
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,880
yeah i mean look this might not be

680
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,960
interesting to some people but

681
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,480
i think our children are are really

682
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,520
important i mean right

683
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,720
that's the whole thing everybody is so

684
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,679
worried

685
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,240
about your children and rightfully so

686
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,559
and

687
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,520
i think that when health authorities and

688
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:17,039
health experts don't teach women this

689
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,200
it's like i mean they know better

690
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,200
right don't they know better like the

691
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,880
health health experts

692
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,240
doctors should know better so um

693
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,760
something to be considered i'm gonna

694
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,080
make some potato wraps right now

695
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,080
actually

696
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,320
i'm going to move on to a potato wrap as

697
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,039
we speak

698
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,760
um so i'm cutting some potato slices

699
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,760
nice and thin

700
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,600
this is what i'm doing see guys i'll

701
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,799
read some questions right here what

702
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,799
comes after the sprouts

703
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,840
i'll be right there

704
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,000
i'm back so you guys making the potato

705
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,360
version right here so

706
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,360
i'm doing some cilantro

707
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,960
doing the green onion again so it's for

708
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,039
people that don't like bananas or

709
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,480
they're afraid of bananas

710
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,720
a lot of people are afraid of bananas

711
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,960
which is really sad because potassium is

712
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,080
a critical critical nutrient it really

713
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,559
is

714
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,960
critical mineral we need potassium for

715
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,559
our brain for neurotransmitters

716
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,480
so um i got some alfalfa sprouts i got

717
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,760
some cilantro in here i got some green

718
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,200
onion

719
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,200
i'm gonna put a little bit of

720
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,080
this dulse i'm gonna roll it up now you

721
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,080
can do these in different ways like with

722
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,279
the banana nori wrap

723
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,440
you can do the whole banana okay

724
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,799
so i'll show you that version too so i'm

725
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,919
going to cut these

726
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,919
that's the potato one

727
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,799
now you could use the whole banana in

728
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,640
here which is another way i like to do

729
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,120
it too i like to slice the banana

730
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,760
but i also like to do a whole banana so

731
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,720
i like to do

732
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,400
both versions recipe in the book has the

733
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,240
whole banana

734
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,440
so i'm going to use some orange right

735
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,640
here to moisten it up

736
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,720
so our children are supposed to be

737
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,360
really important but i noticed that

738
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:48,240
health experts podcast doctors

739
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,320
health influencers they're just pushing

740
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,840
pushing and pushing the whole

741
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,240
chocolate narrative they're pushing the

742
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,840
whole hey it's plant medicine they're

743
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,440
pushing the whole coffee drinks they're

744
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,880
pushing the whole matcha tea

745
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,440
and they're pushing down to pregnant

746
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,679
women but nobody's thinking

747
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,120
nobody's thinking about the babies when

748
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,200
it comes down to that

749
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,559
and that's where i'm kind of like that's

750
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,919
where i'm like wait a minute are we

751
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,679
losing it

752
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,200
like are we losing it or something

753
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,760
putting the whole banana in this one you

754
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
guys

755
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,000
because that's the way that's a great

756
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:23,200
way to do it

757
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,600
something to think about putting sprouts

758
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
in here

759
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:35,840
putting a little bit of cilantro in this

760
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,840
one too

761
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,760
and i think that's something we just

762
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,960
like missed you guys are making some

763
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,600
nori

764
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,360
some banana nori wraps right here so i'm

765
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,120
going to cut this one

766
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,840
this is the one with the whole banana

767
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,840
right here

768
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,000
but then the breast feeding we got to

769
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,919
think about the breast milk

770
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,279
being pure and clean i like the heavy

771
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,919
metal detox smoothie because it's

772
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,480
removing

773
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,240
nettles out of the breast milk that's

774
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,039
why the heavy metal detox smoothie is so

775
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,159
great

776
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,159
so there you go

777
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,360
that's the banana that's a whole banana

778
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,399
right there using this one

779
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,640
that's a banana nori wrap right there

780
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,000
see so you got the sprouts in there got

781
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,600
a little bit of cilantro in there you

782
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,360
got the banana you got the green onion

783
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,240
which is scallion right

784
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,880
so you got that um yeah it's like sushi

785
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,399
there you go

786
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,159
with a banana and i'm gonna do it with

787
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,919
potato too so

788
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,000
there we go so this is really fun just

789
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,320
making a bunch of these

790
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,520
this is probably like i don't know this

791
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,440
is this is a more

792
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,960
fun one for me i like it i'm going to

793
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,480
use some potato

794
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,880
do some potato versions squeezing a

795
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,720
little

796
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,720
orange juice on top of this nori sheet

797
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,919
so you want your breast milk to be

798
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,600
really really clean

799
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,840
you've got to look at what's with what

800
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,279
you consume and what you're eating

801
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,360
keep the caffeine out keep that out of

802
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,720
the breast milk so the baby's not

803
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,559
having problems because that's another

804
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,760
thing too babies

805
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,200
they'll get really really cranky

806
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,760
when they're going through constant

807
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,080
caffeine withdrawal each day

808
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,960
and then yeah they're addicted to

809
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:21,120
caffeine through the breast milk

810
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,559
and won't sleep or will cry more

811
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,080
be unhappy because that's the caffeine

812
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,919
going on and that's the caffeine

813
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:33,200
talking in the baby

814
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,120
and almost every mom

815
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,240
is drinking or eating some kind of

816
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,440
caffeine product

817
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,640
while breastfeeding no one's talking

818
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,799
about it

819
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,240
no one's talking about it no one says

820
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,720
anything about it there's nothing out

821
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,880
there

822
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,480
health professionals don't talk about it

823
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,840
no well what am i saying health

824
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,640
professionals should say do more

825
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,559
caffeine

826
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,000
health professionals just say tell moms

827
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,080
that are breastfeeding do more

828
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,760
of it putting some dulls in here again

829
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:08,159
make sure you do lots of chocolate

830
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:09,279
so and it's really sad because it's

831
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,279
going to guarantee

832
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,279
that your baby grows up and then we'll

833
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,600
be consuming caffeine more and more and

834
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,600
more

835
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,200
and then the cycle never gets broken

836
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,240
ever

837
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,559
anyway so you guys are making these talk

838
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,919
about

839
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:36,159
a couple bunch of things i want to read

840
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:38,159
some comments too

841
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,600
yeah and it's not it's not the doreen

842
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,640
it's not the mom's faults at all of

843
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,960
course not no way

844
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,320
it's they want to do the best there is

845
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,120
for their kids

846
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,240
100 they want to do the best they want

847
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,440
to make sure

848
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,039
the kids their their babies get the best

849
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,120
there is all of it

850
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,960
and then the whole thing with after

851
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,880
pregnancy you get the hair loss

852
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,559
so a lot of women suffer from hair

853
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,320
thinning hair loss after pregnancies

854
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,960
even if it's six months after

855
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,399
child birth a year after child birth two

856
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,039
months after childbirth

857
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,799
during childbirth and because so much

858
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,760
adrenaline

859
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,120
was used and caffeine was stimulating so

860
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,320
much adrenaline so you get the hair

861
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,480
thinning

862
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,000
and look i know i've been talking about

863
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,440
caffeine a lot you guys would totally

864
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,120
get it but there's so many different

865
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,880
aspects of it that's why

866
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,760
it's not just one thing it's just not

867
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,159
one just not just one aspect or one part

868
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,559
of

869
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,640
the story with caffeine so i don't mean

870
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,559
to caffeine you guys crazy but

871
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,760
there's a reason for it because it's not

872
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,840
just okay

873
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,919
caffeine withdrawal and people shouldn't

874
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,880
be doing it not good for them no

875
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,880
it ages the skin the hair thins hair

876
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,640
falls out for women there's that the sun

877
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,320
spots all happen and they gotta all get

878
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,760
the laser techniques the hormones get

879
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,200
all in balance right

880
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,880
so all that is coming out of the

881
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,720
adrenals all that's you know all that

882
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,519
it's because of the adrenals because of

883
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,240
the caffeine but then the baby

884
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,840
the whole baby protection protecting the

885
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,000
baby and making sure

886
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,519
your baby's safe make sure your baby has

887
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,279
the best food and

888
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,799
all of that well no one's thinking about

889
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,399
the caffeine part there

890
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,240
and and um and here's the thing

891
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,240
coffee's just been getting stronger

892
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,320
chocolate's been getting stronger

893
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,880
and stronger so now we're in a place

894
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,600
where espressos there's moms out there

895
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,880
breastfeeding while doing espressos and

896
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,840
because they're told to

897
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,840
do it now

898
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,360
they're told to do it i mean look you

899
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,360
guys i could just forget it

900
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,559
i could forget it never talk about it

901
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,240
again how about that

902
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,760
never tell anybody we just don't tell

903
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,760
anybody

904
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,960
let's keep it quiet not tell anybody not

905
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,200
say anything okay

906
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,799
and then just let women that are

907
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,000
pregnant make sure they're eating lots

908
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,360
of chocolate make sure they're doing

909
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,799
lots of cacao make sure they're doing

910
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,880

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,559
else and matcha tea while pregnant

912
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,159
and then also breastfeeding we can do

913
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,399
that we can keep it quiet

914
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,240
i mean we right we don't have to go

915
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,960
there

916
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,840
but i just i just i can't do that

917
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,039
um there's a lot of skin hacking going

918
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,159

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,279
internet you'll see on youtube you'll

935
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,080
see

936
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,720
you know it's all about skin skin skin

937
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,279
and

938
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,399
social media and what can you do for

939
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,919
your skin like

940
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,679
what kind of what kind of treatment can

941
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,640
you do for your skin skin on your your

942
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,880
skin on your face

943
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:06,640
in other areas and what's going on is

944
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,320
that when you do like the micro needling

945
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,679
we think that that's a good thing we're

946
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,040
being taught that that's a good thing

947
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,200
but it's actually not

948
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,639
so if you guys always want to know like

949
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,720
what i'm thinking or what

950
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,839
you know my thoughts are about it all

951
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,200
because i know you guys have a lot of

952
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,679
questions and i've seen a question about

953
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,599
that but i never answered it before

954
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,359
and i haven't i didn't have a chance but

955
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,520
here's how this here's how it works the

956
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,480
micro needling

957
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,679
injures the skin right so it injures it

958
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,599
so then

959
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:39,040
your skin your body's healing process

960
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,639
tr amps up and it tries to heal that

961
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,159
injury so you're doing the micro

962
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,440
needling so you're doing that all on

963
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,720
your face and micro needling and

964
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,240
everything right

965
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,760
and you're doing that and so you're

966
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:52,079
injuring your skin you're

967
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,119
injuring it in hopes that it heals

968
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,000
and it comes out better right

969
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,160
it's really not the reality of it that's

970
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,440
not how it works

971
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,000
what happens is that your body is over

972
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,160
compensating in the moment to try to

973
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,640
heal what you're doing for an injury

974
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,640
so you're doing the micro needling and

975
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,880
then your body tries to overcompensate

976
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,560
and

977
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,000
oh my god i got the body your body's

978
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,440
like talking and like i gotta heal

979
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,920
this your body goes into high gear to

980
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,280
heal this and it takes a lot of reserves

981
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,960
it takes a lot of physical reserves

982
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,040
internally to go and try to heal the

983
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,079
skin after you micro needle right

984
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,440
and do really really harsh peels um

985
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,760
but the problems in our skin is really

986
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,040
within so it's deep inside of us that's

987
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,920
where the real problems

988
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,440
lie with skin it's not on the surface

989
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,320
that's not where the problem

990
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,079
lies it's within it's deeper that's

991
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,720
where the real issues are

992
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,320
and so we try a lot of different things

993
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,359
we're always trying to hack our skin

994
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,200
we're always trying to

995
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,119
you know bio hacks and we're always

996
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,119
hacking our skin and that's a big thing

997
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,240
everybody's micro needling but what

998
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,280
happens is with that

999
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,599
is you end up with

1000
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,440
more difficult skin later on from all

1001
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,520
the micro needling

1002
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,880
so i thought it would kind of throw that

1003
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,800
throw that out to you guys so

1004
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,160
just in case i can look out for you and

1005
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,000
protect you guys because that's what i'm

1006
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,240
trying to do it's like

1007
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,240
i'm not i'm not doing this for

1008
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,200
not doing this because i enjoy it so

1009
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,440
much

1010
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,040
doing this because i feel i have to

1011
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,960
protect you guys that's how it's always

1012
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,960
been since i was four years old

1013
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,040
getting this information it's about

1014
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,800
protecting you guys right

1015
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,560
and if you're somebody into

1016
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,400
microneedling that's what you like to do

1017
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,440
you believe in it look

1018
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,040
just move move my thoughts aside and do

1019
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,480
it if you want to do

1020
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,920
but you're causing an injury that's

1021
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,680
forcing your body to then repair it

1022
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,839
so that's what's happening you're

1023
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,880
creating an injury forcing your body to

1024
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,040
repair it

1025
00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:00,160
okay and so your body's gonna

1026
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,079
kill itself to overcompensate

1027
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,920
to try to repair the injuries you're

1028
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,400
creating in hopes that

1029
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,400
it ends up repairing any other day it's

1030
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,480
a great theory meaning

1031
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,839
that it can repair any other damage it's

1032
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,800
a great theory

1033
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,359
but what you get is you get this really

1034
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,280
mild

1035
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,119
mild mild scar tissue that starts to

1036
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,480
occur and that scar tissue

1037
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,079
gets kind of sleek okay so it gets kind

1038
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,280
of polished because that's what scar

1039
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,440
tissue can do

1040
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,680
when it's even like that so you're doing

1041
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,760
this even

1042
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,200
version of scar tissue it's not just one

1043
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,960
like say acne

1044
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,400
and you got a cystic acne and there's

1045
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,000
just one here and there's one here now

1046
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,240
you got a scar here and you got a scar

1047
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,839
here the micro needling first of all

1048
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,359
isn't that deep i know

1049
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:49,520
but it's doing it evenly everywhere

1050
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:52,960
but it's creating a very mild

1051
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:56,400
scar like a sheet like a scar

1052
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,200
sheet everywhere very mild one and over

1053
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,520
time

1054
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,200
that can get really really abrasive

1055
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,200
later on as the years go on

1056
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
now

1057
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,079
[Music]

1058
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,920
the goal for skin and to get skin to

1059
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,119
heal and to get skin as good as you want

1060
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,200
to get it and get skin

1061
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,640
really nice is you got to heal

1062
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,280
internally

1063
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,400
that's how it happens you gotta fix your

1064
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,320
liver

1065
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,800
you have to go after the very thing that

1066
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,240
creates cystic acne too

1067
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,240
those are the things that's where the

1068
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,200
eye has to be on the ball like that's it

1069
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,800
right there

1070
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,480
you guys are having any glitches on

1071
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,000
facebook just watch me on youtube right

1072
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,280
now i'm on youtube

1073
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,280
live right here because i heard people

1074
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,359
were having some glitches

1075
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,680
one of the ways to kill your skin is

1076
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,160
caffeine once again

1077
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,280
and look it's only so many times you

1078
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,760
want to hear it probably because you're

1079
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,000
like no

1080
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,599
no i can't quit oh no i heard it's good

1081
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,119
for me he's driving me crazy with this

1082
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,640
caffeine thing

1083
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,800
but if you care about your skin that's

1084
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,000
one thing right there that's a big deal

1085
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,440
the other thing is

1086
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,240
you know the foods you're doing like

1087
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,800
what foods vinegar is the skin killer

1088
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,119
not surfacely not surfacely like apple

1089
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,800
cider vinegar on the surface is actually

1090
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,800
okay for the skin

1091
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,839
because it can pull away any kind of

1092
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,920
corrosive

1093
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,119
material on the skin any kind of dead

1094
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,200
skin cells

1095
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,440
apple cider vinegar tends to help remove

1096
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,359
those any kind of toxins on your skin

1097
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,680
surface apple cider vinegar on your skin

1098
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,680
surface is actually helpful right

1099
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,440
diluted not straight but diluted

1100
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,800
all right but apple cider vinegar

1101
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,440
internally

1102
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,720
creates skin problems that's the other

1103
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,000
thing you guys are making the

1104
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,920
banana nori wraps potato nori wraps

1105
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,119

i think i got to put a little bit of

1123
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,920
dolls in here

1124
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,079
love you anthony what about botox then

1125
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,680
look i mean a lot of people everybody's

1126
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,839
doing it a lot not everybody but a lot

1127
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,400
of people are doing it

1128
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,480
um i worry about it i worry about the

1129
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,720
whole botulism thing because you know if

1130
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,839
it

1131
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,680
escapes get away if it gets away if it

1132
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,160
if it there's a lot of people that have

1133
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,400
been injured by it because it's because

1134
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,040
it's part of big pharma

1135
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,040
um anybody who really talks about their

1136
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,680
injuries about it it gets scrubbed

1137
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,280
so it gets it gets scrubbed on the

1138
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,200
internet

1139
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,000
you gotta search hard to find the people

1140
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,880
who have been injured from botox

1141
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,200
because it just if they disappear like

1142
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,560
they never existed on the internet

1143
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,480
so it's like they get this horrible

1144
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,960
reaction that happens their face blows

1145
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,720
up

1146
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,000
they're in the hospital for a month

1147
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,839
because the botox

1148
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,119
they can't use their they can't they

1149
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,359
can't talk right

1150
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,400
they're face troops they get the balls

1151
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,599
bell's palsy

1152
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,040
they get something wrong with kind of

1153
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,160
their shoulder and their arm because it

1154
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,839
runs down in there

1155
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,280
they get high fevers whatever it is they

1156
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,640
get and they're in the hospital the

1157
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,520
minute they go on social media and they

1158
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,200
try to sell

1159
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,200
they try to tell their story and tell

1160
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,520
their story they all of a sudden kind of

1161
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,680
like

1162
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,760
get nobody watching anymore and they all

1163
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,800
of a sudden just disappear over time

1164
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,800
and then they're gone they've been

1165
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,200
scrubbed they've been scrubbed off the

1166
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,200
internet

1167
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,599
because any kind of stuff like adverse

1168
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,280
stuff that happens with big pharma

1169
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,200
and you start complaining and you start

1170
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,960
freaking out you either have a guy with

1171
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,480
a black suit show up at your door and

1172
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,480
tell you never to talk about it again

1173
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,839
or you'll just get scrubbed off the

1174
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,280
internet is what really happens in the

1175
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,400
old days it was like somebody with a

1176
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,160
black suit would show up

1177
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,440
make sure you shut the hell up and never

1178
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,599

without their caffeine they can't even

1209
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,599
put

1210
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,880
a sentence together without it because

they're struggling with problems and

1212
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,760
they're not in a place where they can

1213
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,760
fix it so easy right now

1214
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,640
so tell you guys something interesting

1215
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,760
you know when you get blood work

1216
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,160
a couple things i want to tell you about

1217
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,720
blood work okay one is

1218
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,319
ask your doctor okay to not

1219
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,040
when the when you do the blood work

1220
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,520
don't do so many vials of blood that's

1221
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,119
one thing right there

1222
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,119
because they'll just drain the life out

1223
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,480
of you like i've been i've been teaching

1224
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,720
doctors

1225
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,240
two or three vials that's it you get

1226
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,760
another blood test if you want to test

1227
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,680
for other things and you do another two

1228
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,680
or three vials don't do six vials don't

1229
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,800
do five vials don't do seven vials don't

1230
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,280
do 10 vials

1231
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,560
don't do 12 vials don't do 14 don't do

1232
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,200
26 vials

1233
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,720
no yeah guess what some doctors they'll

1234
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,720
pull 26 vials out of people

1235
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,400
um you got to remember this when you're

1236
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,920
getting blood tests and i want to talk

1237
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,440
about this about blood a bunch of

1238
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,280
different stuff about blood

1239
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,040
because i really haven't covered blood

1240
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,319
enough and i want to really cover i'm

1241
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,440
going to cover what i can now but

1242
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,280
there's it's going to probably take a

1243
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,040
couple of cooking sessions

1244
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,240
to cover all the blood stuff right so

1245
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,880
i'm going to give you a couple of pieces

1246
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,800
with it

1247
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,119
i'm making potato nori wraps i'm going

1248
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,000
to cut more potato right here

1249
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,119
okay first of all ask your doctor to

1250
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,119
keep it minimal

1251
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,839
less blood drawn

1252
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,119
if he says well i'm not going to be able

1253
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,640
to test for this and this and this and

1254
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,800
this and this say can you cut it in half

1255
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,839
and test for those another day i come in

1256
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,240
write it up do it

1257
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,440
it's one thing because when you're sick

1258
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,960
and you've got chronic illness and

1259
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,560
you've got any kind of low grade viral

1260
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,880
stuff if you're not well whatever that

1261
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,040
is

1262
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,160
that you're going through the more blood

1263
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,000
taken at once

1264
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,599
you just lost your immune system it's

1265
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,560
gone out the door

1266
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,200
bye gone one shot you're getting your

1267
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,720
blood work

1268
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,040
they're drawing your blood well there's

1269
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,440
one vial boom okay that's okay two vials

1270
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,599
boom

1271
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,800
three vials boom four boom here's your

1272
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,960
immune system your white count

1273
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,839
neutrophils basal cells monocytes your

1274
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,960
lymphocytes all going out that's it so

1275
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,760
your immune system is

1276
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,160
being removed and if you're viral with

1277
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,640
epstein-barr you got ra hashimoto's

1278
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,160
ms you got lupus you got whatever you

1279
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,200
got going on it could be eczema

1280
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,319
psoriasis

1281
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,319
anything reproductive problems then your

1282
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,839
body has to build up and recreate a

1283
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,680
brand new immune system for your

1284
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,599
bloodstream and in that

1285
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,000
moment those bugs streptococcus

1286
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,200
epstein-barr whatever are going to creep

1287
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,319
up they can creep

1288
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,880
up because your immune system was

1289
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:31,119
removed so you want to do minimal

1290
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,079
like okay can i get three vials not six

1291
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,400
or eight

1292
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,760
and then i'll come back and you then

1293
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,720
test for the other things and i'll get

1294
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,720
three more vials

1295
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,599
that's really powerful information get

1296
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,440
two vials

1297
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,119
and the other thing too if you can't go

1298
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,119
that route your doctor's like no i need

1299
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,960
five aisles i need six vials of blood i

1300
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,240
need seven vials of blood

1301
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,400
ask them if you can do half vials of

1302
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,440
blood because guess what the blood

1303
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,960
the the just so you know um when they

1304
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,400
test for blood when they test your blood

1305
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,200
they throw it all away

1306
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,319
they take this much that much out of a

1307
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,240
vial

1308
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,599
that much most of the time and they

1309
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,480
throw away all your blood

1310
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,079
it all gets thrown away okay so it's a

1311
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,560
scam too

1312
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,720
so ask your doctor can you go with half

1313
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,400
vials of blood

1314
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,280
send it to the blood testing place the

1315
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,480
labs with half of them filled

1316
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,000
this way if you do three half vials it's

1317
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,040
only really what

1318
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,960
one and a half if you do five half files

1319
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,240
you're only what two and a half or

1320
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,880
whatever

1321
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:42,560
you guys i'm doing some i hope my math

1322
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:45,520
is right

1323
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,520
never went to college

1324
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:52,720
was too busy helping people heal

1325
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,760
couldn't do it was way too busy had too

1326
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,760
many people knocking on my door

1327
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,839
working on saving lives all these years

1328
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,440
it just didn't have the time to go to

1329
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,720
school didn't have time to go to college

1330
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,680
but i can tell you how to protect

1331
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,319
yourself and

1332
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,720
and give you books that have already

1333
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,200
saved lots of lives you guys i'm making

1334
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,720
the banana nori wraps right here there

1335
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,200
it is medical medium

1336
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,680
revised and expanded new edition find it

1337
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,319
on amazon

1338
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,760
um another thing too with blood testing

1339
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,520
which is interesting so i'm just talking

1340
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,240
about that part let's get some

1341
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,920
dolls right here so i gotta i gotta

1342
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,119
cover some more blood information if you

1343
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
guys are interested you guys get blood

1344
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,040
work all the time

1345
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,839
you guys get blood work so i got a

1346
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,839
little bit more

1347
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,359
okay the labs are lying lizzy lou the

1348
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,800
labs say they can't run the blood work

1349
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:52,800
unless the vials are full

1350
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:55,200
they're lying they can they actually can

1351
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,040
how do i know doctors tell me how do i

1352
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,839
know paint doctors patients

1353
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,400
that i've known through doctors have

1354
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,000
have

1355
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,079
insisted on half files and the labs have

1356
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,520
run it

1357
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,839
so you just have to fight for it a

1358
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,839
little bit

1359
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,480
making a pile of these wow okay so

1360
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,960
another thing too is

1361
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,240
you can get a blood test for something

1362
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,480
like cortisol

1363
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,319
get blood blood tests to check your

1364
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,839
adrenals and cortisol right

1365
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,680
and an hour later it's going to be

1366
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,520
entirely different than when you had it

1367
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,000
tested that moment

1368
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,440
blood tests are so inconsistent that's

1369
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,119
another thing

1370
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:37,280
really interesting about blood tests

1371
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,720
you got to take sometimes a lot of blood

1372
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,240
tests and a lot of different tests with

1373
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,440
the grain of salt

1374
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,280
testing changes constantly within the

1375
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,240
hour within a day if you go to bathroom

1376
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,000
before you

1377
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,119
get your blood test or go to bathroom

1378
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,839
after you get your blood this is

1379
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,839
entirely different

1380
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,200
i will barber says i will ask about half

1381
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,520
files

1382
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,200
definitely ask about half vials because

1383
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,119
if they're taking that much blood

1384
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,040
it gets us sicker and sicker over time

1385
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,119
so let me just let me just be straight

1386
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,200
out about this this is critical to know

1387
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,880
the more blood we get taken and the more

1388
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,359
blood we get taken the more blood we get

1389
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,480
taken

1390
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:17,040
the sicker we get you know i call the

1391
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,480
system the ultimate vampire

1392
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:23,280
they don't do it right they don't

1393
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,920
do it carefully they suck the life out

1394
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,680
of us they

1395
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,480
rob our immune systems with the blood

1396
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,280
tests and they don't they're not careful

1397
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,680
about it

1398
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,359
they're not and people get sicker who

1399
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,200
are viral and chronically ill and they

1400
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,720
get sicker and sicker and sicker because

1401
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,800
of it

1402
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,240
so you want to be careful and ask about

1403
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,119
half files if you can't get the half

1404
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,559
vials

1405
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,640
your doctor doesn't want to do it or

1406
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,960
something's going on there then ask for

1407
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,079
less vials drawn

1408
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,960
and then go back again for other tests

1409
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,040
so it's not

1410
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,680
all those done at once and do another

1411
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,480
potato roll up right here

1412
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,720
and the body is always compensating too

1413
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,559
all the time we've got to remember this

1414
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,760
it's always compensating so the blood

1415
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,119
tests are picking up the body

1416
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,200
compensating all the time

1417
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,640
that's something to keep in mind as well

1418
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,400
you go through a stressful event your

1419
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,800
body's compensating

1420
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,680
it's always doing that your body's if

1421
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,040
you're um

1422
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,119
getting deficient in something your

1423
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,599
body's compensating

1424
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,119
it's always doing that so it's really

1425
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,559
that's something to keep in mind all on

1426
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,119
its own i want to go into that a little

1427
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,680
bit more

1428
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:29,280
too it's interesting

1429
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,360
okay guys putting a little bit more dols

1430
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:35,459
in here rolling up another one

1431
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,459
[Applause]

1432
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,559
educating myself says also explains

1433
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,240
immune lowering

1434
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,400
during menstruation which is medical

1435
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,640
medium information

1436
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,920
i put that out years ago immune system

1437
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,640
lowers during

1438
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,640
menstruation

1439
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:01,599
publish first medical medium books

1440
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:05,359
um yeah it totally explains that

1441
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,880
exactly the amount of medical

1442
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,720
medium information that's gotten out

1443
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,599
there over the years with no science

1444
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,200
behind it

1445
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:15,280
none at all but it becomes law out there

1446
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,880
it's you know and then but you'll hear

1447
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,000
everybody where's your science where's

1448
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,160
your signs where's your science

1449
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,559
so here's how it works too is like your

1450
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,599
body's over compensating constantly for

1451
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,880
everything we do

1452
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,160
that we shouldn't do everything we do

1453
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,200
that we shouldn't do our bodies

1454
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,200
overcompensating

1455
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,800
non-stop right you drink caffeine our

1456
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,200
bodies overcompensating

1457
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,160
right there we challenge our body it

1458
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,160
compensates

1459
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:42,319
okay we do an ice cold plunge

1460
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,079
our bodies freaking out goes into crisis

1461
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,520
and tries to find homeostasis and

1462
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,839
overcompensates

1463
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,960
our body is constantly trying to find

1464
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,520
that homeostasis

1465
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,400
all the time at every moment anywhere

1466
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,640
anyhow

1467
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,480
and and when they take blood they

1468
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,160
they've never accounted for that really

1469
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,520
that our body's constantly trying to

1470
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,880
find a balance

1471
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,040
so when they take blood they don't

1472
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,520
realize it's much deeper than what it

1473
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,200
really is that you read on the results

1474
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,559
too i'm not saying all the results are

1475
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,640
wrong and that's not it

1476
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,680
it's just that our bodies are in it's a

1477
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,760
working process

1478
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,599
every day to overcompensate everything

1479
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,720
we're doing so if we got too much fat in

1480
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,160
our bloodstream our body's

1481
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,800
overcompensating by really

1482
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,960
releasing more adrenaline to thin it out

1483
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,640
um if we're under a lot of stress

1484
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,000
our bodies like over compensating to

1485
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,640
deal with the stress

1486
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,119
and it's just it's this constant tug and

1487
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,520
pull

1488
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,400
tug and pull that's why blood tests are

1489
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,240
not the same

1490
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,960
an hour later it's why blood tests are

1491
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,520
not the same two hours later or a day

1492
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,400
later

1493
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,960
they're different i'm gonna do a banana

1494
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,000
right now

1495
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:47,839
this is the next one i'm gonna do

1496
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,359
so you got to take the average you know

1497
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,720
that's what they really should do they

1498
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,280
should be like i'm going to put a whole

1499
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,040
banana in here like this

1500
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,760
they should take the average of the test

1501
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,000
like hormone test in the morning

1502
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,920
come back the next day in the afternoon

1503
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,520
get another hormone test then

1504
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,680
you get that blood run you get that

1505
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,640
blood run the lab and then what you have

1506
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,480
here is

1507
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,960
you go somewhere you'll see the numbers

1508
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,960
are different

1509
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,800
or you get a blood test in the morning

1510
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,480
one day and then a week later you get a

1511
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,839
blood test in the morning that next day

1512
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,200
and then next a week later and you'll

1513
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,200
see why are the numbers different

1514
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,680
why are the numbers constantly different

1515
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,040
because you might have had a little

1516
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,839
stress in your life maybe you had

1517
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,280
something happen

1518
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,040
maybe something's going on maybe you're

1519
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,960
eating differently maybe you had

1520
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,760
something you shouldn't have eaten

1521
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,839
maybe something like that the body tries

1522
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,680
to compensate

1523
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:46,880
constantly the numbers change your

1524
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:49,760
body's trying to find homeostasis

1525
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,760
and that's how it works

1526
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,359
i made a really big one right here so

1527
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,119
when i cut it in half you'll see i mean

1528
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,400
they become nori wraps when you make

1529
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,280
them bigger and that's what the recipe

1530
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,880
calls for

1531
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,319
it really calls for this so what i'm

1532
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,800
gonna do i'm gonna cut this one in half

1533
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,800
like this

1534
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,720
so that's the nori that's the nori wrap

1535
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,880
there's a full banana in there you got

1536
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,319
the sprouts you got the cilantro

1537
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,079
you got a little bit of the doll

1538
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,280
stripped in there and you got the green

1539
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,680
onion you see

1540
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,800
now i'm going to cut them also small too

1541
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,440
so i'm going to do that as well i'm

1542
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,680
going to cut them

1543
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,559
into little circles like i like to do

1544
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,839
and fill the plate

1545
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,480
fill the plate up and that's where i'm

1546
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,480
going next

1547
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,839
yep

1548
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,119
um you can't test for heavy metals

1549
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,880
through blood work

1550
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,880
because that's not going to work because

1551
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,880
heavy metals sit and saturate inside the

1552
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,920
organ tissue so toxic heavy metals sit

1553
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,440
inside the brain

1554
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,040
they sit inside the glial cells the

1555
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,520
brain tissue they sit

1556
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,280
they sit deep inside the brain so what

1557
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,000
happens is they sit deep inside the

1558
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,559
liver they sit deep inside our organs so

1559
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,160
hey do i have toxic metals or not i

1560
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,280
don't know let me go get a blood test at

1561
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,880
the doctor's office

1562
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,640
and the doctor the doctor might be like

1563
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,160
hey you got little traces of it but i

1564
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,640
don't think you have it bad

1565
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,240
those traces in your bloodstream are

1566
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,839
from new exposure

1567
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:18,000
brand new exposure toxic heavy metals

1568
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,880
old exposure sit inside your brain

1569
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,960
forever

1570
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,559
but new exposure on a daily level will

1571
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:26,400
show up on the blood test and it might

1572
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,400
not even be perfect on that level too

1573
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,160
carmen says i have too much calcium in

1574
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,000
my blood

1575
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:36,160
what can i do i mean first of all

1576
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,680
if first of all i would i would

1577
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,119
definitely start shifting things with

1578
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,760
your diet if you have too much calcium

1579
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,160
in your blood

1580
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,520
so it starts shifting things there um

1581
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,599
start cleaning things up

1582
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,880
are you doing any eggs get rid of those

1583
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,559
eggs you can ask your doctor about that

1584
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,839
see what's right for you but i i would

1585
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,119
if that was me and i had too much

1586
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,880
calcium in my blood

1587
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,160
i would be getting rid of eggs that

1588
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,880
would be something i would do right

1589
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,040
there

1590
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,040
guys i'm going to take two nori's

1591
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,160
together and cut them

1592
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,599
in pieces i would get rid of eggs i

1593
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,440
would get rid of dairy products

1594
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,799
i would keep the caffeine and chocolate

1595
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,240
out because here's what what happens

1596
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:10,480
when you do coffee

1597
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,760
it sucks the calcium out of your bones

1598
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,359
and therefore you end up with the

1599
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,160
calcium in your blood

1600
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,640
so when you do caffeine of any kind it's

1601
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,160
the

1602
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:25,040
caffeine caffeine that draws the calcium

1603
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:26,960
out of your bones to act as a buffer

1604
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,880
right same thing with apple cider

1605
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,880
vinegar apple cider vinegar

1606
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,160
pulls it pulls calcium out of your teeth

1607
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,920
out of your bones

1608
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,839
same thing with any kind of vinegar it

1609
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,760
pulls calcium out of your bones

1610
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,520
get rid of all the vinegars gone get rid

1611
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,440
of all your caffeine gone

1612
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,799
get rid of the eggs the dairy products

1613
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,440
gone and then

1614
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,880
give it a little time and then see what

1615
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,760
happens there i mean that's what i would

1616
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,160
do if it was me

1617
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,960
i'm cutting these right here cutting two

1618
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:57,119
at a time like this

1619
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,079
you can make these thick and bigger

1620
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,440
pieces

1621
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,440
you can make them skinny

1622
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,960
i'll show you guys i'll plate them up

1623
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,839
hair test for metals don't work either

1624
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,839
keep that in mind as well

1625
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,400
those are not great indicators either

1626
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:23,839
so that's something to know there

1627
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,839
so i'm going to plate these up here

1628
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,920
i'm going to do a bunch of them in these

1629
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:32,799
plates i like doing these little

1630
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,799
circles like this so

1631
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,839
so that's something also to keep in mind

1632
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,839
there that hair testing isn't

1633
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,839
isn't a great indicator as well

1634
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,940
i'm noticing something is i get it

1635
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,240
everybody wants to be spiritual

1636
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:51,280
[Music]

1637
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:54,240
these days but how come if

1638
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,040
how can we want well how come scientific

1639
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,599
studies are so

1640
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,599
important

1641
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:03,839
if we're so spiritual why do we need a

1642
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,799
scientific study so bad

1643
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:08,559
in order to drink celery juice or in

1644
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:11,440
order to

1645
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,040
do something that's healing somebody

1646
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,520
like what we're doing here

1647
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,319
like why do you need you know a

1648
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,440
scientific

1649
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:21,119
study where's your science on that

1650
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,079
information anthony where is it

1651
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:27,440
okay well that's funny because i thought

1652
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,440
you were a spiritual person

1653
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,799
everybody's acting so spiritual i've

1654
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,680
seen people in yoga studios a friend of

1655
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,160
mine told me

1656
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,680
a whole bunch of people in his yoga

1657
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,119
studio

1658
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,119
is before the whole thing happened

1659
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,640
recently with the plague we've been

1660
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,520
dealing with

1661
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,640
he said there's like they're really

1662
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,640
spiritual people

1663
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,960
but for some reason they need a

1664
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,280
scientific study

1665
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,839
on everything like anything my friend

1666
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,920
said to them in the yoga studio

1667
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:00,079
anything my friend said he's a doctor

1668
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:05,119
friend he said you know medical medium

1669
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:07,440
says that um you know

1670
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,359
when you when when you have your cycle

1671
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,799
your immune system drops eighty percent

1672
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,880
of your immune system goes to your

1673
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,799
reproductive system while 20 percent

1674
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,720
is left to fend for you on everywhere

1675
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,240
else and they go where's the scientific

1676
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,880
study on that and these are people that

1677
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,760
are super spiritual he said

1678
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,760
super spiritual

1679
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:32,000
and he's like this is confusing why is

1680
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,040
everybody

1681
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,040
so spiritual

1682
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,960
but yet they they won't do they won't do

1683
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,880
anything

1684
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,640
unless science involved in some way or

1685
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,640
they think science is involved in some

1686
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:51,680
way

1687
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,680
is it hypocritical what is that

1688
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:01,119
especially since many of the people in

1689
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,520
the yoga studio had chronic illness

1690
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,599
like autoimmune and science and research

1691
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,040
hasn't fixed it and no scientific study

1692
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:10,400
fixed it

1693
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,280
and there they are doing yoga and they

1694
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,079
got

1695
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,079
a little bit of fatigue they got some

1696
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,640
hashimoto's and they're they're they're

1697
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:21,599
at the yoga center doing yoga

1698
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,680
and science and research studies hasn't

1699
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,160
fixed their hashimoto's on any level

1700
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,359
but for some reason they need a study in

1701
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,000
order to do something when they're

1702
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:31,280
supposed to be so

1703
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,520
spiritual there's the norris

1704
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,640
right there i cut them in little pieces

1705
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,640
i'm gonna cut some more next

1706
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:45,280
uh

1707
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,680
another thing too is everybody thinks

1708
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,960
they're a health expert

1709
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,359
i don't mind if they think they're a

1710
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,880
health expert that's fine but

1711
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:56,559
stop burning all that toxic incense

1712
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,720
that's poisoning the people around you

1713
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,680
or your family stop burning the scented

1714
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,280
candles

1715
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,760
with all the chemical company toxins in

1716
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,599
it

1717
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:11,440
they're killing people and

1718
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:14,720
if you want to be a health expert

1719
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,359
and a spiritual expert i just i would

1720
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,640
suggest

1721
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:20,400
maybe kind of like i don't know getting

1722
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,760
in touch with what you're doing a little

1723
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,559
bit

1724
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,319
maybe don't burn those dangerous scented

1725
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,520
candles

1726
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:38,079
poisoning yourself poisoning your lungs

1727
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:41,599
breaking down your immune system

1728
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:42,559
one's a no-brainer maybe those chemicals

1729
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,000
are dangerous

1730
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,000
and if you have children i mean you

1731
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,720
shouldn't be burning scented candles

1732
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,799
if you have children and you look i'm

1733
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,200
not look not judging anybody it's just

1734
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,839
that

1735
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,440
i want to help people because when you

1736
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,319
learn these things you're like okay wait

1737
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,640
a minute

1738
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:03,280
okay whoa yeah i need to be on that

1739
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,319
same thing with perfumes and clothes

1740
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,839
this stuff is so

1741
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:09,760
toxic they're chemical soups

1742
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:11,359
and they they go into the sinuses and

1743
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,839
they stick to the sinus

1744
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:15,280
cavities and they actually find their

1745
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:17,119
way into the brain

1746
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,559
through the sinus cavities scented

1747
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,240
candles the chemicals that send to

1748
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,799
candles find their way

1749
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,359
into your brain through your sinus

1750
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,359
cavities

1751
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,480
see a lot of health gurus these days

1752
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,359
lighting their scented candles

1753
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,839
and burning incense that's treated with

1754
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,839
chemicals

1755
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,880
and they're telling everybody this is

1756
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,160
what you need to do you need to do this

1757
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,240
you need to do that

1758
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,520
you need to sit in your sauna for an

1759
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:47,520
hour with the highest heat

1760
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,119
until you go into hypothermia basically

1761
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,559
and your adrenals then spill out a

1762
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,720
lifetime of adrenaline and then you're

1763
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:54,079
high afterwards

1764
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,599
and then years down the road you get

1765
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,440
broken down from it and everything

1766
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,880
starts falling apart and nobody knows it

1767
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,200
was from doing too hot

1768
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,799
too hot and too long saunas and then

1769
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,559
caffeine all day make sure you do your

1770
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:06,319
plant medicine chocolate

1771
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,920
all the health gurus are like do your

1772
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,440
plant medicine chocolate make sure you

1773
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:17,520
do it make sure you get lots of it so

1774
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:20,319
good for you science says

1775
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:23,039
and how can you really be spiritual if

1776
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:27,440
you need vices

1777
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:29,039
look a lot of people need vices to

1778
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,079
survive and get through the day

1779
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:33,599
never going to judge anybody on that i

1780
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:37,119
know life isn't easy

1781
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:40,319
life can be really hard really difficult

1782
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:42,400
but but just

1783
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:43,440
you know try to realize there's a lot of

1784
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,400
people out there

1785
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,000
that got it real easy real easy it's a

1786
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,760
lot of people you guys out there got it

1787
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,480
easy everything's paid for everything's

1788
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,359
good

1789
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:56,160
maybe they came for money fine not

1790
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,160
faulting anybody

1791
01:03:56,839 --> 01:04:01,520
but

1792
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,039
whatever they've never had a difficult

1793
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,319
challenge yet maybe they're still

1794
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,160
young and they haven't been faced with

1795
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:09,039
any difficult challenges

1796
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:11,280
but what's their excuse for holding on

1797
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,920
to all their vices

1798
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,960
and but claiming they're spiritual at

1799
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,880
the same time

1800
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:21,119
look i don't mind if you do that

1801
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,039
it's just that to grow sometimes we have

1802
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,200
to let go of some things we have to be

1803
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,480
without sometimes sometimes we have to

1804
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,760
be without

1805
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:32,799
a vice one that's hurting us

1806
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:35,200
you know how spiritually connected can

1807
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:37,200
we get if we're so jacked up on a drug

1808
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,200
that the caffeine industry

1809
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,559
wants us on for the rest of our life so

1810
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,799
they get rich they don't care what

1811
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,720
happens to us

1812
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:48,240
spiritual growth is about being without

1813
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:49,599
sometimes maybe letting go of ice

1814
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,359
and then you wonder down the road while

1815
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,799
your body's falling apart no one's going

1816
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,880
to tell you no one's going to say it was

1817
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:56,720
all that caffeine all these years

1818
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,559
you guys i've been on the caffeine rant

1819
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:04,880
for a long time but i have to say

1820
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:07,280
it's the biggest food group

1821
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,039
caffeine is the biggest food group it's

1822
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,839
the food group

1823
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,920
95 of the world is on for the rest of

1824
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:16,240
their lives

1825
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,480
if they were to do the math it's the

1826
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,160
number one at the top of their food

1827
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,240
chain it's at the top of their food

1828
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,119
group the number one food group their

1829
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,880
whole life

1830
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,799
and when you think about how scary that

1831
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,880
is oh my god

1832
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:30,640
bananas aren't at the number one food

1833
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,480
group there for them

1834
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:36,079
bananas is that at the number one fruit

1835
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,760
group no it's not

1836
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,599
and but the caffeine will never get the

1837
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,240
blame ever ever ever ever

1838
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,920
right mp i mean isn't that true it's the

1839
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,960
number one food group it's like okay

1840
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,280
what's your food group

1841
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,720
is it grains is your food group fruits

1842
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,640
is it vegetables

1843
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,160
what's your food group is it something

1844
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,880
