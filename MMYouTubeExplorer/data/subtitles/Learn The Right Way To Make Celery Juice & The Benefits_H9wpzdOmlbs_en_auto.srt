happens when you're eating

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,560
all of your pork all these years you had

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,360

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,960
it's still inside of you it's still

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,240
inside of you

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,479
it is it hasn't left right

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,000
you carry it around inside of you even

39
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,759
if you're in shape or you think you're

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
in shape you're working out you've got

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,520
some

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,280
abs you still got the pork inside of you

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,360

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,680
bacon fat

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,079
and bacon grease out of you and that's

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,040
one thing celery juice helps us do is it

48
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,280

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,119
fat sit

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,759
sits inside the liver you can be you can

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,680
be some

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,159
some dude you could be in the gym you

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,799

you

57
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
and it sits there it sits on the inside

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,479
lining of the intestinal tract inside

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,560
the lining of the colon that's where it

60
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,040
sits

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
and it just breaks our system down i've

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,319

falling apart and everything just starts

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,040

102
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,239

why like who's doing celery juice well

109
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,920
everybody is because they keep on

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480

111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,599

119
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,319

it really is it i'll tell you what the

122
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,239
juicer has done for me if you guys want

123
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,560
to know

124
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,759
all right so what would i let me just

125
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,840
give you some history okay

126
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
i've tried all the juicers out there all

127
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,479
the cold-pressed juicers out there

128
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,880
all right um nicole says so this juicer

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,520
does

130
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,600
juice other items yes it does not just

131
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,280
celery yes it juices other items

132
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
and what i find is to juice other items

133
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,639
better because

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
it has the ability to squeeze every last

135
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,440
drop out of them and that's what i love

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,320
about the juicer

137
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,360
um this this model is made specifically

138
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,759
for celery

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
and you can use it for anything what i

140
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,639
find is i use it for everything and i'm

141
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,120
happier with that

142
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
than other juicers i've tried all the

143
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
all the juicers out there i'm just

144
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,199
letting you know

145
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,639
and i'll tell you a little history about

146
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,080
it okay

147
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,759
and you guys could get any juicer you

148
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
want look you guys can use any juicer

149
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,919
you want

150
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,759
it's just that everybody's always asking

151
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,360
me and i hold it off for a while and i

152
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,639
hold it on for a while i hold it up for

153
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,919
a while and then it finally just like

154
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,639
all right all right this is the one i

155
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,919
use

156
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,720
and but like a little history about it

157
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,039
for me right

158
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880
tried every juicer i don't care what

159
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
juicer somebody throws out at me like

160
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
did you do this one did you do that one

161
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,400
did you do this one i tried them all

162
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,440
okay and they

163
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
haven't saved me money i buy a lot of

164
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,840
celery

165
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,280
like i buy a lot of celery you know and

166
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,240
i got a lot of celery right here and

167
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,919
you know it costs money absolutely but

168
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,960
when you squeeze

169
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:42,479
that juice out of your celery

170
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,800
like squeeze more of it out of it

171
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
you're saving money so then when i got

172
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,880
this juicer

173
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,880
i was buying less less celery than

174
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,800
buying less celery than buying less

175
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,479
but wait a minute i was still drinking

176
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
the same amount of juice

177
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,479
and so i was seeing where it was saving

178
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
me money so then what this juicer did

179
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,280
which the other juicers never did for me

180
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,759
is this juicer paid for itself you guys

181
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,759
on clubhouse it paid for itself

182
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,240
that's what it did and i'm like wait a

183
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,720
minute so this juicer paid for itself

184
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,759
and then paid for itself again and then

185
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,120
i noticed

186
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,560
it paid for itself again okay

187
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,440
now as i as i calculated that it was

188
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
really awesome

189
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
nazil says it was a life changer when i

190
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,479
switched to this

191
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,319
juicer the mm-900 hds and

192
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,560
don't get it confused with other ones i

193
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,199
used to get two cups of celery juice

194
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,080
out of two bags of celery now from one

195
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,759
bag

196
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,720
i make two cups of cj and you guys

197
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,560
that's that's for real that's what i've

198
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,680
been trying to tell everybody about like

199
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
all the time

200
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,960
that's what i'm like i tell my friends

201
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,080
that well what's the difference between

202
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
this juicer i'm like what are you

203
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,759
kidding

204
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,080
um hazel said i started with a different

205
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,400
juicer and it soaked me dry with

206
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,280
money and not enough juice i love the

207
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,759
omega juicer the mm-900 gives me more

208
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,160
juice

209
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,199
and it pays for itself it pays for

210
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,280
itself

211
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,599
so check this out right now having a

212
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,960
juicer pay for itself is one thing

213
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,800
right and that's what this juicer did

214
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,919
when no other juicer did that for me

215
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,000
but it paid for itself again right and

216
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,680
then it paid for itself again

217
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,520
and then again because i did the

218
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
calculations for how much money i spent

219
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,759
on celery

220
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,800
it turned out that the m m 900

221
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,000
paid for itself a dozen times for me

222
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,759
so it's like wait a minute just got

223
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
another juicer well just got another

224
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
juicer

225
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
wait it paid for itself again it paid

226
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,840
for itself again

227
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,280
and i i couldn't believe it so i'm just

228
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,479
letting you know how it works for me

229
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,120
and i'm excited about it um so it's the

230
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,400
mm-900 hds just so you guys know okay

231
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,160
omega juicers.com that's where you go

232
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,759
and we'll talk about some juice you know

233
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,759
we'll talk about some celery juice so

234
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,599
you go to megajuicers.com

235
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,000
right now make sure it's the mm900 hds

236
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,319
or you just

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
end up with the wrong juicer you'll end

238
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,879
up with the wrong juicer

239
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,039
you'll end up with an omega juicer but

240
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,479
the wrong one just letting you know

241
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,280
so you guys we're live on tick tock

242
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,800
right now

243
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,360
[Music]

244
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
good to see you guys i'm juicing some

245
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,599
celery

246
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
you know last time i did this i didn't

247
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,360
have the container underneath right

248
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,199
you guys remember that and it just was

249
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,319
pouring all over the counter

250
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,560
cutting board don't add anything to your

251
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,280
celery juice

252
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,280
you guys i see it every day out there

253
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,719
i'm putting ice in my celery

254
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,640
i'm adding lemon right someone will be

255
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,479
on the internet who like i added lemon

256
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,839
make sure you add lemon

257
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,159
yeah you just destroyed your celery

258
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,680
juice

259
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,279
you just ruined your celery juice

260
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,440
you ruined it i'm not talking about the

261
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,080
flavor i'm talking about

262
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,240
you ruin this opportunity to really do

263
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
what what it needs to do for you and i'm

264
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,800
going to give you a rundown on how that

265
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,440
works

266
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,600
mc good to see you emcee on youtube

267
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
right

268
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,680
um mc says keep the juice raw

269
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,279
yeah you of course you want to keep it

270
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,480
raw you don't want to cook your celery

271
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,399
juice

272
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,800
um good to see you guys coming on

273
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,800
everybody

274
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,200
you guys there's some you you might get

275
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,560
build up but you get filled up with

276
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,640
every single juicer

277
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,560
so you get build up from your fruits and

278
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,959
vegetables you're juicing

279
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
you get build up i use a little bonnie

280
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,240
and amy that's what i do put a little

281
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
bonnie on me on the sponge

282
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,920
i said yeah i got right underneath my

283
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,279
sink right here and i i get that

284
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,160
i get that build up owl is what i do

285
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,920
so i'm doing a little juicing right now

286
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,320
obviously let's run some celery sticks

287
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
through here

288
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,360
um can you juice the leaves can you

289
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,959
juice without the leaves they make it

290
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,920
taste horrible of course you can cut the

291
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,360
leaves off

292
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,200
there's nothing wrong with cutting the

293
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,279
leaves back

294
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:05,200
uh that's fine you could cut them back

295
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:06,640
as much as you want you guys

296
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,040
i'm just reading your comments can you

297
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,560
add a little ice susan says can you add

298
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,839
a little ice

299
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,240
no you can't you can't add ice

300
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,519
you can't add water you can't add

301
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,360
supplements

302
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,000
you can't add you know

303
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,399
anything because if you add something to

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,760
it

305
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,519
you dilute the sodium cluster sauce

306
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,959
sodium cluster salt i'm going to show

307
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,560
you guys a little bit about really quick

308
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,320
okay i'm just gonna shut this down for a

309
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,680
second right

310
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,760
so here's how it works okay

311
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,440
let's get this off here this cap um

312
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,440
you guys see this right here all right

313
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,760
i'm holding up a white board right here

314
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,839
okay sodium cluster salts okay

315
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,920
that's your macro sodium right there

316
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,680
okay that's in celery

317
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,240
that's your macro that's your macro

318
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,480
sodium you're looking at it right there

319
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,279
okay now here's the difference with

320
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,680
celery

321
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,959
this is why people heal all around the

322
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
world i'm going to give you guys a

323
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,560
rundown

324
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,480
okay it's not what science research says

325
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,399
where oh there's sodium there's this

326
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,800
much sodium in celery

327
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,600
we calculated how much sodium is in

328
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,399
celery

329
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,120
okay that's what they say right there's

330
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,320
sodium

331
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,600
you know yeah true right what no one

332
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
understands

333
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,680
okay is that there's a subgroup of

334
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,519
sodium in celery

335
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,519
how come it's not discovered yet why

336
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,519
should they discover it

337
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
first of all the industries want us sick

338
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,000
they want us dying

339
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,440
they want us buying drugs right they

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
want us buying pharmaceuticals they want

341
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,640
us buying

342
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,240
you know medications right they want to

343
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,920
keep us sick right the industry does

344
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,320
because if you get better then everybody

345
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,680
go

346
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,360
in the industries they lose all their

347
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,160
money okay so

348
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,880
who's going to pay 50 million dollars

349
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
100 million

350
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,519
who's going to pay 200 million dollars

351
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,079
for a whole team of scientists to

352
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,680
actually

353
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,240
find the subgroup of sodium who's going

354
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,639
to pay for that do you ask like

355
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,120
think about that ask yourself who's

356
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,600
gonna come up with 200 million dollars

357
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,920
put a team together just so they can

358
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,320
prove anthony william right

359
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,320
and then more people around the world

360
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,880
heal does that make sense to you

361
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,600
is that doesn't make any sense so here

362
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,079
it goes okay

363
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,480
the macro that's the macro sodium inside

364
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:22,240
celery so inside your sodium inside your

365
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,399
celery stick okay and

366
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,320
around it is like it's like a solar

367
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,399
system around the sun

368
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,720
right so when you

369
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,920
dehydrate your celery into a powder

370
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,440
you lose the solar system you guys you

371
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,120
lost the subgroup of

372
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,200
the sodium cluster salts the subgroup

373
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,320
sodium you lost it

374
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,760
bye-bye now it can't heal you now it

375
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,040
can't help you

376
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,320
right this gets suspended in a living

377
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,440
solution

378
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,959
that when you squeeze that celery

379
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,800
stick you get the subgroup the sub

380
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,800
um you get the subgroup of sodium

381
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,839
which is that solar system around the

382
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,399
macro

383
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,240
sodium that's what you get these are

384
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,200
trace minerals

385
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,240
designed by planet earth by mother

386
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,519
nature

387
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,800
the miracle of mother nature these are

388
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,320
trace minerals that are

389
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,440
only bonded in a living solution

390
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,639
around the macro sodium

391
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,560
letting you know you add water to it you

392
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,040
just disturbed and diluted it

393
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,320
you add lemon to it you just dilute it

394
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,839
that solar system that's around okay

395
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,920
that's subgroup of sodium that's around

396
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,720
the sodium the macro sodium you just

397
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,560
disturbed it

398
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
you add another vegetable in there

399
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,240
another fruit you destroyed it

400
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
it doesn't mean you can't eat celery it

401
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,519
doesn't mean you can't have celery in a

402
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,399
juice you can put celery in a juice with

403
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,880
other things

404
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,440
it's still good for you but you won't be

405
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,279
able to

406
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,600
access that miracle that subgroup

407
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,839
of sodium you won't be able to access

408
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,519
the sodium cluster salts

409
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,279
which is the trace minerals that are

410
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,320
designed specifically

411
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,880
to be swimming around in a circle like a

412
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,600
solar system around the macro sodium

413
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,199
you won't be able to actually have that

414
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,000
you won't be eligible

415
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,600
to heal through celery juice if you

416
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,639
destroy that

417
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,120
okay in science research they want to

418
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,600
just they

419
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,600
just want to keep everything dumbed down

420
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,440
oh there's a little bit of this in there

421
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,760
there's a little bit of potassium in

422
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,399
celery there's a little bit of this oh

423
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,440
a little touch of vitamin c but no one's

424
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,360
going to take 200 million dollars

425
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,040
assemble a massive group of scientists

426
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,800
to start fishing for something they

427
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,160
don't know is there and that's why it

428
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,760
takes so much

429
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,519
it just you can't just wake up one

430
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,079
morning be a scientist and then

431
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,199
look look into a scope and find

432
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,199
something when you don't know where it

433
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,199
is it takes decades for them to find

434
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,120
simple things and no one's gonna do that

435
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,399
and so because first of all because then

436
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,399
it'll be like whoa

437
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,680
celery actually can help you heal

438
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,360
because it's already healing millions

439
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,240
worldwide but everybody wants to ignore

440
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,680
that

441
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,120
the media doesn't care anymore it

442
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,240
doesn't matter how many people get their

443
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
lives back like get

444
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,240
literally their lives back and people

445
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,399
just ignore it right

446
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,240
but it's that subgroup of sodium right

447
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,000
there the sodium cluster salts

448
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,760
these are the trace minerals that are

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,959
bonded in a solution

450
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,720
okay of living fluid it suspends them

451
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,240
around that macro sodium that's how it

452
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
works right there you guys

453
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,560
um giving you kind of a little rundown

454
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,560
on that

455
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,839
how long does it take celery juice to

456
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,079
help a chronic fatigue syndrome

457
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:45,360
it's a healing tool right

458
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,480
so it all depends learning about

459
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,800
what your chronic fatigue is matters so

460
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,800
you

461
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,240
learn about what your cfs says right

462
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
that's critical right there so i'm

463
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,399
holding the medical meeting new edition

464
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,760
which is the book of all books about cfs

465
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,519
okay and

466
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,920
[Music]

467
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,560
when you learn what's causing it then

468
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,440
you'll realize

469
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,800
look i may have an epstein-barr virus dr

470
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,720
faun good to see you md

471
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,160
i may have an epstein-barr virus in me

472
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,480
if i got cfs

473
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,630
i may have two epstein-barr viruses in

474
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,839
me if i have cfs you see how it works

475
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,190
[Music]

476
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,930
okay

477
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,160
[Applause]

478
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:29,199
[Music]

479
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,199
so once you learn that you know why

480
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,759
you're using celery juice you're using

481
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,959
it

482
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,959
to help destroy epstein-barr because it

483
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,720
breaks down the membrane on the virus so

484
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,959
we're gonna go there and it also depends

485
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,360
what what else are you doing

486
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,959
celery juice is one of the tools i've

487
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,560
seen people get rid of fatigue

488
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,759
with celery juice yeah i've also seen

489
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,920
other people

490
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,880
move the needle but they need to do

491
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,880
other things too

492
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,519
celery juice fixes some people like that

493
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,560
you see it every day out there okay

494
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,799
other people

495
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
it's moving the needle to get them there

496
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,799
to the finish line

497
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,670
right so that's important to know how

498
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,360
that works

499
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:14,640
[Music]

500
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,199
antivirals are important you may need

501
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,760
additional anti-virals i talk about that

502
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,959
in the medical medium new edition

503
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,839
right so what what i here's how i look

504
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,960
at a juicer

505
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,960
i look at a juicer as a medical device

506
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,799
that's how i see a juicer okay now

507
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,160
i see it as a medical tool bottom line

508
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,160
that's how i look at it

509
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:50,559
every day

510
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,360
because what is it what is a juicer

511
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,600
why are you juicing the juicing for the

512
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,200
fun of it

513
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,280
right why bother juicing just eat pizza

514
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,559
why bother juicing just eat cheese and

515
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,520
pork

516
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,840
just eat fried eggs every day why why

517
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,120
bother juicing

518
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,720
when you think about it um

519
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,160
you're juicing because you're you're

520
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
trying to save your butt or you're

521
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,400
juicing to try to fix something or

522
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,559
you're juicing to try to heal something

523
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,919
it's like oh let me go out and buy a

524
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,640
juicer

525
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,559
just for the fun of it let me go spend

526
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,320
the money buy a juicer i feel great

527
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,960
living my life but let me get a juicer

528
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,200
anyway

529
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,480
right so when you guys think about it

530
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,080
it's it's

531
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,840
you know we're we're getting a juicer

532
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,000
because something's wrong like

533
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,120
we're not feeling good or we're trying

534
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,880
to find an answer

535
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,520
to healing or we're trying to improve

536
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,480
our health because something's not right

537
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,120
and so what is a juicer it's a medical

538
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,960
tool

539
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,400
that's what it is it's a health tool

540
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,679
it's a medical tool i see it as a

541
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,120
medical device

542
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
if you guys just got on this is the

543
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
mm-900 hds

544
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,640
incredible sale i haven't seen a sale

545
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,039
like this from omegajuicers.com

546
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:06,240
it's 25 off 82

547
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,799
off this juicer this is the

548
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,080
celery model but it does everything else

549
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,000
too that's what i love it was telling

550
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,520
everybody earlier how it paid for itself

551
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,880
over and over again it just didn't pay

552
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
for itself once and someone else said

553
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,840
that i think two people said that

554
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,039
um i saw the in the comments and it just

555
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,600
doesn't pay for itself

556
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,679
once it's paid for itself a dozen times

557
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,320
for me i buy so much celery

558
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,919
and and it's just it's such a great it's

559
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,520
such a great tool so i just did some

560
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,960
juicing just now you guys let me just

561
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,080
move this towel right here

562
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,440
so in in this in this bowl here

563
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,840
i have extremely audra says great juicer

564
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,799
thank you i'm so glad you like it i feel

565
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,520
the same way

566
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,240
i have this thing a pulp in my hand

567
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,360
right

568
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,880
and i show this every time that pulp is

569
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,400
dry

570
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,720
it's dry i mean i've had the wettest

571
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,919
pulp from all the other juicers spitting

572
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,919
out wet pulp

573
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,039
you name it i've seen it all out there

574
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,400
right and

575
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,200
this is nice and dry that's it this is a

576
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,240
pulp

577
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,520
and this is very fibrous celery i'm

578
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,720
dealing with

579
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,280
this is extremely fibrous so

580
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,640
if it was another batch of celery there

581
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,159
would probably be

582
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,480
this much in there only right

583
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,200
this is extremely fibrous celery so

584
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,120
because some

585
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,679
some celery um bunches batches

586
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,240
it's just basically all fiber right so

587
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,600
it takes

588
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,360
it's you know it takes a lot to squeeze

589
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,440
that juice out and that's what i love

590
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,679
about the juicer it's all dry

591
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,960
and that's where the money is at the

592
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,799
money's at

593
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,400
how dry the pulp is that's where the

594
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,400
money's at cold white spring says

595
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,760
i just got the juicer it's great so glad

596
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,440
you got it

597
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,600
incredible it's the mm900 hds

598
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,840
uh john says that's really true it pays

599
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,280
for itself totally worth so glad

600
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,640
got that in the beginning and what i

601
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,760
like about it's easy to clean the other

602
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,440
thing to you guys

603
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,720
is it's quiet i can juice at five

604
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,360
o'clock in the morning i'm not waking up

605
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,760
the house

606
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,200
and falcon says how long is juice good

607
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,000
for how long will that container last

608
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
uh you and does it get degraded over

609
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,240
days

610
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,240
of course anything you know you juice

611
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,679
you want to drink right away if you can

612
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,039
you want to drink

613
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,919
quickly if you can 24 hours is kind of

614
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,520
the limit

615
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,520
but yeah of course you can drink your

616
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,840
celery juice in two days it'll still

617
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,280
have

618
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,400
power it'll still have its healing

619
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,760
sodium cluster salts right it'll still

620
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,679
have these but when you go

621
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,960
too many days when you go too many days

622
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,080
that subgroup of sodium right that's

623
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,200
circulating the macro

624
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,559
mineral sodium right that sub subgroup

625
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,480
sodium of sodium

626
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,159
that starts to weaken after a couple of

627
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
days in the fridge so then your celery

628
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,960
juice is getting kind of old

629
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,880
which brings me to the next thing

630
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,320
which is hpp hpp

631
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,799
is not good for me remember those words

632
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,480
that's basically the slogan it should be

633
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,799
is hpp

634
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,840
is not good for me and that's something

635
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,080
that people need to know

636
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,600
hpp is high pressure pasteurization so

637
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,799
you walk into the store you think you're

638
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,039
getting your celery juice

639
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,919
you're getting it out of a that was

640
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,240
bottled

641
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,280
and that stuff is dead it'll they're

642
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,480
allowed to say

643
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,159
raw or fresh because

644
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,640
they're using a non-heated

645
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,200
pasteurization

646
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,440
but still it destroys the sodium cluster

647
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,360
salts it still denatures

648
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,559
the very thing your celery juice is

649
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,000
trying to help you with

650
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,440
so you'll see somebody out there i tried

651
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,640
celery juice it's not helping me i

652
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,960
didn't find any

653
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,280
i didn't find any way it helped me i

654
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,600
tried some celery juice that didn't work

655
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,039
it's like you've been drinking hpp off

656
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,640
the shelf every day

657
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,320
if you go to a juice bar and they juice

658
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,799
it fresh in front of you that's the

659
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,360
fresh

660
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,039
juice that's the fresh juice you guys

661
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,520
that's it right there

662
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,480
and if you juice it at home like this

663
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,520
that's the fresh

664
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,720
juice keep that in mind hpp

665
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,679
does not work you can't get the healing

666
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,520
you need

667
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,000
from the hpp high pressure

668
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,159
pasteurization it's a trick out too

669
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,600
total trick out going to the store it's

670
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,600
in the cold section

671
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,280
it's sitting there on the shelf you go

672
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
and grab it you think you got something

673
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,120
good you go buy it you're drinking it

674
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,080
the stuff is already bad it's gone bad

675
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,480
gone bad in the sense that not rance it

676
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,520
but

677
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,360
it's been changed it's not like you

678
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,840
think it really is because that high

679
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,520
pressure pasteurization is experimental

680
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,360
and it collapses cell structures

681
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,720
of the juice that's what high pressure

682
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,080
pasteurization

683
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,679
pasteurization does it collapses

684
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,600
cell structures so what happens is

685
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,880
celery juice is something that is so

686
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,039
powerful inside the body

687
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,120
helps us so much inside the body but

688
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,799
it's got to be intact to do it and

689
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,320
that's one of the keys right there

690
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,799
so this is important now i'm gonna i'm

691
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:08,320
gonna pop it in here real quick

692
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,320
um do a little

693
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:21,360
fill this glass jar so i got one celery

694
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,600
juice right there

695
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,440
which i'm excited about so you want to

696
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,720
strain it you see how i got a strainer

697
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,559
you guys

698
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,720
yeah you can let this really sit and

699
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,720
then completely drip out

700
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,400
and then you can press it with a spoon

701
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,159
too and get every single

702
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,559
last drop out i love having control over

703
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,080
you know over the celery juice you don't

704
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,159
have control over it with these other

705
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,520
juicers too it's like the stuff spitting

706
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,200
spatting out anywhere

707
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,880
and when it's a juicers where it's cold

708
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,480
press there's

709
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,120
metal gears inside of some of them

710
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,240
metals going against itself so here's

711
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,039
something that's really important

712
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,520
someone says

713
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,080
oh well you know he's just trying to

714
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,120
sell his

715
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,880
juicer so uh you know i've seen some

716
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,200
really good users out there and

717
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,799
and the whole bit in the vegan community

718
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
and anywhere else and

719
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,799
you know he's just he's just hooked on

720
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,880
to a mega and that's his brand right

721
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,240
well that's funny because with some of

722
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,400
those juicers you guys

723
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,880
there's metal gears metal gears

724
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,840
do you guys know what that means right

725
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,480
metal on

726
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:32,320
metal think about it metal on metal

727
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,840
what does that mean where's over time

728
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,360
right you use that juicer for five years

729
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,159
and those metal gears are banged up

730
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,919
all that metal went inside of you it

731
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,200
went into your juice

732
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,120
so i'm just going to sit there and

733
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,640
collect more metal over the years and

734
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,080
more metal

735
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,919
i don't have to worry about this with

736
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,600
this machine so

737
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,360
and and i was at a friend's house and

738
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,159
they were making me juice and they had a

739
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,760
good juicer

740
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,880
they did but it was the metal gears

741
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,880
right the metal gears and i was like

742
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,200
uh looks like i'm getting a dose of

743
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,080
metal today in my juice even though it's

744
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,640
so my new

745
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,840
in the moment it adds up over time and i

746
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,279
was telling my friends you know

747
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,840
how long you had that t-shirt like i had

748
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,600
this juicer for three years you know

749
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,880
and the parts broke down once in a while

750
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,480
and i've ordered some more parts and

751
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,679
i've gotten it whatever and happens to

752
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,279
every juicer like that

753
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,039
and it's like it's like they're like

754
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,559
okay but you know that that the metal

755
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,120
gears

756
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,039
they're they're they're grinding into

757
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,039
each other to make your juice

758
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,720
you know what that means right oh yeah i

759
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,080
guess metal on metal i go yeah kind of

760
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,679
like the brakes on your car you guys

761
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,159
ever have a car where the brakes finally

762
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,400
went

763
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,679
and now you're literally metal on metal

764
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,679
your metal rotor

765
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,919
and your metal brake pad is now scraping

766
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,960
and it's going

767
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,720
right squeak squeak and so

768
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,000
i don't have to worry about that with

769
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,320
this machine so

770
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,039
i don't have a metal gear two metal

771
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,159
gears

772
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,919
in there crunching together and that's

773
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,360
another reason why i like this

774
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,360
health with liz good to see you on tik

775
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,640
tok um

776
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,919
kerry says it's 80 off now 82 off you

777
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,080
just ordered it carrie

778
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,320
mm-900 hds right right

779
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,360
so um we'll cover a couple little things

780
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,200
too i just wanted to cover

781
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,960
that information it's all important you

782
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,000
guys i talked about sodium cluster salts

783
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,279
you guys know that

784
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,919
right so it's one thing to like

785
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,520
juice just don't get me wrong here right

786
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,840
there's one thing

787
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,440
to just juice right a doctor friend told

788
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,000
me the other day like

789
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,039
you know and he said well juicing yeah

790
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,480
juicing is great

791
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,240
everybody should juice i'm like wait a

792
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,360
minute wait a minute

793
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,720
don't give me that juicing bs

794
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,760
don't you know and he laughed

795
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,520
he laughed right you know he goes

796
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,279
no juicing is great for you who doesn't

797
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,440
know juicing isn't good for you i go

798
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,039
don't give me that bs

799
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,640
because there's a difference between

800
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,840
making sure you juice your celery and

801
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,760
you juice it right

802
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,159
and you know how to you know how to do

803
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,919
the celery juice the whole bit the

804
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,240
details matter so i just want to cover

805
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,360
that right there the details matter

806
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,320
they matter you know and important to

807
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,159
know

808
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,840
um the details matter

809
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,360
so you can sit there and juice all your

810
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,039
carrots and your cabbage and your

811
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,840
whatever and juice all your stuff like

812
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,039
that right

813
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,039
people did that people did that people

814
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,799
did that for years

815
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,559
it doesn't mean they got their cfs

816
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,240
better it doesn't mean they got their

817
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,760
five real better you guys it doesn't

818
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,360
mean they got their multiple sclerosis

819
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,840
better it doesn't mean they got anything

820
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,120
better

821
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,640
sure they might have got something a

822
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,679
little better but then it all went

823
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,960
backwards

824
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,720
again but the bottom line is it's like

825
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,000
celery juice is a whole

826
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,559
nother level it's a whole entirely

827
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,279
different

828
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,840
therapeutic medicine way of dealing with

829
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,799
things

830
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,520
of handling things with your health so

831
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,559
it's like

832
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,080
if i was to have a juicer it's going to

833
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,320
be for celery

834
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,480
and yellow juice other things for fun

835
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,520
yeah there's ways of doing medicinal

836
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,960
juices there are

837
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,880
like spirit has talked to me about all

838
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,440
the different medicinal juices different

839
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,679
ways of

840
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,679
of combinations which i'll share over

841
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,360
time but the point is is this is

842
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,080
important when it comes down to

843
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,559
celery that's that where the details

844
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,320
matter

845
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,880
instead of like oh yeah okay just i

846
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,960
threw some celery sticks in my juice

847
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
no it's about making sure you do your

848
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,840
celery juice right

849
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,720
that's how we move the needle um

850
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,559
so that's important so don't get plastic

851
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,240
into the body from that machine

852
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,200
you're never you're never going to have

853
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,200
non-plastic exposure on the planet

854
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,240
you're exposed to plastic 24 7

855
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,240
everywhere

856
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,799
it's falling out of the sky it's in the

857
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,640
air it's it's on everything

858
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,840
like we can't run from plastic it's in

859
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,320
the water supply

860
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,120
we can't run from plastic right but

861
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,919
plastic detox is really easy

862
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,480
detox is really easy plastic comes out

863
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,720
of the body

864
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,320
really easy it can come out the next day

865
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,159
if you're doing the right things to come

866
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,279
out the next day plastic comes out of

867
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,399
the body a lot of times when you're not

868
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,760
even doing the right things but the

869
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,120
whole point is

870
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,559
is that metal doesn't come out of the

871
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,640
body easy

872
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,679
and that's something to know right there

873
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,720
okay

874
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,240

883
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,760
metal scares me because if you're not

884
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,039
that's something you've got to work hard

885
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,799
on like with the medical medium heavy

886
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,080
metal detox smoothie

887
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,640
and you don't want to be getting more

888
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,360
metal in you all the time and that's why

889
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,159
i don't like the other juicers too it's

890
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,200
it's all the

891
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,399
metal interaction it's a big

892
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,600
part of why you know i don't like that

893
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,840
um this is this is one piece

894
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,880
instead of gears grinding against each

895
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,240
other

896
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,120
or or centrifuges with metal spinning

897
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,760
and grinding right and if you got those

898
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,720
fine

899
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,080
use them juice your celery i do want you

900
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,679
to get celery juice in you no matter

901
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,519
what and that's the goal

902
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,679
so keep with the juicer you have if

903
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,080
that's the one you have

904
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,080
but it's that metal situation it always

905
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,640
gets to me it's always has so that's why

906
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,480

comes up why am i allergic to celery

929
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,840
well it depends when you eat celery

930
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,760
is something does something crazy happen

931
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,559
does your throat close up

932
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,880
do you start coughing and choking when

933
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,760
you

934
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,840
drink celery or eat celery do you have a

935
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,000
reaction when you have crudite

936
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,200
like is it the kind of allergic reaction

937
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,799
of celery where you're

938
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,320
at a friend's house and you take a

939
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,640
celery stick and you dip it in some

940
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,000
hummus or you dip it in some sour cream

941
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,919
you know dressing or something or

942
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,279
whatever it is and you all of a sudden

943
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,559
you eat that celery stick and it's

944
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,320
definitely the celery stick and you're

945
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,840
choking swelling your throat swelling

946
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,360
that's that's different

947
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,120
that's an allergic reaction someone can

948
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,480
have with any single food i've seen

949
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,080
people have that with meat

950
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,760
seen that people have the chicken i've

951
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,039

so and i've seen it happen with all that

956
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,640

958
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,799

okay all right well i'm glad thanks for

1044
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,880
the food sensitivity test

1045
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:26,720
but i'm allergic to celery right okay

1046
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,640
okay thanks dr soldier

1047
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,160
just so you know that's how it is with a

1048
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,440
lot of people if you guys ever

1049
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,920
experienced that

1050
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,599
right that's how it's that's how the

1051
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,119
system's rigged

1052
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,359
basically they don't know what you're

1053
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,320
allergic to unless you they still don't

1054
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,079
even know if you're allergic to

1055
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,280
something if your throat swells up

1056
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,800
they just gotta eyeball it you can when

1057
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
you eat something

1058
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,520
and someone's throat swells up and

1059
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,160
they're having their anaphylactic shock

1060
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,599
they still don't know like it's how it's

1061
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
possible or if they're allergic to that

1062
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,240
never mind

1063
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,000
why is it possible a doctor can run all

1064
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,599
those tests food sensitivity tests what

1065
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,800
a scam system that is

1066
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,720
and they'll give you 30 allergies

1067
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,640
to like 30 fruits and vegetables and

1068
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,160
herbs and you'll be all of a sudden

1069
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,320
allergic to someone's

1070
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,520
a scallion you'll be allergic to some

1071
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,160
other like

1072
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,920
wacko thing and that's how it's rigged

1073
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,599
exactly i mean is that how it is

1074
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,119
you guys know you guys seen this you've

1075
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,640
gone through this i know many of you

1076
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,520
gone through this

1077
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,520
so anyway um

1078
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,440
here's the thing about what i love about

1079
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,560
celery juice okay so

1080
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,200
here's the thing what i love about

1081
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,200
celery juice

1082
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,880
that's that's an immune cell right there

1083
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,280
okay

1084
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,280
immune cells need mineral salts

1085
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,599
that's what they need they thrive on

1086
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,240
them so what happens is that subgroup of

1087
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,359
sodium

1088
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,079
right there sodium cluster salts

1089
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,280
helps to fortify and strengthen your

1090
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,440
immune cells

1091
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,359
right it's one thing right there it

1092
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,520
helps to get little gobble it one up

1093
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,359
a white blood cell will gobble one up

1094
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,640
when it gobbles up a solar system right

1095
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,720
here because it will

1096
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,079
it's to be super strong that's one thing

1097
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,560
that's interesting

1098
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,800
another thing that's really good is that

1099
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,079
celery juice that sodium cluster salt

1100
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,839
right there that i was showing you guys

1101
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,280
that subgroup of sodium

1102
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,160
it eats away the slip cover

1103
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,359
on bacteria and viruses so there's slip

1104
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,839
covers out here

1105
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,040
really important to know all the bugs

1106
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,000
inside of us

1107
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,320
have a protective sheath and that's how

1108
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,760
they stay alive and stay strong

1109
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,800
so they can evade all kinds of problems

1110
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,480
right so the sodium cluster salts eats

1111
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,000
away at that slip cover

1112
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,920
but you may think you don't have any

1113
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,119
bacteria you may think you don't have

1114
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,680
any viruses

1115
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,400
fibromyalgia aches and pains tingles and

1116
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,640
numbness

1117
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,560
mystery tingles and numbness ringing in

1118
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,760
the ears vertigo ever

1119
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,480
all that's viral okay chronic sinusitis

1120
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,520
utis

1121
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,760
bacteria right styes right

1122
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,800
if anybody has cold sores fever blisters

1123
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,680
boom viral

1124
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,119
right these are just some things if

1125
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,040
you've been diagnosed with anything

1126
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:14,079
ms lupus lyme disease pathogens right

1127
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,160
viruses but that's just some things

1128
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,760
fatigue bloating aches and pains

1129
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,359
feeling like you're 100 years old when

1130
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,119
you're only 50.

1131
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,160
you know all these things right feeling

1132
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,599
like you're 100 years old when you're

1133
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,079
only 22.

1134
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,119
okay the viruses and bacteria that make

1135
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,839
us sick

1136
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,520
feeding off the toxins inside of us okay

1137
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,920
have a slip cover on them

1138
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,119
and the sodium cluster salt eats away

1139
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,079
that slip cover

1140
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,240
and blows them up explodes them

1141
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,480
important to know

1142
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:50,720
really important information um

1143
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,040
so if someone gets like diarrhea

1144
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,720
they get runs they get the runs from

1145
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,560
their celery juice

1146
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,119
okay you're killing off

1147
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,800
pockets of bacteria so let's do this

1148
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,720
right now let's do a little

1149
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,359
run down on something for you guys real

1150
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,359
quick okay

1151
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,839
so

1152
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,480
so inside your gut lives a whole bunch

1153
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,079
of bad bacteria

1154
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,200
right and viruses too but they hide

1155
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:26,000
in pockets of rancid

1156
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,079
fat that stuck to the walls of your

1157
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,440
intestinal tract

1158
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,640
they thrive in pockets that are in the

1159
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,599
colon too

1160
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,119
okay and so putrefied proteins that

1161
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,760
didn't digest well

1162
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,359
because everybody has crappy digestion

1163
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,680
rancid fats that are caked onto the

1164
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:47,200
intestinal walls and linings

1165
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,920
right that's still there your pork fat

1166
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,560
you had

1167
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,400
i wasn't kidding about that it's still

1168
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,640
sitting on the lining of your gut and

1169
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,119
what's behind that pork fat

1170
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,920
are the bugs so that's important to know

1171
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,560
right there

1172
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:06,480
so what's sitting behind that pork fat

1173
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,359
are the bugs right and

1174
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,280
those little guys you know and they

1175
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,800
colonize in there

1176
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,560
now you might be somebody who says oh i

1177
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,000
got a good good practitioner i got a

1178
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,720
good doctor i'm all these gut health

1179
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,839
protocols

1180
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,079
all these probiotics well good

1181
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,440
microorganisms

1182
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,440
they don't fight bad microorganisms

1183
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,440
so good bacteria doesn't fight bad

1184
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,480
bacteria they don't care about each

1185
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,160
other

1186
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,760
you can put all the good bacteria you

1187
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,720
want inside your gut all the good

1188
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,800
probiotics

1189
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,079
inside your gut you can put anything you

1190
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,359
want inside there

1191
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,560
it's all good right microorganism world

1192
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:45,520
and guess what you can put it all in

1193
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,359
but it doesn't care or go against or

1194
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,960
defend you from the bad bugs

1195
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,720
the bad bugs just sit there doing their

1196
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,960
thing they'll still cause harm

1197
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,280
to still create more pockets they'll eat

1198
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,680
away at your lining over the year scar

1199
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,319
it up

1200
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,599
cause scar tissue right and they'll

1201
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,160
cause problems

1202
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,280
they'll multiply multiply release toxins

1203
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,240
because of it

1204
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,079
keep you more sick and toxic but you can

1205
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,599
put all the good microorganisms you want

1206
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,640
inside your body and it's not going to

1207
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,920
defend you

1208
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,599
at all against the bad stuff and

1209
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,280
that's one of the things you can stay

1210
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,720
sick you can go do all the gut health

1211
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,560
protocols you want but you stay

1212
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,319
sick if you're really sick you're going

1213
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,079
to stay sick over time

1214
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,640
or get sick again because the bad stuff

1215
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,839
is always in there

1216
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,000
and um why don't they ever see this

1217
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,560
stuff during colonoscopies

1218
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,599
we're talking microscopic levels right

1219
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,960
we're talking the

1220
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,720
microscopic world that's why right

1221
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,160
but i've talked to surgeons there's a

1222
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,680
lot of stuff inside there's a lot of

1223
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,960
putrified linings

1224
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,839
with rancid fats petrified proteins in

1225
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,800
the gut

1226
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,920
and the the scope just goes right by it

1227
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,319
it's it's all there

1228
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,119
on the lining of the walls but what you

1229
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,800
mistake

1230
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,680
what happens is what you mistake if you

1231
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,119
ever look at the pathway of the camera

1232
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,240
going in

1233
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,800
you think you're looking at your

1234
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,359
intestinal tract lining

1235
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,200
but we're looking at a layer over the

1236
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,040
intestinal tract lining

1237
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,119
just keep that in mind and then when a

1238
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,200
polyp comes out of that intestinal tract

1239
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,079
lining when a polyp pops out

1240
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,160
they'll see the polyp but you're still

1241
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,280
going to have a layer

1242
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,119
of all the putrified proteins putrefied

1243
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,680
rancid fat you're still going to have

1244
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,680
that there

1245
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,920
there's still that layer and it's in

1246
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,800
pockets too when that scope goes around

1247
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,640
and everything

1248
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,640
it's not catching every pocket every

1249
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,200
bend that's important to know right

1250
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,119
there

1251
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,319
okay and the majority of the garbage

1252
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,280
is up here that's the majority of the

1253
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,920
garbage

1254
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,280
it's up here it's all in this area here

1255
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,319
and then you have plenty of it in other

1256
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,079
areas too

1257
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,000
but what people mistaken i've talked to

1258
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,319
a colon surgeon about that

1259
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,599
he says what people don't understand is

1260
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,359
you're right he said

1261
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,040
that lining is not technically the

1262
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,880
lining that the camera is looking at

1263
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,160
that's a lining of

1264
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,880
of putrified junk that's adhered

1265
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,000
it's adhered to your colon and

1266
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,520
intestinal tract no one

1267
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,680
gets to see a fresh colon lining

1268
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,319
when they're doing a scope you've got

1269
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,400
years of the junk all stuck to the sides

1270
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,839
and that's one of the things to know but

1271
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,599
the microscopic world

1272
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,760
the cameras can't see the microscopic

1273
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,000
world no way the scope going up their

1274
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,680
rounds not looking at the microorganisms

1275
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,079
and if the good and bad ones are doing

1276
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,280
their thing um

1277
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,200
anyway if you're sensitive with the

1278
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,119
celery juice and you're having diarrhea

1279
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,319
you're having loose bowels build

1280
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,400
yourself up

1281
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,760
do a little bit two to four ounces or

1282
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,440
ask your doctor what's right for you

1283
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,240
okay that's fine ask your doctor what's

1284
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,520
right for you

1285
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,319
you can do that it's perfectly fine

1286
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,520
um but anyway you guys just wanted to

1287
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,720
let you know that

1288
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:56,960
82 dollars off which is

1289
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:59,400
incredible right it's 25 off but 82

1290
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,599
is the break you get but it's at a

and that's where the sale is and it's

1294
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,400
mm-900 hds so you know if you don't get

1295
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,079
the mm-900 hds you're not going to get

1296
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,000
the juicer it squeezes

1297
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,000
all the juice out you're going to get

1298
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,200
another juicer that doesn't squeeze as

1299
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,599
much juice out

1300
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,720
and that defeats the purpose of what

1301
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,560
you're trying to do

1302
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,000
you're trying to get a juicer to pay for

1303
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,119
itself

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,839
