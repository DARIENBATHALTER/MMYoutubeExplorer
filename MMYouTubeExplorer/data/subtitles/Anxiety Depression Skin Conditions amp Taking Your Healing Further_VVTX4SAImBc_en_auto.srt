i noticed on the health scene out there

81
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
the details don't matter

82
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,959
it's all black or white you're either

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
vegan or you're animal protein black or

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,959
white

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,800
vegan or animal protein you know you do

86
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,760
collagen or you don't do collagen black

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,319
or white

88
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,760
right it's just it's it's everything's

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,400
everything's just black or white out

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,959
there

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,560
and but yet everything is still under

92
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,080
the whole umbrella of

93
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
autoimmune out there your body's

94
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,760
attacking itself it's black or white

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,599
you get an autoimmune diagnosis it's

96
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,720
your body it's attacking itself that's

97
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,920
what science research says in

98
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,280
alternative medicine conventional

99
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,800
medicine it's black or white

100
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,400

101
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,239

106
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,959
system and you leave the colt system and

107
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,280

that

153
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,600
and that's a leafy green that's cilantro

154
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,440
details matter

155
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,000
when do you have any help on long covet

156
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,759
if you look at this book right here

157
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
there's a whole section on that just so

158
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,639
you know

159
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,080
and long cove it actually stems from

160
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,680
medical medium that's where it's first

161
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,600
published and that's where it originates

162
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,400
from meaning the concept

163
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,560
of long covers actually comes from the

164
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,120
reactivated epstein-barr

165
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
that is actually in the medical medium

166
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,520
book right here

167
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,280
new edition though make sure it's the

168
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,280
new edition right there right

169
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,360
so healing

170
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,280
takes more than the whole black or white

171
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,080
thing you're just

172
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,960
not gonna heal if we see everything like

173
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
that

174
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,240
you can't it's just not gonna happen you

175
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
might be able to manage something for a

176
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,800
little while

177
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,360
you might be able to stay in the game

178
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,160
for a little while if you're not so sick

179
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
but if we try to do the whole black or

180
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,240
white thing

181
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
it's black and white it's either black

182
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,039
or white we're just gonna get in trouble

183
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
because it takes more than that

184
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,600
cilantro's

185
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,199
not an answer details though

186
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,639
matter you guys lots of cilantro

187
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,680
as a leafy green changes

188
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,080

is caused by epstein-barr so when

293
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,080

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,360
fatigue

303
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,360
because of the nervous system being

304
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,279
burdened by something

305
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,399
all these details matter you see how it

306
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,440
works you guys

307
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,160
and here it is here the cfs section

308
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,920

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,760
so uh mecfs right

310
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,079
it's also called other things too

311
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,880
because they rename it every decade they

312
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,360
never give you an

313
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
answer to why anybody has cfs nobody

314
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,200

315
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,600
why they're sick with cfs right but they

316
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,959
rename it every 10 years

317
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,959
for no reason okay so

318
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,800
in the chronic fatigue syndrome section

319
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,560
you'll see cat's claw being really

320
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
important the reason why is because when

321
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,160
you read this

322
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,360

323
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,839
any of the over

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,320
60 varieties of epstein-barr virus

325
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:06,560

details matter over 60 varieties of

327
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,760
epsilon bar virus that means

328
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,959
people have different varieties

329
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,800
different varieties different strains so

330
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,839
important right there

331
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,240
ready accompanied by toxic

332
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
heavy metals and we're doing the heavy

333
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,720
metal detox movie

334
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,560
so we're going to do the heavy metal

335
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,920
detox moving you guys on tick tock i got

okay toxic heavy metals such as mercury

339
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,279
and aluminum can create this condition

340
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,399
that i call neurological fatigue so if

341
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,600
you hear that term out there it

342
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,120
originates from medical medium

343
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,560
information now doctors are using it

344
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,160
they call it neurological fatigue

345
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,480
there's no scientific study with that it

346
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,399
comes from medical medium

347
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,320
which is far more pronounced in limiting

348
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,680
than simply being tired that's

349
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,399
neurological fatigue

350
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,360

you can ask for smaller

538
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
amounts and then go in again at another

works

543
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,039
this details cell lifesaver lifesaver

544
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,400
you get too much blood taken you lose

545
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,640
your immune system

546
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
and the virus that's giving you sickness

547
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
the whole reason why you're in the

548
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,720
doctor's office to begin with

549
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,280
getting your blood taken even though the

550
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,640
doctor doesn't know you're viral

551
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,799
the whole reason why you're in there

552
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,880
sick is because

553
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,720
of the virus and when your immune system

554
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,720
gets removed constantly

555
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,240
through removing your white cow by

556
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,720
getting too much blood

557
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,280
your viruses get stronger and you're

558
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,320
sicker

559
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,000
and sicker and sicker this is why so

many have died from getting 20 vials of

563
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,519
even even

941
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,120
isn't even like safe they just make a

942
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,200
chemical and they put it out that

943
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,880
that that next month they just make a

944
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,360
deadly chemical put it out the next

945
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,279
month

946
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,399
pop it in something like a centi candle

947
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,919
or something else

948
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,000
and then the byproduct of all those

949
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,240
chemicals goes into the planes

950
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,440
to go up in the sky and be dumped on you

951
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,640
so they can get rid of it because you're

952
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,360
not allowed to dump it in the water

953
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,360
system anymore

954
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,519

955
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,159

incredible detail if you do more

964
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,000
cilantro

965
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,120
you get more healing done it's a leafy

966
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,519
green highly

967
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,799
mineralized but also takes out toxic

968
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,320
heavy metals

969
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,039
it's got some cilantro in there

970
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,000
got two bananas in there too and let's

971
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,000
do some orange

972
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,919
cilantro is an herb but you can use it

973
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,760
as a leafy green that's medical medium

974
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,760
information you could eat it as a leafy

975
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,480
green when i was first

976
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,919
many years ago as as a child practically

977
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,960
when i was first teaching people about

978
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,279
all this stuff

979
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,440
i'd be like cilantro is a leafy green

980
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,799
and they're like what iceberg lettuce

981
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,799
look you didn't hear me cilantro is

982
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,720
leafy green iceberg

983
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,960
lettuce there was an iceberg lettuce

984
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,039
zombie problem in the health movement

985
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,960
every single you you guys don't even

986
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,399
know like the plant-based doctors that

987
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,159
are out there now that seem to be on

988
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,960
everything like meaning like to be hip

989
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,720
on everything

990
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,640
it seems and all that they were in

991
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,360
iceberg lettuce just just 12 years ago

992
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,880
10 years ago

993
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,519
years ago it was like they didn't even

994
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,760
know about a leafy real green right

995
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,919
and then when i blew up the kale thing

996
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,200
when i exploded the kale thing

997
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,039
because that's medical medium that

998
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,840
started the whole kale movement which

999
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,000
turned into

1000
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,519
chips turning to kill everything right

1001
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,040
that was me lecturing about kale

1002
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,480
teaching about kale that was

1003
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,159
talking to tens of thousands of people

1004
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,000
about kale so when i

1005
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,440
when i started the whole kale movement

1006
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,440
of getting that out there

1007
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,280
it got into the system where all of a

1008
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,560
sudden then the vegan doctors and other

1009
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,960
people were like okay

1010
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,760

no bad people in the world meanwhile we

1063
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,240
wiped out the native americans they

1064
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,880
barely exist on the planet

1065
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,560
they live in squalor and then we throw

1066
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,079
them a bone once in a while and try to

1067
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,160
publicize it like we've taken care of

1068
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,720
the native americans when we've on

1069
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,040
them for

1070
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,720
for centuries we just destroyed the

1071
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,160
native american culture

1072
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,160
no one even talks about it

1073
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,839
i mean look what happens even when all

1074
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,839
the rights come up

1075
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,000
everybody's fighting for rights for

1076
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,040
diversity still they just don't no one

1077
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,359
wants to even

1078
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,040
like recognize the native americans it's

1079
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,320
like oh no those are those crazy native

1080
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,400
americans over there

1081
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,480
jumping around right there yeah no we

1082
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,280
don't we don't focus on those at all

1083
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,880
meanwhile we've genocided them to death

1084
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,400
it's just unbelievable

1085
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,920
well i got to put the spirit lean in

1086
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,920
here in the barley grass juice powder

1087
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,040
you tell me if the world is like got it

1088
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,960
all right

1089
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,440
or something anyway the point i'm saying

1090
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
is

1091
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,720
it's come kind of reason why i talk

1092
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,040
about stuff like that is it comes down

1093
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,480
to this

1094
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,640
if we don't have control over a lot

1095
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,800
around us but we got control into what

1096
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,839
got into us and if it got into us in a

1097
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,200
way because

1098
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,599
of not good stuff out there okay

1099
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,280
i just put some spirit leaving here so

1100
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,119
what it's about is empowerment

1101
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,880
you can dump some chemtrails but guess

1102
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,000
what that stuff that's being dumped on

1103
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,359
me i'm going to get out of my

1104
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,960
body you can't rule

1105
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,800
my life that's what real empowerment is

1106
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,640
real empowerment is is knowing what's

1107
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,320
going on but being able to do something

1108
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,079
about it

1109
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,680
because i can make the medical medium

1110
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,760
heavy metal detox smoothie

1111
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,119
i could protect myself from a chemtrail

1112
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
i don't know what you're doing over

1113
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,119
there

1114
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,040
i don't know what you're doing over

1115
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,000
there

1116
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,119
but i'm gonna make sure i'm empowered

1117
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,960
and i can actually take care of myself

1118
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,320
so when toxic heavy metals get into us

1119
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,520
through all these different ways that i

1120
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,280
was talking about right because the

1121
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,480
reason why we went down that

1122
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,000
place of yeah yeah

1123
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,599
the reason why we went down to that

1124
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,640
place right

1125
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,480
of fragrances and metals being in

1126
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,720
fluoride treatments

1127
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,000
metals coming out of the sky right and

1128
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,079
saying a chemtrail

1129
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,599
metals in all kinds of different avenues

1130
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,240
that were exposed to

1131
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,599
metals and pharmaceuticals right the

1132
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,119
pharmaceuticals and metals

1133
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,119
it's like metals don't have to be in

1134
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,440
pharmaceuticals for some reason

1135
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,880
somebody thinks it's a good idea who's

1136
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,760
not looking out for everybody's best

1137
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,160
interest right

1138
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,440
so the reason why i'm talking about all

1139
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,599
that is because hey

1140
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,440
we could do something about it you're

1141
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,160
not gonna take you're not gonna

1142
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,800
and you're not gonna disempower me

1143
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,359
because i'm gonna get the medals out

1144
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,000
and i'm gonna get cleaned up and that's

1145
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,440
the key

1146
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,599
right there anyway spirulina is

1147
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,839
is really an incredible weapon against

1148
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,560
all of this toxicity

1149
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,960
i love it for for being a weapon against

1150
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,880
radiation exposure

1151
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,680
i love it being a weapon against the

1152
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,960
fragrances and the air fresheners

1153
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:24,160
and all of that okay so that's what i

1154
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,920
love these tools so i just put in a

1155
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,079
teaspoon in there right there that's the

1156
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,280
vimergy spirulina visa vs victor i

1157
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,760
m e r g y dot com it's the best one out

1158
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,560
there

1159
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,960
by far hands down there's no better one

1160
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,960
than that

1161
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,880
so i'm going to put in the barley grass

1162
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,240
juice powder that's what i'm doing now

1163
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,720
now what you're going to find out there

1164
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,040
is corella

1165
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,880
everybody's going to be like corella

1166
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,760
that's what you use right everybody's

1167
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,880
going to be

1168
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,560
well corella doesn't work these details

1169
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,079
are critical and i talk about that and

1170
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,960
cleanse the heels so

1171
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,760
get a copy when you can right 51 off at

1172
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,839
amazon

1173
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,000
but get a copy when you can learn about

1174
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,560
why corella's not the way to go

1175
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,920
that means books talk about that these

1176
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,200
are capsules i'm just opening the

1177
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,880
capsules

1178
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,240
putting in the smoothie because i ran

1179
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,520
out of the powder

1180
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:21,040
i got to order the powder right

1181
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,040
so i'm putting some capsules in there

1182
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,560
all right so we got that

1183
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:34,079
this is one critical detail right here

1184
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,760
so if you want to get metals out it's

1185
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,960
got to be a spirulina

1186
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,800
a high quality one is best but it's got

1187
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,760
to be a spirulina

1188
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,319
corella will not get the metals out and

1189
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,640
this is

1190
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,359
where the whole thing happens again

1191
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,520
where

1192
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,880
the details do matter because people

1193
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,760
don't realize that

1194
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,720
so important right another detail is i

1195
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,599
don't use the

1196
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,839
pacific spirulina anymore so any

1197
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,520
spirulina that's derived

1198
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,920
grown on you know on the west in the

1199
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,319
west

1200
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,960
any pacific okay the ocean's got too

1201
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,880
dirty in the last few years so i stopped

1202
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,440
quite a ways back it just got too dirty

1203
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,520
it's got even dirtier than ever before

1204
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,680
it's at a point now where i just can't

1205
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,640
even trust anything like that

1206
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,000
so so this is the best one is november

1207
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,839
just letting you know

1208
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,440
all these things count we got the orange

1209
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,800
in there we got the wild blueberries

1210
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,240
let's grind this up

1211
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:34,880
oh put a little dulce in there yep

1212
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:49,839
atlantic dolce

1213
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:49,839
important let's give it a little

1214
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,480
having fun with the blender

1215
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,839
what question mark spirulina yes

1216
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,319
okay we're good

1217
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,800
we are blended up nicely

1218
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,520
indeed we are medical medium heavy metal

1219
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,200
detox smoothie

1220
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,040
so what i like about the medical medium

1221
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,000
heavy metal detox smoothie it's one of

1222
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,760
the

1223
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,880
it's like a prayer answered

1224
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,640
for anxiety depression

1225
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,960
there are people that were in such a

1226
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,359
deep dark space with their depression

1227
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,480
they didn't want to be depressed they

1228
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,119
didn't want to be sad

1229
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,200
they didn't want depression right but

1230
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,119
they had

1231
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,000
such a systemic deep depression inside

1232
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,760
of them

1233
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,359
the kind that people only understand who

1234
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,520
have been there who who have been in

1235
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,800
that zone of depression

1236
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,440
not a depression where something tragic

1237
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,440
happens

1238
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,599
and you're you're trying to move past it

1239
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,680
and it could take years and you're

1240
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,800
you're just you're emotionally injured

1241
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,359
through it you know

1242
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,200
the depression where and you can have

1243
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,400
both you can have a depression from

1244
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,760
toxic heavy metals

1245
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,560
and that depression too of course right

1246
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,920
but with the kind of depression where

1247
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,480
people are depressed they don't want to

1248
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,000
be

1249
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,240
depressed and they're just curled up in

1250
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,920
their bed they can't move forward their

1251
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,319
life they feel like they can't get they

1252
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,839
can't

1253
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,520
push through they're just living with

1254
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,800
the depression every minute

1255
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,680
it's like it's like a cloud over their

1256
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,200
eyes

1257
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,119
they can't see even though they're

1258
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,040
looking even though they can see but

1259
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,400
they feel like they can't see anything

1260
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,040
they're just they're just living with

1261
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:53,359
that depression to such an extent

1262
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,880
and it's a cover depression in here okay

1263
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,040
and cleanse the heel i cover it in the

1264
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,319
other book too medical meme new edition

1265
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,760
but this is the medical media morning

1266
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,359
cleanse that we've been doing heavy

1267
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,880
metal detox cleanse

1268
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:07,359
so important heavy metal detox smoothie

1269
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,599
has freed so many people you guys

1270
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:14,880
of that clinical deep dark depression

1271
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,400
and that that means everything for

1272
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,960
someone who's going through that

1273
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,079
and when it comes down to to anxiety it

1274
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,599
does that too so what's

1275
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,680
happening with the depression and the

1276
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,839
anxiety let's cover that real quick

1277
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:33,119
let's do that i'm excited about this

1278
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,119
so actually we'll cover it this way here

1279
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,839
so when it comes down to depression

1280
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,040
toxic heavy metals they get into the

1281
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,800
brain

1282
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,720
that alone can create depression because

1283
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,400
your neurotransmitters are being

1284
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,119
affected and your neurons are being

1285
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,680
saturated by toxic heavy metals aluminum

1286
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,400
mercury

1287
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,599
lead cadmium copper copper is a big one

1288
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,000
for everybody

1289
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,560
and people get copper in their brain and

1290
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,800
it causes this problem so it's important

1291
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,000
and when the brain gets saturated with

1292
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,319
metals

1293
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,480
okay and it's not detectable by

1294
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,680
equipment technology today it's not

1295
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,839
detectable by medical you know tests

1296
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,440
the doctor can't detect it here's the

1297
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,200
problem with toxic heavy metals they go

1298
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,680
deep in organs and then there's not

1299
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,160
enough

1300
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,760
of that toxic heavy metal going through

1301
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,319
the bloodstream for the doctor to

1302
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,920
identify unless it's a fresh exposure

1303
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,599
and then they can identify it if they

1304
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,240
look right

1305
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,560
but a deep exposure is something where

1306
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,400
the metals go deep inside the brain

1307
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,000
deep inside the liver deep inside their

1308
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,400
body

1309
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,800
okay so when it comes down to depression

1310
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,520
and anxiety metals play a huge role

1311
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,040
because they

1312
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,680
oxidize they start to break down so the

1313
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,960
metals start to break down and oxidize

1314
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,760
and when a metal breaks down and

1315
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,880
oxidizes it travels

1316
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,119
so instead of being say here

1317
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,560
right left hemisphere somewhere closer

1318
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,599
to the frontal lobe instead of being

1319
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,240
there

1320
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,319
that the metal starts to travel because

1321
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:06,200
it oxidized and it

1322
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:07,440
out gassed and it what it did was it

1323
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,480
exploded

1324
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,760
metals tend to rust and explode

1325
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,000
i hate when that happens that's why

1326
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,440
we're

1327
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,280
live okay the head of my dummy just hit

1328
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,760
the floor

1329
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,359
all right so when those metals lean

1330
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,560
those metals

1331
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:30,000
they oxidize and they rust they travel

1332
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,760
it's byproduct caused by it so let's go

1333
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,440
into that a little bit like why are they

1334
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,160
doing that in people like why

1335
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,040
are metals here we go you guys why are

1336
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,680
metals

1337
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,960
oxidizing why are they moving why are

1338
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,359
they running off

1339
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,079
ashley kevin i know it's funny right why

1340
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,760
are they

1341
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:50,400
why do they do that because of acids

1342
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,000
and oxidative fats so we're told to eat

1343
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,520
fats eat fats eat fats and what you're

1344
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,760
noticing is medical medium warning

1345
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,839
cleanse

1346
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,400
medium heavy metal detox smoothie

1347
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,319
doesn't have any fat in it

1348
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,920
so there's no almonds there's no almond

1349
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:08,240
butter there's no peanut butter

1350
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:10,560
in that smoothie there's no cacao

1351
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,000
in that smoothie so the heavy metal

1352
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,119
detox

1353
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,359
smoothie doesn't have the fat in it

1354
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,960
because it's all that high fat diet

1355
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:22,319
everybody's up against

1356
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,800
24 7 that's oxidating

1357
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,440
the metals and making them hard to even

1358
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,119
remove

1359
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,480
or clean out so the medical meeting

1360
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,839
warning cleanse

1361
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:35,440
is a great way to do some metal removal

1362
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,520
that's what it is to remove your metals

1363
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,520
in the morning and when you do the heavy

books ptsd can worsen

1383
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,599
the experiences that create ptsd can

1384
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,880
worsen if metals

1385
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,720

is best

1432
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,680
before you start doing fats it's best in

1433
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,920
the morning

1434
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,119
that's the best time to actually use it

1435
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,200
just so you know

1436
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,040
does the heavy metal detox have to be

1437
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,559
done in the morning it is best then but

1438
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,760
you can do it at other times in a day if

1439
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,640
you really want to

1440
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,160
you can you can break the rules a little

1441
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,400
bit if you have to

1442
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,920
there's room for it medical medium

1443
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,680
information is about the details and all

1444
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,200
the details matter if you want to go all

1445
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,319
the way but for best results if you want

1446
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,599
to go all the way but it doesn't mean

1447
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,280
you're not going to get some results if

1448
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,640
you do the heavy metal detox smoothie

1449
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,480
some other time or

1450
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,040
if it was after fats at a certain meal

1451
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,800
or whatever it is it's it's okay

1452
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,920
if you have to bend the rules russell

1460
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,559
not so simple

1461
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,690

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,319

really hard on people that brain

1474
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,960
toxic heavy metals play a role in that

1475
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,880
brain fog

1476
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,480
they play well sometimes they play the

1477
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,680
complete role

1478
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:03,200
in that brain fog okay sometimes they

1479
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:08,960
they play the complete role

1480
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:10,960
right medical medium info

1481
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,400
is about getting results getting people

better

1483
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,800
and it's not all talk i notice in the

1484
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,319
health movement

1485
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,400
that's what people are always saying out

1486
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,280
there now

1487
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,280
but it's all talk

1488
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,720

[Music]

1538
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,200
it's not about a lack of calories the

1539
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,319
motto eating cleanse is in a diet

1540
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,350
a lack of calories like crunching your

1541
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,880
calories down

1542
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:48,079
[Music]

1543
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:50,799

00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,160
yeah it's not like you're starving your

1545
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,839
baby or your body

1546
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,760
of being able to build breast milk

1547
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:58,100
that's not it you make sure you get the

1548
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,650
calories in

1549
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,720

00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:09,160
and be plant-based yeah you should do it

1554
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,480
you should do it

1555
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:15,119
[Music]

1556
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:20,740
problem is in the plant-based movement

1557
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:22,400
so much misinformation out there

1558
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,839
[Applause]

1559
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,000
and i noticed all through the years of

1560
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:28,190
the plant-based movement no one

1561
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,400
in the plant-based movement

1562
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,559
[Music]

1563
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,640
people that were elevated in their

1564
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,200
position in the plant-based movement

1565
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,720
knew why anybody was sick i mean okay

1566
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,160
let's talk about fast foods and

1567
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,760
processed foods but they still don't

1568
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,520
know why anybody's sick

1569
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,359
a plant-based movement as far as it ever

1570
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,599
got for information was

1571
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,799
if you eat junk food you're gonna get

1572
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,480
heart disease

1573
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,040
so the plant-based movement was all

1574
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,160
about if you eat junk food and processed

1575
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,079
foods

1576
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,440
that if you eat all that fast food you

1577
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,119
know i mean the plant-based movement was

1578
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,720
all about fast food right

1579
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,400
don't eat all the fast food and kill

1580
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,880
yourself with all the junk fast food and

1581
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,559
animal

1582
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,240
products and animal grease that was as

1583
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,720
far as the plant-based movement ever got

1584
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,799
they didn't know why 20-year-olds were

1585
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,960
on mattress island

1586
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,480
not able to talk or walk they didn't

1587
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,319
know why 25 year olds

1588
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,680
would lose their jobs and careers or

1589
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,040
they would they would get out of college

1590
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,480
and get a job and then all of a sudden

1591
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,480
have to go home and lay in bed

1592
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,000
they didn't know why college girls and

1593
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,720
college boys would kind of have to come

1594
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,720
back

1595
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,079
from school and stay at home with their

1596
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,280
parents and live there for the next 10

1597
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,640
years sick

1598
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,400
they didn't know that the plant-based

1599
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,520
movement just knew about fast food

1600
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,760
greasy food

1601
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,799
that's what they knew about so now

1602
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,480
they're learning more

1603
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,920
through medical medium through osmosis

1604
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,480
which is medical medium information

1605
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,839
getting all

1606
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,240
out there plus i've taught a lot of the

1607
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:46,000
plant-based doctors throughout the years

1608
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,520
about the low-fat and other stuff so

1609
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,280
that they've taken that information

1610
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,200
further right

1611
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,440
but because you know medical medium gets

1612
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,200
its information from above

1613
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,720
they always like to try to find some

1614
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,400
kind of study that has nothing to do

1615
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,400
with the information at all

1616
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,160
but just has one word in there that's

1617
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,520
similar and be like oh it came from that

1618
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,720
no it came from medical medium because

1619
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,319
there is no study on that

1620
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,480
so anyway let's get a strainer and do

1621
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,480
this

1622
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,839
and then you can't get then all these

1623
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,359
other people are misled and can't get

1624
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,240
back to where the real information is

1625
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,640
that they can heal that's the only

1626
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,760
reason why i care about it

1627
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:24,640
i never got into this as a child to be

1628
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,640
known or anything

1629
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:29,200
that's that's not the game that's the

1630
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,200
bad game

1631
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:36,400
i got into this to save lives right

1632
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:39,119
and i was forced into it to save lives

1633
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,040
and then i i then i had to make sure i

1634
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,400
got comfortable with that

1635
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,640
when i was really young i talked about

1636
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:48,079
that in medical medium books right

1637
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,079
that's your celery juice right here

1638
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,160
but you got to be really in it to

1639
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,880
protect people and make sure that you

1640
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,119
really do get them better

1641
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,480
i was working on people tens of

1642
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:05,760
thousands of people for so many decades

1643
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,520
and then i was working on all kinds of

1644
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,040
professionals that were trying to make a

1645
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,359
name for themselves in the plant-based

1646
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,839
movement so they would talk to me

1647
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:16,079
get all this information right about

1648
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,359
heavy metals or about something

1649
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:19,119
and then they would go out there and try

1650
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,559
to make a name for themselves

1651
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,559
so they could sell a product and become

1652
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,480
famous right and

1653
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,920
i sat back in my office while people

1654
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,440
traveled around the world to come see me

1655
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,799
in my office because i was known as the

1656
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,480
bizarre symptoms guy

1657
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,839
and that's how everybody got to know me

1658
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,160
is i had an answer

1659
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:37,920
when there were no answers and

1660
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,480
you know it should be really about the

1661
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,839
person suffering struggling

1662
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:46,640
and knowing where the details come from

1663
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:48,640
so they can heal all the way not take

1664
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,640
tidbits to make yourself look big so you

1665
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,920
can do some documentary somewhere

1666
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,280
or some podcast and then not show people

1667
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,000
the way and be like you know what

1668
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,119
i'll never forget this one this one case

1669
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,119
okay you guys

1670
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:06,960
uh this young woman who was

1671
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:11,200

anyway

1708
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:29,599
this person this this woman

1709
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,359
got into the lottery system and medical

1710
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,440
medium when i was still seeing people

1711
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,880
this is many years ago she got into the

1712
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,680
lottery system

1713
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,920
she was chosen in the lottery system and

1714
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:44,079
she got an appointment with me

1715
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,799
and she told me the story and i said

1716
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,799
it's a chiropractor in a way is this

1717
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,119
person's name this

1718
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:52,480
and she goes yeah i go well that's a

1719
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,400
client of mine

1720
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,400
the chiropractor in l.a wanted to seem

1721
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,599
like a big wig

1722
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,599
knowing a part of the information

1723
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:04,079
but not telling her where the

1724
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:07,359
information came from and how she needed

1725
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:11,280
to find medical medium to get all of it

1726
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:14,160
she she was obviously an angel

1727
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,839
got her to the direction of medical

1728
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,599
media because the minute she got her

1729
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,720
appointment with me and this is before i

1730
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,160
publish books that

1731
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,359
everybody can get a chance to heal he's

1732
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,880
just you know and then she got an

1733
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:24,319
appointment with me

1734
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,079
she was able to heal and get all the

1735
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:28,319
information and she couldn't

1736
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,760
understand why this chiropractor would

1737
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:33,760
hold back

1738
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,119
and do this to her and so she contacted

1739
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,760
the chiropractor and said

1740
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,280
i'm talking to anthony william he's

1741
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,119
giving me all the information about why

1742
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,400
epstein-barr causes this why didn't you

1743
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,000
tell me that's where you

1744
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,440
that you actually knew him that you

1745
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,960
actually saw him as a

1746
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:52,480
as a as a client and he was just

1747
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:54,319
he was it was ego thing right and

1748
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,760
that's the problem that's just one out

1749
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:59,359
