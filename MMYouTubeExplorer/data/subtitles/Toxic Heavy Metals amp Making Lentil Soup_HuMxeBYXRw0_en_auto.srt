something there's nothing more

427
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,840
disturbing when you see things in the

428
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,960
mainstream Alzheimer's scientists have

429
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,760
now studied what causes Alzheimer's you

430
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,080
mean like what you did last for the last

431
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,400
30 years what you thought it was

432
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,799
proteins in the brain and some other

433
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,720
stuff right right and now they're like

434
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,799
you know they're like Alzheimer's um you

435
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,159
know there is hope for people with

436
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:41,880
Alzheimer's it's like yeah how because

437
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:44,400
the heavy metal detox is what reverses

438
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,039
Alzheimer's and has it's what helps

439
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,440
reverse and Stave off and shut it down

440
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,120
and stop it if someone's really bad with

441
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,080
their Alzheimer's it has the ability to

442
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,360
shut that down at least to stop getting

443
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,760
it worse and even backtrack it a little

444
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,320
bit if somebody has you know a moderate

445
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,440
version of Alzheimer's has the ability

446
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,400
to shut that down and backtrack it

447
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,320
somebody has a moderate version of

448
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,240
dementia has the ability to backtrack it

449
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,360
and shut that down if the brain is

450
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,640
damaged too much by metals and dementia

451
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,919
is off the chart so bad someone doesn't

452
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,360

into the lining of the intestinal tract

788
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,480
they burrow themselves in there and in

789
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,879
the liver and it's so important to

790
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,960

different doctors for 20 years begging

796

them to save me from the Alzheimer's

797
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,320
disease not one doctor had ever been

00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,839
over there on Facebook that you have

801
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,919
found this information found the heavy

802
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,079
metal

803
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:45,760
detox heavy metals get into the brain

804
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,560
and they

805
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:54,159
rust let's see grab that and they rust

806
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,320
okay heavy metals get into the brain and

807
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,800
they rust that's how it works

808
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,720
they outp poet they out gas they

809
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,480
explode okay uh Megan Miller quit weed

810
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,560
and chocolate and finally moving the

811
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,400
needle been doing medical meeting for

812
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,000
years thank you Anthony and S so that's

813
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,680
incredible I'm so proud of you by the

814
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,079
way I really

815
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,800
am what happens is Metals get in here

816
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,320
and when they get in here okay they

817
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,599
saturate adjacent tissue that's tissue

818
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,119
next to the metals Metals burrow when

819
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,480
they find their home in the midline

820
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:31,760
canal and other areas the left

821
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,760
hemisphere the right hemisphere frontal

822
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,040
lobe when metals get buried in there

823
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:41,480
around the pituitary and so forth what

824
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:45,440
happens is they outgas they rust they

825
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,520
disintegrate they out poock it okay and

826
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,960
oxidize and when those Metals oxidize

827
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,680
I'll tell you right now what goes wrong

828
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,520
as the metals oxidize they travel and

829
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,119
they travel to other tissue and as they

830
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,680
travel to other tissue you forget who

831
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,599
you are as they travel to other tisue

832
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,319
tissue you get anxiety and depression

833
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,000
and bipolar and OCD as they travel to

834
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:07,240
other tissue you start getting you know

835
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,040
a possible diagnosis of Alzheimer's

836
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,119
dementia and so forth or memory loss and

837
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,319
any kind of other depersonalization

838
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,680
anything when they

839
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,880
travel you can get insomnia you can get

840
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,480
restless legs when they travel to

841
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,800
adjacent tissue you can get all kinds of

842
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,680
