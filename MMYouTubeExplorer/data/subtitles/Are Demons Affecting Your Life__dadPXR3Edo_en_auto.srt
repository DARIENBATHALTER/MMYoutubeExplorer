listen all day long take breaks though

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,520
half an hour at a time because there's

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,000
that much information there and if you

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,480
be affecting people's lives did you get

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,239
to the part of what is a demon did you

61
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,040
guys get to that part yet what is a

62
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,280
demon I mean that information just blows

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,120
my

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,879
mind it just

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,680
does so okay

66
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,000
so let me see let me just look at some

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
different stuff

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,120
here okay so this is interesting right

69
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,519
here so many people live in a bubble out

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,519
there where the thought of Darkness

71
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,680
existing is only meant for the

72
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,400
movies they believe that when things

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,239
happen to people in real life you see it

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,000
all the time by the way things happening

75
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,959
to people in real

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
life they brought it upon themselves how

77
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,640
many people it's like no you brought

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,720
that upon yourself you did that you

79
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,159
created that so a little girl that's

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,080
crossing the street and gets run over by

81
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,280
a car so that little girl brought it

82
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,480
upon themselves like you

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,720
know is that how it works it just

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,799
doesn't make any sense right freak

85
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,480
accidents they brought it upon

86
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,079
themselves

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,760
I mean that's just one thing what about

88
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,840
all the other things too for those who

89
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,040
live with this kind of belief that you

90
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,120
brought it upon

91
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,480
yourself maybe the worst they've

92
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,120
experienced so far was a girlfriend or a

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,400
boyfriend cheating on them I mean that's

94
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,520
bad of course that's bad or a mean

95
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,800
coworker causing a problem a lot of

96
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,800
people they quit their jobs they change

97
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,960
their their work status all of it

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,160
because of that

99
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,960
or a family member who they didn't get

100
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,520
along with while these things can still

101
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,080
bring about grief and injury people

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,800
often don't equate these happenings with

103
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,440
any form of Darkness or even demonic

104
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,800
involvement they don't equate any of

105
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,320
that to it at

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,840
all so when something terrible happens

107
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,800
or some is betrayed so terribly they're

108
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,440
not equating like Darkness being

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,039
involved they just don't connect the

110
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,039
dots to

111
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,560
that this this alone is when you think

112
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,680
about this is

113
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,280
mind-blowing this information to these

114
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,880
people the thought of demonic and Fallen

115
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,319
beings inherently involved in so many of

116
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,319
the world's problems seems overreaching

117
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,240
and not

118
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,960
reality so when you look at all the

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,560
terrible things that happen on this

120
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,919
planet that's

121
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,080
just good people doing terrible things

122
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,479
just for no reason there's no spiritual

123
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,680
connection there's no spiritual war

124
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,759
there's no spiritual

125
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,000
involvement that's not true there is

126
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,080
spiritual

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
involvement there is a spiritual war

128
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,479
I've been saying that for decades there

129
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,160
is all of

130
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,639
this

131
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,479
and darkness is involved with so much

132
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,360
and a lot of people experience it on

133
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,360
their everyday life in their everyday

134
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,639

sleep I couldn't

148
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:43,919
sleep not because of excitement about it

149
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,000
being released I was kind of worried

150
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,840
about how people were going to digest

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,199
this information how they were going to

152
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,639

153
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,639

154
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:01,000

affected by this lineage of family

187
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,120
demons and that is one of the most

188
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,479
powerful one of one of them anyway most

189
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,959
powerful points in this entire audio is

190
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,279
that right there alone the amount of

191
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,800
turmoil people go go through the amount

192
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:46,760
of turmoil they go they go through in

193
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,279
their life with different family members

194
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:53,200
and different things that have happened

195
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:57,560
in the family things that go back like

196
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,440
generations and it's still like a stain

197
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,279
on their Consciousness their memory

198
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,600
memory their grandfather

199
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,040
great-grandfather things that have

200
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,240
happened in their

201
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,519
lives and you can kind of Trace back and

202
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,000
almost kind of like say oh my God I

203
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,120
could see where a demon was involved I

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,920
can see where Darkness was involved why

205
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,920
else did this happen or whoo look at

206
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,079
this if we're not aware that demons are

207
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,920
possibly involved in matters that affect

208
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,640
our

209
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,000
lives or inv involved with other people

210
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,320
who could be in our lives and how they

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,959
react and treat others that's

212
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,120
interesting how they treat others how

213
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,600
they react and treat others or involved

214
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,760
with freak accidents and bad luck it's

215
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,600
just bad luck H that's all it is you got

216
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,920
bad luck that's

217
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,240
all that's not really what it is or

218
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,000
involved with peer pressure you think

219
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,279
peer pressure is demonic the amount of

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,600

demonic on how demons are involved in

240
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,720
peer pressure and how some of the most

241
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,200

do you think demons could be involved

264
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,639
there in any one of those

265
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,760
three you got to you got to hear this

266
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,160
audio you guys have to hear this audio a

267
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,839
bunch of you guys might not even know

268
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,320
that there's an audio you got to check

269
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,720
it out and you have to hear

270
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,399
it but at the same time um it's not for

271
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,959
the faint of heart and at the same

272
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,720
time just a little bit at a time I mean

273
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,880
a half an hour at a time take a break

274
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,160
take a little break as you go as you go

275
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,160
through

276
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,800
or involved with the disturbing news

277
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,880
stories we hear about serial killers

278
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,399
assault and violence so demons aren't

279
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,399
involved in

280
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,880
that or involved with the things going

281
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,880
wrong on a world scale there's a good

282
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,399
chance we're going to blame the wrong

283
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,680
thing now I want to just hit that for a

284
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,399
second there's a really good chance

285
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,600
we're going to blame the wrong thing if

286
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,560
we don't understand the spiritual grow

287
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,680
GD

you so the whole thing with the grid

294
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:25,519
wait till you get to that part is how

295
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,079
you know spiritual forces travel and how

296
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,920
that works that's mind-blowing all on

297
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,160
its own just that part part slavka says

298
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,399
thank you Anthony I just started

299
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,079
listening the audio it is

300
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:42,480
mindblowing it is a miracle God bless

301
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:44,839
you God bless you

302
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,760
too there's a good chance we're going to

303
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,880
blame the wrong thing if we don't

304
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,600
understand what's happening in that

305
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,399
spiritual realm spiritual grid if we

306
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,759
don't understand what's going on

307
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,720
there or even possibly blame ourselves

308
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,240
and that's a really important factor to

309
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,480
why it's critical to have this audio

310
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,079
it's so important this information is so

311
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,800
important you guys know I've been saying

312
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,480
this for years where we can't blame

313
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,920
ourselves that's how the system is set

314
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,000
up the darkness wants us to actually

315
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,920
blame ourselves the system is set up so

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,639
we can blame ourselves the health world

317
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,399
is

318
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,199
rigged so that we blame ourselves too

319
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,079
like we created it we created our

320
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,440
illness we created our problems right

321
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,440
that whole

322
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,839
thing then what happens is anything that

323
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,160
bad happens anything to like I

324
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,600
manifested like manifestation that's

325
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,120
that must be something I brought to

326
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,320
myself I created upon myself something

327
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,519
bad that happened right all of it that's

328
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,320
why it's critical to have this

329
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,160
information to protect yourself this

330
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,160
isn't just

331
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,800
about you know

332
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,839
Forefront unique

333
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,800
unbelievable information about the

334
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,600
spiritual realm which it is it isn't

335
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,199
just about that it's about how do we

336
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,720
protect ourselves like how do we protect

337
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,839
ourselves

338
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,240
this is something that is so important

339
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,240
to have in our

340
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,480
lives and believe me I'm not going to

341
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,480
get a medal for this and I'm not going

342
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,480
to get an award for

343
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,199
this because when you put out this

344
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,240
information when you put out this

345
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:24,839
information it's going to piss somebody

346
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,279
off out there is you put this kind of

347
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,920
Truth out there when you whistleblow on

348
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,519
demons and you whistle blow in darkness

349
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,839
and and that world the spiritual world

350
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,800
and the physical one here and you

351
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:41,040
whistleblow that stuff yeah no it's it's

352
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,319
it's really

353
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,040
intense there's a good chance we're

354
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:48,519
going to blame the wrong thing or even

355
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,839
possibly blame ourselves when crap

356
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:54,680
happens we could

357
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:58,279
even wants us to go into a deep dark

358
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,279

if their demon clung to me as well after

374
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,759
I became closer to them as an adult the

375
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,560
family derms and that's another point

376
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,079
the derms when you listen to this audio

377
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,519
you learn about the

378
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,640
derms the family tree derms you'll learn

379
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,600
about the

380
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,079
derms that's a big one all on its own

381
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:15,039
one of the first things you learn in

382
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:18,919
this audio is demon is a word that came

383
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:23,600
later it's not even the real word or the

384
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,600
real name of these

385
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:30,840
entities this just amazing information

386
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,840
Monica right there says I'm all in

387
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,080
binging okay just binging binging

388
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,880
warning binging warning Penny says it's

389
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,160
addictive it really is it is so I'm

390
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,160
going to talk about the addictive and

391
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,039
binging

392
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,120
warnings if you get through it really

393
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:55,360
fast you might get a log Jam up here CU

394
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,840
there's that much information because

395
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,960
it's it's it's information that's never

396
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,320
been exposed like there's hasn't no

397
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,280
one's been exposed to this information

398
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,919
it's all brand new it's from above so

399
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,000
that alone is really intense because

400
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,880
technically what happens is information

401
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,320
that's out there has been circulating

402
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,400
the spiritual world gets circulated

403
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,320
circul meaning

404
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,320
like

405
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,880
Spirit to that people doing this this is

406
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,440
so brand new it's going to be

407
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,360
intense and it's going to be it's going

408
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,840
to be a shocker

409
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,440
so you have to kind of like pace

410
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,600
yourself and then look if you get

411
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,120
through it go back start again start

412
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,919
fresh and start listening this isn't the

413
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,520
kind of audio where you listen to it

414
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,240
once and you're like okay that's it

415
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,120
because the tools are in there it's

416
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,840

everybody it's really important I'm

453
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,120
saying this

454
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,960
because it it's addictive and you'll

455
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,840
keep on going right but but taking what

456
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,640
you've learned to kind

457
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,640
of digested

458
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,840
assimilated this information is just so

459
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,080
powerful now here's here's something

460
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,200
interesting right here okay so I'm not

461
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,200
here to convince anyone that demons

462
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
exist

463
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,480
you hear the information you learn it

464
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,480
you tell

465
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:11,159
me you can believe in demons or you

466
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,880
don't have to believe in demons at

467
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:18,600
all it's fine with

468
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,360
me demons would prefer you don't believe

469
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,960
in

470
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,279
them that's what they would prefer

471
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,200
because that's what works best for

472
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,320
demons so they can do more damage on

473
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,000
your life in your life more damage to

474
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,840
people you know more damage to people

475
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,840
around you cause more problems on a

476
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,640
world scale cause more problems in every

477
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,720
way possible you not believing in demons

478
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,400
that's that's great for demons it's

479
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
actually really good for demons that's

480
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,000
the whole point they would prefer you

481
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,080
don't believe in them they would rather

482
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
have the experiences in someone's life

483
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:54,720
that are not agreeable to be blamed on

484
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,360
people blamed on you blamed on people so

485
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,039
you're blaming a

486
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,679
person when both of you have been

487
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,679
duped by a

488
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,159
demon demons would

489
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:16,440
love if the experiences you have that

490
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:20,159
are not agreeable are blamed on people

491
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,200
happen stance blamed on happen stance

492
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,520
freak

493
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,520
accidents instead of anybody thinking

494
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,240
about the possibility that demons even

495
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,279
exist oh they don't exist they don't

496
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,320
exist demons don't exist don't even need

497
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,880
to think they exist exactly don't worry

498
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,600
they're not affecting you on any level

499
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,200
or your family members or anybody else

500
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,159
in your life throughout the years but

501
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,000
yet that's what they would love for you

502
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,480
to believe that's the thing is with this

503
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,679
information it's so powerful you become

504
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,840
empowered and

505
00:22:51,679 --> 00:23:00,440
now you're learning how to conquer

506
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,440
Darkness it's just amazing

507
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,919

whole bit really really

537
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,600
incredible while listening to this audio

538
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,440
about demonic forces

539
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,279
don't get tangled up thinking that it's

540
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,520
about being

541
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,480
superstitious having to knock on wood

542
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,679
after you say something you're concerned

543
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,799
about is far different from the works

544
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,440
that demons and Fallen Angels do on this

545
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:45,440
planet so knocking on

546
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:52,080
wood is a lot different than what's

547
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,919
happening in the spiritual world the

548
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,000
Demonic forces the dark Forces the

549
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,120
Fallen Angels the falling angels and

550
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,440
what's happening and what they're doing

551
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,640
out there on a world scale too so you

552
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,159
can knock on W all you

553
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,520
want it's not going to tap into what's

554
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,760
going on around you or what's happening

555
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,760
out there this isn't sup

556
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,440
Superstition so I'm just just cutting

557
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,120
through a couple of little notes I had

558
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,760
there's so much information in the S and

559
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,399
1 half hours like I can't crack it all

560
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,919
like right here it's just impossible I

561
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:30,760
would have to be on here for probably

562
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,760
100 hours over time to crack into it to

563
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,679
talk ersay over there on IG says you

564
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,159

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,159
really just hearing it from from s so I

571
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,960
was like getting answers to questions

572
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,240
that I haven't even thought to ask it

573
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,600
was just coming together

574
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,640
Chi says over there at IG it's

575
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:10,600
validating a lot of

576
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,600
plus a lot of plus filling in gaps

577
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,320
whoa so I want to I want to um play for

578
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,360
you this Enlightenment

579
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,320
section just a little bit this this

580
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,960
little so I'm going to play this

581
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,480
realizes what the term Enlightenment

582
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,440
means

583
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,720
means enough goodness and

584
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:39,000
Consciousness and compassion when you're

585
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,000
alive that it lightens your

586
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:46,880
soul so I'm going to play this okay you

587
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,880
guys get it right here we're live by the

588
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,720
way no one realizes what the term

589
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:58,960
Enlightenment means it means enough

590
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,880
goodness

591
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,159
and

592
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,799
Consciousness and compassion when you're

593
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:11,000
alive that it lightens your soul so you

594
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:14,720
rise when you die so Enlightenment is

595
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,720
really a description of an elevating

596
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,279
Soul after you pass away a soul that

597
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,240
travels

598
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:28,840
upward the more enlightened that soul is

599
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,520
the more it gravitates upwards

600
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,840
the term Enlightenment really means the

601
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,159
soul is lightweight and not held down by

602
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,279
the gravity of Despair and darkness and

603
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:44,960
Despicable nature the gravity of

604
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:50,159
trickery and deceit of constant

605
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:53,080
betrayal Enlightenment means spring up

606
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,519
even if as a living person a soul

607
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,279
experience betrayals and battles with

608
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:02,440
darkness that could still rise up

609
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,480
when someone is not a good person their

610
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:09,559
soul bears that weight it's not

611
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,519
lightened it's holding toxic

612
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:16,080
baggage not the type of baggage of

613
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:18,080
what's happened to the soul the baggage

614
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,960
of what that Soul has

615
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,840
become true Enlightenment is compassion

616
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,760
and understanding someone's

617
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,000
suffering that makes the soul extremely

618
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,399
light

619
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,600
so it Springs upward

620
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:38,200
fast sometimes with the help of angels

621
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:42,039
possibly versus the soul being weighted

622
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:45,360
down and if the soul is not springing up

623
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:49,120
not enough Enlightenment is there it's

624
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,919
not being guided up on its

625
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,600
own so I wanted to play that for you

626
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:58,399
because that was one of my questions too

627
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,919
like what does Enlightenment even mean

628
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,120
and so powerful like the information

629
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,760
that came through and I I'll just read

630
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,240
it too I wanted you to hear it so you

631
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,080
know so that was on that's that is right

632
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,480
there the

633
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,640
audio Angels demons and spiritual tools

634
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,320
and you could find it like I said

635
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,799
audible on Amazon right now Spotify you

636
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,720
can get it off of Apple can find it

637
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:23,039
there but just get ready prepare

638
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,360
yourself maybe sit down maybe get some

639
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,679
lemon balm tea like I said said many

640
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,640
times in the past about anything that's

641
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,679
int tents get some lemon bomb tea that

642
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,600
would be really good fasten your seat

643
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,080
belts for

644
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,559
real definitely be sitting down when you

645
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:45,039
hear this for sure sitting

646
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,880
down no one realizes what the term

647
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,799
Enlightenment means because that's one

648
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,120
of the things that I got from SSC that

649
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:54,840
just just blew my mind it means enough

650
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,720
goodness and Consciousness and

651
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,640
compassion when you're alive when you're

652
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,240
alive

653
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,000
alive that it lightens your soul so you

654
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,159
rise when you

655
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,559
die that's that's Enlightenment it's not

656
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,440
the enlightenment that the spiritual

657
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,200
movement talks about now or you know

658
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,080
being enlightened enlightened in some

659
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,840
way having that Enlightenment it's

660
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:22,760
entirely different well Janna

661
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:26,240
says see laureli says who wrote the book

662
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,840
audio um Spirit of compassion's

663
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,279
information from above on the messenger

664
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,200
I took the information and compassion

665
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:38,519
when you're

666
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:42,600
alive Soul so you rise when you

667
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:45,080
die Enlightenment means having enough of

668
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,840
that compassion in your life time now so

669
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:52,960
that when you die it allows your soul to

670
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,519
spring up and Rise if your soul isn't

671
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,600
springing up and

672
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,919
Rising if it's not springing up and

673
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,919
Rising

674
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,519
say the enlightenment's not

675
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,000
there we're having like Tech problems

676
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,480
all kinds of funny stuff but I think

677
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,480
it's cleared

678
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,679
up and I want to say it again because

679
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,960
it's it's that

680
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,240
powerful so I saw somebody with a

681
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,919
question just now saying what do you

682
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,919
mean

683
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:35,039
so what's in the O what's in the audio

684
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,440
when you actually hear it okay and you

685
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,480
listen there's a part about

686
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,399
Enlightenment it's really powerful but

687
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,200
it's important because it plays a role

688
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,600
when we die when we leave this place I

689
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,320
know that young people think they'll be

690
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,799
here forever I get that I know young

691
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,159
people who feel like

692
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:55,880
indestructible and they just feel like

693
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,240
they'll probably be here forever you

694
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,919
know that that feeling you know when

695
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,480
you're 18 years old or 19 years old or

696
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,440
something but time goes by quick 100

697
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,240
years from

698
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,559
now we all leave 150 years from now

699
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,919
we're all leaving and when that time

700
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:16,960
happens Enlightenment is critical so

701
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,960
check this out I'll read this no one

702
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,039
realizes what the term Enlightenment

703
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,279
means it means enough goodness and

704
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,399
Consciousness and compassion when you're

705
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:32,480
alive that it like en your soul so you

706
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,480
rise when you

707
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,200
die so Enlightenment is really a

708
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:44,360
description of an elevating Soul after

709
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,200
you pass away a soul that travels upward

710
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,639
that's what enlightenment truly means

711
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,279
Spirit of compassion

712
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:55,159
says the more enlightened that soul

713
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:59,159
is your

714
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:03,799
soul the more it gravitates upwards so

715
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:06,880
you're not stuck here so you don't stay

716
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,559
here so the more Enlightenment the more

717
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,080
enlightened your soul

718
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,919
is the more it gravitates upwards so

719
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,919
you're not stuck

720
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,399
here the term Enlightenment really means

721
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,679
the soul is lightweight and not held

722
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:27,799
down by the gravity of Despair and

723
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:30,639
darkness and Despicable nature the gra

724
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:33,880
gra ity of trickery and deceit that

725
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:37,519
bears weight on the soul and keeps the

726
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:40,960
soul heavy and keeps the soul down so

727
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,279
after we die our soul is weighted down

728
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,480
with that deceit and that trickery it's

729
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,480
weighted down by that gravity of that

730
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,159
despair see guys I'm seeing someone said

731
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,880
you're saying the audio is cutting out

732
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,639
in YouTube go to rumble if it's cutting

733
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,600
out on YouTube so make sure you go to

734
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:09,240

735
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,159
rumble I'm I'm live on Rumble right

736
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,960
now Rosanna says demons are trying to

737
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,040
stop this information and this live I

738
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,520
feel them here wouldn't doubt it but

739
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:24,960
they didn't stop me from putting out the

740
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,560
audio and I worked hard on that and

741
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,159
spirit of compassion

742
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,679
did and and my publisher worked hard on

743
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,960
it too God blessed them and we got it

744
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,159
out and demons aren't going to like that

745
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,800
information out there indeed Fallen

746
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,440
Angels aren't going to like it dark

747
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,040
Forces aren't going to like it negative

748
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,240
energy negative entities aren't going to

749
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,240
like

750
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,040
it so the term Enlightenment really

751
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,359
means the soul is lightweight and not

752
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,679
held down by the gravity of Despair and

753
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,839
darkness and Despicable nature the

754
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,240
gravity of trickery and deceit of

755
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,960
constant betrayal Enlightenment means

756
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,920
spring up it means spring up even if as

757
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,760
a living person a soul experience

758
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,280
betrayals and battles within Darkness

759
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,599
they could still rise up that doesn't

760
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,359
stop them from rising up when someone is

761
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,599
not a good person that's different when

762
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,160
someone is not a good person just think

763
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,960
about that for a sec you're a good

764
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,520
person you're you're a good person but

765
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,320
when someone's not a good person their

766
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,720
soul bears that weight it's not

767
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,240
lightened so when somebody's a bad

768
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,680
person a terrible person cold-hearted

769
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,839
just a really bad person their soul is

770
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,240
going to bear that weight they're not

771
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:43,320
going to spring up it's holding toxic

772
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,320
baggage not the type of baggage of what

773
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,920
happens or what happened to the soul the

774
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,839
baggage of what that Soul has

775
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,520
become that's what it is true

776
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,640
Enlightenment is true Enlightenment is

777
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,960
compassion and understanding some

778
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,640
someone's

779
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,240
suffering that makes the soul extremely

780
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,079
light so it Springs upward fast with the

781
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,400
help of angels possibly versus a soul

782
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,520
being weighted

783
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,880
down that alone like takes time to

784
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,720
really understand and take that in I

785
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,839
know you guys get it you're but there's

786
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,200
a lot of people out there you're going

787
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,599
to have a hard time with that because

788
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,359
there're so intense there's so much

789
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,200
there in that piece of scripture alone

790
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:32,359
and the thing is about this information

791
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,680
from SSC when we dive into it I talk

792
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:36,119
about the medical books being scripture

793
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,160
like Health scripture and there's

794
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,800
spiritual scripture in there too this

795
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,040
right here is a whole another level of

796
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,640
scripture it's spiritual scripture for

797
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,599
sure it's from above it's answers to

798
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,640
questions that are mind-blowing

799
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,240
questions you may have had maybe your

800
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,240
whole life maybe questions you might

801
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,760
have had

802
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,920
recently but there's a lot to take in

803
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,560
here in the 7 and a half

804
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,040

incredible is that basically it's pretty

816
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,079

00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,720
so and Spotify is only available in

819
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,800
certain parts of the world so maybe you

820
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,599
don't get it in your part of the world

821
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,880
but maybe you get the other

822
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,880
options but

823
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,880
yeah but I would just go to audible on

824
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,359
on Amazon or go to Apple

825
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,200
so I want to I want you to hear this

826
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,200
other part too if you guys can for a

827
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,240
minute want to spend some time with you

828
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:17,760
guys so this this part is what is a

829
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,760
demon so these

830
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:23,720
traits are extremely self-centered

831
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,800
self-absorbed

832
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,839
selfish demons only care about

833
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,000
themselves and any Havoc they can wreak

834
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,280
to obtain self-satisfaction

835
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,040
demons have no compassion for others

836
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,200
they're anti-omp passionate no

837
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,800
compassion toward life itself not even

838
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,960
compassion toward animals no compassion

839
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,079
toward the sick or suffering no sympathy

840
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,119
no empathy no compassion they're

841
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:58,160
self-serving or fallen angel serving

842
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:00,880
only demons have these traits because

843
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,160
these were the traits they had when they

844
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,160
were

845
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,760
humans saw somebody say no sound I think

846
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,000
they were on YouTube go to

847
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,760
rumble you can't hear me say that I'm

848
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,760
sure but hopefully you try another

849
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,720
platform it's always fun to get schooled

850
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,720
by S

851
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:28,720
so all right so this this part here is

852
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,920
really

853
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,280
intense so if you guys if you want to

854
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,400
know I'm Anthony William this is Angels

855
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,960
demons and spiritual tools it's out now

856
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,400
you can look for it type in medical

857
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,599
medium Angel angels demons spiritual

858
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,319
tools you can do that on you know

859
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:53,480
audible Apple it's an original

860
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:57,040
audio um audible Amazon or apple or

861
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,400
Spotify okay what is a demon a demon is

862
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,040
what human soul becomes after death if

863
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,000
that Soul was completely engulfed by

864
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,760
certain traits when they were a living

865
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,760
person so what I got from Spirit of

866
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:15,920
compassion concrete just solidified

867
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,359
information when I just said what is a

868
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,640
demon and that information is

869
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,079
people people become

870
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:28,200
demons it's really sad it's disturbing

871
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,839
in a lot of ways

872
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,720
it's

873
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,079
terrible but humans become demons so

874
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,400
that's that piece of information that's

875
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,400
really interesting and they become

876
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:43,680
demons after death if their soul was

877
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,599
completely engulfed

878
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:50,280
and there you

879
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:53,720
go on YouTube Rumble you guys that's

880
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,720
what it looks like

881
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,440
I'm seeing questions and I'm like wait

882
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,400
till you guys wait till you guys hear

883
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,240
the audio I'm seeing certain questions

884
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:13,079
I'm like do you guys hear the

885
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,680
audio Yeah right then in their demon

886
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,599
form these traits stayed with them so

887
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:22,319
think about this okay so humans become

888
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,760
demons and then in their demon form

889
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,720
their human traits stayed with them in

890
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,200
the demon form these traits stay with

891
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,240
them demons are extremely

892
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,640
self-centered

893
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,839
self-absorbed that's interesting

894
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,079
self-centered self-absorbed selfish

895
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:44,280
demons only care about

896
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:48,440
themselves and any Havoc they can wreak

897
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:50,359
to obtain self-satisfaction so humans

898
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,960
who get self-satisfaction

899
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:56,400
and doing some bad things have the

900
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,680
potential to become demons when they

901
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,640
leave here but it's more than that

902
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,119
because it's there's more information

903
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,000
than that so when you hear that there's

904
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,800
nuances there's details you got to hear

905
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,800
the audio for it

906
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,520
all so demons only care about themselves

907
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,599
and any Havoc they can wreak to optain

908
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,960
self-satisfaction Demons have no

909
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:22,400
compassion for others no compassion

910
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,559
whatsoever they're anti-

911
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,160
compassionate no compassion toward life

912
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:32,359
itself not even compassion toward

913
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,359
animals it's important to know so when

914
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:37,000
humans were in their human form when

915
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,240
humans were here their soul was in their

916
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,760
physical human form here they had no

917
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:45,000
compassion for animals they became a

918
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,000
demon later after

919
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,359
death no compassion toward the sick or

920
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,160
suffering no sympathy no empathy no

921
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:58,400
compassion they're selfs

922
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,359
serving or Fallen Angel serving only so

923
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,559
that's another thing on its own so in

924
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:04,880
this audio you're going to hear about

925
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,040
fallen angels and falling angels too

926
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,720
there's two different things there's

927
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,599
falling angels and Fallen Angels they

928
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,960
are two different things and then

929
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,319
there's God's angels so that's important

930
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,720
to know and in this audio you're going

931
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,640
to learn about all three of

932
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:23,880
those but a human being

933
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:26,880
here a terrible Soul a terrible person

934
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,040
can die that way not grow not move

935
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,559
forward spiritually die become a demon

936
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,760
and I talk about the details on how that

937
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:36,960
happens it's really intense in the 7 and

938
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,359
1/ half hour audio they become a demon

939
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,599
and then they're either self-serving for

940
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:47,839
themselves as a demon like a rogue demon

941
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,559
or they are working for fallen angels I

942
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,559
talk about it in

943
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:56,079
detail demons have these traits because

944
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,000
these were the traits they had when they

945
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,240
were humans

946
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,240
a human soul is eligible to become a

947
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:07,119
demon after death if that Soul while in

948
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,640
a living breathing human was partaken

949
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,200
partaking in some disturbing and

950
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,040
uncompassionate practices and enjoyed

951
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,880
the harm or suffering within those

952
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,359
practices did you guys hear that right

953
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,520

a human soul is eligible to become a

959
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:40,000
demon after death if that Soul while in

960
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:43,240
a living breathing human was partaking

961
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,520
in some disturbing and uncompassionate

962
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,440
practices and enjoy the harm or

963
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:52,240
suffering within those

964
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:54,720

965
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,960

thing like people say the word but they

1108
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:23,920
don't know what it is and asking Spirit

1109
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,760

1110
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,319
