95
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,759
Earth humans want to indulge in the

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,440
things they love it's called

97
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,600
addictions doesn't matter if it's food

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,360
doesn't matter if it's something else

they love to indulge

102
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,240
and then so many of us have emotional

103
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:08,240
injuries around food whether being told

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,440
when they were a child not to eat a

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,560
certain food or being

106
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,360
force-fed a certain food or just being

107
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,639
told you have to eat this food or you

108
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,080
take food that was given to you to go to

109
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,280
school with and it's the only food you

110
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,560
have so you have to eat it and then

111
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,840
maybe you get sick of it so as you grow

112
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,000
up and get older you're like I'm never

113
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,280
going to eat that sandwich ever again

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,160
and then if somebody comes from a family

115
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,400
that didn't have enough money to buy

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,960
certain foods and they only had certain

117
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,160
foods to eat that were on the table and

118
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,919
that was what was there and you couldn't

119
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,720
do anything about it that can create an

120
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,199
emotional injury around food as well and

121
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,400

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,240
and you want to eat differently because

123
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,080

forebears waited in line during the

162
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,919
Depression for a loaf of bread and they

163
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,360
never forgot that they passed the

164
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,319
stories on and along those stories went

165
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,879

feel meanwhile somebody on the other

191
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,399
side of the world is suffering suffering

192
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,959
all huddled together in some Dwelling my

193
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,399
bombs are going off or there's just no

194
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,600
way to get any food and they're really

195
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,680
struggling they have nothing to eat

196
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,320
maybe haven't eaten in weeks and then

197
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,440
you see it on social these people

198
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,200
they'll blame their fears they'll blame

199
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,440
their concerns they'll blame their

200
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,600
worries they'll blame their problems

201
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,440
they'll blame people they'll blame the

202
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,760
healthy diet they're eating they'll

203
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,000
blame anything and everything they'll

204
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,279
blame it all on their food and there are

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,920
endless variations of emotional wounds

206
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,480
that people have things that have

207
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,200
happened in their life things that have

208
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,240
happened in school things that have

209
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,399
happened because of their friends things

210
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,600
that have happened because of their

211
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:41,160
family experiences struggles hardships

212
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,040
it ends up making a massive amount of

213
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,600
combinations of issues that can all get

214
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:51,279
funneled into food in the end and not

215
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,880
only can someone have endless emotional

216
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,160
injuries they can also have something

217
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,440
physically going on different level of

218
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,120
toxins poisons exposures Pharmaceuticals

219
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,360
in their life all through their life

220
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,640
everything and anything from toxic heavy

221
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,079
metals other contamination that gets

222
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,079
into the brain in their body and that

223
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:14,959
can alter how they see food or even

224
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:17,079
taste food no two people are the same no

225
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,720
two people have the same experiences

226
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:23,720
emotionally physically there are endless

227
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,480
endless combinations of experiences and

228
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,360
this plays a role in how they taste and

229
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,279
seafood if you're with a friend or a

230
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,680
family member and you're eating the same

231
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,040
Pizza they're eating and both of you are

232
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,440
enjoying it

233
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,160
immensely your family member is saying

234
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,639
how much they love it they're eating it

235
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,680
it tastes so good it's a great pizza

236
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,040

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,560
incredible this stuff is Bomb it is

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,720
delicious it is amazing I'm going to buy

another pizza here and both of you are

240
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,000
enjoying it both of you are not tasting

241
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,959
the same thing as you're eating it

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,240
you're connect it you know what you're

243
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,440
tasting you're enjoying it little sweet

244
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,240
little salty nice and doughy you're

245
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,639
tasting the sauce you taste the cheese

246
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,760
you can taste a little bit of Basil it's

247
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,519
hitting your

248
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,399
brain you're in love with this slice of

249
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,920
pizza as it's going down you're trying

250
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,079
to hold back you're trying not to shove

251
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,519
it all down at once you're trying to

252
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,800
take your time a little bit but you can

253
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,160
taste it and you know what you're

254
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,240
tasting to a degree you may not be an

255
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,839
expert at all all the flavor profiles

256
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,639
but you feel it and you know it and at

257
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,040
the same time the person that you're

258
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,839
eating with is experiencing the same

259
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,639
thing in that way they have a connection

260
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,720
they taste a little bit of the basil

261
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,399
they taste the sauce they taste the

262
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,040
sweetness of the sauce they taste the

263
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,760
cheese they like their crust they're

264
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,120
enjoying it they love it but what you're

265
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,360
tasting is not what they're tasting both

266
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,440
of you are tasting two different things

267
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,959
our brains control our experience they

268
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,800
control the flavor our tongues those are

269
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,160
just

270
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,680
tools our tongues as a tool could get

271
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,560
dirty and when they get dirty like if we

272
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,560
have a stick of gum or we smoke a

273
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,079
cigarette it can alter the taste buds

274
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,839
but still it's all deriving from our

275
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:27,560
brain yes we can saturate our tool which

276
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:30,680
is our tongue we can contaminate it it

277
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,839
can get dirty with other things and

278
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,360
toxins cigarette smoke different

279
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,680
artificial flavorings it can alter it as

280
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,279
far as as a tool but that's as far as it

281
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,920
goes the brain is where it's all

282
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:47,600
happening with flavor contamination

283
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,360
Place aside the controls and the

284
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,920
experience come from the brain central

285
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:57,000
nervous system signals travel back and

286
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,880
forth between the cranial nerves so if

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,399
there's any kind of interference in the

288
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,680
brain

289
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,519
like toxic heavy metals something toxic

290
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,360
inside the brain then it can alter how

291
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,040
we perceive flavors inside our mouth

292
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,959
because the cranial nerves either become

293
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,399
poisoned or neurons sending messages to

294
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,399
these nerves become poisoned so if the

295
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,839
brain has any kind of solvents MSG toxic

296
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:27,360
heavy metals petrochemicals pesticides

297
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:31,680
herbicides other toxic chemicals or

298
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,720
viral neurotoxins from hsv1 or any virus

299
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,320
stored up in brain tissue then that can

300
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,600
affect whether someone likes or dislikes

301
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,480
certain foods and drink and if someone

302
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,519
has an elevated amount of mercury inside

303
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,360
their brain and it's affecting their

304
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,240
cranial nerves in any way possible it

305
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,240
can change how cilantro tastes it can

306
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,120
make it so cilantro is not pleasing

307
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,160
doesn't have a good flavor doesn't taste

308
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,560
good doesn't feel feel good on the

309
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,120
pallet until the Mercury is going away

310
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,639
so as the Mercury is decreasing and the

311
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,199
metals are leaving the brain cilantro

312
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,079
starts to become pleasing agreeable this

313
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,720
can change and alter depending on where

314
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,839
the Mercury is but there are thousands

315
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,000
and thousands of testimonials from

316
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,920
people who are doing the medical medium

317
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,639
heavy metal detox and as they're doing

318
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,079
it they start out hating cilantro or

319
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,079
they always did hate cilantro and as

320
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,480
they go along and they're getting rid of

321
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,360
the Mercury the toxic heavy metals

322
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,720
what's happening is they all of a sudden

323
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,560
become in love with cilantro it's

324
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,680
pleasing it's agreeable they like it and

325
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,399
it becomes part of their life as if they

326
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,240
should have never had it out of their

327
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,399
diet to begin with they love it now

328
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,320
contaminants do other things inside

329
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,320
people's brains not just alter the

330
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,120
fever but Al alter things like

331
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,199
consistency issues like someone will be

332
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,920
like I don't like avocado cuz I don't

333
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,120
like the texture I don't like anything

334
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,720
mushy I can't do it I only like crunchy

335
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,000
things or I like to sink my teeth in

336
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,279
something and if I can't sink my teeth

337
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,279
into it then I'm not going to like it

338
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,000
these are messages coming from the brain

339
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,759
and a lot of those messages can be

340
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,240
derived from the toxic heavy metals

341
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,480
inside the brain rerouting electrical

342
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,959
impulses messing with

343
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,959
neurotransmitters and a combination of

344
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,800
emotional injuries throughout life

345
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,560
whether from childhood or adulthood but

346
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,000
the combination of emotional issues

347
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,720
emotional injuries combination of that

348
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,120
plus the toxic heavy metals and other

349
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,040
contaminants all put together make it so

350
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,600
there are millions and millions and

351
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,120
billions of combinations of how people

352
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,079
see food feel food taste food and enjoy

353
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,160
food back 2,000 years ago if you were an

354
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,920
emperor and you were given by your

355
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,600
medicine man a Mercury Elixir cuz that's

356
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,639
what happened back then to treat any

357
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,959
kind of issues and that mercury Elixir

358
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:18,000
altered your taste where you can taste

359
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,319
food differently and it's not the same

360
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,959
and your Chef who made you the same meal

361
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:26,040
that you like every day gives you that

362
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,759
same meal and you tasted it and it was

363
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,440
awful and tasted like poison you would

364
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,720
then then chop off that Chef's head

365
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,279
that's how serious people are about food

366
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,519
going all the way back dead serious here

367
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:43,639
on planet Earth taste can be the

368
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,240
ultimate controller it can determine how

369
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,839
you're going to heal what you're going

370
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,880
to do for yourself there are people in

371
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,120
the world that could have healed if they

372
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,720
can get past their

373
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:02,720
taste people naturally do not like leafy

374
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,600
greens people naturally do not like a

375
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,880
bitter leafy green people don't like

376
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,400
lettuce they have to have the lettuce

377
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:17,959
drowned out by a dressing or cheese or

378
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:22,039
eggs or some sort of oil vinegar lots of

379
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:25,520
salt some sugar dressings that aren't

380
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:28,400
good for them people can't just eat a

381
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,880
leafy green on its own it's not easy

382
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,799
it's not desirable a piece of kale a

383
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,960
collared green most people have trouble

384
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,720
just eating a piece of fruit an apple a

385
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,360
berry sure they'll eat it if you give it

386
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,799
to them it's in their hand they'll eat

387
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,360
it they'll chew it but in the end they

388
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,559
don't want to sit there and eat apples

389
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,000
all day and they don't want to sit there

390
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,919
and eat raspberries all day they don't

391
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,280
want to sit there and eat melons all day

392
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,400
they don't want to eat really any fruit

393
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,919
and if they eat a piece of fruit they

394
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,799
want to offset it pretty shortly after

395
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,799
with something like chicken salad or

396
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,039
something else a hamburger or something

397
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,960
else it's not something people really

398
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:18,400
want to do it's eat a leafy green or eat

399
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,960
a piece of fruit a plum an apple a

400
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,240
cherry a berry for example if somebody

401
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,880
drinks a smoothie they want milk in that

402
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,120
smoothie they want peanut butter in that

403
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,240
smoothie they want kefir and that

404
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,679
smoothie yogurt they want something in

405
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,760
there something that kind of brings the

406
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,039
temperature down brings their worries

407
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,360
down the worry of tasting something like

408
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:47,960
an astringent fruit or a bitter green

409
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,200
that's the worry it becomes a smoothie

410
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,960
where it's just a protein based smoothie

411
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,840
with something in there like milk and

412
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,440
dairy and yogurt and nut Butters and

413
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,720
oils and they want to wash down the

414
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,400
medicine away with all of that fat and

415
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,400
all of that Dairy and then when you say

416
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,679
hey how about a sweet potato if you had

417
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,240
one of those and they would say I don't

418
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,880
like the texture I hate yams I can't eat

419
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,360
a sweet potato can I put something on it

420
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,280
can I eat it with something or how about

421
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,919
a potato a plain potato I can't eat a

422
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,840
potato plain I need to have sour cream

423
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:31,120
on it some cheese some other things on

424
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,320
there some yogurt or something hey how

425
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,480
about a avocado I'm like I don't like

426
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,679
the mushy texture I don't like the

427
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,919
consistency I can't stand guacamole I've

428
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,840
heard so many different things from so

429
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,840
many different people and it gets in

430
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,440
their way of healing and I call it the

431
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,039
taste demon and one of the reasons why I

432
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,840
call it the taste demon is because of

433
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,919
the trickery that goes on with it you

434
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,960
tell somebody why don't you try some

435
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,200
avocado they say it's too mushy they

436
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,360
don't like the texture but then later on

437
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,320
at night they're eating an ice cream in

438
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,919
front of the TV someone will say they

439
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,960
like crunch they like crunchy things

440
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,559
they like chips and they can't get off

441
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,080
their chips they need it it's like their

442
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,960
therapy and I'll say why don't we do

443
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,360
some dehydrated apple chips they're

444
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,320
crunchy they're delicious and they'll

445
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,480
say no I'll say to somebody are you

446
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,200
eating that salad every day that I was

447
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,080
tell telling you about are you making

448
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,240
that salad they'll say yes I'm having my

449
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:39,360
salad every single day and I still don't

450
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,799
feel good aw how come and I'll sit there

451
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,799
and I'll scratch my head and then s so

452
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,440
will say because their salad has changed

453
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,559
it's got pieces of ham in there pieces

454
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,480
of egg in there and I'll ask them what

455
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,000
happened to your salad what's in there

456
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,080
and they'll be like well I just feel

457
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,760
like I need more protein so I'm just

458
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,280
switching the chickpeas instead of the

459
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,919
garbanza beans she told me about I'm now

460
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,480
putting ham in there and um and I have

461
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:12,400
croutons in there too and I'll be like

462
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,039
well the croutons are the gluten

463
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,600
remember the gluten was bothering you

464
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,919
and be like yeah I can't help it I can't

465
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,799
eat the salad any other way The Taste

466
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,679
demon I'll say to someone you can have

467
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:29,840
your celery juice in the morning you can

468
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:32,120
have your hmds in the morning morning

469
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,440
you can have some steamed potatoes for

470
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,640
lunch if you really want or a later

471
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,159

472
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,760
oh no I can't eat that much in the

473
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,360

474
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,440
morning ever I need to be not eating it

475
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,240

like that say okay okay I respect that

477
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,960

486
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,640
Danish I thought you didn't eat though I

487
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,679
thought you weren't eating in the

488
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,120
morning so you're not going to do the

489
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,080
celery juice or the hmds but 3 days

490
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,159
later you're going to eat a pizza at

491
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,720
noon and you're going to eat a whole

492
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,840
bunch of danishes and so forth this is

493
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,520
the workings of The Taste demon and then

494
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,960
I'm talking to somebody and they're like

495
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:37,320

I only eat it's only grass-fed beef aw

497
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,360
and free range pasture raised chickens

498
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,760
it's the only thing I eat it's those

499
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,440

every day like well been eating my usual

503
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,760

504
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,880
went to a restaurant with a friend like

505
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:05,279

506
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:08,200

00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:11,720
know I I actually didn't ask you know

508
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,960
we're just out and whatever The Taste

509
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,679
demon could go on and on forever so many

510
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,760
different variables variations so many

511
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,559
different Antics and so much trickery

512
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,240
and that's how the taste demon works and

513
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,120
this can get in the way of people

514
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,400
heading to the Finish Line to heal

515
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,200
people who just can't get past it the

516
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,880
taste demon takes over and they gobble

517
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,760
down that chocolate bar they gobble down

518
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,320
that chocolate cake they drink their

519
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,679
coffee every single day they eat

520
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,679
something that isn't helping them they

521
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,799
do something that's not helping them in

522
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,480
health they take something that's not

523
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:55,520
helping them and that same taste demon

524
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,720
will even turn that person against

525
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,120
somebody because they want to protect

526
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,400
their food

527
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,640
or their

528
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,360
addictions or their

529
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,159
indulgences they want to protect it till

530
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,200
the cows come home and they'll blame

531
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,960
somebody else or something else is

532
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,279
causing their problems and causing their

533
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,880
sickness and causing their poor health

534
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,520
and their poor mental health it's the

535
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,159

pointing your butter knife at me you're

575
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:22,760
disappointed because the meal is too

576
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,440
soggy and

577
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,679
overdone just because you can't cut the

578
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:33,640
kiche and the knife is bending you're

579
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:38,080
done what Have We Become overrun by our

580
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:40,919
taste buds and their elected taste fun

581
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,559
doesn't matter if the meal was

582
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:48,919
Homespun a bad meal has been known in

583
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:53,679
history to make a person take out a gun

584
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:56,799
in olden times if the king queen Emperor

585
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:00,159
had a bad meal the chef would not just

586
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:04,240
be fired the chef would be burned at the

587
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:08,120
stake by fire the next one hired a year

588
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:11,480
later would also expire and around and

589
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,720
around it would go food becomes death

590
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:18,200
defying and treacherous but the same

591
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,840
time because the taste demons already

592
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,000
exist in everyone's mind we protect our

593
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,480
ways of eating and almost never give up

594
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,679
our favorite feedings until one day

595
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,399
we're too sick enough to learn how to

596
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,159
refeed ourselves so our bodies reverse

597
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:38,159
