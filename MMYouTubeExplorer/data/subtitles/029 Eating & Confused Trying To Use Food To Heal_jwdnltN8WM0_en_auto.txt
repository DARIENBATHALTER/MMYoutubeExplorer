[48.12 - 52.72] digestion has been a mystery to research
[50.40 - 56.16] in science since the beginning of
[52.72 - 59.56] research in science and nowadays it's
[56.16 - 62.72] all about our gut all their problems are
[59.56 - 65.08] because because of our gut we're told
[62.72 - 69.00] but what do we really know about our
[65.08 - 72.32] digestive system how much do we not know
[69.00 - 76.52] where does it matter where does it make
[72.32 - 79.04] or break us from healing or dying what
[76.52 - 81.24] about more things happening inside our
[79.04 - 83.68] gut than we could ever even imagine that

[171.84 - 176.32] line of people there and one pie after
[174.40 - 177.92] another and they got it all over their
[176.32 - 180.60] face and they're gobbling it down and
[177.92 - 182.64] chomping it down or better yet maybe an
[180.60 - 184.44] eating contest where it's a hot dog
[182.64 - 186.76] eating contest right where there's this
[184.44 - 190.56] plate in front of the person that has
[186.76 - 193.20] like 100 hot dogs and everybody's lined
[190.56 - 195.04] up and the goal is to eat the hot dogs
[193.20 - 197.12] as fast as possible and you see some
[195.04 - 198.96] guys they shove the hot dog down and the
[197.12 - 201.12] whole hot dog slides down their throat
[198.96 - 202.60] they didn't even chew it more than once
[201.12 - 205.16] and they just got to shove it in as fast
[202.60 - 207.24] as possible or maybe there's what is
[205.16 - 210.16] there there's other ones too where a
[207.24 - 212.64] whole bunch of tacos I saw one on TV
[210.16 - 215.36] there was a whole bunch of tacos and a
[212.64 - 217.00] guy ate like a 100 tacos and and you
[215.36 - 218.84] couldn't leave a mess on the plate they
[217.00 - 220.36] said at the end of the con like during
[218.84 - 221.80] the contest they said the whole plate
[220.36 - 223.92] has to be cleaned and one guy didn't
[221.80 - 226.16] clean the whole plate so he lost there
[223.92 - 227.88] was like a couple of tomatoes left and a
[226.16 - 229.80] little bit of guacamole and some beans
[227.88 - 232.40] and some meat sauce all left in the
[229.80 - 235.24] plate and and then there's restaurants
[232.40 - 237.32] that say you can eat for free if you
[235.24 - 238.92] finish what they're selling right like
[237.32 - 241.08] you look on the menu and they sell
[238.92 - 244.60] something called the big big boy and
[241.08 - 247.36] it's 10 lbs of chopped meat with like 50
[244.60 - 250.24] meatballs wrapped around it pile of
[247.36 - 252.92] sausage and I don't know and a whole
[250.24 - 254.80] barrel of beans right and if you can
[252.92 - 257.00] finish that your whole family can eat
[254.80 - 258.68] for free but you got to be one person
[257.00 - 261.36] sitting there at the table and they only
[258.68 - 263.56] give you like two hours so you sit there
[261.36 - 265.92] eating it and if you can get to the end
[263.56 - 269.12] of that then the whole family eats for
[265.92 - 271.04] free you know a friend of mine he didn't
[269.12 - 272.92] do that but his friend did that at a
[271.04 - 275.60] restaurant where they brought out this
[272.92 - 278.80] massive 20 lb steak I don't know what it
[275.60 - 280.28] was it was just so huge he said and he
[278.80 - 282.12] sat there eating his friend sat there
[280.28 - 284.92] eating it and eating it so that they
[282.12 - 286.40] would be having a free meal he would win
[284.92 - 288.92] in the end and he was eating it eating
[286.40 - 290.92] it they had to rush him to the hospital
[288.92 - 293.20] because he had this stomach cramp that
[290.92 - 295.60] was so bad my friend told me that he
[293.20 - 298.12] fell on the floor and he was in fetal
[295.60 - 300.52] position on the floor trying to pass gas
[298.12 - 303.08] and everybody in the restroom got scared
[300.52 - 305.08] and the whole crowd gathered around him
[303.08 - 307.64] as he was trying to push gas out of his
[305.08 - 310.28] stomach and he was farting and then he
[307.64 - 312.32] was kind of like an Agony moaning and
[310.28 - 315.56] yelling my friend said it was so bad
[312.32 - 317.64] they had a call Emergency Services 911
[315.56 - 319.56] now this guy was only halfway through
[317.64 - 321.04] his stake and he was a really big guy
[319.56 - 323.68] meaning like he was
[321.04 - 327.48] 6'4 he was like
[323.68 - 330.40] 240 lbs uh he had some muscle on him and
[327.48 - 332.64] everything and but he was known by his
[330.40 - 335.24] friends to be able to eat a lot as much
[332.64 - 336.96] as he wanted and drink too so he can
[335.24 - 340.92] drink a whole bunch of beer and eat all
[336.96 - 343.52] that now he said this is from him he
[340.92 - 346.00] said that the reason why it happened was
[343.52 - 347.76] because he ate something before this big
[346.00 - 349.08] dinner he was eating and he knew not to
[347.76 - 351.00] do it it's like one of those things
[349.08 - 353.52] where you know better and you know you
[351.00 - 355.36] shouldn't have or maybe postpone it and
[353.52 - 357.44] do it another day at the restaurant but
[355.36 - 359.68] he said he couldn't help it he wanted
[357.44 - 361.68] the challenge but he had something
[359.68 - 363.56] before it he had a cheeseburger an hour
[361.68 - 365.84] before it and he said that didn't sit
[363.56 - 368.72] right on top of what he was putting down
[365.84 - 372.96] in and like I said this guy was a big
[368.72 - 375.16] guy 6'4 body mass like big which leads
[372.96 - 379.16] me to this other thing which makes me
[375.16 - 381.28] scratch my head confounds me really is I
[379.16 - 383.24] saw an eating contest and it's a bunch
[381.28 - 385.56] of people lined up it was on television
[383.24 - 388.28] it was like many years ago and there was
[385.56 - 390.44] this woman with a bunch of men so there
[388.28 - 393.32] was a bunch of men and they're all big
[390.44 - 395.84] guys and then there was this woman she
[393.32 - 397.16] was in the contest sitting at a table
[395.84 - 400.00] and they were all going to eat the same
[397.16 - 402.04] thing it was like I don't know a 5B
[400.00 - 403.76] Burger something crazy it was something
[402.04 - 407.24] that you just can't eat it's actually
[403.76 - 409.48] scary and she won the contest which was
[407.24 - 412.28] crazy to me because she was with all
[409.48 - 414.96] these other guys they were big guys some
[412.28 - 418.20] of them were like six feet tall 6 foot
[414.96 - 419.68] like five or just really big guys and
[418.20 - 424.64] that means their stomach was probably
[419.68 - 427.88] really big she was like 105 lb and when
[424.64 - 431.36] I think about that it boggled my mind I
[427.88 - 434.44] watched it and I was like Spirit just
[431.36 - 437.20] tell me what's going on here and what
[434.44 - 439.80] was amazing is she could stretch her
[437.20 - 442.44] stomach her stomach was stretching now I
[439.80 - 444.72] always knew that your stomach stretches
[442.44 - 447.96] absolutely people can eat a lot more and
[444.72 - 449.88] you stretch your stomach more but there
[447.96 - 452.64] was a vast difference here
[449.88 - 456.36] with who was at this table there were
[452.64 - 459.40] people that were much much bigger men
[456.36 - 463.64] large stomachs eating a lot and she was
[459.40 - 467.52] small petite and ate the same thing and
[463.64 - 469.84] that's the miracle of the human body
[467.52 - 473.04] that's the miracle of our digestive
[469.84 - 476.00] system that's the superior strength of
[473.04 - 480.04] our stomachs the world's not an easy
[476.00 - 484.96] place to live confrontation obstacle
[480.04 - 487.96] trials losses hardships betrayal that's
[484.96 - 491.20] a big one right there so many people get
[487.96 - 497.08] betrayed all through their life and in
[491.20 - 502.36] this we tend to use food as a drug a
[497.08 - 506.40] pill to sweep us away into a safe place
[502.36 - 509.00] stress can do this and some of us we
[506.40 - 511.28] overeat everybody experienced that
[509.00 - 513.52] before or it's easy to do just run
[511.28 - 516.56] across a little bit of stress have a
[513.52 - 519.20] little bit of hardship hard times and
[516.56 - 521.64] you see something and there it is
[519.20 - 524.24] there's that chocolate cake there's that
[521.64 - 527.48] Bagel there's that double deck or
[524.24 - 530.44] whatever there's that croissant whatever
[527.48 - 532.84] it is it's easy to fall prey to it it's
[530.44 - 536.00] not even just that you might be saying I
[532.84 - 538.88] don't eat croissants aw I don't eat
[536.00 - 541.80] double decker cake whatever that is I
[538.88 - 544.92] eat a whole big batch of macaroni and
[541.80 - 549.56] cheese and I can't stop and I keep on
[544.92 - 554.04] shoveling it in I eat a whole pizza not
[549.56 - 557.16] a half a pizza or I eat too many slices
[554.04 - 560.68] everybody has their own method it's a
[557.16 - 563.48] survival method we tend to overeat hey
[560.68 - 565.80] no judgment that's just life here and
[563.48 - 569.20] wait you might be somebody that doesn't
[565.80 - 571.60] overeat like that but you undereat you
[569.20 - 573.88] don't eat stress comes along some
[571.60 - 576.36] confrontation some hardship some
[573.88 - 579.24] adversity maybe just a difficult time in
[576.36 - 582.24] your life maybe you were betrayed and it
[579.24 - 584.92] felt so terrible in the pit of your
[582.24 - 588.36] stomach food was the last thing you
[584.92 - 591.04] wanted and even as time kind of went by
[588.36 - 593.40] and the Betrayal kind of eased off you
[591.04 - 596.28] still weren't that hungry to want to
[593.40 - 598.88] tank or eat a large amount of food at
[596.28 - 601.72] once so you're the kind of person to
[598.88 - 604.80] just just eat a little bit kind of just
[601.72 - 607.60] for survival along the way that happens
[604.80 - 610.64] too A lot of people run into this and
[607.60 - 613.20] they just have that pit of stomach nerve
[610.64 - 616.84] nausea the upset you feel like your
[613.20 - 619.08] heart was swallowed and it ended up in
[616.84 - 622.08] the pity of your stomach and the last
[619.08 - 624.60] thing you want to do is actually eat now
[622.08 - 627.96] why am I even talking about all this
[624.60 - 630.96] because our stomach has to do what we
[627.96 - 634.92] tell it to do it has to do whatever we
[630.96 - 637.96] say or do it doesn't matter it has to
[634.92 - 640.28] listen it has to obey because it's
[637.96 - 643.52] sitting there it's not going to be able
[640.28 - 645.96] to stop you it can't say hey don't do
[643.52 - 648.92] that or whoa you're stretching me man
[645.96 - 651.92] you're stretching me way too far or hey
[648.92 - 654.92] I'm shrinking I'm shrinking over here
[651.92 - 658.12] and I'm getting smaller and smaller or
[654.92 - 659.68] whoa you stretched me way too fast whoa
[658.12 - 663.08] that was a lot you put in in there just
[659.68 - 664.60] now or oh my God I'm shrinking so much I
[663.08 - 666.00] think I'm going to disappear on you
[664.60 - 667.80] right now I think you got to put
[666.00 - 670.28] something in the tank I know you got
[667.80 - 672.60] some emotional stuff going on right now
[670.28 - 675.48] I know you got hardships but you got to
[672.60 - 679.40] put something in me our stomach is under
[675.48 - 682.60] our beck and call it's under our roof so
[679.40 - 684.96] when we swallow something it has no say
[682.60 - 688.08] no say to what's coming down the pike it
[684.96 - 691.04] just has to grin and bear it take the
[688.08 - 693.12] brunt and maybe you're someone that
[691.04 - 696.28] doesn't think I'm right about this
[693.12 - 698.16] thinking I'm off the mark But I think we
[696.28 - 701.28] got to have some respect for our
[698.16 - 704.24] stomachs because our stomachs get
[701.28 - 706.20] disrespected I'm wrong well you know
[704.24 - 710.24] what I think about those stories you
[706.20 - 713.24] always hear out there where it's College
[710.24 - 715.40] it's a party someone sticks a pipe down
[713.24 - 718.64] their throat someone's standing on a
[715.40 - 721.00] ladder or a chair and they're dumping
[718.64 - 723.36] all the this beer and alcohol down the
[721.00 - 726.24] pike and someone's on the floor on their
[723.36 - 727.96] knees looking up pipes in their throat
[726.24 - 729.88] and they're trying to send it all down
[727.96 - 732.52] into their stomach one shot and then
[729.88 - 735.24] everybody screaming and then the pipe
[732.52 - 737.12] flies out and spit goes everywhere it's
[735.24 - 739.40] like do it again and someone else gets
[737.12 - 742.92] there and does it again and then a few
[739.40 - 744.92] hours later shove a pizza down the pike
[742.92 - 747.20] down the gullet think about that
[744.92 - 749.00] person's poor stomach but people don't
[747.20 - 750.96] really think about people's poor stomach
[749.00 - 753.32] they think about people they're like oh
[750.96 - 756.40] wow that person had a great time or that
[753.32 - 758.08] person overdid it that person did yeah
[756.40 - 760.00] that person did way too much oh they're
[758.08 - 762.92] kind of sick the next day but no one's
[760.00 - 765.20] saying hey that person's stomach is shot
[762.92 - 767.40] today hey that person's stomach is
[765.20 - 769.64] really not feeling great today that
[767.40 - 771.56] person's stomach went through hell last
[769.64 - 774.40] night you should talk to that person's
[771.56 - 777.76] stomach hey stomach are you okay in
[774.40 - 779.56] there no one's doing that no one cares I
[777.76 - 782.24] get it I get it this isn't you you don't
[779.56 - 784.68] binge out or you never did anything like
[782.24 - 787.56] this you're more balanced you're more
[784.68 - 789.68] moderation or self-care day right so
[787.56 - 793.40] yours is about well here's my self-care
[789.68 - 797.08] day or here's my cheat day or here's my
[793.40 - 800.60] moderation day um but you're the one
[797.08 - 802.92] governing it right your stomach still
[800.60 - 807.56] has to be at your beck and call your
[802.92 - 809.36] stomach still has to be at your mercy at
[807.56 - 813.20] your mercy
[809.36 - 817.40] and maybe your cheat day oh sorry maybe
[813.20 - 818.80] your self-care day or maybe your balance
[817.40 - 820.16] day or moderation day because
[818.80 - 821.60] everybody's calling it different now
[820.16 - 825.56] different things it used to be called
[821.60 - 827.92] cheat day so so maybe your self-care day
[825.56 - 830.56] is different than somebody else's
[827.92 - 833.56] self-care day or maybe your stomach
[830.56 - 836.28] doesn't like your self-care day but you
[833.56 - 838.40] like your self-care day maybe you like
[836.28 - 840.68] your moderation day but your stomach is
[838.40 - 843.24] like moderation this isn't the
[840.68 - 844.96] moderation I need right now a lot of
[843.24 - 848.08] people out there will tell you what they
[844.96 - 850.60] need like what their needs are for what
[848.08 - 853.96] they want to eat doesn't mean it's their
[850.60 - 857.08] body's needs are being met doesn't mean
[853.96 - 858.56] their stomach needs are being met it's
[857.08 - 861.36] kind of like whatever their
[858.56 - 863.28] Consciousness is right if we were raised
[861.36 - 865.44] on a different planet and they only gave
[863.28 - 867.48] you so much food like this or this or
[865.44 - 869.56] this that's all you would have but
[867.48 - 870.52] humans tend to
[869.56 - 873.48] make
[870.52 - 875.80] concoctions we like Delights we're
[873.48 - 878.56] raised on chicken fingers we're raised
[875.80 - 881.08] on fish sticks we're raised on Burgers
[878.56 - 884.64] we're raised on fries with oil we're
[881.08 - 887.32] raised on melted cheese that gets all
[884.64 - 890.40] crusty and brown in the oven we're
[887.32 - 892.60] raised on ice cream we're raised on a
[890.40 - 894.56] lot of different foods
[892.60 - 898.40] Abominations you might be somebody
[894.56 - 900.56] saying he's wrong I listen to my body no
[898.40 - 903.76] you listen to your Consciousness and
[900.56 - 906.64] what it was trained to eat our
[903.76 - 909.88] Consciousness the very thing attached to
[906.64 - 913.12] the emotional centers of the brain that
[909.88 - 915.72] means food's emotional we get emotional
[913.12 - 918.00] and then our Consciousness plays tricks
[915.72 - 919.88] it's interesting it's like no I'm
[918.00 - 921.44] intuitively eating well I've seen people
[919.88 - 923.84] say they're intuitively eating and what
[921.44 - 925.48] they're eating I'm like whoa okay if
[923.84 - 928.16] that's intuitively what you're eating I
[925.48 - 930.20] got all the respect for you but man
[928.16 - 932.12] that's SC with what you're eating or if
[930.20 - 935.20] somebody that says well I'm eating in
[932.12 - 936.56] moderation or I heard someone said you
[935.20 - 938.52] could eat in moderation there
[936.56 - 940.16] Consciousness then adopts that and it's
[938.52 - 941.84] like well it fits into what I want to
[940.16 - 944.76] eat I could say I'm eating this in
[941.84 - 949.04] moderation I could get away with it but
[944.76 - 952.88] our Consciousness can learn bad or good
[949.04 - 956.80] it can learn bad and not so bad and
[952.88 - 959.44] halfway bad and pretty bad or really bad
[956.80 - 963.72] or can learn bad
[959.44 - 968.28] pretty good not so bad or it can learn
[963.72 - 971.36] bad all bad or it could be like whoa
[968.28 - 974.84] good good good good good bad good good
[971.36 - 976.80] good good good bad little bad good good
[974.84 - 980.68] good your Consciousness can learn all
[976.80 - 982.56] the good things and then it can connect
[980.68 - 985.20] to that emotional center of the brain
[982.56 - 987.88] and relearning can happen but there's
[985.20 - 989.08] something you need to know your
[987.88 - 993.52] consciousness
[989.08 - 996.52] can be tricked you know think so well
[993.52 - 999.24] Apple C of vinegar any Apple C of
[996.52 - 1003.36] vinegar likers out there that get mad at
[999.24 - 1005.72] me instantly when I even say it yeah if
[1003.36 - 1008.92] you like it yep if you think it's
[1005.72 - 1012.20] healthy for you yep if you use it every
[1008.92 - 1013.60] day yep you've been tricked I know
[1012.20 - 1015.80] there's some of you guys out there that
[1013.60 - 1019.00] don't like vinegar or know apple cider
[1015.80 - 1020.96] vinegar is not the best for you or maybe
[1019.00 - 1022.88] your body reacted when you took it at
[1020.96 - 1025.80] one time so you need something better
[1022.88 - 1028.68] than that right let's do another little
[1025.80 - 1031.68] test hey it's a test this is fun
[1028.68 - 1034.68] chocolate
[1031.68 - 1037.00] chocolate chocolate that's a good one
[1034.68 - 1039.88] right there you like it you've been told
[1037.00 - 1042.08] it's good for you it's yummy you get the
[1039.88 - 1044.08] dark chocolate with no additives and
[1042.08 - 1048.08] junk in it right you get the healthy
[1044.08 - 1050.60] chocolate bar oh you get the cacao nibs
[1048.08 - 1053.00] okay right you've been told it's good
[1050.60 - 1054.80] feels good when you eat it man you're
[1053.00 - 1057.36] flying feels
[1054.80 - 1059.64] wonderful and what about coffee that's
[1057.36 - 1062.28] another one right there people like it
[1059.64 - 1064.44] they enjoy it we get addicted to it we
[1062.28 - 1067.12] have it every single morning some people
[1064.44 - 1070.16] have it three times a day four times a
[1067.12 - 1072.56] day we're told it's good for us we're
[1070.16 - 1075.56] told organic coffee is actually really
[1072.56 - 1078.24] good for us too and our Consciousness is
[1075.56 - 1081.20] tricked once again but that might be
[1078.24 - 1085.32] your your moderation or your intuitive
[1081.20 - 1088.08] nature or your balance or your self-care
[1085.32 - 1089.56] day or your self-care hour every single
[1088.08 - 1092.40] day which is you sit and have your
[1089.56 - 1094.76] coffee you're liking it your
[1092.40 - 1097.08] Consciousness is liking it doesn't mean
[1094.76 - 1100.80] your stomach's liking it doesn't mean
[1097.08 - 1102.76] your stomach likes it at all you see
[1100.80 - 1105.92] those people out there they eat what
[1102.76 - 1107.56] they want you watch them they go to any
[1105.92 - 1109.64] restaurant they could sit down at the
[1107.56 - 1112.48] restaurant they can order like surf and
[1109.64 - 1117.24] turf they can order Lobster they can
[1112.48 - 1119.28] order clams muscles oysters Lobster move
[1117.24 - 1121.52] that over after they finish some of it
[1119.28 - 1124.16] and then big old juicy steak comes with
[1121.52 - 1126.80] butter on top whole bunch of onion rings
[1124.16 - 1128.68] on the side maybe some other appetizers
[1126.80 - 1131.68] crab cakes all of a sudden they're
[1128.68 - 1133.48] eating crab cakes right or maybe they're
[1131.68 - 1137.16] eating something else like some kind of
[1133.48 - 1140.04] just soup that's loaded with oil on top
[1137.16 - 1142.16] has dairy in it cheese parmesan cheesee
[1140.04 - 1143.40] all sprinkled over it maybe it's just a
[1142.16 - 1147.08] big bowl of
[1143.40 - 1149.52] pasta with cheese or just fetuccini
[1147.08 - 1153.76] Alfredo maybe it's just Cookies Cakes
[1149.52 - 1156.00] and donuts ice cream and some pizza and
[1153.76 - 1158.28] then they get sick now it doesn't mean
[1156.00 - 1160.20] the food made them sick really in the
[1158.28 - 1163.64] end it could have been anything
[1160.20 - 1165.92] pathogens viral load Epstein bar
[1163.64 - 1168.68] bacteria like strepto coctus immune
[1165.92 - 1171.32] system problems toxic heavy metal
[1168.68 - 1173.56] chemical exposure it could be anything
[1171.32 - 1176.40] added all up and bundled up and then the
[1173.56 - 1178.12] foods did not help a lot of people head
[1176.40 - 1180.00] to the doctors when they're not feeling
[1178.12 - 1181.88] good and they're getting sick and they
[1180.00 - 1184.64] may go through a lot of doctors before
[1181.88 - 1186.04] they even start changing their diet
[1184.64 - 1188.96] sometimes they'll see two or three
[1186.04 - 1191.36] doctors or more doctors these days will
[1188.96 - 1194.08] tell you to get off the sweets and the
[1191.36 - 1196.52] junk and any of the processed foods and
[1194.08 - 1199.28] that's a good place to start but in the
[1196.52 - 1200.60] end it's not too far far from what they
[1199.28 - 1202.92] were eating
[1200.60 - 1205.28] previously even if they go to the best
[1202.92 - 1207.36] functional medicine doctor these days
[1205.28 - 1210.36] they're still going to be eating pretty
[1207.36 - 1212.72] much close to what they used to eat
[1210.36 - 1216.48] except they'll keep a lot of the
[1212.72 - 1219.04] processed food out the sweets the junk
[1216.48 - 1221.36] but the protein will be there all the
[1219.04 - 1224.56] fat will be there they'll still be
[1221.36 - 1226.08] eating the meals they remember they
[1224.56 - 1227.72] always remembered they'll still have
[1226.08 - 1229.92] their chicken they'll still have their
[1227.72 - 1231.56] meat now if they're a vegan they're
[1229.92 - 1233.24] still going to have their nuts they're
[1231.56 - 1235.20] still going to have their seeds they're
[1233.24 - 1237.08] still going to have their oils they're
[1235.20 - 1239.44] still going to have their beans they're
[1237.08 - 1240.48] still going to have their vinegar and
[1239.44 - 1242.80] they're still going to have their
[1240.48 - 1245.00] chocolate whether vegan or animal
[1242.80 - 1247.24] protein eaters they're still going to
[1245.00 - 1250.72] have all those things but they're going
[1247.24 - 1253.40] to put the brakes on the processed foods
[1250.72 - 1255.64] and many people get improvements cuz
[1253.40 - 1258.32] they clean up so much nasty stuff in
[1255.64 - 1260.72] their diet so they start to improve in
[1258.32 - 1264.40] different ways but then there's a lot of
[1260.72 - 1266.72] people they only improve so much or none
[1264.40 - 1268.56] at all and they're on the search for
[1266.72 - 1272.04] something different because they go to
[1268.56 - 1275.08] another doctor to another specialist and
[1272.04 - 1278.12] another and the diets are all kind of
[1275.08 - 1281.08] relatively the same even if they hit a
[1278.12 - 1284.08] food elimination doctor in the end you
[1281.08 - 1286.36] still got to eat you still got to live
[1284.08 - 1288.48] so it turns out to kind of be the same
[1286.36 - 1291.12] old thing maybe you can put in name on
[1288.48 - 1293.32] it keto is one of the names it could be
[1291.12 - 1294.88] another name a lot of people are naming
[1293.32 - 1299.08] things differently to try to be their
[1294.88 - 1301.84] own way but it all ends up the same kind
[1299.08 - 1304.40] of food but just done a little
[1301.84 - 1306.80] differently and whatever portions you've
[1304.40 - 1309.64] been eating is relatively the same as
[1306.80 - 1311.40] well so it's not just the advice from
[1309.64 - 1313.56] your functional medicine doctor or
[1311.40 - 1315.96] doctors about getting rid of the
[1313.56 - 1318.80] processed foods the fried foods the
[1315.96 - 1321.16] greasy Foods cleaning things up looking
[1318.80 - 1323.12] out for what you're doing it's more than
[1321.16 - 1325.12] that it's kind of the portions are still
[1323.12 - 1327.00] kind of relatively the same you're
[1325.12 - 1329.64] trying to survive you're eating what
[1327.00 - 1331.36] you've known your whole life the amount
[1329.64 - 1333.32] you're eating is kind of what you've
[1331.36 - 1336.04] known your whole life since you were a
[1333.32 - 1338.44] kid and your Consciousness is still
[1336.04 - 1341.00] programmed to what it's always been your
[1338.44 - 1342.96] whole life even though you've cleaned up
[1341.00 - 1345.24] your diet a little bit and maybe it's
[1342.96 - 1347.24] not just your functional medicine doctor
[1345.24 - 1348.52] maybe it's your nutritionist maybe it's
[1347.24 - 1350.52] your health coach
[1348.52 - 1352.60] maybe it's your trainer maybe it's your
[1350.52 - 1355.24] healthc care advisor maybe it's your
[1352.60 - 1357.68] dietitian or it's something you read or
[1355.24 - 1359.84] seen an influencer do and that's what
[1357.68 - 1361.96] you adopted through your Consciousness
[1359.84 - 1364.32] I'm going to try that but in the end
[1361.96 - 1367.00] it's still close to what you've always
[1364.32 - 1369.08] done in the way you've always done it
[1367.00 - 1372.96] and then you're still not better and
[1369.08 - 1375.60] then something inside of you tells you
[1372.96 - 1376.88] you have to go further you're desperate
[1375.60 - 1379.80] you're on your hands and knees you're
[1376.88 - 1381.36] praying to God and at night wondering if
[1379.80 - 1383.56] you're going to live your life the way
[1381.36 - 1385.72] you want to wondering if you're still
[1383.56 - 1387.76] going to live it all because the
[1385.72 - 1390.96] symptoms get to you it's breaking down
[1387.76 - 1393.44] your mind it's breaking down who you are
[1390.96 - 1396.56] people around you aren't happy you're
[1393.44 - 1397.68] being looked at like you're a complainer
[1396.56 - 1400.28] or you're somebody that's just a
[1397.68 - 1402.68] hypercondriac and you're just like I
[1400.28 - 1404.28] can't take this anymore and nothing
[1402.68 - 1406.32] seems right to what you're doing and
[1404.28 - 1409.80] then something happens you break a
[1406.32 - 1413.32] barrier you break down a wall and you're
[1409.80 - 1417.08] like I have to find something something
[1413.32 - 1419.48] doesn't matter what it is maybe fruit is
[1417.08 - 1422.32] okay to do but I've been told it's so
[1419.48 - 1424.88] bad I hear medical medium information
[1422.32 - 1428.36] has healed a lot of people but it's
[1424.88 - 1430.96] fruit involved and I've been told
[1428.36 - 1433.48] fruit's awful by every single functional
[1430.96 - 1435.96] doctor and trainer and dietitian that I
[1433.48 - 1438.00] have to be very careful and just have a
[1435.96 - 1442.36] little fruit once in a while and it's a
[1438.00 - 1445.36] certain kind of fruit and but I need to
[1442.36 - 1447.64] heal and then you look into it maybe you
[1445.36 - 1451.40] grab a book maybe you read cleanse the
[1447.64 - 1454.04] heel and you see smoothies in there but
[1451.40 - 1457.48] specific smoothies and then you see more
[1454.04 - 1462.08] fruit and then you see leafy greens and
[1457.48 - 1465.28] wild foods and herbs and the whole thing
[1462.08 - 1467.68] seems foreign maybe you didn't learn it
[1465.28 - 1469.36] from medical medium maybe you learned it
[1467.68 - 1472.08] from from somebody who learned it from
[1469.36 - 1475.84] medical medium 20 years ago bring in
[1472.08 - 1478.48] more fruits more vegetables more living
[1475.84 - 1480.84] fresh fruits more living fresh
[1478.48 - 1483.04] vegetables or maybe you picked up some
[1480.84 - 1485.48] tips from a vegan more fruits and
[1483.04 - 1489.88] vegetables and then whatever version you
[1485.48 - 1492.08] found out there you tried you did it
[1489.88 - 1495.04] something didn't feel right something
[1492.08 - 1497.48] didn't sit right in your stomach weren't
[1495.04 - 1500.56] feeling that great kind of confused
[1497.48 - 1504.12] about it at all tried it for a while and
[1500.56 - 1507.00] then rode it off it didn't work for you
[1504.12 - 1510.16] and you saw something out there like I'm
[1507.00 - 1514.04] going to eat intuitively or what my body
[1510.16 - 1516.28] needs or moderation or
[1514.04 - 1519.32] orthorexia whatever it was you were
[1516.28 - 1521.40] turned off you didn't understand it what
[1519.32 - 1524.04] you were putting in your body how your
[1521.40 - 1526.88] body works you didn't have all the
[1524.04 - 1530.40] details and you didn't know that what
[1526.88 - 1533.64] your consciousness believes or wants is
[1530.40 - 1536.88] much different than what your body needs
[1533.64 - 1539.72] or wants now all these years your
[1536.88 - 1542.60] Consciousness was trained to eat the way
[1539.72 - 1544.76] you were eating and your body was
[1542.60 - 1547.20] adapting to what your Consciousness was
[1544.76 - 1549.32] training your body to do they were
[1547.20 - 1551.92] working together all those years in the
[1549.32 - 1554.36] past now you're trying something new
[1551.92 - 1556.92] your Consciousness is struggling to what
[1554.36 - 1559.12] you're trying to learn it's used to what
[1556.92 - 1561.96] it used to know in the emotional Center
[1559.12 - 1564.36] of your brain right Comfort Foods eating
[1561.96 - 1567.16] a certain way your whole life it's
[1564.36 - 1569.36] different now and your body was adapted
[1567.16 - 1572.60] to all that for many years so your
[1569.36 - 1574.64] body's like whoa this is different too
[1572.60 - 1577.24] so it can feel uncomfortable both
[1574.64 - 1579.88] mentally and physically but here's the
[1577.24 - 1582.36] key you're sick you haven't been well
[1579.88 - 1584.28] for a while now you got symptoms
[1582.36 - 1587.40] conditions you've been seeing lots of
[1584.28 - 1589.52] doctors you're burnt out you tried so
[1587.40 - 1592.44] many things you've been there you done
[1589.52 - 1594.56] that so you're desperate you know you
[1592.44 - 1597.24] have to push forward you know you have
[1594.56 - 1599.20] to try something new your body doesn't
[1597.24 - 1601.56] feel good because it's used to what you
[1599.20 - 1603.40] used to do your Consciousness doesn't
[1601.56 - 1605.64] feel good because that's used to what
[1603.40 - 1607.92] you used to do and you already don't
[1605.64 - 1609.32] feel good cuz you're sick you got all
[1607.92 - 1611.16] these symptoms you don't know if you're
[1609.32 - 1613.52] coming or going you don't know if it's a
[1611.16 - 1615.60] food that did that one day or you don't
[1613.52 - 1617.16] know if it's actually a new symptom you
[1615.60 - 1619.08] don't know what your doctor said it
[1617.16 - 1620.64] might be these things and your friend
[1619.08 - 1622.60] said it might be this and you're
[1620.64 - 1624.84] thinking like what is wrong with me was
[1622.60 - 1626.88] it something I ate a couple days ago is
[1624.84 - 1628.72] it something I'm doing wrong wait a
[1626.88 - 1630.80] minute that symptom feels the same as it
[1628.72 - 1632.68] always was hey that's a symptom I had
[1630.80 - 1635.88] two years ago I think when I journaled
[1632.68 - 1637.64] it I don't know I'm losing my mind do
[1635.88 - 1640.76] you remember the thing we talked about
[1637.64 - 1641.84] earlier the stomach stretching and the
[1640.76 - 1644.60] stomach
[1641.84 - 1647.68] shrinking well that's a part of all of
[1644.60 - 1651.40] this it's the part when you're gravit
[1647.68 - 1654.24] ating to a new type of eating a way you
[1651.40 - 1657.96] really never ate before in your life
[1654.24 - 1660.28] much different than the small condensed
[1657.96 - 1662.96] high fat high calorie meals you were
[1660.28 - 1665.64] used to all these years or the large
[1662.96 - 1667.48] condensed high fat high calorie meals
[1665.64 - 1669.72] you've been used to all these years some
[1667.48 - 1672.12] people eat a lot more of that some
[1669.72 - 1674.40] people eat a lot less of that the people
[1672.12 - 1676.88] who are eating less of that their
[1674.40 - 1679.36] stomachs shrinking they live their life
[1676.88 - 1681.40] with their stomach really shrunk small
[1679.36 - 1683.48] and then there's people who eat a lot of
[1681.40 - 1686.88] that they're walking around with their
[1683.48 - 1688.44] stomachs expanded stretched every day
[1686.88 - 1691.08] either way they're both eating
[1688.44 - 1693.20] relatively the same kind of food so
[1691.08 - 1695.64] let's start with the person who has a
[1693.20 - 1698.24] stomach that's shrunk all these years
[1695.64 - 1700.72] they walk around with a shrunk stomach
[1698.24 - 1703.68] did you ever run across a person who had
[1700.72 - 1705.48] a banana one big banana they couldn't
[1703.68 - 1707.48] even get the whole thing down they
[1705.48 - 1709.08] peeled it they're eating it they're
[1707.48 - 1710.84] moving through the banana and they all
[1709.08 - 1713.28] of a sudden have a look on them like oh
[1710.84 - 1715.56] my God this is just so much they get
[1713.28 - 1717.40] down to the bottom of the banana and
[1715.56 - 1719.60] they ate it and they're like that was a
[1717.40 - 1721.44] lot do you want me to eat another one
[1719.60 - 1724.04] are you crazy I can't eat two of those
[1721.44 - 1727.08] big bananas now if you chopped up that
[1724.04 - 1729.60] banana or sliced it up or sliced up two
[1727.08 - 1732.16] bananas and put it on a plate lined it
[1729.60 - 1735.04] up all against each other it's going to
[1732.16 - 1738.04] be roughly around the same amount of
[1735.04 - 1739.48] food as a chicken breast it's not going
[1738.04 - 1743.08] to be the same amount for a lot of
[1739.48 - 1746.08] reasons but it can look the same volume
[1743.08 - 1749.00] maybe even more and so what happens is
[1746.08 - 1751.40] someone who has a shrunk stomach is used
[1749.00 - 1753.76] to a small chicken breast and that's
[1751.40 - 1757.48] what they're used to they're not used to
[1753.76 - 1760.80] a watery banana cuz a banana has water
[1757.48 - 1762.44] in it it's got pulp fiber yes it's got
[1760.80 - 1766.28] protein in it yes it's got a little bit
[1762.44 - 1770.52] of fat in there but it's protein fiber
[1766.28 - 1772.28] water SU suar and it's volumous so
[1770.52 - 1774.12] someone with a Shunk stomach be like oh
[1772.28 - 1777.04] my God it was hard to eat two whole
[1774.12 - 1779.28] bananas that was really hard I just want
[1777.04 - 1781.40] my chicken breast with a little cheese
[1779.28 - 1784.52] on top well that chicken breast with a
[1781.40 - 1789.20] little cheese on top or a sauce that's
[1784.52 - 1792.28] fatty and oily is really dense really
[1789.20 - 1794.80] dense in caloric action too now there's
[1792.28 - 1797.32] fat in there there's calories too but
[1794.80 - 1800.16] there's fat you got the protein but it's
[1797.32 - 1803.04] dense in the stomach and it feels like
[1800.16 - 1805.36] it's a weight so when you eat it it's
[1803.04 - 1807.16] all you need to someone who's got a
[1805.36 - 1809.88] shrunk stomach who's been eating like
[1807.16 - 1812.48] that all these years then when they peel
[1809.88 - 1814.60] a big old banana bag and they're eating
[1812.48 - 1817.96] it it's hard for them to get down to the
[1814.60 - 1821.08] end of that banana God forbid they have
[1817.96 - 1824.16] two or three bananas never mind a
[1821.08 - 1827.32] smoothie with three bananas wild
[1824.16 - 1829.48] blueberries oranges maybe some leafy
[1827.32 - 1831.76] Greens in there the person with the
[1829.48 - 1833.40] shrunk stomach the small stomach from
[1831.76 - 1835.68] all these years of eating small
[1833.40 - 1838.84] condensed meals is going to think that's
[1835.68 - 1841.28] a large amount of food so if it was a
[1838.84 - 1843.72] smoothie with all that in there it would
[1841.28 - 1847.28] be too much they would only be able to
[1843.72 - 1849.44] have half a glass of that smoothie or a
[1847.28 - 1852.08] glass of that smoothie at best and they
[1849.44 - 1854.56] would nurse it it's just way too much
[1852.08 - 1856.52] food instead of a hardboiled egg
[1854.56 - 1859.08] something they are used to a lot of
[1856.52 - 1861.80] people that have this the shrunken
[1859.08 - 1863.64] stomach where it's small and shrunk all
[1861.80 - 1866.52] these years they're used to like a
[1863.64 - 1868.60] poached egg a hard boiled egg a fried
[1866.52 - 1870.76] egg with a little piece of toast a
[1868.60 - 1873.00] couple of strips of bacon on the side
[1870.76 - 1875.04] maybe a cup of coffee maybe a little
[1873.00 - 1877.40] chocolate treat later or they'll eat
[1875.04 - 1879.48] small little meals throughout the day of
[1877.40 - 1880.92] treats and things they like until they
[1879.48 - 1884.32] have their dinner which is a small
[1880.92 - 1887.36] chicken breast again or a small 4 o
[1884.32 - 1889.60] piece of meat and here's the problem the
[1887.36 - 1892.48] banana is not going to have enough
[1889.60 - 1894.76] calories to match that slice of toast
[1892.48 - 1896.64] believe it or not the poached egg the
[1894.76 - 1900.40] two strips of bacon they a little
[1896.64 - 1903.64] chocolate treat the banana won't equal
[1900.40 - 1906.28] that two bananas won't equal that the
[1903.64 - 1908.00] calories that they're used to are fat
[1906.28 - 1910.60] they're dense and then they sprinkle
[1908.00 - 1912.80] about little treats with sugar like the
[1910.60 - 1915.00] bad sugar in it throughout the day so
[1912.80 - 1916.40] they're getting their little sugar highs
[1915.00 - 1918.36] they're getting their adrenal and
[1916.40 - 1920.36] caffeine high while they're doing their
[1918.36 - 1922.20] dense little meals and having little
[1920.36 - 1925.00] treats in and around it but they're not
[1922.20 - 1927.28] eating a large amount of food or they're
[1925.00 - 1929.80] not eating larger amounts of food their
[1927.28 - 1932.36] stomach is shrunk their stomach is small
[1929.80 - 1935.40] they eat one banana it's not enough to
[1932.36 - 1938.36] get them by but yet the banana is too
[1935.40 - 1940.80] filling it's taking up too much space
[1938.36 - 1943.56] two bananas Three Bananas taking up too
[1940.80 - 1945.36] much space a whole smoothie is too much
[1943.56 - 1947.28] for them to drink in the morning they're
[1945.36 - 1949.28] used to a hardboiled egg two strips of
[1947.28 - 1951.48] bacon little piece of toast they don't
[1949.28 - 1953.44] even finish it all they have a cup of
[1951.48 - 1955.20] coffee they have a treat somewhere in
[1953.44 - 1956.44] the middle of it all they'll have a
[1955.20 - 1958.28] treat in the middle of the day they'll
[1956.44 - 1961.28] have sugar and another cup of coffee
[1958.28 - 1965.92] later to get some calories but they're
[1961.28 - 1969.56] not having a large amount of food at
[1965.92 - 1972.12] once so you have a smoothie it has less
[1969.56 - 1975.04] calories but it's the foods you need to
[1972.12 - 1978.60] heal here they are they're sick and they
[1975.04 - 1980.12] need to move to these fresh Fresh Living
[1978.60 - 1983.04] juicy
[1980.12 - 1985.92] fruits and they can't get there the
[1983.04 - 1988.36] thing is is that smoothie could be more
[1985.92 - 1990.68] food than they've eaten in a whole day
[1988.36 - 1994.00] not more calories than they've eaten in
[1990.68 - 1996.84] a whole day just the volume a big old
[1994.00 - 1999.36] smoothie of all that liquid in there the
[1996.84 - 2001.20] juice in there the pulp the fiber and
[1999.36 - 2004.04] they're not used to that and that could
[2001.20 - 2005.56] be more food and that smoothie than
[2004.04 - 2007.92] anything else they've done in a whole
[2005.56 - 2011.04] day now we're not even talking about the
[2007.92 - 2012.96] salad now what about a big salad people
[2011.04 - 2015.28] have small salads and they have small
[2012.96 - 2017.88] salads with dense things in there
[2015.28 - 2020.88] they'll have feta cheese they'll have
[2017.88 - 2023.00] tuna in their salad they'll have salmon
[2020.88 - 2025.76] in their salad that's really popular
[2023.00 - 2028.56] hardboiled eggs in their salad ham in
[2025.76 - 2031.24] their salad cheese hard chees is in
[2028.56 - 2033.96] their salad croutons will be throwing in
[2031.24 - 2037.16] there a few of them maybe but the salad
[2033.96 - 2039.72] isn't a lot of greens like lots and lots
[2037.16 - 2042.00] of greens in their salad so what if we
[2039.72 - 2044.72] have to do that now we have to get a
[2042.00 - 2047.32] salad and then we have to have things on
[2044.72 - 2049.84] there that adds into it too it's a lot
[2047.32 - 2051.84] of food what they usually do is they'll
[2049.84 - 2054.04] have this little salad with all these
[2051.84 - 2057.80] dense things on top like the egg and the
[2054.04 - 2060.68] ham and the tuna and the salmon also
[2057.80 - 2064.80] added oil so they'll have oil on top of
[2060.68 - 2067.60] that dense small salad a fatty dressing
[2064.80 - 2070.32] once again really dense
[2067.60 - 2074.36] small portion their stomach is still
[2070.32 - 2076.96] shrunk their stomach's small and the
[2074.36 - 2079.52] Smoothie is already beats out anything
[2076.96 - 2082.72] they've had all day as far as size and
[2079.52 - 2086.20] then the salad properly done where you
[2082.72 - 2089.68] have lots of lettuce a decent Siz bowl
[2086.20 - 2092.56] of spinach three or four
[2089.68 - 2095.92] tomatoes cucumber steamed brussel
[2092.56 - 2099.68] sprouts steamed potatoes steamed red
[2095.92 - 2102.40] potatoes steamed sweet potatoes steamed
[2099.68 - 2105.76] asparagus or raw asparagus chopped up
[2102.40 - 2109.24] and thrown on top raw onion on there
[2105.76 - 2112.52] squeeze of lemon orange juice squeezed
[2109.24 - 2115.16] on top of the salad all of this way too
[2112.52 - 2117.36] much and if they only ate a little bit
[2115.16 - 2119.64] of this meal a little bit of that salad
[2117.36 - 2122.40] with all those fixings on it and just a
[2119.64 - 2125.32] little bit they would be starving it
[2122.40 - 2128.12] wasn't going to meet the caloric nature
[2125.32 - 2131.84] of the dense caloric Foods the small
[2128.12 - 2133.24] caloric dense fatty meals that they eat
[2131.84 - 2135.84] and what they're used to eating their
[2133.24 - 2137.88] whole life so they'll need to eat more
[2135.84 - 2139.72] of the salad they'll have to learn how
[2137.88 - 2142.36] to stretch their stomach even if it's
[2139.72 - 2145.92] just a little bit so they could have
[2142.36 - 2148.72] more of these Healing Foods now even if
[2145.92 - 2151.36] it was just a salad that had tomato and
[2148.72 - 2153.32] cucumber on it it would definitely not
[2151.36 - 2155.28] be enough calories for them they would
[2153.32 - 2157.36] be starving they would be looking for
[2155.28 - 2160.44] sugar somewhere they'd be going to their
[2157.36 - 2162.80] famous treats that they usually do and
[2160.44 - 2165.52] this is why I like the avocado it's a
[2162.80 - 2167.44] transition food it's a great food to
[2165.52 - 2170.20] transition somebody who has a shrunk
[2167.44 - 2173.48] stomach from eating dense small meals
[2170.20 - 2176.76] their whole life but yet needing foods
[2173.48 - 2179.04] that are juicy and vital to heal but
[2176.76 - 2181.24] can't quite make that transition the
[2179.04 - 2183.56] avocado is a great way to do that so
[2181.24 - 2186.36] they have their small salad and then we
[2183.56 - 2189.20] put an avocado on that salad avocado has
[2186.36 - 2191.48] that dense nature and if you do have a
[2189.20 - 2194.76] little bit of steamed vegetable or
[2191.48 - 2196.64] steamed potato or steamed sweet potato
[2194.76 - 2200.12] the combination of a little bit of that
[2196.64 - 2201.76] steamed potato and the avocado and
[2200.12 - 2204.28] anything else that's in there with the
[2201.76 - 2207.76] lettuce becomes much more denser because
[2204.28 - 2210.44] you have that fat slick on that salad
[2207.76 - 2212.48] something there so ingrained that
[2210.44 - 2215.92] they've known about in their diet system
[2212.48 - 2219.40] their whole life having that dense fat
[2215.92 - 2222.28] or that oily dressing or that cheesy
[2219.40 - 2225.40] topping you treat the avocado as if it
[2222.28 - 2227.36] was an egg that's how you get by that's
[2225.40 - 2230.16] how you use it as that transition for
[2227.36 - 2232.24] them it feels like it was almost like an
[2230.16 - 2234.88] egg or something it was almost like
[2232.24 - 2237.32] something dense and fatty as you're
[2234.88 - 2240.28] working on making your salads bigger
[2237.32 - 2242.96] more leafy greens more Tomatoes more
[2240.28 - 2246.20] cucumbers or a bigger smoothie in the
[2242.96 - 2249.08] morning or more fruits or just a half a
[2246.20 - 2252.76] papaya and eating the whole thing or one
[2249.08 - 2255.00] or two big mangoes you work on getting
[2252.76 - 2257.60] that volume in you that's filling up
[2255.00 - 2259.96] your stomach stretching the stomach a
[2257.60 - 2262.84] little bit and gently it may not feel
[2259.96 - 2265.60] comfortable you may be confused at first
[2262.84 - 2268.52] but it's allowing more calories of the
[2265.60 - 2271.04] healing foods so they don't run scared
[2268.52 - 2273.20] run hungry think they intuitive Natures
[2271.04 - 2275.24] off thinking they're not doing balance
[2273.20 - 2278.56] or moderation right and then running
[2275.24 - 2280.80] into a snag finding some Trend out there
[2278.56 - 2283.52] going in opposite direction never
[2280.80 - 2285.88] healing and getting stuck this is where
[2283.52 - 2289.04] the details matter because I've seen
[2285.88 - 2291.44] people out there they were sick and they
[2289.04 - 2294.12] had to find a way to heal and then when
[2291.44 - 2296.36] you taught them about hey here's the
[2294.12 - 2298.84] smoothies here's the bananas here's the
[2296.36 - 2300.72] steamed potatoes here's the leafy greens
[2298.84 - 2302.96] here's the wild Foods here's the Frozen
[2300.72 - 2304.92] wild blueberries next thing you know it
[2302.96 - 2307.76] you get a call from them and they'll be
[2304.92 - 2310.68] like I can't do this I'm starving to
[2307.76 - 2313.76] death I need protein fast I'm going to
[2310.68 - 2315.28] my keto doctor immediately I I just
[2313.76 - 2316.96] can't do this anymore and you're like
[2315.28 - 2320.00] wait a minute wait a minute wait wait
[2316.96 - 2323.84] what did you eat yesterday I had a half
[2320.00 - 2327.96] a mango in the morning um in the middle
[2323.84 - 2330.64] of the day I had a salad and I can't do
[2327.96 - 2333.52] this it's just too much like wait how
[2330.64 - 2336.20] many bananas did you have none yesterday
[2333.52 - 2338.64] I had a banana 3 days ago though it's
[2336.20 - 2341.00] like that's not enough not enough
[2338.64 - 2344.12] calories it's like well it's seemed like
[2341.00 - 2346.56] enough when I ate it and I just can't do
[2344.12 - 2349.08] this I have to have my chicken and I
[2346.56 - 2351.52] have to have my other stuff and my eggs
[2349.08 - 2353.24] and I have to have my cheese I can't do
[2351.52 - 2355.80] this anymore and I'm like wait a minute
[2353.24 - 2358.12] we have to have more calories you got to
[2355.80 - 2360.76] put more banana in you in the morning
[2358.12 - 2363.24] more papaya in you get the smoothie and
[2360.76 - 2365.68] you maybe your salad can have some
[2363.24 - 2367.00] avocado on it let's do a whole avocado
[2365.68 - 2369.88] and even that
[2367.00 - 2373.32] they'll be like a whole avocado a whole
[2369.88 - 2375.36] one okay that's kind of a lot and what
[2373.32 - 2377.80] they don't realize is that even if they
[2375.36 - 2380.12] went back to their small dense meals
[2377.80 - 2382.16] with their stomach being shrunk and
[2380.12 - 2384.60] their small intense high fat high
[2382.16 - 2386.96] calorie little meals they'd still be
[2384.60 - 2389.76] looking for all their sugary treats all
[2386.96 - 2392.88] day long in between their pieces of
[2389.76 - 2396.08] chocolate and their sugar and their tea
[2392.88 - 2398.48] and any kind of other treats and snacks
[2396.08 - 2400.56] maybe small amounts of it but they would
[2398.48 - 2404.88] still be looking for those little bits
[2400.56 - 2407.96] of sugar high in and out of it so either
[2404.88 - 2409.68] way they need their calories somewhere
[2407.96 - 2412.68] and so we have to find them in good
[2409.68 - 2415.60] places like the steamed potato and the
[2412.68 - 2418.08] fruit and the winter squash but we have
[2415.60 - 2420.44] to stretch the stomach a little bit more
[2418.08 - 2422.24] than what they're used to now don't get
[2420.44 - 2424.12] confused when I say stretch the stomach
[2422.24 - 2425.88] you might think why do I want to look
[2424.12 - 2428.56] bloated why is this guy trying to
[2425.88 - 2430.88] stretch my stomach I I don't want to
[2428.56 - 2433.00] like have a stomach sticking out it
[2430.88 - 2434.36] doesn't work like that doesn't mean just
[2433.00 - 2436.36] because you're stretching your stomach a
[2434.36 - 2438.68] little bit internally it doesn't mean
[2436.36 - 2441.80] your abdomen is going to be sticking out
[2438.68 - 2443.80] and reaching out not at all it'll just
[2441.80 - 2447.96] look the same it'll be the same flat
[2443.80 - 2449.44] stomach if you have a flat stomach now
[2447.96 - 2450.92] if you don't have a flat stomach you
[2449.44 - 2453.04] already got bloating that's a different
[2450.92 - 2455.52] story you're already bloating stretching
[2453.04 - 2458.52] your stomach has nothing to do with you
[2455.52 - 2461.16] bloating more or bloating less if you're
[2458.52 - 2463.24] bloating that's another problem that's
[2461.16 - 2465.28] other issues that's already happening
[2463.24 - 2467.28] and that's going to be there and if
[2465.28 - 2470.04] you're already bloating you already have
[2467.28 - 2473.52] all kinds of other things like low HCL
[2470.04 - 2475.64] low hydrochloric acid which is why what
[2473.52 - 2477.52] you're doing with your diet is so
[2475.64 - 2479.88] helpful because this takes you to a
[2477.52 - 2482.44] place to eventually fix and correct that
[2479.88 - 2484.00] problem but a lot of people are bloating
[2482.44 - 2487.04] because they have strepto coctus
[2484.00 - 2489.52] bacteria inside their gut they got
[2487.04 - 2491.12] ammonia they got putrifying proteins
[2489.52 - 2493.60] from years and years of food they've
[2491.12 - 2497.44] eaten that didn't digest well they got
[2493.60 - 2500.04] liver problems stagnant sluggish fatty
[2497.44 - 2502.56] livers they're bloating for a whole
[2500.04 - 2504.68] bunch of other reasons and stretching
[2502.56 - 2507.56] your stomach a little bit to get some
[2504.68 - 2510.04] Healing Foods in to fix everything isn't
[2507.56 - 2512.00] what's creating that bloating now let's
[2510.04 - 2515.84] talk about the opposite side of the
[2512.00 - 2517.48] spectrum an expanded stretched stomach
[2515.84 - 2519.88] now we're we're not talking anymore
[2517.48 - 2522.12] about a shrunken stomach from small
[2519.88 - 2524.52] condensed meals and the stomach shrinks
[2522.12 - 2528.04] and gets small we're talking about a
[2524.52 - 2530.80] stomach that gets big talking about an
[2528.04 - 2534.28] expanded and stretched stomach this is
[2530.80 - 2536.24] from somebody eating larger portions and
[2534.28 - 2538.60] it doesn't have to even be that much
[2536.24 - 2541.84] larger but larger portions of the same
[2538.60 - 2543.80] condensed meals instead of one drumstick
[2541.84 - 2546.20] they want two drumsticks every night
[2543.80 - 2549.32] they want four drumsticks they want four
[2546.20 - 2552.40] four drumsticks and two chicken wings or
[2549.32 - 2555.32] instead of two slices of pizza they want
[2552.40 - 2558.08] half of a large pizza instead of two
[2555.32 - 2560.40] slices of a medium pizza or say it's
[2558.08 - 2563.20] somebody that wants a macaroni and
[2560.40 - 2565.32] cheese but not just a bowl of macaroni
[2563.20 - 2567.40] and cheese they go in for their second
[2565.32 - 2569.60] bowl and their third bowl and their
[2567.40 - 2572.28] fourth Bowl because they want a big bowl
[2569.60 - 2575.48] of macaroni and cheese and so that's how
[2572.28 - 2578.80] they do it or maybe a big bowl of pasta
[2575.48 - 2581.12] instead of a small bowl of pasta or when
[2578.80 - 2584.24] they make scrambled eggs they don't do
[2581.12 - 2587.36] two scrambled eggs or one scrambled egg
[2584.24 - 2591.64] they do six scrambled eggs you know and
[2587.36 - 2594.76] so what they're used to are large dense
[2591.64 - 2597.68] portions of the same foods and then they
[2594.76 - 2600.76] still need their treats and their sugary
[2597.68 - 2602.88] treats and their chocolate and maybe
[2600.76 - 2606.72] they need a lot of food because they've
[2602.88 - 2609.24] had a hard time feeling satiated
[2606.72 - 2610.96] something in their mind meaning wasn't
[2609.24 - 2613.28] connecting to something physically in
[2610.96 - 2615.68] their brain they needed more calories
[2613.28 - 2618.64] they needed more glucose they needed
[2615.68 - 2620.64] more calories because they're going
[2618.64 - 2622.68] through some hard times they're
[2620.64 - 2625.20] struggling they're under stress their
[2622.68 - 2627.32] adrenals are running they had a hardship
[2625.20 - 2630.00] they had a loss maybe they're being
[2627.32 - 2632.72] abused maybe they were betrayed and the
[2630.00 - 2635.32] need for more fuel came in or they're
[2632.72 - 2637.72] working so hard or they have a little
[2635.32 - 2640.48] bit of insulin resistance they're not
[2637.72 - 2642.52] getting enough glucose to the brain so
[2640.48 - 2645.16] they're just requiring more but either
[2642.52 - 2648.56] way their stomach is stretched they're
[2645.16 - 2651.08] used to eating larger condensed meals
[2648.56 - 2653.60] condensed fats but larger
[2651.08 - 2655.08] portions and they're even gaining weight
[2653.60 - 2656.56] and they don't even have to gain weight
[2655.08 - 2658.36] maybe it's somebody that didn't gain
[2656.56 - 2659.76] weight but they're still eating this way
[2658.36 - 2661.00] and then there's somebody who gained a
[2659.76 - 2663.48] lot of weight and they're eating this
[2661.00 - 2665.64] way I know people that eat larger
[2663.48 - 2667.44] portions of condensed Foods they've been
[2665.64 - 2669.68] raised is to eat and eatting their whole
[2667.44 - 2670.80] life but they eat larger portions
[2669.68 - 2674.36] because they're up against so much
[2670.80 - 2675.92] stress hardship or losses or they've had
[2674.36 - 2677.36] a hard time in their life they're under
[2675.92 - 2678.96] stress and they're taking care of a
[2677.36 - 2681.44] bunch of people they're working really
[2678.96 - 2683.56] hard maybe they have two or three jobs
[2681.44 - 2686.36] they're not sleeping much at night
[2683.56 - 2689.00] they're working a lot of hours a day
[2686.36 - 2690.84] sometimes seven days a week so they
[2689.00 - 2693.56] require more and there's people that
[2690.84 - 2695.44] aren't working that hard don't have a
[2693.56 - 2699.20] really hard time but they're requiring
[2695.44 - 2701.40] more too because they need it for fuel
[2699.20 - 2704.52] for their brain because they have other
[2701.40 - 2706.60] issues their brain has other problems so
[2704.52 - 2708.72] it's not like someone wants to eat large
[2706.60 - 2711.64] portions they may be eating larger
[2708.72 - 2714.48] portions because of other issues and
[2711.64 - 2717.12] it's what they've adapted to in order to
[2714.48 - 2719.56] survive and let's just say this person
[2717.12 - 2721.12] gets sick the person who's eaten larger
[2719.56 - 2723.04] portions their whole life and they have
[2721.12 - 2725.16] a stretched stomach or even just a
[2723.04 - 2728.24] little bit more stretched stomach than
[2725.16 - 2731.40] someone with a shrunken stomach and they
[2728.24 - 2734.40] get sick and they need to find healing
[2731.40 - 2737.68] and you give them a salad with a
[2734.40 - 2740.20] cucumber and a tomato on it and a slice
[2737.68 - 2743.20] of potato or something or you give them
[2740.20 - 2745.56] a smoothie and it's just two bananas and
[2743.20 - 2747.04] some wild blueberries they're going to
[2745.56 - 2748.92] look at it and be like well I might need
[2747.04 - 2750.60] more than this they're not going to do
[2748.92 - 2752.68] the opposite of the other person who
[2750.60 - 2755.52] said oh this is way too much I can't eat
[2752.68 - 2758.08] a whole banana a lot of people who have
[2755.52 - 2760.28] stress stretched stomachs get derailed
[2758.08 - 2762.36] when they're eating Healing Foods when
[2760.28 - 2765.36] they're trying to bring in these healing
[2762.36 - 2768.60] techniques and healing Tools in food and
[2765.36 - 2770.56] they derail because it's not enough for
[2768.60 - 2773.16] them so you have to be like look you
[2770.56 - 2775.60] need to eat more calories you need to
[2773.16 - 2778.72] eat more because you used to eat these
[2775.60 - 2781.40] dense meals but these larger dense meals
[2778.72 - 2784.08] and your stomach stretched so you have
[2781.40 - 2785.96] to make sure we do more we do a few
[2784.08 - 2788.68] bananas in your smoothie with your water
[2785.96 - 2790.72] blueberries have some apples later on in
[2788.68 - 2793.40] the morning or you might have to bring
[2790.72 - 2795.36] in more steamed potatoes not just one
[2793.40 - 2798.40] little steamed potato and that happens
[2795.36 - 2799.88] to a lot of people where they just start
[2798.40 - 2802.04] with this little steamed potato they're
[2799.88 - 2805.32] used to eating more larger portions of
[2802.04 - 2808.20] dense cooked meals with lots of fat in
[2805.32 - 2810.80] them but when you say hey look have
[2808.20 - 2812.56] steamed potato you take a look and they
[2810.80 - 2813.68] just put a little tiny steamed potato
[2812.56 - 2816.00] they chopped it up they threw it in
[2813.68 - 2817.76] their salad and they're like oh my God I
[2816.00 - 2820.60] was okay for a little while and then I
[2817.76 - 2824.48] got really hungry because they needed
[2820.60 - 2826.96] two or three potatoes or four steamed
[2824.48 - 2829.36] potatoes is what they needed now steamed
[2826.96 - 2831.92] potato if anybody needs to know right
[2829.36 - 2835.20] now it's a healing tool it's a healing
[2831.92 - 2837.04] food I talk about it all the time so
[2835.20 - 2838.64] it's not that we're against animal
[2837.04 - 2841.28] protein in the moment it's not one of
[2838.64 - 2843.56] those shows where no animal protein or
[2841.28 - 2846.64] know this and know that we're talking
[2843.56 - 2849.52] about healing cleansing healing Foods a
[2846.64 - 2852.08] steamed potato is a very healing food
[2849.52 - 2853.48] there's no fat there's no overt fat
[2852.08 - 2856.04] right there so you don't have to worry
[2853.48 - 2858.56] about all this fat inside of it so in
[2856.04 - 2862.28] order to heal a lot of people need to
[2858.56 - 2865.80] lower their animal fat consumption just
[2862.28 - 2868.68] like vegans need to lower their nut fat
[2865.80 - 2870.96] consumptions and oil fat consumptions in
[2868.68 - 2874.00] order to heal as well so it's all in
[2870.96 - 2876.04] that field what's hard with somebody
[2874.00 - 2878.88] with a stretched stomach is that they're
[2876.04 - 2882.00] used to those larger amounts of calories
[2878.88 - 2884.56] the chloric action the dense fats so
[2882.00 - 2887.56] when you dial it back you have this
[2884.56 - 2891.12] other food now it's not as high in
[2887.56 - 2893.24] calories it's not as dense in fat so
[2891.12 - 2895.12] then we have to eat a little bit more of
[2893.24 - 2898.80] these foods which could leave them
[2895.12 - 2900.76] feeling unsatiated like hungry so they
[2898.80 - 2902.96] go to bed a little bit more hungry than
[2900.76 - 2905.28] usual and they're not used to that it's
[2902.96 - 2908.44] foreign to them they were on 10,000
[2905.28 - 2911.20] calories a day now they're on 3,000
[2908.44 - 2914.28] calories a day and they're confused or
[2911.20 - 2917.20] they were on 5,000 calories a day and
[2914.28 - 2919.72] now they're on 3,000 calories a day or
[2917.20 - 2921.92] 2,000 calories a day depending on how
[2919.72 - 2924.20] sick they are what's really wrong with
[2921.92 - 2926.32] them too so that's another thing to
[2924.20 - 2928.72] equate into this but usually there's
[2926.32 - 2932.60] people they don't know it but even
[2928.72 - 2934.76] though packages and calorie counts are
[2932.60 - 2937.60] certain ways if you look online or
[2934.76 - 2939.32] anything they're not not accurate so
[2937.60 - 2941.40] none of those calorie counts are
[2939.32 - 2944.48] accurate when it comes down to dense
[2941.40 - 2947.28] caloric or dense fat foods people don't
[2944.48 - 2949.44] realize nuts are more calories and more
[2947.28 - 2951.92] dense in fat than people really know so
[2949.44 - 2953.72] how many grams of fat or how many grams
[2951.92 - 2955.76] of whatever people don't realize that
[2953.72 - 2957.16] there's more to it than that and it's
[2955.76 - 2959.84] not quite correct some people walk
[2957.16 - 2962.16] around eating 10,000 calories a day
[2959.84 - 2965.68] 8,000 calories a day but don't know they
[2962.16 - 2967.36] met that level in the health World alter
[2965.68 - 2969.56] native Health world it's one siiz
[2967.36 - 2972.16] fits-all if you haven't noticed out
[2969.56 - 2974.52] there here's a prime example of how it's
[2972.16 - 2977.20] one siiz fits-all when you look at
[2974.52 - 2980.08] chicken and you say well how many
[2977.20 - 2982.36] calories are in 2 ounces of chicken how
[2980.08 - 2985.24] much fats in 2 ounces of chicken and you
[2982.36 - 2988.28] look it up they're just looking at 2
[2985.24 - 2993.00] ounces of chicken but they're not
[2988.28 - 2995.72] looking at 2 oz of whose chicken what
[2993.00 - 2998.12] chicken right the conventional world an
[2995.72 - 2999.68] alternative World they work together I
[2998.12 - 3002.08] don't know if you noticed it either
[2999.68 - 3004.72] they're both embed together it's all one
[3002.08 - 3007.08] size fits all here's the example a
[3004.72 - 3009.44] chicken in one Farm could be raised
[3007.08 - 3012.52] entirely different and have a much
[3009.44 - 3015.24] higher fat content much higher calorie
[3012.52 - 3018.08] content a chicken in another Farm could
[3015.24 - 3022.12] be really lean could even be lean and
[3018.08 - 3024.36] mean lower fat lower calorie but no
[3022.12 - 3027.96] one's ever looking at this they just
[3024.36 - 3030.08] look at the rec book how it's
[3027.96 - 3031.76] institutionalized for alternative
[3030.08 - 3035.32] medicine believe it or not where you go
[3031.76 - 3037.52] and you look fact check oh 2 ounces of
[3035.32 - 3040.04] chicken equals this and this and this
[3037.52 - 3042.72] but that's not reality people walk
[3040.04 - 3044.32] around eating a lot of calories and a
[3042.72 - 3046.80] lot of fat they don't even realize
[3044.32 - 3051.04] they're eating that's why you can be
[3046.80 - 3054.40] tanking down 6 7,000 calories a day
[3051.04 - 3056.08] 8,000 calories a day and not even know
[3054.40 - 3057.72] because theck chicken you could be
[3056.08 - 3060.64] eating from the Farms you're going to
[3057.72 - 3064.84] eat them at could be really really high
[3060.64 - 3069.04] in fat same goes for any food that's how
[3064.84 - 3072.92] strange it is fish same thing eggs same
[3069.04 - 3076.24] thing cheese same thing no one has the
[3072.92 - 3079.92] right number so if we're all about like
[3076.24 - 3082.88] it's got to be science it's got to be
[3079.92 - 3085.72] scientific even a study so that means if
[3082.88 - 3086.60] a study itself is doing something where
[3085.72 - 3090.80] they're
[3086.60 - 3093.92] studying like the amount of fuel a mouse
[3090.80 - 3096.08] needs they're not even equating to what
[3093.92 - 3098.24] the mouse is even eating like the
[3096.08 - 3102.36] science is never straightforward it's
[3098.24 - 3105.24] never really factually right it's not
[3102.36 - 3108.16] it's because we go by the one size fits
[3105.24 - 3111.64] all world it's never exact so when a
[3108.16 - 3114.76] bodybuilder or exercise buff or trainer
[3111.64 - 3115.80] is counting calories counting macros and
[3114.76 - 3118.08] they're really trying trying to keep
[3115.80 - 3120.32] track and they're portion controlling
[3118.08 - 3123.76] and they're counting everything they're
[3120.32 - 3126.08] not even counting anything right because
[3123.76 - 3128.92] they're using the one siiz fits all
[3126.08 - 3130.80] ruler the one that says here's exactly
[3128.92 - 3132.32] how many calories are in a banana but
[3130.80 - 3134.64] there's different bananas from different
[3132.32 - 3136.64] Farms from different regions that have
[3134.64 - 3138.36] entirely different things in them and
[3136.64 - 3140.08] then there's different chickens from
[3138.36 - 3143.08] different places around the country and
[3140.08 - 3144.80] around the world there's different pork
[3143.08 - 3146.48] there's different lamb there's different
[3144.80 - 3148.92] beef there's different eggs there's
[3146.48 - 3152.00] different cheese there's cheese that's
[3148.92 - 3154.48] very thin it's got less fat in it more
[3152.00 - 3157.24] sugar in it and there's cheese that's
[3154.48 - 3160.00] all fat but they're not counting any of
[3157.24 - 3162.84] that and all those things matter greatly
[3160.00 - 3165.72] how was the cow fed there's grass
[3162.84 - 3168.12] growing in regions that have less
[3165.72 - 3171.36] protein in it there's grass that grows
[3168.12 - 3173.60] in regions of the world that have less
[3171.36 - 3176.60] fat in it traces of fat yes that are in
[3173.60 - 3179.56] grass and so cow are eating differently
[3176.60 - 3181.92] their meats designed differently so when
[3179.56 - 3184.24] we do the one size fits all thing it's
[3181.92 - 3185.96] completely distorted in all wrong so
[3184.24 - 3188.20] nobody knows really how many calories
[3185.96 - 3190.44] they're even eating which leads to a
[3188.20 - 3194.08] problem because they could be eating
[3190.44 - 3196.76] more calories more fats than they ever
[3194.08 - 3199.40] even knew they think they're counting
[3196.76 - 3201.16] their proteins fats and carbs they think
[3199.40 - 3203.08] they're doing their macros right they're
[3201.16 - 3205.32] counting their macros right but they're
[3203.08 - 3208.60] not they're totally Off the Mark you're
[3205.32 - 3211.52] Flying Blind this is one of thousands of
[3208.60 - 3214.28] mistakes made in the health world if
[3211.52 - 3215.96] you're starting anything healing doing
[3214.28 - 3217.68] healing tools healing foods you don't
[3215.96 - 3219.40] have to do it all at once you don't have
[3217.68 - 3221.64] to do the whole thing throw the kitchen
[3219.40 - 3224.80] sink in there all together get do baby
[3221.64 - 3227.44] steps incorporate one thing at a time
[3224.80 - 3229.64] little bit at a time take one day at a
[3227.44 - 3231.48] time be easy on yourself you don't have
[3229.64 - 3233.44] to think oh my God I got to stretch my
[3231.48 - 3236.44] stomach no don't have to even think
[3233.44 - 3238.48] about it but you got to think about this
[3236.44 - 3241.00] though what you're feeling as you're
[3238.48 - 3243.36] doing it got to be easy on yourself
[3241.00 - 3246.12] there because a lot of people they're so
[3243.36 - 3249.20] inflamed in their intestinal tract their
[3246.12 - 3251.20] Vegas nerves are hypers sensitive not
[3249.20 - 3252.96] just their Vegas nerves but little tiny
[3251.20 - 3254.84] nerve endings come off their Vegas
[3252.96 - 3257.28] nerves going to the intestinal tract
[3254.84 - 3259.00] lining so that when food's moving
[3257.28 - 3261.72] through your intestinal tract through
[3259.00 - 3264.28] your gut you're feeling it you're
[3261.72 - 3266.28] feeling it massage the walls of your
[3264.28 - 3267.80] intestinal tract which could kind of
[3266.28 - 3270.00] feel uncomfortable if you're somebody
[3267.80 - 3273.40] that's highly inflamed so then you're
[3270.00 - 3275.64] like oh wait my food's not digesting
[3273.40 - 3279.68] that banana I ate isn't
[3275.64 - 3282.36] digesting um that salad I ate isn't
[3279.68 - 3284.84] digesting and so you kind of get nervous
[3282.36 - 3287.04] you don't know if it's working because
[3284.84 - 3290.36] you might be somebody that's used to
[3287.04 - 3293.44] bread and butter bread and butter just
[3290.36 - 3296.40] kind of moves through you like a sticky
[3293.44 - 3298.20] gummy glue doesn't massage anything you
[3296.40 - 3302.44] might be somebody that's used to eggs
[3298.20 - 3304.68] eggs kind of liquidy into a weird liquid
[3302.44 - 3306.88] paste that sits in the middle in the
[3304.68 - 3309.92] intestinal tract and doesn't touch the
[3306.88 - 3313.12] walls of the intestinal tract it doesn't
[3309.92 - 3316.00] massage if you have a banana banana
[3313.12 - 3319.04] moves through and gently
[3316.00 - 3321.84] massages because it's working on healing
[3319.04 - 3324.04] the gut so you might feel a banana move
[3321.84 - 3327.20] through you a lot of people they'll eat
[3324.04 - 3329.60] some papaya and then be like huh you
[3327.20 - 3331.60] know I can kind of feel something
[3329.60 - 3334.36] different I have a different feeling
[3331.60 - 3335.80] inside of me and they're confused at
[3334.36 - 3337.44] that different feeling and it might not
[3335.80 - 3340.60] even be uncomfortable at all it just
[3337.44 - 3343.64] might kind of make you aware and when it
[3340.60 - 3345.76] makes you aware you might get scared
[3343.64 - 3348.60] because you're changing your diet you're
[3345.76 - 3351.12] eating different foods the foods are
[3348.60 - 3355.72] actually touching things inside of you
[3351.12 - 3359.48] massaging things they fiber everything
[3355.72 - 3362.40] the pulp all of it and healing foods do
[3359.48 - 3365.56] things inside of us that help us and we
[3362.40 - 3368.52] end up feeling that they're cleaning the
[3365.56 - 3370.80] mess up so these foods are cleaning
[3368.52 - 3373.84] things up they're cleaning all the junk
[3370.80 - 3376.88] in us too they're loosening up pockets
[3373.84 - 3379.52] of bacteria they're moving around
[3376.88 - 3381.32] deposits that were stuck on the walls of
[3379.52 - 3384.36] the intestinal tract and colon that are
[3381.32 - 3386.76] putrified and rancid and hardened and
[3384.36 - 3389.48] clung to the walls of the intestinal
[3386.76 - 3392.92] tract these healing foods are waking
[3389.48 - 3395.60] things up moving and shifting things
[3392.92 - 3398.12] feeding the nerves that attach to the
[3395.60 - 3400.56] intestinal tract Linings while all this
[3398.12 - 3402.64] is happening healing is happening inside
[3400.56 - 3404.76] the body and it might be scary it might
[3402.64 - 3406.56] be like what's going on I'm kind of
[3404.76 - 3409.92] getting aware of this this is a
[3406.56 - 3412.00] different feeling I feel what is this
[3409.92 - 3415.76] then you might get scared you might be
[3412.00 - 3419.60] like huh I can't tell meanwhile to
[3415.76 - 3423.04] toxification cleansing healing purging
[3419.60 - 3426.04] of the liver is happening see all these
[3423.04 - 3427.96] things are going on and we can sense
[3426.04 - 3430.52] them we could feel them and it can make
[3427.96 - 3433.16] people go the opposite direction
[3430.52 - 3436.40] sometimes because they're used to being
[3433.16 - 3438.60] inflamed and sick but not feeling the
[3436.40 - 3441.48] food move through them instead they're
[3438.60 - 3444.08] used to just being bloated sick maybe
[3441.48 - 3445.92] crampy and constipation maybe IBS and
[3444.08 - 3448.80] other problems but they're not used to
[3445.92 - 3451.00] feeling their food so much this is New
[3448.80 - 3454.72] Sensations that happen when you do it
[3451.00 - 3457.12] right when you do it right when you know
[3454.72 - 3460.32] how to use these foods to cleanse when
[3457.12 - 3462.84] you know how to use these foods to heal
[3460.32 - 3465.16] and you understand your stomach how to
[3462.84 - 3469.12] protect your stomach and then when you
[3465.16 - 3471.44] bring in celery juice and you can baby
[3469.12 - 3473.36] step that you can start small and not
[3471.44 - 3475.56] have to go to 16 ounces on an empty
[3473.36 - 3477.96] stomach or 32 ounces on an empty stomach
[3475.56 - 3481.36] yet but when you bring in the tools like
[3477.96 - 3483.56] the lemon water and the celery juice and
[3481.36 - 3485.60] the smoothies and the heavy metal detox
[3483.56 - 3487.72] smoothie and you bring in your leafy
[3485.60 - 3489.68] greens and you bring in your steamed
[3487.72 - 3492.96] asparagus and steamed brussel sprouts
[3489.68 - 3496.16] and steamed potatoes and your wild foods
[3492.96 - 3499.28] and your herbs and you bring it in baby
[3496.16 - 3501.08] stepping in something changes you end up
[3499.28 - 3503.20] moving forward and you discover and
[3501.08 - 3505.92] unlock the healing process in you and
[3503.20 - 3508.16] your consciousness the
[3505.92 - 3511.36] Consciousness that adapted all these
[3508.16 - 3514.72] years to what you used to eat all those
[3511.36 - 3517.92] years ago starts to change and the
[3514.72 - 3519.24] emotional centers of your brain connect
[3517.92 - 3521.52] to the new
[3519.24 - 3524.56] consciousness of your body
[3521.52 - 3526.56] healing and it's the most powerful thing
[3524.56 - 3528.64] you could ever
[3526.56 - 3531.84] do our
[3528.64 - 3534.80] Consciousness is not who we
[3531.84 - 3537.92] are because our Consciousness can be
[3534.80 - 3542.36] become something else something we don't
[3537.92 - 3544.80] want to be our Consciousness is
[3542.36 - 3548.32] powerful but it's not something that
[3544.80 - 3550.88] defines us to exactly who we're ever
[3548.32 - 3553.80] going to be because we can use our
[3550.88 - 3557.76] Consciousness to change and
[3553.80 - 3560.40] grow if someone is living their life and
[3557.76 - 3563.64] they make mistakes along the way through
[3560.40 - 3567.32] hardships and hard times and they make
[3563.64 - 3570.32] decisions that they believe was not a
[3567.32 - 3572.76] good thing they have to be easy on
[3570.32 - 3576.52] themselves because our Consciousness in
[3572.76 - 3579.36] that moment was only doing the best it
[3576.52 - 3582.40] could with the capacity of what it's
[3579.36 - 3585.48] learned throughout the years but we can
[3582.40 - 3588.36] turn to another Direction and our
[3585.48 - 3591.36] Consciousness can grow it can become
[3588.36 - 3594.36] something different it can help us make
[3591.36 - 3597.68] decisions that's right for our body
[3594.36 - 3601.60] right for our needs and then it becomes
[3597.68 - 3605.20] our best friend our best ally not our
[3601.60 - 3607.52] enemy seeds become planted within our
[3605.20 - 3610.88] Consciousness seeds of things that
[3607.52 - 3614.32] aren't good for us seeds of things that
[3610.88 - 3618.12] don't make us better they take us down
[3614.32 - 3621.52] along the way we get told all the time
[3618.12 - 3625.28] what's good for us what we should do
[3621.52 - 3628.12] what feels good listen to your body
[3625.28 - 3631.60] and do the things that are trendy out
[3628.12 - 3634.40] there the trend train doesn't care about
[3631.60 - 3636.80] really what's going on inside someone
[3634.40 - 3639.40] it's all about making somebody else's
[3636.80 - 3642.08] Consciousness happy in a different way
[3639.40 - 3644.88] but we can take control of our own
[3642.08 - 3648.28] Consciousness and we can lead it into a
[3644.88 - 3651.56] direction of safety and well-being for
[3648.28 - 3654.24] what we truly need instead of our
[3651.56 - 3658.00] Consciousness filled with noise and busy
[3654.24 - 3661.56] work words controlling us we can retach
[3658.00 - 3664.04] and Infuse knowledge and wisdom into our
[3661.56 - 3667.36] Consciousness and support the
[3664.04 - 3671.08] supernatural resource so it becomes a
[3667.36 - 3671.08] star that lights the
[3673.48 - 3676.48] way
