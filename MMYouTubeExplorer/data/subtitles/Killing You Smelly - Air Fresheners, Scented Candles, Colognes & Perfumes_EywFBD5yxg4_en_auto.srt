kind of level of a podcast

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,519

for listening and everything um my

123
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
husband suffers from perfumes

124
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,120
i saw that the comments are going up and

125
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,319

read the rest of it

127
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,319

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
becomes you that's what happens what you

129
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,479
smell becomes you

130

if you smell it it's already inside you

131
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,680
so the minute you smell something those

132
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,880
chemicals are already inside of you

133
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,320

we go through life with all kinds of

144
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
different things that even happen on a

145
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,759

they're a human right they're human

163

you're human too if you're not sensitive

164
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,919
but you're still being affected just

165
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,479
like they are

166
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,600

377
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,279
you and you know the funny thing is

378
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,720
is that when you're saying that i'm

379
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,800
giggling during the show a little during

380
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,760
the real hard moments of information

381
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,480
that's how i've always coped my whole

382
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,240
life

383
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
because since i was four years old and

384
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,600
spirit of compassion started speaking to

385
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,920
me and giving me

386
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,680
scary information about the world and

387
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,120
about people suffering and about answers

388
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
to why people are sick that are like in

389
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,680
the cleanse of heal book right behind me

390
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,399
and what happens is that it's always

391
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,839
been hard

392
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,680
it's always been hard for me because i

393
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,200
feel people's pain i feel they're

394
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
suffering i feel what they're going

395
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,600
through

396
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,680
so one of the ways i've always coped is

397
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,440
i try to keep some joy still

398
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,079
within my heart and so i i giggle

399
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,480
i giggle a little and and chuckle a

400
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,279
little

401
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,519
in in a way it's how i cope with

402
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,200
terrible news

403
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,120

404
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,800

so happy so so glad you like you guys

529
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,040
like it so i want to say about the brain

530
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,280
meditation for a minute

531
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,720
just so you know what the brain

532
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,559
meditation does

533
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,480
is it bridges the gap that happens with

534
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,000
our neurons we get physical injuries

535
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,679
with our emotional center the neurons in

536
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,839
the emotional center of the brain

537
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,319
when we get bad news and breakups and

538
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,559
betrayal and broken trust and losses

539
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,760
and friends friendship issues and

540
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,520
everything else we've ever had in our

541
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,640
lives and and terrible losses and all

542
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,200
kinds of things

543
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,320
and promises broken all of that when we

544
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,080
go through life

545
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,480
what happens is every time we get some

546
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,120
bad news we end up getting some ptsd and

547
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,200
our

548
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
soul gets shocked out of us and it gets

549
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,240
shocked out of us and shocked out of us

550
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,760
and a distance occurs

551
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,080
and when that distance occurs this is

552
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,080
just being just beat out of us

553
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,840
basically when we go through hardships

554
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,440
what happens is fear fills in the center

555
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,320
so all this fear fills in the center

556
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
between

557
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,080
the soul and the physical brain and when

558
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,720
that fear fills in the center

559
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,400
it stays there and we just we live in

560
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,320
this whole thing where we're

561
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
we're highly sensitive we're fearful

562
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,320
we've got

563
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,960
trust issues that don't heal all of it

564
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,440
and

565
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,840
and then we also make decisions that may

566
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,440
not be the best because of the fear

567
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,160
this brain meditation okay bridges that

568
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,400
gap

569
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,080
not only does it the more you do it you

570
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
heal the neuron in this in the emotional

571
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,559
center of the brain

572
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,919
the more you do the brain meditation do

573
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,000
it every single day

574
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,240
every single night you fall asleep doing

575
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,840
it if you want it heals that

576
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,440
that those those neurons that get

577
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,720
tattered and burnt

578
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,400
out like burnt out from

579
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,240
trouble we go through bad news and

580
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,640
hardships just get burnt out

581
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,520
what happens is in the soul just comes

582
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,360
closer

583
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,120
and it just bridges the gap and the fear

584
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,200
disappears when you do that meditation

585
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,880
it's hard to explain with like this

586
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,760
but when you're in that meditation

587
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,880
you'll feel it you'll feel it

588
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,200
um let's see rebecca jean says could you

589
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,120

590
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,520

591
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,960
uh i'm going to do an episode on lupus

592
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,160

section of cleanse the heal

and you'll see you'll see in that when

598
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,679

is in the description so

691
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,559
um really incredible so if you have

692
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,760
brain the thing is with chemical

693
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,360
sensitivities

694
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,159
brain fog migraines chronic sinusitis

695
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,520
eye problems chest tightness depression

696
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,080
burning skin

697
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,000
what happens is these chemical soups

698
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,559
we're like the rat

699
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,400
we're like the test animals we're like

700
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,200
the test subjects the rats

701
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,679
as these chemical soups are tested upon

702
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,360
us

703
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,200
and they can trigger off anxiety they

704
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,240
can trigger off migraines it can trigger

705
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,120
off brain fog

706
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
that's what these things can do and so

707
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,840
important to know

708
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,159

mercury is really real toxic heavy

716
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,960
metals like mercury

717
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,720

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,880
system they affect the optic nerve they

719
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,360
