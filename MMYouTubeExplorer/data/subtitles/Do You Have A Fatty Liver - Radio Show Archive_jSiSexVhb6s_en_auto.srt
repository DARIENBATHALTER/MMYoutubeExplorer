health information out there it's

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,800
important to know that because it's

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,240
decades ahead of what's out there now

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,719

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,000
illness in chronic illness and it's

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,120
important to know because you can work

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,079
on healing and not have to wait 10 20 30

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,879
years for answers we're talking about

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,399
Liver Rescue but we're talking about

19
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,879
fatty liver which is actually in the

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,239
liver rescue book this is really

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,800
important fatty liver is a big deal and

22
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,719
I want to cover it cover it as if you

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,480
don't think you have fatty liver think

24
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,840
again because there's pre pre pre fatty

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,199
liver basically fat buildup in the liver

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,120
over time before could even be diagnosed

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,400
so it's really important to know how it

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,520
works with fatty liver so that's where

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,880
we're really going going into it I mean

30
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,159
who has 5 10 years for answers 15 years

31
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,360
for answers to wait I mean to wait and

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,000
wait and wait because you you know you

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,720
lose time and that's the whole thing

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,360
with chronic illness people lose time I

35
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,479
mean there's so many people that were I

36
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,680
mean diagnosed or not diagnosed with so

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,759
many different conditions with

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,680
neurological problems symptoms all kinds

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,680
of different symptoms Galore everything

40
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,479
different diagnoses and they you know

41
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,119
they had to go from Doctor to doctor to

42
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,680
doctor including with lime and multiple

43
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:37,159
sclerosis and getting diagnosed with

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,640
this and that and Hashimoto and

45
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,880

46
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,240
answers and and I've given answers to

47
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,719
people to get them free to escape that

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,399
whole trap and that marry go round of of

49
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,719
having to go to everywhere doctor to

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,079
doctor and going through all these

51
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,600
different treatments and everything else

52
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:57,079
there are ways of actually healing there

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,039
are ways of getting out of that trap and

54
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,960
there are ways of getting out of mystery

55
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:05,000
illness there really really is tens of

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,399
thousands and now hundreds of thousands

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,280
and even close to Millions now at this

58
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,440
point are getting answers like with the

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,040
celery juice turning their lives around

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,920
and with other things that we brought

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,319
here so the whole point is look there's

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,280
so much to learn and with fatty liver we

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,319
got a lot to learn and it's all about

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,840
Liver Rescue it's in Liver Rescue so if

65
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,280
you don't have the Liver Rescue book um

66
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,080
you know one thing just you know

67
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,200
whatever you do the book is so big and

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,080
there's so much information in it that

69
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,640
you just you can't get it from the radio

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,519
show it's just not going to happen I

71
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,480
could do a string of radio shows and

72
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,519
it's not going to happen so if you can't

73
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,760
afford a book for whatever it is $15 $20

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,239
or whatever it is go go to the library

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
and uh take out the book there or

76
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,879

is where we are that's where we're going

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,879

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,400

82
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,920

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,959
it's how it works and we're under stress

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,000
we're under pressure and it can hold us

88
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,920

mean I mean usually we you know yeah how

119
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,840
do you live like that it's not easy it's

120
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,639
not easy not everybody has that those

121
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,320
resources to go into the health food

122
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,720
stores either I noticed that and

123
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,360
actually just buy all the fresh produce

124
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840
they can possibly buy and all the

125
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,960
whatever the leanest cuts of meat if you

126
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,520
like animal protein and if you're in and

127
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,880
if you're and if you're vegan or plant-

128
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,600
paste all the whatever it is that you

129
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,800
want and get avocados and all the other

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,520
things and all the different fruits and

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,240
vegetables and it's it's amazing how

132
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,000
it's not so easy and if we're treading

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,600
or back treading or whatever is

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,440
backpedaling through life and we got all

135
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,199
these jobs and responsibilities and got

136
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,320
bills and got this and that and not much

137
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,960
money or whatever it is that's going on

138
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,320
and then chronic illness hits and

139
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,160
chronic illness it's sick you're just

140
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,520
trying to push through the day and

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,320
there's nothing really easy about it and

142
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,120
so what can happen is you end up eating

143
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,880
a donut you end up eating a donut and

144
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,680
maybe when life was good for some I've

145
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,400
had people tell me hey life was the best

146
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,360
ever when I was able to eat donuts and I

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,039
was doing good and I was working a

148
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,880
zillion hours and I could just scoff

149
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,560
down a whole crab load of donuts and be

150
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,360
back off to work it was no big deal

151
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,160
that's the good old days you know what I

152
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,479
mean so maybe it's that maybe it's the

153
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,160
opposite for somebody but you end up you

154
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,560
know like when life's ult and everything

155
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,560
you can end up eating a donut because

156
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,800
you may be on the Run trying to keep up

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,840
the demanding

158
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,360
schedule and and all of that and you

159
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,639
might look you might be out of time and

160
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,039
can't find another option in the moment

161
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,600
or hey I'll have that slice of pizza

162
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,560
someone may decide easily because it's

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
easy get a slice of pizza and they're

164
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,280

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,319
two or a slice of bacon a little here

185
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,360
and a little there these are foods that

186
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,960
get us by when life is harder and goes

187
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,720
faster than we can keep up with I mean

188
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,440
am I right or am I wrong I don't know

189
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:56,000
maybe I'm wrong maybe I got it all

190
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,680
wrong so whether we know it or not we

191
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,120
eat like this to get by we eat like this

192
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,720
to survive

193
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,680
sometimes we eat like this for happiness

194
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,479
of course too we're up against all the

195
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,800
world it's impossible we get all wound

196
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,960
up we get emotional it's completely

197
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,800
understandable I mean if we eat foods to

198
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,639
comfort ourselves I mean yeah like we do

199
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,560
and you know we we want flavors to

200
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,160
satisfi our satisfy our cravings and

201
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,160
even get a sense of companionship

202
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,720
absolutely absolutely but if we were

203
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,680
more conscious about food you know we

204
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,479
had a little less going on maybe we

205
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,960
would take care of ourselves I

206
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,639
understand I do and and what if we're

207
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,639
fortunate what if somebody's fortunate

208
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,160
and they have they have the resources to

209
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,639
pursue all kinds of other ways of eating

210
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,800
and you know they can look at a trendy

211
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,120
diet right they can get into a trendy

212
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,840
diet that seems incredibly healthy

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,680
they'll go less often on a croissant or

214
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,039
pizza they'll go less less often on

215
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,479
pizza and they'll look for leaner cuts

216
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,840
of meat and and cut out all grains and

217
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,479
processed foods like all the trendy

218
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,479
diets want you to do right they all want

219
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,840
you to do that go with leaner cuts of

220
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,720
meat bring in lots of vegetables and

221
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,599
make sure and don't eat any fruit don't

222
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,759
eat any fruit and and you know avoid all

223
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,080
fruit whatever you do that's what they

224
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,000
do right and it's like cut out all

225
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,759
carbohydrates maybe we can do that one

226
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,800
of those trendy diets and isn't that the

227
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,360
answer isn't that the answer to do one

228
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,639
of those trendy diets you guys me leaner

229
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,240

processed foods right

231
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,680
you know clean things up stay away from

232
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,320
the grains the whole bit bring in some

233
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,000
bone broth right well that's cool could

234
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,680
go to yoga afterwards after you know

235
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,200
what I mean get some bone broth in you

236
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,160
you know the whole bit and make sure

237
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,640
we're doing some chicken chicken on a

238
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,200
salad or something like that we're

239
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,839
trying to follow these cool trendy diets

240

we'll do an egg a hard-boiled egg in our

241
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,720
salad and maybe that's better than all

242
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,800
the processed foods and having a slice

243
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,480
of pizza and doing this and that and

244
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,399
maybe it is kind of better but it is is

245
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,279
it the answer not as much as you would

246
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,959
think trust me on that not as much as

247
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,760
you would think it's the answer when it

248
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,360

431
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,079
is but I'll tell you right now I mean I

432
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,519
don't think it's that fine I'll tell you

433
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,320
right now because isn't it about getting

434
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,480
someone better learning the truth

435
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,920
understanding the truth and getting them

436
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,800
better isn't it about really proactively

437
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,680
making sure someone doesn't get sick

438
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,160
because it's so awful when someone gets

439
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,199
sick and they stay sick and their life

440
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,279
goes they're I mean I've seen people

441
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:20,079
lose things I've seen people lose

442
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,000
everything from being

443
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,360
sick

444
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,480
everything you there's a lot of homeless

445
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,519
people out there you don't think a whole

446
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,440
bunch of them weren't sick it's

447
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,800
unbelievable of how it works and so the

448
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,959
compassion has to be there and it has to

449
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,639
be there and it has to stop any chronic

450
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,000
illness and it has the information has

451
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,839
to be there someone said what's the

452
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,319
point of your books I said what do you

453
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,639
mean what's the point of the

454
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:49,519
books what do you mean the point is to

455
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,440
make sure that you can protect your

456
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,000
family protect your children make sure

457
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,040
you have the answer so when you do get

458
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,040
sick neurologically or anything I don't

459
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,079
care what it is you can actually do

460
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,440
something about it just like the celery

461
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:03,639
juice that nobody knew about no one knew

462
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,600
about until we brought it to town and

463
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,160
then it gets it gets it gets destroyed

464
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,720
out there it gets destroyed out there

465
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,600
cuz people are just they all of a sudden

466
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,800
you know like don't do this do this do

467
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,120
this whatever all these people like

468
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,720
these just making up stuff meanwhile

469
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,079
here's where it comes from here's what

470
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,000
you do with the celery juice and it gets

471
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,079
rid of fatty liver cuz what happens is

472
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,399
once your liver starts getting

473
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:28,600
fatty everything else starts going down

474
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:32,600
the drain slowly you age your skin a

475
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,240
ages everything ages along the way and

476
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,360
you just you all of a sudden your liver

477
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,440
just says hey hey ho we're done we're

478
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,959
done I can't really protect you so much

479
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,440
anymore so all those toxins are going to

480
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,120
just age your skin really quick you're

481
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,040
going to stretch it out it's not going

482
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,800
to bounce back you're going to have all

483
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,920
this acne keep on coming and going

484
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,440
you're going to have all this other

485
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,800
stuff keep on going these skin problems

486
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,800
it's not even just that you're going to

487
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,480
have all these heart stuff later on down

488
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,600
the road you know the thing is with the

489
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,480
younger crowd they don't think they're

490
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,839
ever going to be 60 years old they don't

491
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,600
think they're going to be 60 years old

492
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,720
they don't I've talked to people they

493
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,400
don't they don't believe it they don't

494
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,919
believe it they don't believe they're

495
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,760
ever going to be

496
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,240
60 is the craziest thing they don't

497
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,319
believe they're going to be 40 you know

498
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,640
back many many years ago a few decades

499
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,160
ago when I was doing this cuz I was

500
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,679
doing it and the information was just as

501
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,280
advanced as it is now in fact it's the

502
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,559
same information how do you like them

503
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,440
apples and all the books the medic

504
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,000
medium series information I was giving

505
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,679
30 years ago that people say is Advanced

506
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,160
even people say the doctors say And

507
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,720
scientists even say that this is where

508
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
where it's going in medicine as far as

509
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,200
this is the most advanced information

510
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,080
out there in chronic health I knew that

511
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,480
information 30 years ago cuz it all came

512
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,600
from the same Source but I remember

513
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,039
talking to younger people back 30 years

514
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,880
ago people did think they were going to

515
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,960
be 60 years old someday they did think

516
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,679
they were going to be

517
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:00,200
55 they did think they were going to be

518
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:03,159
64 now the the younger crowd they don't

519
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,360
think they're going to be 60 it's

520
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,679
unbelievable and and that's not good

521
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,120
because it makes you not want to really

522
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:10,919
take care of yourself to actually look

523
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,240
out so that's just one aspect of it but

524
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,600

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,200
think it's not all roses and authors

543
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,360
know that it's not all roses it's not

544
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,039
how it works if you can't afford a book

545
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,919
whatever the download is or whatever the

546
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,840
print print is I don't know what the

547
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,960
download is 13 14 15 bucks or the print

548
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,559
or whatever it is you can't afford one

549
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,559
to go to the library and get

550
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:11,159
one what happens is that that um that

551
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,039
when it comes down to blood and your

552
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:16,640
blood the more fat inside the blood

553
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:19,120
constantly on an everyday basis a

554
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,679
barrage of fat that we enter into our

555
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,000
bloodstream will create that pre- pre

556
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,559
fatty liver that won't be diagnosed it

557
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,440
will create that condition now a lot of

558
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:31,240
you are probably who cares about fatty

559
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,799
liver maybe you didn't even want to

560
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,440
listen to the show because hey I don't

561
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,200
have fatty liver who cares who even

562
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,120
gives a crap who cares I mean I I know

563
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,400
that because because when you talk to

564
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,840
people about fatty liver they're like oh

565
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:49,080
that's not me I don't have any fatty

566
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,679
liver yeah sure sure because you know

567
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,600
what happens is that the majority of the

568
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,720
country has a fatty liver it's in

569
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,600
different stages that's the whole point

570
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,159
and why is a fatty liver even B bad why

571
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,559
is the pre fatty liver even bad it's bad

572
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,080
because other symptoms and conditions

573
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:10,360
you have are based upon that fatty

574
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,320
liver I mean literally other symptoms

575
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,720
easily because chronic illness which is

576
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,840
are like viruses and sign of our liver

577
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,880
they Prosper they proliferate they grow

578
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,960
they do their thing because you can have

579
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,679
a because of the fatty liver and the

580
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,159
high foot and the high fat in the

581
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:31,120
bloodstream and that that that's how it

582
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,120
works just basic CFS that me CFS chronic

583
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,200
fatigue

584
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,080
syndrome that right there if you if

585
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,440
you're bombarding yourself with fats all

586
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,919
these years and you end up developing

587
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,039
Epstein bar related chronic fatigue

588
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,200
syndrome because that's what it all is

589
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,039
you end up you you end up developing

590
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,679
that and then what happens your liver's

591
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,039
sluggish it's doggish totally sluggish

592
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,440
not functioning

593
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:55,960
good and and it's get it's it's preatty

594
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,679
and it's all in the way of healing from

595
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,720
even chronic fatigue syndrome do you see

596
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,080
how this works Hashim modus thyroiditis

597
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,080
which is Epstein bar related where the

598
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,799
Epstein bar virus drills itself into the

599
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,600
thyroid and gives people gives gives

600
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,480
people

601
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,559
hypothyroidism that virus starts out in

602
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,360
the liver liver gets sluggish gets fatty

603
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,960
gets pre fatty gets

604
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,360
doggish and then what happens it it the

605
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,080
virus you know proliferates it grows it

606
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,640
moves forward it prospers it lives a

607
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,279
very good life it drills into other

608
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,840
glands such as the thyroid and so forth

609
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:27,480
I what about multiple sclerosis I'm just

610
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,240
giving you these basic ones I there so

611
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,440
there's hundreds ones I could ramble off

612
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,279
what about multiple sceris Ms same thing

613
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,720
all starts with a virus in the liver and

614
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,360
the virus gets doggish the immune system

615
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,480
in the in in the liver can't fight off

616
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,000
the virus easy and the liver gets

617
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,640
sluggish stagnant doggish the whole bit

618
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,360
and what happens is the virus Prosper

619
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,600
does its thing creates a whole bunch of

620
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,159
neurotoxins gives rings off a whole

621
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,880
bunch of different diagnoses including

622
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,600
multiple sclerosis including Lyme

623
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,520
disease the hope it everybody that's

624
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,640
ever had a diagnosis of lime has a liver

625
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,200

that's in trouble that needs

630
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,080
help and when the liver starts getting

631
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,080
better and you start taking care of it

632
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,039
then you can get anything better

633
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,640
anything and everything better how do

634
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:25,880
you like that I'm going to say it again

635
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,679
when the liver gets taken care of when

636
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,120
it's

637
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,159
nurtured when it's brought back to

638
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,200
health even when you don't know it's the

639
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,880
problem or something's going on inside

640
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,640
there in the whole bit and it's being

641
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,880
brought back to health when the liver is

642
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,559
cared for and coddled and loved and

643
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,919

mission since I was young and the only

spread out far and wide and get into

652
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:05,760
somebody's hands and to get in

726
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,240

yourself and you can't get confused by

728
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,960
someone who hasn't applied themselves

741
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,360
that's the deal blood thickness is the

742
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,880

745
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,559
thickness it breaks the

liver that's what it does really

747
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,480
important to know you know what doctors

748
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,760
are supposed to say when you go into

749
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,840
when you go into um the doctor's office

750
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,799
you know what they're supposed to say

751
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,480
let me give you a window okay this is

752
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:35,679
the window so somebody goes into the

753
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:39,360
doctor's office all right and and and

754
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:43,120
Physicians need they need a simple blood

755
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,480
test in their possession it would

756
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,320
literally turn medicine around it

757
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,159
doesn't exist but it would be a miracle

758
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,320
if it did a miracle they need a blood

759
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:56,399
fat tester that's what they need to

760
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,440
determine blood fat

761
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:59,679
levels you you just you know how like

762
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,520
when you you know you're doing the blood

763
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,399
sugar diabetics they need the you know

764
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,279
you prick the finger literally you just

765
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:06,799
need you don't even need it to be like

766
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,200
that it could be literally something you

767
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,080
stick under your armpit for a minute to

768
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,320
determine your blood fat

769
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,880
ratio and this is different this isn't

770
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,440
your fat your your your fat ratio like

771
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,399
if you hop on a scale this is blood fat

772
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,360
so it would measure it would measure

773
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:26,919
okay your blood fat levels just like

774
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,679
diabetics when they they measure their

775
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,840
blood glucose Coast

776
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,559
levels and this is what it's supposed to

777
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,039
be when you get a physical exam so the

778
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,559
doctor can instantly say whoa what was

779
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,480

you're going to develop a fatty liver

784
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,880
gout or heart disease or kidney disease

785
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,159
or kidney failure for all that high

786
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,720
fat even if it's healthy diets or trendy

787
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,799
diets that are healthy that are high fat

788
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,960
they're not even supposed to be even

789
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,360

by the way and the person would say well

793
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,440
I ate at a restaurant last night and I

794
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,440
ordered chicken with broccoli I thought

795
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,600
it was a pretty healthy dish chicken

796
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,279
with broccoli okay well what was

797
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,840
yesterday's lunch that was yesterday's

798
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:21,480
dinner what was yesterday's lunch the

799
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,320
doctor should say oh I had a turkey club

800
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,480
on a gluten-free bread on gluten-free

801
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,279
bread and I really didn't eat much of

802
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,159
the bread I just kind of ate the turkey

803
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:33,360
club little bit of cheese and turkey or

804
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:37,080
whatever I thought that was good lots of

805
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,440
protein right lots of protein okay well

806
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,720
what was your yesterday's breakfast the

807
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,440
doctor should ask well let's see I had

808
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,080
two eggs I had a slice of healthy bacon

809
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,399
it was free range or it was you know

810
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,159
farm raised and it was it was a healthy

811
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,039
bacon and um and I skipped the toast

812
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,799
because I'm you know decided to be low

813
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,720
carb have a low carb free

814
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,200
morning the doctor should should lean

815
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,919
forward and say that's great you skip

816
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,039
the toast what we really need to be

817
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,360
concerned about though is how much fat

818
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:10,240
is in your

819
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,720
diet a simple blood test I just did for

820
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,039
you is showing high fat in your

821
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,799
bloodstream and if it's been high fat

822
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,840
for a very long time because this has

823
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,320
been your diet and even even worse diet

824
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,519
even before you're eating kind of

825
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,039
healthy then we're in trouble so

826
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:30,200
recapping all the meals indicates that

827
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,200
it's always consistently high and you

828
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,679
know what you're

829
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,279
doing the doctor should say you're

830
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,799
starving your liver of oxygen you're

831
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:40,720
setting the stage for cancer you're

832
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,279
setting the stage for illness and

833
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,360
disease yes you're setting the stage for

834
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:50,000
cancer even on a healthy high fat High

835
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,960
trendy diet that's right that's right

836
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,840
you don't have to eat wheat of course

837
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,039
good job doctor should say you don't

838
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,559
have to have

839
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:00,159
wheat exactly exactly but maybe you

840
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,600
should bring in a little bit more leafy

841
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,919
greens a little bit more fruit and the

842
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,080
person might say well I'm not on any

843
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,760
fruit I'm I can't eat any fruit I'm I'm

844
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,960
not allowed to have fruit I don't want

845
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,960
to get diabetes I don't want

846
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,240
fruit and you should actually doctor

847
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,480
should say you should even try some

848
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,919
healthy carbohydrates clean

849
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,080
ones and some more extra

850
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,840
vegetables that's how the medical world

851
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,720
should work on planet Earth planet Earth

852
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,039
is

853
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,320
backwards it's backwards when it comes

854
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,919
down to the health of the human race it

855
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,480
always has been don't get me wrong

856
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,679
there's life-saving technology and

857
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,760
life-saving Medicine absolutely you

858
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,320
better believe it but I'm talking about

859
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,840
chronic illness whole different

860
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,559
thing whole different

861
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,039
thing okay big difference it's like lamb

862
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,120
and chicken big

863
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,080
difference I'm just straight I'm just

864
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,960
saying it straight so you know the whole

865
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,720
thing

866
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,679
is the doctor should have the concern

867
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,760
that it shouldn't be about the sugar and

868
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,120
the carbs it should be about the fat and

869
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,240
it shouldn't be about fruit being

870
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,559
eliminated you don't want the fruit

871
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,399
eliminated I mean that should be a

872
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,799
concern you don't want fruit eliminated

873
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,559
sadly blaming sugar as the cause of even

874
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,320
a fatty liver is a huge mistake in the

875
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:20,480
health industry right

876
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,200
now this mistake exists because sugar is

877
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,480
never eaten on its own it's always eaten

878
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:29,039
with fat once again causing problems

879
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,360
it's not the sugar that's the

880
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:35,559
problem see fat and sugar are always

881
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,399
eaten together so then all the so-called

882
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:39,320
experts are like get rid of the sugar

883
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:40,960
and they see improvements temporarily in

884
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,279
a lot of people but they're still

885
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,600
getting fatty liver and they're going to

886
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,840
still get sick down the road and they're

887
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,480
still going to get chronic illness down

888
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,519
the road even on the most trendiest nice

889
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,919
clean

890
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,200
diets because the problem was sugar and

891
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,480
fat together and it really hurts the

892
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,639
liver that's what it really is and it's

893
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,960
not the sugar part it's the fat part

894
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:02,919
that's the irony but the sugar gets the

895
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,080
blame unbelievable if this is too

896
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:09,120
mind-blowing for you listen to the show

897
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,080
again listen to it again until a little

898
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,559
voice of reason pops up

899
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:17,120
somewhere and says you know what you're

900
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,039
right how why would you fill your blood

901
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,279
blood with fat Non-Stop and starve your

902
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:24,399
blood of

903
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,200
oxygen and and yeah and fatten up the

904
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,559
liver so it becomes more dysfunctional

905
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,639

blood fat is high anything it's not just

925
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,600
about stupid fatty liver and I say

926
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,360
stupid fatty liver because yeah like

927
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,039
fatty liver you guys like oh who's got a

928
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,799
fatty liver who's got a fatty liver

929
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,440
isn't that for older people they finally

930
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,000
get diagnosed with a fatty liver oh

931
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:38,279
that's not me no no no it's way bigger

932
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,720
than that it's way bigger than that and

933
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,760
the fact is we do eat sugar with fat all

934
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,720
the time happens all the

935
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,600
time so when you think about it it's

936
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,159
always it's like it's an unhealthy fat

937
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,240
too sometimes in many in many different

938
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,639
situations no one's sitting around

939
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,639
eating gobs of Standalone sugar they're

940
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:00,799
mixing it in coffee and cream they're

941
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:03,159
having it in cakes and cookies and

942
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,000
pastries along with fat in every last

943
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:09,320
one of those it's in barbecue sauce

944
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,760
which goes on pulled pork which is fat

945
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,520
that's sugar and fat it's eaten As a

946
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,320
treat such as candy cane a candy cane

947
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,079
after a high-fat Festival meal not

948
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,480
acknowledging that sugar is always

949
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,000
consumed with fat is a prime example of

950
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,760
both the conventional medical and

951
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,919
Alternative Health Industries operating

952
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,879
with blinders on basically the AL

953
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:29,839
alternative industry and the

954
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:32,440
conventional industry is

955
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,919
blind they have tunnel vision that only

956
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,280
allows sugar into view but not fat which

957
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:41,240
is protein and that's the problem and

958
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,960
when a theory is seen from that limited

959
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,720
perspective it's easily becoming law and

960
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,480
you'll see it on all the doctor shows

961
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,520
you'll see it on all the whatever you'll

962
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,159
see it on all the channels and the

963
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,919
networks it's all about oh carbs and get

964
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,800
rid of your sugar oh drop all that

965
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:00,400
you'll see it it's like a virus

966
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,240
itself and just protein protein no

967
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,720
they're not saying it's fat fat

968
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,440
protein's fat and just bringing and

969
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,640
bringing and I'm not saying you have to

970
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,720
live in a box and not ever have if

971
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,560
you're into animal protein not ever have

972
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,000
some animal protein if you're into if

973
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,720
you're into if you're vegan or something

974
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,240
in in plant-based not having avocado

975
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,280
it's not about that it's about the fact

976
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,520
of how many years and especially if

977
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,320
you're chronically ill if you want to

978
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,960
get better you got to stop the fats for

979
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,560
sure you got to lower the fats maybe

980
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,280
even stop them completely shut them down

981
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,720
and learn how to eat without it I give

982
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,280
the answers in all the books how to eat

983
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,760
fat free I do I do and maybe it's about

984
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,240
that if you're chronic Le because I've

985
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,720
seen it save lives and turn around

986
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,680
people's lives that never could heal

987
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,640
from any kind of lime never could heal

988
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,800
from any kind of Ms never could heal

989
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,240
from anything serious chronic fatigue

990
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
syndrome for so many years never could

991
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,240
heal from anything and they got fat free

992
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,560
they got fat free doing lots of leafy

993
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,240
greens lots of celery juice lots of

994
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,640
fruit they brought it in and it turned

995
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,119
their lives around and they got better

996
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,280
and and they started building muscle and

997
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:03,960
they got out of they got out of the bed

998
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,720
that's right that's right no other diet

999
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,599
could have done it and didn't do it no

1000
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,760
other diet but I get it the trendy diets

1001
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,400
are the people that are living their

1002
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,880
life feeling relatively kind of good

1003
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,880
just got a little weight on them they

1004
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,880
take out the processed foods knock out

1005
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,359
all that get on some trendy exercise

1006
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,560
program and they think they struck gold

1007
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:27,520
Eureka no no no no no it doesn't work

1008
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:33,240
like that it doesn't

1009
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:36,240
so so sugar with fat you guys is the

1010
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,640
problem and when it's healthier sugar

1011
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,480
with healthier fat it's less of a

1012
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,839
problem but still a

1013
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,040
problem and so the fats have to lower or

1014
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:48,960
get reduced so they're not saturating

1015
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,560
the bloodstream you have fats once a day

1016
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,800
if you're into you know some animal

1017
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,119
protein eat animal protein once every

1018
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:00,240
other day and learn how to eat more

1019
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:01,800

1023
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:13,040

a whole bunch of bringing even bring in

1026
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,880
avocado avocado is lower fat believe it

1027
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,000
or not so one thing the vegans and the

1028
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,359
the vegans have is that when they do

1029
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,160
high fat like the avocado it's still

1030
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,359
lower than than animal protein fat which

1031
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,599
which makes it so they could eat a

1032
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:32,119
little bit more often unless they're

1033
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,640
really struggling with an illness then

1034
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,079
just fat free is

1035
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,640
important but when you're animal protein

1036
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,040
you bring the animal proteins down hey

1037
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,400
if you're vegan you're vegan and plant-

1038
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,839
based you bring all those nuts and seeds

1039
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,800
down you bring those oils down too you

1040
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,359
bring all that down too you have to you

1041
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,240
have to when you get rid of you can get

1042
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,119
the liver cleaned

1043
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,440
up and sure you can have some fats once

1044
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,560
in a while and you can use it under the

1045
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,640
GU of protein people are in like denial

1046
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,400

00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,160
unbelievable they think protein has no

1048

bloodstream how do you like that that

1086
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,760
actually keep

1087
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:32,599
that actually help Drive oxygen that you

1088
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,319
inhaled in your

1089
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:37,200
lungs and when we breathe oxygen and

1090
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:40,520
it's filled the pollutants every single

1091
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,480
day like it is those antioxidants and a

1092
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,599
piece of fruit help to block those

1093
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,359
pollutant so the oxygen gets clean it's

1094
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,839
clean and it goes into the bloodstream

1095
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:51,520
clean that little fat pack the person

1096
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:53,160
had on the TV commercial with the little

1097
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,079
squares of turkey and the little squares

1098
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,319
of cheese and and and the almonds that

1099
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:59,480
fat pack does nothing for for that you

1100
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:02,119
you you all that does is cause oxygen to

1101
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,480
diminish in your in your in your body

1102
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:05,960
and stay dirty and keep the blood dirty

1103
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,760
and keep the blood dehydrated which is

1104
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,160
the next point if your blood Fat's too

1105
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,040
high if it's too high you got the least

1106
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,160
amount of oxygen in there but you got Le

1107
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,720
you got the least amount of water it

1108
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,760
pushes water out in a bad way it makes

1109
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,599
you

1110
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,839
dehydrated and that gives you an

1111
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,400
illusion of losing weight when people go

1112
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,800
on these high-fat diets they actually

1113
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,280
don't know these high protein high fat

1114
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,599
diets no carbs and they're not doing any

1115
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,400
fresh

1116
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,160
fruit with with they're getting

1117
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,800
dehydrated and they're like whoa I'm

1118
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,480
actually losing weight really quick out

1119
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,440
of nowhere no you're not losing fat

1120
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,480
really quick out of nowhere you're

1121
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,079
losing water weight and you end up

1122
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,760
getting dehydrated it's a whole another

1123
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,000
thing the higher the fat is in the

1124
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,800
bloodstream on a daily basis the less

1125
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,839
water in there and the liver needs water

1126
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,520
to cleanse it it needs oxygen to keep it

1127
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:58,040
alive because the bloodstream driving

1128
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,240
straight into your your liver is low in

1129
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,760
oxygen naturally it has very little

1130
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,520
oxygen in it and it's filled with

1131
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,160
poisons toxins and then really good

1132
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,119
nutrients going into that bloodstream

1133
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,800
and it's going in the liver and the

1134
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,640
liver has to sort it all out and when

1135
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,599
the liver has to sort it all out with a

1136
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,960
big pile of fat in the bloodstream thick

1137
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,400
blood fill the fat going into that liver

1138
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,040
and it has to store it out to try to get

1139
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,720
nutrients out to find try to find

1140
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,359
Precious Precious valuable glucose

1141
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,280
somewhere to keep it alive so the liver

1142
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:25,720
can keep alive so the liver can send

1143
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,319
that glucose right up to the heart and

1144
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,880
then up to the brain because guess what

1145
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,760
your brain runs on sugar it doesn't run

1146
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,680
on

1147
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,400
fat your brain has traces the tiniest

1148
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,800
traces of omegas in there and guess what

1149
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,240
you can get those from a pack of

1150
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,920
blackberries the brain is made out of

1151
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,000
sugar glucose glycogen it shrinks on

1152
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,800
people because of years and years and

1153
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,760
years of having fat in the

1154
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,680
bloodstream and it's a brain shrinker it

1155
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,319
shrinks the

1156
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,800
brain high fat high protein no matter

1157
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,400
what it is whether it's a vegan diet

1158
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,079
whether it's a paleo diet whether it's a

1159
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,680
hell just come up with a new name and

1160
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,079
there are some new names out there for

1161
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,119
diets I'm not going to I'm not going to

1162
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:08,800
mention the names cuz it's like you know

1163
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm not trying to attack any personal

1164
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,160
doctors and other people I I'm not it's

1165
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,880
not about attacking people it's the same

1166
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,520
kind of thing it's all the same stuff

1167
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,040
it's a trendy high fat High you know

1168
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:22,800
high protein diets it's not like

1169
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,599
whatever but what it is is it's a brain

1170
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,599
shrinker diet that's what it is cuz your

1171
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:32,319
brain is glycogen stored glycogen

1172
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:35,040
stored it's sugar it has to be it's the

1173
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,720
only way to keep the brain cool it's the

1174
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,200
only way to keep it cool so it doesn't

1175
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:45,240
burn up it doesn't burn

1176
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:49,240
up the concern about fevers is that they

1177
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,559
cook the brain that's what in medicine

1178
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,720
the concern is it's a very good

1179
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:58,160
concern because you don't want to cook

1180
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,160
the brain and that's with fevers

1181
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,800
the brain is a delicate delicate

1182
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,920
delicate thing and it's filled with

1183
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,920
glucose to protect it so it doesn't cook

1184
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,920
the glucose diminishes over time in the

1185
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,160
brain of somebody and they're on a

1186
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,079
chronic high-fat diet all the time for

1187
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,079
many years and the liver sluggish or

1188
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:18,520
doggish or whatever it is turns into

1189
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:21,480
pref fatty liver whatever it is it

1190
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:24,440
doesn't whatever would happens is the

1191
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:29,559
brain suffers over time as the years and

1192
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,559
years go on and the Brain

1193
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,200
atrophies but you wouldn't know when

1194
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,240
you're just like okay you're eating bad

1195
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,960
anyway then you pop onto a trendy high

1196
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,040
fat diet with high protein diet and you

1197
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,280
think you're doing stuff you're good and

1198
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,400
you are it's a stage it's a step but it

1199
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,720
doesn't stop there and you got to learn

1200
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,559
one vital vital thing critical thing one

1201
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,119
vital critical thing you got to lower

1202
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:53,599
the fats whatever diet you subscribe to

1203
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,520
you have to lower the

1204
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,680
fats you I don't take sides because it's

1205
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:01,599
not about taking sides it's about

1206
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,240
delivering you the information that no

1207
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,319
one else

1208
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,400
has and you need that

1209
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,680
information if you don't need it you

1210
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,720
don't think you need it fine fine that's

1211
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,119
fine with

1212
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,640
me it's all right I respect that totally

1213
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,079
respect that and you can kick dirt in my

1214
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,240
face too man I'm pretty tough I totally

1215
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:24,800
respect

1216
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,520
that but I would take the information

1217
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,920
work on your healing process move

1218
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,359
forward bite the bullet work on it do it

1219
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,839
that's what I would

1220
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,480
do blood fat stops oxygen it stops

1221
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,720
oxygen it dehydrates you it stops water

1222
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,280
it stops

1223
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,040
water it's not possible to lock down a

1224
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,640
standard oxygen percentage of blood

1225
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,040
entering the liver because it depends on

1226
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,920
what somebody's eating science and

1227
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,640
research will never be able to know the

1228
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,640
percentage of oxygen that's going inside

1229
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,119
the liver with the blood that heads up

1230
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,119
heads up up the highway the hepatic

1231
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,240
portal vein right into the liver they'll

1232
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,359
never be able to determine this because

1233
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,920
everybody's eating different and

1234
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,520
everybody's on these high fat diets so

1235
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,920
it's going to ratio different this is

1236
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,400
all advanced stuff by the way in the

1237
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,160
liver rescue book I mean science that

1238
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,040
even know that they're not even thinking

1239
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,680
to do something like that and they

1240
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,760
should maybe 30 years they'll have that

1241
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,960
test that's what I mean by being

1242
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,760
Advanced it's the whole

1243
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,440
point so that's the whole deal is you've

1244
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,920
got to be careful with that much of the

1245
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,119
rest of the blood entering through

1246
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,520
thetic portal vein is carrying toxins

1247
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,680
pathogens viruses

1248
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,960
Pharmaceuticals minerals vitamins

1249
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,400
enzymes amino acids antioxidants

1250
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,200
phytochemicals from plants and Foods

1251
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,359
nutrients fats and more if you're eating

1252
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,599
fruit lots of

1253
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,000
antioxidants but people aren't eating a

1254
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,119
lot of antioxidants they're not they're

1255
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,319
just not so they're not getting a lot of

1256
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:54,880
good minerals and vitamins and

1257
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:57,240
antioxidants up into the liver so that's

1258
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,400
a whole problem all on its own

1259
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,319
so fat thickens the

1260
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:08,359
blood and that's the thing we have to be

1261
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:10,880
scared about it matters it really

1262
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:12,319
does so the central nervous system runs

1263
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,400
on sugar I'm going to tell you right now

1264
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:17,440
it runs on glucose the central nervous

1265
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,880
system drinks glucose the brain is the

1266
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:24,319
central nervous system it drinks n it

1267
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:27,240
drinks all of the new glucose produced

1268
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:30,280
delivered into the body and old storage

1269
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,000
of of of glucose in the liver the liver

1270
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,480
keeps the brain Alive by releasing

1271
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,119
glucose constantly at different times

1272
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,280
when someone isn't eating right to keep

1273
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:42,319
your brain from atrophying this is

1274
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,960
highly Advanced

1275
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,240
information the central central nervous

1276
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,880
system

1277
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:54,599
drinks drinks glucose every cell in a

1278
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,599
nerve every nerve cell needs glucose or

1279
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:00,440
it dies

1280
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,400
very important right there and when the

1281
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:06,119
blood fat is high it loses its

1282
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,839
opportunity slowly and painfully every

1283
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:10,559
single day of somebody's life when

1284
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,960
they're eating all that high

1285
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,359
fat that's the kind of deal we're

1286
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:20,119
talking about so it's really

1287
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:23,520
important as long as it's seemingly a

1288
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:26,480
seemingly new trendy everyday diet

1289
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,680
consists of higher levels the fats which

1290
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,119
is under the GU of protein the hidden gu

1291
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:35,440
of protein as the main calorie Source it

1292
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,319
will burden the liver probably and

1293
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,480
almost possibly resulting in an

1294
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:40,800
undiagnosed pre fatty liver or fatty

1295
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,760
liver

1296
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,480
condition regardless of whether

1297
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,640
someone's exercising and doesn't have a

1298
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,359
scrap on their body a fat doesn't have a

1299
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,760
scrap on the outside of their body you

1300
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:52,240
know of of

1301
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,640
fat you still can have that pre fatty

1302
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,079
and fatty liver and it'll catch up to

1303
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,480
you later on no matter what and give you

1304
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:58,359
a heart attack that's the whole thing

1305
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,319
too cuz it can and it will it give you a

1306
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:01,119
stroke I talk about this in a lot of

1307
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,520
radio

1308
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,640
shows lots of people athletes just

1309
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,319
Strokes why are they getting strokes The

1310
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,200
Blood fat is so thick that's

1311
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:16,160
why and it's it's amazing how it works

1312
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:19,280
the liver blood vessels constricted with

1313
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:24,599
fat burdened overburdened

1314
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,800
so our livers can sense what we eat I

1315
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,839
got to tell you something pretty

1316
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,040
interesting your stomach is stupid our

1317
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,559
stomachs are stupid that's the stupidest

1318
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,720
organ in the body science of research

1319
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,240
doesn't know this yet it's the dumbest

1320
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,559
organ in the body it has to be if it

1321
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,440
wasn't we'd be in

1322
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:45,119
trouble if it was smart if your stomach

1323
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,839
was smart we'd be in trouble because we

1324
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,839
don't have a lot of resources this the

1325
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,599
body

1326
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:53,319
knows the body knows we're created in a

1327
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,799
way because we might be eating different

1328
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:56,440
things that we're not supposed to eat to

1329
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:58,720
survive we might be having that

1330
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,359
barbecued chicken we might be having

1331
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,400
whatever it is we might be having

1332
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:04,960
something at the wrong time we might be

1333
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,960
having some kind of greasy oily meal we

1334
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,880
might be having something we might be

1335
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,319
having a bunch of eggs that aren't good

1336
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,799
for us but we're surviving and it's what

1337
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,920
we need to eat because we have no other

1338
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:18,440
options or we're living on a different

1339
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,680
part of the planet we have no money no

1340
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,319
resources or we're living here in the US

1341
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,760
no money no resources we're just eating

1342
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:27,599
to survive and we're eating all kinds of

1343
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:31,720
different things the stomach has to stay

1344
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:35,119
Stupid it has to and the liver stays

1345
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,920
smart that's how it works and there's a

1346
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,319
reason for that there's lots of reasons

1347
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:42,720
for that the stomach is just a pouch

1348
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:46,000
that gets its marching orders from your

1349
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,880
brain that's the whole point it's an

1350
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,520
important tool it's an amazing tool the

1351
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:55,000
stomach is am it's an amazing organ it's

1352
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,839
unbelievable but it should not sense

1353
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,880
what we eat eat and give us too many

1354
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,839
fore warnings cuz if it does it cheats

1355
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,680
us out of surviving on planet Earth we

1356
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:08,559
don't have a lot of options many of

1357
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:11,799
us but the liver is so smart it knows

1358
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:14,079
what you ate 10 days ago and It prepares

1359
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:17,480
itself in case you eat it again how

1360
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,920
about them apples how about them apples

1361
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,520
your liver is so smart and science

1362
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,319
research has no clue to this this is not

1363
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,599
information they have on any level it's

1364
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:28,920
so smart it knows if you eat Friday

1365
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:31,319
night pizza and it gets ready to produce

1366
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,799
the bile needed to try to break down all

1367
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:38,960
that cheese fat and oil on Friday

1368
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:40,640
nights even so when you skip that pizza

1369
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,040
on Friday night and decide to eat a

1370
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,920
healthy salad it pumps out all this bile

1371
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,559
cuz it's used to you actually eating

1372
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,040
pizza on that Friday night every Friday

1373
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,440
night and you'll it just bile will come

1374
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,799
out it's another confusing reason why

1375
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,799
people say well I just can't eat all

1376
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,079
these vegetables or can't even because

1377
00:50:54,799 --> 00:50:59,160
they're they're they're their their

1378
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,920
liver was trained being smart trying to

1379
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,680
think ahead of you to actually put out

1380
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,400
bile to help you and break down and

1381
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,839
disperse those fats to save your life

1382
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,119
and your pancreas is

1383
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:13,040
life and to try to thin out the blood

1384
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,799
the best it's in capacity best its

1385
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,799
capacity can to make sure you don't

1386
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:19,400
stroke out someday because the liver

1387
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:22,480
thinks it's smart a stomach stupid the

1388
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:26,119
liver is really really really

1389
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,359
smart if you eat a cheeseburger big old

1390
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,200
juicy greasy cheeseburger or a healthy

1391
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:31,720
cheeseburger once a year on your

1392
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,520
birthday your liver will actually

1393
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,119
documented recorded have it in its

1394
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:39,000
information base and in it cells and not

1395
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:42,680
forget it and actually prepare

1396
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
itself on that 365

1397
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:48,040
day of the

1398
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,480
year that's the power of the liver but

1399
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:53,720
we don't treat it good we treat it like

1400
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,559
crap we do and it's not our fault at all

1401
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:59,839
it's not it's not our fault and it's not

1402
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,200
the trendy doctors that you know don't

1403
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:04,680
know what the hell to feed anybody

1404
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,640
really in the end it's not it's not it's

1405
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,799
not anybody's fault it's not their fault

1406
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:13,359
it's not anybody's

1407
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:16,119
fault but knowing the truth is how you

1408
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:19,240
can actually turn everything around but

1409
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:21,839
if you avoid the truth then it's your

1410
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:24,559
fault then it's your fault then it's our

1411
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,400
fault if you avoid the truth if you

1412
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,680
avoid the information

1413
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,280
to do something about it and it could

1414
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,440
become your

1415
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,680
fault and maybe it's not your fault in

1416
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,200
the end anyway cuz there's so much

1417
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,119
misinformation out there derailing

1418
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,400
everybody so you know what yeah I'm

1419
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,920
wrong about that and I apologize

1420
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,280
terribly wrong actually terribly wrong

1421
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,799
because it's so hard out there and the

1422
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,640
misinformation is so thick you can't

1423
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:52,240
even cut through it with a

1424
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,960
knife so yeah the bottom line is your

1425
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,960
liver we got to take care of it we got

1426
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,480
to avoid fatty liver I don't even know

1427
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,040
who's going to listen to the show I know

1428
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,880
lots of people listen thousands listen

1429
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,880
to the show I get it but I don't even

1430
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,119
know if people are interested in fatty

1431
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,640
liver when I was going to do this show I

1432
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:08,520
was like who's who's interested they

1433
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,280
probably think they're going to get a

1434
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,960
fatty liver when they're 50 60 years old

1435
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,319
who's going to listen to this

1436
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,400
show but it's one of the most important

1437
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,960
shows that's the irony that's the irony

1438
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,319
of Health that's the irony of what's

1439
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,559
going on in our health and what's going

1440
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:22,920
on in our

1441
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,160
lives and so we got to think about all

1442
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,680
these

1443
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,760
things so the bottom line is the

1444
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,000
pancreas needs to be protected by the

1445
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,559
liver so we always got to think about

1446
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,559
that because the liver protects it

1447
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,760
protects you from

1448
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:40,920
diabetes by trying to keep the glucose

1449
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,359
strong and denouncing the fats so let's

1450
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,720
think about all this you guys I really

1451
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:47,040
love you and I really appreciate this

1452
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,520
this has been you know I've been a

1453
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,400
little bit more Punky I guess and a

1454
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,000
little bit more

1455
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,760
Sparky probably you know a little bit

1456
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,839
more of a pain in the butt when it comes

1457
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,559
down to all these things it's just that

1458
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,240
I'm up against a lot of the trends out

1459
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:03,160
there that are trying to always get in

1460
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,680
the way and keep people sick and it just

1461
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,079
gets you it gets you in the heart it

1462
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,400
gets you in the gut a little bit because

1463
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,960
when you see people suffer when they

1464
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,119
don't have to

1465
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,760
suffer because of something out there

1466
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,760
that's happening it hurts anyway drink

1467
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,440
