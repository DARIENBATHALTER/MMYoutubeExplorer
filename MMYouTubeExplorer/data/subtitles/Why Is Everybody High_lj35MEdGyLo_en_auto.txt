[939.12 - 941.76] going to give you a quick rundown on
[940.08 - 943.60] celery juice real quick a couple of
[941.76 - 945.36] tidbits that are really important don't
[943.60 - 946.64] add anything to it you guys know the
[945.36 - 948.56] drill right
[946.64 - 950.64] minimum of 16 ounces unless you're
[948.56 - 953.60] hypersensitive for some reason it with
[950.64 - 955.68] every maybe you're really toxic really
[953.60 - 957.68] toxic your liver your body is really
[955.68 - 958.48] toxic you're loaded with a ton of toxins
[957.68 - 960.64] right
[958.48 - 963.04] and then you start with a little bit you
[960.64 - 965.68] can do four ounces six ounces eight
[963.04 - 968.00] ounces right so you don't have to do 16
[965.68 - 970.56] ounces you can start slow and build
[968.00 - 972.96] yourself up and build yourself up get up

[972.96 - 977.12] to change your life turn your life
[975.12 - 979.60] around right
[977.12 - 980.72] what i love about celery juice
[979.60 - 984.80] okay
[980.72 - 986.80] it gives so much back to us it's an herb
[984.80 - 989.44] this is an actual herb it's not a
[986.80 - 990.96] vegetable we have to remember that
[989.44 - 993.44] because you'll see that out there you'll
[990.96 - 996.08] see that oh that celery juice trend yeah
[993.44 - 998.40] ray okay that trend is over no it's not
[996.08 - 1000.32] they hide it
[998.40 - 1001.44] people around they can't keep celery in
[1000.32 - 1004.48] stores
[1001.44 - 1006.32] they have celery shipments to whole
[1004.48 - 1008.08] foods in all the health food stores
[1006.32 - 1009.60] there's so much celery going there
[1008.08 - 1011.52] they've never seen anything like it
[1009.60 - 1012.88] before in our history
[1011.52 - 1014.56] because millions and hundreds of
[1012.88 - 1017.52] millions of people are drinking them but
[1014.56 - 1019.20] there's closet drinkers and the media
[1017.52 - 1020.96] doesn't want to talk about celery juice
[1019.20 - 1023.28] anymore talked about it for five seconds
[1020.96 - 1024.48] it doesn't want to talk about it anymore
[1023.28 - 1026.24] because you don't want to talk about
[1024.48 - 1028.40] something that brings somebody's health
[1026.24 - 1030.56] back and their life back right you know
[1028.40 - 1032.88] how corrupt everything is right where
[1030.56 - 1034.80] they want to pretend you know
[1032.88 - 1036.40] that things don't exist that get
[1034.80 - 1038.40] people's lives back their health back
[1036.40 - 1040.64] the system set up to make you sick so
[1038.40 - 1042.96] remember that the system is built to
[1040.64 - 1044.56] actually purposely make you sick
[1042.96 - 1046.00] that's the plan
[1044.56 - 1047.84] of the system
[1046.00 - 1050.84] that's how they make everything go
[1047.84 - 1054.08] around right that's how you do it
[1050.84 - 1056.32] and celery juice is like this secret
[1054.08 - 1058.00] weapon not secret weapon but they want
[1056.32 - 1059.92] to keep it secret they don't want
[1058.00 - 1061.60] anybody to know what it does and what
[1059.92 - 1063.28] it's doing for people
[1061.60 - 1065.12] but it's literally getting people's
[1063.28 - 1067.28] lives back when nothing else could but
[1065.12 - 1069.20] when that happens is you break the
[1067.28 - 1071.44] system now
[1069.20 - 1073.12] you end up breaking the system less
[1071.44 - 1075.76] drugs
[1073.12 - 1078.48] less drugs are being sold right less
[1075.76 - 1081.28] drugs are being prescribed
[1078.48 - 1083.84] you name it you know and the system just
[1081.28 - 1087.60] starts to start losing money
[1083.84 - 1090.08] and celery has the power to create that
[1087.60 - 1091.52] to bring balance back right instead of
[1090.08 - 1093.12] everybody just getting sicker out there
[1091.52 - 1094.96] sicker out there sicker out there just
[1093.12 - 1096.72] then then the medical system making
[1094.96 - 1098.00] trillions more trillions more people
[1096.72 - 1100.56] getting sicker because that's where it's
[1098.00 - 1102.16] happening right well celery juice
[1100.56 - 1103.12] is that one
[1102.16 - 1105.52] thing
[1103.12 - 1108.16] it's at least one of those things simple
[1105.52 - 1113.68] things you can do with your own free
[1108.16 - 1116.48] will to change that to change that right
[1113.68 - 1119.92] um super yoga says love my celery juice
[1116.48 - 1120.84] helps clear your mind makes it sharper
[1119.92 - 1122.96] does it
[1120.84 - 1124.40] ever so
[1122.96 - 1126.16] tell you guys a little something so in
[1124.40 - 1128.16] my office people would come walking
[1126.16 - 1129.28] through the door what can i do what can
[1128.16 - 1132.64] i do
[1129.28 - 1134.48] how do i get off of all these addictions
[1132.64 - 1136.72] get the celery juice going
[1134.48 - 1140.00] and then boom their life would start to
[1136.72 - 1141.92] change i know people 30 years ago 35
[1140.00 - 1143.60] years ago they never quit drinking it
[1141.92 - 1145.44] they still drink it
[1143.60 - 1147.76] they still drink it
[1145.44 - 1149.84] because they know it's what did it for
[1147.76 - 1152.00] them they know it's one of those things
[1149.84 - 1153.44] that did what it needed needed to do you
[1152.00 - 1155.28] know show brown says how much the cost
[1153.44 - 1157.68] of the juicer go to megajuicers.com
[1155.28 - 1160.08] you'll see it's 50 off on this model
[1157.68 - 1161.12] it's an mm-900 hds
[1160.08 - 1163.04] and
[1161.12 - 1165.52] you won't be disappointed the pulps dry
[1163.04 - 1168.48] for a reason that's the way the juicer
[1165.52 - 1171.28] is designed so you save money i used to
[1168.48 - 1173.60] buy so much more celery to make
[1171.28 - 1176.32] the juice right and then now i have to
[1173.60 - 1178.08] buy less celery to make the juice
[1176.32 - 1180.16] because it saves you money and then that
[1178.08 - 1181.12] adds up and then each month you're like
[1180.16 - 1183.44] whoa
[1181.12 - 1184.48] i just made 50 bucks i just made 100
[1183.44 - 1186.32] bucks
[1184.48 - 1188.80] each month it's like whoa just another
[1186.32 - 1190.56] 100 another 200 you know because next
[1188.80 - 1192.32] thing you know juicer paid for itself
[1190.56 - 1194.56] juicer paid for itself over and over
[1192.32 - 1196.08] again it's really cool it's really cool
[1194.56 - 1199.84] they give you a free celery juice book
[1196.08 - 1201.84] the medical medium celery juice book
[1199.84 - 1204.00] right
[1201.84 - 1204.00] so
[1204.08 - 1207.68] when you talk to family and friends and
[1206.24 - 1208.64] people you know
[1207.68 - 1211.28] all right
[1208.64 - 1213.20] when you talk to them you'll find out
[1211.28 - 1215.04] what vices you either see there ask them
[1213.20 - 1216.24] like what what are you doing and if
[1215.04 - 1217.60] they're honest they'll tell you what
[1216.24 - 1219.92] they're doing and you'll find two or
[1217.60 - 1222.32] three vices four vices by the way food
[1219.92 - 1224.32] prices are going up in the world
[1222.32 - 1225.76] and that's why i like saving money with
[1224.32 - 1228.16] something that's you know saving me
[1225.76 - 1229.68] money so food prices all food prices are
[1228.16 - 1232.00] going up
[1229.68 - 1234.16] that's what's happening right
[1232.00 - 1236.64] so food prices are going up and the next
[1234.16 - 1238.80] year they're going to go up more
[1236.64 - 1241.68] so what i like about this juicer is it's
[1238.80 - 1244.32] saving me money and so that helps battle
[1241.68 - 1246.80] that whole food price going up thing
[1244.32 - 1248.88] so that's what's cool about it
[1246.80 - 1250.64] when people are on two vices or three
[1248.88 - 1254.48] vices which is two addictions three
[1250.64 - 1256.88] addictions four addictions right
[1254.48 - 1258.48] and once you become
[1256.88 - 1260.72] knowledgeable
[1258.48 - 1263.52] really knowledgeable
[1260.72 - 1264.88] about addictions you can pick them off
[1263.52 - 1266.40] you can pick them off what you're
[1264.88 - 1267.84] knowledgeable about because a lot of
[1266.40 - 1269.44] people they're not knowledgeable they
[1267.84 - 1270.96] don't know
[1269.44 - 1272.24] that too much fat in the diet's an
[1270.96 - 1274.56] actual addiction because here's how it
[1272.24 - 1274.56] works
[1274.96 - 1279.52] the more fat you eat
[1276.96 - 1282.00] the more adrenaline gets released
[1279.52 - 1283.84] adrenaline's your blood thinner for fat
[1282.00 - 1285.52] you're consuming
[1283.84 - 1287.12] you think you're smart
[1285.52 - 1288.40] you're eating a lot of nut butters
[1287.12 - 1289.84] instead
[1288.40 - 1292.00] maybe you're plant-based you're eating
[1289.84 - 1293.68] lots of avocado oils and nut butters and
[1292.00 - 1295.84] you think you beat the the processed
[1293.68 - 1297.84] food greasy fried food
[1295.84 - 1298.72] animal protein world you think you beat
[1297.84 - 1300.48] it
[1298.72 - 1302.48] but you didn't
[1300.48 - 1304.40] you didn't
[1302.48 - 1305.92] because if you keep on pounding the fat
[1304.40 - 1307.84] doesn't matter what it is it could be
[1305.92 - 1309.44] the healthy fats
[1307.84 - 1311.36] i'm not saying you don't have to eat
[1309.44 - 1313.20] like never to eat them no
[1311.36 - 1315.84] you think you beat the system but you
[1313.20 - 1319.36] didn't beat it you didn't beat the fat
[1315.84 - 1321.76] i never ever make fun of someone who's
[1319.36 - 1323.28] sitting at a wendy's party in a parking
[1321.76 - 1326.00] lot in the drive-thru as i'm driving
[1323.28 - 1327.84] down or sitting at a burger king
[1326.00 - 1328.88] drive-through the whole every time i'm
[1327.84 - 1330.72] driving
[1328.88 - 1333.04] like every time i'm driving i'll drive
[1330.72 - 1335.04] past the burger king i'll drive past the
[1333.04 - 1337.60] mcdonald's you'll see the cars lined
[1335.04 - 1339.44] right up right right what's that person
[1337.60 - 1340.88] getting the person getting the big mac
[1339.44 - 1342.80] what's that person getting i'm driving
[1340.88 - 1344.72] like you know an unmasked spirit of
[1342.80 - 1346.24] compassion like what is that person in
[1344.72 - 1348.24] the window ordering right now just come
[1346.24 - 1350.24] on tell me tell me for fun because we're
[1348.24 - 1351.52] always doing the not so fun stuff
[1350.24 - 1353.52] because tell me tell me what are they
[1351.52 - 1354.88] ordering uh double cheeseburger what
[1353.52 - 1356.88] else what are they ordering happy meal
[1354.88 - 1358.00] what else are they ordering right
[1356.88 - 1360.40] and so
[1358.00 - 1362.72] right but you see the lines with all the
[1360.40 - 1365.04] fast food restaurants right
[1362.72 - 1366.64] and krispy kreme donuts there's a line
[1365.04 - 1369.76] around there

[1369.76 - 1374.96] can i never say anything bad
[1373.52 - 1377.28] not in my head
[1374.96 - 1379.28] nor out of my mouth
[1377.28 - 1381.20] because there's an addiction they're
[1379.28 - 1383.04] addicted
[1381.20 - 1385.04] they're addicted
[1383.04 - 1387.28] and when i'm driving by the health the
[1385.04 - 1389.12] health food restaurants and everybody's
[1387.28 - 1390.64] out there eating you think i'm like you

[1449.36 - 1453.68] and you're doing it wrong
[1451.76 - 1454.56] you're just as addicted as everybody
[1453.68 - 1456.00] else
[1454.56 - 1458.40] even though you're being burritos got
[1456.00 - 1460.72] avocado on it and canola oil on it and
[1458.40 - 1462.56] olive oil in it and all this other stuff

[1475.60 - 1479.68] and your adrenals are just pumping
[1477.28 - 1482.08] pumping pumping trying to thin out that
[1479.68 - 1484.16] food trying to thin it out with
[1482.08 - 1486.40] everything they got
[1484.16 - 1488.64] and you know what that high is when that
[1486.40 - 1492.16] fat hits
[1488.64 - 1495.36] that high is adrenaline when that fat
[1492.16 - 1498.00] hits it's adrenaline
[1495.36 - 1499.68] ah feels good goes down
[1498.00 - 1502.08] cylinder just completely stopped me from

[1563.44 - 1565.76] right
[1566.00 - 1569.84] so
[1567.84 - 1571.12] the bottom line is
[1569.84 - 1573.28] overall
[1571.12 - 1574.72] we walk around
[1573.28 - 1576.48] sick
[1574.72 - 1578.56] sad and depressed
[1576.48 - 1580.88] mental illnesses you guys are going
[1578.56 - 1583.44] through the roof
[1580.88 - 1584.80] people are struggling
[1583.44 - 1587.60] mentally
[1584.80 - 1589.20] emotionally like no other now
[1587.60 - 1590.80] right
[1589.20 - 1593.28] their brains
[1590.80 - 1595.12] are bathing in acid
[1593.28 - 1597.44] acid
[1595.12 - 1599.84] bathing in fat
[1597.44 - 1601.68] their brains are bathing in poisons and
[1599.84 - 1604.96] toxins
[1601.68 - 1604.96] toxic heavy metals
[1605.04 - 1607.84] that's what the world should be talking
[1606.88 - 1611.60] about
[1607.84 - 1613.84] is the metals in everybody's brain right
[1611.60 - 1616.32] but the world is this
[1613.84 - 1616.32] is this
[1617.28 - 1622.64] place
[1618.80 - 1624.56] where purposeful evil happens right it's
[1622.64 - 1626.48] on purpose you think it's not you think
[1624.56 - 1628.56] it's just stupid people making mistakes
[1626.48 - 1630.48] meaning like industries and stuff you
[1628.56 - 1631.60] think they're just making mistakes
[1630.48 - 1633.20] no
[1631.60 - 1635.52] it's on purpose
[1633.20 - 1638.08] it's what makes it all go around you
[1635.52 - 1641.28] have to be sick
[1638.08 - 1642.88] and they want you more than sick
[1641.28 - 1645.36] they want you sick
[1642.88 - 1647.44] and they want you gone
[1645.36 - 1648.56] they want both
[1647.44 - 1651.44] that's
[1648.56 - 1652.64] what the darkness on this planet wants
[1651.44 - 1655.84] and
[1652.64 - 1657.36] if we don't get wise to some of it and
[1655.84 - 1659.52] understand it
[1657.36 - 1660.72] then how do you protect yourself
[1659.52 - 1662.24] bottom line
[1660.72 - 1664.32] how do you protect yourself talk about
[1662.24 - 1665.68] the human body for a little bit by the
[1664.32 - 1668.48] way if you guys just got on here it's
[1665.68 - 1671.36] the mm-900 hds

[1680.56 - 1684.40] want us to be sick
[1682.64 - 1685.68] everybody asks me over and over again
[1684.40 - 1687.52] what you sir what you said because
[1685.68 - 1689.92] remember the celery juice movement right
[1687.52 - 1691.76] and celery juice so i'm asked that a
[1689.92 - 1693.20] billion times a day i mean obviously
[1691.76 - 1694.84] that's an exaggeration but it's
[1693.20 - 1697.04] definitely a lot
[1694.84 - 1698.80] and um
[1697.04 - 1700.80] and then when there's a sale i got to
[1698.80 - 1703.12] tell everybody because i feel like if i
[1700.80 - 1705.20] don't then someone just lost a chance to
[1703.12 - 1707.20] save 50 on the juicer
[1705.20 - 1709.52] they lost a chance of getting like an
[1707.20 - 1713.28] incredible book because it's free with
[1709.52 - 1715.92] the juicer cmm 900 hds this is a celery
[1713.28 - 1719.16] juicer model so it's the celery juice
[1715.92 - 1721.36] juicer model mm-900 hds from
[1719.16 - 1724.16] omegajuicers.com right
[1721.36 - 1725.76] and this isn't metal on metal just so
[1724.16 - 1727.68] you know you might be like oh i got a
[1725.76 - 1730.64] really good juicer hey and
[1727.68 - 1732.80] use it use it but remember this okay
[1730.64 - 1733.84] remember this right
[1732.80 - 1735.36] all right
[1733.84 - 1739.04] okay
[1735.36 - 1740.56] there isn't two metal gears in here
[1739.04 - 1742.48] grinding against each other this is a
[1740.56 - 1745.04] cold pressed juicer without the two
[1742.48 - 1748.08] metal gears grinding against each other
[1745.04 - 1750.48] okay keep that in mind right this isn't
[1748.08 - 1753.60] the centrifuge with all that metal
[1750.48 - 1755.12] flinging around too okay
[1753.60 - 1756.08] keep that in mind
[1755.12 - 1757.92] so
[1756.08 - 1759.60] i get it there's a lot of juicer
[1757.92 - 1761.84] companies out there and they're like our
[1759.60 - 1763.84] cold pressed juicer it's historically
[1761.84 - 1765.20] great people love it blah blah blah okay
[1763.84 - 1766.80] good glad you love getting all that
[1765.20 - 1768.40] metal in you
[1766.80 - 1770.80] because you got the metal gears rubbing
[1768.40 - 1772.96] against each other this one doesn't
[1770.80 - 1774.56] important to know easy to clean pull
[1772.96 - 1776.00] this off boom put it in the sink you
[1774.56 - 1778.84] clean it in a minute a couple of minutes
[1776.00 - 1781.68] and then you're good right
[1778.84 - 1784.56] so um anyway it comes with two free
[1781.68 - 1787.36] glass bottles too not just the book
[1784.56 - 1788.80] and the food price is going up the food
[1787.36 - 1791.76] price is going up
[1788.80 - 1794.32] this is gonna save people money okay
[1791.76 - 1796.96] so talk about what the addictions do and
[1794.32 - 1800.32] how it works your brain
[1796.96 - 1802.24] starts to get used to the high
[1800.32 - 1803.04] the addictive high
[1802.24 - 1806.08] it's
[1803.04 - 1808.56] one joint doesn't do it anymore
[1806.08 - 1810.64] one joint won't do it anymore right
[1808.56 - 1812.88] a little bit of ayahuasca won't do it
[1810.64 - 1815.12] anymore a tiny bit of shrooms won't do
[1812.88 - 1818.16] it anymore you need more
[1815.12 - 1821.04] you don't get the same experience
[1818.16 - 1822.88] a little bit of cbd cbd oil and i'm not
[1821.04 - 1824.96] ranking on cbd oil if you're somebody
[1822.88 - 1826.80] uses it and you're somebody that uses
[1824.96 - 1827.92] pot or somebody that uses i know they're
[1826.80 - 1829.68] two different things unless you've got
[1827.92 - 1830.80] thc in the cbd oil but what i'm trying
[1829.68 - 1832.80] to tell you is
[1830.80 - 1834.96] if you're somebody on any of this stuff
[1832.80 - 1837.12] alcohol if you're somebody eating fast
[1834.96 - 1839.20] food every day i'm not
[1837.12 - 1841.12] shaming you
[1839.20 - 1842.64] i'm on your side
[1841.12 - 1844.80] i'm on your side
[1842.64 - 1846.08] okay 100
[1844.80 - 1848.08] i don't know what it's like to be in
[1846.08 - 1850.32] your shoes possibly right
[1848.08 - 1852.56] whatever's happened in your life isn't
[1850.32 - 1853.68] what happened in my life
[1852.56 - 1855.36] look
[1853.68 - 1856.64] you know look at people chronic illness
[1855.36 - 1858.32] nobody knows what it's like to be in
[1856.64 - 1860.48] their shoe
[1858.32 - 1862.64] uh-uh nobody knows what it's like to
[1860.48 - 1863.52] feel what their shoe size is like
[1862.64 - 1865.04] okay
[1863.52 - 1866.48] so with somebody with chronic illness
[1865.04 - 1868.80] and and everything they've gone through
[1866.48 - 1870.88] with chronic illness all right
[1868.80 - 1874.08] so and i get that
[1870.88 - 1876.00] what i'm saying is the high isn't enough
[1874.08 - 1877.44] that's why people who drink alcohol end
[1876.00 - 1878.80] up drinking a little bit more alcohol
[1877.44 - 1880.32] and a little bit more at some time in
[1878.80 - 1881.92] the life of it a little bit more and
[1880.32 - 1883.28] people who start out smoking pot end up
[1881.92 - 1885.36] smoking a little bit more and a little
[1883.28 - 1887.20] bit more people who do fast food end up
[1885.36 - 1889.28] that's not enough i want to order this
[1887.20 - 1890.64] now and this down this now now i want to
[1889.28 - 1892.80] go to this restaurant and try that
[1890.64 - 1894.56] gastro abomination now i want to go to
[1892.80 - 1896.80] this restaurant and try that you know
[1894.56 - 1898.80] abomination right because there's
[1896.80 - 1901.68] there's a high what about the foodie
[1898.80 - 1904.56] highs oh i'm a foodie
[1901.68 - 1904.56] i'm a foodie
[1904.64 - 1909.68] you know i travel around the restaurants
[1907.92 - 1912.16] and i'm a foodie you know i like to try
[1909.68 - 1913.92] this restaurant that restaurant because
[1912.16 - 1914.96] there's this high and you can't get
[1913.92 - 1917.76] enough
[1914.96 - 1919.20] right everything because the brain
[1917.76 - 1922.48] ends up
[1919.20 - 1925.68] maxim it ends up maxing out where you
[1922.48 - 1927.44] have to trump it you have to ride over
[1925.68 - 1929.76] that
[1927.44 - 1931.84] you have to ride over that
[1929.76 - 1933.60] then it's not enough
[1931.84 - 1935.44] a little piece of chocolate once a
[1933.60 - 1937.52] week's not enough you need more
[1935.44 - 1939.36] chocolate now and then more chocolate
[1937.52 - 1941.36] and you need a quarter of a bar then you
[1939.36 - 1943.20] need a quarter of a bar every single day
[1941.36 - 1945.44] until something inside of you says oh
[1943.20 - 1946.84] [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i better stop eating two
[1945.44 - 1949.92] chocolate bars a
[1946.84 - 1952.48] day i better stop i better stop you know
[1949.92 - 1953.68] eating two chocolate bars a day
[1952.48 - 1954.96] right
[1953.68 - 1957.44] because
[1954.96 - 1958.56] something inside here in the brain
[1957.44 - 1960.00] here's how the brain works
[1958.56 - 1961.36] neurotransmitter chemicals
[1960.00 - 1964.00] neurotransmitters neurons and everything
[1961.36 - 1965.04] else glial cells the brain works where
[1964.00 - 1967.68] you
[1965.04 - 1969.12] you have to keep on upping
[1967.68 - 1972.96] the ante
[1969.12 - 1975.36] to get a feeling like you used to feel
[1972.96 - 1976.88] you have to keep on upping it
[1975.36 - 1979.28] right it's people there's people that
[1976.88 - 1982.64] are addicted to fighting
[1979.28 - 1984.56] right they're addicted to fighting and
[1982.64 - 1986.56] they start yelling and have an argument
[1984.56 - 1988.24] that ain't enough
[1986.56 - 1990.56] the next week they start yelling and
[1988.24 - 1991.92] having a bigger argument the next week
[1990.56 - 1994.40] they start yelling and having now
[1991.92 - 1996.88] they're slamming the doors running out
[1994.40 - 1998.48] of the house running out of the office
[1996.88 - 2000.80] now they're they're they're now they're
[1998.48 - 2003.28] having a bigger coral right
[2000.80 - 2006.24] it becomes addictive where adrenaline
[2003.28 - 2008.16] surge occurs
[2006.24 - 2009.60] and then the depression that hits
[2008.16 - 2012.08] afterwards
[2009.60 - 2013.76] after those fights
[2012.08 - 2015.60] it's all part of the addiction can get
[2013.76 - 2018.40] you trapped in there
[2015.60 - 2020.08] okay same thing when you're bulimic and
[2018.40 - 2022.08] you're anorexic bulimic and you're
[2020.08 - 2024.40] throwing up your food
[2022.08 - 2026.32] it becomes addictive the the there's an
[2024.40 - 2028.16] addiction quality to it
[2026.32 - 2029.60] if someone had emotional abuse and it
[2028.16 - 2031.68] made them bulimic because they had
[2029.60 - 2034.48] severe emotional abuse right happened to
[2031.68 - 2036.08] them and they became bulimic right
[2034.48 - 2037.04] and they're throwing up everything they
[2036.08 - 2041.04] eat
[2037.04 - 2041.04] they start out just throwing up once
[2041.60 - 2044.40] okay
[2042.56 - 2046.48] and then they've got a high off of it
[2044.40 - 2048.40] because when you throw up
[2046.48 - 2051.04] force yourself to throw up
[2048.40 - 2054.00] your adrenals explode
[2051.04 - 2054.00] they explode
[2054.64 - 2059.68] and then whoa my high is coming down my
[2057.20 - 2060.88] high's coming down throw up again boom
[2059.68 - 2063.04] throw up again
[2060.88 - 2066.08] they're self-medicating
[2063.04 - 2068.80] somebody with bulimia self-medicating
[2066.08 - 2070.00] and their adrenals explode again
[2068.80 - 2071.52] i'm gonna go to this fast food
[2070.00 - 2073.12] restaurant and eat this big gastric
[2071.52 - 2075.84] abomination your adrenals start to
[2073.12 - 2075.84] explode
[2076.00 - 2080.80] i'm going to get i'm going to get on my
[2077.68 - 2082.64] my uh my amphetamine
[2080.80 - 2085.12] from my black market amphetamine or my
[2082.64 - 2086.56] prescribed doctor's amphetamine you guys
[2085.12 - 2088.88] give me a thumbs up if you get a chance
[2086.56 - 2090.88] to before i forget if you don't like the
[2088.88 - 2092.40] video give me a thumbs up anyway i don't
[2090.88 - 2094.32] know
[2092.40 - 2095.04] if you like the video give me a thumbs
[2094.32 - 2096.48] up
[2095.04 - 2097.20] okay
[2096.48 - 2098.88] so
[2097.20 - 2100.56] that's what happens right so back to the
[2098.88 - 2101.68] bulimia
[2100.56 - 2104.32] so
[2101.68 - 2105.52] one throw up's not enough
[2104.32 - 2107.36] the brain
[2105.52 - 2110.16] plateaus
[2107.36 - 2112.88] now it's throwing up once a day instead
[2110.16 - 2115.44] of once a week
[2112.88 - 2118.32] but that adrenaline high
[2115.44 - 2121.12] now you're throwing up every day
[2118.32 - 2123.52] now you're addicted
[2121.12 - 2125.20] same thing with an anorexia starving
[2123.52 - 2127.20] yourself
[2125.20 - 2128.72] the adrenals when you starve yourself
[2127.20 - 2130.64] everybody's that's on an intermittent
[2128.72 - 2132.32] fasting diet
[2130.64 - 2134.80] right
[2132.32 - 2136.88] is on a type of anorexic diet did you
[2134.80 - 2138.56] know that
[2136.88 - 2141.44] when you don't when you withhold from
[2138.56 - 2143.44] food all day purposely
[2141.44 - 2145.52] right
[2143.44 - 2148.80] when you do that all day your adrenals
[2145.52 - 2148.80] are exploding all day long
[2148.96 - 2154.32] when someone who's anorexic
[2151.76 - 2156.80] right that doesn't want to eat and it
[2154.32 - 2159.36] becomes such a problem their adrenals
[2156.80 - 2161.68] are exploding giving them high
[2159.36 - 2163.92] it fills in for missing blood sugar so
[2161.68 - 2166.00] i'm on an intermittent fasting diet not
[2163.92 - 2167.84] eating anything but coffee and caffeine
[2166.00 - 2170.48] and then i'll have a big fat meal at
[2167.84 - 2172.40] night um yeah i'm slimming down nice
[2170.48 - 2174.64] from it you're just living off of
[2172.40 - 2176.32] adrenaline and eventually
[2174.64 - 2178.00] that will run out you'll burn those
[2176.32 - 2179.28] adrenals out something will happen down
[2178.00 - 2181.44] the road right
[2179.28 - 2182.64] someone who's anorexic is withholding
[2181.44 - 2184.24] from food because they have some
[2182.64 - 2185.92] emotional abuse that happened to them
[2184.24 - 2187.60] something terrible happened to them or
[2185.92 - 2188.96] like i said toxic heavy metals in the
[2187.60 - 2190.80] brain there's a reason why they're
[2188.96 - 2192.64] anorexic and they don't want to eat but
[2190.80 - 2194.56] that they're living off of adrenaline
[2192.64 - 2196.64] from not eating and
[2194.56 - 2198.88] eventually
[2196.64 - 2201.68] it's not enough
[2198.88 - 2203.76] so you stop eating longer
[2201.68 - 2207.28] you stop eating longer
[2203.76 - 2208.64] you want more adrenaline high
[2207.28 - 2210.16] and the opposite can happen when you're
[2208.64 - 2211.04] eating all that fast food and that
[2210.16 - 2212.80] grease
[2211.04 - 2214.56] you want the adrenaline high so you eat
[2212.80 - 2217.12] more of it
[2214.56 - 2218.48] i'm gonna have pizza every night
[2217.12 - 2220.64] oh no i'll have something else this
[2218.48 - 2221.92] night
[2220.64 - 2224.40] addictions
[2221.92 - 2225.84] do this right where
[2224.40 - 2227.12] your brain
[2225.84 - 2229.52] maxes
[2227.12 - 2231.76] and then you have to override and
[2229.52 - 2234.88] override and try to get the same feeling
[2231.76 - 2236.56] again but go further and further
[2234.88 - 2238.16] right how many people i've talked to
[2236.56 - 2239.52] over the years you're going to start out
[2238.16 - 2241.44] smoking a little bit of pot on the
[2239.52 - 2242.96] weekends
[2241.44 - 2244.64] then they needed a lot of pot on the
[2242.96 - 2246.00] weekends
[2244.64 - 2248.40] and then they needed
[2246.00 - 2250.80] lots of marijuana all week long and then
[2248.40 - 2252.64] they smoked it three times a day
[2250.80 - 2254.56] and their wife was like get the hell out
[2252.64 - 2256.72] of here i'm divorcing you
[2254.56 - 2259.52] how many friends how many have i seen
[2256.72 - 2261.60] that to do that right i've seen i can't
[2259.52 - 2262.48] tell you can't count how many over the
[2261.60 - 2265.60] years
[2262.48 - 2267.92] and and because you you max out and you
[2265.60 - 2269.60] have to override
[2267.92 - 2271.84] same thing with chocolate
[2269.60 - 2273.76] a little square once a week
[2271.84 - 2275.44] you need three squares
[2273.76 - 2276.56] now you're gonna need ten squares or
[2275.44 - 2278.48] you're gonna need two chocolate bars
[2276.56 - 2281.28] then you're gonna eat in your smoothies
[2278.48 - 2282.16] same with medications amphetamines
[2281.28 - 2283.68] right
[2282.16 - 2285.44] a little bit ain't enough why do you
[2283.68 - 2287.12] think all the college students are
[2285.44 - 2288.64] looking in the black market in their
[2287.12 - 2291.44] prestigious schools they go around the
[2288.64 - 2293.20] corner and they buy it right there
[2291.44 - 2294.96] no one says anything
[2293.20 - 2296.00] it's possible it's practically passed
[2294.96 - 2297.44] out for free
[2296.00 - 2300.88] on campuses
[2297.44 - 2302.80] because the prescribed dose isn't enough
[2300.88 - 2304.48] for all the students
[2302.80 - 2305.68] so you need that prescribed dose from
[2304.48 - 2307.12] the doctor and then they need a whole
[2305.68 - 2309.04] bunch more because you you need to
[2307.12 - 2312.64] override to get the feeling you need
[2309.04 - 2315.52] again same with alcohol
[2312.64 - 2315.52] same with alcohol
[2317.84 - 2321.92] but you think they'd be passing out
[2319.44 - 2325.12] celery juice passing that around through
[2321.92 - 2326.80] all the prestigious universities no
[2325.12 - 2328.64] you think they'd be passing all the
[2326.80 - 2331.44] celery juice around in the medical
[2328.64 - 2334.00] universities no of course not
[2331.44 - 2336.08] passing around drugs you think you think
[2334.00 - 2337.28] they'd be passing on celery juice
[2336.08 - 2338.72] everywhere
[2337.28 - 2342.00] no
[2338.72 - 2344.24] because nobody wants to fix anything
[2342.00 - 2346.64] nobody wants to fix anything so it's up
[2344.24 - 2348.96] to us how we empower ourselves to take
[2346.64 - 2351.12] control over our lives you know
[2348.96 - 2352.80] and and it's up to us to do that for
[2351.12 - 2355.44] ourselves
[2352.80 - 2357.76] because the system is not going to teach
[2355.44 - 2359.36] it's just going to destroy
[2357.76 - 2362.80] that's what it does
[2359.36 - 2364.72] the celery juice is one powerful tool
[2362.80 - 2367.04] that's what it is
[2364.72 - 2369.84] it's one powerful tool to really move
[2367.04 - 2371.52] the needle it's what it's about
[2369.84 - 2373.44] it's about
[2371.52 - 2375.36] so
[2373.44 - 2377.92] check out the medical mean podcast at
[2375.36 - 2380.16] apple podcast and check out the coffee
[2377.92 - 2382.16] matcha tea chocolate episode if you guys
[2380.16 - 2384.32] get a chance i talked about blood draw
[2382.16 - 2386.00] the other day right
[2384.32 - 2387.28] check out the blood draw podcast you can
[2386.00 - 2389.52] protect yourself because they're gonna
[2387.28 - 2390.96] bleed everybody dry in the next one to
[2389.52 - 2393.52] five years
[2390.96 - 2395.28] they're gonna vampire blood out of you
[2393.52 - 2396.72] guys like you've never seen before with
[2395.28 - 2398.08] your aches and pains the doctor is going
[2396.72 - 2399.28] to be like no let's get more blood work
[2398.08 - 2400.80] you know let's get more blood work let's
[2399.28 - 2403.36] get 12 more vials let's get 10 more
[2400.80 - 2405.92] vials and all that blood
[2403.36 - 2407.60] is going to be carried away someplace
[2405.92 - 2409.44] carried away
[2407.60 - 2411.44] and then you know
[2409.44 - 2412.80] bottom line is
[2411.44 - 2414.08] they're going to drain everybody make
[2412.80 - 2416.08] them more deficient make them more
[2414.08 - 2417.92] deficient and people are ready to fish
[2416.08 - 2419.36] it they're going to lose their glucose
[2417.92 - 2420.48] the glucose deficiencies they're going
[2419.36 - 2422.84] to get
[2420.48 - 2426.80] and you know
[2422.84 - 2426.80] what news flash
[2427.12 - 2430.56] i love how they say your brain's made
[2428.64 - 2432.72] out of all fat it's not
[2430.56 - 2435.36] it's made out of storage stored like
[2432.72 - 2437.36] glycogen okay glucose
[2435.36 - 2439.20] stored glycogen
[2437.36 - 2441.20] without glucose your brain dies within
[2439.20 - 2442.96] five seconds
[2441.20 - 2444.40] five seconds
[2442.96 - 2447.36] ten seconds
[2444.40 - 2449.28] for sure five seconds it starts to die
[2447.36 - 2450.48] right your brain has traces of fats all
[2449.28 - 2452.64] through it
[2450.48 - 2454.72] but your brain's made mostly out of
[2452.64 - 2456.16] glycogen that's what the tissues made
[2454.72 - 2457.36] out of right
[2456.16 - 2459.76] so
[2457.36 - 2460.64] what's happening here now with everybody
[2459.76 - 2462.24] right
[2460.64 - 2464.88] is they're teaching people to be afraid
[2462.24 - 2466.64] of sugar afraid of sugar
[2464.88 - 2468.00] the critical clean carbohydrates i've
[2466.64 - 2470.00] talked about that's medical medium
[2468.00 - 2472.72] information the potatoes and the sweet
[2470.00 - 2475.52] potatoes and the fruits right
[2472.72 - 2476.48] and even peas and and
[2475.52 - 2478.80] steamed
[2476.48 - 2481.12] sweet potatoes and regular potatoes and
[2478.80 - 2484.48] purple potatoes really good for people
[2481.12 - 2484.48] for bringing the brain back
[2485.44 - 2490.16] what happens is that when they study the
[2487.68 - 2492.72] human brain they study the human brain
[2490.16 - 2495.04] with overweight cadavers they cut them
[2492.72 - 2497.76] open
[2495.04 - 2499.36] and their brain had fat in it like a
[2497.76 - 2501.60] chicken does
[2499.36 - 2501.60] okay
[2503.36 - 2506.96] when you have chicken you see all that
[2505.28 - 2509.28] fat in the chicken you guys ever see
[2506.96 - 2511.52] that when someone puts a big nice piece
[2509.28 - 2514.32] of chicken on your plate right and you
[2511.52 - 2516.00] see all that fat that yellow stringy fat
[2514.32 - 2517.44] all through the chicken
[2516.00 - 2519.20] right because they fatten the chickens
[2517.44 - 2520.80] up and they fatten them up so you guys
[2519.20 - 2523.52] have your chicken right
[2520.80 - 2525.20] well the same thing happens to our brain
[2523.52 - 2526.96] right
[2525.20 - 2529.12] we get a lot of fat in the brain it
[2526.96 - 2530.96] builds up it shouldn't be in there
[2529.12 - 2532.80] you get fat all around it the brain
[2530.96 - 2534.32] starts shrinking and then more fat
[2532.80 - 2536.56] starts to show up the brain starts
[2534.32 - 2537.92] shrinking right
[2536.56 - 2540.32] and
[2537.92 - 2542.32] and that's part of how we basically lose
[2540.32 - 2543.52] ourselves and get sick throughout the
[2542.32 - 2545.52] years
[2543.52 - 2548.40] so that's important to know too that's
[2545.52 - 2550.88] part of it we lose the gluck we lose the
[2548.40 - 2553.04] glucose the glycogen reserve our brain
[2550.88 - 2554.88] starts to shrink over time
[2553.04 - 2556.64] and
[2554.88 - 2557.36] that's important to know
[2556.64 - 2559.20] so
[2557.36 - 2560.96] on that note when i was talking about
[2559.20 - 2562.40] addictions in fact some of you and i'm
[2560.96 - 2563.84] going back to this for a reason because
[2562.40 - 2565.52] some of you pray like fats are good for
[2563.84 - 2566.48] you you need fats brains made out of
[2565.52 - 2568.80] fats
[2566.48 - 2568.80] right
[2568.88 - 2572.96] so the brain study they did for how much
[2571.28 - 2575.84] fats in your brain
[2572.96 - 2577.76] saw an overweight cadaver
[2575.84 - 2579.84] with additional fat that shouldn't have
[2577.76 - 2581.52] been surrounded around the brain
[2579.84 - 2583.20] just like you get fat around your liver
[2581.52 - 2584.56] and you get a fatty liver people get a
[2583.20 - 2586.08] fatty brain
[2584.56 - 2588.64] important to know
[2586.08 - 2590.80] and it had it in in it around it twisted
[2588.64 - 2593.36] in it too fat that's not supposed to be
[2590.80 - 2595.76] in there bad fat that's not supposed to
[2593.36 - 2597.92] be wrapped around your brain when you
[2595.76 - 2600.24] look at a cadaver
[2597.92 - 2602.80] that that's not overweight the
[2600.24 - 2604.88] percentage of fat in the brain is cut in
[2602.80 - 2607.76] half
[2604.88 - 2610.40] and then you look at a healthier cadaver
[2607.76 - 2612.00] the percentage is even lower
[2610.40 - 2613.84] and lower
[2612.00 - 2616.24] and that's how it works when they cut
[2613.84 - 2619.04] open a brain of somebody who's 90 years
[2616.24 - 2621.60] old and is still lean after all those
[2619.04 - 2623.28] years and didn't consume a really high
[2621.60 - 2625.44] fat diet and they cut open that
[2623.28 - 2626.80] cadaver's brain there's very little fat
[2625.44 - 2630.08] in the brain
[2626.80 - 2630.88] right they cut open a 50 year old
[2630.08 - 2633.44] that's
[2630.88 - 2634.88] pounds and pounds overweight
[2633.44 - 2636.88] where do you think all that fat goes
[2634.88 - 2639.52] it's just in the skin it's just under
[2636.88 - 2641.84] the skin is that where all the fat goes
[2639.52 - 2643.44] it's wrapped in and around the organs
[2641.84 - 2645.52] liver the spleen
[2643.44 - 2647.28] wrapped around the colon wrapped around
[2645.52 - 2649.28] the brain
[2647.28 - 2650.64] and so i know it's talking about fats
[2649.28 - 2652.08] being addicted and we're looking for the
[2650.64 - 2653.52] greasy foods and then we're looking for
[2652.08 - 2654.80] healthy fats because that's what we want
[2653.52 - 2656.56] to eat all the time but we have to
[2654.80 - 2658.80] remember
[2656.56 - 2660.80] that you got to lower those fats
