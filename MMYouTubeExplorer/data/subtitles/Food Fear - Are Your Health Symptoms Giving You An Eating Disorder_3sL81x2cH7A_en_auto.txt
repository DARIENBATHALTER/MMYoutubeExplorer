[3.00 - 6.88] an eating disorder when they're sick or

[15.96 - 20.60] tattoos ink how to keep your health safe
[19.44 - 23.24] really important right there I know a
[20.60 - 24.80] lot of people have ink I respect it I
[23.24 - 27.40] dig it there's a lot of great artist out
[24.80 - 29.04] there incredible gifted people that are
[27.40 - 32.36] doing all kinds of incredible designs
[29.04 - 34.68] and freehand on people's bodies body art
[32.36 - 37.40] I'm not against it you know it's not
[34.68 - 41.48] that kind of thing this is an anti-
[37.40 - 43.64] tattoo podcast episode but it's really
[41.48 - 45.96] important because it's an important
[43.64 - 47.96] podcast episode about tattoos and how to
[45.96 - 49.80] keep your health safe so it is really
[47.96 - 53.24] important so I talk about toxic heavy
[49.80 - 56.48] metals yes toxic heavy metals in your
[53.24 - 59.44] tattoo ink and how there is no such
[56.48 - 64.16] thing and I repeat there is no such
[59.44 - 66.48] thing as tattoo ink that's metal free I
[64.16 - 70.08] repeat so I just hope that gets out
[66.48 - 72.44] there and Rings throughout the ether and
[70.08 - 74.52] then leaves this planet and then heads
[72.44 - 77.00] through the solar system and then into
[74.52 - 79.20] the Galaxy and then out out of the
[77.00 - 81.36] Galaxy and into the universe and there
[79.20 - 83.36] forth because it's important to know and
[81.36 - 85.28] maybe people on another planet somewhere
[83.36 - 87.00] that are doing all this ink and tattoos
[85.28 - 89.20] and everything else maybe they'll hear
[87.00 - 92.12] it and that will travel all the way to
[89.20 - 94.52] that planet and get to them and someone
[92.12 - 95.92] will be sitting there maybe by a lake
[94.52 - 99.12] and they're going to hear it and it's
[95.92 - 102.16] going to be like there's no such thing
[99.12 - 104.00] as metal free ink there is no such thing
[102.16 - 106.16] I want people to know this I don't care
[104.00 - 108.52] if it's crueltyfree animal free the
[106.16 - 110.76] whole bit listen to this podcast episode
[108.52 - 113.32] it's not about being afraid of your
[110.76 - 115.48] tattoo or going to get your tattoo
[113.32 - 117.88] removed through the latest technology
[115.48 - 120.48] that they have it's not about that in
[117.88 - 124.60] fact I say in the podcast that episode
[120.48 - 126.52] itself don't remove your tattoos don't
[124.60 - 129.40] remove them unless for some reason you
[126.52 - 131.12] can't live with the tattoo and you want
[129.40 - 133.20] to go and you want to get it removed
[131.12 - 136.92] well that's your body your life of
[133.20 - 138.64] course you can but I recommend out there

[215.08 - 219.80] so much information really protective
[217.64 - 221.44] information too including things to
[219.80 - 223.40] avoid like certain supplementation and

[230.52 - 235.12] library get get it out of the library if
[232.96 - 238.04] you want okay so for instance if you
[235.12 - 239.92] have a hot spot in your intestinal tract
[238.04 - 242.52] so if you got a hot spot if you're
[239.92 - 245.60] inflamed somewhere in your intestinal
[242.52 - 248.20] tract if you're inflamed somewhere
[245.60 - 250.52] anywhere in here and you eat something
[248.20 - 252.48] and it finds its way going down here and
[250.52 - 254.52] it's taking its time and it's going
[252.48 - 256.92] through right and it finally gets down
[254.52 - 260.96] to that hot spot and it hits it and now
[256.92 - 264.52] you're nauseous or you got a pain you're
[260.96 - 266.72] going to think whoa it was that food
[264.52 - 268.36] food fear develops very easily because
[266.72 - 269.96] of this this is just one example I'm
[268.36 - 271.44] going to cut so much into this this
[269.96 - 273.00] information you're going to love it you
[271.44 - 275.92] are absolutely going to love this
[273.00 - 278.04] information so if you had a hot spot
[275.92 - 280.40] anywhere in your intestinal tra if you
[278.04 - 282.20] got a hot spot in your dadum see you got
[280.40 - 285.04] a lot of inflammation in your dadum
[282.20 - 287.60] because you have hpylori or you have an
[285.04 - 290.60] old infection that's been festering in
[287.60 - 293.24] there for 10 years 15 years say you got
[290.60 - 295.88] all this extra yeast and mold growing in
[293.24 - 297.76] here you're inflamed because of a virus
[295.88 - 299.72] or say like a shinkles virus creating
[297.76 - 301.72] colitis or something else so you got
[299.72 - 304.08] diagnosed with crohn's whatever it is
[301.72 - 306.56] that's going on whatever's happening
[304.08 - 308.28] here you got a hot spot inside your
[306.56 - 310.00] intestinal tract and maybe it never went
[308.28 - 311.04] that far and you've never been diagnosed
[310.00 - 312.68] and you're just kind of like you're
[311.04 - 315.20] dealing with certain aches and pains or
[312.68 - 317.04] certain stomach cramps or flatulence or
[315.20 - 321.72] stomach issues are bloating whatever it
[317.04 - 323.60] is the food you eat you'll associate it
[321.72 - 326.04] with those symptoms very quick and
[323.60 - 327.48] easily regardless of what it is it could
[326.04 - 328.80] be something really healthy it could be
[327.48 - 330.28] something really good for you it could
[328.80 - 332.76] be something like by the way these are

[407.08 - 411.12] something and you eat something and your
[409.56 - 414.52] bloating gets
[411.12 - 417.12] worse was it the food that just did that
[414.52 - 419.32] could it have been or was it just it was
[417.12 - 420.76] going to happen you already have a
[419.32 - 422.92] problem problem you're already having
[420.76 - 424.84] bloting problems was it the food you ate
[422.92 - 427.68] the day before you may not even know was
[424.84 - 431.64] it the food you ate 3 days before is it
[427.68 - 432.60] even the food is it even the food but
[431.64 - 435.64] you know what
[432.60 - 437.52] happens this gets messed up right here
[435.64 - 441.68] and it gets messed up quick that's right
[437.52 - 445.44] you guys this gets messed up because
[441.68 - 449.36] this gets messed with it's so easy to go
[445.44 - 451.76] down a rabbit hole with eating and food
[449.36 - 454.16] and eating in food when you don't even
[451.76 - 457.16] know why you're even having a symptom or
[454.16 - 461.48] a condition or a problem and we easily
[457.16 - 464.48] associate a food we have instantly to a
[461.48 - 466.48] problem right so if I had some kind of
[464.48 - 469.24] inflammation because I had some strep in
[466.48 - 471.44] my intestinal tract or strep in my colon
[469.24 - 473.08] and I had some ecoli in my colon and
[471.44 - 475.56] it's creating all kinds of different
[473.08 - 477.68] pivots and divots inside my colon and
[475.56 - 480.52] intestinal tract just say I had that
[477.68 - 483.36] right and then I eating something or
[480.52 - 485.64] whatever it is and then I'm not feeling
[483.36 - 488.20] good because that's starting to ache
[485.64 - 489.64] down here or however it is I'm going to
[488.20 - 491.64] be so messed up in my head I'm going to
[489.64 - 494.68] be like I I don't know if it was that
[491.64 - 497.72] maybe I should just have some toast some
[494.68 - 500.28] dry toast or something and scrape off
[497.72 - 502.84] the burnt stuff off the toast and just
[500.28 - 505.92] have that plain I'm nauseous I got some
[502.84 - 508.32] pain it confuses people everything does
[505.92 - 510.08] no matter what it is that they have you
[508.32 - 511.80] know going on and there's people who are
[510.08 - 513.16] suffering from bloating constantly and
[511.80 - 515.20] they want to get rid of that bloating so
[513.16 - 516.60] they get told to drink celery juice
[515.20 - 518.76] because they hear about it working and
[516.60 - 520.24] saving lives and they go and they have
[518.76 - 521.52] some and they're bloating still there
[520.24 - 523.36] and they're like oh it's the celery
[521.52 - 525.16] juice the celery juice is causing the
[523.36 - 527.76] problem now it's every day it's a new
[525.16 - 530.36] thing causing a problem and we get the
[527.76 - 532.72] food fear so the food fear just goes
[530.36 - 535.24] crazy in our minds and rightfully so
[532.72 - 537.92] because it's that confusing and that
[535.24 - 540.32] difficult to navigate and so people
[537.92 - 541.72] don't realize the minute you start
[540.32 - 543.16] getting sick the minute you start
[541.72 - 544.60] getting symptoms unless you've
[543.16 - 547.56] experienced this do you know what I'm
[544.60 - 549.96] talking about it's that intense
[547.56 - 552.64] wondering wish over there on YouTube my
[549.96 - 555.52] mind has been messed up with that is for
[552.64 - 558.04] sure hard to undo it especially when you
[555.52 - 560.12] just want to be normal again you can go
[558.04 - 562.08] down this rabbit hole and down it and
[560.12 - 563.76] down it and down it and down it and it
[562.08 - 565.84] can get really difficult for a lot of
[563.76 - 568.40] people you don't know what the heck to
[565.84 - 570.60] eat you just don't know like what do I
[568.40 - 572.32] eat what's okay can I eggs oh eggs feel
[570.60 - 573.84] okay in me for now let's go into that
[572.32 - 576.44] for a little bit

[755.00 - 759.56] mouth this can develop into an eating
[757.48 - 762.28] disorder where you're actually getting a
[759.56 - 764.36] PTSD eating disorder where every time
[762.28 - 768.56] food is entering into your mouth you're
[764.36 - 770.52] scared you're afraid now you're worried
[768.56 - 773.76] you're worried like is it going to be
[770.52 - 775.96] okay is it going to hurt I don't feel so
[773.76 - 778.28] good that food doesn't work for me and
[775.96 - 781.20] then you'll instantly cast out foods
[778.28 - 783.60] that actually are are there to help you
[781.20 - 787.92] heal and recover
[783.60 - 791.20] you but yet you might accidentally keep
[787.92 - 792.64] foods that are not helping you and you
[791.20 - 794.64] keep them in because they feel good in
[792.64 - 797.24] the moment it seems so that's where the
[794.64 - 800.20] confusion lies as well we sit there we
[797.24 - 803.40] don't know what to eat exactly and we'll
[800.20 - 805.80] eat a food that seems to settle okay
[803.40 - 808.00] feel okay but little do we know that
[805.80 - 810.24] food's feeding a problem a condition
[808.00 - 812.96] it's feeding some kind kind of virus or
[810.24 - 815.48] pathogen it's adding to a problem it's
[812.96 - 817.48] putting pressure on your pancreas more
[815.48 - 820.48] issues to your liver more sluggishness
[817.48 - 822.52] to your liver and you don't realize it
[820.48 - 824.60] and now you're just like okay I don't
[822.52 - 826.16] know what's good what's bad cuz then 3
[824.60 - 827.80] days later you're eating a food that
[826.16 - 829.52] seems to be comfortable and seems to be
[827.80 - 831.72] working 3 days later now you're getting
[829.52 - 833.20] sicker and you don't know what to do you
[831.72 - 834.48] don't know what it is and then you're
[833.20 - 836.16] like well I better eat something
[834.48 - 839.72] healthier I better try something
[836.16 - 842.80] healthier let me eat a salad let me eat
[839.72 - 845.04] some vegetables and then you're eating
[842.80 - 846.88] some crunchy vegetable you're chomping
[845.04 - 849.68] on a carrot that's something that a lot
[846.88 - 851.76] of people go to instantly that aren't
[849.68 - 853.68] eating that healthy and they don't know
[851.76 - 855.40] what to eat they're like okay I better
[853.68 - 857.08] do something good for myself I better
[855.40 - 860.00] eat something healthy and they end up
[857.08 - 861.96] chomping on a Raw carrot what happens
[860.00 - 863.20] when they do that they're they're
[861.96 - 865.88] they're the cre they're chomping on a
[863.20 - 868.76] Raw carrot all this roughage is coming
[865.88 - 871.36] from that hard kind of like crunchy Raw
[868.76 - 873.80] carrot it they send it down the track
[871.36 - 875.52] they're inflamed in weird little spots
[873.80 - 878.20] like in their intestinal tract or the
[875.52 - 879.92] bottom of their dadum they're inflamed
[878.20 - 882.40] they got a problem whether it's hpylori
[879.92 - 885.24] or stpy coli or something else going on
[882.40 - 888.04] or Ci or something and then when the
[885.24 - 891.44] food when the when the carrots the
[888.04 - 893.64] crunchy carrots that fibrous carrot
[891.44 - 895.80] starts to head down there it hits the
[893.64 - 897.56] hot spot and now they're nauseous
[895.80 - 899.56] they're nauseous they're sick they're
[897.56 - 901.60] like what's wrong with me I can't even
[899.56 - 903.44] eat a carrot I was told carrots are
[901.60 - 905.52] healthy and now they're all of a sudden
[903.44 - 909.92] scared they're in fear now they're
[905.52 - 912.12] eating butter on toast with an egg or
[909.92 - 913.80] they're eating cheese and they're like
[912.12 - 915.92] that's that's the only thing I can eat
[913.80 - 918.28] is a piece of cheese or an egg or a
[915.92 - 920.04] piece of toast and they end up in that
[918.28 - 922.08] situation where they're pretty much on
[920.04 - 923.52] toast egg and cheese diet I don't know
[922.08 - 926.88] if you guys have ever seen that it's
[923.52 - 929.00] like milk toast eggs and cheese that's
[926.88 - 931.84] what they end up in or rice pudding
[929.00 - 934.32] that's another one too Teressa oh my God
[931.84 - 936.72] you are talking directly to my mom right
[934.32 - 938.44] now she's really struggling this an
[936.72 - 940.92] important topic I'm so sorry your mom's
[938.44 - 942.52] struggling right now my heart pours out
[940.92 - 946.44] to her by the way okay
[942.52 - 948.96] Teressa um juel says yes my head got
[946.44 - 951.96] messed up because I was so afraid to eat
[948.96 - 953.96] and this is a really critical critical
[951.96 - 956.24] topic because it's happening every day
[953.96 - 958.00] to people new people every day people
[956.24 - 960.24] who have already been sick too every
[958.00 - 962.36] single day Lisa says this is me over
[960.24 - 963.92] there in IG I'm so sorry you guys
[962.36 - 966.72] struggled with this along the way I'm
[963.92 - 968.56] hitting the intestinal track talk first
[966.72 - 970.88] with this issue but we're going to go
[968.56 - 973.04] deeper into other places of how it works
[970.88 - 975.36] with your brain how it works with
[973.04 - 978.08] emotions how it works with creating the
[975.36 - 979.52] eating disorder the food fear because
[978.08 - 981.88] that's what we're talking about here is
[979.52 - 983.84] food fear and it's food fear developed
[981.88 - 986.16] from not feeling good and getting a
[983.84 - 988.20] symptom not knowing what to eat still
[986.16 - 990.00] struggling with that symptom associating
[988.20 - 992.20] that food with that that symptom and
[990.00 - 994.04] then we're now down a rabbit hole that's
[992.20 - 995.68] what we're talking about today so let's
[994.04 - 998.76] go into it first I want to take a little
[995.68 - 1001.16] sip here I want to finish some of my
[998.76 - 1004.76] orange you here if that's okay with you
[1001.16 - 1006.96] guys tra said this oh wait um TR said
[1004.76 - 1009.92] this is exactly my mother explanation
[1006.96 - 1012.68] points this is wild you're touching on
[1009.92 - 1015.72] exactly everything she's going through
[1012.68 - 1018.28] it's like you heard our prayers listen
[1015.72 - 1021.88] and I want to talk about to something
[1018.28 - 1023.72] very important okay that that you can
[1021.88 - 1026.48] heal and you can get better and you can
[1023.72 - 1028.92] recover and get past this there's a way
[1026.48 - 1031.32] also to understanding how this works
[1028.92 - 1032.80] with Foods where you're feeling this way
[1031.32 - 1034.52] and you're afraid and you're having that
[1032.80 - 1036.32] food fear but there's a way to come out
[1034.52 - 1038.88] of it and just having this knowledge
[1036.32 - 1040.76] alone is going to help people out there
[1038.88 - 1042.36] because once you understand this a
[1040.76 - 1044.20] little bit you understand your body then
[1042.36 - 1047.08] you understand what's going on and you
[1044.20 - 1049.00] could rise above the food fear and the
[1047.08 - 1052.28] eating disorders that are created and
[1049.00 - 1054.52] the PTSD that's created from it it's all
[1052.28 - 1057.28] important Catalina over there in IG this
[1054.52 - 1061.24] is exactly how I felt for 3 years whoa

[1061.24 - 1066.72] because everything makes me bloated and
[1064.44 - 1068.04] then it's scary and here's what happens
[1066.72 - 1069.68] on that one since we are in the
[1068.04 - 1071.68] intestinal tract talk let's go into
[1069.68 - 1073.76] bloating a little bit bloating can come
[1071.68 - 1077.20] and go at random times could be
[1073.76 - 1081.88] intermittent or always there right
[1077.20 - 1084.76] always there but but worse less worse
[1081.88 - 1088.36] still there and always there worse less

[1184.64 - 1188.64] this let's go into the bloating thing a
[1186.96 - 1191.16] little bit the bloating thing is a
[1188.64 - 1194.52] tricky one because you can be bloated
[1191.16 - 1196.64] from something you ate 2 days ago and
[1194.52 - 1198.28] then it still has you bloated and then
[1196.64 - 1201.20] you eat something that can get rid of
[1198.28 - 1203.60] your bloat so you drink or eat something
[1201.20 - 1207.72] that can get rid of your bloat and but
[1203.60 - 1211.80] you're now bloated you're bloed from
[1207.72 - 1214.84] something else before days ago even a
[1211.80 - 1216.16] week ago and now you're trying to eat
[1214.84 - 1219.12] something or take something or drink
[1216.16 - 1223.52] something that can fix your bloating if
[1219.12 - 1227.20] you knew to do it long term if you knew
[1223.52 - 1229.24] to do it long enough it could fix it but
[1227.20 - 1231.52] you'll never know because
[1229.24 - 1233.32] you'll never know you're still bloated
[1231.52 - 1235.12] you don't know to do something long-term
[1233.32 - 1236.56] enough you won't know what to avoid a
[1235.12 - 1238.76] lot of people won't know what to avoid
[1236.56 - 1241.36] and we run into a
[1238.76 - 1244.88] problem Michelle haters attacking the
[1241.36 - 1248.04] way we eat is just sad yep haters are
[1244.88 - 1250.72] really sad they are it's a lot of
[1248.04 - 1253.20] varieties of haters too like a lot of
[1250.72 - 1255.92] varieties of haters there's different
[1253.20 - 1260.16] Garden varieties of haters and then
[1255.92 - 1262.68] there's just evil evil Sinister haters
[1260.16 - 1265.24] and then there's demonically possessed
[1262.68 - 1267.56] haters that are evil to and then there's
[1265.24 - 1270.20] just I mean it's there's a whole
[1267.56 - 1272.24] different ladder of haters by the way
[1270.20 - 1274.12] there's jealous haters there's haters
[1272.24 - 1275.84] that want to destroy you there's haters
[1274.12 - 1277.88] that want to kill you there's haters
[1275.84 - 1279.80] that just want to see you whatever dead
[1277.88 - 1281.36] and then there's haters that just they
[1279.80 - 1283.00] can't help it they're just so jealous
[1281.36 - 1284.48] they just want to create problems
[1283.00 - 1287.20] there's a lot of haters out there all
[1284.48 - 1290.36] right that's the hater scale thank you
[1287.20 - 1292.44] celery force can we thank you seler
[1290.36 - 1294.40] force we'll do a whole hater scale right
[1292.44 - 1297.72] here we'll run through it really quick
[1294.40 - 1301.32] all right let's
[1297.72 - 1303.28] move so basically the bottom line is
[1301.32 - 1304.56] what I see in a lot of people and plus
[1303.28 - 1306.12] with the bloating and it wasn't going to
[1304.56 - 1310.80] be a bloating talk but it's good to talk
[1306.12 - 1313.56] about it a little bit what happens is
[1310.80 - 1315.80] that the HCL is so diminished your
[1313.56 - 1317.92] gastric lands are so
[1315.80 - 1319.76] diminished you have a lot of things
[1317.92 - 1321.44] growing in here that shouldn't be
[1319.76 - 1324.80] growing in
[1321.44 - 1326.80] here your liver stagnant and
[1324.80 - 1329.84] sluggish and you're
[1326.80 - 1333.08] bloating okay it has to be rectified it
[1329.84 - 1335.32] has to heal it you have to recover you
[1333.08 - 1338.68] have to get the bloating down like
[1335.32 - 1341.76] celery juice is critical for recovering
[1338.68 - 1343.92] bloat because it's restoring your htl
[1341.76 - 1347.08] it's restoring your gastric glands it's
[1343.92 - 1349.16] killing off pathogens yeast mold
[1347.08 - 1351.52] overgrowth of unproductive fun
[1349.16 - 1354.28] fungus that's important all on its own
[1351.52 - 1355.24] it's a medical medium tool you guys know
[1354.28 - 1356.56] that tool and there's a lot of other
[1355.24 - 1359.20] medical medium tools to get rid of
[1356.56 - 1361.88] bloating but the point is is that in
[1359.20 - 1365.40] order though to get rid of
[1361.88 - 1368.72] bloating one has to understand that they
[1365.40 - 1371.44] may be eating foods that aren't creating
[1368.72 - 1374.48] their bloating but they're going to help
[1371.44 - 1376.60] you get to the finish line but what
[1374.48 - 1380.04] happens with bloating is you may eat a
[1376.60 - 1382.88] healthy food that's going to help you
[1380.04 - 1385.48] get to the finish line but instead you
[1382.88 - 1387.00] get bloated because you're so hypers
[1385.48 - 1391.08] sensitive that you're going to bloat so
[1387.00 - 1393.76] easy you become afraid of that food you
[1391.08 - 1397.20] become afraid of 4 ounces of celery
[1393.76 - 1400.44] juice you become afraid of
[1397.20 - 1403.72] papaya afraid of a steamed
[1400.44 - 1406.92] potato you become afraid of a wild
[1403.72 - 1408.08] blueberry you become afraid of something
[1406.92 - 1410.16] and then you're in this place where
[1408.08 - 1413.36] you're afraid now of spinach you're
[1410.16 - 1415.44] afraid of a leafy graen and when you get
[1413.36 - 1418.20] to that point of fear and you don't know
[1415.44 - 1420.48] what to eat we end up going to comfort
[1418.20 - 1422.24] Foods foods that we've been eating since
[1420.48 - 1424.08] we were a child foods that we've been
[1422.24 - 1426.56] eating since we were young and we end up
[1424.08 - 1429.60] running to like eggs cheese and toast
[1426.56 - 1432.88] again we end up running back to Pasta
[1429.60 - 1435.20] macaroni and cheese eggs toast we end up
[1432.88 - 1437.20] running back to bread we end up running
[1435.20 - 1440.00] back to these kinds of foods or we end
[1437.20 - 1441.76] up running back to treats and chocolate
[1440.00 - 1444.60] and things like that because we don't
[1441.76 - 1446.60] know where to go we get stressed we're
[1444.60 - 1449.20] totally frustrated with our healing
[1446.60 - 1451.72] process and what's wrong and we just we
[1449.20 - 1454.48] go running for things that aren't going
[1451.72 - 1458.76] to help us and it happens every day out
[1454.48 - 1460.92] there mono eating is a miracle okay a
[1458.76 - 1462.76] miracle for people so I'm going to grab
[1460.92 - 1465.64] the cleanse the heel book right
[1462.76 - 1469.00] here all right so medical medium put
[1465.64 - 1471.32] mono eating um on the map all these
[1469.00 - 1475.92] years and it's important to understand
[1471.32 - 1479.04] how it works right when you do like a
[1475.92 - 1482.52] mono eating where it's like bananas and
[1479.04 - 1484.28] celery juice or steamed potatoes and
[1482.52 - 1486.56] celery juice and if you look you'll see
[1484.28 - 1488.68] the different varieties in here what
[1486.56 - 1489.44] happens is that you end up building up
[1488.68 - 1493.24] your
[1489.44 - 1495.60] HCL you end up healing the environment

[1495.60 - 1500.60] reducing pathogen loads and you you end
[1498.64 - 1502.88] up recovering so so many people go to
[1500.60 - 1505.72] the mono eating and cleanse the heel
[1502.88 - 1508.40] because it literally saves their life it
[1505.72 - 1510.72] saves them from surgeries I can't tell
[1508.40 - 1513.08] you how many people that have reached
[1510.72 - 1516.04] out out there in the world in medical M
[1513.08 - 1518.92] community that were able to avoid a
[1516.04 - 1521.00] surgery where their doctor their surgeon
[1518.92 - 1522.64] said you don't have to get 20 Ines of
[1521.00 - 1525.28] your colon cut out you don't have to get
[1522.64 - 1529.20] 20 in of your intestinal tract cut
[1525.28 - 1533.16] out and they actually literally save
[1529.20 - 1536.00] their themselves from radical surgical
[1533.16 - 1539.04] procedures because you're doing the mono
[1536.00 - 1542.24] cleanse okay in cleanse to heal it's
[1539.04 - 1544.48] that powerful and then once you heal a
[1542.24 - 1546.76] lot of the hot spots in here too so once

[1546.76 - 1551.28] add more healing tools you don't have to
[1548.92 - 1553.16] be on the monoc cleanse forever a lot of
[1551.28 - 1555.52] people they go on the monoc cleanse for
[1553.16 - 1557.32] just a short time and they just correct
[1555.52 - 1559.64] themselves they reable themselves it's
[1557.32 - 1562.60] incredible a lot of people go on it
[1559.64 - 1565.04] longer see casy shman says over there on

[1579.32 - 1581.60] happens is that a lot of people with
[1580.60 - 1584.80] food
[1581.60 - 1587.40] sensitivities the monoc cleanse corrects
[1584.80 - 1589.20] them starts to restore the person moves
[1587.40 - 1590.48] them P back back out of this and I'm
[1589.20 - 1592.64] talking about the monoc cleans cuz so
[1590.48 - 1594.48] many people have food fear and if they
[1592.64 - 1596.80] have a symptom or condition anything
[1594.48 - 1598.88] intestinal tract anything stomach
[1596.80 - 1602.08] anything like that that they're
[1598.88 - 1607.32] suffering and struggling with it's now a
[1602.08 - 1610.04] game of PTSD what do I eat food
[1607.32 - 1611.88] fear and we end up with this eating
[1610.04 - 1613.44] disorder around all of it and we're
[1611.88 - 1614.80] suffering and we're struggling and we
[1613.44 - 1616.68] don't know how to get out of it but when
[1614.80 - 1618.00] you have direction and you know what to
[1616.68 - 1620.32] do and you end up doing something like
[1618.00 - 1622.24] the medical medium monoc cleanse and you
[1620.32 - 1624.16] choose one that's right for you just
[1622.24 - 1625.48] choose the one that you feel will work
[1624.16 - 1627.08] because that's the whole thing you can
[1625.48 - 1629.56] choose different ones in here you could
[1627.08 - 1631.56] try one try another and then what
[1629.56 - 1634.84] happens is as you're recovering at least
[1631.56 - 1638.56] you have a a schematic at least you have
[1634.84 - 1640.92] a catalyst to actually adhere by to take
[1638.56 - 1642.76] you to that finish line where you don't
[1640.92 - 1646.04] have to be always questioning things
[1642.76 - 1648.20] like is this not good is this not good
[1646.04 - 1649.80] because you don't have to question some
[1648.20 - 1651.96] something that's literally saved that
[1649.80 - 1653.64] many lives and healed that many people
[1651.96 - 1655.64] the track record the street credit is
[1653.64 - 1657.24] already built into this so it's not like
[1655.64 - 1659.48] you're going to it like did anybody ever

[1697.00 - 1701.80] that hot spots we're talking about how
[1699.52 - 1704.36] someone could be like I can't eat any
[1701.80 - 1708.16] vegetables I cannot eat any raw
[1704.36 - 1711.36] vegetables aw I can't eat raw lettuce I
[1708.16 - 1714.92] can't eat raw greens I can't eat
[1711.36 - 1716.76] anything raw it hurts my stomach and it
[1714.92 - 1718.48] doesn't digest and what they don't
[1716.76 - 1719.92] realize when they can't eat some raw
[1718.48 - 1722.12] spinach or they can't eat some raw
[1719.92 - 1726.48] Tomatoes or raw cucumbers what they
[1722.12 - 1729.84] don't realize is the cucumber is
[1726.48 - 1732.44] digesting the tomato is
[1729.84 - 1734.32] digesting the lettuce is
[1732.44 - 1737.08] digesting they don't think it's
[1734.32 - 1740.76] digesting but it is but what they're
[1737.08 - 1743.68] feeling is inflamed nerves attached to
[1740.76 - 1746.60] the Linings of the intestinal
[1743.68 - 1750.08] tract so they're
[1746.60 - 1752.08] feeling inflamed areas along the
[1750.08 - 1755.12] intestinal
[1752.08 - 1758.60] tract they're feeling hot
[1755.12 - 1761.08] spots is what they're feeling so as the
[1758.60 - 1762.92] lettuce is moving through and the
[1761.08 - 1766.00] tomatoes are moving
[1762.92 - 1768.76] through and the cucumbers are moving
[1766.00 - 1771.72] through it's hitting a hot spot
[1768.76 - 1777.44] and they going I'm not digesting this
[1771.72 - 1777.44] I'm not digesting this I don't think I'm
[1777.52 - 1783.08] digesting I can't eat a cucumber ever
[1779.92 - 1786.56] again I can't eat a raw cucumber ever
[1783.08 - 1788.64] again I can't eat a tomato I can't eat
[1786.56 - 1790.68] lettuce ever
[1788.64 - 1794.32] again what they don't
[1790.68 - 1796.40] realize is it's okay to eat the lettuce
[1794.32 - 1799.04] it's okay to eat the Cucumber it's okay
[1796.40 - 1802.00] to eat the tomato but then they're in
[1799.04 - 1804.60] fear that it's not okay because they're
[1802.00 - 1807.40] feeling something but what they don't
[1804.60 - 1810.52] realize is they're feeling a hot
[1807.40 - 1812.64] spot they're feeling a Hot Spot
[1810.52 - 1813.64] somewhere whether it's a hot spot where
[1812.64 - 1816.00] it's just
[1813.64 - 1819.80] bloat or it's a hot spot where they're
[1816.00 - 1823.20] feeling a cramp or some pressure or a
[1819.80 - 1825.88] little bit of pain or discomfort or
[1823.20 - 1828.48] something else and they're feeling like
[1825.88 - 1830.08] they're not digesting that wrong lettuce
[1828.48 - 1831.60] they feel like they're not digesting
[1830.08 - 1834.20] there's tomatoes and
[1831.60 - 1836.32] cucumbers and that orange they ate or
[1834.20 - 1839.84] whatever it is and they're just like I
[1836.32 - 1842.88] cannot eat citrus I cannot ever have
[1839.84 - 1845.12] citrus I can never have a cucumber I
[1842.88 - 1847.20] can't have a tomato rolled out rolled
[1845.12 - 1849.68] out they rolled out went out no Citrus
[1847.20 - 1853.36] no cucumber no tomato No cilantro no
[1849.68 - 1856.44] spinach no lettuce no kale no MH no this
[1853.36 - 1858.64] no that they've rolled it all out gone
[1856.44 - 1860.36] gone gone they you can't have a raw
[1858.64 - 1863.00] piece of broccoli ever you can't have a
[1860.36 - 1866.72] raw piece of cauliflower anymore all
[1863.00 - 1868.04] those are ruled out and gone so we have
[1866.72 - 1871.32] this problem
[1868.04 - 1873.24] where they can't eat anything raw
[1871.32 - 1876.88] completely rolled out so now they're in
[1873.24 - 1880.28] that zone nothing raw so what that means
[1876.88 - 1882.40] is they won't even have any raw juice
[1880.28 - 1884.60] they won't have raw celery they won't
[1882.40 - 1886.24] have raw celery juice which is different
[1884.60 - 1888.76] and it works differently you guys know
[1886.24 - 1890.92] the whole rules with celery juice
[1888.76 - 1893.28] 16 ounces on an empty
[1890.92 - 1896.28] stomach
[1893.28 - 1898.72] strained right strained so it can get in
[1896.28 - 1901.00] there do its thing flush clean the liver
[1898.72 - 1903.24] rebuild the hydrochloric acid get things
[1901.00 - 1907.04] back to back to square
[1903.24 - 1908.52] one but the point is all that roughage
[1907.04 - 1910.24] they'll never be able to eat a carrot
[1908.52 - 1913.40] rolled out carrots
[1910.24 - 1919.00] gone raw cabbage in a salad raw cabbage
[1913.40 - 1922.84] is gone everything by heirloom tomato
[1919.00 - 1926.76] gone so you walk down red bell peppers
[1922.84 - 1928.36] gone so it just suddenly it's food fear
[1926.76 - 1931.60] I can't eat
[1928.36 - 1936.04] anything all of these foods are
[1931.60 - 1938.76] gone Apple peaches nectarines Cherries
[1936.04 - 1941.20] Berries
[1938.76 - 1944.36] gone melons
[1941.20 - 1947.04] gone it just disappears it's out of your
[1944.36 - 1950.64] diet now so now you're like I can only
[1947.04 - 1953.52] do cook food or
[1950.64 - 1954.56] toast or eggs and I hear eggs are so
[1953.52 - 1955.96] healthy and blah blah blah and
[1954.56 - 1958.08] everybody's talking about eggs so let me
[1955.96 - 1959.60] go on a whole bunch of eggs four or six
[1958.08 - 1962.04] eggs a day because it's the only thing I
[1959.60 - 1964.96] can eat because it doesn't seem to hurt
[1962.04 - 1967.92] when I eat an egg so what they don't
[1964.96 - 1970.00] realize is they end up losing all these
[1967.92 - 1973.08] foods that can help them
[1970.00 - 1974.60] heal but then because they don't
[1973.08 - 1976.08] understand and how know how to read
[1974.60 - 1978.04] their hot
[1976.08 - 1979.36] spots and they think they're not
[1978.04 - 1981.76] digesting it
[1979.36 - 1985.32] whatsoever and they have food fear to
[1981.76 - 1988.16] towards all these foods and then they
[1985.32 - 1992.24] eat an egg and they don't feel anything
[1988.16 - 1996.28] no hot spot no problem no discomfort
[1992.24 - 1999.44] they eat a nice fluffy scrambled egg
[1996.28 - 2001.52] they need a n they eat a nice batch of
[1999.44 - 2004.12] fluffy egg
[2001.52 - 2006.76] whites and it goes down in here they get
[2004.12 - 2008.64] a hardboiled egg and it goes down and it
[2006.76 - 2010.28] sits in here and what's happening what
[2008.64 - 2013.40] they don't realize is the egg is
[2010.28 - 2017.24] liquefying it's turning into a goo and
[2013.40 - 2019.88] that goo isn't massaging the intestinal
[2017.24 - 2022.16] tract it's not massaging the colon It's
[2019.88 - 2024.00] not massaging the stomach and what's
[2022.16 - 2027.84] happening is that egg is just turning
[2024.00 - 2031.32] into a little like a ball of glue forget
[2027.84 - 2034.56] eggs that bread is turning into a ball
[2031.32 - 2037.76] of glue forget bread that cheese is
[2034.56 - 2040.04] turning into a ball of glue and it
[2037.76 - 2041.28] sitting in there and it feels okay it
[2040.04 - 2044.20] feels
[2041.28 - 2046.56] good hey that bread pasta
[2044.20 - 2049.92] basically that wheat
[2046.56 - 2053.04] pasta with the cheese sitting in there
[2049.92 - 2054.52] like goo and it's not touching anything
[2053.04 - 2057.44] so it's not touching any of the hot
[2054.52 - 2059.84] spots you're not getting red flags no
[2057.44 - 2061.92] red flag here no red flag there no red
[2059.84 - 2063.64] flag there but what's happening is the
[2061.92 - 2066.00] eggs the dairy products the cheese the
[2063.64 - 2068.64] milk the butter all of that that's
[2066.00 - 2072.96] sitting in here is
[2068.64 - 2072.96] feeding what's keeping you
[2073.64 - 2079.16] sick it's feeding what's keeping you
[2080.56 - 2086.28] sick and then you end up with the same
[2083.92 - 2088.40] symptoms no matter what that come and go
[2086.28 - 2090.40] so now it's not like every symptoms gone
[2088.40 - 2094.40] cuz you're eating milk eggs cheese and
[2090.40 - 2096.28] butter and bread and it's becoming a goo
[2094.40 - 2098.28] and it's not touching anything inside
[2096.28 - 2101.68] and it's becoming a goo it's not any hot
[2098.28 - 2103.68] spots for the moment but you stay sick
[2101.68 - 2105.88] you end up getting sicker and then all
[2103.68 - 2109.00] of a sudden because everything you're
[2105.88 - 2111.36] eating is feeding the bad bugs the
[2109.00 - 2114.56] bacteria the unproductive yeast the
[2111.36 - 2116.32] unproductive fungus and mold the viruses
[2114.56 - 2119.60] because what you're eating is feeding
[2116.32 - 2122.96] all of that you all of a sudden get a
[2119.60 - 2125.52] spill you get a
[2122.96 - 2128.28] spill a spill
[2125.52 - 2131.48] over what that means is

[2131.48 - 2136.12] proliferated the viruses got a little
[2133.48 - 2139.76] too too fat and happy and it spilled
[2136.12 - 2142.48] over and it blew up and now you're
[2139.76 - 2145.56] sick you're sick you still got a lot of
[2142.48 - 2148.24] the cramping the pain you're having like
[2145.56 - 2150.52] a spill

[2393.60 - 2398.48] symptom and now the food becomes
[2396.68 - 2400.32] questionable
[2398.48 - 2403.72] this is so so
[2400.32 - 2406.12] powerful hey Melanie over there on
[2403.72 - 2407.48] YouTube thank you for timestamping so
[2406.12 - 2409.24] many of those things you do on YouTube
[2407.48 - 2410.76] when you do the the comment and you time
[2409.24 - 2412.96] stamp it like you do that's actually
[2410.76 - 2416.12] really cool by the
[2412.96 - 2418.84] way in some cases if it's a chronic
[2416.12 - 2421.40] nausea for example then Foods become
[2418.84 - 2425.68] pick and choose a game of what's going
[2421.40 - 2428.84] to help ease this nausea the nausea hell
[2425.68 - 2433.12] the nausea hell have you been through it
[2428.84 - 2437.36] before it torments pregnant
[2433.12 - 2439.28] women who don't know what to eat they
[2437.36 - 2441.72] have a baby
[2439.28 - 2444.04] developing the baby developing needs
[2441.72 - 2446.04] nutrients the best
[2444.04 - 2449.60] nutrients the
[2446.04 - 2449.60] nausea is like
[2449.80 - 2455.24] this
[2451.56 - 2457.44] barrier to getting nutrients to the baby
[2455.24 - 2460.36] because when women become pregnant and
[2457.44 - 2462.28] they're nauseous all the time they end
[2460.36 - 2464.80] up choosing foods that are trying to
[2462.28 - 2466.52] work with the nausea versus choosing a
[2464.80 - 2469.28] food that's going to be really good for
[2466.52 - 2471.52] that early stage of development for the
[2469.28 - 2473.44] baby instead they're choosing things
[2471.52 - 2475.20] like anything to break the nausea
[2473.44 - 2477.32] they're choosing chocolate loaded with
[2475.20 - 2479.92] caffeine that's really bad
[2477.32 - 2481.96] for the tiny cells that are developing
[2479.92 - 2484.56] into a a
[2481.96 - 2486.36] fetus and so what's happening so they're
[2484.56 - 2488.84] choosing things that are they're trying
[2486.36 - 2492.04] to calm the nausey down the morning
[2488.84 - 2496.48] sickness so they're just eating gluten
[2492.04 - 2499.52] Rich toast with butter they're drinking
[2496.48 - 2502.04] coffee yes they're eating chocolate
[2499.52 - 2504.20] they're just eating pasta and cheese
[2502.04 - 2507.24] they're eating chocolate cake they're
[2504.20 - 2508.80] just working with the nausea no judgment
[2507.24 - 2511.72] nothing like that I'm giving you an
[2508.80 - 2515.36] example of how those early cells of the
[2511.72 - 2518.16] baby need celery
[2515.36 - 2522.52] juice they need sweet
[2518.16 - 2526.48] potatoes they need winter squash kaboa
[2522.52 - 2528.68] squash they need beautiful red
[2526.48 - 2531.56] potatoes they need
[2528.68 - 2533.32] blueberries they need raspberries they
[2531.56 - 2535.92] need all of these things these early
[2533.32 - 2538.88] cells of the baby that are just
[2535.92 - 2540.24] developing need all of these foods but
[2538.88 - 2542.80] instead because of the
[2540.24 - 2545.08] nausea those foods are on the list for a
[2542.80 - 2547.24] lot of women that get that early nausea
[2545.08 - 2549.16] with early pregnancy and they're just
[2547.24 - 2552.04] looking for just glue they're looking
[2549.16 - 2554.60] for just glue to just kind of calm the
[2552.04 - 2554.60] nausea
[2554.84 - 2560.92] down okay in some cases if someone has
[2558.32 - 2563.96] chronic nausea and chronic nausea just
[2560.92 - 2567.68] minus the pregnancy like nausea in
[2563.96 - 2570.84] general can really rule the roost with
[2567.68 - 2574.20] food fear picking choices suffering and
[2570.84 - 2576.72] struggling the nausey is a big one Foods
[2574.20 - 2578.72] become pick and choose a game of what's
[2576.72 - 2580.68] going to help ease the nausea is this
[2578.72 - 2582.36] going to help ease the nausea today is
[2580.68 - 2584.76] this going to help let me try this let
[2582.36 - 2586.36] me try that no that doesn't work for me
[2584.76 - 2587.84] oh I better try some celery juice to
[2586.36 - 2589.96] ease the nausea oh it's not easing the
[2587.84 - 2592.96] nausea oh never drink celery juice again
[2589.96 - 2595.36] it's a bad idea it becomes a pick and
[2592.96 - 2598.16] choose game of what's going to help ease
[2595.36 - 2600.76] this nausea what's not helping this
[2598.16 - 2603.16] nausea do any of these Foods I'm eating
[2600.76 - 2605.28] contribute to this nausea that's what it
[2603.16 - 2608.16] comes it becomes literally
[2605.28 - 2610.88] Madness you're not crazy
[2608.16 - 2614.84] nobody's crazy who's going through
[2610.88 - 2617.40] this but it creates a type of Madness
[2614.84 - 2620.20] with the nause this is a prime example
[2617.40 - 2623.20] Deborah over there Deborah Lynn designs
[2620.20 - 2625.80] that was me nauseous for six months lost
[2623.20 - 2625.80] 20
[2625.88 - 2632.72] lbs how come when I'm not eating I still
[2629.20 - 2634.00] have the nausea there's that person the
[2632.72 - 2636.04] person that's still that's not even
[2634.00 - 2637.80] eating and they still have the nausea
[2636.04 - 2639.92] and then then there's the person
[2637.80 - 2642.92] who the nausea goes away when they're
[2639.92 - 2645.48] not eating so they're not eating and not
[2642.92 - 2647.64] eating and then when they pick a food
[2645.48 - 2651.80] and they get the nausea back they
[2647.64 - 2652.96] associate a whiplash to that food they
[2651.80 - 2656.88] grab an
[2652.96 - 2661.40] Apple the Apple they eat apple goes down
[2656.88 - 2664.76] to shoot they get the nausea the Apple's
[2661.40 - 2669.04] poison there's a mental Association to
[2664.76 - 2669.04] the Apple throw the Apple away
[2670.80 - 2675.92] LeBlanc says I definitely had food fear
[2673.56 - 2677.64] during pregnancy I was so scared to eat
[2675.92 - 2680.64] anything with
[2677.64 - 2683.76] seasoning
[2680.64 - 2685.96] indeed Jennifer gagan says can you
[2683.76 - 2688.28] explain the cause of the nausea I threw
[2685.96 - 2691.68] up for nine months
[2688.28 - 2693.16] straight oh my God it's really difficult
[2691.68 - 2695.72] for so many people I'm so sorry you've
[2693.16 - 2695.72] gone through
[2695.80 - 2700.48] that do do any of the foods I'm eating
[2698.48 - 2702.80] are they the reason for my nausea are
[2700.48 - 2705.52] they creating the nausea then our mind
[2702.80 - 2707.64] and our Consciousness starts to pick up
[2705.52 - 2710.16] on patterns and habits because of small
[2707.64 - 2713.16] bursts of PTSD developing did you hear
[2710.16 - 2716.24] that you guys you guys got to have this
[2713.16 - 2718.20] book tell other people about this book
[2716.24 - 2720.56] such a great
[2718.20 - 2723.36] book you eat something and you're
[2720.56 - 2726.96] nauseous so you
[2723.36 - 2730.44] identify that food as being the problem
[2726.96 - 2732.56] so you learn to avoid that food just as
[2730.44 - 2734.36] you get comfortable eating another food
[2732.56 - 2736.92] thinking you're safe and good you get
[2734.36 - 2739.56] nauseous again you just got comfortable
[2736.92 - 2741.08] with that food you're starting to eat an
[2739.56 - 2742.68] orange you're comfortable with that food
[2741.08 - 2745.12] it didn't give me nauseousness didn't
[2742.68 - 2746.92] give me nausea yesterday and now I got
[2745.12 - 2750.52] nauseousness today cuz I'm having that
[2746.92 - 2753.32] Orange Boom see you later orange Gone
[2750.52 - 2753.32] With the Wind
[2753.48 - 2757.68] man you just started getting comfortable
[2755.96 - 2759.84] with each food and then you're
[2757.68 - 2761.96] uncomfortable with that food so Kiss It
[2759.84 - 2764.04] Goodbye you think you're safe and you
[2761.96 - 2768.16] think you're good and then boom you're
[2764.04 - 2769.28] not safe anymore safeness is gone so
[2768.16 - 2771.24] then that's another food you're
[2769.28 - 2773.80] uncomfortable eating suspecting it's
[2771.24 - 2776.76] contributing to the problem is that my
[2773.80 - 2779.16] problem is it my problem this can carry
[2776.76 - 2781.44] on into other Foods as well nausea
[2779.16 - 2784.60] doesn't usually receive a diagnosis
[2781.44 - 2787.64] because nausea or maybe nervous could
[2784.60 - 2789.36] maybe be nervousness and anxiety
[2787.64 - 2791.60] if everything checks out okay in the
[2789.36 - 2793.60] abdomen it's passed off as you're just
[2791.60 - 2795.68] sensitive so nausea really is the
[2793.60 - 2797.44] diagnosis it doesn't really get a
[2795.68 - 2800.12] diagnosis especially if everything
[2797.44 - 2801.24] checks out okay if you're somebody with
[2800.12 - 2803.52] a mystery
[2801.24 - 2804.92] nausea and everything looks okay and
[2803.52 - 2808.44] checks out
[2804.92 - 2810.88] okay you're sensitive that's what is
[2808.44 - 2813.24] told to each person what's not told to
[2810.88 - 2816.32] the person is they might have a pathogen
[2813.24 - 2818.92] stirring the pot they might have a vagus
[2816.32 - 2820.52] nerve problem creating a problem they
[2818.92 - 2823.84] might have other things too you might
[2820.52 - 2825.68] have inflamed nerves vagus nerves going
[2823.84 - 2830.60] around your intestinal track and so
[2825.68 - 2830.60] forth and it's giving you vagal
[2831.48 - 2837.28] nausea this mystery nausea can bring
[2834.04 - 2839.24] about serious Eating Disorders even when

[3258.56 - 3261.52] out with the pain in my chest the
[3260.04 - 3263.28] tightness of my chest I started out and
[3261.52 - 3264.88] they said it was panic attacks but then
[3263.28 - 3266.48] I got tingles and numbness in my arms
[3264.88 - 3268.04] and then I got this and then I got this
[3266.48 - 3269.08] I got fatigue that doesn't matter
[3268.04 - 3270.52] anymore it's all about what you're
[3269.08 - 3273.92] eating
[3270.52 - 3276.80] now affirmation 65 over there in IG that
[3273.92 - 3281.24] was my life
[3276.80 - 3285.00] OMG you got an audience now you sought
[3281.24 - 3287.40] out doctors to get help but that's long
[3285.00 - 3290.04] been forgotten by the
[3287.40 - 3293.08] audience especially if you're like 21 or
[3290.04 - 3297.52] 25 years old or 28 years old
[3293.08 - 3299.44] or 18 years old or younger or
[3297.52 - 3302.12] however maybe in your 30s but either way
[3299.44 - 3304.76] you have an audience now and now you got
[3302.12 - 3307.88] like friends friends
[3304.76 - 3310.24] friends family family friends family
[3307.88 - 3312.24] friends co-workers families friends and
[3310.24 - 3314.28] they're all watching you and it isn't
[3312.24 - 3316.92] about your symptoms anymore it's just
[3314.28 - 3319.48] about you and your food and how you
[3316.92 - 3320.96] screwed up it's you and your food and
[3319.48 - 3322.80] how you have a must have an eating
[3320.96 - 3325.16] disorder now and maybe your symptoms
[3322.80 - 3326.76] weren't really real to begin with maybe
[3325.16 - 3329.36] you're that just the problems weren't
[3326.76 - 3331.44] really real maybe you're not really sick
[3329.36 - 3334.04] you were sick you got doctors saying you
[3331.44 - 3335.88] were sick I guess but all that's kind of
[3334.04 - 3336.96] drifting away cuz it's all about what
[3335.88 - 3338.56] you're putting in your mouth in your
[3336.96 - 3341.04] foods and your problems and your foods
[3338.56 - 3345.08] and that's compiling and compounding the
[3341.04 - 3347.20] PTSD causing now even more riffs more
[3345.08 - 3349.04] PTSD and now you feel like you're really
[3347.20 - 3351.36] down the rabbit hole and no one
[3349.04 - 3353.84] understands you and you're
[3351.36 - 3355.20] misunderstood mean J over there on
[3353.84 - 3358.60] YouTube thank you for being here by the
[3355.20 - 3361.56] way you're speaking to me right now you
[3358.60 - 3364.52] you said you commented amazing ter appan
[3361.56 - 3367.12] can relate to everything you're
[3364.52 - 3369.44] describing over there in IG family and
[3367.12 - 3372.32] friends could never understand it wasn't
[3369.44 - 3374.96] until I had to have emergency surgery
[3372.32 - 3379.28] that they believed
[3374.96 - 3382.80] me the focus is all gone now it's the
[3379.28 - 3386.52] focus on you're not eating enough are
[3382.80 - 3389.88] you eating enough you're eating too much
[3386.52 - 3392.96] you're getting too skinny you're looking
[3389.88 - 3397.36] sickly you need to put some meat on your
[3392.96 - 3400.40] bones are you getting enough
[3397.36 - 3404.08] protein and you're not eating the right
[3400.40 - 3405.04] things then the fear of eating occurs
[3404.08 - 3407.40] and
[3405.04 - 3409.52] intensifies and that's harder than
[3407.40 - 3411.56] anyone can understand and it happens
[3409.52 - 3413.80] every day out there there are people
[3411.56 - 3416.24] just you know there are people that
[3413.80 - 3417.60] Heckle the medical medium community and
[3416.24 - 3419.04] and they're just trying to put fear and
[3417.60 - 3421.20] doubt in their minds are you getting
[3419.04 - 3423.72] enough protein are you getting enough
[3421.20 - 3425.80] protein there's so there's it's
[3423.72 - 3427.92] everywhere it's everywhere and when
[3425.80 - 3431.84] you're sick and struggling and you don't
[3427.92 - 3435.64] feel good it's like the vultures come in
[3431.84 - 3438.16] is what they do the vultures come in and
[3435.64 - 3439.80] they just say the rotten this crap and
[3438.16 - 3441.88] they don't understand what you've been
[3439.80 - 3444.52] through they don't know what your
[3441.88 - 3447.56] struggles are they're not in your shoes
[3444.52 - 3450.16] and at your home
[3447.56 - 3450.16] they don't get
[3450.72 - 3456.64] it even if you
[3453.20 - 3458.96] diagnose Even If you're diagnosed with a
[3456.64 - 3461.44] named physical condition right off the
[3458.96 - 3463.48] bat it's easy to develop an eating
[3461.44 - 3465.24] disorder in part because there's still
[3463.48 - 3466.76] not a medical understanding of what
[3465.24 - 3470.88] causes the
[3466.76 - 3473.12] condition so it's not getting healed
[3470.88 - 3475.20] somebody with a simple case of heartburn
[3473.12 - 3476.92] acid reflux or exam for example can
[3475.20 - 3479.12] develop an eating order because it's
[3476.92 - 3479.88] always on their mind let's hit that a
[3479.12 - 3483.28] little
[3479.88 - 3486.36] bit W blueberries over
[3483.28 - 3489.00] there the protein brainwashing has drove
[3486.36 - 3492.12] me crazy and we will have to deal with
[3489.00 - 3497.04] it for the rest of
[3492.12 - 3498.60] Life yeah this just that's powerful by
[3497.04 - 3501.92] the
[3498.60 - 3503.56] way okay so I want to go into this part
[3501.92 - 3505.36] this is interesting right here right
[3503.56 - 3507.96] even if it's something like a simple
[3505.36 - 3509.76] case of of heartburn acid reflux you
[3507.96 - 3512.52] guys for example it can develop into an
[3509.76 - 3515.12] eating disorder because it's always on
[3512.52 - 3517.52] your mind because it's here it's like
[3515.12 - 3519.00] heartburn what do I eat oh that bothers
[3517.52 - 3521.96] me oh that doesn't bother me that
[3519.00 - 3524.24] doesn't bother me that bothers
[3521.96 - 3525.80] me a friend I haven't talked to in a
[3524.24 - 3527.88] long long time reached out to me and
[3525.80 - 3529.76] said you know I got this heartburn acid
[3527.88 - 3533.48] reflux thing I did all the testing at
[3529.76 - 3536.24] the doctor I did all this everything and
[3533.48 - 3539.64] um it's like I'm scared to eat anything
[3536.24 - 3541.60] W scared to eat anything anything I eat
[3539.64 - 3543.84] I don't know this was working for me
[3541.60 - 3546.48] yesterday it's not working for me today
[3543.84 - 3549.36] this might work for me tomorrow but it
[3546.48 - 3552.96] didn't when tomorrow came yesterday and
[3549.36 - 3552.96] your mind goes wof
[3553.48 - 3558.20] wof eating a food that seems to be
[3556.00 - 3560.28] working gives you a sense of security
[3558.20 - 3562.20] then if it isn't working anymore and the
[3560.28 - 3565.24] acid reflux or nausea returns it's like
[3562.20 - 3567.56] an old friend letting you down old
[3565.24 - 3569.68] friend letting you down sometimes it's
[3567.56 - 3571.84] not about the symptoms sometimes
[3569.68 - 3574.48] experiences when you're eating that food
[3571.84 - 3578.60] it's about what they're told about that
[3574.48 - 3581.48] food so here's a real brain screw
[3578.60 - 3583.64] is even if you discover somewhere along
[3581.48 - 3586.08] the way the right food to eat to heal
[3583.64 - 3588.52] yourself some [ __ ] is going to like
[3586.08 - 3590.00] tell you that it's the wrong food and
[3588.52 - 3592.64] it's bad for
[3590.00 - 3596.92] you I don't know how anybody can heal
[3592.64 - 3599.64] anymore out there I just don't know it's
[3596.92 - 3601.68] that bad there's that many sick people
[3599.64 - 3605.32] and they're just biohacking themselves
[3601.68 - 3608.00] to death and everybody's like squealing
[3605.32 - 3611.00] like pigs like do this do that buy my
[3608.00 - 3613.88] program do this eat this do
[3611.00 - 3616.00] that and darkness is rampant out there
[3613.88 - 3617.76] right now I don't know how people are
[3616.00 - 3620.12] going to survive in 10 years from now as
[3617.76 - 3622.48] it gets worse and worse and
[3620.12 - 3624.12] worse yeah they'll poach things for
[3622.48 - 3626.44] medical medium information that's healed
[3624.12 - 3628.72] people along the way but but they'll mix
[3626.44 - 3630.16] it with crap that won't heal them I
[3628.72 - 3632.88] don't know how anybody's going to get
[3630.16 - 3635.52] better down down the road Natalie says
[3632.88 - 3637.48] the sickest and most narcissistic people
[3635.52 - 3639.68] prey on those trying to better
[3637.48 - 3643.56] themselves we live in a sick world it's
[3639.68 - 3647.52] overwhelming sometimes well
[3643.56 - 3650.52] spoken I could not have said that better
[3647.52 - 3653.16] myself Dr Fawn biohackers are hacking
[3650.52 - 3657.20] People's Health away indeed they're
[3653.16 - 3659.92] pecking People's Health away
[3657.20 - 3661.92] food has an ingrain connection to our
[3659.92 - 3663.96] physical being our physical
[3661.92 - 3666.00] understanding even if we aren't dealing
[3663.96 - 3668.44] with ongoing Health complaints if
[3666.00 - 3670.72] someone is home one evening gets some
[3668.44 - 3672.60] kind of chest pain for a minute and gets
[3670.72 - 3674.76] on the phone with family and friends the
[3672.60 - 3676.04] first thing everyone says is what did
[3674.76 - 3678.48] you eat
[3676.04 - 3682.20] tonight if that person decides to go to
[3678.48 - 3685.00] the ER the doctor asks what did you eat
[3682.20 - 3686.60] tonight the question always comes up
[3685.00 - 3688.28] that's how interconnect ConEd we are
[3686.60 - 3690.44] with food in general and that's how we
[3688.28 - 3691.92] end up living with food fear like we are
[3690.44 - 3694.04] so
[3691.92 - 3696.12] interconnected it's one of those details
[3694.04 - 3698.04] that Patients First Volunteer every time
[3696.12 - 3700.24] they go into the ER to the hospital I
[3698.04 - 3702.56] ate this this tonight I ate this tonight
[3700.24 - 3705.20] I ate this ter appan says when people
[3702.56 - 3709.44] try to frame medical medium yeah frame
[3705.20 - 3712.00] that is the word yes as restrictive and
[3709.44 - 3714.48] fear-mongering the only reason I can eat
[3712.00 - 3716.64] without excruciating pain and fear is
[3714.48 - 3718.36] because of medical medium information
[3716.64 - 3722.64] I was literally starving to death I
[3718.36 - 3722.64] couldn't eat thank you Tara you're the
[3722.76 - 3728.44] best I was sitting at home eating my
[3725.92 - 3731.24] dinner I had this terrible pain in my
[3728.44 - 3733.12] stomach my back my chest my lower
[3731.24 - 3735.36] abdomen I thought I don't know what I
[3733.12 - 3737.60] thought it come to the ER and that's the
[3735.36 - 3740.16] first thing people devou because the
[3737.60 - 3742.64] reason why they devou that information
[3740.16 - 3744.84] is because it's so intertwined to foods
[3742.64 - 3749.56] and eating and our health and foods and
[3744.84 - 3751.44] eating you guys I could go on all day
[3749.56 - 3753.72] long with this
[3751.44 - 3756.40] book that's how much incredible
[3753.72 - 3758.72] information is in this book Brain saver
[3756.40 - 3760.72] Casey shelman over there on YouTube I
[3758.72 - 3764.88] think sometimes it's jealousy and
[3760.72 - 3767.36] insecurity about how they eat
[3764.88 - 3769.40] sometimes projecting their fears on
[3767.36 - 3772.20] what's different but they see the
[3769.40 - 3774.20] healing but they project their fears
[3772.20 - 3776.36] because they don't want to have to think
[3774.20 - 3778.40] about healing and heal
[3776.36 - 3779.92] and what to eat and meaning like they
[3778.40 - 3782.28] think okay
[3779.92 - 3785.04] okay everybody thinks about what to eat
[3782.28 - 3788.08] I don't care who they are
[3785.04 - 3790.44] everyone and everyone is worried about
[3788.08 - 3792.16] their food to some degree no matter what
[3790.44 - 3793.88] because you can't just eat 10 loaves of
[3792.16 - 3796.44] bread with butter on it you'll end up
[3793.88 - 3798.56] with pancreatitis with with a pound of
[3796.44 - 3800.24] butter you can't just eat a whole
[3798.56 - 3802.80] chocolate cake every single night
[3800.24 - 3804.60] because that's not going to help you
[3802.80 - 3808.36] can't do a lot of things you got to be
[3804.60 - 3811.32] careful with Lis free celery 333 over
[3808.36 - 3813.88] there on YouTube I just read an anti-ed
[3811.32 - 3816.76] medium post from someone who was on

[3816.76 - 3822.00] lbs yet she is posting other supplements
[3819.72 - 3824.60] and chocolate and saying to be your own
[3822.00 - 3827.16] health expert and stop with the cult
[3824.60 - 3828.96] first of all you can't even tell you
[3827.16 - 3831.00] can't even trust if that's a real story

[4165.20 - 4169.28] it's healing how demons were kept out of
[4167.84 - 4170.68] that you know cuz the industry you know
[4169.28 - 4174.36] how the movie industry and the TV
[4170.68 - 4175.64] industry is can be really dark right
[4174.36 - 4178.08] like really dark with a lot of
[4175.64 - 4179.84] possession all of that stuff did I talk
[4178.08 - 4183.36] about that before like people just bring
[4179.84 - 4187.08] their demons into that stuff right and
[4183.36 - 4189.00] um and how the film industry can be
[4187.08 - 4192.00] really dark really
[4189.00 - 4192.00] dark
[4192.48 - 4197.32] and the film industry can be really
[4194.80 - 4197.32] really dark
[4197.64 - 4203.72] and Pride and Prejudice okay the not not
[4201.16 - 4207.92] Pride and Prejudice in general just the
[4203.72 - 4210.44] filming of the 1994 1995 Pride and
[4207.92 - 4212.60] Prejudice I talked about on telegram how
[4210.44 - 4214.04] healing it is for the nervous system

[4214.04 - 4217.20] the nervous system so if you need
[4215.88 - 4219.00] something to watch because you're
[4217.20 - 4221.00] sensitive you need something that
[4219.00 - 4223.44] actually has a frequency that can help

[4262.60 - 4266.20] that there's this what happened was
[4264.84 - 4268.88] because I know because Spirit of
[4266.20 - 4272.40] compassion told me

[4272.40 - 4277.32] everything was just kept out of that
[4274.60 - 4279.52] film because in the film industry it's a
[4277.32 - 4283.48] lot of Darkness everything was kept out
[4279.52 - 4285.92] of it and it's very powerful and heals

[4350.68 - 4354.68] tool when they when they filmed that it

[4356.92 - 4362.64] the 1995 Pride and
