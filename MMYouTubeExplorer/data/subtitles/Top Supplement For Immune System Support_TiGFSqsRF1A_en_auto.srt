1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
and helping people

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,960
all the decades one of my most favorite

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,760
things which I call a tool is propolis

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,559
hands down because I get asked a lot of

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,179
questions people will be like Aw what

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,680
about this what about this what about

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,420

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,859
what about this company what about this

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,699
thing here

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:27,480
and propolis by far

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,960
is one of my favorite if you stick

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,220
around I'll do the continuity test too

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,219

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,920
do the continuity continuity test with

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,680
the vemergy propolis it's an entirely

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,780
different frequency entirely different

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,840

so we're talking about propolis which is

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,500
really exciting it's one of my favorite

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,659
tools of all hands down

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,060
and you guys know I work with emerging

33
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,880
you know that I I've endorsed them like

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,040
Full Throttle endorsement because I need

35
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,380
the stuff to stay around because you

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,720
can't find the Purity it doesn't exist

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,040
out there it doesn't you can't find the

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,860
Purity out there

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,420
it's not possible I've been through all

40
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,520
of it out there I've checked everything

41
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,960
out tried everything all of it and the

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,880
Purity is just unmatched and I'll talk

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,880
about that a little bit too but we're

44
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,400
we're talking about propolis and what I

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,979
call is like the power of nature when it

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,860
comes down to propolis it's an entirely

47
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,880
different beast and

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,560
all the years the bad propolises that

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,079
I've had to contend with because it's

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,780
like this you know that it's like it's

51
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,799
like the kind of like love hate thing

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,819
right like propolis is incredible but

53
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,459
all there was out there were crappy bad

54
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,500
low quality propolises with alcohol in

55
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,220
them that's all there was so it's like

56
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,220
here you got this incredible tool like

57
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:26,220
incredible tool but you can't really use

58
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,080
the tool so much because it's so

59
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,200
contaminated

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,760
and has so much junk in it and hidden

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,220
things in it and hit ingredients it's

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,319
got alcohol and you know propylene

63
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,720
glycol it's got all these bad things in

64
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,860
it and it's so it's always been that way

65
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,500
it's like

66
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,680
you know you want to use something

67
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,660
and you know though that you can use it

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,180
but you're not going to get really what

69
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,400
you need out of it because it's not good

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,019
but yeah you need it there's that whole

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,700
thing and the thing is the vermic

72
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,080
propolis it's not like that that's

73
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,300
what's incredible it's alcohol-free

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,160
that's just one little thing about it

75
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,080
all together so you guys are coming on

76
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,420
so we're talking about Pro Bliss that's

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,019
a good time to talk about it too because

78
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,659
propolis immune system

79
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,300
propolis immune system

80
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:18,599
it's like an easy thing to kind of line

81
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,980
up in the mind too it's like immune

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,200

83
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,120

you know that's just easy it's easy to

96
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,120
remember easy to think about the whole

97
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,120
bit

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,440
but I want to talk to you guys because a

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,860
couple of cool things right now beverage

100
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,040
has a sale which is a big deal that's a

101
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,260
big deal so that alone is incredible so

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,140
check it out vimorichi.com these

103
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,000
invictor I Amazon Mary e r g y.com so

104
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,840
that's one thing automatically I want

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,360
you to know about so they have a sale

106
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,980
and that is awesome okay it's the first

107
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,060
thing right there so let's talk about a

108
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,500
couple different things before we go

109
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,100
into propolis right

110
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,460
the four things that I love about the

111
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,199
vemergy company the four incredible

112
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,699
things and you guys probably remember

113
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:33,000
them maybe label requirements allow a

114
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,740
company to have a certain percentage of

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
ingredients they don't have to disclose

116
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,280
on the bottle

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
okay so that's what it's like out there

118
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,300
so label label requirements allow

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,280
companies to have hit ingredients in

120
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,139
their supplements that they don't have

121
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,800
to disclose if it's under a certain

122
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:55,440
percentage Bemidji says no we aren't

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,720
going to do that so that means like for

124
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,960
instance they're propolis it's not going

125
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,080
to have that hidden undisclosed

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,320
percentage of ingredients inside of it

127
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,199
it's not going to exist and I can't find

128
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,900
a company that will stand by that so

129
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:16,139
that's one like drop the mic one

130
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,300
incredible like thing all on its own so

131
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,060
that's one point

132
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,880
another incredible point right no

133
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,360
alcohol no caffeine no vinegar these

134
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,180
things are in supplements out there no

135
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,860
maltodextrin no natural flavors that's a

136
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,560
big one all on its own if you guys ever

137
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,300
heard the medical Bean podcast right I

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,000
have like a podcast episode talking

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,880
about natural flavors and how bad it is

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,460
so they have no natural flavors which is

141
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,919
incredible no soy no gluten right none

142
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,600
of that I mean we're talking Colleen

143
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,039
because there's a lot of supplement

144
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,419
companies out there and I see it all the

145
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,860
time where people will ask me and

146
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,240
they'll be like what about this one what

147
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,380
about that one I go did you read the

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,780
back of it do you read the back of the

149
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,500
label and that's not even the hidden

150
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,419
stuff

151
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,759
and you read the back label and you see

152
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:05,160
it you see natural flavors this flavor

153
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,960
that flavor flavoring you see all of it

154
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,580
there vanilla flavor whatever it is you

155
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,300
just see all the different flavors in

156
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,580
there

157
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,500
and those flavors are bad news and I

158
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,780
talk about that all the time

159
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,220
since the other like Point that's

160
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,539
incredible about the beveraging company

161
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,240
the other one is

162
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,660
a third party independently tested so

163
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Bemidji does third party independently

164
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,560
tested so the reason why I'm going into

165
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,180
this to begin with you guys just got on

166
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,500
here like why is he talking about this

167
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,900
I'll tell you because we're talking

168
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,340
about propolis and it's important to

169
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,020
know what you're dealing with when

170
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,940
you're looking at something pure when

171
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,139
you're looking at Purity right and

172
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,120
that's important especially when it

173
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,639
comes down to immune system and

174
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,699
everything about the immune system so

175
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,639
and then there's the fourth thing that I

176
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,400
love is they choose the highest quality

177
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,680
now I think there's a game out there I'm

178
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:00,780
going to tell you right now okay you can

179
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,940
call a less quality ingredient quality

180
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,000
so some supplement companies can be like

181
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,620
yeah quality tested quality that's what

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,039
they can say and all that but it doesn't

183
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,199
mean they pick the highest level there

184
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,600
was it doesn't mean they went for the

185
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,580
highest level available because price

186
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,560
point it doesn't work out for all the

187
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,639
companies memory G doesn't care they go

188
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,160
to the highest quality level the highest

189
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,900
tier and that's where they head so when

190
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,539
I look at the four different things

191
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,880
it blows my mind right there that

192
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,560
automatically I can't find that anywhere

193
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,800
if there's a company out there I'd love

194
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,380
to talk to them because I guarantee they

195
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,300
won't have those four things because

196
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,520
I've done that I've talked to companies

197
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,759
I've talked to people out there and they

198
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,940
won't go near that so what vimergy holds

199
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,099
and what they Harbor and what they do no

200
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,740
one else will go near or touch and

201
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,479
that's what I call Unbelievable so we're

202
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,400
talking about propolis so when it comes

203
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,699
down to propolis

204
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,800
quality matters for sure because of

205
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,840
things like alcohol that's in propolis

206
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,539
and hidden ingredients and all of that

207
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,979
and so that's a big thing all on its own

208
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,720
by the way if you just guys just got on

209
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,919
here bemidji's having a sale so just

210
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,240
letting you know check it out when you

211
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,919
get a chance

212
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,840
and you guys know I work with emerging

213
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,900
because of those four points I talked

214
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,780
about I endorse them 100 just endorse

215
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,039
them across the the top there so you

216
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,360
guys incredible I'm just waiting for

217
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,560
some of you guys getting on you know

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,000
getting on here we're talking about

219
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,440
propolis

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,320
so when it comes down to problems it's

221
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,300
about immune system always keep that in

222
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,820
mind that's what I love about it and

223
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,339
then antioxidants and the polyphenols

224
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,140
that's another one too so we're going to

225
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,540
go into that a little bit

226
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,640
uh all right so let's hit it so people

227
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,160
are just like quercetin quercetin corset

228
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,899
hit like quercetin is good that's what

229
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,060
you'll hear out there like you you know

230
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,500
I I even today I'll hear like doctors

231
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,839
will just call me up they'd be like hey

232
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,940
I want to ask you about quercetin and so

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,580
a lot of people are into that but then

234
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,640
there's

235
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,980
bioactive living forms of it and that's

236
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,200
propolis and that's what's incredible

237
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,339
and the vimergy one so the Bemidji one

238
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,980
has the bioactive forms of polyphenols

239
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,360
in here over 50 percent are in the

240
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,700
propolis and that's what's incredible

241
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,620
all in its own so a lot of people will

242
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,640
just talk about things like quercetin

243
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,980
but yeah

244
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,980
there's dead quercetin

245
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,200
and it's not bioactive and it's dead and

246
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,180
then there's the ones that aren't and

247
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,300
that's the whole point about propolis it

248
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,620
Harbors these incredible polyphenols so

249
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,880
I wanted to talk about that for a little

250
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,040
bit too

251
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,839
so

252
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
um look you guys this is this is I'll

253
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,800
show you how this even looks and how

254
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,640
incredible it is too

255
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,200
you'll see how golden

256
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,720
it is

257
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,880
and clean and that's what I love about

258
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,740
it right there but I put a little bit in

259
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,120
this

260
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,120
shot glass right here

261
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,320
she's dropping in there it's just the

262
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,360
color is just extraordinary really

263
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,620
Maria says if you sign up for their

264
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,180
email list they will send you

265
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,680
notifications when they have sales

266
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,200
incredible

267
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,260
amazing definitely

268
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,080
so if you look at the color of it too

269
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,480
on its own it's different than anything

270
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,000
I've seen out there

271
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,600
so all the years of the propolis that

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,200
I've used have tried I've seen this is

273
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,260
an entirely different form in my opinion

274
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,019
from anything I've ever seen so you can

275
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:47,040
see the color of it the golden color

276
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,720
right so what the B does the B picks up

277
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,360
the resin

278
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,760
from tree buds

279
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,640
so that's how it starts off

280
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,940
and then the B uses that resin from the

281
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,300
tree Buds and produces propolis which is

282
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,240
like a lacquer it's it's basically a

283
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,820
bond and so then the bee takes it into

284
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,800
the nest I got my little bees right here

285
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,380
that are swinging around the bees take

286
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,760
it into the nest and use it to put the

287
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,200
nest together

288
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,300
and so but there's different qualities

289
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,220
of propolis out there

290
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,660
and so what I love about the beverages

291
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,980
one is the quality and that's what's

292
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,620
incredible about it so I got it right

293
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,120
here and what I usually do is I'll do it

294
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,040
this way right in a shot glass but I

295
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,200
just wanted to show you I also put it

296
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,360
directly in my mouth as well

297
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,440
so what I always recommend like doctors

298
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,480
would be like well what's the best way

299
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,040
to take propolis I'll say well look

300
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,360
you're the you're the doctor you can

301
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,459
tell your patient what to do but you can

302
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,839
put it right in your mouth and that's

303
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,760
fine too

304
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,200
so that's a that's another way to take

305
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,480
it but I have it in a little bit of

306
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,019
water right here in the shot glass I put

307
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,480
a little there just like this and

308
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,680
the thing is is that if you see other

309
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,240
propolis

310
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,640
out there

311
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,480
you'll see it's like Brown real dark

312
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,360
brown yucky sometimes a black color too

313
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,300
it won't be this gold

314
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,820
and you'll see the difference

315
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,260
and that's impurities is what you're

316
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,060
looking at when you see the different

317
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:22,079
colors that like you're looking at

318
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,820
alcohol reacting too as well to propolis

319
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,320
so you're so when you see other

320
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,420
companies and other brands out there and

321
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,680
I've seen this for years the alcohol can

322
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,300
turn it

323
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,540
a color

324
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,940
and so they they're really dark brown it

325
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,519
could be black it could be an entirely

326
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,320
different color and that's something you

327
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,839
won't see here you see the Purity

328
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,760
difference which is incredible all on

329
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,959
its own so

330
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,560
I'm gonna actually have one right now

331
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,899
all right

332
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,880
and what happens is that

333
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,220
I do the continuity test that I talked

334
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,660
about with you guys at one point and I

335
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,180
want to talk more about that another

336
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,339
time too of like what that is and how it

337
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,040
works so what I do

338
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:09,060
I saw hold this in my hand now this

339
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,120
isn't Kinesiology this is using your own

340
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:16,440
free will and no one else's free will

341
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,440
so nobody else's energy is intercepting

342
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,500
and so the other thing is your Korean

343
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,260
continuity to your brain

344
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,180
which is your central nervous system to

345
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,940
the product

346
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:33,660
and that's how it works like it's brain

347
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:37,800
to product and then the intention

348
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,899
right so the intention of your brain

349
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,820
knowing that you're going to be sending

350
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,519
energy

351
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,680
down to what's in your hand and what's

352
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,740
in your hand you're going to send energy

353
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,440
back up the nervous system straight to

354
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,779
the brain so it's the knowing it's the

355
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,060
Free Will you're using to create that

356
00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,060
continuity test so it's both the Free

357
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,399
Will and using your brain

358
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:06,120
as the channel to send it down the

359
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,920
signal to go back and forth so what I do

360
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,360
with supplements and I've held so many

361
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,940
different propolis and I've held them

362
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,240
and done the continuity test right

363
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,560
and you feel like there's a block you

364
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,899
feel blocked

365
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,940
and I've had that so many times

366
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,980
especially if there's alcohol in there

367
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,980
especially if it's a poor quality form

368
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,720
then you feel that like blockage when

369
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,060
you hold it

370
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,680
and over the years I've had so many

371
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,639
propolises

372
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,380
to do that test with and I remember when

373
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,660
vimergy put theirs out and I grabbed it

374
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,760
and I said well see you know it

375
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,800
everything is above board everything's

376
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,980
great let's see what it feels like

377
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,839
and it's an entirely different sensation

378
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,959
and you could do that you can go like

379
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,019
you could be in a quiet space you can do

380
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,660
that in a quiet space relax you can sit

381
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,839
down you don't have to stand up and you

382
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,600
take it and you hold it in hand

383
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,279
and then you make that connection do

384
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,820
that like affirmation you say I'm

385
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,800
holding the propolis in my hand

386
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,260
and then you take your hand your other

387
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,500
hand and you put it right on top of your

388
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,500
head

389
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,920
Lily Collins says is continuity test

390
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,199
like muscle testing no because it's not

391
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,760
muscle testing you're actually not

392
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,440
muscle testing

393
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,440
that's not what you're doing

394
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,959
you're making a continuity frequency

395
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,639
between your brain

396
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,980
and your hand

397
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,620
so it's not muscle tested

398
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,000
muscle testing is somebody else's free

399
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,680
will

400
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,019
actually

401
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,519
being thrown upon you I'm not saying

402
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,079
it's good bad it's whatever anybody

403
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,339
wants to do out there it's fine whatever

404
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,620
they like

405
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,360
but that's different so Kinesiology and

406
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,420
muscle testing which is the same thing

407
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,300
is entirely different than this so this

408
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,880
is continuity test

409
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,060
and there's a big difference so with

410
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,380
this test okay and when you do it with

411
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,959
the probe less

412
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,579
it's on another level which is

413
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,160
incredible like when you do it with

414
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:13,139
products that are amazing it's an

415
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,360
entirely different level when you do it

416
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,920
with like garbage products or products

417
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,420
that have all kinds of bad things in it

418
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,459
and all that like the bad propolis is

419
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,500
out there and you do the continuity test

420
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:24,600
and you can feel the block

421
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,480
it's crazy how you could feel the Block

422
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,579
it's just actually amazing so

423
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,540
how to do a good continuity test and

424
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,980
we're going to do we're going to talk

425
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,779
more about this and go through because

426
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,560
there's so many details about how it's

427
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:39,120
done but holding it knowing you're

428
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,339
holding it

429
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,079
first and foremost

430
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,880
right so it's not like a trick with

431
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:47,100
muscle testing where

432
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,660
you're and I'm not saying this is a

433
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,880
trick or anything like the muscle

434
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,380
testing is a trick but it's like if your

435
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,759
practitioner is doing muscle testing

436
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,880
with you and they put a vial in your

437
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,940
hand beat or even know what it is

438
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,740
right that Consciousness is not your

439
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,779
subconsciousness Consciousness your soul

440
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,939
and the Brain itself to physically brand

441
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,620
physical brain is not connected to

442
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,260
really the vile

443
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,819
because there isn't even a knowing

444
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,740
so when you make that subconscious

445
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,360
conscious soul and physical brain

446
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,819
connection that you know what's in your

447
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,100
hand that's the first and foremost you

448
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,919
know what's in there that's got to be

449
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,000
key all on its own so you're holding on

450
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,299
to that

451
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,100
and you know what's in there okay and

452
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:32,100
then the second thing you have to do is

453
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,660
you're actually creating a connection to

454
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,460
the central nervous system so it's not

455
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,039
muscle testing it's the central nervous

456
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,140
system it's your main group of neurons

457
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,700
and nerves and you're making that

458
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,700
connection

459
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,880
to what's in your hand but to make that

460
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,679
connection you're actually sending a

461
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,679
frequency

462
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,020
right from your brain

463
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,179
through your arm down to the other arm

464
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,000
to what's in your hand and at the same

465
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:02,940
time sending it back and so what happens

466
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,960
is that if it's

467
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:09,780
not Pure or not pure enough or not

468
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,120
strong enough or it has

469
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:15,780
hidden ingredients in it

470
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,020
or it has undisclosed stuff in it or

471
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,120
it's weak or it's a real low quality or

472
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,720
it's got something like alcohol just

473
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,760
cheap junky alcohol in it Whatever It Is

474
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,580
you won't feel

475
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,679
that sensation

476
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,660
you won't feel it at all it'll just get

477
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,860
blocked and just like what is this and

478
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,780
sometimes you'll get even a short

479
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,640
circuit so

480
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,620
what's incredible about this is when I

481
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,940
was like okay well I can't wait to feel

482
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,559
this one

483
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,780
and what you do is you sit down

484
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,660
somewhere in a quiet room

485
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,559
you just relax

486
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,140
and then

487
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:53,520
you give it a few seconds and you know

488
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,720
what the intentions are you know what

489
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
your free will is going to be involved

490
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,640
with doing you're not using somebody

491
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,460
else's Free Will somebody else's Soul

492
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,400
isn't getting in your way somebody

493
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,260
else's intentions or free will is not

494
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,480
getting in your way

495
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,280
so it's not going to get in your way uh

496
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,520
it's not going to get in the way of your

497
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:18,179
subconscious and consciousness

498
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,760
so you're actually it's only you

499
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:22,200
and you alone your intentions your free

500
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,280
will your subconsciousness your

501
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,640
consciousness

502
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,340
your physical brain your soul and what

503
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,740
you are holding

504
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,980
and that completely is different than

505
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,380
any muscle testing any Kinesiology any

506
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,179
kind of testing on that level completely

507
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,600
opposite

508
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,880
it's far from it because that is

509
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,020
somebody else's Free Will being used and

510
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,520
I'm not saying anything good or bad

511
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,580
about that I'm just saying it's somebody

512
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,880
else's free will

513
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:56,160
and a lot of people do it differently

514
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,840
rise of Melton says I did the continuity

515
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,299
test last time you talked about it with

516
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,280
Bemidji products and it felt like a flow

517
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,780
of energy that opened up in my head so I

518
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,640
guess it worked that's what it feels

519
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,799
like it feels like a flow of energy

520
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,539
that's opened up

521
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,059
Claire Dunn says love you Anthony I'm

522
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:14,940
healing every day in every way credible

523
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:17,700
so it's a feeling of having an open

524
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,700
Channel and it could even be just it's

525
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,799
just like a crazy feeling with that like

526
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,419
it's it's incredible and I want to talk

527
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,179
more about it too when I get the chance

528
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,640
like go into details on how to do it so

529
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:32,160
when I do the continuity test

530
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,460
with like the propolis

531
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,280
I also like it what it does is it

532
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:41,160
connects me to where it came from it

533
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,740
connects me to the bees it connects me

534
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,960
to all of it and that's the other

535
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,419
incredible part right there so then you

536
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,640
get all of that energy going through and

537
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,380
you feel it it's really powerful like I

538
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,940
feel it now just by holding this now and

539
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,860
doing this and that's not me sitting in

540
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,080
a quiet room I'm sitting here

541
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,120
uh just trying to like talk about all

542
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,400
this Nicholas says try the continuity

543
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,220
testing on Bemidji and I felt a clean

544
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,080
uplifting Vibe that's the feeling I

545
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,000
tried it on a different brand and was

546
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,740
feeling nothing good that's how it works

547
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,299
like when I take a propolis that's

548
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,799
filled with the alcohol because they all

549
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,960
have alcohol in them even the ones that

550
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,000
say they don't or whatever this

551
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,440
you know there's there's still something

552
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,840
in there that

553
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,460
kind of nobody knows about right

554
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,880
and the the feeling is so much different

555
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,919
it's just it's unbelievable

556
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,500
Miranda says propolis shock therapy

557
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,179
helped me kick my fever with like

558
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,100
incredible you're over there on YouTube

559
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,860
amazing

560
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,179
that's so wonderful so you guys so we're

561
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,460
talking about if you just got on here

562
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,740
we're just chilling out

563
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,780
I got some lemon balm tea but guess how

564
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,159
I've been doing it I've been doing my

565
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,159
lemon balm tea like this

566
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,340
I've been doing my lemon balm tea like

567
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,020
that and I used to do it that way so I

568
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,460
ran out of tea bags because I also like

569
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,919
the lemon balm tea bags right and stuff

570
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,980
but I ran out of them like a while ago

571
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,600
and and then I'm remembering well this

572
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,679
is how I also like to do it which is

573
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
incredible

574
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,880
so what I do is I take water I put a

575
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,400
little honey

576
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,260
in there and then I take

577
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,539
and that continuity test on their lemon

578
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,539
balm is actually insane too actually

579
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:28,200
because lemon balm is like a commentive

580
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:29,880
right calms and nerves and so when you

581
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,640
hold lemon balm and you do the

582
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,900
continuity test

583
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,900
and there it is right there

584
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,799
it's really incredible

585
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,159
if you guys if you guys are really

586
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,480
intuitive and know many of you are and

587
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,159
some of you guys are working on your

588
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,140
intuitive abilities right

589
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,299
if you're really intuitive

590
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,100
and or if you're working on your psychic

591
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:56,280
abilities tell packing abilities right

592
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,919
all of that Clairvoyant abilities and

593
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,260
then you actually focus on that when you

594
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,900
have a pure product like this because I

595
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,640
can't any the products out there they're

596
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,460
not pure like this so but when you have

597
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,100
a pure product like this and you do this

598
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,720
and use your psychic ability

599
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,179
use your intuitive skills right

600
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,280
tutability

601
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:21,000
use your Clairvoyant ability everybody

602
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:24,320
has it whether it's developed or not

603
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,320
telepathic ability rate

604
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,940
and then you try to visualize

605
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
the incredible lemon balm that was used

606
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,360
for this

607
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,039
amazing resource

608
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,179
and you connect and you also do the

609
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,179
continuity test with it

610
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,900
it's actually a meditation so

611
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,520
and you'll feel that if you do the

612
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,740
continuity test

613
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,799
laying down because that's what I'll do

614
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,900
too is I'll take the propolis

615
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,240
and

616
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,240
I'll actually lay down

617
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,700
I'll relax I'll hold it in my hand I'll

618
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,640
put my arms out like this

619
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,220
and I'll just totally chill out

620
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,760
I'll lay on the floor

621
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,559
and then I'll put my hand here

622
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,299
you feel it right when you put your hand

623
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,799
here though all of a sudden boom you got

624
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:17,520
the continuity right going right through

625
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:20,820
but you do it as a meditation

626
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,840
and you can do it for like

627
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:27,539
30 seconds a minute take your hand off

628
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,820
and you're laying down

629
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:31,620
and then you do it again

630
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,740
you do for another 30 seconds for a

631
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,740
minute

632
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,799
it's an incredible meditation I'm

633
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,419
actually smiling because I could feel it

634
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,299
and it just reminds me of when I do it

635
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:44,280
every other day because I do that a lot

636
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:47,220
and the feeling you get

637
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,200
when you're not being blocked by

638
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,880
contaminants and other things and you're

639
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,740
actually getting the continuity go

640
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,220
through like right through rushing back

641
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:59,039
and forth so what happens is that

642
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:03,600
it goes from the brain to the hand

643
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:06,840
to the the pure product and from

644
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,299
the hand to the brain

645
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,039
and then it goes back and forth

646
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:13,679
and it's that

647
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,480
as vacillating back and forth and that's

648
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,280
how it really happens and the feeling

649
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,780
you get

650
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,360
cold white spring you're gonna try it

651
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:23,280
try it and do it as a meditation which

652
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,840
is incredible

653
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,700
and you know and I've had a lot of dead

654
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,120
products in my hand

655
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,960
that I've tried it with and you feel the

656
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,880
block

657
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,340
you even feel like whoa and you feel

658
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,740
like you gotta let go you feel like you

659
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,260
have to let go a friend of mine brought

660
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,299
some other like company and said well

661
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,159
what about this try this do the

662
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:46,559
continuity test on this I said all right

663
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,240
well let me lay down and I'll do it that

664
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,480
way and

665
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,980
I purposely didn't look at what was in

666
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,539
the ingredient list

667
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,640
that my friend actually brought the

668
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:58,860
supplement it wasn't very G was another

669
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,080
company and I purposely didn't look at

670
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,299
what was in the ingredient list I didn't

671
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,659
want to be biased

672
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:08,580
I want it to just be completely ignorant

673
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:10,980
to what was in the list of the

674
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:14,460
supplement brand

675
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,840
and I basically said I'm going to go by

676
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,220
your word I said to my friend my friend

677
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,260
said it's supposed to be the best

678
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,640
quality and the best Fury I said I'll go

679
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,700
by your word

680
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,460
I grabbed it I laid down I did the

681
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,559
continuity test I felt it he says what's

682
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,480
wrong with you I said what do you mean

683
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,760
what's wrong with me

684
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,260
I

685
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,179
feel that this is just totally blocked

686
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,340
and then I looked at it and it had all

687
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,659
this garbage in it on top of it people

688
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,240
wouldn't think it's garbage but it was

689
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,580
garbage Natasha says we did all this for

690
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,860
my eldest who just had the same eye

691
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,659
infection and the eye infection only

692
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,720
lasted three days

693
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,580
I love as a mom I don't need to worry

694
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,279
about anything hidden in Bemidji

695
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,799
products Natasha that's the incredible

696
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,419
thing it's like it's why I endorse them

697
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,120
because it's like

698
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,059
I don't want them to ever stop I worry

699
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,400
about that right because it's like it's

700
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,860
like you worry about that with them I

701
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,299
don't have to worry but I also want them

702
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,279
not to not to like create it

703
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,919
they're creating it for people but if

704
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,659
people don't know how and how pure it is

705
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,340
I don't want it to disappear is what I'm

706
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,500
trying to say I don't want it to

707
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,960
disappear I want them to get the support

708
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,140
they need and that's what I want

709
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,260
you know it means it means so much

710
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,240
so um but that's what the whole point

711
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,880
I'm trying to say is they don't have any

712
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,740
of the undisclosed hidden ingredients

713
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,740
you could have a certain percent of

714
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,419
undisclosed hidden ingredients label

715
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:48,840
requirements let the companies do that

716
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:52,080
where they they have a certain amount of

717
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:55,500
percentage of ingredients that you will

718
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,559
never know about ever and then the

719
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,020
quality tier they chose from is the

720
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,700
lower quality so it's price point you

721
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,260
guys know about that like if you guys

722
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,940
know about business right a lot of you

723
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,600
guys know about business right

724
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:12,240
that the the price point thing

725
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,679
so if you started a supplement company

726
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,500
tomorrow

727
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,240
and you went to go re like find

728
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,120
resources

729
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,440
and be like okay I'm gonna Source a good

730
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,480
whatever

731
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,760
you're gonna see where

732
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,919
they give you like they Source out the

733
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,600
cheapest of everything

734
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,240
and that's what you just automatically

735
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,799
go to you're like okay price point you

736
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,240
go with the cheapest you go with the

737
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,500
lowest quality even if you're allowed to

738
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,360
say it's quality

739
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,820
vermergy doesn't do that they don't care

740
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,580
about the price point they just say you

741
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,500
know what it's about people and it's

742
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:50,039
about their bodies

743
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,380
and so they go for the highest the

744
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:54,779
highest it's like that they can find

745
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,700
that they can find and if there's a

746
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:58,860
higher they'll find it and that's it the

747
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,240
highest and that's they go for and

748
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,820
that's the whole thing you guys saw how

749
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,620
I did the lemon balm right

750
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,620
I love it that way like seriously

751
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,700
so I've been doing this instead of the

752
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,340
the tea

753
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,600
so I'll do the vermergy Limbaugh if you

754
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,659
guys don't know the company it's Visa

755
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,000
Victor i m is Mary e r g y.com code of

756
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,200
energy.com we have a sale on too I just

757
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,760
thought I'd let you guys know about the

758
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,419
sale as well

759
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,419
so

760
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:35,700
now you can do another continuity test

761
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:39,240
now the brain to hand one

762
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,940
is like a really really powerful one the

763
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,399
other one is

764
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:47,159
hand to hand so you take a bottle of the

765
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,960
same product right

766
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,380
so

767
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,659
I got two bottles of propolis right here

768
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,600
so you take the bottle of the same

769
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:00,539
product

770
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,299
and you hold them in both hands

771
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:04,980
and you get continuity from one hand to

772
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:07,440
the other hand right

773
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,760
that's another one you can do too but

774
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,760
the only difference with that one

775
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:16,559
okay the only difference with that one

776
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,760
is you want to start out by having both

777
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,559
hands

778
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,020
on top of the place where your

779
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,240
subconscious your consciousness

780
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,779
your physical brain and your soul is so

781
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,880
you want to have both hands on top

782
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:32,100
and you can relax you can lay down and

783
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,080
then the after you have it on top for a

784
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,520
little while and I'll go into details

785
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,399
more on this in the future but you go

786
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,760
then you grab on to the products and you

787
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,980
do a continuity test between both

788
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,320
and that's another one you can do

789
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,940
and that one might be that might one

790
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,399
might be more you might like that one

791
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,799
better my favorite that Spirit of

792
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,600
compassion taught me and and I didn't

793
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,960
get these from anywhere it's not like

794
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,000
anybody ever you know doing the

795
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,740
continuity test and how it works and how

796
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,179
everything that's actually Spirit of

797
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,980
compassion it's for years and years that

798
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:06,659
I've that have used

799
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,820
but my favorite is

800
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:11,059
oh and if you're whatever hand you want

801
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,059
to do

802
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,120
and they'll bring a smile to your face

803
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,200
too because

804
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,200
you feel it

805
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,240
it's a sensation and it's like a

806
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:28,140
relaxing sensation but yet it's charged

807
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,779
at the same time because you feel like

808
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,880
it's like you're floating it's like a

809
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:35,580
floaty feeling too

810
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,020
it's just incredible so that's a

811
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,200
continuity test and that's something

812
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,840
that I've lived by for most of my life

813
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,700
and that I love and there's so many

814
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,760
tools that I've gotten from Spirit of

815
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,860
compassion that it there's only so many

816
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,020
I mean I I try to give you guys so many

817
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,120
tools all I can and as much as I can you

818
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,100
guys know I do that so this is one of

819
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,659
the tools that I love

820
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,559
so anyway when it comes to out of

821
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:03,779
propolis like I always teach people that

822
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,360
that ask me and stuff it's like immune

823
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:08,600
system it's one of the things I love

824
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,520
antioxidants is another one now

825
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,600
antioxidants are different in different

826
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,279
things

827
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,520
so something like

828
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:19,380
one antioxidant from something like if

829
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,320
if someone says well coffee has an

830
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,779
antioxidant right well

831
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,860
the bad outweighs the good in that

832
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:29,039
situation

833
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:32,059
right all the caffeine

834
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:36,299
stresses out the adrenals

835
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:38,760
adrenaline is like gasoline corrosive

836
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:41,580
so whatever little antioxidant that they

837
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,580
discover in a coffee bean

838
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:47,039
really can't compete with how much is

839
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,960
going wrong when you're on a lot of

840
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,539
caffeine

841
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,380
it's not something you'd like to know

842
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:58,140
and so you know when it comes down to it

843
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,640
there's but their antioxidants that are

844
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,799
in Pro that are in propolis are

845
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,779
different which is a whole other thing

846
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:05,580
that I was talking about before you guys

847
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:07,380
just want to give you a rundown

848
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,919
on what's happening with the propolis

849
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:13,440
and remember she's on sale right now

850
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,340
I'm just reading your comments too

851
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,140
um

852
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,140
I'm gonna have some more lemon balm tea

853
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:22,279
without the tea bag which is incredible

854
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,140
on its own

855
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,539
so try the continuity test when you

856
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,799
actually get a chance and see how it

857
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,480
feels

858
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,700
it's really

859
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,500
a powerful way to connect

860
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,820
and if you're somebody that's like using

861
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,559
your intuition

862
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,480
you're building up all your different

863
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,539
internal skills that you have it's a

864
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,519
whole nother thing to all of them so

865
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:47,480
anyway guys

866
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,480
I will see you again
