[9.04 - 15.76] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 18.88] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.76 - 20.88] medium hello I'm Anthony William you're
[18.88 - 23.20] listening to the medical medium radio
[20.88 - 25.36] show where each week I talk about the
[23.20 - 27.60] most advanced healing
[25.36 - 29.68] information and secrets about health
[27.60 - 31.88] much of which is not found anywhere else
[29.68 - 34.52] and decades ahead of what's out there
[31.88 - 36.76] now so decades ahead of everything
[34.52 - 38.48] science and research doesn't know what's
[36.76 - 40.68] going on in chronic illness I'm just
[38.48 - 43.96] going to say it plain and simple just so
[40.68 - 46.48] you know I know that sounds strange but
[43.96 - 47.96] if someone's sick and they're going to
[46.48 - 49.00] doctor to doctor and they're going to
[47.96 - 50.36] look through everything and they're
[49.00 - 51.84] going everywhere in any place and
[50.36 - 53.60] they're trying everything and they can't
[51.84 - 55.12] get answers for their anxiety they can't
[53.60 - 56.84] get answers for anything they can't get
[55.12 - 58.44] answers for the depression cuz nobody
[56.84 - 60.36] knows what's what's going on with
[58.44 - 62.68] depression same thing with with anything
[60.36 - 64.12] even basic hotus thyroiditis everything
[62.68 - 65.96] aches and pains all kinds of different
[64.12 - 70.04] neurological problems people get fatigue
[65.96 - 71.68] and all that there's no real answers a
[70.04 - 73.80] lot of theory the body's attacking
[71.68 - 76.88] itself it's your genes so forth and so
[73.80 - 79.64] on and so on so on this show clears up
[76.88 - 81.84] everything for so much and for so many
[79.64 - 83.68] people for a reason it's the source that
[81.84 - 86.92] was given to me since Age
[83.68 - 89.56] 4 that allows me to have information
[86.92 - 90.76] that's free information that's free from
[89.56 - 92.60] everything
[90.76 - 94.40] free from the whole thing this is the
[92.60 - 96.04] only show anywhere that where the
[94.40 - 97.72] information here doesn't come from
[96.04 - 99.76] medical interest groups medical funding
[97.72 - 101.88] with strings attached Bots research
[99.76 - 103.80] lobbyist internal Kickbacks persuaded
[101.88 - 105.56] belief systems private panel of
[103.80 - 107.44] influencers and health field payoffs in
[105.56 - 110.44] the system out there in
[107.44 - 112.80] alternative and conventional medicine
[110.44 - 115.92] and trendy traps we avoid trendy traps
[112.80 - 119.84] so in alternative medicine so people
[115.92 - 121.44] really get better so the belief systems
[119.84 - 123.40] aren't all clog so everybody's not
[121.44 - 125.08] clogged up with a belief system and they
[123.40 - 126.68] get trapped and they're afraid of doing
[125.08 - 127.96] so they're afraid of taking zinc cuz
[126.68 - 130.56] they think it's going to deplete their
[127.96 - 132.16] copper Meanwhile we're so depleted in
[130.56 - 134.88] zinc it's the one thing to stop the
[132.16 - 136.76] virus is causing people to get sick
[134.88 - 138.68] everywhere sickness that's rampant
[136.76 - 142.44] chronic illness is rising Fast and
[138.68 - 144.80] Furious it's rising like never before

[203.44 - 210.24] is about lymphatic the lymphatic system
[207.44 - 211.88] it's all about the lymphatic system and
[210.24 - 213.52] you know this is this is an interesting
[211.88 - 215.00] show because what do people know about
[213.52 - 217.00] the lymphatic system what do we even
[215.00 - 218.72] know I mean we know about mucus we know
[217.00 - 220.20] they lymphatic system gets clogged we
[218.72 - 221.64] know that our white blood cells that are
[220.20 - 223.32] involved with the lymphatic system our
[221.64 - 225.44] immune system is involved with the
[223.32 - 227.24] lymphatic system we know we get lymph
[225.44 - 228.68] nodes we know we get swollen glands we
[227.24 - 230.44] know a lot of things out there but what
[228.68 - 231.76] do we really know and what do we know is
[230.44 - 233.32] causing it all what do we know the
[231.76 - 235.68] lymphatic system is really doing what do
[233.32 - 238.00] we know about any of it and that's what
[235.68 - 241.12] we're exploring today we're going to air
[238.00 - 243.68] it all out so that you become an expert

[246.84 - 250.44] healthier and that's what we're doing
[248.92 - 253.28] today so it's an important show it
[250.44 - 255.52] really is so fasten your seat bels get
[253.28 - 257.60] ready let's go for a ride let's do it
[255.52 - 260.00] let's go for a ride get your herbal tea
[257.60 - 260.84] get whatever you need chill out relax
[260.00 - 263.32] we're going to just you know it's a
[260.84 - 266.24] low-key show I'm not going to be I'm not
[263.32 - 269.32] going to be you know throwing throwing
[266.24 - 272.12] rocks and throwing darts and and you
[269.32 - 273.56] know the whole bit I realize I realize
[272.12 - 275.48] I'm a little tough on research and
[273.56 - 278.00] science I'm a little tough on where we
[275.48 - 279.96] stand but someone's got to stick up for
[278.00 - 281.60] the doctors because that's what I'm
[279.96 - 283.20] basically doing is sticking up for the
[281.60 - 285.68] doctors because the doctors don't get
[283.20 - 288.04] handed what they need they don't get
[285.68 - 290.32] handed what they need in chronic illness
[288.04 - 291.68] in chronic illness they just don't so
[290.32 - 293.36] really what I'm doing is I'm fighting
[291.68 - 294.92] for them I'm fighting for you I'm
[293.36 - 297.08] fighting for them because doctors get
[294.92 - 299.04] sick too practitioners get sick too
[297.08 - 300.52] doctors healers get sick too they all
[299.04 - 302.04] get sick with mystery illnesses no
[300.52 - 304.04] matter if there's a diagnosis or a name
[302.04 - 306.20] on it or anything like that they get
[304.04 - 308.96] sick so let's get into the lymphatic
[306.20 - 311.36] system that's it let's get into that the
[308.96 - 313.68] lymphatic system so do you have a
[311.36 - 317.16] lymphatic system yes you do of course
[313.68 - 320.92] you do yep you you got one you better
[317.16 - 323.96] believe it and it runs through
[320.92 - 327.16] practically your entire body practically
[323.96 - 330.96] your entire body it's it's it's almost
[327.16 - 333.80] everywhere it's not every single spot
[330.96 - 337.28] but it's darn close it I mean you got
[333.80 - 341.12] your arms your arms your legs of
[337.28 - 345.00] course um your abdomen all around your
[341.12 - 347.72] colon all around your intestinal tract
[345.00 - 350.40] around your stomach around your
[347.72 - 353.08] pancreas okay around your
[350.40 - 357.32] liver around your
[353.08 - 360.08] thyroid your neck up around your brain
[357.32 - 361.84] in certain areas
[360.08 - 364.96] all in the lower part of the neck going
[361.84 - 367.80] up jaw right in the back of your head in
[364.96 - 370.84] the back of your head okay there's
[367.80 - 374.08] lymphatic vessels in all kinds of places
[370.84 - 376.48] these strings are literally practically
[374.08 - 378.36] everywhere in our body what do they do
[376.48 - 381.48] what are they even for well science of
[378.36 - 384.28] research knows they know the immune
[381.48 - 386.64] systems involved lymphocytes you know
[384.28 - 389.96] lymphatic white blood cells they're
[386.64 - 391.52] involved so that's known out there they
[389.96 - 394.68] also know when you get a swollen gland
[391.52 - 397.28] or a swollen node they want to poke it
[394.68 - 398.92] they want to jab it they want to jab it
[397.28 - 401.20] looking for cancerous cells they want to
[398.92 - 403.76] jab it looking for things that's
[401.20 - 407.04] something they do often when someone has
[403.76 - 410.36] a node um in the old days and I don't
[407.04 - 412.32] mean too far old I mean 20 years ago 20
[410.36 - 413.64] years ago 20 years ago is nothing 20
[412.32 - 417.04] years ago is nothing I know when you're
[413.64 - 420.68] 20 years old when you're only 20 years
[417.04 - 423.40] of age or 19 years of age age or 21
[420.68 - 426.56] years of age or 24 years of age 20 years
[423.40 - 429.80] ago is a lifetime feels like a lifetime
[426.56 - 432.08] that feels like ancient history but it's
[429.80 - 436.08] nothing to people who get older so when
[432.08 - 437.80] you're 40 20 years ago look that they
[436.08 - 439.96] all of a sudden when you're 40 20 years
[437.80 - 442.24] ago is really like oh that was it 20
[439.96 - 444.00] years ago 15 20 years ago what they used
[442.24 - 447.16] to do and 25 years ago what they used to
[444.00 - 449.08] do is they used to try to remove them
[447.16 - 450.72] they used to cut people open so if
[449.08 - 452.44] you're child and you go to the doctor
[450.72 - 454.44] and you got some swollen glands and they
[452.44 - 455.76] kind of don't know what it is and they
[454.44 - 458.00] don't know what's going on they do some
[455.76 - 461.56] blood work your your rbcs your white
[458.00 - 463.84] count look pretty good they say Hey you
[461.56 - 466.60] know usually doctors are like we can try
[463.84 - 467.88] to remove one and then we'll take a look
[466.60 - 469.64] at it we'll try to remove it and take a
[467.88 - 472.72] look at it or we'll just take it out
[469.64 - 474.76] that was a bad that was a bad technique
[472.72 - 477.24] and they still kind of offer it some
[474.76 - 480.20] some people just kind offer it now it's
[477.24 - 481.60] not a good thing but that's you know
[480.20 - 485.24] that's kind of where we are instead of
[481.60 - 488.24] realizing what's really going on now the
[485.24 - 492.08] lymphatic the lymphatic system is
[488.24 - 495.68] designed is designed to literally attack
[492.08 - 497.40] and go after pathogens that's what it's
[495.68 - 500.08] designed for it's one of its great
[497.40 - 503.64] designs protecting you from viral
[500.08 - 506.40] Invasion protecting you from bacterial
[503.64 - 508.52] Invasion that's one whole Avenue the
[506.40 - 511.12] lymphatic system is all rigged up for
[508.52 - 513.40] another Avenue another another whole
[511.12 - 515.40] thing that the lymphatic system does is
[513.40 - 518.08] is it pushes out the
[515.40 - 521.76] garbage so it gathers and pushes and
[518.08 - 524.16] squeezes out the garbage a lot of toxins
[521.76 - 526.32] different kinds of toxins a lot of
[524.16 - 529.00] particles a lot of different what I call
[526.32 - 531.72] troublemakers that get all into the to
[529.00 - 534.52] the the the plumbing that get all into
[531.72 - 537.00] the plumbing of the body and so this is
[534.52 - 540.44] so the lymphatic system plays a big role
[537.00 - 542.16] with with actually trapping trapping
[540.44 - 543.56] what you know basically just look at
[542.16 - 544.68] your house if your house is filled with
[543.56 - 546.36] dust if it's filled with different
[544.68 - 548.04] particles if it's filled with you know
[546.36 - 550.76] termite spray if it's filled with all
[548.04 - 552.92] kinds of different things ant spray if
[550.76 - 554.36] it's filled with whatever you know
[552.92 - 556.80] carpet cleaning
[554.36 - 559.32] chemicals you know sheetrock dust
[556.80 - 561.44] whatever your house is filled with you
[559.32 - 566.32] know even mold whatever your house is
[561.44 - 570.00] filled with the lymphatic system's job
[566.32 - 571.96] is to actually do something about it see
[570.00 - 573.56] that's what it's like so it's like when
[571.96 - 575.36] your body gets filled with all that
[573.56 - 576.56] stuff just like a house and your body
[575.36 - 580.08] gets filled with all those different
[576.56 - 581.76] things I just mentioned what happens is
[580.08 - 583.84] something you know somebody has to do
[581.76 - 586.36] something about it inside the body and
[583.84 - 589.92] the lymphatic system is one of these
[586.36 - 592.24] things but the lymphatic system is an
[589.92 - 596.96] organ's best
[592.24 - 599.56] friend and a specific organ at indeed is
[596.96 - 601.96] its best friend can you guess what organ
[599.56 - 604.08] that is which organ did you say the
[601.96 - 606.16] pancreas nope you're wrong no pancreas
[604.08 - 609.16] sorry to say that no if you said the
[606.16 - 610.96] pancreas did you say the thyroid no no
[609.16 - 612.52] and you know lymphatic system isn't the
[610.96 - 614.64] thyroids best friend I mean it they're
[612.52 - 617.48] good friends don't get me wrong and the
[614.64 - 619.60] pancreas is good friends too um the
[617.48 - 622.48] kidneys you say the kidneys whoa you
[619.60 - 625.52] said the kidneys Y no that's wrong that
[622.48 - 628.36] one's wrong too are we we're how about
[625.52 - 631.12] the colon and intestinal tract that
[628.36 - 633.92] seems like like the
[631.12 - 637.44] lymphatic uh systems best friend doesn't
[633.92 - 639.20] it the colon intestinal track come on
[637.44 - 641.36] all the gut health people out there
[639.20 - 643.36] would think it's its best friend maybe
[641.36 - 646.12] we hit it on the nose right there did
[643.36 - 648.08] you guess that one well that's wrong too
[646.12 - 650.24] that's wrong too that one that's
[648.08 - 653.40] terrible terrible that I'm doing this I
[650.24 - 656.20] shouldn't be playing this game okay what
[653.40 - 660.08] else is it the brain's best
[656.20 - 662.36] friend yeah it's got to be the brain's
[660.08 - 666.40] best friend huh of course of course
[662.36 - 668.28] lymphatic system no it's not I won't
[666.40 - 671.36] torture you any longer it's the liver's
[668.28 - 674.68] best friend it is the liver it's the
[671.36 - 677.32] liver's best friend the lymphatic system
[674.68 - 680.04] because the liver is the filter the main
[677.32 - 682.12] filter the big filter the big solid
[680.04 - 684.36] filter for all that garbage I was
[682.12 - 686.44] talking about all those different
[684.36 - 689.32] troublemakers and poisons we get into
[686.44 - 691.64] the ones we inherited like the DDT
[689.32 - 693.44] pesticides herbicides fungicides the
[691.64 - 695.28] fungicides we get when we go into a
[693.44 - 696.84] store a department store or we order
[695.28 - 699.60] online a new
[696.84 - 701.00] shirt and the new shirt is saturated
[699.60 - 704.60] with the fungicide because they're all
[701.00 - 708.20] sprayed all new clothing except for like
[704.60 - 710.08] special te organic cotton specialty
[708.20 - 712.48] organic cotton clothing or something
[710.08 - 714.16] from a you know like a specialty maker
[712.48 - 716.44] or something like that they won't have
[714.16 - 719.40] the fungicide on there but all close all
[716.44 - 721.84] close now they're sprayed they're hos
[719.40 - 723.76] down with the fungicide the fungicide
[721.84 - 726.64] companies which are the pesticide
[723.76 - 729.92] companies seem to have sold all
[726.64 - 731.52] manufacturing Goods a bill of goods you
[729.92 - 733.88] know that they've gotten in there they
[731.52 - 736.92] it never used to be like that the
[733.88 - 738.84] fungicide is one of the worst chemicals
[736.92 - 741.76] for the body because it gets it really
[738.84 - 744.72] gets into liver hampers it hurts it and
[741.76 - 747.16] therefore what does it hurt what do all
[744.72 - 749.56] these toxins hurt when the liver is
[747.16 - 751.36] hurting the lymphatic system
[749.56 - 753.56] it hurts the lymphatic system that's
[751.36 - 755.16] what it does so we have all these
[753.56 - 758.20] poisons everywhere it's dropping out of
[755.16 - 759.76] the sky out of planes you name it I'm
[758.20 - 761.96] I'm not just talking about planes with
[759.76 - 763.56] jet fuel too that's a whole another
[761.96 - 766.60] thing I'm talking about planes without
[763.56 - 768.72] passengers on them specifically to drop
[766.60 - 770.60] stuff out of them you can you can you
[768.72 - 773.20] know you wouldn't believe what's going
[770.60 - 775.68] on so all this stuff is coming out of
[773.20 - 777.08] the sky we got stuff spewing out of cars
[775.68 - 778.52] which isn't the worst thing in the world
[777.08 - 779.60] compared to what we're up against all
[778.52 - 782.00] the time
[779.60 - 785.60] but we got poisons Galore everywhere we
[782.00 - 788.48] got solvents we got you got gasoline at
[785.60 - 789.68] the gas pumps see in the old days and
[788.48 - 791.28] this is all important because we're
[789.68 - 792.44] talking about toxins for a reason this
[791.28 - 794.80] is all important and then we're going to
[792.44 - 798.16] get into some other stuff in the old
[794.80 - 802.36] days it was only the gas attendant that
[798.16 - 804.28] got the gasoline on her or him it was
[802.36 - 806.36] only the gas attendee or the gas
[804.28 - 808.40] attendant which which you know the the
[806.36 - 811.40] guy or the gal that pumped gas at the
[808.40 - 814.88] gas patient pumping gas yourself years
[811.40 - 817.20] ago was an anomaly it was it was it was
[814.88 - 819.36] rare it was rare it was like the
[817.20 - 821.92] Sasquatch sightings it's like the yeti
[819.36 - 824.60] sightings it's rare to catch a yeting
[821.92 - 826.76] Yeti sighting it's it's that you know so
[824.60 - 830.12] it's like it's that kind of deal you're
[826.76 - 832.24] at the gas pump now we're at the gas
[830.12 - 834.40] pump in the old days it was just a gas
[832.24 - 837.04] station people they lived their life in
[834.40 - 839.12] gasoline they lived it every day and
[837.04 - 841.32] that's what they did for a living and
[839.12 - 842.92] there's still full serve in States and
[841.32 - 844.52] there's full serve in different states
[842.92 - 846.88] and there's full serve in different
[844.52 - 850.04] places some gu some some states that
[846.88 - 852.32] aren't full serve still offer it at some
[850.04 - 853.96] places for like elderly people and stuff
[852.32 - 856.08] like that so it's still out there but
[853.96 - 857.68] it's it's it's honestly it's hard to
[856.08 - 861.76] find unless you're in a state that does
[857.68 - 864.12] full serve so the bottom line is the
[861.76 - 866.04] exposure that gas station people would
[864.12 - 867.92] get was just unbelievable they were
[866.04 - 869.32] breathing it in all day long you got the
[867.92 - 872.24] gas pumping into into the car you're
[869.32 - 875.20] breathing in in all day long well now we
[872.24 - 877.64] breathing in that never happened in
[875.20 - 879.48] before our children are breathing it in
[877.64 - 880.88] so our 16-year-old daughters are going
[879.48 - 882.52] down to that they're pumping their own
[880.88 - 884.36] gas that's because that's what we have
[882.52 - 886.00] to do now so they're pumping their own
[884.36 - 887.96] gas and they're literally being exposed
[886.00 - 890.76] to gas fume something that never
[887.96 - 892.96] happened in history never happened in
[890.76 - 895.32] history before when gasoline in the oil
[892.96 - 897.96] industry was created back in the early
[895.32 - 899.88] 1900s late 1800s and fuel was being
[897.96 - 902.08] processed and the plants were being
[899.88 - 903.84] built and all that was happening and
[902.08 - 906.80] then we had engines running and then by
[903.84 - 908.52] the 1905 the first cars or whatever I I
[906.80 - 910.40] I don't have the year straight don't
[908.52 - 911.72] quote me on those as the you know that
[910.40 - 913.80] kind of stuff because I don't know what
[911.72 - 915.64] year the first car I forgot but the
[913.80 - 920.28] bottom line is you know and then the
[915.64 - 923.84] cars 19 the 1900s early 1900s 1920s all
[920.28 - 928.92] those years was Full Service gasoline
[923.84 - 931.32] every decade 1930 1940 1950 1960 197 and
[928.92 - 933.84] it went this it's changed now so our
[931.32 - 935.88] 16-year-old daughters are exposing
[933.84 - 938.40] themselves to gasoline that's what's
[935.88 - 940.76] happening now never happened before in
[938.40 - 943.40] history I'm just telling you right now
[940.76 - 945.52] our 16-year-old sons are actually
[943.40 - 947.36] exposing themselves to gasoline and we
[945.52 - 949.68] don't even think about it at all or
[947.36 - 952.24] think anything about it whatsoever on
[949.68 - 954.04] any level and of course our kids aren't
[952.24 - 955.96] eating that good so that it's not like
[954.04 - 958.24] they're eating they're drinking celery
[955.96 - 959.84] juice it's not like it's not like we're
[958.24 - 961.64] teaching our kids in the schools the
[959.84 - 963.60] schools are teaching our kids how to eat
[961.64 - 965.40] right no well that right now the schools
[963.60 - 966.68] are saying stay high protein and low
[965.40 - 969.16] carb that's what they're doing that's
[966.68 - 970.24] not the answer either because when it
[969.16 - 972.24] comes down to your liver and your
[970.24 - 974.28] lymphatic system you need the right
[972.24 - 975.60] antioxidants from Foods lots of fruits
[974.28 - 978.84] and vegetables you need those
[975.60 - 980.04] antioxidants to counter the amount of
[978.84 - 982.68] poison
[980.04 - 984.76] toxins that and and that are actually
[982.68 - 987.12] getting into our bodies now than ever
[984.76 - 988.88] before and going to the pizza place is
[987.12 - 990.40] not going to cover it so so when our
[988.88 - 992.20] kids are filling their gas tank and then
[990.40 - 995.60] going to get a cheeseburger it's it's
[992.20 - 998.08] all great and all and but it's not as
[995.60 - 1001.24] good as we need it to be is what I'm
[998.08 - 1003.08] saying so at a young age now we're
[1001.24 - 1005.24] getting exposed to more toxins than ever
[1003.08 - 1006.96] before we're inheriting toxins from our
[1005.24 - 1008.60] family members going all the way back
[1006.96 - 1011.64] from generation to generation from
[1008.60 - 1013.72] Mercury going all the way back from DDT
[1011.64 - 1015.80] during the old DDT days I talk about
[1013.72 - 1017.24] this in life-changing foods you should
[1015.80 - 1019.20] pick up life-changing Foods if you
[1017.24 - 1020.48] haven't it's it's such like oh my God
[1019.20 - 1021.92] it's one of my favorite books you know I
[1020.48 - 1024.64] don't know which book is my favorite out
[1021.92 - 1026.08] of the three books medical medium for
[1024.64 - 1027.64] the first book and then life-changing
[1026.08 - 1029.36] foods and thyroid healing I don't know
[1027.64 - 1030.88] which one's my favorite I I keep on
[1029.36 - 1032.44] going back and forth I'm like no this
[1030.88 - 1035.52] one's my favorite no this one's my
[1032.44 - 1037.12] favorite now this one's my favorite
[1035.52 - 1040.40] anyway
[1037.12 - 1042.00] anyway so we we're getting exposed to a
[1040.40 - 1043.64] tremendous amount of toxins why is it
[1042.00 - 1045.40] import important to talk about it today
[1043.64 - 1049.00] because it's our lymphatic system it's
[1045.40 - 1053.00] the very tool that's protecting us from
[1049.00 - 1054.32] that and its best friend is the liver
[1053.00 - 1056.72] and the liver's best friend is the
[1054.32 - 1059.52] lymphatic system this is really
[1056.72 - 1061.76] important to know so we're getting
[1059.52 - 1063.64] Exposed on every level with every
[1061.76 - 1065.96] chemical agent possible that's being
[1063.64 - 1068.16] created at a factories every new new
[1065.96 - 1070.40] chemical created every day and we're
[1068.16 - 1072.60] getting exposed bottom line from our dry
[1070.40 - 1075.44] cleaners all the way to perfumes and
[1072.60 - 1078.20] colog that are highly toxic all the way
[1075.44 - 1080.52] from plugin air fresheners by the way
[1078.20 - 1083.52] the air freshener world that should be
[1080.52 - 1086.08] banned and outlawed if the world worked
[1083.52 - 1087.56] in the right way meaning in the way of
[1086.08 - 1089.08] looking out for people with chronic
[1087.56 - 1091.16] illness looking out for people with
[1089.08 - 1093.76] disease looking out for people to even
[1091.16 - 1096.64] healthy people getting anything the
[1093.76 - 1099.36] freshener world would disappear the air
[1096.64 - 1101.20] freshener world that would disappear
[1099.36 - 1103.04] that's actually one of the worst of them
[1101.20 - 1107.32] for the liver lymphatic system for our
[1103.04 - 1110.64] bodies so we're exposed to this nonstop
[1107.32 - 1112.48] nonstop and um and so what do we do
[1110.64 - 1115.68] about it if we can't do anything about
[1112.48 - 1118.00] what we're exposed to when we walk into
[1115.68 - 1119.56] the mall or wherever we go people aren't
[1118.00 - 1121.72] going to the malls that much anyway
[1119.56 - 1124.68] these days but we still get exposed
[1121.72 - 1126.96] everywhere else what the bottom line is
[1124.68 - 1129.36] whatever we're exposed we can't do
[1126.96 - 1131.96] anything about that in in a lot of ways
[1129.36 - 1134.32] except what we can control in our own in
[1131.96 - 1136.40] personal or own personal
[1134.32 - 1138.56] environment you know you better believe
[1136.40 - 1140.52] you won't see me ordering or going to
[1138.56 - 1142.60] the store and grabbing those plug-in air
[1140.52 - 1144.64] fresheners you better believe you won't
[1142.60 - 1146.36] be seeing me do that and plug that in my
[1144.64 - 1148.04] house and ruin it or plug that in my
[1146.36 - 1150.44] apartment plug that into my car you
[1148.04 - 1153.44] wouldn't believe that's not going to
[1150.44 - 1155.16] happen so we can control those things
[1153.44 - 1157.36] you can throw those out you can unplug
[1155.16 - 1158.96] those and throw those out you can
[1157.36 - 1162.36] control those things and there's a lot
[1158.96 - 1164.24] of other things you can control too so
[1162.36 - 1166.08] that helps we can still get exposed
[1164.24 - 1167.84] outside of our environment and guess
[1166.08 - 1169.20] what suffers our lymphatic system our
[1167.84 - 1170.48] health over over all and everything else
[1169.20 - 1172.92] if you got a chronic illness any
[1170.48 - 1176.16] symptoms any conditions your lymphatic
[1172.92 - 1179.72] system is working double time double
[1176.16 - 1182.24] time up to that's what it's doing double
[1179.72 - 1183.72] time and your immune system your we
[1182.24 - 1185.84] counts your killer cells your white
[1183.72 - 1187.04] blood cells all those your lymphocytes
[1185.84 - 1188.64] all the different varieties of the
[1187.04 - 1191.36] immune system monocytes basophils
[1188.64 - 1195.48] neutrophils I don't know all of them I
[1191.36 - 1197.68] all those lymphocytes all of them that
[1195.48 - 1199.16] what happens is that they're working
[1197.68 - 1201.20] double time they're working hard they're
[1199.16 - 1202.52] working hard in and around the lymphatic
[1201.20 - 1204.08] system the ones that are in the
[1202.52 - 1205.24] lymphatic system work hard in there the
[1204.08 - 1207.68] ones that are outside the body are
[1205.24 - 1209.64] working hard in there they're all
[1207.68 - 1211.60] working hard everything's working hard
[1209.64 - 1214.80] for you not against you your immune
[1211.60 - 1219.16] system never goes against you ever ever
[1214.80 - 1223.48] ever ever never goes against you a
[1219.16 - 1227.12] raging virus like a flu virus real bad
[1223.48 - 1228.56] one yeah that goes against you you know
[1227.12 - 1230.04] other viruses go against against you
[1228.56 - 1232.56] bacteria goes against you other things
[1230.04 - 1235.20] like that but the immune system doesn't
[1232.56 - 1236.92] it doesn't and it doesn't attack the
[1235.20 - 1239.60] body it never attacks the body I have a
[1236.92 - 1241.72] chapter in thyroid healing read it again
[1239.60 - 1244.32] the autoimmune mistake the great mistake
[1241.72 - 1248.32] the autoimmune Theory weit just read
[1244.32 - 1251.92] that it I'm it's it's it says it all it
[1248.32 - 1253.32] says it all so so what do we do what do
[1251.92 - 1255.20] we do we want to protect our immune
[1253.32 - 1256.76] system we want to protect our lymphatic
[1255.20 - 1259.72] system you know how we talk about immune
[1256.76 - 1261.88] system oh immune support oh immune
[1259.72 - 1263.44] support oh immune system support oh no
[1261.88 - 1264.88] build up your immune system oh
[1263.44 - 1268.32] strengthen your immune system you know
[1264.88 - 1270.84] how we do that right it's really like
[1268.32 - 1273.16] lymphatic system support that's what we
[1270.84 - 1275.84] need to be saying build up the lymphatic
[1273.16 - 1278.12] system strengthen the lymphatic system
[1275.84 - 1281.08] over here and that's what we should be
[1278.12 - 1283.76] saying too that's really what we should
[1281.08 - 1286.56] be saying it's really what we are saying
[1283.76 - 1290.00] without realizing
[1286.56 - 1291.56] it yeah I know I know this stuff's heavy
[1290.00 - 1297.04] I told you I told you this stuff is
[1291.56 - 1299.44] pretty heavy it is so talk about viruses
[1297.04 - 1303.08] let's talk about viruses the Epstein bar
[1299.44 - 1306.56] virus responsible for mono it's it the
[1303.08 - 1309.72] lymphatic vessels always are under
[1306.56 - 1312.20] attack with the beine bar right from the
[1309.72 - 1314.24] first bout of somebody's mono to later
[1312.20 - 1316.56] on just having epine bar and and and
[1314.24 - 1318.56] living with it everybody lives with it
[1316.56 - 1320.64] we have it in our system and it's causes
[1318.56 - 1322.84] everything it causes fibromyalgia it
[1320.64 - 1325.08] causes multiple sclerosis it causes
[1322.84 - 1326.96] rheumatoid arthritis it causes a
[1325.08 - 1328.68] tremendous amount of neurological system
[1326.96 - 1331.96] symptoms that get passed off as Lyme
[1328.68 - 1334.00] disease it causes lupus it causes um uh
[1331.96 - 1335.72] chronic fatigue syndrome all of the new
[1334.00 - 1337.60] chronic fatigue syndrome labels they can
[1335.72 - 1341.12] keep on stamping out a new one and a new
[1337.60 - 1342.76] one and new one me and on you know to um
[1341.12 - 1344.92] intolerance resist and everything they
[1342.76 - 1347.24] can just keep on bringing new names to
[1344.92 - 1349.04] try to keep keep everybody thinking
[1347.24 - 1350.84] research and sence got somewhere with
[1349.04 - 1353.84] with chronic fatigue syndrome but they
[1350.84 - 1356.84] haven't yet unless they learn a it's the
[1353.84 - 1359.72] Epstein bar virus and B the body's not
[1356.84 - 1361.88] attacking itself and C it's not genetic
[1359.72 - 1363.52] and then and then let's talk once they
[1361.88 - 1365.72] got that down then then then they're
[1363.52 - 1368.04] playing on a normal playing field or a
[1365.72 - 1370.76] truthful playing field
[1368.04 - 1372.76] so the just the Epstein bar virus alone
[1370.76 - 1375.52] and what it does in the problems it's
[1372.76 - 1377.64] causing within the body the lymphatic
[1375.52 - 1379.76] system is literally Target number one
[1377.64 - 1381.52] and they they go into battle your
[1379.76 - 1383.16] lymphocytes in your lymphatic system
[1381.52 - 1385.52] Epstein bar goes into the lymphatic
[1383.16 - 1387.92] system and it it goes after it creates
[1385.52 - 1390.28] these swollen lymph
[1387.92 - 1392.08] nodes and the lymph nodes are trying to
[1390.28 - 1394.84] destroy the epine bar that's where the
[1392.08 - 1396.92] battle happens so much and so many
[1394.84 - 1399.52] people and they get all the swollen
[1396.92 - 1402.40] glands and a lot of kids with mono and
[1399.52 - 1404.84] early mono symptoms they get the mumps
[1402.40 - 1409.24] you know what the mumps is the mumps is
[1404.84 - 1411.52] about of mono undiagnosed by the doctors
[1409.24 - 1415.72] by research and science or medical
[1411.52 - 1418.80] communities the MPS is Epstein bar
[1415.72 - 1421.32] that's mono so when a kid gets the MPS
[1418.80 - 1423.12] they when a child when a little girl or
[1421.32 - 1428.64] a little boy gets the
[1423.12 - 1431.44] MS that is Epstein bar that is aout of
[1428.64 - 1432.64] mono that's what that is and that's the
[1431.44 - 1435.36] you know and and that's what the
[1432.64 - 1436.64] confusion is so when they give you you
[1435.36 - 1440.00] know they give you that whole thing
[1436.64 - 1444.52] about Ms it's not even correct it's not
[1440.00 - 1445.84] even correct on any level it's not so Ms
[1444.52 - 1448.92] that's what the whole Ms think that's
[1445.84 - 1451.88] all lymphatic swelling that's a that
[1448.92 - 1454.48] that virus is all the mono virus in that
[1451.88 - 1456.96] lymphatic swelling right there that's
[1454.48 - 1461.32] what that is and the lymphatic vessels
[1456.96 - 1464.08] they're all wrapped up into that romatic
[1461.32 - 1467.92] fever okay I mean that alone that's all
[1464.08 - 1469.56] that's also epsteen bar um all of that
[1467.92 - 1473.04] is and it's all involved with the with
[1469.56 - 1476.20] the lymphatic system it's all inv
[1473.04 - 1479.36] glandular fever that's mono glandular
[1476.20 - 1480.80] fever they call it they call that in
[1479.36 - 1483.96] different parts of the world glandular
[1480.80 - 1486.28] fever and that's mono so I've seen bar
[1483.96 - 1488.04] is the big one that the lymphatic system
[1486.28 - 1489.72] is always up against and the lymphatic
[1488.04 - 1492.40] system goes up against other viruses
[1489.72 - 1494.88] viral situations without a
[1492.40 - 1498.60] doubt but that
[1494.88 - 1500.92] one Epstein bar and is is a big one for
[1498.60 - 1503.64] all of that and so we get that when
[1500.92 - 1506.96] we're younger the whole thing tonsilitis
[1503.64 - 1509.40] tonsilitis is totally lymphatic it's
[1506.96 - 1511.32] it's the tonsils that's what's that's
[1509.40 - 1514.16] what what that's all what's around the
[1511.32 - 1518.20] tonsils that's your lymphatic system
[1514.16 - 1521.04] there it is tonsilitis is mono that's
[1518.20 - 1524.56] Epstein bar tonsilitis they took a lot
[1521.04 - 1526.92] of tonsils out of people and still do
[1524.56 - 1528.48] without realizing that person has a bout
[1526.92 - 1530.20] of mono
[1528.48 - 1532.32] and the reason why they don't diagnose
[1530.20 - 1534.16] it is because
[1532.32 - 1535.72] misdiagnoses you know so a lot of
[1534.16 - 1538.76] doctors don't know what they're looking
[1535.72 - 1540.36] for don't know what they're looking at
[1538.76 - 1542.88] happens all the time it's not their
[1540.36 - 1546.12] fault that's one thing the other thing
[1542.88 - 1548.72] is if you have a small bout of Epstein
[1546.12 - 1550.52] bar or mono when you're young small bout
[1548.72 - 1553.96] of mono when you're really
[1550.52 - 1557.24] little when you get tonsilitis later a
[1553.96 - 1559.08] little bit later on as a child it won't
[1557.24 - 1560.60] register it the same way with your
[1559.08 - 1562.44] immune system with the blood work the
[1560.60 - 1565.64] finable blood work the the the the
[1562.44 - 1568.12] faulty blood work system at the labs and
[1565.64 - 1570.40] how we analyze blood you won't
[1568.12 - 1572.28] understand the physician won't even
[1570.40 - 1574.32] understand that this is a person's
[1572.28 - 1576.08] second time having mono it's going to
[1574.32 - 1578.04] look different in the blood work it's
[1576.08 - 1580.88] going to be tonsilitis now and they
[1578.04 - 1582.76] won't even have a clue at all at all
[1580.88 - 1585.60] won't even have a clue and it's all
[1582.76 - 1588.76] lymphatic system all around the
[1585.60 - 1590.48] tonsils so these are just some examples
[1588.76 - 1593.48] of how the lymphatic system works how
[1590.48 - 1596.60] the tonsils work how your liver Works
[1593.48 - 1599.64] how everything works all of it all of it
[1596.60 - 1602.36] every last bit of it so and then there's
[1599.64 - 1604.88] lymphodema lymphodema that can that
[1602.36 - 1606.76] occur when lymphatic vessel swell
[1604.88 - 1609.80] someone gets really viral and they get
[1606.76 - 1611.12] viral inside the liver hhv6 undiscovered
[1609.80 - 1613.24] nobody even knows you know they know
[1611.12 - 1615.60] about hhv6 but they don't know that it
[1613.24 - 1617.20] sits in the liver wreaking havoc all the
[1615.60 - 1619.60] different shingles viruses that can sit
[1617.20 - 1622.28] in the liver wreaking havoc hhv7
[1619.60 - 1627.04] undiscovered 10 11 12 undiscovered 13
[1622.28 - 1627.04] undiscovered 14 undiscovered 16
[1627.16 - 1633.96] hhv6 and it goes on and it goes on so
[1631.84 - 1636.12] and all these viruses the mutations
[1633.96 - 1638.92] including different Epstein bars cyto
[1636.12 - 1642.48] virus that's one too they all reside in
[1638.92 - 1644.52] the liver and some Escape some Prosper
[1642.48 - 1645.84] some turn into something some people
[1644.52 - 1647.72] have less some people have more some
[1645.84 - 1648.72] people only have the Epstein bar some
[1647.72 - 1651.40] people have the
[1648.72 - 1653.52] hhv6 some people have both the whole
[1651.40 - 1655.88] thing is how it works and
[1653.52 - 1657.48] then sometimes when we're immune system
[1655.88 - 1658.64] is broken down we're not eating good
[1657.48 - 1660.04] we're not taking care of ourselves we're
[1658.64 - 1662.52] under a tremendous amount of stress we
[1660.04 - 1664.32] have emotional hardships emotional
[1662.52 - 1666.44] turmoil all these different things
[1664.32 - 1669.04] losses all this stuff happens Financial
[1666.44 - 1672.00] stress everything else and boom we're
[1669.04 - 1673.88] getting chronic fatigue syndrome boom
[1672.00 - 1675.72] we're getting lymphadema boom we're
[1673.88 - 1679.28] getting Hashim modus
[1675.72 - 1681.12] thyroiditis on our wedding day day yeah
[1679.28 - 1684.84] seen that lots of times I've seen
[1681.12 - 1686.80] weddings stress out a bride to such a
[1684.84 - 1688.88] degree all the way to the point of
[1686.80 - 1691.04] getting married and right after getting
[1688.88 - 1693.00] married developing Hashimoto's
[1691.04 - 1695.60] thyroiditis and running to 10 three four
[1693.00 - 1698.04] five different doctors and and and
[1695.60 - 1699.44] handing handing over getting handed over
[1698.04 - 1702.40] Hashimoto
[1699.44 - 1704.80] thyroiditis in fact on wedding days and
[1702.40 - 1707.44] be right before wedding day right after
[1704.80 - 1710.24] mostly right after because you know it's
[1707.44 - 1711.84] 's a high adrenaline thing going on and
[1710.24 - 1713.20] the groom and the bride and and the
[1711.84 - 1715.12] families and everything else there's
[1713.20 - 1718.72] this High adrenaline thing going on and
[1715.12 - 1721.88] every money is totally going
[1718.72 - 1724.80] crazy and not for everybody but for a
[1721.88 - 1728.56] lot of people and then boom Hashimoto's
[1724.80 - 1731.48] diagnosis for a 28 29y old 25y old bride
[1728.56 - 1734.48] 32y old very common happens all the time
[1731.48 - 1737.04] I saw it all the time for years when I
[1734.48 - 1739.40] was helping out people and it happens
[1737.04 - 1742.00] now our immune system gets run down from
[1739.40 - 1743.56] stress from adrenaline or whatever it is
[1742.00 - 1746.56] whether it's a good thing bad thing
[1743.56 - 1748.60] however it is we get worn out and then
[1746.56 - 1750.60] we get susceptible susceptible to so
[1748.60 - 1752.96] many different things because our liers
[1750.60 - 1755.20] harboring some viral material or we pick
[1752.96 - 1759.24] up a new virus and our lymphatic system
[1755.20 - 1761.96] can't do the job it needs to do because
[1759.24 - 1764.68] it's rund down it's zinc
[1761.96 - 1766.36] deficient zinc deficient a zinc
[1764.68 - 1768.04] deficiency is like the lymphatic
[1766.36 - 1770.52] system's worst nightmare
[1768.04 - 1771.68] and the liver's worst nightmare the one
[1770.52 - 1774.24] thing and I'm going to I said this
[1771.68 - 1776.76] before I'm going to say it again the one
[1774.24 - 1779.24] thing and I have this even I've even I
[1776.76 - 1781.80] even put this in thyroid healing a
[1779.24 - 1784.32] section about this okay in the myths
[1781.80 - 1787.24] chapter if you go check out that chapter
[1784.32 - 1790.60] and you'll see I think it's chapter 21
[1787.24 - 1793.68] or something or 22 one of those
[1790.60 - 1796.36] chapters um I think it is don't don't
[1793.68 - 1798.64] quote me on that yeah yeah just I just
[1796.36 - 1801.12] you know I've just basically finished
[1798.64 - 1802.88] another book that going to be releasing
[1801.12 - 1805.32] at the end of the year so My my brain is
[1802.88 - 1807.80] scrambled on that I might be thinking
[1805.32 - 1809.80] chapter 21 of my my my newest book
[1807.80 - 1812.88] that's going to be coming out so anyway
[1809.80 - 1816.24] the bottom line is zinc it's it's it's
[1812.88 - 1817.96] the most precious thing for our body and
[1816.24 - 1819.72] there's it's under attack by
[1817.96 - 1821.28] misinformation that's just this is what
[1819.72 - 1822.64] I talk about trendy traps you want to
[1821.28 - 1825.88] know why I gave that little speech at
[1822.64 - 1828.48] the beginning of the show trendy traps
[1825.88 - 1832.44] okay because trendy trap per one is the
[1828.48 - 1834.72] zinc fear zinc fear okay you you don't
[1832.44 - 1837.08] have to OD on zinc by any means but
[1834.72 - 1839.76] we're so deficient in it it's not even
[1837.08 - 1842.60] in our food anymore our lymphatic system
[1839.76 - 1845.08] is desperate for it a few tiny drops of
[1842.60 - 1847.16] zinc every day can do miracles for
[1845.08 - 1848.88] protecting you so that you don't end up
[1847.16 - 1851.40] with Hashimoto thyroiditis on your
[1848.88 - 1854.12] wedding day which I've seen so many
[1851.40 - 1856.56] times if I only saw that once I would
[1854.12 - 1858.84] never mention it I would never mention
[1856.56 - 1861.76] that it's I would never go there if I
[1858.84 - 1863.96] only saw that once I saw it dozens and
[1861.76 - 1866.48] dozens of times over the years just
[1863.96 - 1869.44] letting you know that's why I'm saying
[1866.48 - 1871.12] it and I'll use other examples I'll I'll
[1869.44 - 1875.20] switch to another example I've seen so
[1871.12 - 1877.04] many times too and um well graduation
[1875.20 - 1879.96] for college students you know you're
[1877.04 - 1882.40] finishing up you're finishing up um
[1879.96 - 1884.80] college and and you get the worst case
[1882.40 - 1887.76] Amano you're finishing up college and
[1884.80 - 1889.24] you get tonsilitis you finish up College
[1887.76 - 1891.36] and and you get you know you get
[1889.24 - 1893.88] something else you get severe chronic
[1891.36 - 1895.52] fatigue you get hashimotos it's
[1893.88 - 1898.32] happening now in all the kids the kids
[1895.52 - 1900.84] at 22 23 years old young women
[1898.32 - 1902.60] especially so I've seen that if I didn't
[1900.84 - 1904.48] see that dozens and dozens dozens time I
[1902.60 - 1905.96] wouldn't mention that either it'd be
[1904.48 - 1908.60] this obscure one
[1905.96 - 1911.36] time but anyway the bottom line is the
[1908.60 - 1914.60] zinc could actually stop all that if you
[1911.36 - 1917.96] have it on enough in you so you know I
[1914.60 - 1921.52] always do for myself personally I always
[1917.96 - 1923.72] take like one dropper full of zinc every
[1921.52 - 1924.96] day one dropper full of zinc every day
[1923.72 - 1927.96] of the right kind of zinc you can go to
[1924.96 - 1929.68] the medical medium directory um on my
[1927.96 - 1933.84] website find out which things are the
[1929.68 - 1936.64] best but I do one droper full every day
[1933.84 - 1938.96] and it you know it helps me and helps
[1936.64 - 1941.12] protect me in my system I mean I talk to
[1938.96 - 1942.96] Spirit about it all the time I want to
[1941.12 - 1944.56] keep my lymphatic system strong my white
[1942.96 - 1946.68] count strong I want because what does
[1944.56 - 1949.04] the white blood count what does it
[1946.68 - 1952.36] consist of is its most important mineral
[1949.04 - 1955.08] out of all the minerals that it runs on
[1952.36 - 1958.24] zinc and that's the main one that's the
[1955.08 - 1960.88] main one so when we go zinc fear because
[1958.24 - 1964.20] we think it's going to eliminate copper
[1960.88 - 1967.24] we're so high in Copper food is so high
[1964.20 - 1969.68] in Copper you eat one avocado you
[1967.24 - 1973.16] wouldn't believe the amount of Trace
[1969.68 - 1977.04] copper in one avocado there's no zinc in
[1973.16 - 1979.08] anything there's no zinc it's gone it's
[1977.04 - 1981.56] it's gone and partly because in the old
[1979.08 - 1983.36] days when DDT was spread on the planet
[1981.56 - 1985.40] in the old days and spread all through
[1983.36 - 1989.40] the US and all over the planet and still
[1985.40 - 1993.16] is in Parts DDT had a reaction in the
[1989.40 - 1996.64] soil it canceled out zinc and DDT is
[1993.16 - 1999.08] still in soils all organic farms even
[1996.64 - 2000.28] have traces of it without without
[1999.08 - 2002.72] because they're not testing for that
[2000.28 - 2005.32] they don't even look for that it's it no
[2002.72 - 2008.56] one there's not no one's testing for
[2005.32 - 2011.04] that it's not but it's everywhere it's
[2008.56 - 2012.04] the the world is dusted with it so you
[2011.04 - 2013.76] can't you can't worry about you still
[2012.04 - 2015.28] got to eat organic produce you ra better
[2013.76 - 2016.56] eat organic produce than eating all the
[2015.28 - 2019.64] time conventional produce unless it's
[2016.56 - 2022.40] your only option um but the whole point
[2019.64 - 2024.24] is it's dusted everywhere it's dusted in
[2022.40 - 2027.48] all the fields that grass-fed cows are
[2024.24 - 2030.28] raised on it still dusted they use it it
[2027.48 - 2033.60] blows across continents they're using it
[2030.28 - 2036.48] all all in other all in other countries
[2033.60 - 2037.84] as if it was if if Z was safe and fine
[2036.48 - 2039.60] and D
[2037.84 - 2041.72] and what it does it blows everywhere it
[2039.60 - 2044.60] lands on all the fields the cows are
[2041.72 - 2047.68] grazing it lands on
[2044.60 - 2050.88] everything and what does it do it has a
[2047.68 - 2053.64] clashing effect it has a critical
[2050.88 - 2056.04] interaction effect that nobody knows
[2053.64 - 2059.76] about an interaction effect is it
[2056.04 - 2061.72] literally destroys zinc so when it rains
[2059.76 - 2064.68] and it rains those particles those fine
[2061.72 - 2068.04] DDT particles and it rins them and
[2064.68 - 2070.28] saturates them into the Earth everywhere
[2068.04 - 2072.40] nothing's not free from it it's one of
[2070.28 - 2076.36] those diabolical things that occurred on
[2072.40 - 2078.52] the planet thank God it's it's at least
[2076.36 - 2080.12] controlled here in the US and not
[2078.52 - 2081.88] freshly used even though it's new
[2080.12 - 2084.32] cousins in the pesticide world the nerv
[2081.88 - 2086.72] asde world and funus side world are just
[2084.32 - 2088.76] are rampant which are horrific enough
[2086.72 - 2090.24] but thank God this isn't being used
[2088.76 - 2091.68] fresh even though it's being used fresh
[2090.24 - 2094.08] in other continents and blowing over but
[2091.68 - 2097.20] it destroys zinc it destroys zinc in our
[2094.08 - 2099.68] body it destroys zinc in the Earth and
[2097.20 - 2101.64] we have DDT passed from our forefather
[2099.68 - 2103.84] from our grandfather and grandmothers
[2101.64 - 2107.24] you don't think you don't think that's
[2103.84 - 2109.64] possible think again think
[2107.24 - 2111.28] again yeah I don't you know look if it
[2109.64 - 2112.84] if living in the dark and not knowing
[2111.28 - 2114.08] these things makes you feel better and
[2112.84 - 2117.60] that's what you have to do then I
[2114.08 - 2120.20] respect that one one bit you I mean 100%
[2117.60 - 2123.00] I expect it I mean you know I expect it
[2120.20 - 2125.24] in a lot of people but I respect it
[2123.00 - 2127.08] 100% because you know I've I've had
[2125.24 - 2129.04] people tell me I don't want to know I
[2127.08 - 2130.48] don't want to know I don't know I don't
[2129.04 - 2132.28] want to know what's going on out there
[2130.48 - 2134.12] really I just want to be safe and just
[2132.28 - 2136.04] not really think about it so try not to
[2134.12 - 2137.96] tell me too much so I'm up all night
[2136.04 - 2140.40] I've had people tell me that I
[2137.96 - 2143.40] understand and I and I totally honor
[2140.40 - 2146.08] that but the deal is we inherit the DDT
[2143.40 - 2147.72] DDT is inside the liver it kills the
[2146.08 - 2149.40] zinc Factory in our liver because our
[2147.72 - 2151.44] liver resides and needs zinc it
[2149.40 - 2154.28] functions on zinc it wants zinc it
[2151.44 - 2156.04] manufactures even zinc when it can it
[2154.28 - 2159.32] does it all the liver does it all so
[2156.04 - 2164.08] what happens is is we have no zinc in
[2159.32 - 2166.08] us it's really really really low if
[2164.08 - 2168.08] non-existent for a lot of people so
[2166.08 - 2170.20] taking a couple of tiny drops every now
[2168.08 - 2171.84] and then could be a wonderful thing
[2170.20 - 2174.88] protect your lymphatic system from
[2171.84 - 2177.56] viruses so you don't end up with a case
[2174.88 - 2178.60] of fibromyalgia which is a later stage
[2177.56 - 2180.48] Epstein
[2178.60 - 2183.92] bar but you know what science of
[2180.48 - 2186.76] research thinks fibromyalgia is a case
[2183.92 - 2188.60] of overactive nerves you know what the
[2186.76 - 2191.12] alternative movement thinks fibromyalgia
[2188.60 - 2193.60] is the body attacking
[2191.12 - 2196.40] itself you know what geneticists think
[2193.60 - 2198.88] fibromyalgia is
[2196.40 - 2201.68] genetic God and here we are in this day
[2198.88 - 2203.68] and age yep here we are would you
[2201.68 - 2206.32] believe it it's
[2203.68 - 2208.80] 1905 it's 19 actually they knew more
[2206.32 - 2212.00] about chronic illness probably in 1905 I
[2208.80 - 2215.52] hate to say it they probably did so okay
[2212.00 - 2216.68] so the bottom line is we wanted get some
[2215.52 - 2218.40] zinc in there you can't worry about
[2216.68 - 2220.40] about canceling out copper everything's
[2218.40 - 2223.68] high in Copper the soil's high in Copper
[2220.40 - 2226.40] oh dear lord everything is we also have
[2223.68 - 2228.16] destructive copper like saturated in our
[2226.40 - 2231.40] bodies we're high in Copper everybody
[2228.16 - 2233.44] with eczema has copper high in Copper
[2231.40 - 2236.16] everybody with the neurological
[2233.44 - 2239.64] condition any neurological condition
[2236.16 - 2242.72] whatsoever is high in Copper anyone with
[2239.64 - 2245.12] one neurological symptom tingles and
[2242.72 - 2247.64] numbness aches and pains dizziness

[2251.60 - 2256.76] crippling to mild depression from
[2254.20 - 2260.36] crippling to mild the list goes on
[2256.76 - 2263.20] eczema psoriasis skin disorders vitil
[2260.36 - 2266.44] Vitiligo anything there's copper
[2263.20 - 2270.72] involved all high in Copper all of that
[2266.44 - 2275.00] eye problems ear problems um just all
[2270.72 - 2277.24] high in Copper all of it sibo gut health
[2275.00 - 2280.84] problems high in Copper
[2277.24 - 2283.04] um Tremors ticks spasms it's because the
[2280.84 - 2285.88] person's high in Copper all of it
[2283.04 - 2289.76] anything neurological from adz migraines
[2285.88 - 2291.40] trigeminal neuralgia high in Copper okay
[2289.76 - 2293.00] whether you get a disease and you forgot
[2291.40 - 2294.24] about you know and in the doctor doesn't
[2293.00 - 2296.56] even talk about your symptoms they just
[2294.24 - 2298.44] want to slap a lime tag on you or they
[2296.56 - 2300.24] just want a lime disease tag on you or
[2298.44 - 2303.16] they just want to slap an MS tag on you
[2300.24 - 2306.00] whatever it is copper high in Copper
[2303.16 - 2308.20] meaning it it it means you you still
[2306.00 - 2310.68] it's I'm not saying copper is the
[2308.20 - 2312.92] problem but you're high in Copper if you
[2310.68 - 2314.72] got any of that and you know what you're
[2312.92 - 2318.40] low in
[2314.72 - 2320.00] zinc you're low in zinc why am I big on
[2318.40 - 2322.64] zinc today in this show because the
[2320.00 - 2324.20] lymphatic system needs it it needs it to
[2322.64 - 2327.04] stay healthy do you need to take a lot
[2324.20 - 2330.00] of it no have I taken a lot of it at
[2327.04 - 2331.68] times yeah zinc shock therapy okay
[2330.00 - 2335.72] that's something that Spirit created was
[2331.68 - 2338.92] Zinc shock therapy zinc shock therapy is
[2335.72 - 2340.88] incredible saved me on a trip saved me
[2338.92 - 2342.56] on a trip years ago it's coming down
[2340.88 - 2344.76] with a flu spirit said you're coming
[2342.56 - 2347.00] down with a flu you're rundown you
[2344.76 - 2349.16] haven't slept you're traveling you're on
[2347.00 - 2352.56] planes left and right I spent more time
[2349.16 - 2353.96] in the air than I did on the ground I
[2352.56 - 2357.12] did on the ground for a little while in
[2353.96 - 2359.40] my life oh I spent more time in the air
[2357.12 - 2361.28] more time in the air I wasn't eating as
[2359.40 - 2363.92] good as I could I didn't have it in
[2361.28 - 2366.76] front of me so I was just scrapping for
[2363.92 - 2370.00] for for scr was scaming for any anything
[2366.76 - 2372.44] healthy I could find was run down no
[2370.00 - 2375.12] sleep whatsoever I was also under
[2372.44 - 2377.60] tremendous stress not just because
[2375.12 - 2379.40] because spirit's talking to me 24/7 to
[2377.60 - 2381.32] help others all the time I was under
[2379.40 - 2383.12] tremendous amounts of stress I had some
[2381.32 - 2385.40] deadlines I had some other things going
[2383.12 - 2387.60] on I also was trying to help a couple of
[2385.40 - 2391.20] family members I was do I was just
[2387.60 - 2392.96] pushed to the Max and exposed way too
[2391.20 - 2395.52] much to a lot of
[2392.96 - 2397.44] germs I was visiting I was visiting the
[2395.52 - 2399.64] hospital visiting some family members I
[2397.44 - 2402.52] was I had people coughing on me left and
[2399.64 - 2404.60] right I was exposed to everything and
[2402.52 - 2406.60] was back up in the air again and what
[2404.60 - 2409.24] happened with no sleep in me is coming
[2406.60 - 2411.68] down with the flu and spirit said zinc
[2409.24 - 2414.48] shock therapy right away and I had a
[2411.68 - 2418.44] bottle of zinc on me couldn't believe it
[2414.48 - 2419.72] I squirted four or five dropper fs and
[2418.44 - 2420.96] because I'm not sensitive to zinc if
[2419.72 - 2422.24] you're sensitive to zinc just like
[2420.96 - 2424.12] you're sensitive you could be sensitive
[2422.24 - 2426.36] to anything you start with a couple of
[2424.12 - 2428.16] tiny drops you know just a couple of
[2426.36 - 2430.52] honey drops that's all you need I did
[2428.16 - 2431.88] four or five dropper Falls Bam Bam Bam
[2430.52 - 2433.52] right in the throat I let it sit in the
[2431.88 - 2434.96] throat spirit said let it sit in the
[2433.52 - 2436.36] throat for 2 minutes I let it sit in the
[2434.96 - 2439.16] throat for 2 minutes I had it sitting in
[2436.36 - 2441.72] there my lymphatic system was sucking it
[2439.16 - 2444.76] up like never before just absorbing it
[2441.72 - 2446.92] like sucking it up like just bringing it
[2444.76 - 2448.64] right in right into it getting all
[2446.92 - 2453.60] through my lymphatic system the whole
[2448.64 - 2457.08] bit you better believe it okay I woke up
[2453.60 - 2458.84] the next morning it was gone spirit said
[2457.08 - 2461.60] you did it you conquered it one shot
[2458.84 - 2465.52] with zinc with zinc shock therapy
[2461.60 - 2468.20] conquered everybody else around me
[2465.52 - 2472.32] they're you know hop on the plank
[2468.20 - 2475.48] everybody coffin everything and Bam Zing
[2472.32 - 2478.24] shock therapy totally caught it in
[2475.48 - 2481.04] time and you know and I had some zinc in
[2478.24 - 2482.68] me already cuz you know I took it
[2481.04 - 2484.52] randomly that's why I even had it on me
[2482.68 - 2486.32] I took it once in a while I had it on me
[2484.52 - 2488.04] cuz I knew about S I knew about
[2486.32 - 2491.04] lymphatic system I knew about this from
[2488.04 - 2494.32] Spirit and I wasn't in fear of it fear
[2491.04 - 2496.04] of it eliminating my copper reserves
[2494.32 - 2498.20] because there's always plenty of copper
[2496.04 - 2499.72] reserves you eat one avocado you're just
[2498.20 - 2502.00] building back your copper reserves in
[2499.72 - 2504.20] one shot that's how much copper is in
[2502.00 - 2505.72] avocado I mean it's good for you you eat
[2504.20 - 2508.84] avocados it's good for you but that
[2505.72 - 2510.20] that's how much is in there so all this
[2508.84 - 2511.92] is important to know so let's just run
[2510.20 - 2513.48] by some foods for the lymphatic system
[2511.92 - 2515.12] help the liver too and the liver gets so
[2513.48 - 2517.88] clogged up and it's so loaded with
[2515.12 - 2521.00] poison and toxins so much debris and
[2517.88 - 2522.80] it's saturated inside the liver and the
[2521.00 - 2524.72] liver is just puffing it out back into
[2522.80 - 2526.36] the bloodstream because it has no other
[2524.72 - 2528.52] no other way of handling it it's so
[2526.36 - 2530.84] overloaded stagnant sluggish livers high
[2528.52 - 2532.52] fat diets no oxygen inside the blood
[2530.84 - 2535.32] because you're on a trendy high-fat diet
[2532.52 - 2538.36] or a standard American high-fat diet
[2535.32 - 2540.68] you're on Either Ore you know and and
[2538.36 - 2543.32] you're not eating enough fruits and
[2540.68 - 2544.32] vegetables people should people should
[2543.32 - 2547.08] switch
[2544.32 - 2549.40] gears they should switch gears sometimes
[2547.08 - 2551.08] to really help themselves bring in more
[2549.40 - 2552.76] fruits and vegetables so what can we do
[2551.08 - 2554.36] for the lymphatic system fruit is one of
[2552.76 - 2556.44] the greatest weapons for the lymphatic
[2554.36 - 2558.92] system I'll say it again I said it
[2556.44 - 2561.72] before apples are incredible pears are
[2558.92 - 2563.52] great peaches nectarines plums cherries
[2561.72 - 2566.68] are really incredible for the lymphatic
[2563.52 - 2570.00] system they're great melons watermelon
[2566.68 - 2572.52] regular melon honeydew melon um you name
[2570.00 - 2575.64] it those are all those are all great for
[2572.52 - 2577.72] the lymphatic system okay so you know
[2575.64 - 2579.48] that that alone green juice celery juice
[2577.72 - 2582.32] is by far probably the greatest weapon
[2579.48 - 2584.60] for the lymphatic system because the the
[2582.32 - 2586.52] the Undiscovered cluster salts that
[2584.60 - 2588.64] nobody knows about the the highly
[2586.52 - 2590.00] mineralized cluster salts that are
[2588.64 - 2591.56] undiscovered in the sense that they're
[2590.00 - 2592.96] not studied no one's seen it no one
[2591.56 - 2594.92] knows what's going on no one knows how
[2592.96 - 2597.40] they work they strip off viruses the
[2594.92 - 2600.40] cell membranes and destroy viruses they
[2597.40 - 2603.16] kill the Epstein bar virus celery juice
[2600.40 - 2604.44] people wonder why they're getting better
[2603.16 - 2608.04] when they're drinking all their celery
[2604.44 - 2609.92] juice thousands thousands and thousands
[2608.04 - 2611.80] of people actually at this point
[2609.92 - 2614.32] millions of people because of medical
[2611.80 - 2616.92] medium meaning spirit and I of getting
[2614.32 - 2619.48] the information about celery juice it's
[2616.92 - 2621.36] it's it's unbelievable what's happening
[2619.48 - 2624.16] the stores don't even have celery
[2621.36 - 2625.20] anymore that's what's going on out there
[2624.16 - 2626.76] and people are getting better and
[2625.20 - 2627.92] they're wondering why their fibromyalgia
[2626.76 - 2629.12] is getting better when they drink celery
[2627.92 - 2631.88] juice because the celery juice is
[2629.12 - 2633.72] stripping off the Epstein bar membrane
[2631.88 - 2635.08] it's stripping off other viruses it's
[2633.72 - 2638.04] knocking down
[2635.08 - 2640.56] everything and not even just that too
[2638.04 - 2642.48] bacteria like strap a cacus for for sibo
[2640.56 - 2645.12] and all kinds of other things and H
[2642.48 - 2647.20] pylori for Digestive problems and you
[2645.12 - 2648.72] it's curing ulcers healing people it's
[2647.20 - 2650.36] celery juice and what does it do it
[2648.72 - 2652.60] heals the lymphatic system it's
[2650.36 - 2654.20] incredible one the mineral salts bind on
[2652.60 - 2656.04] the poisons in the liver and the
[2654.20 - 2658.20] lymphatic system push it out they help
[2656.04 - 2659.88] get rid of ly lymphadema you name it
[2658.20 - 2661.96] it's amazing what celery juice can do
[2659.88 - 2663.60] cucumber juice is another great one too
[2661.96 - 2664.84] I like the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2663.60 - 2666.32] it's incredible because it takes out
[2664.84 - 2668.12] heavy metals and other poison out of the
[2666.32 - 2670.72] liver it helps it gives you lots of
[2668.12 - 2672.92] antioxidants wild blueberries wild
[2670.72 - 2674.76] blueberries incredible for lymphatic
[2672.92 - 2677.08] problems chaga mushroom I love the
[2674.76 - 2679.52] vimergy chaga mushroom the vimergy
[2677.08 - 2681.48] barleygrass juice powder I I use those
[2679.52 - 2684.00] every day for my lymphatic system my
[2681.48 - 2686.16] liver and I just you know I I take that
[2684.00 - 2688.40] stuff every day Hawaiian spirulina
[2686.16 - 2689.76] that's in the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2688.40 - 2692.24] that's a great one right there all in
[2689.76 - 2695.16] its own I like dandelion you know was in
[2692.24 - 2696.64] the store and it's rare I'm in the store
[2695.16 - 2699.64] it's rare I'm in theore store I mean you
[2696.64 - 2701.76] guys probably know why because because
[2699.64 - 2703.52] number one I'll be doing readings in the
[2701.76 - 2705.56] aisle um people are going to be coming
[2703.52 - 2707.32] up to me and being like you're Anthony
[2705.56 - 2709.36] and I'll be like it happened the other

[2748.56 - 2753.20] each person what they needed to eat out
[2750.68 - 2756.04] of the pro protu section and guess what
[2753.20 - 2757.64] I forgot my dandelion greens the whole
[2756.04 - 2759.60] reason why I went there I end up just
[2757.64 - 2761.32] walking dizzy and half blind out of
[2759.60 - 2763.12] there because of I'm around too many
[2761.32 - 2765.60] people I get the snow blind from doing
[2763.12 - 2767.00] the readings but I want to be a human
[2765.60 - 2768.52] being once in a while and I want to be
[2767.00 - 2771.08] able to get out and I want to be able to
[2768.52 - 2773.36] do things once in a while in a blue moon
[2771.08 - 2776.76] I mean I got that right
[2773.36 - 2779.28] right so but I ended up just like uh
[2776.76 - 2780.88] blah blah blah just doing readings and
[2779.28 - 2782.36] then after the reading Spirit was still
[2780.88 - 2784.92] giving me information on people that

[2784.92 - 2789.24] little too much where I was like okay

[3043.72 - 3050.80] for the liver but it's more incredible
[3047.24 - 3053.28] for the lymphatic system that is really
[3050.80 - 3056.24] where it's going to really help it's
[3053.28 - 3058.04] amazing radishes listen if you're not a

[3102.76 - 3107.52] incredible so that's another great one
[3105.44 - 3112.12] and um and you can get a lot of you know
[3107.52 - 3114.56] red bell pepper red ripe bell pepper I
[3112.12 - 3116.96] love that one for the lymphatic system
[3114.56 - 3119.48] and then if if you like cayenne pepper
[3116.96 - 3121.88] or a little bit of hot pepper flakes you
[3119.48 - 3123.60] know hey I like the cayenne pepper I do
[3121.88 - 3125.56] I put it on things I like the cayanne
[3123.60 - 3126.80] pepper you know if you're sensitive to
[3125.56 - 3128.68] that and you don't like the heat don't
[3126.80 - 3131.00] use it don't worry but a little bit if
[3128.68 - 3133.40] you like it won't hurt at all like I
[3131.00 - 3135.56] said the G Ginger turmeric shots or
[3133.40 - 3138.36] ginger tea every day incredible for the
[3135.56 - 3140.56] lymphatic system that's another option
[3138.36 - 3144.00] and the list goes on for the lymphatic
[3140.56 - 3146.00] system you can't go wrong I like melons
[3144.00 - 3148.00] in the morning first thing
[3146.00 - 3149.76] so here's what I do I'll do a melon in
[3148.00 - 3151.40] the morning I'll do my celery juice a
[3149.76 - 3154.04] little bit later on that's that's what I
[3151.40 - 3155.52] do try not to eat a lot of melon first
[3154.04 - 3156.64] thing in the morning because you know
[3155.52 - 3157.56] you're just going to get filled up
[3156.64 - 3159.64] you're going to have you're just going
[3157.56 - 3161.88] to be filled up I mean I've eaten a
[3159.64 - 3163.84] whole melon in the morning or two whole
[3161.88 - 3165.28] melons in the morning you know and if
[3163.84 - 3167.84] you got someplace to go you're going to
[3165.28 - 3169.76] be peeing everywhere so you know just
[3167.84 - 3172.40] because it's going to be cleansing you
[3169.76 - 3174.88] but I like some melon or I'll do celery
[3172.40 - 3176.60] juice first thing after lemon water so
[3174.88 - 3178.16] let me just you let me back up I I like
[3176.60 - 3180.28] doing my lemon water then I like doing
[3178.16 - 3183.04] my celery juice and another thing then I
[3180.28 - 3184.48] do the the melons too you can do it that
[3183.04 - 3186.16] way depending on where you're going
[3184.48 - 3188.00] lately I did I've been doing the melons
[3186.16 - 3189.80] first thing but I know that my
[3188.00 - 3192.52] schedule's changing so I'm doing them
[3189.80 - 3194.44] later and so get the melons because the
[3192.52 - 3196.44] melons really help also with the
[3194.44 - 3198.32] lymphatic system don't be afraid of
[3196.44 - 3199.92] those papaya that's a secret weapon
[3198.32 - 3201.68] against the lymphatic system too helps
[3199.92 - 3204.84] clean it up notice how I'm not saying
[3201.68 - 3205.88] chicken fish um animal meat pork and
[3204.84 - 3207.48] turkey
[3205.88 - 3209.12] does nothing for the lymphatic system
[3207.48 - 3210.48] I'm not saying you have to stop it I'm
[3209.12 - 3212.00] saying if you're concerned about your
[3210.48 - 3214.52] liver concerned about your lymphatic
[3212.00 - 3216.40] system try to go on the 28 day cleanse
[3214.52 - 3219.44] out of book one or the 90-day cleanse
[3216.40 - 3222.12] out of thyroid healing or try to just
[3219.44 - 3223.60] limit your M you know lower your animal
[3222.12 - 3225.00] proteins a little bit so you can clear
[3223.60 - 3226.48] out your lymphatic system and liver
[3225.00 - 3227.88] because all the high fat from the
[3226.48 - 3230.16] chicken and high fat from the chicken
[3227.88 - 3231.84] breast the white chicken breast the all
[3230.16 - 3233.36] high fat from the white pork the white
[3231.84 - 3236.88] pork meat whatever the white meat the
[3233.36 - 3238.76] pork all that fat from the turkey all
[3236.88 - 3240.64] that fat from the grass-fed beef even
[3238.76 - 3242.00] the lanest cuts of beef all that fat
[3240.64 - 3243.48] burdens down the lymphatic system and
[3242.00 - 3245.88] the liers take it and if you're vegan or
[3243.48 - 3247.84] plant-based lower than nuts too many
[3245.88 - 3249.76] nuts and seeds too many nut Butters and
[3247.84 - 3251.56] too much coconut oil is going to get in
[3249.76 - 3253.56] the way of the lymphatic system a little
[3251.56 - 3255.60] bit is fine just lower that down a
[3253.56 - 3257.72] little bit and bring up all the fruits
[3255.60 - 3259.64] and bring up the vegetables bring up the
[3257.72 - 3261.28] things I just said bring in the berock
[3259.64 - 3262.96] rout te you name it we're running out of
[3261.28 - 3265.60] time you guys are the greatest I have to
[3262.96 - 3267.88] say and this is this was a fun show
[3265.60 - 3270.52] rebounding could be really good for the
[3267.88 - 3271.76] lymphatic system pulls and draws a lot
[3270.52 - 3273.96] of poisons out of there but you got to
[3271.76 - 3275.20] be hydrated you got to be hydrated so
[3273.96 - 3276.80] that's what all this is about that's
[3275.20 - 3278.96] what you know the the that's what all
[3276.80 - 3280.80] the celery juice everything else and add
[3278.96 - 3282.60] some water lemon water squeeze lemon
[3280.80 - 3284.44] water every morning you know that really
[3282.60 - 3286.16] helps hydration is really important so
[3284.44 - 3287.80] the rebounding the rebounder that's
[3286.16 - 3289.72] amazing jump up and down on it an
[3287.80 - 3291.20] infrared sauna that's even a good thing
[3289.72 - 3293.16] too it's really helpful for for the
[3291.20 - 3296.56] lymphatic system so these are some other
[3293.16 - 3298.80] things I stand behind you 100% And I
[3296.56 - 3301.80] love you guys dearly one day at a time
