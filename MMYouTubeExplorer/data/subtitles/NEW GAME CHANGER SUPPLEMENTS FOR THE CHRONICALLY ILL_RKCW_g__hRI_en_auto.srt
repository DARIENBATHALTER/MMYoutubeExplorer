1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
this

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,759
and what i was saying one time recently

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,800
right you guys saw the post about it

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,120
being a game changer for the chronicle

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,440
i mean it and there's a lot to be said

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,200
about propolis and how it works but the

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
problem with propolis

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,640
there hasn't been really great

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,560
propolises out there that's one of the

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,640
big problems so i'm talking about the

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,080
vimergy propolis right

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
and i just want to make it clear i'm not

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,320
sponsored

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
but i have to talk about it because it's

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,200
that important for the chronic allele i

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
mean when it comes down to like chronic

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
illness

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,040
pathogens are involved number one right

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,760
we don't have a lot of tools out there

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,879
a lot of tools that handle certain

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,440
pathogenic issues all right

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,600
and so propolis is a critical

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,600
piece that's missing out there now there

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,920
yeah there's propolis out there but

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,680
there's next level propolis which is an

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,719
entirely different thing now what i love

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,440
about

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,400
the vimergy propolis is because

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,520
sensitive people this is a big deal

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,520
people who are hypersensitive

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,439
their stomachs are sensitive they're

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,680
sensitive with neurological lyme they're

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,520
sensitive with lupus they're sensitive

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,759
with food allergies they're sensitive

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,320
with things

36
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,880
sensitivities

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,680
all these years so many people being

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,680
sensitive and then the propolis is all

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,880
being saturated in solvents and alcohol

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,720
out there

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,799
so over the years i'd be telling doctors

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,560
that person needs to be on propolis make

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,880
sure you get that patient with multiple

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,240
sclerosis neurological lyme with lupus

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,920
with all their aches and pains with

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,360
their tinnitus to vertigo all this

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,960
different stuff make sure you get that

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,159
patient on propolis but the problem has

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,920
always been this

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
different varieties of low-grade

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,119
horrible alcohol

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
right

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,960
and solvents

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,040
and solvents

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,320
and then low-grade propolis from bees

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,520
that aren't being taken care of

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,840
watched

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,280
right are cared for so this is a big

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
deal so

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,720
so i'm here to talk about propolis for a

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,239
little bit chronic illness aches and

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,000
pains all the different symptoms right

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,280
neurological symptoms all of it i'm

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,200
talking about propolis this is the

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,480
vimergy propolis right here

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,720
in my hand

67
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,360
i don't usually do this i don't usually

68
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,480
sit here this like this

69
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,920
ecstatic like excited because i know

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,640
breakthroughs when a breakthrough comes

71
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,760
and i'm all over it right all over it so

72
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,680
that's how that's how serious this is so

73
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,200
i'm actually really excited about this

74
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
so i just want to say

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,040
people say well vimergy is expensive

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,879
well it is because it's not

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
in the sense we're like for instance

78
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,360
this propolis right here it's only a

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,160
little over eight dollars an ounce

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,959
there's four ounces other propolises you

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,800
get the one ounce bottle

82
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,599
and it's 11

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,400
10 for one ounce

84
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,480
ten eleven dollars for one ounce

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,200
this is roughly around eight dollars

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,800
right around eight dollars for one ounce

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:19,360
but there's four ounces in the bottle so

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,239
this is a whole another level of quality

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,920
so it's almost four ounces quality

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
and then what it offers so i just want

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
to cover talk about proposed for a

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
little bit so pro what is proposed what

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,159
is it propolis what is it right

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
okay

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,239
this phytochemical compounds are resin

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,360
created and gathered by bees from tree

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,680
buds

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,879
so medicine

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,440
from trees medicine from tree buds right

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,360
that's how incredible it is okay

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,560
what it is essentially propolis is like

102
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,840
a glue

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,400
that the bee uses to take up spaces and

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,959
hives right like any air air coming

105
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,519
through the hives any open spaces so

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,840
what bees do is they take that resin and

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,720
they use it as a glue

108
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,519
to protect the nests that's what the

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,840
that's what the bees do okay

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,959
but here's the thing propolis harbors

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,040
medicine that's ahead ahead of everybody

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
it's a head of science and research

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,080
that's it like science can

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,160
tap into propolis and tap into propolis

115
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,919
and it's gonna take them decade after

116
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,919
decade to find out how many different

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,240
phytochemical compounds antioxidants

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,240
polyphenols that are in there now the

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,520
vimergy propolis

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,440
it's done in a way to preserve that

121
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,919
that those phytochemical compounds so

122
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,080
it's done in a way to preserve

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,120
the quercetin right to preserve the

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,919
crystalline but to preserve the glandine

125
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,240
the preserve these different incredible

126
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,960
phytochemical compounds

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,720
right and so that's the whole point it

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,960
preserves them

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,800
and then it preserves everything else in

130
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,680
that so there's entity the other thing

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,160
is there's no alcohol

132
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,240
that's a big deal alcohol destroys

133
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
the medicine and i've talked about this

134
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,160
you guys alcoholic tinctures i've talked

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,880
about this all the time so alcohol

136
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,639
tinctures alcohol destroys the medicine

137
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,080
now you may be like well this isn't nero

138
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
how interesting is this he's talking

139
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,600
about propolis

140
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,160
it makes or break people it makes or

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,720
breaks their healing process

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,240
with cold source herpes simplex that

143
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,840
gets into the body so i want to talk

144
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,240
about stuff

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,120
so i want to bring

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
this guy in front of me right now okay

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,880
and

148
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,639
let me just get

149
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,680
let me get this guy's

150
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,240
muscle

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,520
muscles removed here right

152
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,639
so the critical thing to understand here

153
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,280
is when it comes down

154
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,639
when it comes down to propolis right

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,560
here we are

156
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,479
all right

157
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,759
so when people get sick what are they

158
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,280
sick with

159
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,280
what's going on well they're sick with

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,840
pathogens that's the thing they're sick

161
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,720
with pathogens and they got the toxins

162
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,120
right

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,400
pathogens and toxins you guys just came

164
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
on here we're talking about about

165
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,000
propolis but we're not talking about

166
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,800
just any propolis talking about a break

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,080
breakthrough in propolis and i've been

168
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,919
waiting my whole life for this

169
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,080
breakthrough i'm just letting you know

170
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,919
i'm not sponsored i'm not an ambassador

171
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,080
to the company

172
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,479
i'm not an mlm person

173
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,479
this is an impairment thing this isn't a

174
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,160
game this is about the chronically ill

175
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,280
this is about being sick and this is

176
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
about

177
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,680
about companies and this one

178
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,919
specifically that broke the mold they

179
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,800
went above and beyond so this is an

180
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,720
exciting time for people who are sick

181
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,319
so when it comes down to cranial nerves

182
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
cranial nerves get inflamed because of

183
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,120
pathogens that's one of the things that

184
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,840
inflames cranial nerves okay and that's

185
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
your trigeminal nerve right that's your

186
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,599
vagus nerves

187
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,560
right hypoglossal nerve

188
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,160
okay

189
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,759
so these are some of the vestibular

this is the propolis we've been waiting

228
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,680
for it's that big of a deal

229
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,280
right

230
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,960
so deborah says does this help with

231
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,560
neurological symptoms and that's on

232
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,759
facebook deborah yes and that's the

233
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,680
whole point

234
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,519
it's for things like this and that's

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,680
what people are suffering from so i want

236
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,320
to talk about like okay let me just give

237
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,880
you some tips here cold sores

238
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,760
putting propolis on cold sores and fever

239
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,519
blisters and canker sores

240
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,320
that alone

241
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,200
is amazing when you have a propolis you

242
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
can actually dab onto cold sores

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,959
to kill

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,519
the bug to help the immune system to

245
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,320
help the immune cells right that's a big

246
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,080
deal

247
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,680
so people get the cold source and the

248
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,080
cold sore virus sits inside the

249
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,920
trigeminal nerve it sits in people and

250
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,800
so what i love about this

251
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,399
is people can do you

252
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,320
talk to your doctor or what you can do

253
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,279
but what i recommend friends and family

254
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
okay

255
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,080
anybody that has anything going on if

256
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,399
they had a cold sore that means they

257
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,040
still have the fever blister cold sore

258
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,880
the simplex in their system if they have

259
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,320
ebv they still have it in their system

260
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,480
if they have these bugs they still have

261
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,519
in their system this is something to be

262
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,519
taken every single day

263
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,480
there's the propolises out there are

264
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,399
harsh

265
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,959
they're harsh you guys

266
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,560
they got solvents in them and alcohol in

267
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,680

268
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,640
we're live on we're live on uh

269
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,680

we're live on youtube facebook we're

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,959
live on rumble we're live on a whole

272
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,000
bunch of different blood words telegram

273
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
of course

274
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,959
so

275
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,720
people don't realize is that the

276
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,560
propolis is out there

277
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,040
they're weak there's alcohol and

278
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,480
solvents in there there's nothing like

279
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,959
this right here out there if you just

280
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,360
came on here this isn't an mlm thing i'm

281
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,360
not an ambassador to this company

282
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,800
and i'm not sponsored it's just that

283
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,120
when something comes out that that's

284
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,560
incredible it's about the chronic it's

285
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,399
about the chronic allele and it's about

286
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,399
moving the needle it's about and that's

287
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,240
what's critical about moving the needles

288
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,760
i'm talking about dosages here what you

289
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
could do

290
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,560
so

291
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,480
if you do get this talk to your doctor

292
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,040
on how you can take it but this is for

293
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,959
extra sensitive people people who can't

294
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,360
even take supplements

295
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,720
and people who have so much inflammation

296
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
in the nerves and everything else and

297
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,680
it's good for anybody and good for their

298
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,480
anybody's immune system

299
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,880
but it's gentle on the stomach which is

300
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,680
a whole nother thing all on its own it

301
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,240
doesn't have the alcohol

302
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,480
it's like a liquid gold is what it is

303
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,399
for what people what what's happening in

304
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,920
people's bodies right now it's really

305
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,760
really remarkable so i'm going to cover

306
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,880
a little bit more about this

307
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,640
so

308
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,920
this isn't just

309
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,519
a game

310
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,040
where people realize supplement

311
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,680
companies and supplements it's really

312
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,120
kind of a big part of it it's a game

313
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,480
it's really what it is you get the cheap

314
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,279
crap you bottle it up you mark it up and

315
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,160
you bank that's what's done out there

316
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,839
the difference between like vimergy is

317
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,440
they actually care about the chronic leo

318
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,519
i know because i've reached out to them

319
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,040
years ago i've become friends with them

320
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
and i told you that guys just like i try

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,120
to become friends with all the

322
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,200
supplement companies out there but they

323
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,600
don't stay with with their they don't

324
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,920
stay on course they always just go no

325
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
it's about the dollar sorry aw i don't

326
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,959
care about your chronically ill people

327
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,320
we're going to bottle up what we need to

328
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,880
bottle up because we're all about

329
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,240
numbers and figures i'm fine done with

330
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
you man

331
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
but

332
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,720
with vimorgy it's all about okay what

333
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,720
can we do

334
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,200
so this is the kind of people that that

335
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,200
i want a relationship with so i've been

336
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,839
friends with because and they're like

337
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,160
what what do people need

338
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,760
what do they need to heal and so they

339
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,600
put out

340
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,360
a probe list just like all their

341
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,639
incredible stuff right they put out a

342
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,480
probe list

343
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,839
it changes everything because when it

344
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,200
comes down to the whole pathogen thing

345
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,560
people have to if okay if you don't

346
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,000
believe you have a pathogen but you

347
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,160
believe you have a parasite then believe

348
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,560
you have a parasite fine

349
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,240
but i would still be taking propolis

350
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,600
you know that's what i would do so if i

351
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
had a friend was like well i got

352
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,519
parasites that's what i got well then

353
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,880
promopolis is what you need lumicali

354
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:34,079
says can it help with chronic sinusitis

355
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,440
chronic sinusitis is the streptococcus

356
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,200
right it's a lot of different strep

357
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,639
varieties a lot of people carry strep

358
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,160
people carry five different six

359
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,000
different straps in them ten different

360
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,399
straps in them that come up along the

361
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,160
way we go to a public bathroom we pick

362
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,360
up another one off a toilet seat it's

363
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,680
just life here on planet earth right

364
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,920
so propolis is incredible for like

365
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,040
streptococcus for e coli all the

366
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,440
different bacteria c diff each pylori

367
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,120
and it's easy on the stomach people have

368
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,120
stomach ulcers and stuff because

369
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,279
bacteria is eating their ulcers the

370
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
propolis is something that can battle

371
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,880
that so what i'm right now what i've

372
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,120
been doing right now between everything

373
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,959
else on my busy schedule is i'm like i'm

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,079
people so if you guys just came on we're

381
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,160
talking about propolis we're talking

382
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,360
about neurological symptoms too we're

383
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,279
talking about

384
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,680
fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome

385
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,120
psoriatic arthritis yeah psoriatic

386
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,200
arthritis r.a hashimoto's thyroiditis

hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism we're

388
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,760
talking about all the different symptoms

389
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,680
right

390
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
and then you've got the flus

391
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,199
right that are going around that keep on

392
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,240
coming around

393
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,000
i won't name any names of flus or

394
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,160
anything but the flues that keep on

395
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,320
coming around

396
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,079
so

397
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,360
these things really matter

398
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,519
when you think about it for immune

399
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,279
system and everything else right

400
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,639
so

401
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,320
so cindy lou actually that's not true

402
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,639
that's the cindy lou that's actually not

403
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
true

404
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
not without the solvents i'm just

405
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,279
letting you know singular by the way

406
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,560
good to see you because i know you leave

407
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,320
a lot of youtube comments i read them

408
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,760
all the time um yeah it it's yeah people

409
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,079
are misled

410
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,920
so what you said right there i told it

411
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,760
very interesting what you said

412
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,279
but here's how it works

413
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,600
there's no propolis out there that

414
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,440
haven't been involved with solvents

415
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,120
no problemosis it's the only one to this

416
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,959
day

417
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
and the other ones will stay alcohol

418
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,839
free

419
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
but they're not

420
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,959
solvent free

421
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,360
and they're hidden alcohols that's how

422
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,199
it's done with propolis

423
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,040
this is the only one

424
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,240
first time in our history where they

425
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,399
said no

426
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,839
we're not gonna hide anything we're not

427
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,760
gonna hide the solvents we're not gonna

428
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,199
hide the alcohol we're not gonna hide

429
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,120
anything and we're gonna make sure we

430
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,720
can do it without that and that's it

431
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,079
santara's healing good to see you so

432
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,160
excited to get this protocol thanks for

433
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,639
always looking out for us

434
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,279
yeah it and you can taste it when you

435
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,000
get when you do a hit of it you know

436
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,279
what's going on it's 120 milligrams per

437
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,720
serving of this propolis okay

438
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,600
right and it contains 50 of its active

439
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,279
polyphenols okay

440
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,760
that's a big deal

441
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,079
that's a really big deal no propolis

442
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,800
company can actually say

443
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,959
that they contain up to 50 percent of

444
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,120
active polyphenols i don't care what

445
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,120
propolis company it is with propolis

446
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,279
product they can't say it and they can't

447
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,720
say they did it without involving

448
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,000
solvents

449
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,399
they can't

450
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,839
that's the difference right here

451
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,399
that's the difference if you just came

452
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,560
on i'm not an mlm multi-level marketing

453

about that i'm not an ambassador

458
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,639

and it's and i'm not into pyramid

460
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,079
schemes i'm into just making sure

461
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,920
there's good stuff out there for the

462
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,600
chronicle and that matters for what's

463
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,519
happening now neurological symptoms and

464
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,360
i told you guys it's it's exploding i

465
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,240
remember when i gave you a warning about

466
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,759
this

467
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,680
about all the neurological symptoms

468
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,839
ticks spasms

469
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,880
fatigue aches and pains blurry eyes

470
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,040
dizziness vertigo right burning skin

471
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,120
pain in the jaw neck face trigeminal

472
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,639
neuralgia right fibromyalgia all the

473
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,560
different neurological symptoms i told

474
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,000
you guys that in the heart palpitations

475
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,480
that are neurological and i told you

476
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,440
guys neurological symptoms are exploding

477
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,759
like never before so when you see like

478
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,440
darkness happen out there because it's

479
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,560
what it is like darkness and you see

480
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,160
everybody just getting sick with

481
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,399
neurological symptoms and then things

482
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,000
come from the light so then there's the

483
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,519
light that helps to battle the darkness

484
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,320
and that's the difference right so what

485
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,639
it this is it's a light tool basically

486
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,079
babyum says yo aw hey

487
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,959
i was alone in a real dark place with my

488
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,319
symptoms and illness then i found you

489
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,480

you know

493
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,039
because basically what happens and

494
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,000
you're on youtube right there right and

495
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,079
uh

496
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,919
basically what happens fabian is people

497
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,600
don't know what that's like if they

498
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,000
haven't been into that dark they haven't

499
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,760
been in that dark place

500
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and they haven't been there so just know

501
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,199
that you're a survivor and a monitor

502
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,039
here

503
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,880
so someone's asking on tick tock so how

504
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,400
can this help fibromyalgia so first of

505
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
all let's talk about fibromyalgia

506
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,039
fiber fibromyalgia

507
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,280
are inflamed nerves inflamed because of

508
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,919
pathogens epstein-barr is the

509
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,720
inflammation creator of fibromyalgia so

510
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,720
if you're somebody with fibro right

511
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,960
and you just your your shoulders are

512
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,039
sore you can't bump into a wall you

513
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,080
can't just go and bump into a wall right

514
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,080
here like that you can't do that

515
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,160
because what happens with fibromyalgia

516
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,039
you get the pain and you get the pain in

517
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,960
the elbows like it just rings in here

518
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,480
rings in the shoulders you can get

519
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,080
fibromyalgia where you just hurt

520
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,080
everywhere you wake up in the morning

521
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,320
and you're so sore and you just you're

522
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,280
in pain if you push it too far

523
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,400
everything hurts those are neurotoxins

524
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,760
floating around because of the

525
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,080
epstein-barr virus that's what

526
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,440
fibromyalgia is and medical medium

527
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,039
published it first and now science

528
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,039
researchers starting to say hey

529
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,240
epstein-barr causes everything now well

530
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,919
you made fun of me for saying

531
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,840
epstein-barr causes so many things and

532
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,280
now you're taking the info

533
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,760
but fibromyalgia is because of

534
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,400
epstein-barr right

535
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,400
this is an antiviral

536
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,880
okay

537
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,200
anti-viral

538
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,360
powerful tool right anti-viral

539
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
anti-bacterial but anti-viral

540
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,080
so

541
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,799
it's one of those things where

542
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,960
but it but it's

543
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,919
affordable but it's also gentle

544
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,160
that's the difference it's gentle

545
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,080
and it's the only one

546
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,240
that didn't get run through run through

547
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,840
the ringer of solvents

548
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,880
and the alcohols and the hidden alcohols

549
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,240
no natural flavors no hidden natural

550
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,919
flavors which is happening in all the

551
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,679
supplements now you guys

552
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,080
so this company won't do anything like

553
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,919
that but what happens is that other

554
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,480
companies they hide now all the natural

555
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,400
flavors because medical medium

556
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,080
said that natural flavors has the msg

557
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,280
that's what msg is right it's natural

558
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,440
flavors mm info for years now

559
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,039
and so what happens is so now supplement

560
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,360
companies are they're they're all

561
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,880
nervous oh that medical medium ruined it

562
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,960
for us we put natural flavors in

563
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,640
everything with msg

564
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,039
and so we better hide that now so

565
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
they're hiding it so what's happening is

566
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,400
supplement companies in the tincture

567
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,559
bottles are hiding all their stuff and

568
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,000
in the propolis world

569
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,799
they're infamous for hiding solvents and

570
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,440
hiding alcohol

571
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,720
so this is the first propolis of its

572
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,200
time

573
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,000
in this day right now in time in history

574
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,200
right here i'm marking this literally as

575
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,320
one of those freedom power empowerment

576
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,640
you know times in history

577
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,280
for the chronically ill

578
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,720
and so that's a big deal so let me talk

579
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,159
about how you can even use it you can

580
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,679
put it in a shot glass right there you

581
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,280

582
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,440
too so i'll put a little bit of water in

583
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,720
the shot glass right that's one way to

584
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,799

what i love for people i tell people

598
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,240
people with the worst kanger source of

599
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,919
cold search you know how you get the

600
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,679
kinky sores on the tongue so many people

601
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,200
get that where their tongue is hurting

602
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,320
all those little hot spots on their

603
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,640
tongue

605
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,200
so that's just one thing right there

606
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,080

you can take it as a daily

608
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,120
daily part of your regimen

609
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,080
to slowly knock down pathogens

610
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,440
so that other symptoms eventually go

611
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,400
away it's one of those tools that's what

612
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,000
it is

613
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,520
courtney may good to see you i saw you

614
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,120

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,520
caught the live right now because you

617
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,120
always say i missed alive

618
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,960
so

619
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,200
donna short just ordered mine still

620
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,200
confused as to what it does and why so

621
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,880
important okay so so donna when it comes

622
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,039
down to the immune system propolis is

623
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,360
one of those critical key

624
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,280
tools for the immune system

625
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,000
it does different things for the immune

626
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,080
cells immune cells feed on phytochemical

627
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,240
compounds that's how it works so

628
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,400
propolis harbors

629
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,159
phytochemical compounds

630
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,039
certain polyphenols and other

631
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,799
phytochemical compounds any antioxidants

632
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,919
that the the immune system gobbles up

633
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,440
like candy so your immune cells

634
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,760
lymphocytes basophils monocytes

635
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,039
neutrophils your immune cells right your

636
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,799
white count

637
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,520
gobbles up

638
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,360
these phytochemical compounds

639
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,919
that the bees produced

640
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,080
strengthening

641
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,600
the immune system strengthening it

642
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,000
turning it into like one of those

643
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,000
superpowers so when the strep throat

644
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,520
comes you got the streptococcus when you

645
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,360
got the acne because it's all

646
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,840
streptococcus

647
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,400
you're using a tool that starts to feed

648
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,880
your immune system

649
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,840
but it does more than that

650
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,520
bugs don't like propolis so bugs in our

651
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,280
system that keep us sick don't like

652
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,880
propolis on any level they don't like

653
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,400
propolis

654
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,840
propolis

655
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,919
hampers bugs down it hampers bugs down

656
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,200
it knocks bugs down and that's what it

657
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,200
does

658
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,480
so that's how propolis works now you can

659
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,000
talk to your doctor what's right for you

660
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,520
but i'm recommending to all friends and

661
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,720
family the whole bit i'm going to take a

662
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,720
little propolis shot right now

663
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,919
amazing

664
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,200
and provost is incredible you can use it

665
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,679
straight in your mouth

666
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,960
you know no problem

667
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,960
if you want if you want

668
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,880
but

669
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,320
what i like to do

670
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,720
and i tell people

671
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,760
you can put a dropper full in the mouth

672
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,280
and let it stay in there if you need to

673
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,640
and that's one thing someone can do but

674
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,320
taking it with water is a great way to

675
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,159
do it ask your doctor what's right for

676
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,080
you make sure you ask your doctor if

677
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,280
it's okay to you know take propolis if

678
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,120
you do

679
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,600
venture into it

680
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,679

intestinal tract problems too but they

687
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,600
can't take a supplement so you've got to

688
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,200
take the ones that count or the ones

689
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,760

715
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,960
bit well i want to show you one other

716
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,400
thing too that i forgot about the msm

717
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,200
i'm so excited about the propolis i

718
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,039
can't even i can't even

719
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,960
wait can't remember the msm for the

720
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,039
moment i brought it here

721
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,600
so that's the msm with calcium and

722
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,279
silica so anybody who's into msm right

723
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,559
franks and pains and joint problems and

724
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,960
all that other stuff and connective

725
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,000
tissue problems like connective tissue

726
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,039
all that

727
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,520
right and hair skin nails

728
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,080
hair skin and nail supplements right

729
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,880
skin like skin and nail supplements

730
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,159
right they don't work so when when you

731
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,039
go out there and you want to buy hair

732
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,559
skin nail supplement they don't work

733
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,320
i'm just letting you know i've talked

734
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,760
about that so many times for a lot of

735
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,880
reasons because of the quality and

736
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,960
everything else

737
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,120
anyway there's the silica there's the

738
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,000
msm product right for there for anybody

739
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,320
that's that likes msm that uses them msm

740
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,559
it's the best there is out there and

741
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,799
vimergy put silica with it and put a

742
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,799
little calcium with it they balance it

743
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,960
out right and it's the highest quality

744
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,360
msm out there so that's something else

759
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,919
you guys you know you know what's crazy

760
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,039
is that

761
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,039
is that

762
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,440
