00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,040
members because of being sick meaning

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,520
like you you just either you know you

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
just had difficulties in relationships i

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,960
know so many people they they have

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,040
relationships and their relationships

59
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,079
fall apart because someone's sick in the

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
in the relationship and it's so sad i

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,920
watched that for years

62
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
you know i mean so many times i've

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,840
watched that

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,120
and so health is just so important and

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,640
right now it's critical

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,879
to keep our immune system strong because

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,040
our immune systems get weakened and

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,200
beaten down that's how the system's set

69
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,920
up the system is set up to beat us down

70
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,360
to beat us down to beat us down even the

71
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,200
time change

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
just so you know you guys the whole time

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
change the whole time the one hour time

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,800
shift

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,160
that's actually to throw us off our game

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,920
and weaken our immune systems and

77
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,080
destabilize us that's what that is i'm

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,160
going to talk about that one day i've

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,599
been saying this for years but

80
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,720
i'm going to go into details on that if

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,840
you guys just came on here we're talking

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,040
about the liver we're talking about the

83
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,599
liver's immune system we're talking

84
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,400
about the skin conditions of liver

85
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,440
including acne we're talking about

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,319
emotions when you have a sick liver

87
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,720
things can get heated up emotional

88
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,040
emotional yellow rings true it's true

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,159
michelle l you said you knew

90
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,560
yeah

91
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,640
yeah the time change is not supposed to

92
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,319
happen they're not supposed to do the

93
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,560
time change

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,040
that's not any natural occurrence that's

95
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
control that's that's because

96
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,319
that's all about controlling the human

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,080
race

98
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,519
and weakening them because the time

99
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,519
chain change stresses people out gets

100
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
them sick that's what it does that's

101
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,480
what they do that's the whole point it's

102
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,080
actually to knock people down

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,560
they try to try to knock you down

104
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,479

system let viruses take over let let

172
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,319
pathogens take over break down your

173
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,000

thousands and thousands of people

187
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,360
chronic illness end up dying from

188
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,319

this book

410
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,360
is that what people don't realize

411
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,240
about

412
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,720
our liver is when it becomes toxic

413
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,120
we become toxic

414
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,000
when the liver becomes toxic our brain

415
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,519
becomes toxic when your liver becomes

416
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,680
toxic your brain

417
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,240
becomes toxic

418
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,000
because when your liver gets backed up

419
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,160
because that's your filter

420
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,360
your brain

421
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,160

506
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,679
the whole thing about pandas is what

507
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,240
people don't really understand is that

508
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,160
it's not just streptococcus pandas is

509
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,880
more than streptococcus

510
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,640
streptococcus is a co-factor in pan with

511
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,000
pandas and that's what people don't

512
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,440

513
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,480

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,440

it's been a lot for so many

540
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,799
if you guys just came on and tick tock

541
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,559
if you just came on on telegram

542
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,080
this came on youtube we're talking about

543
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,840
the liver we're talking about emotional

544
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,160
liver we're talking about what happens

545
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,520
when our liver gets stagnant and

546
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,000
sluggish it poisons our brain

547
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,799
the liver is supposed to hold on to the

548
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,280
poisons and toxins until we give it a

549
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,360
chance to safely guide it out

550
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,520
so what liver rescue is it's a way to

551
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,039
safely guide out poisons and toxins in a

552
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,280
way that can be really helpful so

553
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,280
someone can get that liver cleaned up

554
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,039
right but everybody walks around with

555
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,360
these toxic livers and then the brain

556
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,360
gets intoxicated and when the brain gets

557
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,799
intoxicated then we all of a sudden end

558
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,880
up getting blood draws that's a whole

559
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,760
nother thing all on its own julie said

560
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,520

so what happens is that when your liver

587
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,400
gets toxic like that okay

588
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,640
when that happens we get triggered easy

589
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
because the brain gets saturated so keep

590
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,320
that in mind

591
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,679
the brain gets saturated so everybody's

592
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,440
saying me

593
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,600
right there i see on tik tok everybody's

594
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,440
saying me it happens to me it happens to

595
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,280
me there too on youtube

596
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,520
allison so

597
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,799
we go through this thing where we can

598
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,960
get unstable right we feel unstable we

599
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,919
don't feel strong

600
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,480
like we just don't feel strong

601
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,480
we feel like we can break easy you guys

602
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,039
ever feel that you feel like you could

603
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,919
break easy you feel like you you're not

604
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,320
strong you feel like you're not tough or

605
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,240
something or you're you're sensitive but

606
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,080
you're not you are strong and that's the

607
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,320
whole thing people don't realize just

608
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,240
because if you don't feel strong and you

609
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,080
don't feel confident about your your

610
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,679
health and your health strength

611
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,840
it doesn't mean you're not the strongest

612
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,919
person out there people with chronic

613
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,679
illness and symptoms and conditions are

614
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,320
the strong ones

615
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,799
they're the strong ones but but yet it's

616
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,200
easy to get triggered because you're

617
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,120
bearing so much

618
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,679
and that's what people don't realize

619
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,840
when your liver gets all toxic

620
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,000
and sluggish right

621
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,280
it gets toxic and sluggish

622
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,480
and tired and stagnant

623
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,720
all the toxins go into the brain

624
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,120
and then if you already have

625
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,640
symptoms and conditions you're already

626
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,640
sensitive

627
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,799
you're already struggling so you can be

628
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,320
triggered easier and then you can feel

629
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,520
like you're not a strong person you

630
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,600
could feel like you're not strong and

631
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,640
then people around you're like oh

632
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,320
you know

633
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,159
god there goes your symptoms again and

634
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,320
there goes your problems again i mean

635
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,200
while you're the strongest person

636
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,520
because look what you're bearing

637
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,400
it's hard to have a symptom and

638
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,520
condition and be struggling so when

639
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,919
someone

640
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,520
like you guys and people i know are

641
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,679
struggling with something you need to

642
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,760
know how strong you really are even if

643
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,440
you get triggered easy and feel like

644
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,120
you're weak

645
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,520
you're not weak

646
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,520
because guess what people out there who

647
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,360
seem strong who don't have a symptom and

648
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,400
condition if they were sick they would

649
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,400
fall the heck apart

650
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,360
i can't tell you how many times i've

651
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,120
heard from people like oh my god

652
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,120
my husband got sick for the first time

653
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,400
in his life and he's crying like a baby

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,000
thing he's bawling and he can't handle

659
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,440

660
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,799
i mean people with chronic heal i hear

661
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,919
that all the time people with chronic

662
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,600
illness

663
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,880
symptoms and conditions are really the

664
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,039
strong ones

665
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,520
but then but we don't feel strong we

666
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,159
feel weak we feel kicked down we feel

667
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,919
not confident right on telegram you guys

670
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,080
and you feel you feel kind of weakened

671
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,559
but really you're strong but what

672
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,720
happens is you get triggered easy

673
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,240
because the liver is all

674
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,799
dirtied up

675
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,720
it's all filled with toxins

676
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,159
diana says i remember i started becoming

677
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,280
emotional around 25 i used to control my

678
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,640
emotions really well before

679
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,200
yeah

680
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,120
what happens is the liver gets

681
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
all clogged up

682
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,679
we get some symptoms

683
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,240
we get triggered easy because the brain

684
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,720
gets filled up with stuff

685
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,720
that's why because the brain gets filled

686
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,080
up with stuff the brain gets filled up

687
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,679
with copper that's a big one right there

688
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,240
copper

689
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,799
so much copper we get into our brain

690
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,559
toxic copper everybody's everybody's in

691
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,400
touch with toxic copper it's everywhere

692
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,880
it's coming out of air fresheners it's

693
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,799
in colognes and perfumes toxic copper is

694
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
everywhere it fills up in the liver

695
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,960
right

696
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,440
everybody gets filled up with aluminum

697
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,039
fluoride treatments anybody

698
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,720
fluoride treatments

699
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,480
anybody have a fluoride treatment it

700
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,039
builds up in the liver and builds up in

701
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,440
the liver and the next thing you know it

702
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,600
that fluoride treatment finally hits the

703
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,679
brain and now you're you get triggered

704
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,679
easy emotionally

705
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,840
emotionally then you get blamed in your

706
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,200
relationship if you're in a relationship

707
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,720
if you're not in a relationship you get

708
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,240
blamed by a friend if you're not in a

709
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,679
relationship you get blamed by a family

710
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,600
member but if you're in a relationship

711
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,200
you get blamed by the other person in

712
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,760
the relationship

713
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,559
you're just way too emotional

714
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,640
yeah it's her fault she's the problem

715
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,320
she's the one causing all this

716
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,159
and then you're at counseling you're at

717
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,919
marriage counseling or partner

718
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,440

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,760
happens is that

760
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,919
our livers get clogged up and stagnant

761
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,840
and they get all these things in there

i believe it i believe it

768
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,960
and we get all these pathogens inside

769
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,200
the liver and it builds up and the

770
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,200
pathogens are eating things in the liver

inside the liver

774
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,400
and then

775
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,240
all that stuff comes barreling out of

776
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,799

826
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,000
this for thousands of years

827
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,480
sarah arvetta hasn't been teaching this

828
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,640

829
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,080

834
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
i got

835
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,640
majorly duped by ayurvedic doctors and

836
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,480
so has

837
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,840
thousands of other people and thousands

838
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,000
of the people that came to see me in my

839
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,960
office over the last 30 years

840
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,200
so yeah it's no disrespect i know some

841
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,720
cool air vetted doctors ayurvedic

842
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,720
doctors that are really cool it's just

843
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,480
that ayurvedic medicine didn't know

844
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,360
about pathogens so they didn't know

845
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,840
about

846
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,120
viruses ever they didn't know that

847
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,799
epstein-barr causes fibromyalgia and

848
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,520
epstein-barr feeds off of copper and

849
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,720
causes eczema so for thousands of years

850
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,360
ayurvedic medicine didn't know that

851
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,240
there's no disrespect it's just fact

852
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,080
ayurvedic medicine talked about

853
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,240
talked about other things

854
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,240
but and they didn't talk about the liver

855
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,720
overflowing with poisons and toxins

856
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,159
either saturating the brain and causing

857
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,360
emotional triggers that's not ayurvedic

858
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,679
um

859
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,480
kirsten says ayurveda is a good

860
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,279
philosopher but this is now exactly it's

861
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,080

said something about ayurveda

873
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,159
ayurveda is evil and i know that from

874
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,080
experience because i paid thousands to

875
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,480
study arvetta before finding medical

876
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,760
medium divine light so glad to have you

877
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,840
here

878
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,360
truly

879
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,240
um

880
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,760
the whole thing too is is with ayurveda

881
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,159
some you know

882
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,840
ayurvedic doctor actually i know as a

883
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,240
friend of mine who says i'm gonna go do

884
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,440
a a gee cleanse a geek cleanse i'm like

885
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,320
uh

886
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,240
you can't cleanse with that because your

887
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,799
your gallbladder and your liver are

888
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,640
going to produce bile to try to break it

889
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,679
down and it's like what do you mean it's

890
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,600
like

891
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,279
you're gonna have to produce a ton of

892
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,039
bile to break it down so your liver

893
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,960
won't cleanse because it's in production

894
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,039
of bile it's like what ayurveda doesn't

895
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,799
know that i'm like here vetted doesn't

896
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,640

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,559
hope you're okay because dr nesbit just

934
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,360
came out of surgery right now

935
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,960
and dr nesbitt's here

936
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,960
by the way if you don't know dr nesbitt

937
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,159
he's a board-certified surgeon

938
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,799
he's a board-certified psychiatrist dr

939
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,799
nesbitt is a board-certified

940
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,799
he says he doesn't like ayurvedic

941
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,120
medicine or betta but then he says he

942
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,120
does like he he says he says he does

943
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,799
like it a little bit he says that he ate

944
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,039
a whole bunch of ghee

945
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,880
for dinner and he threw up

946
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,480
and he said that he felt better after he

947
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,240
vomited the ghee up

948
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,840
dr nesbitt the one thing about doctor

949
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,799
nesbi you need to know that he does

950
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,159
drink

951
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,159
then he drinks when he's performing

952
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,519
surgeries

953
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,279
dr nesbitt just performed a spleenectomy

954
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,720
and he said that he only had two shots

955
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,279
of whiskey before he performed the

956
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,039
splenectomy

957
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,039
he had a martini and two shots of

958
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,320
whiskey and he says he he wants to give

959
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,159
advice since he's a board-certified

960
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,240
surgeon psychiatrist he says don't mix

961
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,799
martinis and whiskey together he says it

962
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,039
was a bad concoction

963
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,240
i won't tell him that part what

964
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,399
i'm not going to tell them what else she

965
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,600
did no because somebody might need

966
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,440
surgery

967
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,000
one day and they might end up because

968
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,720
their health plan sticks them in your

969
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,720
way and you

970
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,120
all right i think i'm going to have to

971
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,039
put dr nesbitt back dr nesbitt likes

972
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,240
liver rescue though so i'm just gonna i

973
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,080
don't know if that's helping right

974
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,640
helping me right now dr nesbitt if you

975
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,960
like liver rescue i got it dr nesman has

976
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,080
to go back into surgery april 10. dr

977
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,880
nesbit came out

978
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,559
um

979
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,760
okay mthfr gene mutation

980
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,760
okay lose some of you guys

981
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,080
you know what it is

982
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,560
humor having a sense of humor

983
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,440
having some joy in the heart being able

984
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,919
to laugh a little it's really important

985
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,839
really important and that's not

986
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:20,800
that information that's in humankind for

987
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,079
centuries and centuries and centuries

988
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,480
that that's that's in human nature

989
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,280
that's human design laugh a little you

990
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,560
got to find some humor it really matters

991
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,280
so let's go into here we're in

992
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,359
methylation right now

993
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,879
methylation is an important topic

994
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,800
because what you'll find is you'll be

995
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,760
tricked into the methylation problem

996
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,040
right

997
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,159
you'll be told you have this gene

998
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,399
mutation

999
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,320
or mthfr gene mutation so that's the

1000
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,639
whole thing with with what's happening

1001
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,159
so you got an mthfr gene mutation that's

1002
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,839
what the blood test shows but there's a

1003
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,639
couple important things to understand

1004
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,320
they don't actually see a gene mutation

1005
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,280
very important to know

1006
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,400
okay

1007
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,720
a gene mutation

1008
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,079
cannot be fixed if you have a mutated

1009
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,160
gene

1010
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,280
it can't be fixed

1011
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:13,119
so if you have a mutated gene

1012
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,480
it's not fixable it's your genes

1013
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,240
right

1014
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,280
and that's where i scratch my head

1015
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,680
because thousands of people have done

1016
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,200
medical medium information

1017
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,119
and then

1018
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,680
go to their doctors

1019
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,040
and then their doctor says we don't know

1020
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,119
why

1021
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,760
but we think we misdiagnosed you because

1022
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,079
you don't have a gene mutation anymore

1023
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,280
because it's not showing up that you

1024
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,280
have the mthfrg mutation

1025
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,359
and so the patient is like well that

1026
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,280
doesn't make any sense

1027
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,720
if i have this gene mutation the doctor

1028
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,839
says i don't know why that happens

1029
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,599
either

1030
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,200
it doesn't make any sense either so we

1031
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,880
think we diagnosed you so that means

1032
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,839
that your gene mutation test must have

1033
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,200
been

1034
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,280
it must have been

1035
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,560
you know a pro must have been

1036
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,400
false or fake or you know not right so

1037
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,520
what happens is that

1038
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,640
mth

1039
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,200
mthfr gene mutations can always be fixed

1040
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,680
once you clean up the liver

1041
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,000
and know how to heal

1042
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,760
you can get rid of the mthfr gene

1043
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
mutation

1044
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,040
okay because it's not genetic that's

1045
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,640
really important to know so

1046
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,640
what i'll give you a rundown too on the

1047
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,280
gene mutation test the gene mutation

1048
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,680
test is an inflammatory marker test

1049
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,680
they should have never named it a gene

1050
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,359
mutation test

1051
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,680
they should have named it

1052
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:42,000
an inflammatory marker test because just

1053
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:45,520
like the antinuclear antigen test a a

1054
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,640
just like the c-reactive protein test

1055
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,240
the mthfr gene mutation test is the same

1056
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,480
thing

1057
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:58,320
it's just an inflammation test it's not

1058
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:02,800
an actual gene mutation they don't see a

1059
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,800
gene mutation under the microscope

1060
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,720
they see elevated inflammation

1061
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:15,040
it's a theory that you have a g mutation

1062
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,920
so the mthfr gene mutation theory

1063
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,920
is a theory

1064
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,200
stating

1065
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,560
that

1066
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,920
you have a gene mutation when really you

1067
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,280
just have elevated inflammation

1068
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,040
and they're using an inflammation test

1069
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,839
that they're calling

1070
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,040
a gene mutation

1071
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,400
test and that's what why it's all

1072
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,839
screwed up

1073
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,079
it's rigged

1074
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,079
it's just an inflammation test that's

1075
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,240
why you can reverse it

1076
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,040
you can't reverse

1077
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,240
an actual gene

1078
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,680
that's the way it is your gene

1079
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,040
stays the way it is if that's your gene

1080
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,839
it can't be

1081
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,440
changed it can't be reversed

1082
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,880
okay

1083
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,440
you can't

1084
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,599
sit there like if you don't like your

1085
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,720
nose

1086
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,720
if you don't like your nose

1087
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,839
you can't

1088
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,599
change that

1089
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,760
unless you go unless you do cosmetic

1090
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,960
surgery but you can't change your nose

1091
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,320
okay

1092
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,520
if you have

1093
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,520
a mutated gene

1094
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,760
then you can't change the gene you can't

1095
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,320
change yourself genetically

1096
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,320
it doesn't happen gene mutation test is

1097
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,000
a theory they call it a gene mutation

1098
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,920
test when it's really an inflammatory

1099
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
marker just like c-reactive protein or a

1100
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,400
a anti-nuclear antigen test

1101
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,240
that's why when people do medical medium

1102
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,240
they get rid of their mthfr g mutation

1103
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,240
they get rid of it too many thousands

1104
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,599
and tens of thousands millions of liver

1105
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,119
rescues

1106
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,720
sold around the world

1107
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,839
in almost every country in the on the

1108
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,480
planet just so you know

1109
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:04,720
doctors steal liver rescue information

1110
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,960
and then run ads on all the social media

1111
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,599
channels selling their products taking

1112
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,160
out the information in here and using it

1113
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,000
for themselves without citing it

1114
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,520
this is one of the most popular books in

1115
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,320
the world

1116
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,800
it's saved countless lives

1117
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,599
and an overburdened sluggish liver with

1118
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,079
a low gra low-grade infection like

1119
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,680
epstein-barr or shingles

1120
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,079
a sluggish stagnant liver with a

1121
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,200
low-grade infection like epstein-barr

1122
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,000
shingles

1123
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,839
okay

1124
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,480
is the real cause

1125
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,520
of inflammation markers ringing off both

1126
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,680
a a c-reactive protein mthfr gene

1127
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,000
mutation and neurological and

1128
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,560
neurological line

1129
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,960
and neurological line

1130
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,119
really important enough

1131
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,119
so

1132
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,359
so it's critical to understand so when

1133
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,280
you go to your doctor do what your

1134
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,480
doctor says okay i'm just telling you

1135
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,800
you can bring this information to your

1136
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,280
doctor you go to your doctor and he

1137
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,200
tells you you have a gene mutation

1138
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,440
really you don't he just did an

1139
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,960
inflammation test now you think your

1140
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,040
genes are screwed up so now you think

1141
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
you just have bad genes now you think

1142
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,560
your son's jeans are messed up you think

1143
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,079
your daughter's jeans are messed up you

1144
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,880
think your family's got some gene

1145
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,960
problem and you were just duped you were

1146
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,200
just duped the wolves pulled over your

1147
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,520
eyes you were tricked

1148
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,359
is what happened tammy says tammy winter

1149
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,119
says great information

1150
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,800
wow great

1151
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,839
so what happens is you guys the reason

1152
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,680
why

1153
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,079
countless people around the planet got

1154
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,599
rid of their gene mutation

1155
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,960
just like somebody already commented

1156
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,000
right they got rid of their gene

1157
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,880
mutation

1158
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,119
because

1159
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,440
they didn't have a gene mutation

1160
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,079
they had a dirty liver with a low-grade

1161
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,680
viral infection and they cleaned it up

1162
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,000
using medical medium information and

1163
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,240
tools and they went back to their doctor

1164
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,560
and suddenly their gene mutation was

1165
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,560
gone

1166
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,359
all of our genes haven't gone bad in

1167
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,119
just the last 20 years

1168
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,880
15 20 years

1169
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,560
for some reason medical research and

1170
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,560
science believes that all of her genes

1171
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,640
just went bad

1172
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,960
and teaching doctors that

1173
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,359
all of her genes went bad

1174
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,599
chronic illness is exploding like never

1175
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,040
before all around the planet all around

1176
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,920
the world exploding everywhere

1177
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,760
and her genes didn't go bad in two years

1178
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,359
and five years

1179
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,200
all over jeans just didn't go bad

1180
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,800
okay so what they do is they tell you

1181
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,400
you have gene problems to take your eyes

1182
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,160
off the ball so it's like take your eyes

1183
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,319
off the ball don't know that it's your

1184
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,000
liver just say it's a gene problem don't

1185
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,560
know that your brain is filled with all

1186
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,880
this crap no it's a gene problem they

1187
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,200
don't tell you how to fix it no because

1188
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,359
nobody knows they don't tell you any of

1189
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,480
that because the system's not built to

1190
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,800
care

1191
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,960
about anybody they're built to break it

1192
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,880
down the system's set up to break down

1193
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,319
and destroy and hurt and harm people

1194
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,599
that's what it is it's just that's

1195
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,000
reality

1196
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,280
that's just reality

1197
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,440
yeah

1198
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,480
me too 787 good to see you usually you

1199
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,560
leave comments on on youtube right

1200
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,119
yeah it's exactly what you just said is

1201
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,960
spot on

1202
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,720
so anyway you guys so we talked about

1203
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,960
live rescue for a little bit i made some

1204
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,119
pasta i already ate some so i ate a

1205
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,119
whole bunch before i came on here

1206
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,640
but i made some pasta on the amazon live

1207
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,920
make sure you subscribe to the amazon

1208
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,280
live because that's where i'm cooking

1209
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,960
that's where i'm cooking and doing the

1210
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,880
cooking tips and everything and showing

1211
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,800
you things that i like and all that the

1212
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,040

description right

1222
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,079
okay dr fine md autoimmune theory and

1223
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,599
gene theory is a mass duping of the

1224
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,400
populous

1225
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,440
we've cracked the human genome for years

1226
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,920
now

1227
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,760
what has that brought on

1228
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,079
what has that brought on other than

1229
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,079
money for a new industry it's so true

1230
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,280
etc they haven't fixed anybody because

1231
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,960
of that

1232
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,680
they've been playing with genes for

1233
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,440
decades and decades now right for 50 60

1234
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,040
70 years they've been playing they

1235
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,400
started playing with jeans right around

1236
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,319
world war ii

1237
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,319
right before in the 30s in the late 30s

1238
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,440
they started playing with jeans

1239
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,000
and they

1240
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,520
nothing came from it besides billions

1241
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
and trillions of dollars going up

1242
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,960
throughout the decades trillions of

1243
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,640
dollars throughout the decades getting

1244
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,760
funneled into it

1245
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,359
and

1246
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,119
they still don't have one answer to why

1247
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,640
you have a heart palpitation

1248
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,960
that's unexplainable they don't have an

1249
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,760
answer to why anything lizzie liu says

1250
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,160
i've had the same experience with mthfr

1251
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,240
i didn't have it before and then got

1252
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,800
sick and now testing positive for due to

1253
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,800
two different types of ftmtf that's

1254
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,319
mthfr gene mutation i got to tell you

1255
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,599
one thing about that this is really

1256
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,800
interesting

1257
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,119
and

1258
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,119
so here's how it goes you don't have a

1259
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,599
gene mutation before

1260
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:08,880
you get sick and then they diagnose you

1261
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:12,560
with two varieties of mthfrg mutation

1262
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,119
two varieties of mthfrg mutation

1263
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,839
that's unbelievable and

1264
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,280
it's it's so fraudulent i mean listen to

1265
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,760
your doctor do your doctor tells you but

1266
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,280
it's so fraudulent how the system is

1267
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,119
when you think about it

1268
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,119
you don't have a gene mutation in the

1269
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,440
past but now all of a sudden you've got

1270
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,000
one when you get sick

1271
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,079
really it's because it was just an

1272
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,839
inflammation marker detecting

1273
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,599
inflammation not a gene mutation

1274
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,680
and that inflammation

1275
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,560
has a lot to do with the liver i'm going

1276
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,240
to ig so i'm heading off to instagram in

1277
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,400
a couple of minutes

1278
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,359
and i'm going to turn tick tock back on

1279
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,960
and i'm going to read some more

1280
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,960
liver rescue everything else you guys

1281
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,200
check out liverescue when you can

1282
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,040
okay amazon.com it's on sale which is

1283
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,480
really awesome it's a great gift for

1284
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,319
people too during the holidays just

1285
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,920
letting you know the liver is like

1286
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,359
that's that's something you got to know

1287
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,280
about like

1288
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,880
if you want to be somebody that knows

1289
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,880
something about health you have to learn

1290
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,280
about the liver a little bit at least

1291
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,119
enough to learn about the liver

1292
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,480
i mean there's so-called health hacks

1293
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,920
and experts out there i don't know

1294
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,680
anything about the liver and the pieces

1295
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,920
they chime away came from this book

1296
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,839
right here so it's so crazy

1297
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,280
how it works dr sherry green good to see

1298
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,119
