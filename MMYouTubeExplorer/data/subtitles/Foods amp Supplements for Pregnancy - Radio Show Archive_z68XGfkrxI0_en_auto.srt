00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,920
hello I'm Anthony William and you're

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
listening to the medical medium radio

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,719
show where each week I talk about the

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,480
most advanced healing information and

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,120
secrets about health much of which is

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,440
not found anywhere else and is decades

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,400
ahead of what's out there now if you're

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,960
brand new to this show just so you know

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,760
cuz this is really important this is the

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,439
only Health show anywhere where the

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,000
information here isn't agenda driven

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,199
that's really important to know that

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,239
means the information doesn't come from

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,079
interest groups originally medical

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,160
funding with strings attached botched

16
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,840
research with the thumb on the scale to

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,200
make things go a certain way because

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,079
tons of money went into something and

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,840
believe it or not you should believe it

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,800
cuz this is true in alternative medicine

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,160
included there is thumb on the scale

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,680
deep within it it wasn't it wasn't like

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,239
that a long long time ago this is the

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,399
only show that doesn't have any medical

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,680
lobbyists information that might have

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,879
been you know driven from that in the

27
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,760
past internal Kickbacks persuaded belief

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,880
systems all those persuaded belief

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,240
systems those things are potent you

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,159
can't change somebody's mind if they've

31
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,720
been if they you know if they believe so

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,080
strongly in something and doesn't matter

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,720
if you hand them the truth on a silver

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,320
platter in front of them you can't

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,159
change their mind there's people out

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,920
there you can't there's nothing you can

37
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,520
do to break that belief system I don't

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,759
know if you've ever run into that before

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,399
run to anybody like that before well

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,159
there's persuaded belief systems

41
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,799
involved with private panels of

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,040
influencers behind conventional and

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,119
alternative medicine let's not forget

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,079
about health field payoffs and trendy

45
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,640
traps which are actually really annoying

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,119
I talk about trendy traps this is the

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,560
only show where the information I share

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,159
from that I share with you comes from a

49
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,759
pure untampered with Advanced Clean

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,079
Source a higher source a gift that was

51
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,119
given to me which I've called called The

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,759
Curse over the years because I always

53
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,439
hear it non-stop since the age four when

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,759
I diagnosed my grandmother of lung

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,319
cancer that's when it all started for me

56
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,599
and this Source has been helping out

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,840
tens of thousands of people throughout

58
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,840
my entire lifetime and I've dedicated my

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,440
I've had to dedicate my whole life to

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,720
this and nothing but this this isn't

61
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,080
something that started three years ago

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,319
or 2 years ago or 7 years ago or 12

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,879
years ago and goes on and go goes on and

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,840
goes on it's a voice I've heard that's

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,920
guided people in the right direction and

66
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,040
but like I said before you know you can

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,959
have the truth in your hands doesn't

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,599
mean someone's going to accept it out

69
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,239
there in the world it's a sad thing and

70
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,879
and you know hey that's just how it

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,080
works for so many reasons and when it

72
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:56,519
comes down to vital healing information

73
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,879
it's critical to Healing people to

74
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,879
Healing people critical information that

75
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,560
hasn't been touched by anything else for

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,400
those agenda issues that are out there

77
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,480
where it's just about you know money

78
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,720
invested into research that research

79
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,040
better come through with something

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,200
because you're going to get a lot of

81
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,920
investors mad this is clean pure stuff

82
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,480
I'm saying that because right now in the

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,760
industry people could be like oh what

84
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,640
what did he hear this information

85
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,640
somewhere and now he's talking about it

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,720
oh wow what uh may you could probably

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,400

00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:41,200
came out last year and I said on the

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,760
radio show I said look I don't think I

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,879

about that I got from Spirit and then

98
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,959

everything I got not because that's

113
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,000
that's the whole point that's the whole

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,479
point you know I I get it look you know

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,080
we people out there in the world we

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,680
write books we try to get information

117
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,960
out to help people and and everything

118
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,880
else but you know when spirit's telling

119
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,560
you this has this is critical and it has

120
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,720
to go into writing and I've been hearing

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,160
this my whole life I just never wanted

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,360
to commit to the books I was doing all

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,960
the I was I was in the trenches like so

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,759
many amazing doctors and healers and

125
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,080
practitioners and and people that are

126
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,759
helping people when I was in the

127
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,240
trenches and I was doing that for

128
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,520
decades and and and many decades

129
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,320
completely unpaid unpaid just for free

130
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,520
until literally I was basically in in a

131
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,520
in a dog house on the side of a riverbed

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,680
on on Hay straw catching pneumonia and

133
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,520
and then I realized okay well I have to

134
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,319
of course survive like everybody else

135
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,039
but the point is is that with all of

136
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,400
that spirit is said you have to get this

137
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,680
information in these books this is it

138
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,280
has to be in there for people people so

139
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,600
I hope you grab it I hope you grab it

140
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,800
and take a look and read and I think

141
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,479
you're going to be quite surprised um

142
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,560
we're talking about pregnancy pregnancy

143
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,840
today we did a pregnancy show before but

144
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,560
this is a this is kind of an offshoot

145
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,039
because I wanted to dedicate time and

146
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,919
effort in into supplements and foods for

147
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,440
pregnancy because it's such a big deal I

148
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,560
mean a huge deal and it's not just the

149
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,520
concerns and the questions and what do I

150
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,880
take what do I it's more than that this

151
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,680
is this is a child we're talking about

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,160
this is life we're talking about and

153
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,800
this is life we're bringing into the

154
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,400
world this is life we've where we're

155
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,479
dedicating our entire body and being and

156
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,319
Life to and you know in order that you

157
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,120
know we we get to the point that that

158
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,840
success of of having a beautiful being

159
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,800
in our hands and you know so this is

160
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,240
important this is important and um so I

161
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,000
really want to cover into that I got a

162
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,360
couple of funny things to say I want to

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,120
say something here okay before we go

164
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,680
into that and this kind of relates to it

165
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,840
cuz this isn't good for pregnancies but

166
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,880
the world has been taken over it has

167
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,880
been taken over yes literally taken over

168
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,000
it's it's it's unbelievable what has

169
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,520

175
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,280
going to tell you right now okay it is

176
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,360
it is and I don't think it can be

177
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,919
stopped I just don't think it can be

178
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,840
stopped not this anyway I know I'm

179
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,319
always positive about stuff and I'm like

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,919
no no no no you know there's yes you we

181
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,919
can move forward there's no question

182
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,280
about it no matter what but in this

183
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,840
little thing I got to tell you and I've

184
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,720
talked about it before a little bit the

185
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,160
world has been taken over what has it

186
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,280
been taken over with in a disastrous way

187
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,199
fragrant fragrance that chemically

188
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,639
created in an oil base that you plug

189
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,199
into your wall and you destroy your home

190
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:43,039
and you and you invade everybody's lungs

191
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:46,599
and invade the sinuses it's that bad

192
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:50,080
fresheners air fresheners the worst

193
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:53,360
invention on the planet possibly

194
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,680
possibly destroying rental homes by the

195
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,199
thousands and hundreds of

196
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,479
thousands destroying vacation spots

197
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,879
not that I go on vacation I don't know

198
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,120
the last one I've had but the point is

199
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,440
it's destroying vacation spots

200
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,240
destroying I hear about this all the

201
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,000
time destroying homes destroying

202
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,520
offices you can't even go to a dentist

203
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,400
office you can't without it being

204
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,199
plugged in everywhere wreaking havoc and

205
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,199
it's even getting into schools

206
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,879
elementary schools high schools middle

207
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,440
schools and and students in college are

208
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,599
even plugging them into their dorms to

209
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,959
mask to mask the smell of beer or the

210
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,680
smell of partying or just the smell of

211
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,560
just mold or whatever but these things

212
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,560
are disastrous they're so antagonistic

213
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,080
to the brain to the sinuses to the body

214
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,320
it's not even funny I'm serious about

215
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,000
this and it was getting bad years ago

216
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,320
it's at a point now that's that's

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,480
unbelievable is it good for pregnancy no

218
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,800
I talked about that a little bit in the

219
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,959
last pregnancy show it's not good for

220
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,839
pregnancy so pull them out of the wall

221
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,839
and throw them out pull them out of the

222
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,000
wall and throw them out I don't care

223
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,200
what brand it is what kind see what you

224
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,320
have to understand something you have to

225
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,640
understand I don't mean to so be so

226
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,440
bossy by saying that but with this you

227
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,680
just do okay this isn't like essential

228
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,680
oil this isn't like a natural essential

229
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,200
oil that you have in a little mister or

230
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,640
or essential oil that you put on your

231
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,000
wrist or essential oil that you put in

232
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,839
the bathtub or anything like that that's

233
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,839
not what this is this is unknown

234
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,240
chemicals because the recipes will never

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,760
be taught or told to you these are

236
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,440
chemical factories with Vats of lethal

237
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,680
highly toxic chemicals and they're just

238
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,800
they're they're concentrated and

239
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,480
concentrated and they're just completely

240
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,720
synthesized in in the worst way possible

241
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,480

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,800
about what it can do to you because it's

246
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,519
just it it's annoying as heck it can

247
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,240

256
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,560
your childrena for yourself that's one

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,360
thing I wanted to say so

258
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,920
let's let's talk about supplements for

259
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,200
for for children meaning meaning when

260
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,680
they're still inside of us and and

261
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,519
before they're inside of us let's do

262
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,360
that and Foods so I want to give you a

263
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,880
little history little history going

264
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:51,480
back the supplement companies of the old

265
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:55,760
day still exist now those are the bad

266
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,880
ones the bad ones I say that because

267
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,720
during the

268
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:04,279
1930s when alternative medicine was

269
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,480
rising Rising up to help us all the the

270
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,720
incredible herbalists the original

271
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,920
nature doctors the original

272
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,440
chiropractors the original anybody who

273
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,800
was involved in the old days I mean they

274
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,440
were being slaughtered left and right I

275
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,600
talked about that all the time there

276
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,800
because what happened was modern

277
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,560
medicine was in a was was upset

278
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,680
conventional medicine was so angry at at

279
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,360
natural

280
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,160
practitioners that they basically did an

281
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,920
acis inquisition basically against them

282
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,959
I'm I'm not kidding ostracized them in

283
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,519
so many different ways they were jailed

284
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:39,360
they were they were tortured I'm serious

285
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:42,639
about that you don't know it I'm serious

286
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,519
this was a bad time because it was

287
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,079
Rising the alternative medicine was

288
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,480
rising and that was really bad for

289
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,000
business for conventional medicine but

290
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,839
so what happened was conventional

291
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,959
medicine pharmaceutical companies

292
00:11:52,839 --> 00:12:03,360
partnered with supplement makers bulk

293
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:06,920
crappy supplements factorymade junk in

294
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,920
massive amounts of bulk powders bulk

295
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,360
everything and then it went into some of

296
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,720
the old vitamins the just junky ones and

297
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,320
they're in there today in the vitamins

298
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,040

299
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,320
conventional in in the market I'm not

um a vitamin called one a

305
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,519

your imagination classic a vitamin

307
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,360

um um let's see

309
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,320
tum tum you could use your imagination

310
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,240
you probably figured it out all right

311
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,600
right this is just examples vitamins

312
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,600
that back in the '90s early 90s cuz you

313
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,199
couldn't get a vitamin back in the early

314
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,920
90s you go into the the pharmacy and

315
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:05,320
they had two vitamins there and they

316
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,480
were junk vitamins and they had dyes in

317
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,600
them and they had red dye purple dye

318
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,000
blue dye cancer-causing dyes God knows

319
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,360
what all that you know that was in there

320
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,199
they had all that in there but that

321
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,720
those supplements aren't gone today

322
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,760
they're there so when you look for a

323
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,199
pre-

324
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,519
needle you got to go back to the

325
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:28,040
original to the original before the

326
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,920
Vitamin World kind of lifted off the

327
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,720
wrong way

328
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,199
back in the 30s and turned into the 40s

329
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,519
and 50s when you take a vitamin was that

330
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:40,959
one kind of horse pill that was filled

331
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,079
with lowgrade bulk junk from Factory

332
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,760
Pharmacy Vitamin World okay that's what

fast food restaurants if you wanted a

366
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,079
real cup of coffee you had to go to a

367
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,920
special place maybe a fancy place maybe

368
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:17,399
some kind of eery maybe maybe to um you

369
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,759
know not to the early diners the diners

370
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,519
of today though have cormet coffees now

371
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,079
but you go you know you get whatever it

372
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,000
is you would go and and you would go

373
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,800
looking forward it a nice Gourmet Coffee

374
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,240
a better coffee a better get the whole

375
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,920
bit you wouldn't want it at you know

376
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,800
whatever place you wouldn't want it at

377
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,160
that fast food place and but here's the

378
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,560
deal here's the deal all right so I'm

379
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,079
saying this gourmet coffee thing because

380
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,680
there's a reason it's like that W

381
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,199
supplements because now here's the deal

382
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,079
those fast food places that had the

383
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,560
worst cup of coffee and knew nothing

384
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,959
about coffee possible possibly are toing

385
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,480
that they got this SE and they got

386
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,000
better coffees all these different fast

387
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,399
food restaurants but why would I want to

388
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,120
go there to get get the cup of coffee

389
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,519
wouldn't I want to go to a to a place

390
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,639
that knew about Gourmet Coffee long

391
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,240
before someone tried to imitate it

392
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,519
possibly yeah would you want supplements

393
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,160
for

394
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,040
pregnancy that are actually like whole

395
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:22,199
food and really real to protect your

396
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,000
baby and you instead of going with new

397
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,079
you know I mean meaning like going with

398
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,880
places that never knew about supplements

399
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,639
to begin with what I'm trying to say is

400
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,880
if you look at baby formulas and you see

401
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,040
vitamins and minerals in baby formulas

402
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,120
there's so many bad ones it's

403
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,680
unbelievable especially the old days the

404
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,639
canned baby formulas you got genetically

405
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,240
altered soy oil you got corn tons of

406
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,600
corn syrup corn syrup corn syrup you got

407
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,720
all these bogus pharmaceutical bulk

408
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,000
vitamins thrown in there and you see the

409
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,480
list in there they'll have the whole

410
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,360
list in there and and it it it really

411
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,240
and this is from the makers that don't

412
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,559
know anything about

413
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:08,679
Gourmet Gourmet you know milk for babies

414
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,760
Gourmet formulas that come from a mom

415
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,120
what I'm trying to say is alternative

416
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,760
medicine knew how to do it right from

417
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,400
the beginning conventional medicine knew

418
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,280
nothing about vitamins knew nothing

419
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,079
about vitamins from the beginning and

420
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,480
knew nothing really about baby Health as

421
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,360
far as vitamins minerals and

422
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,080
food now they know better better they're

423
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,000
knowing better but that's like the fast

424
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,640
food restaurant that just realized

425
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,679
gourmet coffee is the way to go they

426
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,919
didn't know about it for decades for

427
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,200
decades they sold the worst coffee ever

428
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,600
the conventional formulas meaning the

429
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,160
then you got the conventional medicine

430
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,200
selling the worst baby formulas ever on

431
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:54,240
the planet you may as well sell them on

432
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,280
mars or so they're so bad mean just ship

433
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,919
them off to another planet actually

434
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,720
don't even do that because I care about

435
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:05,120
life on any plant the whole point

436
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,200
is the whole point is is that you want

437
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,039
to get down to the roots of the Whole

438
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,120
Foods to the Natural formula to things

439
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,039
meaning to the natural vitamins and

440
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,840
minerals that are inside your own

441
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,360
natural formula to breast milk and if

442
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,799
you can't breastfeed then you want

443
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,640
options you want options without a doubt

444
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,760
but you don't want the worst baby

445
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,640
formula that basically carries the

446
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,039
pattern of the old day from the 1940s in

447
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,679
the 1950s and the

448
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:38,039
1960s and even even just recently even

449
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,559
recently and don't get me wrong you know

450
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:41,240
conventional medicine is great for so

451
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,320
many things I'm ripping into them a

452
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,080
little bit today but that's because they

453
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,559
didn't know anything about

454
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,200
vitamins or what mommy should be taking

455
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,400
or doing but now they seem to be experts

456
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,000
recently and then you get a mix you get

457
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,799
these doctors that were all conventional

458
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,440
and then yeah they want to learn more

459
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,280
more alternatively and that's thank God

460
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,039
God for that that's that's the

461
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,159
difference today that makes a difference

462
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:06,240
that makes it so much better and that

463
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,880
part I totally

464
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,440
treasure but you know we the whole point

465
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:17,080
is you want to get either way you don't

466
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,480
want you don't want the stuff that came

467
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,000
from the fast food restaurant a long

468
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,559
time ago and then get the good stuff

469
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,720
from that fast food restaurant because

470
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,760
there's always some loophole that isn't

471
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,240
good in the end what I'm saying is you

472
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,559
don't want that classic prenatal that's

473
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,520
filled the junky bulk vitamins that have

474
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:41,200
been in stock at factories overproduced

475
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,520
for 20 30 years and then literally

476
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,840
thrown into supplements today did you

477
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,440
know the conventional

478
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,120
vitamins they have a stock going but

479
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,520
back

480
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,640
decades sitting in warehouses that end

481
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,640
up going fresh as if they were fresh

482
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,840
into supplements that go on the market

483
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,799
as of 6 months ago then the expir then

484
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,720
the expiration date goes on that vitamin

485
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,760
then it goes on it doesn't go on is it's

486
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,000
sitting in factories in piles and piles

487
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,559
and

488
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,320
piles sitting in factories and and

489
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,039
seriously in mounds of this stuff

490
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,840
because they have a backlog why do they

491
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,840
have a backlog because it was

492
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,919
financially smart at the time it was

493
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,400
good for tax reasons good for all kinds

494
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,400
of corporate reasons pile the stuff up

495
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,360
till the cows came home and then use it

496
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,080
later and that's what's in prenatals

497
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,679
today you have to be careful you have to

498
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,360
get the right prenatal the ones that

499
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,880
don't have that the ones that have Whole

500
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,159
Foods the ones that could protect you

501
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,840
you don't want your prenatal from that

502
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,799
fast food restaurant that just kind of

503
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,799
learned about it now either and all of a

504
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,960
sudden they learned about it now great

505
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,120
you want your prenatal from the people

506
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,200
that originated originally knowing what

507
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:03,840
really was right all long as far as the

508
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:08,280
concept of whole whole food whole

509
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,360
vitamins Whole Food real food that was

510
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,520
the concept at the beginning and then it

511
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,080
totally totally got ripped apart and ex

512
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,240
and and thrown in 20 different

513
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,320
directions along the way so yeah you

514
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,840
want Gourmet Coffee you go to a gourmet

515
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,880
place because you're going to trust that

516
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,120
they really are experts in it you go to

517
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,840
a fast food restaurant ohoo they're

518
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,960
serving gourmet coffee now but what did

519
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,679
they serve people for 40 years in their

520
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,640
in their chain

521
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,159
garbage

522
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,840
garbage look the bottom line is I just

523
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,080
want to make sure that you know you're

524
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,640
on the right

525
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,000
supplements so let's talk about prenal I

526
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,159
can't help it because it's such a good

527
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,200
one to talk about first of all prenatal

528
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,840
vitamins aren't really ideal you can

529
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,080
take them fine that's good but they're

530
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,240
they're put together with the thought of

531
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,279
what Mommy

532
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:03,000
needs the thought of what Mommy needs

533
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:06,000
for their baby okay number one and that

534
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,480
was on Old standards old standards of

535
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,520
blood work from from years ago from

536
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,000
years ago What alternative medicine has

537
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,320
done unfortunately this is one thing

538
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,200
they've done that's not good is they've

539
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,320
taken they've gone by the standard of

540
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,520
what conventional medicine already

541
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,279
created for what mommy and baby needs

542
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,840
they've gone on that standard so that

543
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,279
means it's what how many different

544
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,640
vitamins and minerals that are in there

545
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:36,240
which ones they choose the whole bit are

546
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,159
chosen off of the

547
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,760
standard that was created a long time

548
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,240
ago so you're telling me the standard in

549
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,960
conventional medicine that was created a

550
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,000
long time ago that holds true has it

551
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,640
held true in any part of conventional

552
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,960
medicine not really not really it hasn't

553
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,360
because we figured that oh no this drug

554
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,120
is bad oh no that drug is bad oh no 20

555
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,080
years later oh this drug is bad got to

556
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,720
create a new one oh um this this this

557
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,039
surgery is bad no we got to do it a

558
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,799
different way a new way oh this is bad

559
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,159
um this technique is bad got to do it a

560
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,240
different way um is salt good for you

561
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,720
when you're when you're you know out in

562
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,120
Sun is it bad for you um too much water

563
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,600
when you're dehydrated good for you bad

564
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,480
for you it's constantly going back and

565
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,080
forth conventional medicine doesn't know

566
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,880
where they're going with all that there

567
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,159
there up and down left and right but

568
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,799
their old standard of of what mommy

569
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,039
needed in 1950 in the first prenatals or

570
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,320
whatever it was around that time I mean

571
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,600
why did alternative medicine just adopt

572
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,159
that they adopted that why from what I

573
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,640
said at the very beginning of the show

574
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,960
there was interest groups all the way at

575
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,600
the very back of the beginning of the

576
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,320
first bits of information alternate

577
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,159
medicine just you know pulled in that

578
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,919
old information and just started using

579
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,880
it but it's contaminated information

580
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,039
once

581
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,960
again and so what does this mean this

582
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,400
means that you can make your own

583
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,640
prenatal with using the right stuff that

584
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,760
outbeat prenatals

585
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,360
spirina alone has more for you and your

586
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,760
baby than any pill horse pill with a

587
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,000
little bit of this and a little bit of

588
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,080
that and a little bit of this and a

589
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,919
little bit of that in the pharmacy the

590
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,000
prenatals or a prescription prenatal it

591
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:21,320
can't touch what a teaspoon of sparina

592
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,799
can do with helping your baby that blue

593
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,159
green

594
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,360
color in there it's a

595
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,919
miracle what that can do for your baby

596
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,120
and development for brain and everything

597
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,120
I mean literally a little a big horse

598
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,440
pill with nothing with fillers in it big

599
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,600
horse pillar with fillers in it you know

600
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,840
prescrib the prenatal with some because

601
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,559
some guy some some guy back in 1948 said

602
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,840
women need this these are the minerals

603
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,279
and vitamins they need for when they're

604
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,279
pregnant and then that carried

605
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,279
on I'm

606
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,440
serious

607
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:02,120
and um and so here's the deal you can

608
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,559
make your own prenal natal too or you

609
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:08,200
can add to it like I said a little

610
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,000
spirulina that's a great one because

611
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,720
what that has as far as from vitamins

612
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,799
and

613
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,279
minerals is is is much more advanced as

614
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:18,080
far as in the form they're in they're

615
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,039
the bioactive and bioavailable form I

616
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,520
don't like Corella Corella because

617
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,840
Corella here's what Corella doeses

618
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,240
Corella what it does is it it takes

619
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,600
heavy metal and it drops it it takes

620
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,480
heavy metal and it drops it and

621
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,360
protecting the baby and protecting mom

622
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,760
one way of protecting baby protecting

623
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,559
mom is making sure toxic heavy metals

624
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,279
are not in the program whatever you do

625
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,760
that are not in the program and if there

626
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,880
is toxic heavy metals that are in the

627
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,480
body in mom's mom's body because she's

628
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,600
going to have them that's just the way

629
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,640
it works now she's going to have them

630
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,520
and and that means the baby could have

631
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,120
some and you don't want to use Corella

632
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,799
cuz Corella if it even extracts heavy

633
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,840
metal from Mommy from mommy's

634
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,000
brain or from mommy's liver it's going

635
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,600
to drop it right away it's irresponsible

636
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,480
meaning this Corella itself is like that

637
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,799
football player on the field that you

638
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,480
just can't trust or that hockey player

639
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,240
you can't just trust and pack the puck

640
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,799
to you can't you can't trust that one

641
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,880
because it's always always goes

642
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,520
wrong it's the same thing with Kow

643
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,240
because the toxic Heavy Metal the

644
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,039
Mercury's going to get dropped along the

645
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,840
way and anybody who totes cor like the

646
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,279
god you I still see it today I can't

647
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,679
even believe it after I talked about it

648
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,279
medical medium book one and I talk about

649
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,720
it all the time and I I I put

650
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,760
information out there I still see people

651
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:48,240
like oh carella he not spirina carella

652
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,520
carella is the one no it's not it's not

653
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,559
it just doesn't work I'm sorry it's got

654
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,360
nutrition in it but it doesn't work for

655
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,640
for heavy metals so what I'm saying is

656
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,240
sparina can take metal out of the body

657
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,279
and not let it

658
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:06,080
go and not let it go hence not let it go

659
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,159
and get to your baby somehow not let it

660
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,399
go and get to your baby somehow but

661
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,039
instead fortify your baby with

662
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:14,799
unbelievable

663
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,559
micronutrients what do you think makes

664
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,480
that color that color sure Corella has a

665
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:23,880
good color too without a doubt but but

666
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,000
like I said it's not the same thing and

667
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,640
it's not as nutritious anyway as

668
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,919
spirulina what makes that color you know

669
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,360
what makes that color a force that's

670
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,720
beyond all of us a force that's up in

671
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,760
the up in heaven a

672
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,080
force okay way up there a spiritual

673
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,360
power so whatever your belief system is

674
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,760
and I I I treasure everybody's belief

675
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,039
system whether you believe a light is up

676
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,399
there a Creator you you don't believe in

677
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,440
God you don't believe you believe in

678
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:54,159
something else you believe that we just

679
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,519
we just derived out of a lake and as the

680
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,720
as the centuries as as the thousands of

681
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,240
years pass and millions of years past we

682
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,159
grew into something else whatever you

683
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,559
believe in I respect it and I honor it

684
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:07,840
no matter what it

685
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,000
is and so whatever you believe in fine

686
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,760
but believe that that's what's

687
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,679
responsible for spirina that color in

688
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,440
spirina that's what's responsible for

689
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:20,000
that color and that color is using the

690
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,480
word magical completely insults that

691
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,840
color it's it's it's it's bigger than

692
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,640
that so it's a great food teaspoon of

693
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:33,159
Spirulina can do more than

694
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,360
99.9% of all of of all prenatals out

695
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:38,399
there for a mommy and

696
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,559
baby and maybe even

697
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,399
100% but that's one thing that's really

698
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,799
good you another thing that's really

699
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:47,960
good is barleygrass juice powder

700
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,159
barleygrass juice powder it's another

701
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,760
one that's a great one that's a great

702
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:57,120
one it has power to it similar to

703
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,399
spirina but Power because because it's

704
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,080
not just the nutrient profile the the

705
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:04,960
the microminerals subclasses that aren't

706
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,960
even studied subclasses of minerals and

707
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,519
and vitamins and amino acids that aren't

708
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,559
even disc you know people think all the

709
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,640
amino acids are discovered they think

710
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,480
they're all discovered as if as if

711
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,880
science dedicated it all science puts

712
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,559
trillions of dollars into genes that's

713
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,480
all they care about it's not it's not

714
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,679
what's in barley grass juice powder and

715
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,039
what amino acids are not discovered in

716
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,519
them trust me who's going to waste their

717
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,159
time and money and interest groups are

718
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,320
going to waste all their time money into

719
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,159
that endeavor no one exactly but

720
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:39,080
undiscovered amino acids are critical

721
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,960
for baby Health baby growth for mommy's

722
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:46,360
health during pregnancy teaspoon of

723
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:51,519
barley grass juice powder does more than

724
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,960
any any any prenatal does more than that

725
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,279
and then you do you know teaspoon of

726
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,200
Spirulina teaspoon of barley grass juice

727
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,960
powder you can do a half a teaspoon if

728
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,559
you're nervous about do a quarter

729
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,480
teaspoon because it's that incredible

730
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,480
for you it's that incredible for you

731
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,559
could do A4 teaspoon some other

732
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,760
supplements I like I like

733
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:15,440
methylfolate moms have a hard time have

734
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,519
a hard time methylating liver the liver

735
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,519
goes under a lot of pressure a lot of a

736
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,760
lot of of strain and stress so

737
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:27,559
methylfolate is critical cuz it's it's

738
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,640
about getting that methylation even

739
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,480
better than it can be the

740
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,279
conversion of nutrients into other

741
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,200
nutrients that can't be studied by

742
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,760
research in science it can't be and what

743
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,399
happens when it enters the stomach and

744
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,960
goes everywhere through the body it'll

745
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:45,240
never get discovered by research and

746
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,320
science I mean we're talking 500 years

747
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,679
from now if the world doesn't blow

748
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,760
itself up 500 years from

749
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,880
now and anything is is is that's that's

750
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,440
what the whole point is is about that

751
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,159
that conversion it's about converting

752
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,360
inside the body converting everything

753
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,840
converting when pregnant and

754
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,919
pre-pregnant it's all about conversion

755
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,120
conversion meaning your liver does these

756
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,919
magical things converts this into that

757
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,720
converts this into that takes every

758
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,960
micronutrient moves it into something

759
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,399
else tags it with hormones that are

760
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,000
undiscovered by research and science

761
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,039
that bind on to it and drive it through

762
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,480
the body so methylfolate helps to

763
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,840
improve

764
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,279
methylation and I like that one there's

765
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,320
the 1 mgram capsule could take it once

766
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,039
in a while you could take it um talk to

767
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,519
your professional about it talk to your

768
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,919
doctor about it bring all this to your

769
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:38,559
to your to your doc and you're pregnant

770
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:41,200
bring it all to your doc you know let

771
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,960
your doc nay or yay whatever I totally

772
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,360
totally respect that without a doubt

773
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,960
100% but methylfolate is really helpful

774
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,240
helps the liver it does and that's a

775
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,679
great thing it's not there to detox the

776
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,440
liver cuz you don't want to detox the

777
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,799
liver of years and years of garbage

778
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,799
sitting inside of it while pregnant you

779
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,960
don't want to do that you don't want to

780
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:05,080
do a heavy detox don't do anything crazy

781
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,360
don't do one of those you know cleanses

782
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,720
clean cleanse not like a food cleanse

783
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,320
but some kind of liquid cleanse where

784
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,440
it's just liquid only for long term

785
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,320
while you're pregnant don't ever do

786
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,279
anything like that I think you I think

787
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:20,120
you know that um but the bottom line is

788
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:22,840
these are some of the things to use

789
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,080
iodine a little bit of nent

790
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,320
iodine now you can talk to your

791
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,080
practitioner about that too a little bit

792
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,720
of nent iodine

793
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,080
um one tiny drop every now and then if

794
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,960
you want right on the tongue you can do

795
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,039
that that's something also that is is

796
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,039
helpful why is that helpful because

797
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,240
iodine deficiencies cause immune

798
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:46,919
function

799
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,840
problems within not only Mommy's body

800
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,679
but baby's body so now if you don't want

801
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,240
to do a little bit of n iodine and you

802
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,799
don't have to you can talk to your you

803
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,799
can do something else maybe take a strip

804
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,480
of dolls eat a strip of dolls

805
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:02,120
that's that Atlantic Sea vegetable just

806
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,000
eat one strip once in a while you get

807
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,360
nice little iodine kick from that that's

808
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,919
really good so that's something you can

809
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,240
do and you know food doesn't have iodine

810
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,440
in it even food organically grown is

811
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,480
still lacking iodine those fields see

812
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,279
the organic fields are over

813
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,519
overproduced thank God they are they

814
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,639
give us great food but overproduced

815
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,480
overproduced and I'm saying that because

816
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:32,600
the fields go

817
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,360
Barren why am I saying Barren because

818
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,039
when you're pregnant you're not Barren

819
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,120
you know what I mean it what women worry

820
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,600
about when they can't get pregnant

821
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,799
they're worrying about that whole bar

822
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,320
being Barren or something and there's

823
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,600
ways to get pregnant there's ways of

824
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,519
having a baby and there's ways of

825
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,760
fighting and fighting through that and

826
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,279
surviving through that and and having b

827
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,679
a baby and giving birth to a baby but

828
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:55,679
what that means is it's like it's like

829
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,760
we want to put something back into that

830
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,720
soil and that's that's what some organic

831
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,679
farms do they put back into their soil

832
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,080
back into there and they try to get

833
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,600
things back and you know what one thing

834
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,399
they put back into I'm talking about

835
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,240
this CU it's so important I know this

836
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:15,599
one Farm you know what they put in their

837
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,079
fields this organic they're not putting

838
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,040
manure and a lot of organic Fields put

839
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,919
manure they're not putting or you know

840
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,520
manure anything what are they putting

841
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:29,960
they're putting seaweed tons and tons of

842
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:33,839
seaweed like tons of it what I mean tons

843
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:36,760
truckloads of seaweed they dump into

844
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,599
their fields till it in they till it in

845
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,040
they let it sit for a year without using

846
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:46,000
the field so that the snow comes and the

847
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:48,040
rain comes and it brings all these other

848
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,359
micronutrients and it mixes with the

849
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:54,440
seaweed makes these living chemical

850
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:56,200
compounds making living living soil and

851
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,839
they do that and the iodine goes up in

852
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,520
the soil

853
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,079
and that's really amazing but we can't

854
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,400
always rely on what farm is that what

855
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:05,359
farm is that nobody knows right nobody

856
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,880
can just eat at one Farm oh let me

857
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,280
that's that farm across five states away

858
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,000
let me go see if I can get some fresh

859
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,040
spinach from them here's the deal so you

860
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,160
want maybe a little strip of of dolls

861
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,320
would be okay that's all you don't need

862
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,800
a lot of it Atlantic Sea Coast that kind

863
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,920
I really like that's something that's

864
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,960
powerful supplement

865
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,680
wise now vitamin D

866
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,200
vitamin D is a big one on the list

867
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,400
meaning like um doctors are offering

868
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,839
that I'm not a big vitamin D fan because

869
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,280
vitamin D uh does a couple things first

870
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:44,000
of all it thins out the blood and when

871
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,119
you're pregnant you know I don't like a

872
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,400
lot of vitamin D I it's because you

873
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:51,200
don't want to thin out the

874
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,359
blood too bad when you're pregnant you

875
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,200
don't want to do that mean you don't

876
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,960
want to go you got to be very careful so

877
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,480
what happens is you got to I've seen

878
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,880
some women they're on lots of vitamin D

879
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,240
before pregnancy or maybe over the last

880
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,760
couple years meaning over the couple

881
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,560
years before becoming pregnant and you

882
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,760
know vitamin D3 is the way to go by the

883
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,680
way if you're going to do vitamin D

884
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,760
vitamin D3 I was talking about that a

885
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,119
long time ago when everybody wasn't

886
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,760
using that one so vitamin D3 and what

887
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,359
happens is that people go on the Habit

888
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,599
they go on the kick they brainwashed

889
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,599
vitamin D you need Vitamin D the

890
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:27,400
brainwashed vitamin D vitamin D vitamin

891
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,960
D is just one thing that you we can even

892
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,280
get from the sun the sun gives us so

893
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,720
many more important things that isn't

894
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,680
even on the list because science

895
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,880
research hasn't discovered it just got

896
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,119
to understand that um but vitamin D the

897
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,839
problem is with that we get so

898
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,560
brainwashed into Vitamin D thinking this

899
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:44,280
is this is like the greatest thing on

900
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,800
the planet that we

901
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,560
need and we get into a habit of taking

902
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,760
it and then we get pregnant and we take

903
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:56,440
a lot of it not good at all not good at

904
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,119
all just going to say it right now too

905
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,280
much vitamin D thins out the blood you

906
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,839
don't want to thin out the blood while

907
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,359
pregnant or even pre-pregnant meaning

908
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,480
pre- pregancy trying to you you're

909
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,040
working to try to get pregnant you got

910
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,359
to be careful with that that's what

911
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,960
that's what I mean but if it's there's a

912
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:14,800
little bit in something a little bit in

913
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,160
a good prenatal uh

914
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,240
fine but I wouldn't go out of your way

915
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,040
and taking a lot of it get the smallest

916
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,640
dose maybe get the drops the liquid

917
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,280
drops or get a really small amount of

918
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,640
IUS if you want to take it I'm just

919
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,920
giving you advice on you know taking

920
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,119
vitamin D very important so that's

921
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,480
something I wanted to kind of um talk

922
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,839
about you got to see the world doesn't

923
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,880
agree upon one thing you you know that

924
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:46,839
right like the whole world doesn't agree

925
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,880
about one thing right right no no

926
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:50,280
complete diversity in the world

927
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,480
everybody agrees on different things

928
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,200
that's the way it should be that's the

929
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,359
way it should be you know everybody's

930
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,040
got their own own beliefs and everything

931
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:00,880
else and you name it it goes list goes

932
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,040
on like No One Believes In thinking this

933
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,200
this one car is the best car and

934
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,680
everybody should be driving it right do

935
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,280
you think everybody should be driving

936
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,839
the same car so just think globally

937
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,280
think about everybody in the us alone

938
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,359
should they all be driving down the same

939
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,200
the same car can you imagine everybody's

940
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:19,960
driving the same car so every single

941
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,640
couple and family and every single

942
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,839
boyfriend and girlfriend and every

943
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,760
single single person and every single

944
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,440
friend believes this one car is the car

945
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,839
to drive so everybody's driving it you

946
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,760
wouldn't see that right just like you

947
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,680
wouldn't see everybody agrees on this

948
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,400
one cup of coffee and don't drink coffee

949
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,839
while you're pregnant whatever you do

950
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,960
and you know what I mean like not

951
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,920
everybody agrees in the same brand right

952
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,400
on the

953
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,319
planet but what you will and not not

954
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,480
everybody believes you should be

955
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:48,520
drinking coffee on the planet but what

956
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,000
you'll see about vitamin D is the whole

957
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,880
planet right now believes you should be

958
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,280
taking it that you should be on it that

959
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,440
no matter what that's the most important

960
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,680
supplement that that's what you should

961
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,319
be on the whole planet the whole planet

962
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,119
it there's something wrong with that I'm

963
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:04,920
just being straightforward there's

964
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:08,480
something terribly terribly wrong with

965
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,160
that I'm just saying the vitamin D3 is

966
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,040
not the uh worst thing in the world it's

967
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,920
not the best thing in the world do you

968
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,160
need it all the time not

969
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,319
necessarily not necessarily does it

970
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,079
offer a lot not a lot not a lot I'm not

971
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:26,480
anti-d I'm just saying when the whole

972
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,359
world believes in one thing and one

973
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,079
thing

974
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,599
only there was a reason for that going

975
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,839
all the way back at the beginning of

976
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,599
wherever that started just look out look

977
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,280
out so just be careful don't be taking

978
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,160
tons and tons of it don't be taking

979
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,680
50,000 I use you know be careful if you

980
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,040
if you're if your practitioner want you

981
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,319
on it then then yeah but just be careful

982
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,720
on how much you take and take breaks

983
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,400
take breaks so that's something I want

984
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,160
to come across so here's the deal Foods

985
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,560
I want to cover some foods foods are

986
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,079
important now

987
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,880
it it when it comes down to pregnancy

988
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,680
you want to you want to be careful now

989
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,839
the word protein is rampant out there

990
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,599
protein protein protein protein it's all

991
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,520
about protein all about protein protein

992
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:14,640
doesn't make babies protein doesn't make

993
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,200
babies if that was the key if that was

994
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,400
if that was the the truth then breast

995
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,920
milk would be all protein it would be

996
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,079
all protein breast milk has minute

997
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,760
amount of protein and every woman is

998
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:32,119
different every woman is different

999
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:36,079
some women have 1.5% protein in their

1000
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:38,440
breast milk some women have literally

1001
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,640
.9% and their healthy women and they're

1002
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,480
eating plenty of protein some women have

1003
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,319
um

1004
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,800
2.5 some people have

1005
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:51,960
3% but that's pretty much Max and that's

1006
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,680
in breast milk that's in breast milk

1007
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,119
okay why if it was the most important

1008
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,240
thing in the world for pregnancies and

1009
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,319
for babies after birth it was the most

1010
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,960
important thing in the world why

1011
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,960
wouldn't there be more protein in

1012
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,680
mother's milk which

1013
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,280
is holy

1014
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,839
milk

1015
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:16,160
well okay are we going to doubt or judge

1016
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:19,079
nature are we going to doubt and judge

1017
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,680
nature no not in this situation are we

1018
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:23,000
going to doubt mom's

1019
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,680
body are we going to do that are we

1020
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,520
going to doubt our you know the mother's

1021
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,160
body are we going to do that but yeah we

1022
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,079
do we do doubt that so so what happen we

1023
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,520
shouldn't so what happens women are

1024
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,040
eating protein protein protein and what

1025
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,560
is what does too much protein do it

1026
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,280
starves the baby because what does the

1027
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,400
baby feed on for

1028
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,000
development baby feeds on sugar yeah

1029
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,680
shocker shocker I talked a little bit

1030
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,160
about this in the last show too shocker

1031
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,920
that's a big I know right surprise

1032
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,720
that's why breast milk is sugar water I

1033
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,800
Ted about the L I know I just can't help

1034
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,520
it but I got to talk about it more in

1035
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,280
depth it's sugar water you have to

1036
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:06,240
understand that with lowfat it's lowfat

1037
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,480
sugar water that's what it is

1038
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,720
interesting very interesting CU glucose

1039
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,720
is what develops a baby underweight

1040
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,040
babies occur and mommies underweight

1041
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:21,720
babies occur from high fat high protein

1042
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,160
diets and not enough

1043
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,280
carbohydrate that's what occurs I'm

1044
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,520
seeing it in the latest I'm seeing it in

1045
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,680
women lately because they've adopted the

1046
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,119
high fat high protein Trend with no

1047
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,480
carbohydrates and they they stuck to it

1048
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,960
versus craving versus falling for their

1049
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,599
Cravings meaning saying oh no I better

1050
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:44,280
not have that half a potato oh no I

1051
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,160
better not have I better not have um you

1052
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,640
know that little bit of hummus oh wait a

1053
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,720
minute I better not have um too much

1054
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,559
avocado because avocado's got a little

1055
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,319
fat in it but it's got more sugar in it

1056
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:58,720
okay I better not oh it's a fruit okay

1057
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,920
so I better not have that fruit I better

1058
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,520
not have that banana I better not have

1059
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,880
any of that I better not have you know

1060
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,440
that winter squash it's too many

1061
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,720
calories too

1062
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,119
starchy and and they and and they get

1063
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,440
scared because they're trained through

1064
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,800
the trend the trendy trap of high

1065
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
protein high fat sure if you're not

1066
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,720
pregnant and if you're a guy listening

1067
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,640
to this you're not going to get pregnant

1068
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,079
you want your high fat High trendy diet

1069
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,880
I'm not go ahead if you if it's you feel

1070
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,640
like it's doing you good I I'm fine

1071
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,520
because it's not about that it's about

1072
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,240
mommy and baby and what they need that's

1073
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,040
what it's about it's not about what

1074
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,480
Anthony William likes or Anthony William

1075
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,520
loves or Anthony William believes and

1076
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,640
it's about what mom mommy and baby need

1077
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,319
and so what happens is some moms and

1078

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,480
lots of this you know healthier versions

1089
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,680
of course all healthier stuff that could

1090
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,760
be fine for some guy who's not pregnant

1091
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,359
or fine for a woman who's who's just you

1092
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,760
know maybe maybe trying to try a

1093
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:15,319
different diet but because they were

1094
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:19,119
pregnant they got underweight babies and

1095
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:21,839
they got under uh they got uh less

1096
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,079
breast milk on top of it less breast

1097
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,760
milk they had a goat formulas they had a

1098
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,920
goat formulas and they and and their

1099
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,119
babies were underweight born

1100
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,720
underweight be because they followed the

1101
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,400
trend to such dots and teas they crossed

1102
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,559
their tees and dotted their eyes so much

1103
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,800
so far on that Trend where it's like

1104
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,880
high protein high protein and they

1105
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,760
really stuck to it to such a degree that

1106
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,000
they didn't give in on a treat that had

1107
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,720
glucose meaning fructose or sugar they

1108
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,720
stayed away from bananas they stayed

1109
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,640
away from critical things that give

1110
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,000
babies micronutrients vitamins minerals

1111
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,680
and glucose to develop they got underway

1112
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,640
away babies they stayed away from

1113
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,760
potatoes red potatoes purple potatoes

1114
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,480
they stayed away from those things

1115
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,680
beautiful gold potatoes because they

1116
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:13,319
were such in fear of it from trendy

1117
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,559
traps and moms are suffering from it

1118
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:18,160
something to think about what that means

1119
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,960
is don't be concerned about protein be

1120
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,400
concerned about your calories be

1121
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,839
concerned about your calories coming

1122
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,720
from more of some kind of sugar Source

1123
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:29,160
that's not table sugar God forbid and

1124
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,640
not not corn syrup or anything like that

1125
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,200
but sources like potatoes okay really

1126
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,000
important like winter squash really

1127
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,079
important okay like you know artichoke

1128
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,119
hearts which is a starchy kind of you

1129
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,640
know a few brussel sprouts which is

1130
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,559
really starchy these are some things to

1131
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,319
get some important nutrients too and and

1132
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:51,720
lots of fruit different kinds of fruits

1133
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:54,079
not just a pint of small berries because

1134
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,839
it's allowed in your diet you know more

1135
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,040
than that different kinds of fruit

1136
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,960
fruits and more of them like a melon

1137
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,680
have a melon in the morning have lots of

1138
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,160
slices of of of beautiful melon your

1139
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,119
baby will love you when it's when your

1140
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,079
baby's in the womb and and developing

1141
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:10,200
inside your uterus your baby will love

1142
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,480
it because your baby will be getting

1143
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,920
what it's supposed to be getting from

1144
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:17,720
breast milk after your baby has arrived

1145
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:21,000
and then and then you know your baby

1146
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:23,800
want he or she wants that breast milk

1147
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,359
filled with glucose and you want to keep

1148
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,920
your breast milk good so you want to

1149
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,160
make sure you lots of fruit you want to

1150
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,200
E look you can go back to your high

1151
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:36,559
protein High extremely high fat diet

1152
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,960
Trend after you need your breastfed

1153
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,440
maybe maybe a you know you can still

1154
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,720
have some protein and you still want

1155
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,400
different vegetables and leafy greens

1156
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,520
which is really good protein you still

1157
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,160
want you still do some animal protein

1158
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,960
I'm not saying you can't do animal

1159
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,040
protein while

1160
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,640
pregnant that's not what I'm saying this

1161
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,400
is an important thing to understand you

1162
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,040
can still have some it's just it can't

1163
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,520
dominate the entire diet and you can't

1164
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,520
be afraid of fruit you can't be afraid

1165
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,599
of a potato while pregnant because of

1166
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,640
what I'm seeing and I knew about that

1167
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:09,720
many years ago too many many many years

1168
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,480
ago so supplement wise while you're

1169
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,920
pregnant just know be careful on what

1170
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,839
kind of herbs unless you're really

1171
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,079
Guided by your practitioner a doctor a

1172
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:17,520
really good practitioner that knows

1173
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,760
about pregnancies and everything else be

1174
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,400
careful about herbs and stuff because

1175
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,760
here's the thing you don't know what

1176
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,960
your baby likes you don't know how your

1177
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:29,440
baby's going to react if you don't react

1178
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:32,400
to something that's you that's Mommy

1179
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,880
that's not baby we don't know how

1180
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:39,359
babies's reacting to something we don't

1181
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:42,599
know that so don't do any exotic crazy

1182
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,119
herbs don't do anything like that you

1183
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,800
know you're doing something really

1184
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:48,280
gentle you're doing a little bit of you

1185
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,599
know a little bit of a sip of lemon balm

1186
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,440
tea and you're doing a little bit of

1187
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,760
that or you're doing something gentle a

1188
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:57,400
little touch of peppermint tea or you're

1189
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,119
doing you know some nettle leaf tea

1190
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,839
something you know gentle filled with

1191
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,240
lots of nutrients and you want a cup of

1192
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:04,960
that it's fine unless you got a

1193
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,800
practitioner that really knows their

1194
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,119
herbs really knows their herbs and

1195
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,920
they're even

1196
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:15,000
cautious and that's perfectly fine too

1197
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,839
and you know but but what I'm basically

1198
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,240
saying is we don't know what babies's

1199
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:22,680
doing reacting really to something that

1200
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,720
you know something that we're taking

1201
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,280
it's same thing like that with way out

1202
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,400
supplements here's to deal with

1203
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,319
supplements if you take something like

1204
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,640
evening primrose oil which is is

1205
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,880
actually you know is actually what it's

1206
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,440
something you can use if your baby's

1207
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,440
missing the deadline and of birth and

1208
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,319
your baby's like yeah your baby's like

1209
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,559
not on time and you know the doctor's

1210
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:49,640
talking about inducing labor you know

1211
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:51,559
evening primrose can really help induce

1212
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,520
that labor can really help push Things

1213
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,720
Push things through but get the baby to

1214
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,119
move through but your baby shouldn't

1215
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:01,319
react to Primrose Oil evening primrose

1216
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,880
your baby shouldn't react but wait if

1217
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:06,599
there's a capsule that has 50 different

1218
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,799
things in it 50 different herbs and 50

1219
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,079
different things and vitamins and

1220
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:12,119
minerals or 50 different you know amino

1221
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,240
acids of different kinds and you know

1222
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,200
mean meaning like kinds that aren't

1223
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,119
really good versus kinds that are

1224
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,040
naturally in a

1225
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,920
food what I'm saying is you got if say

1226
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,839
you got a complex supplement you got be

1227
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,880
cautious on those like keeping it's

1228
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:31,640
somewhat basic somewhat basic is what

1229
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,880
I'm trying to say so it's important to

1230
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:37,079
know it's like mono mono and I don't

1231
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:41,280
mean mononucleosis like I talk about a

1232
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:43,640
lot I mean mono food sometimes is really

1233
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,240
good for pregnancies not having a

1234
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:49,040
billion Foods on your plate a billion

1235
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,920
Foods you know not having a dozen Foods

1236
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,160
on your plate at

1237
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:57,119
once not having being just a little bit

1238
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,520
more sensitive to to

1239
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,280
concoctions concoctions for the pallet

1240
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,480
if you go out to dinner at a fancy

1241
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,240
restaurant and you know and there's just

1242
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,440
throwing at you all kinds of different

1243
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,280
things and it's just you know and it's a

1244
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,839
lot of different sauces made of all

1245
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,680
different kinds of concoctions and all

1246
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:16,240
things be careful with that is what I

1247
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:19,640
mean keeping more mono mono eating you

1248
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,920
know I dig mono eating for healing too I

1249
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:26,119
do I do I can't tell you how many people

1250
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:29,359
got their lives back from eating ban B

1251
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:31,559
and romae lettuce banana and

1252
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:34,680
celery by

1253
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,359
itself and got their lives back I can't

1254
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,839
I can't even tell you how many decades

1255
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:41,599
I've been able to pull people out of the

1256
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:43,079
trenches of Hell literally meaning with

1257
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,079
their illness and what they've G what

1258
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:47,559
they were going through from banana and

1259
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:50,119
and celery for a little while point is

1260
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:52,599
is mono is not a bad thing and when

1261
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:54,839
you're pregnant you want to you don't

1262
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,680
want it complex to such a degree you

1263
00:50:54,839 --> 00:51:00,040
don't want to be fancy restaurants

1264
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:04,640
eating complex kind of combinations or

1265
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:07,000
even Abominations of food be careful be

1266
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,160
careful and that's something to consider

1267
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,799
keep it more mono you know you're having

1268
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,240
a few potatoes and you know you're

1269
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:16,520
having some you know steamed you know

1270
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,319
baked winter squash little bit if you

1271
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,920
want to sprinkle a little touch of olive

1272
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:23,280
oil on there you can if you want meaning

1273
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,720
something for you know flavor or a

1274
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,160
couple of other different things some

1275
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,240
different herbs and spices that are

1276
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,720
really really mild I mean you can do you

1277
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,319
can do things like if you want to keep

1278
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,359
it as mon as possible you don't know

1279
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,040
what you're going to get in restaurants

1280
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:37,960
when it comes down to your baby saying

1281
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,319
hey I don't like that I mean you might

1282
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,640
like it like the taste but your baby's

1283
00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:44,640
like wait a minute I don't like this so

1284
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,319
that's something to consider um like

1285
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,799
every show it goes by too fast and I

1286
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,040
feel like I can't even touch the topic

1287
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:51,960
the way I want to uh we're going to do

1288
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,720
another pregnancy show we're going to do

1289
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,599

1290
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,200
fourth I I'm not even done with with the

1291
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,680

still stuff to do and I haven't even

1293
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:06,559

1294
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,599
