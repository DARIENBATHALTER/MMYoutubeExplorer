[149.96 - 152.56] something kind of like that since the
[151.40 - 154.08] late
[152.56 - 157.88] 1940s
[154.08 - 159.04] Millions mystery fatigue was born around
[157.88 - 161.72] the late
[159.04 - 163.84] 1940s before that no one was really
[161.72 - 167.60] tired unless they had a really hard work
[163.84 - 170.64] day working the factories and still they
[167.60 - 174.08] weren't tired tired like people are
[170.64 - 177.68] where they get the fatigue the disease
[174.08 - 181.16] it wasn't born yet it was just at its
[177.68 - 184.60] beginning and today mystery for fatigue
[181.16 - 188.08] is now not a baby it's a toddler
[184.60 - 191.48] tomorrow mystery fatigue a teenager and
[188.08 - 193.40] the future not too far from now mystery
[191.48 - 197.12] fatigue is going to be in its Elder
[193.40 - 198.56] phase and that's going to be horrible
[197.12 - 201.20] there used to be a lot of people getting
[198.56 - 205.32] mystery fatigue lots and lots of people
[201.20 - 207.36] but now it's a lot of people it is
[205.32 - 211.04] rampant it's an
[207.36 - 213.04] epidemic I wish mystery fatigue was just
[211.04 - 215.40] from processed foods wouldn't that be
[213.04 - 217.48] amazing you're eating a bunch of junk
[215.40 - 219.44] and garbage and fried greasy foods and
[217.48 - 222.44] fast foods and processed foods your
[219.44 - 225.24] whole diet is based on that and then you
[222.44 - 228.68] just get rid of it and your fatigue is
[225.24 - 230.56] fixed that would be incredible but
[228.68 - 232.88] there's a lot of people out there that
[230.56 - 233.92] got rid of their processed foods and
[232.88 - 236.28] they're
[233.92 - 240.08] bedridden but mystery fatigues not
[236.28 - 243.04] processed foods I wish it was over
[240.08 - 245.52] exercising that would be amazing kick
[243.04 - 249.76] back don't exercise for a little bit and
[245.52 - 252.96] it all goes away that would be wonderful
[249.76 - 256.36] but it's not it's not from overe
[252.96 - 260.16] exercising I wish mystery fatigue was
[256.36 - 263.40] just from working too hard take a break
[260.16 - 265.12] take a weekend off you're back to normal
[263.40 - 267.80] you're not couch bound you're not bed
[265.12 - 271.36] bound you're just back to normal but
[267.80 - 275.96] it's not that I I wish mystery fatigue
[271.36 - 278.64] was partying too much you party hardy
[275.96 - 283.36] you're a big time partyer you're up at
[278.64 - 286.08] night late night partying doing drugs
[283.36 - 289.28] drinking whatever you're doing having
[286.08 - 290.60] sex just partying way too much and
[289.28 - 293.68] you're fatigued because of that and then
[290.60 - 297.00] when you stop all that it's fixed just
[293.68 - 298.80] fixed you're fine you're great I wish
[297.00 - 302.12] mystery fatigue was just from stress and
[298.80 - 305.24] stress alone once the stress backs down
[302.12 - 307.96] calms down you're back in Action all
[305.24 - 312.24] gone not bedridden anymore not couch
[307.96 - 314.20] bound anymore not brain fogged anymore
[312.24 - 316.20] you're just feeling good you can think
[314.20 - 318.76] you could feel good you could run you
[316.20 - 320.88] can do this you could stay up all day
[318.76 - 322.52] not have to nap that would be amazing if
[320.88 - 325.64] it was just stress and then when stress
[322.52 - 328.04] back down you're fixed any of these
[325.64 - 332.08] things any of them can make somebody
[328.04 - 335.08] sluggish and tired to a degree it can
[332.08 - 336.76] beat somebody down I'm not saying that
[335.08 - 339.00] if you do all those things or any of
[336.76 - 342.72] those things that you won't be tired
[339.00 - 345.28] from it but the disease of being tired
[342.72 - 347.72] you won't be getting you won't have that
[345.28 - 351.64] permanent ticket on mattress island or
[347.72 - 355.72] couch Island some rest some recovery
[351.64 - 359.08] time take it easy relax you start to
[355.72 - 361.84] recover you start to come back from it
[359.08 - 364.80] and you get back back to life and that's
[361.84 - 367.20] what would happen unless there's a
[364.80 - 368.68] bigger problem and you're somebody
[367.20 - 370.96] that's just trying to get through the
[368.68 - 372.24] day you're just trying to do good things
[370.96 - 374.20] you're trying to work you're trying to
[372.24 - 376.32] make a living you're trying to be the
[374.20 - 379.52] best you can be at whatever you're doing
[376.32 - 382.56] but you can't function or you can barely
[379.52 - 384.56] function decades gone by medical medium
[382.56 - 387.12] information is saturated the Health
[384.56 - 389.92] Arena with information about why people
[387.12 - 392.68] have chronic fatigue syndrome why people
[389.92 - 395.76] have mystery fatigue and still till this
[392.68 - 398.36] day you can go to a doctor's office both
[395.76 - 401.00] alternative and conventional and it's
[398.36 - 405.40] very possible you'll get this for an
[401.00 - 408.20] answer it's all in your head diagnosis
[405.40 - 410.92] that's right it's all in your head
[408.20 - 413.92] diagnosis one big mistake in the health
[410.92 - 417.84] world right now is blaming everything in
[413.92 - 421.00] anything unprocessed foods that means as
[417.84 - 424.28] of today right now if someone gets sick
[421.00 - 426.72] the first part of that sickness is going
[424.28 - 429.32] to be blamed on processed
[426.72 - 430.84] foods and then every aspect of that
[429.32 - 432.68] sickness is going to be blamed
[430.84 - 435.12] unprocessed Foods it's not that
[432.68 - 437.00] processed foods are good for us and it
[435.12 - 438.68] also depends on what kind of processed
[437.00 - 441.48] foods are we talking about and how
[438.68 - 444.20] processed are they but either way
[441.48 - 447.60] processed foods right now are taking the
[444.20 - 449.88] Highlight the Limelight you're sick
[447.60 - 453.12] because of those but what about about
[449.88 - 455.36] junk Runners I don't mean drug dealers

[472.36 - 478.08] people to run and what do they do they
[475.12 - 481.60] eat processed foods and junk they don't
[478.08 - 484.20] even eat good in fact they boast and
[481.60 - 487.52] brag about it they talk about their
[484.20 - 490.44] favorite meals after long runs like

[549.68 - 555.24] they're not on this quintessential
[551.44 - 559.52] perfect keto diet grass-fed beef piece
[555.24 - 562.76] of pasturised chicken some lettuce maybe
[559.52 - 565.72] one steamed vegetable a few pieces of

[578.28 - 583.56] exercising and they're pro athletes
[581.00 - 586.80] reminds me of a lot of pro athletes out
[583.56 - 588.76] there in general a football players the
[586.80 - 591.88] football players eat perfectly do they
[588.76 - 593.88] eat a perfect keto diet clean from
[591.88 - 596.68] anything are they looking at every
[593.88 - 599.08] single package maybe somebody is maybe a
[596.68 - 601.24] few people are in the league but is
[599.08 - 604.44] every everybody doing that no when
[601.24 - 608.04] they're out on that field are they in
[604.44 - 610.32] agony with fatigue are they bedridden
[608.04 - 612.44] are they in a bad situation where they
[610.32 - 615.52] can't function and their legs feel like
[612.44 - 620.52] sandbags and they can't walk good and
[615.52 - 622.36] they're tired no they're not sure a bad
[620.52 - 624.52] diet filled with all kinds of junk and
[622.36 - 627.44] crap over time will probably give
[624.52 - 629.44] somebody a heart attack yes somebody can
[627.44 - 632.00] live on a junk food diet they can live
[629.44 - 634.32] on fried greasy Foods processed foods
[632.00 - 638.00] for many many years and not be tired at
[634.32 - 640.84] all but yeah they can get a heart attack
[638.00 - 643.76] they can get a blood clot they can get a
[640.84 - 647.04] stroke they can get a major heart attack
[643.76 - 650.04] that kills them definitely over time
[647.04 - 653.52] things get clogged up their livers get
[650.04 - 655.40] fatty stagnant sluggish don't function
[653.52 - 657.96] well it's original medical medium
[655.40 - 660.88] information if somebody's eating a poor
[657.96 - 663.48] diet cuz in the past a poor diet was
[660.88 - 667.60] really just based upon maybe heart
[663.48 - 670.08] disease diabetes those two but liver
[667.60 - 672.92] gets clogged up gets sluggish it gets
[670.08 - 675.88] stagnant becomes problematic puts
[672.92 - 681.24] pressure on the heart and it's time goes
[675.88 - 684.16] by a major Art Attack but yet no fatigue
[681.24 - 687.24] beforehand people can go decade after
[684.16 - 690.16] decade after decade meanwhile a
[687.24 - 693.16] 19-year-old that's eating healthy
[690.16 - 695.44] can't get out of bed 21-year-old that's
[693.16 - 698.52] eating good enough not eating a whole
[695.44 - 700.84] bunch of junk and garbage can't function
[698.52 - 704.48] can't get out of bed 25-year-old a
[700.84 - 707.36] 28-year-old 32y old fatigue can be
[704.48 - 711.76] brutal and depending on the age even
[707.36 - 714.40] more brutal the younger you are it's
[711.76 - 716.12] terrifying somebody who sees everybody
[714.40 - 718.08] else in the world living their life
[716.12 - 720.08] doing what they want to do seeing their
[718.08 - 722.68] colleagues their friends their student
[720.08 - 724.80] friends their family friends all living
[722.68 - 726.52] their life doing their thing and if
[724.80 - 729.44] they're stricken with fatigue and
[726.52 - 731.36] they're watching all of this it is just
[729.44 - 734.32] terrifying so let's talk about the
[731.36 - 736.44] reality of it all like what does it feel
[734.32 - 738.72] like unless somebody's been in their
[736.44 - 740.68] shoes and experienced it themselves
[738.72 - 743.40] they'll never know I think one of the
[740.68 - 746.64] hard Parts about having fatigue of some
[743.40 - 749.20] kind mystery fatigue is that others
[746.64 - 751.96] around you don't understand it if
[749.20 - 754.00] they're not chronically tired there's a
[751.96 - 757.44] lot of symptoms out there that are
[754.00 - 759.64] difficult debilitating a lot of symptoms
[757.44 - 761.80] that are mysterious even if they have a
[759.64 - 763.92] label or somebody gets diagnosed with a
[761.80 - 767.04] condition or a disease it's still a
[763.92 - 769.12] mystery in the end and in all of those
[767.04 - 770.72] conditions and symptoms so many
[769.12 - 775.00] debilitating
[770.72 - 777.52] varieties fatigue is one of the bad ones
[775.00 - 778.96] because when you're dealing with a shake
[777.52 - 780.84] it's a symptom where you have a Tremor
[778.96 - 784.04] you might be able to show somebody the
[780.84 - 785.60] Tremor if you got a twitch or a tick or
[784.04 - 786.84] a spasm you might be able to show
[785.60 - 789.40] somebody the
[786.84 - 792.12] spasm if you have something where you
[789.40 - 793.92] have a drop foot or something like that
[792.12 - 795.72] somebody could see it and they'll be
[793.92 - 798.12] like whoa something's going on with that
[795.72 - 800.20] person and if somebody has a really bad
[798.12 - 802.24] belly ache even though they can't feel
[800.20 - 804.80] it and they can't feel what the person's
[802.24 - 806.80] going through who has that belly ache it
[804.80 - 808.48] still can be like okay and the person's
[806.80 - 809.96] holding their belly and they're yelling
[808.48 - 811.96] and they're saying this is terrible I'm
[809.96 - 814.48] in a lot of pain but when it comes down
[811.96 - 817.60] to fatigue it's kind of like this
[814.48 - 819.28] Phantom this ghost kind of thing and
[817.60 - 822.36] there's only so many times you could say
[819.28 - 824.64] I'm tired telling family and friends and
[822.36 - 827.48] workers and co-workers and your boss and
[824.64 - 829.92] so forth I'm really tired well get some
[827.48 - 832.28] sleep then did you sleep tonight I do
[829.92 - 833.76] sleep all the time I'm struggling I got
[832.28 - 836.28] something going on I can't even keep my
[833.76 - 839.12] eyes open or I can't even stand anymore
[836.28 - 841.08] I'm feeling so fatigued well you should
[839.12 - 842.88] go to a doctor then head to a doctor and
[841.08 - 845.08] get it fixed I've been to three doctors
[842.88 - 846.88] already they think I need a vacation but
[845.08 - 849.04] I can't take a vacation right now okay
[846.88 - 850.96] well go take a vacation take some time
[849.04 - 852.40] off come back when you're all better now
[850.96 - 855.00] they take some time off they come back
[852.40 - 856.60] to work and they're just as tired then
[855.00 - 858.64] the boss is like whoa were you having a
[856.60 - 860.36] lot of fun out there what were you doing
[858.64 - 863.56] I've been on the couch and in my bed the
[860.36 - 866.48] entire week it's one of those symptoms
[863.56 - 870.44] one of those conditions that people
[866.48 - 872.96] don't have a lot of forgiveness for a
[870.44 - 875.04] lot of compassion for so if you're
[872.96 - 876.60] somebody and you're dealing with fatigue
[875.04 - 878.60] of some kind now there's different
[876.60 - 880.12] varieties of fatigue different levels of
[878.60 - 882.56] fatigue and right now I'm just putting
[880.12 - 884.68] it all in one fatigue Ball but we'll
[882.56 - 885.76] cover some of the different varieties
[884.68 - 888.24] but either
[885.76 - 890.44] way however you look at it it's one of
[888.24 - 892.52] those things where people don't have a
[890.44 - 895.64] lot of respect for because they might
[892.52 - 899.04] say this person's lazy or copping
[895.64 - 900.96] out but what about other symptoms like
[899.04 - 903.52] fatigue is bad enough as it is what
[900.96 - 904.84] about anxiety along with the fatigue
[903.52 - 907.00] where you're sitting on the couch you're
[904.84 - 910.64] panicked your anxiety ridden and your
[907.00 - 912.84] fatigued it's a really salt in the
[910.64 - 915.48] wounds and a lot of people have more
[912.84 - 918.08] than just fatigue and anxiety they'll
[915.48 - 920.28] have aches and pains fatigue Tangles and
[918.08 - 921.84] numbness ringing in the ears all kinds
[920.28 - 924.08] of different balance problems and
[921.84 - 926.80] vertigo issues pain in the jaw pain in
[924.08 - 929.08] the back pain in the feet pain on top of
[926.80 - 931.56] their head their scalp trigeminal
[929.08 - 935.36] neuralgia burning tongue and burning
[931.56 - 938.00] mouth and fatigue all of it and fatigue
[935.36 - 939.68] and fatigue is bad enough so let's talk
[938.00 - 941.56] about different levels of fatigue
[939.68 - 945.20] there's being tired where you feel it in
[941.56 - 949.04] your eyes your eyes are tired you rub
[945.20 - 951.24] them a lot they feel heavy your eyelids
[949.04 - 954.16] feel like they want to close on
[951.24 - 956.92] themselves you stretch a lot you yawn a
[954.16 - 959.32] lot you're yawning more than normal
[956.92 - 961.12] people are seeing you yawn all the time
[959.32 - 963.80] people who are demanding your attention
[961.12 - 965.52] or looking at you and you're yawning
[963.80 - 969.32] right at them you can't help it you
[965.52 - 971.56] can't hold the yawn in but wait a minute
[969.32 - 974.60] that's not just tired it's more than
[971.56 - 976.96] that you're yawning you're stretching
[974.60 - 979.04] and then you're kind of nodding off it's
[976.96 - 981.88] another thing too so many people who
[979.04 - 984.48] have fatigue nod off as they're talking
[981.88 - 986.64] to a family member or a friend they
[984.48 - 988.20] start falling asleep and their family
[986.64 - 990.52] member or friend is like hey you should
[988.20 - 993.00] take a nap now now and it could be
[990.52 - 995.84] intermittent you got a little energy one
[993.00 - 998.00] hour in the day another hour you're down
[995.84 - 1001.08] for the count another hour you're
[998.00 - 1003.12] feeling better another hour down for the
[1001.08 - 1006.24] count and then it could be this thing
[1003.12 - 1008.60] where you're half tired during one part
[1006.24 - 1010.72] of the day more tired on another part of
[1008.60 - 1012.52] the day or feeling pretty darn good one
[1010.72 - 1016.24] part of the day and then another part of
[1012.52 - 1017.88] the day you're just down it can vary in
[1016.24 - 1019.68] so many different ways depending on what
[1017.88 - 1021.92] you're doing too
[1019.68 - 1025.36] if the fatigue is getting a little worse
[1021.92 - 1028.28] and you exercise now you're trashed
[1025.36 - 1030.36] trashed for a day some people they'll
[1028.28 - 1032.56] exercise with fatigue they're fighting
[1030.36 - 1034.56] it they're struggling they're doing
[1032.56 - 1038.36] everything they can and now they're down
[1034.56 - 1039.88] and out for 3 days after and then
[1038.36 - 1041.80] somebody could have a lot of energy in
[1039.88 - 1044.64] the morning all through the day they're
[1041.80 - 1047.24] doing pretty good and then early evening
[1044.64 - 1050.92] they're so exhausted they can only just
[1047.24 - 1053.48] lay in bed fatigue can accompany a whole
[1050.92 - 1058.24] bunch of brain fog somebody could have
[1053.48 - 1060.20] just a foggy mind foggy head foggy brain
[1058.24 - 1062.48] they can't get their words out right
[1060.20 - 1064.28] they're feeling so low energy they can't
[1062.48 - 1066.96] get their thoughts together they're
[1064.28 - 1069.12] struggling because they're so tired so
[1066.96 - 1072.52] getting words out is difficult all on
[1069.12 - 1074.60] its own taking a breath is difficult too
[1072.52 - 1077.72] and at the same time their head could be
[1074.60 - 1081.36] really brain fogged out and these are a
[1077.72 - 1085.76] few of the mild fatigue situations what
[1081.36 - 1087.32] about real serious serious fatigue where
[1085.76 - 1090.72] you feel like you got lead weights in
[1087.32 - 1094.00] your hands you feel like you have cement
[1090.72 - 1096.60] shoes on your feet and just walking
[1094.00 - 1099.60] takes everything you have and then it
[1096.60 - 1102.04] can go even further than that where you
[1099.60 - 1104.52] can't take a shower the water hitting
[1102.04 - 1107.28] you almost knocks you over it's a big
[1104.52 - 1109.60] thing a lot of people deal with it what
[1107.28 - 1112.64] happens when people suffer in that way
[1109.60 - 1114.20] though they really get alienated and
[1112.64 - 1116.20] people don't really want to hear about
[1114.20 - 1119.04] it anymore and they end up losing
[1116.20 - 1122.04] friends losing touch with people their
[1119.04 - 1123.96] daytoday is suffering and they're just
[1122.04 - 1126.40] in their house or in their apartment
[1123.96 - 1130.00] somewhere and they're really really
[1126.40 - 1132.44] struggling where taking a shower is so
[1130.00 - 1134.56] difficult they'll get the dizzy spells
[1132.44 - 1136.72] they'll feel the water hit them and
[1134.56 - 1138.16] it'll kind of light up their nerves
[1136.72 - 1140.16] they'll get different Sensations that
[1138.16 - 1143.12] are really difficult they'll get a panic
[1140.16 - 1145.20] attack their chest will become tight
[1143.12 - 1147.28] they feel like they can't breathe the
[1145.20 - 1149.20] fatigue will take over and after the
[1147.28 - 1151.32] shower they're done they're back on
[1149.20 - 1153.80] their bed and they're trying to just
[1151.32 - 1157.88] recoup same thing with going to the
[1153.80 - 1160.20] bathroom using the toilet just having to
[1157.88 - 1162.60] eliminate sometimes it takes everything
[1160.20 - 1164.72] a person has even if they don't have the
[1162.60 - 1167.60] worst fatigue and they have just fatigue
[1164.72 - 1170.48] all on its own going to the bathroom
[1167.60 - 1173.04] could mean they need a break afterwards
[1170.48 - 1175.32] where after they go after they eliminate
[1173.04 - 1177.68] their bowels they have to go lay on the
[1175.32 - 1179.56] bed now or lay in the couch or sit down
[1177.68 - 1181.76] somewhere and they have to
[1179.56 - 1184.12] recuperate one of the problems with
[1181.76 - 1186.32] fatigue mystery fatigue is the industry
[1184.12 - 1188.56] doesn't like to recognize it you have to
[1186.32 - 1191.52] go find somebody to give you a diagnosis
[1188.56 - 1195.12] that you have chronic fatigue syndrome
[1191.52 - 1196.64] or me chronic fatigue syndrome and
[1195.12 - 1199.00] that's difficult because insurance
[1196.64 - 1200.76] companies don't care insurance iies
[1199.00 - 1203.48] don't want to really know about this
[1200.76 - 1206.40] kind of condition or disease so even if
[1203.48 - 1208.36] you find coverage it might not last long
[1206.40 - 1210.56] or something could go wrong chronic
[1208.36 - 1213.40] fatigue syndrome is not respected enough
[1210.56 - 1216.52] it wasn't in the past just a little bit
[1213.40 - 1218.60] more now than it was in the past but
[1216.52 - 1220.68] seriously as far as someone really
[1218.60 - 1223.04] struggling with chronic fatigue syndrome
[1220.68 - 1225.36] getting a doctor getting some kind of
[1223.04 - 1227.40] help is still really difficult
[1225.36 - 1229.28] understanding the condition and then
[1227.40 - 1231.44] it's like musical chairs it's like
[1229.28 - 1233.12] looking for something they're like well
[1231.44 - 1234.32] you could have chronic fatigue syndrome
[1233.12 - 1236.28] but you might have something else maybe
[1234.32 - 1238.48] you have Lyme disease maybe you got
[1236.28 - 1240.76] something else maybe it's Ms maybe it's
[1238.48 - 1243.36] ra maybe it's just autoimmune maybe it's
[1240.76 - 1245.72] all in your head and even till this day
[1243.36 - 1248.32] someone will still get it's all in your
[1245.72 - 1251.48] head or you're just looking for
[1248.32 - 1254.48] attention and along with the fatigue is
[1251.48 - 1256.52] guilt and fear and shame those are
[1254.48 - 1258.80] things that really accompany it
[1256.52 - 1259.88] especially if it's a misdiagnosis and
[1258.80 - 1262.32] it's like well you're not really
[1259.88 - 1264.80] fatigued you got this going on or you
[1262.32 - 1266.72] got leaky gut let's fix it but it
[1264.80 - 1270.68] doesn't get fixed you still got the
[1266.72 - 1273.60] fatigue so more guilt and fear and shame
[1270.68 - 1276.32] occur and then with a lot of people who
[1273.60 - 1279.36] deal with chronic fatigue syndrome it's
[1276.32 - 1282.68] the ultimate you look fine but you look
[1279.36 - 1285.12] fine you can't be sick you look good you
[1282.68 - 1287.80] look like everything's okay it's one of
[1285.12 - 1291.40] the ultimate versions of that meanwhile
[1287.80 - 1293.76] you could barely stand can barely walk
[1291.40 - 1296.00] you can't do anything you want to do you
[1293.76 - 1298.60] can't go and take a run and be like oo
[1296.00 - 1301.20] and jump in a pool or in a beach you
[1298.60 - 1303.20] can't just hop into the ocean and live
[1301.20 - 1305.88] your life you're in a difficult
[1303.20 - 1308.32] situation because you're getting stopped
[1305.88 - 1310.64] everywhere you turn and that leads to
[1308.32 - 1312.64] the whole you look great so what's
[1310.64 - 1315.24] really wrong with you though get to the
[1312.64 - 1318.60] doctor but the doctor can't fix you so
[1315.24 - 1321.16] more guilt and fear and shame occurs
[1318.60 - 1323.56] fatigue is real mystery fatigue is real
[1321.16 - 1326.32] chronic fatigue syndrome is real and if
[1323.56 - 1329.80] someone doesn't have a big brain tumor
[1326.32 - 1333.24] inside their head that's causing fatigue
[1329.80 - 1336.04] then it's Epstein bar virus and Epstein
[1333.24 - 1339.36] bar virus could even create a brain
[1336.04 - 1342.00] tumor in somebody's head so in the end
[1339.36 - 1344.16] it originates from a virus
[1342.00 - 1346.40] situation now there are some people that
[1344.16 - 1350.84] will have some fatigue from the shingles
[1346.40 - 1353.20] virus or herpes simplex one two but it's
[1350.84 - 1356.16] different it's not necessarily the
[1353.20 - 1358.88] fatigue that Epstein bar provides
[1356.16 - 1361.20] somebody could have adrenal fatigue they
[1358.88 - 1364.16] could have that and it could give them a
[1361.20 - 1367.60] tiredness it could make them fatigued
[1364.16 - 1369.64] but there's bounceback there's recall
[1367.60 - 1372.88] could be at different times different
[1369.64 - 1375.56] days but there's bounceback mystery
[1372.88 - 1378.00] fatigue that's viral you don't really
[1375.56 - 1380.92] get the bounce back in the way you do it
[1378.00 - 1383.24] a dream fatigue unless the adrenals are
[1380.92 - 1385.84] totally wasted but if they're that
[1383.24 - 1388.44] wasted in somebody's fatigue that bad
[1385.84 - 1390.60] because they're adrenals are that shot a
[1388.44 - 1393.92] doctor should find that a doctor should
[1390.60 - 1396.16] be able to diagnose it properly and know
[1393.92 - 1398.24] that the adrenals are wasted that the
[1396.16 - 1400.36] person really is suffering from adrenal
[1398.24 - 1403.12] fatigue doesn't mean someone with
[1400.36 - 1405.08] adrenal fatigue can't also have a viral
[1403.12 - 1408.60] infection like Epstein bar they're
[1405.08 - 1412.16] suffering from both and viral infections
[1408.60 - 1414.48] can put stress on the adrenals allowing
[1412.16 - 1416.76] adrenals to weaken more when somebody's
[1414.48 - 1419.40] dealing with neurological fatigue the
[1416.76 - 1421.16] next thing I'm talking about it took
[1419.40 - 1423.16] decades for the world of medicine to
[1421.16 - 1425.80] realize fatigue was
[1423.16 - 1428.16] neurological decades and decades medical
[1425.80 - 1430.04] medium information knew it was
[1428.16 - 1432.68] neurological because it wasn't just
[1430.04 - 1434.84] somebody being tired or exhausted or it
[1432.68 - 1437.36] was all in their head or they were being
[1434.84 - 1439.28] lazy there were real reasons someone was
[1437.36 - 1442.64] suffering with fatigue
[1439.28 - 1446.16] neurological fatigue by medical medium
[1442.64 - 1449.88] definition is the central nervous system
[1446.16 - 1454.48] and other nerves within the body they're
[1449.88 - 1457.48] inflamed due to neurotoxins or viral
[1454.48 - 1461.68] Invasion when people were diagnosed with
[1457.48 - 1465.20] glandular fever or mono and they got
[1461.68 - 1467.88] tired doctors knew it was the mono or
[1465.20 - 1468.92] glandular fever that was exhausting the
[1467.88 - 1473.24] person
[1468.92 - 1476.76] but they didn't know how or why and then
[1473.24 - 1479.28] if somebody recovered from mono somebody
[1476.76 - 1481.84] recovered from glandular fever and they
[1479.28 - 1484.44] were still tired it would be a mystery
[1481.84 - 1486.88] to the medical system mystery to the
[1484.44 - 1489.24] medical doctors they would not know why
[1486.88 - 1491.56] the person's tired they're better
[1489.24 - 1494.12] they're recovered from mononucleosis
[1491.56 - 1496.32] they're recovered from glandular fever
[1494.12 - 1498.64] now what's going on here there's a
[1496.32 - 1502.28] mystery and what about the person who
[1498.64 - 1505.84] had mononucleosis 3 years ago 5 years
[1502.28 - 1508.52] ago and has been tired ever since what
[1505.84 - 1511.40] about the person who had glandular fever
[1508.52 - 1513.96] 10 years ago they're still tired a
[1511.40 - 1516.88] lifetime of chronic fatigue after
[1513.96 - 1519.32] glandular fever after
[1516.88 - 1522.60] mononucleosis and they had a lifetime of
[1519.32 - 1524.88] being tired no doctor nobody in the
[1522.60 - 1527.44] medical world nobody in any medical
[1524.88 - 1530.60] University would say they had glandular
[1527.44 - 1532.24] fever or o they would say your tiredness
[1530.60 - 1534.36] is just something else we don't know
[1532.24 - 1537.24] what it is it's a mystery but really
[1534.36 - 1540.04] what it is it's neurological fatigue
[1537.24 - 1542.56] caused by the same virus that gave the
[1540.04 - 1546.16] glandular fever the same virus that gave
[1542.56 - 1550.00] the mononucleosis the Epstein bar virus
[1546.16 - 1553.84] what Epstein bar does is it releases a
[1550.00 - 1556.28] neurotoxin after it's consumed a
[1553.84 - 1558.96] favorite food a favorite food to the
[1556.28 - 1562.12] Epstein virus could be gluten
[1558.96 - 1564.84] it could be dairy products it could be
[1562.12 - 1568.36] eggs it could be toxic heavy metals like
[1564.84 - 1571.52] Mercury and aluminum and copper but epin
[1568.36 - 1575.12] bar virus loves to eat it has to eat to
[1571.52 - 1580.16] stay alive it has to eat to survive it
[1575.12 - 1582.52] consumes food and then it excretes it
[1580.16 - 1585.88] does an elimination process it
[1582.52 - 1588.96] eliminates toxins the problem is those
[1585.88 - 1590.64] toxins aren't friendly they're highly
[1588.96 - 1593.60] problematic to the central nervous
[1590.64 - 1596.60] system to all nerves in the body epin
[1593.60 - 1599.00] bar releases all these neurotoxins they
[1596.60 - 1600.28] float around sometimes they get caught
[1599.00 - 1603.40] up in the liver and they sit in there
[1600.28 - 1607.00] for a long time but either way they
[1603.40 - 1610.68] cause a battery draw an energy draw
[1607.00 - 1614.36] those neurotoxins land on nerves inflame
[1610.68 - 1618.04] them irritate them and this robs and
[1614.36 - 1620.92] steals energy the more Epstein bar virus
[1618.04 - 1624.56] the the more viruses the more viral
[1620.92 - 1627.28] cells the more feedings that occur the
[1624.56 - 1630.00] more neurotoxins that are released the
[1627.28 - 1632.56] more symptoms with the chronic fatigue
[1630.00 - 1635.48] somebody could have just a little bit of
[1632.56 - 1637.92] viral inflammation meaning low-grade
[1635.48 - 1640.32] viral infection not a lot of Epstein bar
[1637.92 - 1642.68] going on just a little bit tiny bit of
[1640.32 - 1645.04] neurotoxins being released
[1642.68 - 1647.44] systematically and then they feel tired
[1645.04 - 1649.48] all the time they're struggling but then
[1647.44 - 1652.28] somebody could have more Epstein bar
[1649.48 - 1654.12] virus and more neurotoxins are being
[1652.28 - 1655.80] released and maybe they have more
[1654.12 - 1658.96] mercury in their system than somebody
[1655.80 - 1661.88] else so the Epstein bar virus is feeding
[1658.96 - 1665.24] off of more Mercury releasing a more
[1661.88 - 1667.96] toxic neurotoxin when this happens and
[1665.24 - 1670.32] it's floating around someone ends up
[1667.96 - 1672.60] getting more symptoms than just the
[1670.32 - 1676.32] chronic fatigue syndrome now now they're
[1672.60 - 1678.68] getting tingles and numbness dizziness
[1676.32 - 1680.96] ringing in the ears you're getting all
[1678.68 - 1682.40] kinds of different blurry eyes without
[1680.96 - 1685.48] any kind of real
[1682.40 - 1688.76] diagnosis epine bar tends to affect
[1685.48 - 1692.00] cranial nerves cranial nerves such as
[1688.76 - 1693.44] the vagus nerves when they get inflamed
[1692.00 - 1695.64] or irritated by
[1693.44 - 1698.76] neurotoxins then a lot of different
[1695.64 - 1701.00] strange mysterious weird symptoms can
[1698.76 - 1702.64] occur like tightness in the throat
[1701.00 - 1705.92] tightness in the chest tingles and
[1702.64 - 1708.44] numbness in weird places pains in weird
[1705.92 - 1711.04] places as well because the vague V
[1708.44 - 1713.00] nerves are inflamed when the vagus
[1711.04 - 1714.88] nerves get inflamed that's when people
[1713.00 - 1717.24] are running to neurologist after
[1714.88 - 1719.08] neurologist after neurologist and
[1717.24 - 1721.76] they're getting different answers from
[1719.08 - 1725.08] each neurologist and they find
[1721.76 - 1728.16] themselves at a lime disease doctor lime
[1725.08 - 1731.00] disease specialist then now it's all
[1728.16 - 1733.00] lime disease it's all bacteria and we're
[1731.00 - 1736.12] off the mark now cuz it's not a
[1733.00 - 1738.72] bacterial problem bacteria can't cause
[1736.12 - 1740.76] these symptoms virus
[1738.72 - 1743.32] cause these symptoms the Epstein bar
[1740.76 - 1746.20] virus especially and when it comes down
[1743.32 - 1749.52] to Lyme disease doctors now are testing
[1746.20 - 1751.12] for Epstein bar interesting cuz I
[1749.52 - 1754.28] thought it was all
[1751.12 - 1757.48] bacteria that's what they always say and
[1754.28 - 1759.84] said medical medium information talks
[1757.48 - 1763.28] about it being viral Lyme disease was
[1759.84 - 1766.80] actually a virus or viruses epine bar
[1763.28 - 1768.96] being one of them but now lime doctors
[1766.80 - 1771.44] are actually saying oh back Bia bacteria
[1768.96 - 1774.48] bacteria here's some doxic cyclin here's
[1771.44 - 1777.40] some different you know antibiotics but
[1774.48 - 1779.68] let's go check this epine bar thing ooh
[1777.40 - 1781.88] you have Epstein bar too but yet they're
[1779.68 - 1784.68] still like oh here's the antibiotic for
[1781.88 - 1787.24] the bacteria but yeah you have a virus
[1784.68 - 1790.00] as well so medical medium information
[1787.24 - 1792.52] turned the tide on that because it's
[1790.00 - 1794.92] really a virus causing Lyme disease and
[1792.52 - 1797.64] they're off The Mark with the bacteria
[1794.92 - 1800.92] so what do we do if we have a viral
[1797.64 - 1804.80] infection causing mysterious fatigue we
[1800.92 - 1808.44] kill the virus we go after it we destroy
[1804.80 - 1811.96] it we starve it we get rid of it we push
[1808.44 - 1814.92] it out of our body and we heal and after
[1811.96 - 1817.64] we kill that virus or
[1814.92 - 1819.48] viruses after we kill the Epstein bar
[1817.64 - 1821.68] virus because somebody could have two
[1819.48 - 1823.88] varieties of Epstein bar or three
[1821.68 - 1826.60] varieties of epsin bar after we kill
[1823.88 - 1829.40] them and get rid of them we restore the
[1826.60 - 1832.00] central nervous system we heal the
[1829.40 - 1834.80] nerves if you're somebody that had a
[1832.00 - 1836.48] diagnosis an autoimmune diagnosis a
[1834.80 - 1838.52] condition a symptom you're struggling
[1836.48 - 1844.44] for a long time you've been through a
[1838.52 - 1846.84] lot you can heal yes and you will heal
[1844.44 - 1849.92] having the right information is critical
[1846.84 - 1852.56] giving your body what it needs like
[1849.92 - 1854.92] smart things not just get rid of
[1852.56 - 1858.40] processed foods that automatically is a
[1854.92 - 1860.80] no-brainer of course but it's not enough
[1858.40 - 1863.40] when it comes down to Healing we got to
[1860.80 - 1866.00] know what's wrong and when you learn
[1863.40 - 1869.24] about these viruses and you learn what
[1866.00 - 1872.28] they're capable of how they live in us
[1869.24 - 1874.20] what they do you can overcome the
[1872.28 - 1878.64] condition and the symptom and not just
[1874.20 - 1880.44] manage it overcome it every night your
[1878.64 - 1882.68] body does a little bit of healing when
[1880.44 - 1885.36] you're giving your body what it needs
[1882.68 - 1888.16] every single night you move forward even
[1885.36 - 1890.64] if it doesn't feel that way because when
[1888.16 - 1892.00] a nervous system has been overburdened
[1890.64 - 1894.60] by all those
[1892.00 - 1896.64] neurotoxins and heavy metals and other
[1894.60 - 1899.84] poisons and so forth when your nervous
[1896.64 - 1904.36] system has been overburdened it doesn't
[1899.84 - 1907.04] heal in one hour it can't it could do
[1904.36 - 1910.24] some healing in 1 hour but it can't
[1907.04 - 1913.00] fully completely heal when somebody has
[1910.24 - 1916.16] had a long-term low-grade viral
[1913.00 - 1919.16] infection that's been wreaking havoc or
[1916.16 - 1921.84] viral infections that have been wreaking
[1919.16 - 1924.96] havoc or multiple different varieties of
[1921.84 - 1927.84] viruses it takes time but as you're
[1924.96 - 1930.40] killing off the bugs getting rid of them
[1927.84 - 1932.20] breaking them down and restoring a
[1930.40 - 1935.08] damaged immune
[1932.20 - 1938.68] system Life Starts to
[1935.08 - 1940.04] change and you start to heal and you
[1938.68 - 1942.64] start moving
[1940.04 - 1945.56] forward one of the struggles is being in
[1942.64 - 1948.08] the darkness the darkness of not knowing
[1945.56 - 1950.88] why you're sick what to do and the
[1948.08 - 1952.36] process that's a difficult place to be
[1950.88 - 1954.44] but when you know you're restoring your
[1952.36 - 1956.44] nervous system and that's the goal
[1954.44 - 1958.08] that's a big deal and when you know
[1956.44 - 1960.32] you're restoring your immune system and
[1958.08 - 1962.08] that's the goal it's a big deal and when
[1960.32 - 1964.24] you know you're killing off bugs and
[1962.08 - 1967.28] pathogens and viruses it's another big
[1964.24 - 1970.40] deal these things bring peace while
[1967.28 - 1973.12] you're healing I'm in medical medium
[1970.40 - 1976.12] book one Secrets behind chronic and
[1973.12 - 1978.56] mystery illness and how to finally heal
[1976.12 - 1981.72] I'm in the chronic fatigue syndrome
[1978.56 - 1983.84] section the revised and expanded New
[1981.72 - 1986.20] Edition and so what I'm going to do is
[1983.84 - 1987.92] read some of my favorites here there's a
[1986.20 - 1990.12] lot of different things you can do for
[1987.92 - 1993.96] chronic fatigue syndrome let's start at
[1990.12 - 1998.24] the top fresh celery juice
[1993.96 - 2002.08] exactly just fresh celery juice says
[1998.24 - 2007.60] here work up to 32 o daily then work up
[2002.08 - 2010.96] to 64 Oz if possible a day now you can
[2007.60 - 2015.36] just do 4 oz of celery juice every day 2
[2010.96 - 2017.60] oz and you're moving the needle you can
[2015.36 - 2022.76] just do a little bit but if you get up
[2017.60 - 2025.32] to 32 oz every single day you can move
[2022.76 - 2028.24] mountains that is someplace that you
[2025.32 - 2030.00] could just start just right there and
[2028.24 - 2032.92] start moving things forward now keep in
[2030.00 - 2034.96] mind you may be somebody that has a
[2032.92 - 2038.00] multiple batch of viruses in you
[2034.96 - 2040.36] different strains different varieties
[2038.00 - 2042.44] you've been sick and down for a while
[2040.36 - 2045.76] they all came to roost they're all
[2042.44 - 2048.00] causing problems you got 50 different
[2045.76 - 2050.08] symptoms mostly
[2048.00 - 2052.28] neurological you're going to need
[2050.08 - 2054.08] probably more than celery juice so let's
[2052.28 - 2059.12] take a look at some of the other things
[2054.08 - 2064.04] in here cat's claw one of my favorites
[2059.12 - 2066.72] cat's claw two dropper FS twice a day
[2064.04 - 2070.00] cats Claw is a powerful
[2066.72 - 2073.44] antiviral it is wonderful for chronic
[2070.00 - 2074.96] fatigue syndrome or just mystery fatigue
[2073.44 - 2078.04] because of the medical medium
[2074.96 - 2081.52] information lime disease doctors are now
[2078.04 - 2084.96] offering cat's claw pathogens don't like
[2081.52 - 2088.52] cat's claw they don't they're allergic
[2084.96 - 2090.52] to it but yet our body isn't what
[2088.52 - 2095.00] happens when cats claw enters the body
[2090.52 - 2097.08] pathogens go oh my God run but it takes
[2095.00 - 2099.72] time because pathogens hide out in
[2097.08 - 2102.32] different places in the body they hide
[2099.72 - 2105.28] out in the liver they hide out around
[2102.32 - 2107.52] the nervous system they hide out in the
[2105.28 - 2109.96] spleen even around the
[2107.52 - 2112.36] pancreas takes a little time to get cats
[2109.96 - 2116.16] claw into the body but when you bring it
[2112.36 - 2118.44] in you're already moving forward lemon
[2116.16 - 2122.04] bomb another one of my favorites it's in
[2118.44 - 2125.28] the list what I love about lemon bomb it
[2122.04 - 2128.76] helps to soothe the nerves and nerves
[2125.28 - 2131.76] get inflamed because of EP bar and other
[2128.76 - 2135.00] viruses and that inflammation causes
[2131.76 - 2138.60] those nerves to vibrate to
[2135.00 - 2141.56] Rattle to have a vibration behind it
[2138.60 - 2144.92] where people lay there and they feel it
[2141.56 - 2147.40] nerves get so inflamed it even creates
[2144.92 - 2150.20] where you hear your heartbeat when
[2147.40 - 2152.76] you're laying down you hear a pulse when
[2150.20 - 2155.16] you're laying down cuz nerves get
[2152.76 - 2157.68] inflamed and because of that there's
[2155.16 - 2161.04] pressure building in the body so you
[2157.68 - 2162.56] hear your pulse you hear your heartbeat
[2161.04 - 2165.20] and that's really hard for people who
[2162.56 - 2167.92] can't sleep or they're laying around all
[2165.20 - 2170.44] day long and they have to hear that that
[2167.92 - 2172.60] inflammation is the nerve swelling
[2170.44 - 2177.16] pressing against so many other things
[2172.60 - 2179.56] lemon mom calms the nerves eases them
[2177.16 - 2182.92] it's really an amazing herb for the
[2179.56 - 2185.84] nervous system helps them to heal to
[2182.92 - 2187.96] and pathogens do not like lemon bomb
[2185.84 - 2190.44] it's antiviral
[2187.96 - 2193.64] another one on the list I really like is
[2190.44 - 2197.84] licorice root it's antiviral says one
[2193.64 - 2202.00] drop or full twice a day viruses hate
[2197.84 - 2205.00] licorice root especially viruses that
[2202.00 - 2210.24] hibernate inside the liver licorice
[2205.00 - 2213.76] fruit is a great great herb for the
[2210.24 - 2216.52] liver helps to push out the viruses
[2213.76 - 2220.64] helps to gum them up get them trapped
[2216.52 - 2222.88] get them doile licorice root is also
[2220.64 - 2225.80] good for the immune system helps to
[2222.88 - 2228.32] restore the immune system strengthen it
[2225.80 - 2230.40] something that you need especially when
[2228.32 - 2233.68] you've dealt with fatigue for so many
[2230.40 - 2236.64] years and for so long vitamin B12 that's
[2233.68 - 2240.00] a big one right there meth cobalamin and
[2236.64 - 2242.96] adinos Sil cobalamin the combination is
[2240.00 - 2245.52] perfect for the nervous system and what
[2242.96 - 2248.60] happens with people their nerves get
[2245.52 - 2250.48] fried they get burnt out
[2248.60 - 2252.56] central nervous system and nervous
[2250.48 - 2255.88] system symptoms are some of the worst
[2252.56 - 2258.76] and fatigue is a neurological symptom
[2255.88 - 2261.12] it's neurological fatigue that means the
[2258.76 - 2263.48] nerves are up against problems and like
[2261.12 - 2265.80] we talked about before neurotoxins
[2263.48 - 2269.20] inflaming the nerves there needs to be
[2265.80 - 2271.92] some help for those nerves and b12 is a
[2269.20 - 2273.72] big one right there golden seal is
[2271.92 - 2276.68] another one on the list it's one of my
[2273.72 - 2278.04] favorites says two dropper FS twice a
[2276.68 - 2279.96] day
[2278.04 - 2283.24] that's an important one great for the
[2279.96 - 2286.16] immune system helps to move the needle
[2283.24 - 2288.32] viruses and pathogens do not like golden
[2286.16 - 2291.24] seal and one of the most important
[2288.32 - 2294.24] that's on the list right here zinc
[2291.24 - 2296.72] liquid zinc sulfate it says here two
[2294.24 - 2301.76] dropper FS twice a day in the medical
[2296.72 - 2304.52] medium book zinc is a big one because it
[2301.76 - 2308.08] slows down and stops cyto
[2304.52 - 2310.68] storms it gets in the way of path
[2308.08 - 2315.00] in every way pathogens viruses
[2310.68 - 2318.32] especially do not like zinc and zinc
[2315.00 - 2321.60] restores the immune system and the thing
[2318.32 - 2324.64] is people who are sick have immune
[2321.60 - 2328.04] system problems their immune systems are
[2324.64 - 2330.72] weakened they're struggling zinc is
[2328.04 - 2334.80] something the immune cells need to
[2330.72 - 2336.88] strengthen move forward and attack bugs
[2334.80 - 2339.48] that are in your system such as Epstein
[2336.88 - 2342.04] bar now the right kind of supplements
[2339.48 - 2343.80] always matter there could be alcohol and
[2342.04 - 2347.12] supplements all kinds of different
[2343.80 - 2349.92] things like MSG or they can just be
[2347.12 - 2352.24] really weak this matters when you're

[2409.44 - 2417.92] and I will be looking back behind me I
[2412.72 - 2421.92] won the fight I told a demon I rule you
[2417.92 - 2423.44] and good night I see that Old Ship
[2421.92 - 2427.00] floating in the
[2423.44 - 2430.16] distance far away with all the records
[2427.00 - 2433.96] of my my pain and suffering I once felt

[2448.92 - 2454.32] off and I am sporting so much
[2452.12 - 2458.08] confidence I'm showing
[2454.32 - 2462.16] off don't cry this this is not your time
[2458.08 - 2464.68] to die far from it it's going to take so
[2462.16 - 2467.56] much more to knock you out and you're
[2464.68 - 2471.56] going to be the last one that says
[2467.56 - 2475.24] bye-bye truth be told you're carrying a
[2471.56 - 2478.96] motherload it shows your true strength
[2475.24 - 2481.64] fatigue isn't going to be your road even
