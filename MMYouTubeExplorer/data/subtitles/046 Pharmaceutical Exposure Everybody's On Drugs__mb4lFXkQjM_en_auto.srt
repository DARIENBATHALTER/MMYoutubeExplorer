right all right we're all we're getting

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,400
out what what is that in the pool

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,360
even if you're not taking a

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,480
pharmaceutical even if you're not taking

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
a drug that's prescribed by your doctor

57
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,200
you're still taking them you're taking

58
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,599
them in different forms pools and water

59
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,480
parks great way to absorb

60
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,519
Pharmaceuticals have you ever been into

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,319
a public pool or maybe a private pool

62
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,400
that many people have swam through the

63
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,920
course of the years have you ever been

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,360
to water park all of these places have

65
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,680
Pharmaceuticals inside the water I know

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,680
what you're thinking you're thinking

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,000
they chlorinate the pole it's

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,040
disinfected so there's nothing to worry

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,159
about they shock it with chlorine for

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,720
parasites bacteria and

71
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,480
algae

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,879
chlorine doesn't remove any of the

73
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,840
pharmaceutical

74
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,319
residues so how do Pharmaceuticals get

75
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,200
into the water in the pool or the water

76
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,560
park how does it get out of somebody's

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,680
body and into the water when someone

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,200
takes antibiotics anti-depressants

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,000
anti-inflammatories sleeping pills

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,879
biologics

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,480
immunosupressants prescription

82
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,840
amphetamines opioids statins blood

83
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,799
pressure medications hormone medications

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,760
thyroid medication

85
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:54,599
steroids the pill pharmaceutical alcohol

86
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,040
recreational drugs of any kind it comes

87
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,439
out through the skin it's sticking to

88
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,480
their skin in their sweat it's coming

89
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,360
out of their bodies it's in their

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,360
armpits it's in their breath it's in

91
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,640
their spit it's in their urine it's

92
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,360
everywhere so when someone's swimming in

93
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,919
the pool there's pharmaceutical runoff

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,680
that's Pharmaceuticals running off of

95
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,199
their skin coming out of their armpits

96
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,840
coming off their genitals coming out of

97
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,720
their mouth when they get water in their

98
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,720
mouth and even when they pee in the pool

99
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,520
they don't have to urinate in the pole

100
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,919
they can have a little few drops of

101
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,639
urine in their shorts and they get into

102
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:41,880
the pole or feces that hasn't been wiped

103
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,000
good it gets in the pole water and when

104
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,120
someone's taking Pharmaceuticals and

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,720
they're prescribed drugs and medications

106
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,560
or on recreational drugs it's inside

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,120
their intestinal tract so when they have

108
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:59,759
flatulence gas it's inside the

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,160
gas so when one person farts in the pole

110
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,720
that gas is filtered through the water

111
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,320
so as the gas bubbles come out of their

112
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,600
anus it's now circulating through the

113
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,960
water and it rises to the top and then

114
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,639
the gas appears people think that's

115
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,960
funny a lot of times and there's a lot

116
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,840
of jokes around it but either way that

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,440
gas was filtered through the water the

118
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,039
water acted as a filter grabbing onto

119
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,120
everything in there including residues

120
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,120
of

121
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,160
pharmaceuticals and then there's

122
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,880
pharmaceutical creams a lot of people

123
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:40,520
are on ointments prescribed by their

124
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:44,080
doctors ointments and creams acne creams

125
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,199
dermatitis creams steroids for

126
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,479
ecori creams for all kinds of different

127
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,440
ringworm creams and ointments for the

128
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:56,919
shingles creams and ointments for herpes

129
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,880
simplex one Simplex 2 creams for rashes

130
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:04,039
creams for hormones and cream and

131
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,080
ointments for poison ivy and poison oak

132
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:09,720
and then there's creams and sprays and

133
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,440
ointments for feet problems foot fungus

134
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,000
athletes foot toenail fungus and

135
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,520
fingernail fungus and there's ointments

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,160
and creams for warts warts on the feet

137
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,759
warts on the hands and there's so many

138
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,000
more creams and ointments from

139
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,599
pharmaceutical companies prescribed for

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,039
patients and over the counter at the

141
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:32,720
drugstore and of course we can't forget

142
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,759
Kim therapy drugs that are topical but

143
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,199
you might be thinking maybe none of this

144
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,560
matters you weren't swimming on the day

145
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,680
they were swimming plus all that

146
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,160
chlorine that shock to the water all

147
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,639
that fungicide to the water takes care

148
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,759
of it it's fresh and new the minute they

149
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,879
do it and then the filtration pull

150
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,440
filters that must get everything nope it

151
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,919
doesn't doesn't get anything the filter

152
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,919
doesn't filter any of the

153
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,879
Pharmaceuticals the pharmaceutical

154
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,599
runoff stays in the pole for the

155
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:11,360
lifetime of the water that's staying in

156
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,879
the pole a hotel pole could potentially

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,240
have thousands and thousands of people

158
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,720
inside that pole throughout the years

159
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,680
and a hotel may not drain the water out

160
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,160
of that pole for a decade or more the

161
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,919
pharmaceutical soup inside the pole

162
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,960
concentrates and concentrates and never

163
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,560
dissipates but don't worry don't worry

164
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,879
the pool guy will come in test the water

165
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,960
make sure everything's okay throw some

166
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,039
chlorine in there clean up a little bit

167
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,520
and everything should be great but the

168
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,520
pole guy isn't testing for

169
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,039
pharmaceuticals there could be hundreds

170
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,639
and hundreds of different

171
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,919
Pharmaceuticals in the pool water for

172
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,680
years many Pharmaceuticals that were

173
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,960
even taken off the market because they

174
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,039
were dangerous or cause

175
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,720
problems and then what about the big

176
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,360
concern that so many people have and so

177
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,639
many doctors have and health authorities

178
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,319
have which is

179
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,599
mixing Pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical

180
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,039
cocktails you can't take this drug with

181
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,120
this drug can't take these two drugs and

182
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,280
then take this drug you can't take these

183
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,400
three drugs and bring this one in boom

184
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,759
they all go bad you can't take this drug

185
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,479
and that drug at the same time if you

186
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,880
take this drug with this drug you could

187
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:35,360
have a bad reaction could even be death

188
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,760
meanwhile the pole is filled with a ton

189
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,000
of different kinds of

190
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,519
drugs all right so they open the pole

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,160
back up yeah get your towel okay yep

192
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,160
lifeguard says it's all clear

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,240
okay it's actually warm in here pretty

194
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,240
good

195
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,040
okay I just swallowed a whole gulp of

196
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,560
water

197
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,000
did you ever swallow a gulp of water in

198
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,440
a public pool did you ever swallow a

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,360
gulp of water in a private pool either

200
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,240
way it's easy to swallow a gulp of water

201
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,120
in a pole or get water in your mouth or

202
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,519
get water in your eyes nevertheless in

203
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,680
your ears and once you swallow that gulp

204
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,640
of water all that pharmaceutical residue

205
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Finds Its way inside the body gets into

206
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,360
the liver gets into the organs the

207
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,079
tissue gets to your brain and and all

208
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,959
the pharmaceutical creams they actually

209
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,320
enter into your body really easy too

210
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,600
Through Your Skin other Pharmaceuticals

211
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,720
enter your body through your skin too

212
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,839
all of it could get through your skin

213
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,560
does it even have to be in your ears

214
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,519
eyes or mouth and then what about

215
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,360
someone who's swimming that's on

216
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,320
recreational drugs weed ecstasy Molly

217
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,880
meth you don't think a meth head swims

218
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,120
what about cocaine heroin crack or just

219
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,480
anybody who's addicted icted to opioids

220
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,320
one way or another through prescription

221
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,519
Pharmaceuticals CU they were in a lot of

222
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,680
pain or someone who's a drug addict who

223
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,240
just has a connection and takes them

224
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,959
anyway either way it ends up in the pole

225
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,560
and it stays there and stays there and

226
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,399
then concentrates over time and then

227
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,720
more people come in and bring in more

228
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:26,160
Pharmaceuticals and what about the water

229
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,800
supply where did the water come from

230
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,360
originally that entered the pole and

231
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,600
then water filtration systems they don't

232
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,600
grab on to pharmaceutical residue how do

233
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,120
Pharmaceuticals get into the water

234
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,720
supply people are eliminating the

235
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Pharmaceuticals out of their body when

236
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,480
they go to the bathroom and it ends up

237
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,000
back into the water system so that when

238
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,000
we're filling our poles with water we're

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,639
filling our poles with water that has

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,800
pharmaceutical residue in it already and

241
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,639
our water supplies in general have

242
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,600
contamination in them this also means

243
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,160
that Med medication leased water can end

244
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,959
up anywhere it could become part of our

245
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,000
food through reservoirs irrigation

246
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:12,040
Public Water Supplies wellwater near

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
septic tanks and fish swimming in lakes

248
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,600
rivers and oceans all absorbing

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,720
pharmaceutical residue and maybe you're

250
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,600
thinking you haven't swam in a pole for

251
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,519
a very very long time like years but

252
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,600
guess what when you did swim in that

253
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,880
pool a long time ago that pharmaceutical

254
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,560
resident do got into your body and

255
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,079
stayed there unless you're doing

256
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,800
something actively trying to remove it

257
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:40,360
or get it out or cleanse it or if you're

258
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,399
brushing your teeth with the water or

259
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,320
cooking with tap water or eating at at

260
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,920
restaurants or getting coffee at

261
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,279
restaurants drinking tea in restaurants

262
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,040
you're getting that pharmaceutical

263
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:54,240
treated water and restaurant water

264
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,959
normally contains pharmaceutical run off

265
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,760
this isn't about fear this isn't about

266
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,279
not being able to live your life that's

267
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,000
not not it it's being aware of what's

268
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,560
happening out there so you can do

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,240
something about it so you can be

270
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,399
proactive

271
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,160
empowered because it's Death By A

272
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,360
Thousand Cuts it chips away at us over

273
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,240
time and then when we get sick how do we

274
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,880
get better fast how do we look out for

275
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,480
the pitfalls the

276
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,000
potholes and how do we get rid of the

277
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,000
pharmaceutical exposure even if we're

278
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,040
taking Pharmaceuticals prescribed by our

279
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,760
doctors we still want to cleanse out the

280
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,320
old stuff the residue

281
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,600
our bodies are up against a lot we

282
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,880
already have a difficult time naturally

283
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,240
detoxing anything here on planet Earth

284
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,079
our bodies have a difficult time enough

285
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,560
getting rid of natural bodily toxins

286
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:48,600
we're not designed to get rid of all

287
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,000
these different chemicals and metals and

288
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,560
man-made Industrial Waste not to mention

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,440
things that were exposed to every day

290
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,639
fragrances colognes perfumes cleaning

291
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,360
products and then there's pesticides

292
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,880
herbicides fungicides we get it on us

293
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,639
all the time just buying brand new

294
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,160
clothes our body gets exposed to so many

295
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,480
different chemicals from that alone our

296
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,959
bodies are not indestructible they're

297
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,000
not meant to receive all these different

298
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,519
toxins and poisons and get

299
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,519
bombarded and at the same time our

300
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,199
bodies are resilient and they're strong

301
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,120
but they have a breaking point we take

302
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:27,600
our bodies for granted here on planet

303
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,480
Earth and then when our body starts to

304
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,199
fail like we get symptoms and conditions

305
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,160
we're not feeling good we listen to

306
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:38,120
people telling us it's our fault our

307
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,440
body's fault then we end up hating our

308
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,320
bodies we start blaming our bodies

309
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,240
thinking that they're faulty they're not

310
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,600
working good how come we can't get out

311
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:52,440
of the sickness or the symptom your body

312
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,240
can't just tell you hey mister we got

313
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,519
exposed something got into us when we

314
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,880
were swimming all these Pharmaceuticals

315
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,399
entered us our bodies can't say hey did

316
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,720
you know that tap water that was used in

317
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:10,320
the coffee at the fancy coffee shop was

318
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,360
toxic and it got something into us and

319
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,560
our bodies can't say Hey listen all that

320
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,959
tap water we're using for the shower and

321
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,360
the bathroom and for your coffee and for

322
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:23,320
your food is all saturated with

323
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,079
Pharmaceuticals and getting in us and I

324

just need a little help getting it out

325
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:31,440
of us our bodies need assistance they

326
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,720
need help they want to heal they're

327
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,639
fighting for us it's important to be

328
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,040
aware of all the different things that

329
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,759
our body is up against this isn't about

330
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,120
never swimming again or drinking

331
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,959
something from a restaurant it's just

332
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,399
about becoming empowered because all of

333
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,560
these different toxins like

334
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,279
pharmaceutical runoff from other people

335
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,120
going into your own body sits in us and

336
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,160
sits in us and it builds up over time

337
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,240
and it becomes something that gets in

338
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:05,079
the way down the road find out more

339
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,759
information on how to get rid of certain

340
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:11,160
toxins such as pharmaceutical exposure

341
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:14,720
in the brain saver books if you're on a

342
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:18,279
medication you know you're on a

343
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,519
medication if you're on a drug you know

344
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:24,440
if you're on a drug your doctor

345
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,839
prescribed it if you're doing drugs

346
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,240
recreationally you know you're doing

347
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,680
drugs you're on them

348
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,920
there's a knowing they were administered

349
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,639
or you're partaking in choosing to use

350
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,079
them and that's okay because you know

351
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,199
that's what you're doing any residue

352
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,160
from those drugs and pharmaceuticals is

353
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:50,240
in your liver it's in your body it's in

354
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,279
your bloodstream it's in your brain for

355
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,319
years to come but what about the drugs

356
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,079
and pharmaceuticals you're unaware of

357
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,079
what about the ones we collect

358
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,519
throughout our life in the ways we've

359
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,800
talked about what about the ones that

360
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:11,040
enter us without our permission without

361
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,440
our intentions without our own free will

362
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,839
we didn't have a choice they just

363
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:21,399
entered us they invaded us and our body

364
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,759
cries for help along the way we develop

365
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,920
symptoms and conditions from so many

366
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:30,279
different things that our body is

367
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,079
exposed to but this is just one of those

368
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:36,160
very things our body ends up

369
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:39,040
battling but we can turn it all around

370
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:45,240
we can give our bodies what they need we
