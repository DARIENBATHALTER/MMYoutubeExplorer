I'm excited about this where does this

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,559
detoxing thing come from where does the

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,000
term come from what is it about so I

22
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,719
want to cover a couple things in the

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,600
conventional World detox meant people

24
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:03,320
going into a clinic and going through

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,760
pharmaceutical withdrawal just for the

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,560
record okay it wasn't about anything

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,240
else besides going into a clinic and

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,240
coming off of

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,560
morphine that's the term detox in the

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,240
conventional

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,040
mindset very important really important

32
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,880
topic here a lot of people are like I'm

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,200
detoxing too much or I'm not detoxing

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,280
enough or what's going on or my adrenals

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,960
are hurt because I'm detoxing very

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,840
important information we're covering but

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:37,079
the conventional World detox was going

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,439
into a clinic because you're on too much

39
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,280
pharmaceutical and you're coming off of

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,840
it or coming off of morphine or coming

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,280
off of oxies or coming off of something

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,759
else or even like benzo despine or

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,560
something right coming off of heavy

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,880
drugs and originally going back was

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,079
morphine that's what it was about it's

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,719
just all about morphine just letting you

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,520
know and so that's where detox comes

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:05,439
from on a conventional mindset on an

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,879
alternative mindset get ready for this

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,879
it's the old hygienic movement term

51
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,000
detoxing now I want to cover this

52
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,560
thoroughly this is important how did it

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,879
come about well the word detox came

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,800
about because people lived who lived in

55
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,920
the

56
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,040
cities were living in the toxic smog of

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,480
the factories and all of the toxic

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,720
surroundings and the car exhaust so what

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,480
would happen is people would be also

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,280
eating restaurant food too at the same

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:45,200
time and early canned and packaged food

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:48,840
early stuff early 1900s late 1800s old

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,239
canaries canning all the food packaged

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,599
food back then yeah and so it was all

65
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,480
about like lead cans and all that other

66
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,440
stuff so it was about toxic Lifestyles

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,560
so it was about getting out of the city

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,799
stopping partying and getting off of

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,879
recreational drugs very important to

70
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,720
know so in the alternative mindset

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,000
detox was all about getting away from

72
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,799
the fastpaced lifestyle of the day of

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,480
the 1890s and the early

74
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:24,360
1900s it was all about the early drug

75
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,439
movement it was all about the canned

76
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,080
food and it was all about the partying

77
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,400
and all about the MOG and the city

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,159
living and so detoxing would be get you

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,640
out of that environment in the early

80
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,519
1900s get you into a Country Manor

81
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,159
somewhere right in the Hills or

82
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,519
somewhere fresh air birds

83
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:52,720
chirping kind of like sanitarium kind of

84
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,200
like something that's a paradise nature

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,920
getting away from the toxic lifestyle of

86
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,680
the world the fast-paced world okay that

87
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,959
was also part of the alternative mind

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,200
mindset of detoxing and that even was

89
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,519
partly with the conventional mindset too

90
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,799
going back that far too a little bit but

91
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,120
conventional mindset mainly focused on

92
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,120
like getting off of morphine that was

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,680
the detox all right so let's cut into

94
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,320
this a little bit then the Whole Foods

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,680
you know movement just eating like

96
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,960
fruits and

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:31,639
vegetables herbs okay and getting away

98
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:35,000
from meat and this isn't a anti-meat

99
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,600
talk or anti- you know animal protein

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,360
talk or anything that's not what this is

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,520
at all but it was the early days the

102
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,560
early 1900s it was about getting away

103
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:49,440
from restaurant food and

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,000
beef and getting out of the

105
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,759
cities and getting into a cleaner

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,800
environment and getting off of all that

107
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,120
heavy animal meat okay so that was the

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,039
early alternative movement and instead

109
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,520
it was about eating nuts and seeds and

110
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,440
walnuts and almonds and cashews or

111
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,680
whatever you know different seeds and

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,960
all about that and sprouted grains and

113
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,919
it was all about getting out of the

114
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,759
cycle everybody was in the early 1900s

115
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,199
where they were eating meat and

116
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:29,120
restaurant food and were were using high

117
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,120
salt and we in the smog and pollution

118
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
and stress and it was about getting

119
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
somebody out the hygienic movement was

120
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,000
birthing and it was about getting that

121
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,000
person out of

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,880
that so they can actually be fre they

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,840
would they would get them off meat and

124
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,680
they would put them on nuts and seeds

125
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,600
instead of meat and this would be all

126
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,039
part of their

127
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,479
detox see so the hygienic movement was

128
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,360
birthed out of this

129
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,720
mindset and the hygienic movement was

130
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,240
all about your toxin sick so now you

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,039
need to

132
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,720
detox see where I'm going this is so

133
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,080
important you guys I I want you to watch

134
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,440
this from the beginning a couple of

135
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,840
times if you can this is going to answer

136
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,120
a billion questions I

137
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,080
think and but the point is is so

138
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,880
alternative medicine was about animal

139
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,599
protein was making you sick do you guys

140
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,000
get get my gist here I'm not saying

141
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,919
animal protein makes you sick when have

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,880
I ever said that that animal protein you

143
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,639
know medical medium's never been about

144
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,599
one or the other it's not has an

145
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,599
attacked animal meat the point is is

146
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:40,199
that the early hygienic movement was

147
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:43,720
you're sick hear me now don't miss this

148
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,479
point you're sick because you're eating

149
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,440
animal

150
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:52,479
meat and you have to get away from that

151
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,840
and go plant-based plant

152
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,360
foods and that's the hygienic movement

153
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,840
you are

154
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,680
toxic and then as the hygienic movement

155
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,160
grew a little a little bit more desserts

156
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,720
and sweets and

157
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,360
treats were all part of it

158
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,000
too so what happens is if you lived a

159
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,440
conventional lifestyle in the

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,120
1930s the

161
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,039
1940s and you weren't feeling well they

162
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,560
would say you need to take away all the

163
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,160
sweets all of the

164
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,919
Delicacies all of the rich

165
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,599
food all of the meat

166
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,319
Burgers they all had to go the hygienic

167
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,960
movement but there's something really

168
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,080
important to understand about this which

169
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,840
will blow your

170
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,479
mind the alternative hygienic movement

171
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,199
did not know why you were sick they

172
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,400
didn't know why someone had

173
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,120
Tremors they didn't know why someone

174
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,759
couldn't walk because they had like

175
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,479
wobblers they didn't know why someone

176
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,919
was fatigued deathly fatigued and

177
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,960
bedridden they didn't know why people

178
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,000
had all kinds of different

179
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,159
symptoms from severe brain fog to ticks

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,759
and spasms to aches and pains to tingles

181
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:11,840
and numbness to not being able to sleep

182
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,840
to everything from anxiety to depression

183
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,960
to trigeminal neuralgia to pain in their

184
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,599
jaw their neck their head everything

185
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,000
they did not know why anyone had any of

186
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,039
this this is so important the

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,840
alternative hygienic movement of Health

188
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,120
knew that you should detox that's they

189
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,440
called it they did not know why anyone

190
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,000
was sick they just thought it was

191
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,200
because you're toxic you needed to detox

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,320
that's all that's all they

193
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,159
knew and they only knew that up

194
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,680
until

195
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,959
until now the medical medium info about

196
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,440
bugs and pathogens and Epstein bars and

197
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,920
hhb6 is making people sick and metals

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
and all of that that wasn't in the

199
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,880
hygienic frame it wasn't in the hygienic

200
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,880
movement of Alternative Health at all on

201
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,720
any level they only thought in the let's

202
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,320
move pack now out of the 30 out of the

203
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,880
40s out of 1950s let's move up to the

204
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,680
80s they still believe the hygienic

205
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,240
movement you just toxic and you needed

206
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,040
to detox that's why you're sick and

207
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,519
bedridden that's why you're not well

208
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,760
that's why you got ticks and spasms

209
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,760
aches and pains and your body's

210
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,560
vibrating and got all these

211
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,920
problems I still did not know that there

212
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:26,200
were real reasons why people were sick

213
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,720
because face it everybody's toxic then

214
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,320
everyone is toxic you got

215
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,079
understand this right you mean a UPS

216
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,519
driver and the lawyer working at a law

217
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,200
firm and the waitress working at the

218
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,079
diner and the person checking out in the

219
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,920
grocery store and the person working at

220
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,720
this other place and the construction

221
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,839
guy working here and the you know the

222
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,560
bus driver that's working out there you

223
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,959
mean to tell me and the doctor that's

224
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,640
working here you mean to tell me they're

225
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,079
all not toxic they're all out there

226
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,600
living their life and they're living

227
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,720
their life toxic but they may not be

228
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,760
sick in the moment they may not be sick

229
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,480
right now they may not have a whole

230
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,040
bunch of symptoms you see what I'm

231
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,440
saying so what would happen is everybody

232
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,640
think about it everybody's toxic and

233
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,160
everybody has toxins in them but the

234
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,000
scale hasn't tipped yet or they haven't

235
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,800
gotten sick yet so back to the

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,120
alternative hygienic movement

237
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,760
again so the hygienic movement just

238
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,079
believed you were toxic and that's all

239
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,079
they believed that's it that you had a

240
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:37,800
detox it's a belief system it is a

241
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,440
belief system ingrained in early

242
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,320
alternative medicine please listen to

243
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,240
this if you can and that belief system

244
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,639
that was

245
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,639
ingrained is still floating around right

246
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,000
now and everybody's like your detox

247
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,040
Pathways your detoxing too much or you

248
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,720
don't know how to detox you're sick cuz

249
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,440
you're detoxing too heavy you're

250
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,639
bedridden because you're toxic in your

251
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,240
detox they're still passing it around

252
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,440
now it comes early comes from the early

253
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,560
1920s the early

254
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,800
1930s and that hygienic sense of detox

255
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,200
is still haunting everybody to this

256
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,639
day and that's the sad part confusion

257
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,200
with detox is probably one of the most

258
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:26,000
crazy epidemic things that's happening

259
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,279

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,519

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,199
enough you're detoxing too much your

294
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,000
detox Pathways aren't working how would

295
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:59,360
you know how' you know your detox

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,560
pathways are working

297
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,880
nobody knows that what there's some kind

298
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,199
of computerized Imaging machine of some

299
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,240
kind that can just you could stand in

300
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:10,839
front and be like yeah see your detox

301
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,600
pathway is not really run uh what is

302
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,959
going out of your kidney huh doesn't

303
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,360
exist it's make believe make

304
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,839
believe so what's happened right now is

305
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,000
the term detox has been weaponized it is

306
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,920
weaponized and whenever something's

307
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,880
weaponized people are going to get hurt

308
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,120
they're going to get hurt they're going

309
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,320
to get hurt

310
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,880
and they are because it's a total

311
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,320
confused vest of the

312
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,680
mind and you see it every day out there

313
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,920
so let's go into it a little bit more

314
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,800
the hygienic

315
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,480
movement just thinks people are sick

316
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,880
because they need a detox that's all

317
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,120
it's all they think it's an old staple

318
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,160
it's been around and it's what you think

319
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,600
you go back to the 80s you're toxic you

320
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,680
go back to the '90s you're toxic toxic

321
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,000
that's why that's all it is and you need

322
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,000
a detox until you're

323
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:12,279
healed but what happens if you don't

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,959
heal oh you're not detoxed enough or

325
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,720
you're detoxing too

326
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,560
much nobody knows which way to go and

327
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,000
nobody knows which way the wind blows on

328
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,480
that it's Madness so let's clear the ear

329
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,959
a little bit and what's happening so

330
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,759
back to Conventional medicine and

331
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,320
conventional mindset detox was just

332
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,360
getting off of morphine

333
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,320
alternative and detox was just getting

334
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,480
off the morphine and leaving the cities

335
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,600
alternative movement was detox was just

336
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,240
getting rid of the riches and the sweets

337
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,560
and getting out of the Cities out of the

338
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,920
smog and that's it that's the reason why

339
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,519
you're sick you're sick because you've

340
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,320
eaten too much beef and you've gotten

341
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,279
too much beef in your

342
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,279
gut and you made yourself sick that is

343
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,120
the original

344
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:58,600
detoxification mindset there is it's

345
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,639
beef it's beef it's beef that's what it

346
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,839
is it is

347
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,320
1906 beef that's why you're sick baby

348
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,720
1910 it's beef that's why you're sick

349
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,120
baby 1920 beef is why you're sick and

350
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:19,360
some smog 1930 beef is why you're sick

351
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,279
and some smog 1940 beef again and some

352
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,000
smog do you

353
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:30,600
see that is how it really happened and

354
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,600
what goes down and has gone down

355
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,880
now don't take this as I'm anti- beef or

356
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,839
I'm anti- anything I'm just telling you

357
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,680
about the history because nobody knows

358
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,160
the history the history is critical and

359
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,040
the details matter with

360
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:49,319
this so then we went into the like weak

361
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:52,399
grass movement coming into the mid 70s

362
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:54,120
and early 70s where you're toxic and you

363
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,360
need to cleanse and you need to get on

364
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,000
your wheat grass and you need to get the

365
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,079
toxins out and that's why you're sick

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,120
and then it moved into the 80s you're

367
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,560
toxic because you know and you got to

368
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,759
get off the beef again and you got to

369
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,680
get off this junk and garbage in the

370
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,560
riches and the sweets you got to get off

371
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,240
of this and stop eating your chocolate

372
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,880
cake every day cuz you're

373
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,279
toxic that's where it all stems from and

374
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,639
comes from and it's haunted us since and

375
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,680
it's still haunting everybody now it's

376
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,360
just mindset of you're toxic you got to

377
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,120
detox and it's nothing but but

378
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,040
detox and that's the mindset coming from

379
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,519
the hygienic movement which has cursed

380
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,199
it has

381
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,639
cursed alternative wellness and health

382
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:47,680
it has cursed

383
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:50,720
it so there is a curse upon the health

384
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,279
movement and that curse will destroy and

385
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,079
ruin

386
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,360
lives 3 years from now someone gets sick

387
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,800
for the first time in their life and

388
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,240
they go into the health movement they're

389
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,959
on the internet and they're talking to

390
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,880
this person that person this doctor and

391
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,160
this practitioner this coach and this in

392
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,880
the end they're just going to get told

393
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,559
they're probably detoxing too heavy or

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,079
detoxing too much whether they're not

395
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,000
detoxing enough or something to do with

396
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:16,039
detox and they'll be

397
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,400
cursed good luck trying to heal good

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,200

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,880
okay very important to know what

410
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,799
happened was people got sick nobody knew

411
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,400
why they thought it was a tickborne

412
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:58,200
illness and then they ran antibiotics

413
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,640
heavily into women women that already

414
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,200
had immune system problems and their

415
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,679
immune systems were breaking down and

416
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,600
they already were struggling physically

417
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:10,000
with their health they nuked them they

418
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:13,480
nuked thousands upon thousands of women

419
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,559
in the 70s and the 80s and the '90s and

420
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,480
they destroyed their lives they ruined

421
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:21,640
their lives they killed many of them off

422
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:26,720
they killed thousands of women off by

423
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:30,320
nuking them with antibiotics for Lyme

424
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,320
disease Untold

425
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,600
damage

426
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,799
Carnage because of the Lyme disease

427
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,640
situation where nobody knew why people

428
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:41,400
were sick they thought it was the tick

429
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,960
they thought that's what it was women

430
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,840
had all these weird symptoms

431
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,960
neurological symptoms and aches and

432
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,080
pains and they nuked them and they broke

433
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,799
their immune systems down and they threw

434
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,919
these people's lives away there are some

435
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,760
doctors now that are out there on the

436
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,440
scene including podcast doctors that

437
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,080
partook in this very thing in the 80s

438
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,080
and 90s and have blood on their

439
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,799
hands now what what happened out of that

440
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,000
was called the

441
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,880
herxheimer the die off you guys get

442
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,520
where I'm going right now the die

443
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,360
off so another place the detox actually

444
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,720
was supported through the hygienic

445
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,440
movement was when

446
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,039
basically the lime doctors were like

447
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,400
well I've heard detox my whole career

448
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,760
I've heard detox from medical clinics

449
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,159
getting people off of drugs I've heard

450
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,799
detox through alternative people talking

451
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,799
about how they're toxic and and they

452
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,760
need to cleanse and they need to get rid

453
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,400
of all those toxins so what I think is

454
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,320
happening to every time I put

455
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,960
antibiotics in a patient is I think

456
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,480
they're getting sicker because they're

457
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,120
having a die

458
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,200
off so the lme disease World which was

459
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,559
huge big billions of dollars of Industry

460
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,840
still is now they were nuking women

461
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:09,159
literally day in and day out running

462
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,039
powerful antibiotics throughout their

463
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:15,799
system annihilating their

464
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,840
bodies and then when women complain and

465
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:21,559
said I can't walk no more I can't talk I

466
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,919
can't think I think I'm dying they would

467
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:29,320
say it's die off you're detoxing the

468
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:33,280
lime bacteria and it's die off

469
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:36,440
so the messages were

470
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,679
mixed so not only do we have the early

471
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,799
hygienic detoxification talk from Smog

472
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,440
and what they said was too much

473
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,880
meat you also have the conventional

474
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,960
world with their detoxification talk of

475
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,600
getting off of morphine and drugs and

476
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,320
stuff and then you have the Lyme disease

477
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,600
World saying how this lime bacteria is

478
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,760
making women sick so when we hit them

479
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,840
with antibiotics the lime bacteria is

480
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,840
dying they're going into herxheimer's

481
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,600
and it's just detox do you guys see

482
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,760
where I'm going right

483
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,799
now detox has cursed so many people

484
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,000
literally cursed them to death you guys

485
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:17,440
have no idea what it has done and it has

486
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,039
destroyed lives from early on back in

487
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,520
the day all the way till today including

488
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:26,240
in Lyme disease and so forth it is the

489
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,799
curse of the alternative movement and

490
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
hell you might be fine cuz you might not

491
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,320
be that sick and you're just playing

492
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,320
around this product and that product and

493
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,440
you're over here playing around this and

494
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,919
seite and whatnot and bentonite clay and

495
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,440
charcoal and sow sweat off your brow and

496
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,279
then you got some person a woman laying

497
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,360
in their bed dying because they're

498
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,919
they're literally dying from like all

499
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,400
these kinds of other things I'm talking

500
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,360
about that were inter interwoven into

501
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,600
the detox talk throughout the whole

502
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,000
Century that has cursed people and it's

503
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,000
killing

504
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,480
people so the lime

505
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,080
movement

506
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,799
wasted tens of thousands upon thousands

507
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,799
of women's

508
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,320
lives there are thousands of graves with

509
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,559
women in there that died from being

510
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,080
bombarded through the lime

511
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:23,159
therapies no one gives a

512
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,279
crap no one

513
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:29,919
cares whatever because that's how this

514
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:33,760
dirty World Works anyway

515
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,360
so detox has grown into so many

516
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,039
different things throughout the course

517
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,080
of the hundred

518
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,600
years and the confusion with detox is

519
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,039
vast

520
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,080
now so let's go into a little bit

521
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,000
more as far as Lyme disease goes it was

522
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,720
the harsh antibiotic usage that was

523
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,159
eating away at the innards of people

524
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,960
that caused their symptoms to be worse

525
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,400
and then it was blamed on herxheimer's

526
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,720
which was pathogen die

527
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,039
off and pathogen die off took the hit

528
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,159
right there that was the excuse and they

529
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:14,679
used that into the they packaged it up

530
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:17,279
to the detox realm you're just detoxing

531
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:21,039
pathogen die off

532
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,039
right and that's why you're

533
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,880
suffering so let's go into a little

534
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,880
deeper on

535
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
this

536
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,159
the hygienic movement moved into the

537
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,200
vegan movement the vegan movement still

538
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,360
believes if you eat

539
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,960
meat that's why you're

540
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,320
sick the vegan movement still believes

541
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,520
that if you eat meat that's why you're

542
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,000
still sick you ever notice I never took

543
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,000
a stand either way did you ever notice

544
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
since the Inception of the first book to

545
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,880
any information I've ever given out

546
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,320
previous I never said that you know V

547
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,240
vegan vegan's the only way animal

548
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,159
protein animal protein's the only way

549
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,720
cuz it's not about these belief systems

550
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,480
it's really about what's wrong with a

551
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,880
person and why they're sick it's one

552
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,760
size of it's all was never medical

553
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,880
medium and all that proves

554
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,880
it but the vegans believe that beef is

555
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,720
why you were sick and you're toxic and

556
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,960
you need a detox that's what the vegans

557
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,080
believed all these years they stemmed it

558
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,919
off of the hygienic movement originally

559
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,799
where you were just toxic and you needed

560
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,640
to

561
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,520
detox

562
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,760
let's go into this a little bit deeper

563
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,640
now I'm going to move the chocolate cake

564
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,760
over

565
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,960
okay got a liver and a couple other

566
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,960
things all

567
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,159
right you guys I got celery juice right

568
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,399
here if you don't mind I'm going to take

569
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,399
another

570
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,120
sip

571
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:58,399
okay singy sweee says over there on

572
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:59,919
YouTube is that's the vegan movement I

573
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,440
guess I'm vegan without following the

574
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,799
beliefs of the movement I just thought

575
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,799
it was saving animals a lot of people go

576
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:06,600
vegan because they're saving animals

577
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,640
they

578
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,240
do but the majority of all vegans

579
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,640
plant-based people vegans whatever you

580
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,279
want to call them the majority of all of

581
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,120
them go plant-based and go vegan because

582
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:21,720
they got symptoms and they got sick

583
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,120
that's why they went that direction

584
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,360
there's a small small percentage that's

585
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,240
worried about animals and they stick to

586
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,320
that that moral grounding and they're

587
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,399
just like you know animals have souls

588
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,279
and they don't want to eat animals and

589
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,840
there's there's a small percentage then

590
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,600
they go vegan because of that but the

591
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,880
majority of all of them they go vegan

592
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:45,399
because they got sick or a symptom of

593
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:48,279
some kind and they went vegan because of

594
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:50,760
that so let's get into

595
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,960
detoxing all

596
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,600
right people are sick because

597
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,159
something's making them

598
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,200
sick meat is not making someone sick

599
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,480
I'm not pro meat I'm not anti- meat I'm

600
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,480
just saying meat is not making somebody

601
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,200
sick Mr Jones eats all the meat he wants

602
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,919
he's not sick Mrs Jones eats all the

603
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,159
meat she wants she's sick why is it Mr

604
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,039
Jones sick Mr Jones is sick what meat's

605
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,840
making M Jones sick NOP meat's Not

606
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,840
Making Mr Jones

607
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,840
sick there's people out there that are

608
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,039
eating all kinds of crazy stuff they're

609
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,039
eating all kinds of toxic stuff or what

610
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,320
you want to call toxic desserts and

611
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,480
sweets packaged food fried greasy food

612
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,200
and yeah eventually they'll get sick

613
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,840
from something and then you got somebody

614
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,240
who's eating very clean and they're

615
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,200
eating good and they're eating

616
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,080
everything that's coming from the best

617
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,840
farm and they're eating all their fruits

618
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,720
and vegetables and they're eating what

619
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,679
whatever and they're sick and they have

620
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,600
symptoms and they're

621
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,600
struggling because it's not about

622
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,159
detoxing it's about what's wrong with

623
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,600
you what is inside of you what what is

624
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,440
actually inside of

625
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,480
you and that's the key that the hygienic

626
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,200
movement did not know the hygienic

627
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,440
movement the early hygienic movement

628
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,120
going all the way into the modern

629
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,520
hygienic movement did not know people

630
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,679
were sick because of pathogens just

631
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,039
literally six seven years ago the

632
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,159
hygienic people right now today that are

633
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:26,240
plant-based still didn't think pathogens

634
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,320
had anything to do with any there is

635
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,240
data that I even have saved I could not

636
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,080
help it because I saw literally people

637
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,559
that were plant-based in the hygienic

638
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,320
movement just in 2018 saying how

639
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,320
pathogens did not

640
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,320
exist and Epstein bar was a joke and

641
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,519
does not exist and that you're sick

642
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,120
because you're toxic that's all you're

643
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:53,519
eating too much animal protein it even

644
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:57,600
CAU brought us all the way up to 2018

645
00:27:53,519 --> 00:28:00,200
and 19 and it finally come 2020 when see

646
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,159
hit town and when SE hit town

647
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,039
everybody's like viral viral viral viral

648
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:08,320

649
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:10,360
have to wear masks it's viral and what

650
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,480
happens is that explosion all of a

651
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,559
sudden opened up The Floodgate so now

652
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,960
everybody's like oh yeah EP bar now oh

653
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,519

bugs there's different bugs shingles

656
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:25,559
epine bar there's different bugs oh yeah

657
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,519
I didn't know the fever blister was a

658
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:29,919
virus I had no idea oh my God the fever

659
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:31,720
blister you're right I just thought you

660
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,519
were toxic and the hygienic movement

661
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,320
believed that a fever blister wasn't

662
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:41,720
viral did you know that in the 80s the

663
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:44,600
1990s the 2000s all the way to 2010 even

664
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,799
past that herpes simplex one was not a

665
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,200
virus it's believed by the plant-based

666
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,880
hygienic

667
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,320
movement and whatever gurus you call in

668
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,600
those movement believe that it wasn't a

669
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,200
virus viruses weren't real they weren't

670
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,640
anything you were just toxic and that's

671
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,399
where detox is really a poisonous thing

672
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,279
because it stems from such confusion and

673
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:12,200
misinformation from old belief systems

674
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,720
that still are there and have been

675
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,679
around I can promise you this if you

676
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,159
have a fever blister and that sucker's

677
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,960
popping on your lip and you go and you

678
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:24,600
kiss another person there's a very good

679
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,720
chance that fever blister that virus is

680
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,919
going to transfer onto that other

681
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,480
person's and they're going to have the

682
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,240
herpes simplex sv1 if they didn't

683
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,200
already have it HSV they're already

684
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,799
going to have

685
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,200
it right from that

686
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,919
kiss if they didn't have it

687
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,919
before so herpes simplex one herpes

688
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,279
simplex 2 are real viruses but so are

689
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,760
all the other viruses too and we can

690
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,919
catch them and transfer them in the

691
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,120
whole bit and it can catch up to us we

692
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,760
can go through our 20s and we can

693
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:02,720
actually catch three or four or six or

694
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,720
seven Epstein bars maybe even 20 Epstein

695
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,720
bars we can catch they can lay dormant

696
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,000
inside of us and then as we're heading

697
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,880
into our 30s our immune system starts to

698
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,880
lower we're doing things that can

699
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,840
trigger us maybe we're eating all the

700
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,440
wrong things that can trigger us meaning

701
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,240
they lower the immune system a little

702
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,039
maybe we go into some emotional stress

703
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,399
or hardship and all of a sudden we get

704
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,159
the scale tips and now we're sick and

705
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,039
we're like I don't know what's going on

706
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,279
my digestion and my floating and I'm

707
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:32,840
feeling kind of off and I don't feel

708
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:35,320
good overall and something's wrong and

709
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,840
what's happening is the epscene bar is

710
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,880
catching

711
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,840
up the herpy simplex one is catching up

712
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,039
the cyeg virus is catching up all the

713
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,960
metals that have been built up in your

714
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,799
brain and in your body are catching up

715
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,000
all the chemicals and all the fragrances

716
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,399
are catching up everything is catching

717
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,600
up and it's all building up but the

718
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:00,600
pathogens are the big one it determines

719
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,880
if someone is going to be really

720
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,440
struggling they're going to be bedridden

721
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,320
brain fogged not feeling

722
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,399
well the pathogens are going to be that

723
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,840
determination that's the big one right

724
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:16,760
there and the hygienic movement based

725
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,279
around the detox Theory and the belief

726
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:22,159
system that's developed all those years

727
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,360
doesn't even didn't even believe that a

728
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,279
virus had anything to do with I was

729
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,279
talking to guys back a decade ago

730
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:32,880
and they were just like aw I just don't

731
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:34,919
get it there are no pathogens in the

732
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,080
vegan in the plant-based hygienic

733
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,240
movement it's all about detox you just

734
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,320
need to detox and detox your

735
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,840
Pathways they were

736
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:51,880
lost they were lost now it kills them to

737
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:56,159
have to say virus kills them to have to

738
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:59,320
utter the word EBV I remember

739
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,519
distinctly an influencer ripping me

740
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,760
apart back in 201718 about epine bar

741
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,159
calling me the epine bar guy ripping me

742
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,679
apart and he was from the hygienic

743
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,399
movement belief system didn't even

744
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,279
believe the Epstein bar meanwhile the

745
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,840
guy probably had 10 Epstein bars lay

746
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,840
dormant in

747
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,840
him

748
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,600
easy so let's go into detox at another

749
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:31,000
level now it's just kind of a little bit

750
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,000
of an m M school today about

751
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,159
detoxing

752
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,559
so do we have to cleanse do we have to

753
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,360
get rid of poisons and toxins yes but

754
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,760
they don't take us down they don't make

755
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,679
us so sick we can't

756
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,440
function they

757
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,880
don't unless you're in a clinic because

758
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,279
you've been taking heroin for a year and

759
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,159
you're so jacked up on heroin you're so

760
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,480
jacked up that you're in this clinic and

761
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:05,519
you got to go through withdrawal that's

762
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,480
different that's different if you're

763
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:12,279
living your life and you got

764
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,840
sick detoxification isn't what is giving

765
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:16,200
you your

766
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,000
symptoms I've said it in medical medium

767
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,320
books and I've said it probably in radio

768
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,840
shows and so

769
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,480
forth that if you're highly highly toxic

770
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,120
and you're really really sensitive that

771
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,880
yes as you're cleansing you can feel

772
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:33,639
malaise a little more tired than

773
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,399
normal maybe a little

774
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:39,519
headachy but you won't get a massive

775
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,960
eruption of all kinds of rashes you

776
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,080
won't get like thrown where your legs

777
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,440
feel like cement and you're bedridden

778
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,559
you won't get all these ticks and spasms

779
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,360
and aches and pains and feeling like

780
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,760
you're literally dying you won't get all

781
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,760
of

782
00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:00,440
that and and which leads to this next

783
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,440
next part here which is really

784
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,559
important when someone starts to do

785
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,119
something good for themselves and they

786
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,760
are and everything seems to be okay and

787
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,919
they're doing a little celery juice and

788
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,320
so forth and they're doing okay and all

789
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,760
of a sudden they get a symptom or they

790
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,679
don't feel

791
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,240
good they get

792
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,359
scared because someone will go you are

793
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:28,480
detoxing too fast you have to back up

794
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:30,119
and back down and back up out of that

795
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,960
don't do so much celery juice you're

796
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,960
going to have to back

797
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,280
out don't eat so much fruit or or greens

798
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,919
you're going to have to back

799
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,599
out somebody might be incorporating and

800
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,359
bringing some salads with some leafy

801
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:48,839
greens they might be doing 8 ounces of

802
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:48,839
celery

803
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,480
juice something's something's up on the

804
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,480
computer there and they might have they

805
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,000
might have

806
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,480
um a little bit of celery juice they

807
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,119
might be taking care of themselves they

808
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,000
might be taking out things like things

809
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,720
that they shouldn't be eating so much of

810
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,560
they might be removing things they might

811
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,440
be removing alcohol they might be

812
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,520
removing stuff out of their diet and

813
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,160
they're starting to get better and

814
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,400
starting to feel pretty good and they're

815
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,800
living their life and four months later

816
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,160
they start getting a symptom and they

817
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,480
start getting sick and then they're like

818
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,920
what's going on I'm doing 8 ounces of

819
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,200
celery juice I'm doing my leafy green

820
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,800
salad every day I haven't had fast food

821
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:36,200
too often I only had one chocolate dut

822
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,320
uh last month why am I feeling a symptom

823
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,320
it's what's wrong and then someone's

824
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,119
going to say to them on the computer or

825
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,599
somewhere on the Internet or on social

826
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,160
and they're going to say you're detoxing

827
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,800
too heavy you need to stop doing what

828
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,440
you're doing you need to get more fats

829
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,160
you need to get more things you want to

830
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,760
eat in you you're you're you're getting

831
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,079
emotional cuz you can't eat what you

832
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,800
want you feel restricted you need a stop

833
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,079
what you're doing you're detoxing too

834
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,920
much because you're getting sick cuz

835
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,560
you're detoxing too much of back off

836
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,240
back off and then the person goes oh my

837
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,839
God oh my God I'm scared I'm scared what

838
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,599
do I do and they're just like okay okay

839
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,920
just no I'm done with the celery juice

840
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,240
for now screw that medical medium you

841
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,000
know guy I'm done with the celery juice

842
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,880
I'm not going to eat so many leafy green

843
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,160
salads anymore and you're right let me

844
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,400
just order a pizza tomorrow and I am

845
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,720
detoxing too much I need to maybe bring

846
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,640
in 10 avocados or something let me slow

847
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,359
down the

848
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,040
detox but guess what they weren't

849
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:36,359
detoxing too much and their symptoms

850
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,920
weren't from detoxing their symptoms

851
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:41,240
were catching up because the bugs in

852
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,560
them and the problems in them were

853
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,640
overriding what they were doing what

854
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,760
they were doing was still not enough and

855
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,599
it wasn't enough to stop the trajectory

856
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,079
to change the trajectory of what they

857
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,560
where they were going to be they were on

858
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,200
a course of getting sick someday they

859
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,040
were on that roller coaster ride of

860
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,160
getting sick someday they were on the

861
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,800
train heading to the tunnel and on the

862
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,000
other side of that tunnel they were

863
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,000
going to be sick and that 8 ounces of

864
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,119
celery juice was keeping them stable

865
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,520
enough but guess what they got a little

866
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,240
too much exposure a few too many bugs

867
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,359
and they were on the way of getting sick

868
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,640
no matter what no matter what they were

869
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,440
getting sick and they were heading into

870
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,359
that tunnel on that

871
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,640
train and then somebody with a whole

872
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:29,800
detox BS from the Hy genic movement that

873
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,160
never knew why anyone was sick to begin

874
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,640
with and on no disrespect there's some

875
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,640
cool stuff in there like stay away from

876
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,400
this and that and you know in life and

877
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,560
stay out of the smog and make sure

878
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,440
you're getting clean water and clean air

879
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,560
and make sure you're meditating there's

880
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,040
nothing wrong with anything like that

881
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,880
but they didn't know why anybody was

882
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,000
sick and so then here you are with this

883
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:54,000
detox information and you end up saying

884
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,200
to someone you're detoxing too much stop

885
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,400
stop red flag red flag whatever you're

886
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,200
doing you better

887
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,200
stop and then the person

888
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,560
stops and then they still get sick and

889
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,800
still get sicker and still get sicker

890
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,520
and now their head is screwed up because

891
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,000
they were doing something good for

892
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,040
themselves and they were doing something

893
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,880
that could save them because they were

894
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,520
going to get sick anyway they were going

895
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,440
to get sick

896
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:28,119
anyway and now it's

897
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,400
blown you're blowing it all Sky High

898
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,400
that's

899
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,599
it what really was going on the person

900
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,160
was getting sicker and you weren't doing

901
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:45,200
enough you were not doing enough to

902
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,720
Warrant the kind of sickness you had in

903
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,119
your

904
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,040
body it wasn't about detoxing and detox

905
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,640
Pathways or anything like that it was

906
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,760
about damn you were sick and you got a

907
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,599
lot of bugs in you and they're

908
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,960
percolating and you probably got two or

909
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,119
three epscene bars one shingles one CMV

910
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,319
and probably a few other things on top

911
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,880
of that to

912
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:09,960
boot and HPV and who knows what else and

913
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,800
that's what you got going on and on top

914
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,760
of that you probably had exposures that

915
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,280
triggered you and lowered your immune

916
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,200
system instead of stopping you should be

917
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,920
moving forward even

918
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,720
more maybe you got a pesticide sprayed

919
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,800
on you outside you didn't even know it

920
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,119
they spray them in every Park in every

921
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,839
roadside they spray them everybody's

922
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,440
lawn around apartment buildings maybe

923
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:35,680
you've had a big drift of pesticides bug

924
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,920
killer and then a week later you're

925
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,680
getting showing signs of sickness and

926
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,200
somebody told you you're detoxing too

927
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,000
fast you better stop and now you really

928
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,760
got screwed because you're not going to

929
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,760
be able to heal

930
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,040
ever meanwhile what you needed to do was

931
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,960
not stop you needed to stay with the

932
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,240
good stuff and you need it

933
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:05,560
to move forward even more with

934
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:09,640
conviction to heal with faith and

935
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,640
determination and discipline to

936
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,599
heal and of course check in with your

937
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,040
doctors everybody should have a doctor

938
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,480
everybody should be asking the doctor

939
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,359
how many times have I held up a medical

940
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,880
medum book and said bring it to your

941
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,079
doctor

942
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,720
and that's what millions of people have

943
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,079
done over the last decade they brought

944
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,040
their medical medium books to their

945
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:36,319
doctors and a lot of doctors were open

946
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,480
to it and helpful and were impressed

947
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,720
with the information and liked what they

948
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,720
were

949
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,760
hearing so on the detox front Mass

950
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,400
confusion some people may be just sick

951
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,920
and some people may be really really

952
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,760
sick

953
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,720
they have old

954
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,680
Pharmaceuticals that have caused

955
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,760
damage they've

956
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:15,079
had viruses that cause

957
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:17,839
damage and when damage is done you can

958
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:21,880
be very very

959
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:25,240

Janette thousands across the globe the

1015
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:50,160
us alone thousands tens of thousands of

1016
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,119
young women and men that can't finish

1017
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,640
school and college because they're

1018
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:57,680
bedridden at home with Mom and Dad are

1019
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,559
they detoxing I'm kind of confused I'm

1020
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,720
scratching my head

1021
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:06,800
here so they're

1022
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,960
detoxing no they're not detoxic they're

1023
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,119
sick and what happens is when we're sick

1024
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,000
we need a plan we need a protocol we

1025
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,680
need to move forward we need to learn we

1026
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,200
need to heal and some as you're doing

1027
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,240
that someone's going to go you're

1028
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,559
detoxing too much you're you're way too

1029
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,400
much and that's why you're sick and all

1030
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,440
of a sudden it blurs the line wait a

1031
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,960
minute was that person ever sick or were

1032
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,319
they detoxing this whole time did they

1033
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,440
ever get sick or were they detoxing this

1034
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:37,720
whole

1035
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,880
time because the reason why it takes

1036
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,960
long for some people to heal is because

1037
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,359
they were

1038
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,680
injured when someone's liver gets really

1039
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:49,640
toxic you guys and gets all these

1040
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:52,760
different things in there like scar

1041
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,599
tissue and tumors and all kinds of

1042
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,359
things inside their

1043
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:59,480
liver right

1044
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:03,160
and they got an injured

1045
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:05,880
liver detoxing isn't the thing that

1046
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,680
fixes it over night the liver's sick and

1047
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,960
it could be sick for a long time while

1048
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,119
the person's healing while the person's

1049
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,119
doing the right stuff to

1050
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,960
heal it's a lot of confusion with

1051
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,040
detoxing and it's sad because it's

1052
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,480
growing out there I watched it years ago

1053
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,839
and I saw what was happening years ago

1054
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,119
and it stems from a few individuals now

1055
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:32,440
too in the health movement that built

1056
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:36,520
their business off of detox you hear

1057
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,280
that business you hear that they

1058
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:44,800
business

1059
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:47,400
right do I sell a detoxing business no I

1060
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,000
don't but there's a few individuals in

1061
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,520
the health realm health professionals

1062
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,200
that's been selling for years detoxing

1063
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:59,119
businesses get it convincing people that

1064
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,079
they're detoxing so they can take all

1065
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,280
their alcohol herbal tinctures and such

1066
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,160
and forth right they can take all those

1067
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:10,800
things and that's been keeping the whole

1068
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,760
detox fear and Chaos alive the detox

1069
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,640
curse it's been haunting everybody for

1070
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,640
over a hundred

1071
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,480
years and that detox curse that thing's

1072
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,640
evil because I'll tell you right now

1073
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,599
it'll send somebody just out of healing

1074
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:30,480
in in a day in a minute

1075
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,359
because we lose faith we get insecure we

1076
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,960
lose confidence and all you have to hear

1077
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:37,760
is someone say it's really detox that's

1078
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,400
why you're like this and then you forget

1079
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,839
why you even got sick you didn't even

1080
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:46,280
know like how did I even get sick was it

1081
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:46,280
detox this whole time it's so

1082
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:57,800
confusing so let's go into this part if

1083
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,800
you got sick something

1084
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:04,839
busted you're really

1085
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:09,240
ill something got

1086
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:09,240
broken pathogens tend to do

1087
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,319
something pathogens tend to do something

1088
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:19,960
that's what they do

1089
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,960
okay so here's a

1090
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:29,440
nerve okay there's another nerve

1091
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:32,119
these are nerves it's another

1092
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,119
nerve some nerves down here in the lower

1093
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,119
part of your body see these

1094
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,599
nerves

1095
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,640
nerves all right when the nerves get

1096
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:48,720
damaged by

1097
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,040
pathogens they're injured healing

1098
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,960
doesn't happen

1099
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:56,960
overnight so when there's a

1100
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:00,319
pathogen in your body and that that

1101
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,119
pathogen eats away at a nerve that's why

1102
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,040
people get

1103
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:07,319
sick

1104
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,760
okay what happens is put some pathogens

1105
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:11,440
on the nerves you see this I'll put them

1106
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,960
on the nerves what happens is that you

1107
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,920
don't heal

1108
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,960
fast maybe you're somebody and you

1109
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,200
didn't get that sick yet maybe your

1110
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,520
trajectory wasn't going to get that sick

1111
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,880
maybe you have a mild upstein bar one

1112
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,079
that just caused mono at one point and

1113
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,760
then it's been kind of docile causing

1114
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,480
other symptoms as you go along and then

1115
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,760
you get the thyroid the hypothyroidism

1116
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,400
from your mono virus theep seen bar and

1117
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,720
you're not really that sick yet and

1118
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,960
you're living your life and you're doing

1119
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,200
your appointments and you're going

1120
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,720
everywhere and you're driving around and

1121
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,040
you're picking up your coffee and you're

1122
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,640
getting a massage and whatever else

1123
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,920
you're doing living your life going to

1124
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,359
meditation going here there and you're

1125
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,400
not that sick yet but you could be

1126
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,680
somebody where those bugs were a lot

1127
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,119
stronger more potent more

1128
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,920
powerful and your immune system was

1129
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:55,599
triggered enough it was beaten down with

1130
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,240
some chemical exposure maybe some far

1131
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,520
pharmaceutical exposure knock down your

1132
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,520
immune system more very important point

1133
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,319
you guys and then the bugs took off a

1134
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:08,520
little bit too much and they damaged the

1135
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:12,240
nerves nerve

1136
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,880
damage okay

1137
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,760
damage the nerves take time to heal they

1138
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,200
may not heal in a month they may not

1139
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,480
heal in six months but what happens is

1140
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,319
someone can come along and be

1141
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:27,799
like you're detoxing way too much that's

1142
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:29,359
why you're sitting there sick no you're

1143
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:32,520
sitting there

1144
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:35,079
sick because you got nerve damage and

1145
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,920
nerve damage takes time to

1146
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:41,200
heal could take

1147
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,520
years couple of years three years four

1148
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,079
years for some people if they have the

1149
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,839
right resources and the right things

1150
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:49,040
that they're doing it could take a few

1151
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:51,920
good years and then they can start

1152
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,520
coming back somebody with severe fatigue

1153
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,079
somebody with that was diagnosed with

1154
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,960
multiple sclerosis somebody that was

1155
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:59,319
diagnosed with ALS somebody that that

1156
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,559
just had a lot of different Tinkles

1157
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:03,640
numbness weakness of the limbs somebody

1158
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:06,599
that just had crippling anxiety but the

1159
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:10,079
nerves that get damage need time to heal

1160
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:12,319
and when they start to heal you come

1161
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,520
back but if you don't get that

1162
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:17,640
opportunity to come back because

1163
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:20,280
somebody said oh you're detoxing

1164
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,559
detoxing stop what you're doing it's

1165
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,680
killing you the

1166
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,400
detoxing without that good stuff you

1167
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,720
were doing God knows where you would be

1168
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,760
I've seen this with hundreds of people

1169
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,079
over the years God knows where you'd be

1170
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,760
if you weren't doing the good stuff

1171
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:39,400
you're doing but it could be blown Sky

1172
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,240
High because we can easily poison

1173
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,960
somebody with the detox talk I've seen

1174
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,359
it happened for years it stems from the

1175
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,040
hygienic movement it's been around and

1176
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,720
that hygienic movement never knew why

1177
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,599
anybody was sick I can tell you right

1178
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,040
now going back 20 years ago and I'm not

1179
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:55,280
going to name the

1180
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,040
clinics but I've been friends with many

1181
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,599
of of the people that have run and

1182
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,599
operated clinics throughout the years

1183
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,480
healing clinics and they didn't even

1184
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:06,880
know there was anything else but detox

1185
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,799
and they had no idea pathogens caused

1186
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,440
any illness whatsoever I used to get

1187
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:14,240
into debates all the time with like

1188
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,119
literally directors of clinics where

1189
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,520
they'd be like Anthony it's really just

1190
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:20,839
toxins we do this you go into the sauna

1191
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,880
here and then from the SAA you go into

1192
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:25,000
this and then you go do this we have all

1193
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,599
the weat grass here and I'd be like yeah

1194
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,480
but there suffering with different

1195
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,760
things inside their body like the

1196
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,839
pathogens and the hygienic movement with

1197
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,359
their detox BS talk has really caused a

1198
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,440
lot of problems with people out there

1199
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:40,760
and a lot of times people don't know

1200
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,200
what they really even feel like when

1201
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,400
they're on stimulants so people are on

1202
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,240
so many stimulants out there in general

1203
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,079
that when you remove all the stimulants

1204
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:53,119
then you feel what you really feel which

1205
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:54,880
is dragging and fatigued and tired and

1206
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,040
that's a whole another level and when

1207
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,880
you go to at that point you're going to

1208
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,200
think you're detoxing too

1209
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,359
much when you get off of stimul

1210
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,960
stimulants people they get off their

1211
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:05,920
they get off their adol they get off

1212
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,680
their coffee they get off all their

1213
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,280
stimulants right and they're they're off

1214
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,760
their chocolate they're off the all the

1215
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,160
different stimulants next to you know it

1216
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,440
they're dragging and the depression

1217
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,440
starts to creep up they get off all

1218
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,559
their super fatty foods and their

1219
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,400
stimulants and all of a sudden their

1220
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,880
their depression starts to creep up and

1221
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,799
they start feeling like something's

1222
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,960
wrong and they're thinking I'm detoxing

1223
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:31,839
no you're not detoxing dude you're not

1224
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,000
detoxing you're just you were that sick

1225
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:35,480
you just weren't super sick but you were

1226
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,640
sick enough where when you got rid of

1227
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,760
your stimulants it showcased it it

1228
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:43,040
exhibited it they feel they felt what

1229
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,280
their body really had going on and what

1230
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,359
was really going on inside their body

1231
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,000
their pathogens and their metals and

1232
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:51,839
their old Pharmaceuticals and things

1233
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,960
that were in there that have done damage

1234
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,720
to nerves in their body and the

1235
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,720
stimulants were Mass asking

1236
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:06,480
it healing takes time when we've been

1237
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:08,520
injured when something has injured our

1238
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,640

nerves when things injure these

1242
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:24,280
things it takes time to

1243
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:29,720

I'm just trying to give you guys the

1252
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:01,559
history you come into this four years

right now that are shouting out on IG

1255
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,680
talking so much crap that just got into

1256
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,559
hell two years ago all they knew was cut

1257
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,480

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,440
history and what is even going on and so

1265
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,040
when you even utter detox pathway you

1266
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,720

1267
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:39,599
it cold Whit spring says but doesn't

may there's times where it cycles and

1277
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:08,640

1278
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:12,319
of the cycle okay they're already going

1279
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:15,760
through the natural process of the bugs

1280
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:18,480
moving up in strength lowering down in

1281
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:21,119
strength moving up in strength lowering

1282
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,000
down in strength and when it comes down

1283
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:27,880
ex psoriasis you're going to see that

1284
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,720
waiver but you're not going to see them

1285
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:33,039
bedridden

1286
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:35,760
may you know what I mean or tick and

1287
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,359
spasms getting worse or anything else

1288
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,280
happening to that

1289
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:43,520
degree and if someone was pumped up with

1290
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:46,400
steroids for a very long

1291
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,480
time that's another thing that's very

1292
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,760
difficult on their body's immune system

1293
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,440
so it's coming off of all the steroids

1294
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:57,480
and the steroids that are inside the

1295
00:55:53,440 --> 00:56:00,720
liver that plays a role with the immune

1296
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,280
system because the the steroids hold

1297
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,440
back the immune system's initial

1298
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,319
reaction of exen psoriasis understand

1299
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,200
that that's important to know that means

1300
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,160
without the steroids their examen

1301
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,280
psoriasis would be that

1302
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,079
bad it would be out of control in in in

1303
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,599
in the the probably the greatest

1304
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,319
sense so it's a combination when you're

1305
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,920
talking about ex psoriasis in serious

1306
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:27,799
cases you're talking about the steroid

1307
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:29,839
process combined very difficult because

1308
00:56:27,799 --> 00:56:33,559
the steroid the steroid process was

1309
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:36,240
hiding and masking how bad the xamis was

1310
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:38,920
so when people go off the steroids the

1311
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:43,520
eczema is showcasing what it really

1312
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:45,480
should be and that can be blamed on

1313
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,799
detox like if you're doing something

1314
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,799
good for

1315
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,680
yourself but it's a really good question

1316
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,400
when it comes down to eimos psoriasis

1317
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,960
almost everybody with severe exmos

1318
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,920
psoriasis goes on some type of biologic

1319
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:03,319
some type of some type of steroid or so

1320
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:06,280
forth and bend down that road and that's

1321
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:08,559
controlling and masking the ecoman

1322
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:11,799
psoriasis so once you start coming off

1323
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:16,359
of that it just blows up because it was

1324
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:20,319
hiding it was suppressing it right so

1325
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:20,319
that's kind of another a whole another

1326
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:26,280
angle and a lot of people it's cyclical

1327
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,079
right with x this even when they're not

1328
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,599
on steroids or anything like that it's

1329
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:33,520
ebbing and flowing it's

1330
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:36,240
awful two months later they come out

1331
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,880
it's getting Level again who it's awful

1332
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,920
two months later they're coming out with

1333
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,920
it right so if you do any one thing

1334
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,520
you're not even going to know what's

1335
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,839
causing it at the time because you're

1336
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,599
not going to sure you're not going to

1337
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:48,280
even know where you are cyclical wise

1338
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:50,119
where's the cycle where where are you

1339
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,240
even are you a month away from it

1340
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:53,680
getting worse like it usually does or

1341
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,799
are you two months from it getting

1342
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,559
better it it's that's another thing all

1343
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:59,440
on its own but I I'll go into more

1344
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:01,280
detail about exus rasis and cover

1345
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,960
everything so so there's no

1346
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,839
confusion Le over there on IG says aw

1347
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,000
can you please explain why people with

1348
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:11,079
thyroid adrenal issues struggle to let

1349
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,079
go of

1350
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,480
fat first of all when we let go of fat

1351
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,319
we usually underc calorie

1352
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,960
ourselves and Fat's a stimulant too so I

1353
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,960
want to give you something little little

1354
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:25,119
talk about this okay if you're on a ton

1355
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,559
of avocado and you're on a ton of to and

1356
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,200
you're on a ton of olive oil and you're

1357
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,880
on a ton of olives and you're on a ton

1358
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,000
of meat and you're on you know beef and

1359
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,000
you're on a ton of chicken and you're

1360
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,520
getting fat from all kinds of chocolate

1361
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,720
and so forth and you're on lots of

1362
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:41,720
chocolate and everything um what happens

1363
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,559
is it stimulates and it causes your

1364
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,000
adrenals to release adrenaline all the

1365
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:47,680
time so you're releasing all this

1366
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,559
adrenaline so when you come off of fat

1367
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:54,079
your adrenals start to relax and then

1368
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:56,079
the ad the adrenaline addiction starts

1369
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:59,079
you start to feel the adrenaline

1370
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:01,319
addiction the reason why people are so

1371
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:03,680
so hog heavy into getting addicted to

1372
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:05,319
fats to such a degree where they're

1373
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,119
eating so much fat and everything they

1374
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:08,520
have to have fat in their food they have

1375
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,240
to have cheese they have to have all

1376
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,000
kinds of things that are like fatty no

1377
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,880
one wants eat a green salad that doesn't

1378
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,799
have cheese or cheese you know squares

1379
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:19,799
in it or you know something tuna in

1380
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:22,480
there egg cheese right because they're

1381
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:24,720
getting all that fat it's all this fat

1382
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,359
because what that does is it stimulates

1383
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,839
the adrenals and it makes them feel good

1384
00:59:26,359 --> 00:59:30,680
because they're high on adrenaline

1385
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:32,839
because the adrenaline has to it has to

1386
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,720
thin out the blood so the fats don't

1387
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:36,599
cause a problem with your brain so it

1388
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,119
has to thin out the

1389
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:40,359
blood so once you come off all that fat

1390
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,559
you're going to feel tired you're going

1391
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:44,160
to feel where you used to be kind where

1392
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,920
you sorry you're going to feel where you

1393
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,319
should feel because that's really what

1394
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,760
you feel like so the minute you come off

1395
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:55,119
a stimulant like high fat which is

1396
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,839
stimulant you end up feeling whoa this

1397
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,839
is what I felt like it's a different

1398
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,760
feeling same thing when you come off of

1399
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:03,680
coffee and then you're now coffee free

1400
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,200
you're like whoa this is what I used to

1401
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,599
feel like or or without coffee same

1402
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,440
thing you come off of like chocolate and

1403
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,119
so

1404
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,039
forth me over there on YouTube says what

1405
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:15,160
about debilitating reactions to Healing

1406
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:18,640
Foods

1407
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:21,960
aw mean like food sensitivities and so

1408
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,920
forth um what happens is that that's a

1409
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,359
whole another thing I'll do a show on

1410
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,160
that because I I want to do that

1411
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:31,440
Justice I read the question because I

1412
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,559
want to make sure I do a show on that

1413
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,599
that's really cool because that goes

1414
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,160
into food sensitivities and chemical

1415
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:39,720
sensitivities and we need to show on all

1416
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,720
of that

1417
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,839
combined so back to

1418
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:53,359
detoxing we have to be cautious to how

1419
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,079
we see detoxing and understand it I'm

1420
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,039
hoping this information that I gave you

1421
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:00,119
today gives you a little bit of a window

1422
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:03,599
into where it derived from why it's

1423
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:06,920
still here why It's haunting

1424
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:09,839
people one thing detox does is it gives

1425
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:12,240
the practitioner a way

1426
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:14,640
out it gives the health coach and

1427
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,359
practitioner a way out you're not doing

1428
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,960
better I have you on charcoal and

1429
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,319
bentonite clay and pearl powder I have

1430
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,880
you on sodium bicarbonate I have you on

1431
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:28,440
dious Earth particles I have you on

1432
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:31,160
alkaline ionizer water from kangaroo I

1433
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:34,480
got you on all this stuff and you're not

1434
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:36,920
feeling better um I'm a failure as a

1435
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,520
practitioner as a health coach as a

1436
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:41,440

1437
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,640

01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,039
it you're

1439
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:47,640
detoxing it's also the way out I've

1440
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:50,119
watched it be the way out for all the

1441
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,160
lime doctors for many years I watched it

1442
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:54,760
be the lot way out well no wait you're

01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:04,640
getting worse and worse it's not

1446
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,640
the doxy that I've been pumping in

1447
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:13,520

01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,960
weaponized so there's hundred and

1453
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,799
hundreds and hundreds of health coaches

1454
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,559
now thousands of them just spawning out

1455
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:31,119
everywhere just boom and there's all

1456
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:32,200
these people and they get people in

1457
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,200
there and they're just like I don't know

1458
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,079
what's wrong with these people I'm just

1459
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,839
kind of going by the keto diet or going

1460
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,680
by this and whatnot I'm trying to health

1461
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,480
coach them and then you see them getting

1462
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,240
sick and the person who's a client paid

1463
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:46,359
money so they paid whatever they paid

1464
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:49,000
$150 to $300 $500 and they paid this

1465
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:51,640
money to talk to the health coach and a

1466
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,640
health coach is like I think you're

1467
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:56,359
detoxing that's what it is so so we got

1468
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,599
to kind of like figure this out cuz

1469
01:02:56,359 --> 01:03:01,240
you're detox detoxing has been the way

1470
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:03,160
out for also the practitioner now and

1471
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:05,359
for the person who's a health coach it's

1472
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:07,039
another reason why it's exploding out

1473
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:09,720
there because people don't know why

1474
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,720
somebody's sick they just don't have a

1475
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,319
clue right all these people they're all

1476
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,400
sick out there they go to the doctors

1477
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:16,599
they're not happy with what their

1478
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,039
doctors are telling them um and then

1479
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:19,279
they go and they look for health coaches

1480
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:20,520
and they're going to do that and they go

1481
01:03:19,279 --> 01:03:21,799
take they go to courses and they're

1482
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,960
buying all these courses they're like

1483
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:26,799
I'm sick I need to get better and then

1484
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:29,160
they get like a moment with the guru of

1485
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:32,480
the course or Guru of the coach or

1486
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:35,160
whatever it is and the coach is like um

1487
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:38,240
you're detoxing too

1488
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:41,440
much that's another reason why it's

1489
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:44,920
exploding Katrina says I confirm I had

1490
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,960
severe psoriasis it comes in waves with

1491
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:50,920
waves worse and better but in general it

1492
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:53,520
became much better

1493
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:56,880
on it became much better on my head

1494
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,760
especially almost everything gone

1495
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,760
Amazing do an

1496
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:06,119
mm I think this is a big point right

1497
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:09,000
here that people don't know too is H

1498
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:12,480
there's another one you guys um ivy

1499
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,799
flower says on IG can we get the

1500
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,640
shakes when neurotoxins have the body

1501
01:04:15,799 --> 01:04:20,760
leave the body I shake and my teeth

1502
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:24,680
chatter sometimes on the

1503
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:26,720
hmds but then I feel so much better what

1504
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:29,279
happens is when people's nervous systems

1505
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,799
weaken and they're

1506
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:34,119
struggling

1507
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:37,920
okay anything that takes

1508
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:41,680
digestion anything that takes

1509
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:44,520
digestion could actually triggle trigger

1510
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:47,680
mild symptoms keep this in

1511
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:50,400
mind anything that triggers I'm going to

1512
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,400
get a better white

1513
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:56,799
board so everything that

1514
01:04:57,319 --> 01:05:02,119
triggers so can happen so say you got

1515
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:05,119
some nerves right so we're going to do a

1516
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:05,119
nice vegus nerve

1517
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:12,079
here now there's two Vegas nerves that

1518
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:14,240
come out of the

1519
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:17,200
cranial the brain

1520
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:19,359
stem okay we'll do some frenic nerves

1521
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,400
again let's do some frenic

1522
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:24,599
nerves I'm such an

1523
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,480
artist all right

1524
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:30,599
do some other nerves

1525
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:32,480
here okay all right when we have a lot

1526
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:34,160
of neurotoxins Right medical mem

1527
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,880
information viruses that create

1528
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,039
neurotoxins and neurotoxins are swimming

1529
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:40,720
around in our body they're already

1530
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:44,079
putting a damper on the nervous system

1531
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:46,160
so the neurotoxins are already beating

1532
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,920
down the nervous system okay so your

1533
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,880
neur neurotoxins right this is

1534
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,520
neurotoxins coming down on the nerves

1535
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:56,319
neurotoxins coming down on the nerves

1536
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:58,319
right these neurotoxins already hamper

1537
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:01,960
hamper the nerves the vag nerves the

1538
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:04,279
frenic nerves already hamper them so any

1539
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:07,039
time you

1540
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:09,359
eat you're going to feel it not every

1541
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:12,079
time but most of the time depending on

1542
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:14,480
what time of day you're going to have

1543
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,200
low spots with your nervous system at

1544
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,480
different times of the day this is why

1545
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:22,359
adrenal snacks and medical medium does

1546
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,760
not do intermittent fasting this is why

1547
01:06:22,359 --> 01:06:27,480
medical medium information does not

1548
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:30,440
withhold food from people this is why

1549
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,440
it's not restrictive because you need to

1550
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,240
get enough calories in and you need to

1551
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,920
get enough snacks and stuff throughout

1552
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,039
the day because you want to keep the the

1553
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,079
the playing field level you want to keep

1554
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:43,720
the homeostasis you guys and that

1555
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:46,599
homeostasis protects you so you have

1556
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:49,400
less ups and downs with a nervous system

1557
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:49,400
that's already

1558
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:56,240
hampered but you

1559
01:06:52,119 --> 01:07:00,000
eat anything depends on what time of day

1560
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,000
it can play a role on the nervous

1561
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,920
system because the nervous systems

1562
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,240
already weak and

1563
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,680
hampered takes time to

1564
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:12,359
heal but if someone said well you're

1565
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:14,640
detoxing better stop the hmd better stop

1566
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:16,960
the heavy metal detox you're

1567
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,319
detoxing and you get scared you stop the

1568
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,720
hmd you stop your celery juice you stop

1569
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:22,720
whatever medical mem tools there's

1570
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,839
dozens and dozens dozens of them and you

1571
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,400
stop them and now you're like what what

1572
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:27,400
do I do

1573
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:39,039
now anyway guys this concludes the first

1574
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,359
round of detox talk we are going to do

1575
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,599
it again sometime but I think I'm going

1576
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:42,480
to talk a little bit more if you got

1577
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:46,240
another

1578
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,240
minute let's talk about new

1579
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:53,119
exposures so your

1580
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:55,359
gut your gut can be filled with a lot of

1581
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,920
different stuff it can be filled with

1582
01:07:55,359 --> 01:08:00,559
old rancid fat that's sitting inside the

1583
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:03,599
gut Linings it can be cut with

1584
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,000
undigested protein sitting in the gut

1585
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:09,480
Linings and it's all building up in

1586
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,079
there right our guts can get toxic it

1587
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,599
can get filled with chemicals and all

1588
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:14,200
kinds of metals and everything else in

1589
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:18,159
there and all this kind of

1590
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:21,920
stuff okay and we can still not be

1591
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:24,040
sick we can have a gut full of garbage

1592
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,480
there are guys walking out there and

1593
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:29,040
they got a gut out to here and it's hard

1594
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:31,679
as a rock and you can you can literally

1595
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:34,120
punch it like boom boom boom and it's

1596
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,239
not going to actually even budge and you

1597
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:38,480
can punch it and that gut's going to

1598
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:41,520
just sit there like a big like rubber

1599
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,400
ball inside the guy's gut right and the

1600
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,440
guy's like fine he's like I go to work

1601
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,920
every day there's nothing wrong with me

1602
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,799
yeah the doctor says I need to lower my

1603
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,920
cholesterol the doctor says he's worried

1604
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:53,520
about my A1C he doesn't want me to get

1605
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,880
type two diabetes but overall I'm doing

1606
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,120
pretty pretty good I feel good and the

1607
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:01,199
guy's gut is filled with [ __ ] tons of

1608
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:03,799
[ __ ] and garbage

1609
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:05,359
right somebody else doesn't has very

1610
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:08,000
little of that in here they're eating

1611
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:11,400
clean they're doing good a lot but it

1612
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,440
also depends on exposures but if that

1613
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,159
guy that has that hard gut that's filled

1614
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,319
with all that garbage in there gets a

1615
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:19,120
real

1616
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:22,080
exposure picks up a bug something

1617
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:25,159
happens could go down and it all comes

1618
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:27,440
crumbling down and people who are also

1619
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:29,799
taking care of themselves can also get

1620
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:31,600
new exposures too that keep them down

1621
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:34,239
why they're trying to heal we got to

1622
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,679
override we got to ride those

1623
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:38,520
out where do you work did they spray

1624
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:40,080
something you're exposed to where do you

1625
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,839
live did they spray something you're

1626
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:45,080
exposed to it's just it's

1627
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:49,279
endless there's lots of exposures

1628
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:52,520
everywhere new relationships public

1629
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:54,840
bathrooms everything restaurants I've

1630
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:57,960
been saying this for years it's probably

1631
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:00,360
the biggest bug spreading Place possible

1632
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,880
is restaurants and hospitals right

1633
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:05,199
hospitals it's it's already you know we

1634
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,600
already know that you some but you know

1635
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,440
you need to go to a hospital you go to a

1636
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,360
hospital right but there's so much

1637
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:12,800
exposure there too right but there's so

1638
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:15,760
much exposure in

1639
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,400
restaurants all the

1640
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,199
same those that's a big place that's the

1641
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,239
big big exposures they don't wash all

1642
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:24,199
the stuff off all the dishes right all

1643
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:25,840
the glasses and the forks I talked about

1644
01:10:24,199 --> 01:10:28,000
this in the brains saer book and the

1645
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,040
chefs cut themselves continually and

1646
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
then put rubber gloves on and they put

1647
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,600
gloves on nit trial gloves on but they

1648
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,040
got blood on everything even on the

1649
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,480
outside of the glove because they're cut

1650
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,080
and they're just getting it everywhere

1651
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,800
and they put the glove on and now

1652
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,719
they're making your food it's one of the

1653
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:44,760
biggest exposure places there

1654
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:47,000
is people making food they need to be

1655
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,480
really careful even when they're home

1656
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,760
making food for people that's how much

1657
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:54,679
exposure happens out

1658
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,199
there anyway you guys um I'm going to

1659
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:59,960
let you go this was fun but we're going

1660
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:02,280
to cover detox again because it really

1661
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,920
needs like a 4H

1662
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:07,080
hour

1663
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,840
talk and these are just one you know

1664
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:11,800
this is just one section of it some

1665
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:15,120
things to

1666
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:16,640
consider okay and uh and some things to

1667
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:20,280
avoid by the

1668
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:22,760
way you know some things you can't avoid

1669
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,360
as well so some things we can avoid

1670
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,560
which is public to toilets when we're

1671
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:29,600
out we can't avoid all kinds of stuff it

1672
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,679
just happens we get exposure that's okay

1673
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,400
we can do things to take care of it and

1674
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:37,280
move forward and

1675
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:42,040
heal but either way look out for the

1676
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:45,880
detox fear and Chaos it's pared by

1677
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:48,360
influencer by influencer

1678
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:51,480
influencer and it stems from places like

1679
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:57,320
