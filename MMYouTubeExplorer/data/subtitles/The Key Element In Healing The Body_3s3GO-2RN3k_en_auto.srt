talk about neurological symptoms too

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,160
because the B12 goes hand inand with

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,000
neurological symptoms if you're battling

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,680
something neurologically and you need

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,239
help neurologically B12 is one of the

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,960
key pieces that has to be involved and

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,039
it has to be the right kind of B12 it

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,000
can't be the wrong kind of B12 because

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,399
the wrong kind of B12 is not going to

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,520

tried B12 and it didn't work and then

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,359
you get cheated out of healing or

27
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,559
cheated out of getting a chance to move

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,519
Monica says you are so amazing Anthony

284
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,360
you care so much I was in tears

285
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,200
listening to your podcast wow that's

286
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,800

287
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,120
hear did you do the

288
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,639
meditations uh Joshua Eldridge says I

289
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,680
love the explanation of microorganisms

290
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,519
it reminded me of a Marvel movie like

291
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,760
Ant-Man that's incredible um you know

292
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,399
people don't realize it that it's

293
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,200
microorganisms in your elium in your gut

294
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,399
in your elium and in that elium down

295
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,360
here okay it's really important that

296
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,240
these microorganisms get in there and we

297
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,959
only get them in once in a while like if

298
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,720
you had an apple off of a tree if you

299
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,320
had um you know a cucumber out of

300
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,920
somebody's Garden if you grew some

301
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,040
parsley out of a pot or you know a pot

302
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,440
you have like outside your little

303
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,160
Terrace there or maybe you're just you

304
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,959
know you're an apartment building and

305
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,040
all you have is your kitchen with a

306
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,519
little window and then you grow some

307
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,160
Sprouts like in a sprout tray you guys

308
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,480
and what happens is is these

309
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,000
microorganisms they actually appear they

310
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,800
do grow on all of this living produce

311
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,399
that we that we can grow like a little

312
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,440
garden with some kale growing out of it

313
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,279
maybe you have that option once in your

314
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,399
life it helps just to have it once and

315
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,600
then these little microorganisms are on

316
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,880
these plants and I talk about this at

317
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,240
the medical Me podcast at Apple podcast

318
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,079
the B12 episode you got to check it out

319
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,040
cuz I really go into it in depth in

320
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,959
there really and these microorganisms

321
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,040
when you eat them they bypass the

322
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:38,040
stomach they find their way to the ilum

323
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:41,760
and then they start producing the

324
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,880
co-enzyme but it's not quite 100% in its

325
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,079
you know valuable form yet until it hits

326
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,519
the liver and I talk all about it so

327
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,279
important Lorraine L I'm looking forward

to go into this a little bit just

364
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,519
because our B12 is high doesn't mean we

365
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,880
are using it doesn't mean we're actually

366
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,720
utilizing it assimilating absorbing it

367
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,920
it could be in our bloodstream from the

368
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,000
animal products that we're eating but

369
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,320
yet it's not going into our nervous

370
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,399
system and as the years go by we start

371
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,800
getting some different symptoms you know

372
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,720
for all kinds of problems that I talk

373
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,079
about in the neurological episode so

374
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,440
what I recommend okay if you guys have a

375
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,320
chance what I recommend is listen to the

376
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,120
B12 episode and listen to the

377
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,440
neurological symptoms episode okay link

378
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,600
is in the description B12 episode and

379
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,440
neurological episode subscribe to the

380
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,160
medical meme podcast too and the reason

381
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,040
why it's important to listen to both of

382
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,120
those is because B12 is critical for

383
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,920
neurological symptoms and I talk about

384
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,120
why and everything Alexandra Sophia said

one you know I was shocked at how much

412
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,639
you know the thing is I'm trying to read

413
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,920
these comments they keep on flying up so

414
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,720
fast so it's hard you guys you know it's

415
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,720
it's the thing with the moon meditation

416
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:16,279
is when our souls get injured by so much

417
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,920
and I'm talking about broken trust

418
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:22,680
betrayal broken relationships hardships

419
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,680
losses all these different issues I got

420
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,160
to tell you guys it's really painful but

421
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,040
we carry these wounds with us and then

422
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,079
we're afraid to trust and then then

423
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,600
we're like well I can't trust I can't

424
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,120
trust that person and I can't trust this

425
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,000
person I don't know what to do I can't

426
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,160
trust this decision I'm supposed to do

427
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,839
like where do I where do I go and you

428
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,759
know what happens is that we get to a

429
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:46,199
place in our life where we just we just

430
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,440
you know we just don't trust anymore and

431
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,079
the wounds stick with us and I want you

432
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,560

you I want you guys to have as much

544
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,400
information as you possibly can I want

545
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,760
you to heal these are not throw away

546
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,360
that what when you hear the word podcast

547
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,279
would what I always thought when I heard

548
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,679
the word podcast in the past I always

549
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,880
thought well because the old radio show

550
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,720
I did was never a podcast you know you

551
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,440
guys it was an old radio show and and

552
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,120
then you know yeah you could hear it as

553
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,480
a podcast but it wasn't a podcast this

554
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,159
is the official medical meaning podcast

555
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,799
right at Apple podcast and what I always

556
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,400
heard about podcast was I always thought

557
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,440
well throwaways you know it's just like

558
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,559
get as many guests as you can have on

559
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,880
talk a little bit about this and that

560
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,640
ask a few quick questions next next next

561
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,720
there's just like kind of like cotton

562
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,200
candy and you get a tidbit here get a

563
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,000
tidbit there but then there's all this

564
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,480
confusion well that's what I've always

565
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,679
thought about with podcast you know but

566
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,600
there's some good ones out there but

567
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,360
still but with this I said you know what

568
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,520
don't want to do that I don't want to do

569
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,000
that I want information packed line for

570
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,480
line I want people healing more people

571
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840

572
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,799
cleanse of heal book I want people

573
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,559
getting their lives back I want to make

00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,960
sure this has messages in it this has

575
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,880
information in it that this is this is a

576
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:28,240

so important um yeah and so the bottom

580
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:40,200
line is a B12 episode really important

581
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,400
there think about central nervous system

582
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,559
think about Vegas nerve think about an

583
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,480
frenic nerves think about back like

584
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,080
sciatic nerve okay tibial nerve all the

585
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,480
different nerves it's so

586
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,919
important um so I'm going to do Tracy

587
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,559
says do a podcast on eyes yeah okay I

588
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,240
will definitely do one on eyes

589
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:01,520
eventually I promise I'll try to get to

590
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,080
that Alexandra says all podcasts are

591
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,480
mindblowing Rel listen to fruit fear wow

592
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,080
fruit fear when you hear fruit fear a

593
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,360
second time just blows it blows your

594
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,559
mind it blew my mind when I hear it

595
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,880
again because it's like wait did I say

596
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,360
that did I actually say that in there

597
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,279
and then you hear it you're like what

598
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,960
you know it's that kind of thing um but

599
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:27,480
yeah the information is really packed

600
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,440
the whole bit uh Sergeant s says uh s

601
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,039
says hi Anthony please do a grounding

602
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,360
meditation I love all your podcasts a

603
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,880
grounding one oh my god do you mean like

604
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,080
the one in medical medium book one that

605
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,279
one the grounding one like you're a tree

606
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,080
and your and your feet go down into the

607
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,559
root like you're you grow roots off your

608
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,640
feet into the Earth well I have a

609
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:52,559
grounding one I will do that one make

610
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,520
sure it's a guided meditation eventually

611
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,559
for you guys I'll make that happen for

612
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,960
you guys too because that would be a

613
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,080
really powerful one for you guys

614
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,240
um definitely it's a medical me book one

615
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,640
um and anyway so kendice says how do you

616
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,480
know how much B12 to take I really

617
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,480
appreciate everything you're doing sir

618
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,039
you're a true savior Kenneth I'm really

619
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,200
glad you're here thank you for being

620
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,360
here so awesome to see you and um how do

621
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,400
you know how much B12 to take well it

622
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,960
works like this it's really tricky where

623
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,559
I put dosages all in cleanse the heel so

624
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,919
I do put dosages for all kinds of

625
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,520
different conditions in cleanse the heel

626
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:29,919
so people have an idea and they could

627
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,880
always do less they could talk to their

628
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,120
doctor they could do more whatever they

629
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,000
want to do but is but I always look at

630
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,880
it this way if you don't have any going

631
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,200
in you that's not going to help the

632
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,960
situation especially if you have

633
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,159
neurological symptoms or anything like

634
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,360
that so it's important to get enough in

635
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:48,600
you at the same time we burn through it

636
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,440
we burn through B12 we utilize it so

637
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,200
quickly are you under stress is anything

638
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,159
happening in your life did you have a

639
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,520
hardship did you were you under a lot of

640
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,080
pressure on something emotional struggle

641
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,600
did something happen

642
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,120
any of that are you working hard are are

643
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,520
you getting enough sleep and are are you

644
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,000
dealing with symptoms and conditions so

645
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,600
and if you're dealing with symptoms and

646
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,960
conditions then it's always good to take

647
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,799
more of it what do I do I mean if I had

648
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,240
a B12 in front of me right now I'd show

649
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,960
you right here but what I do is I take

650
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,480
myself personally is I'll take like two

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,720
way which is I respect massage therapy

724
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,120
more than probably anything out there

725
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,840
because it's it's ancient number one

726
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,840
ancient massage goes back as far as

727
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,080
human beings existed goes all the way

728
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,159
back long before herbal medicine long

729
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,200
before anything long before anything uh

730
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,519
I'm a massage therapist I lost my faith

731
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,440

734
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,120

735
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,720
form of healing therapy the oldest

736
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,240

existed on planet Earth okay going all

738
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,120
the way back which is a whole another

739
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,559
