fight now

132
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,560
those who can't handle the sense are the

133
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,800
canaries

134
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:33,080
they become chemical sensitive

135
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,080
they've reached their saturation point

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,900
think about it for a minute

137
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,060
there's a whole bunch of people out

138
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,639
there they're like the canaries they've

139
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,000
reached their Tipping Point of being

140
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,699
able to handle those contaminated

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,940
dangerous chemical sense produced by

142
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,680
chemical factories around the world

143
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,180
and they reach their saturation point

144
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,180
and then there are the people who love

145
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,160
their sense still they haven't reached

146
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,100
their saturation point and they're

147
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,160
supporting the chemical industry

148
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,840
they say they're for the environment

149
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,820
meanwhile they're partaking in one of

150
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,979
the worst things that's being released

151
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,840
into the environment

152
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,960
the industry is causing families to

153
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,900
fight over this and divide

154
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,440
how can sense be more important than our

155
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,139
health and our families

156
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,340
why is perfume so important why is

157
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,020
cologne so important why is air

158
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,020
freshener so important why is

159
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,539
all the different toxic fragrance stuff

160
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,100
that were up against all the time why is

161
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:42,180
it more important than our family

162
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:45,979
members who are really oversaturated by

163
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,979
this chemical and they're the canaries

164
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,300
people go into battle over it it's

165
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,600
really really difficult for so many

166
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,600

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,080
not many people understand not many

192
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:12,180
people do understand

193
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,240
they don't

194
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,819
shen77 says what's a canary

195
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,259
it's an old term for someone basically

196
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,400
what happens is that down in the coal

197
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,919
mines

198
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,020
if they lost oxygen and gases from the

199
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,060
earth were taking over they would have a

200
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,099
canary sitting in a cage

201
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,860
and everybody would be working chipping

202
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:33,899
away that coal mining whatever minerals

203
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,000
or ore and then all of a sudden you see

204
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,979
the canary die in the cage that means

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
you've got very little time but you've

206
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,599
got to get out of that cave out of that

207
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,060
mine shaft

208
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,519
Canary dies first

209
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,440

free and I have no sinus problems

211
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,240
anymore it was triggering all your

212
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,920
problems it was breaking down the immune

213
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,779
system and that's what happens people

214
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,220
don't realize it breaks down the immune

215
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,980
system all this stuff

216
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,800
Aquarius on IG I was diagnosed with

217
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,959
asthma in my 20s but it was really the

218
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,480
perfume I was spraying on myself daily

219
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,480
it was making me choke breathing it in

220
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,080
may I just add this

221
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,580

222
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,140
really is out there in the world and

223
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,040

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,320
stuff

235
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,980

over them and they support the chemical

244
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:17,459
industry that creates these deadly

245
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,560
chemicals and puts them into our lives

246
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,120

265
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,579
chemical industry which is destroying

common fragrance exposures

309
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,040
scented candles

310
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,120

311
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,920
your home

312
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,839
I'm not going to name any brands or

313
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,360
anything

314
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,920
but oh my God people are using these

315
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,959
scented candles

316
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,760
it gets into their walls it gets into

317
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,339
the furniture it gets into their bedding

318
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,519
it gets into all their blankets he gets

319
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:22,139
into every single orifice of their home

320
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,300
and it saturates it for a lifetime they

321
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:27,000
can live a life be a hundred years old

322
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,060
die and then the home sells to someone

323
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,560
else and that person buys that home or

324
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,760
enters that apartment and rents that

325
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,459
apartment

326
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,260
and that smell will still be there a

327
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:39,480
hundred years later if that home is

328
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,660
still standing and then that person will

329
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,279
still smell uh all those years of those

330
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,500
scented candles and air fresheners and

331
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,959
everything else it could last hundreds

332
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,959
of years if a home is around hundreds of

333
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,639
years with these modern everyday

334
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,519
chemicals that were exposed of to right

335
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:59,579
now then it will last every Century

336
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,519
someone will smell what the old

337
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:05,700
person who lived in it 100 200 years ago

338
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,519
was using it would be all those scents

339
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,620
and all those fragrances it won't be any

340
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,660
natural smells like the natural wood

341
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,240
smell in the house or the natural

342
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,760
whatever house you know would house that

343
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,019
natural smell on the Furnitures and

344
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
everything else it would just be

345
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,160
chemicals chemicals chemicals so we live

346
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,380
in a world now and the hospitals are

347
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,000
filled with chemicals too and that's a

348
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,220
scary thing for a lot of people that are

349
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,620
sick they're sick and they end up going

350
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,540
to the hospital because they they

351
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,820
something happened and they fell or some

352
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,380
got hurt they went to the hospital to

353
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,940
get an x-ray and they're breathing in

354
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,399
every single chemical in the book so

355
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,440
it's like chemical fragrances have

356
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,440
gotten into every single orifice

357
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,040
common fragrance exposures aerosol can

358
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,320
air fresheners which are big too

359
00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:00,199
including squeezy bottles spray bottle

360
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,199
air fresheners and Mists it's like

361
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:11,220
oh this was only made in a chemical

362
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,839
Factory somewhere synthesized made from

363
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,180
a whole bunch of toxic chemicals where

364
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,399
if you were dipped in it you would maybe

365
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:22,019
not make it

366
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:24,240
if it was filled into a massive vat and

367
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,440
you were dipped in and had to bathe in

368
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,899
it

369
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,399
God only knows what would happen but

370
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,899
it's okay to spray it around everywhere

371
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,339
and spray it in the air and spray it on

372
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,440
your furniture and spray all that stuff

373
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,760
right

374
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,620
so we talked about the plug-in air

375
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,839
fresheners plug-in air fresheners are

376
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,820
tricky one that stuff puffing out it

377
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,120

a billion people bought scented candles

397
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,000

398
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,480

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,720
guts it's pouring through their cells

520
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,580
it's coming out of their lymphatic

521
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,740

525
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,460

and then they float around and saturated

565
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,940
to the walls if everybody's doing

566
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,700
essential oils non-stop they saturate

567
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,860
the walls and saturate the furniture and

568
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,780
eventually create a mold problem I

569
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,799
talked about this on Rumble this episode

570
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,799
on Rumble with that

571
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,159
I'm not saying you can't use essential

572
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,600
oils I'm just saying that there's a lot

573
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,340
to understand about all this stuff

574
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,720
another thing too is you'll find that

575
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,419
they're taking essential oils and

576
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,700
they're putting it in toxic project

577
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:17,820
products so it might be like oh our

578
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,159
detergent has essential oil of orange in

579
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,500
it our detergent has essential oil of

580
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,580

581
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,860
perfume perfume perfume and fragrance in

582
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,600
there that's not the essential oil so

583
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,220
then you're tripped so there's all these

584
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,659
products now that have essential oils in

585
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,880

00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,559

593
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,460
if you don't want your house to always

594
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,840
smell like those essential oils forever

595
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,840
don't ease them

596
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,100
because someone was saying that

597
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,760
this isn't an essential oil attack I'm

598
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,100
talking about the chemical industry I'm

599
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,900
talking about fragrances and perfumes

600
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,120
perfumes colognes and all the different

601
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,280
fragrances and right the detergents the

602
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,159
fabric softeners and even more than that

603
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,559
right that the household cleaners with

604
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,659
all the fragrance in it oh my God walk

605
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,400
down the grocery store and I talked

606
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:26,460
about the other day walk by the the

607
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,340
toiletries the toiletries

608
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,980
every time I have to walk down through

609
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:35,400
that aisle for some reason

610
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,559
with family or some whatever or friend

611
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,260
and I gotta walk down that aisle of

612
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:45,500
toiletries I'm just like toiletry hell

613
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,500
it's it's it's so highly toxic

614
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,820
you know like I'm thinking this right

615
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,740
right that I don't like the smell or

616
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,720
something and everybody loves the smell

617
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,720
but I don't think you guys like it right

618
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:08,340
IG comment right here Sarah Valentine

619
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,080
yes some high

620
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,000
so let's see some high-end Japanese

621
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,880
restaurants do it

622
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,440
and send an email reminder fragrance

623
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,620
interferes the dining experience whoa

624
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,120
it kills the smell of food you won't

625
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,220
smell the food that was really good

626
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,179
point you won't smell the food in a

627
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,340
restaurant

628
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,240
you will smell cologne in perfume in a

629
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,880
restaurant

630
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,520
and air fresheners too and chemical

631
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,539
cleaners that the restaurant uses on the

632
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,179
tables

633
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,039
not going to smell the food really it

634
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,960
just gets into the hypoglossal nerve it

635
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,659
gets into the nerves and the cranial

636
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,760
nerves it gets into all of them

637
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,440
but clear nerve it just gets into all

638
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,360
the different cranial nerves and it just

639
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,520
starts to beat it down those fragrances

640
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,620
the chemicals

641
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,539
beats it down all right

642
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,520
car air fresheners that's a new

643
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:02,820

incense is pure

659
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,260

00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:49,380
just burning incense

661
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:52,740
it's a spiritual incense

662
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:55,320
it has to be pure it's just herbs

663
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:58,260
glued to a stick

664
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,159

that that stuff isn't laced with

669
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,200

670
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,440

whole thing smells like one big bomb and

757
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,899
that's blowing out of the dryer dryers

758
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,360

00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:03,659

760
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:07,440

764
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,340
and it's blowing out your dryer and

765
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,340

767
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,059

chemical factories

770
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,500
the fragrance sector of the chemical

771
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,299
industry is far from innocent far from

772
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,360
innocent man

773
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:43,860
rap bastards the industry has a set of

774
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,559
goals

775
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,200
one goal is to keep their chemicals in

776
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,240
mass production

777
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,520
to do this they want to keep people

778
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,440
purchasing their chemicals so let's keep

779
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,240
on purchasing those scented candles and

780
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,039
all those air fresheners let's keep on

781
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,779
purchasing all that perfume cologne and

782
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,960
every other thing in body lotion that

783
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:06,120
scented sure let's feed the industry all

784
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,640
the money they ever wanted they can

785
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,220
produce more chemicals

786
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,500
and kill the environment so every bird

787
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,140
never knows what the natural air ever

788
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,919
smells like again no one cares about

789
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,779
what a bird smells nobody cares about a

790
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,820
hawk and the fact that the hawk has to

791
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:27,600
breathe in every single dryer vent

792
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:29,580
spewing out of every single house

793
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,640
when nobody cares

794
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,500
of course not why should we right to do

795
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,419
this they want to keep people purchasing

796
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,220
their chemicals and to do that they want

797
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:40,559
to condition and train people they want

798
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:42,419
to brainwash them to believe they need

799
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,820
these synthetic fragrances and scents

800
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,820
you need that synthetic fragrance

801
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,760
and what about the

802
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,720
what about our pets inside the house

803
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,720
breathing in all of that

804
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,679
last but not you know or their pets that

805
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,140
are outside breathing all of that in

806
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,000
outside what about children breathing

807
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,379
all that in

808
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,179
I mean we don't want our children

809
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:14,159
breathing in all that chemical from

810
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,599
chemical industries does that make any

811
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,980
sense

812
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,540
it's about learning the truth and

813
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,780
getting empowered

814
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,760
because you just don't want the stuff to

815
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,960
keep on getting stronger out there and

816
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,960
growing and taking over the planet

817
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:33,260
if you know about it

818
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,260
it at least helps you because

819
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,419
it's going to affect us either way

820
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,399
just because look it doesn't make it go

821
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:42,599
away if you don't know about it if

822
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,919
you're somebody that doesn't want to

823
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,480
know about it and you want to just be

824
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,339
ignorant to it and you don't want to you

825
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,639
want to put a blind eye to it

826
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:52,440
it doesn't go away it's there it's

827
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,000
tormenting a lot of people and a lot of

828
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,000
animals and a lot of Wildlife

829
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,520
they want to condition and train people

830
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,040
to believe they need these synthetic

831
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,339
fragrances and scents last but not least

832
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,680
they want to take away any future chance

833
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:13,320
for someone to know what nature really

834
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:17,040
smells like did you hear that

835
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,980
did you guys hear that get ready last

836
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,140
but not least the chemical industry

837
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,540
wants to take away any future chance for

838
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,640
someone to know what nature really

839
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,640
smells like your children's children

840
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,740
will not know what nature smells like

841
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,940
on planet Earth down the road these

842
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,940
chemicals have taken over

843
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,000
I can promise you your children's

844
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,619
children won't know what this planet

845
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,599
smells like

846
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:44,520
Spirit of compassion has told me that

847
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,859
it's not my guess

848
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,359
Spirit of compassion has told me our

849
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:50,280
children's children are never going to

850
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,900
know what nature smells like again

851
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,060
on this planet

852
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,520
Kendall McCargo says knowing the truth

853
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,079
helps make an informed decision that can

854
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,700
change your life and help prevent

855
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,800
further damage

856
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:05,460
way better said than me

857
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,359
it's better said than what I would say

858
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,060
whether smelling Ocean Air at the beach

859
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,140
smelling the Earth and fresh air of the

860
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,740
forest

861
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,760
or smelling flowers and freshly moaned

862
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,760
grass

863
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,200
As the Wind rustles Through trees in

864
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,900
your backyard

865
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,240
they want to destroy and disrupt the

866
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,680
authentic experience and they will

867
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,480
destroy and disrupt it for your

868
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,400
children's children

869
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,740
Jenny Jenn said my neighbor's cat smells

870
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,740
like drier sheets from lying on her bed

871
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,800
my friend invited me on a

872
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,339
little boating

873
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,339
trip

874
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,820
was like a really small boat

875
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:55,500
we went out

876
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,440
he said let's smell some fresh air

877
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,180
all I could smell the entire time on

878
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,579
this little boat

879
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:06,900
was all the scented [ __ ]

880
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:10,160
that was trapped on my friend's body

881
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,160
and in his clothes

882
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,859
including the chemicals he used to clean

883
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,760
his little boat

884
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:21,720
including

885
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,420
the bug repellent he sprayed

886
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,460
just a can of bug repellent in the

887
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,339
corner of the boat made it so you

888
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:34,560
couldn't smell a darn thing

889
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:37,680
it was the worst wasted outing I've had

890
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,920
I could not smell the water I could not

891
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,200
smell the air I could not see the clouds

892
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,820
and have a vision of smelling like

893
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,540
something good while you're looking at

894
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:52,440
the clouds roll by all you smelt was

895
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:54,540
just chemical chemical chemical

896
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,780
and all I did was complain the whole

897
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,780
time

898
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,560
gen Z said Can enough people not wake up

899
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:03,960
and make a change for the future or it's

900
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,460
hopeless it's a tricky one because when

901
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,619
you see people who are supposed to be

902
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,820
health-minded all over social media apps

903
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,280
everywhere

904
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,720
who are influencers and they're supposed

905
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,760
to be health-minded and they say they're

906
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,260
health-minded and they're doing all

907
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,260
these healthy things with their foods

908
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,619
and no processed foods and they're

909
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:25,320
choosing vegan leather you know shoes

910
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:26,099
slippers and heels and sneakers or

911
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,740
whatever

912
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,599
and they're not doing it and they're

913
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,760
totally addicted to their sense and

914
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,740
their their perfumes colognes and all

915
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,380
the conventional sprays and air freshers

916
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,980
I don't think there's hope I try to

917
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,980
spread the word

918
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,599
you know so that people stop buying the

919
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,460
products and educate other people out

920
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,900
there they stop buying all the scented

921
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,619
fragrances and all the different

922
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,619
products and everything

923
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,500

you know I'm trying to actually stop it

938
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,099
the key is enough people have to

939
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,380
complain out there in the world and stop

940
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:42,180
buying the products that are scented so

941
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,040
that the chemical industry sees a

942
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,560
reduction

943
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:50,099
of their investment into it like they

944
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:54,000
see a reduction of sales so they start

945
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:56,460
to slowly push them out you know of the

946
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,260
market

947
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,940
we're coming to a time when we're not

948
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,820
going to know what any of these natural

949
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,920
surroundings smell like we're only going

950
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,540
to be surrounded by contaminating

951
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,720
fragrances

952
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:14,520
you walk into Whole Foods now

953
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,079
all you smell is everybody's stuff you

954
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,940
think everybody's shopping in Whole

955
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,260
Foods

956
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:26,400
is health-minded or natural or plant

957
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:28,880
or sorry Planet saving mind

958
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,560
of planet-saving mind

959
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,040
and health

960
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,420
mindset right you walk in there the

961
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,480
stink

962
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,180
of everybody's sense coming off of them

963
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,500
and blowing off them air fresheners on

964
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,780
their clothes

965
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,240
send the candles all over whatever

966
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:52,619
everything you name it it's just one big

967
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,020
cologne bath you go into any place now

968
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:57,740
fragrances are unlike other toxic

969
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,740
chemicals

970
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,240
many toxic chemicals have a shelf life

971
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,180
and dissipate over time

972
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,180
the rain can dilute certain outdoor

973
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:11,640
toxic chemicals for example thin them

974
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:14,220
out and make them less harmful the rain

975
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:17,400
cannot thin out a toxic chemical

976
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:21,660
that's saturated with fragrance

977
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:24,780
the rain cannot even thin out

978
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:30,000
God's nature

979
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,000
the Earthly mother's nature rain

980
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,520
a substance

981
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,060
created from our Earthly mother cannot

982
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,060
fit out

983
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:43,680
saturated fragrances

984
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:47,040
fragrances are being created to last for

985
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,579
an eternity

986
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,680
extremely long time and not dissipate

987
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:54,060
in many cases fragrance can be

988
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,760
unstoppable

989
00:41:54,060 --> 00:42:00,660
Unstoppable

990
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,880
I'm dramatic today we're on the verge of

991
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,040
never being able to smell what The Ocean

992
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,839
Air is like when we're standing on the

993
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,700
beach because we're just going to be

994
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,720
smelling fragrances blowing off of

995
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,359
people

996
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:15,300
I'm dramatic for a reason because that

997
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:17,400
right there all of this is so sad it

998
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,920
breaks my heart so I'm really passionate

999
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,260
about you know talking about it because

1000
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,660
it's it's just terrible

1001
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,880
Jamie the best thing that ever happened

1002
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:30,119
to me is working from home all the

1003
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,920
smells in the office killed me

1004
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,839
it's terrible

1005
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,980
I'm happy you're working at home it

1006
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,579
makes me happy

1007
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,579
for you

1008
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,119
fragrances are unidentified chemicals

1009
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,820
even more so than other domestic

1010
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,380
chemical industry Invader products

1011
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,660
which you'll read about in the next few

1012
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,820
pages one loophole in the chemical

1013
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,800
industry is this fragrances don't have

1014
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,760
to list the multiple chemicals within

1015
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,220
them

1016
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,220
all they have to list is fragrance

1017
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:06,680
100 deadly chemicals in there just

1018
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,680
listed fragrance

1019
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,940
when you see the word fragrance in a

1020
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,720
list of ingredients you're looking at

1021
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,720
corruption

1022
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,420
because in that word are a host of

1023
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:26,040
different chemicals that will not be

1024
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,380
listed as ingredients in that product

1025
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,560
using a product that lists natural

1026
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,420
fragrance is not a way out

1027
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:37,520
there are still chemical industry

1028
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,520
fragrances in natural fragrances

1029
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:42,599
the chemical industry is allowed to call

1030
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,880
a fragrance natural

1031
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:46,560
if there's one single essential oil

1032
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,859
added to the mix of the industrial

1033
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,960
chemicals that's why my makeup

1034
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:55,859
or that's why my body wash and my body

1035
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:58,020
lotion is so great it says essential oil

1036
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:59,579
oh I'm not really looking at that other

1037
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,079
word in there on the bottle that's

1038
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:05,180
fragrance

1039
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:05,180
but it says essential oil natural

1040
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,319
if there's one single essential oil

1041
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,359
added to the mix of industrial chemicals

1042
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,720
they can tag their fragrance as being

1043
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,720
natural

1044
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:21,960
what an evil Escape

1045
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:24,660
whether scented products seem

1046
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,260
conventional or natural what you'll find

1047
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:30,480
listed in them are fragrance

1048
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,280
or natural fragrance

1049
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,400
or perfume

1050
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,319
or perfume

1051
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,480
you will not see the list of chemicals

1052
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:41,460
in the fragrance or perfume so you'll

1053
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,280
miss out on any understanding of how

1054
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:47,339
many industrial created chemicals

1055
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,280
go into making that scent even if it

1056
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:52,740
says naturally derived it still doesn't

1057
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,079
mean it gets a free pass

1058
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,780
there's a comment on IG

1059
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,940
I save so much money now anything with

1060
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:03,420
perfumes perfume or natural fragrances

1061
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:06,180
is left on the Shelf boom

1062
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,800
boom

1063
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,780
amazing

1064
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,740
many people in the health scene are

1065
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:16,560
concerned about conventional products oh

1066
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,180
this is pretty cool

1067
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,339
many people in the health scene are

1068
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,700
concerned about conventional products

1069
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:26,400
so they're using clean makeup

1070
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,260
clean hair care products

1071
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,480
Clean Skin products

1072
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,060
meanwhile these products all have either

1073
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:37,140
fragrances or natural fragrances or

1074
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:40,260
perfume in them or any combination

1075
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,599
if you were to sit inside a chemical

1076
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,460
Factory watching people with hazmat

1077
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:48,480
suits did you hear that

1078
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:50,940
did you hear that hazmat suits

1079
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,920
walking around giant containers of

1080
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,839
swirling chemicals

1081
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,940
and then you saw those chemicals being

1082
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:59,099
put into a fragrance and that fragrance

1083
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,440
sold to all the different companies that

1084
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:03,420
sell all these products

1085
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,800
with your clean makeup and your skincare

1086
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,480
and your body washes and your body

1087
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,660
lotions

1088
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,819
you would be shocked

1089
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,859
off your butt

1090
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:16,800
it didn't say that it said you will be

1091
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:19,560
shocked to say the least

1092
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,540
I said shocked off your butt Spirit

1093
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,079
compassion said you would be shocked to

1094
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,079
say the least

1095
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:28,619
sabotaged self-care let's read a little

1096
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,200
bit about this real quick

1097
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:34,260
we're adopting healthier Lifestyles we

1098
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,540
are adopting healthier lifestyles

1099
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,280
or eating healthier foods yes we are

1100
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,099
eating healthier foods out there in the

1101
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,940
world you see it everywhere everybody

1102
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:43,940
top five foods

1103
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,200
we're concerned about our environment

1104
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,319
yes we are concerned about our

1105
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,720
environment everybody is

1106
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,880
and at the same time we're allowing

1107
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,280
perfumes colognes and fragrances to be

1108
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,079
inside everything many people are

1109
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,079
concerned about climate change

1110
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,720
and at the same time they're

1111
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,180
contaminating our climate with chemical

1112
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,680
industry soups that are highly toxic and

1113
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:15,540
even affect wildlife

1114
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,200
one reason we turn to fragrances is

1115
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,200
self-care

1116
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,040
we're picking out perfumes and scented

1117
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:25,020
candles and scented lotions and scented

1118
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,380
everything because they're supposed to

1119
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:31,280
relax us make us relax and put us in the

1120
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,280
right frame of mind

1121
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,660
we think we're promoting well-being by

1122
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,640
using fragrances another reason we use

1123
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:41,460
so much fragrance is that our bodies

1124
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,099
have smells and fragrance is how we hide

1125
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:46,740
our stink

1126
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:49,740
it means all these fragrance chemicals

1127
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:51,900
are inside our brain we're allowing

1128
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:55,200
chemical Giants to hurt our brain age

1129
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,540
our skin and body age our lungs and age

1130
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:02,420
our organs speed up the disease process

1131
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,420
and at the same time age our pets

1132
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,619
fragrances are in air freshener scented

1133
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,319
candles makeup including clean makeup

1134
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:11,819
skin care Hair Care body care products

1135
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,220
weather clean or regular and

1136
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:16,980
conventional laundry products the more

1137
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:18,780
organic or clean we go with our domestic

1138
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:21,480
products for body care and more the more

1139
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:23,720
loopholes the chemical Giants find to

1140
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:27,480
put their fragrances with unidentified

1141
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,040
toxic chemicals into these products

1142
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,880
what I'm trying to say is the more

1143
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,880
loopholes

1144
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:39,680
the more products we have the more

1145
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,680
loopholes the chemical industry uses

1146
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,099
foreign

1147
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,460
we go with our domestic products for

1148
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,079
body care and more the more loopholes

1149
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,119
the chemical Giants find to put their

1150
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:53,220
fragrances with unidentified toxic

1151
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,380
chemicals into these products it's

1152
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:59,359
imperative we get wise to it and avoid

1153
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,359
fragrances including perfumes

1154
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,920
so you want to read this last little

1155
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,920
part here

1156
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,640
so

1157
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,079
uh end maker says so what do we buy 10

1158
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,359
question marks

1159
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:18,000
I do try to put better options on the

1160
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:20,660
medicalmedium.com directory for those

1161
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,660
who are asking

1162
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,980
forced exposure

1163
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,319
we all need to get wise to the ways the

1164
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,300
chemical industry tries to expose us to

1165
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:36,060
these fragrances even when we don't

1166
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,880
personally use them

1167
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:41,339
for example scented candles and plug-in

1168
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,700
air fresheners saturate walls even if

1169
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:46,380
the person using them moves out anyone

1170
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,720
who moves into the home or office

1171
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:51,060
afterward has to contend with the

1172
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,720
lingering scent

1173
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:56,940
fragrances can become mold harboring a

1174
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,680
film begins to develop from burning

1175
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,079
scented candles or using plug-in air

1176
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,119
fresheners and that film collects on

1177
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:05,099
every Fabric and fixture inside the home

1178
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,780
trapping particles of dust and debris

1179
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:09,359
that flow into the air

1180
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:12,740
I'm in brain saver I'm on page 212 right

1181
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,740
here can I show you guys

1182
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,480
trapped in the film this debris can

1183
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,599
Harbor moisture creating a perfect

1184
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,060
situation for mold to grow someone often

1185
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,220
uses fragrance in the first place to

1186
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:31,140
cover the smell of mold or mildew in a

1187
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:33,480
space in a situation like this where

1188
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,400
mold is already present adding fragrance

1189
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,940
products such as air fresheners or

1190
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:41,099
scented candles can accelerate the mold

1191
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:43,859
fulfillment centers

1192
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:47,160
Manila says Anthony help I'm so

1193
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:50,599
sensitive to all perfumes perfumes when

1194
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,599
I go outside my house

1195
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,200
my health is in in horror or my house is

1196
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,200
in the horror

1197
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,440
check this out you guys

1198
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,839
it breaks my heart first to begin with

1199
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,819
okay

1200
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,079
that anybody's hypersensitive and they

1201
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,700
got the chemical sensitivities and they

1202
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,160
have to deal with all this stuff

1203
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,260
that's awful fulfillment centers and

1204
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,480
warehouses are shipping out products

1205
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,880
such as clothing that are saturated with

1206
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,619
air fresheners contaminating the

1207
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,839
products that arrive at our homes and

1208
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:27,240
workplaces so you know what's happening

1209
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:29,339
is the clothing the Fashion World the

1210
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,880
clothing companies

1211
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:35,420
it's being saturated because the work

1212
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,420
houses

1213
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,720
in some of these situations with

1214
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:44,220
clothing right

1215
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:46,020
are filled with air freshener and the

1216
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:50,180
Fulfillment centers

1217
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,180
all of it filled with air fresheners

1218
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:55,559
drier dust is extremely toxic when any

1219
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,480
fragrances are used in the home which

1220
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:59,280
means that neighbors get exposed this

1221
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,440
dryer exhaust is a combination of the

1222
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,200
air fresheners in the home plus perfumes

1223
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,059
cologne scented candles Cosmetics body

1224
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,220
products saturating all the clothes

1225
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,980
being laundered

1226
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:12,839
combined with the fragrances of the

1227
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:16,200
laundry detergents and fabric softeners

1228
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:20,000
used all blowing hot air

1229
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,000
in polluting the environment

1230
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,920
guys let's make the shot let's just talk

1231
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,020
about the shot for a second

1232
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,700
this is the toxic fragrance exposure

1233
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,859
shot we're doing right now here's here's

1234
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:35,040
a comment on IG great information

1235
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:36,900
Vincent says if we don't know

1236
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,800
we can't change it

1237
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,780
I love smelling the refreshing when I go

1238
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,059
out in the bush

1239
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:47,220
cool so when you go outside and you're

1240
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:49,440
out there in the fields

1241
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:52,020
out in the bush many people call it

1242
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,720
you're out on the water you're in the

1243
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:57,359
woods you love the smell

1244
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,700
frana says sometimes I thought something

1245
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,680
was wrong with me because I can't stand

1246
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,420
perfume or deodorant it's like we're

1247
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,359
we're

1248
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,980
if you have a problem with it you're the

1249
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:10,079
problem

1250
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,300
that's how they try to do it

1251
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,520
oh you can't handle it

1252
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,020
you just you don't like the perfume

1253
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,160
cologne and air fresheners and scent of

1254
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,020
candles and everything else and

1255
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,400
detergents and all that stuff you don't

1256
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,980
like all the deadly chemical stuff

1257
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,119
created in chemical factories oh you're

1258
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,579
the problem

1259
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:28,680
it's not me I have every right to put

1260
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:31,440
all that chemical on me and smell any

1261
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,300
way I want too bad that's your problem

1262
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,940
is this what the world does

1263
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:38,220
sassy at my old place of employment a

1264
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,839
woman wore a super strong perfume that

1265
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,579
triggers my migraines

1266
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,220
it would linger for hours through

1267
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:47,059
hallways Etc I had to get

1268
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,059
out of the building

1269
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,260
it's like you can linger in your sinuses

1270
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,420
for days

1271
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,099
and then in your bloodstream when my

1272
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:59,040
neighbor left his house

1273
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:01,740
his perfume is so strong it goes through

1274
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,980
my door inside my apartment it makes me

1275
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,980
sick

1276
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,920
that's another thing too it's like

1277
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,960
people think they're making themselves

1278
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,819
smell nice right

1279
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,520
they get a new perfume a new cologne

1280
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:19,500
when I see like a cologne commercial and

1281
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,020
it's something like dude

1282
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,599
it's got no clothes on

1283
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:27,559
got a couple of tattoos

1284
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:27,559
it's a hired model

00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:34,140

just poisoning the person they're

1299
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:11,099
actually poisoning everyone around them

1300
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:15,079

1336

bad media

00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:00,180
like what happens is

1341
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:03,240
media will like

1342
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:07,440
do a smear campaign or hit piece on me

1343
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,599
because chemical industry

1344
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,300
will get them to do it

1345
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:15,740
because I do [ __ ] like this because I I

1346
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,740
actually put this out there

1347
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:21,180

the mm-1500 like

1370
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,559

1371
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,819
you because you're always right about

1372
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,460
stuff

1373
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:21,960
and you're always straight out with me

1374
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,599
that's what he said so I said okay we'll

1375
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,460
get the 1500 got the 1500

1376
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,540
and he said but he said I just didn't

1377
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,180
think I could save that much money

1378
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,880
that's what he said I thought I'd save a

1379
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:34,740
little but not a lot so then he was

1380
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,420
keeping tabs on exactly how much produce

1381
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:39,240
he was buying to run through the juicer

1382
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:41,819
and then he he weighed that against what

1383
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,160
his other juicer was and everything and

1384
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:45,780
he said it was insane it was like it was

1385
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,579
like hundreds he's saving a week and

1386
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:50,099
he's allowed to juice now

1387
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:52,760
because of the food costs going up

1388
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,760
all right

1389
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,839

and that I'm sorry I don't see with

1466
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:06,599
other juicers and that's how people save

1467
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:09,119
the money this is the mm-1500

1468
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:12,020
really proud of this machine

1469
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,020
for what it does

1470
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,819
it's why I endorsed them

1471
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:21,119
dang right

1472
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:23,700

shot

1476
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:35,839
might I add toxic fragrance exposure

1477
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,839
shots

1478
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,240
I'm just waiting see what I feel

1479
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,180
start to hit me now I only had a sip

1480
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,179
[Music]

1481
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:05,040
why do I get all this cool sensation and

1482
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:06,599
tingles I get a feeling from my head my

1483
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,760
whole head

1484
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:10,760
all through my body from these shots

1485
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:16,380
is it because of the synergistically

1486
01:04:14,339 --> 01:04:18,900
combined ribbon ingredients in the

1487
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:21,299
phytochemical compounds involved then no

1488
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:23,339
one would know work together to actually

1489
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:25,200
battle or up against and that's what

1490
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:26,900
these things are

1491
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:32,940

01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:50,400
but try to drink the shots 15 to 30

1522
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:52,559
minutes apart from any other food or

1523
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,440
