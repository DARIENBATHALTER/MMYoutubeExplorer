[14.48 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.56 - 25.88] anxiety depression endometriosis acne

[25.88 - 31.24] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.24 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 44.96] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 47.92] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[44.96 - 51.16] William we're talking about the soul and
[47.92 - 54.48] emotional Soul healing everyone is soul
[51.16 - 57.16] searching whether they know it or not
[54.48 - 60.40] but what are we really searching for
[57.16 - 64.72] happiness peace tranquility
[60.40 - 68.40] stability and can we heal the soul yes
[64.72 - 71.92] we can grab some lemon bomb find a comfy
[68.40 - 75.12] place to relax and let's get to
[71.92 - 78.36] it so everybody is soul searching
[75.12 - 81.56] someone once told me you're either soul
[78.36 - 83.40] searching or you're not and then Spirit
[81.56 - 86.80] of compassion
[83.40 - 88.92] said you're either soul searching or
[86.80 - 91.28] you're soul
[88.92 - 94.04] searching because that's the truth even
[91.28 - 96.08] if somebody doesn't know it even if they
[94.04 - 99.12] don't call it that so that's another
[96.08 - 100.44] thing like you may run into somebody and
[99.12 - 102.92] doesn't seem they don't think they're
[100.44 - 106.48] soul searching on any level they're just
[102.92 - 108.96] doing their thing living their
[106.48 - 111.24] life but they don't know they're soul
[108.96 - 112.84] searching they're soul searching but
[111.24 - 116.00] they don't call it that they're not
[112.84 - 118.56] aware that it's soul searching right we
[116.00 - 120.76] Soul search because part of us feels
[118.56 - 124.08] lost how many how many people do you
[120.76 - 127.36] know have that feeling of being lost
[124.08 - 130.16] that lost sensation like a
[127.36 - 132.96] sadness at a certain time of day what if
[130.16 - 136.48] it's like 3 4:00 in the afternoon and
[132.96 - 138.28] then a strange sadness comes over I know
[136.48 - 140.72] so many people that have it at different
[138.28 - 144.20] times and it's this thing you can't
[140.72 - 147.04] really explain but it's there we Soul
[144.20 - 150.20] search because part of us feels lost or
[147.04 - 153.20] we don't feel whole like there's a piece
[150.20 - 156.08] of us missing like we're not all of our
[153.20 - 158.52] pieces aren't there in place right it's
[156.08 - 160.68] just there's a piece of ourselves
[158.52 - 163.44] missing or because we feel like we're
[160.68 - 166.64] not living up to our Soul's potential we
[163.44 - 168.96] Soul search because of life's
[166.64 - 170.04] hardships that's another thing too is
[168.96 - 172.52] life's
[170.04 - 175.36] hardships make it so we want to go and
[172.52 - 178.32] soul search as well right often a
[175.36 - 180.60] negative experience or a series of them
[178.32 - 182.76] will prompt a person to feel broken or
[180.60 - 184.76] depleted did you ever feel broken or
[182.76 - 188.32] depleted like you just had something
[184.76 - 190.28] happen in your life right something
[188.32 - 193.56] happened in your life and it just pushed
[190.28 - 196.92] you over the edge like you were on your
[193.56 - 199.48] last Heather if you were a bird you felt
[196.92 - 201.52] like you were on your last feathers I
[199.48 - 205.08] mean where you just felt like you were
[201.52 - 207.36] pushed over hanging on the cliff like
[205.08 - 210.36] done did you ever use that term where
[207.36 - 213.12] you're like I'm done I'm done
[210.36 - 214.68] right so many people have felt like that
[213.12 - 216.56] where they're at a place where they like
[214.68 - 218.20] okay I'm done or this relationship so
[216.56 - 221.00] many people they're in a relationship
[218.20 - 222.76] that's toxic there's a lot of emotional
[221.00 - 224.44] turmoil in the relationship there's a
[222.76 - 226.40] lot going on in the relationship and
[224.44 - 229.00] they're just like I'm done I can't take
[226.40 - 230.92] this anymore I can't handle this anymore
[229.00 - 232.60] so often a negative experience or a
[230.92 - 236.00] series of them will prompt the person to
[232.60 - 238.16] feel broken or depleted and want to feel
[236.00 - 240.72] complete again it's like I want to feel
[238.16 - 242.56] whole again I want to feel like myself
[240.72 - 244.60] again and maybe I don't even know what
[242.56 - 249.52] myself felt like but I want to feel it I
[244.60 - 253.52] want to feel like I got all those pieces
[249.52 - 254.76] of my soul back I want to feel like I'm
[253.52 - 258.00] not
[254.76 - 260.52] lost I want to feel like connected to
[258.00 - 262.04] something I want that sensation I want
[260.52 - 264.24] that feeling and if you have chronic
[262.04 - 266.04] illness and you don't feel good and
[264.24 - 269.44] you're struggling with chronic illness
[266.04 - 272.36] then it really amplifies it and makes
[269.44 - 275.24] the even harder that feeling of wanting
[272.36 - 279.68] to be complete again that feeling of not
[275.24 - 283.32] wanting to feel lost that feeling of no
[279.68 - 284.96] one understands me that feeling of
[283.32 - 287.20] something's
[284.96 - 289.48] missing that's when we need that soul
[287.20 - 291.96] searching that's part of soul searching
[289.48 - 293.76] right there it can take the form of
[291.96 - 295.48] attending Retreats how many people
[293.76 - 297.36] attend Retreats they're looking for
[295.48 - 300.96] something how many
[297.36 - 302.60] people are looking for something thing
[300.96 - 304.96] so they'll go anywhere and they'll do
[302.60 - 307.28] anything they're looking for answers or
[304.96 - 310.24] they're looking for that piece of what's
[307.28 - 312.52] lost to come
[310.24 - 314.68] back sometimes it takes going to hear
[312.52 - 317.36] inspirational speakers seeking advice
[314.68 - 319.28] from loved ones enrolling in therapy how
[317.36 - 323.08] many people are in counseling how many
[319.28 - 324.60] people have had so many counselors
[323.08 - 326.32] emotional
[324.60 - 328.28] counselors
[326.32 - 330.88] therapists
[328.28 - 332.80] psychiatrists different forms of
[330.88 - 335.04] counselors because they're like trying
[332.80 - 337.16] to find an answer why am I thinking like
[335.04 - 340.24] this why am I struggling how come I feel
[337.16 - 343.84] so sad inside how come I feel so lost
[340.24 - 346.24] why am I going through this I need to
[343.84 - 349.92] find another therapist I need to find a
[346.24 - 353.48] therapist that understands me and can
[349.92 - 356.36] crack me because I'm hard to crack why
[353.48 - 359.00] am I such a tough nut to
[356.36 - 361.92] crack how how come it feels like nobody
[359.00 - 363.56] can crack me me no professional is there
[361.92 - 366.20] something wrong with me did I do
[363.56 - 369.28] something wrong am I crazy is something
[366.20 - 370.80] going wrong I mean these are feelings
[369.28 - 372.96] that we naturally feel that everybody
[370.80 - 374.68] feels at some point in their life and
[372.96 - 377.64] maybe they don't feel it now but they
[374.68 - 379.52] might feel it at another time it's what
[377.64 - 381.36] we do when we're looking to heal and
[379.52 - 383.72] Elevate our souls to strengthen our
[381.36 - 385.52] purpose in life we we look for help
[383.72 - 387.48] because we want to strengthen that
[385.52 - 391.64] purpose we want to unlock something in
[387.48 - 394.60] our soul and we want to heal your soul
[391.64 - 396.76] resides in your brain something people
[394.60 - 399.00] don't know now this is going to sound
[396.76 - 400.96] kind of gory I know it's kind of a
[399.00 - 404.32] little off topic but it's not really off
[400.96 - 407.80] topic it's a little
[404.32 - 410.44] gory but back in the olden days the
[407.80 - 414.24] reason why they beheaded people that was
[410.44 - 416.00] a very popular popular technique is
[414.24 - 418.88] because back in the olden days they
[416.00 - 422.24] sensed there was an energy all around
[418.88 - 423.64] here so what they would do is Medieval
[422.24 - 425.16] times they would put it they would chop
[423.64 - 428.48] people's heads off and put their heads
[425.16 - 431.28] on spikes right or Pikes or something
[428.48 - 433.04] they would put their heads on sticks on
[431.28 - 435.36] the sides of roads and all that or they
[433.04 - 438.68] would behead people with Guillotines
[435.36 - 440.76] right for some reason they felt like
[438.68 - 442.80] that was the most satisfying way to end
[440.76 - 444.72] somebody's life because there was
[442.80 - 446.76] something more satiating about it in the
[444.72 - 448.36] medieval days and what they what they
[446.76 - 450.68] were actually tapping into without
[448.36 - 452.72] realizing it there was a lot going on
[450.68 - 454.40] here but they didn't know that's where
[452.72 - 456.84] the soul resides and that's why they had
[454.40 - 461.00] a desire to behead people because the
[456.84 - 462.52] soul resided in the head they didn't
[461.00 - 464.96] know
[462.52 - 467.72] that they didn't know the soul resided
[464.96 - 469.08] in the head but they had this innate
[467.72 - 471.08] desire when they wanted to end
[469.08 - 473.68] somebody's life to behead them to chop
[471.08 - 476.56] off their head that was what that is why
[473.68 - 479.96] they did that and then they had this
[476.56 - 481.88] innate desire to exhibit
[479.96 - 483.80] someone's head chopped off they had this
[481.88 - 487.08] innate desire to actually exhibit it so
[483.80 - 489.76] exhibit the head on a pike on the sides
[487.08 - 491.84] of Roads or in villages where they would
[489.76 - 494.68] slay a village and then they would chop
[491.84 - 497.56] off everybody's head and put it on Pikes
[494.68 - 499.48] because they felt that a message was
[497.56 - 504.68] sent
[499.48 - 504.68] more and what it was was what they were
[505.08 - 510.44] detecting yeah it's gory but what they
[507.40 - 512.68] were what they were detecting was there
[510.44 - 514.64] was more energy here even though the
[512.68 - 516.80] whole body there was more body weight
[514.64 - 518.92] and body mass everywhere else there was
[516.80 - 521.48] more energy
[518.92 - 523.64] here so what they were detecting without
[521.48 - 526.36] realizing it they were detecting the
[523.64 - 527.92] soul was here inside the brain so they
[526.36 - 529.56] had a great desire if they wanted to end
[527.92 - 532.40] somebody's life back in the in the
[529.56 - 533.80] medieval the Dark Ages they would chop
[532.40 - 537.64] off the
[533.80 - 540.80] head your soul resides in your brain
[537.64 - 543.16] where your soul stores memories and
[540.80 - 545.00] experiences that's where your soul is
[543.16 - 547.68] storing memories and
[545.00 - 550.52] experiences they're in the soul when our
[547.68 - 554.52] soul leaves our body it
[550.52 - 556.40] takes these experiences with it when you
[554.52 - 559.40] pass from this Mortal
[556.40 - 562.68] realm your soul
[559.40 - 565.36] carries those memories as it moves
[562.68 - 568.08] onward your soul carries those memories
[565.36 - 571.40] as it moves onward so when we pass from
[568.08 - 574.32] this Mortal place this Mortal realm
[571.40 - 577.12] right our soul carries these memories as
[574.32 - 579.76] it moves onward even if someone has a
[577.12 - 581.68] brain injury or brain disease that keeps
[579.76 - 584.96] her or him from remembering certain
[581.68 - 587.36] things so hear this for a second so if
[584.96 - 590.36] somebody has Alzheimer's
[587.36 - 593.12] dementia if someone is losing their
[590.36 - 595.92] train of thought losing their mind and
[593.12 - 598.72] they pass away from a brain
[595.92 - 600.84] disease even if someone has a brain
[598.72 - 603.64] injury or brain disease like Alzheimer's
[600.84 - 607.08] or dementia or something like that
[603.64 - 609.08] incopy right that keeps her or him from
[607.08 - 610.88] remembering certain things the soul will
[609.08 - 613.08] bring all those memories with it when
[610.88 - 615.60] that person passes on if you have a
[613.08 - 617.84] grandfather a grandmother or a family
[615.60 - 620.52] member or a friend that is losing their
[617.84 - 622.36] mind because they have the Alzheimer's
[620.52 - 624.12] they have dementia they're really
[622.36 - 626.24] suffering they don't even know who they
[624.12 - 629.48] are they lose their memory completely
[626.24 - 631.92] and they pass away you have to remember
[629.48 - 634.88] something the pain and suffering a loved
[631.92 - 636.64] one has says where did their memories go
[634.88 - 638.16] don't they remember me how come they
[636.64 - 641.40] don't remember me how come they don't
[638.16 - 644.64] see who I am my grandfather's sitting
[641.40 - 646.40] there and he knows me I he raised me I'm
[644.64 - 649.00] walking into the room and my
[646.40 - 651.84] grandfather's saying how are you I don't
[649.00 - 653.72] know who you are you have to remember
[651.84 - 655.96] that every me memory that that
[653.72 - 658.20] grandfather has grandmother that friend
[655.96 - 660.32] that mother father that brother sister
[658.20 - 663.24] every memory that they have about you
[660.32 - 666.48] and their life is still trapped in there
[663.24 - 668.88] it's in there just because the brain
[666.48 - 670.80] disease is eating away neurons it
[668.88 - 672.72] doesn't mean the soul doesn't take those
[670.80 - 674.08] memories with it that's the whole point
[672.72 - 676.28] and what I learned from Spirit of
[674.08 - 679.32] compassion is the soul takes those
[676.28 - 682.00] memories with it as it
[679.32 - 684.88] leaves so it's not like that family
[682.00 - 687.44] member their lives are just completely
[684.88 - 690.88] wiped out and completely gone it's not
[687.44 - 692.48] like that at all it's the opposite yes
[690.88 - 695.36] in that moment it feels that way but
[692.48 - 696.76] when they leave and their soul passes on
[695.36 - 699.72] they have all the memories there they
[696.76 - 701.72] didn't lose that they know who you are
[699.72 - 704.32] when a grandfather grandmother a friend
[701.72 - 707.44] or a family member soul is leaving them
[704.32 - 710.48] as they pass in that moment even if they
[707.44 - 714.16] lost ability to understand who you were
[710.48 - 717.64] as they were fading away they still when
[714.16 - 722.12] they leave and that Soul lifts up from
[717.64 - 725.24] that body they instantly know you who
[722.12 - 727.96] you are every memory they shared with
[725.24 - 729.72] you everything about you all that
[727.96 - 732.60] they've done with you every experience
[729.72 - 737.20] they've ever had with you they know and
[732.60 - 740.20] they see it and see you as their soul
[737.20 - 742.60] leaves the body your soul also stores
[740.20 - 745.12] your hope people don't realize that that
[742.60 - 747.08] their soul actually stores their hope do
[745.12 - 749.20] you think you're hopeless you're not you
[747.08 - 750.88] think you have no hope anymore uhuh
[749.20 - 755.32] that's not true you think you've lost
[750.88 - 759.04] all your hope no no no no no you didn't
[755.32 - 760.44] lose all your hope your hope is stored
[759.04 - 764.16] it's
[760.44 - 767.44] stored in your soul there's a well of it
[764.16 - 769.24] in your soul your soul also stores faith
[767.44 - 771.24] if you have faith in God your soul
[769.24 - 774.24] stores that faith if you have faith in
[771.24 - 776.00] Jesus Christ your soul stores that faith
[774.24 - 777.60] if you're a Christian and you have faith
[776.00 - 779.48] in Jesus Christ if for some reason
[777.60 - 782.64] you're a Christian and you lost faith in
[779.48 - 785.72] Jesus Christ I promise you this your
[782.64 - 787.04] soul still has faith in Jesus Christ if
[785.72 - 789.72] you're someone that's not a Christian
[787.04 - 791.68] and you just believe in God and God God
[789.72 - 793.40] is who you believe in and you have faith
[791.68 - 794.88] in God and you have tremendous faith in
[793.40 - 796.52] God and then all of a sudden something
[794.88 - 798.84] happens to you in your life and you lose
[796.52 - 802.92] faith in God I promise you this your
[798.84 - 805.40] soul still stores your faith in God if
[802.92 - 807.72] you think you lost trust and you had
[805.40 - 809.40] trust and now you can't trust anything
[807.72 - 812.04] anymore and you can't trust anyone
[809.40 - 814.20] anymore you can't trust anyone you can't
[812.04 - 816.68] trust anything anymore cuz you lost
[814.20 - 819.64] trust I can promise you this that you
[816.68 - 821.28] have trust stored in your soul reason
[819.64 - 824.64] for that is it helps to keep us on the
[821.28 - 828.12] right path so we stay stay present here
[824.64 - 830.72] ideally we would all have fully intact
[828.12 - 833.08] Souls over the course of life's
[830.72 - 835.20] hardships though a soul can become
[833.08 - 838.28] fractured and even lose pieces of itself
[835.20 - 840.52] but that's okay because we still never
[838.28 - 842.40] lose our soul this can be caused by
[840.52 - 844.56] traumatic events traumatic events can
[842.40 - 846.76] fracture our soul but that's all right
[844.56 - 848.00] because our soul can mend and heal our
[846.76 - 851.44] soul is
[848.00 - 855.44] unbreakable it is unbreakable regardless
[851.44 - 857.64] of a fracture regardless of hardships
[855.44 - 860.52] beating it down and wearing and tearing
[857.64 - 862.40] on your soul it is
[860.52 - 864.40] unbreakable this can be caused by
[862.40 - 867.32] traumatic events such as the death of a
[864.40 - 870.00] loved one so many people go through
[867.32 - 872.60] betrayal by a loved one or betrayal of
[870.00 - 874.52] oneself as well as ongoing traumas such
[872.60 - 876.32] as the loss of freedom and trust that
[874.52 - 878.56] comes with experiencing chronic symptoms
[876.32 - 881.00] and illness I think so many people have
[878.56 - 884.08] been beaten down with their illness you
[881.00 - 886.16] guys know about that you had
[884.08 - 887.72] symptoms or you still have them because
[886.16 - 889.20] you just found medical medium and you're
[887.72 - 891.28] working on your healing process but
[889.20 - 893.68] you've been down that road and you had
[891.28 - 897.84] so many symptoms and suffered greatly so
[893.68 - 901.40] bad and that wears and tears on the
[897.84 - 903.84] soul to throughout the years I
[901.40 - 906.76] would through a process that Spirit of
[903.84 - 908.60] compassion has has taught me to
[906.76 - 911.64] scan
[908.60 - 913.88] someone and spirit of compassion would
[911.64 - 917.28] show me if they had any fractures on
[913.88 - 919.16] their soul and it resembled cracks in a
[917.28 - 920.88] cathedral window that's what it
[919.16 - 923.28] resembled when I would see it through
[920.88 - 926.20] Spirit of compassion's eyes because a
[923.28 - 928.52] soul is made out of light our souls are
[926.20 - 929.68] a form of light that when a soul is
[928.52 - 931.88] fractured
[929.68 - 935.00] it looks like the sun it looks like the
[931.88 - 937.80] inside like you're inside a church and
[935.00 - 940.20] the stained glass windows there's light
[937.80 - 942.44] coming through the Sun as for a soul
[940.20 - 944.20] with missing pieces it's like a house at
[942.44 - 946.52] night that's meant to have all its
[944.20 - 949.88] lights on except some of its rooms are
[946.52 - 951.80] still dark when Soul injuries are fresh
[949.88 - 955.52] they can result in the feeling of being
[951.80 - 958.04] lost or loss of connection with oneself
[955.52 - 959.56] loss of Desire or inspiration to
[958.04 - 961.60] preserve or thr
[959.56 - 963.40] so many people lose their Inspirations
[961.60 - 965.76] they feel like they're dead inside they
[963.40 - 966.80] feel like they died inside they're numb
[965.76 - 968.80] and they don't feel like there's
[966.80 - 971.16] anything left in them they feel like
[968.80 - 974.44] there's nothing there anymore they feel
[971.16 - 976.08] like they are not being seen by anything
[974.44 - 978.52] and they're completely alone and
[976.08 - 980.52] completely in the dark and that's what
[978.52 - 982.48] happens when Soul injuries are actually
[980.52 - 986.08] fresh it just
[982.48 - 989.16] happened I just got let down that person
[986.08 - 991.80] broke my trust I feel so injured I feel
[989.16 - 994.32] so misunderstood and not heard so when
[991.80 - 998.40] the soul injuries are fresh they can
[994.32 - 1000.00] result in feeling like you're lost or
[998.40 - 1001.76] there's a loss of connection like
[1000.00 - 1004.20] where's the connection there's no
[1001.76 - 1007.80] connection a loss of Desire or
[1004.20 - 1011.36] inspiration to persevere or Thrive or
[1007.80 - 1013.12] even like life force how many that you
[1011.36 - 1016.76] guys know that where you feel like you
[1013.12 - 1019.08] lose your life force because you just
[1016.76 - 1021.68] had such a hard time that's why
[1019.08 - 1025.36] important to be aware of our soul and
[1021.68 - 1027.20] that's how you heal emotional support is
[1025.36 - 1029.44] understanding our own soul because
[1027.20 - 1031.36] people they don't realize they have this
[1029.44 - 1034.00] connection to their own soul they don't
[1031.36 - 1037.04] know how to connect to their own
[1034.00 - 1039.40] soul when you understand your soul and
[1037.04 - 1042.16] and understand where it is and and if
[1039.40 - 1045.08] it's been injured and how strong it is
[1042.16 - 1048.12] and how powerful it is when you connect
[1045.08 - 1050.76] to your soul that's how you can really
[1048.12 - 1053.32] do some emo healing and rise out of
[1050.76 - 1056.04] something that's why it's important to
[1053.32 - 1058.52] be aware of our soul wounds from
[1056.04 - 1061.92] hardships betrayal and broken trust or
[1058.52 - 1064.92] emotional hurt often exhaust a person's
[1061.92 - 1067.36] immune system adrenals and other bod's
[1064.92 - 1069.16] defenses triggering a physical issue
[1067.36 - 1072.56] that could be residing deep within our
[1069.16 - 1074.04] organs and body so it's twofold if you
[1072.56 - 1075.32] guys go through a hard time if somebody
[1074.04 - 1077.52] goes through a hard
[1075.32 - 1081.44] time I know a friend that just got
[1077.52 - 1084.68] betrayed so bad just so bad the Betrayal
[1081.44 - 1086.16] was just horrendous and he didn't want
[1084.68 - 1089.76] to live
[1086.16 - 1093.20] anymore but when he really understood
[1089.76 - 1094.12] the soul connection that I was teaching
[1093.20 - 1096.64] him
[1094.12 - 1098.64] about it was giving him a chance to say
[1096.64 - 1101.60] you know I could get through this you
[1098.64 - 1103.20] can't you can't take my soul away no
[1101.60 - 1106.20] one's going to be able to take my soul
[1103.20 - 1108.28] away but at the same time adrenals can
[1106.20 - 1110.56] get beaten down and our immune systems
[1108.28 - 1113.60] can can be lowered because we're going
[1110.56 - 1116.68] through a lot if we're betrayed it does
[1113.60 - 1120.40] play it does take a hit on our immune
[1116.68 - 1124.16] system and our physical body it can beat
[1120.40 - 1127.40] us down our adrenals you go into this
[1124.16 - 1130.40] point where your adrenaline just spikes
[1127.40 - 1135.60] and feels like it gets out of control if
[1130.40 - 1139.32] someone's messing with you or you had a
[1135.60 - 1141.84] hardship someone just
[1139.32 - 1143.52] you you know your trust you don't trust
[1141.84 - 1146.20] them anymore something happened and all
[1143.52 - 1148.60] of a sudden it's like adrenaline you can
[1146.20 - 1150.56] even feel like you're shaking you get so
[1148.60 - 1154.56] upset and hurt where you're
[1150.56 - 1157.84] shaking and that's the adrenaline now
[1154.56 - 1160.80] being released and takes a toll on the
[1157.84 - 1163.76] body sometimes a person's soul
[1160.80 - 1166.56] injury and resulting emotional state
[1163.76 - 1168.56] isn't a physical problem yet symptoms
[1166.56 - 1171.28] often take time to build quietly in the
[1168.56 - 1173.40] back background so a soul injury at an
[1171.28 - 1175.96] earlier time in life could be the
[1173.40 - 1178.52] trigger for the future symptoms or
[1175.96 - 1180.64] full-blown conditions to come if you
[1178.52 - 1182.64] don't have the right knowledge tools and
[1180.64 - 1185.76] resources to take care of your soul and
[1182.64 - 1187.76] physical body we can get in trouble the
[1185.76 - 1190.24] medical medium tools are there to
[1187.76 - 1193.88] support your physical body and your
[1190.24 - 1196.36] emotional body that's how you win it's
[1193.88 - 1199.48] both they're there and even if you don't
[1196.36 - 1203.20] support your your emotional body
[1199.48 - 1205.80] and you heal physically it naturally can
[1203.20 - 1208.16] help to heal the emotional part of what
[1205.80 - 1210.00] you're going through in your life it can
[1208.16 - 1211.72] help heal the
[1210.00 - 1215.16] emotional
[1211.72 - 1218.64] injuries let's be clear emotional wounds
[1215.16 - 1221.24] and soul wounds are not the reason for
[1218.64 - 1224.28] physical suffering that's important to
[1221.24 - 1227.04] know they are not the cause of physical
[1224.28 - 1229.76] suffering they're not the cause of
[1227.04 - 1232.64] fibromyalgia they're not the cause of
[1229.76 - 1233.68] thyroid cancer they're not the cause of
[1232.64 - 1238.00] multiple
[1233.68 - 1240.00] sclerosis or lupus or lime disease
[1238.00 - 1243.24] rather they can act as
[1240.00 - 1245.04] triggers for underlying
[1243.24 - 1247.00] susceptibilities when we go through
[1245.04 - 1249.08] emotional hardships it can knock us so
[1247.00 - 1251.80] hard it lowers our immune system and it
[1249.08 - 1254.44] triggers us when we go through emotional
[1251.80 - 1256.52] hardships our adrenaline can really get
[1254.44 - 1260.12] kicked into high gear because we're
[1256.52 - 1264.68] emotionally injured and then we get
[1260.12 - 1267.92] knocked down a notch it knocks us down I
[1264.68 - 1270.52] can't tell you how many people that got
[1267.92 - 1272.52] into a difficult relationship and it was
[1270.52 - 1274.88] there was so much turmoil in that
[1272.52 - 1277.84] relationship there was so much fighting
[1274.88 - 1280.60] and cheating and betrayal in that
[1277.84 - 1282.80] relationship that it lowered the immune
[1280.60 - 1286.12] system and when it lowered the immune
[1282.80 - 1289.00] system it broke them down and other
[1286.12 - 1291.68] things they had residing inside of them
[1289.00 - 1294.00] pathogens rose up and now they have
[1291.68 - 1296.20] chronic fatigue syndrome they become
[1294.00 - 1298.56] triggers but you're stronger than you
[1296.20 - 1301.32] know have battled this long and gotten
[1298.56 - 1302.48] yourself this far in life now you can
[1301.32 - 1305.16] rise
[1302.48 - 1307.36] above all this is knowledge so you can
[1305.16 - 1309.60] rise above your wounds you can rise
[1307.36 - 1310.48] above the injuries physically that
[1309.60 - 1312.52] you've
[1310.48 - 1315.52] had the
[1312.52 - 1318.60] pathogens the exposures you can rise
[1315.52 - 1321.92] above that and heal your emotions too
[1318.60 - 1326.56] and Rise Above any kind of Soul injuries
[1321.92 - 1328.56] a person with soul injury is vulnerable
[1326.56 - 1331.12] if you ever hear a friend say I'm not
[1328.56 - 1333.64] ready for another relationship I'm still
[1331.12 - 1335.64] hurting from my breakup she's
[1333.64 - 1338.20] acknowledging that her soul needs time
[1335.64 - 1341.88] to heal before she risks putting herself
[1338.20 - 1344.16] out there again so many of us know when
[1341.88 - 1346.60] our soul is is vulnerable we know that
[1344.16 - 1348.64] we're susceptible we know it's like whoa
[1346.60 - 1350.24] I can't do that right now I can't go
[1348.64 - 1352.64] through that again right now I I need to
[1350.24 - 1354.48] step back a little bit my soul isn't
[1352.64 - 1357.40] feeling that strong my soul's not
[1354.48 - 1359.76] feeling strong enough along the same
[1357.40 - 1361.80] lines if you ever observe someone who's
[1359.76 - 1364.52] sick with symptoms or conditions and
[1361.80 - 1367.92] hasn't been able to find answers you may
[1364.52 - 1371.00] see this person hungrily pursuing
[1367.92 - 1374.80] spiritual learning in any form like
[1371.00 - 1377.84] religion spiritual gurus self-help books
[1374.80 - 1379.96] meditation Retreats breath work it's
[1377.84 - 1383.80] likely because that person's soul has
[1379.96 - 1387.36] been injured from all the trust lost
[1383.80 - 1389.88] along the way and she or he is
[1387.36 - 1392.84] instinctively searching for ways to make
[1389.88 - 1395.00] the soul healthy and complete again when
[1392.84 - 1397.20] we fall ill with symptoms that won't go
[1395.00 - 1399.84] away or that continue to come and go we
[1397.20 - 1402.32] lose trust in our body and in others to
[1399.84 - 1404.96] help us there are people who have been
[1402.32 - 1407.04] sick for years who turn to soul
[1404.96 - 1409.40] searching when they can't find answers
[1407.04 - 1412.40] and that's another thing too I I watched
[1409.40 - 1414.84] this for decades people are looking for
[1412.40 - 1417.52] Spiritual answers because no one knows
[1414.84 - 1421.68] why they're sick physically what was
[1417.52 - 1424.68] really popular back like 30 years ago 25
[1421.68 - 1426.52] years ago was because nobody knew of
[1424.68 - 1428.48] course why anybody was sick with chronic
[1426.52 - 1431.68] illness you go and find
[1428.48 - 1433.92] somebody and then you try to find some
[1431.68 - 1436.04] kind of healer to to give you any kind
[1433.92 - 1437.52] of answer and there's a good chance
[1436.04 - 1440.52] they'll tell you it's because you had
[1437.52 - 1444.40] your head chopped off off in
[1440.52 - 1446.40] 1733 in England somewhere and that's why
[1444.40 - 1449.04] you're actually sick or they'll say you
[1446.40 - 1449.68] drowns they will say like in the 1600s
[1449.04 - 1453.16] you
[1449.68 - 1456.36] were you were deemed a witch in the
[1453.16 - 1461.40] 1600s and you were put to death by
[1456.36 - 1463.68] Drowning because nobody knew any answers
[1461.40 - 1465.44] right I remember people would come to me
[1463.68 - 1468.40] and they'd be like well I've been to
[1465.44 - 1470.24] every doctor and now I've been to every
[1468.40 - 1473.52] every psychic and healer I can find
[1470.24 - 1476.60] around the planet and I have some I have
[1473.52 - 1481.20] some good good leads one lead is I was
[1476.60 - 1484.00] drowned as a witch in 16 in the 1600s
[1481.20 - 1485.96] and because of that that's why I'm sick
[1484.00 - 1488.12] and I have all these problems and
[1485.96 - 1491.16] everything else and spirit of compassion
[1488.12 - 1494.48] would say that's not why the person's
[1491.16 - 1496.20] sick person has real real reasons why
[1494.48 - 1498.88] they're sick and those are the answers
[1496.20 - 1500.88] you find in the medical medium books
[1498.88 - 1503.60] sometimes soul searching will bring
[1500.88 - 1505.24] people closer to themselves many times
[1503.60 - 1507.80] it will leave them feeling more lost
[1505.24 - 1510.00] than ever did you ever go soul searching
[1507.80 - 1512.84] and then you feel more lost than ever
[1510.00 - 1515.56] did you ever try to find yourself but
[1512.84 - 1517.92] yet you feel more lost did that ever
[1515.56 - 1520.84] happen to you where you're you're going
[1517.92 - 1522.04] to try to find yourself right and you
[1520.84 - 1524.24] think you're going to find yourself
[1522.04 - 1526.40] you're trying to find yourself and then
[1524.24 - 1528.44] you're like ah I think I found myself I
[1526.40 - 1530.52] do I think I found myself but then then
[1528.44 - 1532.68] all of a sudden you feel more lost than
[1530.52 - 1534.64] ever and then you feel like you're down
[1532.68 - 1537.88] a rabbit hole where it's
[1534.64 - 1540.36] worse many times it will leave someone
[1537.88 - 1542.80] feeling more loss than ever under the GU
[1540.36 - 1544.88] of help you may have heard the false
[1542.80 - 1546.92] theory that illness is just a cry for
[1544.88 - 1548.76] attention did you guys ever hear that
[1546.92 - 1551.60] the false theory that went around for
[1548.76 - 1553.12] decades that medical medium information
[1551.60 - 1555.48] had to
[1553.12 - 1557.32] disprove did you ever hear that where
[1555.48 - 1560.56] it's a cry for help that's why you're
[1557.32 - 1562.16] sick you were looking for attention did
[1560.56 - 1564.88] you ever hear that one where you were
[1562.16 - 1567.36] looking for attention that's why you
[1564.88 - 1569.12] were sick that's another one that has
[1567.36 - 1572.64] tortured people for years that medical
[1569.12 - 1575.80] medium info had to disprove to help
[1572.64 - 1578.20] people they give them answers I can't
[1575.80 - 1579.52] tell you how many times I've heard that
[1578.20 - 1581.72] like you're just you're just want
[1579.52 - 1584.60] attention that's that's why what you're
[1581.72 - 1586.40] doing right that's what everybody's told
[1584.60 - 1588.68] it just breaks my heart when I even hear
[1586.40 - 1591.00] that you may have heard that when bad
[1588.68 - 1592.96] things happen to us we cause them by
[1591.00 - 1595.24] thinking the wrong thoughts did you guys
[1592.96 - 1597.84] hear that one bad things are happening
[1595.24 - 1600.52] to you you're sick because you caused it
[1597.84 - 1602.32] with your by having the wrong thoughts
[1600.52 - 1604.88] like by having the wrong thoughts that's
[1602.32 - 1607.24] why you're sick you caused your sickness
[1604.88 - 1610.56] by thinking the wrong thoughts see these
[1607.24 - 1614.68] are all made up things made up theories
[1610.56 - 1617.20] here by Men by men here on the planet
[1614.68 - 1620.12] and women here on the planet it's made
[1617.20 - 1624.48] of theories and spirit of compassion is
[1620.12 - 1626.88] not from here so has Clarity on this
[1624.48 - 1631.04] because I can't tell you how many times
[1626.88 - 1633.92] I've had to rewire someone because they
[1631.04 - 1635.72] were positive they were sick because
[1633.92 - 1637.80] they had bad thoughts and that's why
[1635.72 - 1640.24] they were sick I've said it before and
[1637.80 - 1643.40] I'll say it again if you are ill or
[1640.24 - 1647.96] going through a trial like a divorce or
[1643.40 - 1649.84] a loss you did not manifest it if you
[1647.96 - 1653.24] are are going through a sickness you did
[1649.84 - 1655.28] not manifest it if you are going through
[1653.24 - 1657.56] some type of feeling of like being
[1655.28 - 1659.44] disconnected feeling lost feeling
[1657.56 - 1662.80] hopeless and depressed you did not
[1659.44 - 1666.28] manifest it if you feel sadness that you
[1662.80 - 1668.04] can't explain and you feel like no one
[1666.28 - 1670.12] understands you and you can't understand
[1668.04 - 1673.60] yourself you feel and you feel like you
[1670.12 - 1678.56] lost all trust in yourself you did
[1673.60 - 1681.68] not manifest that you did not attract it
[1678.56 - 1684.12] it is not punishment or payback it's not
[1681.68 - 1685.96] Karma if you guys have struggled and you
[1684.12 - 1688.24] suffered and something happened to you
[1685.96 - 1691.44] along the way whatever you do don't
[1688.24 - 1693.64] think it's karma paying you back in this
[1691.44 - 1695.64] lifetime if a child is sick you mean to
[1693.64 - 1698.00] tell me that child's karma is why that
[1695.64 - 1700.00] child is suffering the one thing you'll
[1698.00 - 1702.16] find in the medical medium information
[1700.00 - 1704.48] is about freeing the brainwashing and
[1702.16 - 1706.56] freeing you up of the brainwashing and
[1704.48 - 1708.84] mind control that has been out there
[1706.56 - 1711.00] forever and that mind control is in the
[1708.84 - 1713.32] alternative arts and alternative healing
[1711.00 - 1714.92] I'm so sorry to say I really am it
[1713.32 - 1717.00] breaks my heart and kills me it's also
[1714.92 - 1720.16] in the conventional healing too in the
[1717.00 - 1722.72] conventional world that mind control and
[1720.16 - 1725.00] brain conditioning is unbelievable
[1722.72 - 1728.72] there's a spiritual war out there it
[1725.00 - 1731.80] really is and it just controls
[1728.72 - 1733.96] people purposely so that those people
[1731.80 - 1734.96] can control everybody else it's like
[1733.96 - 1737.44] it's
[1734.96 - 1740.08] unbelievable you did not attract it it's
[1737.44 - 1742.40] not punish or payback it's not your Bad
[1740.08 - 1744.44] Karma you have to know you're not sick
[1742.40 - 1747.04] because of your karma whatever you do
[1744.44 - 1749.20] you can't fall into that you do not
[1747.04 - 1752.08] deserve to be sick or unhappy it's not
[1749.20 - 1754.56] your fault you didn't manifest it it's
[1752.08 - 1756.04] not your fault and it's not Karma I can
[1754.56 - 1758.88] promise you
[1756.04 - 1761.32] that you don't need to travel the world
[1758.88 - 1765.08] trying to find yourself I've seen people
[1761.32 - 1767.64] who have money travel the world to find
[1765.08 - 1771.00] themselves and they're still sick Soul
[1767.64 - 1775.56] healing is about reclaiming who you
[1771.00 - 1778.08] are because you are already good enough
[1775.56 - 1781.48] who you are already means more than you
[1778.08 - 1784.32] know you are already good
[1781.48 - 1788.76] enough it's just about healing now you
[1784.32 - 1791.96] are already good enough you deserve to
[1788.76 - 1795.28] heal you deserve to be happy you deserve
[1791.96 - 1798.44] to feel whole your heart serves as the
[1795.28 - 1800.04] compass for your actions guiding you to
[1798.44 - 1801.76] do the right thing when your soul
[1800.04 - 1804.76] becomes
[1801.76 - 1807.00] lost when our souls become lost we feel
[1804.76 - 1809.64] like we're disconnected we feel like our
[1807.00 - 1813.00] soul is busted up and broken our heart
[1809.64 - 1815.00] serves as the compass for our actions it
[1813.00 - 1817.16] guides us to do the right thing when our
[1815.00 - 1819.52] soul becomes lost our heart matters in
[1817.16 - 1822.12] that situation your heart is also a
[1819.52 - 1824.32] safety net that can compensate for soul
[1822.12 - 1826.84] injuries that means when we get broken
[1824.32 - 1828.44] down so hard and we had a really bad
[1826.84 - 1832.56] relationship or something happened in
[1828.44 - 1834.92] her life our heart Stands Strong this
[1832.56 - 1838.44] means you can have a tattered soul and a
[1834.92 - 1841.24] warm loving heart I can't tell you how
[1838.44 - 1843.72] many people that I've met that have the
[1841.24 - 1846.28] tattered they've been tattered along the
[1843.72 - 1848.12] way but their heart is warm and their
[1846.28 - 1850.28] heart is loving and their heart is
[1848.12 - 1852.72] caring I've been through a lot in my
[1850.28 - 1854.72] life and I still care and I still want
[1852.72 - 1856.00] to help and I still care about people
[1854.72 - 1857.56] and love people and I know there's a
[1856.00 - 1859.92] whole bunch of people out there they've
[1857.56 - 1862.96] been through Helen back and they still
[1859.92 - 1868.28] have a heart that's warm and loving and
[1862.96 - 1871.16] they care when your soul suffers losses
[1868.28 - 1873.40] a strong heart will get you through with
[1871.16 - 1877.12] Selfless Love
[1873.40 - 1880.28] compassion and joy under the soul until
[1877.12 - 1881.08] your soul has managed to heal compassion
[1880.28 - 1884.24] is
[1881.08 - 1888.88] critical superficial love that's a
[1884.24 - 1891.80] matter of the Mind self selfless love
[1888.88 - 1893.88] that comes from the heart you guys know
[1891.80 - 1898.48] about superficial love right The
[1893.88 - 1902.08] Superficial love love is not
[1898.48 - 1905.12] absolute love is not
[1902.08 - 1907.16] everything unless compassion is attached
[1905.12 - 1909.52] to it that's why you can see somebody
[1907.16 - 1911.08] and they'll fall in love with someone
[1909.52 - 1914.68] and then they can fall out of love with
[1911.08 - 1916.68] someone like what was it was it just a
[1914.68 - 1919.36] change of heart a change of mind what
[1916.68 - 1921.72] was that how can you be so in love with
[1919.36 - 1924.56] someone so in love with them and then
[1921.72 - 1927.20] not love them anymore that means that
[1924.56 - 1928.20] love had no compassion in there it
[1927.20 - 1930.64] wasn't
[1928.20 - 1934.76] attached they were
[1930.64 - 1937.80] separated if you have love for someone
[1934.76 - 1940.68] and it's lost that means that the
[1937.80 - 1944.44] compassion is gone compassion is the
[1940.68 - 1946.84] glue to love love isn't enough you have
[1944.44 - 1949.44] to have compassion as the glue for love
[1946.84 - 1951.92] or love won't stand a chance love won't
[1949.44 - 1953.64] hang in there love won't even Last Love
[1951.92 - 1957.72] Won't Be Strong Enough Love is just an
[1953.64 - 1960.16] empty word love is a totally empty word
[1957.72 - 1963.00] if compassion isn't intertwined or
[1960.16 - 1964.72] attached or somehow involved if you
[1963.00 - 1967.68] don't have compassion involved if
[1964.72 - 1971.00] compassion's not part of love then love
[1967.68 - 1974.12] is not strong enough isn't everything
[1971.00 - 1976.80] just a lesson we try to learn from it so
[1974.12 - 1978.72] we don't get burned by that stove again
[1976.80 - 1982.48] but no everything's not not just a
[1978.72 - 1985.12] lesson unfortunately it's not it's like
[1982.48 - 1988.64] you don't need your arm chopped off to
[1985.12 - 1991.64] teach you a lesson is that a lesson I
[1988.64 - 1994.88] know a lot of war vets that lost their
[1991.64 - 1997.16] legs I'm intertwined with a lot of vets
[1994.88 - 1999.80] I have vets in my family the whole bit
[1997.16 - 2002.64] and losing both your legs is not there
[1999.80 - 2004.92] to teach you a lesson we can certainly
[2002.64 - 2006.72] try to grow from it and learn from it
[2004.92 - 2010.28] but it wasn't done on purpose to teach
[2006.72 - 2013.76] us a lesson child abuse isn't there to
[2010.28 - 2015.64] teach a child a lesson so yeah no things
[2013.76 - 2016.48] aren't there for a lesson that's not how
[2015.64 - 2018.92] it
[2016.48 - 2020.56] works we can try to grow we can try to
[2018.92 - 2022.44] better ourselves we can try to rise
[2020.56 - 2025.40] above it we can try to use tools to rise
[2022.44 - 2027.52] above it but it wasn't there to teach a
[2025.40 - 2032.40] child a lesson child abuse and it wasn't
[2027.52 - 2034.72] there for a a soldier who's trying to do
[2032.40 - 2037.24] something good it wasn't there that
[2034.72 - 2039.56] Soldier to lose their legs being killed
[2037.24 - 2041.32] isn't lesson either for us to learn
[2039.56 - 2043.08] abuse of any kind for someone isn't a
[2041.32 - 2044.76] lesson for us to learn we're not that's
[2043.08 - 2047.72] not a lesson we're not supposed to learn
[2044.76 - 2053.24] that as a lesson but it
[2047.72 - 2057.48] happens our soul is strong only God
[2053.24 - 2059.60] knows what our soul went through and if
[2057.48 - 2064.12] and when it was
[2059.60 - 2067.92] wronged our soul is her life's song
[2064.12 - 2071.68] walking in the woods it's you and just
[2067.92 - 2076.52] your soul birds can feel it and they
[2071.68 - 2081.60] sing a Love Song and your soul sings
[2076.52 - 2085.88] along our soul is our eternal power a
[2081.60 - 2089.44] light that can never die out a light
[2085.88 - 2095.44] that shines bright long after we leave
[2089.44 - 2099.68] this place our soul can be tall so tall
[2095.44 - 2104.60] it can Tower there is no wall your soul
[2099.68 - 2105.92] can't stand above and see all it stores
[2104.60 - 2110.20] all of our
[2105.92 - 2114.16] experiences deep within itself the soul
[2110.20 - 2117.40] can store your faith you once had so no
[2114.16 - 2120.64] matter if you lose your faith and path
[2117.40 - 2125.92] with God it still holds true in your
[2120.64 - 2129.36] soul thank God it never forgets it never
[2125.92 - 2133.00] waivers Soul memory can Outlast
[2129.36 - 2136.68] mountains as the rain slowly erode the
[2133.00 - 2139.64] Rocks the soul still stays true long
[2136.68 - 2142.60] after the Earth decays and oceans have
[2139.64 - 2145.24] long since been blue the road isn't
[2142.60 - 2148.48] always easy for a soul in a physical
[2145.24 - 2151.80] body enduring life's ups and downs we
[2148.48 - 2155.16] step on a nail yell and shout it hurts
[2151.80 - 2158.56] so much our foot begins to swell but our
[2155.16 - 2161.68] soul stays strong throughout
[2158.56 - 2165.96] we break up with a friend it hurts the
[2161.68 - 2169.28] heart again the pain can be unbearable
[2165.96 - 2172.48] but our soul sits alongside of us and
[2169.28 - 2176.24] rises above the Betrayal and holds a
[2172.48 - 2179.92] candle to rebuild and heal while we once
[2176.24 - 2182.52] again restore trust there comes a time
[2179.92 - 2185.64] when we realize how much deeper our
[2182.52 - 2189.60] light resides and how we are so much
[2185.64 - 2192.32] more than we ever knew we are more than
[2189.60 - 2196.32] any Earthly storm we are more than the
[2192.32 - 2199.52] sun the moon and the stars Earth soul
[2196.32 - 2202.04] forever lives on long after everything
