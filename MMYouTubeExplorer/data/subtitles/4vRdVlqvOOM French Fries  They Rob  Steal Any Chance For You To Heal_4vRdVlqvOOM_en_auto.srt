making the book yeah

447
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,160
pays for all the everything to go to

448
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,440
actually printing the book

449
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,399
when you buy it off of something but get

450
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,279
it free at the library the free library

451
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,240
um i'm making the the problem is with

452
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,920
with like

453
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
like coffee and all the different

454
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,360
caffeines you got is a psychoactive

455
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,920
drug gotta keep that in mind right and

456
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,560
i know it takes the innocence out of it

457
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,759
i know

458
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
chocolate is so innocent in so many ways

459
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,000
right

460
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,000
it takes the innocence out of that but

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,360
chocolate's got the caffeine in there so

462
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,639
it's a psychoactive drug

463
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,600
and if you're gonna heal if you want to

464
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,639
heal it will get in the way that's all

465
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,360
it maybe not one time here and there but

466
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,759
it will

467
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,920
get in the way and there's no holding

468
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,120
back because that addiction is strong

469
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,480
right that's why everybody's on their

470
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,759
chocolate every week they're on their

471
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,800
chocolate smoothies they're throwing

472
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,079
chocolate and everything right on

473
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
tick-tock you guys

474
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,440
chocolates in everything yeah i saw

475
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,120
matcha yeah matcha the same thing the

476
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,560
caffeine right

477
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,920
and what happens is like the whole

478
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,639
osteopenia thing that's from all that

479
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,680
caffeine

480
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,519
osteopenia osteoporosis the caffeine

481
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,240
takes you down that road

482
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,959
right so look i could hold a blind eye

483
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
to it all

484
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
i could sit back pretend it's not

485
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,480
happening we can do that

486
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,399
we can sit back we can pretend it's not

487
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,680
happening we can pretend

488
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,199
nothing's happening how about that

489
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,839
nothing's happening you guys how about

490
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,199
that

491
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,880
right how's that sound does that sound

492
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,360
good wanna do that

493
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,399
when uh people say raw chocolate is good

494
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,600
but like you said

495
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,320
it's all bad well that's how it is

496
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,920
you know the drug dealers they'll say

497
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
they'll say chocolate's good

498
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,399
the drug dealers yeah because in the end

499
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,600
that's what it is it's a psychoactive

500
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,800
drug right

501
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,880
so it's really addicting and

502
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,480
lorraine else said chocolate is so hard

503
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,600
to let go

516
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,880
what happens is they train us to become

517
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,880
high chasers you guys on tick tock

518
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,000
they train us to become high chasers

519
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,679

high that's what it is

523
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,080
we become high chasers and they teach us

524
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,559
that young and then the alternate

525
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,520
movement takes it on

526
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,280
because they're drug dealers too and you

527
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,760
know but look look

528
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,640

you know like the industry tries to

534
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
basically trick out

535
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,679
trick out everybody and they put hits

536
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
out there to try to stop celery juice

537
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,400

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
medium's been censored it's censored

562
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,799
everywhere

563
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,760
just everywhere you can't even put you

564
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,760
can't even put um

565
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,679
you can't even post medical mediums

566
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,160
sometimes and they just do

567
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,280
they censor it right don't show it to

568
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,480
everybody

569
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,880
but that's a whole thing you know

570
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,200
but if you're in the other club you're

571
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,480
fine the other club is

572
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,360
just go with the business like

573
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,080
it is but that's not having the person's

574
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,760
back

575
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,360
now you could be look you want to put

576
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,799
cacao powder in your smoothie i still

577
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,960

gonna have that addiction

580
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,080
so i still realize you're gonna have

581
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,120
that addiction right

582
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,880
so i do realize that but

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,000
live on everything youtube

593
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,960

now so it's really fun

595
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,200
so the bottom line is you guys do i have

596
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
your back or do i give up do i have your

597
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,039
back or do i just

598
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
sit back and just just worry about

599
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,799
myself

600
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,880
do you want me to do that now i could

601
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,000
worry about myself 24 7.

602
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,600
i could get into myself 24 7. just what

603
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,600
what is what does aw

604
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,840
need to do let's do aws life the whole

605
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,600
thing and all that stuff and

606
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,679
but you know that's just not that's not

607
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,640
good it's like i got to make sure

608
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,159
i got you back in a whole bit um look if

609
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,480
you're on facebook and you got booted

610
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,840
off

611
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,520
i should have said this earlier you can

612
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,880
go to tick tock you can go to youtube

613
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,799
you can just watch me on youtube right

614
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,480
now which is great because you

615
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,240
you get an awesome view on youtube right

616
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,919
here too you guys

617
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,679
so the bottom line is that's a pretty

618
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,360
harsh thing for me to say

619
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,720
right they rob and steal any chance for

620
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,120
you to heal

621
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,360
even if they don't know what they do

622
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,919
even if they do not know what they do

623
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,159
right you know not what they do right

624
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,360
even if that's a situation

625
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,960
but the bottom line is how

626
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,320
can i protect everyone the best they can

627
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,919
right and at the same time

628
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,320
you guys learn how to protect yourselves

629
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,000
so you become your health expert like

630
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,240
that's what it's always been about

631
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,760
you becoming a health expert your own

632
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
health expert

633
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,840
right so that's the key you're back good

634
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,000
to see you back okay good i'm glad

635
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,280
you're coming back amazing

636
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,120
amazing so the bottom line you guys

637
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,400
is this all right and um

638
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,000
we live in a place where it is like

639
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,919
been thinking about the matrix a lot

640
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,799
right and it's just a fun fun thing to

641
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,320
think about

642
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,320
a lot of people really they're they're

643
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,280
they really believe in that matrix right

644
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,559
a lot of people do

645
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,840
right and it's a pretty cool concept

646
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,880
it's a pretty cool theory but there

647
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,000
kind of really is a matrix going around

648
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,159
in the world of health there really is

649
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,120
and it's this place where there's so

650
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,039
many things

651
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,799
holding us back in it that we don't

652
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,400
realize that are happening

653
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,400
and then we get brainwashed in the

654
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,559
process right the protein deal

655
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,720
that brainwashed us that that totally

656
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,000
gave us the big brainwash in 1933. i

657
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,919
talked about that you guys

658
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,280
where it was to convince everybody that

659
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,880
protein means

660
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,760
everything it just means everything okay

661
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,159
and that that's been ingrained ingrained

662
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,919
in our psyche that's a big brainwashed

663
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,280
out alone all on its own

664
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,080
right and so it's like a mob is what it

665
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,240
is

666
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,480
and then science of research they're

667
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,880
part of that mob because they're a paid

668
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,760
for

669
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,440
mob in health right and they confuse us

670
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,720
because it's like this it's like

671
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,240
two plus two equals four jet fuel is

672
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,720
comprised of

673
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,159
this code it's pro it's comprised of

674
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,520
this math

675
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,840
you know it's it jet fuel is fossil fuel

676
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,280
you know what they do is they actually

677
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,440
synthesize it they actually

678
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,600
work it right they have all the science

679
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,400
so that so that literally you can have a

680
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,520
jet fly

681
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,440
right and there's all that but then so

682
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,919
we think well science knows everything

683
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,520
see that jet fly across the sky right

684
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,640
look i can call my friend right now on

685
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,039
my phone whatever

686
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,640
that's science science has it all down

687
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,760
and so we're convinced

688
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,919
that science has it all down in

689
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,919
in health especially with the surgeries

690
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,679
you need a heart valve replacement right

691
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,159
we can do it now

692
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,679
we can do it and that's what's

693
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,240
incredible out there right

694
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,600
so we can we get convinced that science

695
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,120
has it all down

696
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,679
but when it comes down to chronic

697
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,679
illness it's far from the truth

698
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:37,200
and then that leads us into like a whole

699
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,720
you know chasing chasing chasing highs

700
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,960
chasing uh dreams chasing everything

701
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,039
we're chasing those science and research

702
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,640
smoke and mirrors the smoke and the

703
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,240
mirrors we're in this one mirror room

704
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,760
and then one smoke room in one mirror

705
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,760
room and that's what we're chasing

706
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,799
but the bottom line is how can we

707
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,880
protect you guys

708
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,840
how can we give you guys answers so you

709
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,760
know why you're sick

710
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,360
and how can we give you the tools and

711
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,480
what to avoid when you think about it

712
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,600
that's everything

713
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,880
that's everything i'm gonna start making

714
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,000
some fries and we're gonna talk about

715
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,279
some cool stuff

716
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
we're live on youtube facebook clubhouse

717
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,720
and tick tock i'm going to put this down

718
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,320
for a second

719
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,520
so um i have steamed potatoes i'm taking

720
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,880
them out right now i'm going to cut some

721
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,320
fries i'm going to get them in the oven

722
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,760
and we're gonna make the ketchup

723
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,799
how about that so

724
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,559
i got some potatoes over here springing

725
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,039
them over

726
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,960
so these are steamed potatoes you can do

727
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,360
this without them being steamed but you

728
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,919
gotta

729
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,039
you know you gotta keep the lower heat

730
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,279
on the oven

731
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,799
so you're really baking the potato fries

732
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
right but i like them steamed so i could

733
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,919
put them in have the oven hot

734
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,000
make the fries really good aw thanks uh

735
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,679
savita says aw i am so grateful

736
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,440
for giving me my life back your

737
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,559
information saved me i mean that's what

738
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,080
matters

739
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:57,039
never heard that ever ever heard that

740
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,799
in the other in the other uh parts of

741
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,360
the alternative medicine world by the

742
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,039
way

743
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,919
years gone by if one practitioner

744
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,880
back in the 2000s early 2000s one

745
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,159
practitioner got

746
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,799
one person better it was a miracle

747
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,400
they'd be

748
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,919
heralded as like a god that's what

749
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,760
happened back then right

750
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,679
now we're in a place where you know

751
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,400
we've learned about so much information

752
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,320
now for medical medium it's spread out

753
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,400
so people are healing a little bit more

754
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,480
like why to stay away from gluten it's

755
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
35 years of mm work

756
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,679
why to stay away from this back in the

757
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,960
old days of the health movement it was

758
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,480
just about stay away from processed

759
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,240

was all about

765
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,640
back in the old day in alternative

766
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,880
medicine

767
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,480
it was all about just stay away from

768
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,520
processed foods

769
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:58,400
that's all boxed foods boxed cereals

770
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,679
sugar cereals right it was all about

771
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,720
stay away from

772
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,640
all that it was there was

773
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,559
nothing else nothing else in the health

774
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,880
scene nothing else

775
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,080
that's all it was i mean think about how

776
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,840
incredible that is right

777
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,200
it was just about that um

778
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,640
so i'm making some fries right here

779
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,600
and there are thousands of healing

780
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,200
stories

781
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,120
with the medical medium information

782
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
someone's gonna say of course well aw

783
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,559
you're you're gonna be tooting your own

784
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,320
horn about

785
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,840
medical medium information why wouldn't

786
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,880
you because you're a medical medium it's

787
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,200
like

788
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,400
i'm not tooting my horn i'm tooting the

789
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,760
horn of spirit of compassion because the

790
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,919
information came from spirit of

791
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,400
compassion so what i'm doing is i'm i'm

792
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,159
just

793
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,000
i'm happy it's been working all these

794
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,039
years

795
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,400
so that's what it is you know i'm happy

796
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,840
it's been working all these years so i

797
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,840
got some fries going on here

798
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,679
um

799
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,799
so what you do is you take the potato

800
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,480
and

801
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,159
these are still hot so they're a little

802
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,480
sticky right

803
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,840
take the potato and you can do it a

804
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,320
couple different ways you can do it like

805
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,600
this

806
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,600
just cutting these fries like that

807
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,000
these are a little bit more of the steak

808
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,520
fries and then you can cut the other

809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,720
fries where they're not steak fries so

810
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,960
that's like a steak fry

811
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,159
a lot of people like those better that's

812
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,000
what i've noticed over the years they

813
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,279
like the steak fries right

814
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,440
you know it's kind of like there's

815
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,960
there's more meat to them so that's what

816
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,840
people like i'm just putting them on

817
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
on the pan right here

818
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
so i'm just dropping these on the pan as

819
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,640
you guys can see on tick tock that's

820
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,159
what i'm doing clubhouse that's what i'm

821
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,360
doing

822
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:52,159
and we got some good stuff to talk about

823
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,720
so what have you been taught to do

824
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,440
throughout the years you guys

825
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,799
you've been taught to do the bone broth

826
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,799
which has the vinegar in it

827
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,880
i call the bone broth the fat broth

828
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,360
that's what it is

829
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:13,039
it's the fat broth and

830
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,159
that's a hard one it's it's it's hard to

831
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,039
heal

832
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,120
when you're doing the bone broth because

833
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,679
that pancreas and that liver of yours

834
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,440
is under so much stress when you're

835
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,840
doing bone broth

836
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,840
you know and but yeah you'll you know

837
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,679
people like oh this is how people

838
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,240
you know can get better it's like oh it

839
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,640
is it it's not

840
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,240
it's not the thing is with bone broth is

841
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,039
if you're choosing not to eat anything

842
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,760
else and you're just doing bone broth

843
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,960
you're you're now basically doing a mono

844
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,880
diet for the moment

845
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,279
and yeah you might see some benefits in

846
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,520
the moment but in the end it's not

847
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,919
the way to go because you'll see more

848
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,520
fallbacks over time

849
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,320
the whole vinegar thing in the bone

850
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,039
broth is really really not a good idea

851
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,279
too

852
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,760
vinegar is is such a health destroyer

853
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,039
and the reason why some people feel like

854
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:10,080
they get a boost from bone broth

855
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,399
is because of the steroids involved

856
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,159
so you get faked out so a lot of

857
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,640
alternative medicine

858
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,000
is a fake out just so you know so i'm

859
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
putting some fries on this

860
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,440
on this sheet here a lot of alternative

861
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,840
medicine is a fake out

862
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:31,120
so what happens is that when the cow

863
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,200
is gone to slaughter right

864
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,120
doesn't matter if you say well no our

865
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,000
practices of how we kill our cows is

866
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,120
different

867
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,039
we don't terrify the cows we don't

868
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,799
we don't walk them through that moment

869
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,840
of death this isn't an anti-animal

870
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,480
protein campaign

871
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,240
i'm i i support animal protein people

872
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,840
and i support plant-based people so i

873
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,279
just need that disclaimer out front

874
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,279
right now for you guys

875
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,360
so it's just important to know but i get

876
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:59,279
it there's there's practices

877
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,600
where we we don't walk the cow corral it

878
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,840
to the to the you know slaughterhouse

879
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,399
right and the cows are all freaking out

880
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,000
right we we have practices it's like

881
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,520
nice cow we're petting the cow or

882
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,120
petting the cow and then we hit the cow

883
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,520
on the back of the head

884
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,640
okay so we got these practices where

885
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,320
it's more humane

886
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,640
right i've heard that from a lot of

887
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,080
different um from a lot of different

888
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,320
industries with it all right

889
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,240
but the deal is is with that is no

890
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,080
matter what the adrenals still

891
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,760
explode so when you kill the cow

892
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,279
the cow's adrenals explode so the whole

893
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,360
all the information of the cow's

894
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,000
adrenals draining

895
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,559
all that all that epinephrine into the

896
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,080
body

897
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,000
this medical medium information

898
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,880
originally i taught that for years and

899
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,399
years

900
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,520
right and where that adrenaline goes i

901
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,200
mean we're talking about

902
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:54,480
huge adrenals cal adrenals are huge

903
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,320
where that adrenaline goes is inside the

904
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,440
bones not just inside the meat

905
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,559
inside the bones okay

906
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,120
so when you're doing the bone broth

907
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,640
a big part of that adrenaline surge goes

908
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,039
inside the bones

909
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,360
more so than even the meat okay

910
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,679
and so when you're doing your bone broth

911
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,240
you're getting a steroid high

912
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,519
we're high chasing again we're high

913
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,919
chasing again

914
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,360
and high chasing is an important

915
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,200
understanding

916
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,799
because they rob and steal any chance

917
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,120
for you to heal

918
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,559
and puts you on a high chase on top of

919
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,559
it

920
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,840
so now you're having your bone broth you

921
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,679
look at this bone broth it's good this

922
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,720
bone broth is good i'm having it i'm

923
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,279
having it

924
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,519
and you're getting this steroidal effect

925
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,600
the steroid high is what you're getting

926
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,679
that's how it works

927
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,679
and no one's gonna know that

928
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,440
no one's gonna know that chris linnell

929
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,039
went to a health practitioner

930
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,080

933
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,159
protocols

936
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,039
day

937
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,080
thank you for giving me my life back

938
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,799

939
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,760
you are doing chris i'm honored thank

940
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,679
you for being here

941
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,080
and i can't tell you how happy that

942
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,080
makes me

943
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,360

944
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,799

i mean doesn't that matter does that

946
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,080
matter you guys does it

947
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,039
because the industry that robs and

948
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,720
steals any chance for you to heal

949
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,640
doesn't care if you get your life back

950
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,679
because guess what you rely

951
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,240
less on the industry you rely

952
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,159
less on the industry is what happens

953
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,760
health with liz

954
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,519
good to see you see you on tick tock

955
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,559
right now because

956
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,600
i think you got booted off of

957
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,080
put it off of facebook do your books

958
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,120
address

959
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,440
balancing female hormones

960
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,200
yeah they do because what happens is if

961
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,120
you don't get your adrenal strong

962
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,640
like medical medium adrenal snacks right

963
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,320
all that information there

964
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,480
if you don't get your adrenal strong how

965
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,600
are you ever going to balance your

966
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,760
your hormones how's it gonna be possible

967
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,360
you can't balance female female hormones

968
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,960
unless your adrenals are up to par you

969
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,440
know why because once you lose that

970
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,480
hormone blend in your adrenals

971
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,480
your hair falls out as a woman and

972
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,679
caffeine is a big part of that a big

973
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,200
part of that one

974
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,919
big part of that and so

975
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,679
if you don't if you don't address your

976
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,440
adrenals

977
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,039
then your reproductive hormones that's

978
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,360
part of your reproductive hormones

979
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,760
your estrogen it's your adrenals

980
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,480
so um yeah i addressed that in medical

981
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,919
medium

982
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,600
new addition and cleanse the heal

983
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,760
so that's fun to heal right there it's a

984
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,960
new addition okay that's cleansed appeal

985
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,360
and that's the new addition to medical

986
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,360
medium

987
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,360
if so what happens is you're having your

988
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,440
bone broth someone recommended it

989
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,000
practitioner recommended it right you

990
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,359
got your bone broth going

991
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,359
you're noticing you're getting a boost

992
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,119
that boost

993
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,560
is because you're getting a steroid high

994
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,599
you're getting a big boost of

995
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,240
epinephrine okay

996
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,720
and it can actually even numb out some

997
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,800
pain

998
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,760
temporarily for the moment and then it

999
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,679
comes back

1000
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,639
but like any addiction because then you

1001
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,079
get addicted to the cow's epinephrine

1002
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,240
you get addicted to the cow's

1003
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,560
epinephrine think about that

1004
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,079
and now you're on this up and down thing

1005
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,919
once again high chasing

1006
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,520
just like coffee up you're up you're

1007
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,119
down you're up you're down

1008
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,639
matcha tea you're up you're down green

1009
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,760
tea you're up you're down

1010
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,960
right you're up you're down that's how

1011
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,119
it works chocolate you're up and down

1012
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,000
you're up and down you're up and down

1013
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,119
okay but what happens is you're doing

1014
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,079
the bone broth

1015
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,599
and you're up you're down you're up

1016
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,599
you're down

1017
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,880
and all of this stuff robs your adrenals

1018
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,000
eventually because you're up you're down

1019
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,200
you're up and down

1020
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,800
we're taught to high chase with

1021
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,920
everything which constantly it's high

1022
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,720
chasing

1023
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,000
right and then the fat high chasing is

1024
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,040

we didn't think it was food poisoning

1338
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,680
because nobody else got it at the table

1339
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,920

my doctor said he needed the antibiotic

1343
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,559
anyway because my microbiome was off and

1344
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,440
then he gave me a gut powder

1345
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,160
and some and some probiotic it's medical

1346
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,480

1347
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,240

science that says tomato causes leaky

1538
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,240

okay it's a really good question okay

1542
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,359
but

1543
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:21,280
um there's there's science that actually

1544
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,640
can see a tomato go in your body

1545
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,359
sit inside your intestinal tract and

1546
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,160
cause leaky gut do you know a leaky gut

1547
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:29,040
is

1548
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,079
leaky gut is actually a real per like a

1549
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,040
perforation a

1550
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,079
real poke in your gut where there's a

1551
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,440
hole through it

1552
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,680
and then when you have a hole through it

1553
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:42,720
guess where you end up you end up in

1554
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:45,839
icu with 105 temperature with sepsis

1555
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,040
so the leaky gut theory was all wrong to

1556
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,040
begin with

1557
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,640
that was the whole thing no one knew why

1558
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,559

children what's going on chode is

1785
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,359
amazing um

1786
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,160
the problem is that they take bits and

1787
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,960
pieces

1788
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,640
and then twist it into other things so

1789
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,000
really people aren't getting the truth

1790
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,039
and here's what's interesting to you but

1791
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,720
at the same time

1792
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,720
people are getting they're being

1793
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,240
sustained with their sickness because

1794
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,880
they're using medical media bits and

1795
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,559
pieces

1796
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,920
so they're getting they are getting up

1797
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:10,160
ticks say

1798
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,760
but yet yeah they're getting up ticks

1799
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,160
and if they're not really sick they get

1800
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,839
a big

1801
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,200
uptick using a medical medium piece of

1802
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:17,520
information right

1803
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,400
but then the rest isn't there in case

1804
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,400
someone's

1805
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,160
you know sicker and they can't make it

1806
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,599
all the way right

1807
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,920
i don't know if that made sense i was

1808
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:29,039
trying to make sense on that

1809
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,559
but we're live you know we're live

1810
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,079

that

1818
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,799
and it goes back for many years i was

1819
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,640
working so hard teaching so many

1820
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:01,119
practitioners and doctors

1821
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,559
uh about health and patients that became

1822
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,720
doctors that they started working on

1823
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,640
their platforms before mine

1824
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,319
um out there too and they started

1825
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,839
writing books before i got a chance to

1826
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:12,319
put the books out so

1827
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,760
little tidbits got out escaped every now

1828
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:17,200
and then like that too

1829
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,200

1830
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,599
a decent amount actually so i'm going to

1833
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,839
causing leaky gut that's really a sad

1834
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:33,839
misconception a tomato can't cause

1835
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:37,280
a leaky gut doctors don't even know what

1836
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,280

01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,560
cucumber too

1926
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,080
i get it everybody's eating their fats

1927
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,319
right it's not that you can't have a

1928
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,319
little avocado or some sesame tahini and

1929
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:29,040
stuff it's just that we're taught to

1930
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,040
do both animal protein and plant fats

1931
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,319
animal fat and plant fat every single

1932
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,640
day and if we're plant

1933
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:36,480
based we're taught to just pound the

1934
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,359
plant fats and fat ourselves to death

1935
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,880
and if we're

1936
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,920
and if we're animal protein we're taught

1937
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,920
the same thing right

1938
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,040
problem is with tomato sauces is you

1939
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,920
know you're on a pizza

1940
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,640
you got all that oil in the tomato sauce

1941
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,319
right

1942
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,839
then you're out or that pasta with the

1943
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,239
cheesy pasta

1944
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:59,839
you got all the gluten from the bread

1945
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,600
and the pasta and everything so that's a

1946
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:03,759
whole nother thing all on its own right

1947
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:07,839

1948
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:07,839

right okay

1953
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,920

1954
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:28,480

01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,480
so you guys i just want to talk about

1981
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,320
the blood draw for a couple seconds

1982
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,760
it's important because i keep on seeing

1983
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,080

1984
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,920

01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,719
everything so that's something to really

1991
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,239
to really um keep in mind i'm going to

1992
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,600
put the ketchup in this little cup right

1993
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:52,800
here

1994
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,800
to get ready for the fries

1995
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,600
learn how to protect yourself with the

1996
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,000
blood draws

1997
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,280
i can't tell you how i you guys know

1998
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,400
i've talked about this before and i

1999
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,040
don't want to

2000
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,880
to bore you guys on this but women are

2001
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,040
the blood donors

2002
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,360
sick women they've been brainwashed and

2003
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:13,120
taught to donate blood

2004
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,360
just so you know so that that's who

2005
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,600
donates blood it's women that are sick

2006
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,560
struggling women that their health isn't

2007
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,800
good

2008
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,560
and that's who's that's who is taught to

2009
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,199
donate all the blood right

2010
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,120
not strong men that aren't sick not even

2011
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:29,040
strong women that aren't sick

2012
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,480

2013
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,679

2014
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,159
strong men that donate blood there's

01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,440
some

2016
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,040
there's strong women that donate blood

2017
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,080
but sick women are the ones that are

2018
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,679
actually taught

2019
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,360
they're being brainwashed to donate

2020
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:41,600
blood and i'm not against

2021
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,640

on here say that's not true

2033
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,440
so i've had lab technicians on here

2034
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,880
already that all

2035
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,120
like the last couple of months and

2036
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,960
that's not true i talked to doctors that

2037
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,040
know about the stuff that's not true

2038
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,880
um yeah they only need it they only need

2039
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,640
a dot a dot of blood

2040
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,400
and they they they only need a quarter

2041
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,120
vial really if they want to play around

2042
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,600
with anything

2043
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,120
with it quarter vial each vial right not

2044
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,679
full vials they don't need

2045
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,800
80 milliliters 70 milliliters 140

2046
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,400
milliliters

2047
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,000
they don't need all that it's just what

2048
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,760
it is it's not that your sister's

2049
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,520
wrong it's your sister's misinformed

2050
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,040
that's what it is so your sister's a

2051
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,320
phlebotomist but she's a phlebotomist

2052
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,920
that's not been given the correct

2053
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,440
information that's all

2054
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:50,000
it's not that she's she's right for

2055
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,840
the misinformation she has she's right

2056
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,440
about the misinformation she just

2057
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,080
doesn't know it's misinformation

2058
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,520
the system's broken and what they're

2059
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,000
doing is

2060
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,199
they're vamping women kind right now

2061
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,880
that's what they're doing

2062
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,320
women are the ones that get the blood

2063
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,440
tests every day

2064
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,280

regular blood work you know all of that

2081
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,480
right so what it is is the system

2082
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:44,320
vamps women kind i really believe

2083
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:47,040
from information that i've

2084
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,560
heard from powerful people in the world

2085
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,920
and information from spirit of

2086
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:53,679
compassion

2087
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,840
that there is there is a dirty dirty

2088
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:59,520
dirty dirty dirty dirty

2089
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:02,480
system around bleeding women to death

2090
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,560
to a slow death there is a dirty system

2091
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,719
set up on that just letting you know

2092
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,920
it and it's not the doctors doing it the

2093
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,239
doctor isn't doing it

2094
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,679
so and it's about literally draining

2095
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:15,600
women

2096
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:17,840
of their of this precious resource

2097
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,679
in draining sick women of this precious

2098
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,239
resource the system's not just broken

2099
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,400
it's it's

2100
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:24,000
it's it's yeah courtney it's scary so

scary and

2102
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,760
that's how it's designed right so that's

2103
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,719
one of the ways

2104
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:33,280
there's there there is a movement out

2105
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:35,679
there that people don't realize

2106
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,320

thank you for being here um

2112
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:53,199
and but but there is there is a

2113
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,400
scary thing happening that's doing this

2114
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:57,280
for women in their

2115
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,880
and and robbing their doing this to

2116
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,120
women and robbing their blood

2117
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,640
the blood supply knocking down their

2118
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:05,760
immune systems

2119
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:08,080
experimenting with their blood okay

2120
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,880
all of this this is a precious resource

2121
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,520
and it's not

2122
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,000
tree it's treated like trash your blood

2123
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,239
is just

2124
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,560
trash and then one of the brainwashing

2125
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:19,520
techniques that's happening out there

2126
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:21,440
is you you should do this you should

2127
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,920
donate your blood or

2128
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,960
you should get your get your blood draws

2129
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,960
because you're just you're

2130
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,960
you're getting rid of old blood and then

2131
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,360
fresh blood

2132
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:33,199
fresh blood is like clean it comes out

2133
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,800
clean and your body produces fresh blood

2134
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:37,120
that's not how it works

2135
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,159
that's not how it works that's a trick

2136
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,400
so there it's a

2137
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:42,320
bloodletting trick too i'm not saying

2138
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,800
don't donate blood we need we do need

2139
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,440
donations for blood but they don't use

2140
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,679
all

2141
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:49,040
the amount of people donating blood and

2142
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:51,280
the fact that

2143
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,640
they only need a fraction of that in

2144
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,440
hospitals

2145
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,719
where does all the rest of it go just

2146
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,000
pretend they throw it all away then

2147
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,280
they're throwing away millions of

2148
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,360
gallons of women's blood

2149
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:03,280
millions of gallons are thrown away

2150
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,080
michael says too many red blood cells

2151
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,440
have to get

2152
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,280
well that's the technique instead of

2153
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,640
knowing what's wrong with the person

2154
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,239
instead of knowing how to fix them

2155
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,760
instead of knowing why too many red

2156
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,400
blood cells is a viral condition but

2157
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,159
they don't want to

2158
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,600
do any science research studies on that

2159
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,800
and figure out how to fix it

2160
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,880
so they're just still yeah they just

2161
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,760
want to take your blood so it's done

2162
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,520
to get these fries out you guys make a

2163
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:35,840
little room for them too

2164
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:35,840

2167
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,440

2182
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,920

01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,440
a kid i could handle intense heat with

2184
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,480
my hands

2185
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:25,440

2186
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,640

someone else they'd be

2192
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,400
they'd be like crying probably so just

2193
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,040
don't do that

2194
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,880
and i've been known in my family since i

2195
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:46,320
was a kid

2196
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:48,480
that my hands can handle the heat

2197
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:51,120
big time just let you guys know that's

2198
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:54,320
something in my family that's well known

2199
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:57,440

01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,920
don't these look good or no right and

2211
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,600

01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,440
the salad with it and then you got the

2213
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,760
ketchup right here

2214
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,040

vimergy

2263
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,600
m sky when you steam first and then bake

01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,679

okay i'm not sponsored but v is victor i

2271
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,760
m

e r g y dot com their supplements are

2273
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,960
unmatched

2274
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,639
austin knows i think austin uses bemidji

2275
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:38,000
from what i remember

2276
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:39,920
um and so the books have

2277
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,679
supplements protocols if anybody ever

2278
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,080
wanted to venture into supplementation

2279
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:46,480
and protocols to learn how to heal

2280
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,840
i mean the information is there i just

2281
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:50,000
don't talk about

2282
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,400
you know everything else i talk about

2283
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,600
everything else that's the whole point

2284
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,120
so anyway magnesium is important

2285
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,400
so many people need magnesium it's

2286
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:03,040
ridiculous it's so critical

2287
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:04,960
they rob and steal any chance for you

2288
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:07,600
guys to heal

2289
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,320
that's what they do and keep that in

2290
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,000
mind

2291
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:12,080
the industries including the alternative

2292
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,679
industries that's what they do

2293
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,719
it's sad but true it's a big club out

2294
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:20,000
there

2295
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:23,120
they all mirror the same old

2296
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,120
and that's how they do it

2297
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,400
and then they secretly drink celery

2298
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:29,679
juice

2299
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:32,960
