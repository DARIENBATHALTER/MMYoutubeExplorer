[15.36 - 20.24] with its virus bacteria different
[18.08 - 22.96] pathogens we all walk around
[20.24 - 24.72] what happens in alternative medicine in
[22.96 - 28.56] conventional medicine
[24.72 - 31.20] people got sick went to their doctors
[28.56 - 32.08] and no one knew what was wrong with them

[234.16 - 238.56] it makes a difference it really does and
[237.04 - 239.60] celery juice also keeps people out of
[238.56 - 241.52] trouble too
[239.60 - 242.72] unless they're doing death by a thousand
[241.52 - 245.60] cuts too much
[242.72 - 246.24] and then they're doing like everything
[245.60 - 248.48] wrong
[246.24 - 250.32] and anything wrong they're reading
[248.48 - 252.32] really bad
[250.32 - 253.52] they're picking up new bugs left and
[252.32 - 256.40] right
[253.52 - 257.84] they're doing new medical treatments all
[256.40 - 259.76] kinds they're getting blood draws
[257.84 - 261.12] extensive blood draws the blood testing
[259.76 - 262.80] all the time so they're removing their
[261.12 - 263.68] immune system out of the person all the
[262.80 - 265.92] time
[263.68 - 267.92] and then and then the celery juice might
[265.92 - 268.96] not be enough because it's death by a
[267.92 - 270.40] thousand cuts
[268.96 - 272.40] so your celery juice is trying to
[270.40 - 273.84] sustain you it's trying to keep you okay
[272.40 - 275.52] it's trying to keep you hanging in there
[273.84 - 276.00] while you keep on doing all the wrong
[276.00 - 278.88] and all of a sudden you're doing now
[277.20 - 280.16] another blood draw because your doctor
[278.88 - 282.40] wants 20 more
[280.16 - 283.92] vials taken out of you and 10 more vials
[282.40 - 286.16] taken out of you
[283.92 - 287.12] and then you're doing now you're doing
[286.16 - 288.88] the wrong foods
[287.12 - 290.56] now you got the wrong supplements and
[288.88 - 292.08] there's citric acid and alcohol in them
[290.56 - 294.16] and natural flavors and msg
[292.08 - 295.60] and you're doing all these things and
[294.16 - 296.96] celery juice is trying to keep you
[295.60 - 298.32] hanging in there i've seen that with
[296.96 - 299.84] people where they're doing celery juice
[298.32 - 301.12] and it's the only thing they're doing
[299.84 - 302.88] right
[301.12 - 304.32] they're doing their sandwiches and it's
[302.88 - 307.20] the only thing they're doing right
[304.32 - 309.20] and they're doing so many things wrong
[307.20 - 311.44] that that the seller juice is like hey
[309.20 - 313.28] hey uh you better do something right
[311.44 - 315.28] because i can't do it all
[313.28 - 316.72] for you you got to do something right
[315.28 - 318.08] you're doing you know and
[316.72 - 319.76] and that's people don't realize it
[318.08 - 321.60] you're doing your caffeine you're doing
[319.76 - 323.28] your apple cider vinegar
[321.60 - 325.44] you're doing your nutritional yeast with
[323.28 - 328.16] all that msg right
[325.44 - 329.04] and celery juice is trying to keep you
[328.16 - 330.72] there
[329.04 - 332.64] and then we're doing all these other
[330.72 - 333.76] things and summer juice is like trying
[332.64 - 334.96] to keep you hanging in there i've seen
[333.76 - 335.92] that with people where they're drinking

[352.88 - 356.16] their high fat diet
[354.72 - 358.40] and the celery juice is keeping them
[356.16 - 361.60] hanging in there

[385.84 - 390.32] the wrong information
[387.44 - 391.20] just misinformation that's all i mean

[391.20 - 395.68] you know and and uh to be to be not mean
[394.64 - 397.52] or to be to be
[395.68 - 399.28] kind about it they don't have the
[397.52 - 401.60] information
[399.28 - 403.44] it's as simple as that i spent decades
[401.60 - 405.52] helping people and having people fly all
[403.44 - 406.72] around the world to my office and they
[405.52 - 409.04] went and saw
[406.72 - 410.40] lots of doctors and the doctors didn't
[409.04 - 412.16] know why someone's sick
[410.40 - 413.68] just my friend told me the other day
[412.16 - 415.12] that he was watching some conference
[413.68 - 416.80] he's a doctor and he was watching a
[415.12 - 417.36] conference with a bunch of doctors on
[416.80 - 420.00] there
[417.36 - 421.48] talking about like that they thought
[420.00 - 423.20] they were on this breakthrough with
[421.48 - 425.60] microbiome
[423.20 - 427.60] it's like what you're on some
[425.60 - 429.84] breakthrough microbiome
[427.60 - 430.72] um that's fun and all and that's cute
[429.84 - 432.24] and all but
[430.72 - 434.16] why aren't you talking about what the
[432.24 - 435.44] real problems are why people are sick
[434.16 - 436.88] it's a shingles virus in the
[435.44 - 438.40] epstein-barr virus they got their
[436.88 - 439.76] hashimoto's because of it's not they
[438.40 - 441.12] don't have their hashimoto's
[439.76 - 444.48] and hyperthyroidism because of
[441.12 - 446.00] microbiome they don't have their ra
[444.48 - 447.68] rheumatoid arthritis because they're
[446.00 - 450.00] microbiome they don't have neurological
[447.68 - 452.16] lyme because of microbiome i mean why
[450.00 - 453.28] are you do they don't have adhd because
[452.16 - 455.60] of that
[453.28 - 457.36] so it's doctors just don't know and you
[455.60 - 458.80] you know doctors they play in a lot of
[457.36 - 460.72] doctors they play in a land of
[458.80 - 462.24] if it's make-believe they don't know
[460.72 - 464.00] what's wrong with anyone
[462.24 - 466.16] so then they hear about oh microbiome's
[464.00 - 469.36] getting popular let me look research it
[466.16 - 471.52] let me do my first microbiome implant in
[469.36 - 474.88] somebody it's like okay um
[471.52 - 476.64] yeah uh let's wait 10 years for that um
[474.88 - 478.64] let's wait for 10 years for your first
[476.64 - 479.60] microbiome implant to help out your
[478.64 - 482.16] patient when
[479.60 - 483.92] jesus christ your patients suffering and
[482.16 - 486.72] suffering terribly
[483.92 - 488.40] with like real issues like all kinds of
[486.72 - 490.16] different pathogens and
[488.40 - 492.16] those pathogens are giving them the
[490.16 - 493.84] vertigo and the dizziness and tinnitus
[492.16 - 495.84] and the brain fog
[493.84 - 498.08] and the pain in the neck and pain in the
[495.84 - 499.20] back and the pain in the legs and feet
[498.08 - 500.16] and they're suffering and they're
[499.20 - 501.84] struggling
[500.16 - 504.00] and you're doing your first microbiome
[501.84 - 504.84] implant if that was that's even gonna
[504.00 - 508.24] help
[504.84 - 509.12] and it's really sad it kills me really
[508.24 - 512.00] and then make sure you
[509.12 - 514.24] blood draw the person to death make sure
[512.00 - 516.72] you take another eight vials and another
[514.24 - 518.84] 10 vials and another 12 vials and
[516.72 - 520.08] knock their immune system down more and
[518.84 - 521.28] more
[520.08 - 523.12] you know and that's what happened so
[521.28 - 524.88] look the reason we'll expect that with
[523.12 - 526.56] the fiber okay what happens is the
[524.88 - 527.84] doctors don't know when other people
[526.56 - 528.48] don't know and health professionals
[527.84 - 531.92] don't know
[528.48 - 535.04] you guys is that this is herbal medicine
[531.92 - 537.52] and this is a medical device i don't
[535.04 - 539.92] care what juicer you have this one's 20

[547.20 - 551.84] any juicer you use you guys
[549.68 - 554.00] anyone it could be the crappiest juicer
[551.84 - 556.88] out there it's a medical device
[554.00 - 558.64] it's a medical device that's what it is
[556.88 - 560.84] what you're doing
[558.64 - 562.48] is you're creating your own herbal
[560.84 - 565.68] medicine
[562.48 - 566.48] your own form of herbal medicine is what
[565.68 - 568.64] you're doing
[566.48 - 570.00] so lydius has been juicing for the past
[568.64 - 573.20] three years
[570.00 - 575.04] it has changed my wait sorry and changed
[573.20 - 578.96] my juicer to omega
[575.04 - 579.68] the 900m uh mm-900 amazing i get so much
[578.96 - 581.68] more juice
[579.68 - 582.80] and the cleanup is so much easier i tell
[581.68 - 585.60] people all the time
[582.80 - 586.80] the cleanup's easy it's not noisy you
[585.60 - 589.12] get so much more juice
[586.80 - 590.16] and it pays for itself and it pays for
[589.12 - 592.96] itself
[590.16 - 594.88] and it just does like the amount of
[592.96 - 595.92] money it has saved me with celery okay
[594.88 - 598.32] you guys
[595.92 - 599.04] has paid for the juicer over a dozen
[598.32 - 600.72] times
[599.04 - 602.16] it's like getting 12 new juicers for
[600.72 - 604.16] free over time
[602.16 - 605.28] that's what this does as far as how much
[604.16 - 606.72] it saves right
[605.28 - 610.00] so let's go back to this though i got to
[606.72 - 612.72] tell you guys this is a medical device
[610.00 - 615.60] got to keep that in mind whatever juicer
[612.72 - 619.20] you have is a medical device
[615.60 - 619.52] that's what it is the purpose is to keep
[619.20 - 624.08] you
[619.52 - 627.36] off of medical equipment
[624.08 - 629.20] it's to keep you off of medical
[627.36 - 632.32] equipment because you're
[629.20 - 634.16] sick because you're in the hospital
[632.32 - 635.44] you're sick or you're you're at home and
[634.16 - 638.72] you're sick

[654.88 - 658.40] that's what happens doctors don't know
[658.00 - 660.16] and so
[658.40 - 661.76] a lot of doctors do know now i mean they
[660.16 - 663.04] do a lot of doctors follow medical
[661.76 - 664.64] medium information
[663.04 - 666.48] they have the medical medium books
[664.64 - 667.52] they're medical medium friendly doctors
[666.48 - 669.52] for their patients
[667.52 - 670.80] because so many so many books have
[669.52 - 672.24] gotten around the world and so many
[670.80 - 674.48] patients have healed for medical medium
[672.24 - 676.00] information that the doctors they do

[676.00 - 679.84] friendly doctors right
[677.92 - 681.28] that practice medical mean information
[679.84 - 682.80] there's a lot of doctors that don't so
[681.28 - 685.84] they'll say
[682.80 - 687.04] blend up your celery in a smoothie they
[685.84 - 689.76] don't know that
[687.04 - 691.84] when you leave the fiber and you're just
[689.76 - 693.20] throwing in a couple of sticks
[691.84 - 694.72] and you're putting a couple sticks in
[693.20 - 695.44] your smoothie and you leave the fiber in
[694.72 - 698.24] there
[695.44 - 700.08] it's not enough you have to extract it
[698.24 - 704.40] they don't know this is an herb
[700.08 - 706.32] this is an herb you guys it's an herb
[704.40 - 707.92] okay it's like when you go to your
[706.32 - 710.08] natural uh
[707.92 - 711.84] professional doctor or alternate
[710.08 - 713.20] medicine doctor or now conventional
[711.84 - 715.44] medicine doctor and they give you a
[713.20 - 716.64] bottle of pills and there's some herbs

[723.52 - 729.28] this is an actual herb right here
[726.64 - 731.20] and what happens is your doctor doesn't
[729.28 - 733.52] know this is an herb
[731.20 - 736.16] they think this is a vegetable for
[733.52 - 738.24] crudite or for a little hummus
[736.16 - 739.36] that's what they think and that's how
[738.24 - 742.80] sad that is

[810.40 - 814.16] even know
[811.92 - 816.16] they think like i said it should be
[814.16 - 817.92] chopped up in little pieces and put into
[816.16 - 822.16] your tuna salad
[817.92 - 824.32] that's all sarah i healed brain fog with
[822.16 - 825.44] medical medium tools the 369 cleanse is
[824.32 - 827.44] so powerful
[825.44 - 829.04] everyone needs anthony's life-changing
[827.44 - 832.56] books i had
[829.04 - 834.72] 50 symptoms only two left and i'm on the
[832.56 - 835.28] way in healing those two incredible
[834.72 - 838.32] sarah
[835.28 - 840.00] amazing amazing amazing there are
[838.32 - 842.80] doctors out there that have a practice
[840.00 - 844.40] for years like a decade they get one
[842.80 - 847.61] patient better with one
[844.40 - 849.68] symptom and they get heralded as god
[847.61 - 852.48] [Music]
[849.68 - 854.00] one patient better in a year just a
[852.48 - 855.60] little better they put him on a keto
[854.00 - 856.40] diet they weren't that sick to begin
[855.60 - 857.92] with
[856.40 - 859.76] they had a couple of symptoms they get
[857.92 - 862.80] one symptom better now they're god
[859.76 - 864.88] because of a keto diet it's like
[862.80 - 866.56] there's the difference between like the
[864.88 - 867.12] not so sick and people who have 50
[866.56 - 869.68] symptoms
[867.12 - 871.44] sarah so you get 50 symptoms it's so so
[869.68 - 874.16] much to bear right
[871.44 - 875.28] that you've been through and there's a
[874.16 - 878.08] difference there
[875.28 - 879.04] between having a lot of symptoms and not
[878.08 - 880.24] being sick
[879.04 - 883.12] and then cleaning up your diet and
[880.24 - 884.64] exercising big difference
[883.12 - 886.80] big difference and that's when the
[884.64 - 888.56] celery juice matters so you'll see the
[886.80 - 890.16] people who rank on celery juice and
[888.56 - 892.48] stuff you guys
[890.16 - 893.68] they're people that have never been sick
[892.48 - 895.36] they don't know what it's like when that
[893.68 - 897.28] needle won't move no matter what powder
[895.36 - 898.96] or what probiotic you're trying or what
[897.28 - 899.76] fish oil you're trying or what charcoal
[898.96 - 902.00] powder
[899.76 - 903.84] or what whatever whey protein powder
[902.00 - 905.28] when you when the needle won't move they
[903.84 - 907.04] don't understand that because they've
[905.28 - 907.84] never been sick yet they haven't gotten
[907.04 - 909.44] there yet
[907.84 - 910.80] they haven't gotten the pathogens yet
[909.44 - 912.00] and they haven't got enough toxic heavy
[910.80 - 915.20] metals so when they do they go
[912.00 - 918.56] more down and then
[915.20 - 921.04] that's what moves the needle
[918.56 - 922.72] mary fox says so focused on my digestive
[921.04 - 926.80] issues i didn't even realize
[922.72 - 928.16] i'd lost my eye floaters amazing
[926.80 - 929.44] one thing that happens when you start
[928.16 - 930.96] taking care of yourself and you start
[929.44 - 932.32] doing the right things and celery juice
[930.96 - 933.12] is one of them you start getting rid of
[932.32 - 934.64] symptoms
[933.12 - 937.36] some symptoms you weren't even like
[934.64 - 940.72] getting like weren't even thinking about
[937.36 - 942.48] or got so used to having right
[940.72 - 943.92] guys if you just came on here there's a

[974.80 - 980.88] so hey i got this under here
[979.12 - 984.16] one time i did it wasn't even there and
[980.88 - 984.16] it was just pouring out
[985.28 - 993.76] that's why we're live so
[989.68 - 996.40] this is a medical device
[993.76 - 997.68] helping to prevent you from being on
[996.40 - 1001.04] medical
[997.68 - 1005.92] equipment in a hospital
[1001.04 - 1009.36] or somewhere else what you'll notice
[1005.92 - 1011.68] is there aren't metal gears here
[1009.36 - 1013.60] there aren't metal gears in here there's
[1011.68 - 1017.12] not metal gears
[1013.60 - 1020.40] okay i
[1017.12 - 1024.00] don't like juicers with metal
[1020.40 - 1026.88] gears bump grinding and rubbing
[1024.00 - 1029.28] against each other that is a nightmare
[1026.88 - 1029.28] for me
[1029.44 - 1035.92] because metal on metal wears
[1032.56 - 1035.92] you don't see it wear
[1036.24 - 1041.36] but it does and that metal wears out and
[1039.44 - 1041.92] and so here you are juicing your celery
[1041.36 - 1043.76] and you got
[1041.92 - 1045.12] metal on metal in here and you're just
[1043.76 - 1046.96] getting little tiny bits of metal you
[1045.12 - 1050.08] can't see
[1046.96 - 1052.24] so i don't like it's really
[1050.08 - 1053.68] annoying when someone's like hey there's
[1052.24 - 1056.80] this other brand of juicer
[1053.68 - 1060.64] it's so great top of the line
[1056.80 - 1062.00] oh really yeah yeah it's masticating the
[1060.64 - 1066.48] whole bit oh really
[1062.00 - 1068.08] it's got the metal gears huh okay great
[1066.48 - 1070.08] not great terribly
[1068.08 - 1072.16] [Music]
[1070.08 - 1073.12] debbie rhodes says a mega juicer saves
[1072.16 - 1075.44] you money
[1073.12 - 1077.04] and energy it's so smooth and easy isn't

[1103.12 - 1107.28] i'm juicing celery today i'm going to
[1105.76 - 1108.80] give us a little reminder about the
[1107.28 - 1111.76] celery juicer is because
[1108.80 - 1112.80] do you have a juicer it's part of the
[1111.76 - 1115.20] medical medium
[1112.80 - 1116.00] heavy metal detox cleanse because it's
[1115.20 - 1119.52] not just
[1116.00 - 1123.84] the the smoothie it's also the the
[1119.52 - 1123.84] celery juice is part of that cleanse
[1124.19 - 1128.64] [Applause]
[1125.68 - 1131.12] heavy metal rock and roll cleanse you

[1131.44 - 1134.48] so right now what i'm doing is what you
[1133.92 - 1138.40] see is
[1134.48 - 1140.88] dry dry pulp coming out right here
[1138.40 - 1143.44] a couple of tips don't add anything to
[1140.88 - 1147.36] your celery juice
[1143.44 - 1150.24] the medicine has to be by itself
[1147.36 - 1151.76] has to be by itself it's easy to clean
[1150.24 - 1153.84] isn't it so you guys are happy with it
[1151.76 - 1155.28] i love it i'm in love with this juicer i
[1153.84 - 1157.76] can't even tell you
[1155.28 - 1158.80] love it love it i've tried every juicer
[1157.76 - 1162.00] out there
[1158.80 - 1162.00] love this juicer
[1162.32 - 1169.84] don't do high pressure pasteurization
[1166.40 - 1173.52] celery juice from the store
[1169.84 - 1176.16] you're getting ripped off every time you
[1173.52 - 1180.48] buy celery juice from a store
[1176.16 - 1184.08] and it's in a bottle in the cold section
[1180.48 - 1187.44] and wasn't freshly juiced that morning
[1184.08 - 1190.56] it's high pressure pasteurization hpp
[1187.44 - 1192.64] do not do hpp celery juice
[1190.56 - 1194.24] it's b you may as well just dump it in
[1192.64 - 1196.00] the parking lot buy it
[1194.24 - 1197.76] pour it out in the street in the parking
[1196.00 - 1200.00] lot that's how useless it is because of
[1197.76 - 1202.24] high pressure pasteurization
[1200.00 - 1203.20] keep that in mind they'll say it's raw
[1202.24 - 1205.60] on the bottle
[1203.20 - 1207.68] it looks like raw green juice it looks
[1205.60 - 1209.76] like raw celery juice
[1207.68 - 1211.66] but it's not it's been cooked in a
[1209.76 - 1212.98] different way
[1211.66 - 1214.56] [Applause]
[1212.98 - 1216.72] [Music]
[1214.56 - 1217.84] cell brook says how much celery juice
[1216.72 - 1220.40] medicine
[1217.84 - 1224.24] when i'm on mattress island with cfs if
[1220.40 - 1227.84] i was on mattress island with cfs
[1224.24 - 1227.84] if i was there okay
[1229.28 - 1232.88] i'd be doing what i can to start with
[1231.68 - 1235.84] like what can i do
[1232.88 - 1236.56] can i get up to 32 ounces i would do a
[1235.84 - 1239.44] minimum
[1236.56 - 1240.24] of 16 ounces on an empty stomach in the
[1239.44 - 1242.24] morning
[1240.24 - 1244.64] if you're really sensitive start with
[1242.24 - 1248.16] four ounces six ounces
[1244.64 - 1249.52] if i had cfs i would work myself up to
[1248.16 - 1251.92] 32 ounces
[1249.52 - 1253.20] or at least 28 ounces eventually all
[1251.92 - 1255.92] right there's plenty of celery juice in
[1253.20 - 1255.92] here right now so
[1257.52 - 1262.72] that's what i would do all right
[1261.20 - 1264.80] so i want to show you guys and i think
[1262.72 - 1266.16] you guys know this right this is light
[1264.80 - 1268.16] and fluffy
[1266.16 - 1269.28] so this is light and fluffy so this is
[1268.16 - 1272.24] dry
[1269.28 - 1272.96] it's dry there's no juice in the bottom
[1272.24 - 1275.20] of this
[1272.96 - 1276.00] this is dry the pulp see that see the
[1275.20 - 1278.88] pulp pieces
[1276.00 - 1280.00] it's not sticking to the bottom it's
[1278.88 - 1281.64] actually dry
[1280.00 - 1283.20] right there's a reason for that the
[1281.64 - 1286.32] mm-900
[1283.20 - 1289.68] squeezes out so much juice
[1286.32 - 1291.20] that your pulp is dry
[1289.68 - 1292.88] let me just tell you what this equate
[1291.20 - 1296.48] equates for for me
[1292.88 - 1299.12] i've already saved i mean
[1296.48 - 1299.60] thousands at this point where it's paid
[1299.12 - 1301.84] for
[1299.60 - 1303.52] free juicers meaning i could have gotten
[1301.84 - 1305.92] 12 new free juicers
[1303.52 - 1307.28] with the money i saved because i buy so
[1305.92 - 1309.28] much celery
[1307.28 - 1312.88] that's the difference right there it's
[1309.28 - 1312.88] it's incredible blows me away still
[1315.20 - 1318.48] trying to read a comment because there's
[1316.08 - 1319.04] a movement the only use organic celery
[1318.48 - 1321.52] no
[1319.04 - 1322.64] no i don't i i use conventional celery i
[1321.52 - 1325.36] wash it really good
[1322.64 - 1325.92] i wash out the stalks conventional
[1325.36 - 1328.32] celery
[1325.92 - 1330.08] i take my thumb i take a little bit of
[1328.32 - 1331.84] natural dish dish soap right
[1330.08 - 1333.44] i have a big bowl of water i put a
[1331.84 - 1334.48] little bit of natural dish soap in there
[1333.44 - 1336.08] it's a little bit right
[1334.48 - 1337.68] i stick the celery in there meaning
[1336.08 - 1338.08] actually i get i get it ready for where
[1337.68 - 1340.96] it's
[1338.08 - 1342.00] it stalks like this i put it in the bowl
[1340.96 - 1344.32] and then
[1342.00 - 1345.36] i rub it with my hands really good in
[1344.32 - 1347.20] that water
[1345.36 - 1349.60] and i take my thumb and i go down the
[1347.20 - 1350.88] stalks like this and i clean all that
[1349.60 - 1352.72] out really nice
[1350.88 - 1355.36] yeah i use conventional celery
[1352.72 - 1356.08] absolutely i mean i use organic when i
[1355.36 - 1358.48] can but
[1356.08 - 1360.48] if i can't find it i'm still gonna juice
[1358.48 - 1363.68] um conventional celery
[1360.48 - 1366.48] 100 because because you're still
[1363.68 - 1367.28] yeah you you don't have an organic herb
[1366.48 - 1369.20] you're not using
[1367.28 - 1371.52] organic herb at the moment but that's
[1369.20 - 1376.20] okay because what it offers is an herb
[1371.52 - 1379.16] outweighs it where do you buy the juicer
[1376.20 - 1382.16] omegajuicers.com it's their

[1400.56 - 1403.92] important
[1401.20 - 1405.60] the celery juice helps sibo does it ever
[1403.92 - 1409.36] does it ever
[1405.60 - 1412.56] does it ever because what sibo
[1409.36 - 1416.00] right sibo is small right
[1412.56 - 1418.64] intestinal bacterial overgrowth
[1416.00 - 1420.56] well as i was talking about before
[1418.64 - 1424.32] celery juice
[1420.56 - 1427.36] is a bacteria killer
[1424.32 - 1428.40] it's a bacteria and viral killer celery
[1427.36 - 1432.40] juice
[1428.40 - 1435.92] kills viruses and bacteria
[1432.40 - 1437.84] that's right sibo is streptococcus
[1435.92 - 1439.20] specifically research and science
[1437.84 - 1440.48] doesn't know that they just think it's
[1439.20 - 1441.20] some type of bacteria they don't know
[1440.48 - 1443.92] what kind
[1441.20 - 1445.36] but it's streptococcus that's what gives
[1443.92 - 1447.04] the bloating
[1445.36 - 1448.64] that the whole bit that's that's the
[1447.04 - 1449.28] bacteria that takes over that's the
[1448.64 - 1451.04] dominance
[1449.28 - 1453.36] that's the dominant strain of bacteria
[1451.04 - 1455.44] and everybody's got to streptococcus
[1453.36 - 1456.48] there's so much to be had tons of it out
[1455.44 - 1458.96] there people
[1456.48 - 1460.40] share it spread it some people have five
[1458.96 - 1461.76] different strains
[1460.40 - 1463.12] 10 different strains of strap in their
[1461.76 - 1464.08] system picking up so many different
[1463.12 - 1467.92] strains
[1464.08 - 1469.28] and celery juice helps to whack it
[1467.92 - 1471.36] see if you guys know if you guys just
[1469.28 - 1473.44] came on here there's a sale on the
[1471.36 - 1476.96] mm-900 hds
[1473.44 - 1480.40] and the thing is with this pulp is dry

[1480.40 - 1487.52] it's flaky it's flaky and dry
[1484.40 - 1489.60] and because it squeezes
[1487.52 - 1491.20] the juice so then what i'm doing when i
[1489.60 - 1492.40] go to the store i'm buying less celery
[1491.20 - 1494.32] it's like okay i'm going to buy some

[1516.72 - 1523.20] amazing so let's just pour this in here
[1519.84 - 1526.32] so it's talking about how the juice
[1523.20 - 1530.00] kills pathogens very important
[1526.32 - 1533.60] you have to strain your juice
[1530.00 - 1538.00] so you have to strain it okay that is
[1533.60 - 1538.00] key got to strain it
[1539.12 - 1543.84] glad you guys are coming on
[1547.52 - 1551.28] straining it is very important
[1553.04 - 1560.56] you want that pure herbal juice
[1556.16 - 1560.56] pure herbal medicine is what you want
[1561.44 - 1569.04] you want that as pure herbal medicine
[1565.60 - 1571.12] okay so what you'll run into is stupid
[1569.04 - 1573.36] talk about celery out there
[1571.12 - 1574.72] okay let's cover that real quick if you
[1573.36 - 1576.24] guys got a few seconds
[1574.72 - 1579.68] just want to let you in on something
[1576.24 - 1582.72] okay this is the only trend
[1579.68 - 1584.16] in health in the world that's not backed
[1582.72 - 1587.12] by money
[1584.16 - 1588.40] think about that all your probiotics all
[1587.12 - 1591.04] your fish oils
[1588.40 - 1593.04] all your different all your stuff all
[1591.04 - 1593.84] your fulvic acid it doesn't matter what
[1593.04 - 1596.48] it is
[1593.84 - 1597.36] your sodium bicarbonate whatever it is
[1596.48 - 1600.64] whatever your
[1597.36 - 1603.84] whatever is happening in trend world
[1600.64 - 1607.20] kombucha tea all of it
[1603.84 - 1610.48] is backed by money investors
[1607.20 - 1612.64] and shareholders just so you know
[1610.48 - 1614.32] and that's why the stuff is out there
[1612.64 - 1616.00] it's not out there because it
[1614.32 - 1618.24] moved the needle when someone was on
[1616.00 - 1621.12] mattress island
[1618.24 - 1622.56] do you know how this survived because it
[1621.12 - 1624.32] moved the needle when someone was on
[1622.56 - 1626.56] mattress island
[1624.32 - 1628.40] that's why this survived whey protein
[1626.56 - 1630.08] powder is only surviving
[1628.40 - 1631.84] because it's got money behind it apple
[1630.08 - 1633.92] cider vinegar is only surviving
[1631.84 - 1636.00] because it's a billion dollar industry
[1633.92 - 1637.44] these are only surviving
[1636.00 - 1639.12] because they have investors and
[1637.44 - 1641.68] shareholders
[1639.12 - 1644.16] and there's money propelling it into
[1641.68 - 1647.84] millions and millions of dollars of ads
[1644.16 - 1649.28] celery juice stays alive on its own out
[1647.84 - 1651.60] there without any money behind it do you
[1649.28 - 1654.32] guys know what that means
[1651.60 - 1656.24] that means it really works it stayed
[1654.32 - 1658.40] alive with the naysayers that
[1656.24 - 1660.32] the attacks on it because you can't make
[1658.40 - 1663.04] money on celery juice
[1660.32 - 1664.80] right on celery robin says your
[1663.04 - 1665.60] information rescued me from mattress
[1664.80 - 1668.08] island
[1665.60 - 1670.48] that means everything to me everything
[1668.08 - 1672.72] yes acv is bad for you on tick tock
[1670.48 - 1674.40] it's terrible for you and in so many
[1672.72 - 1675.92] ways i'm not going to go into it right

[1681.36 - 1685.68] um so robin i'm so glad you're off
[1684.64 - 1689.04] mattress island
[1685.68 - 1690.08] thank god thank god that that means
[1689.04 - 1694.72] everything to me
[1690.08 - 1696.00] everything so you guys this stayed alive
[1694.72 - 1697.84] and millions of people are drinking
[1696.00 - 1699.44] worldwide
[1697.84 - 1701.20] and alternative medicine and
[1699.44 - 1704.48] conventional medicine hate it
[1701.20 - 1706.64] they hate this because it's not making
[1704.48 - 1708.32] the podcast doctors money
[1706.64 - 1709.60] it's not making the podcast doctors
[1708.32 - 1711.36] money it's not making the youtube
[1709.60 - 1712.40] doctors money it's not making anybody
[1711.36 - 1715.64] money
[1712.40 - 1716.88] but yet it's in the way there's no
[1715.64 - 1718.80] shareholders
[1716.88 - 1720.48] and that are dumping in millions and
[1718.80 - 1722.00] millions of dollars in advertisements
[1720.48 - 1724.56] for for this
[1722.00 - 1726.00] this isn't being advertised all over the
[1724.56 - 1729.12] place but know all
[1726.00 - 1731.12] your tricked out supplements
[1729.12 - 1732.64] that won't move the needle like your
[1731.12 - 1735.44] charcoals and
[1732.64 - 1736.08] your zeolites and your bentonite clay
[1735.44 - 1737.68] and
[1736.08 - 1739.28] you know your whey protein powder and
[1737.68 - 1741.28] your charcoal and your acv
[1739.28 - 1742.96] gummies and all that stuff propelled my
[1741.28 - 1744.72] money your kombucha tea propelled my
[1742.96 - 1746.80] money money money money
[1744.72 - 1748.16] this isn't do you guys know what that
[1746.80 - 1750.00] means
[1748.16 - 1751.52] that means that this is the only trend
[1750.00 - 1752.00] in existence in alternative and
[1751.52 - 1754.08] conventional
[1752.00 - 1755.76] medicine that literally survives because
[1754.08 - 1756.24] it actually heals people not because it
[1755.76 - 1757.92] has
[1756.24 - 1759.68] billions of dollars being dumped into it
[1757.92 - 1761.92] and advertisements non-stop left and
[1759.68 - 1761.92] right
[1764.84 - 1770.96] right god when you think about it
[1768.08 - 1773.20] when you think about it that's a big
[1770.96 - 1773.20] deal
[1773.36 - 1778.08] survives with all the hate and the
[1776.00 - 1780.00] negativity to it and how many
[1778.08 - 1781.68] nutritionists say you you shouldn't
[1780.00 - 1783.60] juice celery you should make sure you
[1781.68 - 1786.72] just have it in a smoothie with
[1783.60 - 1789.52] other things yeah you can do that too
[1786.72 - 1791.28] celery is good for you but it becomes a
[1789.52 - 1792.88] medicine when you juice it this is
[1791.28 - 1796.00] herbal medicine
[1792.88 - 1798.32] and it's one of the medical medium tools
[1796.00 - 1799.20] and many people don't use this tool
[1798.32 - 1801.12] correctly
[1799.20 - 1802.80] has to be on an empty stomach if you can
[1801.12 - 1803.36] that's usually its best ticket right
[1802.80 - 1805.60] there
[1803.36 - 1806.40] 16 ounces on an empty stomach right
[1805.60 - 1807.92] that's that
[1806.40 - 1809.60] right there is really important check
[1807.92 - 1813.28] this out right that one
[1809.60 - 1816.00] don't add ice no lemon no water
[1813.28 - 1817.60] don't add that into your juice keep that
[1816.00 - 1820.56] in mind
[1817.60 - 1821.92] stacy highland how are you had a tickle
[1820.56 - 1825.12] in my throat monday
[1821.92 - 1827.60] zinc and c shock therapy plus fat free
[1825.12 - 1828.40] back to normal today incredible the
[1827.60 - 1830.56] vitamin c shock
[1828.40 - 1832.56] medical medium vitamin c c shock therapy
[1830.56 - 1835.76] and zinc shock therapy incredible
[1832.56 - 1837.84] but vimergy products though
[1835.76 - 1839.76] vimergy i'm not sponsored by vimergy but
[1837.84 - 1840.56] it's got to be vimrgy to really do what
[1839.76 - 1842.16] it's got to do
[1840.56 - 1843.76] because i heard someone tried it with a
[1842.16 - 1845.76] whole bunch of other different stuff
[1843.76 - 1847.84] crappy stuff from other companies and it
[1845.76 - 1851.04] didn't work because it was bad zinc
[1847.84 - 1852.80] wasn't stabilized terrible vitamin c
[1851.04 - 1854.96] yeah so it has to be the good stuff like
[1852.80 - 1858.24] the vimergy

[2011.60 - 2016.80] metal detox cleanse next week
[2014.40 - 2017.76] sharon says what about this new weight
[2016.80 - 2020.16] loss kick
[2017.76 - 2022.48] of lemon in coffee and honey so they
[2020.16 - 2024.64] take a medical medium tool like lemon
[2022.48 - 2026.96] right the lemon water and they stick it
[2024.64 - 2030.24] in coffee now
[2026.96 - 2032.80] an empty stomach that's a that's
[2030.24 - 2033.36] no no offense right because i know
[2032.80 - 2035.04] you're just
[2033.36 - 2036.56] talking about this new trend out there
[2035.04 - 2038.96] right but it's
[2036.56 - 2039.68] it's the dumbest trend that's so dumb so
[2038.96 - 2041.76] let's just
[2039.68 - 2044.24] let's add okay okay instead of putting
[2041.76 - 2045.60] table sugar in our coffee or raw sugar
[2044.24 - 2046.00] in our coffee let's put honey in our
[2045.60 - 2048.40] coffee
[2046.00 - 2049.20] now we just we we stepped up a little
[2048.40 - 2052.64] bit i mean
[2049.20 - 2055.44] how crazy is that right
[2052.64 - 2057.04] why did you promote conventional celery
[2055.44 - 2060.32] because there's people out there
[2057.04 - 2063.76] that can't always get organic and the
[2060.32 - 2066.00] but yet okay if you can't get organic
[2063.76 - 2070.24] celery
[2066.00 - 2071.60] and it means not juicing celery at all
[2070.24 - 2073.68] because you don't want to use
[2071.60 - 2074.08] conventional celery you just wronged
[2073.68 - 2077.12] yourself
[2074.08 - 2077.84] bad there's times i can't get organic
[2077.12 - 2078.88] celery
[2077.84 - 2082.00] you better believe i grabbed
[2078.88 - 2085.28] conventional celery dang right
[2082.00 - 2087.04] and i'm juicing it so
[2085.28 - 2088.80] that's why i promoted conventional
[2087.04 - 2091.36] celery 100
[2088.80 - 2092.72] hands down hands down you're somebody
[2091.36 - 2094.24] that you're not going to juice celery at
[2092.72 - 2096.00] all because you can only get a hold of
[2094.24 - 2097.84] conventional celery so hey i won't juice
[2096.00 - 2099.76] it at all oh my god
[2097.84 - 2102.64] that's crazy you know why because you're
[2099.76 - 2103.68] going to get pesticides somewhere else
[2102.64 - 2105.12] your butt's going to be getting
[2103.68 - 2106.80] pesticides somewhere else you're going
[2105.12 - 2107.92] to be getting pesticides from all kinds
[2106.80 - 2109.36] of stuff you don't even know about
[2107.92 - 2110.48] including your neighbor spraying it on
[2109.36 - 2112.00] the lawn next door
[2110.48 - 2113.68] in your apartment building being sprayed
[2112.00 - 2114.16] or all around your parting apartment
[2113.68 - 2115.28] building
[2114.16 - 2117.20] you're going to be getting in the
[2115.28 - 2119.36] mosquito spray that's being dumped on
[2117.20 - 2120.40] everybody right now across the world
[2119.36 - 2122.24] you're going to be getting all these
[2120.40 - 2122.72] pesticides and insecticides in you
[2122.24 - 2124.00] anyway
[2122.72 - 2125.76] but you're going to stay away for a
[2124.00 - 2127.36] conventional stock of celery
[2125.76 - 2129.04] and not use something that can actually
[2127.36 - 2130.88] help you i mean do i make sense or i
[2129.04 - 2132.56] don't make any sense

[2447.76 - 2450.96] okay your bloating might not go away
[2449.68 - 2453.60] overnight
[2450.96 - 2454.96] sometimes it takes time plenty of time
[2453.60 - 2456.40] you might have more than one thing
[2454.96 - 2459.44] causing your bloating
[2456.40 - 2462.64] some people will have the bacteria
[2459.44 - 2464.32] right or even the viruses
[2462.64 - 2466.48] they'll have the bacteria and viruses
[2464.32 - 2468.00] inside their liver
[2466.48 - 2470.24] their liver gets stagnant and sluggish
[2468.00 - 2473.04] from all their high fat diets
[2470.24 - 2474.40] all their vinegar all their other stuff
[2473.04 - 2476.56] their caffeine
[2474.40 - 2479.12] and their liver gets burnt out chalked
[2476.56 - 2481.36] out choked out
[2479.12 - 2482.96] so pathogens tend to thrive in the liver
[2481.36 - 2485.04] even more then your liver doesn't
[2482.96 - 2487.04] produce as much bile
[2485.04 - 2488.96] so it doesn't produce as much bile as it
[2487.04 - 2491.36] needs to produce
[2488.96 - 2492.56] and so because of that now your fats
[2491.36 - 2495.20] aren't being
[2492.56 - 2496.16] broken down celery juice has
[2495.20 - 2499.52] significantly

[2671.20 - 2675.36] than you know the
[2673.52 - 2677.68] the this you know where you stitch the
[2675.36 - 2679.52] stomach so people can't eat as much
[2677.68 - 2681.52] so worse than that he removes the entire
[2679.52 - 2682.80] stomach out do you remove the entire
[2681.52 - 2684.56] stomach out
[2682.80 - 2687.44] he says he removes not only the entire
[2684.56 - 2688.96] stomach he even considers it recommends
[2687.44 - 2691.52] removing the person's brain
[2688.96 - 2693.36] so they choose not to eat and get
[2691.52 - 2695.52] themselves bloated
[2693.36 - 2697.60] he says yeah does that make any sense dr
[2695.52 - 2699.12] nesbitt is drunk right now
[2697.60 - 2700.80] he actually had a shot of whiskey in
[2699.12 - 2703.60] between surgery
[2700.80 - 2705.76] i trust dr nesbit sometimes but lately
[2703.60 - 2707.87] he's been off the mark
[2705.76 - 2708.96] doctrine has been all kidding around
[2707.87 - 2714.08] [Music]
[2708.96 - 2714.08] is this a medical device it is
[2714.64 - 2718.88] so what's the difference in juicing and
[2716.88 - 2720.24] not eating it let's go into that doctor

[2728.80 - 2733.84] and not eating it let's do that right
[2730.84 - 2733.84] now
[2736.24 - 2738.56] okay
[2739.76 - 2744.16] emcee traditional chinese medicine
[2741.60 - 2744.88] doctor third generation master very old
[2744.16 - 2747.12] and saved
[2744.88 - 2748.40] tens of thousands of lives and said
[2747.12 - 2751.92] lemon and celery are
[2748.40 - 2753.76] both cold foods and not good every day
[2751.92 - 2756.64] can you please speak to that
[2753.76 - 2758.24] well yeah i can definitely because in my
[2756.64 - 2760.24] 35 years of
[2758.24 - 2761.68] practice when i was working one-on-one
[2760.24 - 2763.76] with people
[2761.68 - 2765.20] the most powerful people in the world
[2763.76 - 2768.40] would travel
[2765.20 - 2769.60] take their private jets and and come to
[2768.40 - 2772.88] my office
[2769.60 - 2775.36] after going to china after going
[2772.88 - 2776.72] all up to asia all over the world to the
[2775.36 - 2777.52] best traditional chinese medicine
[2776.72 - 2780.16] doctors
[2777.52 - 2780.80] that were second third fourth generation
[2780.16 - 2783.60] okay
[2780.80 - 2785.20] and so what they learned was they were
[2783.60 - 2787.92] told the same thing
[2785.20 - 2788.48] celery was too cold and lemon was too
[2787.92 - 2791.60] cold
[2788.48 - 2793.76] on the liver but that wasn't an answer
[2791.60 - 2796.40] was it an answer so when they had their
[2793.76 - 2797.92] vertigo and their floaters in their eyes
[2796.40 - 2799.52] and they were dizzy and couldn't
[2797.92 - 2801.44] function and they were part
[2799.52 - 2803.84] basically bedridden and on mattress
[2801.44 - 2806.48] island and they had five diagnoses
[2803.84 - 2807.36] and already seen 50 doctors and traveled
[2806.48 - 2808.88] around the world
[2807.36 - 2811.12] to the best traditional chinese medicine
[2808.88 - 2812.88] doctors they realized when they went to
[2811.12 - 2815.36] the traditional chinese medicine doctor
[2812.88 - 2817.04] they didn't have an answer they weren't
[2815.36 - 2817.60] told what was causing their their
[2817.04 - 2819.12] problem
[2817.60 - 2821.28] they weren't told why they were
[2819.12 - 2822.72] suffering they were told they had liver
[2821.28 - 2824.40] heat
[2822.72 - 2826.64] they were told they had dampness of the
[2824.40 - 2827.36] spleen and that's what they were told
[2826.64 - 2830.48] emcee
[2827.36 - 2832.88] okay and i have no disrespect
[2830.48 - 2834.32] towards chinese medicine i know chinese
[2832.88 - 2837.20] medicine doctors
[2834.32 - 2839.92] known them for years they like to learn
[2837.20 - 2841.76] and they like to break out of that box
[2839.92 - 2843.28] okay and they like to learn about
[2841.76 - 2846.56] different things because we're now
[2843.28 - 2848.64] in a world of chronic illness
[2846.56 - 2850.64] neurological chronic illness caused by
[2848.64 - 2852.48] pathogens and chinese medicine doctors
[2850.64 - 2853.84] of the past did not know this
[2852.48 - 2855.20] and now they're starting to learn and
[2853.84 - 2856.80] start they're starting to talk about
[2855.20 - 2860.64] bugs for the first time
[2856.80 - 2863.52] okay and so and the other thing is
[2860.64 - 2864.96] millions of people worldwide are healing
[2863.52 - 2868.32] and getting their lives back because of
[2864.96 - 2871.44] medical medium info and celery juice

[2871.44 - 2878.64] has tens of thousands of healing stories
[2874.40 - 2882.32] so just so you know no disrespect
[2878.64 - 2883.12] but that's just a tidbit cold foods have
[2882.32 - 2886.32] nothing to do
[2883.12 - 2889.36] with what somebody being sick or not
[2886.32 - 2889.84] it has nothing to do with it okay lie

[3199.52 - 3204.16] really
[3200.64 - 3206.24] poor donkeys all right
[3204.16 - 3208.32] so when someone when someone the whole
[3206.24 - 3210.72] lyme disease movement i can't tell you
[3208.32 - 3212.16] how many people rolled into my office
[3210.72 - 3214.24] with lyme disease
[3212.16 - 3215.60] barely alive and they've been to
[3214.24 - 3217.28] everybody and anything
[3215.60 - 3218.80] especially the people that had money
[3217.28 - 3220.48] that rolled into my office
[3218.80 - 3222.40] even when i wasn't charging anything in
[3220.48 - 3223.84] my office well i worked for free at my
[3222.40 - 3225.04] office and there were lines out the door
[3223.84 - 3226.88] out my shack
[3225.04 - 3228.56] literally out of my shack lines of
[3226.88 - 3230.80] people and they were do you know how
[3228.56 - 3232.80] they were paying me an apple
[3230.80 - 3234.32] they're paying me an apple they'd leave
[3232.80 - 3237.60] two apples
[3234.32 - 3240.88] they'd leave a banana they leave
[3237.60 - 3242.56] dried lavender okay even when i wasn't
[3240.88 - 3244.08] charging for years right until i
[3242.56 - 3245.04] couldn't keep the lights on so then i
[3244.08 - 3247.84] had to
[3245.04 - 3248.32] so the bottom line is it got to it you
[3247.84 - 3250.08] know it
[3248.32 - 3251.68] it the amount of people that rolled into
[3250.08 - 3254.48] my office from around the world
[3251.68 - 3256.00] with lyme disease and they went to all
[3254.48 - 3257.44] the different people they went to all
[3256.00 - 3259.44] the different chinese medicine doctors
[3257.44 - 3260.48] the acupuncturists the nutritionists the
[3259.44 - 3263.20] dietitians
[3260.48 - 3264.32] the functional doctors they were called
[3263.20 - 3266.16] something different back then the
[3264.32 - 3267.44] alternative doctors the holistic doctors
[3266.16 - 3269.04] so functional doctors functional
[3267.44 - 3270.40] medicine doctors were called holistic
[3269.04 - 3272.32] medical doctors back then they weren't
[3270.40 - 3275.36] called functional medicine doctors
[3272.32 - 3277.60] and so with all that
[3275.36 - 3279.36] they had to learn that this isn't why
[3277.60 - 3280.96] they were sick
[3279.36 - 3283.12] they had to learn that that wasn't why
[3280.96 - 3285.12] they were sick
[3283.12 - 3287.04] they had to learn that's why they were
[3285.12 - 3289.04] sick
[3287.04 - 3290.08] that's what they had to learn they had
[3289.04 - 3292.88] to learn they were sick
[3290.08 - 3295.52] because of this not because of this and
[3292.88 - 3297.68] that's what saved their lives
[3295.52 - 3299.20] in in no disrespect to the person that
[3297.68 - 3301.20] said third generation
[3299.20 - 3303.28] uh chinese medicine doctor there was no
[3301.20 - 3305.20] third generation chinese medicine doctor
[3303.28 - 3306.64] back in that time period that can tell
[3305.20 - 3308.24] somebody they were sick
[3306.64 - 3311.04] with a virus that was making them
[3308.24 - 3314.72] neurologically inflamed
[3311.04 - 3314.72] and they weren't sick because of that
[3315.28 - 3322.32] and so medical mean information really
[3318.80 - 3324.32] blew up with healing people with lyme
[3322.32 - 3326.72] disease that's what it was known for for
[3324.32 - 3329.28] years
[3326.72 - 3330.48] two decades known for that recovering
[3329.28 - 3331.44] people with lyme disease and even
[3330.48 - 3333.20] earlier
[3331.44 - 3335.28] laurie starr your information has helped
[3333.20 - 3336.00] me so much more than anything else i
[3335.28 - 3337.68] have tried
[3336.00 - 3339.52] you're an answer to my prayers honored
[3337.68 - 3341.28] you're here truly
[3339.52 - 3344.00] because lyme disease wasn't caused by a
[3341.28 - 3345.84] tick that's why people who got
[3344.00 - 3347.44] aj good to see you that's why there are
[3345.84 - 3349.04] so many people

[3354.32 - 3358.64] region but had lyme disease
[3356.80 - 3360.32] because lyme disease is caused by the

[3360.32 - 3363.76] the simplex one the cytomegalovirus all

[3588.96 - 3591.20] um
[3594.80 - 3599.60] so you guys let's do a quick rundown on
[3597.84 - 3602.88] how celery just works real quick
[3599.60 - 3604.64] and how important it is why one of the
[3602.88 - 3607.12] reasons why it's so helpful and
[3604.64 - 3608.72] it clears up brain fog too is because
[3607.12 - 3610.96] it's a complete electrolyte
[3608.72 - 3612.64] i want to cover that nina says i feel so
[3610.96 - 3613.60] much better i drink 20 ounces in the
[3612.64 - 3617.04] morning
[3613.60 - 3618.16] no food or drink for 30 minutes i feel
[3617.04 - 3621.60] great
[3618.16 - 3623.92] awesome it's a complete electrolyte
[3621.60 - 3625.92] please know that a complete electrolyte
[3623.92 - 3628.88] we don't have one herb
[3625.92 - 3629.68] one food one vegetable one fruit one
[3628.88 - 3631.44] piece of meat
[3629.68 - 3633.04] we don't have anything that has a
[3631.44 - 3636.16] complete electrolyte
[3633.04 - 3638.64] we don't we don't this is the only thing
[3636.16 - 3641.52] that has a complete electrolyte
[3638.64 - 3642.56] okay sodium cluster salts are a complete
[3641.52 - 3644.64] electrolyte
[3642.56 - 3648.00] so when this goes to the brain it helps
[3644.64 - 3651.04] to revive your neurotransmitters
[3648.00 - 3652.88] your neurotransmitters start to revive
[3651.04 - 3654.96] so that's another very important part of
[3652.88 - 3658.40] why celery juice is so incredible
