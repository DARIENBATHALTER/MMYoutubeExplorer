[0.80 - 10.92] [Music]
[9.04 - 15.76] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 18.24] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.76 - 19.80] medium hello I'm Anthony William you're
[18.24 - 21.72] listening to the medical medium radio
[19.80 - 23.84] show where each week I talk about the
[21.72 - 25.64] most advanced healing information it's
[23.84 - 28.68] often decades ahead of what's out there
[25.64 - 31.20] now decades ahead of time who has 10
[28.68 - 33.92] years 20 years to wait for answers and
[31.20 - 36.04] today we're talking about viigo so who
[33.92 - 39.48] wants to wait for answers for Vitiligo I
[36.04 - 41.48] mean you would be surprised you really
[39.48 - 44.24] would um with chronic illness in the
[41.48 - 47.32] industry right now the there's very few
[44.24 - 50.16] answers it's unbelievable even where we
[47.32 - 52.16] are today you know I remember you know
[50.16 - 54.16] back 30 years ago and I remember 30
[52.16 - 56.08] years ago helping out people and I
[54.16 - 58.36] remember Spirit telling me we're way off
[56.08 - 59.56] as far as the timeline as far as getting
[58.36 - 61.00] getting the right information with
[59.56 - 62.56] research Arch and science getting that
[61.00 - 64.64] sorted out getting straight so we have
[62.56 - 67.64] to do it for everybody we have to get
[64.64 - 70.00] the advanced information out there for
[67.64 - 70.88] everybody early and when it comes down
[70.00 - 73.36] to
[70.88 - 76.52] Vitiligo and some people call it Vio
[73.36 - 78.76] some people viigo um some people call it
[76.52 - 80.68] something different but you know what
[78.76 - 83.88] happens is that even with
[80.68 - 85.48] vidigo um I'm going all the way back I I
[83.88 - 87.44] I remember helping people out giving
[85.48 - 89.56] them the same
[87.44 - 93.28] information as I'm going to give you in
[89.56 - 95.28] the show about viigo the same
[93.28 - 97.28] information what that means is it's
[95.28 - 99.60] always been Advanced when Spirit hands
[97.28 - 101.88] that information over to me um since a
[99.60 - 104.28] young child that's how it's always been
[101.88 - 105.72] and for anybody who is not familiar with
[104.28 - 106.80] with how it works with medical medium
[105.72 - 108.68] and the show and everything what you're
[106.80 - 111.52] going to find on on these shows is
[108.68 - 115.00] information that is not polluted and
[111.52 - 116.40] it's not polluted by um certain groups
[115.00 - 118.84] interest groups medical funding with
[116.40 - 120.68] strings attached or botched research uh
[118.84 - 122.80] thumb thumb on the scale kind of thing
[120.68 - 124.56] where it's like internal Kickbacks and
[122.80 - 126.08] persuaded belief systems and private
[124.56 - 128.24] panel of influencers health field
[126.08 - 130.40] payoffs and trendy traps those things
[128.24 - 132.28] all exist in conventional and
[130.40 - 134.48] alternative I repeat alternative
[132.28 - 136.32] medicine in fact alternative medicine is
[134.48 - 138.44] polluted with that there's a lot of
[136.32 - 141.60] Empires built right now you guys don't
[138.44 - 144.28] even know you don't even know how many
[141.60 - 146.28] empires are built in the conventional
[144.28 - 148.40] but but most I mean most importantly
[146.28 - 150.12] alternative movement which is really sad
[148.40 - 151.92] back in the old day it wasn't like that
[150.12 - 153.88] I remember back in the old days it
[151.92 - 156.68] wasn't about Empires building on
[153.88 - 158.80] alternative medicine so that means you
[156.68 - 161.48] know uh lots of money and lots of
[158.80 - 163.40] studies being Twisted to for outcomes to
[161.48 - 164.96] come out the way you know they want it
[163.40 - 166.64] to be and stuff like that that didn't
[164.96 - 168.84] really exist in alternative medicine in
[166.64 - 172.24] the old days well it exists now and it's
[168.84 - 173.84] really really horrific and this show
[172.24 - 175.76] doesn't have any of that so if you're
[173.84 - 177.20] you're first logged on to the show and
[175.76 - 179.36] you're like what is this the medical
[177.20 - 180.88] medium blah blah blah what is this show
[179.36 - 182.68] what what is is he saying where's his
[180.88 - 183.80] research and science where's his studies
[182.68 - 185.16] let me tell you something you want to
[183.80 - 186.80] stand by research in science with
[185.16 - 188.44] chronic illness then you're just going
[186.80 - 190.92] to be standing there for decades I'm
[188.44 - 192.20] sorry decades and decades and decades
[190.92 - 193.64] whether you like it or not whether you
[192.20 - 195.40] don't like me whether you don't like
[193.64 - 197.56] what I'm saying I don't care it's the
[195.40 - 199.64] truth the truth is the truth the one
[197.56 - 201.80] thing when people are sick with chronic
[199.64 - 204.08] illness or with vialago or anything like
[201.80 - 205.20] that is it has to be the truth when
[204.08 - 207.28] people are suffering and they're
[205.20 - 209.56] struggling with anything there's no
[207.28 - 211.72] playing around there's no playing around
[209.56 - 213.72] and I don't play around that's I don't
[211.72 - 216.20] do it when it's when when it's about
[213.72 - 217.72] this right here you know there's no way
[216.20 - 219.28] because you're talking about people
[217.72 - 220.72] suffering you're talking about people
[219.28 - 222.32] going through so much in their lives
[220.72 - 223.72] with all the different diseases
[222.32 - 225.84] conditions and illnesses and symptoms
[223.72 - 227.56] neurological symptoms everything from
[225.84 - 230.76] aches and pains to chronic fatigue to
[227.56 - 232.52] neuro fatigue to to I mean whatever
[230.76 - 234.32] people deal with eye problems ear
[232.52 - 236.40] problems you know throat problems
[234.32 - 238.68] thyroid problems hashimotos thyroiditis
[236.40 - 240.36] and hyperthyroidism and diabetes and all
[238.68 - 242.36] these other things that we all deal with
[240.36 - 243.92] out there and that's just this tip of
[242.36 - 245.84] the iceberg but when chronic illness
[243.92 - 247.84] when people are suffering and struggling
[245.84 - 250.24] we can't play around it has to be
[247.84 - 252.20] straight out it can't be protecting the
[250.24 - 253.68] interest groups of research and science
[252.20 - 255.44] it can't be about that because that's
[253.68 - 257.88] what that does in chronic illness it's
[255.44 - 259.84] all only about an outcome that they want
[257.88 - 261.60] to hand you to protect them it's never
[259.84 - 263.40] to protect the people in chronic illness
[261.60 - 265.36] it's never to Pro protect the people
[263.40 - 268.52] ever this is the only show you'll ever
[265.36 - 271.16] find that is not contaminated it doesn't
[268.52 - 273.16] have any of that talk nature to it okay
[271.16 - 276.76] it's pure it's untampered with it's
[273.16 - 278.40] Advanced Clean source of information so
[276.76 - 282.00] you know I said something on one of my
[278.40 - 283.12] Facebook lives I I said um you know I
[282.00 - 285.00] don't know if it was an Instagram live
[283.12 - 286.76] or Facebook live but I said I can hand
[285.00 - 289.52] you the go I can hand over the golden
[286.76 - 291.20] ticket okay I can hand it over to you or
[289.52 - 292.56] I can smack it out of my hand you can
[291.20 - 293.92] take it or smack it out of my hand you
[292.56 - 296.16] can smack it out of my hand I could take
[293.92 - 299.00] a good beating and give me a slap
[296.16 - 301.00] totally fine but you know but but take
[299.00 - 303.84] the golden ticket and that's what I tell
[301.00 - 305.20] everybody now because it really because
[303.84 - 306.80] I'm trying to give you the information
[305.20 - 309.16] when I was a young child and this
[306.80 - 310.40] information was just Advanced even
[309.16 - 313.96] though I didn't know what the hell it
[310.40 - 316.44] meant I had no clue what it meant 8 n 10
[313.96 - 319.16] years old excuse me 89 10 years old
[316.44 - 321.28] getting handed
[319.16 - 324.16] information about
[321.28 - 326.40] vidigo then information about multiple
[324.16 - 327.92] sclerosis then information about every
[326.40 - 330.20] single ache and pain and every single
[327.92 - 331.84] neurological twitching and all kinds of
[330.20 - 334.44] different symptoms including emotional
[331.84 - 336.96] psychological everything and getting the
[334.44 - 341.44] information it was Advanced and it was
[336.96 - 343.72] the same it was the same it was the same
[341.44 - 346.36] information it was you know and that's
[343.72 - 348.08] the and and and it's just Advanced right
[346.36 - 350.76] now that's the whole point it wasn't
[348.08 - 353.56] like oh okay Each decade went by and I
[350.76 - 355.92] took information from some book gleaned
[353.56 - 358.12] information from some Source never all
[355.92 - 360.52] the medical medium
[358.12 - 362.36] information it all starts from the
[360.52 - 363.96] original Source right here it starts
[362.36 - 366.40] from original Source from the books from
[363.96 - 368.40] me all the way going back to Childhood
[366.40 - 370.00] and it always has and it's been passed
[368.40 - 372.32] around a lot of it's been passed around
[370.00 - 374.84] and it's it's it's over the years and
[372.32 - 377.00] it's come back full circle to me where I
[374.84 - 380.56] where where it was started to begin with
[377.00 - 384.16] I'm saying all this because with chronic
[380.56 - 387.12] illness it has to be something above it
[384.16 - 389.52] has to be something bigger and above
[387.12 - 391.40] what's out there now because it's not
[389.52 - 393.64] working what's out there now I'm telling
[391.40 - 395.96] you right now it's not there are so many
[393.64 - 397.64] people sick so many people struggling
[395.96 - 400.20] I'm talking about every digestive order
[397.64 - 403.64] disorder there is every bloating
[400.20 - 405.36] constipation um Burning uh you know
[403.64 - 407.76] people's hands feel like they're on fire
[405.36 - 411.04] I mean I've seen it all aches and pains
[407.76 - 414.00] all over the body um skin rashes eczema
[411.04 - 416.68] stasis everything and people walk around
[414.00 - 418.40] suffering migraines headaches sinus
[416.68 - 421.12] infections chronic all the time lung
[418.40 - 423.52] problems breathing problems nowhere do
[421.12 - 425.64] they can get any help besides steroids
[423.52 - 427.96] and immunosuppressive drugs you know new
[425.64 - 429.92] inventions of immunosuppressive drugs so
[427.96 - 431.32] you tell me is science and research on
[429.92 - 433.32] the ball with chronic illness or they
[431.32 - 435.40] got it all squared up they got it all
[433.32 - 436.76] squared up huh just because you just
[435.40 - 438.48] because you're convinced at how good
[436.76 - 440.56] your car works right just because you're
[438.48 - 442.08] convinced on how good GPS works just
[440.56 - 443.52] because you're convinced on how good all
[442.08 - 446.44] the technology works you think
[443.52 - 447.88] everything else is sewed up just because
[446.44 - 450.48] they could remove an appendix for
[447.88 - 452.56] somebody and say their life which is
[450.48 - 455.04] amazing but you they got it all sewed up
[452.56 - 456.64] no they don't they don't and that's
[455.04 - 458.40] what's that a Vitiligo we're talking
[456.64 - 461.52] about I'm just covering a little bit one
[458.40 - 462.76] of the greatest mistakes with vidigo is
[461.52 - 465.36] and I'm just going to be straight up
[462.76 - 466.84] about this is that it's said out there
[465.36 - 468.60] in the industry and the alternative
[466.84 - 470.28] industry believes this too see the
[468.60 - 471.80] alternative industry Now isn't really
[470.28 - 473.16] the alternative industry it's just a
[471.80 - 475.92] conventional industry that's been kind
[473.16 - 477.92] of kind of uh shook up a little bit kind
[475.92 - 479.60] of a mixed bag of nuts it's not the
[477.92 - 482.36] alternative industry of the old days I'm
[479.60 - 484.16] just going to tell you right now and um
[482.36 - 485.72] so and believe me I love the
[484.16 - 487.48] conventional industry and I love the
[485.72 - 489.20] alternative industry I love the people
[487.48 - 491.04] that work in there it's not I'm not
[489.20 - 492.68] talking about the people I'm not talking
[491.04 - 495.80] about the people I'm talking about the
[492.68 - 498.00] hierarchy of these these these um these
[495.80 - 499.92] these industries yes there's a hierarchy
[498.00 - 502.72] to these industries sorry to say it but
[499.92 - 505.84] it's the truth so okay so here's the
[502.72 - 507.84] deal so um one of the greatest greatest
[505.84 - 509.24] mistakes with Vitiligo is the immune
[507.84 - 511.04] system attacking itself and the
[509.24 - 512.32] alternative industry adopted that so if
[511.04 - 513.60] you're walking around if you just got a
[512.32 - 515.92] diagnosis with
[513.60 - 517.84] viigo if you just got a diagnosis with
[515.92 - 519.24] viigo and you you know you walked into
[517.84 - 520.84] the doctor's office you came out of the
[519.24 - 523.40] doctor's office and it's just like well
[520.84 - 526.20] yeah and I just got a diagnosis that my
[523.40 - 529.44] body's attacking itself it's destroying
[526.20 - 531.48] something it's destroying something so
[529.44 - 533.56] Vitiligo is the whole thing with it is
[531.48 - 534.92] okay it's autoimmune that's what you get
[533.56 - 537.84] told it's
[534.92 - 542.28] autoimmune it's the belief that your own
[537.84 - 543.80] immune system is attacking its cells
[542.28 - 547.20] destroying
[543.80 - 549.56] melanocytes destroying melanin so the
[547.20 - 551.56] producer of melanin so this the pigment
[549.56 - 554.40] the pigment that makes the skin color so
[551.56 - 556.48] the cells are dying and they're dying
[554.40 - 557.84] because your immune system is destroying
[556.48 - 559.64] it so when you start getting the white
[557.84 - 562.08] patches or the white blotches or you
[559.64 - 563.40] start getting you can get all kinds of
[562.08 - 569.32] it can hit you in all kinds of different
[563.40 - 573.04] places with viig go but the thing is is
[569.32 - 574.76] with this understand that um that when
[573.04 - 576.40] we get told their body's attacking
[574.76 - 579.08] itself when we get told their immune
[576.40 - 580.48] system is destroying our pigment
[579.08 - 583.96] producing
[580.48 - 587.36] cells that's one great mistake we just
[583.96 - 590.16] started off with one unbelievable great
[587.36 - 594.04] mistake we just started off with and
[590.16 - 596.48] what happens is that mistake is concrete
[594.04 - 599.44] meaning it stays cemented it's
[596.48 - 601.00] grandfather law in it's grandfather in
[599.44 - 602.56] and I know I've talked about autoimmune
[601.00 - 604.64] with you guys so many times I'm not
[602.56 - 606.56] trying to bore you I'm not trying to
[604.64 - 608.48] throw you I promise I'm not trying to do
[606.56 - 610.84] anything like that I just have to tell
[608.48 - 613.72] you because when it comes down to viigo
[610.84 - 615.28] you walk out of the doctor's office just
[613.72 - 617.52] like you do when you have Hashimoto
[615.28 - 620.52] thyroiditis you walk out of the doctor's
[617.52 - 621.96] office and you're told you have you
[620.52 - 623.60] you're told you have a a problem with
[621.96 - 625.20] your thyroid you're imune your own
[623.60 - 627.00] immune system is destroying your thyroid
[625.20 - 628.28] tissue causing hashimi thyroiditis you
[627.00 - 630.76] know meaning causing thyroiditis
[628.28 - 632.04] swelling of the thyroid it's the same
[630.76 - 633.84] thing you walk out of the doctor's
[632.04 - 635.80] office with anything now it's your body
[633.84 - 636.88] attacking itself you walk out of the B
[635.80 - 639.56] the doctor's office now with
[636.88 - 641.72] fibromyalgia diagnosis oh that's
[639.56 - 644.64] overactive nerves because your immune
[641.72 - 646.16] system is is inflaming your nerves it's
[644.64 - 648.68] just it's
[646.16 - 651.40] unbelievable and oh it's genes by the
[648.68 - 653.48] way everything's genetic genetic genetic
[651.40 - 656.32] now throw everybody off the path throw
[653.48 - 659.36] everybody off the course it's
[656.32 - 661.72] unbelievable what's going on out there
[659.36 - 664.72] and you know spirit and I were the first
[661.72 - 667.72] were the first to bring to the world
[664.72 - 670.24] decades ago bring to the world a long
[667.72 - 673.16] time ago that Epstein bar is
[670.24 - 675.24] responsible for Ms it's responsible for
[673.16 - 677.88] fibromyalgia it's responsible for
[675.24 - 679.80] Hashimoto thyroiditis it's responsible
[677.88 - 682.36] and you know what happened the movement
[679.80 - 684.00] got so big you guys have spread the word
[682.36 - 685.52] the books got out there the information
[684.00 - 686.96] got out there and it shook up the
[685.52 - 689.12] industry you know what the industry did
[686.96 - 692.52] they put out a bogus study saying hey we
[689.12 - 696.36] now know that Epstein bar is linked is
[692.52 - 699.28] linked to so check this out linked to
[696.36 - 700.72] multiple sorosis fibromyalgia tashimo th
[699.28 - 702.08] we know it's linked it's a trick what
[700.72 - 704.72] that is is they're getting you to
[702.08 - 707.52] they're baiting you and then they tell
[704.72 - 709.36] you that it's not the cause though it's
[707.52 - 711.52] not the cause epine bar is the cause of
[709.36 - 712.68] all these different elses and they tell
[711.52 - 714.72] you it's not the cause they just tell
[712.68 - 717.68] you no it's your genes that are the
[714.72 - 720.04] cause and it's autoimmune still it just
[717.68 - 723.24] so happens Epstein bar might be a
[720.04 - 724.96] trigger it might be linked no Epstein
[723.24 - 726.76] bar is a cause this is this is done
[724.96 - 729.04] purposely so you get tricked so when you
[726.76 - 731.76] see these new articles out now those are
[729.04 - 733.60] actually traps set because of what we've
[731.76 - 735.04] done so far I know everybody's been
[733.60 - 737.08] excited in the groups saw on the
[735.04 - 738.56] Facebook groups and everything else that
[737.08 - 741.60] you know that the that there were some
[738.56 - 743.88] articles out there and it was like whoa
[741.60 - 745.64] hey science just discovered that epsteen
[743.88 - 747.20] bar is responsible for this and this and
[745.64 - 749.48] that everybody was cheering and I don't
[747.20 - 751.32] blame them but no it's it's not respond
[749.48 - 754.44] they they were saying it's link to or
[751.32 - 756.32] it's it's it's there's an affiliation no
[754.44 - 757.92] no that's not good enough because you'll
[756.32 - 759.88] you'll read through there and you'll see
[757.92 - 763.20] where they set the Trap they're trying
[759.88 - 765.12] to say don't don't believe the truth the
[763.20 - 766.96] truth got out there so stop believing
[765.12 - 768.72] the truth and then believe us cuz we're
[766.96 - 772.12] taking you down now the path of its
[768.72 - 775.24] genes and autoimmune still this is how
[772.12 - 777.56] it's done it's done and so it's really
[775.24 - 779.76] really demented actually demented it's
[777.56 - 782.52] it's it's sick because it's not about
[779.76 - 785.32] healing people it's not about healing
[782.52 - 786.88] anyone and even in the industrial I mean
[785.32 - 789.28] the the alternative medicine now it's
[786.88 - 791.32] all about infomercials and selling and
[789.28 - 796.04] selling and selling and selling things
[791.32 - 799.00] to make hundred million companies and
[796.04 - 801.04] Empires and me meanwhile no one wants to
[799.00 - 802.80] put out the truth no one wants to put
[801.04 - 804.36] out the free information and the truth
[802.80 - 807.08] we do that at Medical meeting for a
[804.36 - 811.08] reason we put that out there so Vitiligo
[807.08 - 812.24] so so I'm talking about all this because
[811.08 - 814.12] because it's not that I'm trying to
[812.24 - 816.20] throw you off course yet I'm going to go
[814.12 - 818.80] right into it we got a whole 45 minutes
[816.20 - 822.00] left here it it's just that the
[818.80 - 825.12] autoimmune diagnosis of Vigo is is is
[822.00 - 828.16] disgusting because it's it's so it's
[825.12 - 830.56] it's negligence it's negligence in its
[828.16 - 832.04] highest highest fashion and its highest
[830.56 - 835.64] order it's
[832.04 - 839.24] negligence by by E that even being there
[835.64 - 841.80] it's an instant instant cancellation of
[839.24 - 844.00] a person's ability to heal sure they
[841.80 - 845.80] might get get to a doctor that's throws
[844.00 - 847.44] a few fancy supplements in them and gets
[845.80 - 849.68] them on a better diet and sometimes some
[847.44 - 853.96] people improve and sometimes people get
[849.68 - 856.96] worse but the point is it's an
[853.96 - 860.24] instant stop you from healing just that
[856.96 - 863.48] diagnosis alone it's your body's own
[860.24 - 865.72] immune system attacking and destroying
[863.48 - 867.44] melanocytes attacking and destroying
[865.72 - 870.56] this the cells that produce melon in
[867.44 - 873.32] your pigment the T Ing and destroying
[870.56 - 874.68] that alone that alone and and they say
[873.32 - 876.40] okay well you know maybe stress is
[874.68 - 878.40] triggering it maybe something else is
[876.40 - 881.40] that alone but your body is still
[878.40 - 883.56] attacking itself is an instant we don't
[881.40 - 887.48] want you to heal that's what it is it's
[883.56 - 890.52] an instant industry rule that says we
[887.48 - 892.84] don't want you to heal from Vitiligo and
[890.52 - 895.28] we don't want you to know the truth and
[892.84 - 898.44] never know the truth of viigo we never
[895.28 - 901.80] want you to know the truth ever ever
[898.44 - 904.92] ever ever ever ever ever ever I'm
[901.80 - 907.84] serious I'm serious about that I'm
[904.92 - 910.00] serious and that's what that is so we
[907.84 - 912.68] have to break that I'm pretty intense
[910.00 - 914.36] today I know I know pretty intense I I
[912.68 - 916.52] don't sound like I have a lot of humor
[914.36 - 918.32] in in this today for some reason meaning
[916.52 - 920.68] like I'd like to keep lighthearted I
[918.32 - 923.48] like to have a little bit of humor in in
[920.68 - 926.16] there because we can heal and the humor
[923.48 - 929.36] is basically based on the Ridiculousness
[926.16 - 930.76] of the industries and and and how they
[929.36 - 932.76] take advantage of people and I try to
[930.76 - 934.32] keep lighthearted about this but today I
[932.76 - 936.96] I can't do it you know because I've just
[934.32 - 940.64] recently even talked to somebody a
[936.96 - 942.72] friend of mine a friend of mine um you
[940.64 - 944.00] know their their their child is vialo
[942.72 - 945.40] and they and they just went to the
[944.00 - 947.32] doctor they came back to the doctor and
[945.40 - 948.96] the friend said my friend said look the
[947.32 - 952.28] doctor said you know it's autoimmune
[948.96 - 953.84] there's nothing we can do um and you
[952.28 - 955.56] know and and what can we do and they
[953.84 - 957.52] said Anthony what can we do what can we
[955.56 - 959.48] do I said well I'm about to do a show on
[957.52 - 961.88] it so you can you'll you'll find out
[959.48 - 963.40] what we need to do during the show and
[961.88 - 965.84] and we'll get some and you know you'll
[963.40 - 969.60] have some clarity on the whole thing
[965.84 - 971.56] it's unbelievable how it works so here's
[969.60 - 973.08] the deal you know there there's
[971.56 - 974.60] something there's something out there
[973.08 - 978.60] that says okay well you you know
[974.60 - 982.88] Vitiligo can be triggered by exposure to
[978.60 - 987.48] Industrial chemicals that's the closest
[982.88 - 990.24] they've ever been to something real
[987.48 - 993.48] something real it's the closest they've
[990.24 - 997.28] ever been to Something Real so what this
[993.48 - 1000.80] means is if the industries science and
[997.28 - 1002.60] research has a theory that the exposure
[1000.80 - 1007.84] to Industrial
[1002.60 - 1012.20] chemicals possibly could trigger
[1007.84 - 1015.44] vidigo then I mean hats off hats off to
[1012.20 - 1018.60] him hats off to him a little bit I mean
[1015.44 - 1020.64] maybe a half hat maybe a half hat right
[1018.60 - 1022.56] um so because because there there's
[1020.64 - 1025.56] something I'm going to cover what that
[1022.56 - 1027.96] means they're saying exposure to the
[1025.56 - 1030.60] outside so they're saying exposure so
[1027.96 - 1032.76] say you work in a factory say you work
[1030.60 - 1035.64] somewhere and you're exposed to
[1032.76 - 1037.56] chemicals industrial chemicals and they
[1035.64 - 1038.84] noticed wait a minute someone gets F
[1037.56 - 1040.52] light and they don't know what it could
[1038.84 - 1043.04] be maybe it's the chemicals being
[1040.52 - 1045.40] exposed on the skin maybe it's chemicals
[1043.04 - 1046.28] being exposed in some way it's really
[1045.40 - 1049.56] not
[1046.28 - 1053.92] clear but what's happening is is there
[1049.56 - 1057.84] re there is industrial chemicals in
[1053.92 - 1062.00] everybody who has Vitiligo there is
[1057.84 - 1066.08] industrial chemicals industrial toxins
[1062.00 - 1069.92] deep within the body since birth or
[1066.08 - 1072.48] after birth or during childhood and
[1069.92 - 1074.24] these industrial chemicals you guys
[1072.48 - 1077.00] these industrial
[1074.24 - 1081.64] chemicals are they
[1077.00 - 1083.20] are part of why we have Vigo so but but
[1081.64 - 1084.92] the but but but the medical industry and
[1083.20 - 1086.60] science research they don't know that
[1084.92 - 1088.56] part they're thinking it's like an
[1086.60 - 1089.96] exposure to maybe the outside of the
[1088.56 - 1091.56] body they're thinking like it's an
[1089.96 - 1094.12] exposure I mean hats off they're even
[1091.56 - 1095.72] thinking that but we're talking about
[1094.12 - 1097.04] the real we're talking about the truth
[1095.72 - 1100.04] we're talking about the real stuff we
[1097.04 - 1103.24] don't play around with the bull we don't
[1100.04 - 1105.80] play around with people and their health
[1103.24 - 1109.08] it's all about getting it right because
[1105.80 - 1110.60] you has to be right it has to be right
[1109.08 - 1112.92] we don't throw you guys a whole bunch of
[1110.60 - 1114.28] crazy bogus cleanses out there in the
[1112.92 - 1115.76] world and all the different books that
[1114.28 - 1117.52] are out there now it's like they have
[1115.76 - 1119.52] all these different programs and stuff
[1117.52 - 1121.96] like that I mean we don't throw anything
[1119.52 - 1123.52] like that out at you because you know a
[1121.96 - 1125.04] a lot of those things are just not going
[1123.52 - 1126.12] to be right they're not going to be
[1125.04 - 1128.36] right they're not even going to have
[1126.12 - 1130.84] celery juice in them in order to get you
[1128.36 - 1132.72] better it's always got to be right when
[1130.84 - 1134.36] we have to get somebody better when we
[1132.72 - 1136.92] have to figure out what the truth is and
[1134.36 - 1139.48] what we need to do so these industrial
[1136.92 - 1143.80] chemicals they actually sit inside the
[1139.48 - 1145.76] body of everybody deep down and then
[1143.80 - 1149.24] that's just one part of it there's more
[1145.76 - 1150.96] to it than that there's more to that so
[1149.24 - 1153.36] it takes more than that it takes the
[1150.96 - 1156.56] industrial chemicals whatever those
[1153.36 - 1158.56] might be from the past toxic heavy metal
[1156.56 - 1160.60] exposure passed on from generation to
[1158.56 - 1166.12] generation to generation which may make
[1160.60 - 1169.84] it look like it is genetic when it's not
[1166.12 - 1172.80] genetic so toxic sotic heavy metals you
[1169.84 - 1176.04] know um all the different metals that I
[1172.80 - 1178.88] talk about all the time copper aluminum
[1176.04 - 1181.68] Mercy you know lead just all the
[1178.88 - 1184.32] different ones cadmium you know nickel
[1181.68 - 1185.44] arsenic just lots of different metals
[1184.32 - 1187.08] and then there's got to be something
[1185.44 - 1189.52] else though there's got to be another
[1187.08 - 1191.00] thing one other thing that has to happen
[1189.52 - 1193.08] there has to be something called
[1191.00 - 1196.24] oxidation the
[1193.08 - 1198.20] metals need to be
[1196.24 - 1200.88] oxidizing they need to be oxidizing
[1198.20 - 1202.88] izing meaning to cause Vitiligo they
[1200.88 - 1205.20] need to be oxidizing to cause
[1202.88 - 1209.48] Vitiligo and when they
[1205.20 - 1210.88] oxidize they they run you know what that
[1209.48 - 1212.16] means is run it's not like somebody
[1210.88 - 1216.20] jogging somebody
[1212.16 - 1220.04] running what it means is the metals they
[1216.20 - 1223.60] they corrode and when they corrode they
[1220.04 - 1225.84] blow up the metals blow up that's what
[1223.60 - 1228.92] they do that's what they do so the
[1225.84 - 1230.76] metals actually blow up aluminum
[1228.92 - 1234.16] is a big part of
[1230.76 - 1236.64] Vitiligo aluminum that's a big one
[1234.16 - 1239.44] that's a really big one for Vitiligo and
[1236.64 - 1242.08] the aluminum has to sit inside the liver
[1239.44 - 1245.04] it has to sit inside the liver and
[1242.08 - 1248.00] that's what it does it sits in there and
[1245.04 - 1250.08] then the aluminum interacts and reacts
[1248.00 - 1252.08] with other metals well that's what the
[1250.08 - 1253.72] aluminum does it interacts and reacts
[1252.08 - 1258.64] with other
[1253.72 - 1261.00] metals and then it blows up large
[1258.64 - 1263.00] but it needs something to blow up large
[1261.00 - 1266.52] with something to cause it and that's
[1263.00 - 1268.76] fats high fat diets so high fat diets
[1266.52 - 1270.68] are an instigator for
[1268.76 - 1272.20] Vitiligo a lot of times when somebody
[1270.68 - 1274.48] cleans up their diet they're still
[1272.20 - 1276.56] eating high fat but they got rid of
[1274.48 - 1278.08] other fats too they got rid of so many
[1276.56 - 1280.12] fats in their diet that they didn't know
[1278.08 - 1281.72] it but they threw away processed foods
[1280.12 - 1286.04] that were filled with fat they threw
[1281.72 - 1287.60] away other fatty foods and they changed
[1286.04 - 1289.84] over their diet cleaned up their diet
[1287.60 - 1291.96] whether an animal protein diet a you
[1289.84 - 1294.44] know paleo diet a vegan diet a
[1291.96 - 1295.80] plant-based diet a whatever kind of diet
[1294.44 - 1297.44] there is out there you throw away the
[1295.80 - 1299.04] process foods you end up blowing your
[1297.44 - 1300.88] fat a little bit because you're probably
[1299.04 - 1303.28] throwing away lots of different other
[1300.88 - 1305.40] fatty sources along with the normal fats
[1303.28 - 1308.04] that you eat every day like meat and
[1305.40 - 1309.96] everything else and then so you start
[1308.04 - 1311.12] and a lot of people with Vitiligo you
[1309.96 - 1313.16] start seeing a little bit of a
[1311.12 - 1314.32] difference not everybody but some people
[1313.16 - 1316.52] start getting a little bit of a
[1314.32 - 1319.00] difference going on that's because the
[1316.52 - 1322.00] fats have reduced in their diet diet and
[1319.00 - 1324.04] the fats get inside the liver and they
[1322.00 - 1325.64] actually cause the reason why you want
[1324.04 - 1328.72] to reduce these fats in your diet is
[1325.64 - 1333.84] they get inside the liver and what they
[1328.72 - 1337.64] do is they oxidize the metals quickly
[1333.84 - 1340.60] they oxidize the aluminum quickly so
[1337.64 - 1344.08] aluminum with the fat on it will then
[1340.60 - 1346.04] oxidize it'll blow up it'll blow up what
[1344.08 - 1348.48] does that mean blow up well cons you
[1346.04 - 1350.20] know just like if you take a balloon
[1348.48 - 1352.44] little rubber balloon you start blowing
[1350.20 - 1355.24] into it and it starts to blow up with
[1352.44 - 1358.04] air starts to fill up with air well the
[1355.24 - 1360.68] the the luminum yeah little bits of
[1358.04 - 1364.04] micro aluminum that's right little bits
[1360.68 - 1367.48] of aluminum just like Nano
[1364.04 - 1371.12] aluminum and when this aluminum gets
[1367.48 - 1373.52] starts to oxidize it starts to expand
[1371.12 - 1375.56] starts to expand and that's why the high
[1373.52 - 1377.48] fat diets are so bad for Alzheimer's and
[1375.56 - 1381.56] so bad for because any kind of metals
[1377.48 - 1384.48] like mer Mercury inside the brain and
[1381.56 - 1386.92] aluminum Mercury inside the brain and
[1384.48 - 1389.28] you got and you got a high-fat diet
[1386.92 - 1390.60] going on and that's why when people go
[1389.28 - 1391.92] off their processed food diets and
[1390.60 - 1393.28] they're saying hey I got somebody with
[1391.92 - 1394.92] alzheimer's they're starting to come
[1393.28 - 1396.36] around a little they're they weren't
[1394.92 - 1398.00] that advanced to begin with but they
[1396.36 - 1399.56] were they were you know they were they
[1398.00 - 1400.88] were having problems they weren't you
[1399.56 - 1402.64] know they weren't F they weren't
[1400.88 - 1404.36] functioning right and they were and I
[1402.64 - 1406.64] and and and I went to this doctor and he
[1404.36 - 1409.24] put them on this special remove whatever
[1406.64 - 1410.96] out of your diet and and whatever and
[1409.24 - 1412.88] what he the doctor did was removed
[1410.96 - 1416.32] without realizing it a lot of processed
[1412.88 - 1418.12] foods with bad fats but then still kept
[1416.32 - 1419.64] the diet a high fat diet because the
[1418.12 - 1421.40] doctor could have done a lot better than
[1419.64 - 1424.20] that if the doctor lowered the fats
[1421.40 - 1427.24] altogether in the diet like we talk
[1424.20 - 1428.60] about here and you know I mean then
[1427.24 - 1430.88] forget it you can get somebody with
[1428.60 - 1432.40] alzheimer's even backtrack even more to
[1430.88 - 1436.20] to where they remember all a sudden a
[1432.40 - 1439.00] relative's name or a sibling's name or
[1436.20 - 1440.84] something and um or a loved one's name
[1439.00 - 1442.68] and they remember and you can go even
[1440.84 - 1445.64] further than that but nobody knows that
[1442.68 - 1449.76] yet by the way you guys so so so the
[1445.64 - 1451.60] deal is the deal is with Vitiligo is you
[1449.76 - 1454.72] get this aluminum it's sitting inside
[1451.60 - 1456.84] sitting inside the liver and aluminum is
[1454.72 - 1460.64] is a
[1456.84 - 1462.60] destructive destructive industrial Toxin
[1460.64 - 1464.44] and how did you get aluminum inside your
[1462.60 - 1466.40] liver what do you mean you just we pass
[1464.44 - 1468.72] it on from generation to
[1466.40 - 1471.48] generation how do you get how do you get
[1468.72 - 1473.36] aluminum inside the uh liver I mean
[1471.48 - 1475.24] medical practices there's there's
[1473.36 - 1478.44] Medical Treatments that just are filled
[1475.24 - 1481.04] with aluminum I mean everything
[1478.44 - 1483.80] deodorant for you young adults using
[1481.04 - 1486.56] lots of aluminum based deodorant I mean
[1483.80 - 1489.60] aluminum in in toothpaste I mean just
[1486.56 - 1490.92] loads of aluminum in everything aluminum
[1489.60 - 1493.60] in the water
[1490.92 - 1495.44] supply there's aluminum in everything I
[1493.60 - 1497.52] mean it's just we're saturated in
[1495.44 - 1500.68] aluminum just like where we got so much
[1497.52 - 1504.40] mer pery going on but that aluminum
[1500.68 - 1506.60] that's responsible for viigo so what do
[1504.40 - 1508.68] would so you know where I'm going right
[1506.60 - 1510.80] you you you guys know where I'm going
[1508.68 - 1513.28] you know where I'm heading I hope hope
[1510.80 - 1514.36] you know where I'm heading so that
[1513.28 - 1516.36] that's what's going on with that
[1514.36 - 1518.52] aluminum so that aluminum with along
[1516.36 - 1520.40] with a really you know high-fat diet
[1518.52 - 1522.92] which is basically standard American and
[1520.40 - 1525.48] even and even healthy
[1522.92 - 1527.76] American that that high fat those High
[1525.48 - 1529.28] fats whether they're even healthy fats
[1527.76 - 1532.00] too they
[1529.28 - 1533.96] oxidize they oxidize that aluminum and
[1532.00 - 1535.76] then something else has to happen I'm
[1533.96 - 1538.12] telling you a story it's like a bedtime
[1535.76 - 1540.16] story it's like a nice little bedtime
[1538.12 - 1542.88] story I'm telling
[1540.16 - 1545.24] you it's like a bedtime story I mean you
[1542.88 - 1548.12] know or it's like a campfire a Scary
[1545.24 - 1550.84] Campfire story you know so then there's
[1548.12 - 1554.12] something else that has to be there
[1550.84 - 1556.60] inside our liver it can't just be
[1554.12 - 1559.28] aluminum and then the fats building up
[1556.60 - 1562.92] inside the liver and then the oxidizing
[1559.28 - 1564.96] of the aluminum the expansion of the
[1562.92 - 1568.24] aluminum there has to be one other thing
[1564.96 - 1569.52] you you know what it is it's a virus
[1568.24 - 1572.48] it's a
[1569.52 - 1576.84] virus and so the
[1572.48 - 1580.20] virus has to be present really low grade
[1576.84 - 1584.40] not even anything serious the
[1580.20 - 1587.40] mildest low grade viral
[1584.40 - 1590.36] condition yes Epstein bar is a big big
[1587.40 - 1594.56] big one for this but other viruses can
[1590.36 - 1598.76] do it too all the hh's all the HH v6s
[1594.56 - 1601.60] and sevens and the hh10 and 11s you
[1598.76 - 1603.40] epine bar is a common one that does it
[1601.60 - 1606.84] and even the shingles inside the liver
[1603.40 - 1608.36] can do this I mean it can there's a lot
[1606.84 - 1609.84] of different herpetic viruses that can
[1608.36 - 1612.68] sit inside the liver I mean there's so
[1609.84 - 1614.48] many there's multitudes of them and so
[1612.68 - 1616.60] when that virus and that Epstein bar
[1614.48 - 1620.20] sitting inside the liver it
[1616.60 - 1622.80] feeds it feeds off of the aluminum now
[1620.20 - 1624.24] in the case of eimos soris it has to
[1622.80 - 1627.32] feed off of
[1624.24 - 1629.08] copper it has to feed off of copper to
[1627.32 - 1631.84] give you the
[1629.08 - 1633.84] eczema but in in when it comes down to
[1631.84 - 1637.00] Vitiligo it has to feed off of the
[1633.84 - 1638.80] aluminum runoff the aluminum expansion
[1637.00 - 1640.56] the aluminum that's blowing up the
[1638.80 - 1643.80] aluminum that's
[1640.56 - 1646.36] oxidizing it has to feed off the
[1643.80 - 1649.84] aluminum and it does it feeds off this
[1646.36 - 1653.00] industrial toxin yes this industrial
[1649.84 - 1654.84] Toxin and you know I mean
[1653.00 - 1658.24] seriously
[1654.84 - 1660.24] seriously and and what happens is that
[1658.24 - 1662.44] when the virus feeds off the industrial
[1660.24 - 1665.52] toxin aluminum the the runoff the
[1662.44 - 1668.08] oxidative Alum aluminum it then goes the
[1665.52 - 1669.68] bathroom it eats it which is something
[1668.08 - 1672.32] else research and science doesn't even
[1669.68 - 1674.64] know the viruses eat they eat to stay
[1672.32 - 1677.60] alive they eat to reproduce they eat to
[1674.64 - 1679.88] stay stay functioning they they fuel
[1677.60 - 1682.80] they fuel themselves right through the
[1679.88 - 1684.88] membrane of the virus they fuel
[1682.80 - 1686.36] themselves and research and science
[1684.88 - 1688.00] doesn't know that yet and if they do
[1686.36 - 1690.08] know it they don't want you to know it
[1688.00 - 1691.68] how about that okay if you think they're
[1690.08 - 1693.68] that smart then let's give them benefit
[1691.68 - 1695.24] of Doubt and say they do know it but how
[1693.68 - 1697.16] come they won't tell anybody how come
[1695.24 - 1699.60] they tell everybody that viruses don't
[1697.16 - 1702.52] eat anything well then you know then
[1699.60 - 1703.56] they're lying to you okay whatever
[1702.52 - 1705.16] however you want to look at it they're
[1703.56 - 1706.56] lying if they know or they're they're
[1705.16 - 1708.20] stupid they don't know whatever you want
[1706.56 - 1711.80] to do whatever whichever direction you
[1708.20 - 1714.24] want to go so and you know so viruses
[1711.80 - 1716.60] they feed off and then they release it
[1714.24 - 1720.32] when they release a poison the poison
[1716.60 - 1724.96] has to go to the skin it has to travel
[1720.32 - 1729.72] and go to the skin aluminum oxidative
[1724.96 - 1733.88] methyl aluminum being eliminated from a
[1729.72 - 1736.24] virus creates a type of dermatoxin a
[1733.88 - 1740.08] different kind of
[1736.24 - 1745.88] dermatoxin that that inevitably can
[1740.08 - 1748.20] affect yes affect pigment creating cells
[1745.88 - 1751.88] so it can affect the melanocytes it can
[1748.20 - 1754.52] affect the melanin it can affect it and
[1751.88 - 1756.88] what happens is when that toxin surfaces
[1754.52 - 1758.48] to those pigment cells there's a
[1756.88 - 1760.76] reaction that happens that science and
[1758.48 - 1763.48] research will never touch upon I mean
[1760.76 - 1765.16] honestly not in my lifetime and I don't
[1763.48 - 1767.56] even know if our in our children's
[1765.16 - 1770.16] lifetime or their lifetime I just don't
[1767.56 - 1772.64] know if they can go there it's just too
[1770.16 - 1776.16] advanced it's pain it's
[1772.64 - 1778.20] painful and so you know what happens is
[1776.16 - 1780.36] that that dermatoxin it becomes a
[1778.20 - 1781.96] dermatoxin it surfaces the areas of the
[1780.36 - 1785.60] body different skin
[1781.96 - 1789.76] areas and it explodes the cells there's
[1785.60 - 1791.72] a reaction that occurs with a pigment to
[1789.76 - 1794.00] oxidative aluminum that's been
[1791.72 - 1796.84] eliminated out of a
[1794.00 - 1798.40] virus that's been eliminated out of a
[1796.84 - 1800.64] virus
[1798.40 - 1803.40] and it's in a different
[1800.64 - 1807.64] state and so it it it's it's in a
[1803.40 - 1810.12] corruptive state and that poison
[1807.64 - 1813.00] industrial poison and viruses are
[1810.12 - 1814.76] industrial too yeah they are got to say
[1813.00 - 1816.80] it they're industrial too many of them
[1814.76 - 1819.60] not all of them but many many of them
[1816.80 - 1822.40] are industrial and so this industrial
[1819.60 - 1824.00] this all of this it's an industry thing
[1822.40 - 1825.36] so that's why I said hats off to medical
[1824.00 - 1827.12] research and science when they're like
[1825.36 - 1828.52] exposure to Industrial chemicals which
[1827.12 - 1831.76] they meant you're just working in a
[1828.52 - 1834.88] factory and you've been sprayed by brake
[1831.76 - 1837.88] cleaner carburetor cleaner you know some
[1834.88 - 1840.48] kind of cleaning agent that's you know
[1837.88 - 1842.60] just toxic no I'm not talking about and
[1840.48 - 1845.96] what happens with those is those can
[1842.60 - 1847.24] those have aluminum in it yes all that
[1845.96 - 1848.84] could have aluminum in it but they don't
[1847.24 - 1851.60] know that meaning they don't know that's
[1848.84 - 1853.12] what's happening and that aluminum can
[1851.60 - 1854.80] go into the liver so if you're somebody
[1853.12 - 1856.04] exposed to a lot more toxic chemicals
[1854.80 - 1857.72] than somebody else then you're getting
[1856.04 - 1859.68] more aluminum and then more aluminum
[1857.72 - 1862.48] goes inside the liver then more than it
[1859.68 - 1864.40] can do what it's doing and oxid oxidize
[1862.48 - 1865.88] and expand and everything I just said it
[1864.40 - 1867.88] can
[1865.88 - 1870.32] do and there's different varieties of
[1867.88 - 1872.44] Vitiligo because there's different
[1870.32 - 1874.84] situations it it all depends on where
[1872.44 - 1877.24] the toxins traveling in someone someone
[1874.84 - 1879.28] may exercise a lot someone may be active
[1877.24 - 1880.84] it it can travel further it can go into
[1879.28 - 1882.08] different places it could go to all
[1880.84 - 1884.12] kinds of different areas it can go to
[1882.08 - 1886.52] the eyes it can go to the it can go to
[1884.12 - 1888.32] the ears it can go to the the lymphatic
[1886.52 - 1890.00] system of often times it goes to the
[1888.32 - 1891.60] face on a lot of people because it heads
[1890.00 - 1894.04] up to the lymphatic system goes to the
[1891.60 - 1895.60] knees because the lymphatic system can
[1894.04 - 1897.88] you know it all depends on what they're
[1895.60 - 1899.68] doing do they sit on the couch a lot do
[1897.88 - 1902.28] they sit on the couch a lot with their
[1899.68 - 1904.20] feet up and they watch TV you know like
[1902.28 - 1905.96] like like I do too much of yeah no I
[1904.20 - 1909.72] wish I had the time to do
[1905.96 - 1911.68] that that's my dream that's my dream
[1909.72 - 1914.40] okay is to actually take one day off
[1911.68 - 1916.48] writing the books and actually watch
[1914.40 - 1918.52] watch a funny show or something or watch
[1916.48 - 1920.48] a funny movie maybe I'll be able to do
[1918.52 - 1922.96] it 10 years from
[1920.48 - 1925.32] now maybe people maybe people are
[1922.96 - 1927.56] sitting on the couch a lot maybe they're
[1925.32 - 1930.56] standing all day or maybe they're
[1927.56 - 1933.48] working and standing all day maybe
[1930.56 - 1936.24] they're sitting all day maybe people are
[1933.48 - 1938.68] exercising more maybe people aren't
[1936.24 - 1940.36] maybe people you everything is different
[1938.68 - 1941.92] with someone also how their liver is
[1940.36 - 1943.56] working how their liers functioning are
[1941.92 - 1944.84] there other poisons and toxins and
[1943.56 - 1947.36] different things and bugs and other
[1944.84 - 1950.48] stuff inside their livers everything is
[1947.36 - 1952.80] different to how it can develop like
[1950.48 - 1955.76] where the dermatoxin can lie where the
[1952.80 - 1958.36] dermatoxin can go and travel to what
[1955.76 - 1961.24] joint to what part of the body to what
[1958.36 - 1963.20] area to what lymphatic area to through
[1961.24 - 1966.32] the bloodstream to what direction
[1963.20 - 1968.16] because you remember the liver releases
[1966.32 - 1970.40] all this stuff right out of the
[1968.16 - 1972.12] bloodstream right up through the you
[1970.40 - 1973.56] know Paddock portal vein right up to the
[1972.12 - 1975.72] heart right up to it pumps through the
[1973.56 - 1977.52] body and then it you know it finds its
[1975.72 - 1981.20] way in all kinds of areas and lymphatic
[1977.52 - 1984.80] system and every else and it travels and
[1981.20 - 1988.20] travels and so you know it can give you
[1984.80 - 1992.12] different situations with this now why
[1988.20 - 1994.76] does stress play a role as a
[1992.12 - 1997.00] trigger stress is a trigger isn't it
[1994.76 - 1998.16] interesting whoa it's a it's a you know
[1997.00 - 1999.72] and that's the thing that's what's funny
[1998.16 - 2001.20] about research in science I hate being
[1999.72 - 2003.20] that hard on Research in science because
[2001.20 - 2005.20] I love science I absolutely love it
[2003.20 - 2007.44] because how can I not love it what
[2005.20 - 2008.96] spirit gives me is nothing but science
[2007.44 - 2011.48] science that's undiscovered but nothing
[2008.96 - 2014.04] but science how can I not love
[2011.48 - 2015.56] science so you know yeah okay there's
[2014.04 - 2016.96] bogus science out there in the world
[2015.56 - 2018.56] yeah and it's the thumbs on the scale
[2016.96 - 2020.76] like I said so but the point is I still
[2018.56 - 2022.40] love the fact that there's science and
[2020.76 - 2023.80] there's good science too I mean there's
[2022.40 - 2025.52] fantastic stuff out there too it's
[2023.80 - 2029.84] amazing achievements going on out there
[2025.52 - 2034.28] it's incredible but the bottom line is
[2029.84 - 2036.16] the bottom line is is this is that you
[2034.28 - 2037.76] know science comes up with oh well
[2036.16 - 2041.56] stress can trigger
[2037.76 - 2043.84] viigo okay yeah well why and how is that
[2041.56 - 2045.56] 50 years from now we learn or is that 80
[2043.84 - 2048.08] years from now we learn no learn this
[2045.56 - 2049.80] now learn it now okay I and I've been
[2048.08 - 2051.80] talking about this for years going back
[2049.80 - 2054.04] and back and back I love when someone
[2051.80 - 2055.36] says says to me oh you've been you're
[2054.04 - 2058.08] the medical meeting what when did you
[2055.36 - 2059.72] start three years ago or something oh
[2058.08 - 2061.96] three years ago oh how about when I was
[2059.72 - 2063.64] three years old well it's four years old
[2061.96 - 2065.68] but you know what I mean it's four years
[2063.64 - 2067.60] old is when it started but I just you
[2065.68 - 2069.12] know I'm just saying if someone says how
[2067.60 - 2070.72] when did you start 5 years ago I'd be
[2069.12 - 2073.20] like yeah how about 5 years
[2070.72 - 2076.20] old you know how about when I was a
[2073.20 - 2077.96] child is what I mean and so you know the
[2076.20 - 2079.40] bottom line is with stress is stress is
[2077.96 - 2081.24] a trigger for a couple of reasons
[2079.40 - 2084.04] because what stress does is stress
[2081.24 - 2086.24] weakens the immune system and then
[2084.04 - 2087.52] allows a virus to actually Thrive a
[2086.24 - 2089.24] little better remember I said you have
[2087.52 - 2090.60] to have a virus inside the liver too so
[2089.24 - 2092.20] people with Vitiligo have to have a
[2090.60 - 2093.60] little bit of Epstein bar sitting inside
[2092.20 - 2095.64] the liver also they have to have the
[2093.60 - 2097.20] aluminum and it aluminum has to be also
[2095.64 - 2099.52] oxidizing from a high fat diet
[2097.20 - 2104.08] throughout the years years
[2099.52 - 2105.80] before and so what happens is the stress
[2104.08 - 2107.32] the stress lowers the immune system a
[2105.80 - 2108.76] little bit which gives the Epstein B
[2107.32 - 2111.04] virus a little bit more of a kick it
[2108.76 - 2112.32] could it actually fuel itself eat a
[2111.04 - 2115.16] little bit more now how does it fuel
[2112.32 - 2116.56] itself because of adrenaline too you're
[2115.16 - 2119.68] under a lot of stress you're under a lot
[2116.56 - 2121.24] of adrenaline adrenaline feeds viruses I
[2119.68 - 2124.12] talk about that in medical medium book
[2121.24 - 2126.24] one you know adrenaline feeds
[2124.12 - 2129.12] viruses and when adrenaline feeds
[2126.24 - 2131.84] viruses then viruses fuel up they get
[2129.12 - 2133.48] stronger um and so therefore you have
[2131.84 - 2134.72] the stress trigger right there you see
[2133.48 - 2138.04] how it
[2134.72 - 2141.16] works so it's a really important to
[2138.04 - 2142.56] understand and um because because we're
[2141.16 - 2144.76] going to be under stress but we can do
[2142.56 - 2147.92] something about it look I'm under stress
[2144.76 - 2150.64] I'm under stress I'm always under stress
[2147.92 - 2153.08] and um I'm sure I'm sure a lot of you
[2150.64 - 2155.56] guys are too I'm sure a lot of you guys
[2153.08 - 2159.20] are too I mean I mean it's easy to be
[2155.56 - 2162.16] under that it's easy to be under that so
[2159.20 - 2164.72] stress is a big trigger but but just
[2162.16 - 2168.88] saying stress is a trigger is is an
[2164.72 - 2172.80] insult what about the answers to why it
[2168.88 - 2175.12] is you know and that's how you win you
[2172.80 - 2176.64] win when you have the answers you win
[2175.12 - 2179.68] when you have the truth you win when you
[2176.64 - 2181.88] know what to do what can we do now what
[2179.68 - 2185.08] can we do well we certainly can't lower
[2181.88 - 2186.44] our stress really I mean we can try to
[2185.08 - 2188.28] we can take care of ourselves the best
[2186.44 - 2190.44] we can we can try to lower our stress we
[2188.28 - 2191.88] can try to take care of ourselves in
[2190.44 - 2193.64] different ways sure there's ways of
[2191.88 - 2195.24] lowering stress I mean in medical medium
[2193.64 - 2198.44] book one I did all the healing
[2195.24 - 2201.16] meditations in there and you know
[2198.44 - 2203.28] there's there's lots of ways to cope and
[2201.16 - 2207.84] deal with our stress and really
[2203.28 - 2209.72] help but even with that being said the
[2207.84 - 2213.36] crap's still going to hit the fan
[2209.72 - 2214.96] somewhere it always does I mean you know
[2213.36 - 2216.68] there you always still have to die out
[2214.96 - 2218.60] fires and I talk about that all the time
[2216.68 - 2222.36] there's always fires to die
[2218.60 - 2224.40] out and that's how life is so we can't
[2222.36 - 2226.64] control that we can't have this full
[2224.40 - 2230.80] control over that so what do we do one
[2226.64 - 2234.76] of the things we do is we a we get the
[2230.80 - 2237.96] aluminum out of our liver to get rid of
[2234.76 - 2239.72] Vitiligo we do that by eating better we
[2237.96 - 2242.64] do that by eating a little bit of a
[2239.72 - 2245.36] lower fat diet whatever aisle you sit on
[2242.64 - 2247.44] whatever that is and I you know and I'm
[2245.36 - 2249.00] not into the propaganda thing just
[2247.44 - 2250.92] everybody's throwing propaganda at
[2249.00 - 2254.56] themselves at each other out there I'm
[2250.92 - 2256.24] not into that I'm not into like in naleo
[2254.56 - 2258.00] picking on the vegans like they do and
[2256.24 - 2260.08] the plant-based people which I think is
[2258.00 - 2262.20] totally unfair because the plant-based
[2260.08 - 2265.12] people it's very small it's it's just a
[2262.20 - 2268.08] very small crew in the country it's
[2265.12 - 2269.96] really small when you think about it and
[2268.08 - 2272.44] then you know and then the mediating
[2269.96 - 2274.80] World um why are the hospitals filled
[2272.44 - 2276.92] and filled filled with sick people and
[2274.80 - 2279.40] oh my God dentist offices are filled
[2276.92 - 2282.44] with rotting teeth I mean drilling root
[2279.40 - 2285.28] canal root canals pulling teeth implants
[2282.44 - 2286.88] dentures and they're not all vegans I
[2285.28 - 2288.80] mean the vegans are really small so it's
[2286.88 - 2290.76] unfair when the paleos do that and then
[2288.80 - 2293.28] the vegans pick on the Paleo people and
[2290.76 - 2294.84] they pick on the uh and they pick on the
[2293.28 - 2297.24] meat eaters which is you know which is
[2294.84 - 2299.48] unfair too which is unfair too because
[2297.24 - 2301.56] then they throw at them you know all
[2299.48 - 2303.64] kinds of stuff they throw out all kinds
[2301.56 - 2305.60] of stuff at them and you know like I get
[2303.64 - 2307.28] it but it's like they they're both
[2305.60 - 2308.32] attacking each other and it's it's kind
[2307.28 - 2311.32] of
[2308.32 - 2313.28] unfair because no one's using no one has
[2311.32 - 2315.64] the truth in their hand it's all like
[2313.28 - 2317.48] they're throwing theories or bogus paid
[2315.64 - 2319.56] science and studies to try to out
[2317.48 - 2321.36] science themselves everybody's so upset
[2319.56 - 2323.00] they're all out sciencing themselves
[2321.36 - 2325.32] with bogus science with science it's
[2323.00 - 2327.04] actually just crazy and it's just and
[2325.32 - 2328.92] they're just you know no we got higher
[2327.04 - 2330.48] protein no we got higher protein we got
[2328.92 - 2331.96] better this no we got better that and
[2330.48 - 2334.96] it's just this battle out there
[2331.96 - 2338.08] meanwhile people are just staying
[2334.96 - 2339.28] sick because they don't know what to do
[2338.08 - 2340.64] and so what I'm saying is whether you're
[2339.28 - 2342.24] vegan or plant-based or whether you're
[2340.64 - 2344.24] paleo whether you're you're immediate or
[2342.24 - 2346.36] it doesn't matter to me what matters to
[2344.24 - 2349.48] me is you lower your
[2346.36 - 2351.40] fats you lower them down you lower them
[2349.48 - 2352.68] your down you lower them down with viigo
[2351.40 - 2354.24] so what I'm trying to tell you is if
[2352.68 - 2354.96] you're you're a happy meat eater and you
[2354.24 - 2357.36] got
[2354.96 - 2360.76] Vitiligo cut the meats down to once a
[2357.36 - 2364.12] day not twice a day cut it down once a
[2360.76 - 2366.28] day maybe even once every other day you
[2364.12 - 2368.00] know throw an avocado in there whatever
[2366.28 - 2369.72] you want to do throw some other things
[2368.00 - 2371.88] throw an avocado in there throw throw a
[2369.72 - 2373.16] little bit of plant fat to offset it the
[2371.88 - 2374.52] plant Fat's a little easier in the
[2373.16 - 2375.72] system I'm just saying when you're sick
[2374.52 - 2377.40] with something and you have a liver
[2375.72 - 2379.68] problem like Vitiligo which is really a
[2377.40 - 2381.08] liver problem in the end yes you want to
[2379.68 - 2383.28] do that you want to lower your fats and
[2381.08 - 2385.16] if you're plant-based cut the nuts out
[2383.28 - 2386.80] cut the nuts out kill the nuts
[2385.16 - 2388.08] altogether I mean I love nuts and
[2386.80 - 2390.52] they're they're healthy they believe me
[2388.08 - 2391.72] they're healthy for people but if you
[2390.52 - 2394.64] got
[2391.72 - 2397.08] Vitiligo kill the nuts drop the nuts
[2394.64 - 2399.04] back watch the cash used drop them back
[2397.08 - 2401.40] a little bit you know Watch the watch
[2399.04 - 2403.08] the walnuts drop them back a little bit
[2401.40 - 2404.72] watch the sunflower seats drop them back
[2403.08 - 2406.24] a little bit yeah maybe bring some more
[2404.72 - 2410.16] hemp seeds instead they're a little bit
[2406.24 - 2412.08] healthier you know and so so the point
[2410.16 - 2414.40] is is that we just got to lower the fats
[2412.08 - 2417.96] a little bit drop the oils both sides
[2414.40 - 2421.00] both sides drop the oils bring them
[2417.96 - 2422.88] down and then and then you because
[2421.00 - 2424.52] everybody's now gluten-free for the most
[2422.88 - 2426.40] Parts everybody's glut gluten- free
[2424.52 - 2428.00] they're wheat free they're gluten free
[2426.40 - 2429.88] most people are getting grainfree I mean
[2428.00 - 2432.56] you could still have quenan get rid of
[2429.88 - 2434.44] vtil you know Vio you can still do that
[2432.56 - 2437.68] get rid of Vio you can you can get
[2434.44 - 2440.64] quinoa you can get you know you can have
[2437.68 - 2442.76] Millet you can have you can even have
[2440.64 - 2446.04] some black beans in there and still get
[2442.76 - 2448.52] get get rid of viigo you can still do
[2446.04 - 2450.52] that you can still do that but just
[2448.52 - 2452.68] lower the fats because that's another
[2450.52 - 2455.12] thing too if you believe in oatmeal you
[2452.68 - 2457.56] can still get rid of Vitiligo because
[2455.12 - 2458.96] oatmeal essentially it's not it's not
[2457.56 - 2460.76] going to cause that much harm at all I
[2458.96 - 2463.00] mean it's it's actually I've seen it
[2460.76 - 2465.16] help people I've seen it help a lot of
[2463.00 - 2466.80] people doesn't hurt a lot of people I've
[2465.16 - 2469.00] seen it help people I've seen people
[2466.80 - 2471.84] heal from Vitiligo and still have
[2469.00 - 2473.84] oatmeal so it's there's this big war out
[2471.84 - 2476.72] there it's like no grains Everything is
[2473.84 - 2479.12] grainfree Everything no grain and high
[2476.72 - 2481.12] fat high protein high fat high protein
[2479.12 - 2482.24] and you know who suffers in the end from
[2481.12 - 2484.72] all that
[2482.24 - 2487.64] misinformation the person with Vitiligo
[2484.72 - 2489.28] the person with Hashimoto thyroid is the
[2487.64 - 2490.60] person with you know all kinds of
[2489.28 - 2493.40] different
[2490.60 - 2495.32] things you know whatever whatever I mean
[2493.40 - 2496.96] there's so many different illnesses I
[2495.32 - 2499.16] mean I could bore you with the list it's
[2496.96 - 2501.24] just the list can go on but the bottom
[2499.16 - 2502.64] line is if you bring down those fats a
[2501.24 - 2504.92] little bit guess what's going to happen
[2502.64 - 2507.32] you're not going to oxidize the aluminum
[2504.92 - 2509.72] you're not going to oxidize the
[2507.32 - 2512.16] aluminum the aluminum inside your liver
[2509.72 - 2514.28] if you have this condition if you have
[2512.16 - 2516.76] this condition you're not going to
[2514.28 - 2519.56] oxidize the aluminum
[2516.76 - 2521.16] and therefore that Viral issue you have
[2519.56 - 2523.64] inside the liver that's feeding off of
[2521.16 - 2527.76] the oxidized aluminum and feeding off of
[2523.64 - 2530.52] that crusted aluminum in there that's
[2527.76 - 2532.68] expanding from oxidizing from the high
[2530.52 - 2534.48] fats if the virus isn't able the feed
[2532.68 - 2535.96] off of all the oxidation you just won
[2534.48 - 2537.48] the battle right there by lowering your
[2535.96 - 2540.00] fats in your diet and I don't care what
[2537.48 - 2542.84] trend I don't care what expert goes on
[2540.00 - 2544.44] some show where there's a TV show that's
[2542.84 - 2547.60] common where a bunch of doctors I don't
[2544.44 - 2548.84] care who's on what
[2547.60 - 2551.60] they still don't know about these
[2548.84 - 2552.92] chronic illnesses I know that for a fact
[2551.60 - 2555.56] that they don't know about these chronic
[2552.92 - 2557.76] illnesses and what's really behind them
[2555.56 - 2560.08] instead it's just all about eating in a
[2557.76 - 2562.24] trendy way that somebody believes in
[2560.08 - 2564.00] that some guy believes in that doesn't
[2562.24 - 2566.08] understand women's health is completely
[2564.00 - 2567.96] different and some guy who goes to the
[2566.08 - 2570.48] gym who never really had anything wrong
[2567.96 - 2572.40] with them as nice and fit and exercises
[2570.48 - 2574.52] every day doesn't know what it's like to
[2572.40 - 2576.60] have an illness or a condition like
[2574.52 - 2579.36] millions and millions of women out there
[2576.60 - 2581.44] and men too but then all of a sudden
[2579.36 - 2584.24] it's like a spokesperson for some trendy
[2581.44 - 2587.36] diet so an Empire can be built that's
[2584.24 - 2589.08] demented it's deranged actually I'm
[2587.36 - 2591.08] talking about what about the answers to
[2589.08 - 2592.60] getting people better what about that
[2591.08 - 2593.80] what about the information to turn their
[2592.60 - 2594.88] lives around so what's the first thing
[2593.80 - 2597.28] we need to
[2594.88 - 2598.96] do first thing we need to do I said is
[2597.28 - 2600.80] we got to lower the fats no matter what
[2598.96 - 2602.84] aisle you sit on you got to lower the
[2600.80 - 2604.08] fats I'm not anti-animal protein I'm not
[2602.84 - 2606.92] anti- plant-based I'm not
[2604.08 - 2610.04] anti-vegetarian you just I well
[2606.92 - 2612.44] you can't do eggs you can't do eggs in
[2610.04 - 2614.72] dairy products and yes of course nobody
[2612.44 - 2617.92] should be on gluten but you can't do
[2614.72 - 2620.24] eggs and dairy products I don't care
[2617.92 - 2622.44] what kind of dairy product you like if
[2620.24 - 2625.28] you got a condition you can't be doing
[2622.44 - 2627.24] it you're just going to feed viruses and
[2625.28 - 2628.60] feed the Epstein bars to create these
[2627.24 - 2632.96] conditions and everything else and you
[2628.60 - 2636.68] can't do it you got to keep those out
[2632.96 - 2638.92] you know I'm I'm tired of seeing
[2636.68 - 2641.04] egg is the perfect food out there cuz I
[2638.92 - 2643.48] know it's just going to create more PCOS
[2641.04 - 2645.52] in women more cysts more tumors more
[2643.48 - 2648.36] cancers more breast cancers from Epstein
[2645.52 - 2650.60] bar more conditions more multiple
[2648.36 - 2652.36] sclerosis more fibromyalgia more Lyme
[2650.60 - 2654.48] disease more whatever it's going to keep
[2652.36 - 2656.16] on creating conditions and you know
[2654.48 - 2658.24] what's tricky you get tricked because
[2656.16 - 2660.08] you get a semi-healthy person like say
[2658.24 - 2662.92] somebody who's 29 years old or a woman
[2660.08 - 2664.72] that's 29 years old and and they're
[2662.92 - 2666.84] eating their eggs they're promoting it
[2664.72 - 2668.56] all online and they're all like eggs
[2666.84 - 2670.60] eggs eggs and they don't you know and
[2668.56 - 2673.08] you just don't understand that you can't
[2670.60 - 2675.48] equate that to what can happen 15 years
[2673.08 - 2677.40] down the road when they're sitting there
[2675.48 - 2678.68] getting like hysterectomies and when
[2677.40 - 2681.36] they're sitting there getting all kinds
[2678.68 - 2683.44] of problems because those eggs literally
[2681.36 - 2684.80] caused the worst fibroids down the road
[2683.44 - 2686.68] 15 years down the road so it's a
[2684.80 - 2688.12] misconception same with men you know
[2686.68 - 2689.76] with the eggs and everything meanwhile
[2688.12 - 2692.56] when they end up getting prostate cancer
[2689.76 - 2694.32] when they're 58 years old and yeah it
[2692.56 - 2695.96] was all cute when they were 28 and
[2694.32 - 2697.80] saying they eat their two eggs a day
[2695.96 - 2699.40] they're on this new protocol and whatnot
[2697.80 - 2701.16] meanwhile the egg is feeding the epine
[2699.40 - 2702.36] bar virus inside the prostate creating
[2701.16 - 2705.44] prostate cancer they end up with
[2702.36 - 2707.32] prostate cancer at at 58 it's all fun in
[2705.44 - 2709.64] games and it's all deception and
[2707.32 - 2712.72] deceiving and nobody really knows how it
[2709.64 - 2714.48] works so keep away from the eggs so we
[2712.72 - 2715.76] don't want to eat the eggs we don't want
[2714.48 - 2718.40] to do that don't want to feed the
[2715.76 - 2721.88] viruses that create Vitiligo the other
[2718.40 - 2725.40] thing is we want to remove the toxic
[2721.88 - 2728.08] heavy metals out of our liver that's the
[2725.40 - 2729.92] other people that's so critical and
[2728.08 - 2732.68] that's that's the key removing the
[2729.92 - 2736.36] aluminum and the aluminum runoff the
[2732.68 - 2738.04] aluminum oxidation so we lower the fats
[2736.36 - 2740.08] we lower the fats we get rid of
[2738.04 - 2742.36] instigators that feed viruses so there's
[2740.08 - 2744.12] a few steps you have to do and you can
[2742.36 - 2747.16] do one of these steps and get
[2744.12 - 2749.40] improvements with Vitiligo you can you
[2747.16 - 2751.52] can reverse that condition you can
[2749.40 - 2755.48] literally reverse that condition there's
[2751.52 - 2757.28] ways of doing it and being free so what
[2755.48 - 2761.28] happens is you lower the fats in the
[2757.28 - 2763.16] diet like I said that alone stops the
[2761.28 - 2766.04] ability or slows down the ability to
[2763.16 - 2768.20] oxidize the aluminum then you remove
[2766.04 - 2770.40] foods like the eggs and the dairy
[2768.20 - 2773.60] products and the gluten that feed
[2770.40 - 2775.48] Epstein bar virus or other viruses so so
[2773.60 - 2777.84] that they don't keep on proliferating
[2775.48 - 2779.56] and growing stronger and then feeding
[2777.84 - 2783.56] off of the aluminum so that's another
[2779.56 - 2785.44] step that's another step third step now
[2783.56 - 2787.96] you're now it's about removing the
[2785.44 - 2791.32] alumin itself and if you can only do
[2787.96 - 2792.40] that step hey I'm fine I'm totally fine
[2791.32 - 2794.40] and you know the thing is with the
[2792.40 - 2796.40] celery juice the celery juice movement
[2794.40 - 2798.12] that Spirit started and that you guys
[2796.40 - 2799.84] you know you guys took off on I mean
[2798.12 - 2801.68] honestly because you guys are Champs and
[2799.84 - 2803.40] did the celery juice and changing your
[2801.68 - 2806.32] your life and other people's lives it's
[2803.40 - 2808.16] unbelievable the celery juice the celery
[2806.32 - 2810.48] juice alone is helping people with
[2808.16 - 2813.08] Vitiligo I hear about it all the time
[2810.48 - 2814.96] you do because the celery juice the the
[2813.08 - 2816.20] the cluster salt sodium salts that I
[2814.96 - 2817.96] talked about in Facebook Faceook live
[2816.20 - 2819.88] and I talk about it go check out the
[2817.96 - 2824.28] Facebook live someday too that I did on
[2819.88 - 2826.60] on celery it it you know it the celery
[2824.28 - 2829.32] sodium celery salts what what it does is
[2826.60 - 2831.40] it dissolves the membrane on the viruses
[2829.32 - 2833.20] like the like the surface membrane and
[2831.40 - 2834.64] it starts to destroy the epine bar virus
[2833.20 - 2837.00] that's why celery juice is so critical
[2834.64 - 2839.56] for Vitiligo and critical for every
[2837.00 - 2842.08] disease illness condition and symptom
[2839.56 - 2845.80] celery juice everything across the board
[2842.08 - 2849.16] it's good for so you got that going
[2845.80 - 2852.48] going on okay but the heavy metal detox
[2849.16 - 2855.68] smoothie the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2852.48 - 2857.84] spirulina the barley grass juice powder
[2855.68 - 2860.52] okay the spirulina the barley grass
[2857.84 - 2862.72] juice powder don't get confused I saw
[2860.52 - 2865.96] somebody get barley grass powder no no
[2862.72 - 2867.24] no no barleygrass juice powder so you
[2865.96 - 2869.36] know and then you get spiruline the
[2867.24 - 2871.64] barley grass juice powder you got the
[2869.36 - 2874.08] you got that and I like vimergy I like
[2871.64 - 2876.72] vimergy for those and then you got like
[2874.08 - 2878.64] and then you you know you got the the
[2876.72 - 2880.84] cilantro in there you got the wild
[2878.64 - 2883.32] blueberries you know the whole deal you
[2880.84 - 2886.24] know the drill a little bit of dols
[2883.32 - 2888.24] these in the combination can get into
[2886.24 - 2891.32] the liver the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2888.24 - 2893.32] into the liver bind onto aluminum runoff
[2891.32 - 2896.64] bind on to aluminum and start bringing
[2893.32 - 2898.80] it out so if you do these steps you do
[2896.64 - 2901.76] the heavy metal detox smoothie you do
[2898.80 - 2904.08] the celery juice you take eggs and dairy
[2901.76 - 2905.36] and gluten out of the diet and that's
[2904.08 - 2907.40] the thing there's people that get a
[2905.36 - 2909.56] little better with Vitiligo and other
[2907.40 - 2912.00] things because they took gluten out but
[2909.56 - 2913.52] yet here's the here's the irony I mean
[2912.00 - 2915.12] here's what's unbelievable yet the
[2913.52 - 2916.48] practitioner or the program that it was
[2915.12 - 2918.20] in or the cleanse it was in or the
[2916.48 - 2920.00] doctor that that was talking about it or
[2918.20 - 2921.84] whatever was on television or whatever
[2920.00 - 2923.64] whoever was talking about the gluten
[2921.84 - 2925.16] doesn't even know the gluten was feeding
[2923.64 - 2928.24] the
[2925.16 - 2930.00] virus that was behind any illness or
[2928.24 - 2932.48] condition the person was suffering
[2930.00 - 2934.36] from and so you take out the eggs the
[2932.48 - 2936.40] gluten the you know the you take out the
[2934.36 - 2938.20] milk the cheese the butter but you take
[2936.40 - 2940.36] all of it I don't care if it's grass-fed
[2938.20 - 2942.20] butter you get rid of it because it's
[2940.36 - 2944.20] going to feed a viral condition keep the
[2942.20 - 2945.88] Vitiligo around but you take those out
[2944.20 - 2947.44] then you lower your fats a little bit so
[2945.88 - 2949.44] if you like animal proteins bring them
[2947.44 - 2951.76] down a notch if you got a really bad
[2949.44 - 2954.20] case of Vitiligo bring them down more
[2951.76 - 2956.08] every other day every other day you do
[2954.20 - 2957.04] it and then you know you do other things
[2956.08 - 2960.28] other
[2957.04 - 2961.96] days and that's that's how you do it
[2960.28 - 2963.52] that's the power of it that's the power
[2961.96 - 2965.08] of the foods and the different that's
[2963.52 - 2967.36] what's in your hand so I can hand you
[2965.08 - 2969.84] the golden t like I said which are these
[2967.36 - 2972.32] things which can totally turn around
[2969.84 - 2974.68] Vitiligo or you know or you can smack it
[2972.32 - 2979.88] out of my hand whatever whatever
[2974.68 - 2982.12] whatever and um so here's the deal okay
[2979.88 - 2983.68] if it's overwhelming if this is too much
[2982.12 - 2985.24] and you just these things are too much
[2983.68 - 2987.32] alone like you might be saying well what
[2985.24 - 2989.28] do I eat how do I eat what do I do how
[2987.32 - 2992.48] do I do it you know the medical medium
[2989.28 - 2994.48] the 28 day um eating with the 28-day
[2992.48 - 2996.56] eating cleanse and medical medium that's
[2994.48 - 2998.52] a good way of actually really jumping
[2996.56 - 3000.52] ahead so whether you're a meat eater or
[2998.52 - 3002.84] you're plant-based you do this for a
[3000.52 - 3005.48] month and you jump ahead another thing
[3002.84 - 3007.80] too is a thyroid the 90-day thyroid you
[3005.48 - 3010.84] know healing and and um and thyroid
[3007.80 - 3012.40] healing the the 90 days where you just
[3010.84 - 3014.28] work on your thyroid where you got three
[3012.40 - 3016.36] months and you work in there you can
[3014.28 - 3018.76] pick a month any month in there can help
[3016.36 - 3021.32] with figgo it can help with the liver it
[3018.76 - 3023.56] can help with all of it but keeping your
[3021.32 - 3025.68] fats low bringing in more fruits and
[3023.56 - 3027.60] vegetables don't be don't don't have
[3025.68 - 3030.32] fruit fear if you have fruit fear then
[3027.60 - 3034.24] you're going to have a difficult time
[3030.32 - 3035.96] healing and and and reversing thego
[3034.24 - 3039.16] you're going to have a more difficult
[3035.96 - 3040.84] time so you want to make sure that
[3039.16 - 3042.64] you're not afraid of fruits you're not
[3040.84 - 3044.40] afraid of more apples you're not afraid
[3042.64 - 3045.88] of a few grapes you're not afraid of
[3044.40 - 3047.68] some banana you're not afraid of these
[3045.88 - 3051.20] things these things are really important
[3047.68 - 3053.72] to reversing this condition and salads
[3051.20 - 3056.00] and leafy greens so you know all the
[3053.72 - 3058.24] different leafy greens spinach mosh you
[3056.00 - 3060.44] know even leafy herbs little parsley
[3058.24 - 3062.72] little cilantro all these things matter
[3060.44 - 3064.88] lots of butter lettuces red leaf lettuce
[3062.72 - 3066.76] green leaf lettuce green leaf kale
[3064.88 - 3069.00] Dinosaur Kale just a little bit in some
[3066.76 - 3071.88] of your food wherever you can that's a
[3069.00 - 3076.52] really an incredible weapon tomatoes are
[3071.88 - 3078.00] amazing the the the man it's so I'm you
[3076.52 - 3079.24] know the thing is with tomatoes is I get
[3078.00 - 3080.52] really kind of emotional about it for a
[3079.24 - 3082.52] second because they're under attack
[3080.52 - 3085.60] right now once again the very thing it
[3082.52 - 3088.40] took years to get people back on to
[3085.60 - 3090.20] tomatoes to it took it took me years to
[3088.40 - 3092.80] get them using Tomatoes they don't get
[3090.20 - 3094.36] certain cancers so they actually don't
[3092.80 - 3097.00] get problems with their eyes so they
[3094.36 - 3099.20] don't get glaucoma so they don't get eye
[3097.00 - 3100.68] eye degeneration so they don't get all
[3099.20 - 3104.80] kinds of different conditions and
[3100.68 - 3106.20] problems and and so tomatoes are really
[3104.80 - 3107.88] helpful bring in tomatoes lots of
[3106.20 - 3109.68] cucumbers bring in those you can bring
[3107.88 - 3112.56] in some avocado bring in a few nuts and
[3109.68 - 3114.24] seeds don't overdo them and you can
[3112.56 - 3116.60] bring in all the different vegetables
[3114.24 - 3118.44] broccoli cauliflower flour you can bring
[3116.60 - 3121.20] in all the different things but the more
[3118.44 - 3122.88] fruits and vegetables you bring in you
[3121.20 - 3126.40] you actually help heal yourself from
[3122.88 - 3128.20] vitil Lago you really do and potatoes
[3126.40 - 3130.32] that's a secret weapon for Vitiligo too
[3128.20 - 3132.20] sweet potatoes butternut squash bring

[3142.68 - 3147.36] viigo and supplement wise on hly I I
[3146.00 - 3148.88] wouldn't even you know with the
[3147.36 - 3151.00] supplements you can do a few different
