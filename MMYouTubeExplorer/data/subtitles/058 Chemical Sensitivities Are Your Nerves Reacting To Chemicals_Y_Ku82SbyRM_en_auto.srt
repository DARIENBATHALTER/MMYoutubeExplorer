that people are still told they're crazy

153
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,240
it's better than it ever was that's true

154
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,039
it's better than it was many years ago

155
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,199
but people still have a hard time with

156
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:11,000
their family the people around them with

157
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,039
their friends with their co-workers they

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,319
still have a very hard time there are

159
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,919
people that work in an office they're

160
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,879
sitting next to somebody who has all

161
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,960
that Fabrics off and are just whoosing

162
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,919
off of them and it's giving them a hard

163
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,639
time they're getting symptoms they don't

164
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,919
feel good but they have to live with it

165
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,599
it's better than it was people do

166
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,479
understand a a little bit doctors are

167
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:38,080
looking out for people in a better way

168
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,759
but it's still hard it's still difficult

169
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,680
many situations people do things on

170
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,840
spite when somebody's chemical sensitive

171
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
and they complain a little too much

172
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,479
because they're trying to protect

173
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,800
themselves let's face it because they

174
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,599
need help and they're looking for some

175
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,360
kind of relief so they can function and

176
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:00,879
then somebody on spite does something to

177
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,199
them purposely to make their situation

178
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,520
worse like wearing more cologne or even

179
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,759
more perfume on spite someone working

180
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,080
with them will say hey can you dial it

181
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,599
down I'm really sensitive to your

182
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,800
perfume then that person sprays two more

183
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,400
sprays of perfume on them purposely when

184
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,599
someone's not chemical sensitive they'll

185
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,800
never understand they just can't cuz

186
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,400
it's not bothering them it's hard to

187
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,680
connect with that person who's chemical

188
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,279
sensitive because they're smelling

189
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,479
things but it's not bugging them at all

190
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,320
they're wearing perfumes cologn they got

191
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,880
the air fresheners they don't care about

192
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,279
gasoline they don't care about exhaust

193
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,680
fumes they don't care about smoke in the

194
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,920
air they'll sit in front of a fire pit

195
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,399
while the fire pit is burning treated

196
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,600
wood with chemicals in it so they can't

197
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
relate it's not possible while that

198
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,480
other person who's chemically sensitive

199
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
that knows they're chemically sensitive

200
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,079
though cuz there's two different

201
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,240
chemical sensitives out there there's

202
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:03,800
one that don't know and have no idea

203
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,440
it's affecting them in any way and ones

204
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,040
that do know and the ones that do know

205
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,079
know that the fire pits bothering their

206
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,079
sinuses making their chest all tight

207
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:15,959
making them not feel good they know the

208
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,120
air fresheners are making them sick they

209
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,440
know the Colones and perfumes are waking

210
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,160
out their nervous systems they know

211
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,360
these things and to the other person

212
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,079
they sound like they're hypochondriacs

213
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,800
and that they're crazy but they're not

214
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,000
this doesn't mean the person who can

215
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,160
handle all that smoke from treated wood

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,839
burning or handle all that perfume on

217
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,800
their body is

218
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,480
indestructible they can just get cancer

219
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,680
and die they can have a heart attack

220
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,519
tomorrow they can be going along

221
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,399
everything's great they smell everything

222
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,320
they're happy they got chemicals all on

223
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,640
their body they're breathing in

224
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,800
pesticides in their yard as they're

225
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,720
spraying their flowers They're doing all

226
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,000
that they look indestructible they're

227
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,560
fine they don't smell anything all is

228
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,480
good they're not reacting and then they

229
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,480
go drop dead 10 years later and it also

230
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,279
doesn't mean that they're never going to

231
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,959
become chemical sensitive in their life

232
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,600
see that's not true either they could

233
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:12,839
become chemical sensitive down the road

234
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,839
in fact they could become chemical

235
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,720
sensitive and not even know it so as

236
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,839
they got that fabric softener cooking in

237
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,720
the dryer and they got that detergent

238
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,560
and they got all kinds of chemicals

239
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,959
cleaning products that are actually

240
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,640
dangerous in their house and they're

241
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,440
breathing it all in while they're trying

242
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,519
to kill a spider with a can of toxic

243
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,760
pesticide while they're doing all of

244
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,880
this and breathing in all kinds of crazy

245
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,959
stuff they can become chemical sensitive

246
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,480
get symptoms from it run to a 100

247
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,839
doctors and not realize all those

248
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,000
chemicals are pushing their body over

249
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,320
the edge now what does chemical

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,279
sensitive even mean what's really

251
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,360
happening why is one person reacting to

252
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,160
a chemical or some type of agent or

253
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,440
solvent or some kind of toxic stuff

254
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,000
that's in the air or on their skin when

255
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,079
another person isn't because their scale

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,920
is tipped someone becomes chemical

257
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,040
sensitive because they're being

258
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,279
triggered the chemicals whatever form or

259
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,160
shape they're in are triggering them

260
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,279
they're lowering their immune system

261
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,160
which is already lowered they're

262
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,560
antagonizing their nervous system which

263
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,240
is already inflamed they're

264
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,440
overburdening the liver which is already

265
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,760
overburdened and the chemicals are

266
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,519
acting as a trigger which is feeding

267
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,600
pathogens and bugs which were already

268
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,760
being fed by other chemicals in the

269
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,079
person's body because the scale has been

270
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,440
tipped earlier on and the person who

271
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,120
isn't chemical sensitive isn't having a

272
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,560
situation where their liver is

273
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,440
overflowing with toxins they're not

274
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,040
quite there yet with all the triggers

275
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,639
now they may have some of these things

276
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,519
going on a pathogen or two in their body

277
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,040
creating all kinds of stuff Underneath

278
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,160
It All they may have sensitivities but

279
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,800
they're not quite showing themselves yet

280
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,160
and they may have inflammation and it's

281
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,519
not quite fully there yet but they're on

282
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,040
their way they're just not totally

283
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,639
spilled over and tipped over like the

284
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,519
other person is by medical medium

285
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,920
standards information that was released

286
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,279
in Liver Rescue and in other places

287
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,199
through medical medium information when

288
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,639
someone's chemically sensitive their

289
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,760
liver is overburdened stagnant and

290
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,680
sluggish and overworked

291
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,199
this is when the liver becomes a fatty

292
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,959
liver even if non-diagnosed not

293
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,079
diagnosed as a fatty liver the liver's

294
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,360
not functioning good it's stagnant it's

295
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:45,160
sluggish it's not awake it's dense it's

296
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,000
overburdened it's hardening up why does

297
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,839
this happened because of a lifestyle in

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,720
combination of pathogens such as viruses

299
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:59,360
like Epstein bar shingles Cirus herplex

300
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,800
1 herplex 2 hhv6 hhv7

301
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,279
viruses inside the liver trapped in

302
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,880
there living in there working on tissue

303
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,040
making it more dense making it more

304
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,680
problematic and weakening the immune

305
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,839
system inside the liver along with

306
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,320
toxins poisons like fragrances other

307
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,760
toxins and poisons and heavy metals

308
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,720
Mercury aluminum copper cadmium lead

309
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,240
arsenic nickel and even toxic calcium

310
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,040
along with a thousand other chemicals

311
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,639
that found their way into the filter

312
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,639
your filter the liver it's there

313
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,040
filtering your blood filtering what's

314
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,760
going into your intestinal tract and up

315
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,480
the stream of blood into the liver and

316
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,880
that filter your liver can have 10,000

317
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,480
chemicals that are foreign to the human

318
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,360
body 10,000 chemicals from chemical

319
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,560
companies from the chemical industry

320
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,240
just sitting inside the liver and when

321
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,759
your liver gets tired stagnant and

322
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,199
sluggish and it's not working as good as

323
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,560
it should then something goes wrong then

324
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:09,759
conversion doesn't happen like it needs

325
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,120
to the conversion of nutrients

326
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,600
methylation becomes stagnant and

327
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,040
sluggish when nutrients enter your body

328
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,839
from Foods they get to the liver and

329
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,000
they're supposed to be blessed by the

330
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,759
liver converted and they can't so

331
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,120
methylation starts to go downhill and

332
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,440
the person starts to become nutrient

333
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,360
deficient while this is happening though

334
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,360
a lot of different symptoms can occur

335
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,800
and a lot of different conditions can

336
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,000
happen like pre-diabetes type 2

337
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,759
diabetes blood sugar inconsistencies

338
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,800
hypoglycemia

339
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,680
hypoglycemia and then cholesterol

340
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,600
problems as well but when the liver is

341
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,360
stagnant sluggish tired overburdened and

342
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,160
overworked something else can happen

343
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,519
especially if the liver is filled with

344
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,040
pathogens and toxins and toxic heavy

345
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,519
metals when it's f filled with all of

346
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:07,800
those something not great occurs a

347
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:10,440
spillover the liver can't hold on to all

348
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,000
the garbage dump stuff anymore it has to

349
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,120
release some it has to let go and when

350
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,519
it lets go it's a spill and what does

351
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,120
that spill contain pathogens release out

352
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,959
of their viral cells and bacterial cells

353
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,360
lots of different neurotoxins and

354
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,959
poisons and garbage and junk and then

355
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,800
toxic heavy metals that are sitting in

356
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:34,079
the liver for a life time start to

357
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,240
oxidize start to gas out start to pocket

358
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,839
out and that debris starts to spread and

359
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,839
leave the liver too and then depending

360
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,319
on the pathogens that are sitting inside

361
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,480
the liver some of those pathogens like

362
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:50,199
Epstein bar will feed off of copper feed

363
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,680
off of aluminum and mercury and release

364
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:55,240
all kinds of toxic heavy metal

365
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,079
neurotoxins out of the viral cells and

366
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,240
into the bloodstream and then the liver

367
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,920
can't filter like it's supposed to

368
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,759
anymore it's not being a good filter

369
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,480
it's trying to be a good filter but it's

370
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,600
overflowing there's a spill and that

371
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,079
spill can be random at any time it can

372
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,360
be when you eat something one day it can

373
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,240
be when you wake up one morning it can

374
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,319
be in the middle of the day sometime

375
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,680
when you're exercising it could be when

376
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:25,839
you're walking but these spills are

377
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,160
random they happen at any time and when

378
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,120
there's a spill the concoction is

379
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,600
different in every single person one

380
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,519
person may have more heavy metals one

381
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,720
person may have one variety of a heavy

382
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,279
metal more so than other varieties of

383
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,759
heavy metals another person might have

384
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,759
one virus another person could have a

385
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,839
100 viruses another person can have

386
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,480
solvents and all kinds of different

387
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,000
pharmaceutical compounds when someone

388
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,880
else might have a whole bunch of

389
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,279
recreational drugs inside their liver

390
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,240
and somebody else may have all kinds of

391
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,800
different fossil fuels and all kinds of

392
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,400
other different toxins and

393
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,319
petrochemicals everybody's blend of

394
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,199
toxins is different and those toxins

395
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,600
bother the central nervous system most

396
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:18,280
of chemical sensitivity symptoms are

397
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,559
central nervous system based nerve based

398
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,000
when somebody's spill is filled with all

399
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,959
kinds of different toxins from toxic C

400
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,160
metals and from pathogens and other

401
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,320
chemicals and they actually leave the

402
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,280
liver they attack themselves to the

403
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,360
nerves so most symptoms in the chemical

404
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,480
sensitivity world are from nervous

405
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,559
system symptoms nervous systems that are

406
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,440
inflamed and hypers sensitive and then

407
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,960
another portion of symptoms in the

408
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,960
chemical sensitivity World those are

409
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,039
skin issues and swelling issues this is

410
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,080
when the spill is a different recipe of

411
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:59,360
chemicals and toxins and pathogen debris

412
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,120
and somebody's skin can react

413
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,000
hives different kind of red blotches

414
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,720
different kind of spots itchy bumps all

415
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,039
kinds of different skin conditions and

416
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,799
then swelling swelling in the knuckles

417
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,640
stiffness in the knuckles swelling in

418
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,480
the hands swelling in the elbows

419
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,440
lymphatic swelling lymphadema all

420
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,720
through the body all kinds of different

421
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,480
water retention all these symptoms can

422
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,200
really perplex people complicate their

423
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,679
lives and confuse their doctor their

424
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,600
practitioners their healthc care

425
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,200
providers their health coaches their

426
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,159
therapists their

427
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,799
psychiatrists all of them can get

428
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,280
confused by these symptoms and people

429
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,880
get diagnosed with all kinds of

430
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,240
different mental conditions because of

431
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,559
chemical sensitivities people will tell

432
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,679
them well we think we have OCD right

433
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:53,080
here or ADHD or add or we have bipolar

434
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,919
or some other condition they get

435
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,960
diagnosed with because they're sitting

436
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,799
there worried and they have anxiety

437
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,960
they're worried about the carpet being

438
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,320
hold from underneath them they're

439
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,120
worried about going down they're worried

440
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,480
about can't get in their car they have

441
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,280
panic attacks anxiety conditions all

442
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,200
kinds of different symptoms and they're

443
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,159
nervous and they're living their life

444
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,360
extra nervous because of it and it's

445
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,880
like a snowball going down a mountain

446
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,960
side where it's just going down and

447
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,200
Gathering all this debris and getting

448
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,880
larger and larger and larger until it

449
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,720
finally just spills onto a village it's

450
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,440
that concerning that difficult and that

451
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,679
complex one of the biggest fears that

452
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,799
people who have chemical sensitivities

453
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,000
have is the dentist chair if a dentist

454
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:40,159
wears latex gloves and the hygienist

455
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,320
wears latex gloves that's a big concern

456
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,679
for people who are chemical sensitive if

457
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,559
the dentist is using fluoride or wants

458
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,039
to offer fluoride treatment that's

459
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,720
another big concern and then it's the

460
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,120
numbing agents people who are chemical

461
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,600
sensitive are concerned about the

462
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,480
numbing agents lidocaine Novocaine

463
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,840
carbocaine septian all the different

464
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,280
numbing agents they're worried including

465
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,840
the numbing gels so what happens is

466
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,679
they'll take a Q-tip they'll stick it

467
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,080
into some numbing gel they'll put it

468
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,640
around a gum line and that's a big

469
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,640
concern for people who are chemical

470
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,679
sensitive another thing is getting

471
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,200
fillings removed or fillings put in if

472
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,640
it's old fillings whether they're

473
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,679
composits of some kind or Mercury

474
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,600
fillings that are old people who are

475
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,120
chemical sensitive either react or

476
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,320
they're really concerned and they're

477
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,480
telling their dentist this their dentist

478
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,600
if they know them as a patient their

479
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,320
dentist is wise to it many dentists are

480
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,000
worried because it could be like Russian

481
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,919
Roulette they don't know what's going to

482
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,480
happen in that moment how the person's

483
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,640
going to react what's going to happen is

484
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,480
a symptom going to develop it's very

485
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,159
hard for the patient and for dentists

486
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,840
often what happens with chemical

487
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:55,240
sensitive people is they're reacting but

488
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,799
yet they're blaming something that did

489
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,640
not cause the reaction many times

490
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,480
somebody could be eating something and

491
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,640
then they get a reaction but what they

492
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,159
ate did not cause the reaction they were

493
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,520
going to have a spill anyway or they had

494
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,200
a spill an hour before they ate

495
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,880
something and it took time for that

496
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,720
spill to create a reaction and it's

497
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,240
possible that what they were eating was

498
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,320
only helpful to their problem and not

499
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,080
hurtful but they wouldn't know that

500
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,840
because they had a spill long before and

501
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,080
now they're reacting and they think it

502
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,400
was that strawberry they ate or they'll

503
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,000
blame the wrong food mixed in with a

504
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,520
whole bunch of foods like they'll have a

505
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,760
piece of chocolate cake that had a

506
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,760
strawberry on top after they eat the

507
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,679
chocolate cake they get a reaction half

508
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,480
hour later or 45 minutes later and then

509
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,000
they blame the strawberry that was on

510
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,159
top of the cake I can say a thousand

511
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,080
examples we can go on and on all day

512
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,919
about this there's a lot of confusion

513
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,760
people don't know what creates the

514
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,600
reactions the problem is Foods aren't

515
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,880
the only thing that caus reactions in

516
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,159
fact foods cause the least amount of

517
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,760
reactions it's other stuff happening

518
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,400
inside the body it's a liver intoxicated

519
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,480
with so many chemical compounds so many

520
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,919
different pathogenic chemicals and

521
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,440
neurotoxins and all of that is actually

522
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,919
going through the bloodstream hitting

523
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,600
other organs and creating problems and

524
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,320
hitting nerves as well and creating

525
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,400
nervous system symptoms so in the end

526
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,440
it's not really the food that's why

527
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,320
somebody else can eat whatever food they

528
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,480
want and they don't have any kind of

529
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,480
chemical

530
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,520
sensitivities often times when people

531
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,640
are chemical sensitive they'll blame the

532
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,480
food no matter what they'll be triggered

533
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,720
left and right and food will always get

534
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,720
the blame when in the end it's much

535
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,120
bigger than food it's much more than

536
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,840
that in another episode coming up we're

537
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,520
going to go deep into food sensitivities

538
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,960
people who are chemical sensitive start

539
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,799
reacting to everything though they react

540
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,200
to air they react to water they react to

541
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,640
food they react to chemicals they react

542
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,720
to just about everything and the problem

543
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,400
is with that is if you take a healing

544
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,440
food like a lemon water where you

545
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,640
squeeze a half a lemon in a glass of

546
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,080
water and drink that every morning to

547
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,760
clean the liver flush the liver flush

548
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,400
the kidneys of toxins what happens is

549
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,279
that when someone does that and they're

550
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,600
chemical sensitive and they're having

551
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,360
any kind of reactions they're going to

552
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,720
be like nope I got to stay away from

553
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,200
lemon water I can't do it I can't go

554
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,039
near it and then they get in trouble

555
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,480
what kind of trouble they're stuck in a

556
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,000
catch 22 they're stuck in a vicious

557
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,159
cycle where they need something to heal

558
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,480
but they're afraid of using it because

559
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,080
they're confused when someone got to the

560
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,919
point where they're really chemical

561
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,919
sensitive they got past the point of

562
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,000
dumbing everything down and numbing

563
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,559
everything out that means using foods to

564
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,720
suppress they can't do that anymore

565
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:48,360
successfully they can't suppress the

566
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,720
toxins suppress the poisons and suppress

567
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:55,080
the emotions anymore because at any

568
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,000
random time at any moment a spill out of

569
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,640
the liver can occur and fill the

570
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,480
bloodstream at any time that means

571
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,240
whatever they're suppressing themselves

572
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,240
with and holding down and bogging down

573
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,240
emotions whatever they're trying to do

574
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,279
to use food as comfort it doesn't mean

575
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,600
it will work it will always be a random

576
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,080
moment a random time where something

577
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,360
goes KY where nothing they try works

578
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,320
anymore now it's just Blind Faith

579
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,240
chemical sensitive people are right for

580
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,279
the picking they're lwh hanging fruit

581
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,279
four people who are selling detox is

582
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,000
selling the hole you're detoxing too

583
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,039
much that's why you're having reactions

584
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,799
you're detoxing too much that's why

585
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,840
you're sick try this concoction try

586
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:43,240
these ensures your Pathways aren't open

587
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,159
your detox Pathways aren't working which

588
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,399
is ridiculous because there's no science

589
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,360
or ability to see if their detox pathway

590
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:51,559
is working science still doesn't even

591
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,480
know what the detox pathway actually

592
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:57,559
really is it's all a theory but they'll

593
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,279
still sell that to you and detox sellers

594
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:03,120
will use the default mechanism it's you

595
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:06,360
and you're detoxing that's what it is

596
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,880
but overloaded livers and liver spills

597
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,200
does not mean you're detoxing you could

598
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,039
be sick and you're having spills your

599
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,880
liver is overloaded stagnant and

600
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,919
sluggish and stuff is coming out of the

601
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,039
liver it's filling your bloodstream but

602
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,320
that still doesn't mean you are detoxing

603
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,760
because all of that spill all of those

604
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,320
toxins is still going back into the

605
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,120
liver it's not leaving the body because

606
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,200
because whoever is offering the detox or

607
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,840
the program or whatever they're selling

608
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,840
is not properly getting the metals and

609
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,399
the poisons and the toxins and the

610
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,720
pathogens out of the body so what's

611
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,880
happening instead of it leaving the body

612
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,080
it's circulating and going right back

613
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,159
into the liver and making the person

614
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,440
sick and then they're telling the person

615
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,760
you're detoxing and our thing is working

616
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,679
proper detoxing is when it leaves the

617
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,960
liver and then leaves the body because

618
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,159
the person is doing the right things in

619
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,440
order for that to happen and when you're

620
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,120
properly detoxing and it's leaping the

621
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,720
body less reactions are occurring over

622
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,720
time it's riding out the storm when you

623
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,520
do the right things you could ride out

624
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,840
the storm and get to the other side and

625
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,360
it's hard to ride out the storm with all

626
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,840
the different stuff out there getting in

627
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,000
the way all the sharks selling all their

628
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,679
crap all the detox programs that have

629
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,120
stuff in there that cause problems with

630
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,440
the liver and all the Malarkey that's

631
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,320
going on it's hard to ride out the storm

632
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,399
when you don't know where you are in the

633
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,520
storm you're on a boat in the middle of

634
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:37,320
the ocean there's a hurricane and you

635
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,720
don't know which way is North South West

636
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,120
and East and even when you're doing the

637
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,080
right things to cleanse to heal you can

638
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,520
still get a brand new exposure that tips

639
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,840
the scale for a moment sends somebody

640
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,799
backwards a little bit scares them to

641
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,279
death and here we are right back into

642
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,080
the Catch 22 and the fear and the chaos

643
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,640
where we have to ride out the storm

644
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,279
because there are new Expos exposures

645
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,279
people get every single day and it adds

646
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,320
