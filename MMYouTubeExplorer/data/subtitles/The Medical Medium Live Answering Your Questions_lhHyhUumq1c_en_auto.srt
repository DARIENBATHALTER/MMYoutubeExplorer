don o'brien said hi how do you feel

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,680
about the rife machine well

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,760
the rife machine was around everybody

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,719
was still sick

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,120
i remember 35 years you know being in

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,680
this

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,079
in this all these years and it would be

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,760
like okay we got another

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
guessing game another guessing game

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,399
another guessing game

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,280
the rife machine was around everybody

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,719
was sick

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,879
everybody still had the chronic fatigue

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,720
syndrome and they had the rife machine

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
still had the chronic fatigue syndrome

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
unless they knew how to do the right

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,280
tools like

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
really clean up their diet just right

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,159
know what viruses to go after

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,560
truly know what they're doing and know

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,600
what supplements to take

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,640
to go anti-viral to go anti-bacterial

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,560
to get the metals out too and then

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,560
they would make improvements rife

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,799
machine or no rife machine

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,360
but back in the rife machine days it was

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,600
like okay rice machine what next

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,280
everybody still stays sick what next you

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,680
know that's what it was like

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,360
and it the only difference you might get

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,840
out of the rice machine now

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,520
is someone's actually maybe taking on a

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,799
couple of medical medium tools out there

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,320
because that's what i've seen i've seen

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,200
people say well the rife machine works

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,479
for me

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
and then you look at what they're doing

54
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,399
what else are you doing and they're like

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,439
oh i'm doing some celery juice or

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,200
i'm doing some spirulina or

57
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,799
i'm making sure there's no gluten and

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,960
dairy in here or um

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,399
and you'll find out then as you gather

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,680
it up there's a lot of little medical

61
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,959
medium tools all

62
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,720
spur interspersed in there and

63
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,080
and then if they're in the in the mood

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,360
that they think the right machine might

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,040
be open then they'll just

66
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
just call it the rife machine but i mean

67
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
years ago though it's like everybody

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,520
with the right machine nobody got better

69
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,239
that's how it was um good to be here

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
right here

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,720

know new people that

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
that haven't paid attention to medical

106
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
medium information they heard about

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,519
medical medium but they really haven't

108
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,879
paid attention to it or anything and

109
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,640
then they're like

110
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,319
leaving comments saying hey you should

111
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,879
write a book medical medium

112
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,480
you got some cool information you should

113
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,640
actually write a book

114
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,159
and it's funny because six new york

120
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,640
disease in people

121
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,080
um and the and the in the uh results are

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
and it's the funniest thing ever when

124
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,200
you hear that when you hear that in the

125
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,760
comments section all the time

126
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,080
medical medium you should write a book

127
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,720
it's really it's it's actually funny

128
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,519
um tracy phillips says i was wondering

129
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,560
about the ozone therapy as well

130
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,680
um back years ago

131
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,040
ozone therapy was still something that

132
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,440
was going down back then

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,800
but it was all experimental still is you

134
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,560
know that's how it is it's like well

135
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,759
what do you do with ozone therapy do you

136
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,520
breathe it in

137
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,520
and that's what happened in the original

138
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,120
days back years ago

139
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,800
people were breathing it in so they

140
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,880
would actually do ozone therapy and

141
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,160
breathe it in and it wasn't a good thing

142
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,680
that way not that

143
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,759
way so um so i'm not a big fan of ozone

144
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,960
therapy i'm not saying it's bad right

145
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,280
now just i wouldn't

146
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,479
i wouldn't use it as an inhalant i

147
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,720
wouldn't use it as a

148
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,720
a breath tech you know a breath

149
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,680
technique therapy where you're breathing

150
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,840
it in

151
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
on that level i wouldn't do it but i

152
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
mean i just wouldn't recommend that i'm

153
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
saying if your doctor wants to do that

154
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,639
and then and that's what you want to do

155
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
just do what you're going to do but i

156
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,440
wouldn't recommend that

157
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,479
but ozone therapy i'm not against it in

158
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,919
some dentistry

159
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,840
i'm not against it and some other

160
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,160
reasons too because the reason why i'm

161
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,919
i'm not against it so much with small

162
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,520
applications of it but

163
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,520
when you're sensitive it's a little edgy

164
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,800
and all the people that i've known and

165
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
all the doctors i've talked to over the

166
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
years that have

167
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,520
have wanted my help to troubleshoot

168
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,759
there are people

169
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,360
um a lot of sensitive people severe

170
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,880
chronic fatigue syndrome neurological

171
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
problems and ozone therapy was

172
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,400
too harsh so you got to apply it just

173
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,039
right

174
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,400
has to be in small settings or small

175
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,280
increments

176
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,479
small amounts for certain applications i

177
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,320
think i'll do a

178
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,720
medical medium podcast apple podcast

179
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
episode about it so you know just to air

180
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
it all out

181
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,919
because there's a lot to cover right

182
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,639
there tiffany says what time on

183
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,800

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,400

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
so that's something to keep your

190
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,199
notifications on make sure they're set

191
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,199
so that you get notified

192
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,720
and then so you're you know so you can

193
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,000
be there so just look out

194
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,360
um or constantly check too

195
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,520
because you know constantly be like is

196
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,880
he on is he on and check it out

197
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,000
so you can catch it um so yeah

198
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
so important to know

199
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
so i just saw a question about tinctures

200
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,360
and teas

201
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
would you explain the potency difference

202
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,800
between

203
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,280
teas and tinctures you can get a lot

204
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,039
more

205
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,720
extracted from a tincture you can take

206
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,000
it in higher dosages if you need to

207
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
therapeutic wise

208
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,160
like four dropper folds of a lemon balm

209
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,919
four times a day

210
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,520
versus tea it's a little harder to

211
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,520
extract it's not as strong

212
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,360
you gotta do a lot of it there's a

213
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,520
difference but i love the tea

214
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,319
but you know so what i do is i like

215
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,080
recommending the vimergy lemon balm and

216
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,520
so if i had it on me right here i'd show

217
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,160
you you guys probably know the vimer

218
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,960
gv's and victor i-m-e-r-g-y that's the

219
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,960
lemon balm

220
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,880
so you know you use the that's what i

221
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,479
would do it's like someone's got anxiety

222
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,720
i would do like four

223
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,680
five dropper fulls of that three four

224
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
times a day

225
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,880
personally that's what i would recommend

226
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,599
a family member or a friend

227
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,960
and you know i talk about that also when

228
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,560
cleanse the heel if you want to take a

229
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,599
look and cleanse the heel

230
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,520
but but uh the t it's harder to do that

231
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,479
i have the lemon balm tea here but still

232
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,000
it's a great thing

233
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,240
have you know keep it in there the whole

234
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
bit

235
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,120
michelle l the mo the most truth gets

236
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,319
the most haters

237
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,360
yes so true and boy

238
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,879
does medical medium get a lot of hate

239
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,639
and guess what still standing

240
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,240
still standing all right discrimination

241
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,080
lots of discrimination for hearing a

242
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,520
voice lots of discrimination

243
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,520
for getting people better over these

244
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,720
years lots of discrimination for

245
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,039
putting out six new york times

246
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,120

i never had pr marketing it's only been

254
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,360
done by me

255
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,599
and me alone as far as i decide what i'm

256
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,080
gonna do i decide how i'm gonna do it i

257
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,879
don't have any big pr marketing or

258
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,320
a marketing firm breathing down my neck

259
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,719
i don't hire a company

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,880
never did isn't that crazy just could

261
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
you imagine if i did could you imagine

262
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,959

263
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,320
into like these people do out there into

264
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,839

265
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
marketing firm can you imagine what

266
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,240
medical medium information would be

267
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
there

268
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,519
it would and look what it's doing now

269
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,160
organically millions of books around the

270
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,399
world

so many people

273
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,000
without marketing in pr and should i

274
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,600
shortcut stuff and do the cheat game

275
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
should i cheat and not have the

276
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,640
integrity and hire the big pr marketing

277
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,800
firms

278
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
and just have them pay their way through

279
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
so that something gets seen should i go

280
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,360
the cheap way

281
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,360
no i go to the organic grassroots way so

282
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,760

312
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,800
marketers vicki b if you had marketing

313
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,360
anthony you wouldn't be doing lives in

314
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,360
your kitchen

315
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,959
you see you know marketing firms have

316
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,440
tried to bang down my door

317
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,959
and said how dare you do it alone you're

318
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
not allowed to do that

319
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,640
you better hire one of us you know

320
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
marketing companies

321
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,560
they they don't like knowing i got

322
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,240
somewhere without them

323
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,079
and they would probably never let me do

324
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,000
it in my own kitchen they would probably

325
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,360
never let me sit here in my kitchen

326
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,560
talking crap

327
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,839
oh it's funny it's funny it's just that

328
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,279
i mean look look i've always had people

329
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,920
with chronic illness i've always had

330
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,920
their back and it's about

331
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,000
just being real you know not saying

332
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,240
you're being real not that stuff because

333
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,399
the marketing companies tell their

334
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,120
their uh clients to say be real and say

335
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,000
this and that and whatnot right and

336
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,640
that's what they do

337
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
too it's crazy it's crazy i mean people

338
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,640
pay them like

339
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
two million dollars a month i mean stuff

340
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,160
like that out there just to get

341
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
their books seen these you know fancy

342
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,560
doctors and some not all of them but

343
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:31,519
it's just crazy how it works

344
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,800
christy may what do i do with constant

345
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,440
cold sores

346
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,519
terrible i don't want to go on valtrex

347
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,399
but i have no choice

348
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,000
i feel i do lysine eat fruit greens all

349
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,399
day potato sweet potatoes

350
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,360
and even lettuce spinach nothing bad

351
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,800
question mark um so you're doing that

352
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,880
you're not doing the nutritional yeast

353
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,680
right that can easily stimulate a cold

354
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
sore

355
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,560
you're not doing the apple cider vinegar

356
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
right just making sure you're not doing

357
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
chocolate right

358
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,880
this did you do chocolate two weeks ago

359
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,920
did you do chocolate three weeks ago did

360
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,160
you have cacao

361
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,320
that that will cause simplex to just

362
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,680
bust out that'll just cause it busting

363
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,160
out i'm not saying you're doing any of

364
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,079
that

365
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,760
i'm just asking to make sure in case

366
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,720
there's something you have done

367
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,399
and and you haven't caught it and then

368
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,600
have you tried the simplex protocol in

369
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
here you can take to your

370
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,000
practitioner your family doctor whatever

371
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,120
it is and but have you seen that so and

372
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,160
cleanse the heel

373
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,959
um simplex protocol so

374
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,079
check that out maybe give that a try and

375
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,600
that's what i would recommend a family

376
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
member a friend you can always talk to

377
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
your doctor about it

378
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,959
but and so so even though you're eating

379
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,959
really clean no chocolate right because

380
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,720
chocolate is the

381
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:46,000
chocolate is the the herpes instigator

382
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,800
simplex is epstein bars

383
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
it's it's a trigger it's a trigger it is

384
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,720
the

385
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,480
it's a trigger i mean a little bit of

386
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,399
chocolate once in a blue moon fine or

387
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
whatever in a recipe once and

388
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,639
a while but people do a lot of chocolate

389
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,720
so yeah just be careful on those kinds

390
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,959
of things

391
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,959

bletchley says what causes your hair or

412
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,519
scalp to hurt

413
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,600
um a lot of neurotoxins cause that

414
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,839
that's one thing that occurs so any kind

415
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
of neurotoxins can cause that

416
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,680
any kind of low-grade viral infection

417
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,639
shingles is a big one for that for

418
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,680
hair and scalp to hurt or not hair but

419
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,000
scalp

420
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,240
yeah and well yeah i mean hair too to

421
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,320
the scalp area

422
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
so that can easily do that when you have

423
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,560
low grade viral infections so

424
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,760
i mean what i would do if my scalp was

425
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,880
hurting like that

426
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,880
i would be for sure making sure there's

427
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,480
no milk cheese butter eggs making sure

428
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,360
there's no apple cider vinegar or

429
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,399
vinegar

430
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,000
making sure that's out of your

431
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,440
out of your diet making sure there's no

432
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,600
nutritional yeast

433
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,199
making sure there's no corn or soy just

434
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,720
just try to eliminate those first no

435
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,120
pork and i know that's a lot i

436
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,199
i know that's a lot but i would do that

437
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,199
just to move the needle get the celery

438
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,920
juice in see if it starts breaking down

439
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,000
any low grade viral stuff

440
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,399
and and talk to your doctor i mean you

441
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,079
know and say hey look medical medium

442
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,079
has helped a lot of doctors and he tells

443
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,760
doctors about the fact that low-grade

444
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,240
vital stuff hurts the scalp because

445
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,920
those are

446
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
nerves and any kind of nerves means

447
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,560
neurotoxins you could talk to a

448
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
practitioner about that

449
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,600
they might the light bulb might hit over

450
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,880
their head and they might then help and

451
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,880

question up

493
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,079
i've been asked to do tv shows for years

494
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
and all the networks they've always

495
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,120
knocked on my door they want to do the

496
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,399
medical medium series the tv series but

497
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,160
i always felt that it wasn't going to be

498
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,079
it wasn't going to be enough about the

499
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,360
person it was going to be just me my

500
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,680
story my gift

501
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,600
and yeah i guess if he got a really big

502
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,399
ego that's really a fun thing to do you

503
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,240
know and

504
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,839
i'm not saying i don't have an ego right

505
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,920
everybody's got something in them

506
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,600
that sparked and says hey wait a minute

507
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,120
hey wait a minute but

508
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,199
um but i just don't want it to be about

509
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,600
me and that's what happened i remember

510
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,600
over 10 years ago even a little over 10

511
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,839
years ago i asked to do tv shows meaning

512
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,280
my own tv series my networks and i know

513
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,959
anybody else would have many other

514
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,520
people would have just jumped on it

515
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,240
and i get asked to this day for netflix

516
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,360
and other doc

517
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,480
docu-series documentaries tv shows

518
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,720
all of it so constantly get asked and

519
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,319
i turn it down and what do i do i mess

520
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,000
around on tick-tock

521
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,520
i don't want to say i turn all those

522
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,640
things down and yeah those things would

523
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,919
give me credibility

524
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
they would give me credibility i

525
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,919
realized that you know big production

526
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
company behind you

527
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,840
big you know hey let's protect him and

528
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
put him on one of the channels one of

529
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,240
the cable big cable networks

530
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
his own series and it would give you

531
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,120
credibility because then probably nobody

532
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,039
would mess with you you probably

533
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,440
wouldn't be tried to be messed with or

534
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,039
tried to be canceled all the time or try

535
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,960
to be discriminated against you'd have

536
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,000
like you'd have a big production company

537
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,400
over your

538
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,679
over umbrellaing you you know and i

539
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,200
guess it would give you some credibility

540
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,360
but you know what i do instead

541
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,480
i take my beatings take my lashings and

542
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,360

paralysis gastroparesis anything like

572
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
that

573
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,200
you know it depends if you're still

574
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,799
eating if you're not on a feeding tube

575
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,640
if you're on feeding tubes you know

576
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,160
there's other techniques and stuff but

577
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,600
if you're actually eating

578
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,600
and you're not on a feeding tube or

579
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,360
anything you know i personally like for

580
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,000
gastroparesis the

581
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,000

getting heavy metals out can really help

587
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,440

588
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,039

589
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,320

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,120

you're not in the u.s every time i read

616
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,840
your comments on youtube

617
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,280
um and facebook and stuff i think you're

618
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,000
you're

619
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,039
you're um i don't know if it's scotland

620
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,840
i don't know where it is but it's

621
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,840
somewhere out there

622
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,440
and i'm probably wrong about that from

623
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
what i remember susan janet

624
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,039
listen to his podcast on anxiety thank

625
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,200
you it's really a powerful podcast

626
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,760
episode you guys got to hear it

627
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,360
evelyn dixon my daughter has lipomas how

628
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,280
to correct it

629
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,400
first thing about lipomas to understand

630
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,760
my poems eat

631
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,600
they're hungry they have these little

632
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,240
tentacles coming off of them blood

633
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,880
vessels

634
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,240
so if you got a lipoma say you gotta you

635
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,280
gotta a lipoma

636
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,799
and it's there fatty tumor it's a fatty

637
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,720
growth it's got these

638
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,080
little blood vessels and these blood

639
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,200
vessels they

640
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,720
draw up food they draw food to keep the

641
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,600
lipoma growing right keep it alive and

642
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,880
what happens is if you're eating eggs

643
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
it's just going to feed the life home if

644
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,840
you're eating cheese and milk and butter

645
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,280
it's going to feed the lipoma

646
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,360
gluten feeds the life home so when

647
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,240
you're eating that food it goes into the

648
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,400
lipoma

649
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,320
so get those foods out for sure to start

650
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,559
with that's one thing you want to do

651
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,159

debra can you please say more about

701
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,240
osteoporosis yeah

702
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,280
osteoporosis really bad cases of it

703
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,840
including you know

704
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:38,080
stenosis that come with it including

705
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,200
um including other things too

706
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,520
just um ankylosing spondylitis including

707
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,720
all these different things that occur

708
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,159
um osteoporosis being like really

709
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,799
popular that's being like

710
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,559
one that so many people have a lot of

711
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,039
times people lose their calcium from

712
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,120
years of vinegar from years of caffeine

713
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,799
from years of acidosis that's a big

714
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,159
piece of it so they lose their calcium

715
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,760
so when you do vinegars

716
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,760
your calcium just sucks right out of

717
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,559
your bones and teeth all of it

718
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,240
so keep that in mind no vinegars keep

719
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,720
that in mind no caffeine

720
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,720
and then leafy greens leafy greens are

721
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,240
critical so like spinach like medical

722
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,080
medium spinach soups and

723
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,760
the medical medium healing broth every

724
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,320
day if you want hey trisha maurice here

725
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,240
just saw that comment come up

726
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,919
incredible so glad you're here oranges

727
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,919
are important citrus is critical for

728
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,320
osteoporosis like oranges

729
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,960
grapefruits lemons those are so

730
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,720
important for osteoporosis you guys

731
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,120
so important it's a big deal um

732
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,039
because that's where the calcium is the

733
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,240
calcium is there you know broccoli is

734
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,480
important too but

735
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
but really the citrus is a big deal

736
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,679
because calcium is deep in the earth and

737
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,919
the citrus trees the

738
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,919
roots go deep into the earth and they

739
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,520
grow in places that are high in calcium

740
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,320
it's really important um

741
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,240
really important um yeah so going to

742
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,039
tick-tock just so you guys know but i'm

743
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,559

is okay daily

773
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,600
um make sure you don't do too much uh

774
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,279
depending on if you're feeling sick and

775
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,120
you got problems with anything like that

776
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,559
i would stick to celery juice spinach

777
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,480
soups keep the salt away

778
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,840
use lemon on everything have some

779
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,679
tomatoes in your food

780
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,520
and that's the kind of salt intake

781
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,400
that's natural that's really incredible

782
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,559
for you

783
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,919
and i would keep back on the salt but if

784
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,320
you're somebody that really loves salt

785
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,480
